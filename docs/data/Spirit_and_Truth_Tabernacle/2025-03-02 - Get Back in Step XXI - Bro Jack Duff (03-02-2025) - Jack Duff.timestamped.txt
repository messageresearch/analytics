[51:27] before I would um go into the word amen
[51:32] I want to do something this morning that
[51:34] has never been done at Spirit and Truth
[51:38] Tabernacle amen but um I pray that today
[51:41] will be the first of many days uh where
[51:45] this will happen uh at Spirit and Truth
[51:48] Tabernacle
[51:50] um we were I I want to say it was a the
[51:54] combined service that we did in
[52:00] um uh December we were there at um at
[52:05] Rapture and Faith Tabernacle we did the
[52:06] combined service and and brother Mike uh
[52:09] asked you know for all the ministers in
[52:12] the congregation to stand and uh you
[52:15] know so all the ministers stood and uh
[52:19] and during that time uh brother Jerry
[52:21] stood brother Troy stood and um and you
[52:26] know and and brother Mike just
[52:27] acknowledged you know the ministers that
[52:29] were that were present and it just kind
[52:32] of struck me at that time uh that we had
[52:34] never uh forly ordained our
[52:39] ministers amen and so uh today I want to
[52:45] formally ordain our
[52:48] ministers praise
[52:53] God um we thank God for these brother
[52:56] others that have been a tremendous help
[53:00] uh to Spirit and Truth
[53:02] Tabernacle and uh you know I I I just go
[53:07] back to just my early days and things
[53:11] like that um you know I was ordained
[53:15] actually in Georgia by brother uh Larry
[53:18] Brown and um and I just remember you
[53:22] know just um um even you know that time
[53:25] of my life where I was kind of
[53:27] uh trying to find the will of the Lord
[53:29] for for me I just I I didn't I just
[53:32] didn't know what direction I was headed
[53:34] in I I was I was quite confused quite
[53:39] confused but um you know I thank God
[53:43] that the Lord just had different ones
[53:46] that were in my life at that time to
[53:48] kind of help me you know through that
[53:50] phase of my journey and uh and when I
[53:53] look back uh over uh the the step of
[53:57] faith that we took way back then uh to
[54:00] see where God has brought us to now uh
[54:03] all I can say is I am grateful amen I am
[54:06] truly truly grateful amen uh God I
[54:11] believe has proven himself um in more
[54:13] ways than one uh in all of our lives uh
[54:17] God has proven that this has been a
[54:19] church that he has established amen this
[54:22] is not the work of a man but this is the
[54:24] work of almighty God and and we're we're
[54:27] we're just want to give him glory and
[54:28] honor amen and what he's doing so uh
[54:31] years ago I would have never known that
[54:34] I would be here today uh ordaining these
[54:37] brothers we have four brothers in our
[54:39] church that uh Minister for us on a
[54:42] regular basis but never officially been
[54:44] ordained so today uh we want to uh take
[54:48] time to do that amen so I want to read a
[54:51] couple scriptures and uh I'm going to
[54:55] have um uh our brothers just kind of
[54:59] come maybe uh do me a favor and um just
[55:05] just give me one chair and just put it
[55:07] right on that end there just one chair
[55:10] there you go there you go perfect just
[55:12] put it on the end and I'mma ask um
[55:16] brother uh brother Troy brother Jerry
[55:21] brother Mark and brother Quinton if they
[55:24] would come and take these first
[55:26] uh four chairs here on this side brother
[55:29] Troy brother Mark brother Jerry and
[55:33] brother Quinton Jr amen I have a few
[55:37] scriptures that I want to read amen uh
[55:42] today praise
[55:45] God
[55:47] amen
[55:50] amen um 1 Timothy
[55:53] 4 um is the the first um scripture that
[55:59] I'll read amen 1 Timothy 4 um and I want
[56:04] to start here at verse uh
[56:11] [Music]
[56:18] 14 first Timothy
[56:21] 4 verse
[56:23] 14 scripture says uh
[56:27] um neglect not the
[56:30] gift that is in
[56:32] thee which was given thee by
[56:35] Prophecy with the laying on of the hands
[56:39] of the Pres uh
[56:42] presbyter um meditate upon these things
[56:46] give thyself holy to them that thy
[56:50] profiting may appear to all take heed
[56:53] unto
[56:54] thyself and unto the
[56:57] doctrine continue in them for in doing
[57:01] this Thou shalt both save thyself and
[57:04] them that hear thee and when I think
[57:06] about what Paul wrote there as far as uh
[57:09] take heed unto thyself and unto the
[57:11] doctrine um brother Brandon when he did
[57:14] um
[57:15] ordination there was um he did this once
[57:18] before and and um as he was ordaining
[57:21] these brothers uh there were some people
[57:24] that start walking up some other
[57:25] brothers start walking up and and uh
[57:27] saying hey I never been ordained I want
[57:29] to be ordained too I want to be ordained
[57:31] too so brother random made it very clear
[57:33] he says now um we are we are ordaining
[57:36] people to preach this message that we
[57:40] believe amen and he says now you know uh
[57:44] because you can go anywhere and get
[57:45] ordained you can go to the Internet and
[57:47] get get get get ordination certificates
[57:49] but but we talk about the doctrine it's
[57:51] this message that we believe and we we
[57:53] believe God is calling ministers to help
[57:56] amen spread this word uh to the Nations
[57:59] amen so Brothers as we are uh uh
[58:01] approaching this this ordination is that
[58:03] we would stay true to this message that
[58:06] God has given us amen Stay True to this
[58:09] word that God has given us another
[58:11] scripture amen that I want to read um
[58:15] for you praise God is coming out of the
[58:18] book of um
[58:20] Jeremiah amen this is going to be
[58:23] Jeremiah verse 20
[58:27] amen Jeremiah verse 20 and uh verse
[58:31] 9 I pray God would just continue to uh
[58:36] flood you Brothers with
[58:38] inspiration and that uh his word would
[58:41] be as it was to
[58:43] Jeremiah amen and your souls Jeremiah 20
[58:47] and verse
[58:48] 9 it says uh then I said I will not make
[58:52] mention of him nor speak anymore in his
[58:55] name now Jeremiah was going through a
[58:57] number of Trials uh uh difficulties in
[59:01] his life and um and and and I want to
[59:04] help help I want our brothers understand
[59:06] it's it's not going to be
[59:08] easy um you know you're going to have to
[59:10] go through some things but in the midst
[59:12] of going through I was telling you when
[59:13] I went up there to um Georgia and I got
[59:16] my ordination um I think the time I went
[59:19] my wife and I we got all the way to the
[59:22] exit uh one of our trips up to Georgia
[59:24] we got a flat tire next trip we got all
[59:27] the way to the exit and realized we left
[59:28] our clothes back home in Florida and uh
[59:33] had to immediately go to the store and
[59:36] find something I'm like Lord what why
[59:37] would I come all the way out here and
[59:39] I'm thinking why I why I got these
[59:41] trials but you know these trials are
[59:43] just there to make us strong all right
[59:45] and uh and just because you go through a
[59:47] trial don't mean God is not with you
[59:50] amen it does not mean God is not with
[59:52] you brother random say the Cloudy Skies
[59:55] amen and the um the storms of life that
[59:59] don't mean that God is not with us
[1:00:01] neither do clear skies mean that God is
[1:00:04] with us you know the reason we know he's
[1:00:06] with us because he told us that he'll
[1:00:07] never leave us nor forsake us but here
[1:00:10] Jeremiah says then I said I will not
[1:00:13] make mention of him nor speak anymore in
[1:00:15] his name but his word was in my heart as
[1:00:20] a burning fire shut up in my bones and I
[1:00:23] was weary with forbearing and I could
[1:00:25] not stay so Jeremiah got to a spot where
[1:00:27] he just could not help but preach the
[1:00:29] gospel and I trust that that'll be your
[1:00:31] experience my brothers that God would
[1:00:33] just put that in your heart it'll be
[1:00:34] like fire shut up in your bones let me
[1:00:38] give you amen uh Proverbs 18- 16 this is
[1:00:42] one of my favorite and um and I want to
[1:00:45] say this uh over each of these brothers
[1:00:48] brother brandom you know told
[1:00:50] us that um when it comes to
[1:00:54] Ministry uh one of the big things is
[1:00:56] that you have to watch your motive and
[1:00:58] your
[1:00:58] objective uh what's the purpose why why
[1:01:01] are you doing it and uh for the time
[1:01:05] that um all of these brothers have been
[1:01:07] here ministering um their motive and
[1:01:10] objective has been very pure it's been
[1:01:13] very clean they have not done this for
[1:01:15] any other reason but to try to further
[1:01:17] the gospel uh they not it's not a
[1:01:20] popularity contest uh it is it is it is
[1:01:24] you know not trying to force themselves
[1:01:25] goes into pull pits they they don't do
[1:01:29] that they haven't done that not one of
[1:01:31] these brothers have ever called me and
[1:01:32] said brother Jack I got something to say
[1:01:34] so when you're going to let me say it
[1:01:36] none of that happens with these brothers
[1:01:39] uh they wait for their opportunity when
[1:01:41] God opens up the door they step right in
[1:01:44] and they do what they're supposed to do
[1:01:46] right and uh and and one of the things
[1:01:48] that I that I that I love about is that
[1:01:50] um um it it's it's according to the
[1:01:53] scripture and Proverbs 18
[1:01:56] uh and 16 tells us this a man's
[1:02:01] gift maketh room for him glory to God
[1:02:05] and bringeth him before great men and uh
[1:02:08] and even with uh us having seven
[1:02:11] ministers in this church uh each one
[1:02:14] waits for their opportunity and you know
[1:02:16] while they waiting the amen and the
[1:02:18] other brother that's going forth I
[1:02:21] appreciate these these brothers I I
[1:02:23] really really appreciate these brothers
[1:02:26] [Music]
[1:02:28] Glory you sometimes you go to churches
[1:02:31] and people just fighting to try to get
[1:02:32] into the pull pit I got something to say
[1:02:34] no no no no often when you when you
[1:02:37] pushing to get in you ain't got nothing
[1:02:39] to say Amen when you doing that you
[1:02:42] really ain't got nothing to say but you
[1:02:44] just waiting on the Lord that's when we
[1:02:45] want to hear from you praise God um you
[1:02:49] know I I'm going to share this well let
[1:02:52] me I want let me just share this other
[1:02:54] scripture and I I'll share something
[1:02:55] else else later but the last scripture I
[1:02:57] want to read is out of Mark uh
[1:03:00] 15 amen
[1:03:02] Mark
[1:03:04] [Music]
[1:03:06] chapter just make sure it might be Mark
[1:03:08] 16 Mark
[1:03:10] 16
[1:03:12] um Jesus gives us these instructions and
[1:03:17] I just want to read the words of Our
[1:03:18] Lord over our
[1:03:21] brothers Mark um 16 and verse
[1:03:30] 15 Jesus says and he said unto
[1:03:34] them go ye into all the world and preach
[1:03:38] the gospel to Every
[1:03:41] Creature he that believeth and is
[1:03:44] baptized shall be saved but he that
[1:03:47] believeth not shall be

[1:22:20] preaching un to them that dwell on the
[1:22:22] earth and to Every Nation and Kindred
[1:22:25] and tongue and people Sayang with a loud
[1:22:29] voice fear
[1:22:31] God and give glory to him for the hour
[1:22:34] of his judgment has come and worship him
[1:22:37] that made Heaven and Earth and the Sea
[1:22:40] and The Fountains of waters and there
[1:22:43] followed another Angel saying Babylon is
[1:22:46] Fallen is Fallen that great City because

[1:22:54] of the wrath of her
[1:22:57] fornication uh and the third Angel

[1:23:06] if any man worship the Beast and His
[1:23:08] Image and receive his Mark in his
[1:23:11] forehead or in his hand the same shall
[1:23:14] drink of the wine of the wrath of God
[1:23:17] which is poured out without mixture into
[1:23:20] the cup of his indignation and shall be
[1:23:23] tormented with fire and Bre Brimstone uh
[1:23:25] in the presence of the Holy
[1:23:28] Angels uh and in the presence of the
[1:23:30] lamb and the smoke of their torment
[1:23:33] ascended up forever and ever and they
[1:23:36] have no rest day uh nor night who
[1:23:39] worship the beast in His image and
[1:23:42] whosoever receiveth the mark of his name
[1:23:46] here is the patience of the Saints here
[1:23:49] are they that keep the Commandments of

[1:25:26] Step
[1:25:28] amen um there has been others that have
[1:25:33] come uh on the
[1:25:36] scene and and uh and in one particular
[1:25:42] instance God used a prophet to try to
[1:25:46] bring the people back into
[1:25:48] step and um that instance
[1:25:53] was uh
[1:25:55] somehow the the children of Israel after
[1:25:58] all these
[1:26:00] tremendous uh victories that they had uh
[1:26:03] things that God had done uh for them and
[1:26:08] um opening up the Red Sea and the and
[1:26:11] the plagues in Egypt and you know they
[1:26:14] they saw the
[1:26:16] supernatural it was so common Amen to
[1:26:20] the children of Israel and some of the
[1:26:22] things that happened to to this group of
[1:26:24] people when we read it in scripture uh
[1:26:27] it brings inspiration to us I I for me
[1:26:31] I'll say it brings inspiration to me
[1:26:33] when I'm facing amen a a great trial my
[1:26:37] mind always goes back to God you open up
[1:26:40] a Red
[1:26:42] Sea right I mean I I start I start
[1:26:45] talking like that you open up a Red Sea
[1:26:48] you you shut the mouth of lions you took
[1:26:52] heat out of a fire I mean I mean I just
[1:26:55] go back to things that happen with the
[1:26:57] children of Israel and my faith get
[1:26:59] inspired right and uh so when we look
[1:27:01] back at children of Israel I mean
[1:27:03] somehow they got to a a a place where
[1:27:07] maybe they forgot about those things
[1:27:08] that God had done and uh and here in the
[1:27:11] Days of
[1:27:12] Elijah praise God the Prophet Elijah
[1:27:15] here Ahab is on the throne he has his
[1:27:17] wife Jezebel and and and they are in a
[1:27:20] they are in a backsliding condition amen
[1:27:23] underneath the leader of Ahab they're in
[1:27:25] a backsliding condition but uh Ahab has
[1:27:28] to come down amen uh God sends him out
[1:27:32] of out of hiding he comes into amen the
[1:27:35] uh into the nation and he says look we
[1:27:37] going to have to we going to have to get
[1:27:40] back in Step hallelujah amen we going we
[1:27:43] going to have to we going to have to uh
[1:27:46] uh uh set up a challenge here amen he
[1:27:48] say he say I'm tired of seeing people
[1:27:51] serving an idol God Amen I'm tired of uh
[1:27:55] uh I mean uh hearing about how baale is
[1:27:57] impacting the people especially with all
[1:28:00] that God has done for us amen I'm TI say
[1:28:02] we going to have to we going to have to
[1:28:04] set up some altars here and now he say
[1:28:06] say when you set up your altar and all
[1:28:08] these prophets of Bale let them call on
[1:28:11] bail and and the god that answers by
[1:28:13] fire let that God be the god of Israel
[1:28:17] and what what what what Elijah was doing
[1:28:19] was trying to bring the children of
[1:28:21] Israel back in step with the word of
[1:28:26] God we're not the first generation Amen
[1:28:29] to to need a sermon like this I also
[1:28:31] think of Amen what happened in the days
[1:28:35] of Joshua and and again here God not
[1:28:38] only you know uh uh here the children of
[1:28:41] Israel you know they they they saw what
[1:28:43] happened with their parents and now or
[1:28:46] their grandparents but now they're going
[1:28:47] into the the the promised land and and
[1:28:50] and when they get there they they see
[1:28:51] how God destroys the enemy right before
[1:28:53] the very eyes all the great things God
[1:28:56] was doing in the midst of the people but
[1:28:59] yet Joshua comes to a spot amen where he
[1:29:02] he has to uh uh uh put a choice before
[1:29:06] the people praise God I like this
[1:29:09] because amen that that when when Joshua
[1:29:11] brought them to this place amen we take
[1:29:15] these statements from Joshua and we hang
[1:29:17] them in our
[1:29:19] houses Hallelujah we hanging in our
[1:29:22] house and and and there Comes A Time
[1:29:24] that sometimes we have to we have to put
[1:29:26] our foot down with our
[1:29:28] children right and when we have to kind
[1:29:30] of let them know where we stand and and
[1:29:33] we have to tell them things like you
[1:29:34] can't do that in this house Hallelujah
[1:29:38] and and we go back we we fall back on
[1:29:41] the words of Joshua we say because
[1:29:43] because as for me in my house hallelujah
[1:29:47] amen we going to serve the Lord and when
[1:29:50] Joshua came up with that statement it
[1:29:52] because the children of Israel were
[1:29:54] getting out of step and Joshua made a
[1:29:57] statement to try to bring them back in
[1:30:00] Step we're not the first generation to
[1:30:02] have to go through these things so it's
[1:30:04] a very important amen series that we're
[1:30:07] in because the history just has a
[1:30:09] strange way of repeating itself as I
[1:30:12] said in the Days of
[1:30:14] Elijah God was using a prophet to bring
[1:30:17] the people back in line with his word
[1:30:21] and uh and what we've been doing here is
[1:30:23] just kind of walk through a a a series
[1:30:26] of of of of scriptures and amen I want
[1:30:28] to just uh uh uh fall back a little bit
[1:30:30] and and and um I'm I won't quote the
[1:30:33] full quote here from the exposition
[1:30:35] exposition of the seven Church ages but
[1:30:37] I want to just make it make uh reference
[1:30:41] to a couple things brother random said
[1:30:43] in her will be the fullness of Pentecost
[1:30:46] for the spirit will bring the people
[1:30:47] right back to where they were at the
[1:30:49] beginning and her that means us the
[1:30:51] bride he says that is thus sayth the
[1:30:53] Lord another statement that he makes
[1:30:55] amen God isn't going to plant a new
[1:30:58] church amen but is going to bring his
[1:31:01] original planting back to original seeds
[1:31:05] amen and I believe brother uh Caper
[1:31:07] saying the original life the original
[1:31:10] word right that's what we believe God
[1:31:12] has brought us back to that Original
[1:31:14] Seed and look God wasn't raising up a
[1:31:17] new church oh my amen God was restoring
[1:31:21] the church and in order to restore the
[1:31:23] church he had to pull us out of certain
[1:31:26] places oh Hallelujah we were in the
[1:31:29] denominational systems but God had to
[1:31:32] pull us out of that in order to start
[1:31:34] this restoration
[1:31:36] process hallelujah amen so he say he
[1:31:39] says God isn't going to plant a new
[1:31:41] church but it's going to bring its
[1:31:42] original planting back to Original Seed
[1:31:46] he is doing it as stated in verse 23
[1:31:49] talk about Joel 2:23 but by the teaching
[1:31:52] or former reign next will come the
[1:31:55] Harvest rain of the Rapture and Faith
[1:31:57] now let me let me let me hone in on that
[1:31:59] just for a little bit God is doing the
[1:32:02] restoration by the teaching of former
[1:32:05] Reign so it's very important that we
[1:32:08] take time to lay certain things in we
[1:32:11] have to teach it because that's how God
[1:32:14] is doing the restoration now I want I
[1:32:17] mentioned this before this restoration
[1:32:19] is not just for us that's inside the
[1:32:21] four walls here but there are people
[1:32:23] listen on the line that have never heard
[1:32:25] these things before they don't realize
[1:32:28] that they have tapped into amen a
[1:32:30] prophecy that God was going to restore
[1:32:33] them and it's happening as they're
[1:32:36] listening to the word oh my my my my my
[1:32:40] the word is powerful y'all amen you know
[1:32:43] it's the word that created uh everything
[1:32:45] that we have the seat that you sitting
[1:32:47] in is created by the spoken word of God
[1:32:50] hallelujah so the the word the word the
[1:32:52] word brings things into existence so you
[1:32:55] know it's very important that we
[1:32:56] understand that that that restoration is
[1:32:58] happening right now glory to God he also
[1:33:01] says uh when he's talking about the
[1:33:03] denominational Church uh in this day he
[1:33:06] said that they will outshine the elect
[1:33:09] and effort and Zeal cuz sometimes you
[1:33:11] know people will look at us and say now
[1:33:13] brother y'all talk about y'all got all
[1:33:14] this but look at look at y'all look at
[1:33:17] where you at look at look at and and the
[1:33:20] problem is they don't understand that
[1:33:23] it's not a it's not buildings that bring
[1:33:26] the presence of
[1:33:27] God it's not buildings that do that oh
[1:33:31] my the prophet told us that amen it's
[1:33:34] the character of the people amen that is
[1:33:37] actually the beauty of the church it's
[1:33:40] not the building that's going to get it
[1:33:41] done but it's the character of the
[1:33:43] people that will get it done and the
[1:33:45] people's character has been formed and
[1:33:47] shaped by the word of
[1:33:50] God oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:33:53] we realize is more than the building we
[1:33:54] done been in buildings before and we've
[1:33:57] been miserable inside a
[1:34:01] building oh my I thank God for Freedom
[1:34:04] Church amen but but but but but we're
[1:34:06] not looking at buildings we're not
[1:34:07] looking at things like that I mean I you
[1:34:10] know I I I had the opportunity to kind
[1:34:12] of you know uh uh uh uh put all this to
[1:34:15] the side I I was offered I was offered
[1:34:18] to come on staff and be a pastor at a
[1:34:20] big
[1:34:21] church Hallelujah they they said we we
[1:34:24] we we want somebody like you and and I
[1:34:26] had a tell him say no no no no no no no
[1:34:28] no no um I mean it's like I I the only
[1:34:31] example I can say it's like a a woman
[1:34:33] you know God I mean here she been
[1:34:35] waiting to have this baby for a long
[1:34:37] time God finally give it a baby and then
[1:34:39] you're going to tell the lady to give
[1:34:40] the baby away no said no I can't do it
[1:34:43] like that I just have to just I'm no God
[1:34:45] ain't told me that and I don't care what
[1:34:47] the offer is God ain't told me that I'm
[1:34:49] going to stay right with what God gave
[1:34:50] me and here's the other thing I'm I'm
[1:34:52] going to let you I'm going you see
[1:34:54] something when Jesus came to Earth did
[1:34:56] he go to a king's Palace to be
[1:34:59] born no he went to some place very
[1:35:02] humble amen and let me tell you the
[1:35:04] place that you going to find Christ
[1:35:05] today in some humble
[1:35:08] place if they found if Shepherds found
[1:35:10] them in a humble place then you will
[1:35:12] find them in a humble place now because
[1:35:15] God hides and reveals himself in
[1:35:20] Simplicity glory to God so don't look at
[1:35:23] a building don't look at that you want
[1:35:25] to go beyond the building you want to
[1:35:26] hear what's being said in the
[1:35:29] [Applause]
[1:35:30] [Music]
[1:35:31] building so brother brandom tells us to
[1:35:34] they have Shine the the the the the
[1:35:36] elect and effort and Zeal but it is
[1:35:38] layer the see and out of Christ for it
[1:35:40] looks for big crowds big programs and
[1:35:43] Starling signs amongst them they preach
[1:35:45] the second coming of Christ but deny the
[1:35:50] Advent of the Prophet messenger this is
[1:35:53] the the point that I that I want to keep
[1:35:55] making here deny the Advent of the
[1:35:57] Prophet messenger though though in power
[1:36:00] and sence and true true Revelation he
[1:36:02] eclipses them all now brother brandham
[1:36:05] amen makes this statement about the
[1:36:08] Advent and what that means it's the
[1:36:10] arrival uh the arrival of a notable
[1:36:13] person amen a notable thing or event
[1:36:17] they deny the Advent I can I can tell
[1:36:19] you amen the scripture that I just read
[1:36:22] to you out of Revelation
[1:36:24] 14 is a past tense
[1:36:28] scripture now uh and I I'll get there in
[1:36:31] a second but I I'll tell you this I just
[1:36:34] I I when I pick up my Bible and you know
[1:36:36] sometime they have little notes and
[1:36:37] things like that in the Bible and uh and
[1:36:40] as I was reading you know the notes in
[1:36:41] my Bible it was saying Revelation 14 was
[1:36:44] something that's going to happen during
[1:36:45] the tribulation period amen and and as
[1:36:48] and if you were to take that studying
[1:36:50] your Bible if you were to take that
[1:36:52] that's what most people go preaching cuz
[1:36:54] actually most people when they pick up
[1:36:56] the Book of Revelation they don't they
[1:36:57] have no idea what it mean anyway so
[1:36:59] since they don't know what it mean they
[1:37:01] just kind of take what some learned man
[1:37:03] would say hallelujah glory to God now
[1:37:06] you have a choice amen you can take what
[1:37:09] a learned man has said amen a theologian
[1:37:13] you can take what a learned man has said
[1:37:14] or you can take what a prophet has
[1:37:17] said and and I'm one that firmly
[1:37:19] believes if prophets wrote the Bible
[1:37:23] they would take prophets to reveal the
[1:37:27] Bible Hallelujah so so I I'll tell you
[1:37:30] based on what a prophet tells us this
[1:37:33] scripture has already been fulfilled all
[1:37:37] right let me keep going so the Advent
[1:37:39] amen of this Prophet messenger I have
[1:37:42] been walking through a few scriptures
[1:37:44] with you all and uh we're continuing our
[1:37:47] journey uh here in Revelation the the
[1:37:50] we've talked about what brother bram's
[1:37:51] Ministry is all about he is the prop
[1:37:53] messenger that God sent on the scene and
[1:37:56] and and he's not coming glory to God
[1:37:59] just to say he's coming but he's coming
[1:38:02] because scripture said he was coming
[1:38:06] amen and if he does things according to
[1:38:08] scripture then we know we standing on
[1:38:10] the right foundation so so what are some
[1:38:12] of these scriptures that promised that
[1:38:14] brother brandom would be coming now now
[1:38:17] now now now now now now let me just also
[1:38:19] make it very clear cuz most people would
[1:38:21] go to their Bible and they would read
[1:38:23] say now I don't see his
[1:38:25] name in the Bible I don't see his name
[1:38:29] in the Bible so how y'all say that's him
[1:38:32] well let me just ask let me just help
[1:38:34] you understand you would not have saw
[1:38:36] the name of John the Baptist in the Old
[1:38:41] Testament now how would you know that
[1:38:44] was
[1:38:45] him you in the S named John the Baptist
[1:38:50] Glory I I can go a little further you
[1:38:53] won't even even see the name
[1:38:55] Jesus in the Old Testament so how do you
[1:38:58] know that's
[1:39:01] him come on now I can tell you that the
[1:39:04] way that you're going to find out that
[1:39:05] it's him God got to give you a
[1:39:08] revelation of who Jesus Is God got to
[1:39:11] give you a revelation of who John the
[1:39:13] Baptist is and the same God is able to
[1:39:16] give you a revelation of who William
[1:39:19] brandom
[1:39:21] is Oh Glory to God Amen it takes
[1:39:25] Revelation to understand these things so
[1:39:28] I I need you I need you to be able to go
[1:39:30] a little further with me when we look at
[1:39:31] it so when we're not looking for his
[1:39:33] physical name we're looking at his
[1:39:35] ministry
[1:39:37] hallelujah oh my here we found I I I I
[1:39:41] I've preached and I'm giving you some of
[1:39:43] the scriptures now about the Advent so
[1:39:45] here's one scripture that I've preached
[1:39:47] to you thus far Malachi 4 verse 5 and 6
[1:39:52] and when I preach that also gave you the
[1:39:54] five comings of the spirit of Elijah
[1:39:56] that would come amen according to
[1:39:58] scripture and I and I keep using that
[1:40:00] term according to scripture according to
[1:40:02] scripture because I it's not what I
[1:40:05] think it's what the Bible says it's not
[1:40:07] what you think it's what the Bible says
[1:40:10] so Malachi 4: 5 and 6 I also gave you
[1:40:14] amen Revelation 3
[1:40:16] and14 amen that was a scripture that we
[1:40:18] we ministered on Revelation 10 and 7 is
[1:40:23] another scripture that refers to this
[1:40:25] ministry coming amen uh I I also
[1:40:28] preached on St Luke 17 verse 26-30
[1:40:33] that's another scripture amen that
[1:40:35] refers to brother brandom's Ministry
[1:40:38] amen and the time that this ministry
[1:40:39] would be on the earth these scriptures
[1:40:42] prophesy of it amen also I gave you
[1:40:44] Revelation 18 that was the last one that
[1:40:48] I gave you now I want to pick up on
[1:40:50] Revelation 18 I want to read that really
[1:40:53] quick and then we're going to go forward
[1:40:55] amen because uh the next scripture that
[1:40:57] we're we're dealing with today that
[1:40:59] speaks to brother brandom's Ministry is
[1:41:01] revelation
[1:41:02] 14 Hallelujah so I said Revelation 18
[1:41:06] and now Revelation 14 look at all these
[1:41:08] past tense scriptures now watch this
[1:41:11] church Revelation 18 let's read verse
[1:41:14] 1-4 glory to God Amen and after these
[1:41:20] things I saw another Angel come down
[1:41:22] from Heaven having great power and the
[1:41:26] Earth was lightened with his glory amen
[1:41:30] and he cried mightily with a strong
[1:41:32] voice saying Babylon the great is Fallen
[1:41:36] is fallen and has become the habitation
[1:41:38] of devils and the hold of every foul
[1:41:40] spirit and a cage of every unclean and
[1:41:42] hateful bird for all nations have drunk
[1:41:45] of the wine of the wrath of her
[1:41:46] fornication and the kings of the Earth
[1:41:49] have committed fornication with her and
[1:41:51] the merchants of the Earth are are wax
[1:41:54] Rich through the abundance of her Del
[1:41:56] abundance of her delicacy it says and I
[1:41:59] heard another voice from Heaven saying
[1:42:02] come out of her my people that you be
[1:42:05] not partakers of her sins that you
[1:42:07] receive not of her plagues now now
[1:42:10] brother brandom clearly uh helps us
[1:42:12] understand that this this act pertains
[1:42:14] to his ministry where he's calling us
[1:42:16] out of
[1:42:18] denominational
[1:42:20] systems we heard the voice of God
[1:42:23] through his Prophet call us out of
[1:42:26] denominational systems amen come out of
[1:42:30] her my people you want to know why we

[1:43:48] KJV but the but the Bible say a bishop
[1:43:52] must be husband
[1:43:53] of one
[1:43:55] wife so how's a woman going to be a
[1:44:00] [Music]
[1:44:02] bishop I mean just tell me how we get
[1:44:05] how did the church get so far off this
[1:44:08] is why God gives a sermon get back in
[1:44:12] Step In step with what in step with the
[1:44:15] word of
[1:44:18] God God going to judge us according to
[1:44:20] his
[1:44:21] word it's not be judg we're not going to
[1:44:24] be judged according to no denomination
[1:44:26] we're going to be judged according to
[1:44:27] his word and you know people in
[1:44:29] denomination systems they actually they
[1:44:30] can see the spirit is wrong they they
[1:44:33] actually they hate seeing
[1:44:34] division this church and can't
[1:44:37] Fellowship here and can't do this and
[1:44:38] can't do that and I mean they hate
[1:44:40] seeing that they want they want they
[1:44:42] want to see it togetherness glory to God
[1:44:44] but it's hard to bring it togetherness
[1:44:46] amen when we when we when we can't get
[1:44:48] together on the word how can two walk
[1:44:49] together except they be
[1:44:51] agreed all right all right so when we
[1:44:55] look at this scripture here Revelation
[1:44:58] 18 was saying a angel coming down from
[1:45:01] heaven and often time when we look at
[1:45:03] things like this the first thing we
[1:45:05] think about is like a being with with
[1:45:09] wings and and all of that coming down
[1:45:11] but you know we got to understand that
[1:45:13] according to scripture give me Galatians
[1:45:16] 4:14 according to scripture a
[1:45:20] man can be an angel
[1:45:25] and and and in Revelation 2 and 3 uh
[1:45:28] you'll see in and to the angel of the
[1:45:30] Church of
[1:45:31] Ephesus and to the angel of the Church
[1:45:34] of this and the angel of the Church of
[1:45:36] of Philadelphia the angel of the Church
[1:45:38] of saris the angel of the Church of
[1:45:40] pergamus VRA amen the angel of the
[1:45:44] Church of
[1:45:45] Leia right you'll see when when it's
[1:45:47] speaking of the Angel of the church it
[1:45:49] is not talking about a being coming down
[1:45:52] from from from from from heaven with
[1:45:54] wings now now now I will tell you it is
[1:45:57] a being coming from Heaven I'll tell you
[1:46:00] that far you you you do got that much
[1:46:02] right but it's not one with wings amen
[1:46:04] it's a man and and the reason I say it's
[1:46:06] a being coming from Heaven because
[1:46:09] actually we all we came from God and we
[1:46:13] going back to God so we come from heaven
[1:46:17] and we going back to
[1:46:18] heaven we just drop down for a span of
[1:46:22] time to to prove that this word is
[1:46:26] right oh my my my my but here here just
[1:46:31] just take this this scripture amen out
[1:46:34] of out of Galatians 4:14 this is Paul
[1:46:37] speaking and I and I I I've preached
[1:46:39] this before but sometimes it's good just
[1:46:41] to go back over it so to make sure that
[1:46:43] we get it it says and my
[1:46:45] Temptation which was in my flesh ye
[1:46:48] despise not so Paul had a problem with
[1:46:51] his eyes it says nor reject it but
[1:46:55] receive me as an angel of God even as
[1:47:01] Christ Jesus so here Paul say that
[1:47:03] people received him as an angel of God
[1:47:06] Amen and Paul was the messenger to the
[1:47:09] first church age he was the angel to the
[1:47:13] Church of
[1:47:16] Ephesus Revelation
[1:47:19] two all right I got to go forward so
[1:47:23] Revelation 18 tells us amen that an
[1:47:26] angel was coming down and he was going
[1:47:27] to have a his message was to call us out
[1:47:30] come out of her my people come out of
[1:47:32] that denominational system which was
[1:47:34] started by the Catholic church that's
[1:47:37] that that's the thing it's the Catholic
[1:47:39] church when you read Revelation 17 is
[1:47:41] it's the Catholic church that's
[1:47:42] identified but as I said this great
[1:47:46] had
[1:47:49] daughters
[1:47:51] harlots and who are the the harlots that
[1:47:54] the that the the gave birth to is
[1:47:57] the rest of the denominational churches
[1:48:00] now I I'mma just have to be honest with
[1:48:02] you it's the Baptist
[1:48:04] Church it's the Pentecostal church it's
[1:48:07] the Presbyterian Church it's the
[1:48:10] Episcopalian Church it's the Methodist
[1:48:13] Church any other of those denominations
[1:48:16] amen that got a denominational crown
[1:48:18] that they they they worshiping under
[1:48:20] that's what the that's what the the gave
[1:48:23] birth
[1:48:24] to praise God now let's go a little
[1:48:29] further I read this for you out of the
[1:48:31] first seal watch this watch this my God
[1:48:36] out of the first seal I read
[1:48:38] this it says um we've been warning him
[1:48:42] we got it to this
[1:48:43] nation it says uh notice he'll conquer
[1:48:46] the whole religious World he'll conquer
[1:48:50] make a covenant with Daniel's people now
[1:48:51] he's talking about the uh the pope and
[1:48:53] it's talking about the Catholic church
[1:48:55] now um and you all I know you all been
[1:48:59] keeping up with things we have a a pope
[1:49:02] that is
[1:49:03] eill amen and it's it's you know we
[1:49:06] don't know which way things are going to
[1:49:07] go but we do know something else that we
[1:49:11] had a prophet tell us that there could
[1:49:14] be a pope come up out of the United
[1:49:20] States and with the new leadership that
[1:49:22] we have
[1:49:24] uh we got to watch
[1:49:27] things that's all I can say argument in
[1:49:31] the white
[1:49:34] house probably the first time we had
[1:49:36] something well I I shouldn't say the
[1:49:37] first time because I know that uh kushev
[1:49:40] and and
[1:49:41] Eisenhower uh they got into it too I
[1:49:44] think kushev threw a shoe at
[1:49:48] Eisenhower praise God and and the
[1:49:50] prophet typed those things
[1:49:53] the prophet typed those things so when I
[1:49:54] mean I I I'm sorry I can't type all that
[1:49:57] but I know it's something significant
[1:49:58] about all these
[1:49:59] things praise God Amen I I believe the
[1:50:03] leader from Ukraine is of of of Jewish
[1:50:06] [Music]
[1:50:07] descent oo so we have to just watch a
[1:50:11] few things amen there's there there's a
[1:50:14] king of the north and brother random
[1:50:17] told us who that King of the North is
[1:50:19] Russia is the King of the
[1:50:21] North and and Russia will drop a a bomb
[1:50:24] on the Vatican that's what the prophet
[1:50:26] told us right so so we're watching all
[1:50:29] kind of stuff amen nothing nothing
[1:50:30] getting by us but uh but but you know
[1:50:33] I'm not so busy watching all that that I
[1:50:35] I also want to watch my life and make
[1:50:36] sure my life is right with God so I can
[1:50:38] be ready Amen to go when he cracks the
[1:50:42] sky let me read this amen uh first seal
[1:50:45] says uh now notice he'll conquer the
[1:50:47] whole religious World he'll conquer make
[1:50:50] a covenant with Daniel's people here it
[1:50:51] is both in the Gentile and in the Daniel
[1:50:54] people the Jews to the last week and we
[1:50:57] are and here we are even draw out on the
[1:51:00] boards and you see it perfectly there's
[1:51:03] where it is thank God there is that
[1:51:05] organization system is of the
[1:51:08] devil that's the that's that's
[1:51:10] denominational Church the organizational
[1:51:12] system is of the devil and that's no
[1:51:14] punches pulled on it either see it's
[1:51:17] exactly it's a root of the devil amen
[1:51:20] and now not people not people in there
[1:51:23] them are God's people when we speaking
[1:51:25] this we not speaking to the people we're
[1:51:27] not calling you the devil just like
[1:51:29] Jesus amen when he was uh on Earth and
[1:51:32] and and and and Peter come to him and
[1:51:35] and and rebuked him for some of the
[1:51:37] things he was saying Jesus told Satan
[1:51:39] Jesus said to Peter get thee behind me
[1:51:42] Satan now he wasn't calling Peter Satan
[1:51:46] he was just saying Satan is using you
[1:51:48] and you don't realize that that's a
[1:51:50] devil using you so I'm casting that
[1:51:52] devil lot of you amen we're not calling
[1:51:54] the people into Den denominational
[1:51:57] churches Devils why I was in the
[1:51:59] denominational Church glory to
[1:52:02] God you were there we weren't Devils we
[1:52:05] were Eagles in a in a chicken
[1:52:09] coup we just needed to hear the voice of
[1:52:12] the mother Eagle scream out and call us
[1:52:15] out of that condition and the mother
[1:52:17] eagle has scream come out of her my
[1:52:21] people we heard heard it and we came
[1:52:25] out that's why we here we heard
[1:52:29] something glory to God we heard the
[1:52:32] voice of God it's not brother Brandon's
[1:52:35] voice that we heard it was the voice of
[1:52:38] God coming from my
[1:52:40] background coming from my background
[1:52:43] brother Brandon's voice wouldn't have
[1:52:44] been able to get it done all right I'm
[1:52:46] just being honest from my background not
[1:52:50] just the man's voice see my background
[1:52:53] they sung their sermons that's right and
[1:52:55] when I played a tape I was listening hey
[1:52:58] when you going to wind this thing
[1:53:01] up was no wind
[1:53:04] ups was no organ playing in the
[1:53:07] background it was nobody yeah it was
[1:53:09] none of that and you you see you
[1:53:11] waitting oh you waiting on the
[1:53:15] show right but but but what we had to do
[1:53:17] is realize no this ain't no show this is
[1:53:19] a coming back to the word and when we
[1:53:21] come back to the word it you won't you
[1:53:23] won't see all that stuff going along
[1:53:25] with it oh hallelujah
[1:53:28] hallelujah but as we start listening to
[1:53:31] what he was saying like wait a minute
[1:53:33] wait a minute we ain't never heard
[1:53:34] things like this before in our life even
[1:53:37] even even in Sunday school they wouldn't
[1:53:39] teach Revelation and you go there to try
[1:53:41] to get into the deeper things of God
[1:53:44] hallelujah but I can come up come up
[1:53:46] here and take a scripture out of
[1:53:47] Revelation 14 and say this this has
[1:53:50] already been fulfilled and I'm going to
[1:53:52] prove it to you
[1:53:54] all right let me just keep
[1:53:56] going that organization systems of the
[1:53:59] devil that that's no punches pulled on
[1:54:00] it either it's exactly it's the root of
[1:54:02] the devil and now not people not people
[1:54:05] in there there them are God's people
[1:54:06] many of them but you know what when you
[1:54:08] get over here to uh to where we get in
[1:54:11] these trumpet sounding and the next time
[1:54:14] I come by these trumpet
[1:54:16] sounding you remember when the when them
[1:54:18] last angels that third Angel come across
[1:54:21] come out of her my people when that
[1:54:23] angel flies at the same time that
[1:54:26] message drops here for the last trumpet
[1:54:28] the last Angel's message not there's oh
[1:54:30] Lord there's there's a lot here you know
[1:54:34] oh Lord
[1:54:38] Jesus there are people still waiting for
[1:54:43] the trumpets to
[1:54:46] sound people in the
[1:54:49] message still waiting for the trumpets
[1:54:52] to sound but a prophet told
[1:54:56] us that all six trumpets sounded
[1:55:00] underneath the sick seal and it said
[1:55:03] they were all to the
[1:55:04] Jews and see so so here's the here's the
[1:55:07] here's the thing that we that that some
[1:55:09] of us missed some of us caught it but
[1:55:10] some of us missed it what God was doing
[1:55:13] was working a work in the Jews at the
[1:55:16] same time he was working a work in the
[1:55:18] Gentiles and there were certain things
[1:55:20] pertaining only to the Jews getting them
[1:55:23] ready for the seventh trumpet but the
[1:55:26] other six have already sounded when you
[1:55:28] go back and look at scripture brother
[1:55:30] random said that six trumpet sounded
[1:55:32] under ikan under Hitler that's what he
[1:55:36] told us that it sounded underneath those
[1:55:38] guys so if if if Hitler has already come
[1:55:41] and gone that is a past tense
[1:55:45] scripture Oh My My My but he says in
[1:55:49] between all this this is what he he says
[1:55:52] when that angel flies at the he says you
[1:55:55] remember when when them last angels that
[1:55:58] third Angel comes across come out of her
[1:56:01] my people that's that's Revelation 18:4
[1:56:03] he says the third Angel comes across
[1:56:05] come out of her my people when that
[1:56:07] angel flies at the same time that
[1:56:10] message drops for her drops here for
[1:56:13] that last trumpet last Angel's message
[1:56:16] last seal open all happens at the same
[1:56:19] time last trumpet last seal open last
[1:56:24] Angel's message everything happening
[1:56:31] simultaneously all right he says yes sir
[1:56:35] seals up goes over into eternity now
[1:56:38] let's pick up this now he and I just
[1:56:41] like how he say third
[1:56:43] Angel okay because when we read
[1:56:46] Revelation 14 it talked about Three
[1:56:50] Angels the first Angel did something
[1:56:53] second Angel did something and the third
[1:56:55] Angel did something now let us go a
[1:57:00] little further here mark of the beast
[1:57:03] and SE of God now I'm going tell you
[1:57:05] when when when
[1:57:08] I when I read this or when I heard this
[1:57:11] for the first time for me to help
[1:57:17] me understand my Bible when I don't have
[1:57:20] the quotes there to my side to be able
[1:57:22] to go back to I write little notes in my
[1:57:27] Bible that would give me a key to what I
[1:57:31] was
[1:57:32] reading so uh I'm giving you a little
[1:57:36] heads up it would be good for you to
[1:57:39] write a little note in your Bible to
[1:57:42] understand what the first Angel is what
[1:57:45] the second Angel is and what the third
[1:57:48] Angel is and if anybody ever come to you
[1:57:51] and want to have a Bible study about
[1:57:53] Revelation 14 you'll already have a
[1:57:55] little note in your Bible so you can
[1:57:57] explain a little something to
[1:57:59] them hello somebody now I'm getting
[1:58:03] ready to read to you the answer you want
[1:58:05] to be ready for the
[1:58:08] quiz here it is now out of the message

[1:58:13] God Part Two Brother R says this now you

[1:58:41] 6-12 that's the last three that's the
[1:58:45] the that's the the the the three Last
[1:58:47] Angels Three Angels after the the seven
[1:58:51] last Angels there were three special
[1:58:53] angels come forth did you notice that
[1:58:55] now now now I don't want y'all to be
[1:58:57] lost on this I'm going just I'm going
[1:58:59] have to explain this to you but I I'll
[1:59:01] read a little bit when you read about
[1:59:03] the seven Church
[1:59:05] ages Revelation 2 and Revelation 3 now
[1:59:09] Revelation 2 at the very end the theran
[1:59:12] church age the age goes into complete
[1:59:14] darkness and actually
[1:59:16] actually uh in history we actually have
[1:59:21] a period of history that we call the
[1:59:24] Dark
[1:59:25] Ages and those Dark Ages actually tie
[1:59:29] right into Revelation 2 to theran church
[1:59:32] age brother brandom connected what what
[1:59:35] what we've been teaching in history
[1:59:37] connects right with the scripture
[1:59:39] hallelujah amen but but when the church
[1:59:41] and and scripture says that they went
[1:59:43] into the depths of Satan during those
[1:59:45] Dark Ages Hallelujah but what happens in
[1:59:48] Revelation 3 light begins to come back
[1:59:51] in to the church and it starts in the
[1:59:54] ministry of Martin
[1:59:56] Luther glory to God oh
[2:00:01] my um Lord have mercy uh let me so let
[2:00:06] me just read the scripture here really
[2:00:08] quick so that that you you you might
[2:00:10] catch this out of the out of the Bible
[2:00:12] Revelation um uh
[2:00:20] 14:6 and I I saw another angel fly in
[2:00:23] the midst of Heaven having the
[2:00:25] Everlasting gospel to preach unto the uh
[2:00:28] unto them that dwell on the earth and to
[2:00:31] Every
[2:00:32] Nation
[2:00:35] um and to every nation and Kindred and
[2:00:37] tongue and people saying with a loud
[2:00:39] voice fear fear God and give give glory
[2:00:42] to him for the hour of his judgment has
[2:00:43] come and uh worship him that made Heaven
[2:00:47] and Earth and the Sea and the foundation
[2:00:50] uh and and and and and the foundation
[2:00:52] Fountains of waters now um I'm I'm I'm
[2:00:55] I'm I'm ahead of myself but to let you
[2:00:57] know that Ministry of the Everlasting
[2:01:00] gospel was the ministry of
[2:01:03] Luther and it connects to Revelation
[2:01:06] chapter 3 when Luther came coming out of
[2:01:09] the Dark Ages he came nailing 95 thesis
[2:01:12] to the church door and that's when light
[2:01:14] began to Spring forth and because Luther
[2:01:16] did what he did let me tell you
[2:01:18] something that's the reason we we're
[2:01:20] able to have the denomination churches
[2:01:21] the way we have today before then it was
[2:01:23] only Catholic or
[2:01:25] death but because Luther did what he did
[2:01:28] that's how they were able to get all the
[2:01:29] denominational churches however they got
[2:01:32] away from the word of God and we had to
[2:01:34] get back in
[2:01:35] Step oh my we thank God for what
[2:01:38] happened in Luther's day but there's
[2:01:40] more to it than that we thank God for
[2:01:42] what happened in Wesley's day but
[2:01:44] there's more to it than that now now now
[2:01:46] now I just I just gave you the first
[2:01:48] Angel was
[2:01:50] Luther who you think the second Angel
[2:01:52] going to
[2:01:53] be
[2:01:55] mhm and uh remember there was four death
[2:01:59] Messengers that took the life out of the
[2:02:01] church the palmerworm the cankerworm the
[2:02:03] Locust the caterpillar but there was
[2:02:05] four life Messengers that brought it
[2:02:06] back into the church and one was Luther
[2:02:09] the other was Wesley the third was the
[2:02:11] Pentecostals and the fourth was the word
[2:02:14] itself which came through a prophet
[2:02:17] William brandham let's go a little
[2:02:18] further let's go a little further in
[2:02:19] this quote amen you're already got the
[2:02:22] answers to your three Three Angels that
[2:02:24] are there so uh in that scripture um
[2:02:27] that's why it say it's already a past
[2:02:29] tense scripture Lu is already come
[2:02:31] Wesley's already come brother brandom's
[2:02:33] already come all of them are
[2:02:35] gone this is passed in scripture look at
[2:02:39] look at he says um that's the last three
[2:02:41] Angels these three angels and the and
[2:02:43] the Seven Last Angels there were three
[2:02:46] special angels come forth did you notice
[2:02:47] that now I I want you to notice them
[2:02:50] three Last Angels the first angel that's
[2:02:52] Revelation 146 to12 it says the first
[2:02:55] angel had sounded The Trumpet of the
[2:02:57] gospel and had the Everlasting gospel to
[2:03:00] preach to all the world and it says the
[2:03:02] second
[2:03:04] Angel kind of preached a Holiness
[2:03:07] gospel
[2:03:09] now um and brother brandom is spot on
[2:03:13] with this he spot on if if
[2:03:19] um I I'm a I'm a ver 8 I want to just
[2:03:22] catch uh um Revelation uh 14 and8 and I
[2:03:27] want you to just kind of see where where
[2:03:29] the Prophet brings these things watch
[2:03:31] this Revelation
[2:03:32] 148 there
[2:03:36] followed another Angel this is
[2:03:39] Wesley saying Babylon is Fallen is
[2:03:42] Fallen that great City because she made
[2:03:44] all nations drink of the wine of the
[2:03:48] wrath of her
[2:03:50] fornication now watch what the prophet
[2:03:53] does in tying that word fornication into
[2:03:57] Wesley's Ministry he said he preached a
[2:04:00] Holiness
[2:04:03] gospel cuz uh you know if you
[2:04:06] fornicating you ain't living
[2:04:09] holy right and if it's spiritual
[2:04:11] fornication it's not holy amen praise
[2:04:15] God so here brother Brandon watch watch
[2:04:17] what he does here now he says he says um
[2:04:20] uh the second angel cter preached a
[2:04:22] Holiness gospel because he said that the
[2:04:25] church had committed
[2:04:26] fornication and the third Angel roared
[2:04:30] out to escape the mark of the beast
[2:04:33] watch the first Angel at the Reformation
[2:04:36] Luther preached the gospel second Angel
[2:04:39] Wesley sanctification the fornication he
[2:04:43] straightened up of the church but the
[2:04:46] third message the Pentecostal message
[2:04:48] should be the true Messenger warning
[2:04:51] them to escape the mark of the beast
[2:04:53] saying whosoever receives the mark of
[2:04:55] the beast the same will drink the wrath
[2:04:57] of God poured out without mixtion to the
[2:04:59] cup of indignation be poured out upon
[2:05:02] the people that's the very look at that
[2:05:04] statement right there that's the very
[2:05:08] message
[2:05:10] today the third Angel the third message
[2:05:15] the last message the Lutheran message of
[2:05:19] justification the Wesley message of of
[2:05:22] sanctification and the Pentecostal
[2:05:24] message of the Seal of God Escape The
[2:05:26] Mark of the Beast come out of them big
[2:05:28] walls of Babylon be sealed into the
[2:05:32] kingdom of God what I want you to
[2:05:35] understand is that this scripture is
[2:05:36] being fulfilled by Brother bram's
[2:05:39] Ministry I'm giving you scriptures to
[2:05:41] show you how God identified where this
[2:05:43] ministry what it would do amen and when
[2:05:46] it would come
[2:05:47] forth brother bram's Ministries identify
[2:05:50] as the third Ang angel of Revelation
[2:05:57] 14 we got the first M the first Angel
[2:06:00] was Luther the second one was Wesley the
[2:06:04] third is William brandom and look how he
[2:06:08] tied the Pentecostals in with that now
[2:06:10] remember when brother Brandon was born
[2:06:12] the Pentecostal Revival amen was just
[2:06:15] kind of coming to an end but God was
[2:06:18] raising up a prophet with the word to
[2:06:20] bring the people back to the word what
[2:06:21] what happened with Pentecost that we
[2:06:23] thank God for the gifts that was part of
[2:06:25] the the life that came back into the
[2:06:26] church we we we we received that with
[2:06:29] everything we got but you know listening
[2:06:32] to a tape this week what what
[2:06:36] happened is
[2:06:38] um the church has been going through a
[2:06:41] stage of
[2:06:43] maturity you see and and see it's just
[2:06:46] like a child I one of the children this
[2:06:48] morning I was sitting there in the back
[2:06:49] and when one of the children come in
[2:06:51] here and Bo they just got they was
[2:06:52] excited back there they was I don't know
[2:06:54] who it was but they was pretty excited
[2:06:56] they was they was they was ready to talk
[2:06:58] and said this is how the Pentecostal did
[2:07:01] they didn't know when to talk they were
[2:07:04] like little children right and and they
[2:07:06] didn't they didn't know when to talk
[2:07:07] they just get so excited about the
[2:07:09] presence of the Lord they just let it
[2:07:11] fly whenever the pastor could be behind
[2:07:14] the pull pit preaching but because they
[2:07:16] so excited they just let it
[2:07:19] fly now now now now now when that little
[2:07:21] child is doing that just letting it fly
[2:07:24] the Deacon's not going to go tap that
[2:07:26] little child on the shoulder hey little
[2:07:29] Johnny you going to have to hush the
[2:07:31] pastor's preaching no they just they If
[2:07:34] the child get too unruly they just take
[2:07:36] it to another room have the mama take it
[2:07:38] to another they don't rebuke the
[2:07:43] child they don't un christianize the
[2:07:48] child praise the Lord but but but they
[2:07:51] realize is just a child now as this
[2:07:54] child develops as the child gets older
[2:07:58] then there's a another set of
[2:08:01] expectations that is set on the child
[2:08:04] amen and and as they get older you ought
[2:08:06] to be old enough now where you can sit
[2:08:08] there and hear the word of God and don't
[2:08:11] blurt out unless you're blurting out an
[2:08:13] amen right don't interrupt the the
[2:08:15] preaching don't do this and and and and
[2:08:18] and and and just based on maturity level
[2:08:20] you you understand that amen that that
[2:08:22] the child is expected to act a certain
[2:08:25] way and this is what has happened to the
[2:08:27] church amen not that we re rejecting the
[2:08:30] gifts but now they''re been operated
[2:08:32] with
[2:08:37] maturity it it won't be no disrupting
[2:08:40] the
[2:08:41] preacher no no no no no no no we don't
[2:08:44] learn more than
[2:08:45] that it won't be the I mean yeah the
[2:08:48] gifts are welcome but it won't be to
[2:08:49] disrupt the preacher no because the the
[2:08:52] the the the the the the the the the uh
[2:08:54] the spirit of the prophets is subject to
[2:08:56] the prophets Hallelujah we understand
[2:09:00] what Paul was
[2:09:02] writing see so brother brandham told us
[2:09:05] that said all all we're seeing now is
[2:09:07] it's simply a maturity of that so so
[2:09:10] when when when when things are happen
[2:09:12] when when things are happen kind of
[2:09:13] underneath this level of maturity then
[2:09:17] it just happens differently but it's
[2:09:19] just as precious as it was it's and it's
[2:09:21] not it's not um let me put it off so
[2:09:24] it's not the amount of tongues that go
[2:09:27] forth we're not here trying
[2:09:30] to we not it's not a race it's not you
[2:09:34] know this not this not uh uh what what
[2:09:37] what what we're doing here is just just
[2:09:38] operating the way God has actually
[2:09:40] called us as a church to operate so you
[2:09:42] know what sometime in in in being a
[2:09:44] mature Christian oh Lord help me Jesus
[2:09:47] being a mature Christian you even
[2:09:50] understand where you come to church
[2:09:52] every service not going to be a jumping
[2:09:55] up and down
[2:09:59] service you don't have to jump up and
[2:10:01] down to know whether you done receive
[2:10:03] the word or
[2:10:05] not you ain't got to do all of that to
[2:10:07] know whether the word went forth or not
[2:10:09] every service not going to be you know
[2:10:11] like like that so so so so sometimes in
[2:10:13] the Pentecost Church boy they work that
[2:10:15] thing
[2:10:16] up they work that thing up to make sure
[2:10:19] that we have the same experience that we
[2:10:21] had yesterday no we don't have to do it
[2:10:24] that way glory to God when he comes he
[2:10:29] comes and we welcome him whenever he
[2:10:32] comes and and here's the other thing
[2:10:34] that we know amen just because the gifts
[2:10:36] didn't go forth in one service don't
[2:10:38] mean the gifts are
[2:10:40] gone the gifts are still
[2:10:44] here the gifts are still here but they
[2:10:47] might not operate all the time and it's
[2:10:50] that's okay
[2:10:51] hey glory to God we're not going to
[2:10:54] manufacture nothing here but we know we
[2:10:58] stand with the word of God oh my my my I
[2:11:02] I'm I'm glad that I can look in at this
[2:11:04] word I can pick up Revelation 16 and
[2:11:08] when it talk about the first Angel oh
[2:11:10] that that's the message of Luther and
[2:11:13] when you go back to I had it right here
[2:11:15] let me let me um give me Revelation uh
[2:11:17] 31 Revelation 3:7 Revelation 3:14 these
[2:11:21] are the three angels that that were
[2:11:24] spoken of here in
[2:11:26] Revelation um 14 look at
[2:11:31] this the very first verse Revelation
[2:11:33] three this is Martin Luther it says and
[2:11:37] unto the angel of the church another man
[2:11:41] a man Angel not not not not not not
[2:11:44] somebody coming down not a being coming
[2:11:46] down with wings no a man that God sends
[2:11:49] to the Earth with the the word of the
[2:11:52] Lord and you know his job is I'm going
[2:11:55] tell you specifically why this man was
[2:11:57] sent I'mma tell you it was to help the
[2:12:00] people of that
[2:12:01] day get back and
[2:12:07] step Revelation I mean Revelation 3:1
[2:12:10] and unto the angel of the church and
[2:12:12] Sardis write these things sayith he that
[2:12:15] ha the seven spirits of God and the
[2:12:17] Seven Stars I Know Thy works that thou
[2:12:20] Hast a name that thou livest and art
[2:12:23] dead now and that's just so important
[2:12:26] because when when the reason that it
[2:12:28] said that that they had a name that that
[2:12:30] that said that they live is because
[2:12:31] Luther broke away from the Catholic
[2:12:33] church and the Lutheran formed not
[2:12:35] Luther didn't form it but the people
[2:12:37] that followed Luther formed that and the
[2:12:39] Lutheran form which which which gave
[2:12:41] birth to so many other denominations
[2:12:44] praise God and and all I could say there
[2:12:46] was a freedom to get away from the
[2:12:47] Catholic we thank God for that part but
[2:12:50] we the reason that says that they they
[2:12:52] had a name that they live is but are
[2:12:53] dead is because they went right back
[2:12:54] into the same system of things and when
[2:12:58] they go back into the same system of
[2:12:59] things God leaves
[2:13:03] it
[2:13:05] Hallelujah Revelation 3:7 here's the
[2:13:08] second angel with that Holiness gospel
[2:13:11] look at him this is John Wesley
[2:13:14] Revelation 3:7 and it says and to the
[2:13:17] angel of the church in Philadelphia
[2:13:20] write
[2:13:22] these things say he that is Holy now now
[2:13:26] look at that remember brother brand said
[2:13:28] he had a
[2:13:30] Holiness
[2:13:32] gospel look at look at what what what it
[2:13:34] said about about Wesley and and look at
[2:13:37] look how God how Jesus describes himself
[2:13:39] to this messenger he that is Holy
[2:13:43] Holiness gospel my God he that is true
[2:13:48] he that hath the Key of David he that
[2:13:51] openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth
[2:13:55] and no man
[2:13:57] openeth that's the second angel that we
[2:14:00] found there in Revelation 14 but the
[2:14:03] third Angel is found in Revelation 10:7
[2:14:06] look at the connection of the scriptures
[2:14:08] I can just tell you right now a um a
[2:14:12] theologian a
[2:14:14] theologian can't make these
[2:14:16] connections but a prophet
[2:14:21] that's why I said you could take what a
[2:14:23] theologian said or you can take what a
[2:14:25] prophet said a prophet makes these
[2:14:27] connections look at this the lab look at
[2:14:29] this uh Revelation 3:14 this third Angel
[2:14:32] and unto the angel of the Church of the
[2:14:35] leans write these things saith the
[2:14:40] amen the faithful and true witness the
[2:14:44] beginning of the creation of
[2:14:47] God this Revelation 3:14 angel is
[2:14:51] connected and tied into a revelation 107
[2:14:57] Angel they actually are the same Angel
[2:15:00] so let me read you Revelation 10:7 again
[2:15:03] I know you all are familiar with it but
[2:15:04] there somebody else that is unfamiliar
[2:15:06] and and I like going through this
[2:15:08] because we people know that we just not
[2:15:09] here uh just to be here but the word of
[2:15:13] God is what called us to this
[2:15:15] place amen Revelation 10:7 tells us this
[2:15:19] but in the day
[2:15:22] of the
[2:15:23] voice of the seventh angel that's the
[2:15:26] angel of Revelation 3:14 the seventh
[2:15:29] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[2:15:33] mystery of God should be finished as he
[2:15:37] have declared to his servants the
[2:15:39] prophets we are preaching from an open
[2:15:43] book because God has revealed these
[2:15:46] secrets to us through his Prophet we
[2:15:48] willing to receive that Prophet that's
[2:15:50] why we can take Revelation 14 and tell
[2:15:53] you it's past
[2:15:56] tense all right I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm
[2:15:59] I'm I'm I'm I think I'm done but let me
[2:16:02] uh I I I was
[2:16:06] reading oh oh um could I have mark of
[2:16:10] the beast um the mark of the beast the
[2:16:12] quote out of the mark of the beast now
[2:16:15] and let me just read this now and I'll
[2:16:17] I'll finish right here
[2:16:19] um other thing that I I want to make
[2:16:22] mention of so so I'm I'm reading from a
[2:16:25] sermon the mark of the beast and um
[2:16:29] everybody's so
[2:16:30] concerned about a chip in the
[2:16:34] hand or
[2:16:37] uh you know something in your forehead
[2:16:39] and they're G to scan you they G to scan
[2:16:42] you they G to scan you they got to chip
[2:16:44] in your body they're gonna scan you and
[2:16:46] get on don't don't you take that Mark of
[2:16:47] the Beast and and people just so afraid
[2:16:50] just fear fear fear fear fear it's not a
[2:16:53] tattoo in your head it's not a tattoo on
[2:16:57] your hand the mark of the beast is not a
[2:17:01] chip in your
[2:17:04] hand they they may need to do that I I
[2:17:07] you know they you got chips in your
[2:17:10] wallet right now on your on your uh your
[2:17:13] your credit card your debit card those
[2:17:15] are chips right now and and look when
[2:17:17] you go to that machine and you tap with
[2:17:19] that chip they know everything
[2:17:21] they got all your information and you're
[2:17:23] going to have to use that in order to
[2:17:25] buy buy grocery praise God some places
[2:17:28] won't even take cash no more and the
[2:17:30] reason that the reason a lot of that
[2:17:32] happen because of the crime high crime
[2:17:35] but folk don't want to have cash because
[2:17:36] they don't want to be robbed right so so
[2:17:38] so uh don't be afraid of little things
[2:17:41] like that that come out I can tell you
[2:17:43] right now and I don't have time to get
[2:17:44] all into this day but the mark of the
[2:17:47] beast is actually rejecting
[2:17:53] the mark of the beast and I'm going to
[2:17:55] go a little further I'm going go a
[2:17:57] little further because I it it's going
[2:17:59] to it's going to help somebody it's not
[2:18:01] just rejecting the word of God you got a
[2:18:03] lot of Sinners out there that did
[2:18:05] that and and they they they you know
[2:18:08] that they don't believe God you got
[2:18:10] people call themselves atheists they
[2:18:12] don't believe it's not it's not just
[2:18:14] rejecting the word of God that's the
[2:18:15] mark of the
[2:18:16] beast the mark of the beast is a
[2:18:18] religious mark
[2:18:21] so with it being a religious Mark the
[2:18:23] mark of the beast is
[2:18:26] rejecting the
[2:18:31] reveal word of God for your
[2:18:39] day I'm going tell you somebody in the
[2:18:41] Bible that that had the mark of the
[2:18:43] beast and didn't even realize it the
[2:18:46] Rich Young Ruler
[2:18:52] because he had an opportunity to receive
[2:18:54] the word he was in the presence of the
[2:18:59] word he was standing talking to the
[2:19:03] word and when he stood there talking to
[2:19:06] the word the the word told him sell
[2:19:11] everything you have and then come and
[2:19:15] follow me can I tell y'all what the word
[2:19:17] said today come out of my people
[2:19:22] and then come and follow me
[2:19:25] Hallelujah when when when when the Rich
[2:19:27] Young Ruler walked away from the word
[2:19:30] that day the Rich Young Ruler accepted
[2:19:33] the mark of the
[2:19:36] beast and we found out later on in
[2:19:39] Scripture that he lifted up his
[2:19:42] eyes in
[2:19:44] Hell oo Lord
[2:19:47] oo let me just try to read this one
[2:19:50] quote and I'm I'mma Be I'mma Be Done
[2:19:52] mark of the beast watch
[2:19:54] this so now this is the third Angel's
[2:19:57] message to the
[2:19:59] world and you know what the third
[2:20:01] Angel's message is going forth now in
[2:20:05] this
[2:20:08] day Revelation 14 has been
[2:20:11] fulfilled he says this is the
[2:20:16] flying of the third Angel message if
[2:20:21] you're a Bible reader there was three
[2:20:22] Wes follow it the first one happened in
[2:20:25] World War I second one happened in World
[2:20:27] War II and look at what the prophet say
[2:20:31] you
[2:20:33] see what we're going in
[2:20:36] now so the woes happened that triggered
[2:20:40] a World
[2:20:42] War and we having problems in the White
[2:20:46] House big
[2:20:48] problems big problems
[2:20:51] I Lord have mercy I I know if I say
[2:20:55] things like this I might get my my we
[2:20:57] might get our uh license revoked and
[2:21:00] don't say things about and now now now
[2:21:02] when they tell us that we can't say
[2:21:03] certain things then we we've lost some
[2:21:06] freedoms haven't
[2:21:09] we weren't we supposed to have some
[2:21:11] freedoms to that we can say certain
[2:21:14] things what what's some freedoms y'all
[2:21:16] tell
[2:21:17] me freedom of speech what right I mean
[2:21:21] didn't we didn't we create a a
[2:21:23] constitution that say we had these
[2:21:24] things and now they want to be taken
[2:21:26] away because somebody calls out the
[2:21:29] fallacies right but but when you see
[2:21:31] that I mean how you going to tell a man
[2:21:33] that got that's having his his country
[2:21:39] invaded oh Lord help us Jesus how you
[2:21:42] going to tell that man that he he he you
[2:21:44] know something wrong with him my country
[2:21:47] is being invaded my friend these guys
[2:21:50] just come out out of nowhere trying to
[2:21:51] take over my country what would you do
[2:21:55] if if they showed up at your at your
[2:21:57] Country Door trying to take over your
[2:22:01] country man said no I'm not going down
[2:22:03] like that man say he ain't going to be
[2:22:07] bullied and and if y'all w't fight with
[2:22:09] fight with me I I find somebody else to
[2:22:11] fight with me all right but but here the
[2:22:14] prophet tells us these things he says
[2:22:17] you see what's going in now it says all
[2:22:21] right we're at the end of the road now
[2:22:23] let's get this on our mind just before
[2:22:25] we read the scripture position we are
[2:22:26] bound to be at the End of the Age how
[2:22:28] long I don't know no one does and and so
[2:22:31] here's the thing when um when we see all
[2:22:34] these signs of the time Church uh it's
[2:22:37] very important for us to understand by
[2:22:39] scripture what God has done in this hour
[2:22:43] it's because look God ain't going to do
[2:22:45] nothing outside of the word he's not
[2:22:47] going to do it he it was this this word
[2:22:49] was written for any of us in here was
[2:22:51] born this word was already here so these
[2:22:54] things was already laid out the the the
[2:22:56] beautiful part about this is God has
[2:22:58] given us the privilege to see the
[2:23:00] manifestation Hallelujah of these
[2:23:02] scriptures with our own eyes we ought to
[2:23:06] thank God for that we we are we ought to
[2:23:08] serve God for that we ought to worship
[2:23:10] God Amen with everything we got knowing
[2:23:12] what God has done for us ain't nothing
[2:23:14] but the grace of God that has been given
[2:23:16] to us we can we can we can walk without
[2:23:20] fear here we can we can hold our heads
[2:23:22] up high we know uh scriptures told us
[2:23:25] that you know look up because our
[2:23:28] Redemption is drawing nigh and um uh I'm
[2:23:32] one that I I feel like there is one more
[2:23:35] Vision uh that we waiting to be
[2:23:38] fulfilled seven Visions before the
[2:23:40] coming of the Lord God gave it to the
[2:23:41] prophet in 1933 there's just one more
[2:23:43] waiting to be fulfilled and as that one
[2:23:45] is being fulfilled I'm praying that
[2:23:48] there's an exit at the same time time of
[2:23:51] the
[2:23:53] Fulfillment praise God You Know Before
[2:23:55] Destruction struck Sodom lot and his
[2:23:59] family were
[2:24:02] out and and and they could they could
[2:24:05] actually they were told not to look back
[2:24:07] his wife did but they could hear what
[2:24:10] was going on back there but they weren't
[2:24:12] in there and as we
[2:24:16] accident might hear some explosions but
[2:24:19] we won't be here
[2:24:21] we'll be on our way out church that's
[2:24:23] what I'm looking forward to amen I've
[2:24:26] I've given you some scriptures I got
[2:24:27] more I got more coming but we we we
[2:24:30] receive the
[2:24:32] Advent of the Prophet messenger and the
[2:24:35] reason we receive it is because we can
[2:24:37] see it in
[2:24:39] the
[2:24:42] scriptures God bless you

[2:25:17] of years ago in the days of
[2:25:19] Luther the the days of Wesley we can see
[2:25:22] how you manifested yourself and how you
[2:25:24] use those Ministries but we also see how

[2:25:29] helped us to be able to see these
[2:25:31] things God it's not uh happen stance
[2:25:34] it's not by chance
[2:25:37] it's that's not some uh it's not a cult

[2:25:44] return to
[2:25:46] truth it's getting back in step and Lord
[2:25:50] we see it is very clear here in the word
[2:25:53] sometimes it's been
[2:25:54] misrepresented but God it's it's still
[2:25:56] true and Lord we pray that you would
