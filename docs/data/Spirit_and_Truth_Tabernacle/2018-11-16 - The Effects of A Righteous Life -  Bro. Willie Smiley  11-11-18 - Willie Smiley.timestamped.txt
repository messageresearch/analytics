[48:22] trust that folks didn't come to see a
[48:24] man to hear from a man we created to
[48:27] take control of human instrumentality
[48:31] and say something that'll be edified
[48:33] this morning and we'll be so careful to

[48:53] Tabernacle I'm gonna be looking in the
[48:55] book of Philippians this morning just
[48:58] remember your pastor brother Jack and
[49:01] all of the saints that went out to
[49:03] Arizona
[49:04] we had the invite but things didn't work
[49:06] out for us to go so he asked me what I
[49:09] fill in and I'm always grateful for the
[49:12] opportunity to be able to come and to
[49:14] try to share something that will be
[49:16] edifying to this portion of the body of
[49:19] Jesus Christ let's pray for Outlook

[49:28] always enjoy my my time of fellowship
[49:31] with you all and it's just good to see
[49:32] all of the smiling faces y'all are
[49:36] smiling our child a man is always good
[49:40] to see my friend in the back brother
[49:41] Guerin I don't think he was here the
[49:43] last time I came but God made a way he's
[49:48] always on our heart you know I like that
[49:51] song better son it's just a mountain
[49:54] that's it's all it is I think I think
[49:58] what happens is we fail to realize who
[50:02] we are a lot of times and and what's
[50:04] been given you know one of the things I
[50:07] like the property talks about Jesus
[50:10] Christ being a master of circumstances
[50:12] one day we're gonna learn how to master
[50:14] our circumstances by the word until then
[50:17] we're gonna be constantly up and down
[50:20] and and defeated but one day we're gonna
[50:23] get a complete revelation of who we
[50:25] actually are in Christ Jesus and what's
[50:30] been given to us right until then we're
[50:34] gonna be up and down we're gonna be a
[50:36] yo-yo
[50:41] but once we learn who we are we're going
[50:43] to stop all of that and I'm not worried
[50:45] is that right let us let us look in the
[50:48] scriptures this morning we we want to
[50:53] start at the first verse Philippians
[50:54] chapter 1 it says Paul and Timothy is
[50:59] the servant of Jesus Christ to all the
[51:02] Saints in Christ Jesus which are at
[51:04] Philippi with the bishops and deacons
[51:07] grace be unto you and peace from God our
[51:11] Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ I
[51:13] thank my god upon every remembrance of
[51:16] you always in every prayer of mine for
[51:19] you all making requests with joy for
[51:22] your fellowship in the gospel from the
[51:25] first day until now being confident of
[51:28] this very thing that he which has begun
[51:31] a good work in you will perform it until
[51:33] the day of Jesus Christ even at is his
[51:36] meat for me to think this of you all
[51:39] because I have you in my heart it in as
[51:43] much as both in my bonds and in the
[51:46] defence and confirmation of the gospel
[51:49] ye all are partakers of my grace for God
[51:52] is my record how greatly I longed after
[51:55] you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ
[51:57] and this I pray that you'll love me
[52:00] about yet more and more in knowledge and
[52:03] in all judgment that ye may approve
[52:05] things that are excellent that ye may be
[52:07] sincere with our offense til the day of
[52:11] Christ being filled with the the fruits
[52:13] of righteousness which are by Jesus
[52:16] Christ to the glory and praise of God
[52:19] but I would that you should understand
[52:22] Berlin that the things which happen unto
[52:25] me have fallen out rather until the
[52:30] furtherance of the gospel so that my
[52:32] bonds in Christ are manifested in all
[52:35] the palace and in all in all other
[52:39] places and many of the Brethren in the
[52:43] law of West and confidence by my barns
[52:46] are much more bold to speak the words
[52:49] without fear so indeed preach Christ
[52:54] some indeed preach Christ even of envy
[52:57] and strife and some also a goodwill made
[53:02] a lord out of blessing to the reading of
[53:04] his word this morning you may be seated
[53:10] we want to use as a topic a topic the
[53:15] effects of a righteous life and as a
[53:20] context the response of the current
[53:23] Christian life one of the things we we
[53:27] realize true Christianity is based upon
[53:32] more than just being excited it's it's
[53:36] it's you know people think that their
[53:40] Christian because they run around church
[53:43] and that you know they feel goose bumps
[53:47] and things of that nature but first and
[53:51] foremost is something that you can't get
[53:53] away from you must be born again is that
[53:57] right
[53:58] I think the new birth is the foundation
[54:00] of the pyramid is that right you've got
[54:03] to be be born again you you can't
[54:06] venture up with first without being born
[54:09] again amen I believe that you know it
[54:18] character character is a big part of
[54:21] this thing and I think sometimes we we
[54:23] fail we we approach Christianity I think
[54:28] a lot of times but we approach it by a
[54:31] lack of understanding
[54:32] I think the manifestation of the
[54:36] character of Jesus Christ is is the
[54:41] important thing for me is that right I
[54:44] enjoy being excited y'all know me I like
[54:49] the worship I like to praise God every
[54:51] now and then I even like the shower but
[54:54] but I realize you know it's something
[54:57] that's that's beyond that because we've
[55:00] seen that we've seen people excited and
[55:02] we've seen people run around the church
[55:05] and things of that nature
[55:07] and then we've seen people totally
[55:09] disappear right y'all come on without
[55:13] Church with me we've seen people totally
[55:15] disappear we've heard people say well I
[55:18] believe God Center proper things of that
[55:21] nature and then you know the whole
[55:25] confession begins to change and this is
[55:29] why Jesus said it's so important that a
[55:32] person is born again said verily verily
[55:34] you must you must be born again and it's
[55:39] it's not it's not anything that you
[55:41] could get around it's something that
[55:43] that must take place that's there's got
[55:46] to be a change that that takes place in
[55:49] you because without that you'll never be
[55:52] able to understand the kingdom of God
[55:54] you'll never really understand the Word
[55:57] of God youyou might have some
[56:00] intellectual conception you might by
[56:02] being smart can read and understand
[56:05] maybe the you know be able to quote back
[56:08] but you'll never really be able to
[56:10] understand amen the things of God
[56:13] without being born again so you know
[56:16] that that's important for the Church of
[56:18] the Living God I think that that's
[56:20] that's a part of Christendom that we
[56:24] could never get away from you must be
[56:26] born again every individual no matter
[56:29] how good you look how good you smell
[56:30] this morning you got to be born again
[56:34] yeah a lot of priests with me this
[56:36] morning you you you can't get around
[56:39] right everything hinges on your new
[56:43] birth experience we don't go somewhere
[56:45] I'm not gonna bother y'all too much this
[56:47] morning but I'm just trying to get the
[56:50] itself out of the way so the Holy Ghost
[56:52] can do some winning this morning but but
[56:55] it's important from the youngest to the
[56:57] oldest you go nowhere without being born
[56:59] again it takes it takes the life of
[57:03] Christ right amen it takes the life of
[57:08] Christ see it's you know I realize
[57:12] something it's just not me it's it's the
[57:15] working of Christ in me
[57:19] pricing you the hope of glory is that
[57:21] right
[57:22] amen because if it's me boy I do some
[57:25] crazy stuff if it's me I'll say some
[57:29] crazy things right if it's if it's just
[57:33] me my emotions are you know up and down
[57:37] but but it's Christ in the church right
[57:41] the acts of the Holy Spirit wasn't just
[57:44] a group of men right and it was Christ
[57:48] in the church operating through men and
[57:52] that's what it's got to be a man in the
[57:55] hour that we live in is that right it's
[57:57] Christ in the church doing the work
[58:00] right
[58:01] living the life see that when that
[58:06] revelation breaks it does away with our
[58:08] struggle right because we think that we
[58:11] we gotta be good and we gotta be no you
[58:15] get the life of Christ and Christ of
[58:19] maturing you and the things that you
[58:23] thought were not possible will be
[58:25] possible the things that you thought you
[58:28] wouldn't be able to overcome you'll find
[58:30] yourself overcoming see people struggle
[58:34] to try to try to make themselves a
[58:37] Christian you you are Christian in the
[58:42] life of Christ we know we know brother
[58:45] branham taught on on on on the
[58:48] progression the three stages right but
[58:52] you don't want to stop at justification
[58:55] and sanctification you want to go all
[58:57] the way into Christ so many people
[59:01] stopped short where I believe Jesus you
[59:06] just justified you need to be sanctified
[59:10] and feel right and then amen
[59:14] grow up in God grew up in God find your
[59:20] place right in Christ
[59:24] hip-hip all Paul
[59:30] was was was right into the Philippians
[59:34] Church and I you know I do things a
[59:38] little bit differently God builds a
[59:40] minister and we all ain't the same and I
[59:43] trust that y'all don't think that I'm
[59:45] gonna preach like brother Jack that's my
[59:47] brother-in-law but I'm different I look
[59:51] different I'm tall he's short I'm being
[59:54] here's a little small and we see things
[1:00:00] just a little bit differently and and
[1:00:04] you know we sometimes I find people
[1:00:05] people we want to put everybody in the
[1:00:08] box
[1:00:08] and and we want to clone everybody to a
[1:00:12] certain individual I often tell my
[1:00:14] church that looked at would be messed up
[1:00:17] if everybody around the world was a
[1:00:20] brother smiling lord have mercy
[1:00:23] did your man you you get tired of me
[1:00:26] everywhere you look every man that came
[1:00:29] to the pulpit dressed like me act like
[1:00:32] me lord help her mercy we you know glory
[1:00:38] to God but but God has a Gaza God of
[1:00:42] variety I thank God for that diversity
[1:00:45] right but Paul what Paul here he says I
[1:00:53] thank my god upon every remembrance of
[1:00:56] you now now we know Paul Paul and Silas
[1:01:01] had had this great experience in the
[1:01:06] Philippian jail jail they had a revival
[1:01:10] you know that you don't think they were
[1:01:14] they had circumstances surrounding them
[1:01:18] they were in jail and and and this face
[1:01:21] with with nobody wants to go to jail you
[1:01:24] ever been to jail you know you'll never
[1:01:26] want to go back if you and your right
[1:01:28] mind you know I did a few days in the
[1:01:32] bygone days and I realize that's no
[1:01:35] place that I ever ever never never never
[1:01:38] ever want to go back to but you know
[1:01:42] even even in the midst of that Paul Paul
[1:01:45] found themselves in this place because
[1:01:47] of the gospel sinks is that right not
[1:01:51] not because he was a bad individual he
[1:01:54] was robbing us stealing but but for the
[1:01:57] sake of the gospel but I like Paul's
[1:02:01] mindset Paul had a revelation that you
[1:02:04] know he was commissioned by God to take
[1:02:08] the word to the Gentile church and and
[1:02:12] and you know the the mysteries was given
[1:02:15] we know he was the messenger of the
[1:02:18] aides and things of that nature and and
[1:02:20] you know the message was taking them
[1:02:23] against the grain it takes you against
[1:02:26] the theology of the day and and this is
[1:02:29] a lot of reason why we have backlash a
[1:02:31] lot of times right amen because it's
[1:02:37] it's against the grain when everything
[1:02:40] else is going one way the Word of God
[1:02:42] that's been given in this hour it's
[1:02:45] taken us in a total different direction
[1:02:47] is that right
[1:02:49] amen and I appreciate that because what
[1:02:53] it has done for me it has opened up my
[1:02:55] understanding to things that you know I
[1:02:57] probably would not understand if I was
[1:03:01] in any nominal Church right Amen because
[1:03:06] what we gotta we gotta understand it's
[1:03:09] given us wrapped in faith and rapture
[1:03:11] and grace right it's ensured us things
[1:03:14] that we really would not understand
[1:03:18] outside of coming in contact with the
[1:03:20] seventh danger is that right amen and he
[1:03:25] said I preached what Paul preached is
[1:03:27] that right amen and and so you know Paul
[1:03:31] here we find Paul was in prison and and
[1:03:35] you know I like most people when when we
[1:03:39] face wit with with circumstances the
[1:03:43] first thing we start doing is
[1:03:44] complaining and belly aching and pulled
[1:03:47] me and whine me huh if anybody had a
[1:03:52] reason to feel sorry for themselves it
[1:03:55] should
[1:03:56] than Paul but you know what Paul did in
[1:03:59] the midst of adversity he started
[1:04:02] singing huh he started right look it is
[1:04:08] what it is and he realized we're here
[1:04:13] amen
[1:04:14] you know what God read one thing we
[1:04:16] don't we get into a little stupor but we
[1:04:20] fail to realize God allows us to go
[1:04:22] through things for the sake of the
[1:04:24] gospel right God knew that amen
[1:04:29] it was needful for Paul and Silas to be
[1:04:32] in prison because he had a predestinated
[1:04:34] cease there huh y'all are the priest
[1:04:38] with me this morning Paul got cut Paul
[1:04:41] got to Paul got the singing and
[1:04:44] worshipping and boy it calls it caused
[1:04:47] the prison walls to begin to shake a man
[1:04:52] the prison doors begin to come open men
[1:04:56] begin to a man be set free and I believe
[1:05:00] that was set free not just naturally but
[1:05:02] spiritually God God was showing himself
[1:05:06] mighty in the midst of paul and silas's
[1:05:10] life amen man could've Ramapo sigh wait
[1:05:13] a minute don't y'all go anywhere don't
[1:05:16] you go anywhere
[1:05:17] I could could you imagine being in the
[1:05:19] jail right having to keep all these folk
[1:05:23] and now here he is they free that's
[1:05:26] enough to change a man's heart
[1:05:30] hallelujah I said nothing
[1:05:32] oh my god I'm gonna lose my life but but
[1:05:36] not not realizing you know
[1:05:39] predestination is a powerful turn the
[1:05:42] Prophet says it's not skim milk right
[1:05:46] it's not skim milk even doing doing his
[1:05:49] time than even if you study even some of
[1:05:52] the commentary ins when they talk about
[1:05:56] predestination in the book of Ephesians
[1:05:58] they have the same mind that even the
[1:06:00] Prophet had right how profound the book
[1:06:04] of Ephesians is and how really profound
[1:06:08] buried
[1:06:09] destinated really is right to think that
[1:06:13] God before the foundation of the world
[1:06:15] could could look at you and know right
[1:06:20] no see we ain't here by chance
[1:06:25] right we're not here this morning by
[1:06:27] chance right you're not believing Amen
[1:06:31] this message my chance this is the
[1:06:35] foreknowledge of God you're on God
[1:06:39] foreknew you in this age knew you would
[1:06:43] be here this time knew that I would be
[1:06:45] hearing this time even when I was messed
[1:06:47] up on the streets even when I was messed
[1:06:51] up on drugs and crack and all that God
[1:06:55] predestinated me to be here right no no
[1:07:01] even even before I you know even thought
[1:07:04] about preaching all I wanted to do is
[1:07:06] get myself straight God God had a
[1:07:10] greater plan for my life right
[1:07:14] hallelujah you know God had a plan and a
[1:07:17] purpose for a Lowenthal to go behind the
[1:07:20] prison walls right amen because of it
[1:07:24] folk got converted right they saw they
[1:07:29] saw not a man see we get we get we
[1:07:32] messed up sometimes we get so caught up
[1:07:35] looking at a man and their personality
[1:07:38] we make men great and the greatest man
[1:07:44] that ever walked the earth that came up
[1:07:47] to him and said good master
[1:07:52] there's nothing good about me only thing
[1:07:56] good is in the Father and that's the
[1:07:59] same way I feel when we kind of make me
[1:08:01] in something we make me great we make me
[1:08:05] a big day right babe because no man
[1:08:10] could redeem himself no man could take
[1:08:13] the book right the big the big man took
[1:08:18] the book
[1:08:19] the big man is living in you and I glory
[1:08:24] to God
[1:08:25] and I outside of that you know I like
[1:08:28] the property saying you know real big
[1:08:30] man make themselves small but he says
[1:08:34] it's the ones with a suit suit of
[1:08:36] clothes a little bit of money in the
[1:08:39] bank right they try to make themselves
[1:08:42] something he says the nature of man he
[1:08:46] said you know they try to make
[1:08:48] themselves small for a minute for a
[1:08:50] season and the next I give too low and
[1:08:53] they start trying to work them work
[1:08:55] themselves back up right but he said
[1:08:58] real big man and make you feel like you
[1:09:01] something and you somebody right hey I
[1:09:07] like that that feel good to me that
[1:09:09] sounds good see a real big man right
[1:09:14] brother he talks about coming in contact
[1:09:17] with men of status right
[1:09:20] man with man with position man with

[1:10:45] willing to make an eternal investment
[1:10:49] into the kingdom of God they became
[1:10:52] partners with Paul in in the work they
[1:10:56] don't say something see as as a minister
[1:11:01] as a any Shepherd they can't do anything
[1:11:04] outside of partnership you would be got

[1:13:24] gonna make me preach up in here this
[1:13:25] morning right the work is good God don't
[1:13:30] do halfway stuff you look back to
[1:13:33] Genesis to see chapter the Bible
[1:13:34] everything he done was perfect it was
[1:13:37] good no flaws huh
[1:13:42] you know sometimes I I was telling the
[1:13:46] church Thursday night I say you know we
[1:13:47] living in an age where were men are
[1:13:51] dissecting the Bible and and bringing in
[1:13:54] all of these different things and and
[1:13:55] the word the term that they're using is
[1:13:58] is being inclusive being inclusive see
[1:14:06] because they're trying to bring in all
[1:14:08] of these these foul spirits right and
[1:14:13] into the Church of God and then they
[1:14:15] take scripture same thing that the devil
[1:14:18] did back in Genesis right now that was a
[1:14:21] lot of quote the Bible right he just
[1:14:25] gonna give you all a error he gonna give
[1:14:28] a certain amount of truth and then then
[1:14:31] he's gonna slip a little something in on
[1:14:34] you and and they said well you know God
[1:14:37] is love and and we gotta we gotta just
[1:14:41] love everybody
[1:14:43] god is love and we do have to love
[1:14:46] everybody but we don't have to put up
[1:14:49] with foolishness
[1:14:50] [Music]
[1:14:53] Gus that's the truth that's we we do not
[1:14:57] have to accept right people said well he
[1:15:02] i was made like this no you gotta just a
[1:15:05] devil on you right cuz cuz god don't
[1:15:08] this deceit of god is perfect
[1:15:12] see that's that is why the seed had to
[1:15:16] be restored
[1:15:18] come on we needed a restoration in order
[1:15:21] to produce the kind of church that god
[1:15:24] is looking for the amiga church has got
[1:15:27] to be like the alpha charge in order to
[1:15:30] produce that it had to be a restoration
[1:15:32] of the seed that's why he preached
[1:15:34] spoken word is there isn't a seed to try
[1:15:37] to shout smart man what his ministry was
[1:15:41] all about right come on see if we we
[1:15:48] gotta get back we had to get back to the
[1:15:51] bible in order to produce a bible church
[1:15:54] right cuz the denominational seed can
[1:15:58] only produce it done after this kind
[1:16:00] right and see you look at the nominal
[1:16:04] world now it's this that term is there
[1:16:07] inclusive we we want the homosexuals to
[1:16:10] come in and be relaxed right we want all
[1:16:13] of these folk not realizing scripturally
[1:16:17] from Genesis God separate he say where I
[1:16:21] put enmity between thy seed and surfacy
[1:16:24] right he told he told Abraham when he
[1:16:28] dealt with him right in Genesis he says
[1:16:31] man separate yourself see the Word of
[1:16:33] God always called for a total separation
[1:16:35] of all unbelief always why he told him
[1:16:39] look man when you when you you know when
[1:16:41] y'all cross over into the land which is
[1:16:43] a promise that I'm giving you man don't
[1:16:46] look don't let your son don't let your
[1:16:49] daughter's the I mean be separated be
[1:16:52] different be different see but we won't
[1:16:58] inclusive then we say love but see what
[1:17:02] people don't realize
[1:17:03] God God is a God of love it is also a
[1:17:05] God adjustment to he no church he he
[1:17:09] just a sodomite I'm gonna get off this
[1:17:13] in a minute but y'all pray for them he
[1:17:15] justice sodomites see don't don't look
[1:17:19] at just one aspect now we take inhale
[1:17:22] out the Bible ain't no such thing as
[1:17:26] hell if God said Amen is such thing as
[1:17:29] hell who is a man to come and say is no
[1:17:33] such thing is held see but you know
[1:17:40] people people are not spiritual they
[1:17:45] they get on the bandwagon of a hold of
[1:17:47] these things but not realizing the word
[1:17:50] says you got to come back to the Bible
[1:17:53] right come on church amen
[1:17:56] regardless of emotions and sensations
[1:17:59] you got to come back to the Bible back
[1:18:02] to Pentecost back to the word of st.
[1:18:06] just good things that the Prophet he was
[1:18:10] trying to show us something right he
[1:18:14] said people error because they don't
[1:18:16] know the Bible right they don't know
[1:18:19] scripture but see these these brethren
[1:18:23] they made an internal investment right
[1:18:28] amen
[1:18:30] watch watch the double life of Christ
[1:18:34] see these things is written for an
[1:18:37] example for us see we have got to be
[1:18:41] able to look in the scripture right and
[1:18:43] see God on display right what's the the
[1:18:51] characteristics of God in a vessel right
[1:18:56] how God responds to things scripturally
[1:19:02] how the Church of the Living God
[1:19:05] what'swhat's their action right what's
[1:19:10] right
[1:19:12] come on priest with me somebody watch
[1:19:14] right y'all just hold on you might have
[1:19:16] to go back and get the tape a listen to
[1:19:18] it again
[1:19:19] but what's right see cuz you know that
[1:19:25] there's a there's a right way the wrong
[1:19:27] way right glory to God and you want to
[1:19:31] know what's right as a Christian how do
[1:19:35] I supposed to live what's what's my
[1:19:38] action right see we're gonna what we're
[1:19:43] going to see we're gonna see action in a
[1:19:45] response that their actions from their
[1:19:52] experience with Paul and their
[1:19:54] conversion what Paul calls them to make
[1:19:56] an eternal investment in the kingdom
[1:20:00] building right I'm gonna stop throwing
[1:20:03] that a minute
[1:20:04] cuz you find people talk about kingdom
[1:20:08] building but they're talking about a lot
[1:20:11] of times earth our earthly something
[1:20:13] Jesus they tried to make him the king of
[1:20:17] things at an instrument if my kingdom
[1:20:18] was of this world my people to fight but
[1:20:23] a lot of times you find smart man take
[1:20:26] terminology but they're only concerned
[1:20:29] about an earthly kingdom something that
[1:20:33] that you know they could sit on an
[1:20:35] earthly throne see a man take a position
[1:20:40] here and get accolades and praise right
[1:20:45] look look what I've done
[1:20:48] look what I built and when you do that
[1:20:51] you free to get yourself in trouble cuz
[1:20:55] cuz look at Moses the minute Moses the
[1:20:58] minute Moses got in the flesh God say
[1:21:01] okay you the big man right this all
[1:21:05] about you right okay you come on up here
[1:21:07] let me show you something mister huh
[1:21:09] when he got mad at the children of God
[1:21:11] when God told him to go speak to the
[1:21:13] rock and he went and in the flesh and
[1:21:16] smote the rock a second time you bunch
[1:21:19] of rebels see we gotta watch
[1:21:22] you bunch of rebels do I got to watch do
[1:21:28] I got to God say you did say that did no
[1:21:41] no here most come out Moses Moses come
[1:21:46] calm calm calm come on up you don't need
[1:21:49] to talk with you for a minute
[1:21:51] right you when you first started out in
[1:21:58] ministry you couldn't speak y'all don't
[1:22:02] talk to him I'm feeling good now you
[1:22:04] could speak you couldn't talk you you
[1:22:07] didn't want to go hurt you it man I'm
[1:22:12] illiterate man I'm too small and now you
[1:22:16] now you've gotten to a position in your
[1:22:18] place now is you mean to tell me I
[1:22:22] well what happened oh I feel good now
[1:22:26] see what what happened to the man that
[1:22:30] couldn't speak come on
[1:22:33] see we gotta watch things we gotta watch
[1:22:36] spirits what what happened to the man
[1:22:39] that was subtle what happened to the man
[1:22:43] to have five church members you know
[1:22:50] what happens a lot of times we get
[1:22:52] elevated you're seeing it all over the
[1:22:54] message now well we making songs after
[1:22:58] preachers we bound okay and then we
[1:23:05] wonder why the outside world sometimes
[1:23:07] look innocent
[1:23:08] that's a lot of crazy there see the
[1:23:14] emphasis supposed to be on Christ the
[1:23:19] word and not a man
[1:23:23] see they those early Christians invested
[1:23:27] right amen
[1:23:29] in Christ in the work in the world not
[1:23:32] anything fleshly not anything earthly
[1:23:34] right and Paul was was in isn't it right
[1:23:40] into the philippians church right and he
[1:23:44] he was saying i thank my god upon every
[1:23:46] remembrance of you look at the response
[1:23:50] look at the christian the christian
[1:23:53] character right yankie following me
[1:23:57] right look at the life of Christ and
[1:24:01] Paul Paul say I'm thankful right Paul
[1:24:07] was gracious right for the partnership
[1:24:11] for the support right people are highly
[1:24:17] grateful anymore we aren't we are weak
[1:24:21] we have more folk let me taste something
[1:24:24] right we have more now than we've ever
[1:24:27] had all of our lives the history of folk
[1:24:35] right let me say this how many of us
[1:24:40] ever you know we we don't most of us
[1:24:42] young Americans at least my age we don't
[1:24:45] know that but no outhouse oh I'm singing
[1:24:48] overseas somewhere I never experienced
[1:24:52] that come on man when I was raised up my
[1:24:58] folk had bathrooms in the house my momma
[1:25:01] know bout that I don't know nothin bout
[1:25:03] that a little bit older than me probably
[1:25:11] know that and if you from another
[1:25:12] country you probably know that you know
[1:25:14] I went to Jamaica I remember one time
[1:25:16] you know brother brown a priest on a
[1:25:18] broken sister and I went to I went to
[1:25:21] Jamaica and I first hand I'm like oh oh
[1:25:25] that's the sister I knew exactly what it
[1:25:27] was huh
[1:25:29] Bulls the screen Bulls all on top is
[1:25:32] like lord I can't drink that ain't built
[1:25:35] for that go get me some water for so
[1:25:37] well we have more man let's think about
[1:25:43] it some of us got two three cars in our
[1:25:46] yard
[1:25:47] we got air-conditioned that's a luxury
[1:25:52] huh how do you think things that we take
[1:25:56] for granted right is-is-is
[1:25:59] is a real luxury but we we as Christians
[1:26:07] we should be thankful for the least
[1:26:09] little thing huh from the young to the
[1:26:14] old
[1:26:15] well you watch you watch you know beat
[1:26:19] and we can support for us to Train about
[1:26:21] children right we spoil them and they be
[1:26:24] so unappreciative this I only gave me
[1:26:29] this Oh Tyree kicking when I was coming
[1:26:41] through if you went on a tirade my mom
[1:26:43] would be right right behind you like the
[1:26:45] Tasmanian devil y'all gonna talk about
[1:26:52] right now y'all know mother Tillman
[1:26:56] didn't play the radio yeah we were
[1:27:01] soldiers boy but you know you and the
[1:27:05] reason the reason why you see a lot of
[1:27:08] what we see inside people aren't
[1:27:09] grateful people people are thankful
[1:27:12] people don't have the kind of respect
[1:27:15] right and I ain't even talking about a
[1:27:18] lot of times out there on time I even in
[1:27:20] the church right in the church for Paul
[1:27:25] says man I'm thankful I'm thankful for
[1:27:30] what you guys have because you guys have
[1:27:34] made it possible for me to work for me
[1:27:39] to accomplish things does the small
[1:27:41] gestures look nothing too small right
[1:27:45] cuz look at Jesus with the woman with
[1:27:47] the love to love to meit's right he try
[1:27:53] to stop even the prophet of God he you
[1:27:55] know one time he wanted to stop stop the
[1:27:57] woman you know don't do that
[1:28:00] nobody blessing he looked in the
[1:28:02] scripture and saw where Jesus didn't
[1:28:05] stop that woman from giving her life cuz
[1:28:10] you okay I'll give God huh man kind of
[1:28:14] grew up in the Baptist Church a little
[1:28:15] bit they just saying the more you give
[1:28:17] the more he'll give you to you no matter
[1:28:21] how no matter how hard you try you
[1:28:24] cannot outgive God God won't let you
[1:28:29] beat him huh
[1:28:32] you give two dollars he'll give it back
[1:28:35] five dollars ten dollars huh God like
[1:28:40] what you can't outgive me I got too much
[1:28:42] resource huh how many believe that lower
[1:28:48] to his wonderful name because you know
[1:28:50] he says you know I thank my god upon
[1:28:56] every remembrance of you look at Paul's
[1:29:01] response right what was he responding to
[1:29:07] write the character of God displayed by
[1:29:12] the church right yeah I got a whole
[1:29:16] ethos going
[1:29:18] because that's what it is what causes
[1:29:22] you to do what you do in the flesh a lot
[1:29:25] of times we wouldn't do it when the
[1:29:27] pastor talked about giving love to get
[1:29:30] quiet sometimes at home you start
[1:29:34] talking about money you could feel the
[1:29:38] wall go up like oh my y'all was just a
[1:29:44] Manning and glory to God now I say mo NE
[1:29:48] why and it's like Jesus stop grabbing
[1:29:54] your pockets and pocketbooks but Paul
[1:30:01] was like and look at his remembrance
[1:30:05] right I'm going somewhere
[1:30:08] look at his remembrance of the church
[1:30:11] right his response was positive it was
[1:30:16] something something of Joey right and
[1:30:21] that's the way it's supposed to be when
[1:30:25] people come in contact with the Church
[1:30:28] of the Living God their memories of the
[1:30:31] church should be positive you know I'm
[1:30:36] reminded of the story they they bought
[1:30:38] they bought the woman that they said
[1:30:40] were caught in adultery y'all know the
[1:30:43] story they brought her to Jesus and and
[1:30:46] a bunch of hypocrites wanted a stone
[1:30:49] they were trying to get Jesus to break
[1:30:52] the word of God all right come on cuz
[1:30:55] you know you can't come into dusty on
[1:30:56] y'all now come on let's be real let's be
[1:31:00] real
[1:31:00] she could not it's like okay y'all
[1:31:03] brought over Winterfell it went where
[1:31:07] was the man there right how could how
[1:31:11] could Jesus pass judgment without the
[1:31:14] man being there but they was trying to
[1:31:18] be hypocritical but Jesus was a master
[1:31:21] of circumstances right amen and and
[1:31:27] Jesus you know kind of you know had some
[1:31:30] discernment in his ministry
[1:31:31] three and and Jesus went down on his
[1:31:35] knees and start right in the dirt and he
[1:31:37] made a real profound statement he that
[1:31:39] without sin
[1:31:41] please cast the first stone never did
[1:31:45] look up I believe Jesus knew half of the
[1:31:49] men in this kind and in in this little
[1:31:51] time them probably being with this woman
[1:31:55] see never looked up never looked up Wow
[1:32:02] everybody started dropping the rocks
[1:32:04] easy now huh making a mass exodus when
[1:32:12] they were all Jesus looked up say woman
[1:32:14] when your accusers well don't look like
[1:32:19] I got nothing
[1:32:21] she's saying wonderful and I ain't here
[1:32:24] the accuser he said goings don't sit no
[1:32:26] more right hey man see and I could have
[1:32:31] I could rip you know I could think about
[1:32:34] heart response right amen went when she
[1:32:39] started remembering that date she could
[1:32:42] have died by the hands of a bunch of
[1:32:46] hypocrites she could have been dead
[1:32:49] sleeping in her grave but she was
[1:32:53] brought in the tight with the son of man
[1:32:59] right and he was able to discern the
[1:33:03] situation and know the Word of God I
[1:33:08] believe when she got to thinking about
[1:33:10] Jesus said boy what a mighty God what
[1:33:13] what a mighty man what a great man what
[1:33:15] a what a example right what a you know
[1:33:22] an example of real Christianity and
[1:33:25] being responsible see we gotta be as
[1:33:32] Christians responsible because there's a
[1:33:35] responsibility that's been given to us
[1:33:37] we are the Great Commission we we gotta
[1:33:40] know what we're here for
[1:33:41] we gotta know what we're doing
[1:33:43] because we don't want people you know
[1:33:46] cuz sometimes you find people testifying
[1:33:50] yeah I was over to that church and boy
[1:33:52] limit II see their remembrance of that
[1:33:56] group right it's not a folk-rock weren't
[1:34:01] effective in a positive way it was it
[1:34:05] was negative see sometimes sometimes
[1:34:09] it's just the devil own people gotta

[1:36:32] gotta be understanding see you know what
[1:36:35] Paul writes in the book of Philippians
[1:36:37] we read it
[1:36:38] Paul Allah God allowed these things
[1:36:41] further for the furtherance of the
[1:36:44] gospel and and and everything it's not
[1:36:48] ill willed a lot of things actually
[1:36:53] meeting the purpose of God we just don't

[1:38:09] look what happened right Oh God a lot of
[1:38:13] times bringing us in contact with folk
[1:38:15] because God wants to do some info right
[1:38:19] and we're just the instruments of God
[1:38:22] see amen that's not we're the
[1:38:25] instruments of God and see when we come

[1:38:57] y'all but I'm just talking right I'm
[1:39:01] just trying to show us something that
[1:39:03] shouldn't be the case if we look at it
[1:39:05] biblically right because you know they
[1:39:09] couldn't you know the people around
[1:39:11] Jesus you know the hypocrites and the
[1:39:13] religious people I couldn't understand
[1:39:14] Jesus you know they would go back to the
[1:39:16] disciple you master always Ronnie's
[1:39:19] you know tax collectors and all these
[1:39:21] types of people but they were sick they
[1:39:27] were sick they needed a physician the
[1:39:30] world is sick they need us though the
[1:39:36] world needs us right because we've been
[1:39:40] given the word we understand the word we
[1:39:45] understand what God was got with his
[1:39:47] word right come on come on
[1:39:52] hey man and see we don't want the
[1:39:55] patients to leave like what I was a
[1:39:57] crazy doctor
[1:39:59] lord have mercy who was dead
[1:40:04] we you know this is my desire right is
[1:40:09] that when when God brings me in contact
[1:40:13] with folk I could have a positive right
[1:40:19] attitude because sometimes our attitude
[1:40:22] is not right huh
[1:40:26] and people be looking at you everybody's
[1:40:29] not crazy
[1:40:30] right and people look at you they say it

[1:40:54] and everybody ain't gonna be giddy
[1:40:56] everybody ain't gonna be like but again
[1:40:59] you know some people gonna be a little
[1:41:03] bit you know low-key and everything but
[1:41:08] we want to be we want to find ourselves
[1:41:10] in a position where God can really use
[1:41:12] us right God used the Philippian Church
[1:41:16] the benefit Paul in ministry and and and
[1:41:19] you know his when he thought about the
[1:41:22] church man it he was grateful he was
[1:41:26] thankful and it was something to smile
[1:41:29] about
[1:41:32] could you imagine man if you know Paul
[1:41:38] would have come in contact with this
[1:41:39] group of people and you know
[1:41:44] one good man boy y'all a terrible group
[1:41:52] of folk talk about representing the
[1:41:56] kingdom that wasn't the case look you

[1:42:01] little things like this it might not
[1:42:03] mean nothing to y'all this more but it'd
[1:42:04] mean a whole lot to me I could preach on
[1:42:06] this for both servers right it means a
[1:42:09] lot because what it shows me right is is
[1:42:13] it shows me the life of Christ in the
[1:42:16] church and then it also shows me the
[1:42:19] life of Christ in the individual and the

[1:42:47] then you know Paul was looking at the
[1:42:51] fact that okay
[1:42:53] these guys will wit me from the start

[1:57:50] and line ourselves up with the word God
[1:57:53] always says a prophet when the people
[1:57:55] get away from the Word of God to bring
[1:57:57] them back to the Word of God cuz he you
[1:58:01] could be worshiping this is a powerful
[1:58:02] statement and worshiping God in vain
[1:58:04] people don't believe that when Jesus
[1:58:07] came on as he said vain do you worship
[1:58:09] Me teaching for doctrines the
[1:58:11] commandments of men see and through
[1:58:15] denominationalism from catholicism right
[1:58:18] on down a lot of amen doctrines the
[1:58:22] commandments of men not biblical not
[1:58:25] biblical see you got worshiping God came
[1:58:29] what no infidel came worship but his his
[1:58:34] worship was not accepted see Amen people
[1:58:39] don't even realize this morning day
[1:58:41] worshipping God
[1:58:43] powerful statement but it's the truth
[1:58:45] right hey man see you got to come back
[1:58:50] to the Word of God that's why we needed
[1:58:53] a prophet because people with so much
[1:58:55] era
[1:58:57] that's why he took so much criticism if
[1:59:00] you stay with the word of God you're
[1:59:02] gonna be hated you're gonna be hated
[1:59:07] you'll be hated in your own home huh
[1:59:11] you'll be put down to your old home
[1:59:13] amongst family people until something
[1:59:16] take place and damn that's the truth
[1:59:22] amen see I don't need a whole lot of
[1:59:26] people you know I love the dumb dumb
[1:59:28] dumb brother but I said you know what
[1:59:30] how can I help people and I can't help

[2:05:43] realistic we weren't even getting full

[2:05:47] right but the atmosphere expectation was
[2:05:53] so charged was so charged to man before
