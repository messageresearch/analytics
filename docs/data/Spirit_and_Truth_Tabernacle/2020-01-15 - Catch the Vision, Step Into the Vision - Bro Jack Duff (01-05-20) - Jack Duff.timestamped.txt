[8:10] there was a little pattern that the God
[8:12] had that God had shown me you know when
[8:15] brother Jack preaches he preached last
[8:19] year the the you have the incredible and
[8:23] when the people began to believe that
[8:25] God began to show the incredible
[8:30] amen so if he's preaching the word of
[8:33] Almighty God to you he's preaching the
[8:35] Holy Ghost and you see the Holy Ghost
[8:37] coming falling in our midst
[8:38] just believe that word and take it is
[8:41] for you Amen God comes and proves his
[8:44] word but Satan will also come and try
[8:46] and prove you too Amen try and take that
[8:49] joy that you had try and get you to
[8:51] disbelieve what our pastors preaching
[8:53] but you put that word on your lips
[8:55] Amen my wife had a little statement
[8:57] she's two years ago what was it when it
[9:06] was this morning faith your faith is

[9:37] it's a little scripture that sister Ruth
[9:39] brought up this morning I thought that
[9:42] we should read this amen
[9:47] [Music]
[9:49] praise the Lord our scripture reads or
[9:52] give thanks unto the Lord for he is good
[9:54] because his mercy endureth forever let
[9:58] Israel now say that his mercy endureth
[10:00] forever let the house of Aaron now say
[10:03] that his mercy endureth forever let them
[10:07] now that fear the Lord see that his
[10:09] mercy endureth forever
[10:11] call upon the Lord in distress the Lord
[10:14] answered me and sent me in a large place
[10:17] the Lord is on my side I will not fear
[10:20] what man can do unto me the Lord taketh
[10:23] my part with them that help me therefore
[10:26] shall I see my desire upon them that
[10:28] hate me it is better to trust in the
[10:30] Lord than to put confidence in man it is
[10:33] better to trust in the Lord than to put
[10:35] confidence in princes all the nations
[10:38] can pass me about but in the name of the
[10:40] Lord will I destroy them my lord

[55:39] morning but I forgot to mention to the
[55:42] church I we have the the church app and
[55:49] on the church app last year took some
[55:53] time to build another Bible plan and
[55:56] within this Bible plan is one that we
[55:59] use a couple of years ago me and some
[56:00] other Saints and and and it allowed me
[56:04] just as we read I would make comments
[56:06] about you know just some of the things
[56:07] that I might have read about and this
[56:09] stuff just like a little devotional that
[56:11] you can just kind of look at and maybe
[56:13] just even you know come up with some of
[56:15] your own thoughts but something just
[56:17] kind of make you think about what you're
[56:18] reading and so I put that together and
[56:21] put it on the on our on our on our
[56:23] church app and we started a plan at the
[56:25] beginning of the year so those of you
[56:27] that would like to join us a man for one
[56:30] year bible reading plan right there in
[56:32] the church at the very first button
[56:34] there's a Bible reading plan and we're
[56:35] using the one called the one year bible
[56:37] there's multiple plans very plans there
[56:40] but you'll see the one that says one
[56:42] year Bible and that's the one that we're
[56:44] using for this year and I trust that you
[56:46] all would join us on the journey
[56:49] amen is you'd a little statement out
[56:52] there
[56:52] on my Instagram account and I think must
[56:55] have had about ten people from all over
[56:57] the world so you know what I want to
[56:58] join you on the journey reading through
[57:00] the Bible this year so very happy a man
[57:03] to have people join us on a journey and
[57:05] if you've never read your Bible through
[57:06] the year once this would be a good year
[57:09] a man to start so I know it's a few days
[57:12] and it might be a little bit behind but
[57:13] that's okay god I give you some time in
[57:15] your schedule you'll be able to catch up
[57:17] a man glory to God but we want to
[57:20] encourage everybody if you can just just
[57:22] get in the church after if you don't
[57:23] have anyone access to the app just send
[57:25] me a text is something I'll give you an
[57:26] instructions on how to get there amen so
[57:29] I want to read from two passages of
[57:32] Scripture and actually as we read for
[57:36] those that a man like to kind of try to
[57:40] figure out the scriptures and everything
[57:41] and what how to connect I'm not sure
[57:44] it's in the it's in the word summary and
[57:47] and I'm just letting the Lord just kind
[57:49] of take us this morning a man this first
[57:51] Sunday of 2020 a man thank God I was saw
[57:56] somebody put a little post out there
[57:57] we're gonna Habakkuk chapter 2 and man
[57:59] Habakkuk chapter 2 but I saw somebody
[58:01] put out a poster on mention it to you
[58:03] all when you're doing in a legal
[58:06] document make sure when you're dating
[58:10] the document that you put the full year
[58:14] on it don't just do like one five twenty
[58:18] because somebody could come behind you
[58:20] and put a 17 or 18 and a 19 or whatever
[58:22] and now you in trouble so just make sure
[58:24] you do one five twenty twenty right when
[58:28] you're doing legal documents and things
[58:29] like that so just it may be be careful
[58:32] this year
[58:33] all right here in the back of two and
[58:36] then we'll read also from John 11 and a
[58:41] little bit a man back to States I will
[58:50] stand upon my watch and set me upon the
[58:55] tower and will watch to see what he will
[58:58] say unto me and what I shall answer when
[59:02] I am reproved
[59:04] and the Lord answered me and said write
[59:06] the vision and make it plain upon the
[59:11] tables that he may run that read assent
[59:17] for the vision is yet for an appointed
[59:21] time but at the end it shall speak and
[59:24] not lie though it tarries wait for it
[59:28] glory to God because it will surely come
[59:32] it will not tarry a man verse 4 says
[59:37] behold his soul which is lifted up it's
[59:41] not upright in him but the just shall
[59:44] live by his faith a man let's turn over
[59:48] to John chapter 11 I saw Ruth back there
[59:51] so good to see Ruth in the house of the
[59:53] Lord on today in man praise the Lord
[59:57] a man John chapter 11 and I'll just
[1:00:02] start reading a man at verse 33 praise
[1:00:09] the Lord and though we got the Bible on
[1:00:18] our apps and I mean on our phones the
[1:00:20] Bible apps and things like that on a
[1:00:22] phone is so easy just to you know punch
[1:00:26] it in with your little your thumb a
[1:00:27] couple fingers but I do love to hear
[1:00:30] when the the page is turned can you add
[1:00:35] kind of like make like the pages of
[1:00:38] turning or something see if they can get
[1:00:40] something like that but I do love to
[1:00:42] hear the pages turn a man praise the
[1:00:45] Lord John 11 verse 33 it says when Jesus
[1:00:49] therefore saw her weeping and the Jews
[1:00:54] also weeping which came with her he
[1:00:59] groaned in the spirit and was trouble
[1:01:02] and said where have you laid him then
[1:01:05] said they
[1:01:06] then Lord come and see Jesus who had
[1:01:11] been a man they said then said the Jews
[1:01:16] behold how he loved him and come and
[1:01:20] some of them said could not this man
[1:01:23] which open the eyes of the blind have
[1:01:27] calls that even this man should not have
[1:01:30] died I mean could not this man do
[1:01:33] something about it pretty much Jesus
[1:01:36] therefore again groaning in himself
[1:01:38] cometh to the grave it was a cave and a
[1:01:44] stone lay upon it man and you know as I
[1:01:47] was reading this and the Jesus groaning
[1:01:50] in himself
[1:01:51] I wonder if Jesus is also seeing a stone
[1:01:54] upon a cave that he would be in but it
[1:01:58] would be removed one day hallelujah hey
[1:02:02] man listen says verse 39 says jesus said
[1:02:06] take away the stone Martha the sister of
[1:02:10] him that was dead saith unto Him Lord by
[1:02:12] this time he stinketh for he has been
[1:02:15] dead for days jesus saith unto her said
[1:02:20] I not unto thee that if thou wouldest
[1:02:22] believe thou should have see the glory
[1:02:23] of God then they took away the stone
[1:02:27] from the place where the Dead was laid
[1:02:31] in Jesus lifted up his eyes and said
[1:02:33] father I think thee that thou has heard
[1:02:37] me glory to God
[1:02:40] hey man brother branham say this was
[1:02:43] just a routine because Jesus already
[1:02:46] knew what was getting ready to happen so
[1:02:48] he just kind of went through a routine
[1:02:49] prayer hallelujah amen so he says father
[1:02:52] I thank thee that thou has hurt me and I
[1:02:55] knew that thou hearest me always but
[1:02:59] because of the people which stand by I
[1:03:03] said it Amen that they may believe that
[1:03:08] thou hath sent me alright and when he
[1:03:13] thus had spoken he cried with a loud
[1:03:15] voice Lazarus come forth
[1:03:19] and he that was dead came forth bound
[1:03:22] hand and foot with great clothes and his
[1:03:24] face was bound about with a napkin jesus
[1:03:27] said to him loose him and let him go
[1:03:29] then many of the Jews which came to Mary
[1:03:33] and had seen the things which Jesus did
[1:03:35] believed on him a man but some of them
[1:03:39] went their ways to the Pharisees and
[1:03:42] told them what things Jesus had done the
[1:03:46] Lord had a blessing to the reading of
[1:03:48] his word let's just bow in a brief word
[1:03:51] of Prayer God we thank you for the word
[1:03:55] that we have read here today we've know

[1:04:47] the vision then step into the vision a
[1:04:52] man just a quick quote here from the
[1:04:55] message countdown say man I want to read
[1:04:58] the Prophet makes this statement I said
[1:05:02] seven is God's perfect number and now he
[1:05:07] has given us the correct countdown and
[1:05:10] his countdown is not ten but seven a man
[1:05:15] says we've just been through it
[1:05:17] in the seven churches now we find out
[1:05:20] over in Revelations the first countdown
[1:05:24] was the first age the second countdown
[1:05:27] the second age and on the seventh
[1:05:30] countdown and here visible before us as
[1:05:33] the pictures drawn is referring to this
[1:05:35] chart of the church sages here amen it
[1:05:37] says as a picture is drawn that we have
[1:05:41] this countdown the first first number
[1:05:43] County was Ephesus the second number
[1:05:46] County was Smyrna smarter then Pergamos
[1:05:51] Thyatira fifth was Sardis sixth was
[1:05:54] Philadelphia and the seventh was
[1:05:57] Laodicea the last church each a man
[1:06:02] which is where we're living at right now
[1:06:04] a man we're living in the end of the end
[1:06:07] of the church age right he says says the
[1:06:13] myiasis and the seventh which was later
[1:06:17] see in the last church age then it's the
[1:06:21] zero time I like that then it's the zero
[1:06:26] time a man for the church to leave a man
[1:06:31] so this morning I'm trying to get to the
[1:06:33] church if we're at zero time we need to
[1:06:36] catch the vision and then step into the
[1:06:39] vision hallelujah church he may listen
[1:06:42] it says then it's the zero time 2020
[1:06:46] zero time for the church to leave after
[1:06:50] the church ages have served their tongue
[1:06:53] hallelujah well why these years we are
[1:06:56] going into a rapture what what can we
[1:06:59] claim in there I pray the same prayer
[1:07:03] that child paid in the end of the Bible
[1:07:07] even so come Lord Jesus I don't know if
[1:07:11] we can handle much more of this so why
[1:07:13] not this year
[1:07:14] here let's catch the vision and then
[1:07:17] step into the vision a man he says he
[1:07:23] says then it's the thinnest the seal
[1:07:27] time for the church to leave after the
[1:07:31] church agents have served their term now
[1:07:33] we know that type of Thyatira age has
[1:07:36] come and gone and the fever's age has
[1:07:38] come and gone
[1:07:39] then the Philadelphia age that's come in
[1:07:41] gold and we are in the seven churches at
[1:07:43] the end of it the legacy in age and that
[1:07:47] is the countdown all glory to God I
[1:07:51] thank God for that and I'm on the
[1:07:53] expectation amen for this year we know
[1:07:56] we don't have much longer church and if
[1:07:58] there's ever time to get desperate that
[1:08:00] time is right now a man if there's every
[1:08:03] time to be on fire for God that time is
[1:08:07] right now hey man we don't have time -
[1:08:09] amen you know when there's astronauts

[1:09:01] throw some things for the world putting
[1:09:03] things off be locked and ready to go hey
[1:09:18] man
[1:09:18] glory to God so we might as well catch
[1:09:20] the vision and then step into it
[1:09:23] hallelujah
[1:09:25] all right let me uh let me just read a
[1:09:27] couple things here and then we want to
[1:09:29] go into this thought a man today and I
[1:09:32] wanted to maybe catch a statement here
[1:09:37] from the voice of God in his last days
[1:09:38] now brother Branham was referring to the
[1:09:43] scripture in first Samuel of the the
[1:09:44] chapter 3 verse 1 where it spoke the
[1:09:49] child
[1:09:49] Samuel ministered unto the Lord before
[1:09:51] Eli and the word of the Lord was
[1:09:54] precious in those days there was no open
[1:09:58] vision there was no open vision and it
[1:10:02] makes a statement in that and he says he
[1:10:05] says see what is a vision then just one
[1:10:08] second on that quote since what is a
[1:10:10] vision then it's the direct word of the
[1:10:12] Lord and the Lord's word was precious
[1:10:15] right so what's the vision so it when it
[1:10:17] was no open vision he says what is a
[1:10:20] vision it's a direct word of the Lord
[1:10:23] it's the direct word of the Lord that's
[1:10:26] the vision a man it says and that was
[1:10:28] precious the direct word of the Lord has
[1:10:31] gotta be precious this Bible has got to
[1:10:34] become precious to us amen this bought
[1:10:37] what God is writing in his word has got
[1:10:39] to become precious what God revealed
[1:10:42] through his prophet has got to become
[1:10:44] precious all come on church hey man we
[1:10:50] we got it we got we got we got to spend
[1:10:52] some time with the Lord this year all
[1:10:54] right put it up put it in your schedule
[1:10:55] I'm gonna spend time with the Lord this
[1:10:57] year hallelujah amen there's a lot of
[1:11:01] too many other things that have become
[1:11:02] precious to us
[1:11:04] new year has become precious a man Kurt
[1:11:07] Weill has become precious Walmart has
[1:11:10] become precious but the Bible Amen must
[1:11:14] become precious not in God's right in
[1:11:18] our sight it's got to become precious a
[1:11:22] man a vision is the direct water the
[1:11:25] Lord and the Lord work the Lord's word
[1:11:28] was precious the Lord's word was
[1:11:32] precious search is precious hey man we
[1:11:37] got anything we can do to make sure that
[1:11:39] we are we include God we need to do that
[1:11:42] this year all right hearing this message
[1:11:44] the voice of God in the last days says
[1:11:47] oh that would be enough text that we
[1:11:50] could speak here speak on here for a
[1:11:53] month he says and we could draw from we
[1:11:57] can draw much text from this glorious
[1:11:59] text he's talking about First Samuel
[1:12:01] chapter 3 verse 1 he says but this
[1:12:03] morning we just have about twenty
[1:12:05] minutes to get out in proper time I
[1:12:07] guess Sunday school is over over maybe
[1:12:10] it follows this I don't know but however
[1:12:13] I want I want to use the text of voice
[1:12:15] of God in the last days since it's a
[1:12:17] very outstanding time we realize that
[1:12:21] where we're speaking from in the
[1:12:23] scriptures that it said there was no
[1:12:26] open vision in the days of Samuel say
[1:12:29] therefore when there where there's no
[1:12:32] vision the Bible said the people perish
[1:12:36] we must have a vision and a vision comes
[1:12:41] to the prophets and it's the word of the
[1:12:44] Lord spoken to them I hope you stay with
[1:12:48] me this morning church
[1:12:50] glory to God amen the vision comes to
[1:12:54] the prophets and instable Lord spoken to
[1:12:58] them all right he goes over a little
[1:13:01] further he says and we find out that Eli
[1:13:04] was not a prophet he was a priest and he
[1:13:09] was getting old
[1:13:10] eyes were going Tim and he could not
[1:13:12] seem to get around was a great heavy man
[1:13:15] he had began to let the work of the Lord
[1:13:18] go undone hey man we don't want to be
[1:13:22] caught doing that in this hour so that's
[1:13:24] something like it is today I think the
[1:13:27] church the organization and
[1:13:28] denominations they've been on the field
[1:13:30] for a long time and they're beginning
[1:13:32] getting lakhs and the work of the Lord
[1:13:35] is being left undone hallelujah the word
[1:13:38] of truth because the church in itself
[1:13:41] has become dim-sighted the church in
[1:13:45] itself has become damned sight it's a
[1:13:50] mess so the church can see some things
[1:13:52] but not all things hallelujah amen we
[1:13:56] don't want to be that way and we're
[1:13:58] going to talk about this a little bit
[1:13:59] you know we want to have what's
[1:14:01] perceived as perfect vision what's
[1:14:05] perceived that's perfect vision let's go
[1:14:07] a little further hallelujah glory he
[1:14:10] said sup the church him to come
[1:14:11] dim-sighted and we need today the voice
[1:14:13] of God to speak among us bring us back
[1:14:17] and see Eli laid down his eyesight was
[1:14:20] failing he was a priest and they had no
[1:14:23] open vision from the Lord and that great
[1:14:26] need he goes on a little further now let
[1:14:28] me just just stay with me on this one
[1:14:29] says that God has promised to meet the
[1:14:31] need of the hour he always does that and
[1:14:35] we need the voice of God today to meet
[1:14:37] the need of the hour to meet the time
[1:14:39] that we're living in and after he has
[1:14:42] promised it we can rest assured that he
[1:14:44] will keep his promise that's the
[1:14:47] confidence that the believer has in his
[1:14:49] maker that he promised to meet the need
[1:14:51] and today one reason that the church is
[1:14:55] in the condition that it's in is because
[1:14:57] there are so many voices so many so many
[1:15:02] other voices to attract the church from
[1:15:04] the voice of God II till it's very
[1:15:07] doubtful that many would hear the voice
[1:15:10] of God though it spoke right in their
[1:15:13] myths they perhaps women
[1:15:16] wouldn't even understand it because it
[1:15:18] would be a foreign thing to them they've
[1:15:21] gotten themselves so much centered on
[1:15:23] the forces of the day and church I want
[1:15:25] us to be very very careful that that we
[1:15:27] don't get out get ourselves centered on
[1:15:29] all the other voices we want to be
[1:15:31] wrapped up and tied up in the voice of
[1:15:33] God what he's saying to us through his
[1:15:35] word through His Prophet that brought
[1:15:37] the revealed word we want to understand
[1:15:39] those things in this hour it's zero time
[1:15:41] it's zero time now I said what's
[1:15:45] perceived as perfect vision who was
[1:15:48] perceived as perfect vision amen and so
[1:15:53] you know when people have 20/20 vision
[1:15:57] amen it's perceived as perfect vision
[1:16:01] amen hallelujah and I want to say
[1:16:04] perceived because 20/20 vision is really
[1:16:07] not perfect vision a man 2020 vision is
[1:16:11] normal vision a man it's ordinary vision
[1:16:15] when you got 20/20 vision just simply
[1:16:18] means you don't need any extra help to
[1:16:20] see 20 feet in front of you hallelujah
[1:16:24] when they put the chart there amen all
[1:16:26] you're doing is looking at 20 feet in
[1:16:28] front of you amen in the average person
[1:16:31] amen the average person can see 20/20
[1:16:39] hallelujah but when you're struggling
[1:16:41] sometime your vision you can't see 20
[1:16:43] feet in front of you hallelujah amen it
[1:16:46] might take you might need a little extra
[1:16:48] something to help you see to win its
[1:16:50] winning glory to God somebody a man let
[1:16:55] me just really just a little bit here
[1:16:57] it's perceived as a man perfect vision
[1:17:01] glory to God watch this now I was just
[1:17:04] looking at a few things on the Internet
[1:17:05] it says visual acuity of 20/20 is
[1:17:11] considered perfect vision because no
[1:17:14] aids are required to see better right
[1:17:17] since what people can have better than
[1:17:20] 20/20 vision
[1:17:22] right they say many young people are
[1:17:26] able to see let a smaller than the
[1:17:28] general 20 20 20 20 shots even people
[1:17:33] who know that they see 20/20 or better
[1:17:35] but feel that other aspects of their
[1:17:37] vision are lacking have options for
[1:17:40] improvement
[1:17:41] I like this now because you can have
[1:17:44] 20/20 vision and still be lacking in
[1:17:46] some areas Oh glory to God
[1:17:49] now what are they talking about here
[1:17:50] what are we lacking in another another
[1:17:52] little website I was looking at says
[1:17:54] having 20/20 vision does not necessarily
[1:17:58] mean you have perfect vision right 20/20
[1:18:02] vision only indicates the sharpness or
[1:18:06] clarity of vision at a distance other
[1:18:10] important vision skills include
[1:18:13] peripheral peripheral awareness so not
[1:18:16] just what you can see straight on you
[1:18:18] better be able to look at on this side
[1:18:20] to see how the devil might be getting
[1:18:22] you come on in 2020 that ball might be
[1:18:25] trying to catch you in a blind spot so
[1:18:28] you have vision as well somebody it's
[1:18:35] not watch night man look at this say say
[1:18:47] it only indicates 20/20 vision only
[1:18:51] indicates the sharpness or clarity of
[1:18:53] vision at a distance other important
[1:18:55] vision skills including peripheral
[1:18:58] awareness or SAR vision amen
[1:19:01] a coordination glory to God that's
[1:19:04] another thing here
[1:19:05] a man with with vision that's very
[1:19:07] important you got to have good hand and
[1:19:09] eye coordination glory to God say y'all
[1:19:12] also got to have depth perception I like
[1:19:15] that Amen if you don't have good
[1:19:17] hand-eye coordination if I picked up a
[1:19:20] manner
[1:19:22] picked up this bottle and I just threw
[1:19:24] it out at you you didn't have good
[1:19:25] hand-eye coordination your hand will not
[1:19:29] lift up to block what was coming towards
[1:19:31] your hands
[1:19:32] come on some honey a man it's gonna take
[1:19:36] a look at more than just 20/20 I know
[1:19:39] we're excited about being here but it's
[1:19:41] gonna take a little bit more than just
[1:19:43] winter 20 a man to be ready for zero
[1:19:47] time it's gonna take more glory to God
[1:19:55] coordination you won't be able to
[1:19:56] protect yourself the devil throw
[1:19:59] anything at you you won't be able to
[1:20:01] protect yourself you gotta have good
[1:20:03] perception it's when you're driving in
[1:20:06] the car when you get ready to leave the
[1:20:09] plaza today amen they don't have a light
[1:20:13] out there for you to turn left or right
[1:20:14] on but you gotta have good depth
[1:20:17] perception how far back is that calm
[1:20:20] before I turn out there in this traffic
[1:20:22] glory to God if your depth perception is
[1:20:26] earth accidents
[1:20:28] praise God and spiritually if your depth
[1:20:32] perception is amen because you're
[1:20:40] approaching you the wrong way you must
[1:20:43] have good perception what is the devil
[1:20:47] trying to get you involved in
[1:20:50] hallelujah the other thing they say you
[1:20:53] need focus and ability amen not just win
[1:20:57] it Twitter you need good focus and
[1:20:58] ability because there might be some
[1:21:00] object a little further out and you got
[1:21:03] to be able to see them as well and focus
[1:21:04] on what is really happening there before
[1:21:06] you the other thing they say you need
[1:21:08] good color vision amen all of these
[1:21:10] things go
[1:21:11] amen together when it's presenting
[1:21:13] perfect vision hallelujah hallelujah I
[1:21:17] told you 2020 the vision is average it's
[1:21:21] normal
[1:21:22] a minute it's what everybody else got
[1:21:25] hallelujah glory to God if I can put it
[1:21:28] in church world Amen everybody got a
[1:21:30] Bible they ran all up and got a Bible
[1:21:34] and they can read twin it's witty but I
[1:21:36] already able to see the promise for this
[1:21:38] thing see when you're looking at the
[1:21:41] promise for this day now you got some
[1:21:42] perception a man not now now you now you
[1:21:45] can see things you can see everything
[1:21:47] not just this one little part hallelujah
[1:21:50] not just the one little charter further
[1:21:51] you can see everything a man so so when
[1:21:55] I thought about this if 2020 vision is
[1:21:57] just ordinary I said to myself I don't
[1:22:00] want to be ordinary it's when it's money
[1:22:03] I want to be extraordinary amen I don't
[1:22:07] want to be usual amen I want God to do
[1:22:11] the unusual please you know I'm not
[1:22:14] trying to be the same as everybody else
[1:22:17] I actually want to be different
[1:22:19] please God I don't want to see the
[1:22:24] natural in 2020 I want to see the
[1:22:28] supernatural
[1:22:30] [Applause]
[1:23:07] [Music]
[1:23:10] I want to see Oh glory to God look at
[1:23:17] this you know there's a couple
[1:23:19] definitions when we talk about vision a
[1:23:21] man and I want to bring this the first
[1:23:24] definition is the faculty or state of
[1:23:27] being able to see that's all that's all
[1:23:30] vision is this a faculty or state is
[1:23:33] being able to see and I thought about
[1:23:35] this this quote here that goes along
[1:23:37] that I felt what going on with that out
[1:23:39] of behold I stand at the door and knock
[1:23:41] he managed that the fact I've stated
[1:23:43] being able to see hallelujah
[1:23:46] hey man this goes more spiritual than
[1:23:48] than natural you know and I'm not I'm
[1:23:51] not knocking anybody that gotta you can
[1:23:54] set a vision for your business and you
[1:23:56] know how many Lord bless you with so
[1:23:57] many clients to the Lord do this Lord do
[1:23:59] that I want it I want to share something
[1:24:01] with you and a brother share with me one
[1:24:03] time my ex brother he was running a
[1:24:05] business I said brother how many clients
[1:24:07] you got he said brother I don't count my
[1:24:08] clients I said you don't count your
[1:24:11] clients he said no I don't I don't count
[1:24:13] my clients and say why not brother say
[1:24:16] you know remember when when David went
[1:24:18] out and counted all of his army to see
[1:24:20] how many worries he had he said and then
[1:24:23] he got in trouble with God when he
[1:24:24] counted they say I just depend on God to
[1:24:27] meet my needs
[1:24:29] a man already got and this year God
[1:24:32] gonna meet your needs not only gonna
[1:24:34] meet a become due to exceed in the
[1:24:36] abundant above all you can ask a thing
[1:24:37] glory to God
[1:24:39] alright hallelujah you'll see at the end
[1:24:42] of the year when you pay your taxes
[1:24:43] you'll see how good God been to you
[1:24:44] praise the Lord Amen look at this Amen
[1:24:47] the whole die standard or not because
[1:24:49] his first definition of the word vision
[1:24:51] is the Faculty of state of being able to
[1:24:53] see now look the Prophet says and then
[1:24:56] he said who are you looking for who are
[1:25:00] you looking for Elijah said yes sir
[1:25:03] we're looking for him said come and I'll
[1:25:05] show you what he said and it was Elijah
[1:25:08] Elijah talking Elijah talking to them
[1:25:11] that's the bad black blindness he said
[1:25:15] come here I'll show you where's that
[1:25:17] come follow me and he lied to let the
[1:25:19] whole Syrian army looking at every tree
[1:25:22] looking at everybody looking at Elijah
[1:25:27] yet blind so they had 20/20 vision but
[1:25:32] they didn't have depth of perception or
[1:25:35] any of these other things they
[1:25:36] completely missing that but they they
[1:25:39] could see in promise them they were not
[1:25:41] using glasses to follow me life shot
[1:25:46] remember they were missing everything
[1:25:48] else don't be that way in this hour
[1:25:50] will you miss him what God is doing
[1:25:54] glory to God
[1:25:55] look it goes on a little further he says
[1:25:58] blessed be the name of the Lord God open
[1:26:01] your eyes blind and don't know it and he
[1:26:03] went right down among into a monster
[1:26:06] Israelites where they was laying for
[1:26:08] ambush and then he turned around to them
[1:26:10] and their eyes were open my is seeing
[1:26:13] that it was Elijah blind looking at
[1:26:15] everything 20/20 eyesight Chloe a many
[1:26:20] yet didn't realize that that was Elijah
[1:26:23] so even today people could have 20/20 I
[1:26:29] say but not be able to recognize God
[1:26:34] and we are the Elijah waiting for the
[1:26:38] double portion as brother quickly prayed
[1:26:41] this morning watching me expect that in
[1:26:44] 2020 if we got open and clear vision
[1:26:51] looking at everything 20/20 outside and
[1:26:54] yet didn't realize that was Elijah did
[1:26:56] not Jesus have two of his disciples
[1:26:58] blinded all day until he got on the
[1:27:01] inside and performed a miracle just like
[1:27:04] he did before his crucifix
[1:27:05] crucifixion and their eyes were open I'm
[1:27:08] praying that God will open our eyes so
[1:27:10] we can see him in this hour amen we want
[1:27:13] to see him amen the second definition
[1:27:16] says the ability to think about or plan
[1:27:21] so we have vision they make you have an
[1:27:24] ability to think about or plan the
[1:27:26] future with imagination or with wisdom a
[1:27:30] man you can plan your future with an
[1:27:33] imagination ain't that's some that's
[1:27:36] what that's what they put a man in the
[1:27:40] dictionary as their definition of vision
[1:27:43] so when you got vision you can plan your
[1:27:45] future on two things imagination or
[1:27:48] wisdom now let's put it this way we know
[1:27:50] why they'd use wisdom because the
[1:27:52] mistakes of our past should teach us not
[1:27:55] to do things a certain way
[1:27:57] hallelujah so we can apply the wisdom
[1:27:59] learn and make better decisions for our
[1:28:02] future and that actually gives us vision
[1:28:05] praise the Lord Amen but your
[1:28:07] imagination mind that powerful amen God
[1:28:12] could actually use that because the
[1:28:14] right mental attitude towards any divine
[1:28:17] promise oh it will bring it to pass just
[1:28:22] if you have the right attitude towards
[1:28:24] the promise you got to imagine yourself
[1:28:26] a man walking into that promise you got
[1:28:30] to see yourself overcoming
[1:28:33] come on search you got to see yourself
[1:28:36] of Victoire you get to see yourself as
[1:28:39] more than a conquerer somebody when you
[1:29:32] start expecting you start talking about
[1:29:34] it when you start talking about it you
[1:29:37] start they may confess in it will you
[1:29:40] confess you already testifying about it
[1:29:43] I'm not waiting to feel nothing I'm not
[1:29:47] waiting to see nothing but I'm imagining
[1:29:50] it right now I'm speaking by my my faith
[1:29:52] my imagination glory to God I got faith
[1:29:58] in what I'm imagining especially when it
[1:30:00] comes to the things of God now you know
[1:30:03] the ability to think about a plan the
[1:30:05] future with imagination or with wisdom
[1:30:08] and I just thought about this diverse
[1:30:11] proverbs 29:18 where there is no vision
[1:30:15] glory the people perish where there is
[1:30:19] no vision the people perish but he that
[1:30:23] keepeth the law happy is he a man where
[1:30:26] there is no vision so the ability to
[1:30:29] think about or plan amen the future with
[1:30:33] imagination or with wisdom we got to
[1:30:35] have
[1:30:36] not only for ourselves but you know even
[1:30:38] for this church we have a vision Lord of
[1:30:41] God you got you got a vision for your
[1:30:43] career you got a visit up a vision for
[1:30:46] your business you got a vision for your
[1:30:48] family every man should have a vision
[1:30:50] for his own family a man every mama want
[1:30:52] to see her children make it you got to
[1:30:55] have a vision for it no matter what you
[1:30:57] see in the natural you got to hold on to
[1:31:00] the vision that God gave you and your
[1:31:03] vision can be found right in the
[1:31:05] scripture when you read a promise from
[1:31:07] God you got a vision Oh God because the
[1:31:16] writer Lord is precious if you just read
[1:31:19] the Word of God you can get the vision
[1:31:21] and when you catch the vision step into
[1:31:24] it watch this you know we got a vision
[1:31:29] for this church and our vision is
[1:31:30] actually based out of Ephesians chapter
[1:31:33] 4 verse 11 through 15 a man that's where
[1:31:36] our vision for the church a man is
[1:31:38] inspired from and I won't read all of
[1:31:40] that but I'll just tell you the vision
[1:31:42] for the church is to bring the Saints to
[1:31:44] a perfect place in Christ Oh hallelujah
[1:31:48] Amen this year our vision for the church
[1:31:50] every other Church slant-eyed a vision
[1:31:53] what do we let out our vision
[1:31:56] spiritually spiritually is Sabrina
[1:32:01] Saints to a perfect place in Christ
[1:32:05] hallelujah amen the other part of the
[1:32:08] vision is to continue the ministry of
[1:32:12] Jesus Christ
[1:32:14] [Applause]
[1:32:15] it was an administrative area Branum but
[1:32:19] it was the ministry of Jesus Christ and
[1:32:24] in the broad to be like shine for this
[1:32:28] will continue the ministry of Jesus
[1:32:32] Christ the other part of the vision is
[1:32:38] to edify the body of Jesus Christ so we
[1:32:41] all come to the unity of the faith to
[1:32:43] the steps of a perfect man that is the
[1:32:45] vision for this church amen so they say
[1:32:48] the ability to think about a plan the
[1:32:50] future with imagination or with wisdom
[1:32:52] and I'm thinking about planning the
[1:32:55] future that we're gonna have a perfect
[1:32:57] church without spot or wrinkle people
[1:33:00] fall in line with the Word of God we
[1:33:02] don't have the rest of which about this
[1:33:04] we need a double portion of the Holy
[1:33:06] Ghost to bring conviction to our hearts
[1:33:11] glory to God we meet no Jesus we meet
[1:33:16] Moten's son say I need a limo no you
[1:33:18] need a lot more Jesus we need mo Jesus
[1:33:23] this last definition of vision says an
[1:33:28] experience of seeing someone or
[1:33:30] something in a dream or trance or as a
[1:33:34] supernatural apparition a man so to
[1:33:39] experience of seeing someone or
[1:33:41] something in a dream or trance that's
[1:33:43] having a vision right in a dream or in a
[1:33:46] trench now now look at what the Prophet
[1:33:49] says I want to bring up a little
[1:33:50] statement here that immediately says out
[1:33:52] of my new ministry
[1:33:55] already caught a man the experience of
[1:33:58] seeing someone or something in a dream
[1:34:00] or in a trench and if I'm gonna just get
[1:34:03] ahead of myself I'm gonna let you know
[1:34:04] God has already seeing you and he has a
[1:34:08] certain thing that he's expecting of you
[1:34:10] and now and when he saw you he told the
[1:34:13] Prophet pick up his pick up your pen and
[1:34:16] write this and what he wrote was
[1:34:19] something for the future and I want to
[1:34:21] declare 2020 no more let it be future
[1:34:26] but let it be a manifestation right now
[1:34:30] the rapture cannot continue to be a
[1:34:33] future event there must be a year that
[1:34:37] we step into and that will be the year
[1:34:40] it was just like when our Lord was born
[1:34:43] on this earth when he came the first
[1:34:45] time the prophecies that were spoken
[1:34:48] over virgin conceiving that were had to
[1:34:51] firm a person a virgin somewhere that
[1:34:55] the work is set alone oh my goodness the
[1:34:59] war had the food water went after the
[1:35:02] puppets mouth with succulent ears for
[1:35:06] generation after generation just cycling
[1:35:09] and whirling around until finally sit in
[1:35:12] the living room one morning a one-man
[1:35:14] whatever was a lady named Mary and the
[1:35:18] Lord came circling circling circling
[1:35:21] circling circling circling circling
[1:35:23] here's Mary and they weren't dropped
[1:35:27] into Mary's heart and it became a
[1:35:29] manifestation when she said a man - it
[1:35:35] and when we can come to a point that we
[1:35:39] can say many what God said about us it's
[1:35:42] gonna stop being future events and we're
[1:35:45] gonna hit zero time
[1:35:50] we are here the air declares that we're
[1:35:55] a double zero we're here
[1:36:04] [Applause]
[1:36:09] alright alright alright hallelujah this
[1:36:14] ain't just tweenty tweenty here we got
[1:36:17] more peripheral things that we're
[1:36:18] looking at caps it all to colors
[1:36:20] amen we get in the depth of it come on
[1:36:24] search we're going a little further than
[1:36:25] that oh mama you can go to any church
[1:36:28] and have you amen they can talk about
[1:36:29] your business being blessed this year

[1:36:42] Lord God Dagon Cole asking if I'm still
[1:36:45] in business nobody's picking up the
[1:36:47] phone they just not pick it out and call
[1:36:50] mother no one is picking up the phone
[1:36:52] hey man the war in the Gulf Cartel be
[1:36:55] like on a train somewhere and we're not
[1:36:58] coming back look at this in my new
[1:37:00] ministry this definition of vision and
[1:37:03] experience of seeing someone or
[1:37:05] something in a dream or trance or as a
[1:37:07] supernatural apparition a man and a user
[1:37:12] example the idea came to him in a vision
[1:37:14] the idea came in a vision God can give
[1:37:18] you an idea in a vision a man you know
[1:37:21] every company that has been started
[1:37:23] started because somebody had a vision
[1:37:27] hallelujah somebody believed they could
[1:37:29] do that
[1:37:29] glory to God I was looking this year and
[1:37:32] seemed like the traffic has slowed down
[1:37:35] so much around the holiday season wasn't
[1:37:37] that much traffic out on the highway and
[1:37:39] I'm like because usually this time of
[1:37:41] year men's bumper-to-bumper everywhere
[1:37:42] you go all day long it's like that and
[1:37:45] I'm like it's only like a couple days
[1:37:46] before Christmas that I noticed there
[1:37:48] was a lot of traffic but my god down the
[1:37:50] street from my house I saw all these
[1:37:51] trucks lined up coming out of this one
[1:37:55] parking lot I said that way that's the
[1:37:56] traffic right there it was Amazon Amazon
[1:38:00] I said everybody down but the man had a
[1:38:03] vision I think so I don't know where it
[1:38:05] started thinking this garage is
[1:38:07] something man had a vision and look at
[1:38:09] what happened with this vision so I want
[1:38:11] to tell you if God gave you a vision
[1:38:12] don't give up on it cuz God can give you
[1:38:16] an idea intervention oh go over to God
[1:38:22] look at this now the Prophet says in my
[1:38:24] new ministry he says and as brother to
[1:38:28] police they said a while ago the only
[1:38:29] reason I believe that God lets this go
[1:38:32] on as much as it does now because of his
[1:38:35] promised because of its promise the
[1:38:39] works that I do the things that I do
[1:38:41] show you also now that's a promise from
[1:38:44] God the works that I do shall you do
[1:38:47] also and greater works than these shall
[1:38:51] you do that's what he said right it says
[1:38:54] such a name more than this show you do
[1:38:56] for I go to my father it is His divine
[1:38:59] promise a vision never heals anyone a
[1:39:03] vision only brings the reality of a
[1:39:07] supernatural being present so the vision
[1:39:11] don't bring healing
[1:39:12] but the vision does bring a man the
[1:39:16] reality of a supernatural being present
[1:39:21] that's what we want to see this year we
[1:39:23] want the vision to bring the
[1:39:24] supernatural I mean the reality of his
[1:39:26] supernatural presence amongst us it says
[1:39:29] and then in doing this it brings faith
[1:39:31] to the people so that's why I say I
[1:39:33] don't want to just be natural like
[1:39:34] everybody else
[1:39:36] see the supernatural I don't want to
[1:39:38] just be ordinary I want to be
[1:39:40] extraordinary that's what I'm claiming
[1:39:43] for this year I loo anytime Jesus did
[1:39:46] someone natural
[1:39:48] those weren't coming it was uncommon and
[1:39:51] as a bride we gotta look to be uncommon
[1:39:55] hallelujah amen
[1:39:57] all right now let's go into a little
[1:40:00] something here oh yes Lord thank you
[1:40:05] Jesus give me a couple more quotes and
[1:40:08] then I wonder just kind of go until the
[1:40:10] story this is how to show us the father
[1:40:12] it'll satisfy and that's what I'm
[1:40:14] looking for this year Lord show us the
[1:40:15] father a man show us his mighty works do
[1:40:19] all that you that you promise to doing
[1:40:21] are myths a man do it this year show us
[1:40:24] the father descent I says now this is a
[1:40:26] prayer line that the Prophet is dealing
[1:40:28] with he says now here's a lady strange
[1:40:32] to me I don't know her I've never seen

[1:44:32] I believe was uh the Pool of Bethesda
[1:44:34] and you know this man had been sitting
[1:44:37] around the pool for thirty-eight years
[1:44:39] with a condition and as he was sitting
[1:44:41] there with it with the condition Jesus
[1:44:44] being led by a man his father cuz he
[1:44:47] said I do nothing unless the father show
[1:44:50] me so he's led to go down to this man he
[1:44:53] begins to have a conversation with them
[1:44:55] will thou be made whole the man say you
[1:44:58] know I would but you know as soon as the
[1:45:00] angel come in trouble or water I have
[1:45:03] nobody to help me to get in and and by
[1:45:05] the time I get up somebody already

[1:45:09] come here to hear all your excuses
[1:45:17] about all your excuses I ask you will
[1:45:20] you be made whole and if the naked only
[1:45:23] catch the vision because Jesus was there

[1:45:32] car and take it and go home without
[1:45:35] getting in the water
[1:45:39] the normal Amen process is for people to
[1:45:43] get into the water but in this situation
[1:45:51] [Applause]
[1:45:55] you came in 2020 compassion process in
[1:46:02] order to see him bypass the process you
[1:46:06] must catch the vision
[1:46:09] and when you catch submission to it and
[1:46:16] receive all that Karkat for you that man
[1:46:21] took up his got his put it on his
[1:46:22] shoulder and went on somewhere he's I
[1:46:36] was in my testimony glory glory glory
[1:47:14] hallelujah
[1:47:16] let me just read another little quote
[1:47:18] here before we go further Jesus help us
[1:47:21] this is out of the message of super
[1:47:23] sense so everybody could be normal
[1:47:25] natural with 20/20 but we need a little
[1:47:26] bit more than that hey man we want we
[1:47:29] want a little bit more vision than that
[1:47:30] hearing this message is super sense
[1:47:33] natural people are controlled by five
[1:47:35] senses but holy ghost' feel people have
[1:47:39] a sixth sense
[1:47:41] and only holy ghost feel people have
[1:47:44] this so with you being a holy ghost feel
[1:47:47] you should not be acting normal
[1:47:52] you shouldn't even think normal alright
[1:47:56] you should act natural
[1:47:59] you should act supernatural with with
[1:48:03] the sixth sense this year let's let's
[1:48:05] just set it out straight right with the
[1:48:08] sixth sense
[1:48:09] you need to act different than everybody
[1:48:10] else because you got something that they
[1:48:14] don't have look at what the prophets say
[1:48:17] here
[1:48:18] says now I would not say that because
[1:48:21] that we received a sixth sense that the
[1:48:23] five senses are no good no more yes they
[1:48:26] are those five senses were given to you
[1:48:28] by God and they are to be used says but
[1:48:32] when the five senses act contrary to the
[1:48:35] Word of God
[1:48:35] then they are lying glory now the sixth
[1:48:40] sense cannot lie it's a super sense and
[1:48:44] that's what I want to speak about this
[1:48:47] morning I spoke on a super silent
[1:48:49] tonight on a super sense he says and the
[1:48:52] super sense is a Holy Spirit the faith
[1:48:56] of God that dwells in you Oh hallelujah
[1:49:02] you're not looking forward to come it's
[1:49:03] already here we're trying to tap into
[1:49:05] this and if you let the five senses be
[1:49:09] yielded to the sixth sense it will
[1:49:11] guides you and bring all the other five
[1:49:14] senses under control of that super sense
[1:49:16] for so far above the natural sense as a
[1:49:20] spiritual man is above the natural it's
[1:49:22] as far as high as the heaven is above
[1:49:25] the natural man and his five senses look
[1:49:28] at this
[1:49:29] makes you believe things that you cannot
[1:49:32] see Twitter 20 vengeance is only looking
[1:49:37] at what's in front of me but the sixth
[1:49:39] sense goes beyond what's in front of me
[1:49:41] I'm not stopping that 20 feet 20/20
[1:49:47] vision
[1:49:48] limits you to 20 feet you can only see
[1:49:52] 20 feet in front of you with 20/20
[1:49:55] vision but I want to go beyond 20 feet
[1:49:58] my promise might be a thousand feet up
[1:50:02] 2,000 feet don't let Twitter swimmy
[1:50:11] limit you go beyond that in your face
[1:50:17] that's not normal
[1:50:19] Amen that's supernatural glory to God
[1:50:22] look at this now it says it makes you
[1:50:25] believe things that you cannot see it
[1:50:27] makes you act where you do not think the
[1:50:30] five senses would ever think about it
[1:50:32] the devil can't get into those five
[1:50:36] senses and lie to you but it cannot
[1:50:39] touch that super sense that's far beyond
[1:50:43] his reach that come from God is called
[1:50:46] faith and faith is that great thing
[1:50:48] we're going beyond 20/20 and we will get
[1:50:51] everything that God promised us even the
[1:50:54] things that we cannot see
[1:50:56] [Music]
[1:50:57] I might not be able to see with these
[1:50:59] signs but I can see with my face blow
[1:51:03] and I'm bringing that promise in view
[1:51:06] i'ma praise God for what he's keep what
[1:51:08] what he's doing and what he's getting
[1:51:10] ready to do Oh hallelujah Jesus now this
[1:51:17] just little thought came to me I want to
[1:51:20] circle back around I won't have time to
[1:51:22] read all of this but it's in the message
[1:51:24] wisdom versus faith I won't read it
[1:51:28] Amen but I was telling you all the
[1:51:32] testimony and I preached the sermon a
[1:51:34] few weeks a few few months ago a man
[1:51:37] about sin the word send the word and
[1:51:40] brother Branham was telling us in that
[1:51:42] that the man that has stole brother
[1:51:44] Evans car the man used to be a Christian
[1:51:47] and because he used to be a Christian
[1:51:50] they can pray a prayer and and when they
[1:51:53] prayed a prayer
[1:51:54] they sent the words after this man
[1:51:57] hallelujah amen
[1:51:59] and they just they just claims as lawyer
[1:52:01] you told us whatever we ask in your name
[1:52:03] that we could have it they they put that
[1:52:05] that promise inside the prayer and I
[1:52:08] want to tell you that when you're
[1:52:09] praying make sure you you got to read
[1:52:11] the Word of God so you know what God
[1:52:13] promised you and then you can put the
[1:52:15] promise of God in the prayer and just
[1:52:18] send it on off hallelujah God that's not
[1:52:21] my word that's what you say and since
[1:52:24] you said I'm expecting you to bring it
[1:52:26] to pass it's not up to me to bring it to
[1:52:28] pass it's up to you to bring in the past
[1:52:30] you made the promise and I was told that
[1:52:33] you a God that cannot lie
[1:52:34] [Music]
[1:52:36] Sheila in Jesus name is sitting on off
[1:52:38] they send the world after that man and
[1:52:41] and before you know the world with
[1:52:43] circling found that fellow with the calm
[1:52:45] and conviction sent on them he says you
[1:52:48] bet you're gonna get in trouble with
[1:52:49] this say the man actually had a tie on a
[1:52:52] suit on driving down the road looking
[1:52:53] like he'd going to church almost driving
[1:52:56] this man let us throw the car like that
[1:52:58] and another man used to be a Christian
[1:53:00] soul in the world called him the word
[1:53:02] could deal with his conscience and the
[1:53:04] word he'd stoned and told him turn the
[1:53:07] car back around because I'm just sitting
[1:53:09] the man on a certain Street to look for
[1:53:11] Scott it better be there man turn the
[1:53:15] car around and brother back he got out
[1:53:18] and went on about his business but
[1:53:19] because he had something that the world
[1:53:21] can attach to that's why he turned
[1:53:24] around he brought the car but then the
[1:53:28] same brother had another trial brother
[1:53:31] average have another trial he's selling
[1:53:32] cars this time and when he's selling
[1:53:35] cars Amen he somehow he let a man I
[1:53:39] don't know if you let the man test drive
[1:53:40] the car what but when you let the man
[1:53:42] get the keys to the counter man snuck
[1:53:44] away with that pan on the money that he

[2:00:23] you away the stone I'll take the Taylor
[2:00:26] quote down for me there please let's
[2:00:27] just let's follow this now we back to
[2:00:30] the scripture let me just when we look
[2:00:42] at John 11 now because you got these two
[2:00:45] sisters and these two sisters got two
[2:00:48] spirits on two different spirits they
[2:00:52] born from the same parents but yet their
[2:00:55] approach situations differently Martha
[2:00:59] heard that I mean they both sit for
[2:01:02] Jesus because their brother was dying
[2:01:04] and brother Branham said that Jesus had
[2:01:06] a vision and actually saw Lazarus died
[2:01:09] he saw him dead hallelujah so he waited
[2:01:13] four days before he did anything and
[2:01:15] they sent before why he was sick they
[2:01:18] said before they buried him Jesus come
[2:01:20] and do something about our brother
[2:01:21] Lazarus you'd love our family come to
[2:01:24] some Jesus delayed the process
[2:01:26] hallelujah Jesus shows up four days
[2:01:29] later and when it gets there Martha
[2:01:33] begins to say Oh God Lord if you hadn't
[2:01:35] been here I know my brother was not a
[2:01:37] doctor
[2:01:37] I know you went to die I mean he would
[2:01:40] you know I'm tell you it would have been
[2:01:42] over if you would have been here he'd
[2:01:43] see so he say you say it say Martha let
[2:01:47] me just get this real quick hallelujah
[2:01:49] Amen Johnny leaven here glory I want to
[2:01:53] make sure we got this real real good
[2:01:55] Oh before we got before I go yeah you
[2:01:57] say say Martha lord help us Jesus that
[2:02:02] was it says she he says that brother
[2:02:06] shall rise again right you take mother
[2:02:08] so your brother died rather you say
[2:02:09] mother said now
[2:02:10] know that he'll rise again in the
[2:02:12] resurrection at the last day
[2:02:14] now while Martha's having this
[2:02:15] conversation with the Lord Jesus Mary is
[2:02:18] still inside the house crying Mary is
[2:02:20] still working through a feelings
[2:02:22] Mary is still working through her
[2:02:24] emotions mary has not moved from her her
[2:02:28] company of mortars hallelujah it's time
[2:02:33] for some of y'all to move from your
[2:02:35] company of mourners because in the
[2:02:39] company of Mormons that mourners the
[2:02:41] supernatural is not going to happen but
[2:02:44] you have to come out from a midst of the
[2:02:46] company of mourners you feel bad you
[2:02:50] just want to you I mean misery loves
[2:02:54] company you will have to shake yourself
[2:02:58] out of that when will you deal with a
[2:03:02] company mother's day and not you with
[2:03:04] the wrong spirit actually stuff you
[2:03:07] believe with your monster company molars
[2:03:10] it's hard to expect incredible it's hard
[2:03:14] to believe really impossible when you
[2:03:16] are look stir company of mortars we're
[2:03:20] gonna have to break off some of the
[2:03:21] relationships in 2020
[2:03:25] [Applause]
[2:03:27] Mary stayed there amongst the company of
[2:03:30] more mortars Martha say let me get up
[2:03:33] out of here
[2:03:33] they say Jesus was here and she went
[2:03:37] running to Jesus at night you being my
[2:03:38] brother would've died it's saying say
[2:03:40] you say it says your brother don't rise
[2:03:43] again and mother said now I'm know he is
[2:03:46] I believe in the resurrection and in the
[2:03:48] last day you know here he'll come he'll
[2:03:50] come again Jesus said no I am the
[2:03:51] resurrection and the life and he that
[2:03:54] believeth on me though he were dead yet
[2:03:56] shall he live and so what we found out
[2:03:58] about the resurrection it is a person
[2:04:01] the resurrection is the person of the
[2:04:03] Lord Jesus hallelujah not an event a
[2:04:06] person you need to know this person if
[2:04:15] you want to be resurrected so here they
[2:04:21] are all having this conversation now and
[2:04:22] I love this because when Jesus said I am
[2:04:25] verse 25 just give me John 11:25
[2:04:28] says Jesus said in her I am the
[2:04:30] resurrection and the life he that
[2:04:33] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[2:04:36] shall he live and whosoever liveth and
[2:04:39] believeth in me shall never die
[2:04:41] believe it down this now martha has to
