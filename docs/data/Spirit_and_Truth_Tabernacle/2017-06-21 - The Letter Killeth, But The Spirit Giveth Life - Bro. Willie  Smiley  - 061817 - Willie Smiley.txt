wonderful name we pray amen and amen amen that's be our music I'm happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning a man there's no other place I'd rather be a man this morning but in the house of the Lord I don't know about you but I'm grateful that God saw fit to call me amen in this hour that we're living in he didn't have to do it but it did he could have allowed me you know the way that I was going and I probably wouldn't even be here but I'm so grateful we just want to as you get your Bibles out this morning just say Happy Father's Day to all and fathers I do not have I'm not a traditionalist I don't do things by tradition I don't have a Father's Day message for you this morning unfortunately not not that I couldn't prepare one there's a lot of things I understand about fatherhood and I could have preached out a Father's Day message but it wasn't on my heart none this week I do that at home sometimes we have those special days Easter and all of that and I just do not unless I'm directly inspired I don't do it but we have to preach godly men and on sometimes brothers you know maybe not even godly men but good men and good fathers that that goes a long way out and so we appreciate you guys this morning we salute you we trust that the wife and the children treat you well go the extra mile I see it's a lot of emphasis this morning I you know I don't know what that's all about but praise the light I know yeah I got no members in this well y'all look quite on y'all a little quiet on me already now ain't even got started preaching yet not everybody cry yes I think everybody know me maybe set for the young lady right here in the front I'm brother smiley but everybody else know me so y'all oh yeah I don't get to tighten to quieten and all that stuff like that I'm here to be a blessing to y'all this morning I'm not your past I'm just here standing in for him amen on special occasions and if sometimes you can't get here carving bra bra that you can stand in love me it's hard to tell brother Jack no like man I got my own touch the past is new so it's a hot you know one of those days when you get selfish we wanna passionately but I sometimes I like the opportunity to get away from from my church and and and don't bring nobody where I could just check out I don't have to worry about what I say you know how to dull it down I can say let's turn to the book of second Corinthians so so if I feel like I'm a crazy man after a while don't worry about it I'm just I'm just blowing off a little steam but we just got a little thought this morning and it's good to see everybody it's good to see my classmate Linda Amen and I just want to keep her in prayer it been also husband not too long ago but we trusted God continue to give us strength second Corinthians chapter 3 now y'all pray for me because I kind of I've kind of been on a Bible series and I'm in 2nd Corinthians and we want to maybe just read one verse to 6 verse and I have you be seated I says who also has made us able ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kills but the Spirit given for life made a lot of the blessing to the reading of his words you may be seen this morning I we want to use that as a topic the letter killeth but the Spirit give it for life but I want to maybe for a few seconds background this scripture for a moment I like to say we've been on a little I don't think I'm a serious preacher but we've kind of been working through the Bible and trying to help folk to understand the scriptures I don't think it's just enough to be in church to be identified with the church and not really have a understanding of why you're here and and what's actually going on and what's actually taking place I don't think that that's enough I don't think God called us just to be good church members but I think that God called us to equip us to be able to go out and express him to the world that right I'm just touch this real briefly and imma get into our thought and then we're going to get out of here we started out in 2nd Corinthians chapter 1 where the believing Church they kind of had a little issue with Paul because they they felt like he he was a little fickle and somebody that wasn't faithful he wasn't a man of his word and we took that as a topic and and you know I think when we look at the scriptures every you know everything in the Bible has a season and I think that you know God God allowed Paul because what was actually taking place was that Paul told the believers that he was he was going to come and then he was going to go to Macedonia and then he was going to come back through on his way back right but he following the leadership of the Holy Spirit he didn't come back that way and that's three sermons that I'd have to preach but I just want to touch this little point right quick and the thing of the thing of it was they felt like Paul Paul wasn't a man of his word and and I think it's so important for us as believers to be faithful and to meet I think that's important to be if nothing else be faithful be men and women of your word you you are your word your word I remember when I was growing up in New Jersey and we I was kind of young and we should kind of just throw things out there word is born and we could be lied but word is born with a straight face word is born brother word is Belling know you like with your fingers crossed behind your back word is born man put you're lying but we what we did not know that the depths of that you you you're no better than your word huh you're no better than your word I believe that God requires faithfulness faithful people I think that that that we're living in a time now where um people aren't as faithful as they used to be we we don't we don't see the gospel for what it really truly is in this hour what we're finding is people are making a whole lot of excuses but God requires faithfulness right and let me tell you something even as a body as a church body uh you should require that right that should be the standard of the church that we be faithful from the way your head such the way your head right that because there's a standard that's got to be a hold in the Church of the Living God and I think that that we all have a part in it I don't care if you younger all to make sure that people are being faithful faithful to God faithful to smell people to relationships faithful apparently all glory to his wonderful name how many believe that this morning hey man they they they were they were a little upset with with Paul but they didn't really understand some other message I'm gonna move on from that but I just want to drop that on right quick because I think when when we first became Christians brother Troy you know we were faithful now I'm not changed but I'm just friends folk have changed I have not changed I've been faithful for 28 years are you perfect both smile I didn't say that I just say I'm faithful I'm faithful you can get a hold of me I'll be in church when the church doors open I'll be there huh you hope you won't find me if I'm going on vacation I'm gonna find me somewhere where I can go on working because I feel funny when I can't go give God praise one day out the week at least well huh well I'm on vacation how can you ever go on vacation from God huh we get we get so caught up in worldly ism that we forget that we're serving a risen Savior hmm be faithful let's let's not make excuse well see you know I forget all about that see God God allows things that happen to try you anyway to try to try you to see where you are a man uh in your Christian walk that right um just this morning we we're preaching on the letter kills but the spirit giveth life and and you know if this is something my prints to sermons on this at home and I thought that this would be appropriate for this morning to try to help us to see what the gospel really is and how important this understanding is for us I just shouting I enjoy good singing like sister Tina sixteen was walking with I'm like wow sometimes if you want I give me just a little bit of the microphone pass off you know like running a race let me get my porch in the inner voice the voice was acting up when I walked up but that's I but I just I just I just like anything that pertains to church but but I think it's important for us to really understand the the fullness of the gospel and and and and what we have and how we're supposed to be operating amen as believers right like I say we shouted we scream we rolled on the flo we've not it we've done all of that right and that's wonderful but but you know that don't get you that far apart from understanding see if because if you don't understand that still the world can still have a we're gonna pull it anyway right but but you have no resistance apart from your understanding Amen why why he with the Corrine died for you he um I want to just strike something because I think that you know it's real funny that that and I've been around a little while and I might accept sometimes you you have to change the way that people look at things and the way that people approach thing a lot of times our mindset when we come to church we come to church uh just looking for some great swelling something some some great some great mystery that's been broken by the walk I'd say boy that was a deep that was aa you know how we do oh brother ah did you hear that did you hear that sermon did you see how he taught those quotes together he taught in Scripture with this quote with this oh my and then a lot of times you actually but what did he really actually free the world that's another story right and I believe in sermons and I believe in sunders we got to have Furman's we got to have good teaching because those are the things that that anchor us right but but but Paul is going to bring us up into something that I think is important for us right because he's talking about ministry right if you go back and really do some research and studying even in your footnotes if you've got a Scofield Bible us a part of the outline is dealing with ministry and I think people don't don't really understand ministry but I will help you this morning right and y'all don't quit angle be long if you if you don't quit I won't be low but if y'all start getting tired I'm gonna just preach for y'all no good why - our message now I ain't got two hours in me I've been going all weekend oh now watch this this this statement the property makes him and speak to the rock he says so that we can understand the gospel in its entirety you say the gospel it's not all together the word right amen sometimes you know it's like the word way it's more to it than just the way right Amen he says now the gospel is not all to get a little word he said now this is the Word of God and all things must be based upon the world right all things must be based upon and see this is where I think people misunderstand the Ministry of Malachi for right a part of what his ministry was all about is to base all of our understanding on something because you can't really have faith you really don't have faith unless you can have you'll it based upon something but faith has got to be based on something right I'm coming here has got to be based on something it's not you've gotta be able to base your entire Amen existed somewhere - something I see I'm here because of description but I come to church because of this scripture I'm saved because of these scriptures see I got somewhere to base the soul so that when people come you know are and kind of criticize and downplay you know wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute let me take you right here let me take you right here let me take you right here let me take you right here see my my understanding is based on something right faith has got to be based upon the Word of God what you believe has got to be based upon the Word of God it's not destined emotions emotions don't dukkha will always feel emotional but we got to have somewhere to base coming to church and what we believe in our stand if you don't you're not going to a man make it right Amen but that ain't in it all alone in itself right that's not the complete gospel but that's important how many can say amen to that see you can you can you you can be emotional you could come to the altar you could scream it's not singing all of that sometimes these things were in me they worried me when I see people get up get off the altar from screaming and howling and snarling all of this and then the other and then you don't see them no more we work in the church we do different things in the church and things of that makes it in next thing you know we disappear we leave we better than Houdini this right and I think the reason why is because it's just emotions it's just meant to with pursuing and we haven't found any place to base all of this home see and then if you don't you're still searching you're still seeking it and then you think it's out dance not out there I'm a living witness to that it's not out there that's dead the wages of sin is still dead but there's a true gift that's been given us eternal life right and note that no matter how how much you seek it out there you're not going to find it see because God places our thirst is us and only God can quench the thirst ah you know we could go along with let me get up I want nobody say bugs finally coming to beat us up today but but you know you want people to be sure see and then 20 some years of ministry and a being around a different types of meetings and seeing people and crying this and that knowledge of that and and then you don't see them right then you see people in church you know for a good little minute and then all of a sudden they disappear why because it was emotional it was sensation but they don't have any place to base that on not that that it's not here if the fist is it's the job of the ministry to take the Word of God and try to anchor so it's something that's beyond just emotional sensation and this is the thing that I preach to my church all the time because we see people at my brother Westco meetings getting ready to come and buy focus and we get all worked up for July hmm we we can't serve God to Jew like um well we can't be happy about church to Jew like uh-huh we can't give God praise we can't Amen the pastor to Jew like you know when do not get getting ready to roll around you know folks are you know halfway willing to give God praise uh we get we get this you know I want to be in the in the cloud nine we can't hardly hear you when just the regular song service but now we want to be in the quad all glory to God somebody say priests brush smiling uh but what are you doing the rest of the year this you know what that's a sacrifice huh that's fat to be able to serve God one weekend out of the year to kill god oh oh one weekend out of the year that's a shame that's a second uh man I want to serve God every time I walk through the door you know sister Bernie sing a song I can hardly wait to the church doors open to the singing in the shouting the praising begin you know that night know what I'm going to church the next day man I get restless brother through I came just to say I don't know where you go preach but but I'm not I can't wait to get down it used to be a time I'm sure you know when we should go back go to those meetings brunch artena you know we're young people back then now we we the grandparents and all that kind of stuff but back then we were the young people you know and you go to the meetings and man it's like soon as you start here people you could feel it in the in the other term you could just feel it and why when the music the music stop playing man I can't even contain myself they clear homes at the park no they stop loving it big time it didn't I taken it in a song he says now we're gonna keep you staying home now hey man man you know you you got a publican pious and all be that alone oh no I ain't gonna come to proof that that's the way that give me that all time cup see see see see see y'all have been with me y'all suppose that been with me huh glory to God that Achilles I'll be keep moving I I take a side ball you in a minute I you know I'm an inspirational preacher I just go where he lead me where he leads me that's where I'll go but he says now the Gospels not all again little world so this is the word I'm going to believe that and all things must be based upon the word if it isn't it isn't true right no matter what you know no matter how much we come here if we don't have a word based to what we believe it don't mean nothing right y'all don't quit on me right see so that's why it's important that when brother Jack is preaching bastard on the right that stepped out you go back and study it yourself you prayer with those different things you just don't want to take for granted you know that you're part of something that that meant not be true hmm but if you if you could find it in the Word of God if you could find it in the Word of God you know you got yourself something right you know you've got yourself something and like I was saying I think that that that was a part of what the Ministry of Malakoff war was all about the turning of the heart was to get us away from the traditions right and denominationalism which you cannot base on the word right you cannot tie denominationalism back to the word come on you cannot do it right god never started a denomination man every denomination was started by man if you go back to the book of Acts uh they were just given the name of Christians right after the people in that surrounding saw the life of Christ on display right amen but it wasn't low denomination it was no Baptists no method is no perfect Aryan no this though that God never started that right amen God just established word abiding believers he established a church based upon the principles of the word what he had given to them right amen but denominationalism he never spied see and so this is this is why we needed a seer to help us to see the era not the really dis Christian Isis but to show us if we're true believers will come to the world as we see that the light will walk therein see amen but it wasn't that he was trying to dismiss Christian either but to give us a basis for what we say we believe right amen you go here why hmm you over here why huh God is feeding me okay show me and it can't be emotion right it's got they stood on the Word of God John leading hmm right cuz all things I just read it has got to be based upon the Word of God yo stands what you believe why you go to a certain place why you do certain things why you act the way that you a right you gotta be able to base it upon the scripture what I hope I get the way I want to go you got to be you got to be able to base it upon the scripture now you talk to me I can base my what I believe in wife and write on the Word of God I don't have no problems with that but see we don't want you to have any problems with that because we're no different than any of the age right when when Paul and Peter preached they said you know Grievous wolves would raise up you you would have these false anointed ones and things of that nature that will rise up and influence right influence not the true believer because the true believers has basis stand upon the word and what he believes on the Word of God right it can't just be intellectual conception hmm well I believe in Jesus why the devil do too in trouble well praise the Lord I'm trying to letter killeth but the spear to give it a life in that man I tell you what after the day you just get to give you something to think about right that's that's just beyond just a sermon and just preaching because we've had that long enough just that nut road that we need that right but I'm trying to take us somewhere right to help us when we come to church and and and we we hear sermons we hear scriptural principles that's being related to we have to have another mindset right but I'm still working I think y'all gonna work me good today all right but he says but Jesus says go into the world and preach the gospel to every creature and I didn't say peach he did say teach in one place but what he's actually alluding to is to demonstrate right because because we I think what we've done we've placed so much emphasis on a great sermon and why wasn't that deep but not realizing that's not the full thing right see and see Paul says he says I didn't come to you our excellent lead of speech right because Paul realized the full gospel and only exists when it it's the word and the manifestation of the world one can't our one doesn't work to the exclusion of the other right amen but one is is what is in completely they work as they come together right but the word in the manifestation of the word they work as they come together and see I think we've been so carried away and and and and we so become so ritualistic that man I was deep and he was shallow and he was des and he ain't that and we're missing the God and this is why people eyes are wrecked up because we when we come to church we don't really realize sometimes what what we were supposed to be looking for when we come right in so it's good to hear sermon he's supposed to come to hear a sermon I made I made a reference I was using the statement the Prophet make and he was talking about we come to church to find out our faults we come to church to find out our faults and you know we was having a little study and somebody raised their hand say fellas fine that's confusion I understand my fault not fully it couldn't tell you something sure y'all fully know y'all you said what how can that be God knows you better than you know yourself huh God can take you deeper deeper to your understanding of yourself right because we have you know sometimes issues and things that we go through God can take you so deep and really open that thing up to you is such a way under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit to set you free well I know Lee and I this and I did you do for God knows you better than you know yourself how many believe that God knows the very intimate details right and God also knows how to set you free from the things a man that's got folk down do y'all believe that that I believe that so so when we say well we come to church to to find out our faults I believe that because because God you know I take for instance there was a time where the prophet of God was working with a lady who had a nervous condition right and went to doctors and didn't realize what you know how she to be in this condition right she knows she had a problem but it took God to come down on the scene and said you know what you nervous because the dog got actually when you was young y'all ought to talk to me something just that simple adult chase you when you were young you running from a dog calls you to be nervous as an adult huh she couldn't go deep enough to find the calls for God could and expose it in order to set us free he set me free set me free God can go deeper than we can in our intellectual conception of quick eyes individuals right Oh glory to his name I hope y'all are right this morning y'all just play with them but i'ma go as far as I can give me about 20 minutes and I'm let's go this morning but but we're talking about the letter killeth right and see uh the gospel is not all together the word now hold of your thoughts right amen see look we were just saying so the gospel could system more then teaching the word Wow it's more to it than that yes it's mo to ingest teaching the workbook right for Paul confirming says that gospel came not to us not in word only right not in I think sometimes people come to church too just to hear a sermon in Gwaltney I write with just discernment but right there all right for just discernment see the sermon has got to become a reality and if the sum is don't become a reality then God is not God and it's not the gospel it is fullness cut right the gospel is not in word only see and in it and if we don't if we don't have our minds altered then we gonna be in trouble right cuz we'll come in here sermon and go alright go right out brother Jack please preach a wonderful sermon he started a motion making things so I can have y'all shouting in the next 5 minute right cuz I know how to appeal to the humanistic part of humanity but I ain't here to do that this morning I'm here to just kind of give us something that'll help us to go further right see you met me go to school to learn a psychology they know what to feed you to stimulate stimulate you to make you stop wait ha ha ha ha and then get that money out your pocket they know how to do that they get go to get training I can do that too but I'm not not here to do that all right you know I'll try to get folks something that that'll carry them right weekly something that carry us when when the hard times come when the troubles come when it feel when the thing like our world is falling apart you got something that'll carry you huh amen you know David had something to carry him David David was confronted with a situation where where him and the brother was out and the enemy came in and took his whole household and the household of children and everything out and the brother and got mad at him said why we ought to just kill you David you know that's pressure when your friends and your co-workers and everybody turned it back on you but but David had something huh David has them said you know what I might be by myself right now but I've learned only clarify up in the Lord and see this is this is the thing that I try to bring the people give them another God write a love word that you know it you can encourage yourself when you buy yourself but you can't get a hold of the pastor Amen you've been given enough something to encourage yourself because it look like it's not always gonna be easy huh amen life is not going to be easy always we gonna have our ups and our down and let me tell you something when when just seem like your world is being turned upside down it reveals to true you it really shows who you really are when did you seem like the devil coming at you from every side and you can still stand and overcome it really shows what's the real you cuz you know it's easy to come to church and feel good about things when you got money in your pocket and and and in a good job and you you're feeling you know it my god that don't reveal the true you right yes hi man I got a you know meal I was in the bank I'm riding good and everything else you know but but you know like Joe Joe had it good Joe was doing wonderful very good I had a lot stuff so that a lot of stuff then then then God said hey where you been I'll just go to afro you know I'm just wreaking havoc everywhere I can huh well okay well I see you've been all over have you considered my servant ooh huh right got confidence in Joel Oh have you considered joke why I look better but like you got your hands about them and everything and I imitation I'm moving out the way you can do anything you want to do to it but whatever you just don't take a shot huh all of a sudden those standing then Joe feeling like Wyatt all this way I could imagine him saying it all is well y'all know how we do we get real deep with it we've been leaning in rocking with it we have heard a message money in a pocket shoes on our feet clothes on our back everything good right good the car riding good the chin doing good and then all of a sudden here come a bad report job have you just looked and then in an instant and instant world turned upside down high globe is an but Joe you know what Joe Joe was a worship boy huh yeah you know when he told him told him about his children you know way back when they were cutting up and everything he does his pre invention dang doing it's supposed to be doing well I was just gonna go down and intercede on their behalf huh that's real father ain't it real father pray for is choosing that's your father's day missing real quick inspiration a real father pray for his children a real father standing this gap regardless of their condition a real a real father you know a real father has to go through some stuff with their children yeah when they doing things that that boy you know you realize you raise them a certain way in there but a real father standing the gap for seeing real you know what a real father knows where he's based is in C he's been given a promise right a man and see this is why the gospel is not in just word only but in in demonstration in power right you got somewhere to base Sitapur yeah they doing this but but the wife says and that that's why I'm standing in I'm standing with the word save I got a promise from the children huh well I say what well we just got a good word today but did you really get a good word today I just see it something all right you could get a good word today and leave out of here you ain't really got nothin cuz you heard it but you didn't hear it y'all don't believe that you can hear it and not hear it right because you know you don't get the results see I want the results right I want the results from the sermon if I don't get the result from the sermon then it's not the gospel because they work as they come together see but the I think I think we watch this he says in order to preach the gospel before you can make it the gospel preach then you've got to have the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost to prove the gospel Wow see I'm gonna keep going he's had a fella killer thing in the spirit make it to life so it's just not a ritualistic affair and and I'm kind of convinced that we've made this thing a ritualistic of half hmm we've got our low rituals howl things that we do yeah y'all don't quit on me now we we got this little ritual everything's just ritual right we come to church we sit in off the same seat I paint little areas huh everything about it you know we come up and we sing songs and and and 30 minutes I know you got to have order but I'm just saying how we could make this thing ritualistic and not inspiring well I got to sing I got to sing - 30 minutes and then I gotta bring the preacher huh well what if God want to come 40 minutes cook custom eater don't bring me up an OD atmosphere if you take 45 minutes sang another tip I'd be sometimes even at home I'd be like love somebody gets up out of night to do something you know so that when I walk up there I can walk up in an atmosphere but you know sometimes it's like we've made it so ritualistic it's like time to make the doughnuts we got how we come to church time to make the doughnuts we like brother Jack I'm here is the Lord hallelujah so you have to wonder man come on man you need to go back out to do hmm huh with people y'all don't believe that we can make church corner ritualistic affair where's in Sunday's by the ritualistic we know we don't have this ritualistic with with no real sign no real joy no real conviction no real attention ritual time to make the donuts I've been behind you know how people in BA been working on this job for 20 year on tires we lost the joy of it everything up I was talking to a lady principal last week at our family family reunion thing they had a white family and uh she was saying that you know she was a principal and she was 30 minutes cry before she got to go to work in 30 minutes cry on the way home I said that's bad what you got to stop and cry for 30 minutes ho you walk in the building this is and then on your way home you got to stop fighting minutes to get it out that's right you know lost all the joy the joy of it see that's got to be a giant coming to church see if it get ritualistic you're gonna start dreading coming to spirit through tabernacle you gonna stop dreading it all he comes rojack when he go say today I know that mother Jack I know he know he's gonna do this and may I tell you what see who told him who told him I know somebody telling on me huh baby you just it's so easy to just get caught up right hope this helped you free up how it's supposed to be revival but we could get so carefree and ritualistic and and it don't mean anything and then when brother Jack Dupree something whatever that's our attitude see we we people have gotten to the place now what people don't really respect the presence of God anymore huh your Caprice crying brimstone all you want to people just sit there look at you it used to be tired you'll even mention hell and people that went right they'd be like man please I ain't leaving this building like this now you can preach your heart out Walker turn the head up and keep on going good sermon good son see that's not the way it should be right never make it ritualistic right I wanted as it pertains to God just to be ritualistic man I want to be in such a place that I can meet God in my cost ride down the street you ever been riding down the street man and and and a song is something commerce up come to your mind how good god has been to you and you just water start yelling with me this morning water start rolling down your eyes and yet I saw getting blue everything you have to pull over sometimes you just be me over on the side of the road boohoo Jesus but I remember I remember not too long ago maybe a few months ago four five months ago I was working up in a Louisiana for a friend of mine and uh oh like this while I to break down if I do the water by I got to talking to him because his brother his brother was struggling with crack cocaine and if you have a smoked crack you know what I'm talking about he his brother was his brother was struggling with crack and and and I was just telling the church of a few weeks ago I was just telling to church by some experiences I had when I was on cracking high how people treated me and things of that nature my family and all it and my uncle being a pastor I live with him and work with him in and instead of him being in a position to help me spiritually he was he was it was he was who he was though he was just immature and and and you know I knew that I had a problem but he should have been in a position to help me but instead you know I know he not be working and I blow it off for money on a weekend going you owe crack we get the call and you boys don't care if you got to pay the light bill the water bill no other beer hey I gotta have it all huh and and and some on my team on I'd be broke but I was a workhorse I was the hardest work on the team Bobby hungry boy hey no I ain't got no food he would help me I know that I was his right not to help me but sometimes I mean I you know I was like the woman that was willing to take the scraps all right but he throw it in the garbage Bobby see that a lot and no he just wrote all that right to the goddess knowing I'm hungry and laughing at me and I was testifying to the church and so when I went to Louisiana by the time I got there the young man had went off we don't spend all his money somehow he had got to the who the finest of the smell right and and his brother his brother was having a hard time with he was wrong I'm not saying it right but she being a Christian I felt like you know it and sometimes we gotta overlook those things right let's hope you know I couldn't see the man I know what it's like to be on crack and hungry and walking he will work it like there's no way in the world I got money I'm gonna sit here and watch this young man uh not eat and and so I got that I got the shakes I'm show you how powerful God is I got to share this thing with his brother we live in a house and he wasn't the other brother that was on drugs he wasn't nowhere around but I was sharing it with his brother and I got to talking about it just to show you amen I the kind of God we serve and just being in a place with God I got to Sheridan and then God brought all of that back tomorrow remember and when he did I got choked up and I just I just boohoo like a baby and he couldn't understand like what's going on he didn't realize he was in the presence of God and it was too full whoo it was conviction to him but it was a black in the face what just talking about it see God tried me see that not realizing God allowed that to happen not to God forced him to get high but God know that I was coming God knew my story and God says you know what I'm gonna try you I'm gonna say exactly what you gonna do I'm gonna see if you gonna let this man go hungry like your uncle used to let you go home I couldn't do it I couldn't do it God came down and the more I talked about the more I cried and he was oh well I'm sorry I'm oh man I mean I'm like dude you and even though what's going on here this is the presence of the Lord amen just baptizing me once again huh we got to be in such a relationship with God that God come come down amen you know who Oh your bedroom in your car in the cash room when you when you left you know when you ain't even thinking about it and once up here he comes I don't know we even serve that kind of God anymore hmm do we

with people about the altar I know it's somebody out there I give you five minutes you five seconds why because if it's God you ain't go sit in your seat and wait for 15 people to go to the altar before you decide to get up when it's God you you ain't gonna be ashamed of who's looking at you and what people care all you know man I need something drops a lot today right I need God to come down you tell me yeah ain't it sometimes it only have to do with saying we think every time somehow to come to the altar well what did I'm done help and you ain't glass that you just need a pat you know when you're in relationship every now and again you just need to say may unite the desk shot shoot huh touch you to your arms around you you know they'd always gotten safely the human touch had power yes the human touch amen you know a baby you know to his mother the human touch it can't relate itself but a man the comfort it has in the human touch sometimes I just need God to touch me huh to throw his arms around me and when nobody has told me in a minute it's gonna be I you're gonna be I huh I know I didn't say alright I said I huh God comes down towards on siscon bi huh I promise see cuz this is this is the gospel I'll never leave you nor forsake in 28 years God has never forsaken me I'm going through some things as a pastor man I've gone through things huh amen sometimes you know you get full sex level I want to be a preacher you show I want to be I feel the air and be a pastor you show you better check it huh you better check it cook it hot it get hard if you ain't cold to certain things don't attempt it because you ain't gonna make it sometimes I think you know people see see people doing certain things and it look easy I remember one time my brother-in-law Vaughn I took him to work some years ago try and he saw me taking the mud off the hawk supply look easy right here how you get it off for there I thought you just said it look easy huh some sometimes you know with we're dealing with with our children that our children nowadays our children nowadays I tell you what they don't realize sometimes what they got because sometimes we make it look easy they don't know you struggle they don't know that they don't know sometimes you struggle but sometimes you you just make things look easy they don't realize boy it's a lot that goes along with fatherhood though I'll tell you something it's a lot it's a lot that goes along with manhood and being a man and being a husband and being a father that's a whole lot sometimes you know I'm gonna get up out of here sometimes sometimes you know I'm gonna give you your father's day passing right quick and I'm a dad sometimes you know what young man I feel like we're you know I see it nicely as young lady I won't get mad do you really you better talk to somebody but talk to somebody got some grand a beard huh you better get some information first huh cuz because man the walking down the aisle and everybody up here looking clothing all that man that even the marriage huh that's just little ceremony as you say I do then here come the devil and then when I'm look the little red rash I got it hello huh man and you got to have something that you Basin a man husband own fatherhood oh man who it all you know what D this is why our our young men are in the condition that they're in because they do not have anything to base being a man oh you have to thank God for true fatherhood you know I didn't have a good father I didn't I didn't have a good father he would like a ho like I didn't have a good father I didn't have a good example before me but you know what it in the back part of my mind I knew that you know what looking at him is the indication of what I do not want to be and quite as it kept I was going in that same footsteps into God and it has been God these last years and sometimes you know my children they don't understand me they think I'm crazy man I'm tough I mean I'm it's like one day when you get where I am you're gonna be able to look back and said you know what I had a good daddy and I just couldn't recognize him I couldn't understand him right I been through some stuff I've been through some stuff right sometimes even as a pastor you know my own church they look at me like this guy's this is how understand us now I've been through some stuff I mean I I love from both standpoint I know the world I know Church and because of what I understand I fight hard against the devil is trying to white people out and people don't understand that people they see your emotions and everything and not realizing you want Amen on their behalf cuz you see what the enemy is trying to doing sometimes they think you know we think that a pastor somebody that's supposed to be some passive is somebody that just go let us do what we want to do in that whole prayer car that ain't no pass tonight oh man they love you oh man I really love you you saying go go that you really love you gonna let them stand in the street and get struck down by a cop telling love me come on we don't got it jacked up in this hour but a real man of God was standing behind the pulpit if it has hot up and preach you to unsearchable riches of Jesus Christ that's what that's a real man but the real Full Gospel is not a word only but his demonstration in power where when the word is preached watching God I'm a closed watching God come behind that and confirm his word making making that preach word a living reality that's the gospel not I don't give me the sermon but after the sermon I want to see God if in the family says he'll have a church without spot or wrinkle or any such thing I want to be identified with that and I want to see that come to pass if it don't it ain't the gospel if God says Amen that ah he's a healer if I could said I want to see God come on the scene and confirm his word make that a living reality if not this not the Full Gospel right if God has spoken concerning a body change in a rapture and he don't do it he ain't God he's like God huh but I've got it sadi and he said it he's got to be true to his word he it's got to be a living reality God the supernatural power of God coming on the scene see we've we've made it we've made it intellectual right and this is why people aren't getting control II converted huh because we've made the Gospel intellectual hmm and used to go back and study that the history of revivals when the Pentecostal revival started amen in 1906 back at Azusa Street man people were a man getting truly sane transform change free the revival has not stopped huh I'm in a revival and see my expectation in your expectation should be seeing people walk through those doors and be changed you witness for somebody you washed up the power of influence right your human testimony you'll miss your middle life because you're Ricky Pistols reading on it of all men p-people watch a little like weaving her sermons huh we're homeless but we want to see the effects if we're not seeing the effects of the surgeons we need to stop preaching huh cuz it's because all we got is didn't matter right and people are dying for every sermon we should be under expectation if within a sermon the things that we graph the promises has been spoken we should be under expectations for the manifestation of the sermons the supernatural power of God moving in to confirm his word because he says where I won't return to avoid but then in accomplish not just an editor letter killeth see the letter kill it but amen but the Spirit we want the Spirit of God moving in on the work to confirm the word if not we just got dead ritualistic sermons and no changes no changes in the life let me tell you something search you just come here all you want to and if God's not changing your life you are not going in the rapture huh because you have got to be in a condition to go in the rapture come into churches not allow see modern modern-day ministry have water the thing down so much man that is sad that people in bad shape in charge of all people and you trusted God be merciful what true ministry recognizes that look man you got to be in rapturing condition that's got to be a life be like music Cisco there's got to be a life behind the name you got to be able to see changes if not we won't be going to no rapture huh see because the rapture the rapture is a change we know rap Shane in the Bible right it talks about being changed in the moment of of a twinkling of an eye but the changes got to be taking place on a constant basis right see I realize you know this morning I'm being rapped there's a rapture going on within me you said I'll see like me you got to be able to see it and understand by revelation you got to be seeing your change can you say I can see my change not the next person's change your change you got to be able to see where I'm being changed from glory to glory I'm not what I was yesterday can you say that well I'll tell you what that was kind of rough that was kind of rough those kind of rough ladies ain't a trick thing you gotta be able I talking about brother justice change the first change your own you got to be able to look at your own personal life and know if it ain't but one any beating step you know what I've made a step in the right direction hmm can you say that you know what I know I'm not what I supposed to be but I could look back on last month and know I've made one step in the right direction and I know man when the Trump of God shine I'll be there when if I'm if I'm alive and remaining right I know that may not be clicking I'll get another body out meet the group in the air if you can't say that church you better go farther in God you bet because it's not it's not religion y'all loving this morning I tell you what boy I feel I feel good this morning I feel good it's the gospel is not just some word only yeah I got that much I know I kind of been a little all over the place but I'm not home when I'm home my own kind of state right but I realize it's not that only but it's in demonstration and power of the Holy Spirit when God could come into this word and make the word live making a living reality if it ain't a living reality man we don't have ourselves mud we didn't need to we need to put the locks on the dope stop painting man and stop cutting that right come on y'all give me
