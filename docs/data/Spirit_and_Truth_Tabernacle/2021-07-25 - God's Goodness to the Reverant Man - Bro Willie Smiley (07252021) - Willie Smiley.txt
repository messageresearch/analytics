much of a singer you know brother troy that that'll be all i won't say anymore brother truck came back and asked me this morning like johnson's gonna be here i was like nope it's on you yeah y'all should tell her brother something so i said that's why i keep i keep a little list of songs you know in my song book and everything and he said man this list look by the old i say it is it is it's about three years old i say when i'm called on the spot i look down my list for some inspiration and uh from there you know things will start coming so amen we appreciate the lord appreciate i mean appreciate brother troy amen we appreciate his diligence amen his steadfastness and uh i don't know about y'all but how many enjoy brother troy on wednesday night amen amen i was sitting back there and uh i was just listening to this mess we're gonna be looking in the book of psalms chapter 25. i said man i know john put that thing together i was saying i told him he called me and uh because i i was just i told him i said uh i had to make sure i be here to be supportive you know we got to support one another especially in the ministry and i knew that you know brother jack was not going to be here and so uh brother quiku is not here and so you know i guess i'm i'm kind of one of the elders i'm probably the eldest in the ministry period so uh but with brother jack not being here i wanted to make it my business i cut out of work a few minutes early to be support because i know how it is amen when you're ministering to be able to look out and have you know just brothers there you know the pastor and different things to trying to cheer you on because sometimes you say things and the laity they don't cheer you on well y'all don't say amen it's the truth anyhow y'all just kind of give a person a little look a little stale roll of the head a little maybe a little roll of the eyes too so we have to sometimes pull another brother through so uh but he didn't need any help uh he had the holy spirit and i watched how god inspired him and i i told him i said i might have to take that somewhere and preach it as my own maybe throw out yeah i got a little bit of this from brother troy but i i just appreciate what i see in brother troy amen and how god has brought him from a mighty mighty long way amen uh let's remember brother jack and brother uh i say colonel cause sometimes i forget his name uh quentin quinn and uh they having a good time praise god i say more power to him hey man one thing i know i ain't no missionary hey man i don't know how well i do back up in the bush and the jungles and mud and dirt and i'm good with the dirt in the mud when i'm working and my sister erica had us laughed and said she told brother jack to put some dirty clothes on traveling he didn't do it say by the time he got the way he was going he was the best i said well that's it for me amen y'all just continue to pray for him amen trust that god will just richly uh bless him and use him psalms 25 we want to read um uh maybe i don't know let's just read from verse one i was just got a few verses that i want to isolate but let's just it says unto thee oh lord do i lift up my soul oh my god i trust in thee let me not be ashamed let not my enemies triumph over me yea let none that wait on thee be a shame let them be let them be ashamed which transgress without a cause show me thy ways o lord teach me thy paths leave me in in thy truth and and teach me uh for thou art the god of my salvation o thee do i wait all the day remember oh lord thy tender mercies and thy loving kindness for they have been over uh they have whatever of old remember not the sins of my youth nor my transgression according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness sake o lord good and upright is the lord therefore what he teach the sinners therefore where he teach sinners in the way uh the meek will he god in judgment and the meek would he teach his way all the paths of the lord on our mercy and truth to such as keep his covenant and his testimonies for thy name's sake o lord part mind iniquity for it is great we can all say amen to that he said what man is he that feareth the lord him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose his soul shall dwell at ease and his seed shall inherit the earth the secret of the lord is with them that fear him and he will show them his covenant gracious father we just come to give thanks and praise this morning lord we have a little thought this morning but we know that the the gift is the ability to get yourself out of the way and so lord you know every heart this morning lord uh nothing is really premeditated we have a few things that we scribbled down but outside of that we don't know where you lead us this morning but we just want to trust us when it's all said and done lord god that you get the glory we just want to remember brother quinton and brother jack this morning pray that lord god they just continue to be a blessing lord and bless him and and give him travel to mercies also when it's their time to return back to the area watch over and keep them we pray for the brethren we just want to remember also our prayer requests the lord we also want to remember the brown family also and we be so ever able to give you the praise glory now in jesus name amen amen may be seated um i want to use as a little topic this morning um god's goodness to the reverent man i kind of heard this scripture and it just kind of stuck with me and i just kind of started praying about it knowing that we had to try to bring something that we trust that'll be a blessing to us this morning um i was thinking about i was thinking about david we know david in scripture he was king priest and prophet uh very gifted we know we know that uh he could play music and uh when his father-in-law got under a spirit he would just play play some music to kind of calm him down one thing about music music is soothing right i mean it don't take the place of the word but it has its place right sometimes you know you just find some good old songs you might be going through a little something and you might hear a little a song that'll just kind of really just settle settle your spirit down right because we we're living in the age where where folks uh uh anxious right anxious i might be tattled this morning and and and and just a real neurotic age everybody everybody is nervous and uptight and if you listen to the news media and all that they keep you all twisted that's why i don't get caught up in news i don't get caught up in politics cause i'm already so many other things that that want to keep me wound up and i want to be unwound i want to be at peace in my spirit i want to be at rest even amongst the things that just going on around me every day my my personal life my family and things of that nature things that you know i have no power to change i i was thinking about brother troy the other night and i thought that was powerful you know because i had some of the similar experiences i could understand you know when he was talking about the tender hand of jehovah my parents uh they separated that when i was six and you know when you young you know we don't really understand those different things you as a sinner we don't even begin to understand what the will of god is even sometimes when we finally get to god we don't really know what the perfect will of god is right we're going to go somewhere this morning amen but we i thank god that you know we've we've grown and we matured uh uh and we understand that amen god is a sovereign god you know you we used to hear the old timers say he's too wise to make a mistake and that's the truth is that right amen there's there's no knowledge that supersedes the knowledge of god right when when when god uh uh uh brought forth his plan he had a purpose there was nobody there that he could look to and consider right nobody is that right it was his plan and his purpose to be fulfilled so so you don't understand that apart from being redeemed though right we we kind of look at everything as a tragedy and we get to you know warm me and then you know sometimes people do do things with no regards to the people around them in their households and different things we we make moves and we do do things but god is in control god is it god is in control right regardless of our understanding or lack thereof god is still in control you know you got to thank god for predestination right as as much as much as i used to look at those uh situations that have a struggle i now that it was all working together cause that's the bible it might not be good but it'll work out for the good to them that love the lord and to call according to his purpose is that right that i was free that was from brother trump i was feeling inspired huh glory to god glory to god but but thinking of thinking about david you know in his ministry and his his gifts and and some of the things that the prophet of god he taught about gifted people right gifted people uh has to to to to climb up into a place in order to catch some inspiration and pin it and sometimes then i've heard sister burr say this some of her songs has been written out of uh despair hard times struggle most artists most artists write right out of of troublesome times pin some of the greatest songs amen out of trouble sometimes climb up to a rim and bring back masterpieces amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved the wretch like me uh uh eat the star spangled battle songs like that adversity right written out of adversity you know uh uh david no doubt being inspired because you know this is the book of redemption right and his inspiration right uh has to be in line with with god's patterns and god's plan my feelings good now just not something that's empty but something that's relevant something that's pertinent to uh our life right and and i kind of maybe want to read this scripture from a different translation you know sometimes i study from a little concordance uh uh on the internet to kind of get an idea because i'm not smart i didn't really go to bible school or anything like that so i have to use the tools at my resource where brother branham don't bring in things because we we i just want to get the thought behind the the writing sometimes and so uh this this scripture it read who is the man that fears fear if the lord right david david is written in the king james what man is he that fears but it's it's it's still in the form of of a question right and listen this question can only be answered from a a uh individual personal standpoint i can't answer this question for you i don't know y'all well enough to know amen whether or not you really feel or or uh the real definition is reverence it's not where oh god now that's not it it's it's a a reverence or a respect to the lord right and see only us as individuals uh can answer this now now and also i'll say this your life is an indication of how you reverence god come on right because the eyes of the lord is is everywhere and and just the life that that we live amen it speaks volumes you know i'm reminded of in a place brother branham say what what we need right is lived voices right because because he could see where where uh there was a lot of people that can quote quote scriptures if if you're knowledgeable or you know some people got photogenic memories i've i've heard brother danny reagan say one time where he could quote his entire bible verbatim page and and i'm like what i'm in thank god i'm in the paraphrase age you know what i mean age you know back back when when the prophet first went off the scene you couldn't get him brothers that you had brothers to come to the platform even when i first got converted in 1988 since the erica and all of them know brothers would come to the platform with a stack of books like this you had to you had to read it we had to know where it was coming from even if they misquoted it i mean misinterpreted it they at least they read it but thank god that we've we've grown and matured to a place uh to where we don't really have to do that now now anytime you want to ask me a question about anything i always have my material here for you to read it so you don't think i'm off the wall i just i'm crazy brother smiley don't know what he's talking about i been doing this a little while i do have some indication but we'll leave that alone all right so he he says who is the man that feareth the lord right and and i was thinking i was i was thinking about this and and and you know david could answer this question right because of the many experiences that he went through right uh a lot of times people don't reverence a thing or they don't reverence the lord because they don't have any real experiences that they can really by understanding look back and say that was god right even even though god is there all the time right god god is watching over his word to perform it but a lot of times because of people's inexperience right not being not being experienced they can't see god they can't see god amen at work working in their behalf right glow into his wonderful name so sometimes they can't really answer that question but but all the many experiences man ain't none of us had a javelin thrown at us come on you know your father-in-law thank god my father-in-law never threw a javelin at me you know you got father-in-law's do all kind of stuff but i i can say that my mother-in-law has been over the years just man great right but everybody can't say that right everybody everybody can't say that see but it's it's by his his many experiences and and seeing god at work and understanding that that was god that wasn't a man right now i said something then see the the reason why we we it i guess it's just carnal nature that we we we're prone to look to man right instead of god it i guess it just kind of goes with who we are carnally yeah the children of israel they had god and a prophet with them right but they they looked at was looking at the world and seeing what the world had and what the world had going on and and didn't see the depth of what they had they had the very creator they had the very god of the book they had the altar they had a mouthpiece from god and they said we want a man we we want a king to lead us really but you know it was because of their inexperience and and you know we people around church do that we want some man that we we we can follow some some quote-unquote big name preacher something man i want to follow god just just give me a man a vessel that's yielded to god right well he just started preaching i don't care if little brother joseph stop preaching tomorrow right amen it don't matter if he can yield his 10 year old amen that's the young man with the deep voice he told me he said i said man why your voice so deep he said uh i guess it's puberty you know i i i just like that little fella right there he's just so mature he might be so much of my son right but you i'm willing to hey man yield myself no matter how many years i've ministered because it's it's the gift of god it's god speaking through human lips is that right amen because that's all a gift is but see commonly we we look to the fleshly man and see no man has the ability brother branham said you know what i'm just standing in here when he does it is god using the voice god he says i got to go back sometime and listen to the tape for myself to know what i'm saying right because he's so caught up in the spirit see and it's by these experiences you learn to reverence god glory to god you learn you learn how to to reverence see amen you know the generation that we're living in is dip is different they are they want to be different i'll let them have it you are different if you want to be different right i don't want to bother nobody today all right but but you can you can see for me just the lack of experience and the and the lack of understanding though right amen the lack of understanding the lack of experience causes people to do a lot of the things that people do right amen and what's what it's an indication is the lack of reverence the lack of reverence in the home come on y'all it's it's a real disconnect right you know we we grew up in my my generation you learn to reverence respect elders you just knew that you you didn't stand around and try to hold conversation with old folk your mama be looking upside your head like boy they my grandma and them they just stayed they didn't have my grandmama didn't have to go through all that they just gave you the look that's all they did they just when when when they turned and then and your i caught they i you already understood what that was all about her eyes were speaking to you if you don't get out of here out of grove folk conversation boy i'ma tell you a new one you already knew that right generation now generations now you know but the bible say they'll be wiser but weaker right but but in in their wisdom you have to just challenge the wisdom that they they're getting though because writers become wrong and wrongers become right so you just really sometimes have to question what are people actually getting because when i was coming up the things that were considered wrong now is is becoming right and and and the things that people grew up with that that fed them and kept them and all of that now they got all of these questions see in 1988 we have all of these questions i'm still preaching right but but now it's it's the age of of we we question you question authority you question this see it shows it's a real inexperience and a lack of revelation now no let me stop him let me clarify if you don't understand something then then ask a question but have the right spirit right amen because this this this thi it's like being in school you know it's not disrespectful for you to raise your hand you know uh and and say well teacher so and so i i heard you but i don't understand that could you clarify cause you simplified a little bit better for me right but but to be challenging to be challenging disrespectful that's something different there's something different see everything watch this in association with god has got to be a man with the right spirit right it's got it's got to be lined up see and this is how i study so i can help you all out i watched amen everything by the spirit right because every fruit is known by what it brings forth right and so then if we're looking to god right and his spirit there's certain characteristics that's got to be on display you can't get around that i don't care how smart she is how much education y'all might have more college than me but you ain't getting around that if it's the spirit of god in you and me like i saw something i saw some i saw something uh this week i i had been hearing about a couple of preachers and i ain't gonna call nobody's name uh and and one preacher said something about another preacher and and this preacher he got on social media and he just went off and i said you know what two wrongs don't make a right and i was saying to myself you know even though the person might have said a particular thing and even called your name and doing it it's like i don't see the leading of god right if it's god it'll be done with with the right kind of spirit the the right type of attitude not a bolster is you know like how dare you i'm gonna crush you for that that ain't the spirit of god i don't care okay how long he been preaching where he come from and all of that the character other things that don't meet in the character of god right see the the the right the right thing would be to pick up the phone and say god bless you my brother i'd like to have a quick conversation with you right amen and and maybe you can help me with your statement and then maybe with the right spirit right you know you can get an apology and a retraction from the brother so that you don't have to go out and for me you damage your reputation right i'd be like that that ain't god i don't care i don't care how many scriptures and how much this and that another you bring right the the the the character of it the spirit of it is wrong and see brother branham said he'd rather be wrong in his doctrine then to be a modern day jacked up in his spirit right amen because god can we going somewhere god god amen we will reveal but to a certain class of people right y'all pray for me now i ain't like brother troy i do not have a timer up here i'ma preach to y'all wave the flag how long have i been up here i got about 30 minutes about 12 30 is when brother jack i think quit right amen no i ain't gonna kill him now but i i i think i got about 30 minutes i'm moving slow today cause i'm in i'm in a whole nother mode this morning right so he says who is the man that feareth the lord you gotta be able to answer that question for yourself right amen i i want to drop down and i want to i want to deal with something um also in those lines um because people try to get around things and i and you can't do it the prophet he he preached the messenger called respect right then i'm just kind of drop this in here and then we'll try to move along and get you out ahead of you but but i thought i thought that this was good and and just trying to uh dissect the scripture because now we we got to keep in mind we we're preaching from under the seventh seal every mystery has has been revealed and what's the scripture that i read i hope i can get to it right uh we've been given something and this is why i think a lot of people is missing it we've been given something in this age that other generations and other agents didn't get they didn't get the same understanding luther wesley pentecost they didn't get the same understanding that we have right how many can agree with that because luther had a message of justification amen you know not even saying the case he still drunk a little beer and smoked the pipe right went to the pub come on but then but then wesley comes on this scene and say uh right because your your body is the temple of the holy ghost right and even the prophet of god talks about how how uh mischievous people is when he preached a thinking man's filter right he said you know you put the filter on it and it takes more cigarettes to satisfy that thirst so it's false advertisement he said a thinking man won't smoke oh y'all don't preach with me i hope no smokers in here today y'all i can't say forgive me i hope no drinkers are in here you know oh glory too is wonderful i know we've gotten to the place even around the reveal word where we say uh uh uh they'll quote quoting the scripture where it says a little wine for the belly sake it like bro that's a whole lot of wine you drinking you must be sick every day go to folk houses they got two three bottles of wine up in the refrigerator right and then the prophet of god tells the stories and we all some of us knows this i noticed personally how how alcohol has destroyed families alcohol relationships and marriage and things of that nature right alcohol alcohol was around way longer than meth and and cocaine and some of this other stuff i got all been around a long time taking people out drinking was back in the days of moses moses i mean noah noah got so drunk was in the tent drunk naked and everything else two sons went in and was like shaking their head now look at the prophet daddy one son just went in there and looked upon his daddy's neck and this is like lord look at this drunken man like brother what's going to say he's drunk as a who wow lord have mercy but god didn't like that right why god didn't like that because it was disrespectful to god's prophet right see these are the problems that i have you you you you talk about so-called gifted men and learned it men it's like y'all but y'all missing like trump was saying that the parallels of scripture god don't change if god got angry when when uh these sons this man's sons right one of them disrespected the prophet got blotted out for it right come on god didn't like that look at look at i'ma say it before i get to it look at miriam yeah and aaron they were they was they was laughing and joking and things of that nature and god serving brother i'm saying they didn't even know what god was doing a lot of times people don't even know what god is doing i got it in the quote they didn't even know they were they were laughing and god got upset moses tell them to come here those are moses siblings go tell them to come here oh they think that was funny we need to have a conference we need to have a talk smoke miriam with leprosy why she disrespected god that was god in the man god vindicating and revealing amen his plan through the man oh and it was oh that's funny i'm telling you so we got to be careful i've watched people snicker in church and and make jokes and make fun and things of that nature thinking you being smart that's funny it's a lot of people that's just casualties of war on come on come on i i watch people i'm just going to preach this morning i've watched people just be casualties of war right folk get folk getting caught up in things that they do not really understand spiritually put their mouth on the man of god put their mouth on the teachings of god and and they go right on and they wonder why why can't i amen be stable why can't i be anchored because you disrespected god you got out of your place right amen god was dealing with moses is that right glory to god that was god's vessel that was god's anointed oh that's funny because he married uh this woman that's funny to you all huh we need to talk about this then yeah i'm i'ma show you just how funny this is and see watch watch moses moses had to stand in the gap find him right so that god didn't wipe them out i was reading the quote brother madam say you know uh god god cleansed her but she ain't live long after that right god cleansed her but she didn't live long after that he purged him right glory to god you got to be careful what you putting your lips on you get out of place and you get called you'll pay for it cause everything is not funny to god look at look at the prophet of god's wife she was right she was right husbands do those things we go hunting we go fishing you know most of the time you know we we do little things but i still don't give you a right right oh hallelujah well well you always gone i always got to deal with these children and uh she was right but it was her attitude right that got her in trouble right it didn't bother the man it didn't bother the prophet he knew yeah yeah i know i know i know i know i know but god say yeah yeah they didn't may not bother you but that bothers me that bothers me you go to you you go talk to her you go tell her and the it's the thing that had been laying dormant kind of that tumor that had been laying dormant he was seeing it but it wasn't there but it was there but the moment she done that that thing materialized right why why it was that god god saw because god demands respect for his servants i'm gonna say that again god demands respect let me keep i'm gonna read this morning just a tad amen i hope it's all right i'm not here to hurt anybody i'm not here to belittle anybody i i just you know i have to preach what's on my heart right he says um he says now that don't mean you're you're afraid just talking about god right he said but that means that that you are giving him respects and reverence and when you respect god you fear god right you fear that and i like this next day he said you feel that in the message of respect uh i'm not sure what is quoted he says you fear that you might displease him in some way but i i i retract just a little bit or i'll back back just a bit these things come by experience right glory to god this is why we have to say the things that we say it's imperative that we say oh he just hurt my feelings i'm not here to hurt your feelings i'm here to try to keep you out of hell right i'm going i'm still preaching i'm taking my time but i'm trying to get there that's it i i won't hurt y'all for the life of me right but amen i'm mandated by god to preach truth they shall know the truth truth make you free error binds you up a lot of people think they free but they not free they got shackles they shackle and don't even realize someone realize it right shackles because of error error have you so bound and messed up see your your lack of understanding of doctrine right your lack of understanding of what god is doing right i don't know why brother jack doing this it ain't unless he reveals it to you it ain't none of your business come on come on why he said that if it wasn't for you it ain't none of your business right you know what i have to tell myself now cause i changed a little bit being a christian i talk a little bit more than i used to when i was in the street i wasn't much of a talker i talked a little bit more but i thought i had to tell myself you know i ain't gonna say nothing don't say nothing lord whether you like it or not keep your mouth closed i have to tell that to myself sometimes right i don't like everything but i just learned to keep my captioning mouth closed i do one of these stoppers out bro i tried to tell y'all daddy don't know nothing everybody's smarter than daddy to everybody get in a pinch then daddy no no you ain't gonna play with daddy like that now this ain't no game oh y'all i'm gonna preach now cause y'all getting quiet on me huh you listen you can't you can't play with the spirit of god you can't play with the word of god that's how we we pursue we presume we vent you out without authority we we do things sometimes we we think things out and we think we don't thought a thing clearly but you was not clear on your thinking you didn't really look at that thing all the way through see i can love you and not be gullible i love my children but i ain't gonna let them make no fool out of me either sometimes as parents parents got to make hard decisions right sometimes you got to tell them no for their own good see i learned something you can't help a person to a person that's really ready to be helped as long as they i know i know i know i got you playing all right well if you got your plan you got your planet you don't really need me you know one of my sons this week you know little girlfriend kind of kicked him out a little bit and came home for a day went back and this and that this is a big drama they don't know i've been we've been praying on that situation but you know what but i did tell him i say you you know uh he left this morning to go back to work up the road and he comes back in three weeks i told him but uh but when you come back you you got to find somewhere else that's hard now i gave you a place but i watched you for a couple of days and you you ain't you don't really want to change so i say no i can't i got two other ones and if i ain't gonna let them do this i ain't gonna let you come back and do this no no no you gotta keep that out there you like to run around and drink and do all this you gotta keep that out there ain't mad at you i ain't mad at it if you want to get drunk until you pass out you don't know nothing in there that's on you i'm fine with that if you fire with that i'm fine with those things

little overboard with this thing now i just won't let you know i'm your daddy but in the same token right um when you when when when you your own hand right see when you come up from under the hat ship of the world then you're on your own and it is what it is then cause it's right i'm gonna preach to y'all god will watch out for you now when you from under the head he will come in right on the nick of time but god will let you go through some stuff and suffer he ain't always running to your rescue he'll let your lights get cut off huh somebody know what i'm talking about huh you haven't been sitting in the dark yes yes yes but i know what it's like to come home to the dog huh yeah see when you do things outside of the word of god you gotta come to your defense after a while but sometimes sometimes we need cheering you just gotta let them go through my people taught me but i'm gonna let you guys go and bump your head but i remember i remember but it's someone knows but i i

god want us to have the best let the musicians make their way i i'll come back to it wednesday night lord terry uh but but i i just and i didn't get to everywhere i want to go i kind of want to get some more into respect and showing what what you know what god demands and how important it is for us to be respectful respectful to the word respectful to one another respectful to authority to leadership right because that's the only way you're going to be blessed that's the only way you're going to be blessed you know i i'm reminded of um even before i started pastoring and i set up under uh brother james and it was times where it was things that i always understand right but i didn't fight him right my mindset was this i don't understand it all and i was i was a lot younger in the faith and in the ministry back then right uh but i always just wanted to give the benefit of the doubt and trust that he was being led to god right i did i i trusted i always gave him the benefit of the doubt you know it's like listen if god placed this man here to be my leader i got to trust the fact that god knows what he's doing right oh listen church just trust that god got our best interest at hand i've been just kind of uh watching brother jack and his leadership and uh i'm i'm impressed 110 i'm impressed i'm i'm glad i'm here for the ride i'm i'm on board for the ride and uh god is god is doing some great things and i miss and uh continue to keep him in prayer continue to keep us in prayer um i mean i'm here as long as god wants me to be here i have no plans on passing let me get this out here right quick and then i'm going i have no plans on pastoring another church well i asked you to be praying for me just pray for me right but i'm not planning on pastoring another church i don't i'm not trying to take another church i don't want another church by the grace of god now god forces me like he did before ain't got no choice but just pray for me basically it's it's my my work situation uh i've had to kind of go take a job didn't want to do that uh i don't really like working for folk i like being my own boss the liberties and not being tied down and and so when i had the church praying for me that was what it was all about was more or less about work and whether or not go get a job uh or you know continue to go on my own and uh right now i i had to just kind of that's what came the job came and uh i'm one i got to get my bills paid and i got to have money so i can't sit after two or three weeks sitting home i start like oh lord you stop putting putting out and ain't nothing coming in that ain't no good feeling you know i don't have it like that uh so so just continue to pray for me if god wants me wants me to go back on my own i he'll open the doors and make the way but right now um i'm you know i'm still trying to feel my way and just how god wants me to do it if if it's preaching you know he'll open the doors i don't know what to do this uh you know this is so different for me now i mean after pastoring i knew for 23 years what i was going to be doing thursday and and and sunday i knew what i was going to be doing but but now you know i kind of know what i'm doing because brother jack give me heads up you know but i need you to help me out on this day this day i'm fine okay okay i got you i got you but uh i want to eventually try to get out a little bit more and uh you know i'm just trying to be patient and just watch how things unfold you know before i knew you know following brother james to meet in the meeting the meeting and meeting doors open and i was able to get out when i started out evangelizing i started evangelizing four and a half years before we started pastoring so you know i'm thinking and following brother jack you know being around him and following him uh i'm watching i'm starting to meet a lot of different people and we just got to see how i go but i want to be i want to be patient and trusting in
