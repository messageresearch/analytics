[37:12] and so much life ahead of them and just
[37:14] not sure what's going on so we pray that
[37:16] god will give wisdom to the doctors and
[37:19] and that they would touch the body a man
[37:21] of steve there
[37:22] a man in um in trinidad we also have a
[37:26] request of prayer from sister vernon

[38:22] our heads
[38:25] and father we come in the
[38:28] matchless name of the lord jesus christ
[38:31] god we are uh praying

[38:41] little nephew
[38:41] 20 years old there and trinidad
[38:45] doctors are just not sure why he is in
[38:48] the condition he's saying they don't
[38:49] know what's caused it
[38:51] but we realize it is a devil a god that
[38:54] has attacked this young man's body
[38:57] and we come against the devil in the
[38:59] name of jesus we we realized god that
[39:02] the doctors may be at a at a lord just
[39:04] at a place where they just don't know
[39:06] what to do
[39:07] but father we know we can turn to you in
[39:09] times like this and know that you're
[39:10] able to intervene
[39:12] and you're able to make the difference
[39:14] so what god we come and we uh trust that
[39:16] you would touch steve we send the word
[39:18] of healing
[39:19] uh to trinidad god that you will raise
[39:22] them up from this condition may that be
[39:24] a complete turnaround
[39:25] and father uh life in this body we're
[39:28] going to continue to ask for life oh god
[39:30] so we just pray father to move by your
[39:32] your mighty hand
[39:34] upon steve even right now we also come
[39:37] uh on behalf of sister verna's cousin
[39:39] elisha

[39:50] lord what uh what a situation for a
[39:52] mother to be in that she has to decide

[40:10] prayer before the doctor's hands would
[40:12] touch
[40:13] amen her body amen that the tumor would

[48:47] god bless you god bless you amen
[48:51] so um i want to
[48:55] just read a a scripture we started down
[48:59] a little path on last week and i told
[49:00] you i'll come back in
[49:02] and um just hopefully finish it up
[49:05] amen on today um
[49:09] we were reading from matthew 17
[49:12] uh verse 14 through 21. and
[49:16] i'll just ask that you stand with me as
[49:19] we
[49:20] read the word of the lord
[49:24] amen hallelujah
[49:27] see when the if you ever had to go to
[49:31] court
[49:32] uh and the judge walks into the
[49:35] courtroom
[49:36] they make a statement to everyone as he
[49:38] walks in they say all
[49:40] rise and we got a judge that's greater
[49:44] than any judge
[49:46] in our united states and this is the
[49:49] king of kings and lords of lords and as
[49:51] we read his word then we
[49:52] rise amen amen and honor respect to
[49:57] our judge and our king matthew 17
[50:01] just starting at verse 14 it says and
[50:04] when they were come
[50:05] [Music]
[50:07] to the multitude there came to him a
[50:09] certain man kneeling down to him and
[50:11] saying
[50:12] lord have mercy
[50:17] uh oh my son for he is
[50:20] lunatic and so vexed for all times
[50:24] he falleth into the fire and often to
[50:27] the water so you can imagine his father
[50:30] uh having to be very concerned about
[50:32] where his son's gonna end up that day
[50:35] uh is he gonna be in fire is it gonna be
[50:37] on water you know what what is it
[50:39] you know what's going on here so you can
[50:41] imagine just what the father might be
[50:42] going through
[50:44] and the the father makes a statement
[50:46] here in verse 16 it says and i i brought
[50:48] him to thy disciples
[50:50] uh and they could not cure him
[50:55] then jesus answered and said o faithless
[50:58] and perverse generation how long shall i
[51:00] be with you
[51:01] how long shall i suffer you bring him
[51:04] hither
[51:05] to me jesus rebuked the devil
[51:09] and he departed out of him and the child
[51:11] was cured
[51:12] from that very hour
[51:16] it says uh then came the disciples to
[51:19] jesus apart
[51:20] and said why could not we cast
[51:23] him out and jesus said unto them
[51:27] because of your unbelief for verily i
[51:30] say unto you
[51:31] if you have faith as a grain of a
[51:34] mustard seed
[51:35] ye shall uh ye shall say unto this
[51:38] mountain remove
[51:39] hands to yonder place and it shall
[51:42] remove and nothing
[51:43] shall be impossible unto
[51:47] you i love those those words from the
[51:50] lord jesus
[51:51] nothing shall be impossible unto
[51:54] you how be this kind uh
[51:58] go with not out but by prayer and
[52:01] fasting the lord had a blessing to the
[52:03] reading of his word god as we've read
[52:05] your word we invite you now to come
[52:07] and give us clarity on what you're
[52:10] trying to speak to us today raise and
[52:12] anoint our faith
[52:14] lord to walk into this place that you
[52:16] were trying to get the disciples to walk
[52:18] in
[52:18] we take every spirit that's against the
[52:20] spirit of god underneath the control of
[52:22] the holy spirit even right now be
[52:23] glorified and magnified in this place
[52:26] jesus name we pray amen amen you can be
[52:29] seated
[52:30] amen in the presence of the lord uh we
[52:33] were talking on the subject
[52:34] last week built up in the faith for this
[52:38] hour amen built up in the faith for
[52:41] this hour and we want to continue our
[52:44] journey uh
[52:45] in this uh i was pulling this from uh a
[52:48] quote
[52:49] this is paragraph three out of spiritual
[52:51] food in due
[52:52] season uh god's prophet makes a
[52:55] statement to us
[52:57] at the very beginning of this sermon a
[52:59] man
[53:00] spiritual food in due season now i i
[53:03] mentioned to you that
[53:04] you know this would be a good message
[53:05] for you to go back and listen to
[53:07] when you just look at the titles
[53:09] sometimes of the message
[53:11] that brother branham would preach there
[53:14] is a
[53:14] message within the message
[53:18] right and and it's very important to
[53:20] just try to see what the holy spirit is
[53:23] actually trying to tell you
[53:24] and when he uses the title spiritual
[53:27] food
[53:28] and due season amen just by prophecy
[53:31] by by by by scripture amen by prophecy
[53:35] that's written in scripture
[53:36] there was going to come a day where we
[53:39] would be
[53:40] on the earth and there would be a famine
[53:43] in the land
[53:43] oh hallelujah amen this is greater than
[53:47] not having food at walmart
[53:50] right this is greater than not having
[53:52] food at out
[53:53] all days and amen this is greater than
[53:55] any of those things like that
[53:57] this famine would be a famine for
[53:59] actually hearing
[54:00] the word of god amen so so so so you
[54:04] know
[54:04] i have uh uh for some reason the lord
[54:07] has allowed me to kind of come in
[54:08] contact with people
[54:10] in the last few months where uh focus
[54:12] saying
[54:13] i met i met a lady last night and i we
[54:15] just went to pray for us see
[54:16] you know uh dealing with cancer we went
[54:18] to pray for and and
[54:20] and i was just talking to about church
[54:21] and everything and she said
[54:23] yes i was going to church amen but i
[54:26] have no desire to go back to that church
[54:28] and there's a lot of folk that are in
[54:30] that same condition i've heard
[54:32] multiple people say i don't want to go
[54:34] back to where i came from
[54:36] what it is is that they are experiencing
[54:38] amen a
[54:39] famine in the land spiritual famine
[54:42] is in the land hallelujah and
[54:45] if there's spiritual famine in the land
[54:48] glory
[54:48] then there's got to be a place where the
[54:50] people can go and be fair
[54:53] so their spiritual food and due season
[54:56] and i'm here to tell you like my auntie
[54:58] said it if you're willing
[55:01] to steal away from all the unbelief
[55:11] [Music]
[55:15] if you're willing to do something
[55:17] different you can eat spiritually
[55:20] blessed be the name of the lord come on
[55:23] church amen amen
[55:25] i i i i god don't make mistakes
[55:28] amen and sometimes it take a pandemic to
[55:31] get people
[55:31] where god wanted them to be all alone
[55:34] amen so i say praise the lord
[55:37] all right let's look at something here
[55:39] i'm pulling from this discernment
[55:41] spiritual food in due season
[55:43] he makes this statement says i know many
[55:46] of you are standing again tonight
[55:48] he says and outside met groups that said
[55:51] they couldn't get in
[55:52] and they're listening to their radio and
[55:54] in the different cars and
[55:56] and and we can just add to that people
[55:58] streaming on the internet
[56:00] right he says uh it says and now we're
[56:02] trying to make
[56:04] make just as quick as we can tonight on
[56:06] sunday night we give over to
[56:08] to pray for the sick have a prayer line
[56:10] as we can get one
[56:11] up here but we are dedicating the
[56:13] service tonight for the prayer for the
[56:14] sick now this is a statement that i want
[56:15] to bring
[56:16] out it says now i want you to get built
[56:19] up now
[56:20] this holy oracles of god in the faith
[56:23] the faith of this hour
[56:26] that is critical statement amen it's the
[56:29] faith
[56:30] of this hour that i i see
[56:33] see let me just just just pause on that
[56:35] just for a second
[56:37] and and and noah's day in order to get
[56:41] inside the ark you had to be
[56:44] a man anointed and and and underneath
[56:47] the inspiration
[56:49] of the faith for that hour
[56:52] hallelujah amen in moses day in order to
[56:56] put blood on the door
[56:58] you had to be anointed and under the
[57:01] inspiration
[57:03] of the faith for that hour if you
[57:06] wanted the death angel to pass your
[57:08] house you had to believe what moses was
[57:11] saying
[57:12] if you wanted to get into the ark of
[57:14] safety
[57:15] you had to believe the message that noah
[57:17] was preaching
[57:19] amen there's faith for the hour in which
[57:22] you live
[57:22] in and i'm telling you the hour with you
[57:25] if you can expect the rapture
[57:27] of the church so you don't need faith
[57:29] for this
[57:30] hour wrapped in faith
[57:34] it goes on to say this the faith is
[57:36] going to take
[57:37] more faith than ever was in any age
[57:42] amen for this has to be wrapped in faith
[57:45] glory to be taken up i'll stop right
[57:48] there
[57:48] this has to be rapturing faith to be
[57:51] taken up
[57:52] see so so you know this this this is
[57:54] going to take greater faith than any
[57:56] other day
[57:58] now now i don't want us to uh to to
[58:00] misinterpret and misunderstand
[58:03] that as far as a greater faith amen
[58:05] because as we were just reading in the
[58:07] scripture you know
[58:08] jesus was telling them you just gotta
[58:10] have faith the size of a grain of a
[58:12] mustard seed
[58:13] that means your faith has got to be pure
[58:16] oh can i go a little further
[58:19] your faith has got to be pure in a
[58:21] message that god has sent you
[58:24] hallelujah because the rapture and faith
[58:27] that you're looking for
[58:28] is actually laying inside the books and
[58:30] the tapes
[58:32] amen church right so so god has sent you
[58:35] a message
[58:36] to actually help you get prepared for a
[58:38] rapture
[58:39] this is why many churches won't even
[58:40] preach about a rapture
[58:42] they are so confused when it comes to
[58:44] talking about the rapture
[58:45] yet there's a promise in the scripture
[58:47] that we shall be changed
[58:50] in the moment in the twinkling of an eye
[58:53] and ain't no devil gonna stop that
[58:54] jesus hallelujah there is so much that
[58:58] is
[58:58] that is before us i uh i'm watching
[59:01] prophecies fulfilled quickly
[59:05] you know before 1933
[59:08] in 1933 god's prophet had a vision
[59:11] before he was going to church
[59:13] and there were seven visions seven
[59:15] things that he saw happen
[59:16] he said before the coming of the lord
[59:18] say there were seven things
[59:20] 1933 and one of the things that he saw
[59:24] he said there would be a woman that
[59:25] would rise up in power
[59:27] and it says she might be a president or
[59:30] a vice president
[59:32] or she could be the catholic church
[59:34] hallelujah because we know the catholic
[59:36] church according to scripture got a lot
[59:37] of power
[59:38] amen amen revelation tells us all that
[59:40] right
[59:41] he said but he said he said but but it
[59:43] could be a woman that would rise up in
[59:45] power say now you got to watch some
[59:46] things you know
[59:47] uh if if the election and i don't want
[59:49] to get too too far
[59:50] off into politics but if the election
[59:52] don't take place
[59:54] we're going to have a woman in power
[59:57] and if the democratic party wins we're
[59:59] gonna have another woman in power
[1:00:02] so prophecy is actually about to be
[1:00:04] manifested
[1:00:05] and we don't even realize where we act
[1:00:08] hallelujah church so
[1:00:09] so i don't get too wrapped up in all of
[1:00:12] this into that
[1:00:13] get wrapped up in what god is saying in
[1:00:15] his word
[1:00:16] hallelujah i mean because as i see these
[1:00:18] things manifested i got one prayer
[1:00:21] i got one prayer and it's the very last
[1:00:25] prayer that was prayed in scripture even
[1:00:28] so come lord jesus

[1:00:52] week
[1:00:54] um and i'll read it again in a second
[1:00:57] but let's just go to paragraph six and
[1:00:58] spiritual food and due season he says
[1:01:00] now we see uh that modern trend
[1:01:03] of the people then on the days are past
[1:01:07] there's no such thing as miracles the
[1:01:09] the people are all emotionally worked up
[1:01:12] listen to that elijah the prophet cry
[1:01:15] out again
[1:01:16] now now when he say that people all
[1:01:18] emotionally work up now you worked up go
[1:01:20] back
[1:01:20] and think about what happened in the
[1:01:22] days of elijah
[1:01:24] amen when he when he came out then he
[1:01:26] challenged
[1:01:27] all the other prophets and he said need
[1:01:29] to challenge the whole nation of israel
[1:01:31] and say
[1:01:31] let the god that answered by fire be god
[1:01:34] it says i'll tell you what you're going
[1:01:35] to do we're going to set up two altars
[1:01:36] you're going to be build an altar to
[1:01:37] bell
[1:01:38] and i'm i'm gonna set up an altar to god
[1:01:40] he's saying i'm gonna let y'all go in
[1:01:41] the morning then i'll come in the
[1:01:42] evening time
[1:01:43] and while they were building up their
[1:01:44] altar that the bible said
[1:01:46] they began to cut themselves and and
[1:01:49] just do all kind of crazy things to try
[1:01:51] to get there god to answer
[1:01:52] why while elijah sat there and just
[1:01:54] pretty much laughed at them all and said
[1:01:56] now
[1:01:56] maybe your god is hard of hearing he
[1:01:59] says maybe
[1:02:00] your god is on vacation maybe your god
[1:02:03] didn't
[1:02:03] show up amen at the showdown
[1:02:06] you understand maybe your god didn't pay
[1:02:09] attention to
[1:02:10] the appointment that was on the calendar
[1:02:12] amen we said
[1:02:13] let the gods and answer about fire be
[1:02:16] god
[1:02:16] where is your god and they did all kind
[1:02:19] of emotional things
[1:02:21] to get the attention of their god lord
[1:02:23] that god never moved
[1:02:25] he said okay i'm tired of it enough is
[1:02:27] enough y'all push this stuff to the side
[1:02:29] now i mean
[1:02:30] now now let me build my altar you say
[1:02:32] now i'm gonna do
[1:02:33] i'm gonna dig a trench and he dig a
[1:02:35] trench he said put some water in there
[1:02:37] cause fire and water don't mix
[1:02:40] put water he what he said i'm gonna make
[1:02:42] this thing
[1:02:43] impossible put some water in the trees
[1:02:48] put some more water in the trench that
[1:02:51] ain't enough put
[1:02:52] more three times they put water in the
[1:02:54] trench cause three is the number
[1:02:56] perfection
[1:02:57] it said he said put it in a trench he
[1:02:59] said he said no no not just back up
[1:03:00] everybody
[1:03:01] one man standing against 800 of them i

[1:03:05] 400 prophets of baal and 400 of the
[1:03:08] grove he saved 800 people he's standing
[1:03:10] here
[1:03:10] standing against the government
[1:03:13] oh come on church standing against ahab
[1:03:18] and his wife
[1:03:19] jezebel amen stand against everybody

[1:03:27] did this at your words
[1:03:29] you you told me to come out here and do
[1:03:30] this now turn their hearts back to you
[1:03:32] god he said
[1:03:33] now i'm here let the god that answer by
[1:03:35] fire let them be god
[1:03:36] here come fire from heaven and consume
[1:03:39] the sacrifice that was on the altar
[1:03:40] now they agreed that the god that
[1:03:43] answered by fire would be
[1:03:45] would be god but did they stay with it
[1:03:47] no according to scripture they didn't
[1:03:48] stay with it
[1:03:49] hallelujah what are you agreeing to
[1:03:50] today amen hallelujah
[1:03:53] i'm here to tell you that that same god
[1:03:55] that that manifested himself for elijah
[1:03:58] is still manifesting himself today
[1:03:59] and if god has done anything for you you
[1:04:02] ought to be
[1:04:03] satisfied enough in that to serve him
[1:04:06] with everything you got
[1:04:09] hallelujah all right all right all right
[1:04:11] all right
[1:04:12] i'm reading this amen it says uh
[1:04:16] uh listen to that elijah the prophet
[1:04:20] cried out cry out against them and the
[1:04:23] theologians
[1:04:24] notice notice uh he was uh he spoke as
[1:04:27] if
[1:04:29] he was god himself that that's a
[1:04:32] statement that just blows me away
[1:04:35] he spoke as if
[1:04:38] he was god himself you got to watch
[1:04:41] these little statements that he'd be
[1:04:42] slipping in there on us
[1:04:44] he spoke as if
[1:04:47] he was god himself now where he's
[1:04:50] getting that from us
[1:04:51] is uh first uh first kings 17 1 when
[1:04:53] when when elijah said
[1:04:55] you know what it ain't gonna rain until
[1:04:58] i say so not
[1:05:01] not not oh that's powerful to me
[1:05:04] look king of ahab don't even have
[1:05:07] anybody fast
[1:05:10] don't even have anybody pray
[1:05:13] don't do nothing until you come see me
[1:05:16] all right i mean
[1:05:19] he spoke it he said he said it won't
[1:05:21] rain until i
[1:05:22] called for it and do you realize for
[1:05:25] three and a half years
[1:05:27] no rain and then then elijah shows up
[1:05:31] and he has this this mighty uh uh
[1:05:34] demonstration and and after the
[1:05:35] demonstration he said now you tell the
[1:05:37] servant said give thee up tell they have
[1:05:39] get up it's about to rain
[1:05:40] wait a minute now uh it's about to rain
[1:05:43] it it don't look like it's about to rain
[1:05:44] uh uh elijah said i said get me up it's
[1:05:47] about to rain say now he told the
[1:05:48] servicer now
[1:05:49] go up and look and see if it's about to
[1:05:51] rain he said i went up to the top of the
[1:05:53] mountain
[1:05:53] i don't see nothing i went up again
[1:05:56] i still don't see nothing he said and
[1:05:59] now you can imagine
[1:06:00] if you ever had to climb a mountain you
[1:06:02] know it ain't easy to go up and down
[1:06:03] that
[1:06:04] mountain but here this ain't florida
[1:06:06] this ain't flat land that he's running
[1:06:07] this man is running up and down a
[1:06:09] mountain all day long he'd say i don't
[1:06:11] see nothing he said go
[1:06:12] up seven times all right
[1:06:15] go up seven times and say on the seventh
[1:06:18] time the man goes up
[1:06:19] and he sees one change hallelujah
[1:06:23] amen and it was just a little change on
[1:06:26] the seventh time
[1:06:27] it wasn't anything big he looked up in
[1:06:30] god's
[1:06:31] big beautiful sky they say i see a cloud
[1:06:38] but the cloud is so small elijah the
[1:06:41] cloud is the size of a man's hand
[1:06:45] that's all i see is the cloud the size
[1:06:48] of a man said
[1:06:49] i'ma tell you something if you see
[1:06:51] something that small
[1:06:53] that's enough to start praising god
[1:06:55] about
[1:06:57] bless it be his holy name you ain't got
[1:07:00] to see nothing big see something small
[1:07:02] and begin to worship as you worship when
[1:07:05] it's small you'll make it big
[1:07:10] hallelujah so that's all i see is a
[1:07:13] cloud the size of a man they said get
[1:07:15] get get ready it's about the rain it's
[1:07:16] it's about it's about to be an
[1:07:18] outpouring and i believe that it's going
[1:07:21] to be an
[1:07:21] outpouring out poor ring
[1:07:26] glory y'all gonna get spiritually wet
[1:07:30] [Applause]
[1:07:35] spiritually wet yes brother you can tell
[1:07:38] when somebody's been in the ring
[1:07:40] and that's what we want we want to feel
[1:07:42] it spiritually we want to know people
[1:07:44] have been in the ring
[1:07:46] hallelujah they're soaked glory to god
[1:07:48] there's a change taking place on the
[1:07:50] inside
[1:07:51] oh hallelujah church amen amen but
[1:07:55] i tell you he said get up he said it's
[1:07:57] going to rain and
[1:07:58] and god god manifested based on elijah's
[1:08:01] words
[1:08:02] based on the lives of where he brought
[1:08:04] the reign and and this is why brother
[1:08:05] branham said it's as
[1:08:06] if he was taking god's place
[1:08:10] god is the one that controls the ring
[1:08:12] god's the one that does that
[1:08:14] god controls so much amen but you see
[1:08:18] that that same
[1:08:19] god that stepped into elijah
[1:08:22] manifested himself in in the flesh of
[1:08:24] jesus
[1:08:25] this is why he could get on a boat and

[1:14:43] every wave that the enemies toss in our
[1:14:45] direction we speak to it peace be
[1:14:47] still he spoke to the wind
[1:14:50] and the ways how anything contrary to
[1:14:54] god's will he we speak to it
[1:14:56] in the name of the lord jesus can i go a
[1:14:58] little further amen this this statement
[1:15:01] that i'm making here in spiritual food
[1:15:02] and due season just reading this
[1:15:04] amen um says uh
[1:15:08] listen to that elijah uh the prophet
[1:15:10] cried against him
[1:15:12] and their theologians noticed notice he
[1:15:15] spoke as
[1:15:16] if he was god himself elijah spoke as if
[1:15:20] he was god himself
[1:15:21] the dew will not fall from heaven until
[1:15:24] i call for it
[1:15:25] that's that's that's first kings 17 1
[1:15:27] you'll find it there he says amen
[1:15:29] yes sir the prophet had been so long in
[1:15:32] the presence of god
[1:15:34] the prophets of the old testament or any
[1:15:37] time when they
[1:15:38] lived in the presence of god until they
[1:15:40] become the word
[1:15:42] their message is the word itself he says
[1:15:45] and remember he said
[1:15:46] thus saith the lord and when those men
[1:15:49] had those messages from god
[1:15:51] and they um he says and they become so
[1:15:53] wrapped up that their own thinking
[1:15:55] it might have been against their
[1:15:57] thinking they might have not
[1:15:59] they might not have been able to see it
[1:16:01] right but they
[1:16:02] they were speaking the word of god thus
[1:16:05] saith the lord
[1:16:06] there will not be any ring till i call
[1:16:09] for it
[1:16:10] oh what a statement he had been in the
[1:16:12] presence of god had been vindicated
[1:16:14] uh so perfect and remember that also
[1:16:16] follows amos 3
[1:16:17] 7 the lord god will do nothing until
[1:16:20] first he reveals it to his servants the
[1:16:22] prophets
[1:16:22] so there's not going to be any rainfall
[1:16:25] right
[1:16:25] so here this prophet is so wrapped up uh
[1:16:28] uh in the word of god and under the
[1:16:31] inspiration of god
[1:16:32] that he actually has taken the place of
[1:16:34] god to speak certain things on the earth
[1:16:37] this is a powerful thing to think about
[1:16:39] i mean here
[1:16:40] elijah's so wrapped up in and i don't
[1:16:42] want to just leave it at elijah
[1:16:44] amen i'll show you also this happened in
[1:16:46] the ministry of moses
[1:16:48] amen another prophet that gets so
[1:16:50] wrapped up in in the things of god
[1:16:52] i showed you last week that even
[1:16:53] happened in god's prophet brother
[1:16:54] branham
[1:16:55] there were certain things that he spoke
[1:16:57] while he was here on the earth he took
[1:16:58] the place of god
[1:17:00] to say things like that paul amen in
[1:17:04] scripture
[1:17:04] also took the place of god to say things
[1:17:07] in scriptures recorded that paul say
[1:17:09] i say this not the lord
[1:17:13] when he was talking about marriage of
[1:17:15] divorce paul say this this is what i'm
[1:17:16] saying
[1:17:18] and god recorded it
[1:17:20] [Music]
[1:17:21] i want you to think about that god
[1:17:24] allowed what he
[1:17:25] what he said to be recorded in scripture
[1:17:27] and he's clearly telling about it
[1:17:29] this ain't what the lord said this is
[1:17:31] what i'm saying
[1:17:34] oh there's a place god is calling us to
[1:17:37] now it's very easy for me to leave that
[1:17:39] prophets and and all that but i'm gonna
[1:17:41] i'm gonna bring it forward amen a little
[1:17:42] bit further today because i'm trying to
[1:17:44] build us and
[1:17:45] build us up in the faith of this hour
[1:17:47] let's look at moses just for a second
[1:17:49] amen before we go before we go further
[1:17:51] let's look at something exodus 14.
[1:17:55] praise the name of the lord exodus 14.
[1:17:59] now um
[1:18:02] this is a
[1:18:06] the the the story of the children of
[1:18:08] israel coming out of egypt
[1:18:11] um god had already told abraham that his
[1:18:14] children
[1:18:15] uh his seed would be in bondage for over
[1:18:17] 400 years down in this land and say but
[1:18:19] then he's going to come down and he's
[1:18:20] going to deliver them
[1:18:21] so god already has prophesied it there's
[1:18:23] a plan in place
[1:18:24] god has a man born by the name of moses
[1:18:27] was protected at his birth and so many
[1:18:29] miracles happened amen around him uh he
[1:18:32] knew
[1:18:33] it by by his mother's revelation he
[1:18:36] knew that he was supposed to be to
[1:18:37] deliver now he tried to deliver
[1:18:40] the people in his own strength but it
[1:18:42] didn't work out in his own strengths so
[1:18:44] so he ended up
[1:18:44] running a man to the to the wilderness
[1:18:47] for 40 years and
[1:18:48] while he was back there on the back side
[1:18:50] of the desert he met god in the form of
[1:18:52] a burning bush
[1:18:54] god spoke to him out of that burning
[1:18:56] bush sent moses with a commission and
[1:18:59] moses had all kind of excuses as to why
[1:19:01] he couldn't do what god was calling him
[1:19:03] to do
[1:19:03] and i want to tell you something god
[1:19:05] amen did not
[1:19:07] uh listen to any of those excuses god
[1:19:10] did not accept
[1:19:11] any of those excuses and i want to tell
[1:19:13] you if you have some excuses
[1:19:15] that you're giving god this morning god
[1:19:18] is not accepting
[1:19:19] any of your excuses blessed be the name
[1:19:22] of the lord
[1:19:23] amen i can't do it because of this i
[1:19:26] can't do it because of that
[1:19:28] i'm not this i'm not god is not
[1:19:30] accepting any of your
[1:19:32] excuses if you expected god to feel
[1:19:35] sorry for you
[1:19:36] he does it amen
[1:19:41] all right let's go on a little further
[1:19:43] moses
[1:19:44] finally gets the people to a spot where
[1:19:46] he's bringing them out
[1:19:48] of the land of egypt finally he see the
[1:19:51] manifestation
[1:19:52] of what god told him we see it coming to
[1:19:54] pass after he's gone
[1:19:56] going down and called for for frogs and
[1:19:58] and flies and
[1:19:59] and all kind of things these pin plagues
[1:20:01] that he set on the egyptians
[1:20:02] uh now now uh god has finally got the
[1:20:05] people out of egypt but they run into a
[1:20:07] great trial
[1:20:08] they run into uh
[1:20:11] the red sea hallelujah now this kind of
[1:20:14] i want to just kind of put it this way
[1:20:16] because
[1:20:17] um you know what if what if
[1:20:21] by us coming back together the devil set
[1:20:24] a trial into the church
[1:20:25] what is going to be our position
[1:20:30] is everybody going to say i see brother
[1:20:32] jack shouldn't have
[1:20:33] is that gonna be the first thing out of
[1:20:35] your mouth
[1:20:37] as a believer
[1:20:41] praise the lord i didn't get too many
[1:20:42] amens cause i know that's what folk
[1:20:44] gonna say i i i step out on faith i'm
[1:20:48] okay with that
[1:20:50] i believe god's gonna keep us he's
[1:20:52] tempted this fight he'll keep us on
[1:20:55] hey man glory to god if you get sick i'm
[1:20:58] praying for you
[1:20:59] i'm going to rebuke the devil
[1:21:04] last night we i don't even see sometimes
[1:21:07] it's hard to even tell testimonies
[1:21:08] because you don't know where people
[1:21:09] faith that you tell you you know as soon
[1:21:13] as if
[1:21:13] anybody die anybody anybody it don't
[1:21:16] matter who they are if you hear death
[1:21:19] first thing was it covet
[1:21:24] that's the first thing coming out of
[1:21:25] everybody's mouth was no it was just old
[1:21:28] age oh okay
[1:21:33] i i mean the prophet told that was told
[1:21:35] by the angel lord said not even cancer
[1:21:37] standing wait in
[1:21:38] the way your prayer if the if the angel
[1:21:40] would have said not even covet we would
[1:21:42] have said
[1:21:42] what do you mean covet we want to know
[1:21:45] none about nokovic
[1:21:47] right but cancer used to be the thing
[1:21:49] that everybody was afraid of
[1:21:50] but you know what we're seeing god here
[1:21:52] in this church
[1:21:53] heal people of cancer the thing that
[1:21:56] everybody
[1:21:56] when doctors give up when they say stage
[1:21:58] four
[1:22:00] that means it's over for you right god
[1:22:02] got to move on your behalf
[1:22:04] and we seeing god do it so why we gonna
[1:22:06] let our faith get weak now
[1:22:11] if there was ever at least one church
[1:22:14] that should be able to still thrive in
[1:22:16] the midst of a pandemic this church
[1:22:18] should be able to thrive
[1:22:20] based on what we've seen god already do
[1:22:24] and i'm here to take ain't nothing too
[1:22:26] hard for our god
[1:22:28] amen last night we went to pray for

[1:26:59] uh i'm in exodus 14. they they have this
[1:27:02] great this great problem
[1:27:04] but but look at what happened in the
[1:27:05] midst of this problem
[1:27:07] amen amen moses by
[1:27:10] inspiration steps up and says moses said
[1:27:15] unto the people now god didn't tell
[1:27:17] moses to say these things
[1:27:19] but what i want you to understand is
[1:27:21] that god was veiling himself
[1:27:23] in moses so since god was veiling
[1:27:25] himself
[1:27:26] in moses moses could speak as
[1:27:29] if he was god
[1:27:33] i hope that ain't too heavy for the
[1:27:35] church
[1:27:36] amen moses could speak as if he was god
[1:27:40] because god was filled in him
[1:27:42] look at this moses said unto the people
[1:27:45] fear ye not
[1:27:46] i want to tell that to the church this
[1:27:47] morning fear ye not
[1:27:49] stand still see the salvation of the
[1:27:53] lord
[1:27:54] which he will show you today
[1:27:57] and god didn't tell moses to say any of
[1:27:59] that now moses is out here
[1:28:01] on his own but see he realized he wasn't
[1:28:05] on his own
[1:28:06] and i realized we realized we're not on
[1:28:08] our own
[1:28:09] because greater is he that's in us than
[1:28:12] he that's in the world
[1:28:13] it said moses said unto the people
[1:28:14] feeling not stand still and see the
[1:28:16] salvation lord
[1:28:17] which he will show to you today for the
[1:28:20] egyptians
[1:28:21] whom ye have seen today oh what a word
[1:28:25] here
[1:28:26] ye shall see them again no more forever
[1:28:30] that fellow who faced that's chasing you
[1:28:31] right now you're gonna see his face no
[1:28:33] more forever
[1:28:35] god god told moses i'm god now god and
[1:28:38] telmo said moses just said it by
[1:28:39] inspiration now i'm gonna tell you how
[1:28:42] how how far he was under inspiration
[1:28:44] he just let it let it flow right out of
[1:28:46] his mouth and i'm gonna tell you when he
[1:28:48] said this god was
[1:28:49] in heaven like oh yes
[1:28:52] praise and i can't pray
[1:28:56] thank you moses you know god i mean god
[1:29:00] was just like
[1:29:01] yes that's my son down there speaking
[1:29:06] here come moses in the very next verse
[1:29:09] athlete unspoke all these powerful words
[1:29:11] and inspired the people
[1:29:12] they said verse i'm sorry uh the next
[1:29:14] says the lord shall fight for you and
[1:29:16] you shall hold your feasts
[1:29:17] uh hold your peace and the lord said
[1:29:19] unto moses
[1:29:20] wherefore cries
[1:29:23] that one to me now look at the change
[1:29:26] from verse 14
[1:29:28] to verse 15. look at verse 14 again
[1:29:32] the lord shall fight for you and you
[1:29:35] shall hold your peace that means i ain't
[1:29:37] gonna
[1:29:37] fight this thing and then the next verse
[1:29:42] and the lord said unto moses what
[1:29:44] happened in between verse 14 and 15. you
[1:29:46] got to get in between the scenes
[1:29:48] because in the very next verse moses
[1:29:50] says
[1:29:51] the lord said the lord said to moses
[1:29:53] wherefore christ now unto me
[1:29:56] speaking to the children of israel that
[1:29:58] they go
[1:29:59] forward we're not going back are we
[1:30:02] going forward
[1:30:04] moses start crying moses started like uh
[1:30:07] lord
[1:30:07] what am i what am i gonna do and god's
[1:30:09] like what you gonna do
[1:30:10] you're the one just saying that the
[1:30:12] egyptians they seen today
[1:30:14] they ain't gonna see no more forever you
[1:30:15] just said that you make it happen moses
[1:30:18] moses didn't know what to do under the
[1:30:20] inspiration he was lost
[1:30:22] see see see now here's the thing god
[1:30:24] will actually anoint us to do some
[1:30:25] things and then he's going to feel like
[1:30:26] ain't nothing happened
[1:30:27] but when you say to the mountain be thou
[1:30:29] removed be thou cast into the sea
[1:30:31] if the mountain is moving one grain of
[1:30:33] sand at a time
[1:30:34] the mountain is still moving god don't
[1:30:38] want you to doubt after you release
[1:30:39] something out of your mouth
[1:30:44] god didn't doubt when he released out
[1:30:46] his mouth let there be
[1:30:48] you you want to know how how sure god
[1:30:51] god was there was that light was going
[1:30:53] to come god started working on something
[1:30:55] else
[1:30:56] when he said let there be light he knew
[1:30:58] light was coming
[1:31:00] even if it took a billion years he knew
[1:31:02] light was coming
[1:31:03] we got to have that kind of faith
[1:31:07] don't change your testimony after you
[1:31:09] don't spoke it
[1:31:14] moses say uh god said moses what you
[1:31:16] doing don't don't cry to me
[1:31:18] speak tell the people to keep going
[1:31:20] forward i'm like
[1:31:21] i don't he said moses take the rod that
[1:31:24] you got in your hand and do something
[1:31:25] with it
[1:31:26] stretch it out took the rod and
[1:31:28] stretched it out when he stretched right
[1:31:29] out he said
[1:31:30] he said now the sea just began to part
[1:31:34] and moses probably still don't know what
[1:31:35] this what this mean
[1:31:37] we gonna go i know to go forward come on
[1:31:39] everybody two million people walking
[1:31:41] forward
[1:31:41] while they walking here comes pharaoh's
[1:31:45] army
[1:31:46] hallelujah but god because he spoke
[1:31:50] through moses
[1:31:51] had to honor what moses said even moses
[1:31:54] didn't know what the end result was
[1:31:55] going to be
[1:31:56] but god knew god knew what the end
[1:31:59] result was gonna be just speak it moses
[1:32:01] i got this under control now watch this
[1:32:03] get everybody through the sea
[1:32:05] well yeah we got everybody through the
[1:32:06] scene now we're gonna do just turn
[1:32:07] around and watch your enemy
[1:32:13] watch watch watch watch what i do to
[1:32:15] your enemy
[1:32:16] and got them out in the middle of the
[1:32:18] sea see even people people people try to
[1:32:21] criticize say well they walked they
[1:32:23] walked at a time
[1:32:24] where the water wasn't even high they
[1:32:27] walked at a time where i mean
[1:32:28] it was so low it was easy for the people
[1:32:31] to walk amen
[1:32:32] through the sea that sounds good to the
[1:32:34] intellectual mind
[1:32:35] but a prophet turns it and says well if
[1:32:38] it's
[1:32:39] if they walk through at a time like that
[1:32:41] how is it
[1:32:42] that they drive that same little bitty
[1:32:44] water
[1:32:45] that they want because how did it drown
[1:32:47] the whole army
[1:32:50] see we're gonna give god the glory we're
[1:32:52] gonna give them the praise
[1:32:53] we know that he's making a way and he's
[1:32:56] only making a way for us
[1:32:58] he won making a way for pharaoh he was
[1:33:01] making a way for the children of israel

[1:36:21] that changes the subject doesn't it
[1:36:24] and i had to read that quote to change
[1:36:27] the subject

[1:36:55] believe you receive it and you shall
[1:36:57] have it amen
[1:36:59] amen i'm going a little further i got
[1:37:01] some more to read this is coming from
[1:37:03] the resurrection of lazarus
[1:37:05] i got to change the subject i got to put
[1:37:06] this in the church i'm going to tell you
[1:37:08] if you want these seeds to grow you got
[1:37:10] to take time to put them in
[1:37:13] amen watch this resurrection of lazarus
[1:37:16] it says now notice that's uh that's
[1:37:19] where you are that's what's the matter
[1:37:20] with you pentecostal people
[1:37:22] it's my lot of this afternoon to preach
[1:37:24] and and i have a right here at the
[1:37:26] platform
[1:37:27] i don't never want to know any person
[1:37:29] from the flesh when i'm standing here
[1:37:31] that's what's the matter with the
[1:37:32] pentecostal people they don't recognize
[1:37:34] who they are
[1:37:35] your sons amen and daughters of god
[1:37:38] you have in your hand uh look look then
[1:37:41] jesus it was one time quote in scripture
[1:37:42] ye are gods it says look deity i'm part
[1:37:46] of
[1:37:46] charles branham because i was born from
[1:37:49] the charles
[1:37:50] charlie branham my daddy i'm part of him
[1:37:53] i got a forehead like him my hair was
[1:37:56] like him
[1:37:56] i'm a small man like him i'm in the
[1:37:59] nature like him
[1:38:00] because he's my dad and if we become in
[1:38:03] spirit
[1:38:04] sons of god deity dwells in the man
[1:38:08] hallelujah then you talk about blind
[1:38:10] eyes being open
[1:38:12] they said nothing impossible to god god
[1:38:16] saying nothing impossible with you
[1:38:20] if you believe not with god but you
[1:38:23] deities
[1:38:24] in man
[1:38:30] not just hitting the prophet in us if we
[1:38:32] got the holy ghost
[1:38:34] this is laying inside of us
[1:38:38] the very god that stood back there on a
[1:38:40] mythical platform
[1:38:41] of eternities and rolled worlds off his
[1:38:43] hand and created things
[1:38:45] gives you the privilege to be his son
[1:38:48] and you're a part of him and god dwells
[1:38:50] in mankind and man
[1:38:51] himself is deity
[1:38:55] all right and the reason why it makes
[1:38:57] you deity is because god the spirit of
[1:38:59] god lives
[1:39:00] in you you can't be deity by yourself
[1:39:03] but when you have the spirit of god
[1:39:04] living in you it makes you a part of him
[1:39:08] all right can we go further it says
[1:39:10] there you are it might choke you
[1:39:13] but study over that a little while see
[1:39:15] uh god dwells in man and man becomes the
[1:39:17] son of god not him
[1:39:18] in himself but the holy spirit that's in
[1:39:21] him is god
[1:39:22] the creator lives in the creation oh my
[1:39:25] how i think of that
[1:39:26] then stand with an unwavering faith and
[1:39:28] ask what you will
[1:39:29] it'll be done there there he is god
[1:39:32] there he is now
[1:39:33] you know um i was just you know just
[1:39:35] meditating on this and
[1:39:36] i was thinking on the scripture of peter
[1:39:39] and john when they went to the temple
[1:39:42] i said is this just for prophets or is
[1:39:44] this for just normal people because you
[1:39:45] know
[1:39:46] peter was just normal just like us
[1:39:49] he was so normal he was so normal that
[1:39:52] he doubted all the time
[1:39:55] i mean the great things could happen and
[1:39:57] the man go right back into doubt
[1:39:59] right i mean uh uh uh uh but but but
[1:40:02] peter
[1:40:02] you know was the same guy that you know
[1:40:04] jesus come walking on water he's on the
[1:40:06] ship they was in the midst of a storm
[1:40:08] again they weren't sleeping they was
[1:40:10] crying like oh what we going to do and
[1:40:11] here comes jesus walking in the midst of
[1:40:13] a storm right towards the disciples
[1:40:15] i'm not while the water was calm god
[1:40:18] does his best work when things
[1:40:20] are in chaos
[1:40:27] [Applause]
[1:40:32] i mean that's a man that can turn on
[1:40:33] lights
[1:40:36] so when it's chaotic look for him to
[1:40:38] show up
[1:40:39] so here he come walking underwater in
[1:40:41] chaos
[1:40:43] walking out there to the disciples and
[1:40:44] they're like oh lord i'm not
[1:40:46] not this this is just too far
[1:40:49] it's hard for us to doubt them but we
[1:40:51] don't know whether to believe him or not
[1:40:53] so peter says if it be you
[1:40:59] i mean i i don't know too much about i
[1:41:00] ain't never seen this in all my days
[1:41:03] if it be you
[1:41:06] i got one one request bid me
[1:41:10] to come now i'ma tell you something just
[1:41:14] kind of struck me
[1:41:14] the reason peter could get out that boat
[1:41:18] because he recognized the voice
[1:41:23] he didn't need a paragraph he didn't
[1:41:26] need a sentence
[1:41:27] he knew the voice oh hallelujah
[1:41:31] and you're gonna need to know the voice
[1:41:32] of god
[1:41:34] hallelujah my sheep know my voice
[1:41:38] and a stranger they won't follow peter
[1:41:41] recognize that voice and say okay he
[1:41:42] said come boys i'm coming at the ship
[1:41:45] peter got himself
[1:41:47] out of that ship and and i'm i'm talking
[1:41:49] about a man born just like you sinful
[1:41:51] man
[1:41:52] peter began to walk on water
[1:41:55] and he was walking for a good while i'ma
[1:41:58] tell you when he start
[1:41:58] sinking come on y'all ain't with me
[1:42:02] today
[1:42:04] i'ma tell you the only time he starts
[1:42:06] sinking is when he allowed
[1:42:08] doubt to come in and if we don't allow
[1:42:12] doubt we won't sing
[1:42:21] i'm trying to build you up in the faith
[1:42:22] of this house this can't just be a bible
[1:42:24] story
[1:42:25] right now i ain't gonna tell you go out
[1:42:26] there and walk on water i'm not telling
[1:42:28] you to go do that i
[1:42:29] can't say that but i will say this that
[1:42:31] if you like like when we found ourselves
[1:42:32] at that house
[1:42:34] the other night we didn't know i said
[1:42:35] you know what the bible told us that if
[1:42:37] we drunk any
[1:42:38] deadly thing if we if we if we touch the
[1:42:42] scorpion and didn't realize it was death
[1:42:44] we did anything
[1:42:45] uh that we wanted one sure he said he'd
[1:42:48] be there with us
[1:42:49] so i'm i'ma trust god in his word i'm
[1:42:52] gonna tell y'all something i can't trust
[1:42:54] one doctor
[1:42:55] i can't trust one governor i can't trust
[1:42:58] a president or vice president i can't
[1:43:01] trust a senator
[1:43:02] i can't trust none of them but i can
[1:43:05] trust god
[1:43:08] i can trust god i i mean i and and if i
[1:43:10] find myself in a situation not that i'm
[1:43:13] going looking for situations
[1:43:15] cause some folk look for trouble i'm not
[1:43:18] looking for trouble but if i find myself
[1:43:20] in a situation
[1:43:22] i'm gonna wrap myself in a promise from
[1:43:24] god and expect that he's going to take
[1:43:26] care of him
[1:43:28] amen amen
[1:43:32] praise the lord hallelujah glory glory
[1:43:35] glory this
[1:43:36] oh god let me keep going so i want to go
[1:43:38] back to the scripture
[1:43:40] in matthew 17 we read now
[1:43:43] in order to understand matthew 17 we got
[1:43:46] to read just a little bit of matthew 10.
[1:43:48] we're going to read verse 1 and verse 7
[1:43:51] and 8 and matthew
[1:43:52] 10.
[1:43:57] trying to build you up in the faith of
[1:43:58] the sound i i i was talk about peter
[1:44:01] and i didn't finish that thought but uh
[1:44:04] peter also had
[1:44:06] the ability to speak on god's behalf
[1:44:12] peter was going to church one day and
[1:44:15] there was a fella
[1:44:17] and and the prophet even said no doubt
[1:44:20] jesus
[1:44:20] left that man in that condition for a
[1:44:23] reason
[1:44:24] because he knew peter would handle it
[1:44:25] later on but peter and john on their way
[1:44:28] to church one day and they probably
[1:44:29] going to church all the time they see
[1:44:31] this man
[1:44:32] begging arms can i get a little
[1:44:34] something can i get a little something
[1:44:36] and peter just this day it just kind of
[1:44:38] hit him he was steadfast on the man
[1:44:40] like he's like uh
[1:44:43] not that i'm tired of you begging but
[1:44:45] it's like i perceive you you want
[1:44:47] something better than this
[1:44:48] so so so so peter said look on us
[1:44:52] man say okay put his cup out no no no no
[1:44:55] no
[1:44:56] no seven go have i
[1:44:59] none but such as i have
[1:45:03] i'm giving it to you rise up and walk in
[1:45:06] the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:45:08] see the man rose up and said and he
[1:45:11] had faith just to get up but he wouldn't
[1:45:13] have have enough faith to keep
[1:45:14] start walking so pete and him just held
[1:45:16] him up a little bit till it till
[1:45:18] till till all the bones began to get
[1:45:20] some strength
[1:45:21] and strength just began to float through
[1:45:23] his body they held him up say the man
[1:45:24] went from walking
[1:45:26] to leaping
[1:45:31] everybody knew that's something that
[1:45:32] happened to this fella
[1:45:34] it's the same man that was that was at
[1:45:36] the gate begging so that's the same
[1:45:38] but peter and john such as i have i give
[1:45:42] them to the
[1:45:42] they had it to give
[1:45:46] where did they get it from they got it
[1:45:47] from god they took the place
[1:45:50] here they stepped into the same place
[1:45:51] jesus had and they took care of this
[1:45:53] condition
[1:45:53] church there's some things we got to
[1:45:55] take care of as believers on this earth
[1:45:57] the only hands jesus got
[1:45:59] are your hands the only feet jesus got
[1:46:02] are your
[1:46:02] feet we got to get busy working for the
[1:46:06] lord
[1:46:08] amen if you say to the mountain be thou
[1:46:11] removed be thou cast
[1:46:12] in the sea don't doubt in your heart you
[1:46:13] can have what you say
[1:46:17] all right matthew 10 before we hit
[1:46:20] matthew 17 again
[1:46:23] matthew 10 tells us something verse 1
[1:46:28] and when he had called unto him his 12
[1:46:31] disciples
[1:46:33] he gave them power
[1:46:36] against unclean spirits to cast them
[1:46:40] out and to heal all manner of sickness
[1:46:43] in all manner of disease now
[1:46:44] jesus had given the disciples power
[1:46:48] against unclean spirits to cast them out
[1:46:52] and to heal our man of sickness and all
[1:46:55] man of disease now over in verse seven
[1:46:57] a man will will pick this up he says and
[1:47:00] and as ye go
[1:47:01] preach saying the kingdom of heaven is
[1:47:02] at hand this is what jesus tell them
[1:47:05] heal the sick cleanse the lepers
[1:47:09] raise the dead cast out devils
[1:47:12] freely you have received freely give
[1:47:16] now here the lord jesus gives them the
[1:47:19] power
[1:47:20] to do it however we pick up in
[1:47:23] in matthew 17 that they have this
[1:47:26] commission to go and heal the sick and
[1:47:29] cleanse the lepers and raise the dead
[1:47:30] and do all these great things
[1:47:32] but in matthew 17 they run into a man
[1:47:35] that has a son that has an epileptic
[1:47:38] problem
[1:47:38] amen it was epilepsy that he was dealing
[1:47:40] with amen this man has a problem with
[1:47:43] epilepsy and
[1:47:44] and this man brings his son to the
[1:47:46] disciples and
[1:47:47] and brother branham say just based on
[1:47:49] how the disciples accidentally
[1:47:51] acting they would say let me show you
[1:47:53] how to do it john
[1:47:54] no james let me show you how to do it
[1:47:56] peter no let me show you how to do it
[1:47:57] and it is a competition
[1:47:59] amen in the way that they trying to
[1:48:00] approach this hallelujah glory to god
[1:48:03] amen they're competing amen with one
[1:48:06] another as they're trying to bring
[1:48:07] healing to this this young man
[1:48:09] now they knew they had the power because
[1:48:11] jesus
[1:48:12] gave them the power but when
[1:48:16] when a man bring his son and he realized
[1:48:18] i can just imagine man y'all can't get
[1:48:20] the job done
[1:48:21] where is your master they say just take
[1:48:24] me to jesus when they got to jesus
[1:48:25] say look adam brought them to your
[1:48:26] disciples they couldn't do anything with
[1:48:28] them
[1:48:29] hallelujah he said but i was just
[1:48:31] wondering if you could do something
[1:48:32] jesus said bring him here
[1:48:33] brother branham say that boy had the
[1:48:35] worst fit he ever had that day
[1:48:38] hallelujah i'm going to tell you
[1:48:39] something the devil gave me to do some
[1:48:40] of the worst things he ever done
[1:48:41] but when he do that just know god came
[1:48:43] to do something greater
[1:48:49] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:48:53] god getting ready to do something great
[1:48:56] here here here here here here jesus said
[1:48:57] bringing me jesus prayed and
[1:48:59] and his prayer this man this young boy
[1:49:01] was loose from this lunatic spirit
[1:49:03] no longer falling in fires and in water
[1:49:06] and and he was healed
[1:49:07] right in that very same hour the boy was
[1:49:10] healed that devil had been cast out
[1:49:12] but the disciples asked the question now
[1:49:14] let's pick this up
[1:49:15] amen in verse 19. uh matthew 17 verse 19
[1:49:19] the disciples asked the question after
[1:49:21] they realized
[1:49:22] they had failed after they realized they
[1:49:24] had failed
[1:49:25] the disciples asked the question then
[1:49:28] came the disciples of jesus apart and
[1:49:29] said why could not
[1:49:31] we cast him out
[1:49:36] and i love this jesus said in them
[1:49:38] because of your unbelief now
[1:49:40] jesus did not say because of your lack
[1:49:42] of power
[1:49:44] you understand jesus knew i gave you
[1:49:48] power and even brother adam said he said
[1:49:49] he say the cyberman acts now did you
[1:49:51] take the power back
[1:49:53] no when he gave the power he never took
[1:49:55] it back so so why couldn't they use that
[1:49:57] power oh my
[1:49:58] i'm gonna tell you the problem the
[1:50:00] prophet say they had the power
[1:50:02] the problem was they didn't have the
[1:50:04] faith
[1:50:05] to use the power can i tell y'all
[1:50:09] something church
[1:50:10] we got the power we got the power
[1:50:13] we used to sing that song all the time
[1:50:14] we got the power in the name of jesus
[1:50:17] we got the power now we need to exercise
[1:50:20] our faith
[1:50:21] in the power
[1:50:25] let's just read it jesus said to them
[1:50:27] because of your unbelief for every for
[1:50:29] verily i say unto you if you have faith
[1:50:31] as a grain of a mustard seed
[1:50:33] you should send to this mountain remove
[1:50:35] hints to young place
[1:50:37] and it shall remove and nothing shall be
[1:50:39] impossible
[1:50:40] unto you i want to say that again i said
[1:50:43] nothing
[1:50:44] shall be impossible unto you that is
[1:50:47] what
[1:50:47] god said back to you because you always
[1:50:50] say god i know nothing impossible
[1:50:52] for you god no no god say to you this
[1:50:54] morning no no no no
[1:50:55] nothing shall be impossible unto you
[1:50:59] you got the power you just need faith to
[1:51:02] use the power
[1:51:07] let me read this from a greater than
[1:51:08] solomon is here
[1:51:12] god give us give us faith to use this
[1:51:15] build us up in this faith lord i got
[1:51:17] just a couple things that i want to read
[1:51:18] and we'll we'll close it
[1:51:21] here in greater greater than solomon is
[1:51:22] here since we found these 12 apostles
[1:51:25] about 10 days after god gave them power
[1:51:28] to heal the sick and to cast out devils
[1:51:30] to raise the dead
[1:51:31] oh if we would only look we find those
[1:51:35] men
[1:51:35] totally totally defeated on an epileptic
[1:51:39] case
[1:51:41] jesus came down from the mountain finds
[1:51:43] them out there with a boy with epilepsy
[1:51:46] and they could not cast the spirit out
[1:51:48] oh
[1:51:49] they maybe were shouting and praising
[1:51:51] the lord and kicking
[1:51:52] anointing with oil or whatever more but
[1:51:54] they could not cast them out and when
[1:51:56] jesus came to the scene the father child
[1:51:58] run up to jesus said lord i brought my
[1:52:01] boy
[1:52:01] to your disciples and they could not
[1:52:03] cure him and if thou can help us if thou
[1:52:05] can
[1:52:05] help us then when this boy was brought
[1:52:08] into the presence of the lord jesus
[1:52:10] he had the hardest fit he probably ever
[1:52:12] had and stretched out like he was dead
[1:52:15] and so much that many said he was dead
[1:52:17] but jesus said take him up it's gone
[1:52:18] from him
[1:52:19] and the boy was healed now watch you
[1:52:22] know
[1:52:22] and um let me just uh
[1:52:26] just read this now watch then the
[1:52:27] disciples came to jesus alone problem
[1:52:29] said why
[1:52:30] could we not cast them out ten days ago
[1:52:33] you gave us power
[1:52:34] have you taken it back again jesus never
[1:52:37] told them
[1:52:38] he had taken his power back neither did
[1:52:40] he tell them
[1:52:42] that they didn't have the power to do it
[1:52:44] he said it was because of your unbelief
[1:52:46] not lack of power lack of faith
[1:52:50] to use what power you got
[1:52:56] it's a lack of faith to use what power
[1:53:00] you got i'm gonna just put it this way
[1:53:02] you got power over coronavirus
[1:53:07] but what we got is a lack of faith to
[1:53:09] use the power that we got
[1:53:11] you got power over cancer but we got a
[1:53:14] lack of faith to use what we got
[1:53:16] you got power over diabetes you got
[1:53:19] power over high blood pressure
[1:53:22] you got power over any devil that's
[1:53:24] attacking your body
[1:53:25] just a lack of faith to use what you got
[1:53:32] and that's what's the matter tonight
[1:53:34] with the church and the people it's not
[1:53:35] a lack of power
[1:53:36] while you're born again children of god
[1:53:38] uh children of god has the power to move
[1:53:40] mountains you've got the power but you
[1:53:43] lack
[1:53:44] faith to operate what power god
[1:53:47] has given you i'll tell you what you
[1:53:50] know as i i process things like that i
[1:53:52] say lord help me
[1:53:55] i mean i was talking to somebody a
[1:53:58] little while ago and
[1:54:01] we were talking about and one fellow he
[1:54:03] was just telling me so you know
[1:54:05] he says people going to church say i'm
[1:54:08] just be honest you know when my church
[1:54:10] get ready to go back
[1:54:11] i'm not going
[1:54:14] say i'm not going say okay all right no
[1:54:17] problem
[1:54:18] all right no problem and uh so you know
[1:54:21] he just kept talking
[1:54:22] and i said you know i'm gonna just be
[1:54:24] honest i i had to process some things
[1:54:26] as i was going through all the news and
[1:54:29] everything i was hearing
[1:54:30] i had to ask myself a question
[1:54:34] when have i actually stopped operating
[1:54:37] in faith
[1:54:38] and started operating in fear that
[1:54:41] just my own question this is a i did my
[1:54:44] own self-evaluation
[1:54:47] when when when have i actually moved
[1:54:49] from
[1:54:50] from from faith to fear
[1:54:55] and i actually had no answer i had no
[1:54:58] answer for myself
[1:54:59] because i start as i start thinking
[1:55:00] about it it's a very fine line
[1:55:03] when we when we don't move from faith to
[1:55:06] fear
[1:55:07] and sometimes the line is so fine we
[1:55:09] don't know when we don't cross it
[1:55:12] hallelujah because we're governed by
[1:55:14] everything we hear around us rather than
[1:55:16] being governed by the word of god
[1:55:18] and what i say i want to be governed by
[1:55:20] what god's word says
[1:55:22] that's when i know i'm walking by faith
[1:55:24] even if i go down let me go down on the
[1:55:26] word
[1:55:28] praise the lord church right i said i
[1:55:30] said i don't wanna i don't wanna
[1:55:32] lord i know you have not given me the
[1:55:33] spirit of fear so i'm not gonna walk
[1:55:35] that way that's
[1:55:36] that's the devil if i'm walking in fear
[1:55:38] i know the devil has sent that god
[1:55:39] you've given me
[1:55:40] faith amen church i'm gonna tell you i
[1:55:43] gotta
[1:55:43] i i don't i i won't have time to read it
[1:55:46] you say if we don't have
[1:55:47] faith to heal these bodies
[1:55:50] how are we gonna have faith for rapture
[1:55:54] how are we gonna have faith for a
[1:55:55] rapture if you don't have faith but
[1:55:57] healing
[1:55:59] you can't have faith for a rapture
[1:56:03] this is serious business and we're
[1:56:05] closer to a rapture than we ever were
[1:56:08] this if we're not gonna put our faith on
[1:56:09] the line now i don't know when we're
[1:56:11] gonna do it
[1:56:12] amen at least i know y'all
[1:56:15] i know you i know you i got faith i got
[1:56:18] confidence in you that you ain't gonna

[1:58:00] spirits went out of the people
[1:58:02] it wasn't because he was a great man it

[1:58:11] found out
[1:58:12] when they met together that the same
