this morning a man let's just stop I says they continued to play that softly slow before the throne Heavenly Father we counted a privilege that we could be here this morning we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for the word of the hour a word that's so precious in there to us to God it is this word that has called us the Lord out of the muck and the filth that we ran to God and father was not us to choose you as you who chose us and for that day Lord we're so grateful how amazing such grace is upon us dear Lord and father there's a lot of uncertainty for tomorrow but because you live we can face it dear Lord father we thank you for your blessings that you've bestowed upon us and as we approach thy word but I pray that you just flip back the pages of the Bible the Lord and open up your words to us to God may the Lamb of God descend upon this little assembly to God and break bread with us this morning feed our hungry hearts we'll be careful to give you the praise that you alone are worthy of and the little bride says Amen god bless you saints certainly get to be back in the house of the Lord if you have your Bibles turn with me to John chapter 1 John chapter 1 John chapter 1 say Amen once you're there I heard 1 2 out of 3 4 hey man you there alright it's good to be in the house of the Lord ain't it no better place would rather be amen so John chapter 1 verse 45 it reads Philip finds Nathaniel and Statham's in him we have found him of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph and the family said unto him can there any good thing come out of Nazareth Philip saith unto Him come and see Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him and saith unto the safe of him behold an Israelite indeed in whom there is no is no cow my finger's saith unto Him whence no it found me jesus answered and said unto him before that Philip called thee when thou was under the fig tree I saw him Nathanael answered and saith unto them rabbi thou art the Son of God without the king of Israel jesus said jesus answered and said unto them because I said unto thee I saw the under the fig tree believest thou thou shalt see greater things in these and he saith unto Him verily verily I say unto you hereafter ye shall see heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man Amana the Lord had his blessings in a reading of the word you may be seated [Music] amen just for a little while I like to minister without on it's anything good anything good so there we've had that kind of lay foundation you know just to kind of start it off here you know you find where Philip finds Nathaniel and citizens and we have found of them who we've been looking for and Moses spoke about them and the prophets spoke about them and surely this is Jesus of Nazareth so we know so they had to have had some sort of an understanding of what to look for and so by studying the scripture of the Old Testament you know Philip you know had an understanding of what to look for so when you know when Jesus came forth you could say you know this is what Moses spoke about this is what the prophets spoke about and so and so you go Sanatana and he tells him we have found him and you could just imagine the joy that overwhelmed philip when when he told the Matheny of this and the famous response was well let me ask you is there anything good that could come out of Nazareth so you know Nazareth carried a reputation but you know my declaration to you this morning is that we're not a product of our environment we're product of the word it's the word that has shaped us it's the word that has loaded us it's the word that has made you who you are and so and it's so interesting because even as the finger responded to Philips testimony Jesus was already seeing the interaction and he was already keeping an eye on things the other vision when he saw this and he until when you say Neal came to Jesus and here at that brief moment of interaction and he was impressed with the fact that you know Jesus had that vision that word he saw him under the fig tree says a few impressed with this painting on site there's a lot more that you can be impressed with because that's nothing I'm capable of more than just me seeing you in a vision and so it just you know it's just remarkable because it amplifies the value that you hold before God then we're in straits the story he says you know and I might have said this before he talks about this auction era where you know they were of these uh there was option enough these are these these things and and so they came in they saw this violin that was kind of there in this violin was really you know it was kind of you know I'm not really look it's best it just didn't had this appeal this a attraction to it wasn't appealing and so on the auctioneer looks at the the violin and he says you know what do you guys want for this and you know somebody cries out fifty cents and somebody else cries out one dollar you know it didn't appeal it didn't appear like it was much worth of anything and so someone in the back crowd just kind of even weighed his way through the crowd and kind of says excuse me pardon me and he gets there and the profit illustrates that he grabs his violin he blows the dust off of the violin he washes the ball roll quickly and he begins to play such a sweet melody there is not one dry in the midst of the audience and so the auctioneer after you probably write this series he took a step back he says you know what offer for it now and most of it when we could finish the first class this $1,000 so this is $2,000 so there's $16,000 and the purposes will change it's still the same violin but in the hands of the master it revealed its true character and revealed its true nature let me tell you about somebody that was a nobody in the world but in the hands of Almighty God he's going to character you don't got to nature you're not just somebody but you're the body of the Lord Jesus Christ and so you find that it's it's it's it's the character it's your nature between right for God's pulled out of you you know you look at Abraham he his background was not conducive to being what you will call the father of faith you know the way brother illustrates it in Genesis and the message the unconditional covenant he says we find a man by the name of a this is his father's ring a believeth and became God probably from Babylon so his dad came from Babylon and I don't worship her that versus Texas test his genealogy that's his family's tree because Idol worshipers they pay they came to King down in the valleys of Shannara we're in the land of kadia in the city of Earth he was married his half-sister same as as they came down and destroyed of all the people there was Abraham now listen to this he says Abraham wasn't any better than anyone else Abraham was not better than anyone else but God by so they placed an election [Applause] [Music] my sister [Music] [Applause] because I'm still here I follow God's program I only point to the kingdom of God I am somebody before the eyes of God watching me but I am somebody before God this is well beyond your family tree you must approaching you need to know that you know about that about the promise that God has given to you and the direction that you're going you'll come in search to be more than just the same a religious obligation it's your paycheck declaration to the devil and a statement whose side you're on when you come to church it's on the better you are not victorious that week take much more just on these will come into the hostage God people may not know where you will cease this week they may not know what you faced this week then then I know your challenges but God knows Abram his background his family history when his dad was and he goes on know nothing said that April is any better though ever says he was a youth don't even say there's a little believer in the beginning God just called them didn't even say he was a believer in the beginning you may not know you just heard a message you may not know the background of the prophets but this message click to you and it was more than just a man preaching a sermon but you heard the voice of God and that gripped you that got ahold of you and then from there there was a seed that was there and you begin to mature you know I go back to the very beginning with the Bible talks about that in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth and I like this passage of scripture because it's there's so many got some meaning certainly became God created the heaven and the earth and the earth the Bible says was without sir avoid that is the condition of the earth something happened between when the three verse 1 in the beginning God created the heaven and earth and the prophecies between verse 1 and verse 2 could be millions and millions and millions and millions of years we don't know but something happened in the between well this earth that God had created that God loved that God cherished it was this creation and so therefore as he oversaw this creation the Bible says that this earth now you got a picture yourself in this this is my thought wrong and Floyd is missing something it lacked life there's no smell of godliness about this earth his the earth of God and the Bible is also say in darkness was upon the face of the deep and so this earth this this destroys the wall that we that we reside in was shrouded in darkness it was without form it was Freud there's something about this earth and as the Prophet illustrates it it moved away from the president's from the wrong presence of lights and saw this earth as it would appear wasn't so cast but you know what's remarkable about verse 2 the Bible goes on to say in the spirit of in the midst of all this dead explanation the spoon of God moved upon the face of the waters so this earth I was in the dead State one could ask it anything good come out of it did anything good come out of that when you just in idolatry can anything good come out of hats we can land with the wrong crowd when you engage in the whole activity when you get all these things wrong people look at you and say can anything good come out of this horse it's telling me oh there's only salvation is there any opportunity for you but the Bible says there's a snare God was watching over his creation because God had invested in his creation so he cannot lose his investment [Music] you're not control of your own destiny in their pigs away God is watching you steps and when God saw this earth that moved away from his presence God loved his creation and so as the world the natural man's thinking without we look a step press analysis there's no hope for that for that individual but then when God comes on the scene the Bible begins to say as God is creating this earth this is a God stood right and the rest right now I want you to understand the vocabulary of Scripture God said right he's not asking for permission he was not seeking Township he's not asking for advice let me tell you God was working at his creation and he looked at me of that creation these ravenous Devils that could stop God's Word keep coming the pass light and the palace is immediately within the same breath there was light that's God looking in your direction because notices we will burn and sin shapen in iniquity Lewis big cavities real speaking lies no no one taught us that we just knew that we have to cover our tracks when we get something wrong when we said something wrong we have to kind of find an explanation for it really did something wrong we post something I'm gonna shoot me things under the bed the wrong little shooting things under the rock I'm over stripping things just trying to hide things I would get in trouble I'm not lying you said it was my brother and the evidence is all around me but if God looks at your soul now the Bible says while we were yet sinners Christ died for us and I'll let you to understand what that means when he is on the cross and we cry out and this is this is it is finished let me tell you he did not just speak those words to that many the time he saw every single committed you saw every conversation that you saw everything that you've been wrong and it is finished when you weren't even thinking about God he was thinking about you that's why I could tell you Saints you be here this morning you're no accident of God God purposely called you he's a virgin I've had some battles what does get back up and fight there G not falling a couple of times get back up it doesn't change God's opinions about you your faults your failures your shortcomings just laid at the feet of the altar you come back in uniquely ricer Lord you know the integrity of my heart you know the honesty of my heart God has a ways of bringing everything back into order can anything good come out of this earth and God said let there be light and there was light you talked about the maniac of God around and I think we might have mentioned this before where this man who is possessed with devils and here you find where Jesus was preaching to a multitude and he heard the cry man rinsing the man that was possessed with demons and so he spun around and he says we need to go to the other side and as he made his journey to go to the earth to the other side there was an attempt by a legion of devils that were trying to drown the effects of the word that's the word trying to reach this destination but when God has purposed himself she reads to come to you nothing can stop that journey from happening it's just like the TV real quickly it's just like when Daniel begins to pray he says Lord you know what is this State of Israel and you can get to call upon the man of God and the Bible memory serves me where the purposes in Daniel were 25 27 days later 27 days later so you know the angel Gabriel go see Daniel and Saint Daniel from the very first day then you have started to pray God heard your prayers he's approaching I've been praying about such a sense I've been praying about such a sense it's been so many days but the Bible says the first thing is God heard your prayers sometimes the test takes a lot of patience sometimes it takes a little battle sometimes it takes a little beating so that way you can appreciate when they will not burn of Summits paralyzed because if God is gave me everything that you wanted how could you have appreciate the patience appreciate the troubles don't appreciate the tribulations the journey the challenge it's no different when you worked so hard for something you've labored you've saved you finally obtained it there's an appreciation because it came it's wet you leave hurt a little bit your back aches a little bit but you know when we receive the blessing it was well worth it so the Maineiacs of Gadara he was left alone in the tombs and jesus made his way to go preach to that one soul many people pass them by many people didn't have anything to say to him but you know I don't feel people out because you just never know who God has called you never know who God has chosen I can imagine back in the day God told Moses Moses go and strike the rock Moses did Adam struck the rock water came out people still won't satisfy Moses don't speak to the rock everyone watching Moses Moses gets up there and girl filled up he had a temper problem you know he strikes the rock he just imagine the reaction the Assembly must have to see the temper of Moses get the better for the better part of him some probably some of them probably said you know what I heard God told Moses go speak to the rock he said no example for us striking the rock having an attitude and not only that to make matters worse Moses didn't even make it to the promised land [Music] can you just imagine the people gossiping to this DeBellis find some good gossip you have Moses back here and make it to the promised land he just imagine all the whispers but you know you don't know when the person's going through something how God is dealing with them behind the scenes you might see the Howard struggles but you don't know the English player you might see the I would fall rise up you might see this fallacies that God sees their integrity you don't know what's happening behind the scenes you may cast a judgment because of what you see on the outside but you go man a gun is dealing with on the inside let's fast forward to Matthew chapter 17 Jesus went to give an example of the type of people that's gonna be at his side so naturally who comes up Elijah comes walking up right next to Jesus and perhaps everyone's amazement the second person who comes up standing right thanks to Jesus so long that people stopped didn't make it to the promised land he would never position next to Jesus Moses come walking and standing right next to Jesus surprises the very first thing that you putting into heaven people that you don't know that might be Paxton in the art and the one that you wanted that's moved on is said there's a clown and I've shown that a way to you can anything good come out of this age this generation they love the Lord Jesus gets to the maniac of Gadara he preaches a sermon casts out those Devils someone looks at him no one want to be around him he was just a mess but God goes to people who is exactly in that condition that's a mess it's easy when we're talking to one another and saying god bless you well it's easy when we're in the comfort of our seats and say praise the Lord the had that same conversation with your neighbor have that same conversation with someone that work you got to be a beacon of light no matter where you go your actions your behavior your conduct you have a 1:30 choker you don't have to say anything just snap and just condone it you tell them you just told the devil it's okay they say we're living in an age where it's not easy to be popular you may not always be but as long as you like telling them they love God's Word we gotta take a position and you'd be forced to take a position it's creeping into the jobs and as an example of that I know in Orlando came close to us when that when the when the the pulse light Club got the the victims that died we don't condone violence and we actually had one co-worker that was actually impacted by that didn't lose their life but was injured in the process and so naturally corporate America wants to rally behind think about this is your job this is your income this is how you take care of your family whether whatever position you hold and so the devil comes and he says you know I want you to carry certain bracelet in your hand to show that you're unified oh you're quite only not saying I don't agree with violence what I'm not gonna condone that lifestyle god I gotta make population and then posted an opportunity to grow when Jesus Christ became famous man this for treating the Charles dance portrayed in the home of the answer training the society you've gotta take a position it's much more than you coming to church and say hey man you gotta go out there and make a statement and you know how hard it is especially especially your member of leadership they lookin to you as an example how you gonna explain it I what are you gonna say know what you believe they don't know what's happening but these are spiritual yes they're the devil that's testing me on this ground but as long as you're certified behind God's Word does unpopular decisions and the devil is really sleek but that's not the bracelets you make sure that you're the company if people see what you do hey GV do you appreciate you y'all reflecting you the devil knows what he's doing and we realize saying well thank you but I'm gonna keep them in prayer you're you're using language they're not used to I sister shame what happened to those folks but that doesn't change what I believe the devil is slowly creeping in and he's given us a position where we gotta compromise I don't agree with violence we're seeing more of it but I know in the God that I serve gotta take a position gotta take a stand and know whose side you're on you stand for God and they'll stand for you you love the mother Jesus said and why take ye thought for raiment consider the lilies of the field how they grow they tell him not neither do they spin and yet I said to you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like the like one of these and then brother one picks up the census just like a lily where's Lily I think is one of the most prettiest flowers there is I'm very fond of those great calla lilies and palm lilies I sing there's nothing hardly as pretty as a great big palm Lily call it water lily it hurts radiance and where does it come from it's a little seed down in the bottom of a muddy muddy pond so there was a seed that was laying down when you are out there living a vulgar life but remember God said Let there be lights the power of light is so effective that no matter where you it's amazing how you see a plant begins to collapse among these concrete's because there's a stasis the wishes the power of nature that's calling the very life set itself so even though you may be fighting against God like an illusion in the process he says that little seed down in the bottom of the money lucky pond and then Lucy yet with all the radiance doubt that that are ever shine in it isn't it is right then when it's in that mud but it has to strive daily knowing that there is something it's it's it's it's black it's dirty it's like it's slimy and that's lime that it's living and yet it presses its way through the mud the mud and the lawyers and the stagnant places until it sticks his head above the light and expresses what's been here and all of it all the time every day you get up it's a battle you gotta fight every time you get up every breath that you breathe there's the battle it was about it for you to come to church you know sometimes the devil you know he'll give you here give you dollars throughout the course of the week he'll make a challenging business I'd like every time before church service he seems to Ratchet it up a little bit you know I'll get up in the morning that struggle you know just try and get up to go to work but I find the extra hard that's Sunday morning that bad seems that much more comfortable the alarm clock is not as loud as it is then a week and you hit the snooze button a couple more times you might have gone along with your wife we'd rather go alone with the husband I've got alone with the kids throughout the course of the week but Sunday learning it's reversed there it seems like you're always racing me because it's a battle and you're also a late start perhaps and then you seem like you hit every red lights and you tap in the witness understand beyond you tapping the gas just hoping that the light goes faster and turns and you come across who cut you off on the way to church and I said this last time let's hope that they're not go to the same service you're going to cuz that happened to me before cut me off I'm so upset they'll go to the same church service I was going through didn't recognize the car hide that no one it was well that's a different story does it tend to behave differently you are thrown up in your spirit you come to church is frustrated you and chaos don't have the right frame of mind and then you expecting the son here to see you happy how do we change that it's like this one brother that sold this story maybe some of you heard it before but I thought it was a little humorous he says a husband and wife will get into an argument and they were arguing all over the church husband mixer they make it to church the husband gets up there and he's singing he's shouting he's playing this man is a hip arguing upon the name of the Lord sometimes I feel like I'm gonna sting anyhow you gotta include the Bible says David when he was low in spirit he encouraged himself he encouraged himself sometimes the deacon and I'll be there to encourage you the pastor will not be there to tell you but there's a Word of God there's a scripture that you define encourage from praise the Lord you might as a brother you get so excited about the word I mean that heaven consists of the word if you can get excited about God's words then you're gonna be in a world of trouble when we get to the other side he says I think that's an overcomer that one since in this things that was wrong don't worry about it now what's the things that was wrong now I look back into that pond again this is by his predestination you brought this sea to life and expressing itself coming to life and now on top of all that he has overcome see it doesn't express yourself down there it's getting up to expressing itself so I was in the mornings in the mud that is all in that darkness it couldn't express itself but that scene when you wanna proceed it holds all the potentials what it's going to be and the moment that you cast light upon that everything that's in that scene begins to present itself it's a stir so it doesn't express yourself down there it's giving out to express yourself neither did you and your sin and adulterine everything that you lived in you didn't express nothing seed in there and they got a chance to press it suffix in life and now you're in the presence of Jesus Christ with the sunlight abroad I will you really was in the beginning so if we go back to Genesis where the Bible says in the beginning God created heaven earth and earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep the seeds were already in the earth God didn't just put the seed the seeds were already there and so because the seeds were already there there was darkness that covered the earth so when you were born there was a seed of God already implanted within you the potential to become sons and daughters of God was already in you but there was a dark veil of sin iniquity that shrouded it because you're a part of the human fall so therefore you you you behave the way you behave you acted the way you acted you conducted yourself the way you conducted yourself but the seed of God God had an obligation to watch over that seed and so when he says let there be light this sea was already here so the darkness is just telling the darkness to dissipate you move away so that we just see this on the inside could be seen by the light and so the prophecies it's the type of a human being it's the type of the believer so when God says let there be light he was looking at the seed that was already inside of you you can have drifts too far away well it's it's mind-blowing to me there are literally thousands of religion thousands of denominations thousands of faiths thousands of belief seven billion people of complain earth you will go to India pick up more religion per capita they got all these gods and yet the Lord Himself bypassed billions of people bypass institutions BiPAP denominations bypass palaces bypass kingdoms it came down to you and found favor with you your parents whether you met I bet you never had a rough upbringing but God stuff sucks favor with you the Bible says he came to the lost sheep of Israel see God is very purposeful in his actions came looking specifically for an individual when Adams fell he didn't say hey where are you he says Adam where art thou he called him by name when Lazarus died and Jesus keeps the scene you can say hey rise Lazarus rise when a thermos caught Abram Gus is an illusion Abraham you know you by name you're not just somebody that's lost in a sea of people but God has an obligation to look at that scene on the inside and you're responding to that word your actions your behavior your conduct your responding to that word that seed is materialized you said Billy gene I have thoughts I have failures I have opportunity that's okay because the Bible says he that has begun a good work in you will finish it couple more scriptures and I'm gonna let you go the Bible says this in Isaiah but now O Lord sorry our Father we are the clay and Stark the Potter and we are all the work of thy hand and in Jeremiah the virus is the word which gains you Jeremiah from the Lord saying arise and go down to the potter's house and there I will cause the to hear my words then I went down to the potter's house and behold here all day work on the wheels and the vessel that he made of clay that he made of Clare was marred in the hand of the Potter so he made it again he said he made it again another vessel as sea good to the Potter to make it now growing up I went to an art school and I did different different forms of art and one of the things that we did was actually make pottery and the way it works with any of you that may not have done this we take a lump of clay and that clay has no form it's not even attractive there's nothing appealing about it it's just a lump of clay so we have this this wheel this this turning wheels and at that time you can actually move it like this and it spins the wheel around now the technology you could just I wish I had that when I was growing up you could just press a pedal in the wheel spins but in any event you take this mop of clean add no form and so the key thing about it is is that you as the Potter will in control over the clay and God is using this same analogy so when you when I selected that clay that was grace because of all of the rest of them I said this is the chunk I want to work with this is this is the chunk that's gonna be doesn't become something of magnificent a masterpiece so I made a decision a conscious decision that I'm gonna work this piece of clean and but this clay they can't be hard it can't be solid it has to be a way where it can be soft and where you could move it and if it's not exactly where I needed to be I got a bit into it a little bit so I took this chunk of clay and I put it on the wheel but I just can't put it on any part of the wheel I have to put a dead in the center your position a Christ it's important you cannot take the Sun leaders position you cannot take the preachers position you cannot take the Deacons position that's all about closure to this you sit down and sustain man figure in your position you're more effective when you're in your position when Abram was outside of his position when Damon was in his position he he you didn't carry any King he was able to defeat five kings when he was in this position when Abram was outside of his position he was afraid of one king you're not effective when you're in your position I took this chunk of clay I put it dead in the sinner it had no appeal to it I examined this piece of clay and in my mind I know what it's going to be but for everyone else it didn't look like nothing but God knows we going to be he sees the end from the beginning familiar with drinking a beer drinking your alcohol smoking these cigarettes and smoking God knows God knows what else he saw your end from the beginning stay together I put the clay on here then I started to spin the wheel can you just imagine that they claim it's spinning about but it has to be centered and I can only imagine that how your life must have been delivering what you didn't know that you are coming or going you know that's the units of emissions you are happy or sad you know victorious or defeated you look lost all kinds of something but God got you right where he wants you he's holy to end his possession but the world is spinning all around you and you can make heads or tails about what's going on but you're in that potter's wheel and God begins to work with you so I have to go I have to get that that that that the clay work could be me or it could be molded so I had a bucket of water that I need to sprinkle I need to sprinkle some grace upon it I have to soften the hard knocks and one case I have to thought size it was water little am I gonna give up on this day I'm gonna work with this in God's gentle Hansel and then in winter when he joined the pottery he had to you had to really had a good grip cuz we always moving and I'm here's the thing I got my head on the face and then I also got my hand on the top I'm covering this business piece of clay to talk to bottom every inch of this clay my hand is possessing it and his ruler on the edges we know we love spending it was really rough and wanted to lose all similar to come out of his position but as the Potter I had to bring it back into position finally delivered back into position and saying a god in it was a serpent that whispered something into Eve that took her out of position and this same Xing it was a prophets message that whispers something into your ears that's moving you back into position then we are spinning even as their wheel spinning the powder has to continue to pour water so it's notable and little by little the powder begins to take form it starts to kind of shape up a little bit as its spinning and then I'm taking water and I'm taking a look at that water then there I began to work with the tool we could call it the Word of God and so I started to scrape the excess clean that just didn't belong there [Music] I was filming this vessel and my whole focus my whole attitude was on this crane so I started to take her this this tool I forget what you call now but this this tool I'm just guys it's spinning the work it's spinning around trying to make sense of what's going on and I'm taking the shade Reutimann and I'm just shaving you outside as it's spinning and and it's beginning to take form a little bit and that's what God was doing all along your world is spinning around trying to make sense and God says I got you right where I want you taking out excess unbelief taking out doubt taking out this belief if God's just molding you into his image the powder in that clay is such an intimate exercise where that Potter's concentrating all this focus upon that clay and you just and it has to be and the more against to take form the Lord it begins to be censored the more you start taking form the more you take your position that's what we got to when God went looking for abuses Adam worked out here we were Adam was it was not it's not a question of geography he knew where he was but he was just not in his position it's like item were you yeah you supported you supposed to be in church he's supposed to be in fellowship where you act you're not in your position some people could be sitting in church right now and not in their position and yet God is looking at you and says where art thou I know it talks to somebody looking at you but they're not listening they're just not in a granular yeah yeah yeah but you know they ain't paying attention you should actually just say what I just say catch them off-guard what did you see their eyes get bigger like what you thought myself you'll pay attention there's a difference between just because this difference between watching hearing and listening but I versus blessed are you who have ears and can hear because there's a lot of people that got ears and are even listening they are they have eyes but they can't see so the Potter begins to work with it and then what happens is that as it begins to suspend you begin to create this form and then you kind of go inside and you take your fist and you kind of balled it a little bit and then you just slowly begin to work on the inside because you're making the inside of that vessel and so you got a poor little more water I use a shaving tune to kind of show you a little bit of the excess and then it begins to take form and then you keep spinning that that will keep spinning that will keep spinning and then it begins to form and because it's in the hands of the Potter it begins to yield itself to the Potter over time at first it was difficult but then as the Potter works with that clay and you know the beauty behind it is when I begins to work with the clay I'm making pottery if it if it didn't look like what I wanted it I destroy the whole thing cuz I'm not happy but I'm not giving up on this train I don't go get another clay I use the same line [Music] takes that clip groups it dances man I messed up come sit down so we'll start again go through this go through the same process again for water try to Center it and begin to work with me taking your time little by little as its as Esther Esther wheels moving the clay begins to rise up a little bit so you're holding the outside so kind of keep its form and then on the inside you're working on the inside to take out the excess so that we could have the outer walls and you begin to work with it and then you know what happens as the clay has the pottery begins to take shape the wheel doesn't need to go as fast anymore it starts to slow down because you want to be careful it's mature now it's gone for the process it understands it yields itself to God it's so sensitive to the touch of God it's so sensitive to the touch of the Potters in so you're watching it you slow down the wheel and then I would do that just slow down a little bit making sure that it takes its form and it's looking exactly as I envisioned it I don't need to take out as many excess because it's grown like passes when I was a child I speak like a child I talk like a child I felt like a child but as I grew up I put childish things away and so that clay against to look exactly like the image I have but it's not done yet it now begins to look like that very image so we know what we to do we let the clay stick there a little bit that's what brother M says about that seed it needs to bask in the Sun ripen underneath the Sun a little bit so we let back that pot that pottery just sit there we'll let it dry a little bit and then we take that pottery we begin to put in we put in a fiery furnace because it could handle the heat it could handle the heat put it in that fiery furnace bring it out and this is the way we do it bring it out you decorate it color it paint it we put a certain gloss over it we put it back in the trial oh it's a trial Saints God God takes you out he looks at you like our eyes you go back out of that yeah and then when we get that in product this wasn't I believe in high school and we got that end product and for the first time we did this and we saw that pottery when it came out after it's gone through the trial afters and you look at it you're just so marveled at that artwork that you've done and how it looks I was just beside myself I'm like this guy this is me as a human thing I'm like I did this I could probably sell this to make good money and was gorgeous the colors just like radiant it was like it had a glassy look to illness phenomenal and as I as I mature to my minister I start thinking when God looks at you he said this is my creation Jesus is the apple of my eyes she reflects me I created this this is my doing that's the reason why the Bible says you're wonderfully and obviously made don't let no one take that away from you don't let the devil take that away from you every time you get up in the morning you look at yourself in the mirror you say I'm a child of God whether you feel like it or not you say I'm a child of God and before you go to bed no matter how rough the day was you say I'm a child of God in closing the devil knows who you are when we talk about is anything great that could come on we have was a harlot who had a history who and that the spice came in and she worked with the spice to hide them she told the spices the kingdom is fearful of you we have hardware God did when you cross the Red Sea we are hard what God did when we defeated the enemies we have hard did we keep this with you guys so the people in this kingdom the official the devil knows what God has done in your life so when the devil says boo you just say boo back let's all stand to our feet as we get ready to render service back to the brother can anything good come out in this generation I believe that there will be a bride in this generation I believe I am part of that bride do you believe that you're part of that bride I told the church not my church I was visiting the note returned another church I say I believe the rapture is gonna happen by the end of this week and they all looked at me with wide eyes they thought I was starting a new religion because they will confuse I'm like I believe the rapture is going to happen by the end of this week and if it doesn't I believe is gonna happen by the end of this month and if it doesn't I believe it's gonna happen by the end of the year and if it doesn't I believe it's gonna happen by the end of next year every day I have an expectation gonna happen okay I'm looking for the next day but I believe I'm going to be part of that [Music] that's the pure attitude day every day in the floral body chain I'm trying to go to work I'm tired of paying bills I'm tired of getting notices in the mail I'm not the only one I'm just tired of this life it's so good for like April I'm looking for cities makeup builders God every day when I get up I look forward to second coming if all you look forward to is going to work and getting a paycheck you'll miss understand your purpose in life if all you're looking for is to get that car get that house get whatever you're missing with God has called you for so I'll tell you like I told the other church I believe before the end of this week the rapture is going to happen and when I'm back in the rapture has it happened I'm gonna say the same thing again I believe by the end of this week the RAF is gonna happen your faith has to be so strong the Bible says faith is that substance it's not some mythical some aspirational thing the Bible says faith is that substance they believe that this bow hearts as we turn it back to our brother Lord Jesus I gave him my heart this morning just taking the thoughts that you've put in me dear Lord my words may have failed to really Express what you've shared with me but I pray the inspiration of the Holy Spirit would have reached down into a heart of soul and that the word would have been meaningful to someone in this assembly I believe in the reality of this word and I know the world is falling apart as we see it daily to God we read it in the papers we hear it in the radio father their God but we believe that you're bringing a bride together in the midst of a world that's falling apart uniting us the Lord with that word of truth keep us committed to this word this word that's called us that's chosen us have created a path for us - lord help us to maintain that path we appreciate the love that you bestowed upon us your grace and your mercy - Lord we love you with all of our hearts keep us still Lord until the appointed time when we come back for another moment of fellowship but in between those times the Lord give us the strength and the ability by your grace to press on and Jesus Christ and I pray amen god bless you sings [Applause] praise the Lord let's give the Lord another hand clap of praise praise the Lord how many appreciates the message Amen my god praise the Lord there's so much that brother James said I mean you can expound on so much we really do appreciate you brother Jean god bless you amen we want to keep brother Jean brother Jack all of the ministers in prayer I mean to see brother Jean come up here and speak you look at them in amazement sometimes in different ministers because you don't see their weakness you see men standing anointed back here bringing the Word of God to you you don't know what they're going through when they they leave the doors Satan fights them probably a little more harder than he fights us so we have to lift them up in prayer and all all times because they carry great burdens I mean they stand up here and they don't show weakness because their leaders if weakness came across this pulpit then the congregation will get weak also so they don't ever show what they're struggling with and we really do appreciate your brother Jean we know you go through a lot we're praying for you we love you brother amen we're grateful to have you here god bless you amen let's sing this little song together have dining on wait Lord heaven on way have died
