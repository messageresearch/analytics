always to be before you and I just want to turn our Bibles uh just a thought the Lord uh presented to me and trusted to be a blessing and encouragement to you uh let us turn our Bibles to uh The Book of John chapter 17 and we just want to read the first few verses there verse [Music] 1-5 and just say Amen when you're there amen amen amen and it reads these words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour is coming glorify thy son that thy son Also may glorify thee as thou has given him Power Over All Flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou has given him and this is eternal life that they Know Thee the only true God in Jesus Christ whom thou has sent I have glorified thee on the earth I have finished the work which thou has given me to do and now oh Father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was I also want to read um Genesis chter 31 and just one verse there verse three Genesis 31:3 and it reads and the Lord said unto Jacob return unto the land of thy fathers and to thy Kindred and I will be with thee you may have your seats amen may the Lord add a blessing to his reading amen so tonight Saints I want to use as a title the point of no return and as a subject we want to focus this evening on recognizing and accepting the word of God now uh you know when it think about the thought the point of no return we can think about uh just anyone in a particular situation that has crossed a line and perhaps there's no turning back from that line uh there's many different examples we can look around us to think about uh someone having the point of no return uh but this evening if the Lord will be gracious to us we want to just look at it from a spiritual perspective and uh you know there's different um definitions of what that means having the point of no return and I just want to read a few of them to you tonight so uh according to Mariam Webster uh an example here is the point of no return is like being in a flight in an aircraft Beyond which the remaining fuel will be insufficient for a return to the starting point with the result that the craft must proceed and I like that example because you see uh when you get on the airplane uh there's no uh there's no uh brakes that you can press on uh there's a certain amount of fuel the pilot has to put on the plane to get to its destination right and if it gets to a certain place you see it cannot go back because the few will be insufficient it has to continue to its destination another definition is a it's a critical point at which turning back or a reversal is not possible amen turning back or a reversal is not possible praise the Lord uh we we have a few other words I'd like to read according to Cambridge it is the stage at which it is no longer possible to stop what you're doing and when its effects cannot now be avoided or prevented another place we find it is the time when one becomes no longer possible to make a different decision or return to an earlier place or state so if you signed a contract uh you You' sign on the dotted line you've reached the point of no return that contract is final is sealed now in the message the godhead explained in 1961 0425 this was a breakfast meeting I believe and the prophet was among many Brethren and one of the Brethren there Tommy Hicks said we're too close Amen to the other side we've reached the point of no return how many times that I've heard the captain call back on the plane we've now reached the point of no return He says not long ago I Heard a Voice from another world that spake to me and said son you've reached the point of no return turn that means I'm closer to the other side than I am from the point where I started from and Saints I want to just remind you tonight that each one of you here have reached the point of no return that means you are closer to the other side than where you started from you see we're living in a day where there's unsettled rest but in this hour I believe God has conditioned and prepared a bride to have the point of no return realizing that where you are today is closer to where you were back then now we want to go back to Genesis 31 there and there's many people in the word the Bible that had a point of no return now why we can focus on is Jacob in verse three it says the Lord said unto Jacob return unto the land of thy fathers and unto thy Kindred and I will be with thee now Jacob was given this Promise by God in Genesis 28 where he had a dream and God told him that hey I'm going to be with you you will your seeds will be as the SC of the earth and I'm going to bless you now 20 years goes by Jacob goes into this land and he uh meets uh his wife and he gets married to uh two different women uh you guys know the story very well but 20 years go by in Jacob's life and he comes to the this point where God speaks to him that hey uh this blessing that I've announced to you 20 years ago now I want you to go forth and return to the land of your fathers in unto that Kindred and I will be with you now as Jacob goes into this uh uh return to back to his land we find that uh he's caught in this in this in this uh situation where he's caught in between uh he he has some unsettled business with his father-in-law la but he also had some unsettled business with his brother Esau right and we find him in the middle of this situation where he's going to a particular destination but one one way he's he's being pursued by his father-in-law and on the other way he he's he's about to come into contact with his brother and you see sometimes Saints I believe in this world you become surrounded by the things of the world where you have to get to a place where you meet business with God you see I like what it said here because in Genesis uh 32:4 uh we'll read verse n before that uh we find where Jacob is praying and pleading unto God he comes to God and he reminds god of what he said Jacob said God of My Father Abraham and God of my father Isaac the Lord which said unto me return unto thy country and to thy kindrick and I will deal with with thee he's reminded god of what he said verse 10 he says I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and all the truth which thou H has showed unto thy servant for with thy staff I passed over Jordan and now I become two bands and that means Jacob is basically saying 20 years ago I came here only with a staff but now I'm coming here I have a group of people on this side and a group of people on that side Jacob had a double portion of God's blessings now he goes on to say deliver me I pray thee from the hand of my brother from the hand of Esau for I fear Him lest he will come and smite me and my mother with the children and thou sayest I will surely do thee good and make thy seed as the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered for multitude and now we'll jump to verse 24 and it says and Jacob was left alone and I like that because sometimes when you are in a great need when you are praying for God for a particular thing God will leave you alone to see how desperate you are God will leave you alone to see how willing you are to endure until the blessing comes in verse uh we continue here it says and there Wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the Day verse 25 and we saw that he prevailed not against him and he touched the Hallow of his thigh and hallow of the Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with with him and he said let me go for the day breakthe will not let thee go except thou bless me you see Jacob was Jacob was determined he was committed he he had a made up mind that in this particular situation I am not going to leave without you Blessing Me Lord you see and and I believe he had a desperation uh not only for the birthright right but he had a bless he had a a desperation for us all that God had in store for him and God I believe it takes that same desperation in this hour to have a perfect faith for the Rapture amen now in the message unchangeable God working un unexpectable way 1962 0120 paragraph 42 the prophet says Jacob God had just spoke to him and said Jacob return home I will be with you you and multiply you I will make your seed like the Sands of the sea he says why so un expected then for God to come to him that night when laan was coming one way and Esau another yet God promised him amen there you are friends when God makes a promise and opposition rise that's only to test whether you've really got the word or not the man that's got to the man that's got good gold don't mind going to the testing Stone that's true see that's right when you get the Holy Ghost a husband going to run you out the house a mother's going to leave you home them things don't give up and go back into the world that's only a testing time and I encourage you tonight saints that as we are surrounded by the different things of this world uh uh God is concerned for you to make it right God has prepared you and conditioned you for this hour for you to come out on the other side it it and and God I it says I believe that what you have today is is greater power than anything that the devil has released in this day that's right amen right now Jacob had a point of return now we can also find in uh in his life in Luke uh not Luke but Romans chapter n where uh Paul reads this and he tells us for the children this is Romans chapter 9 vers 11 he says for the children not being yet born neither having done any good or bad that the purpose of God according to election might stand not works but that of him that calleth it was said unto her the elders Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated and you see the war will have a very a very big problem with this statement because he they were questioning why and how can God hate you see would look at the life of Esau and says well you know when Esau bowed down and he honored Jacob they would have a confusing uh understanding of why and how God can hate but you see God's purpose is purpose unto election and when you look at the point of no return it was not when God called Jacob and said for him to return it was even before he was born it was while he was even in the womb and God had a promise over his life that at the appointed time he would receive the birthright and not just receive it but he would have a longing for it and I believe Saints we ought to have a longing for the Holy Spirit a longing for a Revival a longing for a a revelation and a refilling of God's spirit in in this day amen now we find a love a man that had another occasion in uh in his life where he was stripped of all that he had and his life seemed to be in a Blair where he just didn't understand what was happening what was going on but you find that in the midst of all of this he started to look around him and he started to recognize some things and we find this in job 14:7 he says for there is hope of a tree if it be cut down that it will Sprout again and that the tender branch thereof will not seize though the root thereof wax o in the earth and the stock thereof die in the ground yet through the scent of water it will bud and bring forth BS like a plant but a man dieth and wasteth away yay man giveth up The Ghost and where is he as the water fell from the sea and flood decayeth and drith up so man Li and riseth not till the heavens be no more they shall not awake nor be raised up out of their sleep see Jo job started looking around and he he was recognizing that there was a Revival happening in the pl life there was a Revival happening in nature but he couldn't it wasn't settled in his mind about himself because he lost everything and he was wondering if there would be a restoration to his situation you see he got to a place where it goes on to say here and we'll go to job 19 verse 13 got to a place where he also accepted some things as well and he said he hath put my brethren far from me and my acquaintance acqu acquaintance are verily estranged from me my kin folks have failed and S and my and fam familiar friends have forgotten me that they dwell in my house and my Maids count me for a stranger I am an alien in their sight I called my servant and he gave me no answer I entreated him with my mouth my breath is strange to my wife though I entreated for the children's sake of my own body yay young children despise me I arose they spake against me all my inward friends abhor me and they whom I loved are turned against me so job is noticing these things around him and he's he's accepted that he is now in a place where he's alone and in this place we we find that in verse 25 he comes to a place where he recognizes the main thing and the main thing was he said for I know my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth and though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I see God whom I shall see from myself and my eyes Shall Behold and not another though my range be consumed within me you see job had a point of return where he realized no matter what happened to his flesh no matter what happened to his family he was going to see a Redemption day he was going to see a day where there was a a resurrection you see but later God took job a little further than that we go to Job 38 and we read verse four and God asked him a question says where was thou when I laid the foundation of the earth declare if thou have a understanding who hath laid the measures thereof if thou knowest or who hath stretched the line upon it where upon the foundations thereof fasten or who laid the Cornerstone thereof when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy see God reminded job that your point of return was not you know uh uh uh uh just when I I show you these natural things but it was even before you were born you see God took them before the beginning in church I think it's important that we have the understanding that no matter the situation we're going through God had already settled all things in heaven the scripture says thy Lord or his word is already settled in heaven so if you have hold if you're holding fast to his word then you're you're not dealing with a a a a carnal weapon you're dealing with a weapon that's already been proven to overcome now there's a few other people we can look at but for the sake of time we want to we want to we want to definitely uh just look at a few other ones here Ruth had a point of no return in Ruth chapter 1 verse 15 we find that she she comes to a place of accepting certain things it says and she said behold thy sister-in-law is going back unto her people and unto her Gods this is Naomi saying this to Ruth return Thou after thy sister-in-law and Ruth said entreat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for whether thou goest I will go and whether thou lodgest I will Lodge th people shall be my people and thy God my God where thou dest I will die and there will I be buried the Lord do so to me and more also if art but death part thee in me and when she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her then she left speaking unto her in in Ruth chapter 2 we find Ruth recognizing in verse 10 it says then she fell on her face and bowed herself to her ground to the ground and said unto him why have I found Grace in thine eyes that thou shouldest take knowledge of me seeing I am a stranger and Boaz answered and said unto her it hath fully been showed to me and all that thou Hast done unto thy motherin-law since the death of thine husband and how that thou Hast left thy father and thy mother and the land of the nativ Nativity and art come to unto a people which thou knowest not here to here to4 the Lord recompense thy Work and a full reward be given to thee of the Lord of Israel un un those under whose wings Thou Art come to trust you see when you come to a place of a point of no return he calls for complete separation you see God will separate you from those that were trying to hold you back God will take you away from the things that were drowning you in in in in a life that did not bring a testimony unto God and when you come to this place of Po uh no return God allows you to recognize his word in your life and then he allow he gives you his Spirit his his perfect will to accept what he's doing in your life now another person we find that had a point of no return is the woman with the blood issue now she doesn't have a name but we know she had a blood issue in the scripture in Matthew chapter 9: 20 it reads and behold a woman which was dis diseased with an issue of blood 12 years came behind him and touched to him of His Garment for she said within herself if I may but touch His Garment I Shall Behold we pick up the same story in Mark 5:25 it says on a certain woman which had an issue of blood 12 years and had suffered many things of many Physicians and had spent all that she had and was nothing bettered but rather through worse it says you might not see what the result of God is bringing to your life right at this moment but have the same approach the same mindset that this woman had when she was willing to sell that she had she exhaust her resources she exhausted all the things that God has given her as a possession but you see there was only one that could answer that prayer there was only one that could bring healing to her body that's right and that was the Lord Jesus Christ amen and we find it says verse 28 for she said if I may touch but his clothe I Shall Behold and straight way the Fountain of blood was dyed up and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague Luke 8:47 says she was healed immediately see when God is doing something and you have faith to just uh believe just a small all these things that he said in his word God will allow the things to com to pass immediately God doesn't take time Saints to do his work in your life we also find another person with a point of no return and I find this rather interesting because in this scene here we find two people that had a point of no return and uh we find this in Luke chapter 23 and it reads uh chapter 23:39 and it reads in one of the Mal factors which were hand railed on him yeah saying if thou be Christ save thyself and us this is one thief on the cross that is breathing His Last Breath of Life and he is standing he he's on the cross next to the only one that can save him but he he challenges this he challenges Christ to say if you really are the Christ I hear all the people are saying well why don't you come why why don't you bring us all down we we're on this cross at this very moment you if you really are Christ you should have the power to to to take us all down from this cross this was his desire you see in verse 40 we read but the other one answering rebuked him saying dust not thou dust not thou fear God seeing Thou Art in the same condemnation now I like this because this other Thief recognized that he was a sinner he recognized that he was guilty and he was he was a a right he was rightly put in that position for the things that he's done you see and then he said unto uh verse 41 and he says indeed justly for we received the due rewards of our Deeds but this man hath done nothing amiss and he said unto the Lord Jesus Remember Me when thou comest into thy kingdom and you see you have one Thief that wanted to remain Earthbound and you have another thief that wanted to be heavenbound now I tell you tonight Saints do not trade the opportunity to be Earthbound that's right you see do not trade the opportunity to establish a Heavenly home for a hotel experience you see while you on Earth it's an experience that will pass you by but you see this thief on the other side realize he he he had to bypass he his own he had to bypass the faith of believing that yes I believe Christ can release us from this situation and we can can go back to our old lives but he didn't want that you see he wanted to have an establishment in the kingdom of God you see so he said remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom and Jesus said unto him verily I say unto thee today shall thou be with me in Paradise now tell you Saints this was a thief perhaps he was a thief his whole life perhaps he did things he was not supposed to do his whole life but I tell you tonight God's Redemption has no limits you see when God created you he took the limits off and God does not know no limits if you can come to God with the approach that God is then he will make you his son and daughters right amen now we want to turn now to John chapter 12 and he said vers verse 27 we'll read there uh it says now is my soul troubled and what shall I say father save me from this hour but for this cause came I unto this hour father glorify thy name then came a voice from Heaven saying I have both glorified it and will glorified it again now tell you saints that God is glorifying his name again through his bride amen now verse 33 he says uh then he said signifying what death it should be I'm sorry verse 32 he says and if and I if I be lifted up from the earth will I draw all men unto me then he said signifying what death he should die the people answered him we have heard that the law of Christ abideth forever and how sayest thou the son of man must be lifted up who is the son of man then Jesus said un un to him yet a little while the light is with you walk while ye have the light lest Darkness come upon you for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not where he goeth while ye have light believe in the light that ye may be the children of the light these things spake Jesus and departed and did a hide himself from them now tell you tonight Saints it is our duty to walk in this light while there is light you see the bride is the light of this day when the bride goes the light will no longer be so walk while you have light in Luke 18 verse 1 it says and he spoke a parable unto them to this end that men ought to always pray and not to faint saying there was a city and a judge which feared not God neither regarded man and there was a widow in in that City and she came unto him saying avenge me of mine adversary and he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself though I fear not God no regarded man yet because this Widow troubleth me I will avenge her lest by her continual coming she wey me and the Lord said hear what the unjust judge said and shall not God avenge his own elect you see if God could if a judge that is unrighteous that has no fear of God can uh be so compelled to accommodate this woman how much more with God hear un The Cry of his bride it goes on to say verse 8 I tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth and I tell you tonight saints that your cry does not bother God your trial does not worry God your unbelief does not even worry God but when you recognize church that your faith can move God your faith doesn't only move the mountains it moves it responds to the god that created the mountain it responds to the master of all circumstances the creator of all things now in message desperations the prophet says verse uh paragraph 32 I truly believe that we're on the verge of the most mightiest thing that ever struck the Earth since the days of the Lord Jesus it says but now we can only be known as it'll be so humble see what man calls Mighty God calls Abomination but what man calls foolish God calls Mighty see so now watch it it'll be so humble that you'll miss it if you've not gotten the token there to examine it now I encourage you sa to make sure the tokens applied that's right amen now as I come to a close here I started off with this with this uh quote and I'm just going to go back a few paragraphs this isn't the same message that God had explained paragraph uh 42 it reads this is Tom brother Tommy Hicks there at the breakfast meeting with the brethens he says I think that we can say this um evening to sum up every that's been said with these words Christ in me the hope of glory say him he says please Christ in me the hope of glory there's ins and outs and overs in this life of every man I have a message I believe that every Christian says my heart is stirred this morning and I believe that for many of us things disturbed us make us better men and women of God Babe Ruth was known as the Home Run King but did you know that Bab Ruth was also the strikeout King he struck out more times than he ever made home runs he struck out 1,330 times he only made 860 home runs but every time Babe Ruth struck out he went back to the Doug out and when the old umpire holled you're out he went back to the Dugout and rubbed his hands and picked up the bat and pointed over the fence and he said I feel sorry for that picture out there there's nothing wrong in strik out but remember pick up the bat because Christ in need the hope of glory and he says we've reached the point of no return and I encourage you tonight Saints you might strike out your whole life you see you you you might have experience like the thief where it it seems like it's one bad event after another but you only need one word for the Lord and you see God says that all things would work together for good to them that love him and to them that are called according to his purpose so I encourage you tonight to trust in God and I wish to read this uh scripture here in Proverbs chapter 8 verse 22 and it says Proverbs chapter 8 verse 22 and it reads the Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before the works of old I was set up from Everlasting from the beginning oh ever the Earth was when there was no death I was brought forth when there was no fountains abounding with water before the mountains were settled before the hills was I brought forth while I as yet he had not made the Earth nor the fields nor the highest part of the Dust of the earth of the world when he prepared the heavens I was there when he set Compass upon the face of the death when he established the clouds above when he strengthened The Fountains of the deep when he gave to the Sea his decree that the wat should not pass his commandment when he appointed the foundations of the earth then I was by him as one brought up with him and I was daily his Delight rejoicing always before him and church I believe as the bride of Christ you were there and that was your point of no return you see when God speaks his word it is forever settled in heaven God bless you [Applause] amen Heavenly Father Lord Jesus how we thank you oh God for your grace and your mercy oh god father God we truly Lord realize father that your word word will never pass away oh God lord you promised to us this day father that man should not live by
