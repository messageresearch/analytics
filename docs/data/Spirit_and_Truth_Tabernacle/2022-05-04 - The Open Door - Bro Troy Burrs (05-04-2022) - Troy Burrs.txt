amen it's uh good to a pleasure to be here again i want to just thank you all for putting up with me for the past three wins this amen um i've had a really wonderful time in the word amen um looking at this uh i preached a while back on a subject called portals amen and um looking at that this message here sort of i had prepared or was on my heart immediately after that because amen um but the lord kind of took me in a different direction and i was just kind of glad when um i had this opportunity to share so looking at that message that i preached before on portals we we just sort of recap and on some of that we know that there are uh uh uh different dimensions of man and and and in this time and in this age there have been portals amen that have been open to those dimensions amen amen we're living in that time we look at uh what we talked about there on the days of enoch amen how enoch walked with god and he was transported amen to another amen dimension amen um and all of these kinds of things and uh how there's dimensions of science and light and time and matter amen but we're going to we're going to delve a little bit more into into uh into these things and uh looking at this set of scriptures we want to continue on here and from matthew 24 chapter amen uh 32-33 it says here now learn the parable amen of the fig tree when this branch when his branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves ye know that summer is nigh so likewise ye when ye shall see all these things know that it is near even at the doors now that word doors even at the doors is is is is in parallel to what i was talking about before these dimensions doors is is these dimensions these portals that allow you to enter into another room amen these are the entrances amen to another dimension amen so uh we want to look at that uh remember here that in studying that i looked at matthew chapter 24 is the seventh seal of revelation six so it was written in prophecy form in matthew 24. now learn the parable of the fig tree is the nation of israel when his branches is yet tender and putting forth leaves we know that summer is nine this is israel as a young nation putting forth leaves and summertime is beginning of the harvest time amen and so this is the time period dispensationally of what we're living in now amen because the jews in 1948 have raised their flag and man declaring themselves the nation once again amen so it's yet tender amen but there is a time amen that the door will be shut and the gospel is going to go back to the jews so when we see that these things are happening that amen the fig trees putting forth bugs it says so likewise ye when ye shall see these things know that you are near or even at the door amen now we was the last couple of wizards we were talking about being able to see amen so talking about seeing these things amen and i'm so glad that the bride of jesus christ amen we were once blind but now we see we recognize where we're at amen we recognize that we're at the door amen so notice here he's speaking of more than one door amen the scriptures tells us that this time that we are at the doors many doors different doors give you choices i told myself i was going to calm down this princeton just kind of teach i don't know if it's in me amen different entrances that allow you access from one place to another amen that's right so 34 says rarely i say unto you this generation shall not pass to all these things things be fulfilled heaven and earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only but as the days of noah we're so uh we're so shall also the coming of the son of man be so now we we he begins to open up the mystery of the seventh seal because the seventh seal is connected to his coming he already told us that his coming would be as lightning that shining out of the evening it see it shall be light in the evening time amen for as in the days that we're before before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying giving in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark how did noah enter the ark he entered the ark through a door and there was only one door amen to the yard and knew not until the when the flood came you see the parallels amen and took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be so when noah's day there was just one door of the ark was presented to the people uh for of that generation but we also know that there were other doors in noah day where people were given access to other things such as sin and unbelief they were given a choice amen to accept the message of the hour for that day or perish amen that's right so it says here in second peter the first chapter the 11th verse amen for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ this word entrance this word entrance means an act of entering it or doing word i mean it's a verb it's an action word that we do it's something we have to do hey man so uh uh i know a lot of we come out it's not by works and things of that nature just you know by faith and i believe you got to have faith you have to believe the word but you also got to do something right amen they could have sat out there at noor's day and said i believe and i have faith and i've accepted the message but never make the step to go into the art they still perish with their faith that's right see so there's always let nobody deceive you there's something that you have to do it may be ye doers of the word and not hearers only there's something you have to do amen it is an action word amen is uh uh it's not just a a mythical i just believe yeah i believe it i believe it i believe it but you also have to do something about what you believe amen so the door is an entrance into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ is something as the scripture tells us here that is mis uh ministered to us and is like a key of faith that causes us to enter the ministry of the word is an entrance being ministered as it was in noah's message it was preached that caused those who believed his message to go through the door of the ark amen now brother branham preached a message amen preached on this message of doors amen many times throughout his ministry amen doors and doors and different ones it's just three or four five different messages i believe it was that he preached on doors and one throughout the message often connected to our personal life amen where we we are a building a man and in any building has doors and compartments and rooms amen believer in reference to doors indoors that the prophet preached there uh he would explain to us just inside your heart there are many doors just like a house or front entrance and in the room they have many doors within the house amen but with many doors give entrances into the room many people want jesus to come into the heart amen through the front door amen but don't want to allow him access to the other rooms amen amen so our heart amen should be open amen to to to to all that the word has to and to to him all our doors amen that he be lord of our house doors are also gives people entrance and access to whatever is beyond the door on the other side amen doors are used even importantly to keep people from entering amen so it is a a synonymous doors also to keep valuables safe right amen to keep people from entering places that we don't want them entering and man at night day time every time in this society and these days amen we lock our doors used to be a time you just have to lock them at night like them all the time now my wife's getting don't sit up in here with the door open unlock don't sit up in here lock them doors say baby i'm here i i know i'm glad you're here but lock that door doors give people entrance amen so amen we lock our car doors when we park them right amen lock our house doors amen are we reminded of a a a a bank vault amen is uh has uh huge doors with multiple huge steel pins a man that's to keep uh valuables safe amen see uh so uh uh there's another aspect of a door a door can be used to seal off great things of value so we are all familiar with doors and their uses and the scripture speaks of doors in many places in the bible we're going to take a look at one in genesis amen um we talked about noah here but i want to look at one here amen uh in in genesis here we we see that uh i want to find it here i'm kind of getting ahead of myself amen i'm sorry bear with me amen we look at genesis the sixth chapter i just continue going from where i'm at here amen genesis the sixth chapter the end of flesh uh it says and god said to noah the end of all flesh has come before me for the earth is filled with violence through them and behold i will destroy them which sit upon the earth make an ark of gopher wood room rooms shall be made in the ark and shall pitch it within and without and pitch with pitch and this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of the length of the ark shall be 300 cubits and the breath shall be 50 cubits and the height shall be 30 cubits a window shall a window shall thou make in new york and in a cubit shall thou finish it above and a door of the ark shall thou set in the side thereof which uh with look with lower second and third stories shall thou make it and behold i even uh and behold i even i do bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh wherein is wherein is the breath of life from under the heaven and everything that is in the earth shall die amen so we find the door was associated with noah in the ark amen the door that god used to shut them uh up shut them with the people that believed the message of the hour amen the seventh and they went into noah's ark two by two all flesh where is the breath of life amen and they that went in went in male female of all flesh and god had commanded him the door to be shut amen we see that no man can open the door no man can shut the door amen and we've had a door open in our time amen but no man can shut that door amen so john uh 10 uh the 10th chapter the seventh verse says then jesus said unto him again verily verily i say unto you i am the door and the sheep i am he says i say unto you i am the door of the sheep amen all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the sheep did not hear them i am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture amen so we see here that john is referring uh jesus in the book of john they say he is the door amen christ is that door amen you must have a revelation amen to uh who he is in this hour amen for that door to have access to that door amen revelation 4 1 after this door i looked and beheld after this i looked and beheld a door was open amen so here's where we get into the meat of it after this i looked and beheld this is john on the isle of patmos amen where he uh seen the visions and everything and he said he looked and he beheld a door was open in heaven amen and uh uh the first voice which i heard was as it were a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will show you things which must be hereafter amen so he had to come up here there was a door open and he said come up hither so when we were speaking on last time about those dimensions we were talking about hearing these dimensions of mortal there is another door above us amen i should say above us we say above because it's just how it's in another dimension it is a place where the believers live in amen because we are potentially in the rapture now amen see our mind and our concept of living in life has is being changed and being transformed amen so through the revelation of the word of the hour we are living above lady ocean amen we are not of lady lucille because we are not blind we are not naked wretched and miserable and don't know it amen that is the i that's that's the condition of lady of seal i beg to differ with the bride we are not in ladies seal we are seated right in heavenly places amen so i was thinking in our activities and our actions and the things that we do the way this is why we're different people sometimes can't understand well why do you dress that way and why do you act that way and why do you do the things that you do because we're not living in the same room that you're living in amen the prophet has come amen that we have received an entrance the entrance has been ministered to us amen and we have not rejected it but we have received it and because of that by the holy ghost we have stepped through another door a door has been open amen when the seven seals amen in 63 the door was open amen and the message the entrance was preached amen a key was given amen and we have received that message and amen that we are doers of it amen we we we've taken off we've put on we've changed our activities amen now uh uh we live according to the word of god amen we live according to the word of god through a prophetic anointing amen that is the entrance amen that is the door that was open amen many ministries have doors open many ministries they they do the same thing they go to church and and they do things but just like we were saying before there's a door offered amen but they keep certain doors closed amen we'll we'll open the doors of the church and and we come and we feel good amen but they want to let them back in that back room all of the doors are wide open and the house is clean make yourself at home lord you are lord of all amen so we find ourselves in that condition i mean in this very hour and has raised us up together to seek in heavenly places in christ jesus says we also find in revelation 3 that there was a door on the knocking and trying to get in because in the end time that ladies and age amen he was shut out of his own church by their creeds and dogmas of man's religion and the interpretation of the word you can't fellowship with god and disagree with his word at the same time you just can't do it amen you he says behold revelation 3 20 says behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice he will open that the door i will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me so notice what's happening here that the opening of the door is connected to the receiving of truth all right amen that uh that's what would have opened the door to christ for him to come in the receiving of truth amen so in john 5 it says search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life but they are they which testify of me amen and we will not come to me ye might have life i receive not honor from men but i know you that ye have not the love of god in you i am come in my father's name and ye receive me not if another shall come in his name in his own name you shall receive him not a prophet preached a message called blasphemous name so you won't receive he said i come in my name but you'll receive methodist baptists presbyterian this is what i am and this is what i am and you'll receive those names if they had received the truth of the message of this hour because that is who christ is in this day he is the mighty god unveiled and revealed to us by his own word that has been revealed in this hour amen now and i think i got something double printed here now in the process here genesis 4 uh 3 7. genesis 4 3 3 i want you to take a look at something and in the process of time it came to pass that cain brought forth fruit of the ground an offering unto the lord and abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fact thereof and the lord had respect unto abel and to his offering but unto cain but unto cain and to his offering he had not respect and cain was very roth and his countenance failed and the lord said unto cain why are they wroth and why is thy spirit why is thy countenance falling he was wrong because he wanted god to accept worship in the way that he chose to worship but god had only has one provided place of worship amen and one key will open that door amen so this is a type of the the world today of this day that who refuse the truth of the word of god for this hour fourth day for the doctrines of man if thou doest well thou shalt not thou shalt not be accepted if thou if thou doest swell shalt thou not be accepted it's a question and if out if thou doest not will sin lieth at the door amen so cain was offered a man an entrance into the door same way the people of noah's day was offered an entrance to the door the same way in this day people are offered an entrance amen to the door we see cain he was off at that entrance we see here that god's instruction to cain that if he submits to the word in humility then he would be accepted in other words the interest of grace and acceptance of god would open to him but if he rejects the counsel of god then other doors would be open to him were seeing life and so when cain rejected the door of truth god had offered to him a door of sin was opened yeah amen and a spirit come through that door a murderous spirit that caused him to slow kill his brother so we see that the same oak that rejecting the door of the opening of the word will also cause you you're gonna look you're going through a door [Laughter] yeah glory you might as well accept the door that god has opened to you for safety and the revelation of truth because if not you have opened up another door amen where demon experience would bombard you when you reject the door that god has offered you that's it that's exactly right now we're living in that time my brothers and sisters we see that this is this is going with when the when the people it us they rejected that door the only other door that was open to them was death right and when cain rejected truth refused to walk through that door because he wanted to worship in his own way that's right there was another door open a spirit had entered into him that caused him to murder his brother what a terrible spirit don't think for one minute that the rejection of the word in this hour won't bring the same results you may not murder with a knife you may not shoot your brother with a gun but every time you reject the word of the hour what you murder with your tongue every time you reject the word of god they go around murdering with their tongue trying to kill a man's influence what is it a devil has entered into you talking about these this this is real folks i don't know if this being preached anywhere else this is real life to open people's eyes to to to not what our physical eyes can see for these things are temporal these things have passed away but there is another dimension that we are living in that is more real than this dimension that we see touch taste smell feel that is more real amen let me read here uh from the message preached in 1953 oh 6 15 evening i perceive that thou art a prophet amen and i think they were numbering different as it's a paragraph 50k but you are you're a needy person this is brother branham in a prayer line you're a needy person very much in need you're suffering with a nervous trouble isn't that right you're a nervous you're you're you are a nervous really you've had a nervous breakdown isn't that right well i'm going to tell you something lady i see you as a little child you got some kind of injury when you was a little child in the neck is that right you got an injury in your neck and it's caused you to be extremely nervous is that the truth yes now he said right he said i lost a vision when you were talking to me i you couldn't you don't know that's all right there was something about it what was it he was telling you now listen to what the prophet saying now i want to make sure i read this right y'all say there was something about it what was he telling you what was i telling you talking to you about oh he told you what you've done see your brother brandon was in between he's saying it was he was talking to you i was talking to you amen says uh uh what was i telling you talking to you about he told you what you've done is that right it told you something you had done or something that happened to you what uh what did it say to you i mean what was i telling you see lady it's a vision i'm in another world the woman tells brother branham amen what what was said oh is okay that's the truth i see all right um that's wonderful now that's now that what not knowing you and he said uh now see you heard me speak it but that wasn't me i couldn't have seen i wasn't back when you were a little girl and seen what happened to you i couldn't have been then you know then you know you're in amen the presence of some supernatural being is that right here's something else i see you getting a little and going away from me again there's something else he wants you you got a daughter that you're thinking about a daughter that had a calling or something another to be a preacher or something isn't that right yes sir and then she looked she backslid and went away from it isn't that the truth and she uh she tried again she made two tries and now on account of some kind of love affair or some boy or something's called her away you believe is that truth if it's the truth raise up your hand then jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever come here then amen we see that even in this situation where this young lady her brother branham said i was in another world amen and how the daughter a man had a call now we know she didn't have a call to be a preacher she was just a little bit confused but through a love affair now i i just felt compelled to kind of hang on that a little bit amen you guys to watch watch be real careful and be prayerful about who you go around hooking up with no doubt that the same people the people of uh of the bride ain't running around uh uh having affairs but i'm preaching to a mixed group a mixed multitude amen there's many that might be online that may not know i'm telling you young lady young man oh man oh cause in this day and time they say that right now uh the sexually transmitted diseases are running rampant in central village shameful god shameful god so i we can't even we can't even could uh uh speak that to just young folks who don't know know better young folks who don't know how to manage their uh uh uh puberty and things of that nature no we can't even preach that to the young uh teenagers who've gone through the change and don't know how to manage and things of that nature we talking about a full-blown devil that's getting on old people causing them to do uh perverted things that's right that's right and then what they're doing it they're opening themselves up to another dimension because it will take you away from god seeing life at the door amen amen sickness lies at the door amen and another message here a door in the door tucson arizona 630223 paragraph 106. he said many great people has knocked at doors down through life now a whole lot of it depends on after depends after you go to the door who it is knocking you go to you you go you got to know who that is doing the knocking but you should at least go to the door that's the only decent thing to do is to find out who's there at the door go there if somebody's knocking and say who is it open the door who are you what do you wish oh many uh that was back in his day now you look through the peephole and holler what you want you know open those in this day now um many might be uh some great person what if it's a great person it'd be a great honor to you to open the door for some body uh that was a great somebody amen that great person so he is speaking there in the scripture of revelation 3 20 because christ is the greatest person that there could ever be amen behold i stand at the door and knock amen so this is speaking of the age that we're living in this is the only way this is the this is also the same period of time of when the jews are back to their homeland and the fig tree putting forth its buds as in our opening scripture in matthew 24. now uh remember the same holy spirit that was performing miracles and healings and discernments in brother branham's day is the is bringing us to the truth of this day because the healing of our body brings temporal healing to your temporal body but the truth of the words bring eternal relationship with god the revealed opens a door to god's eternal day amen philadelphia church age it is to this church age that jesus said behold uh i come quickly that makes the last age very short ladies is the age of a quick work it'll cut short now we will specifically dwell on the open door that no man can shut here in the philadelphia church age he says first of all i want to dwell on this door as signifying the tremendous missionary efforts of the age of paul paul called a new missionary endeavor for the lord an open door amen furthermore when i come to uh choice to preach christ's gospel a door was open unto me okay amen so we see uh that the comparison of the scripture that this open door signifies the greatest spreading of the gospel the world has ever seen amen i want to i want you to see something here god works in threes amen he on the third pergamos church age that the church was married to the state the deeds of the nickelodeism and become a doctrine of nicolaiticism that age was the open door to the false vine once it had backed up by the power of the state it became actually a world system even though it bore the name christian thus it spread like wildfire amen but now three ages later after a after long a hard struggle of faith here comes the open door of truth amen we are living in the age right now of that open door amen of truth we see my brothers and sisters through all these examples amen and there's there's many many more he says uh uh uh in the scripture there uh ask and you shall receive seek and ye shall find knock and the door shall be opened unto you amen i want to stretch to you my brothers and sisters that there is a door of truth and you must walk through that door the danger in rejecting that door is that there is another door presented to you there is a danger in rejecting that door many people come and they sit up under the word visitors and different ones it is a dangerous thing to reject the message in this hour spirits are real and they're subtle and they're subtle we look at the crime around the world they're just full of violence and people have seemed to have just lost their mind seem sane but there are spirits that have entered i want to stress don't reject this word for rejecting you're not you're not rejecting me you're not rejecting me you're rejecting man you're rejecting the word of the hour you're rejecting the word of the hour and that's a dangerous thing and it's not uh at the beginning we talked about how uh we are at the door when the when the jews recognize who they are amen when they begin to recognize and res the door going to be shut i made a comment to a brother not too long ago i say it may not be closed but it is closing time is short time is short amen uh here in james the fifth chapter of the seventh verse is be patient thereof brethren unto the coming of the lord behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit on the earth and had long patience for it until he received the early and latter rain be ye also patient establish your hearts for the coming of the lord draweth now grudge not one against the other brethren let ye be lest ye be condemned behold judge standeth at the door amen so we see that the rejection of that door always brought judgment the rejecting of that open door always brought judgment amen so we pray amen that somebody amen receive something amen from the word i want to stress that that there are many open doors we see that doors uh open into other dimensions amen one of the things that in my study that i was looking at one of the things that the prophet always says say when he's healing people and people come with spirits and he's casting out spirit he always say bow your head and close your eyes why do you think that is why do you think that is amen because those spirits are looking for somewhere amen and and and you want to see it's it's i want to see i want to see what happened i want to see what happened bow your head and close your eyes because we don't want to be a receptacle for that spirit a lot of times with the scripture he's healing um blinded eyes and death fears he said now death is says says i have a quote here he says that that's a different because they can't hear you so he has to enter into that world amen for that person to have faith to open the deaf ears he has to enter into that world they're in another world they can't hear they live in another world so he has to be able to enter into that world amen to be able to deliver that person there are dimensions all around us amen but we are living in he told us to come up hither in our in our thinking in our actions come up hither and i will show you things to come we're living in a different age we're not lady asea rise up amen and see amen uh uh uh this world for what it is see the truth of of everything i mean it's just marvelous amen then then will you be able to have faith and really understand i tell you it was something that uh a little testimony that my wife and i were they're playing in a family reunion and um i just been so elevated in my spirit and uh we're trying to find a location for the reunion and uh we were told a park and uh so we we went down and we looked at the park and my wife wasn't real satisfied with the park so we spent the rest of the evening just driving around this park and that part that part i mean until nightfall looking for somewhere and as i was riding along i said wait a minute what are we doing and i just kind of stopped i say lord god you see we're trying to plan this family reunion just had a quick simple prayer we want to be able to be a light lord in order to to be a witness lord we don't know why this is being planned we don't know what you're doing oh lord but we need a place lord that'll be that'll be great for the family reunion that'll be enough room that has suffice all of our needs and we just kind of gave up we went and got something to eat and we got home and within five minutes my wife found a place but then i say lord look look at god look at god unders realizing the simple things that god is doing just a simple prayer amen my wife had a toothache feeling felt like she said you're just telling all my ben tooth was hurting you know she called me i said well let's just pray let's just pray pray for it i said how you feeling i don't know if it was he told me we're feeling better i know that was faith talking or she was actually feeling better but look at god she went to the dentist today and said lord she feeling better so however just we just lean on guard lean on god because we we we don't we we thank god for the for the doctors and the dentists and the and and the different things of this world but we are seated in heavenly places god is in control god is in control of everything amen why because we have walked into another door we've walked into another dimension amen let us stand to our feet amen i know that was a little chopped up amen but uh we pray that someone received amen something from the word amen to this evening and so uh just understanding when you reject the word amen there's always another door that the devil offers you amen and that door be open amen and um there's some things there that you don't want to be caught up in some things that you just do not want to be caught up in let's pray most gracious heavenly father lord god this message lord that you've given me your father god oh lord how would help me o lord god and lord just help me see things for what they really are lord god not blinded by society and um the upper echelon and society and just life in general lord just to not blind us or father what's really going on around us how are we running the people that they're in another world lord they see things different because they're not in the same world that we're in lord we live in an entirely different world than than in our counterpart so father lord god just understanding that understanding of father that through the re that through the accepting of father god at that open door father through a messenger lord god that you have used the father to to to preach the entrance of father god

bless lord be with them o father god and jesus precious name we pray the church say amen amen amen thank you [Applause] praise the lord you can be seated i certainly appreciate the word of the lord on tonight from her brother troy just um a lot there for us to just meditate on uh i love that i was just talking this morning about cain and how cain was just going to force god to accept his offering and uh just love just bringing out the point that you know if he didn't do it god's way then sin was lying at the door and i think we can see that uh in many people's lives today and just pray that you know um uh that folk will get a revelation understanding you got to come god's way amen you can't make up your own way you got to come god's way amen and uh this message that god has given us is uh is is his way recently we were there as we were coming back home sister eric and i uh we heard about this place up in kentucky called the ark encounter and uh and you know so we said we want to go check this place out and there's a a a life-size replica of what the ark was like all three stories and everything and just you know just how things happen you know just just just uh um noah and his family and all of that and um you know you just as you looked at this this this huge boat uh my thought was like if if i were living that day and saw a man being building a boat that big i think i want to try to get home uh you know and uh you know the number of years that it took in the building then even all the animals that were coming to get on the boat those are signs that people should have just kind of look they should have known god was doing something uh but unfortunately people rejected it and uh it opened them up to another door and that was a door of death uh so i tell you we don't want to miss this hour this this the scripture says i have set before thee an open door and that open door is nothing but the reveal word uh in this hour uh i was uh just going to quickly share with you all just a couple of testimonies we when we went there to uh indiana i just felt to take a couple sermons uh with me and uh one of them was uh hurt people hurt people and uh and i knew that that would be a uh that's a sermon that kind of uh really get to the core but i said you know lord this is what you put in my heart so i'm just gonna kind of go forth with it and and i got a couple different testimonies that come back one was particular brother that um he randomly listens to services you know the stream services he his family goes to the church but he doesn't really like to go too much he let the wife and the kids go but he doesn't really like to go um and his primary reason for not going is because he's going to church and been hurt so many times so here you know come preaching this sermon her people hurt people and his wife you know makes it home after service and and and pretty much he meets her at the door and he says what a service what a service and like you know that that sermon that that brother just preached oh my goodness what a service you know and he was just on fire from the word of god a word of truth being uh spoken to him so i'm praying god will continue to work that he started and bring healing to his hurting heart you know there was another testimony someone sent me today and i thought i would be able to read it to you but i guess my phone is the battery's drained and i can't read it but the the gist of it there was a sister that was trying to come to service and she said every time um that we come to visit she's not able to be there in service because sickness attacks you know somebody in her family so she was very disappointed that she wasn't able to come to church and she says you know i i just uh she said she saw sister bird singing and the song that sister birds uh sang just really began to get her attitude adjusted and uh so she began to go from complaining to just thanking god that she had the ability just to stream and uh you know lord i think and they had just done some some work at the church add some extra cameras and and uh it used to be a time where a person would sing and the camera would not pick the person up because of the the angle but they've added a new camera so now they can pick up the singer and and she says oh i wasn't able to go to service but not me but at least see you know the the people so i can see sister bird singing so she was just really really uh blessed by that so she said i come out and and i read my scriptures and say well i know exactly what sermon he can ready to preach because she had been watching all the services prior to us getting there uh she watched all three parts of her people hurt people and uh she said i know what he can repeat to say lord i don't know what you're gonna say but i know you got you got something for me to hear you know and now she said that's the word just kind of went forth she said at the end of the service she made her living room an altar and she just began to just pray and just say lord i i know that there are some things that i i i thought i might have forgiven this person and i thought i might have forgiven that person but god i want to lay it all out here on the altar and she'd say when she got it from that altar she was free praise god you know and then that's for anyone that's that's streaming the service if you would just just enter in right where you are god can do the things that he wants to do amen in your life so uh i mean just that uh uh the day that you hear his voice heart not your heart a man heart not your heart so just just you know we thank god to be able to go and just um just hear the different testimonies you know from from different ones that we're sharing and um you know that's what makes it worthwhile worthwhile when you see a heart that has been uh touched amen somebody's life has been blessed you know then it makes it it certainly makes it worthwhile uh so we thank the lord um i know that we don't have the ability to just show this tonight we'll figure out that but uh quickly i know that a couple announcements is that we do have tape our annual i mean sorry monthly uh tape coming up this friday and i know it's demonology i don't remember exactly which one but all the wrong one was announced okay just you can look in the app real quick and it'll it'll tell us what what

what what year uh 62-0513e uh letting off the pressure that is the sermon for uh for for friday amen uh but uh our giving uh we have for those online we can use zell we can use paypal we can use cash

we oh oh there was something else yeah we are planning a picnic to do that uh and it's may 30th i believe it is which is the holiday and we've already kind of nailed down the park up here at haverhill we got that already reserved so just want to just make sure everybody's aware of that put it on your calendar we are inviting uh rapture and faith tabernacle to be a part of the picnic with us so just be uh prepared for that as well amen and uh i i'm supposed to kind of meet with them to kind of talk about meetings because the saints from london they are they want to come they want to come they want to come they want to come so we got to figure out something in order for them to be able to get here uh i think you know when when people have an expectation for a meeting i thank god it's ready to do something you know for the people so uh but uh you know so i just i just i feel like we got to try something so i'm gonna try to meet with some of the brothers there at brother west coast church and figure out what we can do how we can make this happen so you all just be in prayer you know for us with that but we also like i said we are inviting the church to be a part of our picnic amen on that monday so hopefully uh uh it'll just be a wonderful time of fellowship amen uh i know that also coming up next month and we'll have this announced on uh on sunday i believe but brother brown is having his annual meeting that's coming up next month and we'll have the date for you uh so if anyone would like to go and be a part of that we want to encourage you to do that i know brother andrew glover is planning to come and speak those meetings and and he was there in london with me and so i said hey brother are you free before or after the meetings it says i'll check my calendar but i know probably on a wednesday night we will be looking to have brother andrew glover come and preach for us as well somewhere around those meetings with brother uh brother brown and and i hate to steal the preacher while the preacher's supposed to be coming to meetings so if we can somebody please you know let's try to put on our calendar to go and be support to the meetings there with brother brown amen so keep that in mind praise the lord all right i think that's all that i need to announce uh for tonight yes okay all right well remember uh sister tina and pray anybody else got a prayer request or praise report that they want to share okay all right well let's uh take that request before uh god's throne and um just trust the lord to touch touch our sister father we come before your presence we thank you for the word that has been given to us here tonight and uh lord how it's so important for us god to go through the door that you have open for us the revealed word for this day we have watched it where others have rejected it just as cain rejected it and we watched sin just rise uh people go further in sin than they ever thought they'd ever go it's because they're rejected not not not brother jack not brother troy not brother smiley not really quick not brother jerry not the ministers they weren't rejecting that they were rejecting the word the lord and help the people to realize that you were a veil behind flesh and you were just trying to present truth to him god so i pray that as long as you have the door open may they lord make a have a turn in their heart that they would come back through that door of grace that's been presented to him you're the only one that has the power to to open the door and the power to close the door so we asked god that your grace would be extended we want to pray for sister tim who's not feeling well we know the enemy lord is attacking as we even heard the the testimony here tonight brother troy just a simple prayer and within five minutes lord the answer was there god we offer a simple prayer to you for healing for our precious sister who's not feeling well we we command the enemy to lose and let go we will not accept it we will not accept it so we command you satan lose our sister let her go in the name of jesus and lord may she uh be raised in the self-same hour as the prayer uh that has gone forth for her lord any other request that the people might have here tonight lord i pray that you meet them at the point of their needs and god we thank you for victory in every circumstance and every situation uh that you've given us overcoming power and we we just appreciate that so lord as we prepare to leave this place but not your presence we pray that you bless our going out as you have blessed our coming in
