[45:52] god amen we're going to be looking at a
[45:55] scripture in the book of ephesians

[46:01] uh
[46:02] he was reading that the other day uh
[46:04] thursday it was brother burley called me
[46:08] and uh he was telling me about brother
[46:10] dwayne and he was
[46:12] teary and he was about making me teary
[46:14] uh just talking about it because man
[46:17] i've been knowing brother duane for
[46:18] about 30 years
[46:20] uh way we go way way back and the the
[46:23] crazy thing is i called brother dwayne

[46:41] just i just uh thought about you i
[46:43] thought i had heard from you a while i
[46:45] thought i'd give you a call and we
[46:46] chatted it up for about an hour laughing
[46:49] old times and everything and uh so when
[46:52] brother burley called me i was like huh
[46:55] he didn't mention nothing about cancer
[46:57] nothing like that and uh
[47:00] so he said man just being being prayed
[47:03] for him and i say i will and so
[47:06] uh i was at work the next day and

[47:26] started we was praising god on the phone
[47:29] and he
[47:30] he he you know he passed it brother
[47:33] dwayne for a little while and he was
[47:35] kind of teary and everything we laughed
[47:38] and he said he just
[47:40] raised up and told people don't let the
[47:42] devil fool you
[47:45] don't let it ever fool you
[47:47] i tell you what almighty what a mighty
[47:49] god we serve amen

[48:22] services and we've been appreciating the
[48:24] brother and
[48:26] brother troy preached a
[48:28] real masterpiece
[48:30] of the wednesday and
[48:33] you know what can we say like they used

[48:42] together some things that has been um
[48:45] really a blessing and brother quiku and

[49:26] do all this preaching and i ain't got to
[49:29] do all the wearing

[49:54] might put on the whole arm of god that
[49:56] she may be able to stand against the
[49:58] wiles of the devil for we wrestle not
[50:01] against
[50:02] flesh and blood but against
[50:03] principalities power against the rulers
[50:05] of darkness of this world
[50:08] spiritual wickedness in high places
[50:10] wherefore take unto you the whole arm of
[50:12] god that you may be able to withstand
[50:16] in the evil day having done all
[50:19] uh to stand
[50:22] um let's just buy our heads for a word
[50:24] of prayer

[50:29] grace and your goodness and uh your
[50:32] mercies to us lord you brought us

[50:38] embarking on another year and uh we just
[50:41] want to
[50:42] continue to keep brother jack and the
[50:44] family and prayer in arizona may he just
[50:48] be a blessing
[50:50] to the saints out that way and we just
[50:53] thank you for
[50:54] uh what you've done in in the brothering
[50:57] and the prayer request that's before you
[50:59] lord thee
[51:00] the brother and lord god you know we
[51:02] know that healing is a process
[51:05] and may you take them through this
[51:06] process and and
[51:08] raise them up for your glory
[51:11] and we'd be so careful to give you
[51:12] praise glory and i in jesus christ's
[51:15] name
[51:16] amen amen
[51:18] uh you may be seated
[51:20] we like to uh use one word this morning
[51:24] uh
[51:25] and preach from a subject probably an
[51:27] odd scripture that i use but uh
[51:30] we'll just see how how things go
[51:33] uh
[51:34] we want to use as a subject this morning
[51:37] determination
[51:40] determination is it's the beginning of a
[51:44] new year and uh
[51:46] i didn't i didn't i didn't for the first
[51:49] time since i've been a christian since
[51:51] 1988 i didn't go to a watch tonight i
[51:55] was debating i was having a hard time i
[51:58] knew he wasn't having a service and i
[52:00] didn't know where to go
[52:01] and i had to work anyway and i just got
[52:04] so tired i said well lord you know uh i
[52:07] think i'll be all right if i miss a
[52:09] watch night service
[52:11] and uh but i in thinking about um
[52:15] where would i go and everything and
[52:17] sometimes you go places and people want
[52:19] you to give a word or to say something
[52:22] and sometimes they they they'll they'll
[52:24] put you on the spot doc it's on you
[52:27] tonight
[52:28] and uh so i got to studying a few things
[52:31] and i started looking up new year's and
[52:35] things that the prophet of god
[52:37] maybe mentioned a prayer or something
[52:40] like that just to have something you
[52:42] know if i'm called on a lot of times i
[52:45] don't i don't like to do little uh i'm
[52:48] not a sermon that type of guy or
[52:50] sometimes i'm not you know some brother
[52:52] brothers give it you know get up i i
[52:54] ain't built like that i need time to
[52:57] kind of
[52:58] elevate you know uh uh but
[53:02] as i was as i was looking at uh some
[53:04] quotes and different things i i ran
[53:06] across
[53:07] uh
[53:08] something that that brother branham uh
[53:11] said i thought wow that's that's that's
[53:13] that's needed i need that
[53:16] i need that because you know uh
[53:19] every every year has its own challenges
[53:22] right is that right we we
[53:25] no no in
[53:27] 30 maybe 34 years of of being a
[53:30] christian i don't i don't think any year
[53:33] has been the same my challenges
[53:36] uh haven't been the same but every year
[53:39] has been filled with challenges i've
[53:41] faced a lot and you all have faced a lot
[53:44] of
[53:45] of challenges we we we've there's been a
[53:47] lot of changes in our life
[53:50] whether good or bad i mean that's that's
[53:53] just every year has his its own thing
[53:58] right it has his own thing but i i i i
[54:01] think that you know we we can really
[54:04] clearly see we're in the winding up time
[54:08] think things is winding up
[54:11] and and i think you know the
[54:13] you know what i'm i'm grateful for
[54:16] that we are following a message
[54:19] i don't know about you but i'm grateful
[54:21] for that because we we could we could
[54:25] look at modern events
[54:27] from a different standpoint than the
[54:29] world
[54:31] uh we we probably had a few issues
[54:34] uh when we saw prophecy
[54:37] me and me and brother jack we kind of
[54:38] went to a minister's meetings and they
[54:40] were sharing a different thing about uh
[54:44] uh the vice president harris where
[54:47] brother branham talked about you know
[54:49] the prophecy of what he saw it could be
[54:51] a woman you know she could be president
[54:54] vice president or something like that to
[54:56] say well it could be the catholic church
[54:58] but she'll be wearing the purple dress
[55:00] and things of that nature
[55:02] and i don't know who posted it it could
[55:04] have been brother solomon uh about the
[55:07] this this woman from i think she was
[55:09] from africa
[55:11] and and she was she was uh echoing back
[55:15] the prophecy of brother branham
[55:18] uh uh over there and
[55:21] and she was seeing where the prophecy
[55:25] uh
[55:26] was being fulfilled is that right
[55:29] so all of these different things is just
[55:31] an indication of where we're at
[55:35] right we're further up the road than
[55:37] what what we once were
[55:39] we're we're coming closer to the change
[55:42] of our bodies is that right
[55:44] and and and we know the prophet of god
[55:47] he makes another statement he talks
[55:49] about the squeeze
[55:52] he talks about a squeeze
[55:55] and we we
[55:57] we're no longer looking for a squeeze
[56:00] they are squeezing us
[56:03] right
[56:04] but you know one thing i i've learned
[56:06] about pressure pressure is needed
[56:10] right pressure we
[56:11] so many so many things we we
[56:14] use pressure for
[56:17] right pressure has has its purpose it
[56:20] took the pressure to drive the children
[56:24] of israel into the homeland because they
[56:27] were all right
[56:30] they was feeling good about things life
[56:32] was good as long as there was a pharaoh
[56:35] that knew joseph and knew what joseph
[56:38] meant to the kingdom man the children of
[56:41] israel was sitting egypt wasn't all bad
[56:46] come on they was just kind of relaxed
[56:48] setting zion but there was a prophecy
[56:51] that had gone out
[56:54] right that y'all you know your children
[56:55] will be in a strange land for a little
[56:58] bitty minute but by mighty head i'm
[57:01] gonna bring them out
[57:03] and see after you know sometimes when
[57:05] years go by we begin to uh get sedentary
[57:10] and and relaxed and comfortable
[57:13] in in our situation and things of that
[57:15] nature and it took pressure
[57:19] god said hey dalen forgot all about it
[57:21] y'all stay with me now
[57:23] god god say god say you know looking
[57:26] down at the children of israel and
[57:27] saying man they look lately eating
[57:30] listen if you look at the scriptures
[57:33] watch when they got out of egypt and and
[57:36] got under pressure they said man we was
[57:38] not so bad we was eating garlic leaves
[57:41] and we had you know go look at you know
[57:44] the environment that they were upon it
[57:47] wasn't so bad
[57:49] but it wasn't the promise either
[57:52] it wasn't a promise either
[57:55] no my sometimes no matter how a thing
[57:58] look if it's not the promise
[58:04] come on
[58:05] they see
[58:06] that was comfortable in god god let
[58:09] years go by and then he god a lot of man
[58:12] to raise up say bro no nothing about
[58:15] joseph
[58:16] who joseph
[58:18] huh
[58:20] who's he
[58:21] no nothing about him
[58:23] and then he started to put the pressure
[58:26] but the pressure was working in
[58:28] accordance to the purpose of god
[58:32] god had destined for the children of
[58:34] israel to go into a land
[58:37] that was better
[58:40] y'all didn't hear me this morning
[58:42] see some sometimes i'm gonna preach this
[58:45] morning sometimes we get so caught up
[58:49] amen
[58:50] you know looking looking looking at the
[58:53] situation and sometimes looking at our
[58:55] past but god dropped some stuff down in
[58:58] my spirit uh you know last night and
[59:00] this morning even driving i was driving
[59:03] and i had to just kind of stop it the
[59:05] light and and pull over almost the kind
[59:08] of right because sometimes sometimes you
[59:11] know god god allows
[59:15] god allows things to happen
[59:18] in in our lives
[59:20] right
[59:22] but see
[59:23] here's the thing
[59:24] um um one of the things you you you
[59:28] can't look back and go forward at the
[59:29] same time
[59:32] regardless of what has happened in your
[59:34] past
[59:35] you you have got to make a choice you're
[59:38] going to either live in your past or
[59:39] you're going to live in your future
[59:42] that's your choice this morning
[59:45] i choose because i believe that my
[59:49] future
[59:50] is looking better
[59:53] it's going to be better
[59:55] see no matter what god allowed job to go
[59:58] through
[59:59] he had a whole lot of loss
[1:00:03] is that right but his future was better
[1:00:05] because god gave him a double portion
[1:00:07] right
[1:00:08] amen the one of the problems job had you
[1:00:12] know we try on being i hope i can get
[1:00:14] where i want to go
[1:00:16] we we try on beings is that right and
[1:00:19] and and because of that
[1:00:21] you know we have a a tendency
[1:00:24] of an allowing the the first two realms
[1:00:28] to dictate
[1:00:31] to us our
[1:00:32] action set our our mindsets
[1:00:37] right come on now y'all can shout shout
[1:00:39] and shout shout shout and run around and
[1:00:42] shout the devil don't care nothing about
[1:00:44] none of that
[1:00:46] huh the devil wanted to see what you
[1:00:49] gonna do
[1:00:50] amen in the midst of what you going
[1:00:52] through
[1:00:54] see
[1:00:55] he'll let you shout in church and dance
[1:00:57] on one leg and say glory to god
[1:01:01] then brother smiley preached boring
[1:01:03] i did brother jack oh brother quake woah
[1:01:06] brother troy
[1:01:07] they dropped boy they put magog and
[1:01:10] gargan
[1:01:13] but then when when god allows him to do
[1:01:16] something
[1:01:18] right
[1:01:20] he steps back and says okay i saw you i
[1:01:24] watched you shout i watch you stand up
[1:01:26] and pump your fists
[1:01:29] but what you gonna do with this
[1:01:32] how you gonna go how you gonna uh uh go
[1:01:35] through this we can't live in our
[1:01:38] emotions
[1:01:41] and fulfill the purpose of god in our
[1:01:44] lives
[1:01:47] right
[1:01:49] see
[1:01:50] i i you know i started thinking about
[1:01:52] something i've been i've been preaching
[1:01:54] for man it's been a while now
[1:01:58] maybe shoot about 30 years or so and i
[1:02:01] realize i've preached on a lot of topics
[1:02:03] i've preached on a lot of things i
[1:02:05] preached the church a book the sealed
[1:02:08] book
[1:02:09] i mean
[1:02:10] from from one aspect to the other
[1:02:13] but i realized you know
[1:02:16] that's just a gift and that's trying to
[1:02:19] feed the people
[1:02:20] but then you you have to realize okay
[1:02:23] now you're faced with something
[1:02:27] what's your response to the thing that
[1:02:29] you're facing
[1:02:33] right what's your reaction to the action
[1:02:37] right
[1:02:38] and and here's the thing right
[1:02:41] here's the thing we and we got to
[1:02:42] realize we there's spiritual warfare
[1:02:45] we we're all in a battle we're all going
[1:02:48] through something we all face through
[1:02:50] with something we we're all triumphant
[1:02:53] unless y'all something that i'm not
[1:02:57] right
[1:02:58] and and it's in it's in the outward and
[1:03:01] the inward where where we sometimes we
[1:03:05] we lose the battle
[1:03:08] right
[1:03:09] glory to god we lose the battle
[1:03:13] uh uh
[1:03:14] we we we
[1:03:16] operate
[1:03:18] not in accordance to the word and
[1:03:20] fulfilling the purpose of god
[1:03:23] is that right
[1:03:25] see
[1:03:25] i start to realize you know what
[1:03:29] even even in the scripture says
[1:03:31] forgetting those things cuz listen let's
[1:03:34] face it
[1:03:35] we can't change the past
[1:03:39] come on
[1:03:40] we cannot change what god allowed to
[1:03:44] happen in our past
[1:03:47] but we can do something about our future
[1:03:53] right
[1:03:54] i i see i can't go forward and backwards
[1:03:57] at the same time
[1:03:59] come on
[1:04:01] you know you can't drive a car
[1:04:04] amen looking amen in the review mirror
[1:04:07] and and you gonna wreck up
[1:04:10] you you'll never get to where you're
[1:04:12] going you got to look forward
[1:04:15] in order to go forward
[1:04:19] right
[1:04:20] amen
[1:04:22] you you can't you can't look backwards
[1:04:23] you got to look forward
[1:04:26] right
[1:04:27] if if we're going to fulfill
[1:04:29] you know the purpose of god in our lives
[1:04:32] uh our destiny see our destiny in god
[1:04:36] supersedes our emotions
[1:04:40] it's gotta be the word
[1:04:44] y'all didn't catch that
[1:04:46] see
[1:04:47] we could make a choice this morning to
[1:04:50] just live in our emotions in a well
[1:04:57] i'm hurt i'm i'm this and i'm that
[1:05:00] right
[1:05:02] instead of and let me tell you something
[1:05:04] church without the baptism of the holy
[1:05:06] ghost that's hard to do
[1:05:09] because it takes something to help you
[1:05:11] elevate
[1:05:15] yes you might have been hurt
[1:05:18] you know
[1:05:19] we all know we all have dealt with hurt
[1:05:24] we we've all dealt with with so many
[1:05:27] emotional
[1:05:28] uh things right
[1:05:31] but we could we could either allow
[1:05:34] those things amen to dictate to us our
[1:05:38] actions
[1:05:40] about the baptism of the holy ghost in
[1:05:42] the world
[1:05:44] we could raise up realizing man i'm here
[1:05:47] for a bigger purpose than that
[1:05:50] right
[1:05:51] amen
[1:05:53] you raise up like brother duane don't
[1:05:55] let the devil fool you
[1:05:57] see because we can be deceived in our
[1:06:00] emotions
[1:06:01] and god don't want us as believers to
[1:06:04] live in our emotions that's the preacher
[1:06:07] that's the deacons that's the lay member
[1:06:11] right preachers preachers go through
[1:06:13] stuff don't think brother jack don't go
[1:06:14] through things don't think brother
[1:06:16] troilem don't go through things we go
[1:06:18] through things
[1:06:20] right
[1:06:21] but but we we have got to we've got to
[1:06:25] raise up to fulfill the purpose of god
[1:06:29] we're we're in
[1:06:30] warfare this is this is this is real
[1:06:34] real warfare
[1:06:37] but we got to be determined
[1:06:40] we got to be determined
[1:06:42] in in the midst of
[1:06:44] listen listen in the midst of everything
[1:06:47] that's coming against
[1:06:49] the the the believer the entire world
[1:06:54] we got to be determined
[1:06:57] right
[1:06:58] and to be determined
[1:07:00] is the definition is defined as a firm
[1:07:04] intent
[1:07:05] what you're intending on doing
[1:07:08] what you're intending on accomplishing
[1:07:11] right i was as i've been talking i was
[1:07:14] thinking about
[1:07:15] sister bernice i hope she don't mind me
[1:07:18] using her in in this
[1:07:21] uh
[1:07:23] that sister right there is one of the
[1:07:26] most determined sisters that i think
[1:07:28] i've ever seen
[1:07:31] right i i've passed it i passed it up
[1:07:34] for
[1:07:35] 20 some years i've been around her for
[1:07:37] 30 some years i've watched
[1:07:41] on highs i've i've watched her in the
[1:07:43] midst of loss
[1:07:45] i've watched in the midst of some of
[1:07:47] everything
[1:07:49] but you you know uh i've watched her i
[1:07:52] watched
[1:07:54] you know she had a desire to to be a
[1:07:56] nurse but she's a nurse because of
[1:07:59] determination
[1:08:02] i watched i
[1:08:03] i watched her i watched i think she she
[1:08:07] kind of flunked out of class if you
[1:08:09] don't mind me saying that praise the
[1:08:11] lord excuse me
[1:08:14] she kind of i'll put it to you like this
[1:08:16] she kind of got knocked off the horse
[1:08:19] she dusted herself off
[1:08:22] got right back on determined to ride
[1:08:25] away to being a nurse
[1:08:28] huh
[1:08:30] amen
[1:08:31] for a lot of folk they would have quit
[1:08:35] there's a lot of people that's giving up
[1:08:38] right
[1:08:39] quitting
[1:08:41] walking away
[1:08:42] but she was determined
[1:08:46] she had a firm impact
[1:08:51] and it's been bittersweet
[1:08:53] right the thing to think of all of the
[1:08:56] things that
[1:08:57] you know you go through and you get
[1:08:59] knocked down but you you you get back up
[1:09:03] right because it's like i i'm i'm
[1:09:06] intending on
[1:09:08] right
[1:09:09] becoming a nurse
[1:09:12] if i got to be a nurse at 80 i'm going
[1:09:13] to be a nurse
[1:09:15] if ain't nothing else but have a degree
[1:09:18] that says nurse
[1:09:20] i'm gonna get it i'm determined
[1:09:24] right come on i'm determined
[1:09:27] a firm intent a decision which has been
[1:09:30] made
[1:09:31] has been reached
[1:09:33] right
[1:09:35] what kind of decisions do have we made
[1:09:38] have we given up
[1:09:41] right
[1:09:42] have we quit
[1:09:43] you you you can't be a quitter and
[1:09:46] determined at the same time
[1:09:49] there's got to be something in you
[1:09:53] that that that's a bounce back even when
[1:09:56] you get punched to heart
[1:10:00] i still like that little balloon thing
[1:10:03] when i was a kid man it was weighted at
[1:10:05] the bottom
[1:10:06] and bobcat how hard you hit it
[1:10:10] how you laid on it
[1:10:12] when you got a profit it stood right
[1:10:14] back up
[1:10:16] huh man
[1:10:17] [Music]
[1:10:20] it'll weeble wobble but it won't fall
[1:10:23] down
[1:10:24] it'll lean over and it'll stand back up
[1:10:28] that's real determination
[1:10:31] i've been hit hard
[1:10:33] but i'm still standing
[1:10:36] can you say that i suffer loss
[1:10:40] but i'm still see when when the devil
[1:10:42] has done certain things he said my god
[1:10:45] this this is a hard folk
[1:10:48] this this ain't this for some folk he
[1:10:50] can push over and they just never get up
[1:10:54] right we you're watching people right
[1:10:57] now today just falling away
[1:11:01] giving up
[1:11:02] quitting
[1:11:04] everybody's in a battle
[1:11:07] don't think that that you're something
[1:11:09] special
[1:11:12] you're the only one you'll get to
[1:11:14] talking sometimes to people and you
[1:11:16] realize man they going through more than
[1:11:17] what i'm going through
[1:11:19] my god i thought i thought i was going
[1:11:22] through something
[1:11:23] none of us has been on the death bed

[1:11:37] dizzy but god brought me through
[1:11:42] amen i started out last year the
[1:11:44] beginning of last year pastoring the
[1:11:47] church by the next week and last year i
[1:11:50] wasn't a pastor no longer
[1:11:54] right
[1:11:56] y'all don't mind if i preach this
[1:11:58] morning

[1:12:01] here's a y'all i don't know if y'all i'm
[1:12:03] a realistic preacher i like to deal with
[1:12:05] realistic things
[1:12:07] i ain't sugar coated so don't ever
[1:12:09] expect me to sugarcoat for you
[1:12:12] right
[1:12:13] i try to watch y'all feelings because i
[1:12:14] know sometimes yeah i'm a little strong
[1:12:17] but but
[1:12:19] listen listen listen
[1:12:22] there's emotional ties to all of that
[1:12:26] come on church
[1:12:29] come on and sometimes sometimes you just
[1:12:31] got to
[1:12:33] make a choice that i'm not gonna allow
[1:12:36] my emotions
[1:12:38] not preaching by experience this morning
[1:12:41] right because things can happen so
[1:12:44] unexpected
[1:12:48] right
[1:12:49] amen when i started out amen 23 years
[1:12:53] ago i thought i'd still be pastoring
[1:12:55] this year
[1:12:56] right
[1:12:58] but i'm an associate i'm fine that's not
[1:13:00] what i'm preaching
[1:13:01] but just to show you just just to show
[1:13:04] you things can happen and listen
[1:13:07] realistically i've been last year i was
[1:13:10] on an emotional roller coaster
[1:13:13] right
[1:13:14] sometimes people can can smile and shake
[1:13:17] hands and going through
[1:13:20] emotionally
[1:13:23] right
[1:13:24] amen i was in a place i ain't know what
[1:13:27] to do
[1:13:29] right i didn't know whether
[1:13:30] you know i had a multiple of invitations
[1:13:34] i took none
[1:13:36] i preached when i went out with brother
[1:13:37] jack a few times because i was i was
[1:13:40] going through an emotional
[1:13:43] battle
[1:13:45] right and that was my problem
[1:13:48] i made it emotional
[1:13:50] come on man in in my emotions and my
[1:13:53] feelings
[1:13:55] instead of instead of taking the word
[1:13:59] but i ain't doing that this year
[1:14:00] [Music]
[1:14:03] i i was determined
[1:14:06] that either i either right now this is
[1:14:10] what i said to myself either right now
[1:14:13] you're going to get out of your feelings
[1:14:16] and get out of your emotions
[1:14:19] and do what god has called you to do and
[1:14:21] that's the preach
[1:14:24] right are you just going to sit here and
[1:14:26] wallow in your emotions and i say i
[1:14:28] ain't never been a wallowa
[1:14:31] i've always been a fighter
[1:14:34] if you jump on me i'll fight you back
[1:14:38] that's right
[1:14:40] well i'm a christian yeah just don't
[1:14:42] jump on me

[1:14:53] somebody about to kill you oh praise the
[1:14:55] lord i mean christian just stop it
[1:15:00] sister wasting a fight if you jump on
[1:15:02] her

[1:15:07] soaking wet but she'll get you a profile
[1:15:10] is that right sister waisted hey after
[1:15:12] that i'm i'm like here why should we
[1:15:14] here die

[1:15:17] else i'ma get you apart from me
[1:15:20] if it ain't nothing but long enough to
[1:15:22] get my feet to moving
[1:15:29] but
[1:15:30] we we have got to be determined
[1:15:34] right
[1:15:35] it's got to be intentional brother jack
[1:15:37] said that
[1:15:38] that's right right
[1:15:40] come on church
[1:15:41] see this the beginning of the year let
[1:15:44] me keep it uh we got to be intentional
[1:15:48] right
[1:15:49] set you know set our face like flint
[1:15:53] i shall not be moved
[1:15:57] right i'm intentional this year
[1:16:00] right
[1:16:01] we we one of the things i'm i
[1:16:03] i'm learning like i said i've been a
[1:16:04] christian for a good while but those
[1:16:06] things has nothing to do with it how
[1:16:08] long you been a christian i've been
[1:16:10] saved sanctifying holy ghost field how
[1:16:12] about okay yeah that sounds good to tell
[1:16:14] that to somebody who ain't been nowhere
[1:16:16] don't know much
[1:16:18] right
[1:16:19] that's a part of it y'all just y'all
[1:16:21] have to follow me
[1:16:22] right
[1:16:23] but but okay and being a christian and
[1:16:26] amen in the word things of that nature
[1:16:28] how are we operating
[1:16:32] right and so you know i had to take a a
[1:16:34] step back sometimes and say uh
[1:16:38] all right buddy
[1:16:39] you don't preach the lie
[1:16:41] here's where you went here's what you
[1:16:43] face and what we gonna do with that
[1:16:46] and it's all about a choice
[1:16:48] it's all it's all about choices and it's
[1:16:52] it takes god now
[1:16:54] it takes god to speak to you and it
[1:16:56] takes god to help you
[1:16:59] or you'll be consumed come on that's the
[1:17:02] heart's reality
[1:17:05] you know just like god was working on
[1:17:07] brother dwayne i like the scripture said
[1:17:09] that he talks about he's standing in the
[1:17:11] midst of the seven golden candle sticks
[1:17:14] and in the church age book he said he's
[1:17:16] not standing there and it's just a you
[1:17:18] know just uh like an onlooker
[1:17:21] god is at work
[1:17:23] we certainly saw when you don't see him
[1:17:26] he's working
[1:17:27] he never stopped thank you jesus
[1:17:31] he never he never he never he never he
[1:17:34] never stops working
[1:17:36] right sometimes sometimes you know uh
[1:17:40] sister birds just sing this song when i
[1:17:41] don't feel nothing cause sometimes it's
[1:17:45] like you just feel bad
[1:17:48] sometimes you feel like you've been
[1:17:50] forsaken by god
[1:17:53] and and sometimes here's the thing why
[1:17:57] we've been getting to ask god why
[1:18:01] see i'm going somewhere church we we i
[1:18:04] ain't got that yet but i'm going
[1:18:05] somewhere i'm still i'm still on a
[1:18:07] journey
[1:18:08] right we we
[1:18:10] this if god is i'm gonna say something
[1:18:12] here if god is allowing us to have
[1:18:15] allowed us to go through something or if
[1:18:16] we're going through something it's all
[1:18:18] for a purpose
[1:18:21] right
[1:18:22] god will ultimately get you where he's
[1:18:26] trying to get you because the footsteps
[1:18:28] of the righteous is ordered by the lord
[1:18:32] right and sometimes you know we we look
[1:18:35] at we look at uh
[1:18:38] oh god i'm trying to think now he just
[1:18:41] he jumped off the boat y'all helped me
[1:18:45] jonah there we go somebody read the
[1:18:47] bible
[1:18:48] huh
[1:18:50] jonah
[1:18:51] john
[1:18:52] went i like you know what i thank god
[1:18:54] for for inspiration
[1:18:56] because because a lot of people they
[1:18:58] look at jonah
[1:19:00] but we had a prophet
[1:19:02] right we had a prophet
[1:19:04] jonah thought he was escaping
[1:19:08] the commission
[1:19:10] huh but he was right in the will of god
[1:19:15] jumping over boy
[1:19:18] huh
[1:19:19] he thought well i'm out of here them
[1:19:21] people down there rough
[1:19:23] i'm not going down up in there god i say
[1:19:26] but god in his mind say you going
[1:19:30] you going and when you get there they
[1:19:32] gonna hear you because when you're when
[1:19:34] you
[1:19:35] when you arrive
[1:19:37] and you step out the wells the whales
[1:19:40] belly
[1:19:41] see that was their god
[1:19:44] so so when when they saw when they saw a
[1:19:47] man jonah's stepping walk out and get
[1:19:50] him to decree of god they say wait a
[1:19:52] minute wait a minute it's more than just
[1:19:53] a man speaking here
[1:19:55] it caused them it caused them to repent
[1:19:59] and cyclots and ashes
[1:20:01] and then job got mad cause they repented
[1:20:04] a lot joke noah not noah either jonah
[1:20:07] y'all help me huh
[1:20:10] see what he thought sometimes sometimes
[1:20:12] we might think like
[1:20:14] you know just seem like i've been
[1:20:16] sidetracked no the footsteps of the
[1:20:18] orders are
[1:20:19] the righteous is the order of the lord
[1:20:22] see god don't tell you everything all at
[1:20:25] once
[1:20:26] god wants us to walk by faith
[1:20:29] and be determined that you know what i'm
[1:20:33] i'm i'm when it even don't when it don't
[1:20:35] even look like it i feel like i'm still
[1:20:37] in the will of god
[1:20:39] even when i don't completely know what
[1:20:41] the perfect will of god is for me right
[1:20:44] now
[1:20:45] i i i i can do one or two things i could
[1:20:48] just
[1:20:49] sedentary i know brother branham says
[1:20:52] you know
[1:20:52] the bride don't move till she got thus
[1:20:54] said to lord
[1:20:56] see we take all of these quotes and
[1:20:58] sometimes we take things out of context
[1:21:00] too
[1:21:01] right
[1:21:02] uh god god wants us because he said it
[1:21:04] just should walk live by faith
[1:21:07] and so sometimes god wants us to walk
[1:21:11] by faith and not by sight brother bible
[1:21:13] said he got in a lot of trouble because
[1:21:16] he was always sitting around waiting on
[1:21:17] god
[1:21:19] to show him something
[1:21:20] right y'all heard that
[1:21:22] nah now i'm preaching off my head
[1:21:25] my inspiration so
[1:21:27] but somebody got a computer we could
[1:21:29] pull it up for you
[1:21:30] right
[1:21:31] but we we've got to be determined
[1:21:34] right
[1:21:36] amen so he says this uh determination is
[1:21:39] defined as a firm intent or a decision
[1:21:42] which has been reached
[1:21:44] an example determined
[1:21:46] is the strength
[1:21:48] to keep applying for jobs after being
[1:21:51] turned down by a dozen potential right
[1:21:55] because you can get so discouraged but
[1:21:57] you say what
[1:21:58] somebody is going to give me a chance
[1:22:01] see having a strong feeling that you are
[1:22:04] going to do something
[1:22:06] that you will not allow
[1:22:08] anyone or anything to stop you
[1:22:13] right
[1:22:14] and and that's the way that we got to
[1:22:16] live as christians church
[1:22:18] nothing is going to be handed to us
[1:22:21] right
[1:22:22] amen see it's it's it's uh
[1:22:26] uh not weak or uncertain right
[1:22:29] or having
[1:22:30] having a show of determination
[1:22:33] brother branham he says in here in jesus
[1:22:36] christ's name i mean in shalom what i'm
[1:22:39] talking about lord help us in the
[1:22:41] message shalom
[1:22:43] in 1964
[1:22:45] he said oh lord let me stay with
[1:22:48] the word
[1:22:49] let me tell you something church when i
[1:22:51] read that i said that's that's a real
[1:22:54] powerful statement
[1:22:55] see maybe y'all don't
[1:22:57] y'all should understand it whether
[1:22:58] you're a preacher don't
[1:23:00] are not a preacher it's difficult to
[1:23:03] stay with the word more difficult than
[1:23:05] we realize
[1:23:06] see as as a as a man of god
[1:23:09] because we've seen it scripturally
[1:23:12] where servants of god
[1:23:15] has has
[1:23:16] uh
[1:23:17] bit the word or left the word because of
[1:23:20] the pressure
[1:23:22] right right
[1:23:24] look look at look at uh saul
[1:23:28] right
[1:23:29] the people's the people's king
[1:23:32] right under under the pressure
[1:23:36] he did something that the word told him
[1:23:38] not to do
[1:23:41] god god said sent the messenger down
[1:23:44] said you saw and saul was like man what
[1:23:46] you talking about
[1:23:48] not me man i did everything that god
[1:23:50] said dude
[1:23:52] i would say what's all that bleating
[1:23:54] that the sheep then
[1:23:56] what's all of that that well then then
[1:23:59] watch what he do with the people
[1:24:03] the the pressure
[1:24:05] see y'all don't even really know the
[1:24:07] pressure of a pastor
[1:24:09] the the the the
[1:24:12] pressure of the people
[1:24:15] and you're trying to you know y'all pray
[1:24:17] for brother jack
[1:24:19] it's not easy this is a very diverse
[1:24:22] group of people
[1:24:23] we've all come from different
[1:24:25] backgrounds we all educated different
[1:24:28] cultures and it's it's hard to just try
[1:24:32] to uh keep a balance
[1:24:36] right
[1:24:36] and because every individual and every
[1:24:40] individual in that family is
[1:24:42] different
[1:24:44] right
[1:24:45] come on husbands and wives y'all might
[1:24:48] be together as a union but most often
[1:24:50] you've been raised up different from
[1:24:53] different backgrounds come on church
[1:24:58] different backgrounds
[1:25:00] right
[1:25:01] but but god brought you together from a
[1:25:04] union and and over here
[1:25:07] this one might have been hurting this
[1:25:08] and that from his daddy and over here
[1:25:11] this one might have been hurt from his
[1:25:13] mama and god brings them a man together
[1:25:16] in a union and then he places them in
[1:25:18] spirit and true tabernacle and say
[1:25:20] brother duff they're yours
[1:25:23] feed them
[1:25:25] by inspiration feed them
[1:25:28] bring them to this place of maturity
[1:25:30] because you're out of the ephesians 4
[1:25:32] ministry
[1:25:34] feed them and he get up quite
[1:25:37] scratches his head and say lord what am
[1:25:40] i going to do and that's why you got to
[1:25:42] depend on the world
[1:25:45] see
[1:25:46] as a shepherd even as a minister you
[1:25:49] cannot be an emotional person
[1:25:52] you you can't allow the emotions of the
[1:25:56] church to dictate your actions or you're
[1:25:58] going to be in trouble
[1:26:01] come on i'm going to let y'all on a
[1:26:03] secret right when i shepherded i was
[1:26:06] probably harder on family members than i
[1:26:08] was on lap other folk why because people
[1:26:11] was gonna look at how he treating his
[1:26:14] family
[1:26:15] i'm preaching now y'all don't quit on me
[1:26:18] huh how what is he gonna do about his
[1:26:21] family
[1:26:22] how is he going to handle his family
[1:26:24] look look at look at look at you know
[1:26:28] the priests the eli
[1:26:30] look how he handled his family his sons
[1:26:32] was ravishing
[1:26:34] taking the money from the people and
[1:26:36] everything else and he just kind of sat
[1:26:38] there
[1:26:39] come on
[1:26:41] when it it was his job
[1:26:44] to to
[1:26:45] to correct
[1:26:48] right
[1:26:49] that the hardest part about this is
[1:26:52] because it's so many emotions
[1:26:55] and and so many things and and and
[1:26:58] man you know people are easily offended
[1:27:02] it makes it difficult
[1:27:05] come on
[1:27:06] maybe y'all don't know what i'm talking
[1:27:08] about
[1:27:09] it makes it difficult
[1:27:12] to to stay in the middle of the road
[1:27:15] with the work because that's the only
[1:27:17] thing that's going to bring change
[1:27:19] that's the only thing that's going to
[1:27:20] rapture
[1:27:22] i'm going somewhere now
[1:27:24] right watch
[1:27:25] watch this see
[1:27:27] we we take a a simple statement we just
[1:27:30] say well no it's a depth
[1:27:34] because we in between the lines this
[1:27:36] morning
[1:27:37] right let me
[1:27:39] let me stay with him the word
[1:27:43] right come on church
[1:27:46] now put yourself in the minister's place
[1:27:48] because we have all of these
[1:27:50] expectations for the ministry
[1:27:53] but y'all real quiet on me
[1:27:56] huh
[1:27:58] we we we place all of these expectations
[1:28:00] on the ministry
[1:28:03] well you know brother jack got to have
[1:28:05] this standard and if he move away from
[1:28:07] that
[1:28:09] man let me tell you and sister erica she
[1:28:12] has to maintain this certain you know uh
[1:28:16] status and and then we get real
[1:28:19] legalistic and the bible says
[1:28:21] right
[1:28:22] a bishop oh then we start quoting the
[1:28:25] scripture
[1:28:27] we start quoting the scripture when it's
[1:28:30] the when it's the bishop and the bishop
[1:28:32] wife and then when it's the deacon
[1:28:34] because his qualification is kind of the
[1:28:36] same
[1:28:37] right
[1:28:38] well you know they supposed to be
[1:28:40] hospitable and and and this and they
[1:28:42] supposed to do this and they supposedly
[1:28:44] died
[1:28:45] but things change
[1:28:48] when it comes to us
[1:28:53] well praise the lord brothers come on
[1:28:55] preach with me lights glory to god
[1:28:58] about the priests of the lights because
[1:29:00] y'all ain't gonna preach with me this
[1:29:01] morning
[1:29:05] come on
[1:29:07] that that's a powerful statement more
[1:29:08] powerful than we than we realize right
[1:29:12] glory to god see if he has to stay with
[1:29:15] the word
[1:29:16] then we have to stay with the word
[1:29:19] see
[1:29:20] apart from the word fulfilling the
[1:29:23] purpose of god is not a void you'll
[1:29:25] never be able to do it
[1:29:27] that's right
[1:29:29] and see let's take our expectations
[1:29:33] we all we listen we're in a battle now
[1:29:37] right because the word can't change for
[1:29:40] you
[1:29:41] and it means one thing for you and
[1:29:43] another thing for you and another thing
[1:29:45] for this family and another thing for
[1:29:47] that family and
[1:29:51] y'all blame brother jack he he got me up
[1:29:53] here
[1:29:54] so
[1:29:55] president he told me he wanted me to do
[1:29:57] this i was trying to back out but he
[1:29:59] said no nobody ain't gonna let you do it
[1:30:03] right let me stay with the word not now
[1:30:06] this is new this is new year thought
[1:30:08] right from shalom
[1:30:10] he said let oh let me stay with him the
[1:30:13] word
[1:30:15] watch this and manifest his light
[1:30:19] right right
[1:30:20] the word is light
[1:30:23] right
[1:30:24] the the manifested word is light in its
[1:30:27] age
[1:30:28] when we can see it
[1:30:29] it ain't light when you can't see it
[1:30:31] it's light when you can see it
[1:30:35] see
[1:30:36] church i'm never preaching religion
[1:30:39] and i you know really realistically i'm
[1:30:42] not even preaching to y'all flesh i can
[1:30:44] work y'all up that's easy
[1:30:47] right but i try to deal with the seed of
[1:30:50] the soul and bring the reality from the
[1:30:52] word because that's light
[1:30:56] that's light and if we're ever going to
[1:30:58] manifest anything it's got to come from
[1:31:00] the word
[1:31:02] right
[1:31:04] see i even me on a personal note i can't
[1:31:06] sit back and and
[1:31:08] you know all it is it's like it's not
[1:31:11] gonna work for me like that come on
[1:31:14] the same god that deals with me got to
[1:31:16] be dealing with you in the same line
[1:31:18] right right look son
[1:31:20] you know your pity parties and your
[1:31:22] emotions and and and your why's and all
[1:31:26] of that forget about that stuff bro
[1:31:29] forget about that stuff here's the harsh
[1:31:31] reality you just got to be determined
[1:31:34] is that right
[1:31:36] intentional to move forward
[1:31:40] if if something happened god allowed it
[1:31:43] had to happen if she said this and he
[1:31:46] said that if they did this god allowed
[1:31:50] them to do that
[1:31:54] right
[1:31:54] the same god that allowed that allowed
[1:31:57] job to go through the same god that's
[1:31:59] allowing you to go through
[1:32:01] right but here's the thing that's a
[1:32:03] double portion at the end of the trial
[1:32:07] right
[1:32:09] there's a manifestation after the trial
[1:32:12] take your child up and and and you know
[1:32:15] offer him up all right
[1:32:18] wow big trial
[1:32:21] final test
[1:32:22] but then once he says and and manifests
[1:32:25] his life through all of us
[1:32:28] as we set forth in this new
[1:32:31] year
[1:32:32] with a determination
[1:32:34] that's all of us
[1:32:36] right
[1:32:37] because you know what there's there's
[1:32:40] parts of me
[1:32:42] that that that
[1:32:43] will not go anywhere
[1:32:46] i watch everything y'all probably watch
[1:32:47] me but i watch y'all too
[1:32:50] i watch people i watch people as they
[1:32:53] come and go
[1:32:54] i watch people as they hit and miss
[1:32:57] right
[1:33:00] well praise the lord
[1:33:02] come on lights
[1:33:07] and then you know i wonder what's wrong
[1:33:09] so what well what's wrong

[1:33:14] in that back over there and i'm in my
[1:33:16] business
[1:33:17] my mind i've been there
[1:33:19] i don't bother nobody

[1:33:43] trained

[1:34:07] trained over what 20 years

[1:34:11] of trial and error trained
[1:34:15] as the watchman in the tower to watch
[1:34:18] over your souls

[1:34:23] get in the local weed

[1:34:42] like
[1:34:44] wheels ain't turning he may not even say
[1:34:46] nothing you ever
[1:34:49] but he's talking to god about it
[1:34:52] and god dropping down in his spirit
[1:34:55] this is what it is that is what it that
[1:34:57] is what it is is that right brother
[1:35:00] quaker no i'm talking about he passed to
[1:35:01] the church
[1:35:03] right
[1:35:04] amen
[1:35:06] if if god allows shepherd to be
[1:35:09] blind sight blindsided it's for a
[1:35:12] purpose
[1:35:13] sometimes he don't always reveal
[1:35:16] everything amen i'm trying to go
[1:35:18] somewhere i still
[1:35:19] this watch working so i still got a
[1:35:21] little time
[1:35:22] y'all bear with me
[1:35:24] praise the lord
[1:35:26] but he says we as we set forth this new
[1:35:30] year with a determination
[1:35:33] watch this not knowing what this year
[1:35:35] holds we don't
[1:35:37] we don't we don't know what this year
[1:35:39] hold but we're holding to him and that's
[1:35:42] the word
[1:35:43] amen amen
[1:35:46] all right see
[1:35:47] listen church let's let's let's think
[1:35:49] about something who would have thought
[1:35:51] we'd be sitting up in churches with
[1:35:52] masks on
[1:35:54] all that kind of stuff but here here's
[1:35:56] where we that's the harsh reality
[1:35:59] right and and just everything you know
[1:36:02] uh uh uh
[1:36:04] and i'm not against nothing but just
[1:36:05] hear me out right
[1:36:07] just hit me out for a second
[1:36:09] right
[1:36:11] we can't see sometimes it's a forcing
[1:36:14] but it's working for our good
[1:36:17] they force kind of indirectly force us
[1:36:20] all to take these shots and all that
[1:36:23] and then after a while
[1:36:25] and there's nothing wrong with it that's
[1:36:27] not what i'm saying
[1:36:28] then after a while they say you need a
[1:36:30] booster
[1:36:32] and then they then they almost want to
[1:36:34] tell you that that what you took ain't
[1:36:36] even no good just trying to get another
[1:36:37] kind of shot
[1:36:39] because because
[1:36:40] when when when
[1:36:42] one thing
[1:36:44] right and here's what we got to keep in
[1:36:45] mind the lid of hell
[1:36:49] has been loose
[1:36:53] here's the good thing though all of god
[1:36:55] come down too
[1:36:58] i'm going somewhere
[1:37:00] but but as soon as one thing calmed down
[1:37:03] they i lose something else we we dealt
[1:37:06] with covet covert coleman 19. and then
[1:37:10] then they they get watch this
[1:37:12] terminology means something
[1:37:15] variant
[1:37:18] right first it was coveted 19.
[1:37:21] when that started dying down and
[1:37:23] everybody started kind of trying to get
[1:37:25] back to normal then they got come out
[1:37:28] with a variant
[1:37:32] huh then then that start dying now now
[1:37:36] we got what's that omni
[1:37:42] yeah
[1:37:44] they be naming it they already got names
[1:37:46] for all of foolishness it's just devils
[1:37:49] that they unleash
[1:37:51] right
[1:37:52] and and see it's a part of the squeeze
[1:37:56] but we got a third pool
[1:38:00] huh see let me tell y'all something
[1:38:04] when when you think it's okay to get
[1:38:06] from under this eagle of anointing you
[1:38:08] have been deceived
[1:38:12] because this is the thing that's been
[1:38:14] ordained
[1:38:16] to carry you through
[1:38:19] the pressure
[1:38:22] this this eagle anointing has been on
[1:38:25] gain
[1:38:26] right
[1:38:27] it's the thing that carries me when i
[1:38:30] can't carry myself
[1:38:33] [Applause]
[1:38:35] huh
[1:38:36] glory to god

[2:10:14] amen brother brother willie did some
[2:10:17] serious serious preaching
[2:10:20] sometimes i don't think we understand
[2:10:23] i was a friend of a
[2:10:25] the right-hand man of a pastor for 18
[2:10:27] years so
[2:10:28] i got a chance to speak to him maybe
[2:10:30] three or four times a day
[2:10:32] and he would come to me with some of his
[2:10:34] burdens
[2:10:35] you know you look at brother troy
[2:10:37] brother quaker brother jerry brother
[2:10:39] willie brother jack and sometimes you
[2:10:41] don't realize what these ministers are
[2:10:42] going through
[2:10:44] they go through a little bit more than
[2:10:46] what we go through they're carrying the
[2:10:48] burdens of the people
[2:10:49] for a long time i wouldn't even talk to
[2:10:51] my pastor about what i was going through
[2:10:54] because i saw what he was going through
[2:10:56] made it hard for me to even confide
[2:10:58] with brother jack when i moved here
[2:11:00] but we should be praying for them all
[2:11:02] the time
[2:11:04] all the time
[2:11:06] you don't know how these brothers their
[2:11:08] hearts beat for you
[2:11:10] they live and die to feed you
[2:11:13] they give their all labor before the
[2:11:15] lord just to bring you a message to give
[2:11:18] you something to sustain you till the
[2:11:20] next time they can bring you something
[2:11:22] else to sustain you we need to pray for
[2:11:25] our brethren always
[2:11:27] always even as we pray for one another
[2:11:29] we're all going through something
[2:11:31] we're all going through something
[2:11:33] amen jesus put that that scripture there
[2:11:36] it's written smite the shepherd and she
[2:11:38] could be scattered
[2:11:40] why
[2:11:42] he's watching over your soul
[2:11:44] amen
[2:11:46] so we want to lift up our brothers in
[2:11:47] prayer as we prepare to leave this place
[2:11:49] let's power our hearts almighty god
[2:11:53] father our hearts
[2:11:54] bleed for our brothers lord
[2:11:57] not just these here but your servants
[2:11:59] all over father
[2:12:01] lord where all of our souls are hanging
[2:12:03] between heaven and hell lord god by the
[2:12:05] word of almighty god
[2:12:07] and if we don't have that word to live
[2:12:09] by lord there go we
[2:12:11] but lord because of the choice lord god
[2:12:14] that you you made concerning
[2:12:16] lord god our livelihood us as as your
[2:12:20] children father god lord when you were
[2:12:23] making
[2:12:24] brother jack lord
[2:12:26] in the womb father god you were thinking
[2:12:27] about us
[2:12:29] you knew what kind of pastor we needed
[2:12:31] lord god
[2:12:33] you knew the type of messages we would
[2:12:34] need and what we consider not every man
[2:12:37] woman boy and girl can sit under brother
[2:12:39] jack
[2:12:40] but because of our natures lord god you
[2:12:43] made us where we can sit under brother
[2:12:44] jack you made us where we can we can
[2:12:47] hear the words of brother willie brother
[2:12:48] quaker brother troy brother jerry right
[2:12:51] here in this little assembly father
[2:12:53] so father we pray that you keep a hedge
[2:12:55] about them father

[2:13:44] and do something lord that that rubs us
[2:13:47] the wrong way father may we not take
[2:13:49] office but take inventory of our lives
[2:13:51] and know lord jesus there's something in
[2:13:54] our life that you're trying to bring to
[2:13:56] our attention that we may lay down at
[2:13:57] your feet lord or you're going to have
