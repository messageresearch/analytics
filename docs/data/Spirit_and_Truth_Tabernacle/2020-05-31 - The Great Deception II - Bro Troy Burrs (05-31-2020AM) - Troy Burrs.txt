Birnam praise the Lord so just want to continue like I mentioned to you all I know that the competent country is just opening opening up and you know which we appreciate but we wanted to just take things a little slow here and and and I think that everybody's doing what we you know what we were just wanting to do the one thing that the one good thing that has not happening there has not been any outbreaks here and the one thing that I'm appreciate a lot of times you look back in hindsight instant man we could've did this who could've did that but you know if we had done that and there was an outbreak then you know it'd be a different story but we've been able to just kind of work everybody back in and now we got our saints a man that we're at risk not in coming back into the house of the Lord and and I'm grateful for that and [Music] raise the Lord so that's just if we all will just continue to do what we have been doing eventually we would get to the point where we'll be back to as normal as possible but but the main thing is that nobody is is nobody's impacted in any way a man that's that's our main thing I have a responsibility for each and every soul here at Spirit of Truth Tabernacle and I take my responsibility seriously so I just want to make sure everybody comes back everybody comes back safely everybody as well and that you know nobody's impacted by any decisions that we've made so if you all just continue to just do what you have been doing we'd appreciate it so virtual service on Wednesday night the only ones that are allowed to come amen to the service are those that are over 60 amendment everybody else we access to just continue to watch that virtually all so no Friday night services until further notice and then Sunday we'll continue to do this 9:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. service so keep that in mind we want you to encourage you please download the church app if you have it just make sure you go to your App Store and find the church app and then look for spirit and truth tabernacle and you'll be able to get under new APIs we'll be moving to that platform as far as giving a man we continue to allow those that are watching us online a man you can give online you have two ways to do that that's through PayPal or through cash app the information is there on the screen that you can use to be able to give a man if you desire to those that are inside the sanctuary we have a box on the table that you would just put your offering in and you know as you're coming in and going out we just accept to do it that way and that's very scriptural if you remember the Lord Jesus he told us about the woman that gave to my street dropped in MA box right she dropped it in a box and most of my success she gave more because she gave all they men she gave more than anybody else so we're just going right back to scripture days hey man so we would thank God for that so let's just pray amen over our time of offering amen and and we would go further father we just thank you for the opportunity we have to be able to give today thank you for providing and meeting our needs Lord you have proven over and over again that you are with us even in the midst of all of this you have proven it so god I'm just so grateful I am truly appreciative appreciative of your love Lord your your faithfulness God nothing catches you by surprise our Lord so even when this pandemic was striking you the Lord you weren't trying to figure out how we were gonna make it through you knew God that you already had the way made all we had to do is walk and believe by faith and just keep trusting you God and certainly have brought us through to the other side and God as we just give Lord as you have given to us use it for the furthers of your kingdom and may you continue to meet the needs of you people Jesus name we pray and a man amen praise the Lord this morning brother Troy is going to come and bring Amen the message for this morning and as I've said before I'll say again you know before the pandemic even struck God had already orchestrated that we would have helped in the church to navigate through this I mean and I'm just one that's appreciative I mean that brother Jerry and last week we appreciate for the charity lesson two hearts and brother quake who has a man that helped us a man tremendously throughout this time brother Frank and I brother Troy as well as helped Amanda's and and and just through this time where I'm just grateful for all the help that God has given and typically my only preached both services Awards during the whole pandemic when that was Easter but since that I've been able just kind of shared a responsibility with some of the other the help that God has sent and I'm grateful so typically the way I do it if somebody preaches the morning then I'll preach the afternoon and I just always kind of mix it up like that right so I know that probably you all have income y'all you heard me preach yet I'm sorry actually next Sunday I will be preaching in the morning so just if the Lord tarry and Amen I'm still here the plan is I preach next Sunday morning amen but uh but we just thank God again for for all all that he's doing for us and and we're just under expectation for a menthol everything else that he has for us and and let's just stand to our feet and we're gonna sing this song it is no secret what God will do what is done for others he'll do for you a man I wanted to also dis encourage you you know we all have we've added just a temperature check and if you know if you come and you got a temperature I don't want you to start fearing you're in the right place if you got a temperature we gotta lay hands on ya I believe Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and there was a time in scripture where Jesus went to the house of PETA and Peters mother-in-law had a fever Jesus prayed for Peters mother-in-law and the Bible says in the self-same hour the fever was broken and she was back up doing what she need to do I believe that same Jesus some our lives today so if you come and got a fever though don't you get worried amen we lay hands and we pray for the man I don't want you to get worried or anything like that this is again just a way to make sure everybody is safe a man as we come into the house of God but these are things that these things are temporary so just bear with us say manners we make it through this season it's just a season seasons change it's no secret what God can do what he's done for others he'll do for you you believe that this morning praise the Lord let's just with our hands lifted eyes throat sing this song and welcome brother Troy amen to the pulpit this morning to bring us to word of the Lord [Music] hallelujah with open arms [Music] pardon him [Music] what God can do [Music] taking Jesus it is no secret no see what God can do what can [Music] what he's done for others he's done [Music] Spa he is most

[Music] impossible [Music] Hey [Music] let's give the Lord praise God specialized amen and times just like this Amen when everything seems like no what a turn no hope God specializes in times just like [Music] goes to the word this morning feel the green from Romans the twelfth chapter hey man hallelujah love the Lord specializes over to go songs just in spirit amen and uh Romans 12 chapter beginning at the first and the second verse will also be reading from Jeremiah the eighth chapter beginning at the fourth verse so you can just kind of tag that if you can now romans twelfth chapter the first verse i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy and acceptable to God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is the good and perfect good acceptable perfect will of God a man Jeremiah eighth chapter two fourth verse hey man it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning hey man thank you Lord Jesus amen reading from for starting at the fourth verse amen the trees on this wise moreover thou shalt say unto them thus saith the Lord shall they fall and not arise shall he turn away and not return why then is this people of Jerusalem sledding back by a perpetual backsliding they hold fast deceit and refuse to return I hearkened and her but they spake not all right no man repented him of his weakness wickedness saying what have I done everyone turned to his course amen my title this message is going to be a the great deception I guess part 2 part 2 a man you may be seated Amen the presence of the Lord just want to take our draw our attention to this passage of Scripture here he says when then is the people of Jerusalem sleeping back by a perpetual backsliding they hold fast to deceit and refuse to return now you have to understand the scripture is written the scripture is written amen here and in this day to us Gentiles and his gentleness Gentile dispensation for individuals and may apply to individual so this scripture can can be applied to an individual that has a walk with God amen and fell from from from from his ways we all know what backsliding me leaving Mateusz you was once in a certain place we going right God it all made you and by revelation understanding and submission and yielding you you you found yourself in a certain level with God you found yourself in a certain place with God you you you went you were like Israel you went through the wilderness amen and doing that time a wilderness you begin to lose faith you begin to begin to a man to where you came from maybe you you you you you you you thought about oh it was so bad the e-trade a man it was so bad at least we had some good garlic but God promised you a land flowing with milk and running don't settle for the garlic it's good and acceptable we are looking there for perfect wheel not just as good unacceptable we moon is perfect with a man so we see here a men that dog Jerusalem and went through this and a perpetual backsliding God told them to do this took generations he dinner with Israel as a group as a people he deal with us in this dispensation as Gentiles as individuals he deals with us also as a church through seven Church ages he deals with the nation as a group this nation started out a man seeking religious freedom it was that's why this is so blessed because it was found you know godly principle and refused to return refused to return pretty funny thank you Lord Jesus so let's look at something here my in the beginning god created the world by his word amen stay with me and may I build a platform he created the world he created it by his earth he sent his word so all seeds they had placed upon the earth he formed all seeds by his own word now the old saying which came first the chicken uh torini which came first was the Word of God the word amen produced that earth was void without food in the middle of nothingness and by the word of God amen everything he came into fruition the earth fold amen he created he separated the water the the sea from the land the light from the darkness oh the spoken word amen stay with me it was void and without form there was nothing to make the seed out of but his word everything that you see from botany life to the agriculture through the to the animal life the human life Oh pain from the spoken word of God a man so it was before was I didn't say this void and without fall so after he created the seed and placed it on the earth he created in order for seeds to grow it has to be planted into something so he created the soil to plant the seed amen forward to grow in stay with me amen so the Bible says in John the first the fourth chapter that God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth amen so the first man that he created was made in the image of God he was a spirit he was void without form a man he was a spirit he didn't have hands he didn't have a body he was made in the image of God a man he wasn't at this time there was no flesh to till the soil Oh God had a spoken word created a man first this spirit man hey man then he put in him a Roma flesh a man that he may have contact with this other creation here on earth that he may be able to have contact with this earth the first man that he created as I said was a spirit man and he was made in the image and the likeness of God and then he come to find out that there was no man a man to till the soil then God created man out of the dust of the earth a man that was a different man then he breathed into him the breath of life and he became a living soul he became a living he didn't breathe in the donkey the lion in the horse he breathed into the man and he became a living soul he breathed the eternal God breathed into the nostrils of his son gave him something that he came none of the other creation my own life my own life the word the word is amore which means the wind the oxygen in the atmosphere this is what the animals breathe they didn't breathe the breath of God he breathed the life in amen he breathed the breath of life in man amen he breathed the spirit of life in the hip this is why fools don't know right from wrong now somebody may say yeah my raise dogs and you know my dogs even know one I'm not happy with him but he know you're not happy with it he know he beats up wrong because he know you not happy but you have something on the inside of the inside that even when you did something wrong ain't nobody got to tell you that this ain't right cuz there's something that's down maybe I shouldn't do this now you might ignore it and do it anyway that is the evidence that you are a sauna or daughter of God that's call conviction yes sir everybody don't have it everybody don't have it but in this morning you say yeah I got that didn't shake yourself there's something special about [Applause] you may not you may not be saying you may not go to church without something you say oh you know it then I'm saving you this morning check yourself because you are a son or daughter of God don't be like Jerusalem you came from God and you have back slid into a place amen but he has made a way for you to come back to don't turn it away that I'm speaking to you this morning that is not me that is God calling you back to perfection from his permissive to perfection amen they're all right now God in sixty-six thousand years we know the Bible says that a one day with the Lord's eyes of a thousand years a man so he panicked all these wonderful seeds and he spoke his word amen it shall be this way the tree shall be like this the mountain shall be like this the bird shall be like this a man the four-footed beast shall be like this is this what I'm gonna have spots this we're gonna have strife doesn't have long hair that's gonna have short hair a god of a right he made all of these things and each one in their perfect place the bird didn't say well I wanna I want a bar like the dog no he was happy flying above the clouds the dog was happy laying in the grass hey man the fish was happy in the water everybody was comfortable they was in God's will because God saw in his mind he was creating a masterpiece this is the way I see it I'll put this here put that there I want this like this and then planted a beautiful garden all the rules straight everybody was in their place it was so good he said I think I'll go rest and he took his final creation the one that he breathed into and say I put you in charge Oh Adam you in charged but he noticed Adam was lonely I knew what it was like to be lonely so he took a real and created him I helped me amen bone of his bone flesh of his flesh amen his beloved bride oh she's so beautiful for me yes Adam for you let's say that again for me yes Adam for you a man who can find a virtuous woman right there's nothing more beautiful a man right you know then a virtuous woman a man now everything was perfect they see macula garden all in God's perfect will from the salt from the heart of God amen the creation of his own mind his spoken word creation amen let me go on he said they should be this way it should be that way everything was perfect and it was good he commanded each one of those seeds that they would be they would transform themselves into a plant over which kind of life that the Word of God has spoken in them should be now remember when he first created out it was just a seed in the ground amen and then up they manifested began to manifest beautifully his thoughts of what was in his mind and because the Great Creator just sent forth his word and the word seed was there before the real seed was ever fool I must say that again the word seed was there laying there before the real seed was ever fool and the word a man of God formed now the Bible says in Hebrews the eleventh chapter that faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen now by the spoken word he Creed there but the seed just appeared as soon as he spoke it the world with force Amen and was the word was laying there before the seed ever was formed so what was in between the spoken word and the manifestation of the seed was faith has to be first the spoken word has to be first faith in the spoken word of God reduce the actual sea but the sea potential had been produced by the spoken word amen amen I'm not talking about that kind of faith where you say I believe I believe I believe talking about that kind of faith that job when he had a reel of Revelation he said I know my redeemer talking about that kind of faith with the woman with the issue of blood she said touch him of his be made whole [Applause] that time of faith now it may not come to pass right away all right it made the faith in the spoken word produces the potential to see Amen that's laying there and continue it will manifest predestination lies in the root and produces itself in the fruit that is the predestinated will of God in that little seed that's laying there the spoken word faith in the spoken word produced the evidence the seat a man that's land in the earth amen hadn't manifested yet amen but patience now listen here he said afraid through the evidence of the substance of things that is hopeful and the evidence of things that are not seen without faith brings hope why are the people so tossed about in this day don't know which way to turn let's get it a Cove a dive Lord Jesus people I can have no hope this spell is produced by a lack of hope they have nothing to hold on to but if you just hold on amen to the Word of God amen and hold on and apply it by faith in the Word of God it gives you a hope is the evidence of things not seen anybody but you get it first Corinthians 2:13 shot at 13 first it says now faith hope love about it D in the greater of these these three things are love amen love we know God is love but first they have to be faith in order for you amen to believe Amen that you are a saved there has to be a level of faith faith gives you a hope and man in that hope Amen sustain you until the literal life of God the literal heart of God begins to manifest itself in your life the Bible says in Jeremiah 31 and 17 there is a hope for your future alright there is a hope for your future declares the Lord and your children will return to their old territory Jeremiah the 31st chapter the sevens first up arena began for your future all right hey man I'm sorry I think I got the wrong verse dear sister amen amen declares the Lord and your children will return to their old territory alright amen amen so let's move on we see that he made the word out of out of the things that just not he made the world out of the things that does not yet appear and man he made the world by his word he spoke everything into existence and being God that of the Creator that speaketh all things into existence it must have been a perfect world a man the Bible says God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son and whosoever believes in Him should not perish a member however last world was he talking about because he said to this world it was transformed into a default I should say so we see amen God placed amen over this creation is rule of break creation on the Earth and Sun and the sun's bride Adam and Eve and God the father of Adam was the son of God according to the scripture he was the son of God and God made him a helped me out of his own body there is where the trouble Satan found her before Adam I must say that again Satan found her before Adam she belonged to Adam he made it for Adam amen I have this one question the Bible says in Genesis to be fruitful to multiply how did they know how to be fruitful and multiply I'm gonna just leave that right there and let you think on that to multiply how did they know what to do guarding teacher how did they know what to do I'm gonna just leave that right there to be fruitful and no multiply cuz you see what happened by listening a man to a preacher in that day right named serpent he was having church over there by the tree and he went to visit and a wrong seed was sown in the home and and there began the perpetual backs later but thank God for Adam being the son Oh God he knew Amen that if I have to throw my that's my bra you gave it a mean I'm not gonna just let him have it Amen that's what my daddy would do that's what my father would do so I'm going to cross over with her that if I cross over with you there's already a Redemption plan already in place you know they say on the news and different things they say you know the covet you shouldn't be going to church but all that singing because it pushes out all that stuff and you what they call it the micro daddy and when you sing and all that shouting holy rollers who tell you something we were shouting before the world was ever created jobs say where were you when the morning stars sang for Laurie and the sons of God shouted for joy we were shouting in the mind of God amen cause we know we go on back to God so don't tell me not the same don't tell me not to shop hey man don't tell me not to enjoy oh my god I've been doing this since there for everything this is why I'm sure a minute heavenly don't hear my notes amen God look down Amen old day that when the Ark of the Covenant was coming back baby just shout why hey because he knew Amen the Word of God is coming back baby got excited he begin the shower come on this bride up looking like the woman say you embarrassed me [Applause] supernatural [Applause] what did she do she just reported back to what's now always done you see in times of trouble and in times of victory [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] trouble [Applause] hey man amen now we see here now turn to Luke the eighth chapter the fifth verse let me slow down here now we see that is great creative power of God amen created a perfect garden all of the lines were straight everything was in its place it's perfect but see we we happen to know a man that he created man and put him in a certain place over everything and it's sort of a Superman he was a Superman a man they they must stay in order to maintain their he put them also under the care the same thing he put the trees that animals and so forth his were must never by no means be broken that's what made it perfect because everything was in its place according to what God had placed him listen to Wednesday nights we in Ephesians Eve had a position she had a place she was positionally placed as a housewife was her place that was her calling Oh didn't a housewife is that child's first preacher the housewife is the into to nurture the children to raise the children a keeper a keeper of the home that is powerful that is a powerful glorious position we find today that the reason we have such chaos and calamity amongst us because there was no mothers in the homes see what happens when you get God as a place and a purpose for everything the moon the Sun perfectly position to where there's just enough gravity to hold you on the earth but not pull the clouds down perfectly positioned and if it begins to get out of its place it's perfect place you have floods earthquakes all kind of calamity all of the elements got placed in nutrients he placed it in the earth I'm trying to move on but just be thank you coming he placed these things in the earth iron potassium potash these elements steel salinity he placed all of these chemicals and things in the earth in your body came from the earth but we listened through science and education the god of this age through science and education the god of this age one more time through science and education we got it the god of this age science and education we put science and education above God let me give you testimony you know and suddenly not that my wife was diagnosed with cancer HEPA long in her head went back headed biopsy came back positive thank you came back positive for some kind of council I forget beef on my one of them things we were getting ready to go on a little church trip and going back and forth to see the doctor and we were getting ready to go and end day we're never gonna give her radiation the doctor told us say what you're gonna have a ball spot in your head you're gonna lose some of your hair my wife said wait a minute whoa wait time out Dharma I'm gonna do what no that's not acceptable she said uh let's hold off on this she told her doctor we got a church meeting coming up and I'm gonna go to this meeting and she said I believe she told about that it's not I believe that when I come back you won't find nothing to radiate now now listen to the moral of this night because the Guardians dropped this in my spear there was another situation of Canada where just a lily rolls a young a little baby she had the same situation she had it was in her eye and it was gonna have to cut her hair and her mother say no you don't take a head on my baby this little girl you don't put a razor till my baby's hair Nazarite vow what triggered my wife will say no I'm not gonna lose my hair my hair is my glory and I believe without a shadow of a doubt see when you stand for God and stand for the word of God then he comes on the scene I believe the Bible says when Satan comes in like a flood the Spirit of God will raise up a standard against it no matter what the doctors the doctors say what this guide to happens hold on hold on wait a minute I hear what you saying but God says something else and my desire over the over the healing my desire is that my hair stay wood said we went on to the truth she went through the prayer lino was prayed for the next day we went to the airport came home the very next day that we came back was time for her to go to receive her first radiation treatment we got up that morning Contras my wife was coming I hear she's just like there and she said well what's going right now she's like look at my hand do you see it I don't see it let me look at you and we both we both stood it there like this it's come it took a minute we were dumbfounded we looked at each other I said this religious happened she said when did it happen she say I don't know I don't know we came back we got back kind of late I guess and we went to bed got up in I don't know when it happened but it happened because her desire was to be in his wheel [Music] my hair my hair is my glory we went to the doctor the doctor said what you take they thought that if I had a concussion to take they get rid of counts I put you out of business I push out of bed and he said he said well I do believe in miracles I say me too [Laughter] and right now today you can't even figure out where say Amen see that's what I'm talking about my brothers and sisters if we just stay an honor the will of God stay right there in his will you'll see the miraculous take place it's when we get out of the perfect will of God but see what happens is we got loose little creepers they call them creepers you plant the garden you water - you got everything now and all of a sudden this other stuff start coming up no no no no let's just get to this let's get to this amen Luke the eighth chapter v first ain't brainwash brother I'm sorry I get help pull him a coat that's hanging up here so would I be quick I'm gonna try to be quick amen a sword Luke chapter defence verse a sower went out to sow his seed and he has a seed sown and some fell by the wayside and it was trodden down and the fowls of the air devoured it and some fell upon the rock and as soon as it was at sprung up it was it away because it lacks moisture and some fell among the thorns and the thorn swinger and with it and choked it out and other fell on good ground and spring up and bear fruit a hundredfold and when he had said these things he cried he that has an ear let him hear he that has an ear to hear let him hear and his disciples asked him saying what might this parable be and he said unto you it is given to know the mystery unto you it is given to know the mystery behold i send you elijah the prophet unto you i give you to know the mysteries amen but two other parables that seem they might not see and hearing they might not understand because they said here in the end of the eighth verse remember says he that hath ears to hear let him hear everybody don't have that ear my sheep know my voice and a stranger did not follow Amen why because it's that something on the inside amen that was placed into you when you that gave you that something special from an eternal God that responds to the word you might not understand it you might not I don't understand me but laying there is that see the potential all you have to do is water it with faith say Lord I don't understand it all right now but I believe there's something something on the inside I don't understand it but something on yes I see me me my mouth a city man but something on the inside see a man yeah I don't understand it but through patience I'm almost hitting here by faith and give me a hope that the revelation will come amen amen let's go on he says here some fellow thorns had choked it out hello fell on the ground okay man eight we go to the night and the disciples say saying it to him if the parable is this beat and said unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God but to others are parables seeing they might not see in hearing they might not understand now the parable is this the seed is the word of God the seed is the word of God those that fail those by the wayside are they that hear then come the devil and take it away the word out of their hearts lest they should be leave and be saved they on the rock are they which when they hear they receive the word with joy and these have no root predestination lies in the root but they have no roof amen which Y which for a while believe and in a time of temptation they fall the way and that which fell among the thorns are they which when they have her go forth and choked out by the cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to perfection but that on good ground are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience you might not understand it you might not have a complete revelation of it but a man a man with a righteous heart that with a wheel to be in God's wheel it's my desire Lord to be in your perfect wheel so I'm gonna stay here and I'm going to apply with patience and wait for the revelation he will reveal it to you as we go along we're gonna get into that he will reveal it to you amen so we understand that now be going back before Amen when he created everything before the fall we didn't have these problems everything was perfect cuz there was no thorns thistles and none of those things it was a perfect ground but what happened if you go back and read in Genesis that after the fall a man that began to thorns and thistles other seeds of the doctrines of the beliefs they man that will choke out amen those that may be plenty there probably God saying this right here amen that out of the ground then we find these wild creepers in the field and what do they do there the corn was in a perfect roll like this and creeper the weeds I would call him would slowly grow amen and you you know have done Gardens before and you know it'll wrap itself ever so gently ever so lovingly ever so cunningly around a man the the stalk of the of the corn amen and they both feed on the same water they both grow in the same growl they both go to church they both read the Bible they both grow amen but one is of the original see amen and one is not so that creeper or that we will grow in this perfect garden and it began to wrap itself around and as it grow the we seems to grow it sort of pulls the corn in a different direction pull it in a different direction so what not a garden what was perfect everything was in its place The Rose was perfect everything was in order now it's a mess weeds have grown up in between and this one is hanging this way and this was hanging that way and this one can't seem to say a man because it's in bondage of this week and this one fell and this one the life is choking out of it because we a man is keeping it from getting the proper Sun and it's struggling to live struggling to live amen so the revelation is like binoculars it is it adjustment if you look through binoculars and you see and you make the adjustment you can look far off you can look way down the road because the over time things got so deformed she Satan he's not a creator he can't create anything but what he does he'll come and pervert what God has already created when I say it earlier the bird is happy being a bird the dog was just happy being a dog but now we got man I'm not quite happy with being a man all the time and the woman ain't happy being a woman that's cause the creeper is kind of pulling and perverting and pulling them and this is pulling them into some way that's not what God saw on his mind that's not the perfect will wasn't what he created it wasn't what he saw in his mind it is not his masterpiece it is a perversion God set up his perfect Eden now Satan is coming with a desire to be worshipped as God and has deformed this perfect garden and created his own Eden of hail amen but fear not little flaw but hold I send you a pair of binoculars in 2020 better give you beyond normal vision but it gives you abdominal vision supernatural provision amen that's perfect supernatural reason amen that you may be able to see a man afar that you may be able to see and recognize where we went wrong that you may be able to see and understand where the backsliding began the perpetual backsliding that you may return to the perfect will of God here are the binoculars the Word of God is leaning there a man is laying there but you need to look through the eyes let's go on here through the eyes of the seer in the Old Testament God used seers amen tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu to bring it's a highlight to bring it close to to enlarge the brain so that you can read between the lines so that you may know the mysteries amen because see the mysteries are hidden within the pages of the book because it's not for everybody only to his bride only to those who were with him before the foundation of the world only to those who yet breathed the breath of life his own the Bible is a love story it's a love story and we are with him we were with him before the foundation of the world so we know the secret thing he may say uh-uh-uh did something and you say I resonate with that you may not even understand why you resume waiting but something down on me because it's written to you until you I have to know the mysteries you can't wait for your neighbor you can't wait for your friend so what are you why would you think I don't see it that way but something on the inside of you just churn I just can't get away from it account of me since Wow because there's something special in you it may not be in your friend it may not be in your buddy you can't wait and see well I don't go if you go if God is calling you to the Lord I gotta go cuz there's something on the inside of me that says a man I don't understand it Lord I don't quite understand it but I'm a hole by faith and it's gonna give me a hope that the revelation will come the manifestation will come the seed that's leaning within you amen will manifest itself stay in the presence of the son stay in the presence of the word that seed that sin only inside Amen that says Amen that's thing that that compels you that when you know I just don't feel comfortable I don't know I can't do this there were times when I was in the world doing all kind of things I felt a checkup I know what of a few time maybe a lot of time I ignored it but even in the mist even in the midst of doing wrong it was still steals it couldn't shut it up try to drink it try to drown him in alcohol I would paint alcohol and be all under the period alcohol under the influence of all kinda stuff emotions all right I hope this resonating with somebody a man so we see that over time to deform on how much time I got help me yeah cuz I can't see the cloth will see the time will see over the time the the former has come and he just kind of perverts things amen but when God takes his position in the heart all reasoning fades away see we have a position a perfect position and God has a position a perfect position and his position is a heart is in the heart of a human being amen that's the manifestation is when when he is in his perfect position as in the heart of reasoning phase away and God becomes first that's where he wants to be now we see amen that in the beginning as I was going home man had perfect fellowship with God nothing was wrong no harm could come to no sickness could come to them they didn't even know sickness they didn't know of old age they didn't know what being hurt was all about they didn't know her they didn't know pain they couldn't be hurt they were in the presence of the own impotent powers of God which held them in control a man held them right in control guiding them by his spirit they ain't got him by his Spirit there was nothing they men could ever harm them if you could ever lay aside every thought and get down to the fact to know that the great Jehovah God that created you in the beginning he in his position placed today here in this tabernacle at the heart of every believer you will again be a Superman see the world is looking for a Superman the world need a Superman there was a ya know they created this heat the superhero the Superman everybody is looking for a Superman God had a Superman has a Superman it's the yielded vessel a yielded heart to him becomes a super man or a super woman on this earth why because you are in the will of God the Bible says Ezekiel the 3rd chapter the 17 verse son of man I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel therefore hear the words at my mouth and give them warning from me when I say unto the wicked thou shalt surely die and thou give us him not warning nor speak is to warn the wicked from his wicked way to save his life the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity but the blood will be required to that hand do I need to read that again I have to tell you the truth the pastor have to tell you the truth amen he's a watchman if we don't tell you the truth then the blood is required to on our hand God has commissioned us to tell you the truth we're not gonna water down the gospel to for the sake of feelings we can't the time is too late you have to know the truth and only the truth will set you free amen it'll be required to our hands I would love to go on but I feel my time is really getting away from me so in closing as our musicians come I read this quote in closing amen when our eyes were open I knew him God is all wastes in binoculars man like Moses man like Noah man like Jeremiah Ezekiel to have the ability to look a little deeper they have the ability God liken us to Eagles let me just use this as an example we're living in an age we see on yesterday that astronauts went into space the higher you go the more understanding the further you can see the astronaut gave a testimony he says that when you're up in space and you're looking back on this earth he says all of the problems seem so minuscule when you just look at the big picture when you can look through the eyes of the binoculars and see the big picture all of the problems of the world they can begin they've become miniscule I don't care what they going I'm time to be I believe that long protesting and all this other stuff my eyes is on the prize the real prize a man I'm not worried about the Cova my eyes is on the prize hey man I won't let Satan use these things as a distraction a man to take my eyes off of my goal my heavenly home a man in the will and trusted in God all of these things that just putting us right where we need to be God promised that that there'll be a church without a spot or wrinkle he is doing the work all of these things Lord did he know what he doing just trust God it says that my business here tonight speaking about Ephesians now fusions is talking as you're placing your adoption your your job amen he says that is my business here tonight I don't come as a healer for I'm not I don't come as a medical doctor for I'm not I know things about the body I don't I've said I'm sorry I know nothing about the body the only thing that I know as a paragraph 14 a man the only thing that I know that there is a risen Jesus Christ and he is Lord of Lord the King of Kings and I know his divine promise has promised us that the things that he did when he was here on earth will be produced reproduced again now did he claim to be a healer no he never claimed to heal anyone he said it is not me that doeth the work it is my father that dwelleth in me he doeth the work that correct but he will in do he was in dude with a power from God that he saw visions and he told his disciples and all of them who question to him that he didn't do nothing until the Father God showed him a vision on what to do and he did just what the father showed him to do how many knows how many Bible readers know that that's true and that's the Bible amen he says raise your hands he said st. John 5 in 19 jesus said after he passed through all those crippled people he said verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing in himself because he never healed a one of them He healed a man laying on a pallet had a disease 38 years he said the son of the son can do nothing in himself but what he sees the father doing that doeth the son likewise the father worketh and the son work is he door to evil - in other words the father showed him what to do see the revelation is in the adjustment of the binoculars the father showed him what to do and I just like the clothes and saying that we have had a set of binoculars come to us in this hour we might not see visions he said visions visions is a it's a gift from God amen and he has ordained one man in every dispensation amen to be the binoculars amen to look and to reveal the gospel a man for the day that we are living in that showed that the children that the people in Noah's day would have never known unless God has sent a pair of binoculars amen to make it that a flood was coming he is God and he changed night Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen I hope I'll just take that position to kind of drawing in amen I think I'd had I don't know I bet you I had about 40 pages yeah I think I got back to folk amen so we love the Lord love the Lord we love the Lord because there's something that he placed something down on the inside reminded when Joseph wanted to reveal himself to his brothers Joseph tight Christ mm-hm he placed the cup inside the bag of Benjamin and he told him to go let him go and he said go get go and search they bags they could only go so far because in their possession in their possession they had something that they had to come back Wow it was placed there by Joseph to enforce them to have to come back so he can reveal himself to them God placed something on the inside of you that a compel you to come back so that God could reveal himself to you made a lot of a blessing [Applause] don't get hard the word is went forth this morning now Lord it's in your hands it's been planted or farther into the hearts of those that would receive it I pray father right now that you began to water that word amen in the hearts of those that would receive it we come against all doubt we come against a spirit of unbelief we come against anything that what tried to come and take away the word that which was planted Lord out of their hearts of your people Lord do the increase Lord God Lord give them the courage to stand in this hour father stand for what they know is right Lord God Lord God you just reveal yourself Oh father God in these last and evil days Lord is going home time we see that the world is crumbling all around us kingdoms are falling Lord the people have no hope but we have a hope this morning that is in Christ Jesus that died at Calvary that redeemed us and brought us back Lord cotton to his perfect wheel they say behold we look in a glass darkly Lord God where we look Lord hardened and see you face to face Oh father God no longer father God looking through a dark glass of deception and obscurity but we shall behold you face to face and see you as you are Lord God just revealed to us and I'm heart so father God those that may be online Oh father God I prayed Lord God that you compelled them to just reach out fall to their knees Lord God and just surrender their own God is looking for people that just want to be engulfs and your perfect will line yourself up with the will of God and you will become a superhuman a God called human back into your original position as a son or daughter of God reminded of the prodigal son who left and squandered away his inheritance but he was still a son and when he came home Lord you received him with open arms and right back into his position you who may be wayward may have been deformed may have been pulled aside God your father is waiting for you to come home answer the call we can't wait for your sister you can't wait for your brother you can't wait for your friend it is an individual call that God has placed in you amen our Lord we thank you Lord God in Jesus precious name we pray amen god bless you sir [Applause] [Music] [Music] we thank the Lord for the word of the Lord on today just finishing up that felt on the great deception and so much was there but something that was said I love this scripture if we can just get Jeremiah 31 17 again that was a nugget and that was given to us and many many things that were given but this scripture I thought was really good Meister you know what I'm taking that one and I'm putting that in my prayer journal but Jeremiah 31 and 17 says and there is hope in dying and save the Lord that our children shall come again to their own border now you know sometimes you look at situations and if you're not careful the devil will make you give up on your promise but you get something like this and lay oh no no no there's hope and I'm an so don't look at what you're going through right now just look to the end there's hoping that in say it's the Lord's that the children shall come again to their own border just love and just the way that you know brother Tori to connect it to Joseph and and then reveal himself to his brothers and you know them having something Amen that what caused them to have to come back and God place something in inside of your loved ones that would cause them to have to come back a man hallelujah he's gonna heal you of your backsliding that's one of his promises and I tell you I'm just I'm just I'm just I'm just moved so those of you to have your prayer journals I tell you if you believe in God for a loved one stick that verse amen on that page and your prayer journal and just keep praying that verse over the top of them and watch what God does amen there's hope in the end there's hopefully and I believe that I believe that with all my heart amen let's have a word of Prayer we'll prepare to close out the service amen this morning we will dismiss Amen the congregation and a man have to prepare for the next service at 12 o'clock let's pray father we thank you for your word that has been brought to our hearts on this day thank you for for the Troy just got laboring a man and love to bring this phone to each and every one and I pray God that each would receive as that was spoken to us from heaven today Lord may strength be given and love there's one that was just made me stumbling in the journey God as he told us there was something on the inside of us that breath that was breathing was the breadth of Almighty God the life of God Father was stone the answer even when we were not living right and even if we are not living right that life is still there god it brings conviction when we're doing things wrong and Lorna's he read in the scripture amen the children Israel didn't want to return from where they were but oh god there's hoping the end there it's open the end no it doesn't matter if somebody doesn't want to return if they have something god that belongs to you then they got to come back because all that the father has given me will come God you won't lose one that's what you promised in your world so father I pray a man that hearts would remain receptive and God that people would turn to you even now God let him surrender father as the word has been given to him let him be healed from the perpetual backsliding and turn and follow your work God is our prayer keep us until we're able to meet again as we prepare to leave this place but not your presence thank you for the Saints being able to come back into the house thank you for sister Mary being able to come back guard just accept you it just continue to watch over your people father give him strength Oh God in this season and it's time we love Him we praise you we thank you so in Jesus name we pray amen and amen let's give another hand of praise [Applause] just remain seated the brothers will dismiss you a man in orderly fashion and those that are join or salaam would say god bless you we thank you for joining us amen on today and and we'd love to have you join us again at 12 o'clock for our next service god bless you until then [Music] [Music] you
