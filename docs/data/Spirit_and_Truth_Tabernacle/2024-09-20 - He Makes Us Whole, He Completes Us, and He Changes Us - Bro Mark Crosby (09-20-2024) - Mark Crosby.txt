control Lord take preeminence of your service take preeminence uh of all Spirits Lord we ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen amen let turn our Bibles to Luke chapter 9 read a couple verses out of there and then I'll have you be seated so we'll start with verse um Luke 29: 23- 26 amen say Amen when you get there start my timer I forget amen and he said to them all if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me for whosoever will save his his life shall lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same shall save it for what is a a man Advantage if he gain the whole world and lose himself or be a cast away for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words of him shall the son of man be ashamed when he shall come in his own glory and his father's glory and the own Holy Angels you may be seated may the Lord add the blessings to his word and then we'll jump to Mark 8: 34-38 so mark 8: 34-38 so the Bible says in verse 34 and when he called the people unto him with his disciples also he said unto them whosoever will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospels the same shall save it for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul Soul or what should a man give in exchange for his soul whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous generation sinful generation uh the son of man shall be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of the father of His Holy Angels so the title of this little sermon is he makes us whole He completes us and he changes us amen and so it's going to be a little different approach tonight um but just looking at my life as a young person just seeing the things that you guys are combating that I never that we never had to combat when I was growing up so especially as a young person today um we could try to do a lot of things we can strive for popularity we can be the most uh popular person in our school and our friend group um we can look to fancy things we can dress along with the Fashions of the world um we could even have the idea of how we want our life to be based upon the pattern of uh somebody famous um so we see all these things nowadays these get-rich quick schemes you got all these YouTubers and all these ticktockers and and they're making it look like it's so easy but what they're doing is they're influencing these young people to do the wrong thing they're they're showing this this image that is a false image of who they really are and it's causing so many people to try to make it big you got all these Instagram models and and you name it and our kids are trying to go after these things they're trying to pattern pattern after these things and what they're pattern after is a false life and and so it doesn't matter that you have the check mark or not it doesn't matter how much money you make but the thing is is it worth exchanging your soul all right because so many people that're exchanging their soul for these things and the end of the line they're going to regret what they did so just just talking to the young people today I remember uh I had a dream once um when I was uh in my early 20s I want to be the mo motivational speaker I Used to Love Les Brown you might know some of them and and Eric Thomas and I even uh went to a couple Eric Thomas' um convention he used to do free conventions in Michigan State and I had a desire and aspiration to be a motivational speaker and I used to make videos and everything and then I got to a point where I was like I don't think I'm going to make this because I wasn't will I wasn't willing to to put forth the effort the effort to do that but but I look back and see if I would have pursued that what would have really mattered oh because I would have been doing it for the money and for the popularity and so I thank God that he put a stop to that um because I could have went down a WR path and so just telling you guys that it's the same influence as that influence is today with the the ticktockers and the YouTubers and the same thing so let's keep it going so um let's go to Mark 10: 17 or Mark chap 10: 17 or chapter 17 I'm sorry and we'll read verses 17- 22 so I look I love this story of the Rich Young Ruler in Mark chapter 10 because it really uh typifies us as young people because this man had the same uh opportunity you have tonight which is eternal life laid before you and we're going to see what decision this young man made in chapter 17 so and when he was gone forth into the way there came one running and kneeled to him and ask him good Master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life so this young man knew that he was lacking something he knew that something was missing in his life he he went to church he probably prayed he probably gave his arms offerings tithes Etc but something was missing deep down inside he he didn't feel whole he didn't feel complete he knew something had to change him so that's why he came to Jesus running glory and so we see this and Jesus said unto him why callest thou me good there is none good but one that is God thou knowest the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honor thy father and thy mother and he answered and said unto him master all these have I observed from my youth up so this wasn't some uh ill-fame person but this is a man who who who who feared God because he respected the Commandments and so we see in um verse 21 then Jesus beholding him loved him so Jesus loved this man and he said unto him one thing thou lackest it wasn't many things but it was one thing that stopped him from inheriting eternal life and so I say to you guys tonight don't let one thing get in the way of you inheriting eternal life cuz this man after he made his decision he thought that he was all good to go but the end of his line he woke up uh and and he woke up in torment and he realized that his decision wasn't the best decision he's made and he he asked Abraham can you send one can you send one up from the dead Lazarus he said if they wouldn't believe one from the dead if they don't believe the prophet so just saying this that we got to make a decision tonight right sir because this could be your last chance to make a decision amen and living for God is the best thing you can do as a young person I wish when I was your age that I I was serious with God and live for him I could avoid a lot of scars that I have in my life a lot of things I got into because I decided to turn away from God but you guys have such a beautiful support system here see I didn't grow up in a home we went to the message church but the it wasn't the church what we learned in church wasn't brought into the home so we could do what we want at home play any kind of games watch any kind of TV and uh I had such a bad influence that we went to church but it it wasn't that wasn't enough amen because your parents are your biggest influence what what you see them doing is going to be what you're going to do as you grow up and so I I my parents did the best they could I thank God for my parents but but I looking back there's a lot of things my brother and I that we we saw that I wish we could unsee that we saw my mom and our dad doing but but but but going forward with that is I'm thankful that I went through these things because I can share these things with you guys that I went through these experiences that you don't have to go through the same thing that I went through amen let's finish this little story uh then Jesus beholding him loved him and said to him one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou Hast and give to the poor and thou shall have treasure in heaven come up and take the cross and follow me and he was sad at this saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions so just say we may not have riches tonight but there's something in our life we could be holding on to just as this young man was holding to his riches so saying here tonight is don't let anything get in the way of your walk with God I I can tell you that don't let anything because this man wish he could go back and change his decision because the decision is so vital one decision can impact your whole entire adulthood so you got to be careful the decisions that you make um because one decision canot only impact you but your parents your church family sir and so that's why we really careful decisions that you make um I thank God I look back in my life there's some decisions that I made that should destroyed my life but thankful the hand of God was there to protect me amen and so let's go read into a quote now and this Rich Young Ruler um as we call it in the Bible he passed up a great opportunity he had the opportunity to put his riches of this world into a guaranteed plan but he failed to do it this is investment uh message investment so I look at this we may not be investing money right now but we're investing our life so what are you investing your life into right now are you investing your life into Tik Tok YouTube are you investing your life trying to make a name for yourself popularity are you trying to impress somebody cuz we're not here to try to impress somebody only person we want to please is God himself because if you're a people pleaser you can never truly please a person because the person is going to keep wanting more from you more and more and more so make sure that you're not trying to please somebody by your image or or trying to act cool or or trying to sound like something you're not this be who God made you to be God made everybody specific way so you're fearfully and wonderfully made as the Bible says so but he failed he didn't do it he was given opportunity that he could draw interest on it make a great investment but he failed to accept that opportunity so much as many of us do today we find out that it's too bad but we do it now although this plan he was offered was perfectly Vindicated it was sound when Jesus came to the Earth he proved that he was what he said he was he was God manifested In the Flesh he brought it a showdown and said if I do not the works of my father then Believe Me Not So this young man was like the great Rich leoan age that we live in they see a great opportunity to invest in something but it's not popular Jesus was not a popular man in his days only amongst the poor and illiterate the church of his day the denomination of his day or the secondaryan religions had nothing to do with him but there must have been something about him that this Rich Young Ruler seen in Jesus then he did not see in others he didn't not have the common good sense to come and ask what he might do because he had seen in Jesus there was a quality that he didn't see in anyone else notice that but you see he was very rich with the things of this world we have a lovely picture of this in later see in age in Revelations 3 because you say you are rich and have need of nothing and yet knowest thou not that thou wretched poor miserable blind and naked so just going back we're going to go to Ecclesiastes 12: um 13 through 14 so I look back and just seeing how you guys have such a beautiful uh role models in your life parents a wonderful Pastor brothers and sisters so all all these things that you have and it's also brought into your homes I wish I would have had that when I was growing up I believe it would have it would have helped me a lot from not making some decisions I made in my life that they're still affecting me today so I just tell you that's how how serious a decision is decisions I made in my youth that are still affecting me today because I made that bad decision I didn't know better but now since I know better I can say to you guys like brother Smiley said don't do the things that I did and we we'll get later into that I'll explain some of my my story of the things I did so let's go to Ecclesiastes chapter 12 and we'll read verse one oh my I'll read it from here so remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth so right now this the days of your youth right now while the evil days come not so you're not tarnished like I was I got in the things I wish I did I didn't see so while the evil days come not nor the years draw nigh when thou shalt say I have no pleasure and so right now you have no pleasure in so I'm telling you right now is remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth right now don't wait until your 25 and 30 when when everything is just is falling apart let's go to verse um let's go to verse uh 13- 14 please oh my so let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter it's simple we got to keep it simple when serving God fear God keep his Commandments for this is the whole duty of man just keep it simple don't make it harder than it has to be for God shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil so don't try to hide things from your parents God has a way of bringing those things you're trying to hide every time I remember um uh a precious friend of mine brother John I remember uh his wife uh sister Cheryl was at home one day and the Lord spoke to her that her son was hiding weed in a in a a pot somewhere around the house and she looked in there and found it so just like something like that she never knew that he never told her but God told sister chery personally so you can't hide anything from God God is going to bring it up to the surface you might as well just be truthful because I remember um you remember the story brother BR was talking about this young man um his mom asked if he smoked cigarettes and he said no and he put coffee on his breath and he said that one lie destroyed his whole life he became a habitual that means he kept lying and lying and lying off one little lie so the same thing with that is don't try to cover things up just be truthful cuz it's only going to hurt you in the end all right brother let's go praise God so now I'm speaking from experience I wish I would have given my heart to the Lord at the early age I wish I would because I would avoided a lot of things in my life that I I have to deal with now because the what the devil likes to do is he likes to bring up your past likes to beat you in the head with it so I'm telling you guys is don't make don't make a past that that the devil can use as ammunition against you because God will forgive you he will but the devil won't he's going to bring it he's going to bring it up over and time and time again so I'm saying now is don't make a pass like I made a past amen so so my advice to you is don't test the waters don't go out and test what the world can offer you cuz the world ain't got nothing but death and destruction the world will spit you out don't go trying after uh fellas after girl after girl no don't do that girls don't don't try after guy after guy don't do that it it's not worth it that's right keep yourself amen keep yourself until it it's time to be married cuz it's not worth it glory glory god amen so just so now just just remembering out there life it's death out there just remember there always death out there the devil can paint some beautiful picture to you but ain't nothing but death it ain't nothing it's like an apple that looks good but when you bite it it's rotten to the core just like that amen so let's go to Hebrews 11 and we'll read uh verses 23- 27 So it's talking about another young man who had the same choice that this Rich Young Ruler had Moses had the opportunity he he even tasted some of those riches being in in in Pharaoh's Kingdom he was next in line of pharaoh could have had any woman that he wanted but he chose not to choose those things he he had he had opportunity placing his hands like the Rich Young Ruler to take life or death and Moses chose Life by faith Moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child they were not afraid of the king's commandment by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of god notice this statement right here than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season sin does feel good to the flesh but it only lasts for a season and you'll regret all the pleasure that you had cuz I I I've been there before it doesn't feel good it may feel good in the moment but after you do it it does not feel good you feel disgusted you feel disgraced and so I'm telling you is don't try to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season it's not worth it amen the devil the devil will call you and then once you get into it he'll Point his finger at you laugh at you that's how that's how the enemy Works yes sir so choosing rather suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the approach of Christ's greater riches than the treasures of Egypt so he didn't care about being the the next YouTube Star we could say he didn't care about being the next tick tocker he didn't care about those things but what he care about is his call that he felt inside his heart of God and there is a calling your heart right now to God and you can either choose to quench it or you can choose to to build it so by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endured and seeing who is invisible so tonight is don't try to impress your parents by putting on some front of you walking with God you got to have a personal experience for yourself you can only fool somebody for so long your parents can tell if you really have a walk with God you can't fool them I'm sorry you just can't fool them so I suggest this see God for yourself come come and taste what God really is see what what benefits he has give your life to him see how he directs you and leads you yes and go to Psalms 1199 now I'll share a little bit of my testimony so the Bible says in verse 9 where wether shall young man cleanse his way by taking heed there into according to Thy word so start at young age getting just falling in love with the word cuz when you fall in love with the word you fall in love with God they're one and the same and so I just remember growing up um we I started going to a message church when I was about 9 years old I'll never forget um my uncle found this church when he was living in South Carolina and he found a church for us and um we would go to church all the time we go to Wednesdays and Sundays we would go to youth youth service or or like youth um like youth outings and stuff like that but it was never something that was really practicies in the home and like I said when we got home we could listen to any kind of music like rap bet you name it Snoop Dogg all that stuff we could my Dad loved Tupac so I love Tupac so all these influences I had in my home but one thing I do appreciate my dad for many things is he would always make us go to church on Sunday I never wanted to go to church on Sunday sometimes I just wanted just to stay home but he would always make us go to church and I'm thankful for that amen but anyway so during that time growing up um I listen to all kind of music from Under the Sun and um anyways I I remember um as I was growing up um I always see always see my stepmom always go to church even when I wasn't going to church and and so I I looked up to that and see my grandma go I always looked up to that seeing my mom and my grandma always going to church and one thing I really appreciate that the Saints at my old church would always pray for me like I told you a statement before um my Sunday school teacher would always set a timer in her phone to pray for my brother and I every single day and that that really touched my heart um because I believe that God was honoring those prayers you know and keeping me from certain things and um I remember back in the day one of my best friends Doug my best friend Doug we would um always go to his house on the weekends and uh we would drink underage drinking I would I was underage but um I would do things like that and it seemed fun and harmless at the time but I look back and I remember my brother was saying back in the day Mark youed should to drink like a pirate I was like really did I and this this statements like that I was just seeing myself get into and and my parents you know never discouraged it you know we would be at their house drinking sometimes they would never discouraged it just all fun in games and and so there certain things that I got into because I knew I believed in God I knew God was real but I didn't want to live the life because I thought the life was some like in the Box boring life and so so so the devil painted some picture to me that being a Christian isn't fun go test the waters you know go go you you believe in God you good and so I got in a lot of addictions and things like that in my life and I was looking just you know how the devil just got in my life and just told me all these lies because I thought being a Christian wasn't fun at all but being a Christian that's really living life to the fullest right there that's living life to the fullest because the devil will paint some pictures saying go out go out clubbing over here party over here womanizing over here that's fun no that's not fun that's just death that's right leading you one step closer to death and and so looking back I'll tell you this one Testament was my friend's house um his name was Steven and um he gave me a beer and I was drinking it and I I'll never forget this voice I went to take another Sip and this voice said don't drink anymore and mind you what that probably was in 2016 and was it going to be to another year I would start serving God and so so I just he I just heeded to the voice right and when I he to that voice I'll tell you this God works even when you don't realize he's working working in your life cuz when I heeded to that voice I lost all desire to drink when I say it just left it left just like that but mind you I still wasn't serving God then but God was doing a small little work and so I'm looking back to um so my my job at Costco back in Michigan we could listen to any kind of music we want to you name it but they said one thing you have to do is censor it if it has profanity and so I was like all right that's fine and so it was funny how God was working so I I agreed to it I was like whatever that's fine and so it was funny so when I started listening to censor music I didn't want to listen to cussing anymore so God was just like slowly just like working in my life on that it's slowly working in my life and so and so but I look back all these things that got into was was my fault it was my decision I couldn't blame anybody else because I made the decision to do it and so God was just working slowly and I'll never forget 2017 um I just felt like a a strange call cuz I remember I I would go to church and then I would leave and go to church and leave and I felt like a really strong calling in my heart that year just that I needed to get back in get back in church and get back on God and so around September um I was uh I had this addiction for many years and um and so I just was praying to God that month Lord I just can't do this anymore Lord this addiction is just tearing me up nobody knows about it but me and you but lord it's it's hurting me mentally physically and I I just can't do this anymore and I'll tell you this when when a person's addicted with something and you want God to really do something you got to show God that you really mean business because it's many times that you can you can say God I want Deliverance but you're still holding on to it and I told God I can't do this anymore I need your help I don't care what I got to do but I I need to be delivered from this so anyway so during that time that month um I started da I started um I started talking to this girl at the Costco at the time and we started connecting and come to find that she was a Christian a non-denominational Christian and I was like okay maybe let go somewhere and so I started dating her and everything and and um it it kind of didn't work out because we had different views you know what I'm saying because I was starting to get back into the word cuz even when I was in the world when I would take long trips I would still listen to the message of the hour you I was still cuz I knew it was I knew it was the truth like knew deep down inside that the message was the truth and so I'll I'll play the tape on and listen to it you know for a couple hours and but anyway so during that time I was dating this girl and um it was many red flags and I was like ah don't worry about the red flags we get into arguments and one thing I realized when I was dating her that we had same upbringings almost because um one thing I inherited from my dad I didn't realize till um God showed me because it would be brought out in certain situations that I would be very Petty sometimes argumentive and um it would come out only when I was put under pressure and so during that relationship God showed me that I had all these things inherited from my dad and my mom seeing what they did in the home and not even realizing that it was embedded inside of me because I I saw them do it all the time arguing uh yelling cussing you name I used to cuss like a sailor like at work all the time and so anyway so we were getting arguments all the time and finally we kind of like end up breaking it off and um I never forget it was a Saturday it was a Saturday that we went to this this church that she wanted to go to it's called like it's 242 like we walk into church I kid you not you look to the left it's a big soccer field then you see this nice little coffee bar over here and I'm like man like I'm I'm in recess so yeah you see this big old church and we we go in here and I never forget because another thing that was a red flag too is that she smoked weed and it was that was another red flag FL yeah all these red flags y was just show them I'm like n she the one no she the one you know brother and so so so after the sermon um after the sermon I forgot the sermon was even about it was like it it was crazy CU like at those churches they have like a certain program set up and they'll have the same thing again and anyway so it was about like some I can't remember what it was about so we were driving together in a car and she asked me this question she was like do you think I have the Holy Ghost and I told her no I I was like no so I told her straight up no because I was looking at you know certain things that it wasn't lined up with the word of God so anyway so we ended it mutually and everything so we we ended mutually to tell the truth truth so we ended it mutually so during that time um so one thing I was addicted to um during that one one time I was addicted to in 2017 before I started dating her I used to be really addicted to working out like when I say addicted to working out I literally would be at home I would take my shirt off do push-ups and look at the pump in the mirror that that's how bad it was I literally I was working out because I wanted to show off what I had to other other girls and the funny thing was my goal was to pull girls and I didn't pull one girl the Lord knows what he's doing stop did not pull out one girl not one but so but anyways I I remember this um during that time I started dating that girl and I I asked the Lord too to deliver me from this thing I was struggling with and um so anyways we ended up on a Saturday and then Sunday goes by and then Monday hits at that time I was working two jobs I work in a Costco in Target probably about 65 hours a week working like a mad man going to the gym 5 days a week I don't know how I did it working like 11 hours a day I was a crazy man anyway so it was a Monday and I was just leaving from Costco into my second job at Target I never forget I was just um I was literally in my car just sitting and kind of like reality just like hit like cuz you know you know how guys sometimes like to be like this little tough roll like you know that breakup didn't affect me and so I'm in my car and I just start crying I just start just literally start crying like a little baby and um and I was just like you know Lord I I just can't do this anymore Lord I just I was like Lord I don't care what I have to do I don't care what I have to give up Lord I want to serve you and I'll never forget I I gave my heart to that day I gave my heart in a in a car that day and I just told God like Lord just lead me and guide me and I remember I got out that car and and I tell you I was changed I felt complete I felt whole I felt changed Hallelujah and I'll never forget that ever in my life and when the devil tries to like uh you know how the devil does all these baggage I look back in that day and said Lord I know I met with you in that car I know I met with you in that car I have not been the same and so and so that that that that week was the week of Thanksgiving I never forget it'll be seven years this day seven years I never forget cuz my uncle was always recommending me to read the church age book and I was like all right I'll read it so I started Thanksgiving and what I did was um so when I was working I would wake up two hours before I had to go to work I'll hit my knees and pray I'll read the word in the in a church age book Faithfully every day and the Lord just started to reveal things to me his word started to become I used to read the word I like man I don't understand this all these these and THS and these and arts and Nows and so as I was start reading the word and asking God to reveal it he start just revealing himself to me man the church age book God just opened up door I was just like wow and so so anyway so we we broke up so the hardest thing was when we broke up was I worked in this depart the produce department and she worked in the deli department so I literally would see her every single day and that was like the hardest thing it it was just so hard every day I it' be a constant struggle and so the funny thing was that um I remember um so she she asked me if I wanted to um she's going to do Bible studies at her house and if I wanted to come in my mind I'm like no I don't want to go and so the funny thing was she did it on Wednesday nights but we had service Wednesday night so I was like I can't do it because I got service so I didn't have to tell her like I didn't want to do this but anyway so so anyway so that happened and um is the funny thing was this this this random thing happened like out of the blue so she actually ended up have having to move um out of the blue because her mom had to sell the house she was living in so literally she had to move all the way to Florida and it it it was funny it wasn't funny but it was I could see the Lord was just moved and separated us for a reason and um I was just looking back and seeing like thank you Lord because Lord knew I was just struggling like it was so hard every day and so anyway so that happened and that was 2017 that was like probably like uh November and then uh also I was getting knee surgery um come in January cuz I tore my ACL had like no meniscus it was a lot of stuff going on on my knee and so January 3rd went around and um I I remember that time from January to May that was a time that I really got a chance to really get a hold of God because I was like at home I couldn't really do nothing so what I did was I I put it in my heart that I'm going to se God with all my heart I'm going to bathe and soak in the message of the hour the word of God prayer CU all this free time I'm going to use this free time for God so every time the devil would attack me when I was going through that um I was asking God for deliverance I would just every time the devil would tempt me I'll just go in my head and just pray to God say Lord just give me the strength to overcome this every time God would be faithful every single time so during that time from January to may I I love that time because I can't tell you the exact day it happened but I remember one day it was maybe like in the springtime maybe early summer I just remember I just felt free and that that made God even more real for me because he delivered me from this addiction I had for over 12 years plus and so I it showed me how real God was cuz now I experienced him in a car I experienced him in Deliverance in healing of my need all these things I was experien in God but I had to seek Him for myself because I heard about him in church I heard him preach ACR the pulpit many times I heard many times uh the pastor saying God can deliver you through this God can do this but I never experienced for myself so it wasn't real to me amen but when I when I asked God to to give me this Deliverance Lord please he came in and gave it to me Hallelujah and ever since I never forget that day I I just felt changed it felt it felt like 1,000 lbs was lifted off of me and so I just see that moment I have from January to May that's what really established me and as young people why you don't have jobs you don't have this get established in God get established in God and so I just see I just see God just moving in my life but all these things I had to extra things I had to endure because I got into with the getting the wrong group of friends G getting the wrong I was dirty jokes galore I would all the time dirty jokes F Bombs all these things but but look where it got me it it got me in trouble and I thank God I never got in legal trouble or law trouble I thank God that he protected me from these things and so just saying these things is young people have a personal experience with God and don't stop there get filled with the Holy Ghost it's the greatest thing that you can ever do in your life because the world doesn't care the world will just destroy you and so don't let the world destroy you amen let's go to Proverbs 18:24 praise God so it says a man that ha friends must show himself friendly and there's a friend that Stith closer than a brother so Jesus Christ he he know let's go to Hebrew go Hebrews I love this Hebrews thing cuz as a young person you got to realize that there's somebody who understands you when you think your parents don't understand you Jesus Christ was tempted above all measure he been through he been through sexual Temptation he been through rich tempt all these things he's been through so he can relate to you don't think we don't have a God that can relate to us he literally was on this Earth and experienced all the things that you're experiencing so he can relate to you so let's go to Hebrews real quick it was not on my notes but one second so it's Hebrews 4 and we'll go to uh 4:14 seeing that we have a high a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities so he knows what you're going through right now maybe some of you guys tonight are on the line if you want to be a Christian or not maybe some of you guys say I don't know if I want this life I don't know if I can do this life I'll tell you this God knows how you're feeling just pour out to them because it's not worth missing this opportunity tonight maybe tonight be the last opportunity you have so don't miss the opportunity to give God your allwe for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but with an all points tempted like as we are yet without sin so it said look it says he says it says in all points so what you're going through right now he can relate to you he can give you guidance he can give you strength to overcome it right but you got to let him into your heart your parents can't do it for you you got to let him into your heart cuz know your parents will love for you to serve God but they can't force you into it cuz if some brother Braham say somebody can talk you into it they can talk you out of it so you got to have the like experience I had your parents had you got to have that same type of experience because when I met God in my car I I I was changed amen I wasn't going back to the world anymore I knew what was in the world cuz I I've been in the world so I can tell you guys I experienced it for you you don't need it you don't need it you don't need it you don't need it at all I I smoking weed uh alcohol I did it wasn't worth it amen trying to impress ladies wasn't worth it all these things wasn't worth it all it did was it it C more things that I had to overcome in my life don't add extra things that you got to overcome while you're young just stay young and undefiled keep it man wave that Banner High you got to you got to got to I wish I had what you guys had tonight I wish I had somebody that would care about me and put these events and do this and my parents care about my walk with with with God I I would love to go back and have that but you know what sometimes we got to go through things for other people so I'm thankful I went through this so I can tell you ain't nothing there ain't nothing there ain't nothing there amen gory amen and so I remember too as I was as I was growing in God I remember my best friend Doug we used to you know drink together video game together and as I was as I was getting closer with God I I started to realize that our relationship was kind of just going south a little bit and I realized that there's two different spirits that are operating he's going one I'm going the other way and so I been I haven't talked to him in a long time you know every time I like kind of bring up the Lord he be like you know kind of cringe a little bit but um anyways I I look back and and this you know many friends that I you know that in the world that I lost but I'm okay with that because when God calls us to a total separation I see Abraham he probably had lots of friends and uh where he lived at but God callus a total separation because he knows those friends if you keep them in your life they going to influence you the wrong way so I tell you this be careful the friends that you have because they can influence you the wrong way because they're operating by a spirit you're operating by a spirit so I don't care how nice they are if they are influencing you away from God you don't need that friend you you don't it's not worth it it's just not worth it let's go to verse uh let's go to Proverbs 29:19 where there is no vision the people perish so God has a plan for your life he has a predestinated plan for your life you could choose to follow it or not follow it and I'm so thankful that I followed his plan I didn't realiz realized that you know I had a had a desire to be a motivational speaker and and I was like I was just like why do I even try to pursue that I didn't want to be a preacher I'll be sure to honest with you I I I did not want to be a minister and and God has a funny way of doing things but it's his perfect plan amen I'll tell you a little testimony in that so um I didn't tell you this testimony before but I remember so the first time I met brother hos and brother Maris so at that time I told you I got kicked out of my house and um for for for serving God and believe the message of the hour and so I told I asked the Lord if you want me to go to the men's meeting Lord just make a way and I was so thankful that I I prayed that cuz I forgot I prayed that and God has a amazing way so brother Franco calls me and says hey Mark um I I can't go to men's meeting when go to my place I'm like no I'm good I'm like no I don't think so and I was like wait wa wait no I'll go brother Fran so and so God just opened the door and that and I thank brother Fran so I thank God for putting that in brother Fran heart to call me because I go there and I meet brother hos I meet brother I see brother Jack again cuz he came to my church and preached before I see brother Maris and little did I know that God just connects things little or know I'll be here and brother Jack be my pastor now so I look I look look back and never forget brother Paul preached this message what Sons do with authority I'll never forget that that changed me I was just like that still rings in my heart today I still remember I remember that and so I I get back um from the men's meeting just realizing just I see all these things I look back and I can see what God was doing just connecting me brother brother Maris and little did I know I would be here today preaching in spirit in the truth Tabernacle as a member I did see that and so I remember getting home and um brother John asked me to share some of the things that was spoken at men's meeting and so I was on my bed and I was like okay let me try to get these notes together and I remember I remember a voice saying I want you to preach and I'm like nah that's just me that's just me you know thinking things and then it kept getting stronger and stronger and stronger I was like okay Lord I know it's you and so I talked to Brother John I'm hat brother John um the Lord's calling me to minister he's like okay brother Mark well we got a couple meetings first and after we'll get you to we'll get you to minister I'm like huh I'm not ready he's like don't worry and then I I remember never forget I preached my first message it was um what's the most valuable currency which is time and so I just see God then just start opening doors because God didn't call me to minister until first I totally separated myself from my parents that's when God started to open doors and bless me because my blessings were being hindered because I was in a bad environment so just like when a tree is planted if it's not planted in a good environment it will not grow so God had to uproot me and put me in a place where I wasn't influenced by my my parents or my brother even though they were good good people and so I see after that moment God just started to just lead me and and and the same thing you guys you got to make sure you're putting yourself in the right environment and when I say that you got a good environment with your parents they're perfect but you got to make sure that you you you watching the right things cuz your parents can't watch every little thing you're doing so you now you got to be careful what you're watching because I know one click can destroy your life cuz it cuz it destroyed my life I can tell you one click destroyed my life and in many years it destroyed my life and so I I tell you this I'm just I'm telling you guys be careful what you watch on YouTube be careful what you post be careful who you're looking at be careful who you let influence you because what you let influence you is going to lead into your teenage years and into your adulthood amen so now I know a lot of times we're as young people were worried like what I'm going to do when going grow up what's my future going to be like what's this what's that what's that what's that and I'll tell you this the greatest thing you can do is ask Lord what do you want my future to be what do you want me to do what is your perfect plan for me and I love Jeremiah 29:11 says for I know the thoughts that I think towards you sayeth the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected in so the Lord know the Lord wants to bless you he wants to lead you he wants to guide you but you got to let him do these things and I love brother Jack mentioned this uh quote that brother brandom um mentioned about your future is clear so we'll read that in early spiritual experiences paragraph 56 so I was lying there one morning about 3:00 in the morning and I was thinking oh what would my future be what will my outcome be and while I was laying there I fell into a trance and here come one walking to me oh I looked at him he walked straight to me Stern he said as thou was thinking of me what your future will be he grabbed a piece of paper it was like folded them like a typewriter paper like that and he held it out like this and Stood Beside Me like that and he swirled that like that and went Plumb into the heavens and said your future is clear so I want to tell you young people if you let God in your life your future is clear so don't don't try to go make it a name for yourself let God lead and guide you because if you let him lead and guide you the prophet said your future is clear Jeremiah 9 Jeremiah 2911 says the same thing your future is clear he has plans to prosper you and give you an expected End Amen sir amen let's jump to Psalm 16 uh or Psalm 1611 thou will show me the path of life in thy presence is fullness of joy I'm me say it again in thy presence is fullness of joy see the world can bring happiness but what happiness is happiness is based upon circumstances but joy is not based upon circumstances you can have joy in a trial joy in a storm cuz when I when I kicked out my parents house I had Joy I did I was kind remember I remember when I kicked out the the first scripture the Lord brought to my mind was I didn't come to bring priests by I came to bring a sword I came to bring a man variance against his dad and etc etc etc so I remember that and that just brought me great that gave me peace when he spoke that to me that gave me peace I went my Bible and I was like Wow and that gave me peace cuz I wasn't willing I told you guys before that when I made that decision my relationship with my dad is closer than it's ever been because I made that decision amen and and so I'm I'm thankful I made that decision because that's that's why I'm here tonight because God gave me that decision I could have made a decision to stay but it wouldn't done me no good so I'm so thankful that that uh that I had that I had a personal experience with God God a ceiling a sealing away with God because there's a lot of things I could tell you I went through with my mom and all these things and only reason why I'm here today to to overcome those things because of God he he held me he he's my anchor amen amen so let's go to um let's go to acts so let's talk about the how he changes us I look at Peter we look at Peter take we got a couple more minutes I look at Peter look at his life before he got converted and filled away he he denied Jesus Christ he cursed but but when he received acts 238 so let's go to acts 1 18 but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem in all Judea and in Samaria and he unto the uttermost parts of the earth now when Peter received that Peter was not the same anymore he wasn't the same same Peter that was running away but now he's running into Christ and so the same thing is you need the Holy Ghost you can try to be a good person but that's not good enough there's a lot of good people that going to hell there's there's a lot of Muslims who have better um better morals in the half of the United States has that's right but but God isn't looking for people who just have good morals he's coming back for his Spirit he looking for looking for the spirit inside of him that's what he's looking for and so I tell you tonight is don't just try to be a good person don't try to be good moral person but have a personal experience have a personal experience and don't just stop at one personal experience have multiple you got to have multiple cuz there's a lot of there's a lot of people who have a personal experience that turn away from God I'll give you one Judas isar right Judas iscar saw Jesus heal he he saw Jesus do all these Miracles the loaves of fishes all these things but where is he at today yeah exactly so you can't just stop at one personal experience amen cuz he went to sanctification he went to justification sanctification but he never went to get filled with the Holy Ghost so you got to go past justification because even the Bible says this that uh this man his his house was swept and garnished but he never got filled and guess what happened seven other Spirits came back worse so I tell you this don't just stop a sanctification a lot of people stop there and they miss it and they go back into the world go to the full be sealed until the day of your Redemption as Paul said yeah amen amen let's go to um let's go to 1 Timothy 4:2 so young people start building a strong Foundation today you're never too strong to build a strong pray prayer life you're never too young to seek the Lord with all your heart you're never too young to dedicate your life to God in fact you can dedicate your life right now in your heart to God right now amen let's go to 1 Timothy 4:12 let no man despise thy youth I I see all these young people playing the instruments and all these things um sound back there it brings joy in my heart so don't let anybody despise your youth keep serving God with all your heart in fact this a beautiful time to start serving cuz it's going to carry over and you can teach somebody else how to do that and other people see how you're living and you going be an example to them yes amen so let no man despise that youth be but be thou an example of Believers in the word in the word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith and Purity and we'll just close here with a with a quote and if you got something in your heart for God and you won't express it and so forth and just keep putting it off well later and later on that little desire that you once had to serve God will be taken from you the devil will come in and steal that away and then you won't have any desire to serve him I'm telling you tonight don't brush that desire off God is calling right now don't keep brushing it off that last brush might be too late I told you that year in 2017 I just knew in my heart that if I didn't give my life to God that year I just I just knew they' be the last time he called me I just I just felt it in my heart if I did this is the last chance I had because I brushed it off over and over again I went into the world went back out went into the world back out and and you can't keep playing with God you can't keep playing with God Amen so so if you have that least desire there must be something that even brought you to this breakfast this morning or something to this youth service this tonight Faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word and there must be some desire or you wouldn't even be here now don't let that desire Trinkle off into some little joint or shaking in hands or being sprinkled or something out there let's find the real firm that's established that something that's really all right and just in closing you have an opportunity life has been presented to us tonight we can either take it life or take death so like I said there may be some here tonight that might be on the fence you may not want to be a Christian but I tell you this give God a chance just seek God say Lord I've never experienced you before but Lord I want to experience you in a way I've never never experienced you before make yourself so real to me be open and honest with God God all God is Desiring you to be open and honest with him just pour your heart out to him I know we're struggling I know this is a hard day for young people living I would not want to be a young person today I be straight up honest with you I see the things that you guys got to battle I didn't have to battle 10 15 years ago and it shows me you need God that much more sir because I man I just look and see the young I just see young people just how they talk nowadays I was playing playing basketball Royal Palm one time and they just cussing like grown men I'm like like what is this no respect and all the influen all these things young kids are vaping nowadays and The Vape Shop I see all these things that just that parents it's not child delinquency it's parent delinquency and be thankful you have good parents they care about your well-being they can see things that you can't see down the low see a lot of times as kids cuz I used to be a kid we don't think longterm ahead we just think short term parents looking at long term they're going to say like if you make this decision this is going to happen to you they can see into the future because they've been what they they've been in your shoes at one time so just trust you may not agree what your parents say but trust what your parents say cuz they know what's good for you you're still developing your brain doesn't develop until you're probably in 18 and 20s and so one day you like this other day you don't like this you're up and down kids are up and down always I used to be a kid up and down you like this one day you don't like that one day you like this fashion one day you don't like this fashion one day you like this sport one day you don't like that sport one day and so just know your parents know best right so this en close and give God a chance sir I promise you if you really seek God and say Lord make yourself real to me he will make yourself real to you cuz he made himself real to me and God is not a respector of persons I will tell you that and I'll tell you this that's the best decision I ever made in my life in that car it's a 2010 Jeep Patriot stick shift never forget it never forget that day and and so I many times I go back to that day and just remind myself what God did to me in that car that day and it it just it it it changed me and that's why I I said that's why I'm here today and I'm thankful that that God called me one more time one more time he called me and I'm thankful for that I'm thankful I heed to that call because he's taking me like for instance I would never would ever guessed in my life that I would be going to Puerto Rico to have an opportunity to minister or going to uh to Mexico in Peru next year I never would in a million years is ever imagine doing that and and so I I see God just opening doors cuz I told one thing I remember I telling the Lord I asked the Lord I was like Lord um this is your gift this you you've given me this gift it's yours I'm giving it back to you so Lord if you want me to go preach somewhere Lord you open the door and so I don't I don't force myself I don't say hey I'm a minister I don't I say Lord if you want me to go somewhere Lord you'll open that door and God's been opening doors and I'm thankful for that even at work God's been opening doors to talk with people you know about him and I just see the like one of my friends at work is funny cuz I listen to gospel at work I be blasting gospel we we can blast music they be blasting all this heavy metal and rock and all that stuff why can't I blast my music huh why can't I blast my music and so people make fun of me sometimes that's okay but this one person at my job her name is Vanessa keep her in prayer but um it's funny because I start listening to it she now listen to on her own now and she started asking questions like like deep questions about about the Bible and about the Lord and I to see the Lord just like slowly working on her and everything so I see cuz she listen to like I I love um old school like um I can't think of his name Kurt Franklin that's the best and and many other songs and I got I heard her listening one day I'm like you listen to Kurt Franklin I was like what you listening to I I even got her I even got her I sent her a live live link to the um night of worship and she watched that so I I just see God just moving you know K told the Lord even if it's one Soul at Costco Lord even one Soul one soul and so I'm just thankful for God just for the opportunity um because like I said I wouldn't be here tonight it wasn't for God you know just the person I used to be you know I thought I was a good person I remember many time remember the devil even told me you're going to hell and then but but God said no he said no and so I'm so thankful that I listen to that voice and I can just see God just protecting me in my life from certain things even where I should have been destroyed God his tender hand of grace and mercy even when I was in and wrong he still

brother Mark on tonight uh amen amen um I um I have to say that it's not easy sometimes to stand and give your your testimony um to others you know you just cuz you make yourself vulnerable uh when you're sharing you know just things that the Lord has brought you through but I think on um Wednesday night kind of at the close and even through brother um whisper sermon was talking about how um uh Elizabeth had to go through something so it' be an encouragement for Mar right and um and we all have to go through something to be an encouragement to somebody else so I think that was a a statement that probably brought some freedom to brother Mark just to kind of come and just share his heart uh and you know as as he was say and I can tell you he's not the only one in this room that has things that he had to overcome I could tell you things that I had to overcome sometimes you look at you know the the the ministers behind the pull pit or anybody that's standing here behind the pulpit and you just thinking oh they've been holy all their life no we were all born in sin we were shaped in iniquity come into the world speaking lies and we had something to overcome and and each one of us amen had to come to a spot where we decided to make Jesus our choice amen I'm going to serve you Lord I'm G to follow you I'm going to live for you and and and and I'm going tell you um uh if your worldly friends don't feel a little bit uncomfortable with you something is wrong somewhere amen because you should have so much light on the inside of you that it shines up all their darkness and uh and they should run from you because of all that light right but uh but if they feel comfortable in your presence then there's something there's something wrong you know somewhere praise the Lord I Thank God Amen for for this only Christ can make us whole only Christ can complete us and only Christ can change us amen God bless you brother Mark we really appreciate the word of the Lord on tonight

minister to the hearts of uh the youth not only those that are present but those that are watching online and it's just good to see God how you um can make a change in a person's life and you can set them free from habits and addictions and whatever it is Lord that the enemy is trying to use as a vice or stronghold in their life God there are young people that could hear that if God could do it for brother Mark then I know that same God can do it for me Lord you said in your word as many as believed on him to them he gave power to become sons of God so I just pray Lord as the word is coming come forth tonight that Hearts would be pricked Lord that lives would be changed and that God people would hear the voice of God not the voice of a man but the voice of God speaking through the man and Lord may we come to a spot where we yield to that voice and we just as brother Mark sitting in a car one day not even at church but sitting in a car Lord I want to serve you God I want to follow him reminded of myself Lord just being in the parking lot of a store and coming to that [Music] the same place Lord and father I just trust oh God that as you deal with every heart Lord that you would get the the fruit from the sermon that was preached lives being changed that's what it's all about we trust Lord that as we leave this place but not your presence may we go meditating and thinking on
