part of services and just the lord this lord is so good amen um those specials this morning we want to just thank god for it i love that man the birds took us back and amen pull one out and then sister tanya took us on a medley and i said that's all right [Applause] i was in the office ready to speak in tongues i was like man that that's that that that that's my type of saying just a little drum beat and just everybody clapping your hands and man just let's just have church amen that was that was all right and just just really appreciate all of that this morning um i want to remember brother smiley keeping prayer he's actually in hollywood brother remix church he's speaking there this morning so so happy amen that the lord opened up that door for him to go in amen and just share his heart so let's keep him in prayer while he's away we have a number of saints that are traveling amen this weekend so we want to remember that moment all in prayer as well so amen we just just appreciate the lord uh i see things changed since last weekend uh but thank god he's still worthy to be praised amen brother marquise and brother josue went with us to the men's meeting and we had a wonderful time there in uh tennessee and i trust that the next time we do this i i want i'm gonna be encouraging all the brothers uh to to go and be a part of it i think it will be very very helpful uh for you spiritually they don't uh really all they concentrate is just getting closer to god and we had seven services in a matter of almost two days uh on saturday alone five services in one day can you imagine that five services we weren't thinking about nothing else but just getting the words and uh and i i thought that was just really really special and uh you know we just we really enjoyed ourselves so uh so happy that we were able to be a part of that and we're trusting that we'll be able to take uh some other brothers amen with us the next time we go whether i'm speaking or not i think it's still something that we should be uh participating in amen as men of god uh praise the lord musicians thank you all so much i i certainly appreciate you all amen and uh we thank god thank god for you thank god for you my lord oh my lord and uh i saw that it was it was my bev's birthday today and uh you all don't get a chance to uh to see your weird believing god that she will be able to come from the house to the house of god but uh she watches the services a man she's dependent on that stream because she's there watching stream my bev is brother troy's uh mother a man and um uh being that we are a blended family i call him my beth amen she's precious to me and and i i certainly want to wish her a happy birthday today amen just just thank god for her amen so um i i this sermon that i want to preach today is a sermon that i actually preached for the men's meeting but i have uh rearranged it a little bit for you all and i trust that it'll be a blessing amen to you on this morning so if you don't mind just stand with me and we will read a scripture here genesis chapter 18 genesis 18. as i was approaching the men's meeting i i had really no idea what i would speak on it's my first time actually going to do something like that and as i was sitting and listening to all the other brothers speak i said my god there's a subject there there's a subject there there's a subject of subjects everywhere and i say well lord maybe next time i'll be a little bit more prepared but nonetheless they had a theme and i just looked at their theme and i tried to take a thought from the theme um i believe the lord used it in a very special way uh there among some of the uh the men uh just some of the testimonies that i heard that came back i know that the lord used it so god knows all things amen here in genesis 18 uh we're reading verse 16 through 19 the bible says and the men rose up from thence and looked toward sodom and abraham went with them to bring them on the way and the lord said shall i hide from abraham that thing which i do seeing that abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him we're going to be blessed in him right uh and this is the verse that really uh stood out for i know him right and remember brother kwaku uh preached i know you by your name saith the lord right and that's what god says about abraham and we are we are identified we're blessed in abraham but the scripture says for i know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the lord to do justice and judgment that the lord may bring upon abraham that which he hath spoken of him the lord is a blessing to the reading of his word let's bow in a word of prayer father we are grateful for the privilege and the opportunity to uh approach your thrones what a blessing it is to read the word of god and god is even a greater brother blessing when the holy spirit begins to reveal what we have read that we might be able to apply it to our lives even now we trust oh god that you would just get all the glory and all the honor out of this portion of service thank you for uh the worship the time and song service the specials everything that has happened we feel your presence here today and we believe anything can happen in a presence like this so we trust god that as we enter into the word may uh the anointing that is in the word come upon us and god make a difference in our lives before we leave this place today uh bless our precious brother smiley as he's there ministering father for brother remy in the church use them for your glory for your honor lord bless them uh abundantly is our prayer in jesus name we pray amen amen you can be seated amen and i do want to also just uh say that i thank god for all the brothers that just kind of came last week while we were away and they uh helped get everything all set up i appreciate that um and um uh just you know i i have to call out brother quentin specifically he uh he actually was supposed to go to the men's meeting he had already paid to go uh but i just mentioned to him that i think he and brother josue been going at this time a little difficult so he uh um he said he would stay back and i do appreciate uh him doing that and just making sure things were done so god bless you brother quentin amen thank you so much thank you so much praise the lord amen so i want to just take a simple title amen today um this sermon will be titled traits traits amen uh praise the lord and um we want to just read a little something here from the sermon questions and answers part three brother branham speaks this in 1964. uh the question is dear brother branham is it possible for one to have the baptism of the holy ghost and not to have the signs following at least not until some future time and conditions appointed by the spirit so this is a question that someone is presenting to the prophet about having the baptism of the holy ghost and signs following at some future time right so he answers the question he says but now he says this person here is asking the question about the possibility of having the baptism of the holy ghost without signs following them now if you're born again if you are born first as a human being and a normal human being says now i'm answering this in a real juvenile way of doing it but if you're born a normal human being you will actually do things that a normal human being would do hallelujah he says is that right it says when you're born as a human he says the natural traits of a human being will follow you now he's answering this in a very juvenile way but we have to catch this amen from the spiritual sense because as believers uh fill with the holy ghost and there should just be certain traits that follow the believer amen believers don't follow signs but signs do follow believers glory to god amen says when you're born as a human the natural traits of a human being will follow you and he says you won't live in a tree amen and try to fly with your wings like a bird right if you're just a normal human being you won't do these things he said and try to fly like a bird he says or something like that that isn't uh that wouldn't be a normal human being the normal actions of a human being the normal action of a human being would be to work now i like that statement there the normal action of a human being would be to work because if a man don't work then he don't eat glory to god if you if there's a problem with a man getting up and going to work then we got something something going wrong here somewhere the normal action of a human being is to work all right all right he says not only this he said the normal action of a human being is to marry uh oh amen that that should be that should be a very normal thing that a a man would want to marry a woman a woman want to marry a man amen and notice to say mary not live together mary hallelujah right amen that should be the normal action of a human being says to have a family glory to god to do these things the natural normal human beings because you're born that then then when you're born a christian born of the spirit of god you naturally take up the attributes of christ you see see these traits are in you amen when you got the holy ghost you naturally just take up certain things just by being born again the same way you naturally take up things just by being a human being he says this is now if we took here this morning in this congregation where your people sit here and listen day after day and so forth to teach him you'll find out you'll be different one from another because you're different it shows your makeup different your appetites are different you eat different but you all eat food that's what normal human beings do but now just amen with one individual being just like the other one you're different one from another christians do the same thing you can't say do all speak with tongues do all prophesied do i say no you have to watch these things because a christian takes up the habits of a christian amen and they live like a christian and jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe notice in my name they shall cast out devils they shall take up serpents drink deadly things and they'll speak with new tongues and then things just actually follow christians so i thank god for it it's just a real juvenile way of just kind of showing that uh when we're born again of the spirit god there are just certain traits that will follow us amen we don't have to make it up we don't have to try to pump it up it just happens uh especially when we find ourselves in uh uh uh troubling situations glory to god there are certain traits that are just expressed in a christian that they can't help it it's just there hallelujah amen this this trait means a distinguishing quality uh or characteristic it's an attribute a distinction a trademark a custom a tendency a habit an oddity or an essential quality right so so so when we talk about you know christians uh or you know we let me just put it this way traits can be found in christians trace can be found in families amen and traits are found everywhere so so when we look at a family trait sometimes the way that we're built amen the way that our bodies are built it's something just kind of follows a man a trait in that family glory to god you can't help it that just that's something that wherever it started in your family it just it keeps flowing through you and your kids get the same trait you can't help the way that you build glory to god glory to god amen no matter how many diets you go on amen it's the same result because that's the trait that follows your family and some they lose their hair at a certain age and you'll be trying to do everything you can to keep it together but there's a trait that just kicks in at a certain time and you can't stop it from happening praise god you can try to cover it up you can do all kinds of things but you can't stop that natural trait from occurring in your and amen just in your body hallelujah certain diseases we fight because our family members that it's a trait that just moves down from generation to generation to generation hallelujah glory to god but you know there are some spiritual traits that flow to families sometimes when you find a mother that's a prayer warrior then that gene begins to flow from family member to family member those traits are there maybe they have a trait to be able to fast and and pray praise god that trait will show up in their children a trait to sing a trait to preach there's traits that follows spiritually just like they follow naturally and you can't stop that trait from coming forth if god put it there it must be expressed it's an attribute that shows up in your family traits are found in christians and you know we have uh uh what i would call christians of the flesh and christians of the spirit but nonetheless they're christians and there are certain traits that should follow just by being a christian right and and i'm using this definition from the authoritarian church age don't worry about pulling this up it's a very short one brother iran says a christian is a christian as long as he subscribes to the fact that jesus is the son of god born of a virgin was crucified and died and rose again and i want to i want you to understand just by being a christian you believe in the supernatural just just by being a christian you already believe in the supernatural if you believe jesus died and rose again you have to believe in supernatural if you believe jesus was born of a virgin you have to believe in the supernatural just by being a christian i want to tell you something this morning there is a supernatural trait that flows to you oh hallelujah jesus is the son of god born a virgin was crucified and died and rose again that he is the savior of mankind etc see that that that's what makes you a christian these traits are found in christians these are the things that we believe that's what makes us christians but what i can go a little higher a little further if i can put it that way amen to be a message believer you got traits right there are certain traits that follow you as a message believer amen we believe and identify with the teachings of william mary and branham hallelujah you know i'm going to tell you there's a spirit that has been released in the land and people don't want you to identify with the teachings of william mary and branham amen but as a believer there's a trait that just i'm associated with i believe that god sent a prophet according to malachi 4. i'm talking about according to my bible i believe according to revelation 10 7 i believe god used the ministry of william marion branham just like i believe god used the ministry of john the baptist for the first coming of the lord i believe god used the minister william branham for the second coming of the lord amen so as these are traits that are found in message believers and i want to encourage the church please know where you stand with the message according to the bible read the bible yourself and then get to get the answers to these questions hallelujah right because because people just coming up with all kind of nonsense nowadays i'm going to just give y'all one i'm going to give y'all one that i just heard recently and and i'm hopefully to help you a little bit but somebody told me they said that brother branham uh did not get the teaching of the uh of what happened in the garden of eden that wasn't a revelation that god gave him they said that he learned that in the kkk and i have one question i had one question if he did learn it from the kkk where did the kkk get it where did they get it right all right i mean because if they got it at the bible you can't deny that that's the bible and let me tell you something every denomination or every organization gonna have a part of truth so that don't shake me if they had that they they they might have had that but they got a lot of other stuff they didn't have right right so that don't shake me oh my but you hear all kind of nonsense that's why you got to know know the scripture for yourself right i i i didn't follow this message i'm gonna be honest when this message was introduced to me what i could see is the bible i started look i mean they never preached malachite foreign church i came from never they never preached the book of revelation it didn't even make no sense but when somebody told me this was actually manifested in my day revelation 10 7 malachi 4 what these scriptures are right here i mean being manifested in my time i said yeah i could see that hallelujah let me go a little further as message believers we have certain traits they follow us uh when we look at um let me move on a little further here uh let me just read galatians 5 22-24 i believe a christian filled with the spirit of god will certainly have these traits manifested in them amen galatians 5 22-24 says but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness hallelujah amen and i think when we're bringing it out on wednesday night uh that goodness there is generosity that's what that means the fruit of the spirit you should be generous amen glory to god the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering gypsies goodness faith and as we're bringing that out on on wednesday night you know that that faith is is actually faithfulness right amen being faithful being dependable to god right amen that's the faith that can god depend on you hallelujah glory to god fruit of spirit is love joy peace long suffering gems goodness faith meekness temperance against such there is no law and they that are christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust so as a christian these are traits that should be flowing amen in our beings this scripture also in galatians 3 29 says this and if ye be christ then are you abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise now i want to read a quote here from the message believing god see i believe there are natural traits that flow through us there's also spiritual traits that flow through us and hearing this message believe in god brother adam says now he was jehovah jireh glory to god he was jehovah rapha nisi and on down like that he had seven compound redemptive names and substitutionary to human life took a lamb and offered it up as the provided sacrifice that in isaac all the nations would be blessed and through isaac came out christ and we being dead in christ take on abraham's seed and our heirs according to the promise look at this he says there you are glory to god says there you are and that brings not in our bodies we are gentiles in our bodies we're sinners in our bodies but look at this statement but in our souls being born again with the same spirit was upon faith for abraham and yes he uses this term that strain down and there makes us want to trust god i love that statement right there that string down in there makes us want to trust god he says but the body gets scared there's a strain inside of you there is a trait inside of you that when you're faced with something that seems impossible there's something that makes you you can't explain this but it's a trait that's on the inside a string that is on the inside it makes you want to trust god brother when i read that i began to shout now i understand because sometimes you be trying to figure out you know why am i like this and why am i like that what makes me this way there is a trait [Music] there is a strain inside of me no matter what i'm facing i want a trust call amen that's the mechanism that kicks in first i got a trust card i know i'm going through this how many people trying to tell you that now look at what the doctor said i i realized what the doctor said i realized what this specialist said but there's a trait inside of me i just want to trust god i want to believe god i want to see god make a way out of no way i want to see god open up doors i can't see there is a trait inside of me a string praise god a string that's there hallelujah he said he says the strain down in there makes us want to trust god but the body gets scared but the body gets scared sometimes it's not just your body it's people around you they get scared and they begin to say this and they begin to say that and they just bringing up all kind of doubt but inside of you you just want to believe sometimes you want to tell them just don't say another word i can't listen to that no more i i i i be it i just read the scripture if you be christian or your abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise the same thing that was in abraham is inside of me hallelujah amen i love that so there's there he says uh but in our souls being born again with the same spirit was upon faithful abraham that strain down in there makes us want to trust god but the body gets scared and oh if we're the children of abraham let's be as our father abraham was now how was our father abraham romans amen 4 verse 17 through 21 i won't read it all but i'll just give you that so you can go back and read it yourself uh abraham had qualities of his faith the first is he called things that be not as though they were i'm talking you can't see it you can't feel it but you're still calling it call things that be not as though they were you need to learn how to praise god as though it was hallelujah hallelujah the other quality yeah he against hope believed in hope hallelujah to the lamb of god it says uh here and uh and being not weak in faith glory he considered not his own body now dead when he was about 100 years old so this is one of the qualities of abraham faith everything was against him but he still believed god right hallelujah and not only neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb he wasn't even looking at that not even looking at his body because god can change your body god can change your situation just like that [Applause] hallelujah the bible also said he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief brother when i read the bible i see abraham staggering all over the place but it ain't about what i see it's about what god can see and god said he's tagging out of the promises of god through unbelief if god is saying that about abraham he's saying the same thing about you and look at this look at this this next one he was strong in faith giving glory to god i love that i love that and this final quality of his faith is uh being fully persuaded that what he had promised what god had promised he was able to perform now god if you gave me the promise that you're able to perform the promise now how you do it that ain't up to me that's totally up to you god got over a billion ways to get your needs met don't limit him to one or two ways god got over a billion ways to get your needs man [Applause] all right all right all right i looked at this scripture genesis 18 19 says for i know him that he would command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the lord to do justice and judgment that the lord may bring upon abraham that which he has spoken of him you know and as i start meditating on this scripture uh the bible said abraham was willing to command his children and his household after him and see god knew that trait was inside of abraham and i want you to notice something um the way that this is positioned in the scripture glory to god this is positioned just after god himself comes down with two angels to visit abraham and sarah in the tent and when abraham saw uh uh saw god and his two angels abraham yelled out my lord not my lord so so there's a trait that will follow abraham's seed that they won't see three gods they don't see father son and holy ghost as three separate gods they see it as one god so they'll scream out the same thing abraham said my lord hallelujah glory to god but here you know god is coming down in the flesh to visit abraham and and as he's there if it's in abraham he asked some questions say where's sarah your wife oh she's in the tent behind you he's saying i'm gonna visit sarah and you're gonna have a son in the time of life and sarah began to laugh in the tent in her heart and he said why sarah laughing and attending you know and laughing about the promise that i just gave he asked the question is there anything oh hallelujah glory to god how many times have we laughed at the promise how many times have we disbelieved what god gave us and what he said but god asked the question to us the same way he asked it to abraham and say is there anything too hard for the lord and i'm going to tell you something god don't even care about sarah's laughing he's still going to manifest the promise god don't care about your doubt and you're laughing god don't still manifest his promise your doubt can't stop cut your unbelief can't stop god your laughter can't stop god oh hallelujah glory to god i'm so glad that nothing i can do that can stop god's promise from being made manifest in my life is there anything too hard for the lord no it might be too hard for me it might be too hard for you but the question is is there anything too hard for the lord and my answer that no ain't nothing too hard for my god my god is greater my god is stronger my god is higher than any other awesome in power right that's my god i i i was thinking this week i say i served the same god that opened up the red sea little children of israel i served the same god that that that that that that took fire out of a a burning furnace jumped in with a man as the fourth man to to take the fire that's the god that i serve i i turned to god that when a man got thrown into a den of hungry lions he could just lay there and sleep praise god because the lions knew that there was something in there besides that man the pillow fire was in there i served that same god amen as i heard about him making a way for the children of israel and doing all these great things but that same god is making a way for us right now it's not a different god it's the same god glory hallelujah here abraham is is giving a man uh this visitation by almighty god and two angels and he's telling abraham a promise that sarah's going to have a son sarah's going to have a son i'm going to visit her at the time of life and and then he says now you know i'm getting ready to leave and you know and and they start turning looking towards sodom so in between this visitation and the promise given to sarah glory to god and then the time of destruction for uh for sodom and gomorrah god makes these uh statements about abraham i like this i like this amen he says abraham was willing to command his children and his house so after him glory to god abraham was willing to teach him and god knew that he would and uh you know as i thought about it you know i'm looking at him uh just just making these statements and i i just it just it struck me could god say the same thing about us for i know him before destruction in sodom can you imagine i mean god know abraham and keep his kids out of sodom abraham not going to raise his kids in an environment like that hallelujah right i mean i mean god knew there was certain things certain qualities of traits that was in abraham and my question is can god say the same thing about us for i know him i know [Applause] her they will command their children oh hallelujah and their household after them and they shall keep the way of the lord to do justin and judgment i thought about even in your businesses does god know you well enough to know that you ain't gonna work those shady deals that you ain't gonna do nothing to compromise on the word of god sometimes you have to say no to some business deals if it's going to amen if it's going to do damage to your reputation if it's going to do damage to your testimony you're going to have to say no i don't care how lucrative it is god say i know them they're going to do justice and judgment glory to god as i thought as i pondered this amen i knew that there was a negative trait that isaac picked up that his daddy also displayed and i want to i want to just share with you negative traits amen that flow through your children will pick up unless you can bring those things underneath the blood of jesus oh glory to god i'm gonna just read a quote this is gonna be rather lengthy but i think it'll be good amen abraham i mean isaac picked up a lying treat because abraham abraham lied to amen abimelech he also lied to pharaoh about sarah being his sister rather than santa's wife isaac did the same thing when he went down to abimelech he told him that that that rebecca was his sister a line trait i'm gonna tell you line traits flow through families you'd be wondering why this is this one line that one line everybody lied the mama lie the the children lie the grandchildren lie everybody be lying it's a trait that follows that family unless that trait is brought underneath the blood it'll still just be flowing in that family i mean fabricators make that thing up and even they believe it they believe their own story it's the truth anyhow you know i can sit here and tell you different traits that just flow you know that uh uh uh uh sometimes you have let me read this quote let me just read this quote rather than do that this is a out of the message of paradox and uh this is a rather lengthy quote but i want you to see how this this there's a trait that flows through this family negative things can flow through a family just the same way positive things can flow through it says for instance a few days ago it says i was called on the scene a little something going on there was a fine young man fine boy he was going with a little girl very fine little girl out of a fine family so i mean the girl come from a fine family the boy come from a fine family i mean fine people that's what brother brother brandon called it says in this boy all of a sudden came up with some kind of an idea and he just walked away so he left a relationship with this girl he was in a real good relationship and he came over some kind of just walked away from the relationship hallelujah young people y'all better watch some of the traits that might be in certain people watch their family when you court in court they family too you better watch them trace because they'll show up now i mean they're i've seen people where you know like somebody family might have lost their mind at a certain age they lost their mind and all of a sudden you got to watch that child you got to watch that person because at a certain age something just kick in and they be they lost their mind and now you're dealing with it it's the truth and they're high oh glory and look you just tell me just that crazy uncle uh-huh know there's something that follows that family now the only way to break that is the power of the holy ghost that's why you better make sure they have the holy ghost let me read let me read let me read it says uh and this all of a sudden came up with some kind of idea and he just walked away he did something wrong to the little girl and much is promised her to do a certain thing then he didn't do it and instead of coming to the girl and apologizing like a gentleman should do he it just wasn't in him to do it and the father and mother called me to the scene and said we would desire to know what is wrong with our boy say now it's not easy to do sometime but you must be truthful and honest now look at this you know this this family calling brother branham tell us what's matter of our boy and brother branham going there not nothing spiritual no vision i'ma just tell you the truth because the truth can make you free so now it's easy he says not easy to do sometime but you must be truth and honest therefore the boy was a christian as far as a believer he had repented and had been baptized and had his position among the believers but yet had not received the baptism of the holy spirit no matter how much he thought he had and this is a problem even in the church today people think they receive the holy ghost but they haven't received it yet and what happens when certain things happen in life you realize where you stand when that trial hits you you realize where you stand because if you had the holy ghost you wouldn't be responding that way [Music] look at this he says you thinking you have and having it is two different things you might be able to try to say you have you might be able to show some evidence of some emotion but unless your life is vindicating what you're professing to have you still haven't got it no matter how many emotions how much you jump run sensations speaking in tongues or shining whatever you might lay it upon which is all right i believe in all that too but unless your life copes with your testimony then you haven't got it let's go on it says because the fruit of the spirit vindicates what you are just like the fruit of any tree tells what it is jesus said by their fruit you shall know them so now this young fellow's parents his mother is german he says no reflection on the german but there is a strain in that family a trait a strength in that family and that is he says they'll just sit and you can talk to them and they'll just stare you right in the face now this is a trait in this family this is a strain in this family all of them do the same thing you sit and talk to me just look at oh glory to god i i can go a lot of places with this some families have that role in our trait all right i mean they speak with their body language hallelujah right hey man but he say say this family just stare and just look at you and just stare and you're just pouring your heart out it's a trait in a family you can't make them no different right now look at what he said it says uh oh hallelujah this will set you free when you start understanding people and just some of these they they what we call idiosyncrasies just their makeup right you can you can get free from some stuff watch this oh glory to god some families love the gossip it's just in the family it's the only the holy ghost that take that out of you you just want to know anything just get around one of the members of that family it's a truth in the eye can't hold nothing you better not give no secret to that family your secret will be all over it's a truth anyhow y'all know y'all don't run into families like this and you just i mean sometimes you think it's just this person don't go look at their sister and their brother and they their dad and their mama and just sometimes sit in the house and just listen to happy listen listen to the conversation my god my god i ain't saying nothing about nobody but oh when you start using language like that you already know it's the truth in the house let me move on let me move on i'm coming home i'm coming home but he said this says uh they'll just sit and you can talk to them they'll just stare you right in the face that this this girl's sister the mother of this boy her sister i have come down the street many morning and this young lady be sitting out in the yard and i said good morning to you she just look at me and i stop and i say sure fine morning she would stand look right at you an intelligent woman and i say come up to see you sometime she just stand and look where her brothers are that way father and mothers that way traits so now the father the boy is strictly an irishman not so here's a irishman that married a german okay the father that boy now i'm gonna tell you look look y'all every nationality carries a spirit y'all ain't gonna say amen you got to understand some of the you know like there are certain uh languages they're spoken so hard and so rough german is one of those language creole is one of those another one of those language they speak it so hard it seems like they fussing all the time they're not fussy that's just the way it is that's just a trait and then you get all offended because they said they didn't stay with just talking that's just the way they are and they they got to get their point across it's the truth any high amen amen american got this the spirit of frolic and folly everything's a joke to the americans laugh about everything all right i'm go i'm going on the prophet already identified all these things these are traits y'all these are traits spirits all right look at this now look look look look it says uh the father is born strictly an irishman moody and high high-tempered the daddy moody and high-tempered high-strung that's his whole family like that except one other out of the family converted since now in this boy the father and mother both are christians filled with the holy ghost and they have brought this young man up in the way of the lord now the young man is about 17 or 18 years old something along there very fine kid and he's been a real model boy at home nice kid and he's got a brother that's just vice versa says but the girls the mother's family lives close to a fine church but do you think they'd ever come over there no and they know it's right it says but it's just not in them to ask forgiveness or ask partly so that means they're not going to the altar to ask god to forgive them other sins there's a trait in them that stops them say they just won't do it it's just not in them this is not a genes in the father and the mother this boy no matter how much they are converted oh lord look at this statement no matter how much they are converted it still remains the flesh that's been interbred out to this boy so what came from the german side and what came from the irish side is in the boy it says therefore that boy has got a complex in him just like from his mother's family and they are not forgiving they will not apologize that's where that boy stands that's where it came up when he found himself in a situation where he needed to apologize it just was not in him even he a church boy even though he's a fine boy but there's a trait that's dominating there he says now i said to the father no matter how much you raise them up no now look out look look at you out of your family uh all of them drunks and fighting and shooting and cutting and so forth it's the truth in it huh i mean i come from a family where all the men were womanizers running from this woman to the next woman to the next woman and you know find out later on in their life they got kids from somebody when they were visiting somewhere what are you talking about what kind of life is that but it's the holy ghost that actually changes you and makes you a different person hallelujah glory your sisters could come from families where maybe a mama or grandma was very loose you had to watch your boyfriend coming to the house because your mama might try to take your boyfriend or your grandma might try to make a move on your boyfriend it's the truth any high them traits and families but it's the holy ghost that breaks that type of stuff hey man it's the truth a young man got to watch his daddy round his brown around his it's better half it's a trait he's seen these things in his daddy hallelujah glory to god amen watch your kids around certain environments amen glory to god like well that was when they was young that spirit is still there all right all right all right traits spirits follow families all right glory to god let me let me go it says now um all all them drunks and fighting and shooting and cutting and so forth now look at your family to the mother now look at brother brandon i'm giving these people advice they want to know what's the matter with their son look at your family can you imagine the prophet telling you something look at your family to the mother they're a bunch of people he's just telling the truth just sit there won't speak very independent so forth irreverent to religion that's your family right but i said it's not you you're the only one of all your sisters and brothers you are sweet kind and forgiving what does that you're you're in your tree part of that family tree yet you have received the holy ghost that's the thing that made you tend and sweet it's not your people anymore it's your christ that lives in you glory hallelujah i said to the boy look at your family practically all of them are drunks and so forth i said now and how moody and high-tempered and how strong but you're not you're kind forgiving what is it the holy spirit you know more what you are is christ in you i said now the same thing has to happen to your son now i want you to look at this high strung daddy look at this high strung daddy now brother branham just told him he was hot strong and look at how he manifested and the father raised up after brother adam told him that the father raised up and said my son went to the altar he was baptized correctly in the name of jesus christ sometimes we try to take up for our kids hallelujah and uh but but the prophet could see a little bit more than this look it said it said he was baptized in incorrectly in the name of jesus christ and water baptism said i know my son has come to christ i said that may be all right all the outward motions he might be identified as believer with the believers but until he's regenerated born again i'd advise that that young man to never marry a woman that's my advice that's no vision this is just a trait that's in your families in the mama's family and the daddy's family and until he's born again don't let that boy marry did i advise that you yup that young man never the married woman he'll make hell on earth for her and some some of us have relationships where it's just hell on earth it's because of a trait that we didn't identify hallelujah before you just run out there doing stuff might you might want to just get a little counsel and can you imagine brother branham giving counsel and telling the girl don't marry that boy there until he gets the holy ghost well he went and got baptized don't marry that boy there until he get the holy ghost because that boy there the boy that's going to church acting like he a christian looking like a christian that boy gonna make hell on earth for you look at this it says he'll make hell on earth for her until that gentle sweet uh a forgiving forgiving spirit of christ come in then that will be a paradox in itself to to take the very nature of a boy that's bred between father and mother and yet in his intellectuals he's trying his best to overcome it only in his intellectuals right he's trying his best to overcome it he can't do it he'll never overcome it christ will have to overcome it see that you can't do it it's christ that has to do within you all you can do is surrender more and more to christ amen says when he lets christ come in christ in then he's already overcome then it'll be a perfect paradox when a man is born of the spirit of god so see here's the thing that trait a man was following or that strain was in his family through just the the just the makeup of the family so when this boy ran into a little situation nice young man but run to a situation that trait showed up that he couldn't apologize broke the girl's heart and could not apologize as a gentleman he should have come back and apologized but couldn't do it and he'll go on from that girl to the next girl and let the holy ghost get a hold of him and changes the way he do things oh hallelujah to the lamb of god all right i'm looking at this amen i want to just um this scripture just really got me before i know him genesis 18 19 5 know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the lord to do justice and judgment that the lord may bring upon abraham that which he has spoken of him now um this this this just blesses my heart god saw positive traits inside of abraham right before this destruction of of sodom amen he makes these words after his visit visit to abraham and and his promise to sarah that she's going to have uh she's going to bear a son of her old age and god already saying what kind of father abraham going to be god already knows amen i want to say this to the young men that are not married god already knows what type of father you're going to be for for the young ladies that are not married god already knows the type of mother that you're going to be hallelujah and i love the way that god brags about abraham he says for i know him that he he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the lord to do justice and judgment that the lord may bring upon abraham that which he has spoken of him now this this statement of he will command his children a household after him that means abraham's life is going to impact generations i want you to think about that your life will impact generations glory to god amen hallelujah hallelujah it's good to see you i saw ryan a little early it's good to see him uh your life can impact generations watch this now watch this it says uh his families will keep the ways of the lord now that blesses me that just blesses me if there is anything that any parent would want my mama wrote a song so i might not have a lot of money to leave my kids when i leave here but there's one thing that i want to leave my children a heritage of faith to guide me along my way right and then that's the greatest thing that a parent can leave their children is is to see them having a relationship with the lord jesus amen walking the same way the parent walk when it came to serving god amen that's the greatest thing that's the greatest treasure that a parent could have hear abraham is saying he's gonna god said he's gonna teach his family to keep the ways of the lord i think that's beautiful it says he was he will he will uh his seed will do justice and judgment and i thought to myself in business they will be just in judgment they will be just and i asked myself i see the negative trait i see the negative trait that kind of flowed down because i can you know i can go back in scripture and i can show you uh abraham lot he lied to abimelech eli the pharaoh genesis uh chapter 12 verse 10 through 20 you'll see where he lied to abimelech amen also uh uh you know you find the same thing where isaac lot amen to abimelech in genesis 26 uh he lied to abimelech about rebecca being his his uh his sister so you know we could see that negative trait just kind of flowing but what is this positive thing that god sees in abraham what's this positive trait that's coming out hallelujah hallelujah i think we find something here in hebrews 11 verse 17 through 20. let's look at this because you know abraham had a positive trait and he's what god begins is to do is write about abraham in the book of hebrews which was the the the chapter that kind of talks about the the heroes of faith amen sarah's name was listed there glory to god but we're also going to see isaac's name is listen there there's some positive trait that's flowing down passing from abraham going down into isaac and i believe that same trait is inside of us today here hebrews 11 verse 17 by faith abraham when he was tried offered up isaac and he that had received the promises uh offered up his only begotten son of whom it was said that in isaac shall thy seed be called accounting that god was able to raise him up even from the dead from whence all which also he received them in a figure by faith isaac blessed jacob and eats all concerning things to come now i want to just look at this amen just for a little bit because the prophet made a statement in the message masterpiece it talked about how when a uh when adam fell here on the earth uh he fell into sin because of eve introducing him to something that he should have never got involved in but willingly adam went out betraying christ amen he willingly went out and got involved in this thing that eve amen got involved with hallelujah now i don't believe that adam had it in him to redeem eve he couldn't bring her back to the place which she left hallelujah that was not inside of adam that's only in christ but he went out to portray christ let's look at it oh hallelujah look at this now look at this look at this amen brother branham said when uh when adam failed god immediately began to go back to work again because he had his masterpiece adam in the garden of eden but but when adam fell the masterpiece fell so god immediately began to go back and and rebuild that masterpiece he said he put it on four foundations hallelujah the first foundation was abraham's faith the second foundation was isaac's love the third foundation was jacob's grace and the full foundation was joseph's perfection hallelujah brother adam said god began to rebuild this masterpiece and he put it on a sure foundation abraham's faith isaac's love jacob's grace and joseph perfection now when we look at abraham we can see abraham's faith abraham took off looking for a city whose building maker was god his faith was was was manifested just about in everything he did we look at isaac's love we look at jacob's grace and amen and jacob should have lost his life multiple times but god stepped in he should have lost his life against his brother esau should have lost his life against laban but god stepped in and gave jacob grace hallelujah joseph's perfection there was brother branham say there was nothing against him just to scratch to advise his father not to tell pharaoh that they were shepherds because a shepherd was an abomination amongst the egyptians but in joseph there was perfection he got sold into slavery and never did anything wrong joseph's perfection but isaac's love that really struck me why would brother branham tell us that this foundation that god used to rebuild the masterpiece the second foundation was isaac's love isaac's love now as i processed this first thing came to my mind was this love story between isaac and rebecca hallelujah now there's things inside this love story that certainly type christ amen but let's look at it the the relationship that isaac had with rebecca was a type of the relationship that the church has with christ today brother adam says uh rebecca watered the camels which was the beast of power amen she watered those camels and the same camels that she water is what was used to carry her to her isaac he says in the church of the living god today is rejoicing and watering the power of the holy ghost that'll pick her up someday and take her yonder to meet the isaac in the air for the wedding supper brother this message that we send amen to we're watering the camel we're watering a power that's gonna change our bodies this message that we're feeding on do you realize when when when when rebecca amen left her people hallelujah to the lamb of god amen she had to walk out by faith she had to leave her family behind she had to leave her friends behind she had to leave the things of the world behind and she had to go forth to a man that she never even saw a picture of all she heard was the testimony of his character and she was drawn in by the testimony of the character also she was all she was already kin to this man by being kind to him she knew that there were certain characteristics that would already be there family traits hallelujah we already came to christ look at this another statement brother branham makes here uh and i said rebecca had to decide to leave everything behind to go to isaac we have to we have to leave the world and our denominational thinking behind to pursue christ the promised son uh it was in the field and in the evening time that isaac and rebecca first met and brother branham say it was love at first sight i just have a question do you love the words are you still fighting with it you know a husband and wife that's always in the back background and at home fighting all the time it don't make a real comfortable environment it's hard hard to raise kids in an environment like that it could cut i mean and i'm going to tell you some kids refuse to get married because of the way they see any mamas and daddies act don't want i want to avoid marriage i want to avoid marriage do you see what that did to my mom and daddy but but we don't want to fight with the word if the words say don't do this we ain't gonna do it the words say don't do that dress this way dress that's exactly yes lord yes lord that's the way we want to respond to the word just have a submissive attitude to the word but don't fight with it well i think i can do a little bit of this and that no that's not what god say run from the things of the world shun the very appearance of the things of the world let me go on a little further let me go on a little further hallelujah you know i'm going to tell you uh typically when you see a child maybe struggling in a particular area with things of the world oftentimes the parent struggles in that same area the parent struggles that the parent does not have a conviction in that area because if they had a conviction they would stand against that child it's the truth anyhow hallelujah glory to god hey man you i mean sometimes parents our kids gonna push us to the limit that's all right god will take care of them after that after they push it to the limit look this is my house and you ain't gonna do that in my house and that and sometimes they make it uh i heard you been talking that that's this your house now you're gonna have to prove it i've been there i had to do it this is my house i have to prove it now i don't want to prove it but i'ma have to prove it glory to god now leave the rest of that up to god when i honor god i know god gonna honor me brother branham said uh it was in the field and then evening time that isaac and rebecca first met and it was love at first sight he said she was taken into abraham's tent and there became an heir and inherited all things this is a type of the church meeting christ in the air and going to the wedding supper so we can see amen this love story of isaac and rebecca we can see how the church is tight with that but when i thought about this trait i felt that it was a lot deeper than the love story between isaac and rebecca oh hallelujah hallelujah amen this trait that i saw amen and isaac this very positive trait that i believe god saw in isaac and god god god said it for i know him he said this about abraham for i know him that we he will command his children and i believe this this just my personal faith i believe the way that we can command our children is by the way we live before our children we don't have to make them do nothing but it's the example that we set before our children that our children want to follow i know my dad is a christian i know my mama's a christian and i want to follow her we see it we see it we see it in genesis 22. let's just read a little bit of it but this is how we this is that positive trait that is flowing down from abraham and we see it rise up in isaac here in genesis 22 verse 1 it says and it came to pass after these things that god did tempt abraham so it was a trial for abraham god allowed a trial to come into his life and said to him abraham and say behold here i am and he said take now thy son thine only son isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of moriah and offer him therefore a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which i will tell thee of and abraham rose up early now now i want you to understand when we enter verse 3 abraham is demonstrating his faithfulness to god isaac also has seen that same faithfulness that abraham had he this is why abraham can command his children because isaac know that his dad has been faithful in serving god his daddy and faithful and everything that he's dead is that he's done i mean it's just something about and you know at this stage of life obviously isaac is just a teenager see it's in those years that we're really influencing our kids the most in those teenage years you realize amen they have uh the teenage years is the shortest time period of their life so you get to be a child up to the age 12. and now they're trying to force you at 18 to become an adult right at 18 you still got 10 on the end of it but they're still trying to force you to be an adult but really you get from 13 to 19 roughly six or seven years to be a teenager but after that you are an adult for the rest of your life so the shortest time period is one of the most influential time periods i wish i would have brought that out at the men's me that's it says abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took uh two of his young men with him and i took his son enclaved the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went into the place of which god told him then on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place so far off and abraham said unto his young men about ye here with the ass and i in the land will go younger and worship and come again to you now abraham is speaking by faith abraham could not share amen what he was going to do he can share that with isaac he can share that with sarah he couldn't share that amen with these young lads he had to hold this thing to himself and there's some things that god is giving you you got to hold to yourself you can't give it to everybody else but his faith says we'll come again to you look at this in verse 6 and abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon the eyes of his son and he took the finest ham and the knife and they went both of them together and i love verse 7. because this is where i see isaac seeing all the faithfulness in his daddy and see i like to say it like this this ain't isaac's first rodeo this ain't the first time he went to a sacrifice and he done went so much that he recognizes everything that's supposed to be there oh hallelujah do your children actually where's sister so-and-so where's brother so-and-so because they know who's supposed to be in church they've been coming so often that they know who's missing and i expected abraham his father and said my father and it said here am i my son and it said behold the fire and the woods that i see fire and i'm carrying wood jesus carried across and i'm carrying wood he said and behold in the wood where is the lamb for a burnt offering i mean isaac asked him the right question and abraham glory to god amen a man walking by faith all he can do is answer with a faith answer and his face said and abraham said my son god will provide himself i just love that brother brother solomon helped me see that some years ago not for himself but god would provide himself a lamb for a burnt orphan so they went both of them together what a beautiful beautiful story i i i you all know the rest of it abraham took isaac up this mountain and isaac was willing to lay himself down to become the sacrifice so when brother branham said that the foundation that second foundation was isaac's love is because we can see the love of christ reflected through the promised son isaac that he was willing to lay down his own life not just oh mariah cause i i told you all this before and i got quotes to prove it brother branham said that abraham took isaac up the same heel that christ himself would be buried on this was not a mistake this was not an accident i mean the same hill in jerusalem when i went to israel a number of years ago as as they brought us into jerusalem we had spent all of our time outside of jerusalem and uh the last five days we went to jerusalem and when we got in there the the uh the the tour guide he said this is mariah i said uh i said and everybody else probably had no idea what the man just said i said did you did you say that this is mariah he said yeah this is moriah i said now do you realize what you're saying they say yeah i say moriah is the place that abraham brought isaac he said yes this is mariah i said well where's calvary he said just on the other side of the hill i say uh well it's my first time in israel i don't know what just on the other side of the hill mean my first time seeing this place so i pulled out my google app and i just put in the question how far is mariah from calvary and when i got the response back they said a four minute walk when i saw those results that a light bulb just went off you mean to tell me that abraham brought isaac to the same mountain that jesus was going to be offered on how perfect could our god be how perfect can god be to do something like that it is not just a bible story it's god's love story to us and i looked at isaac this trait that was in isaac is that he had a willingness to surrender himself to become a sacrifice the burnt offering and god had to stop abraham abraham abraham stays still your hand i see that you're faithful i see that you love me and see i'm gonna tell you god got to watch you in the midst of your trial to see how faithful you're gonna be you can't be faithful until the trial you've got to be faithful in the midst of the trial the foundation of isaac's love was there because of what isaac was willing to do not his relationship with rebecca that was beautiful but because he was willing to lay his life down this is where god you know uh uh uh spoke to abraham said no still your hand i i had a ram in the bush pull that ram out a male lamb ram brought it up there and later on we see god did provide himself the sacrifice when jesus came to the same spot to be off of our sins there he was blessed and i'd just like to read the rest of this because this is your blessing this is for you verse 15. let's skip down there i'm sorry verse 14. and abraham called the name of the place jehovah jireh my provider as it said to this day in the mount of the lord uh it shall be seen and the angel lord called an abraham out of the heaven the second time and said by myself have i sworn saith the lord for because thou has done this thing and hast thou has not withheld our son that only son that in blessing i will bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the sea shall not seed shall possess the gate of his enemies what is your enemy this morning as a seed of abraham you are promised you're going to possess it that means you're not going to be defeated no matter what you're up against let me just finish with this last quote here from the message the identified masterpiece of god oh i just love this god's love was expressed through isaac his willingness to be sacrificed at mount moriah it demonstrated god's love and provision and ultimate sacrifice with mankind that's what it was all about hearing this message that identified masterpiece of god brother branham says but we find out when he started again it started with abraham he talked about rebuilding this uh masterpiece he started with abraham and abraham he started him on an unconditional covenant so when abraham was lying about sarah being his uh his sister well before abraham told that lie god had already given abraham an unconditional covenant that unconditional over covenant overrode all of his actions i love this look he says uh now if you will i have i've already done it i've blessed you you and your seed and so forth after you it was an unconditional covenant he started with abraham his workmanship again and now with his unconditional covet then we find out he based on abraham and give him the covenant unconditional with the promise then he came to the patriots we come next in the old testament as we go down here he displayed the foundations of his work now we have abraham it says now we have abraham glory uh isaac jacob joseph the four patriots now abraham represented faith work faith because abraham was of faith he had that great faith because he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief when we say the chips is down and everything against him he's still held on to god and that's that's the way we are when the chips are down everything against us we still hold on to god so it's just it's just something that we just we just it's a gene this is trading us we believe god listened to the testimony last week from brother solomon with his air conditioning laid hands on it that's a trait it's a trait from god it's a trait i mean i i i i've seen um i remember brother wisdom sharing a testimony with him one time he said he got on on the highway and don't realize didn't realize he had done this but they got it got to a place where the gas was running out in this car in the middle of nowhere but that trait kicked in god i believe you put gas in the car till i can get to a gas station and that car kept driving till he got to a gas station i mean brother brother wesker one time locked his keys in the car back then when he had no triple a i'm gonna tell you aaa sometimes can actually reduce our faith these services that we have all these services that we get it reduces our faith we don't have to use our faith we just call somebody he said i mean i'm in the middle of nowhere it's it's the winter time and my my keys are locked in the car i got to get home i can't be stuck out here stay laid hands on the car lay your hands on the car and the locks pop just like that bro let's go share that testimony years ago it's that trait that is inside of him called things that be not as though they were he says uh everything's against him he's still held on to god now i want to ask you if everything's against you are you still holding on do you still got a praise on the inside this last statement says in this next statement i should say he says then we have isaac which was beloved son which represented love because abraham being a type of god as as it was offered genesis 22 we find out that he carried the wood up the hill and everything portrayed christ foreshadowed him and then the ram came and was often in his stand that's isaac's love now that was faith love and jacob which means supplanta and see you know when i was just meditating on the scripture i just i'm like i know it's not just in in in the love story that isaac and rebecca have it got to be something greater that trait got to be producers upgraded and when i thought about genesis 22 i said oh there it is and then i found the quote where brother branham said i said yes i'm in the right channel i like to run my thoughts back through the message because i'm gonna tell you satan will give you some thoughts and they'd be so far out you ain't got nothing to support it with hallelujah look he says now that was faith in faith love and jacob which means the planner and that's a deceive and we realize that jacob's life represented really represented grace because it was grace of god all the time with jacob then come joseph there's nothing against joseph he was the perfect perfected one god's prophet that came forth among his brethren and hated without a cause and was soul and in every way his life foreshadowed the life of jesus christ came to his own his own received him not as joseph was hated by his brother and thrown into a ditch supposedly be dead took out exalted to the right hand of pharaoh and when he left the throne they blowed the trumpet now every knee had to bow to joseph every knee had to bow to joseph hear this strain um brother branham speaks of it in spoken words original seed and there is a strain a trait that has come through to us we thank god for this we're built on the foundation of faith love amen grace perfection we're built on that we're standing on that foundation as as god's masterpiece amen in this final day here in the spoken word's original seat my final quote says christ couldn't help being what he was he was the son of god that's it see what i mean now see if you were intended you see the word of god you believe it because why there's something new no see why says have you ever heard of strain in a family this is this is beautiful for me you know the reason that you believe the message the way you believe the message because there's a trait that you were born with that you can help but identify with truth you had that before you was even born it's the trait of predestination the gene of election it was dwelling inside of you that's why as soon as you said it you saw it you said amen to it i was thinking to myself you know many of our kids and grandkids they don't they don't they don't know what we came out of we try to explain to them what the denominational system was all about and why we left there why this message meant so much to us right we try to explain but they just don't understand the reason it is because they've never been there but as soon as they go as soon as they go they begin to realize well it don't take them more than a year six months to see all the fallacy in it but the pride the pride is what stops them from coming back that's all that's stopped they already know the truth they don't seen it it it produced itself just like that it's a spirit that follows denominations right but it's the pride that actually stopping god would strip that pride away and let me tell you when something go wrong they know who to call they ain't calling that denominational church for no prayer they know who to call to get would you have the church and you know what the church does we pray we take that request before god but i'm going to tell you something sometime and when i when i hear prayer requests i don't hear the same thing y'all be hearing i don't hear the same thing you hear i'll be hearing oh yes lord you're getting their attention yes lord you yes you let you let that happen to get their attention now they're gonna put their faith in you they can't trust nothing else but you and that's where you want them to be at yes lord use it for your glory god look at this it says uh have you have you uh ever heard of a strain in a family a son would kind of impersonate his father or the mother or the grandfather the grandmother that strain in the family you heard of it haven't you well that's the same thing from your destination you were supposed to be here in the right way at the beginning but being that you come the way you did you're subject to the fall but being that you're predestinated you hear the word it brings you right back where you were producing it just by hearing and receiving the word it brings you back to where you were producing amen never saw that before brings you right what makes you believe the word of god and turn down these other things is because there's something in you way back yonder uh you you are made to live here forever i want scripture for that preacher here it comes all that he foreknew he's called all that he has called good god almighty he has justified and all that he has justified he is already glorified i thank god for that godly trait dwelling inside of me that treated predestination amen and i believe it's slowing down from me to my loved ones and and i'm just claiming each and every one of them by the grace of god i'm claiming each and every one of them thank god for his word the lord bless your church amen [Applause] let's pray musicians you all can come lord jesus how grateful we are for the word how grateful we are for truth how grateful we are for this trait of predestination that flows through us is what allows us to be able to respond to the word with an amen we don't have to fight with the word that's what that's what lot and his family were doing down in sodom fighting with the word running from truth god but you went down there and you uh even answered a prayer for abraham that he never even prayed but he had a desire to read their book of genesis 18 i believe it was god after you said these powerful things about him say i'm going to turn i'm going down into sodom because i hear about the sin down there and i need to go and check it out you went to investigate sent two angels before you before you destroyed it the lord just uh reports abraham praying after every 50 would you destroy the city for 50. he said no no i won't destroy for 50. he said what if it's just lacking five of the 50 would you destroy the city if it's lacking five and only 45 you say nope i won't destroy for 45. well what about 40 i won't destroy for 40. what about 30 god would you destroy this 30 righteous people that are living there would you destroy it no i won't destroy it for 30. god don't be upset with me what about 20 if there's 20 would you spare the city of sodom and gomorrah for just 20 righteous people so if i can find 20 of them down there i'll spare it abraham just intervened and standing in the gap god that's what we're doing we're praying coming to these prayer meetings on tuesdays we're standing in the gap for others we know that destruction is at hand you you've already revealed god that destruction is at hand and people are lingering in sodom lingering with the things aside i'm still struggling with the world sisters that can't overcome pain and polish and god just struggling in those areas father these are things that it's about pleasing you it's not about pleasing a man it's about pleasing you god that's not what you want of your bride that's not what you're looking for one that's untouched by the things of the world as virgin to the things of the world that's what you want god brothers struggling father in the way that they dress and where they present themselves and god and lustful thoughts god you need people free from that [Music] father uh abraham just prayed he said god let me just just one more request what if what if there's just ten would you destroy the whole city if you find 10 righteous people what abraham was really praying for was lot this family he never accident specifically but when you went down to sodom lord you you gave him a promise that i won't destroy if i find 10 you couldn't find 10 so you destroyed but in the midst of it it brought out abraham's family [Music] god bring our families out bring our children out our sons and our daughters bring them out god so we stay true to this word and it's our lord we're gonna hold up this bloodstained banner be willing to sacrifice whatever it takes god isaac was willing to give his whole life what are we willing to give up for christ [Music] father that's a question that we all have to answer let us be sincere [Music] our hearts to yours and just as you were willing to go to a crossroads let us be willing to go to a cross for you to take up our cross and to follow you bless every ear that has heard the word today especially special blessing upon my bear of god she celebrates her birthday bless her abundantly toucher on her body should be able to come to the house of god and to worship lord as she desires is anything too hard for the lord no no nothing is too hard for our god it's in jesus name we pray [Music] amen remember solomon i will turn the service back to you god bless you let's all stand a man let's sing a course to this song amen i am a child of god [Music] no longer [Music] foreign [Music] for i am a child of god praise the lord amen i actually wanted to sing i am a friend of god you know as our pastor was preaching there's so much that he said that just makes you think you know i got to thinking about being a friend of god and what that actually meant that visitation to abraham was because he was a friend of god so a statement came out of god's mouth shall i hide anything from abraham it was because it was his friend and this scripture came to my mind so i wanted to pull it up and read this action john 15 13. it says greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends ye are my friends if you do whatsoever i command you henceforth i call you not servants for a servant knoweth not what his lord doeth but i have called you friends for all things that i have heard of my father i have made known unto you so as god made known unto abraham his friend jesus made known to his disciples in this day god almighty held a book in his hand it was a sealed book the lamb opened the book brought it down to a seventh angel that seventh angel came before the pulpit said good morning friends and made known an open seventh seal book to us no longer seven seals but an open book we know all the mysteries of god because of his grace and his friendship and our friendship to him if you love him keep his commandments you are his friends so let's sing that little song together with a with a little revelation we are the friends of god who am i that you are mindful of me that you hear me when i call come on is it true is it true that you are thinking of me how you love me it's amazing so amazing oh i am a friend i am a friend of god [Music] i am a friend of god he called me friend say i am a friend of god i am a friend of god i am a
