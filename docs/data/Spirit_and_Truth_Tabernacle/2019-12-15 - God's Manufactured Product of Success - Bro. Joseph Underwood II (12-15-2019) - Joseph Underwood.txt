man we certainly thank the Lord for his presence here today he's been a good god - good god - it sounds just reflected this morning just all the great things that the Lord has done for us this year and and man God has proven himself ease yes showed up he has showed up and I'm here to a man restate that this has been the year of the incredible man this has been a year of incredible God my God made man in this morning we're so great for the Hat brother Joe I'm the with jr. and man with us man this precious wife sister Rebecca a man god bless you came into the office and say I got I got some surprise visitors for you today a surprise okay what praise the Lord and he told me brother ray insisted Bethenny came a man to be with us today so so good to see you all in the house of the Lord that's good I don't say I don't know what happiness is there's something on this side of the church is everybody drifted over here there's something over here that I'm missing I'm telling everybody drink [Music] oh you over their faces I just I just love the Lord amen but today I don't want to prolong the time I won't brother Joe just to come and I heard brother Solomon call sister Bethany to come singing and we certainly want her to do that but I know she probably needed brother Joe just to kind of tune it up for a little bit so a man hopeful she had a little time to think about what she wanted to do but a man as we just get ready to welcome him earlier this year brother Joe had come and supported some meetings that they drive roughly three and a half hours that come and I had come to support some meetings and and I was I said during those meetings I said brother before this year is out we gonna have you come and preach because I appreciate when ministers will support meetings when they're not reaching that said something to me when you go and you're not preaching you support and that mean a lot right so you know oftentimes it's very easy for ministers a man to to pull supportive who ain't preaching I ain't goin if I preach nine and I invite none of the people from my church so that lets the wrong spirit their own spirit right Amen so when I see when I see that and ministers are just something that draws me to that and I so I made a promise earlier early this year said brother we need to have you there was a time earlier this year we tried to get them and then some things changed if you had to go amen and preach for brother Westco and I think that all worked out just perfectly but God allowed it for him to come this time amen and I believe there's purpose a man for their being here at this time and we're under expectation for what the Lord has in store and so let's just let's welcome brother Joe hey man let's put our hands together let's welcome in this morning I would go into that but I'm not gonna I'm not gonna do that I want you to just come and I want you to take your liberty all right and sister Bethany he wants you to come at this time so y'all just be seated amen let's enjoy the presence of the Lord on this day hallelujah glory to God [Music] - wife sister Rebeka praise the Lord [Music] god bless you [Music] [Music] [Music] if you need somebody just to close your head and I'd like to recommend to and if you need somebody just walk by your side I like to the Lord he will be a father when your father is going I like to recommend and he will be a mother when you're feeling alone I like to recommend you Oh I like to recommend the Lord if you need somebody just impose your little head the Lord and if you need somebody just to walk right by your side I'd like to recommend [Music] and he will be a brother when your brother is gone I like to recommend to the laughs and he will be a sister we can feeling alone I like to me [Music] [Music] [Music] I like to recommend you to ah I like to like me [Music] [Applause] at least I might tell them I recognize Jesus god bless everybody this morning Amen if you got something going on in your life something bothering you this morning recommend Jesus he could do something about it he knows all the answers I've taken a lot of tests in school sometimes know the answers but he knows all the insolence and then I don't I don't know how to find my way all the time but he knows the way a medicine we just thank them this morning glad to be here brother Jack bring greetings from the family of God Tabernacle in Ocala Florida I'll continue to keep the church in prayer we we have our walls up there at the church [Applause] and we're just so thankful for the work that God is doing there he's growing the chirps bringing in people and people are being baptized coming to believe this message and we're just so happy we're happy to be here and man don't don't mind me if I seem a little tired I'm not tired I have a lot of thoughts in my mind so I'm thinking we've been now this would be the third week in a row that we've been away from home on the weekend so we I've been having to speak different places and different things so this Wednesday night it was nice to be back in Ocala okay and the church there gave us a nice warm greeting me and sister Rebecca celebrated our seven year anniversary last night and also my sister and her husband celebrated their anniversary as well I suppose uh some of yall already know brother a brother a sister Bethany I'll just stand up for those who maybe don't know you there she told me not to do that you know I can't I can't help it but I'm so grateful that they're with us me and my sister we we have a close bond I don't think people are always realized but brothers and sisters obviously we grew up together so we share a very close-knit bond and now this year I think through everything that she and I both have gone through this year it's brought us closer together and she called me she knew we were going out of town weeks in advance but she called me I believe Friday Friday night and she said I want to go and support you know you and your wife sister Rebecca and I said ok ok and I talked it now on Saturday morning because you know we got on the road early and she was in bed and she's like y'all go ahead we we tired I said now we're gonna give y'all a hour to get ready so they got on up and came with us and again we just thankful that here this morning so many things God has been good you know I can't complain about anything I think that complaining first of all nobody is listening so you can you can complain about your problems all you want but it's not really gonna do you very very good but you know sometimes when you think about all the things you've gone through and what God brings you to you can't help but smile you can't help but be happy and I'm trying to contain my excitement this morning but I'll share with you why in a little while but I remember coming to the meetings we came to a couple of meetings this year here in February we came here I don't know the thing I know it was about love oh thank you thank you musician I'm sorry a little unorthodox today about if February we came here FEMA on love I can't remember exactly what it was but brother Dewayne was here and I believe it was brother Nathan Ericson was here and we were here had a good time and that is when I heard the theme of this churches year being the year of the incredible man and my what a time we had in those meetings I actually was able to hear both ministers preach and I remember there at the end of the service I came up and asked brother Dewayne to pray for me to receive a refilling of the Holy Ghost and may you know there's nothing wrong with asking for a refill another doesn't matter how old you get how much you think you know because every day you need the Holy Ghost every single day you know I'm not too proud to admit I need the Holy Ghost not a fact I needed this morning Lord amen and so I came up and I prayed and you know maybe some people thought it strange but I'm glad I received when I came up looking to receive and we came back again and in June but a jacket mentioned to me that he was having another brother Nathan Brian okay having him come down for a special service and I was telling them I was planning on coming down to speak for my grandfather and I thought it was you know a good time I say you know what i'ma go ahead and call my grandfather thing and see if that would be okay and when we can attend brother Jack's meetings and so my grandfather actually said to me we'll see we'll see so we I got in town and then we there was a brother from Ghana who was here visiting preparing leading up to the meeting so I think that was June 23rd and leading up to the meetings so my grandfather you know we were we had just got in town and we were sitting in the car brother Jack and he was helping get into the hotel there and he said oh you know what brother I have you speak on Sunday morning I said well honey I ain't speaking this weekend we're just going to brother Jack so we're just going to brother Jack's Church and then we'll attend my grandfather's Church that morning and of course by the time Sunday morning came my grandfather had a different leading so I did end up speaking at short notice I think you woke me up at 5 o'clock to let me know but while we were here and in the service here brother Nathan Bryant wonderful man of God hey man I begin to just kind of reminisce on some of the things that brother Jack had been telling me now I know y'all hear this noise I'm not gonna pretend like it's not there but we bout to make some noise in the brother brother Nathan he was telling me some testimonies and I believe brother Jack was telling me the testimony about sister time sister time you hear this morning okay then god bless your sister you get the scene this morning but brother trunk I saw you this morning so I you know he began to tell me this and man something begin to happen to me sister Rebekah couldn't make it wait no she made it this time she was able to make it she we were able to get her homework and stuff taking care of it something was just burning in me brother Jack it was burning heavy on me and I couldn't help myself he asked me to come up and sing a special something y'all were here and I just had to tell what I came to the service believe in the Lord for him I was believing God to bless us with a child and you know as soon as I did that now some of y'all sisters talking brother the Solomon yesterday and sister and Naomi and when I did that of course my wife wanted to shut down she ever me and she saw which she hadn't have done everybody and I gotta tell you outside of the church I recently told this to my sister I took some time away from the church there and you know Lord just kind of dealt with me on some things that I needed to deal with in my life and I came to realize something true y'all don't tell me nothing don't tell me nothing if you don't want me to tell nobody you don't want me to tell nobody don't tell me because if I feel if I got faith to believe God was on I'm gonna tell somebody you know I'm not ashamed you know I know some people you know I was reading a quote I'm not gonna pull it up just yet but I was reading a quote brother Branham he was in the service and he was saying how you know when you want God to do something for you got to respond quickly you know cuz he he he was talking about the sister named sister of Virginia and he was in the service and he said I'm he said he had his back turned and he was talking he said just like when the Lord came there in the tent with Abraham God had his back turned yeah but he could discern what was going on with Sarah that she was laughing and so brother Brennan turns his back and he said the same angel who was there in the tent is here now I'm gonna tell you something when I walk up to this pulpit I feel that way this morning the same angel who was in that tent is here this morning and I was reading a brother Brennan he turned his back and he said you sister over there in the corner he had his back turner and he said your name is a sister Virginia he said you have such an such condition he said do you believe God makes you well he said well then you receive it right now in the name of Jesus and then he said you mr. Anderson he said do you believe it he said Miss Emma saying you didn't respond quick enough so I moved away from you to the next person I hope we don't have any menaces I hope we're all sister Virginia no pun intended [Music] because that's our self on that night that I was here when I heard I heard enough testimony listen we didn't I did not need to hear brother Nathan speak I just needed to know what type of service it was gonna be and when I knew that I responded quickly I said listen soon as I get the mic I don't care what nobody think it's some time you got to come to church like that because if you try to be mr. Anderson be quiet keep it to yourself I don't want you're not gonna get it that way I don't want my name called you're not gonna hit it that way sometimes when God is moving you gotta jump in the pool listen you got if you don't move quick enough somebody jump in the pool for you there's somebody sitting beside you who I like winning I like winning when I was young I'm sorry I gotta take this Connelly lean into the message this morning when I was a kid I remember playing football I remember I played for a team brother Jack that was just losing every game and how was the running back and I hate losing I learned to hate losing while I played for that team and I remember they got to a point that the players just weren't motivated to play football no more and so the coach will only give me the ball every play the defense knew I was getting involved you know there's an unfair disadvantage because you know they they were just line up wherever they thought I was coming and I gotta tell you on something the devil he's lining up that's why he's got this music behind me and all this stuff going on he is trying to set up an unfair disadvantage because he know that there's somebody in this room who want to win I said that somebody in this room this morning who wants to win and somebody in this room is tired of losing they are determined to win I look at my folks when I was little blood I said coach I don't care if they all go here yeah I said I don't care if the team lose I said I'm gonna pack my stats if you listen to what I'm saying sure I said I'm gonna pack my sets you need the ball listen even though we lost I walked away with touchdown touchdown and listen I'm not trying to you know come off like I'm not a team player but this is not a group affair that we have in this morning if you don't want to win move out the way I kind of had my stats I've come to get my testimony and I will never forget I did not go out with the team to the bunch after the game because it was sad I know my dad took me and we celebrated what I did is I was gone I scored touchdown I scored three touchdowns scored I scored now for some people y'all thinking whoever Lajoie he's selfish I'm gonna tell you something when you get your blessing you'll owe me something [Applause] you're gonna get up and you're gonna tell it to so I'm gonna tell it I feel like telling it this morning but I want to share something with you all I wanna share survive that's all right y'all not tired are you I'm not tired get a lot of rest now during the week and so I get I'm energetic on the weekends and sometimes my wife gotta calm me down so I think it will be okay this morning but I want to share something with y'all brother Jack and that service there in June we came to the prayer line and you know we were already suffering some embarrassment there it felt like at least some but we pray with an eighth afraid over us and I don't know if you remember brother Jack Burke but the Nathan he said you know I believe that by this time next year you all will have children he said brother Jack when the child is born sending pictures of the baby so you got to make sure you do that [Applause] [Music] all right we left out of that service and when he said that you know my intellectual mind went into action and I wanted to tell each and every person here this morning when you ask God for something I actually said this one time I was preaching here don't expect God to give it to you the way that you asked for word because you don't ask God for a table when you give me a table God you ask God for a table he give you a tree [Applause] don't some people a they ask God for the see God had to deal with me on this brother Jack deeply God said to me so further to you know you're not a Christian this this kind of threw me hear what I'm saying this morning church he said Joe the pagans and the Bible the pagans identify them as Christians and that's where the phrase was corn christ-like and you continue to read the Bible you'll actually find that Jesus doesn't refer to us as Christians he calls us his sons and daughters source relational is not religious it's relationship and so he said Joe you're not just a Christian you know in the world they look at me they see Christian but he said Joe I'm your daddy you see daddy daddies are protective that is you know daddies would do anything for the truth now this is tough because when you think about there's some people who don't get to have their father figure present in their life but God he's a good father and I tell you something I begin to just think about daddy for a moment and I started to said man my dad you know if there was ever anything that was going on with me my dad would make sure that I was okay you know he'll be there you know maybe he wasn't there the way I would have liked because the parent knows what's best for the child so I begin to think about how a father should be towards his child and I begin to think about Adam and Eve in the garden and how God was a father to them and as I just begin thinking these thoughts in and going deep until he stopped God said to me he said son I want to give you what you want more than you want it he said well I'm your daddy so you got to ask me like I'm your daddy see some people pray to God like a Christian but they don't pray to God like he's their daddy man so you're praying you'll say God I need a new car listen there's another place in the Bible where God calls you an ambassador do you know ambassadors when they come to this country that they don't need a new car the country that they came from gives them the car already those are called additions those things come with the job we prank God give me a large house God give me a new car God give me that and God is saying listen that comes with the job why would I not give you that I'm your daddy I know you need that I'm going to give that to you so I had to change my looks I'm gonna tell you something it may be a little disappointing but when I came out that service brother Jack and I heard him say that I immediately thought god there's no way we're gonna have a baby that by this time next week because my thought process was take my monster bait there's 12 months in a year that mean I got three months to get this thing together and I was like man God I mean I need to be doing this going to the doctor doing this and talking to this person taking these supplements come on somebody and that's when God said to me I'm your daddy he said you gotta ask me like that so this is what I did I had been in communication with Bill Jack and I began to pray differently I I stopped asking God for a child and I say God let your kingdom come in my life and let your will be done that's how Jesus taught the disciples how to pray thy kingdom come thy will be done and then I said God help me to make my life match your word so that I can be raised when the addition coming because there's some people ask God for a car but they're not ready for the car you asking God for some people asking God for a house but you're not ready for a house you still in the apartment fees you ain't ready for a house yet you don't know how to you know why would God give you great responsibility you can't manage the small responsibility sees God in front of you so I started asking God I said God you give me the baptism of the Holy Ghost I get up and pray and I'd be crying out for the baptism of the Holy Ghost so I realized I'm not perfect and I realized that without the Holy Ghost or nothing so I would pray for this every single day even now still I keep that get up in the morning I pray like I don't have nothing and that god I need you to do everything for me I pretty like a desperate man and so I just was praying and praying and brother Jack and I we were keeping in communication I'll tell you y'all got a good pastor man I can come to the jacket almost any time of the day and as long as he's not out of the country he's calling back within an hour or he's answer right away I'm serious I actually tried 1 to 5 phone records to prove it God said this is impossible nobody can be it their phone like this all the time sometime I'm planning the voice message I'm about to leave but he still answers the phone and I'm like man forget the voice message let's talk and but I was talking with him and brother Jack him and I had to come top-1 one month in August and he said brother I want you to come and preach that was going to be the weekend of September 22nd and I was preparing to preach and right I was on my way here something came up and my grandfather needed me to preach at his church and this is what I didn't tell you that I thought I'd tell you the day really Zach so I got up and I preached and when I was done I sat down and I just stayed up on the pulpit for a moment and my grandfather called the ushers to come and to dismiss and when he did that the ushers came and then he told everybody wait a minute wait a minute he said everybody sit down and he said Joseph sister Rebecca y'all coming in he said I feel it pray for y'all right now so I said okay so I went I came up front and he said in the microphone he said church he said I'm believing for these two he said something just came on my heart it's on believin these two I want y'all to pray with me that God will give him a child right now he said before he said listen I know they've been pray for before he said but he's I just heard the Holy Spirit drop him me right now I'm soul sister Becca and she remembers we came up and we were prayed over and I brother Jack I got to tell you something sat different with me because I never seen brother let's go do this in the service before and after that I want to say about a week and a half later on October 3rd I got back home my wife was involved in a severe car accident she was hitting on her driver's side door and I was actually on the phone with her when it happened and my heart sank into my stomach I was so far away from home I didn't know what to do and she wasn't responding while I was on the phone and you know I started thinking about you know I lost my wife you know and so my heart was found I call my mom called my dad they were able to get there they were actually my mother was in the neighborhood where the car accident occurred and brother Jack I have pictures those you're who I want to see after the service I don't want to take up time showing that that this morning but she went on in between a stop sign a speed limit sign in the sewage drain and the car had just enough width to fit through there and then she stopped about less than five feet from somebody's front door in their yard and when I got to the scene and seen I said ain't no way I said that that was ordained by God that amount of space to happen that way and the fact that she got out the car and was able to walk we rushed we got over to the hospital and they asked us you know are you pregnant that's one of the first things that's what you know we've been tedious about these things no as far as we knew we were not pregnant and so of course they did their tests to make sure and they said nobody not pregnant they did the MRIs took the x-rays and after all that she was we went to an attorney's office they got us in touch with a chiropractor she has to see the chiropractor three times a week she's still seeing the chiropractor and they were doing these they called Tenzing electric shocks and things and because they thought you know we we're not pregnant the tests are showing negative but my wife sister Rebecca she woke me up on Friday October 25th and the way she woke me up I thought that something bad happened I really I did and she woke me up and I was in a panic she said so we're pregnant when she took the test I said let's take you some more times because I know what the doctor said in the hospital ain't no way I said come on we pregnant I brought that friend I was full of emotion because I was trying to figure it I said how can we go from not being pregnant to just all of a sudden being pregnant I don't know where when all this stuff that's going on so we went on our anniversary trip because that was coming up and before we went sister Rebecca lost her passport yes I said it I'm sorry I'll have to deal with that later she lost it a week before we were to fly out so we had to come to Miami and we drove through here and say what brother Westco in Miami got her passport we were driving back home we were passing Palm Beach actually right by the church and for the Westco called me Joseph I could just picture him kind of scratching he said listen this a couple years ago I had giving y'all some instructions to younger people careful how you interpret it don't get a hotel lock yourself in that get rid of the phones and the TV and don't come out until you have a baby yes I'll do that I said yeah we've done that a couple of times she said I want you to do it again I said grande he said keep doing it so I said all right I said all right he said I don't know he said I so I don't know what I did he said something made me call you and tell you this now we did not know we were pregnant at this time this was the Wednesday before the Friday Rebecca woke me up that he called and so when she woke me up that Friday I said granddaddy just called us two days ago and he said something made him call us and we didn't even know what that something was I believe that that's when life was taking place we were told before that no no no no no so they're not of course i'm bugling cuz you know you try not to you try to be calm because you know there's certain things you gotta make sure things are okay man i Rebecca let me call but Jack and the car brothers Jack I said just let me talk to him hey just wait I said well let me talk to my granddaddy let me talk wait how like we I said you know my favorite verse description but guys they're you know they that wait upon the Lord and they I am being impatient I'm like hey come on I said listen I said if it's there I'm certain that everything's gonna be fine she she said just wait alright I waited I waited I passed my test it was a test I finally I caught up with a jack and I shared the good news with brother Jack and we just we've been so excited our family there's been overwhelming emotions um because we were told certain things by doctors about how we possibly could not have had kids and so it doesn't really matter what the doctor says at this point because when and if some of y'all don't take this the wrong way but when Jesus say yes nobody can say no is that so if God says I'm gonna give it to you I don't care if everybody else say ain't no way we gonna get in the way we allow it to happen God say you gonna give it to you he's gonna give it to you rest assured now I went two weeks ago and preached for brother Wesco again we share our testimony there and at the end of the service sister Gabriella I don't know how many of y'all know her she's just graduated from very University with her master's degree and she was there and she was in the service that brother Wes Co I had everybody sit down so that he can pray for us and when I was telling a testimony at that time two weeks ago we were 10 weeks and three days pregnant sister Rebecca was I'm not pregnant how I get picked on because I look like I'm gaining weight but I reviewed and I'm Catherine huh huh she came to me and she said brother Joe when you said that she said something dropped in my spirit and the Lord told me to open my calendar and go back to when you were here the last time and she said I counted week to week to week and she said brother Joe that's the exact amount of time you've been pregnant says brother what's go pray for you she said brother Joe says I I believe that you actually conceived the moment after that prayer and when when I thought about it I said whoa I didn't even count all the way to the date all the way to the day and I this is what I told him back I said sir I appreciate you know that I said but I look at it like this God was testing our faith in February when we came to these meetings in June when we came here I I wasn't scared I wasn't ashamed my faith was put on the line even here and God needed to know right before I give this to you are you ready for this this morning that's kind of what my sermons gonna be about it I'm not gonna keep you longer I just kept you long enough in this testimony but when you ask God for something there's a timeline Abraham and Sarah wait a long time but the bottom line is they were patient and out of I'm sorry Abraham he he didn't stagger he stayed with the test no when he first heard the news he laughed you know like I like what I did when I was here I heard news oh my god - three I only got three months I figured out but that's not what's important what's important is being patient and being faithful to God stand with God's Word until the promise comes to pass and sometimes that's tough that's hard sometimes you got to cry there's many nights I watched my wife cry I several months I didn't know what I was gonna do but God gave us the strength and the courage keep believing keep believing only believe only believe am i my little sister she's a witness other stuff that we went through so only believe Church don't doubt just believe God can do anything if God can give Mary a child without a man even touching her and there's nothing impossible for God I don't care the doctors Ida told us that we couldn't have kids at all if God could give Mary a child without a man touching her I mean that that's the whole foundation of our faith today our faith can you believe that you are here because you believe that story that's why you're here brother if you don't believe that story you're not here your whole entire faith come on man [Music] so if I got the faith to believe God in that Denari nothing to offer got this man how many believe in God for something listen now I know this is the year of the incredible this year is not over there's still time on the clock somebody's about the experiencing credit if you have an experience together avoid the fourth quarter but I've seen some great comebacks in the fourth quarter it might be overtime for somebody in this search but I've seen some great comebacks and over time I've seen teams when that shouldn't even be winning and I come to tell you this morning that fourth quarter is your quarter fourth quarter is your quarter I'm a fourth quarter believer Satan you may beat me the first three quarters but by the time we enter the fourth quarter I will be ready I will not lay on my back I'm not gonna quit and I watch boxes getting beat up fewer recently just getting beat and beat and beat and the coach he got the white flag ready to throw it in and he getting beat and beat watching some classes and right before the coach through the flat the tower win all of a sudden one two hit that's all it takes that's all it takes you don't got to beat them bad it just takes one good hit you don't got to win the whole game you just got a hit on one time and I promise you you will win God believe that this morning so I thank God my wife and I we don't know if it's a boy or a girl yet but we are having our first time I didn't say we're having our child I said we're having our first shot [Applause] because if we did it this time he's got to do it again this is our second song he'll do it again for you do it again hey man I know what I asked God for and I won't stop until I get it I won't stop til I get it hey man so I ain't gonna keep you much longer extend our feet if you don't mind before we open our Bibles grab your Bibles with me before we open I want you to look at somebody tell them it is my time look at somebody else tell them it is my time it is my time maybe it wasn't your time before the service but it is not your time this is your time the word that you were here it's not about me this is God's word to you it's your time this morning let's open our Bibles this morning to the Book of Jeremiah chapter 29 and verse 11 and when you have it let's say Amen and I'm actually going to just read two areas in the scripture and then let you have your seats but it says for I know I'm glad he knows [Music] the thoughts that I think toward you says the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you and expect it in it and let's also turn to the book of Proverbs proverbs chapter 3 and verse 1 and we'll only have it let's just say man this morning my son forget not my law but let thine heart keep my Commandments for length of days and long life and peace shall they add to thee let not mercy and truth forsake be bind them about the neck write them upon the table of that heart so shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man and you all know this one trust in the Lord with all that heart and lean not unto thine own understanding amen let's pray this morning father that's who you are your father God you are our Lord and Savior now we ask this morning the to come now God and speak your thoughts to your people Lord God made the word that goes forth this morning God let it not just be something we shout about God may come and become a reality to each and every person here this morning that we have passed the days of just shouting services now we're here to see the manifestation of your power your glory may manifest in our lives God we pray this morning God for those who have different needs now you know everything but more importantly you know the thoughts that you have towards us to give us and expect it in thoughts of peace and not of evil God you already have the end written out for us god help us Lord God to continue to trust in you and lean not to our own understanding God only to believe and trust in you Lord God you know our things you know everybody who's here this morning you are dating for them to be in the seat that they're sitting in this morning it's not just by chance God but you know all things God are praying every heart this year Lord God if they have to repent Lord that they would repent turn their hearts towards you this morning so that that's the word is going forth they can be free to receive what you have to give God me behind your cross but may you speak your words through me to your people once again we pray we ask it in Jesus name Amen and amen you can be seated this morning this morning I would like to use a thought God's manufactured product of success hey man God's manufactured product of success I want to say something this morning you are not a mistake every person that is born is born to fulfill a mission a mission is an important assignment that means that if you exist and if you're breathing this morning that God he needed you to fulfill an assignment a lot of times we go through life and we're floating through life trying to figure out God why am I here well what's my purpose for being here especially when things are kind of negative or it seems negatively you're like God why why didn't you put me here God said I put you here because I had a problem in order for there to be a mission in order for there to have been an assignment they had to have been a problem and God birthed you to solve the problem so you are not a mistake but the venom says now there's something that's wrong so he identifies that there is a problem he says and in the beginning God has created you to be the master of every circumstance that's the origin it's authentic that's God's word there was nothing nothing could happen unless you was the master of it that's what you were created for so everybody who's here this morning you will create it to master a problem oh that makes you that should make you feel different I don't feel like the biggest person in the room this morning but I feel like a master because there are situations that are going to come your way but you must understand that God created you to master those situations your problem is not my problem because I am not the master of your situation I'm not the master of your tense some of you all may be struggling with a test that is harder than my test maybe you feel like your problem is harder than mine and I come to tell you something this morning it is but your problem is not my problem and if I had to overcome your test I will fail if you have to overcome my test you will fail because you are not created to master my circumstance you were created to master your circumstance there are some people who will spend more time trying to solve other people's problems we got so many teachers therapists doctors trying to solve people's problems but I've come to tell you something this morning there's only one person who is created and designed to master the problem that is you you can either choose to believe it or you can choose to disbelieve it but if you choose to believe that you are the master then you have spoken word authority in you this morning Jesus on the boat with the disciples sight was going to say master you notice they didn't call him Jesus because they realized that this problem was not their problem Jesus told them let us go to the other side so if there is a problem that prevents us from going to the other side it is not the disciples problem so the disciples they go to Jesus and the first thing they say they say master a lot of people they take that to say you know what the disciples were just scary cats but I think that the disciples also had a little bit of revelation they said master do you care if we die now if they call him master there's got to be a master that responds Peter could not respond John could not respond to master James could not respond to master only the master could respond to the question that was being asked so Jesus he wakes up and he looks at them and he says o ye of little faith and the reason he says they have little faith is because they came to him doubting the situation that they would not be able to go to the other side because of the circumstance but they understood the circumstance was not their problem all they needed to do was our faith there are some people that are more concerned with what's going on in their life than the amount of faith that they have because they're comparing their situation to other people you say well this person has that so I should have that this person is doing that so I should be doing that and I come in I couldn't be transparent I used to do the same thing so maybe that's about a couple of months ago I used to say oh man that person is successful and I'm still over here doing this God said to me he said what is success success is not measured based upon what other people have and what you don't have success is how you are able to complete the mission that God gave to you I think God wanted something to fly so what did he do he created Birds God wanted something to swim so what did he do he didn't make you brother Solomon I don't know you might be an old case swimmer but that's not your purpose so brother if we put you in water and let you stay there under the water long enough you'll stop swimming because that is not your purpose but when God wanted someone to swim he created a fish and that fish its purpose is to swim that's why if you take that fish out of his element long enough and it can't fulfill its purpose it will die when you do not fulfill your purpose God will take your life I was reading a place where brother brandon was talking about this minister who was preaching and all of a sudden he said it seemed like the minister had backslidden and begin to go to the bars and things of that nature you all know what I'm talking about you study your message he said then something happened he lost his life and he thought god no that man was a minister God so for the relevee said I would rather take your life before you ruin it because you're trying to run away from your purpose I went in the scripture I looked at Jonah Jonah tried to run away from his purpose he was created for a purpose and that was to deliver a message and Jonah tried to run in the opposite direction from the message he was called to deliver and when he did that God had to come get him because he's too far out of his element and if he had a stayed out of his element for too long it would have cost him his life so God sometimes we look at situations and we say God why are you doing this to me anybody ever asked that question God why am i suffering with this condition God why am I going through this problem everybody else seems to be doing just fine but God you got this happening to me God saying because I created you with purpose there's a purpose in your suffering there's a purpose in your tests I recently defiled out something that I'm still studying but I think I'll share it with you if y'all don't mind this morning I recently discovered that God needs me to be successful I want to say something to you this morning God needs you oh man look at the person besides you really quit even if it's a little kid just look at them you might think they're just any old person you've been seeing these st. people Sunday after Sunday but the person you just looked at God needs them to be successful even you he needs you to be successful the reason God needs us to be successful is because success is built into the creation by every manufacturer I want to use a type here success is important to every manufacturer this morning I have my iPad up here some of y'all may have iPad or however you use devices or take notes but there's an image on this iPad some of y'all are familiar with it looks like a Apple has been bitten and that image is the image of the company now before that image is put on the device the company had to test that iPad before it left the factory now they had to make sure that everything necessary for that iPad success was built into that iPad the prophet of God said in 1962 perseverant he said that every Sun every child that comes to God has got to be tested that's a cool if you don't want to be tested you have permission to leave right now because if you say god I just want to be blessed but I don't want to be tested you're in the wrong place God is not in that business this morning God does not create prototypes on me all of God's prototypes must be tested so he says that every child that comes to God has got to be tested God will move down in a meeting and show great signs and wonders but you've got to be tested to see if you really believe it or not so we say you know I'm looking for God to do the incredible god I want I need incredible blessings in my life God I need an incredible next level move in my life well I Got News for you the more incredible you are looking for the greater the tests that you're asking for oh man I gave me the chills this morning because I think I've been married for seven years and never ever tried not to have kids but God said you want something incredible I got to create an incredible circumstance some people want God to bless them way up here but you don't want your tests way up there God is not in that kind of business so after the product is tested on who puts the iPad in a box then they put something very important inside of that box they cover it with a book so you can't see it the manufacturer hides the product underneath the book but it's for a reason yeah now the book is called the manual now I want to ask a quick question right here I'm not trying to pick on anybody how many of you all read that manual before you turn your device on raising hands don't lie cuz we're gonna find out the truth later the whole thing you read the whole manual for you take nobody right nobody don't worry I don't either so we're all in the same boat together I'll be honest with you I think that I know more about the product then they know sometimes I turn it on and start getting to work and then have you ever turned on that iPad you're working with all of a sudden you discovered a feature that you didn't know about and you're like oh now you go and tell somebody iPad got this on it but it's only a surprise to you it's not a surprise to the manufacturer because the manufacturer put that in the manual if you hadn't read the manual you would have known about the features you would have known about the promises you would have known about the product but you put this to the side because you wanted this and there's some people that do that with the message they say I don't need that book I don't need that sermon I don't need that quote we don't need any quotes I just need the product but how can you know anything about the product without the revelation of the manual now the word may was broken up into two parts you have menu and one menu means to make or to create wall means to think so manual simply means the makers mind so the manual in the box is the makers mind on paper this is what God says I know the thoughts anybody want to know the thoughts the only way to know the thoughts is to have to make his mind on paper when you open a box you don't see the iPad you see the manual you see the makers mind on paper the manual always says before opening this product please read it says it it tells you what to do before you turn it on how many people do what it says and no we don't we don't just this but it happens in our spirits of walk god says before you go to bed read this before you go to work play this with God I got to get to work I'm running late this morning and then we say oh but God I want you to do and God is not a sugar daddy God does not move when you say move God moves when he feels like moving and he's so smarter about how he moves because God he will wait sometimes until you end up in a situation similar to prison but so that he can get your attention I don't know why I'm saying this but God has a way of locking people up into sitting their situation where you can't go left you can't go right anybody felt like they couldn't go to their friends because the friends can't help them anybody ever thought I can't go to my family because in this situation family can't help me everybody anybody ever felt like I can't go to mama because mama can't help me I can't go to that God will lock you up some time just to get you to read the man everybody okay this morning alright y'all with me y'all with me now we don't read the book we don't read the book we don't know the mind of the manufacturer concerning the product Psalm chapter 139 and verse 17 and 18 it says how precious also are that thoughts unto me O God how great is the sum of them if I should count them they are more number than the sin when I awake I'm still with thee did you know that you're always on God's mind you can keep that up there did you know you're always on God's mind but how would you know this if you don't read the manual he is always thinking about you when I first started dating sister Rebecca I remember I could not get her out of my mind no matter what I was doing I was always thinking about the next time I would pick up the phone or the next time I would see sister Rebecca I was always saying as so much so that when my phone would ring I would actually answer because sometimes and if everybody in this church will be honest sometimes their phone rings but if it's not who they want to talk to they don't answer in that moment I'm not trying to talk bad about you but you might be in the middle of something or whatever like that and you see the phone ring and it says brother Smith Eli yeah I don't really feel like talking to brother Smith today so you don't answer the phone but I remember every time I saw Rebecca Allison pop up on my phone I was scramble I was running if I was in a room if I was at work whatever I was doing I go run out the back and go trying to answer that phone and do you know that God does that every time you call every time you call he ain't just looking at it and ignoring it God is not like as we think is we think that he's not answering because we did not get the answer we were looking for in that moment but God did give you an answer you just have to open the manual he said I giving you all the answers to every circumstance but just because you don't see something in front of you does not mean I did not give you the answer so you got to read the man I hope I'm encouraging you to open your Bibles this morning I hope I'm encouraging you to open those message books because you can't have one without the other because you got a manual other manual help us God you can't stop thinking about you because he you are his product and God is in love with you when you in love what a person that shows you just can't there's something in you just can't stop loving that person I you know I've had the opportunity to switch jobs here recently and I get a lot more free time and no matter how many homes are going to or how many people that I meet every time I am done I'm always thinking about sister Rebecca sister Rebeka sister Rebecca now I'm thinking about sister Rebecca and our child but I'm always thinking about sister Rebecca so much so that I have been embarrassing sister Rebecca here recently I pop up to her job flowers and food all the time she probably wishes I had a real full-time job but I'm always popping up and I'll tell the girl at the front desk not she knows you know we got this thing down now when I first came to have to be like I need you to call Ben you want me to tell her you're here I'm like no no don't tell her I'm here I'd be hiding behind the wall so this last time I came in there bring Zach and I had some watermelon and some roses and I walked in there she was like okay I'm not gonna tell you I'm not gonna tell you here so Rebecca comes out and of course oh my god you keep coming around I'm told I said I can't help it cuz I can't stop thinking about you because I love you that's how God feels about you Church God loves you somebody needs to hear that this morning God loves you and actually he loves you more than that he just got arenas menu and find out when you go to sleep David said he's still thinking about you when you wake up David said he's still thinking about you that's something but we don't read the book we don't know the mind of a manufacturer concerning his product the book is simply a book of promises and laws that's what this is promises and laws promises and laws promises and law when you take the manual out the first thing you'll see when you open it is a photograph of the product if the photograph of the product does not match what's in the box you have the wrong product sisters brothers if your image does not match this image it's the wrong product there's a defect in the product the product then must be sent back to the manufacturer so you'll see some promises if you keep looking in it the product will perform like this the product is guaranteed to do this that's what you see when you open it and they have a long list of promises but when you get to the next page then it says follow these instructions in other words obey these laws now I didn't know all this because I threw away my iPad menu on the first iPad I got when I got the next iPad there were things that I saw in the manual that I didn't even know about the iPad now after this service I know everybody from now on when you get a product I already know something y'all gonna say brother Joe you read the manual there are some things that you just don't know like I did not know that if you press the power button five times there SOS y'all knew that right but somebody told you that you didn't know it on your own don't do that to me don't do that to me everybody you're late you should've read the main you didn't know that unless somebody told you because you didn't read the manual right you're not better than me I know how it works I did not know that if you press the home button and the lock button at the same time add new screen so did you know that you knew that somebody told you right you read you accidentally came across hey that's okay as long as as long as you figure it out and then you know we'll work with that but you wouldn't had to either figure it out if you haven't just read the manual so these are there's instructions it tells you first I was looking at the instruct do not operate near open heat Jean oh that was in the manual do not operate in there open heat you take it out to that campfire meeting that you guys are having you pull your iPad out it tells you not to do that that's it in there do not operate under water did y'all know that yeah some of y'all said Joe that was common sense do not operate on the water I like this next one do not attempt to fix it yourself [Applause] you know how many times I've tried that one it's my screen you're stuck or button gets jammed I'm like and I'm gonna take this thing apart I'm gonna figure this thing out I'm gonna do that do not attempt to fix it yourself so you got some laws that tell you what not to do then the next page tells you what to do it tells you how to make sure that this product succeeds and then you get you know to the last few pages and you'll see something really strange that we're going to talk about but before that when it tells you how to use this product to make it succeed what it's telling you is it's telling you how to use the product in such a way I know this isn't business school which I'll bear with me it's telling you how to use the product in such a way that it successfully fulfills your mission now there's things that when you use it outside of these parameters that there's a possibility that the product is going to deteriorate anybody ever had something and then you had it for like two three years and then something's just not working with it and now you're like I'm gonna go toss it now and get up and get something else well my house I'm kind of picked on about this Bethany and probably tell y'all after surgery but I'm very meticulous I don't like people to touch my stuff I will buy you your own drink I will get you your own food I will get you your own iPhone your own iPad you cannot share my stuff because I use my stuff in such a way that it successfully fulfills the mission that I need it's like the computers at home you gotta be careful not to let your kids on it because then I do let your kids on it for too long what happened viruses malware and you know it can't be you because when you use it the only thing you do is go to the voice of God recording a website you go to Bible gateway com do your homework and go to bed there's no way there's no way that this virus was put here about you so when somebody else comes along and uses it differently for a different mission then all of a sudden you ever try to give people advice that work for you oh man I have I have people do this to me and I've done it to them and yet most cases it works a little bit but it never completely works the way it's playing you know why because there are no two situations exactly the same well when I was doing this we did this and this helped me that might work for you but I am NOT you so I can't necessarily I can heed your advice but I may not be able to use your advice to successfully complete this mission make sense let's say what I'm saying I hope y'all can understand that yeah so now and I'm going on I'm not being ready to be much longer I'm actually coming to a close this next part is kind of strange in these last few pages it gives you a warranty you all are familiar with warranty gives you a warranty and a guarantee the manufacturer guarantees that the product will perform exactly how they promised but then it gives you a warranty the warranty says if you obey the laws that are in this manual then we guarantee that this product is under warranty which means that they will personally protect it brother Branham says 1962 convinced and concerned he says and God has got to keep his word to us so we must obey his word and when we obey his word and see him then vindicate what he said he would do then were convinced right that the word is right so when we obey God's Word then God is able to keep his word to us you can't ask God for something if you're not willing to obey Him when Eve ate from the tree of good and evil I'm sure he was sorry I'm sure she was sorry certainly he was sorry because she knew that she was taught not to do it right so she was sorry right but God has to keep his guarantees God said if you eat of this tree this is the consequence that will follow that some people want to eat from the tree but don't want the guarantee if you want God's blessings in your life you must be obedient to his word I heard I was at the barber shop I wonder barber said to me he said man I believe in God to open up the windows of heaven and pour me out blessings that I won't have room enough to receive so I said do you go to church it's an honor to I said do you do pay times he said not to do that I said with that burst on don't apply to you he shall so I told Rebecca about this story I said look listen man I said you can't say you won't got to do this when this has conditions to it that you don't want to meet I said before we even get to this what you must be doing is bringing all of the tithes and offering and to God storehouse now this particular scripture is very very interesting because while it yet gives you a promise it also tells you that if you don't do it see cuz people don't want they don't want to talk about that don't bring that up just talk about the blessings that's falling out of the the windows of heaven but if you don't do it then you robbing God now there's some people who are comfortable being a thief there are some people comfortable being a thief because they feel like they have not been caught so because I've not been caught now I'm comfortable well there's a couple that tried that it costed them the whole family they thought I'm a brain some stuff into God's storehouse but I'm not gonna bring all the times and the offering I'm gonna bring part of my times in our fam you know what's funny about that is that that we think that we're getting away with something when we're not cuz God will send somebody who can discern because God is the discerner of the thoughts and the intentions of the heart so he'll send somebody who can discern that and you're saying this is my year of incredible and God is saying that does not apply to you like John over there first John will tell you to go back to your first love in other words return this product back to the manufacturer because it has a defect if the manufacturer said that if you operate the product under water it may cause fatal injury do not operate the product under water oh but I tried it I use it under water and nothing happened to me you think that because you got away with something that it was okay but the longer you play with fire eventually you will get murdered it's better to obey than the sacrifice in this in this portion of the warranties and the guarantees a man who says if there is any defect in this product do not attempt to fix it yourself then it says submit it only to an authorized dealer authorized dealer you know there's a lot of dealers a lot of preachers preachers a lot of teachers teachers but they've not been authorized to handle or repair the product there's some people who will go to who they think is their favorite preacher or their favorite teachers for an answer to their problem but that preacher or teacher is not authorized to handle that product this is God's manufactured product what am I talking about I'm talking about you you are a special design nobody can just handle you any kind of way you require a special anointing because you're an eagle you require special food you require a special diet you cannot just eat anything you cannot just listen to anything you cannot just sit under any church you cannot just be in any place you cannot just work any job say that again you cannot work just any job there are some job sisters that will say you have to wear pants but you cannot just work any job because you are a special creation there are some people who don't realize how special they are Bible says you are beautifully and wonderfully made and fearfully made on top of that do you know that when the Bible says that you are an ambassador do you all know what an ambassador is an ambassador comes from a foreign country we were in Canada we were in Montreal going downtown Montreal brother Jack we were riding in an area of my brother-in-law he said I'm going to take you to Thailand today I said you're gonna take me to Thailand it's all know about that where I did I was gonna get the talent in this car in Canada and he drove he took me to Thailand he took me to Africa he took me to Brazil he took me to the United States in less than ten minutes because in Montreal there are these places called embassies and an ambassador before he goes or she goes into another country that country that they're representing will buy land in the country that they're about to sing that ambassador - and they buy that land and that land listen now belongs to the country that bought it it doesn't matter the location it belongs to that country so if you are a prisoner in Canada but you are from Nigeria and the Canadian government was after you but you made your way to the Nigerian embassy on that property do you know that the Canadian government cannot come on their embassy to arrest you they would have to write a special letter and turn it in to the embassy requesting that the embassy releases you because that is not their property wait a minute brother Joey you stay in the property that's in Montreal with a Nigerian flag is that that embassy does not belong to Montreal that's exactly what I said it's called asylum so it doesn't belong there so what happens they send the Ambassador before y'all all right they send the Ambassador into that country now the Ambassador comes and you know where they do all their business at the Embassy all right because this is a safe place it's the embassy now as an ambassador the Ambassador is a representative of the country that they came from so whatever they say it goes for the country that they came from whatever they say yeah do you know that you're an ambassador you are not from here you come from the mind of God God sent you here as an ambassador yeah but watch this you didn't just put you in West Palm Beach and call West Palm Beach your embassy the whole earth is your embassy he said I will give you dominion over the birds of the air the files are there Kerala filled every creeping thing you are an ambassador of the entire earth this is your kingdom I got surprise for everybody in the room heaven is not God's goal for you heaven is not God's goal for you restoration we look at the word restoration restoration means to restore back to its original position when it man fall from heaven or earth he fell from the earth Adam Satan fell from heaven man Adam you fell here in the earth so that's why when you read in the book of Revelation the earth is redeemed by fire you're coming back here heaven is not God's goal for you he wants you to have dominion over this this is your kingdom you are an ambassador here you are not a visitor I say it again you are not a visitor whatever you say here goes you have more power here than the angels in heaven Robert I said who has more power a son of God or an angel who has more power a son of God or an angel you have so much heart listen the Bible does not make a mistake and call you an ambassador instead of a president a president has the holes an ambassador has the country bachelor has the kingdom when a president is murdered we call it an assault when an ambassador is murdered we call it an international incident the whole world is in chaos when an ambassador is murdered you think the China cares the president Trump was to die today they wait for us to vote for a new president they wouldn't care one bit they wouldn't cry unless they like them which not many do no country will try to make a big to-do out of it other than announcing the US president is now dead they're not going to come to our aid and try to help us out and see if there's anything we need because he's just the president but kill the ambassador you kill the ambassador and we are going to war all of the countries we're going to war masters very important person what you trying to say with a joke this is why the devil can't touch you it's because if saintly trying to touch you sister calm all of the angels in heaven would draw their sword that was not even blunting you with a stick because he already knows he can't touch you Satan knows about the manual that you haven't opened yet he's ready already that's why he's so mad and that's why he's trying to keep you from reading and that is also why he's trying to keep you away from this message the devil knows about the revelation of this message the template works of destruction because if the true church will get a revelation and recognize who she is and understanding two spirits that operate within the framework of the church he knows that she already is an invincible army he knows that so what does he do he's not trying to hit you with a stick he's trying to keep you off of your knees he's trying to keep you from hearing that voice what does he do he'll make people leave and make you question that's how he's trying to do if he keeps you from reading the manual he's already warned the battle in your life he says you don't even know what this message is all about you've never read it before you don't know anything about it so if I come in your ear and tell you whatever you will believe it if I tell you you're defeated you will believe it if I tell you you won't come out of that situation you will believe it if I tell you that there's no hope you won't believe it and he's right because you haven't read the manual you haven't really gotten the revelation of the message into your heart yet so he's already winning but as an ambassador if he ever puts his hands on you all of heaven will stand up you will have a whole army come running to the listen Jesus you know when he was on trial to be crucified Jesus never spoke one word he's a sat there quietly then he came before Pilate and Pilate said listen man you know I had a power to crucify you or to let you go free Jesus having spoken on trial on sister Sarah but when Pilate said this Jesus has something to say because see now what Pilate didn't realize was he was talking about kingdom affairs and see he had no power because this is not his embassy so Jesus looks at Pilate and I could just imagine he looked at a real easy real cool and said My Kingdom is not of this world he said but even now if I give the signal tens thousands of legions of angels will come and wipe this whole place out you know I've read that verse several times in the scripture brother Jack and I noticed that Pilate actually gets silent right here it must have been some kind of harsh sweat that Jesus put on Pilate right there because Pilate told me you know you don't say much after that right there he washes his hands it seems like you don't want to have nothing to do with this kind of Kingdom business and this is what the devil will do if you recognize who you are if you look see him in the eye I know who you are and I know you got a job to do but I'm an ambassador and I also got a job to do I promise you the devil will wash his hands with you he'll say I will not touch me he'll do it why because if this product gets into the wrong hands let's say somebody gets it with the intent to destroy that product they think they've destroyed the product but manufacture it was a part of my title for a reason God's manufactured your God's manufacture product a manufactured product means that there's not just one of these that means that if Satan was to get a hold of a situation in your life and damage you you're not done because God can manufacture a new product just for you and it will operate the exact same way you said God why don't you let this situation in this way it seemed like no success came out of this for me and I said that's all right I got a new iPad for you just before you open it and start using it this time read the manual read the manual wanna read this last quote the closing brother Branham says this and questions and answers on Hebrews number three in 1957 he says that when every talk of fear is vanished and the Holy Spirit is completely in control of the church then all fears are gone and that church has the power seat when they have everything that heaven owns behind them their ambassadors of the throne absolutely an ambassador of Christ has the authority and everything that Christ owns belongs to that ambassador and he said go ye into all the world you are my witnesses I wonder how many witnesses are here this morning you are my witnesses after the Holy Ghost has come on you and what is a witness is an ambassador is to come and witness something the whole powers of heaven is right in your hands I want to say something right here and close it actually I want you all to repeat this after me I am God's promised said again I am God's product I am God's masterpiece there is nothing wrong with me there is nothing wrong with me I am NOT a mistake I am NOT a mistake I am God's workmanship God is still working on me I am God's child God loves me God protects me God fights for me God speaks to me God is with me now I want you to believe that and you go back and you hear those things that you all said this morning you realize who you are you are God's masterpiece Satan has no authority over your body brother Brennan said that God created your body for you to live in so that when the devil tries to bring sickness on you God did not create your body for the devil to practice sick works on your body I'll say it again God did not perform your body for the devil to perform sick works on your body God did not perform your body for the devil to practice arthritis on you God did not create your body for the devil to practice high blood pressure on you that is not why your body was created God gave you this body of flesh to fulfill a mission of success your success is not determined by how successful somebody else is your success is determined by how successful you will complete the mission that God has for you you are God's product since birth you're God's masterpiece you are not still here for no reason God does not give you years without a purpose [Applause] God does not allow you to see old age for no reason you don't say God I'm in retirement no you're never in retirement you are a full-time ambassador if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that whatsoever things you say but believe make sure you read because you can't have faith without reading you can't have faith without hearing the spoken word faith cometh by hearing believe that what you say may you still have it now I'm not a hill or anything like that I don't believe that it takes necessarily prayer lines but God uses those things but I don't believe that it's gonna take all that this morning because I believe God has already able as the musicians come he's able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we can ever ask or think and while there's still time on the clock with Laroy while there's still time on the clock anything is possible Caleb Caleb 80 something years old he goes to Joshua he says give me this mountain high we like to say give me my mountain but that is not what Caleb said Caleb said give me this mountain I was listening to brother whisper preach on this where the whispers say Kenda want to keep her on for a reason and he brought a lot of things happening here on well one thing that I remember he said happened in here on he said it was the first place that God says to Abraham is there anything too hard for me this morning we are in Hebron the same place where God asked the question is there anything too hard for me at church I want to ask you all the question this morning is there anything too hard for the Lord if you believe that stay with me on your feet this morning you are an ambassador of heaven the sons and daughters of God and God needs you to be successful if you don't succeed God fails why brother Joe because you're his son and honor if you don't make it he can't make it so I want to promise you this morning no matter what you're going through you are going to make you look at someone tell them you're gonna make it you're gonna make it and then look at

has been an incredible year and I am just grateful to the Lord Jesus we were just felt led to do that prayer life service back in June and with brother Nathan and and brother Joe came and and you know just a Bethany came up and were free I'm sorry sister Rebecca or paint pray for him here the the results the end of this year that they're expecting and 2020 we know God did that thing and the brothers do I don't know a few if you realized but you were you were talking about Mary and how our Christian believe for us to be Christians we have to believe in miracles just to be a Christian you have to believe in a miracle because a virgin conceived and bore a child right and and if there was anything impossible that should have been impossible but God showed us that there's nothing impossible a man his word to get the job done and so that was our inspiration with stamina Mary you know last year this time we preached a couple sermons on Marian and it just took us right into the beginning of the year and and that's where we got inspiration from a man with the year the incredible because we thought about Mary and church I love that little thought that brother Joe gave us at the beginning there about the fourth quarter you know and in football they usually have 15 minutes a quarter [Music] and so you get you know the first quarter 15 minutes then another you know the second quarter another 15 minutes and third quarter 15 minutes in the fourth quarter 15 minutes and a man and when we make it there 15 minutes in that last quarter you know them guys know they have to turn everything on it and when he said that I realized today was the 15th day of December so 15 more days would really set us a man for this last quarter right hallelujah somebody look with all the things that we don't heard God do ain't no senses nobody leaving here down I believe brother Branham says it's time to doubt your doubts when the devil presented doubts you say I doubt that scene not that and how you know the double line every time he open his mouth you know he line race car man I'm leaving here in courage all right you know I will sit there just kind of thinking about it you know for some trials and things like that they've kind of come a little lately but you know sometimes a devil loved to give us focus on all the trials and and this happened that happened but you got to be able to turn things around on it I'm gonna start praising God for what I what are you all ready to indeed and I've said it before I'm gonna say it again if he don't do another thing he's done enough for me to praise on the rest of my days how are you you somebody then we serve a good God's hallelujah hallelujah I just thank God I thank God I thank God and I thank God let's just pray father we thank you for what we have heard in its release on today and God we have seen and heard a miracle god you've proven and I miss that you are the same yesterday today and forever we thank you Lord for blessing brother Joe and sister Rebecca follow the Lord with this child that you've given them and Lord just a beautiful testimony that went along with it even God even back when winning Kate was coming to preach but Lord things changed just a matter of hours they went there and a brother went scope searching and they preached Lord delivered his heart and the Father after that more of the miracle took place thank you for him being flexible father through this being flexible a miracle occurred God we're we're grateful for that Lord help help us Lord ask people not to realize we have to be flexible we don't know how you're gonna move but last week we just read the quote God then we can't we can't make an idol out of you we can't limit you to the way that you're gonna move there's so many Lord you got millions of ways to move so help us Lord just to receive as you give it to us Oh God Jesus don't let us miss it in this out like this for granted but Lord let us see that you are really moving and I'll miss no God and if there's anybody here in this place today that's under expectation for a miracle may their faith Lord be anointed to believe you for the impossible we declare this is still the year of the incredible and God we thank you for incredible things that you are doing in our myths whether it's a car with us a house Lord where this sickness in the body whatever it
