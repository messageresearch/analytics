[50:28] better but I won't apologize for what I
[50:32] said let's let's because I'm quite sure
[50:35] brother Jack when he see it he gonna be
[50:37] like whoa what's going on
[50:40] amen uh First Kings chapter 19.
[50:47] and it says in eight and Ahab told
[50:49] Jezebel all that Elijah had done and
[50:53] with all and how he had slain all the uh
[50:56] prophets with the sword then Jezebel
[50:59] sent the messenger unto Elijah saying so
[51:03] let the gods do to me and more also if I
[51:07] make not thy life as the life of the of
[51:11] them by tomorrow about this time
[51:14] and when he saw that he he arose and
[51:17] went uh
[51:19] for his life and came to birth Sheba
[51:23] which belonged to Judah
[51:26] and left his servant there but he
[51:29] himself went a Day's Journey Into the
[51:31] Wilderness and came and sat down under a
[51:35] juniper tree and he requested for
[51:37] himself that he might die and said it is
[51:41] it is enough now oh Lord take away my
[51:45] life for I'm not better than my father's
[51:50] and as he lay and slept under juniper
[51:54] tree behold then an angel touched him
[51:57] and said unto him arise and eat and he
[52:00] took and behold there was a cape bacon
[52:04] on the coals in a cruise of water at his
[52:07] uh head he did eat and drink and laid
[52:10] him down again the angel of the Lord
[52:12] came again the second time and touched
[52:15] him and said arise and eat because the
[52:18] journey is too great for thee and he
[52:20] arose and did eat and drink and went in
[52:23] the strength of that cake 40 days and 40
[52:26] nights until her of the Mount of God
[52:31] and he came there into a cave in lodged
[52:35] then behold the word of the Lord came to
[52:38] him and he said unto him what doeth thou
[52:42] hear
[52:44] Elijah
[52:46] amen may the Lord add a blessing to his
[52:48] word let's bow before the Lord gracious
[52:50] father we just thank you and we praise
[52:52] you oh God this morning we just want to
[52:56] get out of the way father God we realize
[52:58] that we're just an instrument this
[53:00] morning we just hear the Lord Express
[53:03] something that we trust that'll help
[53:06] further our experience in Jesus Christ

[53:32] ask that you just bless us in Jesus name
[53:34] amen amen you may be seated
[53:37] amen amen
[53:41] we'd just like to use as a little topic
[53:43] this morning uh don't run don't hide
[53:47] don't run don't hide
[53:50] amen now uh this morning as we get
[53:53] started also I just like to say how much
[53:55] we appreciate it
[53:58] um
[53:59] God I'm drawing a blank y'all help me
[54:02] Quentin Junior out of the night I I was
[54:06] I was online and uh this this morning
[54:11] this morning on the way to church I had
[54:13] to revisit the sermon again and I was
[54:17] saying to myself man
[54:20] boy in the next year that young man
[54:23] gonna be a Powerhouse
[54:25] just that just the information and the
[54:28] things that he was dropping like I know
[54:31] that fella knew that much
[54:33] that got loaded
[54:36] he he not like me and brother Jack and
[54:38] Troy we you know we kick and scream and
[54:42] break dance and all kinds of stuff when
[54:45] we up here he's standing in one spot and
[54:48] he just delivered
[54:50] so uh my hat's off to you we we're
[54:53] constantly praying for you him and him
[54:56] and brother Jerry uh I I enjoy I enjoy
[55:00] their style you know I'm not
[55:03] intellectual like that but uh they they
[55:05] call it students and stuff you know I I
[55:09] have a zero degree
[55:12] but uh I thank God for our understanding
[55:16] of the of the word of God this morning
[55:18] uh we we just like to just take an
[55:21] account of of the Prophet Elijah I think
[55:24] it'll be good for our background this
[55:27] morning
[55:28] uh and and I think we we want to try to
[55:30] just show us something because I think
[55:33] as Christians we we rely on on things
[55:36] that's not really reliable when we're
[55:40] when we're faced with with challenges
[55:42] when when we look at Elijah's resume
[55:46] real uh powerful resume of the things
[55:51] that uh he was able to do by the
[55:56] inspiration and I think that's key
[55:59] uh but but we're gonna go somewhere this
[56:03] morning y'all all right by inspiration
[56:06] looking at his resume the things that he
[56:08] were able to accomplish things that you
[56:11] know man you know especially back in
[56:14] those days it's a little bit different
[56:16] now but especially back in those days
[56:18] you couldn't just approach a king in any
[56:22] kind of way back in those days that your
[56:24] head would have dropped but but to walk
[56:27] up to walk up to a man of authority and
[56:31] position and and power like like a king
[56:35] I mean the words of a king man they were
[56:39] were
[56:40] over the top
[56:42] if if he said Off With His Head Off With
[56:45] His Head we could look back at scripture
[56:48] and and see during the days of Daniel
[56:50] and things of that nature when he made a
[56:54] decree he couldn't change his mind about
[56:57] it it's just something that had to be
[56:59] implemented is that right and so for for
[57:02] just a man that would come out of no way
[57:05] with the word of the Lord and speak it's
[57:10] not going to rain until I call for it
[57:13] that's that's that that's powerful right
[57:17] to want to walk up to a king of a Nation
[57:21] with with all of the authority that he
[57:23] holds and and just really Express real
[57:27] like my brother was saying real true
[57:30] Authority
[57:31] right because you know Elijah was the
[57:35] mouthpiece of God yes sir is that right
[57:37] he wasn't speaking
[57:39] of himself and for himself because God
[57:43] says you know I ain't gonna do nothing
[57:44] except I first according to the Book of
[57:47] Amos reveal it through my service the
[57:50] prophets that's just God's provided way
[57:52] is that right
[57:54] amen and so Elijah spoke a word and and
[58:00] just everything started to drying up is
[58:03] that right this this was just on on his
[58:06] his resume
[58:08] glory to God then then he comes back you
[58:12] know to Mount Carmel now now that's
[58:15] quotes uh on these but I'm just gonna
[58:17] talk about it
[58:19] right I'm gonna talk about it because I
[58:21] gotta leave some things you know I may
[58:23] read like I said last week I may read
[58:25] and I may not but I already know what's
[58:27] what's on my computer okay uh sometimes
[58:31] I like to get in the flow and let the
[58:33] flow flow
[58:36] so tired you know it's just the way that
[58:39] I'm built now in 30 years I've preached
[58:42] all all manners so so uh
[58:47] all of the things and all of the ways
[58:49] that I see preachers preach I'm familiar
[58:51] with
[58:52] in 30 years we've went those routes okay
[58:55] but when we when we look at his resume
[58:58] just tremendous just had great great
[59:01] Revival
[59:04] right but brother brother Brandon makes
[59:06] a a tremendous statement and just
[59:08] teaching though on this this scripture
[59:12] and just really really shows us
[59:14] something about spiritual people right
[59:17] uh you know spiritual people and and for
[59:20] Spiritual people you you kind of have to
[59:23] uh be careful a little bit
[59:26] right because you you go up to into
[59:29] these these atmospheres and in these
[59:31] places I I thank God in my Ministry that
[59:36] that I don't get up to where the Prophet
[59:38] went right because he often would say
[59:42] how those things would break down a body
[59:44] and and preachers knowing singers know
[59:47] even with with our our little gifts and
[59:50] different things man after you get done
[59:52] boy you just want to find a child
[59:54] somewhere and sit down after after
[59:56] because it's it's like being under that
[59:59] anointing uh for one hour and 15 minutes
[1:00:03] it's like working eight hour a day
[1:00:07] right you you be gassed
[1:00:10] especially especially when you preach
[1:00:12] like us with you know your hands moving
[1:00:14] your feet moving and everything moving
[1:00:16] and thank God you know if this was
[1:00:18] brother Diggs he'd be jogging back and
[1:00:21] forth and kicking and jumping and whoa
[1:00:24] and and all of that I I just could
[1:00:26] imagine especially as you start getting
[1:00:28] older you know uh it starts to take a
[1:00:32] toll on your body
[1:00:34] you know you you watch older ministers
[1:00:36] right back in the day folks used to
[1:00:38] preach two-hour sermons they start
[1:00:40] cutting them things down just a little
[1:00:43] bit you know when I was when I was in
[1:00:45] Georgia a couple of weeks ago they was
[1:00:47] talking about uh preaching preaching the
[1:00:49] two three hour message I was like not
[1:00:51] brother smiley
[1:00:53] I'm feeling especially it was the second
[1:00:55] service two of the day I'm like well I'm
[1:00:57] gonna give y'all this quick 45 minutes
[1:00:59] and I'll be ready to head to the airport
[1:01:02] you're not fit to kill me hey man cause
[1:01:06] it's it's tiring on the body but we we
[1:01:09] find you know the profit and just a
[1:01:12] great great amen move of God inspired by
[1:01:16] God
[1:01:17] right where where uh in the 18th chapter
[1:01:21] first king we found his experience on on
[1:01:24] Mount Carmel and faced with a challenge
[1:01:28] right he was in he was in a contest
[1:01:33] and and it is something that we got to
[1:01:35] keep in mind you know as we we we live
[1:01:38] our our daily lives we're in a constant
[1:01:40] amen contest
[1:01:42] it's it's it's a constant battle
[1:01:45] right and wrong
[1:01:47] good and evil a contrast right we we
[1:01:52] always got to keep that in mind we're in
[1:01:55] a constant contest
[1:01:58] right amen
[1:02:01] we we because sometimes I we we we we
[1:02:04] get carnal and Earthly and we do forget
[1:02:07] I forget I'm human I'm gonna touch on
[1:02:10] that a little bit
[1:02:12] see it's it's one thing to be anointed
[1:02:15] it's one thing to be expressing the
[1:02:19] thoughts of God by a gift of God
[1:02:23] but it's another thing when you're not
[1:02:25] inspired
[1:02:27] when when when you when you're not when
[1:02:30] you're not in in those realms
[1:02:34] amen that's something totally different
[1:02:37] and see everybody everybody wants this
[1:02:40] somehow be you know be anointed and
[1:02:43] appointed
[1:02:45] right everybody some you know you
[1:02:48] because you you look we we're looking
[1:02:50] from the outside in and those things
[1:02:53] look you know uh uh great
[1:02:57] you know makes it makes it seem like
[1:03:00] this person is important
[1:03:02] but but you know just like uh uh uh
[1:03:06] Elijah was saying he says you know what
[1:03:09] bro I'm a man just like everybody else
[1:03:14] right he he realized after the Inspira
[1:03:18] here's the thing right amen after after
[1:03:22] the Mount Carmel Showdown and he had
[1:03:25] destroyed all of the Prophet prophets of
[1:03:27] Bell now y'all go back and read it right
[1:03:29] I'm just going to talk about it after he
[1:03:32] had to destroyed all of the prophets of
[1:03:35] Baal right had to had to laugh that at
[1:03:38] the the prophets of bell and then God
[1:03:41] comes down and and burns up his
[1:03:43] sacrifice then he raises up and say get
[1:03:47] these guys and took them fellas out
[1:03:51] right but that was all done by
[1:03:54] inspiration of God
[1:03:57] right the only way that those things
[1:04:00] could really be accomplished amen it had
[1:04:04] to be God we still moving this morning
[1:04:07] right but then but then after The
[1:04:11] Showdown then Ahab runs to Jezebel
[1:04:15] what a sight
[1:04:18] what a sight it just really shows you
[1:04:22] the weakness of Flesh the the weakness
[1:04:25] of of a man I ain't gonna go there I
[1:04:29] ain't gonna meddle this morning
[1:04:31] where he runs to us he runs to his wife
[1:04:35] amen after being defeated
[1:04:39] oh Lord we could preach that right now
[1:04:43] right and then but then it also it also
[1:04:47] showed what kind of a anointing
[1:04:51] that was on her
[1:04:53] right now that anointing is still here
[1:04:56] in the Earth today
[1:04:58] right on so many levels that's that's
[1:05:02] not just break it down to you know you
[1:05:04] could have a spirit but that Spirit it
[1:05:07] it runs it runs on so many levels right
[1:05:11] glory to God and and watch this
[1:05:16] to the inspiration was off of the
[1:05:20] Prophet Elijah here comes the threat
[1:05:25] that's just how the devil works
[1:05:28] when you're feeling good in church and
[1:05:32] when you're having a wonderful time
[1:05:34] right when when all that is off then he
[1:05:38] comes to threat
[1:05:39] right Jezebel says Listen by this time
[1:05:43] tomorrow
[1:05:45] boy I'm taking you out
[1:05:49] right no no just just think let's think
[1:05:53] about something here go a man that was
[1:05:55] just being inspired by God
[1:05:58] great Revival getting great results
[1:06:03] great moves of God
[1:06:05] but that wasn't it
[1:06:07] right that wasn't it it shows us it
[1:06:10] shows us something because here comes
[1:06:13] the threat
[1:06:15] right
[1:06:17] and and a threat is a statement of
[1:06:19] intention
[1:06:21] right to injure or damage or other
[1:06:24] hostile actions on someone here comes
[1:06:28] here comes the threat
[1:06:31] right and and from from the threat comes
[1:06:36] fear
[1:06:38] fear right
[1:06:40] to and let's think about it to him
[1:06:44] but it shows us something right I
[1:06:48] believe God allows things to happen for
[1:06:51] for our benefit
[1:06:54] as as teachable moments
[1:06:57] come on church and we do we need we we
[1:07:00] need teachable moments
[1:07:03] right God God allows things to happen in
[1:07:07] our life on a consistent basis for
[1:07:10] teachable moments
[1:07:12] is that right so so it teaches us
[1:07:15] something and then it gives us something
[1:07:18] that that we can relate
[1:07:21] come on Church
[1:07:22] come on Church
[1:07:25] see it is
[1:07:26] every every moment is beneficial whether
[1:07:30] you like it or not
[1:07:32] you know the Bible says in the book of
[1:07:34] Roma all things work together
[1:07:36] come on priest with somebody
[1:07:39] it might not be good but God will make
[1:07:42] it work out for the for the betterment
[1:07:45] to fulfill his purpose everything may
[1:07:48] not make you happy everything may not be
[1:07:52] joyful but everything has a teachable
[1:07:55] moment
[1:07:57] amen
[1:07:58] you might feel like man your world is
[1:08:02] falling apart
[1:08:04] amen from the threat amen after coming
[1:08:07] out of this this this inspiration and he
[1:08:11] just kind of caught between you know
[1:08:13] it's two rims if you go back to what
[1:08:17] brother Brown teaches right and and here
[1:08:20] she makes a threat now there's no
[1:08:23] inspiration
[1:08:25] right
[1:08:27] now you got this you gotta stand as a
[1:08:31] man
[1:08:33] come on
[1:08:35] that's right because look at this right
[1:08:36] he said boy look I boy I feel anointed
[1:08:40] you ever been there
[1:08:42] hey you know I'm I'm I feel anointed
[1:08:45] right now but but once I pass this mic
[1:08:48] off and that anointing settles down then
[1:08:51] I gotta operate as a man
[1:08:55] with no inspiration no no anointing on
[1:08:59] me
[1:09:01] is that right right right now I feel
[1:09:03] like I could go through that wall and
[1:09:06] it'll open up now that's just a feeling
[1:09:08] because he ain't told me so I ain't
[1:09:09] Finna Try
[1:09:11] I just say I feel
[1:09:14] you know when preachers get up here and
[1:09:16] they be bucking and feel like they could
[1:09:18] tap something they be talking big but
[1:09:22] they're inspired that their anointing a
[1:09:25] gift is operating and and and you know
[1:09:28] we talk real big come on devil y'all
[1:09:32] know what we talking about and y'all be
[1:09:34] amen preacher go ahead on with your bad
[1:09:38] self and we be spinning around in high
[1:09:42] five in and jerking and jumping and and
[1:09:45] he's anointed and you will anointed too
[1:09:49] and you feel it good cause you're
[1:09:51] looking at one another and everything
[1:09:52] else is that right
[1:09:54] but but then you know what
[1:09:57] um that there comes a time when that
[1:10:00] anointing starts setting especially
[1:10:02] after you and got you some chicken
[1:10:05] come on
[1:10:08] man that you got some collard greens and
[1:10:11] black eyed peas and well I feel good now
[1:10:15] some macaroni and cheese and everything
[1:10:17] and you you start you start forgetting
[1:10:21] even what the preacher preached because
[1:10:23] somebody come and ask you out I had to
[1:10:25] pass the preach well uh well uh you know
[1:10:30] you in between you know
[1:10:33] Realms and let me go back let me let me
[1:10:37] go get my tablet
[1:10:40] and I'm a living witness of that and I'm
[1:10:43] a preach but don't ask me what I
[1:10:45] preached 20 minutes after I done quit
[1:10:46] coming I have to go back to the tape and
[1:10:48] whatever right
[1:10:51] because then then we start getting back
[1:10:54] down to humanity
[1:10:57] and and we have to operate right
[1:11:01] we we got to learn to operate
[1:11:04] even when we're not inspired under these
[1:11:09] types of Inspirations we we steal like
[1:11:12] my brother was talking about that that
[1:11:14] Authority
[1:11:16] you know one one thing about Jesus uh
[1:11:20] and our inspiration this morning is
[1:11:22] confidence and knowing
[1:11:24] one thing about Jesus that made him
[1:11:27] different than us right even though you
[1:11:30] know we In the Flesh and we bypass our
[1:11:32] theophanese to come here to be in this
[1:11:35] contest but he came a man in a creative
[1:11:39] body he but he was in a contest but but
[1:11:43] amen his confidence was was in in
[1:11:47] knowing right
[1:11:50] but then with all of this this this
[1:11:54] these revivals that Elijah when when the
[1:11:59] threat came he took all right
[1:12:04] he took he took off he took off running
[1:12:06] and we we see it in different places in
[1:12:10] scripture where where men didn't really
[1:12:14] have a clear-cut understanding of who
[1:12:17] they were
[1:12:18] the promises that were given come on
[1:12:21] Church
[1:12:23] look at look at um for instance you know
[1:12:27] I was thinking about uh uh the battle
[1:12:30] that David had with Goliath
[1:12:33] and you know
[1:12:34] uh all things you know things are
[1:12:38] predestinated by God right
[1:12:41] it wasn't just by chance that uh uh uh
[1:12:45] David's father sent them to the battle
[1:12:48] to give it you know the brothers the
[1:12:51] little Villas or whatever might be to
[1:12:53] see what's going on in the battle I
[1:12:55] believe that that that was orchestrated
[1:12:58] by God
[1:13:00] to bring the promise into fruition
[1:13:04] because David was anointed
[1:13:07] right right David was anointed by the
[1:13:10] prophet David was you know on the back
[1:13:13] side of the desert having experiences is
[1:13:16] that right glory to God Amen but but
[1:13:20] that David during that time when David
[1:13:24] came out and they was like wait a minute
[1:13:26] wait a minute this man ain't even
[1:13:28] circumcised what y'all scared about
[1:13:31] huh look at look at the confidence
[1:13:35] that David had
[1:13:38] when when he came to the battle David
[1:13:42] didn't come to the battle it was just
[1:13:43] some Ruddy little boy
[1:13:48] David was anointed as king
[1:13:51] and I and I believe that that was that
[1:13:53] that anointing was just kind of you know
[1:13:56] resting and resonating on David is that
[1:14:00] right that has some real experiences
[1:14:03] because you know I don't think let me
[1:14:06] tell y'all something this week has been
[1:14:08] a crazy week for me I've been working on
[1:14:11] a little job by my house on the side and
[1:14:14] band the other day this lady
[1:14:18] this lady opened the door and these big
[1:14:21] old dog Come Running Out Boy my eyes got
[1:14:24] bit
[1:14:25] and boy I ran and jumped the car let up
[1:14:28] the window look at that little woman and
[1:14:30] she come here always I like and you yeah
[1:14:34] that's all you got
[1:14:36] don't you see me running scared you
[1:14:39] ain't putting nothing into it she did
[1:14:40] that all day I'm like this woman got to
[1:14:42] be crazy now I do something to your dogs
[1:14:44] you gonna be mad at me
[1:14:47] and then then yesterday church I'm gonna
[1:14:50] tell y'all something I pulls up I pulls
[1:14:53] up on the property
[1:14:55] and these two deer
[1:14:58] was out there now normally they'll see
[1:15:01] humans and they PM but I think these
[1:15:04] used to be pets because that used that
[1:15:06] property used to belong to a lady who
[1:15:08] who raised animals it used to be a place
[1:15:11] kids go out they should have tigers all
[1:15:13] kind of stuff out there brother cable
[1:15:15] assistant on top of my
[1:15:17] and I could tell one of the uh the deer
[1:15:20] had a little collar around his neck and
[1:15:24] I'm like but bro smiley don't do deal
[1:15:27] like that bro smiley do deer in Greece
[1:15:34] brother Smiley dude Greece brother I
[1:15:37] didn't do lie I did like that
[1:15:40] and they ran and then next thing I know
[1:15:44] soon as I started getting out my car
[1:15:46] they was coming to me
[1:15:49] I'm like well I don't know what to do
[1:15:51] this this out of my wheelhouse
[1:15:56] and every time I would come out the door
[1:15:58] they start coming to me I'm like this is
[1:16:00] odd
[1:16:02] but it just shows you as as a human
[1:16:04] being with no ex real experience with
[1:16:07] animals man that was a element of fear
[1:16:11] I'm gonna be honest with you
[1:16:13] I ran
[1:16:16] and I don't do too much running
[1:16:19] right but I still know I could I got a
[1:16:21] little something in me when I gotta go I
[1:16:24] gotta go
[1:16:25] Feet Don't Fail Me Now
[1:16:28] y'all know what I'm talking about be
[1:16:31] right here limping and everything unless
[1:16:33] something get behind you you
[1:16:36] out of there I'm out of here you get to
[1:16:39] talking to the Lord
[1:16:41] right
[1:16:43] but amen but you know that that those
[1:16:46] things was just an introduction for
[1:16:49] David
[1:16:50] for the for the world to see what was on
[1:16:52] them but that but there was a confidence
[1:16:55] that that he had that you know a man
[1:16:59] that was Head and Shoulders above all
[1:17:01] the rest
[1:17:02] his brother and were were great warriors
[1:17:06] they were they was run off and they were
[1:17:08] hiding
[1:17:10] and instead of them instead of them uh
[1:17:14] uh
[1:17:14] approaching the threat
[1:17:17] right amen there was an element of fear
[1:17:23] right
[1:17:25] and fear is an unpleasant and often
[1:17:28] strong emotion
[1:17:29] caused by expectations or an awareness
[1:17:33] of danger
[1:17:35] right some something happens it's it's a
[1:17:39] human a human emotion that that we as
[1:17:42] human beings we have
[1:17:45] is is a fight or flight
[1:17:48] normally we fight
[1:17:52] unless we pushed into a corner then we
[1:17:55] fight and flight we fight on our way out
[1:17:59] is that right especially if somebody get
[1:18:02] two or three good was on you
[1:18:04] I still remember this day I tell this
[1:18:06] story every night then we had a good
[1:18:08] friend of mine used to live up the
[1:18:09] street from us and I had a neighbor
[1:18:11] across the street from me her name was
[1:18:13] Annette now I had some tough sisters in
[1:18:15] my neighborhood boy could get down and I
[1:18:18] don't know what he did to end that
[1:18:21] and I said Mama get you when you get off
[1:18:23] that bus
[1:18:24] when he got off the bus and that hit him
[1:18:27] with a two-piece
[1:18:29] all you see was feet
[1:18:34] behind him but he was too fast it was it
[1:18:38] was more flight than fight
[1:18:41] right but but but fear fear fear did
[1:18:46] that we still moved to church how much
[1:18:48] time I got fear fear fear did that is
[1:18:51] that right and so at the threat at the
[1:18:56] threat of of his of losing his life
[1:19:00] right now watch watch this we talked
[1:19:04] we're talking about a servant of God
[1:19:09] right
[1:19:09] a servant of God not just a prophet of
[1:19:14] God with with the the the words of God
[1:19:19] on his lips sir right but at the threat
[1:19:24] all of that went out the window
[1:19:27] right why because at that at that and it
[1:19:31] shows us something that that these
[1:19:34] things you just can't rely upon
[1:19:38] come on Church somebody say Amen
[1:19:42] you just can't rely upon your gifts
[1:19:46] right because see I ain't always
[1:19:48] preaching
[1:19:50] come on church amen most of the time I'm
[1:19:55] living as a man
[1:19:57] I'm I'm living as a a human being I'm in
[1:20:01] a contest
[1:20:03] right
[1:20:04] right not not preaching and not just
[1:20:07] anointed but but I'm in a contest
[1:20:11] I'm more than a man
[1:20:14] but I'm a man that I hope that didn't go
[1:20:16] over your head
[1:20:18] but but it's it's it's what I understand
[1:20:23] about who I am as a man
[1:20:29] that felt good
[1:20:31] come on say that again
[1:20:33] see
[1:20:35] amen I'm in a contest every day
[1:20:39] you're in a contest every day
[1:20:43] Good and Evil
[1:20:46] see young people and adults we all we
[1:20:49] are all in a contest every day
[1:20:53] 24 hours a day
[1:20:55] is that right we had a contest between
[1:20:58] what's right and what's wrong
[1:21:01] right and and it's it's it's a cause
[1:21:05] it's a constant threat
[1:21:08] to to our spirituality right
[1:21:15] it's just so so many levels the the the
[1:21:18] the threat amen that we're under it just
[1:21:22] covers man so much
[1:21:26] is that right
[1:21:28] amen and and with the threat is to bring
[1:21:31] harm
[1:21:33] right it's it's to do is to do damage
[1:21:37] and that's on a consistent basis
[1:21:41] right one thing about the Devil he's he
[1:21:44] ain't he ain't God as far as Hebrews 13
[1:21:46] and 8 but he don't change
[1:21:49] he he don't change his Tactics come on
[1:21:54] he's consistent when we're not
[1:21:57] consistent
[1:22:00] somebody ought to say man the devil
[1:22:03] consistently on a consistent basis
[1:22:05] fights us
[1:22:08] he don't get tired
[1:22:11] look at look at the look at amen God
[1:22:14] servant
[1:22:15] he was tired he was worn out he look
[1:22:19] watch what he said boy this is enough
[1:22:24] you ever said that water I'm exhausted I
[1:22:28] don't had enough this thing is
[1:22:31] overwhelming I you know I don't know
[1:22:34] what to do I don't know come on church
[1:22:36] if you got children you'd have said that
[1:22:39] two or three times if you got a wife you
[1:22:41] done said that if you don't got a
[1:22:43] husband you didn't said that if you got
[1:22:46] a boss man you didn't see it Dad
[1:22:51] well maybe y'all ain't in no battles
[1:22:53] then cause I can't get y'all to praise
[1:22:54] him with me this morning
[1:22:56] huh
[1:22:58] but I'm a living witness I've had enough
[1:23:01] as a servant of God I've gotten to the
[1:23:04] point I had enough
[1:23:06] give me the White Flag I'm waving it
[1:23:09] come on
[1:23:10] I can't go no more
[1:23:13] next thing you know the prophet think
[1:23:17] about this now
[1:23:18] because because we we look at these
[1:23:20] gifts and everything and why we covet
[1:23:24] we want to be great man and God and we
[1:23:28] you know sometimes you know you don't
[1:23:31] even know what you're getting into I
[1:23:32] can't really say that I ever wanted to
[1:23:35] preach
[1:23:36] huh all I wanted to do when I started
[1:23:39] singing well I sang for for the glory of
[1:23:42] God
[1:23:42] God said no I got something else for you
[1:23:45] to do with your little singing that's
[1:23:47] going to be a secondary gift I give you
[1:23:50] but I got some I don't want it
[1:23:53] don't want it don't want to preach and
[1:23:55] then when I got a prophecy after my
[1:23:58] third message of being a pastor so I
[1:24:00] definitely don't want that
[1:24:04] and I still never forget sister Judy
[1:24:06] sister Judy came up to me one day she
[1:24:08] say brother I'm gonna say something to
[1:24:10] you that was the pastor wife at the time
[1:24:12] so you know I had to be respectful and
[1:24:14] she said it's like you running from
[1:24:16] something
[1:24:17] I am I was honest I am don't want that I
[1:24:21] want you know because the evangelists
[1:24:23] they get all the glory
[1:24:26] they come in and shake the place up and
[1:24:28] everybody want to go home with the
[1:24:29] evangelists
[1:24:31] come on Amen they spin around and
[1:24:34] kicking everybody hey man but the pastor
[1:24:37] got to deal with y'all every week
[1:24:40] he got to preach and say hard things and
[1:24:42] stand at the door and Shake Your Hand
[1:24:44] God bless you while you doing this God
[1:24:46] bless you brother
[1:24:48] well praise the Lord
[1:24:57] too God bless you yeah are you real
[1:25:00] quick
[1:25:01] or if you can bypass him
[1:25:05] you know you'll get out of line and step
[1:25:07] and going on he saw that
[1:25:12] he'll get you the next time
[1:25:16] but you you you we we want to covet
[1:25:18] things that that we don't really know
[1:25:20] the the foot let me tell you something
[1:25:23] man you got to be crazy to want to be a
[1:25:25] pastor I'm telling you
[1:25:27] you see why you say that look let's look
[1:25:30] around us we got different people
[1:25:32] different age groups different ethnic
[1:25:35] backgrounds I mean we we got a little
[1:25:38] bit of everything Rich folk po folk
[1:25:40] y'all say Rich folk where the head
[1:25:45] did the hood folks poet folks you know
[1:25:49] whatever you prophesying
[1:25:52] come on
[1:25:57] I receive it in the name of Jesus
[1:26:01] huh come on don't be a scared to receive
[1:26:04] something nah reach up and grab it the
[1:26:08] song Say
[1:26:09] come on glory to God well I ain't never
[1:26:13] too old to spend God's money
[1:26:17] right
[1:26:19] amen but but you know you you just kind
[1:26:21] of got to understand what goes along
[1:26:23] with it it ain't an easy job that's why
[1:26:25] you always got to pray for brother Jack
[1:26:27] trying to trying to keep a balance
[1:26:29] trying to work with the Young Generation
[1:26:31] the middle age generation new couples
[1:26:34] older couples trouble couples his own
[1:26:37] family
[1:26:38] yeah I mean it's just a lot that go new
[1:26:41] people and trying to amen Express Jesus
[1:26:44] Christ and bring them into a further
[1:26:47] knowledge I mean it's a lot that goes
[1:26:50] along with with the office of being a
[1:26:52] pastor right I mean like I was saying
[1:26:55] last week you know Sunday Sunday
[1:26:57] mornings is the time where you get your
[1:26:59] shout on and everything else but you
[1:27:02] know Wednesday
[1:27:03] bro Jake don't play on Wednesday
[1:27:06] like brother Westco say he get down to
[1:27:09] where the rubber meets the road at
[1:27:11] he like he say he he might come out with
[1:27:14] uh uh uh what's that thing he do in the
[1:27:17] first he first started on Sunday morning
[1:27:18] I mean Wednesday mornings his uh his
[1:27:22] quotes that huh his key statements but
[1:27:25] after he finished them key statements
[1:27:27] it's only popping from there
[1:27:31] sometimes I'll be sitting in the back
[1:27:33] corner be like oh boy thank you Jesus
[1:27:36] Hallelujah
[1:27:38] yeah that was me Lord right because I
[1:27:42] got to stay on tags I have to kind of
[1:27:45] tell Joseph to keep y'all with me
[1:27:46] because yeah y'all are loose y'all go
[1:27:49] downhill on me quick right you start
[1:27:52] getting intent but but you know it just
[1:27:55] shows you that it's you know as the way
[1:27:58] that I look at you can't rely upon these
[1:28:00] gifts
[1:28:01] because gifts and callers without
[1:28:03] repentance you can operate it in gifts
[1:28:06] and and do all kinds of crazy things
[1:28:09] outside of church
[1:28:13] right you heard of God
[1:28:16] the prophet tells a story about two men
[1:28:18] gifted genuine Holy Ghost give one man
[1:28:22] prophesied and the next man interprets
[1:28:25] the prophecy to the to the letter
[1:28:28] but but by our gift he was able to shake
[1:28:31] one man's hand say oh that's a general
[1:28:33] genuine believer the other man he said
[1:28:35] oh
[1:28:36] oh and then by a gift of discernment
[1:28:40] amen he said oh that man got one wife
[1:28:43] over in the family he got another woman
[1:28:46] over here
[1:28:48] oh how'd that work
[1:28:51] then he had to get a scripture the rain
[1:28:54] falls under just as well as the unjust
[1:28:59] right even though he's unjust the rain
[1:29:02] falls on him a gift kicks in right
[1:29:05] because because gifts in the body if God
[1:29:07] that's in church well it's a body move
[1:29:10] if God wanted to speak a man through
[1:29:13] somebody somebody could get anointed
[1:29:15] this morning but it'll be God that'll
[1:29:17] speak in tongue and another man can
[1:29:19] interpret and and then and here's the
[1:29:22] thing it don't really make you much of
[1:29:24] anything because you might not do that
[1:29:26] ever again in your Christian Life
[1:29:28] amen come on well I'm a prophetess and
[1:29:31] I'm a prophet no God just used you Amen
[1:29:36] in a service or in a meeting amen
[1:29:39] because you're part of the body
[1:29:42] right not that it's not Prophet this is
[1:29:44] a prophet that's not what I'm saying but
[1:29:46] it's not something you don't want to
[1:29:48] promote yourself
[1:29:49] amen because you could get yourself in a
[1:29:52] whole lot of trouble
[1:29:55] it's no self-promoting uh uh it's
[1:29:59] because West West what kind of gift you
[1:30:02] got was predestinated right you you
[1:30:06] can't you can't make yourself something
[1:30:08] you can't make yourself a prophet you
[1:30:11] you was born before you was ever even
[1:30:14] according to Jeremiah right
[1:30:16] God I don't know Dame for him to be that
[1:30:18] if you're a pastor you were ordained the
[1:30:22] ability and everything if you're in
[1:30:24] evangelist well I'm a teacher I'm gonna
[1:30:26] just sit back and watch
[1:30:28] I'ma listen to you I'ma see how you
[1:30:30] handle the Bible
[1:30:32] but you ain't no teacher I'm sorry
[1:30:34] sometimes you just have to tell folk now
[1:30:36] you ain't no teacher you you might be
[1:30:38] have a gift but it ain't a teaching gift
[1:30:41] is that right because of the way the way
[1:30:44] that you handle scripture you had that
[1:30:46] thing all tied up wrong
[1:30:49] it's like a baby could tie that thing up
[1:30:51] bed and you just did
[1:30:54] come on Church
[1:30:55] but but let's let's look at Elijah when
[1:30:59] the inspiration amen felt uh uh uh was
[1:31:03] off of him as as a man
[1:31:06] he found himself a man running from the
[1:31:09] threat a man of of a group of people
[1:31:14] that he had already a man uh had the
[1:31:18] victory over he had already spoken right
[1:31:23] and then it just shows you it shows you
[1:31:26] as a human how how you know
[1:31:31] we can get weak
[1:31:33] our eagle eyes could get filmed over
[1:31:36] come on preach with me somebody ain't
[1:31:38] done yet
[1:31:39] right after all of that the threat of a
[1:31:43] woman then he failed to realize where
[1:31:47] was his confidence
[1:31:50] where where is his confidence see one
[1:31:53] thing I like about God as long as God is
[1:31:56] using you
[1:31:58] there's nothing can happen to you
[1:32:01] right glory to God as long as there's a
[1:32:05] work for you to do let me tell you
[1:32:07] something Church you know growing up in
[1:32:10] the streets and everything man I don't
[1:32:13] know how many times I almost overdosed
[1:32:16] on drugs and the fights and being shot
[1:32:20] by and all of that
[1:32:22] God hadn't even started to Quicken me
[1:32:25] yet so no matter what the devil was
[1:32:27] trying to do it couldn't happen
[1:32:31] right
[1:32:33] because of what was in the mind of God
[1:32:36] before I even knew let me tell you
[1:32:39] something before me and brother Jack
[1:32:41] ever started preaching the devil tried
[1:32:44] to take us out in a car accident
[1:32:46] brother Jack had got this nice back in
[1:32:49] the day red barelo that thing was nice
[1:32:53] we're on our way to church one Friday
[1:32:56] night and uh you know because I ain't
[1:33:00] have a car back then I just got saved
[1:33:02] and brother Troy says Italian them they
[1:33:04] were my rides

[1:33:42] stopping brother Jack tried to turn out
[1:33:44] the way he hit us ah we flipped over
[1:33:48] and rolled down the street
[1:33:50] and the amazing thing was he came out
[1:33:53] with glass on his left I came out with
[1:33:56] glass on my right hand that was it we
[1:33:59] jumped out the car and and I was walking
[1:34:01] around like a zombie like Lord have
[1:34:03] mercy you know when I got I got out
[1:34:05] first while he was saying Brothers Molly
[1:34:07] you all right I was headed out the
[1:34:09] window
[1:34:10] I like bro we'll talk later but I'm
[1:34:13] finna get up out of here today but the
[1:34:15] blow
[1:34:16] Jack gotta praise God glory to God the
[1:34:19] people set him down they crazy no we
[1:34:21] wasn't crazy amen but God knew what we
[1:34:25] would beat down the line
[1:34:27] is that right and and we just kind of
[1:34:30] been Inseparable whoever sits even when
[1:34:34] I had the church and he had the church
[1:34:36] we always said we were we were uh one
[1:34:40] church and two locations now we just one
[1:34:42] Church in one location
[1:34:45] right glory to God Amen I'm just I'm
[1:34:48] just kind of uh here to try to be a
[1:34:51] blessing but but it just really shows
[1:34:53] you what you can and what you cannot
[1:34:55] rely on let me let me speed it up I got
[1:34:57] about 20 minutes okay then then
[1:35:00] all of a sudden man he's he's he's out
[1:35:04] here and looking and just show but this
[1:35:07] was in the flesh with no inspiration he
[1:35:10] he like listen man I'm done I had enough
[1:35:12] I want to die
[1:35:15] come on
[1:35:17] and you see this all the time it's not
[1:35:20] something that's foreign you see this
[1:35:23] amongst Ministry
[1:35:26] you see this you see this in just just
[1:35:29] on every level
[1:35:31] right
[1:35:32] amen but we still going somewhere right
[1:35:37] uh and I don't know assistant Tina got
[1:35:40] some quotes but but I'm feeling good
[1:35:41] I'll just talk about it I like to just
[1:35:43] talk about what I already know what's on
[1:35:45] here and y'all go back y'all yeah go
[1:35:49] back brother Brown tells a story now I
[1:35:52] don't know I I I'll see how we how we
[1:35:55] work he tells a story now remember
[1:35:59] and and what I want to do is show you
[1:36:02] how contrasting the story that he tells
[1:36:05] as as a a servant of God versus what we
[1:36:10] just learned in uh first king 19. we
[1:36:15] learned the first king 19 here's a man
[1:36:18] that's gifted but yet when the
[1:36:20] inspiration leaves he he killed I'm out
[1:36:26] right knock knock considering
[1:36:30] not considering God at all
[1:36:34] right the threat produced a fear
[1:36:40] right and it's and it's hard to walk in
[1:36:42] fear and faith at the same time
[1:36:45] you you can't do it either either you're
[1:36:48] gonna have faith
[1:36:50] are you going to be in fear
[1:36:56] here's the thing about fear the fear
[1:36:59] torments
[1:37:01] right the fear the you you don't you you
[1:37:05] the worst thing you you can do as a
[1:37:08] individual is live a man in fear
[1:37:12] right just in this church we have got to
[1:37:15] live in a position or a place of
[1:37:18] confidence in knowing
[1:37:21] who we are in God
[1:37:23] I got a scripture for you but not yet
[1:37:26] right brother Brandon he tells this
[1:37:29] story he tells this story he's he's he's
[1:37:33] in a meeting right he's he's enemy and
[1:37:37] and he says this big guy probably a guy
[1:37:42] about my size right and and you know
[1:37:45] with my size a lot of people look at me
[1:37:46] saying I don't think I just wanna
[1:37:49] I don't just want to jump on him not

[1:39:20] this guy he was a he was he was uh
[1:39:23] deranged he was an ex escape from uh
[1:39:27] insane institution right and and so he

[1:39:58] that just shows you something see we we
[1:40:01] talk when we anointed praise God glory
[1:40:04] to God Alone
[1:40:09] so when that crazy dude start coming to
[1:40:12] the pulpit
[1:40:13] he said all them preachers
[1:40:16] ran in head
[1:40:22] huh and you have to ask the question
[1:40:27] right
[1:40:29] where were they in church they're in a
[1:40:32] meeting where's their confidence
[1:40:34] and and knowing
[1:40:37] right
[1:40:38] because because the same God that
[1:40:41] delivered Legion was in them
[1:40:45] well praise the Lord see
[1:40:49] where where was their spiritual
[1:40:51] understanding
[1:40:53] and and those those trying times
[1:40:57] it wasn't there they weren't inspired
[1:41:01] right
[1:41:02] see it it makes a difference when we're
[1:41:05] inspired
[1:41:07] we feel like we could do something but
[1:41:10] but when when that thing ain't on us and
[1:41:12] we we gotta operate from from this
[1:41:15] position of
[1:41:17] humanity and deity because there is a
[1:41:21] connection
[1:41:22] come on come on
[1:41:25] because just as much as we man
[1:41:28] the fullness of God because all that was
[1:41:31] in Christ he brought into the church
[1:41:34] right and and all it is it's a it's
[1:41:37] another contest
[1:41:40] right it's another contest that we're
[1:41:43] faced with
[1:41:44] right
[1:41:45] amen but what where's where's our our
[1:41:49] confidence what what it shows is that
[1:41:52] often we're we're in a real common Realm
[1:41:58] come on church I ain't done yet it
[1:42:02] really and I'm not saying this you know
[1:42:03] to hurt our feelings because you know
[1:42:05] I'm a human being too and a lot of times
[1:42:07] I look at myself in situations and you
[1:42:11] realize man I'm more carnal than I am
[1:42:13] spiritual well praise the Lord
[1:42:18] come on Church
[1:42:20] see it's it's easy to be super spiritual
[1:42:22] while we're here under this anointing
[1:42:25] and in this atmosphere
[1:42:27] but but you know it we are who we are
[1:42:31] outside of these doors we we are it
[1:42:35] shows our level of maturity when we
[1:42:38] outside these doors our level of
[1:42:41] understanding of our Authority when we
[1:42:44] when we're outside of these doors right
[1:42:48] and and and we're constantly being
[1:42:51] threatened
[1:42:52] and what's our response
[1:42:57] is right I'm out of here
[1:43:00] come on
[1:43:02] I'm going on
[1:43:04] because because how how often how often
[1:43:08] right
[1:43:12] but but it's it's the contest
[1:43:15] but it just shows where we at uh uh in
[1:43:20] in our maturity don't dis-christianize
[1:43:22] you
[1:43:23] is that right it never did nothing to
[1:43:27] Elijah's gift he was still just as
[1:43:30] gifted as he was Amen on Mount Carmel
[1:43:34] is that right because because you know
[1:43:38] uh like I think Brothers Jack was
[1:43:40] talking about the week being a prophet
[1:43:41] they throw the dead man amen on his body
[1:43:45] brought him back to life it did it
[1:43:48] didn't change what he was but but it
[1:43:50] just showed it his Humanity he was
[1:43:54] lacking something and I and I got a
[1:43:56] quote on that but he was brother Brown
[1:43:59] was making a statement in his teaching
[1:44:01] he said you know Elijah was like man you
[1:44:05] know from the threat then fear and then
[1:44:08] Elijah realized something wrong
[1:44:11] right
[1:44:13] glory to God
[1:44:14] when when he should have faced the
[1:44:17] threat
[1:44:18] right and and confidence
[1:44:23] he was out
[1:44:25] when the prophet was was faced with the
[1:44:28] threat this man said listen and brother
[1:44:31] makes a statement he said this guy was
[1:44:33] big brother Brandon was 128 pounds he
[1:44:36] said man this man with shoes big hands
[1:44:40] big arms man knowing watch his testimony
[1:44:44] he just knocked out a man and you got to
[1:44:47] realize a demon-possessed man is ten
[1:44:51] times the average man in strength
[1:44:53] because he got other folk there
[1:44:58] y'all don't know man
[1:45:02] I'm telling you I got I got a cousin
[1:45:05] like that man when the police come get
[1:45:08] him it take an army
[1:45:10] five six seven eight big dudes
[1:45:13] to get especially when when he got some
[1:45:16] waiting stuff on him boy but they ain't
[1:45:18] dealing with one man they did it with 10
[1:45:22] 15 20 people
[1:45:23] demon powers
[1:45:26] glory to God brother I understand just
[1:45:30] the threat and realizing that this man
[1:45:34] has the ability to carry out the threat
[1:45:38] but
[1:45:41] but
[1:45:42] he says you know what when the and let's
[1:45:46] face it the man comes up spits in your
[1:45:49] face
[1:45:51] and could you could let's let's think
[1:45:54] about all of us all of us especially you
[1:45:57] know it's like the thing about this man
[1:46:00] didn't imagine not not somebody
[1:46:03] knock me out man
[1:46:06] but instead of it's and uh and all your
[1:46:09] help gone
[1:46:13] y'all y'all know y'all know my people
[1:46:16] that child I just call me I'll be there
[1:46:18] with you child dissing yeah girl and
[1:46:22] yeah homie homie but when the real
[1:46:24] pressure come
[1:46:27] bro wake up
[1:46:30] huh y'all know
[1:46:34] out of here
[1:46:35] right amen but he said you know it's
[1:46:40] something something in one place he was
[1:46:42] like you know something wouldn't let him
[1:46:46] run
[1:46:48] right something something
[1:46:51] kept him right in there with all the
[1:46:54] threatening with all of the testimony of
[1:46:56] all knowing that man this man hit me
[1:47:00] this man gonna kill me
[1:47:02] but he didn't run it hot
[1:47:05] right he he faced the threat
[1:47:09] and the man say man you little Weasley
[1:47:12] little
[1:47:13] something that's in the quote right you
[1:47:16] well I'm I'm knocking you out
[1:47:20] I'm knocking you out
[1:47:22] huh and you not moving
[1:47:26] see that show he he wasn't dealing in
[1:47:30] his Humanity
[1:47:33] because if he was listen if he was
[1:47:35] dealing in his Humanity he probably
[1:47:36] would have fought back because my mom
[1:47:38] was a boxer
[1:47:40] right or he'd have been out of there
[1:47:43] but but I believe there was something in
[1:47:46] him because when when when the guy when
[1:47:49] the guy came forward he said before he
[1:47:52] know it knew it see watch God God is a
[1:47:55] big God now God we talking about the
[1:47:59] supernatural
[1:48:00] he said before he realized
[1:48:04] before he realized
[1:48:07] see his mouth was speaking his ears was
[1:48:11] hearing and he was like what's going on
[1:48:15] God was the deity
[1:48:19] the deity that was in him
[1:48:23] was speaking for him
[1:48:31] he say oh
[1:48:34] since you challenged
[1:48:37] oh y'all ain't hear me
[1:48:39] since since you challenged
[1:48:42] the god that's in me
[1:48:45] you're gonna be prostrate
[1:48:48] but I said okay I'm gonna show you gonna
[1:48:50] be prostrate
[1:48:51] huh see he wasn't just dealing with a
[1:48:55] man he was dealing with a God man
[1:48:57] right amen see this is what we got to
[1:49:02] realize deity we amateur God
[1:49:07] see we're the the power of redemption we
[1:49:10] don't fully grasp right right the the
[1:49:14] the kind of uh
[1:49:17] power and authority that's been given to
[1:49:21] us
[1:49:22] right our problem is when as yielded to
[1:49:27] God
[1:49:28] right
[1:49:29] but we're talking about a man that that
[1:49:32] was totally yielded to God
[1:49:36] say when that that guy came up he said
[1:49:38] you know what he wanted to run but then
[1:49:41] he watched this watch how powerful this
[1:49:44] it shows us something it shows us the
[1:49:47] real Power of Love
[1:49:49] because so often and I'm guilty of it
[1:49:52] too you know we we have a tendency of
[1:49:55] getting in the flesh
[1:49:56] because because as a man a lot of times
[1:50:00] we think I know I'm a Christian I know
[1:50:02] I'm a preacher and sometimes it's like
[1:50:04] bro you got to push the humanity to to
[1:50:07] the side because you're not dealing with
[1:50:10] something natural you're dealing with
[1:50:11] spirits
[1:50:13] right and and watch watch inspiration
[1:50:18] coming on the prophet he started
[1:50:19] thinking you know what this a man just
[1:50:21] like me
[1:50:23] right and he don't really know me
[1:50:26] as a man he was like that man really
[1:50:30] don't want to do this to me
[1:50:32] come on church as as a as a man
[1:50:36] I said man he don't want to do that kind
[1:50:39] of stuff to me
[1:50:40] he he realized it was something that was
[1:50:44] motivating I'm preaching Church
[1:50:47] come on now
[1:50:50] he could have operated in the flesh but
[1:50:53] he realized watch the revelation of the
[1:50:56] word start coming down he realized you
[1:50:59] know what I'm doing because the Bible
[1:51:01] says we're not dealing with flesh and
[1:51:02] Blood come on church and we not
[1:51:06] we not we're not dealing with flesh and
[1:51:09] blood
[1:51:10] and you'll never defeat a man
[1:51:13] principalities and powers in the flesh
[1:51:16] right he said he really he looked at the
[1:51:19] man he said he realized man that man
[1:51:21] don't want to do this to me
[1:51:23] but he realized a man uh something
[1:51:26] something had conquered him had overcome
[1:51:31] him right and was expressing himself
[1:51:35] through his body
[1:51:36] but then God come down and God was
[1:51:38] expressing himself
[1:51:41] to through a man human lips
[1:51:44] amen is that right
[1:51:46] he says he says you know
[1:51:49] he projected love when When Love is
[1:51:53] projected then Sovereign Grace takes
[1:51:55] over
[1:51:57] yes sir right oh glory to God glory to
[1:52:00] God he tells the story about the about
[1:52:02] the the uh the bull the bees
[1:52:06] it was a projection of of the real truth
[1:52:11] he said you can't fake it
[1:52:15] yeah I know how folk he is I love you
[1:52:17] you can't fake it now
[1:52:19] it's got to be there in these kind of
[1:52:22] circumstances it's got to be there it
[1:52:24] ain't something you know you could just
[1:52:26] put on and act and everything else he
[1:52:28] was talking about with the bull right it
[1:52:31] had to be something that was really
[1:52:33] genuine something that was really
[1:52:36] emulate from his heart
[1:52:38] that was really fat
[1:52:42] that stopped the bull a killer bull he
[1:52:46] said boy he looked around he dropped
[1:52:47] that gate that day going to going to
[1:52:49] Amen to visit a sick person to pray for
[1:52:52] him and forgot his gun in the truck like
[1:52:55] and and he was between the the gate like
[1:52:59] oh Lord I ain't gonna make it boy if I
[1:53:02] try to run this bull go kill me
[1:53:05] right something something Supernatural
[1:53:08] kicked in the god parts
[1:53:12] huh
[1:53:13] man it probably should have kicked in
[1:53:15] yesterday but it didn't
[1:53:19] the field park kicked in and I started
[1:53:22] moving out them their way right
[1:53:25] sometimes we don't even realize the
[1:53:27] situations that God allows us to be put
[1:53:29] in to see to see what our reaction to
[1:53:33] the action will be
[1:53:36] yes sir I just said something
[1:53:39] what's our reaction to the action see
[1:53:42] his his reaction was and you might think
[1:53:46] this crazy uh to apologize to uh uh
[1:53:50] right to to begin to talk
[1:53:54] Adam did it ain't strange
[1:53:56] before the fall Adam could speak
[1:53:59] to Nature
[1:54:01] right
[1:54:03] yeah just speak say listen I'm so sorry
[1:54:05] but
[1:54:06] I had to pass through here as a sick
[1:54:09] person I'm so sorry I just serious sleep
[1:54:11] this that and the other look at that
[1:54:13] communication
[1:54:15] right listen church that was more than a
[1:54:18] man that that board that might sound
[1:54:20] crazy that but that was more than a man
[1:54:23] that bull recognized a man it was not
[1:54:27] just a man that was the creator
[1:54:31] Veil
[1:54:33] if it's not it's not then then what are
[1:54:35] we preaching when we talk about well I
[1:54:37] got the Holy Ghost what what are you
[1:54:39] talking about then
[1:54:43] what is the Holy Ghost to to you a third
[1:54:45] part of the 20th
[1:54:48] what are we talking about what have we
[1:54:50] been preaching to people
[1:54:52] if the Holy Ghost is God then it's God
[1:54:57] on human lips
[1:55:00] right with those bees
[1:55:03] God veiled his skin
[1:55:07] operating from a position of authority
[1:55:10] bees
[1:55:13] huh
[1:55:15] amen God's speaking through the lips of
[1:55:18] a man in the 21st century
[1:55:21] right
[1:55:23] and everything came out of that man when
[1:55:26] he got ready to hit the prophet
[1:55:28] right
[1:55:29] amen
[1:55:31] just he lost everything right because he
[1:55:35] was dealing with something that was
[1:55:36] greater than just Humanity we tell my
[1:55:39] amen the voice of God the Olympic God
[1:55:44] right with two omnipotence meets
[1:55:47] something's got the shake
[1:55:50] come on that's this ain't foreign church
[1:55:52] I'm gonna go
[1:55:54] this this ain't firing then then the
[1:55:57] prophet he brings out of scripture that
[1:55:59] almost made me
[1:56:01] shout in my house last night
[1:56:05] Psalms 46 if you could pull that up
[1:56:09] Psalms 46 and I thought see listen
[1:56:13] church we have got to have uh uh a place
[1:56:17] of rest for our faith
[1:56:20] right and it can't be shifting Sands of
[1:56:25] man's Wisdom or anything it's got to be
[1:56:28] on something you can put a something
[1:56:30] that's that's solid a place a place
[1:56:34] where we got an absolute come on church
[1:56:38] when we don't when we don't feel nothing
[1:56:43] come on church when we don't feel
[1:56:45] nothing around us we we gotta absolute
[1:56:49] right glory to God Amen and and the
[1:56:53] object was going on listen uh another
[1:56:57] statement but keep that there for a
[1:56:59] second if God is for us
[1:57:03] hey man right then who can be against us
[1:57:09] where God is blessed is blessing with
[1:57:11] God has cursed is cursed
[1:57:13] but if God is for me
[1:57:18] nothing can be against me right but then
[1:57:22] he says here God is
[1:57:27] our refuge
[1:57:29] right
[1:57:30] glory to God and strength
[1:57:33] see
[1:57:34] watch the sovereignty of God you know in
[1:57:38] in just the laws and different things
[1:57:41] how God would set up these these places
[1:57:44] of Refuge
[1:57:46] for the children of Israel
[1:57:49] a place where you could run in
[1:57:53] when when when you know if you did
[1:57:55] something accidentally and the focus
[1:57:58] behind you you could go in as long as
[1:58:01] you know you know you were accepted and
[1:58:06] a place where you could find rest
[1:58:09] right a place where you could find peace
[1:58:14] from the threat
[1:58:17] come on from the threat you could come
[1:58:20] in and you could find rest
[1:58:25] see a place where you can find peace
[1:58:28] because look at look at the World Church
[1:58:30] just just look at society as a whole
[1:58:34] outside of God you don't know this place

[2:08:27] running and hiding
[2:08:29] amen was you force for you God has for
[2:08:32] you I was thinking his brother Willie
[2:08:35] was preaching there was one Minister
[2:08:36] that came through through when we were
[2:08:38] in South Carolina and he was speaking of
[2:08:40] pre uh playing basketball with his son
[2:08:44] he just made this outstanding shot and
[2:08:46] his son said oh that was a lucky shot he
[2:08:49] said no I wasn't a lucky shot I don't
[2:08:51] believe in luck that was predestinated
[2:08:53] God knew I was going to make that shot
[2:08:56] before the foundation of the world
[2:08:58] so whatever God has for you it's going
[2:09:01] to come to you I was thinking when I was
[2:09:04] praying a little early I said Lord
[2:09:06] you're the only one that that can change
[2:09:08] things but no he has put some things in
[2:09:10] our hands
[2:09:12] we can't run from every battle that
[2:09:14] comes our way
[2:09:15] amen sometimes you have to stand still
[2:09:17] and sometimes you have to speak amen
[2:09:20] that God that's in you want to have
[2:09:22] preeminence in you and he wants to do a
[2:09:24] work for you but sometimes you close
[2:09:26] your mouth sometimes you start running
[2:09:28] away and God can't move on behalf
[2:09:31] stand still and know that he is God Amen
[2:09:35] praise the Lord praise the Lord amen
