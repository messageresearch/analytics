[9:24] forgiveth all thine iniquities who
[9:26] healeth all thy diseases who redeemeth
[9:29] thy life from destruction who crowded
[9:31] thee with lovingkindness and tender
[9:33] mercies who satisfies thy mouth with
[9:36] good things so that thy youth is renewed
[9:39] like the Eagles the Lord instituted of
[9:42] righteousness and judgment for all that
[9:44] are oppressed he made known his ways
[9:46] unto Moses his acts unto the children of
[9:49] Israel the Lord is merciful and gracious
[9:52] slow to anger and plenteous in mercy he
[9:55] will not always chide neither will he
[9:57] keep his anger forever he hath not dealt
[10:00] with us after our sins nor rewarded US
[10:03] according to our iniquities for as the
[10:05] heaven is high above the earth so great
[10:08] is his mercy toward them that fear him
[10:10] as far as the East is from the west so
[10:13] far hath he removed our transgressions
[10:14] from us like as a father pitieth his

[50:57] so he's here again this morning so good
[51:00] to have them here in first Peter chapter
[51:02] 2 and we'll start reading at verse 1 a
[51:07] man and you all just pray for me a man
[51:13] as we just kind of go through this I've
[51:14] been trying for weeks to get to get to
[51:18] this though and you know and sometimes
[51:20] you have to sit and simmer on it for a
[51:23] while you know it start changing on you
[51:26] just just just pray with me amen on the
[51:29] day first Peter chapter 2 verse 1 says
[51:32] wherefore laying aside all malice a man
[51:37] important laying aside all malice and
[51:40] all guile write and hypocrisies these
[51:47] these are things the Bible tell us to
[51:48] lay aside it's not it's not pre and X
[51:52] God to deliver you from it you actually
[51:57] have to give it up yourself o Lord you
[52:01] know because sometimes we like holding
[52:03] on the stuff you know you know the man
[52:06] that was at the at the gate I'm sorry
[52:11] not the gate he was there at the Pool of
[52:13] Bethesda that man enjoyed his condition
[52:16] and when Jesus came and approached him
[52:19] and said hey will you be made whole he
[52:20] started giving all kind of excuses as to
[52:22] why he couldn't be made whole well Jesus
[52:25] I'm not here to listen to the excuses
[52:27] take up your bed and walk right I mean
[52:30] he didn't acts after Jesus question and
[52:32] all the time we get comfortable in the
[52:34] condition that we're in but God wants to
[52:37] shake us to get us
[52:38] that condition right we comfortable with
[52:41] malice we're comfortable with guile
[52:43] we're comfortable with being a hypocrite
[52:47] hmm we're comfortable with envying what
[52:51] else we're comfortable with evil
[52:53] speaking
[52:55] all right the Bible say wherefore laying
[52:58] aside all malice all love it not some of
[53:02] it all of it
[53:04] wherefore laying aside all malice and
[53:06] all guile and hypocrisy and envies and
[53:08] all evil speakings as newborn babes
[53:12] desire the sincere look of the word that
[53:14] you may grow thereby if so be ye have
[53:18] tasted that the Lord is gracious the
[53:20] homecoming as into a living stone
[53:22] disallowed indeed of men but chosen of
[53:25] God and precious ye also as lively
[53:28] stones are built up a spiritual house a
[53:31] holy priesthood to offer up spiritual
[53:33] sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus
[53:37] Christ amen wherefore also it is
[53:41] contained in the scripture behold I lay
[53:45] in Zion a chief Cornerstone elect
[53:48] precious and he that believeth on him
[53:50] shall not be confounded unto you
[53:54] therefore which believe he is precious
[53:56] but unto them which be disobedient the
[53:59] stone which the builders disallowed the
[54:01] same as made the head of the corner and
[54:04] a stone of stumbling and a rock of
[54:07] offence even to them which stumble at
[54:10] the word being disobedient now these are
[54:13] some very serious statements that are
[54:16] being made here by Peter right and and
[54:18] I'm not going to go there but you can
[54:20] see even a day two people stumbling at
[54:22] the message right it's a stumbling stone
[54:25] a rock of offense they stumbling at the
[54:27] word but but but it actually leads them
[54:30] to disobedience all right amen weren't
[54:33] also they were appointed verse 9 says
[54:36] but ye thank God for that but all right
[54:39] but ye are a chosen generation a royal
[54:43] priesthood a holy nation a peculiar
[54:48] people I'm done that
[54:51] in a few weeks I'm gonna try to get to
[54:53] that wee-wee peculiar we look different
[54:55] we act differently strange folk right
[54:58] that's who we are that's what the Bible
[55:00] calls us we can't help that we were born
[55:03] to be different right we are peculiar
[55:07] people that ye should show forth the
[55:09] praises of him who have called you this
[55:14] is your personal testimony call you out
[55:17] of darkness into his marvelous light
[55:20] which in time past were not a people but
[55:24] are now the people of God which had not
[55:28] obtained mercy but now have obtained
[55:31] mercy the Lord as a blessing to the
[55:34] reading of his word let's just pray
[55:35] father we thank you for the ability to
[55:38] read scripture but Lord will read the
[55:41] scriptures not like we're reading the
[55:43] newspaper so god help us to realize a
[55:47] man what the Spirit is trying to speak
[55:50] to us in these words and we trust o God
[55:54] that you would help us to draw closer to
[55:56] you and as the scripture has commanded
[56:00] us has encouraged us to live by certain
[56:03] things this is an hour where we can't
[56:05] hold on to nothing but Jesus amen
[56:08] everything else is just not worth it so
[56:10] lord help us got to get our eyes and our
[56:13] attention focused on you may you just

[56:23] saying here today just everything that's
[56:25] been done

[56:28] forward into Revelation of your word
[56:30] that that is what's going to give us the
[56:33] victory over the enemy we ask it all in
[56:36] the mighty name of Jesus amen amen god
[56:40] bless you can be seated so we want to go
[56:48] back to our thought on Showzen
[56:52] generation a man of chosen generation
[56:56] and if I could I want to read just a
[56:58] couple things before I get started here
[57:01] I was listening to
[57:03] sermon for you a few weeks ago
[57:07] maybe a month or so ago the signs of his
[57:10] coming brother branham was preaching
[57:12] there on this message the signs of his
[57:14] coming and he made a statement you know
[57:17] in that in that particular sermon that
[57:20] just kind of captured my attention and
[57:22] when when it caught my attention to
[57:24] begin to take me down
[57:25] you know this path of a chosen
[57:27] generation so let me just read here a
[57:29] man from this this this message signs of
[57:34] his coming it says it's now if it
[57:37] discourages them the signs discourages
[57:41] and dismays them it encourages the
[57:46] believer right it encourages the
[57:48] believer that's right
[57:49] it discourages one because why he
[57:53] believes he believes the word it is it
[57:57] is encouraged the believer in the
[57:59] scriptural truth signs remember I'm
[58:02] speaking on the signs of his appearing
[58:05] in this generation a man now I didn't
[58:09] bring it but I'll just make the
[58:10] statement brother Branham said the
[58:11] appearing of Christ and the coming of
[58:13] Christ of two separate things a man and
[58:16] even when we saw him appear in the
[58:19] Ministry of His Prophet that amen that
[58:22] was an appearing and many of many other
[58:23] things that he did to show us that he
[58:25] was on the way but the coming the second
[58:28] coming of what we're living in that time
[58:29] right now
[58:31] hallelujah church a man we leave out
[58:33] we're not talking about
[58:35] glory to God we're not talking about
[58:37] possibly 50 60 years from now a man
[58:40] there's too many things happening that
[58:43] let us know that at any moment now it
[58:46] could all be over and see when we really
[58:49] get a revelation of that right when we
[58:52] really get to understand that that's
[58:54] when we become a last five malice that's
[58:57] when we're getting the last five nd
[58:58] that's when we begin to lay aside
[59:00] jealousies it and petty stuff that just
[59:03] don't mean nothing and there it ain't
[59:05] number the devil if we can't fellowship
[59:09] here when we go to start fellowship
[59:10] because we can't we can't expect if not
[59:13] fellowship here did everybody go to
[59:15] heaven
[59:15] develop at some time somebody gotta
[59:18] leave something aside and I believe
[59:22] we've incidents or seas that we're
[59:24] trying to drop this and drop that and
[59:27] forget about this and forget about that
[59:29] it's time to crash into the rapture come
[59:33] on church they may look at what the
[59:35] percentage they remember I'm speaking on
[59:37] the signs of his appearing in this
[59:40] generation so that if we can show here
[59:43] in the scripture that this is the
[59:47] generation that will see the coming of
[59:51] the Lord when you said that I say wait a
[59:54] minute this is the generation that will
[59:58] see the coming of the Lord hallelujah
[1:00:01] now I want to tell you a living in that
[1:00:04] generation amen and this is you know for
[1:00:08] years people have preached about the
[1:00:10] second coming of the Lord but there
[1:00:12] comes a people that comes to the earth
[1:00:14] someday that will be a living
[1:00:17] manifestation of the second coming of
[1:00:19] the Lord and often what what if I'm
[1:00:22] saying this is the generation that will
[1:00:25] see the coming of Lord when I heard that
[1:00:28] I said a man I'm a part of that
[1:00:29] generation that will see it and if I'm a
[1:00:32] part of it then what should I be doing
[1:00:34] let me keep going says or what says oh
[1:00:38] you say are you sure of that well I say
[1:00:42] well just look to see what the signs
[1:00:44] point to see how close we are
[1:00:47] if the signpost says you're nearing just
[1:00:51] a few miles away you better be getting
[1:00:55] ready
[1:00:57] if the signposts say that you better be
[1:01:02] getting ready
[1:01:04] amen what what should I do that
[1:01:06] individually you better be getting ready
[1:01:13] not worried about what this will do cuz
[1:01:16] they may not like it but I'm talking
[1:01:20] about myself I gotta be getting ready if
[1:01:23] there's anything about half if not peace
[1:01:26] and God I want
[1:01:27] we love it anything in my life that's
[1:01:30] not right I want to get rid of it
[1:01:32] because I got to be getting ready listen
[1:01:36] you better be getting ready because it
[1:01:39] may just be it may be just a few hours
[1:01:42] away see but he told us what would take
[1:01:44] place just before this time and that's
[1:01:47] what we're going to look at now you know
[1:01:49] there's so many things that you know I
[1:01:51] can I can go in when we talk about
[1:01:54] sounds at the time you just go back to
[1:01:57] Matthew 24 it just gives you a
[1:01:59] description of everything right that
[1:02:02] that I mean there's a there's probably
[1:02:04] like 50 something verses that I won't
[1:02:05] take time to read all that now but I
[1:02:07] want to encourage you go back and read
[1:02:09] Matthew 24 it just gives you some of the
[1:02:11] silence now one of the signs that that
[1:02:14] is it's so real
[1:02:17] one of the great signs that Jesus was
[1:02:20] coming again he said as it was in the
[1:02:23] days of Noah so shall it be in the
[1:02:25] coming of the Son of Man he also said as
[1:02:27] it was in the days of lot so shall it be
[1:02:29] in the coming of the Son of Man so now
[1:02:31] in the days of Noah what the problem was
[1:02:32] there was a lot of marriage in marriage
[1:02:37] and divorce problems and not only not
[1:02:40] only marriage and divorce but you had a
[1:02:43] lot of believers marry and unbelievers
[1:02:50] which is never supposed to happen under
[1:02:54] no circumstances should have believer
[1:02:56] marry an unbeliever that's what that's
[1:02:58] what the Prophet tells us but but but in
[1:03:00] the Noize day we have the sons of God
[1:03:03] that's a believer going after the
[1:03:07] daughters of men that's an unbelievable
[1:03:09] so we have believers marrying
[1:03:12] unbelievers
[1:03:13] oh come on somebody I think I'm in there
[1:03:15] right now because sometimes we get these
[1:03:18] thoughts that we can go out and get
[1:03:20] somebody converted hallelujah you can't
[1:03:24] do that you better let him come convert
[1:03:26] it
[1:03:28] right but believers will try to marry
[1:03:30] unbelievers and that is a common thing
[1:03:33] that's happening nowadays hallelujah
[1:03:37] amen
[1:03:37] stay with the believers yeah I mean
[1:03:40] there's got his own problems
[1:03:42] it got his own problems you need to know
[1:03:45] you got somebody that know God when the
[1:03:49] roads get rough and they go and get
[1:03:51] tough you need somebody got a
[1:03:52] relationship with Jesus all right come
[1:03:57] on now somebody maybe you don't you if
[1:04:00] you don't know what kept you Jesus here
[1:04:03] it's a folk don't went through some
[1:04:05] stuff but what their captain together is
[1:04:09] Jesus and Holland and you ain't got
[1:04:15] Jesus who got problems right but that
[1:04:18] was a problem in North Day but the
[1:04:20] believers were marrying unbelievers and
[1:04:23] then in Las data
[1:04:25] it was marriage giving a marriage in and
[1:04:27] then the other big problems
[1:04:29] homosexuality and when Jesus told us
[1:04:32] that we see all of that at the same time
[1:04:35] right Amen all of it came to earth that
[1:04:38] the same are we dealing with that right
[1:04:39] now
[1:04:40] laws being passed all tell us what
[1:04:42] happens we test impossible for us not to
[1:04:45] see that this is the last thing deal
[1:04:49] assurance he's our son my daughter was
[1:04:51] telling me you know just a little
[1:04:53] something happened on the job was
[1:04:56] talking with a friend of hers and you
[1:04:58] know they were just talking
[1:04:59] it was just talking I this this is going
[1:05:02] on the internet and everything else but
[1:05:04] you know what maybe someone on internet
[1:05:06] need to hear
[1:05:07] maybe somebody need to hear but you know
[1:05:12] um they were talking and the young lady
[1:05:16] you know me the mentions you say you
[1:05:18] know I just feel like all all girls are
[1:05:25] homosexual all girls are in that they
[1:05:30] you know they they like other girls my
[1:05:34] daughter said no I'm not
[1:05:36] I'm not she tell you again I know I know
[1:05:38] you not you're not you're not she said
[1:05:40] because you saved because you saved and
[1:05:45] just they say my daughter said now I
[1:05:47] don't have a problem giving a compliment
[1:05:48] to another lady saying that she looks
[1:05:50] nice or whatever even sometimes guys
[1:05:52] would say that about another god men
[1:05:54] that look nice I think I said that but
[1:05:56] brother Josue suit last weekend is there
[1:05:58] I can make a compliment and I have an
[1:06:03] attraction but you know and we don't got
[1:06:14] to the point that just because somehow
[1:06:16] to say you look nice you think oh no no
[1:06:20] no no no no no don't even start thinking
[1:06:22] that way don't let the devil get your
[1:06:24] mind and today I'll just give it a
[1:06:26] compliment
[1:06:28] hallelujah right but by the old a
[1:06:31] failure let me say I just feel like all
[1:06:33] girls up you know got got a certain
[1:06:35] element of this homosexuality that's
[1:06:37] already insane oh I ain't got it I'm not
[1:06:39] attracted to other women like that I'm
[1:06:40] not like that
[1:06:41] oh that's because you saved because I'm
[1:06:44] saved she say she say you go to church
[1:06:48] and you saved well my daughter's there's
[1:06:50] a lot of homosexual people that go to
[1:06:52] church you know this lady said she say
[1:06:57] they they not right and she's actually
[1:07:02] she's homosexual and she said that they
[1:07:06] not right if they go to church and and
[1:07:10] still living that lifestyle something
[1:07:12] wrong with him a homosexual lady say
[1:07:15] that she say we all know it's wrong a
[1:07:24] homosexual lady confesses out of mouth
[1:07:26] we all know this is wrong huh if that's
[1:07:33] what she said right I mean if that's
[1:07:36] what she's if that's what she said
[1:07:38] evidently if some people like that I
[1:07:40] believe that that this lifestyle is
[1:07:42] wrong why the church try to accept it
[1:07:51] these are signs of the time and when you
[1:07:54] start to notice death that's a good
[1:07:57] indicator that now it's a term that
[1:07:59] partying with everything you got you
[1:08:03] know church folk get offended oh lord
[1:08:08] have mercy
[1:08:09] Terk so will get offended you start
[1:08:11] talking like this this I mean I just
[1:08:13] read the quote to some it's a
[1:08:15] discouragement so over it's an
[1:08:17] encouragement but we're sorry y'all if
[1:08:21] you can discourage because I preach
[1:08:23] truth something wrong somewhere some
[1:08:29] some something went wrong somewhere you
[1:08:31] got to stop compromising with then it is
[1:08:35] wrong go that's right and I'll touch the
[1:08:37] homosexual stand it was wrong all right
[1:08:42] glory to God you know and I'll tell you
[1:08:46] what I when I hear something like that a
[1:08:47] person like that has a there's a there's
[1:08:50] a chance for them to go free from that
[1:08:52] spirit Oh Lord yeah I believe
[1:08:57] homosexuals can go free I believe drug
[1:09:00] addicts can go free huh
[1:09:04] I believe a man that that that that's
[1:09:07] constantly committing adultery can go
[1:09:09] free a woman that's constantly
[1:09:11] committing adultery she can go free
[1:09:13] Jesus delivered a woman that was in
[1:09:15] adultery I mean I believe that these
[1:09:20] people can't go free so I'm not closing
[1:09:22] as though on anybody but I'm saying that
[1:09:24] you can't you can't come a church and
[1:09:26] keep living in sin all right we talked
[1:09:31] about getting ready for the coming of
[1:09:32] the Lord which I've been a chosen
[1:09:34] generation all right I'm going on but I
[1:09:37] tell you you know when people when we
[1:09:40] start seeing all these signs of the time
[1:09:42] that should be that that's enough
[1:09:44] evidence to cause us to get in a hurry
[1:09:47] when it comes to the things of God all
[1:09:50] right look at this another quote here
[1:09:52] but the random says in the voice of the
[1:09:54] sign it says that now the time was at
[1:09:56] hand that God had made a promise
[1:09:59] Abraham four hundred years before that
[1:10:01] time that is he was sojourn in a strange
[1:10:04] land they would be brought out after 40
[1:10:08] years they would be brought out with a
[1:10:09] mighty hand he would deliver his people
[1:10:11] by mighty hand and when the time of the
[1:10:14] promised routinize that's when God put
[1:10:17] Moses on the scene Moses and his
[1:10:19] absolute failure had went into the
[1:10:22] wilderness
[1:10:23] now I paused on that a little bit Moses
[1:10:26] in his absolute failure hat went into
[1:10:32] the wilderness now if anybody know the
[1:10:35] message right we know that brother
[1:10:38] branham got to the port where he was so
[1:10:40] discouraged that he also wanted to go
[1:10:43] into the wilderness he saying he will be
[1:10:48] right down the street in the UH you know
[1:10:50] and I mean he's kind of sitting there
[1:10:52] thinking that you know I'll just come
[1:10:53] out here bring my wife out here and we
[1:10:55] will just you know we'll just we'll just
[1:10:57] be out here in the wilderness and any
[1:10:58] time God speak to me I leave the Lillis
[1:11:00] and I go back in and I preach what God
[1:11:02] time in the breach and he was just
[1:11:04] sitting there going through that in his
[1:11:05] mind and and then you know he went to a
[1:11:08] restaurant him and his son they sit down
[1:11:09] the restaurant this man happened to walk
[1:11:11] by and I think one guy sneeze and
[1:11:13] brother and say that man laid out of
[1:11:14] Steve's you knew he was a man right he
[1:11:17] said he said yes by the way he's nice
[1:11:19] and that's a man the way he sees -
[1:11:21] that's the kind of man I want to be but
[1:11:23] then they say here this guy come walk up
[1:11:25] in his son look up say daddy that look
[1:11:27] like you inflexion that's the life and
[1:11:29] they saying and the Lord just began to
[1:11:31] speak to him say now if you go and do
[1:11:33] what you want to do say your wife's
[1:11:35] gonna leave you if you go to the
[1:11:37] wielders say your wife don't leave you
[1:11:39] and say you gonna end up like a bum
[1:11:41] around a fire that's right so he had a
[1:11:45] desire to go to the will so here he's
[1:11:48] saying about Moses right say Moses an
[1:11:51] absolute failure and went to the
[1:11:53] wilderness if brother Branham had gone
[1:11:55] to the wilderness he would have been an
[1:11:57] absolute failure oh my
[1:12:02] see you know the same way God raised up
[1:12:05] a Moses to bring delivers to the
[1:12:07] children of Israel is the same way God
[1:12:09] raised up a prophet today to bring
[1:12:11] deliverance to the Bride of Christ
[1:12:13] Oh stay with me here it's the same exact
[1:12:18] thing it's not anything I'm telling you
[1:12:20] can go all in and out of Moses life you
[1:12:23] can see the types and brother brands
[1:12:24] like all through it right a man we know
[1:12:26] we know that this message is absolutely
[1:12:29] right you know I know people don't like
[1:12:31] for people us to say these things I know
[1:12:33] it offends folk I know it does not and
[1:12:37] I'm not saying this to offend anybody
[1:12:40] I'm saying this for truth sake the
[1:12:47] message is not an alternative to
[1:12:50] denominations it's not that you don't
[1:12:56] compare the message with denominations
[1:12:59] you don't whenever you start going down
[1:13:02] that thought process you miss the point
[1:13:04] of the message you hold you miss the
[1:13:08] whole message the message was to call us
[1:13:11] out of denomination and when it called
[1:13:14] us out I want to make us a new
[1:13:16] denomination everybody and I've been
[1:13:19] around a long time every brother that
[1:13:21] the rolls up to try to start another
[1:13:23] denomination it's falling apart because
[1:13:26] this cannot be denominated the holy
[1:13:30] ghost got control over this it'll never
[1:13:33] be denominator I don't care what anybody
[1:13:36] tries to do this will never be
[1:13:38] denominated now don't get me wrong you
[1:13:41] got people on the inside of this that
[1:13:44] got all kind of spirits on I'll be
[1:13:47] honest we haven't seen a lot in my day
[1:13:49] you wanna know what in the world the
[1:13:51] Holy Ghost produced that no the Holy
[1:13:53] Ghost didn't produce it didn't it didn't
[1:13:56] but don't get your eyes on the ones
[1:13:58] that's doing wrong and actually rather
[1:14:03] than spending so much time trying to
[1:14:05] fire one to the right be the one
[1:14:11] I found nobody you'll be the one that
[1:14:20] everybody else will follow beer that
[1:14:22] wine all right I'm going on in Jesus
[1:14:27] name
[1:14:27] I'm talk about a chosen generation he
[1:14:29] goes on to say they say let's listen say
[1:14:31] Moses and his absolute failure hat went
[1:14:34] into the will just now the type here
[1:14:37] there's a wonderful type that we sure
[1:14:40] don't want to miss see tight God was
[1:14:42] bringing Israel his people out a nation
[1:14:45] a nation out of a nation a nation out of
[1:14:48] a nation see the children Israel came
[1:14:50] out of Egypt that was a nation coming
[1:14:52] out of a nation hallelujah hope you with
[1:14:54] me right and and notice he says goes on
[1:14:57] says a beautiful type of today God is
[1:14:59] calling his bride out of a church
[1:15:01] Christian bride out of a Christian
[1:15:04] Church a bride church out of a church
[1:15:07] which is called in the Bible referred to
[1:15:09] now if we can look at that from a lot of
[1:15:12] different ways because we got you know
[1:15:14] we got the we got the bright coming out
[1:15:17] of the denominational Church now also
[1:15:19] you get that same denominational spirit
[1:15:20] in the message and you have the bride
[1:15:22] come out of that - glory to god I'm
[1:15:27] gonna say it again
[1:15:27] amen the bride comes out of the
[1:15:30] denominational Church but when that
[1:15:31] denominational spirit come into the
[1:15:33] message the bride will come out of that
[1:15:34] - that that's what's happening
[1:15:39] and God as God is doing the separating
[1:15:43] hallelujah church amen God doing the
[1:15:46] separating you you be wondering why this
[1:15:48] happened why'd it happen you know I was
[1:15:50] just sitting there thinking so you know
[1:15:51] God create situations pressure pressure
[1:15:59] get built up in situation even wonder
[1:16:01] why it's because God wants to move you
[1:16:04] and in order to move you he got to make
[1:16:08] you uncomfortable y'all heard the story
[1:16:11] of the eagle when it when it's time for
[1:16:14] the baby eagle it's a fly mama make the
[1:16:17] nest uncomfortable she take this silent
[1:16:20] 8:07 and I never felt that poked me like
[1:16:23] that before this
[1:16:24] yes yes it's the sameness right it's
[1:16:30] always been the same net but when you
[1:16:32] start taking this side and taking it out
[1:16:34] 9s ain't become very on councilman you
[1:16:37] have to get out and fly on your own
[1:16:40] anytime God making things uncomfortable
[1:16:42] in your life you get ready for a flight
[1:16:47] and I'm going to tell you right now
[1:16:49] there's many of us that are
[1:16:51] uncomfortable right now but get ready to
[1:16:54] fly Eagles don't get bound by the stall
[1:16:57] even spa barber school hurry somebody he
[1:17:03] was an art pal creatures heavenly
[1:17:07] creatures Oh glory to God Church glory
[1:17:11] to God a Manny Manny man I don't plan on
[1:17:15] being defeated in this hour I plan on
[1:17:17] having victory all right let me finish
[1:17:19] reading as if I can it says I got
[1:17:22] several notes from scriptures written
[1:17:23] down here on this blessed night it's
[1:17:24] called sometimes the chosen the elected
[1:17:28] or the remnant of the woman see it was
[1:17:30] called the bride what God by his
[1:17:33] foreknowledge ordained to be that is the
[1:17:35] bride comes out of the church see the
[1:17:39] whole thing is a church but God takes a
[1:17:42] people out of that church as a bride he
[1:17:47] said he would and he did it notice or he
[1:17:49] will do it now you know when I when I
[1:17:52] think about being a chosen generation
[1:17:53] brother branham you know just brings our
[1:17:55] attention Moses there you know how Moses
[1:17:59] they said Moses was a failure he as he
[1:18:03] went there into the wilderness he was an
[1:18:04] absolute failure and I bring you the
[1:18:06] type of brother branham had the same
[1:18:08] thoughts as Moses to Holy Ghost stopped
[1:18:10] him a man from going into the wilderness
[1:18:13] he want to do that Nagato so if you go
[1:18:15] you're going to lose your wife you're
[1:18:16] gonna lose everything he would have been
[1:18:17] an absolute failure had he done it so we
[1:18:20] see these types here but when I think
[1:18:21] about you know Moses coming on the scene
[1:18:23] and I think about the generations that
[1:18:27] lived in bondage there in Egypt you know
[1:18:30] I believe about ten generations of
[1:18:33] people that lived in bondage because the
[1:18:34] generation is represented by 40 years
[1:18:38] right 40 years represents a generation
[1:18:40] now we have to be careful with that
[1:18:42] because you know there's a statement I
[1:18:43] was I was looking for this one quote and
[1:18:45] I just found it this morning
[1:18:47] Amen as I was as I went to pick up my
[1:18:49] precious brother to bring him to church
[1:18:50] I'm listening to the tape from brother
[1:18:52] Branham make the make the statement on
[1:18:53] the table I'm like all praise God that's
[1:18:55] what I've been looking for right but
[1:18:57] what he was saying is that every day a
[1:18:59] generation fades away now we look at
[1:19:03] generations that's 40 years being a
[1:19:05] generation but every day a generation
[1:19:07] fades away you know why because every
[1:19:10] day somebody you know might be turning
[1:19:12] 40 or 41 or whatever and you moving onto
[1:19:14] something else or somebody passes away
[1:19:16] it's a generation phase away everything
[1:19:19] you are I mean when we when we look at
[1:19:21] this we try to try to put everybody in
[1:19:24] the same bucket but God got a set up as
[1:19:26] individuals right and so he said every
[1:19:29] day a generation is fading away
[1:19:32] so as I'm preaching this this I mean
[1:19:34] some us may go home before the coming of
[1:19:36] the Lord but there's somebody research
[1:19:39] that not going go home before the coming
[1:19:41] of the Lord their generation will not
[1:19:44] pass until everything people feel and I
[1:19:48] don't know about you but I'm putting
[1:19:49] myself in that generation I'm attack
[1:19:52] when you put yourself in that generation
[1:19:54] it causes you to live differently it
[1:19:59] causes you to respond to think
[1:20:01] differently when you put yourself in
[1:20:03] dajin
[1:20:04] I'm in the generation that will not pass
[1:20:06] until all things be fulfilled I'm in a
[1:20:10] generation that will catch the rapture
[1:20:12] I'm a part of that generation when you
[1:20:16] being that when you begin to look at
[1:20:18] life a man from that lens Church I tell
[1:20:21] you you don't have time to waste with
[1:20:24] the devil you don't have you don't have
[1:20:26] any time to waste with the devil you
[1:20:28] really want to give God everything you
[1:20:30] got and I'm gonna tell you this much if
[1:20:31] I die before Jesus return I'm going down
[1:20:35] with a promise I'm going down with a
[1:20:38] promise
[1:20:39] I died believing on it died waiting on
[1:20:42] it and saying I'm going to come up
[1:20:43] believing that the dead and Christ gonna
[1:20:45] rise first and you which I allow to
[1:20:47] remain I'm going to be caught up to meet
[1:20:49] y'all in the air we'll see Christ
[1:20:51] together
[1:20:52] I'm going I'm going down on a promise
[1:20:54] but imma live every day like it's my
[1:20:56] last day I'm a part of a chosen
[1:21:01] generation
[1:21:01] I thought about Israel 10 generations
[1:21:06] that we're waiting for delivers to come
[1:21:10] a man they're the bondage that they went
[1:21:13] through and you know I wrote the
[1:21:14] children Israel would have been they
[1:21:16] would have thought that they were the
[1:21:17] chosen ones in their day 400 years of
[1:21:21] bondage having the opportunity to
[1:21:23] finally be released from the Egyptians
[1:21:26] and that final generation that left age
[1:21:28] of oh my god they knew that they were
[1:21:31] the chosen generation can you imagine
[1:21:34] all the you know all the weapons they
[1:21:36] got all the beatings that they got all
[1:21:39] all the long nights all the hard days
[1:21:41] but but here comes a time where Moses
[1:21:44] comes in and God gives them a mighty
[1:21:47] delivers day with a thought of
[1:21:48] themselves that we must be the chosen
[1:21:52] generation but think about it think
[1:21:58] about this to generate what generation
[1:22:00] to live in to see the place strike Egypt
[1:22:02] to see the Death Angel pass through the
[1:22:04] land to strike the homes of those who
[1:22:06] have not followed the words of the
[1:22:08] prophet Moses they experienced the
[1:22:10] delivers they experienced the parting of
[1:22:13] the Red Sea they experiencing the death
[1:22:15] to the Egyptians I love Moses were say
[1:22:18] the Egyptians that you're seeing today
[1:22:19] you'll see him no more forever they
[1:22:21] experienced him those those those
[1:22:23] Egyptians died there a man in the Red
[1:22:26] Sea but that generation that would have
[1:22:28] thought that they were the chosen
[1:22:29] generation was the same generation that
[1:22:33] died wandering in the wilderness rather
[1:22:37] than enjoying the Bliss of the land
[1:22:39] flowing with milk and honey
[1:22:41] that generation fell to enter the
[1:22:43] promised land but gave birth to a new
[1:22:46] generation a generation that did go in a
[1:22:49] man and enjoy the blessings of the
[1:22:52] promised land Church I tell you what you
[1:22:54] know even when we think about that and
[1:22:57] we just compare it to today there was I
[1:22:59] mean the generation that saw the Prophet
[1:23:02] the generation that was here a man to be
[1:23:05] a part of the meeting
[1:23:06] that generation a man that that I mean
[1:23:09] some of the testimony that they share
[1:23:11] with us that gives us strength I mean
[1:23:13] even now but you know what there were
[1:23:15] still many in that generation that that
[1:23:18] went to the meetings that still did not
[1:23:20] understand the ministry of the Prophet
[1:23:22] all glory hallelujah as you know I've
[1:23:26] been reading a little bit and you know
[1:23:28] and and in my reading I just been
[1:23:30] finding that not only was brother
[1:23:32] Branham he wasn't only when they had a
[1:23:34] tent that was going around from city to
[1:23:36] city and preaching there were so many
[1:23:38] others doing it and getting results Oral
[1:23:42] Roberts had a tent that would see 12,000
[1:23:44] people and they were filling up and get
[1:23:48] results hallelujah
[1:23:50] right I mean they were other great men
[1:23:52] of God our Billy Graham had a tent go
[1:23:55] around and he got his fill up stadiums
[1:23:57] with people and it got all califo coming
[1:24:00] down to the altar the resent my they had
[1:24:03] that but with nowhere I looked at that
[1:24:05] because you know uh if I was to be
[1:24:07] honest you know there were there were
[1:24:08] many about our forefathers I want you to
[1:24:11] just kind of stay with me there are many
[1:24:13] of our forefathers that were underneath
[1:24:15] some of those tents and when they went
[1:24:18] underneath some of them said some of the
[1:24:19] things that they saw God do they can't
[1:24:22] get those things out of their mind
[1:24:23] they want to see God do the exact same
[1:24:25] thing again today but we're living in
[1:24:27] the time now it's hard to set up a tent
[1:24:29] like that things have changed you just
[1:24:33] can't go from city to city property you
[1:24:35] might get Amen some authority coming to
[1:24:39] such a tech town but you don't have the
[1:24:41] freedom to move like that anymore the
[1:24:43] nation has changed everything has
[1:24:46] changed because we're in a new
[1:24:47] generation and then this generation this
[1:24:49] is a generation that's going to see the
[1:24:51] coming of the Lord
[1:24:54] oftentimes we think in our minds like
[1:24:56] Lord I would have loved to been back
[1:24:58] there underneath the tent I would have
[1:25:00] loved to been there saw the blinded eyes
[1:25:03] come open I would have loved to have
[1:25:06] been there and you know I mean brother
[1:25:08] branham explains how that the work the
[1:25:09] one young girl comes up leaving for and
[1:25:12] she has no eyes in a socket not just
[1:25:17] blind no eyeballs at all
[1:25:19] none whatsoever and here she comes to
[1:25:23] the prayer line to be playful and
[1:25:24] brother branham prays for the young lady
[1:25:27] and in the middle of his prayer he stops
[1:25:31] and he looks at the young lady and he
[1:25:34] says I forgot to ask you
[1:25:36] I'll talk about a girl that got no eyes
[1:25:39] I forgot to ask you what color eyes who
[1:25:43] you won't and the girl of the girl say I
[1:25:48] want it I forget what color she said I
[1:25:50] wanted this and I said okay okay bow
[1:25:53] your head let's pray and he prays it
[1:25:55] right down the spot the eyes begin to
[1:25:58] fall and the girl got to face the color
[1:26:00] that she requested we had people that
[1:26:03] were our witnesses that saw these things
[1:26:05] right I mean you I mean who or what us I
[1:26:08] mean my god you want to get everything
[1:26:10] you had to get in services like that you
[1:26:15] were the took time off your job to get
[1:26:17] in services like that Oh hallelujah
[1:26:22] right we would have did everything we
[1:26:25] anything possible I got to be in this
[1:26:28] service there were men that would drive
[1:26:30] all the way from Georgia to Indiana
[1:26:35] right just on the weekend just to be in
[1:26:38] the service because they knew any time a
[1:26:41] man they got together God was going to
[1:26:44] move when you listen to the tapes you
[1:26:46] can hear I don't no matter what the
[1:26:49] sermon is no matter how deep it is no
[1:26:52] matter how shallow it is it doesn't
[1:26:54] matter the angel the Lord always showed
[1:26:57] up whatever city was him the age of the
[1:27:01] Lord was right there you would alone to
[1:27:04] be in something like that even all
[1:27:08] robbers was saying how one time he had a
[1:27:10] school of blind like nine blind kids
[1:27:12] came to his meetings and he sent there
[1:27:15] and he were praying and he prayed and
[1:27:17] all nine of them received in sight
[1:27:19] nine now you know people people thought
[1:27:22] I haven't got moving and that generation
[1:27:25] I just knew that they were man we are a
[1:27:27] chosen generation who who else has laid
[1:27:30] awake sight on things like this
[1:27:32] but when Peter writes these things he's
[1:27:35] not talking to that generation Peter
[1:27:38] writes this for us ones that didn't see
[1:27:42] it with our eyes ones that didn't
[1:27:45] experience those type of meetings and
[1:27:47] sometimes because of the experience of
[1:27:49] the meetings Amen if we would be honest
[1:27:51] with ourselves we lonely lonely be a
[1:27:54] part of that sometimes the devil would
[1:27:56] discourage you and make you feel like
[1:27:58] God ain't even doing nothing no more
[1:28:00] because you just hear about a little
[1:28:02] miracle here and another one there and
[1:28:05] the number it's just it's just except
[1:28:07] that it's a sign that the season has
[1:28:09] changed but God didn't change just a
[1:28:13] season change hallelujah
[1:28:16] God is still God and if you have a need
[1:28:19] he's able to meet your needs
[1:28:21] glory to God we might not have ten
[1:28:24] floors 12,000 coming to attend right but
[1:28:27] but when you look at when you look at
[1:28:28] you know of those things that was that
[1:28:30] was for that season now God has moved
[1:28:32] into another season
[1:28:33] I was bringing in how you know Peter you
[1:28:36] know when you just think about him
[1:28:38] writing such words as this how could why
[1:28:41] would Peter say ye our chosen generation
[1:28:43] and I just I just began to really
[1:28:46] meditate on Petersons are Peter went
[1:28:48] through a lot Peter himself was there a
[1:28:51] man when Jesus walked the earth Peter
[1:28:54] was in his meetings Dina was there to
[1:28:56] see five thousands get there
[1:28:59] Peter's data feed four thousand get
[1:29:01] there Peter saw summits Peter also
[1:29:04] walked on water the only man that got
[1:29:09] born just like us that walked away Jesus
[1:29:12] walk Peter walked on water yet he might
[1:29:16] have some but he also walked and you
[1:29:21] would think that you would think that if
[1:29:23] Deena's experiencing things that Peter
[1:29:25] would say I am the chosen generation but
[1:29:29] Peter I sees weren't sixty years after
[1:29:32] Jesus had time Peter says ye are a
[1:29:37] chosen generation think about it I want
[1:29:41] you to really think about it what is it
[1:29:44] that Peter seeing you know I was
[1:29:46] I was just going through Peter encounter
[1:29:48] Christ and Luke five when he took a lot
[1:29:51] out into the deep end drop his net Club
[1:29:53] drop drop Peter saw what God could do
[1:29:55] for him Peter saw Christ healed his
[1:29:58] mother-in-law he was so sick with a
[1:30:00] fever and and one prayer changed things
[1:30:02] just like that she was up serving every
[1:30:04] rider Peter saw that with his own life
[1:30:06] Peter walked on water heated up when
[1:30:10] Christ was being taken to be crucified
[1:30:12] Peter was the one that did not him in
[1:30:14] curse while doing it Peter was there a
[1:30:18] man when Jesus rose again he he went and
[1:30:21] told us
[1:30:21] I mean it's total women that he's risen
[1:30:24] and told her something I go tell my
[1:30:26] disciples
[1:30:26] and tell Pina that I'm Lissa hallelujah
[1:30:30] six peter was commanded to feed the
[1:30:33] sheep and the Lambs he was a part of a
[1:30:35] generation that experienced the
[1:30:37] outpouring of the Holy Ghost at
[1:30:39] Pentecost Peter did all this and you
[1:30:43] would have pump but sure that this man
[1:30:45] was the part of the chosen generation
[1:30:46] but after all the things that occurred
[1:30:49] Peter likes ye our chosen generation why
[1:30:55] would Peter write these things why would
[1:30:58] Peter write these things because I
[1:31:02] believe Peter got a glimpse of the
[1:31:03] second coming of the Lord hallelujah and
[1:31:07] that glimpse of the second coming of the
[1:31:10] Lord
[1:31:10] it caused Peter to live under
[1:31:12] expectation come on church because when
[1:31:16] you get a glimpse of the second coming
[1:31:18] Lord you will begin to live under
[1:31:20] expectation amen everything say I appear
[1:31:23] to begin to live on expectation and then
[1:31:26] he was there when Jesus spoke and he was
[1:31:28] also there when the angel spoke I want
[1:31:31] to break that down Matthew 17 Matthew 17
[1:31:35] glory to God glory to God glory to God
[1:31:38] now there's a lot here in Matthew 17 I'm
[1:31:41] just trying to hit the highlights Peter
[1:31:43] what Peter writes that ye are a children
[1:31:46] generation the reason that Peter could
[1:31:48] write this is because Peter got a
[1:31:50] glimpse of the second coming of the Lord
[1:31:52] and he's looking at that generation that
[1:31:55] would be on earth at the time of Jesus
[1:31:58] second coming
[1:31:59] and they say ye are chosen generation
[1:32:02] you're chosen because you got to be
[1:32:04] experiencing the second coming of the
[1:32:06] Lord oh it's not just going to be a word
[1:32:09] that somebody shared but it's going to
[1:32:11] be a manifestation in the moment in the
[1:32:14] twinkling of eye you're going to be
[1:32:16] changed
[1:32:17] Oh glory to God the LAT the last the
[1:32:22] last thing you know that we're waiting
[1:32:23] on is a change another body and church
[1:32:26] we're living in that generation where we
[1:32:28] can expect at any time now oh yeah I
[1:32:33] believe that I'm a part of this chosen
[1:32:36] generation I'm a royal priesthood I'm a
[1:32:40] holy nation I'm a peculiar people glory
[1:32:43] to God listen listen to what the
[1:32:46] scripture says in Matthew 17 let's read
[1:32:47] says that after six days Jesus taketh
[1:32:49] Peter James and John his brother and
[1:32:53] bringeth them up into the high mountain
[1:32:54] apart and was transfigured before them
[1:32:57] and it's faith this shine as the Sun and
[1:33:00] his raiment was white as the light and
[1:33:03] behold there appeared unto them Moses
[1:33:06] and Elijah talking with him now can you
[1:33:09] imagine Peter standing there looking at
[1:33:11] this and as Peters looking at this dis
[1:33:13] imeem never seen this happen before and
[1:33:16] I must be a part of a chosen generation
[1:33:18] look at look at where I am one of the
[1:33:22] only Witnesses on the earth to see
[1:33:23] something like this but yet Peter
[1:33:26] doesn't call himself the chill
[1:33:27] generation he calls you that
[1:33:29] oh my church we don't know how special
[1:33:33] we are we don't we don't realize how
[1:33:36] special we weren't here when Jesus was
[1:33:38] here we weren't here when the Prophet
[1:33:41] was here we weren't here when Paul was
[1:33:45] here we weren't here when Moses and
[1:33:47] Elijah and all of them we weren't here
[1:33:49] but nonetheless we are without all the
[1:33:57] signs wonders and miracles do you mean
[1:34:00] now I'ma just drop this in do you
[1:34:02] realize that sermon the Baptist was
[1:34:04] called the greatest of all all the
[1:34:06] prophets until that time he was the
[1:34:09] greatest of all the prophets and he
[1:34:11] never worked one me
[1:34:15] he was the greatest without a miracle
[1:34:18] being word we would think look at what
[1:34:20] he lodges did Colin fired an affirmance
[1:34:22] that's got to be a great profit but
[1:34:24] Jesus and that German fact there was no
[1:34:28] light German abductors he was the
[1:34:30] greatest until that time he was the
[1:34:34] greatest and the reason John the Baptist
[1:34:36] was the greatest is because he
[1:34:38] introduced the Messiah the first coming
[1:34:41] of the Messiah and the reason keeps a go
[1:34:44] to the past because brother branham's
[1:34:46] ministry was to introduce Messiah a
[1:34:48] second time and the people that are
[1:34:52] living waiting for Messiah they are a
[1:34:55] chosen generation Alleluia somebody if
[1:35:03] we knew who are just some time I just
[1:35:06] Lord let me really think about this what
[1:35:08] did you call me to without miracles if I
[1:35:11] did if I've never saw a miracle I'm
[1:35:13] still the chosen generation but we are
[1:35:16] seeing miracles we are seeing miracles
[1:35:19] we just we got our precious let's just
[1:35:22] shared about the doctors finding nothing
[1:35:24] that's a miracle my daddy was a miracle
[1:35:28] i'ma still share his testimony you know
[1:35:32] but you should mind my daddy had it God
[1:35:35] gave him testimony before he called him
[1:35:37] home God God God actually showed my
[1:35:40] daddy he was calling him home he showed
[1:35:43] him he had a dream before he even left
[1:35:45] and daddy went back in his mind I mean
[1:35:48] the dream God took him back to his early
[1:35:50] childhood years took him through his
[1:35:52] teenage years took him through his 20s
[1:35:55] took him through 30s he just he just
[1:35:56] start replaying his whole life and he
[1:35:58] was in his 60s and when he got to 70 he
[1:36:02] said everything went dark everything
[1:36:05] went dark
[1:36:05] he couldn't see no further than 70 God
[1:36:10] let him get to 71 and called him home
[1:36:12] that was God telling him what he was
[1:36:14] doing for him and I would tell you my
[1:36:17] daddy went down with a promise and
[1:36:18] before he went down with the promise he
[1:36:20] showed the devil that he could overcome
[1:36:23] cancer
[1:36:26] so that that way I get no victory no
[1:36:32] whatsoever I know what God my family
[1:36:35] experience the healing power of God went
[1:36:39] when the angel or total throw the
[1:36:40] problem say say say not even can't will
[1:36:44] stand in the way of your prayer O glory
[1:36:47] and as my daddy was leavin he just
[1:36:49] singing walk in the light beautiful
[1:36:53] that's a testimony glory to God some of
[1:37:04] y'all hang on taste test and the reason
[1:37:08] you're not because you're part of a
[1:37:09] chosen generation oh my I got a hold me
[1:37:14] a so many quotes I can't read them all
[1:37:15] brother Brennan said he says it says if
[1:37:17] I'm not one that will actually
[1:37:19] experience that I want to preach to
[1:37:21] young people that will experience it
[1:37:25] that's not close we are I want to preach
[1:37:28] the young people that will experience it
[1:37:30] you are living in a day where Jesus is
[1:37:33] coming at any time so if you're living
[1:37:37] in that day live right live right
[1:37:44] Matthew 17 first verse verse 3 behold
[1:37:49] there appeared unto them Moses and
[1:37:51] Elijah talking with him then
[1:37:54] then after Peter and said unto unto
[1:37:56] Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here
[1:37:58] if thou wilt let us make here three
[1:38:00] times and ackles one 4d1 by Moses
[1:38:04] wonderful Iser he's so excited Peter
[1:38:07] seeing I'm seeing Moses my daddy told me
[1:38:10] about Moses I only heard about Elijah
[1:38:14] through my reading what might what they
[1:38:16] taught me but I'm seeing this with my
[1:38:18] own eyes you would think Peter would
[1:38:19] feel like he's the chosen generation
[1:38:22] look at it and while he yet spake behold
[1:38:25] a bright cloud overshadowed them and
[1:38:27] behold a voice out of cloud which said
[1:38:29] this is my beloved Son in whom I am well
[1:38:31] pleased hear you him don't build no
[1:38:34] Tabernacles here Peter don't do that
[1:38:36] Peter get so excited
[1:38:37] so excited it was always like that I
[1:38:40] mean if you went back to the previous
[1:38:43] chapter
[1:38:43] Peter Peter was given the keys of the
[1:38:46] kingdom of heaven right and he told me
[1:38:49] whatever you bind on earth shall be
[1:38:50] bound and had whatever you loose on
[1:38:51] earth shall be loosed in heaven I mean
[1:38:53] Peter just because he had a mighty
[1:38:54] revelation that he was the Christ a
[1:38:56] subtle Living God
[1:38:57] Peter Peter received just you know
[1:38:59] receive the keys but a few verses later
[1:39:03] Peter sitting there and Jesus telling
[1:39:06] that he's gonna have to die too got to
[1:39:07] do this and Peter said no no I rebuke
[1:39:09] that jesus said get thee behind me Satan
[1:39:11] the same guy that just got keys in the
[1:39:15] same guy that's being told Satan has
[1:39:17] anointed him Oh Lord I hope we get that
[1:39:21] the same guy that just got keys is the
[1:39:24] same guy he got blessed by Jesus and
[1:39:27] anointed by Satan always in the same day
[1:39:33] now y'all get met blessed by Jesus
[1:39:39] blessed are thou simon barjona flesh and
[1:39:41] blood have not revealed it unto thee he
[1:39:43] does say that and nobody else
[1:39:45] it says Peter and upon this rock the
[1:39:49] rock of Revelation I'll build my church
[1:39:50] and the gates of Hell cannot prevail
[1:39:52] mighty mighty service but after church
[1:40:01] after church fellowshipping just having
[1:40:06] a little conversation the same guy that
[1:40:08] thought he had so much revelation man on
[1:40:11] Jesus wit not what you just said is off
[1:40:13] the word I ain't I ain't going for that
[1:40:14] Jesus no I'm not that's up get thee
[1:40:17] behind me Satan but he didn't call Peter
[1:40:19] Satan he just that state was anointed
[1:40:23] Peter and you got to know when stateless
[1:40:25] anointing people Oh glory
[1:40:30] you you you have to know these things if
[1:40:33] they not a devil you ain't calling them
[1:40:36] a devil no they sons and daughters of
[1:40:38] God but it's a double anointing that and
[1:40:43] then you just to get me behind me Satan
[1:40:46] cuz I ain't going back into that
[1:40:48] lifestyle o Church of the Living God
[1:40:53] listen I want to go on here Peter the
[1:40:58] reason Peter could say that ye are
[1:41:01] chosen generations because Peter got a
[1:41:03] glimpse of the second coming of the Lord
[1:41:06] and what we're seeing here Matthew 17 is
[1:41:08] a glimpse of the second coming of the
[1:41:10] Lord
[1:41:10] now there's I'm just reading these watch
[1:41:12] this verse 5 while he yet spake behold a
[1:41:16] bright cloud overshadowed them and
[1:41:17] behold a voice out of the cloud which
[1:41:18] said this is my beloved Son in whom I am
[1:41:20] well pleased see you him and when the
[1:41:22] disciples heard it they fell on their
[1:41:23] face and were sore free can I can I just
[1:41:26] drop something in right there there used
[1:41:29] to be a time in my and my my Christian
[1:41:34] journey
[1:41:34] I used to use I used to question why
[1:41:37] people be falling out in the spirit
[1:41:39] isn't that biblical because when we've
[1:41:41] kind of focus laying they have sheets
[1:41:43] although just throwing this on them
[1:41:46] thrown I mean they had sheets for
[1:41:47] everybody sheets in the in the chairs
[1:41:50] always did sisters had to be ready with
[1:41:52] a sheet y'all saw y'all stop my wife you
[1:41:58] last week she had to be ready that best
[1:42:03] way we was trained did y'all see that
[1:42:05] one sister got the singing real good and
[1:42:08] she got the singing and when she was
[1:42:10] stumbling as a little boy who she you
[1:42:13] know this this gonna be something and
[1:42:15] and and I saw I'll just look at see well
[1:42:18] who's gonna do what what is everybody
[1:42:20] and I think everybody else be sitting
[1:42:21] having the same on thought who gonna do
[1:42:23] when wife got on up and just kind of you
[1:42:25] know see training that that's what we
[1:42:28] used to do but when they used to come
[1:42:30] back in that day they came with a white
[1:42:31] sheet so they come like this and they
[1:42:34] have a white sheet they take that they

[1:49:52] I'm trying to get you to see you you you
[1:49:55] you are the chosen generation chosen
[1:49:59] look at it it's verse 6 and when the
[1:50:03] disciples heard it they fell on their
[1:50:05] faces I was saying that I used to
[1:50:07] question how why would people be
[1:50:10] followed on the spirit but one brother
[1:50:12] shared me say now there is many times in
[1:50:14] the Bible where they fell on their faces
[1:50:15] that means they was in the spirit and
[1:50:17] when the Spirit of God gets so real to
[1:50:20] you
[1:50:20] you'll following your face - now let it
[1:50:28] be the spirit though because I have been
[1:50:30] into some churches they even in the
[1:50:33] spirit they just come soon as they come
[1:50:34] get out the car come sit in the front
[1:50:36] seat first song go play they lay on
[1:50:39] their face I'm like what what are you
[1:50:42] doing
[1:50:43] who's this it's just all lucky in the
[1:50:47] spirit no not that I don't think that's
[1:50:49] it you don't practice that you know I'm
[1:50:52] playing that that ain't that anyway
[1:50:53] that's work I'll talk about when the
[1:50:55] Holy Ghost get ahold of you I don't see
[1:51:00] the Holy Ghost get ahold of people and
[1:51:02] it's like when they fall the chair just
[1:51:05] move out the way
[1:51:05] and people don't get hurt when the Holy
[1:51:09] Ghost is
[1:51:12] all right
[1:51:14] praise the Lord all right let me go in
[1:51:18] and when the disciples heard they fell
[1:51:19] in phases I'm so free and Jesus came and
[1:51:22] touched him and said arise and be not
[1:51:25] afraid and when they lifted up their
[1:51:27] eyes they saw no man save Jesus only see
[1:51:31] let's go on send as they came down from
[1:51:33] the mountain Jesus charged them saying
[1:51:35] tell the vision of no man until the Son
[1:51:37] of Man be risen again from the dead and
[1:51:39] his disciple of Aksum saying why then
[1:51:40] say the scribes that Elijah must first
[1:51:42] come now notice is the scripture jesus
[1:51:47] answered and said unto them Elisha truly
[1:51:50] shall first come and restore all things
[1:51:54] they are speaking of two different
[1:51:56] comings of Elijah as I go on verse 12
[1:51:59] says but I stand through that Elijah has
[1:52:00] come already now we got Jesus Jesus said
[1:52:04] in logic truly shall first come and then
[1:52:06] we also got Jesus saying he'll I've just
[1:52:08] come already they had to know which
[1:52:10] Elijah he was talking about and today we
[1:52:13] got to know which Elijah he's talking
[1:52:15] about now they caught it they caught it
[1:52:19] because the Bible said it called it look
[1:52:21] at this but I've sent me that lives have
[1:52:23] come already and they knew him not but
[1:52:25] have done unto him whatsoever they
[1:52:26] listed likewise shall also the Son of
[1:52:28] man suffer them didn't the cyclist
[1:52:29] understood it but he spake unto them a
[1:52:34] John the Baptist now he never called his
[1:52:37] name but they understood it and from
[1:52:40] when he said Elijah truly shall first
[1:52:42] come and restore all things that was
[1:52:44] brother branham's ministry that's why I
[1:52:46] say this is not an alternative to
[1:52:47] denomination this was the restoration of
[1:52:50] all things Peter got a glimpse of the
[1:52:57] second coming of the Lord he was right
[1:52:59] there let me read a quote for you a
[1:53:01] couple of them patmans vision and Peter
[1:53:05] get with this glimpse of the coming of
[1:53:07] the Lord
[1:53:08] second coming of the Lord he could call
[1:53:10] you the chosen generation look at this
[1:53:14] the patents of interstate now notice
[1:53:15] before Jesus returns to earth now this
[1:53:19] is a little ahead of time but the spirit
[1:53:21] of Elijah will return back to the earth
[1:53:23] and
[1:53:23] in the hearts of the children back to
[1:53:24] the fathers says uh the Bible said so
[1:53:28] Jesus saw him Jesus saw him here the
[1:53:32] pasta saw him here the order of the
[1:53:35] coming of the Son of man glorified he
[1:53:38] used to be glorified and coming back the
[1:53:40] first thing before they saw him was what
[1:53:42] Elijah and what Moses Israel returning
[1:53:46] yonder the lawkeepers and then the
[1:53:48] glorified son of man hallelujah do you
[1:53:51] see the order of his coming the spirit
[1:53:53] of Elijah or the witness of the last
[1:53:55] church age see coming in power to
[1:53:58] manifest him now I'm going to go a
[1:54:00] little further I want to I got another
[1:54:02] quote Revelation chapter 4 that I want
[1:54:04] to read on that but one when we think
[1:54:07] about this just by what Peter saw in
[1:54:09] Matthew 17 when he saw Moses and Elijah
[1:54:11] talked with him that was representative
[1:54:13] of what we see today
[1:54:14] oh my church we're seeing it I just
[1:54:19] preached a few months ago how the Jews
[1:54:21] are recognizing that brother Branham was
[1:54:24] the fulfillment fulfillment of Malachi 4
[1:54:27] Jews have started recognizing that the
[1:54:31] Jews will follow Moses and Elijah oh but
[1:54:37] before Jesus comes glorified I mean
[1:54:39] we're gonna see we gotta see this pretty
[1:54:42] real Isaac comes to earth we've already
[1:54:43] saw it already happened in brother
[1:54:44] Branham oh my god
[1:54:46] Peter saw these things and when he's
[1:54:48] when he saw he called you a chosen
[1:54:51] generation you weren't here to see the
[1:54:53] Prophet but just here to see the things
[1:54:55] that the things that the Prophet
[1:54:57] promised would be fulfilled they're
[1:54:58] being manifested amen you are chosen
[1:55:02] generation revelation 4 this is the
[1:55:06] message Revelation chapter 4 he says
[1:55:08] John called and summoned by the Lord
[1:55:11] Jesus promised by God back there that he
[1:55:14] would see the coming of the Son of man
[1:55:16] Peter James and John and them standing
[1:55:19] present when Jesus spoke to him said
[1:55:22] there's something stat there some
[1:55:24] standing year will not taste of death
[1:55:26] until they see the Son of man coming he
[1:55:29] didn't say all was standing here but
[1:55:32] and they went few days after that and
[1:55:35] saw the order of the resurrection
[1:55:37] rehearsed listen and the coming of the
[1:55:41] Lord Peter got a glimpse of this right
[1:55:43] Elisha represent it he says I mean Moses
[1:55:47] and being resurrected Elisha represented
[1:55:49] the translated punch he was saying Moses
[1:55:52] represented the dead Saints right here
[1:55:53] Stan
[1:55:54] but Elisha represented the translated
[1:55:56] bunch those that have died in Christ
[1:55:57] right since remember Moses was first in
[1:56:00] large it was to be the messenger of the
[1:56:03] last day that with him and his group
[1:56:06] would come the resurrection well it
[1:56:08] would come to come come the rapture I
[1:56:10] mean Moses brought in the resurrection
[1:56:12] and Elijah brought in the rapture group
[1:56:16] whoa my Moses brought in the
[1:56:20] resurrection but Elijah brought in the
[1:56:22] rapture group there both of them was
[1:56:25] represented right there
[1:56:27] here Peter got a glimpse of the coming
[1:56:30] of the second coming of the Lord and in
[1:56:32] being able to see that he could write
[1:56:34] these words to you ye are the chosen
[1:56:39] generation if you never experience
[1:56:43] another miracle which I believe you will
[1:56:45] but if you never do you're still a part
[1:56:49] of the chosen generation if you never
[1:56:53] see the blinded eyes come open you're
[1:56:56] still a part of the chosen generation if
[1:57:02] you never you know asea
[1:57:04] like and brother brown's day you know
[1:57:06] maybe a man with a club foot one foot
[1:57:09] shorter than the other and then right
[1:57:10] down the spot the foot begin to grow
[1:57:13] it's still a part of a chosen generation
[1:57:15] we got to keep it balanced I'm not
[1:57:18] saying that we should look for these
[1:57:19] things because I'll tell you what if I'm
[1:57:21] going through something I'm looking for
[1:57:22] God to bring me healing and I'm gonna
[1:57:24] confess every promise that he spoke over
[1:57:25] me but we talk about massive campaigns
[1:57:29] 12,000 people being under 10 and and
[1:57:33] seeing all kind of things happen like
[1:57:34] that we probably won't see that God has
[1:57:36] changed the season that's changed from
[1:57:38] that but nonetheless we are part of this
[1:57:41] chosen generation I think about
[1:57:49] just so much to happen in brother
[1:57:52] branham's days so many things even be
[1:57:54] even right before it got called him on
[1:57:56] the field I think of the generation that
[1:57:59] lived to experience this Sousa Street
[1:58:00] revival the ones that experienced the
[1:58:04] Welsh revival a policeman so full of the
[1:58:08] Spirit of God huh
[1:58:10] so full of the Spirit of God that that
[1:58:13] when people come from all over flying
[1:58:15] ants they sir they look in action for
[1:58:17] directions they didn't have Google back
[1:58:18] then they had to stop an extra
[1:58:21] directions they were they you know they
[1:58:23] actual direction they say say sir could
[1:58:25] you tell me how to get to the lost
[1:58:27] revival look and a policeman I wonder if
[1:58:31] we have some policemen on the force
[1:58:32] today that could do stuff like that the
[1:58:34] policemen say sir you're looking at the
[1:58:37] Welsh revival
[1:58:38] I am the Welsh revival you're looking
[1:58:43] for a building that was revival inside
[1:58:45] of me maybe they thought they had
[1:58:47] arrived what a generation look at a
[1:58:52] mighty move of the Spirit of God amongst
[1:58:54] the people those revivals gave birth to
[1:58:56] another generation that saw people moved
[1:58:58] from tent to tent to experience the
[1:59:00] presence of God there were great healing
[1:59:03] revival sweep of the nations Jack Cole
[1:59:05] or Roberts Billy Graham Tommy Hicks TL
[1:59:09] Osborn are just some of the ministers
[1:59:11] that we use but it goes on here even the
[1:59:14] Prophet was on the scene during this
[1:59:16] mighty tent revival many experienced the
[1:59:19] presence of Christ and his leanings as
[1:59:21] was seen in Scripture he revealed the
[1:59:23] secrets of the hearts revealed the
[1:59:25] mysteries of God eyewitnesses a still
[1:59:27] alive who either saw the angel or felt
[1:59:29] his presence some experienced a blast
[1:59:31] that shook the rocks in Sunset Mountain
[1:59:34] seven angels had come to Commission the
[1:59:36] Prophet to go east and preach success
[1:59:38] the seven seals
[1:59:39] what testimonies we have them blessed a
[1:59:41] here but that generation was not the
[1:59:44] climax God had another generation that
[1:59:49] was coming along to experience the
[1:59:51] greatest event that will ever happen on
[1:59:55] the earth and that event is the second
[1:59:57] coming of the Lord
[1:59:59] it was predestinated for this chosen
[2:00:03] generation church I don't know about you
[2:00:09] but I'm so glad that I can say I'm one
[2:00:14] of them
[2:00:15] oh I'm one of them I'm one of them let
[2:00:22] me finish by reading just a couple
[2:00:23] quotes here oh I know who I am I know
[2:00:27] who I am this is out of one in a million
[2:00:30] and also I read the seven compound names
[2:00:33] of Jehovah look at this the Prophet says
[2:00:37] there's approximately 500 million
[2:00:39] so-called Christians in the world today
[2:00:42] notice and each day I generate that each
[2:00:46] day and a generation and now what if the
[2:00:52] wraptor would come today and 500 people
[2:00:54] university would be taken in the rapture
[2:00:56] you would never know or even see in the
[2:00:59] paper of them going and the coming of
[2:01:01] the Lord is a secret coming he'll come
[2:01:04] and still away it'll be such a minority
[2:01:08] till just like it was in the days when
[2:01:10] the disciples X Jesus why does the
[2:01:12] scribe see that Elias must first come it
[2:01:14] happened when people had no idea it
[2:01:16] happening same thing I happen today
[2:01:18] listen say why why does the scribe sin
[2:01:20] of their lives must first come he said
[2:01:22] he is already coming you never knew it
[2:01:24] did you ever think what the people did
[2:01:27] they went right on believing that
[2:01:29] Alliance was coming and he was right
[2:01:32] among them and they didn't know it so
[2:01:35] will it be in the coming of the Son of
[2:01:37] Man they'll do with him just the same
[2:01:39] thing the Spirit of God is here well
[2:01:41] what are we going to do with it are we
[2:01:44] going to eat manna and so forth and not
[2:01:46] continually move up as we grow all right
[2:01:50] 7 compound names of Jehovah Oh my church
[2:01:57] if there's ever time to grow up that
[2:01:59] time is now there's ever time to mature
[2:02:02] in Christ that time is now we are in the
[2:02:07] last days the signs are all around us
[2:02:09] now God's just waiting on us amen look
[2:02:13] what the prophecy is every prophecy
[2:02:14] everything that I know of that I could
[2:02:17] see the scripture has been fulfilled
[2:02:19] already waiting for the coming of the
[2:02:22] Lord and as I've said as I said last
[2:02:24] night I believe that the coming of the
[2:02:26] Lord Jesus second coming is past two
[2:02:29] already past two and like it was in the
[2:02:32] days of Noah the long-suffering God
[2:02:33] waited not willing any should perish and
[2:02:36] he's just waiting waiting now with his
[2:02:39] long suffering that is coming already
[2:02:41] past - waiting to get the church in
[2:02:43] order so the Second Coming can take
[2:02:44] place what about that friends I got a
[2:02:47] question are you holding holding us up

[2:05:08] that but I mean people think you got I'm
[2:05:10] gonna do this you gonna still get bored

[2:05:38] time to get out of here
[2:05:40] and God just been so patient waiting on
[2:05:43] me waiting on you right let's look at
[2:05:49] what he says here the second coming
[2:05:52] it's past due already past doing like it
[2:05:55] was in the days of no the long-suffering
[2:05:56] God waited not willing innocent perish
[2:05:58] and he's just waiting packages you know
[2:06:02] I just watch God know what you getting
[2:06:07] ready to do when you leave here if you
[2:06:10] got some sin in your mind then I'm gonna
[2:06:13] do this I got I got to go do it
[2:06:17] God already know what you give me to go
[2:06:19] do now God could block you he could
[2:06:22] actually there's multiple ways to get
[2:06:25] blocked he could actually come down to
[2:06:26] say you ain't going nowhere he can do
[2:06:28] that he can let you get in your car and
[2:06:31] right when you get the way useful to be
[2:06:33] accident that's I'm blocking you
[2:06:37] right there's all kind of ways he could
[2:06:39] sense online message don't you go do
[2:06:40] that know what you think about doing
[2:06:42] good though it used to be people used to
[2:06:45] be in tune with the Spirit of God that
[2:06:46] they would come tell you things like
[2:06:47] that
[2:06:48] you think I'm not killing somebody don't
[2:06:51] you go do that
[2:06:52] just like that discernment of spirit was
[2:06:55] so real I'm gonna tell you I think the
[2:06:58] reason that we don't miss the lobby's
[2:07:00] things is because we got too many things
[2:07:01] taking our attention from God we got rid
[2:07:06] of the TV but then the devil brought the
[2:07:08] Internet and I'm not saying you can't be
[2:07:10] on the internet but just dis notice how
[2:07:12] the devil works right and then no more
[2:07:15] line got in and amounts you got a
[2:07:17] cellphone and then he brought every app
[2:07:19] that you can imagine on your cell phone
[2:07:21] and you just get locked into it's just
[2:07:24] too much to take our time from God and
[2:07:27] now that our time has been taken from
[2:07:29] God that's why we don't have the power
[2:07:32] the way we used to had it back in these
[2:07:35] Bible days they had no internet and no
[2:07:39] televisions they have nothing to take
[2:07:42] their tent you know not it did have
[2:07:44] theater they have C ater not like the
[2:07:49] way the way we got the day it was the
[2:07:52] Greek that came in to act and they would
[2:07:56] get called down to the theater to watch
[2:07:58] what the Greeks were doing so the CA
[2:08:01] didn't start amongst the Israelites it
[2:08:05] was a Greek peculiar people didn't go to
[2:08:12] the movies I thought I could peculiar
[2:08:19] people dating to specific look
[2:08:21] y'all need to know all this stuff come
[2:08:23] from if the devil that's trying to get
[2:08:25] you off space and then it just hinders
[2:08:29] us and holds us back we waiting on you
[2:08:31] we waiting on you we waiting on you to
[2:08:34] get free from that saying how much
[2:08:36] longer do we got to wait all right

[2:09:06] day that will ever be mortal tomorrow we
[2:09:09] may be immortal this is the only day we

[2:09:14] meeting will ever set together and work
[2:09:16] for the kingdom of God how are this
[2:09:19] leading to be conducted that tonight
[2:09:21] then with the very very highest of
[2:09:24] reverence that with all of our hearts
[2:09:26] we're leaning to the Lord Jesus to give
[2:09:29] us every soul that's here that isn't
[2:09:31] converted to help do something that a
[2:09:34] cause the unbeliever and the lukewarm to

[2:09:39] Christ if you were to go back and even
[2:09:44] read more in Peter 2nd Peter chapter 3
[2:09:48] Peter even asked the same question about
[2:09:50] you know what's what matter of living
[2:09:54] should we be conducting now what ways
[2:09:57] you would be living knowing that the
[2:09:59] second coming the Lord was not not some
[2:10:02] some far-off it's upon us right now it's
[2:10:06] upon us right now you're living in it
[2:10:09] problem is is that we get so
[2:10:12] desensitized we forget where we live in
[2:10:20] don't do it Church whatever you do amen
[2:10:25] draw closer to Christ if there was ever
[2:10:28] time just I mean like the Bible say lay
[2:10:29] aside every sin and every wait that's so
[2:10:31] easy but census that's something that we
[2:10:33] all got to do every last one of us got
[2:10:36] to find some things are not sin but they
[2:10:39] are weight and not sin because you know
[2:10:43] that's the first question people ask
[2:10:44] will I go to hell over this why you
[2:10:48] always want to answer some tax that
[2:10:51] already let you know if you come up with
[2:10:53] that question will I go to hell over
[2:10:54] this
[2:10:55] that's a weight that's the weight and
[2:10:58] the Bible say lay aside every sin and
[2:11:00] wait you already know what thing is
[2:11:03] going to send you to hell and you avoid
[2:11:05] a nose but now we talk about wait a
[2:11:10] mentor wings you got to get rid of them
[2:11:15] it's hard to walk it's hard to run when
[2:11:18] you weight it down that's why you Steven
[2:11:20] runners they take off everything some of
[2:11:23] them need to keep on some of but they
[2:11:25] take off everything when they run
[2:11:26] because they don't want to be weighted
[2:11:28] down amen
[2:11:31] if you're going to run this race for
[2:11:33] Christ get rid of the things of the
[2:11:35] world get rid of all that it's nonsense
[2:11:38] it's not necessary let's get right
[2:11:40] searching let's go home
[2:11:42] ye our chosen generation a man let's
[2:11:46] pray father how grateful we are to know
[2:11:53] that you have called us in a time like
[2:11:57] this when we can just really look at
[2:11:59] these things Peter and all that he
[2:12:03] experienced in all of his life man that
[2:12:07] experience you feeding 5,000 then
[2:12:10] another time feeding 4,000 just
[2:12:12] impossible things that he saw God there
[2:12:19] to see the the get a glimpse of the
[2:12:21] second coming of the Lord and even think
[2:12:24] it to himself let's just build three
[2:12:26] Tabernacles right here one for Moses one
[2:12:28] for Elijah one for Jesus hearing the
[2:12:30] voice from heaven tell them no no this
[2:12:33] is my beloved Son in whom I'm well
[2:12:35] pleased hear you him having questions
[2:12:40] that others have their mind they had the
[2:12:44] opportunity to ask why why does the
[2:12:46] scribe st. Elias must first come and to
[2:12:50] get the answer so clear that Elias truly
[2:12:55] shall first come and restore all things
[2:12:56] but I am to thee day Elias has already
[2:12:59] come and they didn't know it and they're
[2:13:02] the disciples understood elected man
[2:13:05] selected men
[2:13:07] that were chosen by God to catch a
[2:13:09] revelation for their day they caught it
[2:13:12] they lived
[2:13:13] Peter experiencing the the ability to
[2:13:16] walk on water what a what what this man
[2:13:19] would know he would have known that he
[2:13:21] was a part of a chosen generation but
[2:13:24] yet sixty years after the death of
[2:13:27] Christ Peter penned these words in the
[2:13:31] book of first Peter showing that it
[2:13:34] wasn't his generation but it was another
[2:13:37] generation that would be called the
[2:13:39] chosen generation and when we look at
[2:13:42] ourselves we fit the description god
