[1:12:10] get right into the word of the Lord amen
[1:12:12] I want to speak to you tonight the Lord
[1:12:14] helping us upon overcoming Goliath
[1:12:18] overcoming Goliath
[1:12:19] First Samuel chapter 17 verse 4 4 Samuel
[1:12:25] 17 verse 4 and we read verse 4 and then
[1:12:27] verse 23 where is the Lord should
[1:12:34] appreciate brother Jack and church body
[1:12:35] lines come by one more time I was
[1:12:38] looking back there he had a little notes
[1:12:40] from different brothers another jeweler
[1:12:42] the Andrew and different ones and I said
[1:12:43] well brother cliff farmer differ ones I
[1:12:46] said you've had some really great men of
[1:12:47] God come by here I serve few little and
[1:12:50] small and then as a friend of mine told
[1:12:52] me brother Bend you ain't never felt a
[1:12:54] little and small nowhere you win hey
[1:12:56] amen but amen I I certainly don't feel
[1:13:00] worthy to share the pulpit with such
[1:13:02] great men of God but we appreciate y'all
[1:13:04] allowing us come by we've had a good
[1:13:06] time already amen amen
[1:13:08] 1st Samuel 17 verse 4 and there went out
[1:13:12] a champion out of the camp of the
[1:13:14] Philistines named Goliath of Gath whose
[1:13:17] height was six cubits in the span verse
[1:13:20] 23 and as he talked with them behold
[1:13:25] there came up the champion the
[1:13:27] Philistine of gafe goliath by name and
[1:13:30] now the armies of the Philistines spake
[1:13:33] according to the same words now watch
[1:13:35] closely and David heard them it's one
[1:13:40] thing for the devil to brag in the ears
[1:13:42] of those that are cowards but in the
[1:13:45] ears of a man who is truly an overcomer
[1:13:48] that's the wrong thing to say to
[1:13:50] anytime they defy our God there's going
[1:13:53] to be somebody somebody that's going to
[1:13:56] be willing to stand up for what's right
[1:13:58] amen it may not be a few a number that's
[1:14:00] willing to stand up for what's truth but
[1:14:02] us is the elect of God before we go out
[1:14:04] of here in this world I believe we're
[1:14:06] going to have the ability to stand for
[1:14:07] what's right even brother Branham taught
[1:14:09] us like this he said in the last day he
[1:14:12] said we could be able to discern and
[1:14:14] withstand the Antichrist spirit within
[1:14:16] the framework of the Christian Church
[1:14:18] and I believe we're living in that hour
[1:14:19] of being able to stand for what's right
[1:14:21] look around us tonight we should be
[1:14:23] busted out the walls and build and
[1:14:25] bigger but where are they they're
[1:14:27] cowards running from the service of the
[1:14:28] Lord amen like like a little boy will go
[1:14:31] into a graveyard whistling trying to
[1:14:33] pretend like he ain't scared they know
[1:14:35] this whole world's coming to an end but
[1:14:37] they don't have the courage to withstand
[1:14:38] in this evil day thank God for those of
[1:14:41] you here tonight that's got courage to
[1:14:43] stand on this last day takes real
[1:14:45] courage amen let's just pray together
[1:14:47] over the word amen as we ask the Lord to
[1:14:50] help us tonight I wonder if you just
[1:14:52] have a need on your heart you'd like to
[1:14:54] be remembered just by the lifting of
[1:14:56] your hand if you don't mind
[1:14:57] amen mine's up with you god bless you
[1:14:59] each one father we we come before your
[1:15:02] place tonight Lord God this holy
[1:15:04] sanctuary where you dwell and all of the
[1:15:07] great bright lights of glory surrounded
[1:15:10] by angels of God Lord it's such a
[1:15:13] beautiful thought compared to what we
[1:15:14] deal with down here and lady osya thank
[1:15:17] you for a place of refuge we can hide in
[1:15:19] a place of sanctity Lord a place of
[1:15:21] safety so father's we come before thy
[1:15:24] throne boldly tonight the throne of
[1:15:26] grace of Mercy we pray that you'd help
[1:15:28] us give us the ability Lord Jesus to say
[1:15:31] only that which you'd be pleased with
[1:15:32] strengthen us give us your favor in the
[1:15:35] word Lord that as we begin to break the
[1:15:37] bread of life that it won't be just a
[1:15:39] man breaking words to the people but it
[1:15:41] would be you taking your word and making
[1:15:43] it live to us you see the little thought
[1:15:45] laying before me tonight Lord and God I
[1:15:48] can read them the quotes read in the
[1:15:50] scriptures but Lord it takes you to
[1:15:52] bring the context I'm praying you'll do
[1:15:54] that tonight and then for every uplifted
[1:15:56] hand I pray the Holy Spirit will just
[1:15:58] move on each one of them Lord that are
[1:15:59] sitting here tonight with great needs in
[1:16:01] their heart and lives may the Holy
[1:16:03] Spirit I pray
[1:16:04] bless them each one now God as you see
[1:16:06] the requests down underneath that hand
[1:16:08] that you'll meet that need Lord in the
[1:16:10] name of Jesus Christ as we commit the
[1:16:11] service now both speaker and listener in
[1:16:13] Jesus name Amen god bless you you may be
[1:16:17] seated all the saints said amen amen
[1:16:21] good to be a mint in the house of the
[1:16:23] Lord one more time let me say how good
[1:16:25] it is to be here glad you're here
[1:16:27] a man I would be able to preach nobody
[1:16:29] if y'all didn't show up Amen I'm glad
[1:16:31] you're here a man and it is um it is a
[1:16:34] difficult hour that we're living in a
[1:16:36] time of trouble like we've never seen
[1:16:39] and I recall and remember the words of
[1:16:42] brother Branham when he was speaking
[1:16:44] about the rapture he pulls his thought
[1:16:46] from the Book of Psalms where he said in
[1:16:48] the time of trouble that he would hide
[1:16:50] us the elect of God and his pavilion in
[1:16:53] his secret place for each of us there is
[1:16:55] a refuge there's something that we all
[1:16:58] can run into that will make us safe from
[1:17:01] the world as we know him as I told
[1:17:04] people many times I may be in a lady
[1:17:06] Ossian age I may live in a lady Essene
[1:17:09] body I may rub shoulders elidio sins but
[1:17:11] as a Christian I'm not a lady of sin I'm
[1:17:14] a member of God's body a member of God's
[1:17:16] bride and by God's grace we're moving
[1:17:19] forward into a deeper revelation of who
[1:17:21] we are where we came from and where
[1:17:24] we're going and this is a time like
[1:17:26] we've never seen trouble is every where
[1:17:29] we look and even when when people seem
[1:17:32] like they're safety all around they find
[1:17:34] a reason to make trouble with that
[1:17:36] people aren't satisfied anymore with
[1:17:38] nothing seem like when it comes to life
[1:17:41] in general the most miserable people
[1:17:43] that you've ever seen somebody wins the
[1:17:45] lottery they say enjoy it while it lasts
[1:17:47] you'll probably be broke tomorrow Sun
[1:17:49] comes out today why they they they say
[1:17:52] well glory to God the sun's out but
[1:17:54] it'll probably raining in four hours it
[1:17:56] didn't seem like they're happy with
[1:17:58] anything man's heart is so unsatisfied
[1:18:01] with where is that but for you and I
[1:18:04] there should be something inside of us
[1:18:06] hallelujah of the glory of God that
[1:18:09] rings in our heart on a daily basis that
[1:18:12] I am a Christian and I have a place of
[1:18:16] refuge that I can
[1:18:18] myself in and I don't have to worry
[1:18:20] about the storms growing around me I
[1:18:22] don't have to worry about what's going
[1:18:23] on and in different parts of the world I
[1:18:26] can hide myself in Jesus Christ and
[1:18:29] there I can find my solace I can find of
[1:18:32] inner sanctum that I can hide from all
[1:18:34] the things of the world we realize that
[1:18:37] being a Christian is a battle and being
[1:18:39] in a Christian battle it's one of the
[1:18:41] hardest and greatest battles that a man
[1:18:42] a woman will ever fight the Battle of a
[1:18:45] mind rather than a psychologist in the
[1:18:48] world to help you explain it all they've
[1:18:50] tried to take all the great fine
[1:18:52] instruments and all of their
[1:18:54] understanding and their knowledge about
[1:18:55] life in the human brain and the human
[1:18:57] psyche and they still can't figure out
[1:19:00] why people are going crazy by the bucket
[1:19:02] pools they still can't find the medicine
[1:19:05] as it was to regulate the human mind in
[1:19:07] the human spirit
[1:19:08] why because man was made in such a
[1:19:12] manner to be after God and made in a way
[1:19:15] that he is a creator that he is a
[1:19:17] conqueror Adam was placed upon this
[1:19:20] earth to rule and govern over the earth
[1:19:22] man and his fallen condition it it does
[1:19:25] something to his human spirit when he
[1:19:27] cannot control that fallen condition
[1:19:30] when he when he loses him and he loses
[1:19:33] battles it affects him in a way that
[1:19:35] sometimes they never recover but that is
[1:19:38] the part of overcoming that we all must
[1:19:40] recognize is the most significant
[1:19:42] because in every Christian life there's
[1:19:45] two attributes that come with a
[1:19:46] Christian walk wins and losses now let
[1:19:51] me read the other message how can I
[1:19:52] overcome now just listen the way brother
[1:19:54] Brandon says this I love the way that he
[1:19:56] puts this paragraph 105 he says overcome
[1:19:59] means to recognize the devil in every
[1:20:03] one of his tricks
[1:20:04] lots of people say there is no devil
[1:20:07] it's just a thought don't you never
[1:20:08] believe that there is a real devil and
[1:20:11] he's just as real as you are or anybody
[1:20:14] else is he's a real devil and you must
[1:20:17] recognize him real and you must know
[1:20:21] that he is a devil now let me just stop
[1:20:24] there for just a moment let me bring
[1:20:25] something to your attention because I
[1:20:27] think here is where we tend to trail off
[1:20:29] the path a little bit
[1:20:31] because what we don't realize is that
[1:20:33] this being called Satan this this
[1:20:36] creature that was once an angel in
[1:20:39] heaven
[1:20:39] once the right hand man to God to
[1:20:42] fellowship I don't think we recognize
[1:20:44] that this devil this being this creature
[1:20:47] is actually putting together meetings
[1:20:51] down inhale and holding meetings about
[1:20:54] you and sending out imps to your house
[1:20:57] and to your job and to other places
[1:20:59] around that's you that you have an
[1:21:01] influence at that is having meetings
[1:21:03] about you because the devil looks at you
[1:21:06] as a potential threat to the entire
[1:21:08] overthrow of his kingdom now if we can
[1:21:11] recognize that everything that goes on
[1:21:13] in our life there's not happen by chance
[1:21:15] my friends listen to me carefully
[1:21:18] everything that goes on in this life
[1:21:20] there's a reason and a purpose behind it
[1:21:22] that promotion you got there was a
[1:21:24] reason when you lost your job there was
[1:21:26] a reason that sickness in your body
[1:21:28] there was a reason everything has a
[1:21:31] purpose everything has a reason behind
[1:21:33] it and it's up to us to recognize which
[1:21:37] spirit is behind what circumstance this
[1:21:41] is what Bill Hemmer saying he'll when he
[1:21:42] said to recognize the devil and what he
[1:21:44] is we must recognize that Satan is a
[1:21:48] tormentor and he was created in a manner
[1:21:51] to torment everything that is of God
[1:21:54] remember Satan wanted to be God he
[1:21:57] wanted to have a throne he wanted to
[1:21:59] have subjects you want to have power he
[1:22:01] want to have dominion but Jack he's done
[1:22:02] every bit of it
[1:22:03] the Bible calls him the god of this evil
[1:22:06] age don't get upset at me but there are
[1:22:08] people even around the ranks of this
[1:22:10] message that worship the devil and don't
[1:22:11] even know it
[1:22:12] come on now because they worship
[1:22:15] ignorantly those things that they don't
[1:22:17] recognize and there's where brother
[1:22:19] Bentham said real overcoming takes place
[1:22:22] when you can recognize the devil and
[1:22:25] what is all about I wonder if our eyes
[1:22:27] are wide open I look at some of these
[1:22:29] young girls and boys sitting around here
[1:22:31] tonight and I wonder are our eyes open
[1:22:34] for the coming age if the 10th the
[1:22:36] coming of the Lord tarries another 30
[1:22:38] and 40 years you're the Church of
[1:22:40] tomorrow but are you recognizing today
[1:22:42] what's laying before you tomorrow
[1:22:45] and also legal a is going to be a
[1:22:47] despised way after a while even people
[1:22:50] around the ranks to this message we're
[1:22:51] beginning to hate the way of the Holy
[1:22:53] Ghost way and they don't want people
[1:22:54] shouting and worshipping and praising
[1:22:57] the Lord and they don't want your
[1:22:58] singing and rejoicing they want you to
[1:23:00] settle down sit there and fold your arms
[1:23:02] and take a few notes and and just learn
[1:23:05] a few things and go out the door but
[1:23:07] brother before we go out of here this
[1:23:09] true bride will be referred back to the
[1:23:12] original word let's roll on the data
[1:23:15] back on the original worship the
[1:23:17] original power the original authority
[1:23:20] that comes with the Holy Ghost filled
[1:23:22] church are we recognizing are we
[1:23:25] recognizing what's going on around us
[1:23:27] today many times in the discernment
[1:23:29] where the man would say now that's Lord
[1:23:30] Jesus if he's really who he is let's see
[1:23:32] if he is here today in one place that
[1:23:34] really strikes me but the band said it's
[1:23:36] time for us to recognize who is in our
[1:23:39] city today I wonder if we recognize who
[1:23:42] it is as amongst us as the people of God
[1:23:44] as the Spirit of God is beginning to
[1:23:46] lift up off the Gentile people and it
[1:23:49] seems like people are getting more and
[1:23:50] more cold and going away and want to get
[1:23:53] on a website little drama 'we want to
[1:23:55] hear a certain sermon in a drama way a
[1:23:57] boy or a girl or drama where some
[1:23:59] something in the world will draw but are
[1:24:01] we recognizing where are ours it has
[1:24:04] taken us to Satan is so slick he's so
[1:24:08] sly he'll allow you to come sit on a Pew
[1:24:11] and have religion it doesn't bother him
[1:24:14] if you say you're a believer this
[1:24:15] message I don't strike him at all
[1:24:16] because the devil's a believer the
[1:24:18] message you say that's nonsense no
[1:24:21] thought the Bible said he believes in
[1:24:23] one God and he trembles do you realize
[1:24:25] the devil don't even believe his own
[1:24:26] Trinitarian doctrine come on now because
[1:24:30] the Bible said he believes in one God
[1:24:32] not three persons he believes in one
[1:24:34] that's right he is a believer the devil
[1:24:37] is as religious as anybody can be
[1:24:39] religious we have to recognize that
[1:24:42] religion alone it will put us in
[1:24:44] religion ain't going to make us ready
[1:24:46] for the rapture we got to have more than
[1:24:48] that we got to have an old-fashioned
[1:24:51] Holy Ghost experience Amen one that
[1:24:53] takes away all of the desires of the
[1:24:55] world out of your heart and makes a real
[1:24:57] son and daughter
[1:24:58] out of you we needed we need it as I
[1:25:01] said there tonight it brother Willis
[1:25:02] we're getting to the place around the
[1:25:03] range this message where people want to
[1:25:05] say Holy Spirit and they kind of kind of
[1:25:07] tighten the tie up and straighten their
[1:25:09] coat Holy Spirit they're afraid to say
[1:25:11] Holy Ghost
[1:25:12] because Holy Ghost sounds like a wild
[1:25:14] man come on some company a man it sound
[1:25:18] like a wild peg out yonder they want to
[1:25:20] say Holy Spirit and they want to sip
[1:25:22] their water with their pinky out and
[1:25:23] they want to be they want to be cultural
[1:25:25] they want to be intellectual amen but
[1:25:28] the only bride that's going on here is a
[1:25:30] bride that is baptized with pyre and
[1:25:33] baptized with the Holy Ghost and has the
[1:25:36] power of Jesus Christ on the inside of
[1:25:38] her soul not just a reformed person a
[1:25:41] restored person Reformation is one thing
[1:25:44] but we need restoration amen we need to
[1:25:46] be redeemed back to the things of God
[1:25:48] every one of us sitting in this room
[1:25:50] tonight we can have an old-fashioned
[1:25:52] experience with Jesus Christ amen gifts
[1:25:55] could fall in here powers of God could
[1:25:57] fall in here the anointing could fall in
[1:25:59] here visions and signs and wonders and I
[1:26:02] even believe tonight even tonight
[1:26:03] I believe God will confirm his word with
[1:26:06] a supernatural movement of the Holy
[1:26:08] Spirit amen we didn't come for a
[1:26:10] protracted meeting just a set on the Pew
[1:26:12] and here a few good scriptures and go
[1:26:14] home but we came here to meet God and to
[1:26:17] look out deeper than we've ever walked
[1:26:19] out before a man who said you must
[1:26:23] recognize him real Oh is their brother
[1:26:25] being there ain't no way the devil's
[1:26:27] hold meetings about me yes we are a
[1:26:30] threat in this last day whoo come on
[1:26:34] preach seminar we're a threat I know you
[1:26:36] don't see that in yourself but you are
[1:26:38] do you realize just sitting in this
[1:26:40] church tonight being identified with
[1:26:41] this truth you're a threat because
[1:26:44] there's enough power laying in the Bible
[1:26:46] in the revelation of the hour to make
[1:26:48] you a press because he knows that what
[1:26:50] lays in the truth that the truth will
[1:26:52] set you free and whom the Sun sets free
[1:26:55] is what free indeed there ain't no way
[1:26:57] in the world that you could associate
[1:26:59] around this message and the cover not be
[1:27:00] pulled off who the devil really is all
[1:27:03] you have to do is listen to one message
[1:27:04] from the prophet of God and that one
[1:27:06] message he exposes every imp and
[1:27:08] everything that's around you it's a
[1:27:11] whole lot more and you get
[1:27:12] the Baptist Methodist Presbyterian
[1:27:13] Church of God they read out of some old
[1:27:16] Creed broker they try to tell you about
[1:27:18] how to be a better neighbor and how to
[1:27:19] be a better person but let me tell you
[1:27:21] you won't get to the rapture by being a
[1:27:23] good person there'll be plenty of good
[1:27:25] people in Hell goodness don't make them
[1:27:27] the Spirit of God what makes you what
[1:27:29] you are
[1:27:31] you got to recognize that and if you can
[1:27:34] recognize that God Himself is trying to
[1:27:36] fill your heart with the baptism of the
[1:27:40] Holy Ghost God Himself are you listening
[1:27:43] to me tonight God wants to fill your
[1:27:46] heart with the power of himself he wants
[1:27:49] to fail your soul with a little speck of
[1:27:52] God inside of you but it's hard for us
[1:27:56] to recognize that because we make so
[1:27:58] many mistakes ah that's what I want to
[1:28:00] preach on tonight wins and losses it's
[1:28:04] what makes a real overcomer because you
[1:28:06] see the real overcomer ain't the guy
[1:28:07] that wins all the time we'll come on now
[1:28:10] I think I read on a statistic one time
[1:28:13] Michael Jordan's will he you know he was
[1:28:16] shooting the ball and doing free throws
[1:28:17] and three-pointers all them practices he
[1:28:20] said I'll I said I missed the goal a
[1:28:22] whole lot more than ever made it but
[1:28:25] losing sometimes what's makes you a
[1:28:27] winner come on out amen I love what
[1:28:31] Edison said I think it was Edison too
[1:28:32] many the light bulb it was Edison one he
[1:28:35] said it was a thousand in one ways he
[1:28:36] was making light bulbs and he failed a
[1:28:39] thousand time on a thousand and one he
[1:28:41] made a light bulb and they said you
[1:28:42] failed a thousand times and said no I
[1:28:44] didn't he said I found a thousand ways
[1:28:46] how not to make a light bulb
[1:28:48] amen it's all in the way you approach it
[1:28:50] it's whether he recognized that's why I
[1:28:53] wanted overnight spirit and truth
[1:28:55] tabernacle are you recognizing what's
[1:28:57] among you tonight it's God's brightest
[1:29:01] God's Word it's his power if it's his
[1:29:02] authority is everything he is right here
[1:29:05] on this church tonight if we can just
[1:29:07] get a hold of it
[1:29:08] faith will declared faith will bring it
[1:29:11] to us
[1:29:11] but we've got to recognize it's here if
[1:29:14] you come in the back doors of this
[1:29:15] church and the only thing you recognize
[1:29:17] as a man in the pulpit a woman on the
[1:29:18] pen and a man on the drums or a guy back
[1:29:21] there at the camera ever what it might
[1:29:22] be if all you see is flesh that's all
[1:29:24] you get out of it
[1:29:25] amen that's the reason why people come
[1:29:27] the church is too hot the church is too
[1:29:29] cold
[1:29:29] the preacher look right at me when he
[1:29:31] said that will tell me where I'm
[1:29:32] supposed to look when I preach come on
[1:29:36] somebody I could look at that that that
[1:29:38] screen up here maybe I should preach to
[1:29:39] the piano
[1:29:40] come on piano gets saved it can't get to
[1:29:42] say you can so I figure I'll look at you
[1:29:45] because you're the ones that can get
[1:29:46] saved and then an organ tankard say the
[1:29:49] Panda can't get say but you can but he
[1:29:52] looked right at me when he said that
[1:29:54] what is it it's carnality it's not
[1:29:57] recognizing what's in your city right
[1:29:59] now what's sitting here amongst us
[1:30:02] tonight that presence is you feel when
[1:30:04] certain things are saying in certain
[1:30:06] words are said that anointing that comes
[1:30:08] over that sweet warm feeling that comes
[1:30:10] over you what is that that's a Holy
[1:30:11] Ghost that's Jesus in the form of a
[1:30:14] pillar of fire sweeping over the
[1:30:16] congregation amen you say how did that
[1:30:19] preacher know them things about my life
[1:30:20] somebody must have told it no you know
[1:30:22] you had a recognized recognize what's
[1:30:24] standing in the platform what's coming
[1:30:26] across the platform what's coming
[1:30:28] through the singing what's coming
[1:30:29] through the music
[1:30:30] what's come into reading your Bible how
[1:30:32] did he know I read that scripture this
[1:30:34] week you got to recognize come on
[1:30:36] somebody you got to recognize what's
[1:30:38] going on around you if you don't
[1:30:40] recognize that you'll miss it a hundred
[1:30:42] times over and you got to recognize the
[1:30:45] devil the same way you got to recognize
[1:30:47] that if Christ is here tonight so is the
[1:30:49] devil to discourage you and you and you
[1:30:51] and you and you and you and you and you
[1:30:52] and you and you and you and you and if
[1:30:54] he can hear to scourge every one of us
[1:30:56] out of the promise of God he wants to
[1:30:59] because you're a threat you're a prick
[1:31:02] and he knows you're a threat so he's
[1:31:05] having meetings down in hell or it might
[1:31:07] be not the literal devil himself but
[1:31:09] he's delegating and whatever whatever
[1:31:11] demons have been dispatched to your
[1:31:13] front door or to your home I guarantee
[1:31:15] they're having meetings about how to get
[1:31:17] you the prophet of God said he studies
[1:31:19] your life to see how you fight how you
[1:31:21] live how you act how you walk how you
[1:31:23] talk he wants to know what kind of man
[1:31:26] that you are what kind of woman the cha
[1:31:27] what are you weak to what are you strong
[1:31:29] to they're having meetings down inhale
[1:31:31] about you trying to figure out a way to
[1:31:34] get you in their grip and get you in
[1:31:36] their class but oh my that's all we got
[1:31:38] a record
[1:31:39] I seem to be a real devil we got to
[1:31:41] recognize him to be true and to be
[1:31:43] against you now watch this but man goes
[1:31:46] on to say at the same time that you
[1:31:48] recognize him you know that he is a
[1:31:50] devil and he is against you then to
[1:31:52] overcome him now here's the key event
[1:31:54] you must recognize event that God in you
[1:31:58] is greater and mightier than he is Oh
[1:32:02] because if you don't recognize him and
[1:32:05] you how can you defeat the devil if you
[1:32:08] can't recognize Christ is in your heart
[1:32:10] how can you be a true overcomer you must
[1:32:12] recognize God in you that is the hope of
[1:32:16] glory in it and now what the Bible said
[1:32:18] the real Christian would be to be Christ
[1:32:20] in you which is the hope of glory that's
[1:32:23] the only hope I've got amen I can't
[1:32:26] trust in the Republican Party I can't
[1:32:28] trust in the Democratic Party there's no
[1:32:31] one that I can trust there's not a
[1:32:33] preacher there's on a church there's not
[1:32:35] a mama there's not again there ain't
[1:32:37] nobody I can trust
[1:32:39] but God in me is who I can have
[1:32:41] confidence in there's no such thing as
[1:32:44] the perfect church is the perfect God in
[1:32:46] it that's the confidence I got I have a
[1:32:50] hard time trusting church people after
[1:32:52] you get burned so many times you realize
[1:32:54] they pack pretty hard tires but I do
[1:32:56] trust God and his people
[1:32:58] I do trust that the Holy Ghost promised
[1:33:00] he'd have a bride without spot without
[1:33:02] wrinkle will hallelujah somebody it
[1:33:04] doesn't matter you said this one doesn't
[1:33:06] matter what they're doing calling you
[1:33:08] it's greater than that in the world you
[1:33:13] must recognize God and use greater and
[1:33:15] mightier than he is the one that is in
[1:33:16] you has already overcome him someone
[1:33:21] said I'm waiting on my deliverance to
[1:33:23] comments over to come
[1:33:24] you've already been delivered you see
[1:33:27] this cross we pack up here in the corner
[1:33:29] of our churches it represents a symbol
[1:33:31] of overcoming what Jesus did when he
[1:33:34] died at Calvary it's finished right
[1:33:36] there it's not like a thing I read today
[1:33:38] from a bunch of fanatical brand amides
[1:33:41] who worship brother Branham they said
[1:33:43] what the cross could not finish brother
[1:33:45] Brennan came to complete that work that
[1:33:47] the cross couldn't finish
[1:33:47] I said that's blasphemy against oligos
[1:33:49] because my Lord Jesus said it
[1:33:52] finish ah his violence over with I'm not
[1:33:57] writing on somebody to come bring
[1:33:58] deliverance it's already been done it's
[1:34:03] already been completed
[1:34:04] how can I look for something that's
[1:34:06] already been done I said Lord of God one
[1:34:10] of these days if I get to praying and
[1:34:12] reading and listen to so many tapes and
[1:34:14] if I can get to where I can pay tithes
[1:34:16] every week Alleluia and not get matted
[1:34:18] to Walmart lady and not I'll be an
[1:34:23] overcomer glory to God you can do every
[1:34:25] bit of that and still not be an
[1:34:26] overcomer because being an overcomer
[1:34:29] means you must recognize God as in you
[1:34:31] and if you recognize Christ is in you
[1:34:34] that's the hope that's the overcoming
[1:34:38] now watch prevent says there it is he
[1:34:41] said by His grace you're more than a
[1:34:43] match for him it's that there's real
[1:34:47] overcoming when you recognize a certain
[1:34:51] approach Samuel chapter 4 now verse 2
[1:34:53] now with that said now how is it then as
[1:34:56] a child of God the most difficult part
[1:35:00] of being a child of God or being a
[1:35:02] Christian and serving the Lord if
[1:35:05] everything we did for him was perfect
[1:35:07] and never made a mistake and never had a
[1:35:08] problem we wouldn't have a lot of
[1:35:10] discouragement would we if everything I
[1:35:13] made and everything I said and
[1:35:15] everything that I put together it was
[1:35:17] just perfect everything just fell just
[1:35:19] exactly I'd have all the confidence in
[1:35:22] the world seemingly if every time I
[1:35:24] preached I never missed scriptures or if
[1:35:28] I maybe stumbled over certain words if
[1:35:32] every time I saw it in his siren ode or
[1:35:36] hit a long note on the piano
[1:35:38] I feel like boy I've got the world by
[1:35:40] the tail and really is the child of God
[1:35:43] that's the thing I think discourages is
[1:35:45] the most is that we feel like because we
[1:35:48] have losses that were not really
[1:35:50] overcomers but a part of your Christian
[1:35:53] life and a part of your Christian
[1:35:55] walking you might as well get used to it
[1:35:57] because it's going to be this way to the
[1:35:58] day you die or the day you're changed
[1:36:00] out of here one or the other you're
[1:36:02] going to have winds you're gonna have
[1:36:04] losses
[1:36:05] you might as well get used to because
[1:36:07] it's going to happen if you like to cook
[1:36:09] sometimes you're going to burn it hello
[1:36:13] somebody hey if you didn't matter what
[1:36:16] you do somewhere you're going to mess up
[1:36:18] somewhere wins and losses now let's go
[1:36:25] to the hill now and let's get a picture
[1:36:27] on mind of Goliath now we see Goliath
[1:36:30] come we know the Bible says about nine
[1:36:32] foot tall somewhere around there's a big
[1:36:33] guy but what kind of made me stop and
[1:36:37] think I thought he is a big dude but why
[1:36:39] didn't Israel just put it together in
[1:36:42] their brain we're going to get 10 of our
[1:36:43] biggest and we're going to ambush him
[1:36:45] and when he ain't lifting all 10 of us
[1:36:48] big boys are going to take him down why
[1:36:50] didn't they just why didn't they just
[1:36:52] flip the script as they say to the world
[1:36:54] and turn it around on old Goliath and
[1:36:56] the Philistines there was a reason why
[1:36:58] these people were scared you got one man
[1:37:01] making a threat come have a man coming
[1:37:04] with me and we'll serve you and if he
[1:37:06] doesn't win it's vice versa you'll serve
[1:37:09] us well service that would have been
[1:37:11] somebody in that army to come up and say
[1:37:13] hey I'm a child of God I'm God's servant
[1:37:17] and I've take him on they should have
[1:37:19] been lining up to fight this Philistine
[1:37:22] but there was a reason they were scared
[1:37:25] y'all ready I just couldn't give you the
[1:37:27] punchline now wins and losses all right
[1:37:31] get ready now we're going to go through
[1:37:33] eternity in the Bible First Samuel
[1:37:34] chapter 4 verse 2 now let's look this is
[1:37:37] one of the first confrontations that
[1:37:39] this group of Israelites has with with
[1:37:41] the Philistines one of the first and
[1:37:44] this is one of the most impactful parts
[1:37:46] to their walk in their journey in this
[1:37:48] whole thing and the Philistines put
[1:37:50] themself in array against Israel and
[1:37:53] when they join battle Israel is
[1:37:57] victorious before the Philistines huh I
[1:38:01] heard a lot of us no way preacher what
[1:38:05] the Bible say they were smitten before
[1:38:08] the Philistines not know Amen
[1:38:11] these are prophet quoting people right
[1:38:14] same people that can stand and quote
[1:38:16] glory to God every place that the
[1:38:19] I put heads upon I got to give me that
[1:38:22] place in victory their profit creating
[1:38:25] people they can appoint into every place
[1:38:28] Moses said this ain't supposed to happen
[1:38:31] now what are you going to do now you've
[1:38:34] got profit quoting people that's lost a
[1:38:36] battle hello now come on bridge with me
[1:38:41] they've lost one of the big battles
[1:38:44] against the Philistines not only are
[1:38:47] they smitten but watch how the Bible is
[1:38:49] is out and when they join battle is
[1:38:51] really split before the Philistines and
[1:38:53] they slew the army in the fear of that
[1:38:55] four thousand men now you imagine you
[1:39:01] live with these people you work with
[1:39:04] these people go to church of these
[1:39:06] people so after the first major loss you
[1:39:10] go back to church and you realize hey
[1:39:13] who's going to lead singing around here
[1:39:14] Oh John got killed last week by the
[1:39:17] Philistines we got to find us anybody in
[1:39:20] the church know any good drummers we
[1:39:22] need another drummer he was he was
[1:39:23] beheaded by one of them Philistines out
[1:39:25] on the field of battle you imagine that
[1:39:28] loss how it affected the church after
[1:39:31] they had to regroup prophet quoting
[1:39:34] people come on everybody
[1:39:38] prophet quoting people that had losses
[1:39:41] in their life oh I know we don't like to
[1:39:44] talk about it but it just so happens I'm
[1:39:45] the type of preacher that I talk about
[1:39:47] it whether you like it or not because
[1:39:49] this is the kind of stuff I think we
[1:39:51] need to hear in message searches you
[1:39:54] sisters already know how to dress and
[1:39:55] hopefully God you brothers know how to
[1:39:57] behave yourself so I don't think I have
[1:39:59] to stop and start preach and holiness do
[1:40:00] it hopefully this is where we should be
[1:40:03] living at into this place of how do I
[1:40:05] live above failure don't you understand
[1:40:09] that's what just even preachers around
[1:40:11] this matter they have failure after
[1:40:13] failure after loss after loss and they
[1:40:16] just don't know what to do about it
[1:40:18] oh by God's grace I'm hoping we can
[1:40:20] solve a lot of that tonight wins and
[1:40:24] losses now let's go to First Samuel
[1:40:27] chapter 4 and also pick up verse 10 now
[1:40:29] now notice this this next battle now
[1:40:32] there's some time period between these
[1:40:34] two fights but remember now they're
[1:40:37] going into the battle with the knowledge
[1:40:39] that they know now that they can lose
[1:40:42] with eject now they know profit quoting
[1:40:45] people who could stand up there and say
[1:40:48] glory to God
[1:40:49] Israel is an invincible army we've got
[1:40:54] the power jehovah on our side but now
[1:40:58] they can add to that resume and we also
[1:41:01] lost 4,000 men the other day as four
[1:41:04] thousand graves four thousand
[1:41:07] gravestones four thousand widows
[1:41:09] mentions four thousand children that
[1:41:12] needs to be taken care may be orphaned
[1:41:14] hey this was a big deal this wasn't
[1:41:16] something that just kind of a sniff that
[1:41:18] walked on you're talking about four
[1:41:21] thousand men and the armies of god he's
[1:41:26] might have been captains he's might have
[1:41:27] been all kinds of people there were
[1:41:29] leaders they might have been footmen
[1:41:30] they might have been in the middle but
[1:41:32] yet this loss put a little something in
[1:41:36] the armies of israel they recognized
[1:41:39] they had the ability to fail well i hope
[1:41:42] that we get that tonight I hope that you
[1:41:45] recognize you're not deity we have
[1:41:48] preached the People of God or deity and
[1:41:50] deity as in you and all that that's true
[1:41:52] but you're fleshing deity that's why men
[1:41:57] should dress right women should dress
[1:41:58] right while we should talk clean and act
[1:42:01] clean and live clean because our bodies
[1:42:03] are not converted come on now that's
[1:42:05] where the Rebbe said the Bible even said
[1:42:07] our body is a temple for the law but
[1:42:09] instead our flesh needs to be kept under
[1:42:11] wraps Paul said the good I would I don't
[1:42:14] do the things I don't want to do if I
[1:42:15] myself do and he said there's a law on
[1:42:16] me not me said but sin that dwells in me
[1:42:19] so our body not being converted it has
[1:42:22] the ability to lose oh I hope somebody's
[1:42:27] hearing what I'm saying tonight now
[1:42:29] watch this verse 10 and the Philistines
[1:42:32] fought and Israel is smitten good lord
[1:42:37] have mercy
[1:42:38] if you imagine being the preacher this
[1:42:40] next Sunday having a drag back to the
[1:42:42] platform on Sunday well how'd it go and
[1:42:45] so and so live
[1:42:46] that battle with cancer no well didn't
[1:42:49] you no time at all we did put a prayer
[1:42:52] cloth mother Branham put for them on
[1:42:53] there did you call this one called Allan
[1:42:57] schore did laid hands on this when we
[1:43:00] played their enjoyment on the Holy Ghost
[1:43:02] came down what happened
[1:43:04] they died oh god oh god that must mean
[1:43:09] is word ain't right that desert brother
[1:43:10] bender said if I pray for a million
[1:43:12] people tonight and everyone died he said
[1:43:15] I'd be on the field tomorrow praying for
[1:43:16] a million more because God's Word is
[1:43:18] right but how to deal with wins and
[1:43:22] losses that's our biggest thing
[1:43:24] how do idea the winds are easy hey when
[1:43:27] I get a win glory to God hallelujah
[1:43:28] praise the Lord but when I lose what do
[1:43:33] i do what do I do when I lose we don't
[1:43:39] get any quieter we go turn into the
[1:43:40] Nazarenes well this is over with anyway
[1:43:42] woo come on out please with me now what
[1:43:45] I said and they pred every man into his
[1:43:48] tent perfect quoting people running for
[1:43:54] the sanctity of their tents what's
[1:43:58] happening they recognize they've got the
[1:44:00] ability to lose and because they know
[1:44:03] they can lose fear is setting in John
[1:44:08] imagine the preacher got up and quoted
[1:44:10] to them what Moses said next Sunday
[1:44:12] morning over to God every place the so I
[1:44:15] put and I wonder if that preacher might
[1:44:17] have avoided that subject come Sunday
[1:44:19] morning you know how preachers do so at
[1:44:23] least the compromising ones whenever
[1:44:25] they see an issue
[1:44:26] they usually dodge around it because
[1:44:28] they don't want to offend the people or
[1:44:30] hurt the people or affect the people
[1:44:31] that's the problem I got with a lot of
[1:44:33] these modern-day guys coming up around
[1:44:35] the ranks of the mess they're too nice
[1:44:37] everything's nice and sweet and they
[1:44:40] don't want to hurt nobody's feelings and
[1:44:42] and I don't want to bother y'all with
[1:44:45] this trouble and everything so I just
[1:44:46] preached the rapture and preached
[1:44:48] resurrection and going home time and
[1:44:50] we're with a bride glory to God we're
[1:44:53] gone in the rapture and you know we've
[1:44:54] done we've preached ourselves into a rut
[1:44:56] and we've called the bride the bride the
[1:45:00] bride
[1:45:00] until we're bad as it was 30 years ago
[1:45:02] is to walk around saying God send a
[1:45:03] prophet God send a prophet God send a
[1:45:05] prophet till finally somebody spoke up
[1:45:08] and said tell me what he said well
[1:45:11] that's what I'm asking you tonight we
[1:45:13] wanted the bride the bride the bride the
[1:45:15] bride but tell me how to be bride
[1:45:17] tell me how to be elected of God tell me
[1:45:21] what God looks like we need more we need
[1:45:26] more we know the brides on the scene but
[1:45:28] we need to identify and recognize who
[1:45:30] she is and what she lives like problem
[1:45:33] is we've hollered about the message in
[1:45:34] the message in the message the message
[1:45:36] the people don't even understand what
[1:45:37] you're talking about the message is an
[1:45:40] everyday living of recognizing and this
[1:45:42] failures in it and its successes and its
[1:45:44] wins and its losses and it's taking
[1:45:47] chances and it's being discouraged and
[1:45:49] sometimes sick that's the message but i
[1:45:55] dont preach blab it and grab it name and
[1:45:57] claim it hello I know that sometimes
[1:46:02] there's going to be times that all hell
[1:46:05] is breaking loose around you that's the
[1:46:08] message that's what bride looks like I
[1:46:11] imagine that preacher you know being a
[1:46:13] nice preacher he probably hoarded all in
[1:46:15] the scriptures and due to Romany and
[1:46:16] just had everybody together and say well
[1:46:18] he said he bless you and you're coming
[1:46:20] in and blessing you going out god bless
[1:46:22] you I tell you a preacher preach to me
[1:46:28] like that I'd never walk cross street to
[1:46:29] hear him again
[1:46:30] if I'm wrong I want him to tell me I'm
[1:46:33] wrong and I want him to tell me how to
[1:46:35] get right to a man tell me how to get
[1:46:38] right have some how to live right now
[1:46:40] once there was a very great slaughter
[1:46:43] for there fell of Israel watch now
[1:46:47] 30,000 footmen now our number is up to
[1:46:52] 34,000 so not only have you devil but
[1:46:55] you've tripled you've quadrupled and so
[1:47:00] now when they go back to Israel the
[1:47:04] great slaughter that they've just
[1:47:06] experienced was even more so than the
[1:47:09] 4,000 so the little bit that they
[1:47:11] experienced with that look how many
[1:47:12] times it was multiplied after
[1:47:14] this failure because sometimes little
[1:47:17] failures they just start a pathway they
[1:47:20] start a cycle of things in you the first
[1:47:23] time you felt that the setting sin you
[1:47:25] as little discouraged over if you
[1:47:26] thought glory to God I'm gonna raise up
[1:47:28] my whip this thing the second time you
[1:47:30] failed to it it was even greater loss
[1:47:32] than the first one was because you're
[1:47:34] thinking to yourself I should be able to
[1:47:36] whip this I should be able to beat this
[1:47:38] hey God didn't say that the settings
[1:47:40] sins to be whipped overnight there'll be
[1:47:42] certain things you may be fighting them
[1:47:44] for years and years and years and years
[1:47:47] to come
[1:47:47] it doesn't mean it gets the best of you
[1:47:50] but it means you got to fight it
[1:47:52] sometimes keeping it under your feet
[1:47:55] we're over it hey I don't need nobody to
[1:47:58] tell me I'm hitting home right now I can
[1:48:00] feel it in every one of you why because
[1:48:02] this is where we're living at this is
[1:48:04] what real Christianity looks like this
[1:48:06] is the type of Christianity I deal with
[1:48:08] on a daily basis look at how many times
[1:48:11] brother venom about font discouragement
[1:48:13] every time you see brother BAM he's
[1:48:15] plotting discouragement nobody loves
[1:48:16] even nobody wants to hear the message
[1:48:18] what was it the gift of God in his life
[1:48:20] to be a prophet and for evangelism the
[1:48:23] things in mating that type of man
[1:48:24] where he would preach and cut and whip
[1:48:27] and hurt and everything he had to go
[1:48:29] home and deal with it oh I can't believe
[1:48:34] I said I heard him say this other day I
[1:48:35] put on some of them records and listen
[1:48:37] is that I said did I say that oh please
[1:48:39] tell me I didn't say that surely I
[1:48:41] didn't say that hey I can recognize that
[1:48:44] because not every time too brother BAM
[1:48:46] preach did he get home and say go over
[1:48:47] to God the greatest message has ever
[1:48:49] been preached has been preached the
[1:48:51] greatest revelation has Berthe media I
[1:48:54] hope they recognize how great tonight
[1:48:56] was because brother Brennan went home
[1:48:59] with his head hanging down thanking God
[1:49:02] why do I have to strike these things
[1:49:03] over and over again why do I have to hit
[1:49:06] denomination why do I have to hit
[1:49:07] organization why do I have to hit all
[1:49:10] that oh my I believe in one way we would
[1:49:12] want brother Brennan back but I believe
[1:49:13] in another way he would be proud to see
[1:49:15] what his message is accomplished it may
[1:49:18] not be in the majority but the true word
[1:49:20] that he preached has got a bride ready
[1:49:22] to get out of here in the
[1:49:23] sure I believe he'd be proud of what
[1:49:26] God's accomplished in this thing all the
[1:49:28] work all the labor all the sleepless
[1:49:30] nights all the tears don't you tell me
[1:49:32] brother BAM went home after every
[1:49:33] campaign and said who were to God we got
[1:49:36] the devil this time there were times he
[1:49:38] went home and he would say God don't
[1:49:40] never let me preach a sermon again he
[1:49:43] fought it over and over and over again
[1:49:46] but yet when we when we present
[1:49:48] Christianity to people we present it's a
[1:49:50] happy-go-lucky everything is blessed
[1:49:54] everything you touches prospers really
[1:49:57] does it then they're not recognizing the
[1:49:59] devil's a real devil then because
[1:50:02] everything you try to prosper the devil
[1:50:04] standing right there to tear it back
[1:50:05] down I wish somebody would help me
[1:50:07] preach tonight everything you ever put
[1:50:10] your hand to the devil's right there to
[1:50:13] try to tear it down that's what we got
[1:50:15] to recognize who he is
[1:50:16] oh I've fallen to that thing ten
[1:50:19] thousand times and you may fall ten
[1:50:21] thousand more the question is are you
[1:50:22] going to go hide your tent or you'll get
[1:50:25] back out and fight a man a man oh my
[1:50:31] listen thirty thousand Pittman and it
[1:50:34] gets even worse than that and the Ark of
[1:50:36] God was taken oh my goodness the two
[1:50:41] sons of Eli hold for nine Phineas were
[1:50:44] slain so not only they get thirty
[1:50:47] thousand of your brothers but they've
[1:50:50] also killed your preachers now you
[1:50:54] understand people that follow people
[1:50:56] religion this is a big deal for them
[1:50:58] those that are following Jehovah they
[1:51:00] just say well glory to God
[1:51:02] we'll just keep on moving just dust
[1:51:06] yourself off and keep on moving people
[1:51:08] that follow Platt pass to religion hey
[1:51:11] let me ask you a question what do you
[1:51:12] think is going to happen give us twenty
[1:51:14] years around here some of the big
[1:51:15] celebrities and big names around this
[1:51:17] message if someone was to die what do
[1:51:19] you think people in this message is
[1:51:20] going to do because they can't find
[1:51:22] nobody like their favorite preacher well
[1:51:24] come on look at me by God I know I'm
[1:51:26] telling the truth
[1:51:27] well they ain't nobody like so-and-so
[1:51:29] there ain't but Jesus is better than
[1:51:32] Zones oh jesus is the greatest preacher
[1:51:34] anyhow I would rather hear Jesus
[1:51:36] any day of the week than anybody else oh
[1:51:40] but what are we going to do
[1:51:42] you heard brother vistacal the other day
[1:51:44] had a heart operation whatever the
[1:51:45] mystical goes off the seat and then to
[1:51:47] some people where the physicals are holy
[1:51:48] ghost that's the reason why when this
[1:51:51] happens in their life they're so
[1:51:53] devastated because they've got their
[1:51:55] expectation built on perfection you're
[1:52:01] not a perfect person to go over to God I
[1:52:04] didn't need you to tell me that did you
[1:52:06] maybe you need to hear it maybe we've
[1:52:09] got kind of our own complex in our mind
[1:52:11] thinking oh I'm bride I'm bride I'm
[1:52:14] bride I'd never deal with sexual things
[1:52:16] I'm bride I never feel I want to say
[1:52:18] cuss words to people I never want to
[1:52:20] tell a lie when I get in trouble uh-huh
[1:52:22] really so you must be a special kind of
[1:52:26] stupid that's what they say in the world
[1:52:29] come on now because there's not a person
[1:52:33] in this world that don't live with their
[1:52:36] own humanity mm at the Holy Ghost serve
[1:52:39] me today is the heat of humanity the
[1:52:42] heat of humanity whenever the body
[1:52:45] whenever the mind whatever pressure
[1:52:47] begins building up the heat from
[1:52:49] humanity it almost drives you crazy
[1:52:51] because it's like your thoughts and your
[1:52:54] emotions are the boiling point and it
[1:52:56] just keeps going going going going going
[1:52:57] you think you're going to go crazy and
[1:52:59] then you say but I'm bright but I'm
[1:53:02] bright i'm elect yeah that's right but
[1:53:04] did you recognize who's in the city do
[1:53:07] you recognize who's living in your heart
[1:53:09] can you recognize god and use greater
[1:53:10] than the devil out there trying to
[1:53:12] destroy you that's the thing you got to
[1:53:14] recognize because if not wins and losses
[1:53:16] will pull you down right hey listen I've
[1:53:19] got many more losses than I do wins -
[1:53:24] head nods a few eye blinks in one little
[1:53:26] shake come on now I've got many main
[1:53:30] losses than I do wins I've failed a
[1:53:33] whole lot more than what I have
[1:53:35] succeeded but I refuse to lay down just
[1:53:38] because I fail how about you how about
[1:53:42] you
[1:53:43] I refuse to quit just because I mess up
[1:53:47] because if I quit I'll never become an
[1:53:49] overcomer if I stop I'll never go
[1:53:52] forward I'll never cross the finish line
[1:53:53] if I stop when I fall there's been many
[1:53:56] of them come from the behind come from
[1:54:00] the behind spot then put them come from
[1:54:02] the behind part when they're so far back
[1:54:04] behind they can't hardly even hold on
[1:54:06] but because of grit and determination
[1:54:09] and because of the Holy Ghost in you
[1:54:10] you'll come from the behind all the way
[1:54:12] up to the front that's what God wants us
[1:54:15] to go to recognize that's true
[1:54:17] overcoming now here we've got thirty
[1:54:19] four thousand people slain wonder what
[1:54:23] church look like on Sunday better yet
[1:54:26] what looked like on Wednesday night
[1:54:28] because that's when half the church
[1:54:29] shows up so when he comes to church that
[1:54:35] night I'll tell you children of God I'll
[1:54:37] tell you God Jehovah he said we are a
[1:54:40] peculiar people and you know he also
[1:54:43] said every every blessing God's give you
[1:54:48] every blessing that's right pastor avoid
[1:54:51] that subject stay away from it you might
[1:54:53] upset people because he knows if he
[1:54:56] wasn't start quoting that prophet again
[1:54:57] they're going to point to him to them
[1:54:59] 34,000 fresh graves and say if brother
[1:55:01] Branham is right I mean if Moses is
[1:55:03] right you got to be careful when people
[1:55:09] produce evidence because evidence can be
[1:55:12] twisted that's why you can't believe
[1:55:14] everything you see every report about a
[1:55:17] bridge and everything about a versa did
[1:55:19] it be careful about stuff like that cuz
[1:55:21] I'm gonna tell you something right now a
[1:55:22] lot of times the people that left this
[1:55:25] message when the believe this hide and
[1:55:27] seek you the truth when all them showed
[1:55:29] up that was just the ticket they've been
[1:55:31] looking for anyhow because it was in
[1:55:33] their heart to find a way out so they
[1:55:38] just take it all the glory to God
[1:55:41] they've got evidence they got facts so
[1:55:43] do we and we've even got greater
[1:55:46] evidence than that they try to tell me
[1:55:49] all the one message I preached some time
[1:55:52] ago I had a did a little interview with
[1:55:55] a sister from Newfoundland and she asked
[1:55:57] the question are women underestimated in
[1:56:00] this message I said yes
[1:56:01] I said frankly women are bullied around
[1:56:03] this message we've beat him in the head
[1:56:06] we tell him to live this way live that
[1:56:07] way and every time they come to church
[1:56:09] you poor sister how to endure us
[1:56:11] preaching on whether you're dressing
[1:56:12] right or not half the women in this
[1:56:14] message ain't really been instructed how
[1:56:16] to be mothers kind of how to be ladies
[1:56:18] how to live for God how to overcome
[1:56:21] we got preacher after picture one guy
[1:56:23] wrote me and said oh don't give him
[1:56:25] evidence I said to keep our most mouths
[1:56:27] shut
[1:56:27] gives them evidence why are we so afraid
[1:56:30] to challenge that devil out there why
[1:56:33] wins and losses oh there was a pastor
[1:56:38] for 30 years quit the message altogether
[1:56:41] thank God I said thank God because if
[1:56:48] they ain't genuine in the first place we
[1:56:50] don't need him around know how Amen I
[1:56:54] don't wish anybody harm but why would we
[1:56:57] back up when the challenge is on why
[1:57:00] people so afraid to talk of one brother
[1:57:02] groped me and said oh you better be
[1:57:03] careful identifying that we've got
[1:57:05] problems in the message I said any idiot
[1:57:07] can see we got problems in the message
[1:57:09] you know why some people think we're
[1:57:11] caught some people live like we're a
[1:57:12] cult their life is like a cult they
[1:57:17] won't talk to nobody they're not nice to
[1:57:18] nobody I'm here anyhow I just got to say
[1:57:23] it brothers won't open the door for
[1:57:25] sisters and they won't say yes ma'am and
[1:57:27] no ma'am and on and on and on and
[1:57:29] sisters are living like a like a jewel
[1:57:30] in a pet pig snout no discretion and no
[1:57:34] ladylike about her come on out and yet
[1:57:38] we cower down whenever the challenge is
[1:57:40] on about what brother branham's
[1:57:42] birthdate was well I I'd be afraid they
[1:57:46] can sure point to a lot of problems so
[1:57:48] could they and so did they so Goliath of
[1:57:53] em say makes his boast he's bluffing
[1:57:55] because he he knows if Israel really
[1:57:56] becomes unified they can whip them he
[1:57:59] knows that he can read the history books
[1:58:01] like the rest of them can he knows if
[1:58:03] they ever become unified around that
[1:58:04] word
[1:58:05] he knows that Israel is an army to be
[1:58:07] reckoned with but he's bluffing him is
[1:58:09] trying to use their own fears based on
[1:58:12] their own wins and losses
[1:58:14] as evidence that they can't whip him so
[1:58:18] send me a man to fight us he knew they
[1:58:20] were cowering in the cave he knew they
[1:58:22] were hiding in the tents he knew they
[1:58:24] were scared same thing around the
[1:58:27] message oh brother bin
[1:58:29] I just don't know if there's any church
[1:58:31] we can go to this ride and I'm looking
[1:58:33] for the perfect Church well when you
[1:58:35] show up you'll you'll you'll ruin that
[1:58:40] [Music]
[1:58:46] there's a lot forgive me but it's true
[1:58:49] there's no perfect person anyway oh I
[1:58:54] just wish we had some preachers around
[1:58:56] the message that that would tell us the
[1:58:57] truth they are we do have people around
[1:59:00] the message over tells you we do have
[1:59:01] honest people around I'll grant it to
[1:59:03] you that there's a whole lot more
[1:59:04] problems than there is is it solutions
[1:59:07] but that's not a reason for us to throw
[1:59:10] up our hands and say well that proves
[1:59:11] the message is wrong the problem is
[1:59:14] friends we back down from challenges
[1:59:17] that we ought not back down to oh if I
[1:59:19] serve the Lord my momma won't like me
[1:59:21] and my daddy won't like me and just want
[1:59:23] to turn me down laugh do what they want
[1:59:25] to I'm saying with God's word as long as
[1:59:28] Jesus don't do away with me that's all
[1:59:30] that matters
[1:59:31] you may hate me after tonight but as
[1:59:33] long as he loves me that's what I'm
[1:59:34] looking for I love you anyhow but now
[1:59:37] you may not love me but I love you but I
[1:59:38] want him to love me more does he's my
[1:59:41] ticket out of here
[1:59:42] hey man he's my he's my token out of
[1:59:45] here oh praise the Lord
[1:59:48] look here in 1st Samuel 7-7 chapter 7
[1:59:52] verse 7 9 watch this and when the
[1:59:59] Philistines heard that the children of
[2:00:03] Israel were gathered together to Mizpah
[2:00:05] the Lords of the Philistines went up
[2:00:08] against Israel oh now now we're getting
[2:00:12] down to business now I just think the
[2:00:15] Philistines coming on now it's the Lords
[2:00:18] of the Philistines I imagined them dudes
[2:00:22] I bet they'd walk with a little bit more
[2:00:23] spring in their step when they walk
[2:00:24] across that line because they knew they
[2:00:27] had Israel
[2:00:28] right in the palms of their hand they
[2:00:31] were determined to put their their
[2:00:34] pressure their influence
[2:00:36] just like in in Rome when they would
[2:00:38] place the cross it's a known fact that
[2:00:40] they would use folks crucified all over
[2:00:43] the city when you'd enter into the city
[2:00:45] there might be people to the gate
[2:00:46] hanging on the cross it was a message
[2:00:48] Rome would send to all of their captors
[2:00:50] don't mess with us
[2:00:51] you cross us we'll cross you the same
[2:00:56] way once they get influenced but
[2:00:58] remember this way the devil does you get
[2:00:59] you in a corner he gives you a bluff try
[2:01:02] to make you feel like there's no way out
[2:01:06] so well I've been reading some of them
[2:01:08] websites and I've been looking at what
[2:01:10] some in folks and some of the stuff they
[2:01:12] say makes sense you ever read about Flat
[2:01:15] Earth sometimes people make sense when
[2:01:18] they talk about things you ever read
[2:01:20] about we didn't really go to the moon it
[2:01:22] was just a stage thing some of that
[2:01:24] stuff makes sense they have the ability
[2:01:26] to reason it out but we're not talking
[2:01:28] about reasoning of the word we're
[2:01:30] talking about proof and facts that Jesus
[2:01:32] Christ did not vindicate William Brennan
[2:01:34] to be the prophet of God for this last
[2:01:35] day he did benda Kate him he did back
[2:01:39] him up one picture they showed was with
[2:01:42] Edie Sullivan and the Beatles standing
[2:01:45] there in Houston where the pillar of
[2:01:47] fire was taken as I was fabricated see
[2:01:50] there look at the white streaks of light
[2:01:52] the pictures in back of them for black
[2:01:53] and white and look at in white streaks
[2:01:55] of light over the Beatles I guess the
[2:01:57] Beatles have indicated - one day I was
[2:02:00] looking at the picture and I thought to
[2:02:01] myself that's a toughy I wonder how can
[2:02:04] hack and deal with that and all of a
[2:02:06] sudden I was reading in the revelation
[2:02:08] series a brother man makes this one
[2:02:11] comment that woke me up and that jeantel
[2:02:15] you'd solve the thing for me but REM
[2:02:18] said now watch him here in the
[2:02:19] revelation in the fourth he said John
[2:02:22] standing there in the presence of God
[2:02:24] and the mystery of his colors and light
[2:02:29] going all around he said because as John
[2:02:31] stood in this place the rainbow colors
[2:02:34] shot on Shawn in that amber gold
[2:02:39] yellowish green color
[2:02:41] that is the pillar of fire and I looked
[2:02:44] at the pillar of fire over brother brems
[2:02:46] head black and white I looked at the
[2:02:48] Beatles and over their head black and
[2:02:49] white and it hit me if you put it in
[2:02:52] color what you find out is that the
[2:02:54] light above their head is a streak of
[2:02:55] light like this electric light right
[2:02:57] here but show up the one over the band's
[2:02:59] head and it's an amber yellowish gold
[2:03:01] green color altogether because that's
[2:03:03] the color of the pillar Oh fire he's not
[2:03:05] electric light like that he's yellowish
[2:03:07] green he's an amber color the thing of
[2:03:10] it is God hides these things from the
[2:03:12] eyes of the wise and prudent but reveals
[2:03:15] from the babes such as we learn there's
[2:03:18] an answer out there if you're willing to
[2:03:20] seek for it if you're going to really
[2:03:21] look for what's right and for what's
[2:03:23] truth but you realize many of these
[2:03:25] debates many of these battles are based
[2:03:28] upon wins and losses many of these
[2:03:33] people that have left the message to
[2:03:35] leave it because of treatment not
[2:03:37] because of doctrine but because of
[2:03:40] treatment they've been treated poorly
[2:03:42] and they've had poor people treating
[2:03:44] them that's exactly the right problem
[2:03:47] after problem they get offended has
[2:03:49] nothing to do with whether the message
[2:03:50] is right let's go on and talk about the
[2:03:53] message that brother Ben and brought
[2:03:54] forget birthdays forget bridges forget
[2:03:57] failed visions forget all that nonsense
[2:03:59] let's just talk about for the Breton's
[2:04:00] doctrine for a minute let's go to the
[2:04:02] Bible find oneness of the Godhead let's
[2:04:04] find if the serpent had a seat or not
[2:04:06] let's find water baptism in the name of
[2:04:08] Jesus Christ let's find out if the Holy
[2:04:11] Ghost is promised for today come on
[2:04:13] somebody when it comes to the doctrine
[2:04:16] of the Bible
[2:04:17] it's absolutely flawless a friend of
[2:04:22] mine up in Connecticut I hope this is
[2:04:24] okay a friend of mine up in Connecticut
[2:04:26] not long ago about two months or so he
[2:04:28] just walked up to the platform and he
[2:04:30] told everybody he was done with the
[2:04:31] message he's going to quit brother man
[2:04:33] is not the prophet that came said
[2:04:35] because brother Vance told everything
[2:04:36] from Charles taze Russell the founder of
[2:04:39] the Jehovah Witness said see there see
[2:04:41] his pyramid-- his a gravestone as a
[2:04:44] pyramid just like brother branham's he
[2:04:46] called himself the lady you see a
[2:04:47] message just like brother Branham did I
[2:04:49] said so what do you think about I said
[2:04:52] his argument is weaker than the broth
[2:04:54] made from the shadow of
[2:04:55] start after death I said because even
[2:04:58] Jesus himself standing in pilots Hall
[2:05:00] when they said which Jesus would you
[2:05:04] rather us release to you realize
[2:05:05] Barabbas first name was Jesus there'll
[2:05:11] be many impersonators come along what
[2:05:14] are you saying that de la Garde
[2:05:16] we cast out Devils and done this that
[2:05:18] and the other they said but brother
[2:05:20] branham plagiarize I wish some of these
[2:05:21] folks would go to school a little bit
[2:05:23] plagiarism is when you steal an idea and
[2:05:25] make it your own but when you tell where
[2:05:27] you got it from
[2:05:28] that's not plagiarism plagiarism is when
[2:05:32] you steal it and make it your own
[2:05:34] but brother Bentham always told us where
[2:05:35] he got everything from he told them
[2:05:38] folks I gotta read this I was reading
[2:05:40] Joseph Smith and I was reading that one
[2:05:42] and reading that one he said when he
[2:05:44] opened up the seals and the Holy Spirit
[2:05:45] come to open the seals he said when I
[2:05:47] got down and started studying many of
[2:05:50] the old scholars and many of the riders
[2:05:51] and Charles Russell and all the rest
[2:05:53] rebel he said I was about to make a
[2:05:55] terrible mistake until the Holy Spirit
[2:05:58] corrected me on something I was going to
[2:05:59] say do you have problems listen to a guy
[2:06:04] preachers preachers up reaches other
[2:06:05] people's ideas do you have a problem
[2:06:08] that's good
[2:06:09] because that's all I've done tonight I
[2:06:14] preached from Samuel I preached from
[2:06:18] John I've quoted to you from brother
[2:06:20] Branham I place some things in from
[2:06:23] history well we've got the original
[2:06:26] thought anyways come on somebody but
[2:06:31] what is it why are we afraid to
[2:06:34] challenge these things wins and losses
[2:06:38] because people can always point to some
[2:06:40] failure oh that's what there are were
[2:06:42] preachers I don't believe in preachers
[2:06:44] because I knew this preacher run off
[2:06:45] with a piano player and this preacher
[2:06:47] robbed the people apply and disputable
[2:06:49] what about the good ones so now I'm not
[2:06:51] going to church therefore we're
[2:06:52] hypocrites I said in over the grocery
[2:06:54] store don't go to the bank because God
[2:06:57] have mercy on you this hypocrites all
[2:06:59] over the place oh god you're Taylor is a
[2:07:02] hypocrite and
[2:07:04] no Walmart lady there's probably I have
[2:07:06] a craft don't never eat your restaurant
[2:07:10] ever again as long as you live there
[2:07:12] maybe wins and losses this is how the
[2:07:23] devil holds these things over our head
[2:07:25] really comes down to his fear fear Satan
[2:07:30] knows because he studied us he knows
[2:07:33] when we're afraid to step forward and he
[2:07:35] knows what it will take to make us step
[2:07:36] backwards too but I refuse to back up
[2:07:40] when our God the shot of the king is in
[2:07:42] the camp I recognize God in me is
[2:07:45] greater than him oh my you say don't you
[2:07:48] get afraid and sure I do you get scared
[2:07:50] you better believe it when they publish
[2:07:53] this little interview I'm talking about
[2:07:54] and I started getting critics come back
[2:07:55] my flesh was so scared I thought oh god
[2:07:57] here we go
[2:07:58] Here I am just trying to help the body
[2:08:00] of Christ and they say I know this one
[2:08:02] that one of the other one it's amazing
[2:08:04] to me when you tell the truth what kind
[2:08:06] of response you get from people because
[2:08:09] I actually had some of the critics write
[2:08:10] me back and said thank you brother bin
[2:08:12] thank you for being one of the first
[2:08:13] message preachers we know to actually
[2:08:16] tell the truth about what's going on in
[2:08:18] the rankings of the message because
[2:08:21] that's the reason I left the church one
[2:08:22] sister said because I was being
[2:08:24] mistreated as a sister I was being
[2:08:27] bullied as a sister and some of the
[2:08:28] brothers that heard my little interview
[2:08:30] the other day they wrote in and told the
[2:08:31] sister we got delivered from being
[2:08:33] bullies ourselves when somebody spoke up
[2:08:36] and told the truth I said thank God at
[2:08:38] least God got a few little David's
[2:08:39] around there someone and I'm afraid but
[2:08:43] we back up on things parents do with
[2:08:45] their children yeah because you had a
[2:08:47] bad childhood because your mom and dad
[2:08:49] abused you and was rough on you and too
[2:08:51] hard on you well you just let anything
[2:08:53] go at home I've just that guy went from
[2:08:56] preaching to middlin already to because
[2:08:59] you don't want to repeat the same cycle
[2:09:00] so you're too easy on them well you're
[2:09:02] just shifting it to the other side of
[2:09:03] the ditch here here's what's holding it
[2:09:06] there instead of keeping everything
[2:09:08] focused on the work and having
[2:09:10] discernment and saying god help me have
[2:09:12] me balance all of this out so it would
[2:09:16] be hard but not too hard help maybe lie
[2:09:18] but not too light but because mama was I
[2:09:20] was a authoritarian and disciplinarian
[2:09:24] and all that or daddy was I were afraid
[2:09:26] somebody yells at a child
[2:09:27] oh we shake all over and the devil knows
[2:09:30] that's there he knows that's there so he
[2:09:34] uses that against us you're going to
[2:09:37] find out before your changed that many
[2:09:39] of the battles that the devil fought you
[2:09:41] with was battles it was a part of you
[2:09:42] already things that you were dealing
[2:09:45] with already yourself and he just used
[2:09:47] it against you verse 7 7 7 and when the
[2:09:53] children of Israel heard it they were
[2:09:58] what afraid of the Philistines listen to
[2:10:05] me
[2:10:05] prophet quoting people I said my god did
[2:10:14] you see the Lord's up there they know
[2:10:17] they know we're done we've already lost
[2:10:20] 34 thousand people to these to this
[2:10:22] group to this army we know if we stand
[2:10:26] up against them they'll slap us again so
[2:10:30] watch what happens it's got down a first
[2:10:32] sandwich chapter 13 verse 5 remember
[2:10:37] because of the condition of Israel's
[2:10:40] fear there was actually peace and in
[2:10:43] Israel for many years after this last
[2:10:45] encounter that we just read it wasn't
[2:10:48] for sake of peace between the armies but
[2:10:51] it's because Israel just wouldn't pick
[2:10:52] the fight that reminds me the way people
[2:10:55] live sometimes it make deals with the
[2:10:57] devil I won't bother you you don't
[2:10:59] bother me okay
[2:11:00] don't make deals with the devil he
[2:11:02] crosses his fingers behind his back I'll
[2:11:07] leave you alone and you leave me alone
[2:11:08] okay he'll say okay I do it but don't
[2:11:11] you ever bite he's got his fingers
[2:11:13] crossed behind his back he don't never
[2:11:15] believe what I don't remember you know
[2:11:17] how to know the devil's line and lived
[2:11:19] for moving a mad he walked these people
[2:11:24] he won't be sincere if he promises I
[2:11:26] don't make deals with the devil it don't
[2:11:28] work well I'll just back off from being
[2:11:31] a
[2:11:32] fervent Christian maybe I won't fight so
[2:11:33] many battles and by doing so you already
[2:11:35] losing the battle because if you ain't
[2:11:38] fighting you ain't winning if you ain't
[2:11:40] losing some you ain't fightin hello
[2:11:44] right First Samuel 13 verse 5 for this
[2:11:50] thing's over with y'all want to go from
[2:11:51] shouting the paten aren't you we're
[2:11:55] getting to the good part just hold on
[2:11:56] hold on get through this first and the
[2:11:59] Philistines gathered himself together to
[2:12:01] fight with Israel
[2:12:02] thirty thousand chariots six thousand
[2:12:06] horsemen and people as the sand which is
[2:12:09] on the seashore in multitude they came
[2:12:11] up and pitched in mcNeish eastward
[2:12:14] toward Beth Haven I remember many times
[2:12:15] the children visitor wasn't permitted to
[2:12:17] ride horses and chariots and fight they
[2:12:19] were footmen so could you imagine this
[2:12:22] site when they look up here across the
[2:12:24] mountain and they see all of this
[2:12:25] gathered up there and they know we could
[2:12:30] lose maybe some I would speak up
[2:12:33] yes but the prophet of God said is a
[2:12:35] shot we've quoted in quotes all these
[2:12:38] years why not these 34,000 men that's
[2:12:41] about the way they do in divine healing
[2:12:43] they'll point to everybody didn't have
[2:12:44] enough faith to be healed by divine
[2:12:46] healing and everyone that backslidden
[2:12:48] left to church didn't have enough faith
[2:12:49] to say saved their point to all of those
[2:12:52] instead of pointing to the ones that are
[2:12:53] actually saved and I've been healed by
[2:12:55] the power of God the papers will pack a
[2:12:58] verb and said like this he said somebody
[2:13:00] died under divine healing the papers
[2:13:02] packet across the globe he said how many
[2:13:04] hospitals lost patients just today they
[2:13:07] don't say nothing about it
[2:13:08] that's what the devil does he changes
[2:13:11] the focus of it he changes the look of
[2:13:13] it so that he can convince you it's a
[2:13:15] different way of looking at it he
[2:13:17] changes emphasis many times he
[2:13:19] emphasizes your mistakes
[2:13:21] hey brother if the devil come to you and
[2:13:23] told you every good thing you ever done
[2:13:24] it wouldn't be much of a fight the devil
[2:13:28] ever told you how many times he's ever
[2:13:29] whipped you anybody ever have the devil
[2:13:31] come to you and let you know how many
[2:13:32] times you whipped it anybody any demon
[2:13:35] give you a resume or a readout or an
[2:13:37] updated printed out version of how many
[2:13:39] times you've won battles nobody me
[2:13:42] either
[2:13:44] but what do they do they always focus
[2:13:47] them spirits always emphasize you know
[2:13:51] the last time you tried that you know
[2:13:53] what happened you know the last time you
[2:13:55] felt like shouting brother so-and-so was
[2:13:58] looking at you awful hard when you
[2:13:59] started shouting you know the last time
[2:14:02] you sang that song you made a mess out
[2:14:03] of it and you know you get up there and
[2:14:09] then people think you can sing or think
[2:14:11] you can play you mess it up though
[2:14:13] you're going to look like the fool share
[2:14:14] the world and yet I'll never say to you
[2:14:20] you know what you can get up here and if
[2:14:23] you get under the anointing the Holy
[2:14:24] Ghost you may mess up but God will bless
[2:14:25] it anyhow it never tells you if you
[2:14:29] start shouting it's going to be the
[2:14:31] greatest experience you've had this week
[2:14:32] you never hear that other devil in
[2:14:34] that's strange you never even talk that
[2:14:36] way you know why always wants to focus
[2:14:38] on your lost part that's what keeps you
[2:14:41] down that's why you must recognize no
[2:14:44] matter how many times you lose God in
[2:14:47] you is greater than he that is in this
[2:14:50] world that's the key of the overcoming
[2:14:53] of it it's not how many times I whip him
[2:14:56] it's how many times I let Jesus with him
[2:14:57] out of me hey man hey man watch this now
[2:15:01] and when the men events are far they
[2:15:03] went straight for the people were
[2:15:06] distressed then the people hid
[2:15:10] themselves in caves it rolled up their
[2:15:17] books and their spoken word books and
[2:15:18] they ran with the games boy had enough
[2:15:21] of this mess I've lost in loss and loss
[2:15:25] of anglers and no more I'd rather be a
[2:15:28] coward than to be found out there dead
[2:15:32] at least in this thicket back here my
[2:15:34] head will be on my shoulders
[2:15:38] that's about the way some people live
[2:15:40] for God I'll just kind of you know hide
[2:15:43] myself I won't talk about God all the
[2:15:46] time and and I might say a few little
[2:15:48] easy light cuss words just to kind of
[2:15:50] you know keep everybody from thinking
[2:15:52] I'm a certain type person that's you
[2:15:55] hidin in the thicket
[2:15:57] well glory to God I'd be afraid I'd be
[2:16:01] afraid to testify that Jesus in the
[2:16:03] workplace because I'm there to work
[2:16:05] after all I talk about God well there's
[2:16:08] the truth to that but what if God moves
[2:16:11] on your heart to testify to somebody
[2:16:12] while you're there huh
[2:16:15] you're hiding you thicket I remember
[2:16:17] some time ago a young lady that she's
[2:16:19] back slid now but my wife was working
[2:16:21] with him and they were sitting there one
[2:16:24] day and a certain subject come up and
[2:16:26] all at once there she is in the office
[2:16:28] for all these women I mean you talk
[2:16:29] about man-hating type women Jezebel last
[2:16:31] days I think
[2:16:32] Laurel dimers didn't talk about God they
[2:16:34] will talk about none that kind of stuff
[2:16:36] I want to put their husbands down at
[2:16:38] home how sorry they were and all this
[2:16:39] that all of a sudden this young lady got
[2:16:42] to talk about the Lord and my wife
[2:16:44] become anointed to start testifying to
[2:16:45] her and told her about Jesus thought
[2:16:47] about salvation she's must be a message
[2:16:49] girl but told her says you don't get
[2:16:51] rights you're going to hell because
[2:16:53] there ain't no heaven for a place with a
[2:16:54] person that's got doubt in their heart
[2:16:56] and got the sin of the world in their
[2:16:58] heart you got to get saved and some of
[2:17:00] them women boy they was a real in their
[2:17:02] neck around at her and what in the world
[2:17:04] but I said that's right I said if a man
[2:17:07] a woman is full of the Holy Ghost by
[2:17:08] them said it gives them boldness they're
[2:17:11] not afraid who's listening to him I'm
[2:17:13] not afraid who's looking a man but
[2:17:15] instead what was these people doing they
[2:17:17] were hiding away because they were
[2:17:19] afraid they would lose again well I tell
[2:17:23] people I'm a Christian but I keep making
[2:17:25] so many mistakes how in the world are
[2:17:27] people going to think I'm a Christian
[2:17:29] with all the mistakes I make you know
[2:17:30] the bem said he said overcome that thing
[2:17:32] just a few times and watch your
[2:17:34] testimony bloom you don't even have to
[2:17:38] to permanently overcome it just let
[2:17:40] people see you trying that respects you
[2:17:43] for that down in the heart they'll
[2:17:44] respect you for being honest but these
[2:17:47] people are hiding look at them in the
[2:17:50] thickets in the caves and the rocks and
[2:17:52] the high places in pits last prophet
[2:17:58] quoting people doing in pits wins and
[2:18:04] losses
[2:18:07] now let's turn to the first time in 28
[2:18:09] verse 4 now let's read together just
[2:18:13] just a couple verses here about the
[2:18:15] leader of Israel let's see what was the
[2:18:17] problem of Saul when the Philistines
[2:18:20] gathered himself together and came and
[2:18:22] pitched and shoot him
[2:18:23] Saul gathered all Israel together and
[2:18:26] they pitched in Gilboa when saul saw the
[2:18:30] host of the Philistines he was
[2:18:33] encouraged by the Lord grabbed his sword
[2:18:36] PHAB his shield to cut envoys of fires
[2:18:40] this way he was afraid and he greatly
[2:18:48] trembled the world has an expression
[2:18:52] it's called the armchair leader now what
[2:18:58] that means is when a person is an
[2:18:59] armchair leader do these move ok yeah
[2:19:03] when a person is the armchair they have
[2:19:06] armchair quarterbacks armchair
[2:19:09] politicians and what it basically means
[2:19:12] is this a person if they're armchair
[2:19:14] quarterback that can sit there like this
[2:19:16] watch the football game and tell them
[2:19:19] every play they should have made
[2:19:22] everywhere the Super Bowl what was his
[2:19:24] name Tom Brady I think the Patriots
[2:19:26] right I was in Pennsylvania preaching
[2:19:29] the weekend that they won the Super Bowl
[2:19:30] and after we got done with church we
[2:19:31] went to a little place that served mom
[2:19:33] and pop style pizza you know we got a
[2:19:35] piece of my wife and I was heading back
[2:19:37] to the room I'm going to enjoy the rest
[2:19:38] of the night we're sitting in there and
[2:19:40] there's these three men gather around
[2:19:41] television and it's just about over with
[2:19:44] the Patriots about to lose and there's
[2:19:47] this one old boy and they were just a
[2:19:48] hot and as a glory to God well they
[2:19:50] didn't go to God as if our son so I tell
[2:19:53] you what I do right now and I looked at
[2:19:55] him and I thought you 450 pounds easy
[2:19:58] and I'd say you are more familiar with a
[2:20:01] Little Debbie than you are a football
[2:20:03] plays not other guy on the other side of
[2:20:07] him he was saying okay after I do boy I
[2:20:09] get that barn discharge through all of
[2:20:12] them and I said I doubt very much that
[2:20:14] that guy gets up out of his chair to
[2:20:16] change the television with a remoteness
[2:20:18] and much less charge through a line like
[2:20:20] that
[2:20:21] with the football man and the other guy
[2:20:23] he was going on and he was a whopper too
[2:20:25] and he was evidence running I would do
[2:20:29] this and I would do that and I thought
[2:20:32] and that's something they can sit in the
[2:20:35] armchair and tell everybody else how to
[2:20:37] do it but they'll never get on the field
[2:20:40] of battle and show them how it's done
[2:20:42] well everybody that doubted mr. Brady
[2:20:44] they found out real quick what grit and
[2:20:46] determination will do for a man because
[2:20:49] if they were betting people I'm sure
[2:20:50] there's almost a lot of money on that
[2:20:52] deal and there were gamblers all over
[2:20:54] the country so disappointed they could
[2:20:55] only stand it they were changing their
[2:20:57] bets halfway through the game sitting in
[2:21:01] the armchair armchair politicians I'll
[2:21:04] tell you how to run this country some
[2:21:06] poor old boy in Tennessee he's got one
[2:21:08] tooth in his head he's got $5.00 in his
[2:21:10] bank account and yet he's gonna tell me
[2:21:12] how to run this nation arm-chair saul
[2:21:19] was this kind of man you got the
[2:21:22] scripture there sister flash it again
[2:21:24] look look look at what kind of man this
[2:21:27] was saw saw the horse of the Philistines
[2:21:32] so what did he do nothing he sat back
[2:21:37] well I wonder what these boys are going
[2:21:40] to do about all this hey man you're the
[2:21:41] King you're the ones supposed to be
[2:21:43] doing the thing you're supposed to be
[2:21:45] leading him to battle why aren't you
[2:21:47] standing up and said anything because he
[2:21:49] was too busy hiding in the armchair but
[2:21:52] see David was a man trained under a
[2:21:54] different atmosphere David had wins and
[2:22:01] losses as well but he didn't let him
[2:22:03] affect him hey you only gonna tell me
[2:22:06] that every time David slung his rock he
[2:22:08] hit the bear you ain't gonna tell me
[2:22:10] every time he threw that little sling
[2:22:11] that he got the lion every time I'm sure
[2:22:14] there were times that David probably mr.
[2:22:16] bear and he almost became a lion supper
[2:22:20] but he knew God was with him and no
[2:22:23] matter how many times he messed up he
[2:22:26] knew that God would be with him no
[2:22:27] matter what was going on so when he
[2:22:29] walked up now if you go back to our text
[2:22:31] when we started God Goliath rose to make
[2:22:33] his big brag
[2:22:34] the moment he makes his bag David hears
[2:22:39] the words could you imagine what it must
[2:22:43] have been his brothers and all them
[2:22:44] standing around watching give me a man
[2:22:47] to fight and David's going goody-goody
[2:22:53] this is going to keep good which one of
[2:22:55] these boys all have been he'll get him
[2:22:57] he's at least eight foot tall man that
[2:22:59] guy he's a left-handed fighter I bet
[2:23:01] he'll come at him by surprise take his
[2:23:03] head plumb off his shoulders and the
[2:23:05] more Goliath talking the more that the
[2:23:07] men was he'll give me a man to fight
[2:23:14] David go where y'all going
[2:23:21] uh-uh what were y'all going and nobody
[2:23:28] going fight huh anybody yeah then we'll
[2:23:33] fight him he said well glory to God you
[2:23:38] bunch of cows y'all won't take him I
[2:23:40] will I like determination like that he
[2:23:47] didn't look at the odds he didn't look
[2:23:48] at the circumstances or listen to me he
[2:23:51] didn't look at what was going on around
[2:23:52] him and if he looked at a website it
[2:23:55] didn't influence in that much David said
[2:23:59] God's with us the word says that were
[2:24:02] circumcised he's an uncircumcised
[2:24:05] philistine he don't have a promise he
[2:24:07] don't have a covenant he don't have
[2:24:08] nothing so when David shows up to Saul's
[2:24:11] chambers you know Saul's doing of course
[2:24:15] sitting in the armchair he's not willing
[2:24:19] to fight he's like that guy from
[2:24:21] Louisville that was telling the fireman
[2:24:23] squirt a little water here squirt a
[2:24:24] little water there but Dave is like the
[2:24:27] guy from Clarksville who before they
[2:24:29] could get to the fire the ladder was
[2:24:31] over to going up and he was at the top
[2:24:32] of the ladder kicking a window open with
[2:24:34] us with the with the hole slung over
[2:24:35] shows a convoy surprise this way that
[2:24:39] was the kind of man David was David
[2:24:42] might have had wins and losses as well
[2:24:44] but he did that affect him
[2:24:48] because everybody was looking at
[2:24:49] Goliath's being 9 foot tall but David
[2:24:52] was saying um Goliath and look behind
[2:24:55] you Goliath look behind you there's
[2:25:00] somebody bigger there behind you he
[2:25:05] wasn't looking at Goliath he was looking
[2:25:07] at his big gods over that was behind him
[2:25:10] Alleluia
[2:25:11] as long as he kept his eyes on Jehovah
[2:25:14] and not on his wins and losses he knew
[2:25:17] that no matter how many times he put on
[2:25:19] that rock and failed there was a purpose
[2:25:22] wars are fought for principles and David
[2:25:25] knew that this armor needed some courage
[2:25:27] so he throws his stone I love a bit of
[2:25:30] em says and why Christ speak in 1963
[2:25:32] Brennan said David knew he was
[2:25:34] vindicated to be a good shot come on
[2:25:38] somebody he knew that if God ever got a
[2:25:42] hold a lock that he would take Goliath
[2:25:45] down ha together so he didn't have fear
[2:25:50] Saul said David David David come on boy
[2:25:55] he's been a warrior from his youth he
[2:25:58] knows more about he has forgotten more
[2:26:00] about fighting than you know yourself
[2:26:02] he said yeah but you don't realize I'm a
[2:26:06] little bitty old guy 90 pounds soaking
[2:26:09] wet
[2:26:09] little ruddy thing and a line about 500
[2:26:13] pounds came up to get one of my father's
[2:26:15] sheep so what kind of odds would you put
[2:26:18] on me if you were betting people I
[2:26:21] imagine if you saw David on one side of
[2:26:22] the hill Goliath on the other who would
[2:26:24] you cast you bet board you know how the
[2:26:28] ultimate fighters are when they put them
[2:26:29] in the cage they match them up between
[2:26:32] their scythes wrestlers they put them
[2:26:33] between their sides and their height and
[2:26:35] their ability to throw or whatever it is
[2:26:37] this guy knows jiu-jitsu or this guy
[2:26:39] knows Taekwondo or this guy's a boxer
[2:26:41] whatever is they they match them up if
[2:26:44] you'd have been casting Lots on which
[2:26:46] one you thought was going to win this
[2:26:48] battle when David comes running up there
[2:26:50] and he's got little spindly skinny arms
[2:26:52] he's probably hunts back a little bit
[2:26:55] from leaning over on the Sheep all day
[2:26:57] and here's Goliath at his glistening
[2:26:59] armor
[2:27:00] standing up before all of the people and
[2:27:03] all their glory and all their power let
[2:27:05] everybody know how tough he is who would
[2:27:07] you put your money on you'd have chose
[2:27:13] the guy that looked like you had the
[2:27:15] fight won that's what the devil likes to
[2:27:19] do he likes to put your focus upon what
[2:27:23] you see but it was because David was
[2:27:27] looking to the unseen and looking to
[2:27:30] God's promise that's the reason David
[2:27:33] wasn't in the armchair he was willing to
[2:27:36] fight Saul used to be that kind of man
[2:27:38] but he lost it he lost the anointing
[2:27:41] fort he thought that it was easier to
[2:27:43] send people off to do it and you
[2:27:45] remember one of the main times that
[2:27:47] David got in trouble that he got in
[2:27:49] trouble that she even got trouble with
[2:27:50] the Lord you remember it was the very
[2:27:52] same time he sent your ayah to the
[2:27:53] frontline of the battle that wasn't in
[2:27:56] David's character because David usually
[2:27:58] the guy riding to the front of the
[2:27:59] battle himself amazing how Satan would
[2:28:03] use such things against the people but
[2:28:07] David didn't listen to none of it he
[2:28:10] heard Goliath say send me man he said
[2:28:14] I'll be your man I'll be your
[2:28:15] huckleberry you want to fight let's
[2:28:18] fight boy he said what is this a dog is
[2:28:23] in the dog to fight about he said I'll
[2:28:27] take your flesh and feed him to the
[2:28:28] thousand-aire oh I like this David said
[2:28:32] bring it on and we'll see who's feeding
[2:28:34] who to what you see what he was doing
[2:28:38] he's putting the word before him the
[2:28:43] word of his testimony because see that's
[2:28:44] the only way you can overcome is you got
[2:28:47] to recognize God's already give you the
[2:28:49] battle before you even face you Goliath
[2:28:52] that's the power of true overcoming
[2:28:56] listen that again let me read it to you
[2:28:58] one more time and how can overcome the
[2:29:00] sort of BAM said let me read you one
[2:29:02] more time is close he says you must
[2:29:04] recognize him a real devil you must know
[2:29:06] he's a real devil when you recognize him
[2:29:09] and know that he's a devil and he's
[2:29:11] against you then to overcome
[2:29:14] you must recognize that God in you is
[2:29:17] greater and mightier than he is and the
[2:29:22] one that is in you hallelujah
[2:29:25] has already overcoming you're not
[2:29:30] waiting on overcoming you've already
[2:29:32] overcome you've just got to accept it
[2:29:35] that's the whole reason I think
[2:29:37] sometimes we don't get the deliverance
[2:29:40] we want to get brother BAM talked about
[2:29:42] this little crow it had to bring tied
[2:29:46] around his leg
[2:29:48] little been said the farmer would let
[2:29:50] that little crow go this far and then
[2:29:51] let him go that far so one day the
[2:29:53] farmer untied him but that crow still
[2:29:56] believed that he was tied and so he only
[2:29:59] went so far this way and so far that way
[2:30:01] he was already delivered he just didn't
[2:30:03] recognize it that's where it is with us
[2:30:06] that I don't let your winds and your
[2:30:09] losses blinds you because no matter how
[2:30:11] much you win or lose the real overcoming
[2:30:14] is recognizing that God is in your heart
[2:30:18] because if he's there
[2:30:20] nobody can overcome you and we might
[2:30:23] lose the battles excuse me for being
[2:30:25] cliche we may lose many battles but we
[2:30:28] will not lose this war we've been
[2:30:31] promised to overcome in the last day god
[2:30:35] bless you let's stand again praise the
[2:30:40] Lord
[2:30:42] you believe it is it for you can you
[2:30:47] identify with it Amen let's pray
[2:30:50] together Lord Jesus thank you father for
[2:30:54] what we've heard tonight Lord no matter
[2:30:57] how many times I go over this little
[2:30:59] thought it always has such influence to
[2:31:02] me such a power and God and I realized
[2:31:05] reason it influences me so much is
[2:31:07] because it's so much a part of my life
[2:31:10] there are times I preach Lord Jesus or
[2:31:14] such favor in the church and favor in
[2:31:16] the congregation it's just one win after
[2:31:19] another after another after another in
[2:31:20] the congregation to see my people are
[2:31:22] just lining up in successes and things
[2:31:24] and God there's times you go into a
[2:31:27] church and there's
[2:31:28] their reasoning in their doubt in there
[2:31:29] they've had struggles that all in the
[2:31:31] valley is it were it seemed like you get
[2:31:34] done preaching you don't even feel like
[2:31:35] you've even got through anywhere at home
[2:31:38] as a dad I feel that very way I win I
[2:31:41] lose as a husband I win I lose sometimes
[2:31:46] when I feel like I should be a certain
[2:31:48] way I find myself falling so short no
[2:31:51] doubt that's what Paul said the good I
[2:31:52] would I do not the things that don't
[2:31:54] want to do if I myself doing he
[2:31:56] recognizes that once the Holy Ghost
[2:31:58] comes to a man it doesn't change his
[2:31:59] flesh at law still exists in his flesh
[2:32:03] but God help us each one of us tonight I
[2:32:07] pray help us to come to the realization
[2:32:10] of what we really are as your children
[2:32:14] God that were not just a bunch of
[2:32:16] fly-by-nights so her brother Brendan say
[2:32:18] it the other night is it the true child
[2:32:21] of God isn't a fly-by-night a man means
[2:32:24] that we're here today gone tomorrow but
[2:32:25] Lord we're in this for the long haul
[2:32:28] Lord in the long term but help us
[2:32:31] recognize it cuz God this what I preach
[2:32:34] tonight is what gets so many of us wins
[2:32:36] and losses we can identify with these
[2:32:40] children of Israel here each one of us
[2:32:42] can look back over the course of our
[2:32:44] life and see how many times that you've
[2:32:46] been there for us and we've won and one
[2:32:49] and one and one and then Lord it seems
[2:32:52] like after 15 wins or 50 wins we have
[2:32:56] won great loss and the whole bottom
[2:32:58] falls out of it a lot of it is because
[2:33:01] Lord we want to please you we want to
[2:33:03] serve you with trueness we want to serve
[2:33:06] you with perfection but God what we need
[2:33:09] to realize tonight is that no Christian
[2:33:11] can serve in a perfect way they serve do
[2:33:15] flaws they serve through mistakes they
[2:33:17] serve through growing they serve through
[2:33:20] learning they serve through all of it
[2:33:22] you said be you therefore perfect but
[2:33:25] Lord that word doesn't mean sinless
[2:33:27] perfection
[2:33:27] it means maturity well I may not be able
[2:33:31] to handle everything perfectly but Lord
[2:33:34] I can handle with maturity if I do wrong
[2:33:36] I can repent if I make a mistake I can
[2:33:38] clean it up and straighten it out that's
[2:33:40] being mature
[2:33:41] it's not wallowing in things it's
[2:33:43] dealing with them looking things eyeball
[2:33:46] to eyeball god we've run from our
[2:33:47] problems so long in this message people
[2:33:49] try to pretend like we don't have any
[2:33:51] issues what a shame what a shame when
[2:33:54] you are the very God that died on
[2:33:55] Calvary so that you could heal us of our
[2:33:58] mistakes and our failures and misgivings
[2:34:01] Lord we don't want to slap you in the
[2:34:03] face or trample your blood by trying to
[2:34:05] pretend like we have no errors we do we
[2:34:09] do but lord help us recognize Alleluia

[2:40:01] tonight hallelujah thank you Jesus
[2:40:08] Oh glory to God glory to God hallelujah
[2:40:17] Jesus my how we certainly appreciate the
[2:40:25] word of the Lord that was brought to our
[2:40:28] hearts tonight and man rather than just
[2:40:34] was going through wins and losses and
[2:40:38] you know I think if we were to be honest
[2:40:40] with ourselves we look at the history of
[2:40:42] the nation of Israel and how often they
[2:40:46] found themselves living in the fear and
[2:40:48] the reason they lived in fears because
[2:40:51] of the things that they experienced
[2:40:53] oftentimes we kind of go through that
[2:40:56] whether it's a sickness in our body or
[2:40:58] some trial that we're trying to overcome
[2:41:00] a man we look at others that might have
[2:41:03] been defeated and we wonder if we can
[2:41:05] actually overcome in that but I tell you
[2:41:08] what greater is He that is in you
[2:41:10] that he that is in the world and if
[2:41:13] there's nothing else she got out this
[2:41:15] tonight a man to just just know that
[2:41:18] your God is great I mean when David
[2:41:20] looked at situation he saw something
[2:41:22] different than the rest of them Amen
[2:41:24] even though he had gone through
[2:41:25] different battles and maybe lost some
[2:41:27] but I think David focused on his
[2:41:29] victories but when he went before Saul
[2:41:31] he just began to testify what God had
[2:41:34] already done this they looked at this
[2:41:35] giant gonna be just like the lion and
[2:41:37] just like the bear
[2:41:39] so focus on what God is already done
[2:41:41] before you don't focus on a man on the
[2:41:43] negative part focus on the positive part
[2:41:45] amen it's only the devil that want to
[2:41:48] focus on the negatives brother ben god
[2:41:50] bless you we really appreciate you
[2:41:52] tonight we really appreciated that
[2:41:57] tonight my my my my my my mind that was
[2:42:03] that was all right I just thank God for
[2:42:05] it I really do I really do
[2:42:07] amen I was we won't do this but I was
[2:42:11] just thinking amen
[2:42:13] last time the other families here I
[2:42:16] don't nothing the last time on time
[2:42:18] before that but we have a song on on the
[2:42:21] church website Holy Spirit rain on us
[2:42:26] yeah and and and that song when you
[2:42:29] listen to it on the church website the
[2:42:32] organ player for the band he's the one
[2:42:35] that was playing the organ on that song
[2:42:37] that we put there and and we just thank
[2:42:40] God for it for the talent yes
[2:42:42] a man was singing the word and we leave
[2:42:46] here inspired and courage and
[2:42:47] strengthened and I believe we leave here
[2:42:50] overcoming hey man we're not defeated we
[2:42:52] are we are over cometh a man praise the
[2:42:56] Lord
[2:42:57] I mean let's just have a word of Prayer
[2:42:58] and we'll prepare to dismiss you tonight
[2:43:03] I'm one that truly believes that if we
[2:43:06] would hold on to what God gave us it
[2:43:09] tonight whatever it is that you're
[2:43:11] facing that thing will change it meant
[2:43:14] by the round and say the right mental
[2:43:15] attitude towards ending divine promise
[2:43:17] we'll bring it to pass
[2:43:19] a man so have the right attitude as you
[2:43:21] go out of here tonight no matter what
[2:43:23] you're facing you are an overcomer Amen
[2:43:26] father we are blessed
[2:43:30] to hear the words that we heard you
[2:43:32] tonight and god how real it is we as
[2:43:37] human beings we know that we go through
[2:43:39] times we have wins and losses but God
[2:43:44] where we're determined to focus on the
[2:43:46] wins
[2:43:46] we're determined amen the focus on your
[2:43:50] greatness not ours because when we step
[2:43:52] out there in our own what with our own
[2:43:55] strength we fail every time but God
[2:43:57] knowing that the greater one lives on
[2:43:59] the inside of us and God you've never
[2:44:01] lost the battle the Lord we we rest on
[2:44:04] that so we pray God that you would help
[2:44:06] us for to all just do that evaluation of
[2:44:09] our own lives and God after doing that
[2:44:12] may we reflect on the on the things that
[2:44:14] you have done for us that calls us to be
[2:44:17] victorious reminds of another minister
[2:44:20] denominational minister made a comment
[2:44:22] so we fight from a place of victory not
[2:44:25] fight to get the victory God's you're
[2:44:27] the one that won the victory account and
[2:44:29] Lord we fight from that place so help us
[2:44:32] God
[2:44:32] stay hidden behind the cross amen hidden
[2:44:36] and underneath the blood that you God
[2:44:38] would just continue to give us power
[2:44:40] over the enemy there might be some here
[2:44:43] tonight suffering in their body Lord may
[2:44:46] they not look at the symptoms but may
[2:44:47] they look at the promise that God has
[2:44:49] given them and made a whole to God's
[2:44:52] unchanging hand no matter who else has
[2:44:55] gone down Lord may they know that you've
[2:44:57] made them a promise and your promise
[2:44:59] word cannot fail you were wounded for
[2:45:02] our transgressions bruised for our
[2:45:03] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[2:45:05] is upon you and with your stripes we are
[2:45:08] healed God whatever it is that the
[2:45:13] people are facing tonight Lord if
[2:45:16] faintness brought all types of
[2:45:17] condemnation may they know that if they
[2:45:20] walk after the spirit and not after the
[2:45:22] blest and they don't have to be
[2:45:23] condemned
[2:45:24] Lord but they can think and they can
[2:45:26] stand in the place of victory even
