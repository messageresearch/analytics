[30:53] bless you
[30:56] um before i do this little song i want
[30:59] to give a quick little
[31:00] testimony um
[31:04] couple of nights ago i was at home and i
[31:07] had already gone to bed
[31:09] and i was awakened i think about an
[31:11] accidental phone call
[31:13] so
[31:14] it's about 2 a.m in the morning and i
[31:16] couldn't go back to sleep so i was just
[31:17] laying there and i was just thinking
[31:19] thinking on the goodness of god
[31:21] and um
[31:23] while i was just laying there thinking
[31:24] god just brought back to my remembrance
[31:27] um that how good his grace actually is
[31:33] and i gave my husband a call he was at
[31:35] work and i said honey you know what
[31:36] i'm laying here and i'm just thinking of
[31:38] the goodness of god
[31:39] and i say his grace is just so
[31:41] sufficient
[31:43] i said you know this month
[31:45] makes you know the number of grace is
[31:47] five
[31:48] and this month makes five years that
[31:51] i've been cancer-free
[31:53] [Applause]
[32:02] as i lay there and i just pondered on a
[32:04] number five and things just kept coming
[32:07] to me and i told them i said you know
[32:10] when that tumor popped up on my head
[32:12] actually in january on the new year's
[32:16] service is when i said i was gave a
[32:18] testimony i said i'm not going to go
[32:20] back to the doctor because i've been
[32:21] going to a hematologist for two years
[32:23] and they kept saying you got some
[32:25] infection in your body your body is
[32:26] fighting something because the
[32:28] autoimmune is just going crazy but we
[32:29] can't find it
[32:31] so two years i've been seeing this
[32:32] doctor
[32:33] and in january at the new year's service
[32:35] i said you know what i'm not going back
[32:37] i'm just leaving in god's hand and
[32:40] that five exactly five months later
[32:44] in june is when that tumor popped up on
[32:46] my head
[32:47] and i look at that and i say you know
[32:49] that was nothing but the grace of god
[32:50] again number five exactly five months
[32:53] later it was in june
[32:55] um
[32:56] and because that tumor could have been
[32:58] anywhere in my body and i wouldn't have
[32:59] seen it
[33:00] um it was lymphoma it could have been
[33:03] anywhere
[33:04] could have been in my any of my organs i
[33:06] wouldn't have never known it was there
[33:07] but he allowed it to pop up right on the
[33:10] top of my head where i could see it and
[33:13] i just know that was nothing but the
[33:14] grace of god again
[33:17] and
[33:18] and as i just laid there and pondered

[33:32] to the mechanic he said you're gonna
[33:34] have to have somebody open up the engine
[33:36] that's gonna be real costly

[33:56] having it for five years so i say that
[33:57] was nothing but again by the grace of
[33:59] god

[52:02] continue to pray for us
[52:04] trusting that god will just continue to
[52:07] open up doors that we can go in and just
[52:10] uh
[52:11] minister the word of god i was listening
[52:14] to a little message a couple of weeks
[52:16] ago um
[52:19] you know when i'm riding i normally pop
[52:21] in a tape
[52:22] you know to just kind of um
[52:25] settle my mind
[52:27] uh because you know like everybody else
[52:29] during the run of the week
[52:31] we like wild people
[52:33] we just kind of in and out up and down
[52:36] and and by 9 10 o'clock
[52:39] we just
[52:42] you know we don't hardly have time if
[52:44] you got children y'all knowing oh my
[52:47] you're running them here you're doing
[52:48] this you're doing that if you work it's
[52:51] it's a constant constant uh battle all
[52:54] the time so sometimes
[52:56] you got to get it where you can
[52:59] i know some of y'all might spend all
[53:01] time you know four five hours every day
[53:04] listening to the prophet and reading
[53:06] your books fine but don't criticize the
[53:08] folks that don't
[53:10] praise the lord hallelujah glory to god
[53:14] amen because we all do not do it
[53:18] amen
[53:20] uh but we still need to sing the song
[53:22] lord make us desperate
[53:25] um that's that's just that's just life
[53:28] life
[53:29] life keeps us busy sometimes uh but i
[53:32] was i was i was listening to
[53:35] uh this little this little message um
[53:39] uh does god change his mind about his
[53:41] word
[53:42] and brother branham he bring he
[53:44] you know he he brought out a statement
[53:46] we're going to get into it but i like to
[53:48] try to just live platform
[53:51] and and he said some things that
[53:53] you know encourage encourage me
[53:56] you know i thank god that god is a
[53:58] sovereign god
[54:00] god god gives us god gives us food and
[54:04] season
[54:05] god is inspirational god inspires a word
[54:10] for us
[54:11] in season
[54:13] is that right in in season god or god or
[54:17] let somebody say something i i
[54:20] appreciated the meetings that we had
[54:23] over the a couple of weeks ago uh i i
[54:26] feel like i was writing channel because
[54:29] i thought my god
[54:31] i might have to go rethink all of my
[54:33] messages because the brothers they just
[54:35] blew through everything that i thought i
[54:37] wanted to preach
[54:39] but uh i thank god that that we we got
[54:42] 66 books of the bible
[54:45] and a message so i'm i'm never really
[54:48] worried about that i just need god to
[54:50] inspire us
[54:52] and and you know sometimes you you look
[54:55] at you look at ministers
[54:57] and and you might think that we don't go
[54:59] through anything but that's not the
[55:01] truth we we have our ups and our downs
[55:04] and and you know when when we're
[55:06] anointed it feel like we we feel like we
[55:10] could jump through a truth
[55:12] right we we think you know we could make
[55:15] a way out of no way
[55:17] y'all unheard that
[55:19] he's a mighty good god yes he is
[55:23] and but that's just a gift that's the
[55:25] anointing that's the pull from the
[55:28] people
[55:29] right but but when you're not behind the
[55:31] platform
[55:32] it's it's it's totally totally different
[55:35] because you know you got to live
[55:37] everyday life
[55:40] and and what goes along with everyday
[55:43] life
[55:44] everyday life is filled with
[55:46] uncertainties
[55:49] right um
[55:50] just just when you think that
[55:53] you know uh everything is going good
[55:56] then something starts happening to your
[55:58] motor
[56:00] when you don't really want no payment
[56:03] you know
[56:05] just like me i'm riding and i'm i'm
[56:07] hitting animals in my little car
[56:10] like i i mean i think about i talk about
[56:13] another car in the future
[56:16] but that's the future i ain't ready to
[56:18] start all over again with payments
[56:21] but uh uh but life life is so so filled
[56:26] with
[56:26] uncertainties
[56:28] right we we
[56:30] we're living in a we're living in in a
[56:32] day in an hour where
[56:34] it just you just don't know all the time
[56:37] but that's things that we do know
[56:40] right and the things that we know has
[56:43] got to be scriptural
[56:46] because one of the things that i'm
[56:48] starting to realize
[56:50] that in in the midst of uncertain
[56:52] because you don't know if you're gonna
[56:53] have a job tomorrow we think we are when
[56:55] we wake up in the morning we got faith
[56:57] we we're just hoping to focus keep us
[57:00] there you know because we realize well i
[57:03] got bills to pay
[57:04] and they just constantly coming and and
[57:08] thank god you know my children are up
[57:10] and their adults and and and uh they're
[57:13] able to make their way but you know i
[57:16] still got a wife i still got bills to
[57:18] pay and and and you know it's just so
[57:21] much uncertainty
[57:24] associated with that
[57:26] and and and what what happens is when
[57:29] we're not sure about things
[57:31] uh
[57:32] buddy if you don't have a real true
[57:34] revelation or word of god man i tell you
[57:38] what it it it brings gloomy days
[57:42] right
[57:43] and and so i'm gonna read i'm gonna read
[57:45] this just quote it in a second as as we
[57:48] kind of get started i'm gonna be all day
[57:49] i'm just gonna take about two hours but
[57:51] we'll be all right
[57:54] y'all don't mind if i preach a two-hour
[57:56] sermon dude
[57:57] i'll preach two hours service
[58:00] i just want to test y'all
[58:03] you know i when i see a finger go up i
[58:06] know what that means when you go outside
[58:08] though
[58:10] i told him that brother stasis
[58:13] i i remember the cartoon with the little
[58:15] lion hangings the mercury
[58:17] troy he was pune
[58:21] but but
[58:22] uh inspirational wise while while i was
[58:26] i i was writing i was listening to the
[58:28] little message and i had to go back and
[58:31] and uh
[58:32] uh
[58:34] read and listen to the message previous
[58:36] because they both kind of dovetail
[58:39] uh it's the rising of the sun and i'm
[58:40] gonna tell you something i i don't
[58:42] normally do this but
[58:44] that's a really good book if you haven't
[58:46] read it in a while and really go back to
[58:49] it because
[58:51] i find that there's a lot of nuggets in
[58:54] there i might have got four five
[58:55] messages out of it
[58:57] uh i may preach it here if not i preach
[59:00] it where the lord leads us
[59:02] but but it's it's a lot and and i'm just
[59:05] saying all this to draw our background
[59:07] because
[59:08] uh in in listening to the prophet and
[59:10] studying a lot of times
[59:12] you know i i try to listen and get a get
[59:16] a
[59:16] feel for his heart
[59:20] right and and the reason
[59:22] and the reasoning behind
[59:24] why he's bringing what he's bringing
[59:28] right because because you know one of
[59:30] the things and studying for you know 35
[59:33] years now i i realized that that the
[59:36] messages wasn't just a man trying to be
[59:39] smart right
[59:41] not just trying to show knowledge
[59:44] but but the heart of a man
[59:47] trying trying to
[59:49] uh anchor a people i i appreciate i
[59:52] appreciated the brothers doing doing the
[59:55] uh uh meetings that friday night and the
[59:58] subject matter that they brought
[1:00:01] uh on malachi 4
[1:00:03] and uh
[1:00:04] man i was saying to myself during that
[1:00:07] time i said man that's a 50 minute
[1:00:10] 50 message subject
[1:00:12] you can't you can't begin to touch it i
[1:00:15] was watching the brother stumbling like
[1:00:17] 15 minutes i can't even get started to
[1:00:19] say anything
[1:00:21] pertaining to the scripture but then you
[1:00:23] realize
[1:00:24] god god sent us a prophet and gave him a
[1:00:27] ministry
[1:00:29] so that in these in these times of
[1:00:32] uncertainties in this in these times
[1:00:34] when the world is falling apart
[1:00:38] when when when the mentality and the
[1:00:41] minds of people
[1:00:43] is evil
[1:00:45] and when writers become wrong
[1:00:48] right and and just sometimes they're
[1:00:50] just talking to
[1:00:51] and and i don't say this to be critical
[1:00:54] these generations you realize that
[1:00:56] sometimes that
[1:00:59] they don't really have a clue they don't
[1:01:01] really they don't really
[1:01:03] um
[1:01:04] scripturally
[1:01:06] um understand where they
[1:01:08] are right and and for me that bothers me
[1:01:12] as a servant of god
[1:01:14] i have children
[1:01:17] right i i have children and and just
[1:01:20] kind of watching them navigate through
[1:01:22] life
[1:01:23] and i try to be right now because
[1:01:26] they're adults i try to you know
[1:01:28] allow them to make their their own
[1:01:30] choices and decisions
[1:01:33] and and
[1:01:34] it's it's difficult
[1:01:36] uh because i i just thought
[1:01:39] that man everything would go a certain
[1:01:41] way and you have to appreciate
[1:01:43] uh uh uh seeing pastors children in
[1:01:47] church
[1:01:49] worshiping god
[1:01:51] right um i'm riding with him
[1:01:54] right you you i mean you you just really
[1:01:57] have to
[1:01:58] applaud and give give god thanks
[1:02:02] cut it because it could have been
[1:02:03] another way
[1:02:06] right it could have been another way and
[1:02:08] but i'll say this you know for preachers
[1:02:11] children that
[1:02:13] may not right now
[1:02:16] be serving god in the way that we think
[1:02:18] they don't worry about it
[1:02:22] everything is everything is in control
[1:02:24] there's nothing out of catering god
[1:02:28] right
[1:02:29] there might be uncertainty in us
[1:02:32] but god is sure
[1:02:36] god is sure about what he's saying
[1:02:40] right
[1:02:41] god is sure about what he said and and
[1:02:45] and so
[1:02:46] brother branham the i think the night
[1:02:49] before he preached this message of
[1:02:51] of it's the rising of the sun
[1:02:54] and and and the next day when he
[1:02:57] preached this other message
[1:02:59] he was just trying to tell him yeah this
[1:03:01] this that message it was long if you
[1:03:03] read it if you listen to this rising sun
[1:03:05] that's probably about a three hour
[1:03:07] message
[1:03:09] right so you're probably going to have
[1:03:10] to listen to it and read the book and
[1:03:12] segment scope cause it'll kind of get to
[1:03:14] you and take your time
[1:03:16] but
[1:03:18] he was saying that it was something
[1:03:21] right that he felt like he had to get to
[1:03:25] the people
[1:03:27] right
[1:03:28] and so when when when i hear these
[1:03:30] things
[1:03:32] it's it's like
[1:03:35] to maybe to y'all those things don't
[1:03:36] mean anything but to me those little
[1:03:38] things mean a lot to me because i get
[1:03:40] inspired by those things and i realize
[1:03:43] when he says those things i can feel his
[1:03:46] heart and there's something that that
[1:03:49] he's looking at in the natural in the
[1:03:52] spiritual and seeing the importance
[1:03:56] right and i'm gonna help us
[1:03:59] this morning even in ministry when
[1:04:01] brothers jack is up here and things of
[1:04:03] that nature we we've got to be in the
[1:04:06] spirit right
[1:04:08] right brother bannon
[1:04:10] preached that he said you gotta be in
[1:04:12] the spirit to hear and know
[1:04:14] we we gotta we gotta try to make sure
[1:04:17] that that you know
[1:04:19] our minds is clear our hearts is right
[1:04:23] so that we could be in the spirit
[1:04:26] so that we can feel
[1:04:29] we can sense the urgency sometimes
[1:04:34] right
[1:04:35] feel feel the you know the heart
[1:04:38] a lot of times i've heard a lot i'm
[1:04:40] gonna get to where i want to go but
[1:04:41] y'all y'all just pray for me
[1:04:44] over the years we've heard a lot of
[1:04:46] criticisms and things of that nature
[1:04:49] of of of the message and and the
[1:04:52] messenger and uh
[1:04:55] for me for me
[1:04:57] here's what i do
[1:04:59] i listen i listen to the heart of the
[1:05:02] man
[1:05:04] i listen to what he's saying
[1:05:06] i try to to
[1:05:08] uh put myself right in there with him
[1:05:11] and and feel his heart
[1:05:14] right to make sure that he's
[1:05:17] he's sincere
[1:05:19] and and what he's saying and regardless
[1:05:22] of all the criticisms and regardless of
[1:05:25] you know people and regardless of the
[1:05:28] mistakes that they say he make he even
[1:05:30] said he makes mistakes
[1:05:33] i i feel the heart of the man and you
[1:05:36] see where the man is sincere
[1:05:40] in what he said and that means a lot to
[1:05:43] me
[1:05:45] the sincerity
[1:05:48] and the
[1:05:49] uh
[1:05:51] i'll just say that because i ain't gonna
[1:05:52] be able to pronounce this word it ain't
[1:05:54] gonna come out right
[1:05:56] right um so those things help me
[1:05:59] you know when i'm i'm studying and and
[1:06:02] i'm i'm reading the books and i'm
[1:06:04] listening to the tapes
[1:06:06] i want to get a sense of feeling
[1:06:10] i want to sense the urgency
[1:06:12] behind
[1:06:13] uh uh what he's saying
[1:06:16] and so so
[1:06:18] for me i believe that the profit of god
[1:06:21] in preaching the rising of the sun
[1:06:24] is to
[1:06:25] uh
[1:06:27] bring an anchor
[1:06:29] right
[1:06:30] to give us some sort of
[1:06:32] guarantee
[1:06:35] right we love guarantees now we try not
[1:06:38] to buy nothing without a guarantee
[1:06:40] we like uh guaranteeing your money back
[1:06:42] that sounds good to me because if this
[1:06:44] thing don't work out i'm coming back to
[1:06:46] get my money
[1:06:49] well praise the lord y'all can let folk
[1:06:50] have y'all money but i'm going back to
[1:06:52] get mine
[1:06:55] i got a cousin that i work with he will
[1:06:57] take stuff back
[1:06:59] to walmart or anywhere else i'd be like
[1:07:03] man you gonna take that cause i'm taking
[1:07:06] this back get my money they're gonna do
[1:07:08] something for me
[1:07:10] man if you give me a give him a
[1:07:12] guarantee you to you hey
[1:07:17] but but watch but watch this
[1:07:20] brother banham says in uh
[1:07:23] does god ever change his mind 1965.
[1:07:28] is is verse three
[1:07:30] i think on what i got his first he says
[1:07:34] and i
[1:07:34] i i can't say that i'll apologize for
[1:07:38] that long long message this morning i
[1:07:40] guess that was the morning he was
[1:07:41] preaching at night
[1:07:43] but
[1:07:44] it was he says i didn't want to
[1:07:47] wear out your patience and then come
[1:07:50] come at it again uh tonight
[1:07:54] but i wanted to get that message to you
[1:07:58] right
[1:07:59] amen
[1:08:00] and and this is the part when i heard it
[1:08:04] right in that day man sometimes i have
[1:08:06] to pull over to the side and write
[1:08:07] because it's just something that strikes
[1:08:09] me at a time where i where i need
[1:08:12] something
[1:08:13] right i'm a needy person
[1:08:16] right when it when it comes down to the
[1:08:19] things of god i'm a very needy person
[1:08:22] maybe y'all aren't but i'm needy i need
[1:08:26] y'all don't know nothing about that
[1:08:28] theo
[1:08:30] i wish i was in an old-fashioned church

[1:09:32] then i
[1:09:33] uh he said but i i want to get this
[1:09:35] message to you
[1:09:37] that you are
[1:09:39] a part
[1:09:40] of this resurrection
[1:09:43] and i thought man
[1:09:45] you said a mouthful then
[1:09:48] be
[1:09:49] and it's good to know these things
[1:09:51] because
[1:09:52] people we we want to be a part of a lot
[1:09:55] of stuff
[1:09:57] and things that be a part of things that
[1:10:00] really don't matter

[1:10:14] flying cool and all that i wanted to be
[1:10:17] a part of the who's who's

[1:10:22] when you when you link up with these
[1:10:25] folks you realize it you realize
[1:10:27] sometimes that these things being a part

[1:14:52] see i always get myself in trouble
[1:14:55] i'm trying to i'm trying to preach on
[1:14:57] something else the seal still holds
[1:15:01] but
[1:15:02] uh brother brother branham he says
[1:15:05] that you you
[1:15:07] are
[1:15:08] a part of this
[1:15:10] resurrection
[1:15:12] right
[1:15:13] sometimes just people need to know these
[1:15:16] little things that might seem to be my
[1:15:19] new because
[1:15:21] you you find this it is realistically
[1:15:24] it's a struggle a lot of times in church
[1:15:27] and there's a there's a lot of
[1:15:28] uncertainty
[1:15:30] right
[1:15:31] there's a lot of people
[1:15:33] unsure
[1:15:35] people are
[1:15:36] pursuing people are tossed about
[1:15:40] right
[1:15:41] look at our generation
[1:15:43] a lot of times
[1:15:45] i think back because i've been around
[1:15:47] south florida for 35 years
[1:15:51] right i may not have been to a lot of
[1:15:53] places where some of us has come from
[1:15:56] but this area alone i've been around for
[1:16:00] a mighty long time
[1:16:02] right and i've i've watched a lot of
[1:16:05] people
[1:16:07] young people
[1:16:08] right adults
[1:16:10] right
[1:16:11] come and go
[1:16:14] in and out
[1:16:16] right
[1:16:17] that that that shows you something
[1:16:20] right
[1:16:22] it shows that there's such a
[1:16:24] uh uncertainty
[1:16:28] right
[1:16:29] and then for the cr the criticisms about
[1:16:32] the word that shows that that's an
[1:16:35] uncertainty
[1:16:37] one thing that i'm sure about
[1:16:40] i'm sure about i'm safe
[1:16:43] like the old timers say
[1:16:46] sanctified holy ghost field
[1:16:49] five baptized i don't do everything
[1:16:53] that i supposed to do
[1:16:57] but a saint is just a sinner who falls
[1:17:00] down sometimes but to get back up
[1:17:02] we make mistakes even god's prophet god
[1:17:05] would speak to brother brown and
[1:17:08] tell him things to do and he would do
[1:17:09] the exact opposite
[1:17:12] does that dis-christianize him no
[1:17:15] right
[1:17:16] see i'm sure this morning i'm certain
[1:17:20] that something took place in me
[1:17:22] august of 1988
[1:17:25] i'm sure that
[1:17:27] you can't take that away from me
[1:17:29] i'm sure about that i'm certain
[1:17:33] there's there's been a change in my life
[1:17:37] i can clearly say
[1:17:39] you know what the places i used to go i
[1:17:42] don't go no more
[1:17:44] cause um
[1:17:45] monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday
[1:17:47] saturday sunday i was clubbing at one
[1:17:50] point
[1:17:51] and then when i got really deeply into
[1:17:53] drugs then i was somewhere looking crazy
[1:17:57] saturday sunday well i don't do those
[1:18:00] things no more haven't done it for 35
[1:18:02] years
[1:18:03] see
[1:18:04] so so when everybody's doing all of
[1:18:06] these things i'm certain about one thing
[1:18:09] i believe i am where
[1:18:11] god wants me to be at this morning
[1:18:15] now
[1:18:16] y'all got to speak for yourself
[1:18:19] right next week you might feel like
[1:18:22] i don't know what people be feeling
[1:18:23] sometime but that's up to y'all some
[1:18:26] things that
[1:18:27] i'm certain about
[1:18:29] right
[1:18:30] and and with this statement
[1:18:32] see
[1:18:34] that that gives me
[1:18:36] some sort of clarity i am a part
[1:18:41] of

[1:20:56] see
[1:20:57] the

[1:21:12] there's there is nothing nowhere can
[1:21:15] separate you from it
[1:21:19] right
[1:21:20] nothing
[1:21:23] this this is powerful statement here
[1:21:25] you're eternally
[1:21:27] secured in the kingdom of god
[1:21:31] right
[1:21:33] see
[1:21:34] when god has stamped his seal upon you
[1:21:39] you're to the end of your destination
[1:21:43] not
[1:21:44] to the
[1:21:45] time that you we all make mistakes
[1:21:49] right
[1:21:50] we we all since we've been a christian
[1:21:53] we we've made mistakes we got sometimes
[1:21:57] preach a realistic gospel to folk
[1:22:01] and especially to
[1:22:03] um
[1:22:04] our younger generation that's that's
[1:22:06] that's trying to get themselves together
[1:22:09] in god
[1:22:10] you know it's important for us to
[1:22:13] to give them some leeway
[1:22:16] because you know it used to be a time
[1:22:18] where we were very very very very very
[1:22:21] very legalistic
[1:22:23] and
[1:22:24] you know
[1:22:25] we didn't give room for growth
[1:22:29] like i said i've been around 35 years
[1:22:30] some of y'all ain't even 35 years old
[1:22:34] i've been around a little while don't
[1:22:35] make me an old man
[1:22:38] i'm still a young man 60 ain't old
[1:22:42] right
[1:22:43] but we used to be very realistic you
[1:22:46] know we used to like we say we bust them
[1:22:49] and we blast
[1:22:50] you know uh when we did have the church
[1:22:53] in okeechobee i got to a place um um
[1:22:57] and working with the saints of god that
[1:22:59] started to bother me
[1:23:02] when when when when i heard a heard of
[1:23:04] people when i blasted my church oh i
[1:23:08] busted it's like listen buddy we have
[1:23:11] got to preach the word of god
[1:23:13] and get out of the way
[1:23:16] and and allow for god to bring the
[1:23:19] growth
[1:23:22] and it's a good teaching tool for
[1:23:23] parents
[1:23:25] you can't beat your children into
[1:23:28] submission
[1:23:30] it's something some things has got to be
[1:23:32] quickened to them
[1:23:34] made alive
[1:23:36] right like like you know your baby they
[1:23:39] might touch something hot you ain't got
[1:23:41] to worry about them touching that no
[1:23:42] more
[1:23:43] right come on somebody
[1:23:46] i mean you don't want them to get burnt
[1:23:47] but they do that a couple of times you
[1:23:50] ain't got to worry about that mo they
[1:23:51] might go over that close to it and look
[1:23:53] at it but they've been touching they're
[1:23:55] like hot mommy hot
[1:23:57] yeah
[1:23:59] hot
[1:23:59] sugar baby hot
[1:24:03] it's certain things there's certain
[1:24:05] things that they they grow to
[1:24:08] i had a child that used to like to
[1:24:10] fall out
[1:24:11] just get
[1:24:14] fall
[1:24:15] but we had some terrorism floors in the
[1:24:18] house
[1:24:19] my mom old house
[1:24:22] no coffee was down there
[1:24:24] and buddy
[1:24:26] he used to fall out one day he fell out
[1:24:28] too hard and bumped that nougat
[1:24:36] boy look at him
[1:24:38] when he had to teach him
[1:24:40] after i remember why we used to just
[1:24:42] laugh i see y'all y'all don't believe
[1:24:44] this the amount of intelligence that
[1:24:47] kids actually have y'all think that
[1:24:49] they're not learning they're learning
[1:24:52] all the time
[1:24:54] after a while he's still trying to kick
[1:24:56] out and fun but he hey he fall
[1:25:00] down
[1:25:01] fall back put his hand put his hand back
[1:25:05] and when he when he when he realized his
[1:25:07] back and laid down then he kicked his
[1:25:10] feet
[1:25:11] i say you got six don't you baby
[1:25:14] and i mean he was probably about two
[1:25:16] years old
[1:25:19] right
[1:25:20] but you know
[1:25:21] you you you gotta give you got to give
[1:25:24] room
[1:25:25] the growth we listen church 35 years and
[1:25:29] i s i'm still growing
[1:25:32] i'm still growing i'm still a work in
[1:25:35] progress
[1:25:38] all right
[1:25:40] all of us
[1:25:42] all of us are still a work in progress
[1:25:45] right i know that
[1:25:48] i know we all still growing you're still
[1:25:51] maturing i don't care who you are how
[1:25:53] old you are how long you been married
[1:25:55] you still there's still
[1:25:58] growth still room for growth
[1:26:02] right
[1:26:04] amen we make we make mistakes
[1:26:07] but but the thing that the thing that i
[1:26:10] like
[1:26:11] is that you know
[1:26:13] uh
[1:26:14] you gotta know that you're sealed
[1:26:19] right
[1:26:21] amen you this is something that that you
[1:26:25] cannot
[1:26:27] at any time as ministry we can't never
[1:26:30] get to a place with with all of our
[1:26:33] preaching and all of our understanding
[1:26:35] get away from preaching the new birth
[1:26:41] amen you you because listen let's let's
[1:26:44] face it everybody's not born again
[1:26:50] people sing
[1:26:52] people are gifted people tell churches
[1:26:55] we do all of these things but then
[1:26:58] but then you you have the
[1:27:00] you know you just have to watch things
[1:27:04] and and
[1:27:05] people might be backsliding today
[1:27:07] you know
[1:27:12] they're part of god because we
[1:27:13] predestinated to adoption
[1:27:17] i thank god that you know what
[1:27:20] the day that god chose me
[1:27:23] you know that was
[1:27:25] 900 and however many
[1:27:28] you know i'm one in a million i put it
[1:27:31] that way i started trying to count then
[1:27:33] y'all know that i ain't been in school
[1:27:35] in a long time
[1:27:37] right sister tina she's the teacher i
[1:27:39] hate the teacher
[1:27:41] but god
[1:27:43] god had to walk walk over and says
[1:27:46] there's one right
[1:27:48] right
[1:27:50] and these things are important and i
[1:27:52] ain't screaming and hollering this
[1:27:53] morning i'm taking my time
[1:27:56] right so we could marinate on on on the
[1:27:59] points because sometimes we go to church
[1:28:01] and we scream and holler and we leave
[1:28:03] out empty
[1:28:04] yeah we'll praise the lord and put the
[1:28:06] glasses on i'm gonna get in trouble
[1:28:07] again
[1:28:09] i've been doing this a long time church
[1:28:12] really
[1:28:13] right
[1:28:14] but but what what you want you want to
[1:28:16] make sure that that we're certain
[1:28:20] right that that there's an assurance in
[1:28:23] our heart
[1:28:24] about about what jesus christ done for
[1:28:28] us
[1:28:30] brother branham says in the breach
[1:28:31] message he said he's talking about
[1:28:33] ephesians 4 30
[1:28:36] and he talks about the inspector
[1:28:39] right
[1:28:40] he he inspects he inspects the cargo
[1:28:45] before he ever puts a seal on it
[1:28:49] right
[1:28:50] because
[1:28:51] the contents in
[1:28:54] in the boxcar
[1:28:56] has got to reach
[1:28:58] its destination
[1:29:01] right glory to god
[1:29:04] so he
[1:29:05] inspects
[1:29:07] brother branham say the inspector
[1:29:10] he inspects
[1:29:12] the boxcar
[1:29:14] before he ever seals it
[1:29:17] right
[1:29:18] but once he but once he
[1:29:21] seals the car
[1:29:26] right
[1:29:27] that's the thing
[1:29:29] no and you know what we used to put
[1:29:31] emphasis on this right brother troy
[1:29:34] uh coming up
[1:29:36] when we were young converts and the
[1:29:38] thunders one thing that you know you you
[1:29:40] could look back on
[1:29:43] and and give credit to
[1:29:45] they want to make sure
[1:29:48] that that
[1:29:50] i believe that part of that that you
[1:29:52] were sealed
[1:29:55] is that right
[1:29:57] something that you had to know that
[1:29:59] something has taken place in you
[1:30:02] is that right
[1:30:03] amen something that you have got to have
[1:30:06] a revelation of you have got to be
[1:30:08] certain
[1:30:10] that that i'm sealed in
[1:30:13] and the devil is sealed out
[1:30:17] right
[1:30:19] glory to god
[1:30:20] i'm in
[1:30:22] he's out
[1:30:23] and the only way that he can get in
[1:30:26] which he ain't trying to get in because
[1:30:28] he do not want to be your brother
[1:30:33] he don't want to be your friend he wants
[1:30:35] to be your adversary
[1:30:39] like brother branham say the devil made
[1:30:41] me do it he said no he didn't
[1:30:43] no uh he didn't nope nope nope he said
[1:30:46] you did you came out
[1:30:49] you that's all
[1:30:50] you came out
[1:30:53] right
[1:30:54] amen
[1:30:55] in order for him to get you you had to
[1:30:57] come out
[1:30:59] because he ain't coming in
[1:31:01] because he don't want to be your homie
[1:31:06] he said you came out
[1:31:08] lusting for the things of the world
[1:31:12] wow big statement
[1:31:16] see so when you watch when you watch
[1:31:19] people and i don't want to be critical i
[1:31:20] want to be positive but it's something
[1:31:22] that's got to be said what happens to a
[1:31:25] lot of people
[1:31:27] is not that people don't have
[1:31:28] experiences and things it is it's that
[1:31:32] people come out
[1:31:34] they start lusting
[1:31:36] for for the things of the world
[1:31:40] right and being enticed
[1:31:43] right
[1:31:44] you know the the white horse rider uh
[1:31:48] under the the doctrine of of
[1:31:50] nickelodeonism
[1:31:52] you know it just seemed like it started
[1:31:56] out brother branham says a little saying
[1:31:59] right before it became a deed and and
[1:32:01] all of that it just was something that
[1:32:04] seemed so
[1:32:05] so
[1:32:06] inoffensive
[1:32:08] something that it just won't really hurt
[1:32:11] any no
[1:32:14] and that's how the devil presents sin
[1:32:18] right
[1:32:20] it's so inoffensive it's you know just a
[1:32:24] little bit but sin would take you
[1:32:27] further
[1:32:29] right than than you could even imagine
[1:32:35] right glory to god
[1:32:37] see it might start out amen
[1:32:40] you know just a little
[1:32:42] can i use myself as an example
[1:32:45] you know that there was a time when i
[1:32:48] really started out um on on
[1:32:52] drugs and you know i started smoking a
[1:32:54] little pot
[1:32:56] and uh you know maybe
[1:32:59] social drink here and there
[1:33:01] and
[1:33:02] i could not see myself
[1:33:05] because i started out as a young age
[1:33:07] about 11 years old right
[1:33:10] and
[1:33:10] and it was just
[1:33:12] the influence of my surroundings
[1:33:16] and and brother i know what i'm talking
[1:33:18] about see when you grow up kind of grow
[1:33:20] up in the inner city i don't know how it
[1:33:22] is well the suburbs just as bad too
[1:33:25] right um um
[1:33:28] and and and you know i grew up going to
[1:33:31] church
[1:33:33] come on praise the lord hallelujah so
[1:33:35] that don't stop nothing because you take
[1:33:37] your children to church
[1:33:39] and you just gotta you gotta keep them
[1:33:40] under the blood keep praying for them
[1:33:43] right because my mama took us to church
[1:33:45] every sunday
[1:33:47] um
[1:33:48] but it started out so
[1:33:51] you know we smoke and giggle
[1:33:54] me and my homie
[1:33:55] i hope this all right
[1:33:58] right
[1:33:59] uh
[1:34:00] but i couldn't i couldn't see
[1:34:03] 14 15 years down the line
[1:34:06] my life in
[1:34:08] total
[1:34:09] disarray
[1:34:11] right all of my ambitions shot
[1:34:16] her
[1:34:17] i thought i'd be rich by now
[1:34:22] i'm 60 years old still working hard i
[1:34:25] i never even thought about working hard
[1:34:28] i thought about i'd be going to work in
[1:34:29] a suit or something
[1:34:32] huh
[1:34:33] but god had other plans but it was the
[1:34:36] result of the choices that i made not
[1:34:39] being able to stand alone
[1:34:43] huh you know why we got young people up
[1:34:45] in here
[1:34:46] they got to know this senator take you
[1:34:49] places listen prostitutes ain't growing
[1:34:52] up with the ambition well when i get get
[1:34:54] older i'ma praise the lord
[1:34:58] people don't skid row and and all that
[1:35:01] they did
[1:35:03] right
[1:35:04] but
[1:35:04] from from
[1:35:06] a innocent smoke
[1:35:09] something that that the devil presented
[1:35:12] as as innocent they did not have a seal
[1:35:17] right they weren't sealed in christ
[1:35:22] right
[1:35:23] just having columbine
[1:35:26] carnal perspectives just something that
[1:35:28] started out and appeared to be so
[1:35:31] innocent right
[1:35:33] right
[1:35:34] a little a couple of puffs and you come
[1:35:36] out from your little spot giggling and
[1:35:38] laughing with the munches y'all don't
[1:35:40] know about that
[1:35:43] you just want to go to the store get
[1:35:44] some candy some tater chips it's a soda
[1:35:47] waffle hungry boy
[1:35:50] huh i can recall many days coming out me
[1:35:53] and my homeboy we laughing
[1:35:57] the stupidest thing and you just why are
[1:36:00] you on the ground
[1:36:03] somebody know what around mine
[1:36:06] but but we couldn't we couldn't see
[1:36:09] the next stage to it
[1:36:13] right
[1:36:14] we this is this was the starting point
[1:36:19] right
[1:36:20] and then i found myself on on pills
[1:36:27] right
[1:36:28] the influence my homie brought some
[1:36:30] pills by the time we was the end of
[1:36:32] ninth grade i don't know why i'm going
[1:36:34] this way this wasn't in my nose but just
[1:36:35] somebody need to maybe hear this this
[1:36:38] morning
[1:36:39] and then by the time i was in
[1:36:42] 10th grade
[1:36:44] i was on power
[1:36:46] i'm sure i don't want to be too too
[1:36:48] direct
[1:36:50] right
[1:36:51] i never saw that for myself
[1:36:55] right
[1:36:55] right
[1:36:56] but
[1:36:57] from innocence
[1:37:00] right something that seemed
[1:37:02] you know this like this don't hurt
[1:37:04] nobody
[1:37:06] but i was starting to hurt myself
[1:37:10] right
[1:37:12] see because these things started
[1:37:14] affecting my ambitions
[1:37:19] right my ambitions and my goals now is
[1:37:22] starting to be affected and
[1:37:26] and and alter
[1:37:28] my character
[1:37:31] right
[1:37:32] my character as a as a uh uh individual
[1:37:36] my mindset
[1:37:39] yeah right right
[1:37:41] the the because it's demon inspired
[1:37:47] right desert there's a it's natural but
[1:37:50] there's an element of demonology that's
[1:37:53] associated with these things
[1:37:56] right
[1:37:57] amen
[1:37:59] listen because once this stuff gets you
[1:38:01] hooked
[1:38:03] you hooked
[1:38:05] you know i was i was thinking about i
[1:38:07] was thinking about the one of the
[1:38:09] message brother whispers was preaching
[1:38:11] um i think the message first message he
[1:38:13] preached here
[1:38:15] and uh i was just i was just thinking
[1:38:18] and i think he was talking about
[1:38:20] um um
[1:38:22] leasing in them
[1:38:23] right
[1:38:24] listen when you hooked
[1:38:26] right it takes a source
[1:38:29] it take it take a greater power
[1:38:32] to break the power
[1:38:34] of the thing that got you bound
[1:38:38] is that right it takes a it takes a
[1:38:41] greater power
[1:38:43] and thank and thank god for the promised
[1:38:45] word
[1:38:47] right thank god for what's been spoken
[1:38:51] right
[1:38:52] because god looks at his word and come
[1:38:54] to your rescue let me tell y'all
[1:38:57] something if it wasn't a word there we'd
[1:39:00] all be in trouble
[1:39:02] if we didn't have a promise we would not
[1:39:05] make it through this age
[1:39:07] of everything you said right
[1:39:10] this bad
[1:39:12] except for the word but god by his word
[1:39:18] right
[1:39:19] that motivates god his word
[1:39:24] that brings that brings god on the scene
[1:39:26] the thing that he said the thing that he
[1:39:29] promised
[1:39:31] right
[1:39:32] but
[1:39:33] things start out from an innocent i'll
[1:39:35] tell y'all young folks some you might
[1:39:37] say well these kids
[1:39:40] are you sure
[1:39:43] uh are you sure there's so many levels
[1:39:46] to this stuff
[1:39:48] right
[1:39:49] from from physical attractions
[1:39:54] huh
[1:39:56] the inspiration oh he cute
[1:39:59] oh she fine
[1:40:03] i'ma leave that alone y'all don't want
[1:40:04] me to preach that
[1:40:06] huh
[1:40:08] right
[1:40:10] i'm i'm you know
[1:40:12] just as a servant of god as a young man
[1:40:14] that has been somewhere and some seen
[1:40:17] something sometimes you know what let me
[1:40:20] tell you something i didn't have i
[1:40:21] didn't have

[1:40:24] i didn't have father figures
[1:40:27] that could relate these things to me
[1:40:31] right
[1:40:33] uh because maybe
[1:40:35] just just maybe
[1:40:38] um i i don't know but i could just i
[1:40:40] know hindsight is 20 20.
[1:40:42] but just maybe
[1:40:45] um
[1:40:46] some of the things that i did i might
[1:40:49] not have done them
[1:40:50] i don't i don't know the hindsight it's
[1:40:52] it's easy to say
[1:40:54] yeah i hate
[1:40:55] uh cause we hard head
[1:40:59] well maybe y'all just wasn't like
[1:41:03] bro me we we don't really listen we feel
[1:41:06] like we know
[1:41:07] you're five years old and i can't tell
[1:41:10] you that

[1:41:23] grade
[1:41:26] i wasn't even in middle school

[1:41:32] 25th grade in here

[1:41:43] like me
[1:41:44] sixth grade
[1:41:46] sixth grader
[1:41:48] okay any sixth graders
[1:41:50] okay we got one over there
[1:41:52] could you imagine me look at her
[1:41:55] innocent
[1:41:57] little dumpling over there
[1:42:01] do y'all realize what i was doing when i
[1:42:03] was her age
[1:42:07] that's brother solomon little baby girl
[1:42:10] over there
[1:42:11] but could you imagine see i was a big
[1:42:14] kid they used to call me the big little
[1:42:16] boy
[1:42:22] because i was bigger than him
[1:42:25] he was small compared to me
[1:42:28] when when i was his age
[1:42:31] i hung with
[1:42:32] the teenagers and adults
[1:42:36] so they just call me the big little boy
[1:42:39] right
[1:42:40] but the innocence but there was no seal
[1:42:43] there
[1:42:44] there was so much uncertainty there
[1:42:49] at every turn pursuing me
[1:42:53] right
[1:42:54] venturing out with no authority
[1:42:57] you what you say you want people to move
[1:43:00] with authority
[1:43:02] with a certainty
[1:43:05] is that right
[1:43:07] come on
[1:43:08] as christians we have got to live with
[1:43:11] an uncertainty i got 10 minutes and i'm
[1:43:14] going home
[1:43:15] with an uncertainty
[1:43:18] right
[1:43:19] and so for brother madam say you're
[1:43:21] going to be a part of something that's
[1:43:23] positive praise god
[1:43:27] you know and and the day that i listened
[1:43:30] to that i was kind of i was kind of down
[1:43:32] in my spirit
[1:43:36] i ain't not listen church i ain't always
[1:43:38] on the mountaintop
[1:43:40] right
[1:43:41] i know
[1:43:42] every time you see me you ain't gonna
[1:43:44] get no praise the lord hallelujah thank
[1:43:46] you either that
[1:43:48] you know i ain't that type of person
[1:43:52] you know you get some people you run
[1:43:54] into
[1:43:55] right they just be pretending he's like
[1:43:58] buddy you ain't
[1:44:01] you always
[1:44:05] y'all know what i'm talking about
[1:44:07] that's un to me that's unrealistic maybe
[1:44:10] maybe some people like that
[1:44:13] maybe some people like that i want to do
[1:44:18] and
[1:44:19] most of the time you know people say
[1:44:21] well you got the right name smiley but i
[1:44:24] don't always feel like smiling
[1:44:30] huh sometimes i just
[1:44:34] i want to be i want to be frowny
[1:44:38] i want to be just let me be today
[1:44:42] tomorrow uh give me an hour
[1:44:46] the next hour i might be greater than
[1:44:48] laughing with you
[1:44:50] you know
[1:44:51] that's just that's just being realistic
[1:44:55] come on church
[1:44:56] not unless some of y'all might have it
[1:44:58] down pat like that when y'all always
[1:45:00] grinning and laughing pray the lord
[1:45:02] hallelujah god is good and this and that
[1:45:04] and i know brother westco used to be
[1:45:06] like that but i i do know realistically
[1:45:10] i passed it that's i hate to say it like
[1:45:13] this but sometimes that stuff being
[1:45:15] facade
[1:45:17] because if you're dealing with people
[1:45:19] every day sometimes people can bring you
[1:45:22] on a low
[1:45:24] huh
[1:45:26] amen i i doubt very seriously
[1:45:29] you know brother jack is always on a
[1:45:31] high
[1:45:34] yeah he might be at high when he step up
[1:45:35] behind the pulpit
[1:45:38] but but but we
[1:45:40] when you got so much going on
[1:45:43] you ain't always on no high
[1:45:47] come on brother brother was not always
[1:45:49] on no high
[1:45:50] he wasn't he wasn't
[1:45:53] but but let me go i'm give me 10 minutes
[1:45:55] i'm i'mma quit cause
[1:46:00] i don't wanna preach out two hours
[1:46:02] my brother adam started on the sermon he
[1:46:04] said i don't wanna weigh y'all patience
[1:46:08] right
[1:46:09] but he says um
[1:46:11] uh uh there is nothing nowhere can
[1:46:13] separate you from it that's powerful
[1:46:17] to know listen
[1:46:20] i cannot be separated from god
[1:46:23] once there's a connection
[1:46:27] once there's a seal i can't
[1:46:31] nothing
[1:46:32] see
[1:46:33] it
[1:46:34] eternally secured
[1:46:38] right in that word secured is fixed
[1:46:42] or attach something firmly so that it
[1:46:46] cannot be moved
[1:46:49] or lost
[1:46:52] that's powerful
[1:46:55] and see i'm not basing that upon how i
[1:46:57] feel because i don't always feel
[1:47:00] i'm basing that upon what he's saying
[1:47:04] right
[1:47:05] that's it
[1:47:07] i'm basically i'm eternally secure in
[1:47:10] the kingdom of god got nothing to do
[1:47:13] with how i feel
[1:47:15] right now i'm anointed when i leave here
[1:47:17] in the next two hours i don't know how i
[1:47:19] know how i feel and feel sleepy
[1:47:24] right
[1:47:25] but no matter what i gotta face tomorrow
[1:47:29] this is the thing these statements are
[1:47:31] the things that carry me
[1:47:35] right
[1:47:36] that carry me
[1:47:39] right when when when i'm looking for god
[1:47:42] to uh manifest his promise
[1:47:46] these things is what carried me
[1:47:50] these this is the these promises and
[1:47:53] these quotes is the things that that you
[1:47:56] know
[1:47:57] when i feel like falling down and when i
[1:48:00] feel like giving up
[1:48:01] these things pick me up
[1:48:04] these things carry me
[1:48:08] glory to god
[1:48:10] amen he said when god has stepped the
[1:48:12] seal upon you
[1:48:14] you're it's you're to the end of your
[1:48:16] destination right
[1:48:19] uh let me see if i can go a little
[1:48:21] further
[1:48:23] he said when the government puts a seal
[1:48:25] upon a package
[1:48:27] the railroad
[1:48:30] puts a seal on a door
[1:48:32] that car cannot be tampered with
[1:48:36] until it reaches its destination
[1:48:41] see church this ain't from revival to

[2:02:04] huh
[2:02:08] whoa
[2:02:10] church i'ma tell y'all something
[2:02:13] y'all don't believe me probably there's
[2:02:15] a lot that still needs to be taught
[2:02:19] it's just the truth it's it's a lot that
[2:02:21] needs to be taught
[2:02:23] um because as men we we rough and we had
[2:02:27] these little
[2:02:28] tendencies and
[2:02:30] our
[2:02:31] thoughts and you know we don't want to
[2:02:33] show our tender side and
[2:02:35] you know
[2:02:37] there ain't nothing wrong with with
[2:02:39] being with being you know a little mushy
[2:02:44] showing that i ain't no punk you ain't
[2:02:47] gotta be no problem see you you say well
[2:02:50] why you say that because this is the way
[2:02:52] we grew up my generation
[2:02:54] my generation grew up this way
[2:02:57] right
[2:02:58] all of the information that we got from
[2:03:01] our daddies and cousins and uncles and
[2:03:06] right and sometimes it wasn't even
[2:03:08] things that they said it was their
[2:03:10] actions
[2:03:11] and so we thought that was right and
[2:03:13] then we grow up and you get in god you
[2:03:15] realize boy you were wrong with two left
[2:03:17] shoes
[2:03:18] and y'all know two left shoes is wrong
[2:03:22] try to put them on your feet it don't
[2:03:23] even work
[2:03:26] huh
[2:03:27] so so we we gotta reevaluate
[2:03:30] a lot of stuff man
[2:03:33] even even even me you know i'm still
[2:03:36] growing like i say i'm still
[2:03:38] evaluating still
[2:03:40] trying to understand myself and who i am
[2:03:43] and
[2:03:44] and and all of that and uh
[2:03:46] i'm not ashamed of that don't i say this
[2:03:49] don't look at me like i'm perfect i'm
[2:03:51] the first to tell you i'm not
[2:03:53] i'm scarred and flawed
[2:03:57] right
[2:03:58] i've been through a whole lot of stuff
[2:04:01] but uh but you know what
[2:04:03] i'm i'm still a part of resurrection
[2:04:10] amen
[2:04:12] amen i i just i just pray that let us
[2:04:16] stand something was said that that
[2:04:18] helped us

[2:04:29] us
