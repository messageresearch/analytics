and they went three days in the wilderness and found the water amen let's pray father we thank you for your word we thank you for uh the wonderful wonderful worship service that we've had thus far and

use amen this is jessica back there all right god bless you sister jessica good to see you amen praise the lord uh just want to use a man um a title today be certain of god amen be certain of god hallelujah hallelujah amen the bible says in first peter chapter 4 verse 12 amen um the bible states beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you and i love the way peter writes this because if you're not going through anything right now i'm here to tell you get ready because there's a trial coming your way and when the trial comes your way you have been thoroughly warned so therefore you don't have to think it's strange and you don't have to sit there and wonder why me why am i going through this amen because i can tell you already the reason you're going through is because god already know you're going to overcome it amen i i i just feel like getting this out right now right right off the right at the gate i just want to tell the devil quitting is not an option quitting is not an option giving up is not an option that i mean you can just you can just stop throwing thoughts like that out towards me because quitting is not an option i i plan to go all the way with this thing come what will come with me i'm going all the way praise god but the bible says beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you amen but this is the rather than thinking of strange here's the other part to the scripture but rejoice amen in as much as ye are partakers of christ's suffering that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding joy amen so trials are part of the christian amen experience and and we we have to understand that and i'm sorry i i i don't want to forget this i don't know did we announce about sister capers that lost her brother oh can we pray for her okay thank you all right i missed that we want to keep her in prayer keep her and brother keepers and prayers they travel there to alabama to be with the family man let's keep them in prayer all right i want to read from here time tested memorials of god um there's a little couple statements here uh that the prophet says and i just want to uh bring this it says if he went to that much trouble to be sure that the bridge would be safe and he's talking about this gentleman that built a bridge over in australia nobody want to take on this task of building this bridge they thought and there were just so many critics around telling that man when you get this bridge established it's probably going to fall apart as soon as the first car goes across it but this man just did everything he could to to make sure that that bridge was going to hold and uh and i had a chance to go and and see that bridge and go across that bridge and it's still holding today right and so he's talking about this man and time tested memorial how he tested the the underneath the ward and tested all kind of things and make sure that the bridge would stand it says if he went to that much trouble to be sure that the bridge would be safe how much trouble do you think god went to to be sure this church would be safe amen yes sir there's a memorial to the death of christ that's his church some people don't want to live it some people will but it's a testing time look at this god's testing people today for his memorials amen and a lot a lot of times people say oh i'm so tempted look at this blessed be the name of the lord for the temptations now that'll give the devil a mind battle when you can start praising god even for your temptations blessed be the name of the lord for the temptations amen he goes on and uh and says this when i am weak then i'm strong said paul every sun that cometh to god must first be tried and tested and these testings are more sweeter to you and dearer to you than precious gold is testing time hallelujah amen a little further it says long years ago before they had the smelters they used to take the gold and how they would know how it was right or not with all the sludge was uh with all the sludge was out of it and all of the iron pyrite that's fools go all the foods out of it beaters beat it beat it and turned it and beat it and turned it until the beater sees his reflection in the goal amen that's the way god does his church glory he gives you trial after trial glory test after test trial after trial test after test amen somebody should say thank god for the tests thank god for the trial right amen test after test trial after trial and the reason he's doing this is because he wants to see the life of christ reflected in your life amen until you become peaceful come on somebody sober amen the trial is there to make you meek gentle hallelujah humble amen the trial makes you ready submissive willing to turn your heads from the things of the world amen thank god for the trial amen and looking right looking straight to calvary to the one who's doing the beating many times you think you're strange you think you think it's strange because fiery trials and sickness and persecution is only done to test you amen to get the dirt out of you to get the sludge out of you to get the slowness out of you amen to wake you up to the place where you can look and see the reflection a man can see the reflection of christ in you christ in you the hope of glory let me go a little further in this he says he tested every piece finally before he put a bolt on he tested he tested everything then when he got it all done now the scoffer stood by and said it will not hold up it can't do it he's talking about this man on the bridge again he says that's what they're saying today this here holy ghost religion you're talking about it won't be long that tree will burn down but it don't burn down the fire only waters it it only gives us new hole it only strengthens it every trial testing every time a wind hits a tree and shoves it back and forth and back and forth it only loosens the roots for one purpose so it can go deeper and get a better hole every time sickness strikes your home every time trials strike your home every time the neighbors say something bad about you it's only shaking you loosing you up so you can get down and get get a better hold on the eternal rock of god unmovable word that's how god does it he sends those trials to test you to prove you to shake you up and to give you a new hole you know it's the midst of our trials they have a saying no no no test no testimony right so the trial actually only strengthens your testimony so we got to thank god for we learn we learn to give god praise in the midst of wherever we are you know i was i was just thinking on this little um this this little preacher one time that went to a city and he wanted to have a revival he said the lord told him to come and have a revival and he was there uh just kind of getting things prepared you know for the meeting and working on the building and washing the windows and all kind of stuff and all of a sudden there's a little fella walked up to him and it says now you know you you what you're coming here for you say i'm coming to have revival it says now you you didn't pretty much you didn't get my permission to have no revival here he says well you know the lord told me to come and say well anybody that uh anybody want to have a revival here i'm gonna just be honest with you gonna have to you gotta whoop me first and he told the priest you gotta whip me first now if you're gonna have a revival i said my put a challenge out there to preach so the preacher put his put his hammer down put his nails down took his apron off went across the street knocked that fella down jumped on top of him hit him hit him a few more licks picked him up and said you finished he said you can have the revival and see here's the thing i want to tell you sometimes you got to whip your enemy before you can have a breakthrough glory to god sometimes you got to beat down that devil that's trying to beat you down you've been on the defense long enough praise god it's time for you to go on the offense glory to god amen and you'll realize there's more in you than this in him he just got a big mouth amen he all talked in no action praise god i love this yeah i'm going to just give you a little a little statement here brother branham says our objective is to win amen and he says i can't lose i'm gonna win i want to tell you that no matter what you're going through this morning you cannot lose you're going to win oh hallelujah all right look at this out of this this day the scripture's fulfilled i'm sorry you know what let me go back uh greatest greatest battle ever fought and uh i think i had a paragraph 233 but i'ma start at 239 on that let me just read this it says uh there you are see it takes the word of god and cut your way through every doubt take take the word of god cut your way through every doubt see see it sure that's it that's the next job let's get it done right next thing i'm i'm to do is get away from my doubts cut it down amen that's my next job is get all my frustrations away if my senses tell me when you feel bad the next thing to do is cut that thing away that's right uh it says you say well they tell me you know my conscience tell me brother branham uh well you might you might as well cut that thing away you ain't gonna get no further than that just get your next job done take off your coat and bear right into it just keep on going one objective i'm going to win amen i can't lose i'm going to win amen i'm on the winning side i'm gonna didn't see i wouldn't have to go through anything but i'm on the winning side all right here let me get this out of this state of the scriptures for phil before we just kind of slip back into a couple of things here my god i i i i i love this i love this here this day the scripture is fulfilled the prophet says this israel at the river when they possess the land went over how they going to do it is the month of april the floods are coming down before the snow is melting up in judea oh what a poor general it seemed like that god was to bring his people there in the month of april when the jordan was higher back than it ever was now i want you to get this you know before we finish this quote uh god brought the children of israel into the promised land but the month that he brings them into the promised land is a time where the banks are overflowing with water i want to i'm going to bring this to to to our to where we live in that in a second but but god his strategy is is not when it's a drought not to bring them over a man when it's very easy to cross but no he wants it to be difficult and now the waters are overflowing because of amen because of the rain and everything this is a time where everything is very the water is very high now i want to bring a little closer god amen we will have you to buy a house glory to god when the market is high come on somebody i'm talking about the god we serve because the way we think it's like we want to wait until things are low hallelujah but god say when it's high let me let me let me let me get you to understand something the same god that provides you five dollars it's the same god that provides you five hundred thousand dollars look you don't pray to a different god to get five hundred thousand amen you pray to the same god and he he will meet any need that you have all he wants us to do is start praising him in advance amen the earth is the lord's the fullness thereof the world and they that dwell our god is a big god and he does big things hallelujah so understand this is how god just like god does things he waits till the most difficult time because that's when he gonna get the most glory he waits to the doctor say stage four when when you hear that everybody oh stage four you gotta remember it's your attitude towards that which brings a man which was gonna allow uh or that thing to change and go in one direction i read the quote on wednesday night how people when they hear that from the doctor they just oh i might as well get my thing get things ready i'm leaving here soon stage four this this is over and when they start acting like that before they know it it's over but another person say the doctor look at them and say well you know it's life and if i gotta die dying is a part of living and i can't lose when i die i'm going to win anyway when they have that type of attitude the doctor says he say that person just lingers home praise god amen you ain't going nowhere to god say you going but there's some things we might have to go through before we get there praise god amen he says this in the rest of this quote he says i might could stop here if i had time to give give us just a little tip sometimes you may be setting out there with cancer or you might be setting with the disease you think why me being a christian would be in this away why would i be sitting like this if i'm a christian it says sometimes god lets things get so dark that you can't see up you can't see around you you can't anywhere else and then he comes and makes a way through it it gets so dark you can't see your way out of this thing and then god comes and makes a way through it that's what we're looking for a man says any excess and then he comes and makes a way through it for you that you might say this day this scripture is being fulfilled that he promised to do there's going to be a performance of those things that he promised you don't give up on it i want us to just look at this scripture that i read here amen this morning exodus 15 i read verse 22 but i want to just slip back to uh verse 20. i want us to understand what has just happened um you know i could i could i could go back uh even before these verses just to kind of tell you this is the time where the children of israel had experienced one of the greatest victories that they ever had in their life this was a time where you know they had been in bondage for over 400 years god finally sends a prophet amen moses comes in and he begins to uh a call for the various plagues that was striking egypt and finally the last plague that come was the plague of death and death to the firstborn son and when when pharaoh experienced that he says get get your stuff get your people y'all get out of egypt get out right now you know and pharaoh finally he decides to let him go and and man they rejoice him they rejoice in that that pharaoh has allowed them to leave egypt and and my you can imagine just the maybe the victory dances amen and a shop and when and the other thing about when they left they didn't leave paul praise god amen they borrowed the riches amen from the egyptians come on somebody and as they took the i mean even egyptians like you know we're not even concerned with our stuff y'all can even have the stuff that y'all took you ain't got to even bring that back good god almighty but here they leave with the riches of of egypt and they're all just rejoicing but before you know it something happened in pharaoh's mind and the people that were referrals like we don't let all the slaves go we can't do that who gonna do the work now say no we need to go get our slaves and bring them back so here they go from a tremendous victory to a tremendous trial because now pharaoh and his army are on their trail and and they're looking at most like what are we gonna do now these these people are upset moses and we're faced with the red sea what are we gonna do now moses oh moses told them is these these inspirational words the egyptians you sing today you shall see them no more forever now when moses spoke that god never told moses to say that and there are some things that you speak out of your mouth that god never told you to say but because moses was a son of god and because you are a son of god and you are a daughter of god god had to back up what moses said and if god backed up what moses said i'm here to encourage you this morning god will back up what you have said you don't have to go back on your word god come back up what you release out of your mouth whether you can see it whether you can feel it it don't have nothing to do with it heaven will back up what you saying glory to god they are in the in the midst of this great trial pharaoh's army got him surrounded they they they they got the red sea in front of him and pharaoh's army behind them and what god does is is uh is coming and put a pill of fire in between the army amen and and uh you know and and and israel and so god put the pill of fire and that it i mean the egyptians cannot get to him because this pillar fire got him blocked off they should have turned around right then wait a minute i mean they should have known we fighting something this is greater than what any other war we don't been in this there's something different here let's get back let's get out of here but no they they was too proudful they're going to press through that that's the way the devil he's going to press through everything to try to get to you but god got a surprise for him moses moses god told him to stretch out that rod and stretch out the rod and the water parted he said now let the israel children israel go go across onto our land and here they come walking across on dry land my god and and by the time they get through pharaoh realizes well the the fire done lifted we can chase them again and here they come running into the red sea thinking that god was making a way for him he really was making a way for them amen to to fulfill the word that moses spoke because the word was the egyptians you've seen today you shall see no more forever so if god got to open up a red sea and drown all your enemies to make your word come to pass not his word but to make your work god was making moses word come to pass when he drowned those those the enemy in the red sea that wasn't god's word that was moses work hey god will bankrupt the heavens before one word of his falls to the ground and return void you've been inspired to speak and stay with it and i want to encourage you be certain of god be sure of god glory to god hallelujah he won't fail he's never failed they to sing that song he never failed me yet he never failed me yet jesus christ never failed me yet and everywhere i go i want the world to know jesus christ jesus christ has never failed me yet he healed me before he'll heal me again he provided before he provided him he made a way before he'll make a way again he never fails i'm certain of god i'm convinced of god [Music] glory hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] [Music] pharaoh's army is drowned in the red sea and what a victory here's another victory after a great trial after the trial of 400 years of being in bondage god delivered them that was a victory well now when they when they're on the way into the promised land uh here pharaoh's army is drowning the rest see another victory and let me tell you something i i'm through your trials i want to this is going to be my other title you are moving from victory to victory [Applause] you're not moving from victory to defeat you're moving from victory to victory now we pick up the scripture and miriam the prophetess the sister of aaron took a timber in her hand and i like this all the women i like this because see you know we need to get this way sometime we come to church and some of us just stare at everybody else somebody get the praising god you're just staring at him after god did all this hey i'm gonna tell y'all if you ain't got a shout you better go practice one you ain't got to run you better go practice one you ain't got to jump you better go practice one because when we get to where god's getting ready to take us to you can't be sitting there looking at the rest of us somebody grab a tambourine and begin that jericho marks glory to god you better be right behind them put the baby on your back brother like they do in africa they put the baby on the front they wrap that baby up and that baby get into the jericho mark head just bobbling all over the place praise god [Applause] [Music] [Applause] mirroring the prophetess the sister of aaron took a timber in her hand and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dance dances glory to god i feel good i mean dances i i see i mean because you know we we we y'all know how we do it we got we got multiple moves for the devil what's that song uh no one no one like jesus that's one dance oh that's another dance that's our war dance we just we just oh praise god we got a whole bunch of dances and all of them are victory dances all right let me all the women went out after her with timbers and with dances and miriam answered them singing to the lord for he hath triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath thee thrown into the sea how they just got through praising god worshiping the lord look at this so moses brought israel from the red sea and they went out into the wilderness of shore and they went three days in the wilderness and found no water wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute from this great mighty mighty uh move of god now they led into a place called the wilderness of sure after god is made aware after god has done this and after god did that and after that now now you'll find yours in the next verse you're in the next verse now and you're in what we call the wilderness of sure and they found the water three days didn't find any water now let's look at this oftentimes we're led by god to the wilderness of sure and and what this word sure means i might be i might actually be pronouncing it wrong and and and if i am forgive me but to me it does make sense in the english language to pronounce it as sure sure we're getting close but but sure means wall there's this place called sure it's actually a wall that's what it means come on somebody you you go from worshiping and praising god and seeing him make a way and doing all this and then you run into a wall it was a landmark between the delta and the deserts it was a barrier of some kind across the great north northeastern highways out of egypt now i like this point it's a barrier when you're coming out of egypt when you're trying to get delivered from something when you're trying to get free from something this place called sure becomes a barrier to try to block you from getting a cross but when you get to the wilderness of sure my encouragement to you this morning be certain of god when when saints get to this place called shu or this wilderness of sure uh you know this is where this is where people become unsure when they're standing that sure they become unsure and they begin to say things like this i know god can do it but will he do it for me see you unsure right i know god is a healer and i believe and rejoice over the testimonies i heard but really heal me i know god made a way before but really make a way this time for me you are unsure say don't be unsure be be certain of god amen look at this out of the sermon be certain of god watch this quote brother branham brings us he says you know when we have confessed our sins and met every requirement that god requires we believe on god there's a circumstance uh he says there's a there's a there there's circumstances has to be met and he says and it's and it's according to his uh to his will and we've confessed our sins we made all the wrongs that we that we have did right done everything that we know know how to do every requirement that god has made or asked we have met that requirement and yet he lays silent he just won't answer us sometimes i feel that way right he says i'm sure that i'm speaking to people this morning who's come to that place i've been there many times myself it's not a one-time occasion this happens over and over in your life many times myself when i went back and traced my life and turned over every stone and i found that that i did something wrong i'd go confess it and say lord god i'll make it right and go do so then come back again and say now lord thou art god you'll answer me surely i've met every request that you required me to do and every requirement i've met it and still he won't move seems to be set seems to set silent that's when you've got to be sure that he is god don't be discouraged i want you to i want you to do me a favor do me a favor they said in church i'll tell your neighbor tell your neighbor tell your neighbor say neighbor don't be discouraged neighbor don't be discouraged i don't know what you're going through neighbor but don't be discouraged don't be discouraged the only thing is that in your heart to be certain of god my text be certain first before you do anything be certain in your heart that is god and when you've met everything that he said then you're sure that he's god that's when faith goes to work right there faith stands steady all right for it knows that he is and you met every requirement you believe that is and faith holds steady oh blessed be his name faith won't move glory to god for is sure that god is and a reward of those that diligently seek him and look at what he says may this go down may this go way down deep and never move from you branham tabernacle i say spirit and truth tabernacle if you've met god's requirements and in your heart you believe that he is god is only testing your faith for he loves to do that you confess your sin and you've met every requirement that god requires and still he lays silent remember faith says that he is i like that not he was not he will be faint says that he is he is a waymaker promise keeper light in the darkness my god that is who you are even when i can't see it you're working even when i can't feel it you're working i found out you never stop you never stop working glory [Applause] he never stops working on your behalf even right now a church is prepared for us god is working on somebody right now that house is prepared that job is prepared praise god your healing's prepared that car is prepared whatever you need god's got it he never stops working even when he's silent he's working [Music] faith faith says that faith holds steady my faith holds on to it not knowing what it's all about but it knows he is and it's certain that he is then remember if he is his word has to be true and if he requires you to meet these circumstances and you did look at this he's obligated to take care of his work i just love things like i remember when i was going through that man i lost my i lost my job couldn't work got behind on my my mortgage all kind of stuff i don't know how we gonna do this well we'll just pack up and go we'll find somewhere we'll find somewhere police come knocking on the door early in the morning and serving me papers and i'm like why the police at my house i ain't done nothing wrong i'm here to serve paper sir oh lord here go to papers i got him all i can do is pray i ain't nothing i can do with praying just leave it in the hands of god and after i prayed left in the hands of god next thing i got a call says sir we'd like to work things out with you we like to do this and we like to do that and did it in such a way they dropped my payment to something i could pay uh i mean knocked off a whole bunch and and say okay now we'll put you just can you do this i said yeah i can do it i can do it and as they work things out with me lord had my salary in such a way i could just take care of all my own so i look god god already got this thing worked out and god's mind is already sorted out he he know exactly y'all here we are over here god already up there and he's waiting on us to come but as we go this way we got to walk by faith can't see it i can't feel it but i'm still walking by faith i tell you another thing that's gonna happen in my walk by faith i'ma still be in church on sunday somebody might have come this morning somebody might have come this morning to church on fumes but you made it i'm i got crazy faith i'm talking about faith that you can i mean i don't heard people do all kind of crazy things and and god don't move them to have something laid hands on their car and god fill it up with gas some put water in the car now you say don't do that but somebody did it and it turned to gas if jesus can turn water into wine now i'm not telling you go put water in your car but if your faith say that i'm gonna stand in your way [Applause] glory to god amen sometimes you gotta give the devil a black eye yeah i might not have this and i might not have that but i got my faith and i'ma still operate with that i'm certain of god his word has to be true and if you if he required you to meet these circumstances then you did he's obligated to take care of his own word don't back off and say oh i'll never get healed oh you poor weak weak faith don't believe that if everything's confessed and everything's out and you met god's requirement faith holds right there there's nothing will move it he is and you're sure they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount with wings of an eagle they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint wait when you've met his requirements that brings your faith to a showdown if you have met god's requirements has been made met and you have and you have fully considered it and you have done everything that god required you to do then your faith rests right there that he is be certain of god to this place that the children of israel have come to after a man of the defeat a pharaoh in his army in the red sea this wilderness of sure well this is not the first time somebody in the bible has come to sure we have some other instances that i want to show you in scripture amen one of them we're going to find in genesis 16. glory to god verse 6 through 10. this is amen a time when abram and sarah or sarai they have received a promise from god amen that sarai was going to have a child but sarai began to doubt the promise she became unsure glory to god and when she doubted the promise she she suggested to abraham it was surrounded suggested why don't you take uh my handmaid here hagar and maybe bear a child through her and that suggestion turned out to be a really really bad decision but look at this in in genesis 16 6 but abraham said unto sarai behold thy hand that i made is in my hand due to her as it pleadeth thee and when sir i dealt hardly with her she fled from her face now this is that that sarai was the one suggested that this lady take her place and now she's upset with her and said then and the angel of the lord founded by a fountain of water in the wilderness by the fountain in the way to sure look at this now the angel lord found a hagar amen the handmaid found her at founder at the fountain in the way to sure and when and he said hey god sir is made with king of style and wither will thou go and she said i flee from the face of my mistress sarai and the angel lord said to her return to thy mistress and submit thyself under her hands now this is a a tremendous trial i mean this lady just just gave me what for and she made it made it very clear that i'm not welcome in her house and you want me to go back to our house some of y'all need to go back into some situations and get it straightened out maybe humble yourself and submit yourself to some things you're me god and the wilderness of sure go make things right before you see god make things right but here the angel lord told her to go back and submit herself uh under her hands and the angel is telling her i will multiply thy seed exceedingly that it shall not be numbered for the multitude now i want you to catch this hagar was found by the angel lord at sure and she would be blessed not only would she be blessed but her seed would be blessed if she went back and submitted herself to sarai after she got an uh a direct word from god at sure genesis 20. verse 1 says this and abraham journeyed from thence towards the south country and dwelt between kadesh and sure and sojourn and gerrard now now what we're getting here as we as we go into this abraham uh the promise for him sarah was going to have a son sarah's going to have a son oh my god god told him that sarah's going to have now they've been waiting for a number of years for sarah to have this son glory to god now i believe there was a famine of something that struck the land and abraham decided you know i got to get up and i got to leave but god could not bless abraham outside of being there in the land where he told him to be god can't bless israel outside of where he told him to be he's not going to deal with israel until they get back to where they're supposed to be you know even in this war with ukraine russia is driving some of israel right back into there you realize god gonna deal with 144 000 jews some of them could have been sitting in ukraine and sometimes it take war to get people back to where they need to be sometimes it takes trials it takes distress to get people in the place where god wants them to be amen amen look at it abraham journey from this towards the south country and dwell between kardesh and sure sojourned in gerar and abraham said of sarah's wife she is my sister and abimelech king of garage sent and took sarah but god came to bimelec in a dream by night and said to him behold thou art thou art but a dead man for the woman which style has taken for she is a man's wife but abimelech had not come near her and he said lord without slay also a righteous nation said he not unto me she is my sister and she even uh even she accepts that he is my brother and the integrity of my heart and energy of my hands have i done this both abraham and sarah live now this is a little different from uh uh anonymous sapphire they lot and then live to lie again but abraham and sarah lot come on somebody both of them lied but god still delivered them and the reason that god delivered them there was a promise over their life there was a promise that god has spoke sarah thy wife shall have a son i don't care what you feel abraham i don't care what you think and all this jerry your wife gonna have a son not your sister i ain't calling your sister i said sarah your wife amen and yes she is your sister's half sister yes she is but look at this look at this verse six and god said unto him in a dream yeah i know that thou didst this and the integrity of the heart for i also withheld thee from sinning against me therefore suffered i thee not to touch her now i want you to understand the reason that god won't allow this man to touch sarah is because god had a promise wrapped around sarah and there was nothing that could come i don't care how old she got there was nothing that could stop god's word from being fulfilled in sarah's life and in abraham's life and look at this this i just love this because even even when we when we are doubting our unbelief and maybe god should just kick us to the side but he don't he's still got good things to say about you child you still my child my son my daughter i don't care what you still my child look at what happened here in verse seven now therefore restore the man his wife for he is a prophet look at that not liar prophet for he is a prophet and he shall pray for thee and thou shalt live and if thou restore not know thou that thou shalt surely die thou and all that are that it was here at sure this wilderness assure where abraham was unsure about what god promised him and he did something wrong let's catch one more in scripture somebody gets to sure and gets unsure first samuel 15 verse 7 and saul smote the malachites from havilah unto thou comest to sure that is over against egypt and it took agag the king of the malachites alive and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword but saul and the people spared a gag and the best of the sheep and of the oxen and other fatlings and the lambs and all that was good and would not utterly destroy them but everything that was vile and re refused that they destroyed utterly now that was not what god told them do god told them destroy everything but they saved some of the things and they thought that they would try to bring that and offer that to god and when when when the prophet uh uh samuel came down and said what is this out here you supposed to destroy everything what did you do saul he said he said no no no i did this i did that i did this let's skip down to verse 20. but you didn't do what god told you to do and this is what happened in verse 20. this happened at sure saul said and samuel have obeyed the verse of the lord and have gone the way which the lord sent me and have brought a king ag the king of amalek and have utterly destroyed their malachites god actually told him to destroy a gag too he failed to do exactly what god told him to do and later on if you read scripture you'll find out that it was one of these um amalekites that actually slayed saul so you better kill your enemy before your enemy kills you look at this verse 21 but the people took out a spoiled sheep and oxen and the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed to sacrifice them to the lord thy god and give god he thought he had to dress that thing up real good they took the best so they can sacrifice unto god but then what god asked for god said destroy everything look at this amen he said and then he had to be rebuked by the prophet thinking he was doing something good oh my he says this in verse 22 samuel said hath the lord as great delight and burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice to hearken than the fat of rams for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry because thou has rejected the word of the lord he have also rejected thee from being king this happened at sure see you don't want to be unsure of a god that's already done so many great things amen it's not only if he did it before he can do it again no if he did it for he will do it again it's time for us to be certain of god we find this great trial here in exodus 15 israel celebrating the victory over pharaoh and his army but verse 22 when we read it in exodus 15 shows that they moved from a great victory to a great trial says so moses brought israel from the red sea and they went out into the wilderness of shur and they went three days in the wilderness and found no water praise god i want to drop this little uh quote off with y'all to speak to the rock and it shall give forth this water hallelujah church we find ourselves in the same position god does this god does that god did this and you know i i know that we're coming out of this 40-day uh uh um prophecy and and i did want to say this i i think some kind of way we need to be able to hear some of the testimonies that god has done in this 40 days and i'm trying i'm thinking that we might have to set up a special service just just for that amen to be able to kind of come and just let people share what the lord did for them in this 40 days i don't want to just to go and just pass and be going i want us to let's let's exalt the lord let's tell of his goodness i want y'all to be thinking of it and there are some things that i mean i've been hearing different people i had this on my prayer list i had that god did this god oh my goodness look at god some of y'all wrote some things down and god been answering everything that you wrote down on your list god been an answer we need to hear we need to hear hey man tell tell if it's one of one wonderous deeds we're getting ready to come out of this but here's the other thing i want to say just as israel was coming out of this great manifestation they faced the wilderness of sure and if that is our amen if that's part of our story i won't encourage us before we get there be certain of god hearing the sermon speak to the rock and it shall give forth this water the prophet says this they had seen ten powerful miracles performed down in egypt flies lice fire death angel all that seen in egypt all these great miracles they had seen god do and we're still carnal thinkers anybody anybody can identify with the children of israel i'd have seen god do this i hadn't seen god do that and then my mind carnal thinking god delivered me from carnal thinking to set me free from from thinking like that god i i i mean if i just only want i want to only believe it says this colonel thinkers and then they saw the red sea that was laying in the path of duty they were on their road marching then come out there was a pill of fire before them and they marched on to the red sea and when they got there right in the line of duty laid an obstacle first thing you know fear struck them and they did not know what to do that's the way people does today when fear strikes them when they're right in the path of duty you're doing exactly what god wants you to do see this this is this this is the thing uh when trial strikes we gotta we gotta be certain job was certain of god and job also was certain that he had no sin in his life no matter what his his his accusers might have said you did this joe come on if you didn't if you hadn't done these things you would have been blessed but look at what's going on in your life joe you you you need to confess joe i you don't did something you don't you're a secret sinner you did you need to tell go go confess to your wife joe go confess this to you so i ain't got nothing to say joe kept up saying look i'm not inferior to you i mean he's just trying to hold this position hold his telephone say i don't understand why i'm going through this i can't figure it all out but i know i'm not a sinner amen you got to be able to stand when you're in the path of duty you know you've done everything that god asked you to do be certain of god watch this listen brother let me say this if you're walking in the light having fellowship with god with his people and the holy spirit is upon you and you meet an obstacle right in the path of duty look at what he's saying don't stop i told you earlier quitting is not even an option turning back is not even an option ain't no system even bringing them type of ideas i ain't even considering none of that now you know you know you're gonna need that gas to go to work tomorrow you you're gonna try to go to church today you need that gas for tomorrow yeah i'm going to church today and i'm going to need gas tomorrow and you know if my the god i serve he take care of the sparrow and every morning the sparrow wake up he just go to the ground and start digging and he finds himself a worm and god provides his needs for that day you know what that sparrow don't that's the sparrow does not go around and try to put a few worms away for tomorrow and put something for next week that's family word he'll he'll think that way the spirits say if i wake up i'm going right back out to the ground again and god gonna have another word for me and when i do i'm gonna do the same thing tomorrow amen every week every day i wake up god can provide my need if i need gas tomorrow dog gonna have gas in the car hey if if i just gotta get by on a quarter tank i'll get a quarter of a tank until i can get a full tank come on somebody you gotta be certain of gods you mean an obstacle right in the path of duty don't stop just keep pressing on look at this god will make a way through it that's one of the greatest experiences of my life is to see god when i can't get over it get under it get around it or anyway god opens up a way and i go through it somehow another his grace is sufficient to carry us through it i thought about you know brother branham when he had that big old tax case and he couldn't figure out how to get get through this tax case he just thought he was doing all the right things with the money that was given to him and uh and and they're just coming after him and you know even while he's there fighting with this the the you know the tax guys and everything like you know i uh uh they told me oh so many thousands of dollars in taxes on the money and and and as he's as he's fighting with these guys uh they didn't get a trial in the middle all that mine just all messed up with it here's somebody need prayer for their baby and and he got to go pray for the baby but before the prayer for the baby the tax man called his wife pick up the phone and uh she yelled to him and not not she didn't yell but she just kind of made me mouth to him bill it's the tax man brother brandon run out side the house tell him i'm not here right now his wife looked at him see sarah lied for abraham but sister branham uh-uh this brand says that wait billy no gentleman you want me to tell him what and she you know she she said what he what he told say but when he came back in that house he'd say was that right bill was that right he said yeah it was right when you told him i wasn't in the house i actually wasn't in the house she said but you was in the house when he called couldn't get around it thank god for a holy ghost-filled wife couldn't get around it and that that he said you know you're right and and then the holy spirit jumped on top of what his wife said now you're going to pray for a baby went down there to try to pray for the baby and just just just just feeling that weight that lord i i shouldn't have said that ain't no way my prayer are getting answered i've said something to him to my prayer i'm saying this because some of us say things that hinder our own prayers and we need to make those things right here you know the prophet prophet prophet goes down and prayed for the baby he looked to me and said look if you believe i'm a servant of god just let me there's something that i did what was not right and i need to go make it right before i can pray for your baby just hold off on me a little bit i'll be back let me go make this thing right brother brandon went to the taxman's office hello somebody see the level of conviction was a lot higher back then i don't know where our level of conviction at right now we're live don't even care no don't care about the lie we need to make things right that's why our prayers are not being answered you say he said he went down after that man officer said look sir i need to tell you something he said you just called my house said the man was sitting behind his desk brother ramsey so you just called my house and you you know i told my wife to tell you i won that i was i was in the house when you called but i i ran outside you know to you know i just couldn't take the call i just cut out too much i'm just going through too much i just couldn't take it they say the man got it from his desk walked to the other side where brother branham was he says you know i i did believe in you before see but after today i believe in you more than ever because of the way he handled that thing and you know after he made it right you know after he left that he went and prayed for that baby the baby was here god gave a double blessing he prayed for the baby the baby was healed and then some kind through the midst of out of nowhere that tax case was just dropped taken care of just like that see it's when we can't see our way through it we get to the wilderness of sure and that's that's that's sometimes you're in the best place that god wants you to be and when you're there don't give up don't don't get unsure but be sure be certain of god keep pressing on god will make a way through it when you can't get over it can't get under it can't get around it god opens up a way for you to go through it through it all i learn to trust in jesus i learn to to depend on his word let me finish you all with one of my favorite quotes smyrna church thinking not strange concerning concerning the fiery trials that are to try you that is what peter said is it is it strange that god wants us to develop christ-like character that comes through suffering no sir and we all have trials you put the exact uh that i gave you there that'll bring it up uh it says we all have trials we are all tried and chastened as sons not one but goes through that the church that is not suffering look at this statement the church that is not suffering is not being tried it isn't of god can i say that again the church that is not suffering and is not being tried it isn't of god so as a church we got to go through a particular trial and before we go into our promised land you got to go through the trial amen right says the church that has not suffered has not been tried hasn't got it it isn't of god hebrews 12 6 says this for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth not only just chastens but scourgeth every son whom he receiveth but yet but if ye be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then are ye bastards and not sons look at it now this special condition in smyrna must be applied to every age there is no age free from it there is no true believer free from it this is of god yes yes yes yes right where you sitting at right now this is of god i was thanking the lord i was driving by our or the building that we was just renting and um and i remember when i when i when i when i when that building came open i remember there used to be another church in there and they had a big bus in the back and i would always see that bus parked back there and then a few weeks i would drive by there and i wouldn't see the bus like maybe the bus in the shop i don't know what happened to the bus bus say no around i just kept going by there kept going by the asset ain't no bus where this bus had so one day i finally saw let me drive up in this plaza and i drove up in there and saw a big old sign felice i say oh my this church is available and at that time we needed just a little bit more space i was a little afraid to jump off in that because we we had a very few people and they they want they wanted our rent to double hey man if i i mean they were getting triple the space and they wanted to rent the dub and i'm like lord we ain't got i don't know how we're going to do the few people that we got lord but i remember brother caleb coming and and preaching why was down there in green acres and he said brother jack you lean in a particular direction god said go for it he's with you i broke down crying i say i love hearing the word of the lord the voice of the lord i i'm going by faith and god met our need for 13 years while we were there in that place sometime i tell people what we was painting like what y'all that that's what we have to pay here in florida but the same god that provides your 500 is the same god that provided our 3 500. that's right that's that's the god we serve amen not a different god we don't pray to a different god when the knee get higher we go to the same god and when it's time for us to pay our mortgage he gonna provide he's already i mean look he done proven that over and over again he will provide i need to say that because i'm gonna go back and listen to this tape and i'm gonna need it when i get into the wilderness of sure i'm gonna need to hear that he will provide [Applause] but i was looking i said and then then you know a year ago here landlord comes on say you know what we're gonna double your rent say for the same space i just don't think this is the will of the lord talked it over to the few of the brothers and we all agreed they're saying the will of the lord no this ain't not the double our space not the double our rent for this same space no then they even tried to sell us the space i forgot to tell you all that i said well these all these churches surrounding us like this this is not what i'm this ain't promised land this ain't this ain't promised land no this ain't it no we're not gonna buy this we rent this but we ain't buying it unless we're gonna buy the whole but plaza i i was i was driving near the dead body i said lord i remember when you opened the door and god i also remember when you closed the door so god i want to thank you for every door that you close and i want to thank you for every door you open and while i'm in the hallway i'ma just praise you let's keep reading the special condition and smyrna must be applied to every age there's no age free from it there's no true believer free from it this is of god this is the will of god it is needful we need the lord to teach us the truth that we ought to suffer look at this and to be christ-like in doing it love suffereth alone and is kind i'm gonna tell you i need that lord help me god help me well i i get moody i be wanting god to do things certainly he ain't done i get moody lord help me to suffer alone and be kind i guess i'm the only one like that snapping your kid you almost snapped your kids heads off you just oh what lord help me to suffer long and be kind matthew 5 11-12 blessed are ye when men shall revive you and persecute you and shall say all men of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you here it is one of my favorites the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of god's disapproval just because you're going through don't mean god upset with you no actually god got confidence in you the cloudy skies and storms life are no signs of god disapproval neither are bright skies and still waters that mean you ain't going through nothing signs of his love and approval so you see see the denominational church the you know uh uh many dynamics church they got so much money flowing through that just by building after building some people just give them buildings some of them bought it for a dollar you bought that whole how do i get that blessing but god ain't got it like that for me god got something else for us and i'm gonna tell you something else that i know about god that's something i learned about god um always got your best interest in mine one time we was getting ready to buy a house and we looked at it and said you know and we said we wanted this we wanted that we wanted this we wanted that and we wanted a few things and and then the house was gonna buy it didn't have everything we wanted so we're gonna compromise and take something you don't know how that is yeah yeah the lord just allowed the people not to even take our offer wouldn't respond to the offer didn't do nothing like what happened and we we couldn't figure out what happened to how all of a sudden another house popped up that had everything that we wanted in it not only had everything we wanted in it but it had a motivated seller when i say motivated motivated so motivated that his deal was i will give you ten thousand dollars if you buy my house you know you know what i did y'all know what i no y'all don't know me like that i want to say i'ma pray about this now i got man where the pen at where the pen give me the pen you gonna give me what then right and now you came back out of it god know how to do it i'ma tell you i might as well just say this while i'm here we want to host meetings we want to host the concert for the young people we need a church that will allow us to play host not just a church just to host us i'm thinking beyond us because this just what it is right now y'all ain't seeing who god gonna sing after you get into your building so we gotta have a building big enough and land big enough to handle all of that god already thought that out and he walked around our property right now [Applause] but until then we'll be faithful we'll just praise him right where we are amen cloudy skies and storm the life of no signs of his god's disapproval neither bright skies and still water signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is is only in the beloved his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us ah yes but how shall we know do we know god's love because he bless us with this and bless us with that and bless us with it no that just one that just goes on top of the love but how should we know we should know because he said so yeah yeah have y'all ever heard the lord tell you i love you i love you i love you we should know because he said so and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us of his spirit placing us as sons and how shall i prove my love to him that's how you do it not not just by saying lord i love you but by believing what he said that's the first thing you got to do believe what he said second is and by conducting myself with joy see happiness is something that has to happen to you but joy is something that's there no matter what's going on around you so i'm not conducting myself with happiness i'm conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he in his wisdom allows to come to pass so when i hit the wilderness of sure i'm gonna be certain of god [Applause] god bless you church let's have the musicians and man make their way back up and i'll turn the service of brother solomon here we'll have a word of prayer be certain of god church be certain of god nobody told me the road would be easy but i
