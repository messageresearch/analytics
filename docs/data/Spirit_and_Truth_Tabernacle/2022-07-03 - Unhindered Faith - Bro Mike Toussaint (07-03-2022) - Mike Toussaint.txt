whatever you see that you might think is wrong this morning is not out of place because god has a purpose amen so let's take our bibles if you will amen it's about 11 30 now so we certainly won't hold you alone thank you musicians amen isn't god lovely this morning amen praise the lord we're going going to saint mark chapter 11. we'll take about five verses there and then we'll go to saints first john chapter three saint mark chapter 11 praise the lord when you have it say amen let's bow heads and pray father we thank you for coming down this morning and keeping your word alive to us you said we're two or three and certainly it's many more than two or three and your word is open before us we brought our offerings and we believe by faith it's received before your throne of grace lord and as the word is open father may you reveal it to the hearts of your people lord somebody had to be a witness and you've chosen us to be a witness in this end time father so we do it by faith in jesus christ's name bless us all in jesus christ name we pray and ask it amen saint mark 11 22 amen it says then jesus answered answering saith unto them have faith in god for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he said shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore i say unto you that whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe that ye receive them and he shall have them and when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses let's go to first john chapter 3. amen it says verse 21 beloved if our heart condemned us not then have we confidence toward god and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his commitments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight may god add his blessing to the reading of his word you may take your seat this morning amen amen how many loves the word of god amen praise the lord we want to take for a subject from this portion that we read in those two places if we can draw for a subject this morning we want to subject this unhindered faith unhindered faith that is the kind of a faith the bride must have in this hour is a faith that's unhindered by circumstance it's a faith that's unhindered by symptoms we live in a world today where sin is bold satan is bold so it takes a people of god to stand with boldness by the word of god unhindered faith do you know what type of faith that is that is the faith of god by the holy spirit in his bride that's what we need because if we're to go to a rapture we've got to have faith to go to the rapture we've got to have rapturing faith we've got to have it i want to set the scene for you this morning a prophet says in the message a super sense he says and we are grateful to god that we have the five senses we've got five senses god give us five senses but by no means was these five senses given to you to guide you you see where a lot of us already fall short we're letting these five senses lead us and as long as we're being guided by these five senses we've got to fail but he says they were given to you for earthly contact but there was giving you the sixth sense oh my let the church say amen but there was giving to you the sixth sense and that sixth sense is belongs to the christian only to the christian and you cannot have that sick sense until you become a christian so we want to talk to the christians this morning and we want to cut bring such a conviction on you if you're not a christian to come into the kingdom of god because when christ is returning for what his body of believers which is his bride amen and the only way you get into that kingdom is by a holy ghost baptism you see but that was given to you a sixth sense and that sixth sense is belong only to the christian and you cannot have this sixth sense until you become a christian don't matter how much goods you you devote to the poor it don't matter how much money you you you give to the charity that means nothing you've got to be a christian if you want to make it up there you've got to come into the kingdom of god and you cannot have this sixth sense until you become a christian is the only way that you can ever have any more than the five natural senses for the natural person but the sixth sense is better known to the christian as faith it's the one that governs and guides you and it is superior to all the other senses the sense of sight will fail the sense of hearing will fail but faith is absolute faith has hair on his chest faith is unwavering faith never gets excited faith is not afraid you never saw jesus excited did you ever read the bible and it says jesus was excited on the troubled sea with the winds tossing to and fro jesus just slept in the boat he wasn't shook by the circumstance jesus was never excited why because he had perfect faith and the bible says in this super sense is the holy spirit the faith of god that dwells in you the sixth sense is the holy spirit which is the faith of god that dwells in you you say that's against my faith what kind of faith do you have because there's only one true faith and that's the spirit of god the faith of god that dwells in you when the spirit of god comes in you it gives you a supersense the doctor said i'm sick but the sixth sense says by his stripes he was wounded he was bruised and with his stripes we are healed see we're not going to be healed we're already here if you're gonna have the victory it's got to be right now don't wait for the millennium to have the victory if you want the victory god paid the price if god paid the price why are you trying to pay it again your works mean nothing your works prove your faith but if your works is not by the word of god you have the wrong works jesus paid the price to give the bride a faith unhindered faith unmovable face that in the face of sin faith will stand still but you know that type of faith can only be built on spiritual revelation that kind of faith that the bride should have you should have it there should be no excuse why in july 2022 that if you profess to be the bride that you don't have that perfect faith it comes by the holy ghost you've got to have that perfect faith if you don't have it don't worry about going to the rapture it's not for you but that type of faith is built upon spiritual revelation of who christ is not what the pastor says but what god reveals individually to you oh yeah i heard my mom said that he is christ i heard our pastor said he is christ but if you don't know it you're not made you didn't make it yet and it's time for the bride to put that sick sense into action why do we come sick and leave sick why do we come bound and leave bound when we come in the presence of jehovah god he is the same yesterday today and forever there's enough faith in this room to speak another world into existence and go live in it but the only thing that keeps us from doing that is the word of god god does everything by his word god's word is his law if i may create a word and go live in it what happens to the millennium god has a purpose god has a plan but there should be enough faith in the bride to shake the world there's enough unbelief in the world there's enough sin in the world there's enough hypocrisy in the world then there's got to be faith in the bride [Music] a brother says the sixth sense comes for this reason only that was to make the five senses in you deny anything that's contrary to god's word it don't matter what it don't matter what anybody else says if it's contrary to god's word don't believe that the sickness in you shall let you know that's a lie the bride has got to have that sixth sense see the power of god is down in the bride the power of god is not going to come in the bride it's in the bride it's the promise of god the greater works we should do see the disciples after pentecost had that sick sense that unhindered faith enough to give eternal life to as many as believers not only to cast out devils not only to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover but the power of god is in the bride right now to give eternal life to those who will receive it see the power of god is not coming it's here but the issue is there is a lack of faith in the people to make the word of god move because the only way god's word is going to move is by faith you can't move you can't make it move by into by your intellectual intellectual faith don't matter how much you pray if you don't believe it it's not going to happen you've got to believe you speak to the mountain then believe it's going to move [Applause] amen let me read you something here i said this with the church last time i let me run over it again it says imperfect faith says he had faith jesus had faith with his power how did he he said i can do nothing to myself why he relied upon what he was jesus christ relied upon what he was watching closely he relied in knowing that he was the word and he has faith in god who made him the word he was god the word and there was in him and that gave him faith because he understood his position jesus christ was the word he had faith in the word that made him the word and he understood his position don't let that devil lay around in your life you've got the power to move him out of the way see and uh he says and they wasn't him and that let me go back just a little bit and he had faith in god who made him the word he was god the word and there was in him and that gave him faith because he understood his position he knowed what he was because the scripture had says what he was this and here every scripture tied in to prove that he was exactly what the scripture says if the scripture says that you are the bride your life should reflect what the word says about you and believe you me the world will always recognize a true believer because we're oddballs we're different from the crowd they can't understand us see the disciples could not understand how the ship was just about to turn over but jesus christ was rest asleep he had the unhindered faith he had that perfect faith he was that sixth sense and if christ is in his bride no matter what you see out there christ is in the ship be still ain't know that he is god therefore he relied upon what god had made him and if he did that if christ relied upon what god made him then can't we rely upon what god made us as believers see god predestinated us before you even sin god spoke that the lame will die and when god spoke that the lamb will die before the foundation of the world he associated your name with it before you was even before you was even conceived god had already forgiven you for all your sins so the devil is lying to you you're not condemned you're set free but you just don't know it yet you just don't know it yet but once you can recognize that god has paid the price god has paid the price you can go free if he can rely upon what god made him and if he did that then can we rely upon what god made us as believers see the plan has already been made and god is not going to go back and erase anything he wrote you're predestinated to eternal life that is the plan of god if you don't have eternal life it's because you have not received it just yet it's here for us but we have to have to have the faith but because he you have to have faith in god to receive anything from god amen praise be to our god no matter what we can be in this world the best thing for anyone to do is to come into the kingdom and be identified and take your identification with god in his spirit you've got to be identified the world is not ashamed to be identified of who they are look around they're not the same they're not the same they strip their clothes off to let you know i'm a prostitute they smoke and drink and do these things to let you know i'm a sinner so the bride must believe the bride got to believe and if you believe your works will prove your faith because faith without works is dead profession without a life is dead you may profess all you want to but the devil when he comes against you he know what is at him the devil knew he could not mess with christ that's the wrong one try them one time crush that it is written try them another time cross said it is rain came again christ said it is also rain so what brings the feet it's the word of god and the prophet tells us you'll become the word as you receive the word we gotta receive the word saints and everything that god has wrote in this book for us to fulfill it's our job to fulfill it amen you know the apostles they walk but they're unhindering faith after the day of pentecost there was nothing that could handle the apostles because that the god the christ that walked with them was now in them in the same way that jesus just rested upon what he was the apostles by the revelation who they was by the holy ghost began to have faith in who they were and that's what we need in this end time we've got to have the holy ghost in us our identification to make us to know who we are you can have all of this world's goods but if you don't recognize that you do you will live in poverty but when you can recognize that the god of all creation is your god waymaker miracle worker promise keeper oh hallelujah that's what he is god don't change see the problem is we worry too much we worry more than we have faith we think more that we have faith we reason more than we can have faith but if you can have faith you'll recognize who god is we'll live a defeated life because we fail to recognize what god is we fail to recognize who god is let me move forward it's 11 50. i'm watching my time this morning praise be to our god amen let's move on but you know jesus says here verse 24 therefore i say unto you what things soever you desire when you pray amen believe that you receive them and ye shall have them now what's his next statement and when you stand praying forgive me when you stand and pray [Music] forgive me i'm not saying you're not a christian but what i'm saying is when you stay when you pray and stand praying if you're not forgiving your prayers will not be answered watch what he says if you do not forgive neither will your father which is the heaven forgive your trespasses so one of the greatest hindrances in the church of the living god is a lack of love love to forgive love to pardon pardon is a great thing it's the greatest thing that the believer has received his part in when you know you've done the sin you are guilty of it then you look in the word and it says the lamb was slave for your sin and the prophet comes and said that be the believer do not sin the christians don't have any sin because the seed of god remained in the believer so when the believer can recognize that his sins has been forgiven that's the greatest thing and jesus says the same way i've given you pardon you've got to give that same party and if you cannot pardon it will always hinder your prayer it will always hinder your faith you cannot have faith unless you have love the bible says faith and love is married and when faith and love is married you can ask what you will condemnation in your heart the prophet says condemnation in your heart and god will not come into that heart condemned see god don't dwell in that you got to make it right then when you do you must have faith don't have condemnation in your heart they come before the father for anything you know the prophet one time uh uh went to pray for a little girl we know the story real well but earlier that day he had made his wife to misrepresent something he was troubled by the tax situation he was going through and uh and the lawyer called her home and he ran at the house and told his wife say i'm not here then later on went and tried to pray for a little girl then there was condemnation in his heart and he knew that would handle his faith so he said stay right here i'll be back jesus taught the same thing if you come to the altar and realize that something is not right go and make it right they come back because without making it right if there's condemnation in your heart forget about it you cannot move god god will not build anything on the mess god will not build on sin if you want the movement of god if you want the revival of god if you want the faith of god you've got to have perfect love [Music] the bible says in 20 years of research of the bible and talking with the angel of the lord in the many things i find here is two things that is love and faith if you love god just purely unadulterated love you've got to have faith in him it'll accompany faith every time and when love and faith gets married you ask what you want to and you'll have it but you cannot receive because you refuse to forgive how are we going to go beyond the curtain of time where there is perfect love if we don't have it right here how are we going to spend millennium we're believers of perfect love if we can't forgive he stepped on my toes oh he did this he did that jesus said if they bring him before the law for your cult give him the cloak also as i prophe as the pastor said they stole your dog he took your dog buy you another dog [Applause] we're in america there's plenty of dogs to go around we're holding on to little small things things that mean absolutely nothing [Music] but we want to see god how is god going to come down on top of a mess god don't work by imperfection but god moves by perfection [Applause] you want to see god move get that divine love in your hearts you want to see god move you want your sick to be healed you want the gifts of god in the church repent today and watch god moves what's god move no matter what they did to christ they smote him they beat him he said father forgive them for they know not what they do so if christ is in my heart i've got to forgive i've got to repent i've got to make it right [Music] we think god is waiting on something else god is waiting on you we're waiting for the rapture we want a body change but god is waiting on you you are a royal priesthood a holy nation a holy nation we've got to be perfect saints and if we're going to be perfect then we've got to do it now if we're going to have love in the millennium we've got to have it now see the same ministry that jesus had he never took it away he gave it to the church he says greater work shall you do because i go into my father so if we're coming in here we're not seeing the move of god it's time to repent it's time to come to the altar and get that divine love in our hearts then it will bring faith to move god amen [Music] the prophet says in divine love he says if i say this to the little church that's prayed for me for the world mission that's my success in praying for the sick if i can't get down right down into the feeling of the sickness of with the person it usually doesn't do any good you've got to come right down to it's just you feel it yourself you've got to get down and put yourself in their shoes put yourself in their position in their place then pray for them then watch god move the bible says confess your false ones with another and pray one for another for the effectual fervent prayer of the righteous avenge much if we want god to move we've got to put ourselves in the position of the other one we've got to love our neighbors as ourselves when we get to the gates of heaven god is not going to give you time to repent now is the time to do it we want to see sinners get saved but we got to get right first how are we going to lay hands on the sick when that's come the national hearts how we expect to impart eternal life do you realize what that mean god did not just give us the power to lay hands on the sick but we've got the power to give eternal life to believers but how can you do it when there's sin and condemnation in your hearts we've got to watch it saints we've got to make it clean we've got to make it right it's time to get back in fellowship it's time to get back in perfect love we worry too much we're too sensitive we cry too much but it's time to have love with your faith that will move god that will bring a revival the church it's good to sing we love singing but what about our life where is the life where is the face that was once delivered to the saints this place shall be more filled than saint mary's because wherever jesus is there is life there is grace there is healing there is joy there is victory you don't need insurance you got it keep it but get faith get faith with your insurance god is waiting on us god is waiting on us saints we've got to clean up we sing but there's no life we shout but there's no life we've got to take god's word believe god's word and let god be made manifest in us but he cannot manifest if we're not in the word amen the mountain cannot move if you don't forgive the mountain cannot move if you don't believe you've got to have that perfect love i believe you got it this morning i believe the faith is here right now i believe the bride can receive whatsoever they ask for because god is here to give it to you amen let me skip down a little bit here to the scripture praise be to the lord jesus christ do you love him this morning amen it's time to take the limit off of god you've got to realize when you refuse to keep god's word when you refuse to walk in love you limit god you handcuff god god can only move according to your faith no matter how much he died on the cross but if you don't receive his pardoning grace it will never be to you and that's the thing that moves the that hinders the move of god in his bride is a lack of faith a lack of love but the bible says i'd rather be wrong in my doctrine and right in my heart god will respect it more so if amen is wrong what of it help him he needs help love him do you realize when jesus christ was being crucified when they put a thorn a crown of thorn on his head mistreated him capital punishment it wasn't a joke it wasn't an act christ suffered but still had grace in his heart to say father forgive them enough love in his heart to save the world see christ had enough faith to raise the dead the enough love to wash feet enough love to move the world enough faith to do miracles cast out devils but enough love to say father forgive them for they know not what they do that spirit is in the bride that spirit should be in the church so what of it help him he needs help love him if you can't love your enemy in this the same as you love those who love you you're no better off than republicans that's right that's what the church has failed to get i hope you get it this morning he says i hope you see what i'm talking about is back to love redeeming love all the other things are fine but we've got to come back to fellowship with one another we've got to do it it's time that the brides start digging in their lives we're getting more rich but not more faith more busy but not more love there's enough distractions in the world but not enough time for god but god wants your fellowship he wants your love and you can't have fellowship with god unless you have fellowship with your brother you can't have faith in god unless you have love in your brother or for your brother it's time to get back to redeeming love so it's time this morning there's not much else that need to be said you want faith you want the mountain to move you want god to answer you've got to love and after you have love and dig out everything that's not of god out of you then have faith and god will answer you know the children of israel went to battle one time against moab and they got to a certain place where there was no water and they called the prophet elisha and elijah got the word of the lord he says dig you ditches in this valley you want water dig your ditches you want the divine love of god dig out that old root of bitterness stop being so bitter stop those unclean things because that will bring the power of god in the heart of the believer it's time that the church get desperate because god is only waiting on one thing for the bride to make herself ready we've got some more with that unhindered love by unhindered faith in the word of god we've got to have his saints that's what i have for you this morning back to love back to your divine faith and god will move god will heal god will fight for you paul says i have fought a good fight i finished my course i've kept the face the same faith that was in the apostles christ have to find that same faith god has is coming to only receive those who is walking by that perfect love by perfect faith and his perfect word let's stand this morning let the musicians come [Applause] the prophet says real faith knows no defeat it cannot be defeated even death itself can't defeat it it knows no defeat trials no defeat but faith knows no defeat it cannot be defeated and it is the only way that you can please god for without faith it is impossible to please god let us pray father we present ourselves to you this morning and we for ask for forgiveness for the condemnation that we held in our hearts against your word against your children and we pray that the divine love of god comes into our heart clean us out father and make us fit to stand in your presence father pour it out upon us we love you oh god we don't want to miss the opportunity when you come to not receive our body change you paid the price and you said it is finished so therefore your bride stand this morning we lift our hands to you father help us in this hour forgive us for not reflecting you as we should forgive us for not living a life worthy of your gospel may your love and your power and your faith come into our hearts in jesus christ's name amen god bless you this morning [Applause] god is here you're more than welcome to come and receive divine love god bless you you will see the goodness of the lord and i'm confident yes season change your faithfulness remains you can come and be prayed for if you'd like to be prayed by the minister i believe that i will see the goodness of [Music] the lord [Music] and i'm confident yes he's unchanged your faithfulness remains let's hang it one more time every hand lifted every eye closed oh i believe that i will see the goodness [Music] the lord i'm confident [Music] yes he is [Music] your faithfulness remains god of my presence oh god of my presence god of my future you're right you write my story you hold it you hold it all dick got up got up my prayer god of my future you write my story [Music] you hold it all you hold it all god of my present hallelujah god of my future you write my story you hold it all one more time get out of my present god of my future you write my stories you hold it off you hold it all i believe that i will see [Music] the goodness of [Music] your faithfulness keep playing that softly amen amen amen we were listening uh in the back i liked something that brother mike said he said that faith and love are married hallelujah so we have faith in christ but we have to love be able to forgive one another i want to invite you if there's something that you need to let go of let go of it this morning so that god can move in your life he said when you forgive and you have love god can heal and i believe that we all need healing in some area of our life so let's learn to love and forgive so that we can heal if you need deliverance repent this morning ask god to forgive you and i believe it'll move in your life amen he's god of our present isn't he he's god of our future you are the alpha you are [Music] and the omega [Music] you're in the middle you hold it off you hold brother jack if you can come you are the alpha you can't don't make a pure in the middle [Music] you hold it all when i say it again since you are the alpha you're the omega you're in the middle should you hold it on [Music] you hold [Music] goodness [Music] your faithfulness remains come on sing it again i believe i said i believe that i will see the goodness of the lord and i'm confident seasons change your faithfulness remains [Music] your faithfulness remains your faithfulness remains praise the lord god bless you we certainly appreciate the word of the lord today from brother mike unhindered faith and um i trust that it didn't go over your your head i believe god just dropped something off brother brother branham told us that god was hidden and revealed in simplicity and god just dropped something off uh to let us know that what unhinders our faith is when we can forgive amen i was i learned something a long time ago uh forgive is to set the prisoner free only to realize that you were the prisoner [Music] so forgiveness actually sets you free it unhinders your faith cause god to move on your behalf so brother mike god bless you and amen thank you so much amen now i i don't want to i don't want to be here long but i i did i just wrote a little something down i didn't know i was what my role was going to be but brother joe called me up here so i'm gonna just put just say what was in my heart y'all just give me just a few minutes y'all just be seated just for a second amen um we're here we're here to um it's

oftentimes i like to try to go and find a verse in the bible that with the number eight is somehow associated with it because there's not many of them with 80 80 uh verses or 80 chapters ain't many in there amen so it's a milestone for amen brother let's go to reach this amen this this point and we just thank god for how he's kept them all all through the years and amen we just appreciate what we see the lord doing continuously in his life i want to turn to psalms 119 verse 73 [Music] and it says the hands have made me and fashioned me give me understanding that i may learn thy commandments they that fear thee will be glad when they see me because i have hoped in thy word know o lord that thy judgments are right and thy that thou thou and faithfulness has afflicted me let i pray thee thy merciful kindness be for my comfort according to thy word unto thy servant let thy tender mercies come unto me that i may live for that law is my delight let the proud be ashamed for they dealt perversely with me without a cause but i will meditate in thy precepts let those that fear thee turn unto me and those that have known thy testimonies verse 80 says let my heart be sound and thy statutes that i be not ashamed brother west goes one that we found a man to be sound in the statutes of god and i believe today is a day that he is not ashamed i wanted to uh just just say three things and brother esco i want to thank you for your your faithfulness uh as i work closely with you in ministry over the years i've just just saw the faithfulness amen that you have given god and i remember uh going to a house that you bought one time and i mean the first time you bought a house cause brother west goes to live in an apartment and he bought a house his first house and they walked in i say this is a blessing i say this because you've been faithfully say oh that was it right there he couldn't understand why god had opened up that door for him but it's because of his faithfulness and then he didn't just stay at that house but god gave him another house gave him two houses at one time because of his faithfulness and brother wester i remember a man just watching you work with the people of god oftentimes you have to be so patient and laboring with the saints amen because many of them would let you down and i remember one time i asked brother wesker i said brother how do you continue to put up with all the letdowns that you get how do you stay so positive and brother weskel told me something that day that has stuck with me all the days of my life he responded says you know in order to be a pastor something god has to give you the heart to be god has to give you the heart of a pastor i said i didn't understand it until i became a pastor god gave you the heart and
