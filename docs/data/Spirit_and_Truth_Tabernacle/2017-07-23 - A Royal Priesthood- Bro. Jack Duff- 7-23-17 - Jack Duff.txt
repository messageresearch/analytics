certainly appreciate you all amen on today god bless you I heard the specials as well brother Jeffrey and sister Rebecca thank you so much for your songs on today praise the name of the Lord all right well we can just stand and read a scripture amen on today and and then from there we will begin to take our fault a man and just bear with me you know what sometimes you get to looking at something in the Word of God and sometimes this thing like it's just a common right um but then you know you just start meditating on a God just being just open up you know you're you understand and just just cause you just kind of just look at that look look closer you know and and that's what we're kind of doing with the scripture here we took a thought last week and then we're going to come back remember a little bit more this weekend also a little bit more next week a man until God just releases us but let's not let's look at this out of first Peter chapter 2 a man praise the Lord verse 1 amen reads as follows says wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisy and envies and all evil speakings and you know I make comments about that last week but I tell you if you go back home and you really take a dictionary and really begin to look at what those words what what Peter's saying it'll it'll mean something to you right but it says all evil speakings as as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby if so be EF tasted that the Lord is gracious to whom coming as unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and not only are you chosen of God but your and precious you ought to just tell the devil I'm precious when something precious you handled it differently all right you treat it differently yeah y'all remember the the living rooms the living room that was all white with plastic on top of the furniture and you couldn't go inside that room the room was pretty verse 5 ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ well I'm not gonna go there that'll be for next week but that's that's that's rich yo that's very rich I'm leaving imma leave it where for also it is contained in the scripture the whole I lay in Zion a chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same as made the head of the corner and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense and you know if I could just borrow just a couple words because we know rock being revelation there's some revelations that people are finding offensive a stone of stumbling and the rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient where until also they were that mean they had to do it okay they were appointed but ye that's the but is a good word that's the what they call that conjunction that means something about the change every when I was a little boy he had that little cartoon conjunction junction what's your function and when you see a consumption something changing that mean he ain't he not talking to me in verse eight cuz I'm not one of the disobedient I'm not wanting to dissipate it but I am chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people I'm describing you this morning right that ye should show forth the praises of him who have called you it's what he did for you he called you out of darkness into his marvelous light which in time past were not a people but are now the people of God which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy the Lord at a blessing to the reading of its word shall we pray over the scriptures that we've read father it only takes individual that has learned to read to be able to pick up the Bible and read the things that we have read but it takes the Holy Spirit to make it clear to us the things that we have read that our hearts and our spirits would understand what it is that you have called us to We Trust Oh God that you would now come amen and take control over this portion of the service as we enter into the word we pray father that you would give strength through your word that you would give correction through your word that you would give help through your word whatever it is that we need may you grant it today fathers in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that we pray amen and amen god bless you you can be seated amen our title today is a royal pre to a man a royal priesthood and just so that you know as I was going through my notes on this I ended up with about sixteen pages of notes and when it got that that that much of notes that said there's no way I can preach this in one sermon a man so we're going to break this up a man on today and next week and try to deal with this royal priesthood last week we talked about chosen generation a man and just bringing us up a little bit here when I look at Peter writing such words as this I start reflecting on the life of Peter and just some of the things that Peter had gone through Peter was a man that actually experienced firsthand the first coming of the Lord there it was a man with Jesus seeing so many things experiencing him feeding 5,000 a man and feeding a man a 4,000 you know seeing blinded eyes come open I mean just so many mighty things that he saw Jesus do you would have thought that Peter with a wrote that he was the chosen generation but even Peter haven't experienced that's the only man that was born like us but he took a walk one day on water a man and and and when he did that it showed us praise the Lord it showed us something that we can't just leave it in Jesus lap that that we actually have the the potential within us to be able to do things like this right because Peter did it we know he know he did sing but he won't write and that you might fail in some areas of your life amen but but you can always go back into there but I did with it I did overcome that and I did overcome this yes you might have got me there but when I called on Jesus alright I might have started sinking a little bit but he raised me up when I caught on Jesus right Amen so so Church we can look the devil 9 we don't we don't necessarily have to just you know knuckle down everything that he accuses the thumb we feel a chosen generation a man so when you really when you really just begin to look at Peters life and and all the things that he experienced in 60 years after the death of Christ Peter experienced amen the resurrection right Peter I mean because because Peter was the one that it was told they go you know Peter Peter Peter denied him and and all these other things like that nothing he denied him you know then it was told they go tell my disciples go tell my disciples and you know and another conjunction right don't tell my disciples and Peter that I risen again he made sure he didn't leave Peter out and I'm here to let you know this morning he made sure that he did not leave you out no matter what you don't do you can't be left I see I mean we put Peter thing but you gotta put your name down all my failures and all my mistakes go down go tell my disciples and Jack huh go tell my defense good see y'all disable charlie never done that around y'all so holy you ain't never done that all but the other day you hazardous purpose go tell my disciples and Jack tell them to meet me in Galilee I got something wrong when they get the Galilee see you know and Peter experienced all these great things but yet Peter would write 60 years later it says ye are chosen generation rather than I am a chosen generation but it says ye and the reason that Peter could say ye is that Peter also had a he had a glimpse of the second coming of the Lord and they knew that the second come to be even greater than the first coming and it's always looking at the people that are living in the earth amen at the time of the second coming of Lord and it says ye are a chosen generation glory to God I tell you I say amen to that I am a chosen generation let me just read a couple things here amen and then we will slip on into this thought of royal priesthood here in the message Salome the Prophet says that she says the hour is here says I'm sort of the last one on the last page it says the hours here if I could have been back there before the days that the world was created and looked down and seeing the whole thing it says when the father had said to me what day would you want to live I would say now right now think about that I'm not not doing the first coming of the Lord but I want to live now right now since this is the hour this is the greatest hour that the church has ever move into just before the coming of the bridegroom you are living in the greatest day that could ever be lived in oh my I want to tell you something your your attitude today towards the word of the Lord demonstrates what your attitude would have been had you lived back in those days Oh imma say something i'ma say something you know I mean Church we got it we got to recognize the devil and everything that he's trying to do to us because it's only the devil that that that brings division only the devil do that God don't do that you know at a hospital if a person is sick they'll take a man let me let me let me let me let me put it this way y'all just take that down just for a second if there was a gang-related shooting gang-related that means this gang is going against that gang and bullets begin to fly and people get hit on both gangs do you realize when the ambulance come they will pick up those that are hurt and they will take them to the same hospital say one you might be in different rooms but you don't go to the it's the closest one we're going to take because you're hurt we're going to take you to the closest hospital they not looking to go 50 miles down the road I mean we talk about life or death right now I want you to stay with me right because it's life or death we got to get you to the closest hospital and when you realize people are spiritually dying what you want to do is get them to the closest hospital spiritual hospital to church no matter what the condition is you got to get them to the church and if the natural hospital will accept them right and then you you have the bottom going to natural hospital and get help why can't they come to the spiritual hospital we don't we don't need we don't need the love of Jesus this is where we had it too dis dis message that we preach and got produce the love of Jesus Jesus love is so strong that even when people did I'm wrong it's prayer it's prayer I'm in you Bob I'm quoting your Bible well what do you say his prayer was Father forgive them for they know not what they do while he on the cross dine all right I just just trying to make sure we understand you know when we talk about this message you know not being an alternative to denomination that stuff now you know that's not what we're here to produce Christ right again we gonna produce Christ all right let's let's go on let's go on Amen let's go ain't got nowhere I just on the first quote I'm on the first quote so this is the alwah this is the greatest power that the church has ever moved to do just before the coming of the Lord oh the real Church of the Living Living God ought to be on fire burning with the light of the gospel what being dedicated among them rise and shine for the light has come to you the light of this day Isaiah was the light of his day Noah was the light of his day why he happened work Malatesta and the gospel the Bible words for this day is the light of the day what a glorious time that we're living I can just keep on saying he say I there was the light of his day nor was the light of his team Jeremiah was the light of his team John the Baptist was a light of his day Jesus payments so John the Baptist left us and he became the light of that day and every day but after Jesus died and a man rose again he turned over to the disciples they became the light of their day Paul became the light of his day Iranians retained the light of his day Martin Columba Luther Wesley the light of did a brother parables the light of his day but none of those people are here now while we still in church what is our purpose for being here come on now well you need to understand who you are and the reason you are call here does God want you shining the light under a bushel you got to let it shine because you have become a light of this thing ain't man church all right I'm going on hallelujah let's look at adoption part for y'all just stay with them just this is the foundation that is being laid now there's a there's a part of this sermon where I have to put emphasis because I was told by the Prophet to put emphasis so I'm going to put but let me just get there right adoption part four let's look at what they say first Paul takes all the scare out of it so now if your call if you're not just worked up in your mind by some kind of theology if you're really born to the spirit then God predestinated you before the foundation of the world put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life and now we come together to set in heavenly places in Christ Jesus a holy people a holy nation a peculiar people you know if you if you people on your job don't see nothing different about you if they don't see nothing different about you something's wrong if you looking like them you're not a peculiar person and we got we got folk nowadays walking around with orange hair and blue hair and green hair they don't mind being peculiar what I buy what about ashamed of being peculiar all right listen it says the holy people holy nation a peculiar people royal priesthood offering spiritual sacrifices unto God that is the fruits of our lips giving praise to his name people come in and say them people are crazy sure they are sure they are the wisdom of God is foolish to men to man in the wisdom of man is foolish to God they're contrary one to the other all right we're going to keep on going it says but the spirit a real spirit filled Church full of packed full of power of God set together in heavenly places offering spiritual sacrifices praise of God the Holy Spirit moving among them discerning sin and calling out the things that's among them that's wrong straighten out and make it a flat and level all right because why always in the presence of God in that bloody sacrifice I remember we went through it this morning you wasn't saved by the blood you're kept seized by the blood let me say it again you wasn't saved by the blood but you're kept safe by the blood you were saved by grace through faith believing it and then God not that your heart because he predestinated you you looked up and believed it accept it now the blood makes an atonement for your sins come on I thank God for the blood I thank God for the blood a man a man I went was sometimes all you need to do just get a good glimpse of the blood and that'll just keep the devil at bay in your life listen listen remember that God does not condemn a sinner for sinning he's the center to begin with he condemns a Christian for sinning right and there because he had condemned him Christ took our condemnation so there's no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus that what not after the flesh but after the spirit and if you do anything wrong it isn't willfully oh this is just I want to just soak in if you do anything wrong it isn't willfully you don't sin willfully sometime - double trap you into that and that's why God bring you out of it and when they bring you out of it he wants you to stay out of it you don't sin willfully a man that says willfully goes out and willfully says never come into the body yet but a man that's once in there he's dead as life is hidden God through Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost - the devil can't even find him I like that I want to be in that place where the devil can't find me he couldn't find Moses is wondering where his body was and he argued where is most I mean I know that I wear his clothes I don't even worry about it I want the devil I mean he can't find me I'm so wrapped up tied up tangled up in Jesus that the devil can't find me he's so far back in there he would have to come out of there before the devil can ever get in but you were dead I'm talking about you this morning all right let me uh there was a little situation here Oh My yes yes yes give me just one yes give me just let me go this message here ye him and then we'll keep moving on let me just stay stay with this a little bit here here you have the profits that this the Galatians one now and I want to just I hope your you understand what I'm about to say Galatians one don't say what I'm reading this quote the Galatians 1 don't say what he said it said I think he meant why right I don't mean I'm trying to change the words of prophet I'm just just being honest with your Galatians one don't say that Ephesians one does see that don't make it not the Prophet just make them a man that that that's what it does it makes them a man you understand some people want you to read it like it saying I will read it but I got some people that will go back and look at Galatians 1 they realized that was it and then they'll get confused I thought you said he said yeah I'm just telling you I think he meant Ephesians and I think if he were here and we had a conversation with him he would tell me I meant Ephesians does that deduce it it properly all right ok listen if so if y'all don't mind if I say Ephesians 1 tells us that we were protectin ated to the adoption of sons by Jesus Christ predestinated of God though many are called but few are chosen the chosen was chose at the beginning now but we are predestinated to the adoption of the children of God by Jesus Christ in other words to you Bible scholars what I'm trying to say is a placing of a son listen the son was positioning place and today the church has gone on for year after year after year and when we see God calling man out one of his sons and positionally places him and makes him amen his son and recognizes it before the public then we turn that son down and say he's a divine healer or holy ruler don't you see or where the church I don't know what the remedy is I don't know how to ever get back to this place but that's the way our attitudes are towards that person if the ministries of God God will vindicate that ministry if it isn't of God then God will have nothing to do with it alright praise the Lord what I'm trying to get to this is that we were chosen at the beginning to be predestinated unto the adoption of children we would chose to receive a place in Christ right you were not chosen just to be a church member right but you were chosen to receive a place in Christ and that place gives you authority oh my god it gives you it gives you a man it gives you a position where you don't just have to accept anything the devil puts in your direction you don't have to be defeated you don't have to be it's up to you whether you choose that or not but but but God I mean God has raised us up to a level in Christ right and we can only get here through the blood of Christ right I mean only through that blood we've been raised to level where we don't have to accept defeat and in i'ma tell you something I've been finding in my own person like that God has been allowing certain situations to come into my life and when in situations get there at 5:52 speak the word it actually forces me I don't know nothing else to do I can't cry God don't want me to cry so I'm forced to actually speak and then after I speak I gotta move forward whether I feel it whether I see it or not I still got to speak it in the same way God said let there be light and there was like that I'm sure let there be this and let there be that and then it comes to pass I'm finding that in my own life if you'll even notice that even some of the sermons that God has allowing us to hear sermons that challenged us to kind of raise us up another level the octave is being raised in the believers right it's being raised in believers but you know as we start looking at this you know I was said I was just taking on this book quote here I won't pull it up but you know brother Branham was was given a Tory you know this man I had a dream say in his dream you know he had come in contact with the devil and you know you might have dreams where you'll come in contact with the devil and you got to know how to defeat them right if not not what you are going to have to overcome is how you're going to have to overcome right I mean all of us got have tests all of us going to have trials but we have to use the word of God to overcome the devil and whatever it is that he presents right so this man had this dream and in the dream and then here come the devil a cup come up to him and brother bantam say the man said in the dream that the devil yahoo and then just kept yelling booth every time the devil yell boo you got bigger and bigger the problem got bigger and bigger every time the WL boo so the man say he just in his dream you say now if this devil just keep getting bigger and bigger I'm going to have to do something so now I don't know what to do I don't know what to fight with I have no idea what to use to fight this devil Sam I'm facing something I never faced before say I don't know what to use but in his dream all he saw but it was a little Bible so he picked up his Bible and here the Bible say every time the devil say boo they he say boo they'll say boo boo and he hit them with the word devil say boo boo because of Devin oh yeah boo some of y'all he does get over some stuff but you gonna have to hit the devil back with Abu Abu Simbel I love God use the powers of God and tell that devil boo back said a man kept yelling yelling boo to leave into that devil was killed that same devil that was troubling him what was killed if you want to defeat the devil you got to give them the word come on somebody as I'm trying to elevate us in our thinking this morning right $1,000 god we don't have to accept everything the devil say we can use the word of God the greatest weapon that you have on us today is the word of God the devil say boo boo back and I'm not just saying just say boo just to say boo no no he promised me by his stripes I'm healed that's your boo back to the devil no no no no he said he'd say he got a rebuke to the power for my sink and not only did he stop there he said he's going to open up the windows of heaven and they say he gonna pour me out blessings where I don't have room enough to receive it that mean I got too much money in this bait they won't let me put my mo in there so they're gonna make me open up the letter bank account that's room not enough to receive church I'm just telling me we got to use this word and F sons and daughters of God we have the authority to use the word if we take it we use it at our disposal right we any time the devil comes you got to have something it you got to have a scripture that you can go back to say no this is what God saying I heard what you say but this is what God saying and I believe the report of the Lord all right okay Church I'm just trying to get us up to another level here just just bear with me just a little bit longer glory to God a man if you just just bear with me now when when we look at this bit chosen you know at the beginning we predict that into the adoption children again you find that in Ephesians 1 verse 1 through 14 you'll see that when brother Branham talks about the adoption a son could be born into a family and yes he was a son in that family but what needed to happen is that that boy had to mature and as he matured he got to a place where he can take on his father's business my brother Brandon would share stories like that with us and and how how Paul was just right about God has predestinated us unto the adoption or the placing of children that mean God has put us in position we're on this earth that we can one day take over the daddy's business our fathers God he has a business he wants us to take over the business that that's why you hear your daddy put you here because he wants you to take over the dismiss that that's your whole existence we're so interested in taking over from some man-made business but I'm talking about God business Lord when we get this I saved on change I think oh my god so so so listen when we talk about this choosing you know you think about somebody like David David was what we would consider chosen but when you really looked at David a man in his life nobody else thought that David was chosen said a didn't even think he was chosen his brothers didn't think that he was chosen but God had a thought about David that nobody else had oh my god I don't care how much people put you down it's not what they think is what God thinks about you Oh help us look but but when we're going to realize you know I mean David David there are watched over the Sheep in and out there with instruments and just playing music and writing the songs and doing everything that they need to do just faithfully serving the God serving God the way that he was you know the way it was in his heart and David did that was when God rejected Saul as the king he say I got me another King don't work do you stock to say Sam just stop crying over Saul I got another King already already prepared them well where is he so go down around suggester you'll find them down there so here send me encourage and I'm going to take your oil go down there and what you're gonna find the next king in Jesse's house you get down there and he starts pouring oh say say when the Prophet came here people was uh you know they were like when they saw the Prophet right they might not know what you here for you are you here for peace what why you know what what's the what's the purpose of of the profits showing up because they knew when the profit sure that people are sort of justice to the fun and games it wasn't for a picnic right I mean if this was serious distance that he was on the King's business the King of Kings so when that possibly show up and he's right what you want what you say where I come to your house doubt say the next King is here my house all right let's give us a meal together let's get the profit all fed and this is okay all right we're gonna do all that sir but but I need to see your sons say well Casey you know this is a king in my house I know it's going to be this boy right here this boy he got kingly attributes it's something about this boy I always knew it was something about this boy and profit you just coming to confirm what was in my heart you coming to confirm what was in my heart about this this boy and what I'm not here to confirm it but God is bring the boy took his oil out in the horn and start pulling nothing came out and then just you can see him maybe take some tools out start looking at the horn a little bit maybe something jammed up and hear stopping the oil from flowing nothing they push them to the side said well it must be something in his life that ain't talked to me back here come the next boy and they start pulling nothing they porn nothing six or seven boys coming and nothing so the prophecy like I know God told me to come to this house Jesse do you have any other sons why he had never introduced David didn't even consider David just like some people and introduce you yet and then considered you think they haven't considered sure they have they haven't given any thought as to who you are and here you work with them every day all right Church I'm going there and here he was you know just finished lay where I do got one more son well where is it go get him he out there watching sheep the lowest job in the house he had and here he is out there watch the cheek just doing what what he normally does and here's the right of cutting I get daddy said come home just get yourself all cleaned up and come on home I mean with you wasting everybody to just get on home what am i coming from you know just that they trying to find a king everybody already know you not the king but we're gonna appease the Prophet because maybe God meant another Jesse's house and Here Come David into the house smelling like she don't look like no King Oh God see I'm talk about ROI your research royal precent right and here here here here David David don't look to Royal but here David come walking into the house and and the Prophet get anoint yet no oil is floating nothing but he feels something in his spirit [Applause] I'm going lighthouse I mean but maybe before even picked up this his is all with the oil in of the Olaf is different all right because Dave walks in here is a beginner PO and all is all over the place they think nothing I hate it but David was Realty and they might not think anything of you but I'm here to let you know this morning that you are royalty you're part of a royal priesthood now I thought the issue is that when you think about what Peter wrote Peter says royal priesthood and the emphasis should probably be on priesthood I put it there next week but this week I'm gonna put it on Roy y'all will stay with me royal means to be tingly now what I want you to understand meaning that you're supposed to act like a king brother or sister if you hear that brother or sister you're supposed to act like a teen talk like a teen you have authority like a king a team don't ask nobody else what they think a king speaks from his own inner being and whatever Kings said it has to be exactly like the King said and that's what you say if you would say if you would say to the mountain and don't doubt in your heart it will be just like you say you know when a king speaking he establish something he just turn and walk away he not question nobody action about why you felt about that it don't matter how detail the King spoke when we talk about being a part of a royal priesthood you are supposed to be tingly and I wanna I wanna I want to make sure I emphasize that you're supposed to be King cannot not now that they got they got another part to that definition it says it means tingly or belonging to a king as its children so no matter which way it goes you can lose a king's child running from a bully the bully gonna run from the king chop the bully rise up and say boo that might be his last bow if tell us to recognize who we are we first of all nama saya I am a king I'm not just a some of the king I am 18 now I make it somebody face and there and they face it I'm not a king but I'll be the southern king that's fine you keep your favorite this but I am a king you want to know why Jesus is called the King of Kings you want to know why he's considered the King of Kings because he's got some Kings right here stop looking at everybody else's time looking at yourself King time for Kings back watch Kings walk right King talk like him all right let me let me let me just drop something here please just let me give a look quote cuz I told you I got to put emphasis in certain areas because I was told to let me read this out of revelation of Jesus Christ and before we read that give me Revelation chapter 1 verse 5 and 6 I want to read that because if you're going to start acting like a king sometimes you know you feel like I'm no king because you don't realize how powerful the blood is you don't realize how powerful the blood is it's not based on what you've done it's based on what he has already done His grace is what save you his blood is what keeps you safe look at this in Revelation 1 verse 5 and 6 we read this earlier and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the Dead and the Prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and brother branham say that word wash means used I mean not only have you better wash from sins but you've been loosed from seeing oh you don't you don't we don't get it yet you ain't going back to that old lifestyle you've been loosed from it and you know what the blood loosed you wash you and freed you listen say the blood loosed you from from for a looseness I wash washed us from our sins in his own blood and hath made us kings and priests so this is where we get royal priesthood so I'm going to focus on the King part and next week we'll talk about the priests but you have been made kings and priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion for ever and ever amen now let's just read a little statement here from the prophet and then I'll make a few more comments and we'll come out today I just had to just set up a little foundation and make a few things and statements and hopefully it'll settle down in the city but here from this message a church age book I met paragraph 35 - 3 he says this he hath made us he has made us it says oh there are certain truths we need to emphasize together put emphasis on you he says there are certain truths we need to emphasize this is one of them what she said into the truth that's got to be emphasized a must of us and that truth is you are a king the blood of Jesus Christ has made you king not Queen King Queen no have the final six of the kingdom he hath made you tea and as an overcomer he's gonna sit in the throne with him come on search King all there are some truths we need to emphasize this is one of them he hath made us he he have made us salvation is his doing salvation is of the Lord all the days he redeemed us for a purpose he bought us for a purpose we are not going to be y'all we are king hope it Cynthia we are tanks spiritual kings oh we are going to be kings upon the earth with him when he sits on the throne but now now we are spiritual teak and we rang as I'm not defeated me I'm a king says we are spirits of Kings that we reign over a spiritual Kingdom it says in Romans 5:17 for if by one man's offense death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and a gift and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ and in Colossians 1:13 who have to live in us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom rain of his dear son let me just let me just put it there right now right now right now not not tomorrow not next week not three or four years from now right now today this moment right now we reign with Christ listen to this having dominion you control it Church having dominion over scene not only let you have dominion over the world you have dominion over your flesh I got a quote here later I read it later if I could get there he said you got you got you got you gonna be an overcomer over your fashion and over your passion [Applause] you have a compassion in fashion oh you ain't gonna be like the other ones cuz your royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people you can overcome fashion and passion because you got control over a king a king don't say I just can't get control over this brother Jack when you King Kings got control King tears himself differently he acts differently he you know when a person has a certain level of authority they don't bring themselves down to a lower level do you you have to get up where they are I mean they know they know where they look at you and what the only some stuff you don't even respond to because you had a certain level oh my god and I ain't right you get to this level when you truly bit loose from your sins this is what it'll bring you right now we reign with Christ having dominion over sin the world the flesh is it one more there you got dominion over the devil [Music] you understand that that means that mean you order the devil what to do if you tell the devil no it's closed and it's not no less can we negotiate can we huh oh no you took it to a king somebody take your hat off if you treat the king room y'all know that's what that man did when David got spit on he say you gonna let that take don't talk to you like that I'll take your head off man if if angels that wanna fight for King they just wait until your world is angels wanna fight the Kings do you realize when Jesus was at the cross you know brother BAM say all I had to was not his hat and the Angels would have changed the whole thing a king has to keep his control have to keep his composure and specially when he knows what the will of the father is but a king understands how much power he had that's why careful with his word because he realized how much powers in the worst see as spiritual Kings you have spiritual power jesus has so much power that he could just say no man eat from this tree no more and the power that came out of his words caused a tree within 24 hours to shrivel up and just died and that's the God that lives inside of you and what I'm telling you is I wish I could just I I wish I could put this on the mirror of your car and the mirror in your house right now I can we just read this again right now we we rang let's read it together on the count of three one two three right now we reign with Christ having dominion over sin the world the flesh and the devil Oh glory to God showing forth its praise and glory showing forth himself for it is Christ and less willing and doing of his good pleasure yes indeed even now we are seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus now I'm gonna stop right there because the rest of that is talking about priests next week we'll talk about priests I bring that same quote right back around the whole pool because I want that to really register right now now that that puts you in a different category because you know you've always talked about being a son of a king that's true that's true but you know the son of the king when the King passes on becomes and I'm gonna tell you another thing sometime the King know has to be dead before his son become king did not Salomon become King before David died well I just begin to think to myself if we are Kings there's certain conduct that we should have his Kings certain conduct and I'm uh just put this in because I just went back to some quotes here from from prophet and and one one statement that he'd made and I'll read this one this is out of the message I'm welcome Christ never got some more time just a little bit more time I mean because what you find if when a man recognizes that he's King I made the statement even though he is a great man he makes others feel greater because he knows who he is and since I know who I am I don't have to act down I'm gonna make you feel a little bit bad about yourself oh my you understand look at this unwelcome Christ you says and you call yourself a Christian and so starchy you can reach down to shake hands with a beggar on the street and talk to him about the Lord you call yourself a Christian oh you're so good find out there ain't much good about us when you think of him becoming a foot wash flunky flunky the Lord's there was he really in heart was the highest there was he was the heart of God and become the lowest-paid foot wash flunking him he who gave who was great become to know that he might redeem you back to make you great you know what I've noticed this in my travels you usually find great men are little man I go around where there's great men really great men and I know they're great man but when I start to lead them they make you think you're the great man they ain't nothing but to take a little 2x4 don't know nothing he thinks he's all of it he ain't nothing to begin with it's a great man our little man they never brag or take honor they make you feel that you're great there that's great man and here the greatest of man the greatest of all men God manifested in flesh become a foot wash flunky with humility the king of all eternity all glory the creative heavens and earth washed the dung off of men's feet churches something about a real king the great man a king is the highest authority in the kingdom and when that man he reaches that point he's so humbled by it right that it makes him treat everybody else as if they're greater than he is oh my say I mean we come all to it realize who we are now there's some actions that should come out of this of recognizing who you are King is the final authority I mentioned earlier you know but I'll just I'll just I'll throw this in you know they thought to kill Jesus they sought to kill Moses and and the reason that they did that because of the kings of that day put out an edict that they had to kill these babies two years old and under the the the male babies that was the Kings eat it they had to execute a lot of children died a lot of them died right because the King said so in the days of Daniel the reason Daniel went into the Lions dens because of what the King signed right he could pray to any other god but the king and because of Kings eating Daniel end up in the lion's den but that same king was praying all night today God brought them out hallelujah I was thinking about another nother edict from a king one time the king couldn't sleep and he started reading through some old books and after to pick up a book just one of the books as we pick it up the book he was reading how somebody had uncovered a plan of how his life was about me taking it and and then this man you know there's this man uncovered it but the man was never rewarded and it so so so he sitting there thinking couldn't go to sleep that night just reading through this book and then all of a sudden that man's enemy walked into the King's presence and his enemy was coming in with a certain desire he wanted to kill the man that was not rewarded Haman wanted to kill Mordecai all right so the king the king before before Haman could get the words others must he say says he said you say Haman Haman I get before your famous sake let me say this what should we do for a man that is some distance on that clock King so if the man has done this has done that for a king we ought to put that man on a horse and we ought to walk through the city and we are that we ought to say this is what the King does to those that honor the king and Haman say I know oh boy I'm giving to get some armor I'm get ready to get up on a horse and they go on bow down to me finally I'm gonna get this guy Mordecai to bow because the king and the King herds they're all that the fastest that's a great idea say Haman yes sir do that for Mordecai and because the King said it there was no discussion you realize I don't care how upset Haman was the king had made a statement and you know what from my understanding from reading scripture it was only them to their one whole bunch of other people in that room just them to maybe some people maybe somebody might have heard a little stuff but Haman knew don't go against what the king say hey me when I got that horse put more to cow on top of it and start riding through the city this is what the King does to those that honor him but God know how to make your enemies your footstool if you just allow him to and you just keep reading him a story didn't end up that well it changed in one night Oh God is a good God all those things happened to Haman because of the Kings eat it a king looks good even when he feels bad I want to say it again a king looks good even when he feels bad all right i'ma read the quote for you because you don't believe me you don't believe me now notice the sermon town perfection bullying this quote from the sermon title perfection so you gotta act perfect even though you'll feel perfect you gotta act that way it don't you don't you don't feel good but just do I mean he looks good even when he feels bad look at this look at this says here's some time ago when mr. Baxter was my manager when the king of England when when when we was there to visit when the Queen come out lovely lady her pretty roboam her graying hair and the king setting so thick at the time he could hardly stand it he had a stomach trouble and multiple sclerosis that was just before he was prayed for that means he had it but he got delivered from it right says but he could he could hardly stand up but yet the royal blood but yet the royal blood of him stuck what little chessy hat out and he rolled down the street in the carriage mr. Baxter standing there and when he passed I looked at him his lips was quivering the tears was running down his cheek he put his big arm around me and said brother Brandon I said yes sir brother Baxter he said you know I'm a Canadian yes he said that man who's over our land the king him and his lovely bride and wife is passing by that's where that's where that's where I can't hold my emotions I have to give vent he just start crying says I put my arm around him I said brother back so as a Christian with you what will it be some glorious thing when the King comes with his bride if a man could think that when seeing an earthly king which is more like we are what will it be when we see the King of Kings coming in glory what a glorious time it'll be so even when a king feels bad he still looks good I'm going back to the definition I'm a king I'm also the son of a king royal means King Lee or belonging to the king as its children so if your royal then you also have certain conduct and brother branham told us another story this fella was brought over on some ships he was forced out of his country came here to the US not on his own wheel but he got here but still knew who he was brother branham tells us the story of this man since when he got here this man you know what they put him on the block to be sold as a slave and and they you know they the first owner got him and everything like that and said now other people come by and try to buy some of the other slaves you know they try to buy and they when the first owner got ahold of this man he say I ain't never selling this man I'm not doing it hey well say okay and now he said he said he said he noticed that when this boy no matter what his condition was because see the thing of it is is a king has the whole hold his head up and dire situations dire circumstances the king keeps his head up high no matter what condition he's in this is how the King walks you never know when the king going through cause he looked the same he is the same yesterday today and forever so that's what was in dire situations he happened to be the son of a king so here he is you know sold into slavery and and and the owner some same every day he had a certain aura about him that even encourage the other slaves it's just something about having that that fell around and and saying that as they were you know as they would I come I mean different people different owners would come they want to buy some of the safe they say well we want to buy that one right there's none he not for sale just no he not for sale no he not for sale no don't even try downtick how much money you got to offer that one is not for sale so when it's one it's one people actually not why why is he so different they do you feed them differences no he eat just like the rest of you treat them differently I treat them just like I treat the rest well why is he so special why is he so precious why say I had the same question I had the same question I had to start because when I saw him act the way he was that guy I couldn't understand because everybody else look upset by their conditions but this one no matter what his condition was he still kept the same outlook knowing he would never go back home again but yet he still had a certain aura not an attitude alright not an attitude alright it's act I asked one day I start asking around so what was the difference with this felling they told me it's that he happens to be the son of a king and it realized that he's royalty and say since he's the son of a king he has to act like the son of a king even though he'll never see his father again he's still gonna act like royalty right here so if you haven't made it to the point in this message yet to realize that you a king you still some of the king and you still gotta act like royalty you got to conduct yourself like royalty because you are part of a royal priesthood and the emphasis today is on royal because he's made you a king and a priest let me just read just a few more things from here now I'll let it go glory to God alright alright alright making away and then Jehovah Jireh says this here's some time ago down the Southlands there was people used to go by and buy slaves and so forth I just happened to think of this little store and they went by with by slaves date notice two poor fellows had been beat they they hate to lead the country and they know they'd never be back the negative people it was pitiful how they was treated one day they happened to notice one young fellow with his shoulder throw back I didn't bring this quote where brother Brandon say as a Christian you could never believe in slavery as a Christian never right so I said it was pitiful how they was treated had to be I have to beat him no sir somebody come by said let me buy that slave he said he's not for sale he said well what makes him so much different he is either boss who arrested him said no so what makes him different do you do you do you let him eat better no he eats with the rest of them what makes him so different said I happen to learn that his father is a king of the tribe though he's in a far land he still throws his shoulders back he's a royal born man his dad is a king though he's an alien his father is a king let me go to Jehovah Jireh and I'm just reading a portion of this one because he says this what are our what are all our conduct to be and he was what I'm bringing is the end of the this thought he was talking about the same young man that wasn't African that brought in as a slave he's talking about that in Jehovah Jireh but I'm just bringing in the end of that quote says what are all our conduct to be not like the world but we should act like sons and daughters of God conduct ourselves like Kings children not like slaves of fashions and slaves of passion and slaves of pride we should be sons and daughters of God and act like it and conduct ourselves that way let our conversations and everything be seasoned with God's Spirit as you can see your conversations with other things but you want to see it with God's Spirit I am talking to Kings a royal priesthood God richly bless you amen let's have the musicians come and we'll have a word of Prayer my god father sometimes you just want us to really think on what you have called us to father we are not just not just children of the king but you have made us kings and priests the Prophet told us that there are certain truths that need emphasis and it said this is one of those truths that need emphasis that we have been made kings and priests with royalty not going to be right now we are royalty god I pray for myself I don't want to be a preacher that would preach this but not Linux not express it in my own lives help me to walk like royalty help me to talk like royalty help me to think like royalty because that's who I am you made me that it's time for me to rise up and be who you've called me to be I can change the situation I can change the circumstance all by the way my words come out oh God angels are sitting present waiting to make those words come to pass it will just release them Oh God sometimes what I
