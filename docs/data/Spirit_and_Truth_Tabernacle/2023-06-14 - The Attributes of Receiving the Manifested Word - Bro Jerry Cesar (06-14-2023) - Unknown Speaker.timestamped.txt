[0:43] at your table
[0:45] father Lord God you said in your word it
[0:47] is better to be at your table than to be
[0:49] who father Intense or or dwelling in the
[0:53] counsel of the ungodly
[0:55] but father God we have made a choice
[0:57] this evening father that we would come
[0:59] and serve you and come and hear your
[1:01] word
[1:01] Lord we believe that you have prepared a
[1:04] word for us tonight so God I pray that
[1:07] you would speak Thy word Lord speak thy
[1:09] truth father that God your bride once
[1:12] more Lord would be edified your bride
[1:14] wants small love will be unified in your
[1:16] spirit father God I pray that you would
[1:19] meet the needs that are present tonight
[1:22] father God you know all about them Lord
[1:24] even before we ask father God you are
[1:27] aware so father God we commit ourselves
[1:30] to you and we pray that you'd be
[1:32] merciful to those that are still on the
[1:34] way and God those that are even watching
[1:36] online father God we pray that you would
[1:38] oh Father anoint what is being
[1:40] transmitted father God through the
[1:42] technology and God made change and
[1:45] transform and fulfill what your word has
[1:48] purposed to do god father God we also
[1:51] pray to you watch over our pastor and
[1:54] Lord our brothers father that has
[1:55] traveled God to fulfill your word Lord
[1:58] God we pray father that you would use
[2:00] them in a mighty way oh God and have
[2:03] your way with them Father we thank you
[2:04] tonight we commit all things into your
[2:07] hands move me out the way father God and
[2:10] may you have the preeminence tonight in
[2:12] the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen
[2:16] I want to turn our Bibles tonight
[2:19] in the Book of Luke
[2:23] chapter 24 and we'll start at the 44th
[2:26] verse
[2:27] if you all would stand with me
[2:31] praise the Lord
[2:33] and just say Amen when you're there
[2:36] it's Luke 24
[2:39] the 44th verse
[2:42] praise the Lord
[2:45] and it reads and he said unto them
[2:49] these are the words which I speak unto
[2:53] you while I was yet with you
[2:57] that all things must be fulfilled which
[3:01] were written in the law of Moses and in
[3:03] the prophets and in the Psalms
[3:06] concerning me
[3:07] then open he their understanding that
[3:10] they might understand the scriptures
[3:13] and said unto them thus it is written
[3:16] and thus it behooved Christ to suffer
[3:20] and I like that word behooves because it
[3:23] means a Duty or responsibility for
[3:27] someone to do something
[3:29] and I like that word because you're not
[3:32] Christ's burdened
[3:33] you are his duty
[3:36] so anytime you find yourself
[3:38] in a need you realize that your need is
[3:42] not a burden to Christ
[3:43] it's his duty
[3:46] as we continue reading uh it says thus
[3:48] it is written and thus it behooved
[3:51] Christ to suffer and to arise from the
[3:54] dead the third day
[3:55] and that repentance in remission of sins
[3:58] should be preached in his name among all
[4:02] nations beginning at Jerusalem and ye
[4:05] are witnesses of these things and behold
[4:08] I send the promise of my father upon you
[4:11] but Terry here Terry Yee in this city of
[4:16] Jerusalem until ye be endued with power
[4:19] from on high and he led them as far as
[4:22] to Bethany and he lifted up his hands
[4:25] and blessed him and it came to pass
[4:27] while he blessed him he was parted from
[4:30] them and carried up into heaven and they
[4:33] worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem
[4:35] with great joy
[4:37] and last verse it says and they were
[4:39] continually in the temple praising and
[4:42] blessing God Amen
[4:44] you may have your seats
[4:48] may God add a blessing to his word
[4:51] and if I could use as a subject tonight
[4:54] I want to use uh the attributes of
[4:58] receiving the manifested word
[5:02] the attributes of receiving the
[5:04] manifested word in our theme this
[5:06] evening is Terry here
[5:10] now
[5:13] as we continue this
[5:15] little study tonight
[5:17] we find that
[5:19] God has always had a purpose in his word
[5:23] and in his word God will allow all
[5:26] things to be
[5:28] scripture says Heaven and Earth will
[5:30] pass away but the word of God will stand
[5:32] all circumstance
[5:34] and In This Moment here we find that
[5:37] Christ
[5:39] is telling his disciples
[5:41] that he would send his promise of his
[5:44] father upon them
[5:46] but before this promise he said
[5:49] Terry here in the city of Jerusalem
[5:52] until you're being due with power
[5:55] now these disciples had something that
[5:58] they could rest upon and it became their
[6:01] expectation that there would be a
[6:04] Witnesses of something God was getting
[6:06] ready to do
[6:07] now I said that it behooves Christ to
[6:12] endure the suffering it behooves Christ
[6:14] to actually go to the cross
[6:17] and I like it because Christ did not pay
[6:19] a price haphazardly
[6:21] for our lives he committed himself unto
[6:25] death
[6:26] right and when we realize that we find
[6:29] that God's not obligated to us because
[6:31] of who we are he's obligated to us
[6:33] because of who he is and he's made a way
[6:36] for us that we can all find peace and
[6:38] rest tonight
[6:40] and a message hear ye him in 1957.
[6:44] 0105
[6:46] it says Jesus confirmed it
[6:49] he said no man can come to me except my
[6:53] father draws him first
[6:55] it is God seeking man you have nothing
[6:59] to do with it if you ever felt the hand
[7:02] of God knock at your heart you are a
[7:04] privileged person
[7:06] no man is saved not what you do but what
[7:10] he done notice no man is saved by law
[7:13] and I'm glad that he dismissed Moses
[7:16] Moses represented the law of the Sabbath
[7:18] keeping non-meat eating and all those
[7:20] laws and shadows he said away with it
[7:23] and we find in John chapter 1 verse 12.
[7:26] it says but as many as received him to
[7:29] them gave he power to become the sons of
[7:32] God even to them that believed in his
[7:34] name
[7:35] which were born not of blood not the
[7:38] will of God nor the will of man but of
[7:40] God and the Word was made flesh and
[7:43] dwelt among us and we beheld his glory
[7:45] the glory of the only begotten son full
[7:48] of grace and truth the law was fulfilled
[7:51] through Moses but Grace and Truth came
[7:53] by Jesus Christ
[7:55] right
[7:56] and now we find
[7:58] the title that I chose the attributes of
[8:01] receiving the manifested word
[8:04] now
[8:05] in the New Testament one of the first
[8:07] Miracles we find even before Christ was
[8:10] born and it was roaming through the ages
[8:13] and it took so many years for it to come
[8:16] to pass but it was that aversion shall
[8:19] conceive
[8:20] and when
[8:22] when this encounter came forth before
[8:25] Mary there was a family member that also
[8:28] got to be a witness of God's miracle of
[8:31] God's manifestation it was her cousin
[8:34] Elizabeth
[8:35] and Elizabeth was the Bible says
[8:39] blameless her and her husband's
[8:40] Zacharias blameless before the Lord they
[8:43] were righteous people
[8:45] but when it came time for Zacharias to
[8:48] receive the manifested word of what was
[8:51] told that would come to pass he he
[8:53] doubted it he had some art to some doubt
[8:56] in his heart and the scripture says he
[8:58] was he was a dumb man until his son was
[9:02] born
[9:03] now we find
[9:05] in the same in the same scene the the
[9:08] same Angel Gabriel visits Mary and tells
[9:12] Mary that uh we'll read it here in Luke
[9:16] the first chapter
[9:20] and it says and of 26 verse
[9:23] and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel
[9:25] was sent from God unto a city of Galilee
[9:29] named Nazareth to a version of spouse to
[9:32] a man whose name was Joseph
[9:34] of the House of David and the virgin's
[9:37] name was Mary
[9:38] and the angel came unto her and said
[9:41] hell they are highly favored she the
[9:45] Lord is with thee blessed are thou among
[9:48] women and when she saw him she was
[9:50] troubled at his saying and cast in her
[9:54] mind what manner of salutation this
[9:56] should be
[9:57] and the angel said unto her fear not
[9:59] Mary for thou has found favor with God
[10:03] and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy
[10:05] womb and bring forth a son and shall
[10:07] call his name Jesus
[10:10] he shall be great and shall be as the
[10:12] son of the highest and the Lord shall
[10:15] thou the Lord shall give unto him the
[10:17] Throne of his father David and he shall
[10:20] reign over the house of Jacob forever
[10:22] and of his kingdom there shall be no end
[10:25] and I like how Mary's attitude throws
[10:29] this Angel was
[10:31] because she didn't understand what was
[10:34] happening but she was willing to submit
[10:36] herself to the prophecy
[10:38] Now The Story Goes On verse 34 then Mary
[10:41] said unto the angel how shall this be
[10:44] seeing that I know not a man and the
[10:47] angel answered and said unto her the
[10:49] Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the
[10:52] power of the highest shall overshadow
[10:54] thee therefore also that Holy thing
[10:56] which shall be born of thee shall be
[10:59] called The Son of God and behold thy
[11:01] cousins Elizabeth she hath also
[11:04] conceived a son in her old age and this
[11:07] is the sixth month with her who was
[11:09] called Barren for with God nothing shall
[11:12] be impossible and Mary said behold the
[11:15] handmaid of the Lord be it unto me
[11:18] according to Thy word and the angel
[11:20] departed from her Mary was able to
[11:24] receive the message of the angel of that
[11:26] day to her and because she received it
[11:30] she was she became the Fulfillment of
[11:34] what was prophesied from ages before her
[11:37] time
[11:38] now
[11:39] the purpose of the word was was never
[11:41] for it to become to be to remain written
[11:44] the purpose of the word was that it
[11:46] would bring forth life to produce a
[11:49] substance of life
[11:50] right that's the purpose of the word now
[11:54] Mary receiving the word she became the
[11:57] carrier of the word
[11:59] and her became the manifestation of the
[12:02] word
[12:04] now
[12:07] she was predestinated we know that the
[12:10] promise was made since Genesis and she
[12:13] was the predestinated vessel to receive
[12:16] the promised word
[12:18] and because she was the predestinated
[12:21] word when she met what was said of the
[12:23] word by the angel Gabriel it became the
[12:27] manifested word
[12:28] in Luke 24
[12:31] 9 again it says behold I send the
[12:35] promise of my father upon you and Jesus
[12:38] spoke these things to the disciple and
[12:40] told them but Terry in the city of
[12:42] Jerusalem until you be endued with power
[12:44] from on high now the power could not
[12:47] come
[12:48] without a tearing
[12:50] the power could not come without a
[12:52] tearing
[12:53] and
[12:55] I like that because the disciples had to
[12:58] understand not when Jesus would send the
[13:02] power
[13:03] but that Jesus would send to power they
[13:05] had to rest on that word it didn't
[13:07] matter where it didn't matter when but
[13:10] they had to rest on that word and God's
[13:14] promise for them was to Tarry
[13:17] as long as they were under that word and
[13:20] obeyed it they would receive what was
[13:22] spoken now
[13:24] we find that in Second Kings
[13:28] chapter 2 the first verse
[13:34] and it says and it came to pass
[13:37] when the Lord would take up Elijah
[13:40] into Heaven by a whirlwind
[13:43] that Elijah with Elisha from gilgal
[13:48] and Elisha said to Elijah Elijah said to
[13:51] Elisha Terry here I pray thee for the
[13:55] Lord has sent me to Bethel
[13:57] and Elisha said unto him as the Lord
[14:00] liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not
[14:03] leave them leave thee so they went down
[14:06] to Bethel and now Elisha had a very
[14:09] specific attitude towards this word
[14:12] his attitude was that no matter the
[14:15] circumstance I will tarry hear now when
[14:20] we look at that it's easy to realize
[14:23] that perhaps Elijah meant for relation
[14:25] to Terry at a physical location where
[14:28] they were or perhaps to tarry at some
[14:31] place but the way that the word said it
[14:35] in the way that Elisha received it
[14:37] as though it was a dual meaning is that
[14:40] Elisha said
[14:42] as thy soul liveth and as the Lord
[14:45] liveth I will not leave thee and Elisha
[14:49] had to stand grounded to follow Elijah
[14:52] wherever he was going
[14:54] and we learned that gilgal Brownell says
[14:57] was just the first stage that
[14:59] represented justification
[15:01] and as they continued
[15:05] we find that
[15:07] in the third
[15:08] verse it says in the sons of the prophet
[15:11] that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha
[15:15] and said unto him know his doubt the
[15:17] Lord will take away thy master from thy
[15:19] head today
[15:21] and he says yea I know it hold ye your
[15:24] peace this was Elisha's attitude and
[15:27] Elijah said unto him Elisha Terry here I
[15:31] pray thee for the Lord hath sent me to
[15:33] Jericho
[15:34] and he said have the Lord liveth and as
[15:37] thy soul liveth I will not leave him and
[15:40] that word Terry
[15:42] means to abide in expectation
[15:46] it means to remain or to stay in a place
[15:49] to sojourn
[15:51] and Elisha could stand
[15:54] no matter where Elijah was going he had
[15:58] an understanding of Revelation of
[16:00] Eliza's life that he wanted to be a
[16:03] witness of
[16:04] now we find in the
[16:06] fifth verse
[16:08] it says I in the sons of the Prophet
[16:10] that were at Jericho came to Elisha and
[16:14] said unto him know it's that the Lord
[16:17] will take away thy master from the head
[16:19] today and he answered yay I know it hold
[16:24] your peace and Eliza said unto him Terry
[16:27] I pray thee for the Lord has sent me to
[16:30] Jordan and he has said as the Lord
[16:33] liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not
[16:35] leave thee and they too went on and
[16:40] Prophet did uh certainly just brought
[16:44] out uh the the understanding of this
[16:46] scene as he went from gilgal to uh the
[16:50] the school of the prophets and from the
[16:52] school of the prophets unto Jordan and
[16:54] at this point we find that they had to
[16:57] try they had to cross over the other
[17:00] side of Jordan and Jordan represented
[17:02] death
[17:04] Elisha was willing to go all the way
[17:07] even unto death to be with Elijah
[17:12] and I believe that's what it requires of
[17:15] the believer
[17:16] going until death where where where
[17:20] death can be placed in you everything
[17:22] that is contrary or everything that is
[17:26] connected to our flesh can come to a
[17:29] complete death
[17:30] right if we if we just think on the
[17:34] things that are just physical attributes
[17:36] we will live as physical beings and we
[17:40] will die that way but if you think on
[17:42] the things that are Eternal and
[17:44] spiritual you will live as Spiritual
[17:46] Beings and you inherit God's Eternal
[17:49] Rewards
[17:51] now we find that in verse 9 at verse 8
[17:56] rather it says and Elijah took his
[17:58] mantle
[17:59] and wrapped it together and smoked the
[18:01] waters and they were divided hither and
[18:04] hither
[18:04] so that they too went over the dry
[18:07] ground and it came to pass when they
[18:10] were gone over that Eliza said unto
[18:12] Elisha ask what I shall do for thee
[18:15] before I be taken away and Elijah said I
[18:19] pray thee let a double portion of thy
[18:21] Spirit be upon me and he said thou Hast
[18:24] has asked a hard thing nevertheless if
[18:28] thou see me when I am taken from thee it
[18:31] shall be so unto thee but if not it
[18:35] shall not be so and I can imagine
[18:38] how fixated Elisha had to be on Elijah
[18:42] he had to keep his eyes only in Elijah
[18:46] brother Brado said he couldn't have one
[18:48] eyeball on Elijah and one eyeball on the
[18:51] on the students of the prophets
[18:53] and I believe it's the same thing
[18:55] because Eliza was a type of Christ you
[18:57] can't have one eye on Christ and one eye
[19:01] on the things of the world it takes
[19:03] having both eyes fixated on Christ at
[19:07] all times and Elisha was convicted and
[19:11] convinced that what Elijah had said
[19:15] would come to pass
[19:17] now Elijah I like how he said thou has
[19:21] asked a hard thing
[19:22] but nevertheless if thou see me when I
[19:25] am taken from thee it shall be unto thee
[19:28] now this was not the Lord himself that
[19:31] granted this request to Elisha it was
[19:33] not thus saith the Lord this was Elijah
[19:36] he said this in authority of his of his
[19:40] position
[19:42] now it came to pass verse 11.
[19:46] that as they went on and talked that
[19:49] behold there appeared a chariot of fire
[19:51] and Horses of fire imparted them both
[19:54] asunder and Elijah went up by Whirlwind
[19:57] of Heaven and Elisha saw it
[20:00] and he cried my father my father The
[20:04] Chariot of Israel and Horsemen thereof
[20:07] up also unto the matter and he saw them
[20:10] no more
[20:11] and he took hold of his own clothes and
[20:14] rent them in two pieces and he took up
[20:16] also the mantle of Elijah that fell from
[20:18] him and went back and stood by the bank
[20:21] of Jordan
[20:22] and he took the mantle from Elijah from
[20:24] him and smoked the waters and says where
[20:26] is the Lord God of Elijah
[20:29] and we can ask the same question where
[20:32] is the Lord God of Elijah
[20:35] the Lord God of Elijah is manifested in
[20:38] you tonight
[20:40] the Lord God of Elijah has manifested
[20:43] himself through Elijah and I like it
[20:47] because the manifested word produced the
[20:50] manifested word
[20:52] and notice how
[20:56] Elisha was an attribute of the
[20:58] manifested word when he received it
[21:01] that's what he became the very thing
[21:03] that he was fixing his eyes on is the
[21:06] very thing he came a product of
[21:09] and John
[21:13] John 14 12 says verily verily I say unto
[21:16] you he that believeth on me the works
[21:18] that I do shaeedu also and Greater Works
[21:21] than these shall you do because I go
[21:23] unto my father
[21:24] and whatsoever you shall ask in my name
[21:27] that will I do and the father may be
[21:30] glorified in the son if you shall ask
[21:33] anything in my name I will do it I
[21:37] believe this is the the position that
[21:40] Elijah was standing on
[21:41] that whatever that Elisha had desired
[21:45] it would come to pass
[21:48] and Elisha was entrusted with a greater
[21:51] work of Elijah because he had a double
[21:53] Spirit of Elijah
[21:56] and the bread of Jesus Christ is
[21:57] entrusted with that same greater work we
[22:00] just read it says Greater Works how you
[22:02] do because I go to my father and we know
[22:05] brother Branham says it's not a greater
[22:07] work but it's a it's not a greater
[22:09] measure of what Christ did it's more of
[22:12] what he did
[22:14] now
[22:16] a question and answers preached 1964
[22:20] 0 8 30 in the morning it says paragraph
[22:23] 88
[22:25] now brother Branham
[22:28] could you just look uh could Jesus look
[22:31] like you
[22:33] or you be Jesus or something like that
[22:37] now this was a question that was asked
[22:39] brother Branham
[22:41] if he was Jesus Christ
[22:44] and this was based on the way that he
[22:47] lived the the way he conducted himself
[22:50] but he answers the word he answers the
[22:52] question he says one sense of the word
[22:54] that's exactly the truth
[22:56] another sense of the word is an
[23:00] antichrist that's the difference between
[23:02] right and wrong
[23:04] to make me the person of the Lord Jesus
[23:06] Christ would be an antichrist for that
[23:09] person of the Lord is sitting at the
[23:11] right hand of majesty on high and will
[23:14] come again with great power in glory
[23:17] and we'll just jump to paragraph 89 it
[23:19] says remember my message on Messiahs
[23:22] see the word Messiah the anointed one
[23:25] now you are if you have the Holy Spirit
[23:28] you become the anointed one then there's
[23:31] all kinds of anointed ones
[23:34] now watch if the Bible many of them are
[23:37] anointed the whole thing is such in a
[23:39] great conglomeration
[23:41] saying with all of his kindness come in
[23:44] and impersonate it just to the dot
[23:46] almost to the dot there's only one way
[23:49] you can absolutely be sure that's check
[23:51] the word by the word word by word
[23:54] there's only one way you can
[23:56] and he goes on to say in paragraph 92 it
[24:00] was so beautiful beautifully typed in
[24:02] Elijah and Elisha when Elisha was taken
[24:05] up the Elijah the old Prophet going home
[24:08] and he was tired and rarely and there
[24:11] was a chariot hooked across the river
[24:13] and he take him up home with horses of
[24:17] fire and did you notice when Elijah and
[24:19] Elisha crossed the river the school of
[24:22] prophets was up there watching him and
[24:25] Elijah took his mantle and struck the
[24:27] river and when it did it divided and he
[24:29] ran across and he said to the young
[24:31] Prophet what are you following me for
[24:34] what do you wish he said a double
[24:36] portion of your spirit come upon me a
[24:39] double portion of that Mighty Prophet
[24:41] come upon me he said you've asked a hard
[24:44] thing but if you see me when I go away
[24:47] then it'll come upon you so you can
[24:50] imagine how he watched the prophet
[24:53] paragraph 94 says now in that day the
[24:55] prophet was the word for he was the
[24:57] manifestation of the word to the world
[25:00] see he know that he had to be a greater
[25:03] Ministry come because it required a
[25:06] greater thing and when Jesus was here on
[25:08] Earth he was Elijah these things that I
[25:12] do you will do also greater than these
[25:14] things shall you do because I go unto my
[25:16] father now you're going how are you
[25:19] going to do it watch him who is he the
[25:21] word see watch him praise God and I
[25:25] encourage you tonight Saints to watch
[25:28] Jesus as you watch him you'll become him
[25:33] and we'll continue here
[25:37] now
[25:39] when Elijah when the double Spirit of
[25:43] Elijah Came Upon Elisha
[25:46] Elijah said this was a hard thing
[25:49] this was a hard request this was a hard
[25:51] desire but this week this this this
[25:53] initiative that whatsoever you would ask
[25:58] was was initiated from Elijah
[26:01] and Elisha just asked he says
[26:06] a double Spirit a double portion of that
[26:08] spirit
[26:09] and if we turn to our Bibles to Matthew
[26:12] 20 verse 20
[26:17] and while we turn there I'd like to read
[26:19] this other quote from the prophet
[26:23] it says it says the message the prophet
[26:26] Elisha
[26:27] preached in 1954.
[26:30] paragraph 20 he says after Elijah had
[26:33] crossed over God over on the other side
[26:36] he said to that young prophet and them
[26:39] two prophets represented perfectly
[26:41] Christ in the church
[26:43] Elijah was going away leaving the
[26:46] authority with the church
[26:48] was a type of Christ going away leaving
[26:50] the authority with the church but the
[26:53] church had to come through Lutheran age
[26:55] through the Methodist age through the
[26:58] baptism of the Holy Spirit die out to
[27:00] itself in order to receive the blessing
[27:03] there's got to be a death
[27:06] that comes before the blessing
[27:08] and it goes on to say that's the way to
[27:11] ask ask plenty God likes to give that
[27:14] way
[27:15] that's that's the trouble people say I
[27:18] asked the father for so much oh my don't
[27:21] be scared to ask him ask and ask just
[27:25] all you can ask he likes to give you
[27:27] just as much as you got faith to receive
[27:30] he won't run out God's got plenty of
[27:33] blessings and he's got a blessing for
[27:35] you tonight you can't be afraid to ask
[27:38] him
[27:39] you see when you ask him you have to be
[27:43] expecting to receive of him
[27:46] and and I believe it's not just asking
[27:49] for big things it's asking for things
[27:51] that that that are almost impossible
[27:54] what Elisha had asked Elijah was a hard
[27:57] thing but he received it and that's the
[28:01] that's the word that the bride of Christ
[28:02] stands on today where the bride can ask
[28:05] confidently for things that only God can
[28:08] do
[28:10] now we find in this Matthew 20
[28:13] verse 20 it says then came to him the
[28:17] mother of zebedee's children with her
[28:19] sons
[28:20] worshiping him and Desiring a certain
[28:24] thing of him and he said unto her what
[28:27] will thou what is your request in other
[28:31] words she saith unto him Grant these
[28:34] that my two sons May sit the one on thy
[28:37] right hand and the other on the left in
[28:40] thy kingdom
[28:42] but Jesus answered and said ye know not
[28:45] what you ask
[28:46] and if I could just add this was
[28:50] something that was asked that was not
[28:53] even into existence yet what's uh the
[28:56] mothers that the zebedes as brother
[28:59] gwinner would say sister's ebony
[29:01] that's what she was asking she was
[29:03] asking for something that didn't even
[29:05] come into existence yet
[29:07] and Christ had to put them back in
[29:10] position to say you don't even know what
[29:13] you're asking for
[29:14] now it goes to say are you able to drink
[29:17] of the cup that I shall drink of and to
[29:21] be baptized with the baptism that I am
[29:23] baptized with
[29:24] they say unto him we are able
[29:28] and he said unto them ye shall drink
[29:30] indeed of my cup and be baptized with
[29:33] the baptism that I am baptized with but
[29:36] to sit on my right hand and on my left
[29:38] is not my to give
[29:41] but it shall be given to them for whom
[29:44] it is prepared of my father
[29:46] and this is a very interesting response
[29:49] because Christ knew what the request was
[29:55] he knew what it was which is why he
[29:57] could say it's reserved for them
[29:59] whom is prepared for of my father
[30:02] and
[30:04] and I like this because we know that
[30:06] Christ has gone to prepare a place for
[30:08] you and I
[30:09] he's gone to reserve a place for those
[30:12] that are consecrated in him
[30:15] for the manifested word of the
[30:17] manifested word
[30:19] now
[30:20] what is this place
[30:22] that a a sister Zebedee was asking
[30:27] Jesus what was this place
[30:30] if we read Revelation chapter 3 verse 21
[30:34] it says to him that overcometh will I
[30:38] regret to sit with me in my throne even
[30:41] as I also overcame and sat down with my
[30:45] father in his throne he that hath in
[30:47] here let him hear what the spirit say it
[30:49] to the churches
[30:51] so this was something that uh a sisters
[30:54] ebony was concerned about her two sons
[30:58] being James and John that they would sit
[31:01] one at the right hand and the other at
[31:02] the on the left hand
[31:04] now if we read from the prophet
[31:09] we find it says in paragraph 94 the
[31:12] message how can I overcome
[31:14] you know one time the mother of James
[31:17] and John
[31:18] he says we won't have time to read it
[31:21] do you know that Lord you remember that
[31:23] Lord let my son sit on one side and my
[31:26] other son sit on the other side
[31:28] says there's a mother's desire for her
[31:30] son but watch
[31:32] but that place Jesus was predestinated
[31:35] this position was not in existence at
[31:38] that time why notice it will be granted
[31:41] to them who is met for watch the one
[31:45] that sat on the right hand and the other
[31:48] closest to him was yet an overcomer
[31:51] he said I don't Grant this I can't Grant
[31:54] this but it will be given after the
[31:57] trials come he said amen I can't give
[32:00] this but after the trial comes they'll
[32:02] sit on the right hand and on the left
[32:05] there's a predestinated seed waiting out
[32:07] yonder for that it will be given to the
[32:10] ones that is promised to it'll be given
[32:13] but the test hasn't come yet
[32:16] and we know that we're living in the
[32:18] great and terrible day of the Lord
[32:20] that that predestinated a a a place was
[32:25] reserved for you and I because there
[32:28] Christ knew that'd be a a a age that
[32:31] would be filled with Darkness a age
[32:33] where there would be tribulation after
[32:35] tribulation but he also says there will
[32:39] be Overcomers right they would overcome
[32:41] by the blood of the lamb and the and the
[32:44] word of his testimony and we know that
[32:47] if God has said in his word we will
[32:50] overcome we will overcome no matter the
[32:54] circumstance
[32:55] but God has allowed us to be in a season
[32:59] where we can ask because God says ask
[33:02] abundantly that your joy may be filled
[33:04] he wants us to ask of him of these
[33:07] things that he would bless us of these
[33:09] things
[33:11] now if we continue here
[33:14] we find
[33:15] that at the day where
[33:17] day of Pentecost
[33:19] where scripture says that they will
[33:22] receive power after the Holy Ghost would
[33:24] come
[33:25] and we find that Peter and John once
[33:29] they receive this power once they
[33:31] receive this anointing in their lives
[33:34] the first thing that they one of the
[33:36] first things that they did they went to
[33:37] this Temple and at the gate of beautiful
[33:40] the scripture says there was a certain
[33:42] man
[33:43] and we'll read it together here
[33:46] verse 2 in Acts chapter 3 says there was
[33:49] a certain man
[33:50] that that came that was laying from his
[33:53] mother's womb was carried away whom they
[33:56] lay daily at the Gate of the temple
[33:58] which is called Beautiful to ask of alms
[34:01] of them that enter into the temple and I
[34:04] like it because this man wasn't just
[34:06] sitting there asking but he was sitting
[34:08] there expecting to receive something
[34:11] and as he was sitting there the
[34:12] scripture says he looked upon Peter and
[34:15] then Peter fixed his eyes on him first
[34:18] thing Peter told him is look on us
[34:21] just like Elijah told Elisha to to watch
[34:24] me
[34:25] now look on us it wasn't talking about
[34:28] the flesh but Peter and John at this
[34:30] point in their lives was the manifested
[34:33] word
[34:34] look on us and Peter says Silver and
[34:38] Gold Have I None but what I have I give
[34:41] unto thee this was a substance that only
[34:45] God himself could produce in the life of
[34:48] Peter in the life of John you see and
[34:51] one of the attributes of receiving the
[34:54] manifested word is that you become an
[34:56] enforcer of the word you go to certain
[34:59] places and people will have to check
[35:03] their lives and act in a righteous way
[35:05] because you're there because your life
[35:08] calls for a higher standard your life
[35:10] calls for those two have a reference for
[35:13] the word of God
[35:15] right now this man went from being a
[35:18] beggar to a worshiper right he got
[35:21] healed the scripture says he's uh he
[35:24] immediately
[35:26] come on he immediately received strength
[35:29] in his bones and his feet
[35:33] and he he got up and he walked and he
[35:36] entered into the temple walking and
[35:37] leaping and praising God
[35:39] this attitude of this man allowed him to
[35:43] receive the manifested word
[35:45] right he he had an attitude of being
[35:49] under expectation to receive something
[35:52] it was his season to receive that
[35:56] now
[35:59] we find
[36:04] here that
[36:07] as
[36:08] Paul as Peter has done these things that
[36:12] was questioned that arose
[36:14] and I can imagine
[36:16] at this point after such a miracle after
[36:20] such a supernatural occurrence that
[36:23] questions would arise
[36:25] we see if the word does not challenge
[36:27] you it's a moment to reflect because
[36:31] wherever Peter went wherever John went
[36:35] no matter what they were surrounded by
[36:37] the word allowed them to find a way of
[36:40] Escape
[36:42] right now
[36:44] we find here
[36:50] in second Corinthians
[36:55] chapter 4 verse 16.
[37:03] and
[37:06] I like this because verse 16 it reads
[37:09] for which cause we faint not
[37:13] but though our outman word outward man
[37:16] perish yet the n-word man is renewed day
[37:20] by day
[37:21] for our light Affliction which is but
[37:24] for a moment worketh for us are far more
[37:27] exceeding and eternal weight of Glory
[37:30] which means if you're not going through
[37:34] something
[37:35] there is not a weight that you'll be
[37:38] able to bear that will allow you to
[37:40] overcome
[37:42] and it reads why we look at things which
[37:46] are seen
[37:47] but at things which are not seen for the
[37:51] things which are seen are temporal but
[37:53] the things which are not seen are
[37:55] eternal
[37:57] and
[37:58] when we think about that
[38:01] the disciples that Jesus Christ chose
[38:05] he gave them power
[38:07] he gave them power over serpents power
[38:10] over the devil he gave them power that
[38:13] that the the threat upon serpents and
[38:15] scorpions
[38:16] power over the enemy
[38:19] and he says nothing shall by any means
[38:21] hurt you
[38:22] but after he said all of that he had to
[38:25] reassure them he had to tell them
[38:28] he says notwithstanding in this Rejoice
[38:31] not because the spirits are subject unto
[38:34] you
[38:35] but rather Rejoice because your names
[38:37] are written in heaven
[38:40] he had to realign their eyes so they
[38:43] weren't looking at the physical power
[38:47] that they had or the power over spirits
[38:51] right this was a power that they were
[38:54] defaulted with
[38:55] but Jesus had to tell them that there's
[38:59] one thing to have the power over spirits
[39:02] but it's one thing to have the power to
[39:04] believe the word
[39:06] and that's why Judas was not able to go
[39:09] all the way because there was something
[39:12] in him that was lacking
[39:16] it takes power of believing the word and
[39:20] as you believe the word you become the
[39:22] manifestation of the word
[39:24] and in closing I want to
[39:27] I want to add this here
[39:31] and a message
[39:36] an exposition of the seventh Church Asia
[39:38] this is the Ephesian Church age
[39:44] it says the True Church of Jesus Christ
[39:47] the bride is likened until pure gold
[39:51] her righteousness is his righteousness
[39:53] her attributes is his own glorious
[39:57] attributes her identity is found in him
[40:01] what he is she is to reflect what he has
[40:05] she is to manifest there is no fault in
[40:09] her she is all glorious within and
[40:12] without from beginning to the ending she
[40:15] is the work of her Lord and all his work
[40:18] are perfect in fact and her is summed up
[40:22] and manifested the Eternal wisdom and
[40:25] purpose of God how can one fathom it how
[40:29] can one understand it though we cannot
[40:32] un do though we cannot do that we can
[40:35] accept it by faith for God had spoken it
[40:39] and how can all-powerful God look upon
[40:43] us and choose us for this purpose
[40:45] it's because like I said earlier not
[40:48] because of who we are but he's obligated
[40:52] to his word because of who he is
[40:54] his nature causes him to be perfect in
[40:58] all of his ways and when we receive that
[41:01] word we carry the same nature when we
[41:04] receive that word we carry the same
[41:06] power where we can be unified in the
[41:09] spirit
[41:10] now
[41:13] in second Corinthians
[41:16] chapter 5.
[41:18] though we don't understand it
[41:21] there's a longing there's a desire in
[41:25] our hearts
[41:26] to be clothed with our Eternal
[41:30] Tabernacle
[41:31] in verse 1 it says for we know that if
[41:34] our Earthly House of this Tabernacle
[41:36] were dissolved we have a building of God
[41:39] and house not made with hands
[41:42] Eternal in Heavens
[41:43] for in this we groan earnestly Desiring
[41:47] to be clothed upon with our house which
[41:50] is in heaven if so be that being closed
[41:53] we shall not be found naked for we that
[41:56] are in this Tabernacle do groan being
[41:58] burdened not for that we would be
[42:00] unclothed but clothe upon that mortality
[42:04] will be swallowed up of life now he that
[42:07] had wrought us for the same self thing
[42:10] of God who also have given us the
[42:12] earnest of the spirit
[42:15] therefore we are always confident
[42:17] knowing that while we are at home in the
[42:20] body we are absent from the Lord
[42:23] in verse 7 for we walk by faith and not
[42:26] by sight
[42:27] praise the Lord and we find that
[42:29] scripture says we have the earnest that
[42:32] means we have the down payment
[42:35] that means we have
[42:38] the substance in us to walk in this
[42:41] power to walk in this manifested word
[42:44] and as we walk in this manifested word
[42:46] the manifested word allows us to
[42:50] overcome all things allows us to oversee
[42:54] all things right scripture says when the
[42:57] enemy will come in like a flood the
[42:59] spirit would raise up a standard against
[43:01] it the standard is reflected in our
[43:04] lives no matter where we go
[43:06] because there is an attribute of
[43:09] resurrection power there's an attribute
[43:11] of righteousness there's an attribute of
[43:14] Holiness all these things God allows to
[43:17] flow when we become the manifested word
[43:20] of our day
[43:22] praise God
[43:24] let us bow the word of Prayer
[43:29] thank you
[43:30] dear heavenly father
[43:33] Lord God I just thank you Father for

[44:56] that father in every circumstance Lord
[44:58] God will will be faithful and will pass
[45:02] the test Lord and as you've promised in
[45:05] your word we will overcome and sit at
[45:07] your right hand

[45:22] we can't give someone finances or or or
[45:25] different things of man-made material
