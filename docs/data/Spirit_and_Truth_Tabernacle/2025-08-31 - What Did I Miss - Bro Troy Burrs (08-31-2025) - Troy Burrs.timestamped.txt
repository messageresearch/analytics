[34:04] time is filled with swift transition.
[34:07] [Music]
[34:09] Every day is not the same.
[34:13] We go through many trials and
[34:14] tribulations, Lord.
[34:17] But Lord, the one thing is we keep our
[34:19] minds stayed on you.
[34:23] You promise to keep us in perfect peace,
[34:27] a peace that surpasses all
[34:29] understanding.
[34:30] [Applause]
[34:32] Now Lord, as we come this morning,
[34:33] Father God, we approach your word with
[34:35] humility. Oh Father,
[34:38] Lord, we ask you to speak, Lord,
[34:42] to those that are gathered here this
[34:44] morning.
[34:46] When they leave this place,
[34:49] they'll know that they've been in the
[34:50] presence of Almighty God.
[34:53] Not in the presence of me, Lord. May I
[34:55] hide myself behind the cross Lord and
[34:57] you project forward
[35:00] meeting people at the point of their
[35:02] need.
[35:04] We ask these blessings in Jesus name we
[35:07] pray.
[35:09] Amen.
[35:11] Amen.
[35:12] [Music]
[35:14] You may be seated.
[35:18] Amen. Thank you musicians.
[35:22] Amen.
[35:25] Brother Jerry,
[35:27] &gt;&gt; man, something else.
[35:34] Appreciate all of you. Amen. This
[35:38] morning,
[35:40] pray for me.
[35:42] I get the
[35:44] &gt;&gt; get the bugs out
[35:47] and that I can just get into a channel.
[35:51] Amen. and preach the message that God
[35:52] gave me.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. I first of all like to
[35:59] um say happy birthday to Sister Brown.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; See, she got her crown on this morning.
[36:13] Amen. And all of the family that have
[36:17] come. That's something when your family
[36:19] come
[36:20] &gt;&gt; to church with you
[36:22] &gt;&gt; to celebrate you.
[36:23] &gt;&gt; True. Amen.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. That says a lot about our sister
[36:27] Brown.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; No, her children. But I got to tell
[36:31] y'all, y'all ain't her only children.
[36:38] Y'all going to have to share Sister
[36:40] Brown.
[36:44] Mama Brown,
[36:50] &gt;&gt; it's been a long time and we will all
[36:53] come up together
[36:57] &gt;&gt; and Mama Brown was always right there.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; And the family, we've all got I don't
[37:03] see who else here. I see um
[37:08] Kesha and Ryan. I don't see Caprice.
[37:11] Okay. Praise the Lord.
[37:16] Yeah, we all grew up there together.
[37:20] Amen. So, it's just good to see all of
[37:22] you.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. I trust the Lord bless you this
[37:26] morning.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; I want you, if you don't mind,
[37:33] we're going to read a quick scripture
[37:37] from John 4 and 22.
[37:40] Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to
[37:42] take my time this morning. Is that all
[37:43] right?
[37:49] Man,
[37:52] [Music]
[37:55] quick scripture from John 4 and 22.
[38:00] And it says,
[38:03] "Ye worshiped me. Worship ye
[38:09] know not what
[38:13] we know
[38:16] what we worship for salvation
[38:20] is of the Jews.
[38:24] But the hour cometh,
[38:26] and now is
[38:29] when the true worshippers
[38:31] shall worship
[38:33] &gt;&gt; the Father in spirit and in truth.
[38:38] For the Father seeketh such to worship
[38:41] him.
[38:44] He seeketh such to worship him sir
[38:49] &gt;&gt; in spirit
[38:51] and in truth. Amen.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; God is a spirit
[38:58] &gt;&gt; and they that worship him
[39:03] &gt;&gt; must
[39:08] worship him
[39:10] in spirit
[39:12] and in truth.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. May the Lord add a
[39:17] blessing to reading of his word.
[39:21] I had in my heart
[39:25] to first sort of
[39:29] define or explain
[39:31] just a little bit
[39:34] of what makes this church
[39:38] spirit
[39:39] and truth tabernacle
[39:42] different
[39:44] from other churches.
[39:48] There have many churches in the land.
[39:52] We know about past many of them to get
[39:54] here this morning.
[39:57] But in my
[39:59] history
[40:02] of different churches,
[40:05] we realize
[40:07] that a lot of times
[40:11] churches are preaching
[40:14] a white throne
[40:17] judgment rapture.
[40:21] What makes us different
[40:25] is that we're preaching
[40:28] to a first resurrection
[40:32] bride.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; So therefore,
[40:38] our
[40:40] dialogue
[40:42] may come across a little different. All
[40:45] right.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; Now, we're preaching to the lost.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; But we're primarily
[40:54] getting a bride
[40:56] ready
[40:57] &gt;&gt; for a rapture.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; Now, those that may come up in what we
[41:05] call the second resurrection,
[41:09] &gt;&gt; there'll be a group
[41:11] &gt;&gt; and we preach to them as well. Yes.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; And trust that their life is worthy
[41:19] enough at that time
[41:22] to go into heaven.
[41:27] But there will be a cost to pay
[41:31] for missing that first
[41:35] resurrection.
[41:39] So primarily we preach the gospel
[41:45] to a first resurrection bride. You see
[41:50] uh the prophet
[41:53] explains
[41:54] that
[41:56] there is a garment
[41:59] and
[42:02] some of you sisters know
[42:06] uh we have right over here a young lady
[42:09] that does a lot of our alterations.
[42:13] Some know them, some some don't. But
[42:15] she's right across the street is where
[42:16] her shop is.
[42:19] And uh
[42:21] as a seamstress,
[42:24] we know that
[42:26] you take a piece of garment and you lay
[42:30] it out on the table
[42:34] and uh
[42:36] you lay that garment out
[42:39] and you take what's called a pattern.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; Uhuh. And you take that pattern
[42:48] and you lay it upon the garment
[42:53] &gt;&gt; so that you can cut out
[42:55] the pattern.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; Right?
[42:58] &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet of God
[43:01] told us that
[43:03] who lays the pattern.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; God lays the pattern.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:13] We have nothing to do with it.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; He lays the pattern by election.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; Now, if you just so happen to
[43:28] wind up in that pattern,
[43:30] &gt;&gt; all right,
[43:32] &gt;&gt; you can't be lost.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; Church, say, "Amen."
[43:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; So, he takes that pattern
[43:42] And he cuts
[43:44] he cuts
[43:46] to make a garment.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; That garment
[43:53] is what is used or go up as the bride
[43:59] &gt;&gt; in the first resurrection.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[44:02] Now the rest of the material is still
[44:05] good material
[44:09] &gt;&gt; but it is set aside for maybe another
[44:13] garment
[44:16] &gt;&gt; that is the second
[44:20] &gt;&gt; resurrection.
[44:24] So I want to be
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:29] [Music]
[44:32] &gt;&gt; You hear a lot of times
[44:34] in um history of church and with our
[44:39] religious circles they used to sing a
[44:41] song after the separation.
[44:45] It was called I want to be in a number
[44:51] &gt;&gt; all around the throne
[44:53] &gt;&gt; after the separation
[44:56] &gt;&gt; from the right
[44:58] &gt;&gt; and the wrong
[45:00] &gt;&gt; I want to be in the meeting
[45:03] &gt;&gt; around the throne.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; Now I want to be in that meeting
[45:08] &gt;&gt; but I don't want to be judged at that
[45:10] meeting.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll be there.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says in that first
[45:20] resurrection,
[45:21] there is something that takes place.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; And it's called a wedding.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; Right.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; And to get in the wedding, you have to
[45:31] have
[45:32] &gt;&gt; the right garment.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; You have to have your dress fixed just
[45:41] right.
[45:42] Yes. Hallelujah.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; And you can't come any other way
[45:48] but through the door.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; The story about a man who tried to come
[45:53] through the wonder.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; So when they walk through, they say,
[45:58] "Sir, how did you get in?"
[46:02] &gt;&gt; No doubt he's wondering, "How did he
[46:03] know he didn't have the right garment
[46:06] on?"
[46:08] &gt;&gt; And I want you to know Jesus is that
[46:10] door.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yeah.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; There's only one provided way.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; He is that door.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; But if you don't know him,
[46:20] &gt;&gt; oh my.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; In other words,
[46:25] in spirit and in truth,
[46:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[46:28] &gt;&gt; You're liable
[46:30] to miss it.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; And you know what? That's not saying
[46:35] that you're not a good person. Right.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; You can be
[46:40] &gt;&gt; justified.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Sanctified
[46:46] &gt;&gt; and filled with the Holy Ghost
[46:51] &gt;&gt; and miss it
[46:56] &gt;&gt; and miss it.
[46:58] I want to title this morning,
[47:03] What did I miss?
[47:07] Lord,
[47:07] &gt;&gt; what did I miss?
[47:10] &gt;&gt; And as a subtitle,
[47:12] &gt;&gt; alterations.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; If you
[47:19] a wedding garment,
[47:22] the first thing I guess the bride would
[47:24] do is the one of the most exciting
[47:27] things in the preparation is
[47:30] uh
[47:32] getting that wedding dress.
[47:36] But that wedding dress,
[47:39] you go and you get measured and all of
[47:41] that kind of stuff. And I don't know a
[47:42] whole lot about this cuz I ain't never
[47:44] got no wedding dress. And I ain't go
[47:47] with nobody to get no wedding dress.
[47:50] But one thing I do know is sometime that
[47:52] thing has to be altered.
[47:56] And when they stand up, they pick out
[47:59] the dress,
[48:01] they step up on this pedestal,
[48:06] and they look in the mirror.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; And generally, it's a mirror
[48:12] with three sections.
[48:15] And they turn and they look and they,
[48:18] "Oh, no.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; This this this this ain't it. Come on.
[48:25] Come on.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; Go get me another dress.
[48:31] Then when they find the one
[48:34] that they just fall in love with,
[48:38] now they give it to the seamstress
[48:40] &gt;&gt; preach it.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Preach it.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; To be altered
[48:47] in the message.
[48:50] um
[48:52] a prisoner
[48:54] uh 58.
[48:57] The prophet says this.
[49:00] Now this little kid had never exactly
[49:04] seen himself
[49:07] in the mirror. He says like that.
[49:11] So he come to a city.
[49:18] Make sure I'm reading the right part.
[49:26] No, go to 56. I'm sorry.
[49:30] He says, "As I preached some time ago at
[49:32] the businessman businessman's meeting in
[49:34] Phoenix, Arizona
[49:36] of the reflection of Jesus,
[49:40] reflecting Christian life."
[49:43] I said I was born up here in Kentucky
[49:46] where it's very primitive, especially
[49:49] back when I was a kid.
[49:52] And this certain little boy never had a
[49:56] home like we have here
[50:00] where we had so many pretty ladies that
[50:04] have to have that have to have to look
[50:07] through mirrors
[50:11] all through the house
[50:14] to just uh to keep their hair just in
[50:17] place and so forth. But he had one
[50:21] little mirror,
[50:24] just a little piece tacked onto a tree
[50:27] outside
[50:30] where the wash bench was, where his
[50:33] mother and father used to wash and comb
[50:36] their hair and so forth
[50:40] from this little piece of old mirror
[50:44] tacked onto a tree.
[50:47] And he goes on and says that that mirror
[50:52] was tacked onto the tree and because he
[50:54] was a kid and he was smaller,
[50:57] he used to have to step up
[51:00] on the little bench.
[51:02] Amen. To be able to see himself in the
[51:05] mirror.
[51:09] And so sometime
[51:12] in order to see yourself
[51:15] in the mirror,
[51:18] you have to
[51:20] step up.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; All right.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; Good.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Let me let me let me let me put it this
[51:26] way.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Make it
[51:31] &gt;&gt; my
[51:33] your the God you see. Let me say this.
[51:37] The God you see
[51:40] is the God you get.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; The word see in the Bible means
[51:46] understanding.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; You may have an image of God in your
[51:51] mind
[51:53] &gt;&gt; of what he is. Some place him in the uh
[51:57] effect of some old doey grandfather
[52:01] sitting and bouncing the children on his
[52:03] knee.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; Come on. Yeah. So that affects your
[52:08] perception
[52:10] &gt;&gt; of God. That's right. Amen.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; See, so my perception of God
[52:16] &gt;&gt; affects my reception
[52:19] &gt;&gt; of God.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; The way I see God doesn't change him,
[52:27] &gt;&gt; but it does impact my relationship with
[52:30] him.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:40] God's people.
[52:43] Amen. Often in religious circles, we
[52:46] create create an environment
[52:51] of pressure to act like
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; what we never become.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; You say amen.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:05] See uh uh uh
[53:08] &gt;&gt; when you're in season
[53:11] &gt;&gt; sometime we have cycles of liberation
[53:16] [Music]
[53:17] &gt;&gt; only to find out that we uh have been
[53:23] cured for a season and only to find out
[53:26] we're right back where we started from.
[53:31] Sometime
[53:34] we're in cycles.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Sometime we hate
[53:41] what we like.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; And we like what we hate.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[53:55] So, we need to quit
[53:59] what we don't want to stop
[54:02] &gt;&gt; and stop what we don't want to quit.
[54:07] [Applause]
[54:09] &gt;&gt; See, when you're passionate,
[54:12] when you're passionate about
[54:15] your relationship with God,
[54:18] you won't settle for any other
[54:20] alternate. Amen.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; In other words, when you're a part of
[54:24] the fabric,
[54:26] &gt;&gt; 99
[54:28] and a half
[54:29] &gt;&gt; just won't do.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother Jesus.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; I need to make a 100.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Cuz I want to go up
[54:38] &gt;&gt; in the first
[54:40] &gt;&gt; resurrection.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; And just because you've been dealing
[54:45] with something most of your life,
[54:48] &gt;&gt; come on. Come on. doesn't mean that you
[54:51] have to deal with it all of your life.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; Science tells me that a object in motion
[55:02] &gt;&gt; remains in motion
[55:04] &gt;&gt; till an outside force
[55:08] &gt;&gt; stops it.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Jesus is that force.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; See, a cycle is always evolving. It sort
[55:19] of feeds on its own energy,
[55:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[55:23] &gt;&gt; It's up and it's down.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; And because of the way it's made, it
[55:28] just comes back around and it's up
[55:31] &gt;&gt; and it's down.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; How many seen the little science thing
[55:35] where you have the two balls and the
[55:37] thing there and it just long once you
[55:39] get it going,
[55:41] &gt;&gt; it'll just keep going
[55:44] &gt;&gt; until
[55:46] somebody stops it. Cuz sometime we find
[55:50] ourselves in situations that we're in
[55:53] cycles
[55:58] &gt;&gt; and we need
[56:00] a supernatural force
[56:04] &gt;&gt; to stop it.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:11] So we see here
[56:14] that God is a God of alterations.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:19] And sometime
[56:23] we can't be altered.
[56:28] A l t
[56:31] e r e d.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Without the altar.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; A l t a r.
[56:40] [Music]
[56:42] &gt;&gt; See, when we look into that mirror, we
[56:44] step up on the podium.
[56:46] Good, brother.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; The altar.
[56:53] Amen. And we check the right side, the
[56:57] left side, and that mirror has a way
[56:58] that you could even see the back.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; And you say to yourself,
[57:06] &gt;&gt; "What did I miss?"
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Cuz Lord, I want to be right.
[57:13] I want to be to look good for my
[57:16] husband.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; Everything has to be just right. But now
[57:22] when you find that uh something is just
[57:24] not quite right
[57:27] &gt;&gt; and you know it's not quite right, what
[57:29] do you do? You go to the seamstress
[57:33] &gt;&gt; and say, "Fix this."
[57:36] [Applause]
[57:41] So now you have to go where
[57:44] &gt;&gt; to the a t a e r
[57:49] &gt;&gt; to get a l t e r d.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; We can't get altered
[58:00] &gt;&gt; without the altar.
[58:06] And so many times we find that people
[58:08] run from
[58:10] &gt;&gt; the altar.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; We feel that we can just do it
[58:16] ourselves.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Well, maybe I can put a stitch or so in
[58:22] this. No,
[58:25] &gt;&gt; you need to go back to the seamstress.
[58:28] That's right.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; In other words, you need to go to the
[58:33] altar
[58:35] &gt;&gt; because something situation we find
[58:37] ourself inh.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; It needs supernatural work.
[58:45] [Applause]
[58:46] &gt;&gt; As human beings and scientists, we we we
[58:49] find ourselves. We're very smart people.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; My God,
[58:52] &gt;&gt; very wise people in this age. And we
[58:55] have all we have things we have
[58:57] counselors and we have self-help books
[58:59] and we have all of these things and a
[59:01] lot of times I can fix it myself.
[59:07] You are trying to bypass the door.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; And you find yourself getting free
[59:20] &gt;&gt; for a season,
[59:23] &gt;&gt; only to find yourself back,
[59:25] &gt;&gt; my Lord,
[59:26] &gt;&gt; where you started from.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; You're in a cycle.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Lord, exactly right, brother.
[59:34] Tell your neighbor, God is a cycle
[59:36] breaker.
[59:39] [Music]
[59:44] &gt;&gt; God will break disciples
[59:48] &gt;&gt; in your life.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Now, the scripture here that I read
[59:56] was talking about
[59:59] worship. Now, I did a little research
[1:00:01] and the first place in the Bible
[1:00:05] that I ever find a call worship
[1:00:10] was in Genesis 22
[1:00:14] when Abraham
[1:00:17] had to sacrifice
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; his only son,
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; not his only son, his promised son.
[1:00:30] I'm going to read a little from there
[1:00:34] from 22
[1:00:39] Genesis 22
[1:00:43] uh
[1:00:50] I guess the second verse.
[1:00:53] And he said, "Take now thy son
[1:00:59] thine only son Isaac
[1:01:03] whom thou love.
[1:01:08] See,
[1:01:12] Abraham was in a place of tempting
[1:01:17] and he told him to take that thing
[1:01:21] that he loved
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; and sacrifice it
[1:01:28] upon the altar.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; The A L
[1:01:34] T A Right.
[1:01:39] sacrifice it,
[1:01:42] told him to get rid of it.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Now, I can only imagine that was pretty
[1:01:48] confusing.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Lord, you I you promised
[1:01:52] for all these years and now you tell me
[1:01:55] to sacrifice him.
[1:01:59] But Abraham was obedient.
[1:02:04] So Abraham rose early in the morning and
[1:02:06] saddled his ass and took two of his
[1:02:09] young men with him
[1:02:12] and Isaac his son
[1:02:17] and clave the wood from the burnt
[1:02:21] orphaning and rose up and went into the
[1:02:24] place
[1:02:25] which God had told him.
[1:02:30] I hope you in the place God told you
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; because see unless you're in the place
[1:02:37] God told you
[1:02:41] the miracle can't happen.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:48] Then on the third day Abraham lifted up
[1:02:50] his eyes and saw the place a far off.
[1:02:53] And Abraham said unto the young men,
[1:02:54] "Abide ye here
[1:02:59] with the ass, and I and the lad will go
[1:03:04] up yonder
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; and worship
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; and come again."
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; He that worship him
[1:03:16] must worship him
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; in spirit and in truth.
[1:03:21] Abraham didn't go up there and take an
[1:03:25] instrument
[1:03:26] and start singing and shouting.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; He went up to do the will
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; of the Lord.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; But the scripture says he went up to
[1:03:38] worship.
[1:03:42] So he got up there and uh
[1:03:49] Abraham
[1:03:52] built the altar.
[1:03:55] He laid the wood in order,
[1:03:58] bound Isaac,
[1:04:01] his son, and laid him on the altar
[1:04:07] upon the wood.
[1:04:09] That thing that he loved,
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; he was willing
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; to sacrifice it.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz God said so.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; So, we know the story.
[1:04:30] Abraham
[1:04:31] drew back his hand to slay the son. And
[1:04:35] the angel of the Lord called unto him
[1:04:38] out of heaven and said,"Abraham,
[1:04:39] Abraham,
[1:04:42] here am I." See, when you when you take
[1:04:45] that thing that you love to hate,
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; but you hate to love
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; and you sacrifice it upon the altar,
[1:04:59] he'll talk to you too
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; and say, "I am here."
[1:05:04] Sometime we feel so far from God
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; that we are so far from God that he
[1:05:09] can't hear our
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; cry.
[1:05:13] But if you get beside yourself
[1:05:18] and you get to a place where Lord I want
[1:05:22] to do your will
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; and you know inside eternally inside of
[1:05:28] you that the things that you love
[1:05:35] but you know that these things are wrong
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; but you don't want to
[1:05:42] That's right.
[1:05:45] [Applause]
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Because you love it.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we have to go to the altar.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; And lay these things upon the altar.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; And in process of doing so,
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; yes,
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; he'll speak to you and say, "Now I am
[1:06:08] here." Yes.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; See, you have to you have to get beside
[1:06:12] yourself
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; and lay ourselves on the altar of
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; self sacrifice.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; So, want to be free
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; of these things that perpetuate
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; these cycles in our lives.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[1:06:35] You have to lay them
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; on the altar.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Now, a cycle
[1:06:46] is when a person is in a pattern
[1:06:51] of destructive behavior,
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:06:58] where I said you experience
[1:07:01] a season of liberation only to find
[1:07:04] yourself right back in to captivity.
[1:07:08] The Bible offers us some insight
[1:07:13] into this situation. See, there was a
[1:07:17] woman
[1:07:19] who needed some alterations.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; There was a woman down in Samaria,
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:07:27] that uh needed some alterations. See,
[1:07:31] she was in a cycle
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; and she needed a cycle breaker.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:07:46] most people would look at this woman at
[1:07:49] the well
[1:07:52] and said
[1:07:54] she have a relationship problem.
[1:07:58] Let me let me lay this down first.
[1:08:04] John 4.
[1:08:09] I guess I'll start there at the fourth.
[1:08:13] Jesus said he must needs to go through
[1:08:16] Samaria. Now,
[1:08:19] he could have went up another way along
[1:08:21] the coast there.
[1:08:27] That was the way of the good Samaritan.
[1:08:32] The young man
[1:08:34] uh that was robbed
[1:08:37] and beat up and left half dead.
[1:08:42] And they took him, the good Samaritan
[1:08:45] took him
[1:08:47] to the inkeeper.
[1:08:51] He said, "Fix him. take care of him and
[1:08:55] I'll pay you
[1:08:57] later.
[1:08:59] Amen.
[1:09:01] But she went to this place
[1:09:04] uh Christ went to the place there in
[1:09:06] Samaria
[1:09:09] then cometh to the city of Samaria which
[1:09:11] is called
[1:09:13] Saikar.
[1:09:15] Now I looked up Saikar
[1:09:18] and when I looked at the definition of
[1:09:20] Saikar as just a bad place in the city
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; and folks he care about Riviera Beach
[1:09:27] just as much as he care about Wellington
[1:09:30] [Applause]
[1:09:33] [Music]
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; maybe there's someone
[1:09:38] there
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; sitting on a whale
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; who needs cycles to be broken in their
[1:09:46] lives.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; True. So we don't avoid that's what if
[1:09:51] you read the definition of psychology
[1:09:53] it's a it's the older bad place there
[1:09:58] not saying river is a bad place but it
[1:10:01] has that stigma
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; back when I was a teenager
[1:10:07] raw ver
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; yeah I got somebody attention then
[1:10:15] they know about raw
[1:10:17] [Laughter]
[1:10:20] So, uh,
[1:10:22] they were near the parcel of ground that
[1:10:24] Jacob
[1:10:26] gave to his son Joseph.
[1:10:29] Now, Jacob,
[1:10:33] Jacob's whale was there. Jesus therefore
[1:10:37] being wearied in his journey,
[1:10:40] sat thus on the whale,
[1:10:44] and it was about the sixth hour. There
[1:10:46] cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water.
[1:10:49] Jesus said unto her, "Give me a drink."
[1:10:57] For his disciples were gone away into
[1:11:00] the city to by me.
[1:11:04] Then saith the woman of Samaria unto
[1:11:06] him,
[1:11:08] How is it that thou being a Jew
[1:11:13] as of me
[1:11:17] which am a woman of Samaria?
[1:11:20] The Jews have no dealings with
[1:11:22] Samaritans.
[1:11:26] Amen.
[1:11:28] In other words,
[1:11:30] she probably just come down there with
[1:11:32] her rollers in her hair,
[1:11:34] paint the picture.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:38] I'm just coming to get me some water.
[1:11:41] Don't bother me.
[1:11:45] I don't even feel like being bothered.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; But she needed
[1:11:53] some cycles to be broken. That's right.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Now, I said that, you know,
[1:11:59] Christ was talking to her
[1:12:02] just to pick up her spirit.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; See, if you're going to talk to
[1:12:07] somebody, first you have to kind of find
[1:12:09] out where they're at.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; You don't just come and just throw the
[1:12:14] Bible at them.
[1:12:16] So in other words,
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; what Jesus was doing,
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; he was diagnosing
[1:12:26] her problem.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; Like I said before that many would have
[1:12:32] thought that well
[1:12:35] she has a problem with relationships.
[1:12:41] She may have a a problem. Amen.
[1:12:46] With a a lust problem
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; on the outside looking like looks like
[1:12:53] what it is.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; So Jesus here uh uh diagnosing her.
[1:13:05] In order to break the cycle,
[1:13:08] you have to get to the root cause
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; of the issue.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; Because if you just sit down and take
[1:13:18] her to the marriage counselor or the
[1:13:21] psychiatrist to find out why she keep
[1:13:23] getting these wrong men,
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; they're going to fix the symptom. Right.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; But never got down to the root of the
[1:13:34] problem.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; So
[1:13:42] Jesus answered and said unto her,
[1:13:46] Amen. Let me back up. The woman said to
[1:13:48] him
[1:13:53] unto him, "Sir, thou have nothing to
[1:13:57] draw with, and the well is deep
[1:14:01] from whence from then uh from whence
[1:14:04] then hast thou
[1:14:06] that living water?
[1:14:12] Art thou greater than our
[1:14:16] father Jacob,
[1:14:18] which gave us the well to drink thereof
[1:14:22] himself and his children and his cattle?
[1:14:28] Jesus answered and said unto her,
[1:14:30] "Whosoever drinkketh of this water
[1:14:34] shall never thirst again."
[1:14:37] Now he's getting her attention.
[1:14:41] I hope I got your attention this
[1:14:42] morning.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; So
[1:14:49] that I shall give him
[1:14:53] I'm sorry. Whosoever drinkketh this
[1:14:55] water shall never thirst again. But
[1:14:56] whosoever drinkketh of this water
[1:14:59] that I shall give them
[1:15:01] shall never thirst.
[1:15:03] But the water that I shall give them
[1:15:06] shall be in him a well of water
[1:15:11] springing up
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; unto everlasting life.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Now see the woman saith unto him, "Sir,
[1:15:20] give me this water."
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; that I thirst not,
[1:15:28] neither come hither to draw. Jesus said
[1:15:31] unto her, "Go call thy husband."
[1:15:36] See, surgery was starting to happen.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; "Go call thy husband,
[1:15:43] and come hither."
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; The woman answered and said, "I have no
[1:15:47] husband." Jesus said unto her, "Thou has
[1:15:50] said, thou has well said,
[1:15:54] I have no husband,
[1:15:56] for thou has had five husbands,
[1:16:01] and he whom thou hast is now thy
[1:16:06] husband."
[1:16:08] And oh, I'm sorry. And he whom thou h
[1:16:12] thou now has is not thy husband.
[1:16:20] And that saidest thou truly. The woman
[1:16:24] said unto him, "Sir, I perceive you to
[1:16:28] be a prophet." Now, now, now, now I want
[1:16:30] you to notice something.
[1:16:32] First, he was, "Man, leave me alone."
[1:16:38] But after he began,
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; he first diagnosed her situation.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; And then he began
[1:16:49] to feed her the inoculation in pieces.
[1:16:56] So now we begin to see
[1:17:01] her eyes becoming open. First he was a
[1:17:04] man.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Now she says, "I perceive you to be a
[1:17:10] prophet."
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; So we getting somewhere.
[1:17:16] Now
[1:17:18] [Applause]
[1:17:23] our fathers worship
[1:17:26] in this mountain. And ye say that in
[1:17:30] Jerusalem is this place where men ought
[1:17:34] to worship.
[1:17:36] Jesus Jesus saith unto her,"Woman,
[1:17:39] believe me, the hour cometh,
[1:17:44] when ye shall neither in this mountain,
[1:17:48] nor yet at Jerusalem worship the
[1:17:52] Father." Now we back at our text. Ye
[1:17:55] worship and ye know not what
[1:18:01] we know that the worship uh we know now
[1:18:05] that we worship and salvation is of the
[1:18:08] Jews. But the hour cometh and now is
[1:18:14] when the true worshippers shall worship
[1:18:15] the Father in spirit and in truth. For
[1:18:20] the Father seeketh such to worship him.
[1:18:24] So God is a spirit and he that worship
[1:18:27] him must worship him in spirit and in
[1:18:30] truth. The woman said unto him,
[1:18:34] I know that the Messiah cometh,
[1:18:38] which is called Christ,
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; when he is come,
[1:18:43] he will tell us all things.
[1:18:48] Jesus said to the woman,
[1:18:52] "I that speak unto thee
[1:18:56] am he."
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; she he was a man
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; at the well,
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Then he became, "Sir, I perceive you to
[1:19:12] be a prophet."
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; To the Messiah. Yes, sir.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; See, so her problem
[1:19:22] wasn't a relationship problem.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Her problem wasn't the fact that she had
[1:19:28] five husbands. Her problem was a lack of
[1:19:33] understanding.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Her problem was a lack of revelation.
[1:19:38] Yes, sir.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Her problem was that he hadn't come into
[1:19:42] the presence of almighty God.
[1:19:47] So the cycle was perpetuated. Amen. And
[1:19:51] going from man to man to man to man. And
[1:19:55] that wasn't her problem. Her only
[1:19:57] problem was that she needed to know who
[1:19:59] Jesus was.
[1:20:04] [Applause]
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; That was the thing that broke the cycle.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Then all of a sudden, she dropped her
[1:20:12] pot.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[1:20:15] And she ran into the city.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Saying, "Come see a man
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; thank you."
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Can I paraphrase him?
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Who broke the cycles.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; Come see a man.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Who delivered me from the cycle that I
[1:20:32] couldn't get out of.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Come see a man
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; who told me about all my problems.
[1:20:42] Amen.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; At that point,
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; her garment was altered
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; in the presence
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; of the Lord.
[1:20:53] [Applause]
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; See, she came to the w to the well
[1:20:58] thirsty,
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; for water.
[1:21:03] Now, I looked into this a little bit.
[1:21:07] And when you're thirsty,
[1:21:10] Amen. Thirst is just a form of
[1:21:14] dehydration.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; And uh
[1:21:23] the first symptom
[1:21:26] of feeling thirsty
[1:21:28] may be a little dry mouth
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; and uh slightly fatigued. Mhm.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; You might also notice
[1:21:38] uh some changes in uh your bodily
[1:21:42] fluids.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Now, with that first stage of
[1:21:46] dehydration, you might realize you're
[1:21:48] thirsty
[1:21:50] and just say, "I need a glass of water."
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; And a glass of water might suffice that.
[1:22:01] Now you go and get this bottle water
[1:22:02] that we have today
[1:22:05] and it don't do it like that real water
[1:22:08] cuz see science have discovered
[1:22:11] that what we need
[1:22:14] is water
[1:22:17] with things like potassium.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; In other words, we need living water
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; to hydrate.
[1:22:29] That second
[1:22:31] stage of dehydration
[1:22:35] you again the symptoms of dizziness,
[1:22:39] lightadedness,
[1:22:41] but this one may have some elements of
[1:22:44] rapid heartbeat.
[1:22:46] Amen. Now the bodily functions
[1:22:50] uh begin to decrease.
[1:22:54] So now it's affecting
[1:22:56] uh uh uh uh uh your body.
[1:23:00] Amen.
[1:23:03] If you ignore that first stage of
[1:23:06] dehydration,
[1:23:08] science tells us that if you're already
[1:23:10] thirsty, if you wait until thirst comes,
[1:23:13] you're already dehydrated. In that first
[1:23:15] stage,
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; you have to stay
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; hydrated.
[1:23:21] That's right.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; You have to stay hydrated with living
[1:23:24] water.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Goes on to that third stage,
[1:23:30] Amen. of dehydration.
[1:23:34] Now that third stage of dehydration,
[1:23:38] Amen. You have the same as the other
[1:23:39] ones. The lightadedness, rapid
[1:23:42] heartbeat,
[1:23:44] Amen.
[1:23:46] Not sweating.
[1:23:48] Amen.
[1:23:50] continued fluid loss,
[1:23:55] you going to need more than just a drink
[1:23:56] of water.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; If that third stage of dehydration set
[1:24:01] in,
[1:24:03] you going to need a medical
[1:24:04] professional.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; You're going to need somebody to come
[1:24:10] and give you an IV.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; See, now it's not so see because you
[1:24:15] ignore that thirst. Come my mighty Lord.
[1:24:17] You ignore that thirst the first time.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; And then you ignore that thirst the
[1:24:24] second time.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; That third time you begin to get
[1:24:28] confused.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. I've
[1:24:33] experienced firsthand that level of
[1:24:37] dehydration.
[1:24:39] I was working outside
[1:24:41] and
[1:24:43] being electrician, I'm working on a
[1:24:44] light pole and this light pole had about
[1:24:47] eight different fixtures on it. I had to
[1:24:50] bring it down and I had to replace all
[1:24:52] of the lights
[1:24:54] and it happened to be that uh uh uh
[1:24:57] there was trees all around me. There was
[1:25:00] just a little spot in the midst of a
[1:25:02] bunch of trees that I can work on the
[1:25:05] lights. So there was no breeze,
[1:25:09] nothing but heat.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Hot. Lord,
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; I'm just sweating, but I want to get
[1:25:15] this done. So I'm working on the first
[1:25:19] light.
[1:25:20] No problem. Disco here, disco there,
[1:25:23] disco there. I had to rewire the
[1:25:25] ballast. Didn't put the light in. Hold
[1:25:28] on, y'all. So I'm just working. First
[1:25:30] one done. Take get down, get off my
[1:25:33] ladder, go up. Second one done. By the
[1:25:37] time I got to
[1:25:39] say the fifth light now, there was eight
[1:25:42] on this what we call high mass pole.
[1:25:47] By the time I got to that fifth fixture,
[1:25:50] I had totally forgot how to do it.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; I just did five.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; But by the time I got to that next one,
[1:26:01] I was totally confused.
[1:26:03] sitting there looking at the wires not
[1:26:05] knowing what to do with them.
[1:26:08] Recognize that something ain't right.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; So I got my and see the dangerous part
[1:26:14] of it that I was in a am I could have
[1:26:16] fell out and nobody knew. They wouldn't
[1:26:18] have realized it until I didn't show up
[1:26:19] to clock out.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Where is he? I'm in there laid out.
[1:26:27] Somebody come get me and take me to the
[1:26:30] end keeper.
[1:26:33] But I realized, so I got myself down off
[1:26:35] the ladder and I
[1:26:38] went through the trees. My truck was
[1:26:40] parked right there. And luckily, I had
[1:26:42] fixed myself a large cooler uh uh uh uh
[1:26:47] with ice and Gatorade.
[1:26:50] And I grabbed my cup and I filled it up
[1:26:53] and I went sat in the truck, cranked the
[1:26:55] truck truck up and turned the air
[1:26:57] condition on high
[1:26:59] and drank
[1:27:01] my Gatorade.
[1:27:03] So when I got myself just a little
[1:27:04] cooled off, I went back and I did
[1:27:07] another fixture, no problem. But by the
[1:27:10] time I got to the other fixture, I was
[1:27:14] confused again.
[1:27:17] And I went back to my truck, sat in
[1:27:20] there for about 30, 40 minutes,
[1:27:23] took my time, went back and I was able
[1:27:25] to finish job just like that.
[1:27:28] But I had got to that point of dehy just
[1:27:32] before that point of deh dehydration
[1:27:34] where I were going to need some medical
[1:27:35] attention. But even in that form, that
[1:27:38] place of dehydration,
[1:27:41] it didn't take me long to get back into
[1:27:45] emergency situation.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Soon as I went back, I had just enough
[1:27:53] oil.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; But I didn't have enough oil
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; in my lamp
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; to finish the job. Glory to God.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; I had just enough
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; to get to the next fixture.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; So that dehydration,
[1:28:16] this woman at the well,
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; probably was thirsty,
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; but a lot of times she was drinking the
[1:28:28] wrong water.
[1:28:31] And we may get a little bit of freedom,
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; but not enough oil.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; In our lamb
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; to take us all the way through the
[1:28:44] journey.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; See, it goes back to the first part of
[1:28:47] what I was talking about.
[1:28:50] You may be a that that that that pattern
[1:28:54] and that remnant of that pattern
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; was cause was called the foolish virgin.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Now see they were all virgin and holy
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; good people because they are cut from
[1:29:11] the original pattern.
[1:29:14] But that pattern,
[1:29:17] that fabric
[1:29:19] that was cut,
[1:29:22] Amen. from that pattern,
[1:29:25] that group was called the five wise
[1:29:27] version.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; And see, they had just enough
[1:29:35] oil for themselves.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. But that foolish version,
[1:29:41] you see, because they didn't have enough
[1:29:43] oil, they had to keep uhh they went to
[1:29:47] the uh wise version say, "Give us some
[1:29:49] of your oil."
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; And they say, "I had just enough
[1:29:55] to keep myself hydrated
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; so that I can get to the end of my
[1:30:02] journey."
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; See, you're going to have to have enough
[1:30:06] for yourself. All right.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; If mama won't go,
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; all right,
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; I got to have enough for myself.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; If children won't go,
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; I got to have enough
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; for myself.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; If my friend won't go,
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; I got to have enough
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; for myself.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; You got to have enough oil
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; in your lamp.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. for yourself.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; So we see here that this uh Samaritan
[1:30:42] woman
[1:30:43] what was keeping her
[1:30:46] is she was drinking of the wrong water.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; It'll only last for a season.
[1:30:53] It gave her enough to make her feel good
[1:30:57] upon her flesh
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; because it says that they they were good
[1:31:03] and holy,
[1:31:05] sanctified, justified.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Feel the presence of God.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; But it's just enough water
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; to get to the next fixture. Then you got
[1:31:16] to go back. See, there was in a cycle.
[1:31:21] Yes, sir.
[1:31:24] So when you begin to break these cycles,
[1:31:28] she had to understand
[1:31:31] in the presence of God
[1:31:34] who he was
[1:31:38] because what she was drinking of would
[1:31:40] not suffice her through the end of the
[1:31:43] journey.
[1:31:45] Now, if you don't have enough water to
[1:31:47] take you through the end of the journey,
[1:31:50] you'll have to come up in the second
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; resurrection.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; So, my point today
[1:32:05] is while you can,
[1:32:10] the altar
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; is ready for you.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:32:16] Now, I'm I I I want you to know that any
[1:32:20] Abraham had to go to a place
[1:32:23] and make an altar.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Find you an altar.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; The altar upon your heart. And everybody
[1:32:34] come to a place in their life where they
[1:32:37] have a me moment.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; I may not know you.
[1:32:44] I may not know the secret things of your
[1:32:46] heart.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; I might not know the cycles that you're
[1:32:49] going through.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; I may not know, but I know someone who
[1:32:53] does.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; And he coming to your well
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; to give you a drink of water.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; That you'll never thirst again.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; That you'll never thirst again. I am
[1:33:12] Jesus.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; You see,
[1:33:16] you have to step yourself upon that
[1:33:18] altar
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; and ask yourself,
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; "What did I miss?"
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Are your garments sparkling?
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Are they white as snow?
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Are you washed
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; in the blood of the lamb? Amen.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Are you washed?
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; in the blood of the lamb.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Many times,
[1:33:51] Amen. we find oursself
[1:33:53] just comfortable
[1:33:55] in the cycle of religion.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Try to get you to the next fixture.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; But it won't get the whole job done.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; I just got to be honest with you.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Yep. It'll get you to the next fixture,
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; but we want to go all the way to the
[1:34:16] end.
[1:34:17] Amen. We want to make sure that our
[1:34:20] garment is just right.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. The musicians, come stand to our
[1:34:25] feet.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:32] [Applause]
[1:34:36] See, uh,
[1:34:38] I don't been through enough trials
[1:34:40] myself to play church.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; It's God's grace and mercy
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; that brought me this far.
[1:34:53] many years ago
[1:34:56] when we were coming up in church and as
[1:35:00] just young children basically.
[1:35:05] Amen. We didn't have an understanding of
[1:35:07] these things.
[1:35:10] But the Lord has blessed us
[1:35:14] to have a true understanding
[1:35:17] of the gospel.
[1:35:19] Now, it ain't bragging when it's true.
[1:35:24] It ain't bragging when it's true
[1:35:28] and I'll stand on it.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; I'll hang my soul on it.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; See, there's a different kind of word
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; that'll get you in the first
[1:35:40] resurrection.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; And I thank God
[1:35:45] that I'm a part of that pattern.
[1:35:49] It was by his divine election that he
[1:35:52] chose me.
[1:35:54] And it's by his divine election
[1:35:57] that he chose you.
[1:36:00] And I know many are just running.
[1:36:03] But see
[1:36:05] that pattern
[1:36:07] that he laid out on that fabric,
[1:36:13] he saw in his mind before the foundation
[1:36:16] of the world.
[1:36:17] [Music]
[1:36:19] And his mind, his thoughts are perfect.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; And he say not a one
[1:36:26] of mine will be lost.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Now you can run,
[1:36:32] but you can't hide.
[1:36:35] He will run you down.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; See, that's why you can't look at your
[1:36:40] friends.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; You can't look at other people around
[1:36:44] you.
[1:36:46] It's me, Lord. Yeah.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; See, he may not be dealing with them
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; the same way he's dealing with you.
[1:36:55] [Music]
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; That woman had a problem.
[1:37:02] No doubt that she wanted to be free.
[1:37:06] Tried to diagnose herself and was at her
[1:37:09] wit's end.
[1:37:13] Caught in that cycle.
[1:37:15] She needed a cycle breaker
[1:37:19] and Jesus this morning is that cycle
[1:37:21] breaker.
[1:37:23] [Music]
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's pray.
[1:37:29] Dear God,
[1:37:31] our heavenly father,
[1:37:35] Lord,
[1:37:36] you are the ruler of everything,
[1:37:40] [Music]
[1:37:41] the king of our thoughts.
[1:37:46] uh our peace,
[1:37:49] our comforter.
[1:37:52] Lord God, you know each one of us by
[1:37:55] name. Scripture says you can count the
[1:37:59] numbers of hairs on our head.
[1:38:03] You know the things that we struggle
[1:38:06] with in our secret place.
[1:38:09] Those things that we just don't talk
[1:38:11] about with nobody else.
[1:38:16] Lord, may we go into that secret garden,
[1:38:18] oh Father God, and just commune with
[1:38:21] you.
[1:38:24] And Lord, may the cycles
[1:38:27] be broken this day.
[1:38:31] This day, Lord.
[1:38:34] Jesus, you're passing this way.
[1:38:37] Lord, we had no idea
[1:38:41] of who was going to be here.
[1:38:44] Lord God, this morning, oh Father God,
[1:38:46] those that you have here, oh Father God,
[1:38:48] I believe you spoke to somebody's heart,
[1:38:53] somebody
[1:38:54] needs the garment altered, Lord, may we
[1:38:57] willingly
[1:38:59] come to the altar to be made over. Lord,
[1:39:04] like Jesus, you had said you had a need
[1:39:08] to go to Samaria.
[1:39:10] Lord, she no doubt pulled on your
[1:39:13] heartstring
[1:39:14] [Music]
[1:39:16] to because she's a part of that original
[1:39:18] fabric, Lord.
[1:39:21] Lord, we ask you, oh Father God, to
[1:39:23] bless those that hear hear the word.
[1:39:26] Lord God, meet them at the point of
[1:39:28] their need, oh Father, give them
[1:39:31] strength and courage, oh Father God, to
[1:39:33] say, Lord, what must I do to gain
[1:39:36] eternal life, Lord? Lord to be a part of
[1:39:39] that first resurrection.
[1:39:44] Now Lord as we prepare amen to leave
[1:39:47] this place but never your presence be
[1:39:48] with us throughout the day
[1:39:51] Lord we thank you for all things Jesus
[1:39:55] name I pray. Amen. Brother Solomon
[1:40:07] [Music]
[1:40:13] [Music]
[1:40:14] Praise the Lord. How many appreciate
[1:40:16] this the message this morning?
[1:40:19] Amen.
[1:40:23] Amen. How many wants to be altered?
[1:40:26] I know I do. I need help. I look at my
[1:40:29] life daily and I see my faults.
[1:40:35] I know I need Jesus.
[1:40:42] We all have our battles.
[1:40:45] Nobody perfect.
[1:40:48] We all going to meet Satan daily.
[1:40:51] He's going to fight. He's going to point
[1:40:53] you at your faults. He wants to keep you
[1:40:55] away from the Lord. So, he's going to
[1:40:58] tell you you're not good enough.
[1:41:01] You'll never be good enough. But I'm so
[1:41:03] glad Jesus said, "Come as you are." If
[1:41:06] you come as you are, he'll meet you
[1:41:08] right at the point of your need. Amen.
[1:41:10] Let's sing this song together before we
[1:41:12] leave.
[1:41:14] [Music]
[1:41:16] Pass
[1:41:18] me not, oh gentle Savior,
[1:41:26] hear
[1:41:28] my heart, oh cry,
[1:41:36] bow
[1:41:38] on others, thou are glory.
[1:41:45] Oh, do
[1:41:47] not pass
[1:41:49] it by.
[1:41:53] I'm crying. Saveior,
[1:41:59] Savior,
[1:42:04] hear my humble
[1:42:08] cry.
[1:42:12] Oh, and while
[1:42:16] others thou are calling
[1:42:23] do

[1:46:02] Do
[1:46:04] not pass
[1:46:07] me by.
[1:46:13] Thank you, Lord.
[1:46:16] Praise the Lord. Let's bow our heads.
[1:46:20] Heavenly Father, we thank you so much,
[1:46:23] Lord, for such a simple message, Lord,
[1:46:26] that you deliver to us today.
[1:46:30] We thank you, Lord God, that your
[1:46:31] servant was able to get himself out of
[1:46:33] the way, that you were able to speak
[1:46:36] through him to our hearts, Lord.
[1:46:39] Father, we all need to be altered, Lord
[1:46:41] Jesus. We can look in the mirror daily,
[1:46:44] Lord, and see so many faults, Lord.
[1:46:48] Father, a person looks in the mirror to
[1:46:50] see what's wrong, Lord, and they believe
[1:46:52] what was in that mirror because what the
[1:46:55] mirror is reflecting is the truth,
[1:47:00] Father. That mirror is not lying to us,
[1:47:02] Lord Jesus. It's telling us exactly
[1:47:04] what's wrong. It's seeing something that
[1:47:06] we don't see.
[1:47:08] So, Father, as we look in the mirror of
[1:47:10] your word, Lord Jesus, we can look and
[1:47:13] see. Oh, Lord, I'm not where I'm
[1:47:15] supposed to be. Father, you brought me
[1:47:18] from a mighty long way, but I'm not what
[1:47:20] I'm supposed to be yet. And Lord God, we
[1:47:23] know that we need to be altered, Lord
[1:47:25] God. Sometime a a high temper, Lord
[1:47:28] Jesus. Sometime, Lord, I I want to watch
[1:47:31] TV too much. Lord, I need these things
[1:47:34] altered. And sometimes, Lord, it's not
[1:47:36] necessarily sin.
[1:47:38] But it's a wait,
[1:47:40] Father, it's getting in our way, Lord
[1:47:42] Jesus, of our time alone with you. Our
[1:47:45] time of worship, Lord. Lord, we need to
[1:47:48] be more in prayer, Lord God. We can we
[1:47:50] can sing too much, Lord. We can we can
[1:47:52] talk too much, Lord, but we can never
[1:47:54] pray too much.
[1:47:57] So, Father God, continue to deal with
[1:47:58] our hearts and lives, Lord. We want to
[1:48:00] be in the image of our Lord Jesus. We
[1:48:03] want oil in our lamps, Lord God. Father,
[1:48:06] so that we can make it in that first
[1:48:08] resurrection and rapture. Lord, Father,
[1:48:10] we're ready to go home. We see Israel in
[1:48:13] their homeland. The gospel is getting
[1:48:15] ready to go back to them and war to the
[1:48:18] Gentiles that are without the door. When
[1:48:20] the gospel goes back to the Jews, there
[1:48:22] won't be one more saved. So, while
[1:48:25] you're passing by, Lord Jesus,
[1:48:28] save your children. You promise you'll
[1:48:31] never lose one. Father, as we prepare to
[1:48:34] leave this place, but never your
[1:48:36] presence, Lord, be with your children,
[1:48:38] Lord. Grant traveling mercies to each
[1:48:40] one, all of our brothers and sisters
[1:48:42] that'll be traveling back, Lord, from
[1:48:44] this from from this holiday weekend.
[1:48:46] Lord, be with them. Keep us all safe and
[1:48:50] out of harm's way. Lord, bring us all
[1:48:52] back at the appointed time we pray. It's
[1:48:55] in Jesus Christ's name we ask it. Amen.
[1:48:58] Amen. God bless you. All may be seated
[1:49:01] and our brothers to come and dismiss you
[1:49:03] at this time.
[1:49:06] Thou are calling.
[1:49:12] Do
[1:49:14] not pass
[1:49:16] me by.
[1:49:19] I'm crying. Saveior.
[1:49:26] Saveior,
[1:49:30] hear my humble
[1:49:34] cry.
[1:49:38] Oh, and while
[1:49:41] others now are calling,
[1:49:48] do
[1:49:50] not pass
[1:49:52] me by.

[1:50:10] cry.
[1:50:14] Oh, and wow
[1:50:16] on others now for glory.

[1:50:25] not pass
[1:50:27] me by.

[1:50:45] cry
[1:50:49] and my
[1:50:51] own mothers thou are calling
[1:50:57] [Music]
