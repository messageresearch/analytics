[49:01] scriptures oh you know I done I done got
[49:03] up here and um forgot some
[49:07] things y'all bear with me one second
[49:10] amen I did want to thank the Lord for
[49:12] brother Mark on Wednesday
[49:16] night um did a wonderful job on the
[49:20] sermon get up and uh just just
[49:23] appreciate how the Lord used him and um
[49:27] uh in that uh I got a um a call
[49:32] yesterday from Sister Irma and I believe
[49:35] she is online uh watching us today she
[49:38] told me that her son Raphael and we've
[49:40] been praying for him for uh some time
[49:42] and um he he has been added to the list
[49:47] to be able to receive a kidney
[49:49] transplant praise the
[49:52] Lord and um also uh he needs a new
[49:56] pancre as well so let's continue to keep
[49:59] him in prayer we thank God for him being
[50:01] on the list uh we know how you know
[50:05] sometimes that's very difficult uh and
[50:06] so many other people are in line but
[50:08] he's on the list and just believe in God
[50:10] that he'll get this but we also know a
[50:13] God that can touch him before the
[50:16] doctor's hand touches him and give him
[50:18] two new kidneys and a new pancreas so
[50:20] let's continue to keep brother Raphael
[50:22] in prayer uh and um um don't forget that
[50:26] the skit that sister shonda's doing for
[50:28] you know for Easter I think that's going
[50:29] to be wonderful so everybody just try to
[50:32] um uh honor just uh meeting with her
[50:34] right after service and actually before
[50:36] they do that meeting I just want to have
[50:38] a brief meeting with the church right
[50:39] after uh right after service I'll just
[50:42] um just need to mention something to you
[50:45] and um and then we will move on from
[50:47] there so the Lord bless you amen the
[50:49] Lord bless you let's read amen from Joel
[50:55] our scripture
[50:57] uh for this season we are um preaching
[51:02] part four to get back in Step as I
[51:04] mentioned on last week we had a few more
[51:07] things that we wanted to share and uh
[51:09] we'll see as far as we go
[51:12] today uh
[51:13] but we trust the Lord Joel 1 and verse 4
[51:19] says that which the Palmer worm had left
[51:23] hath the Locust eaten and that which the
[51:27] Locust had left ha the korm eaten and
[51:30] that which the K the korm had left ha
[51:33] the caterpillar eaten uh but then we go
[51:36] over to chapter 2 and we just pick up
[51:39] this one verse here actually a couple
[51:43] verses I will say uh starting at verse
[51:46] 23 it says be glad then ye children of
[51:49] Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God we
[51:52] have given you the former rain
[51:53] moderately and he will cause to come
[51:55] down for you the rain the for marine and
[51:57] the ladine in the first month and the
[52:00] floors shall be full of Wheat and the
[52:03] fats uh shall overflow with wine and oil
[52:07] and I'll restore to you the years that
[52:09] the Locust ha eaten the canor and the
[52:13] caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great
[52:14] Army which I sent among
[52:16] you um and ye shall eat in
[52:20] plenty and be
[52:23] satisfied and I just love the way
[52:25] brother Troy barked that out to us eat
[52:27] in plenty and be satisfied
[52:31] and and now you got to do something if
[52:34] you eating and plenty and you're
[52:35] satisfied then there's something else
[52:36] you got to do
[52:39] and hello somebody amen praise the name
[52:43] of the Lord amen he been too good for
[52:47] you not to praise
[52:49] him been too good and praise the name of
[52:53] the Lord your God that have dealt
[52:54] wondrous with you and my people should
[52:56] never be ashamed and ye shall know that
[52:58] I am in the midst of Israel and that I
[53:00] am the Lord your God and none else and
[53:04] my people shall never be ashamed amen
[53:08] let's have a word of prayer as we um
[53:11] prepare to go into uh our thought for
[53:14] the day let's pray father we are
[53:17] grateful for the opportunity that we
[53:20] have to come into the house of the
[53:23] Lord and uh we thank you for the
[53:25] anointing that is been here thus far in
[53:28] this service as we would go deeper into
[53:32] uh this thought today God on get back in
[53:34] step and the inspiration that you've
[53:36] given us is I will restore we know in
[53:39] this season Satan going to do everything
[53:41] he can to take away but God you promised
[53:44] to restore so we are looking for your
[53:46] word to be manifested in our health in
[53:50] our Spirits amen and our
[53:53] businesses praise God and uh in our
[53:57] families Lord in every area of our of
[54:00] our life we looking for
[54:02] restoration and uh we ask God that you
[54:05] would just uh take control over this
[54:06] portion of the of the of the service
[54:09] every thought that is presented and
[54:10] every thought that is received may you
[54:13] get the glory and the honor uh out of it
[54:15] it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen God
[54:19] bless you you can be seated uh again we
[54:22] are um touching this get back
[54:27] in Step praise the Lord um and um just
[54:33] kind of as we go forward the the thought
[54:35] of this get back and step is actually
[54:37] being driven from um the this quote here
[54:43] uh number three um this quote is just
[54:46] kind of where we're getting our our um
[54:48] inspiration from so the prophet tells us
[54:52] and uh let me also just mention I I just
[54:55] kind of felt in my heart to bring this
[54:59] fourth part out of this sermon and put
[55:02] it in
[55:03] PowerPoint uh because there's some
[55:05] things that I think from a visual
[55:08] perspective if you saw it visually then
[55:11] it may begin to click and sink in a
[55:14] little bit uh for you and we um uh we we
[55:19] beaten this until we get every uh uh
[55:22] nugget out of
[55:24] it because this is so important it's not
[55:27] just um um uh something that we're
[55:30] playing games with we we're living
[55:33] this right now this scripture where
[55:36] theologians are saying they don't really
[55:39] know what it mean we're the
[55:40] manifestation of it all right so it's
[55:43] very important that we we understand
[55:45] this and brother Quinton told us
[55:47] restoration all throughout the Bible all
[55:49] throughout the Bible from when Adam and
[55:51] Eve fell in the Garden of Eden like
[55:53] thank God how brother Jerry picked that
[55:55] up you know and brought that to us and
[55:57] just real quickly God had three things
[56:01] in his mind brother brandom told us
[56:03] three things God has been trying to
[56:05] accomplish all these thousand years that
[56:08] the Earth has been in existence three
[56:10] things one uh God wanted to reveal
[56:13] himself to his people he wanted us to
[56:15] know who he was right two God wanted to
[56:19] have the preeminence in his body God
[56:21] wants to lead you God wants to guide you
[56:24] God wants to direct you God wants to sit
[56:26] on the control tower of your heart amen
[56:30] and express himself through you God
[56:34] wants to do that but you got to yield
[56:36] yourself to God to allow him to do that
[56:38] the devil don't want God to use you and
[56:41] that's why he try to block you up and
[56:43] clog you up with all kind of nonsense
[56:46] amen but God wants to use
[56:48] you not God wants to use you God want to
[56:52] use your eyes God want to use your mouth
[56:56] God want to use your hands God want to
[56:59] use your thinking God want to use your
[57:02] feet come on somebody God God I mean God
[57:06] wants you to lay hands on the sick and
[57:08] have them
[57:09] recover uh God wants you to speak the
[57:11] right word at the right time to the
[57:13] right person to bring Deliverance into
[57:15] their life God wants to use
[57:19] you I don't believe that that God died
[57:22] when brother brandom left the scene the
[57:24] same God that would tell the prophet go
[57:26] and go to this street at such and such a
[57:29] time and when he get there then somebody
[57:31] else on say the Lord told me to come to
[57:33] this street at such and such a time and
[57:35] they happen to just be walking by and
[57:37] then realize the prophet was there they
[57:38] couldn't get through the prayer line but
[57:39] hear a prophet to pray for them on the
[57:41] street yes sir that same God lives today
[57:45] and he wants to lead you and guide you
[57:47] and direct you sir put you in situations
[57:50] where he can get glory for
[57:52] himself God wants to use you three is
[57:55] that he wanted to take back or restore
[57:57] us back to edting conditions again so
[58:01] here let's follow this um and this
[58:04] sermon proving his word brother random
[58:06] say he proves his word in every age by
[58:11] the most unusual way but he always does
[58:15] it in the same way catch these things
[58:18] now he he proves this word in every age
[58:21] by the most unusual way but he always
[58:24] does it in the same way way now when he
[58:27] say it doesn't the same way that means
[58:28] he always sends a prophet to the people
[58:31] right says what did he do in the days of
[58:33] Noah he sent a prophet right uh when
[58:36] he's fixing to deliver the remnant he
[58:38] sent them Noah the prophet Glory he sent
[58:43] Noah a sign and now notice when he come
[58:46] to deliver the children of Israel what
[58:48] does he do he his same way he sends a
[58:51] prophet Moses was the prophet that went
[58:53] to the children of Israel his prophet
[58:55] got His prophets got the word amen the
[58:59] signs and wonders of the word promise
[59:03] backs it up now let me let me let me let
[59:06] me um I'm going come to that in a second
[59:09] that's is that's that's uh that's it's
[59:11] exactly the truth Israel made a p March
[59:13] to the promised land because they
[59:14] believed it but stay right there the
[59:16] signs and wonders of the word promise
[59:19] backs it up right uh and I I I just
[59:22] mentioned this recently I was um uh
[59:25] talking about the uh Church age book
[59:27] there are some people that have pulled
[59:28] away from the message because it said
[59:30] brother brandom's Church age book looks
[59:32] just like um uh Charles lens's book and
[59:35] uh Charles Lin is a man that wrote a
[59:37] number of things of what he saw in the
[59:39] church ages and and and uh you know and
[59:41] he outlined it a certain way but his
[59:44] Revelation was not the same as brother
[59:45] Brandon I can tell you that right now
[59:47] even if he got part of it right ain't
[59:49] nothing wrong with having you know that
[59:51] uh we we brother brandom said many he
[59:53] says I just came to tith of the Lucin
[59:57] they had truth they wasn't false they
[59:59] had the truth but they was missing just
[1:00:02] certain components so one thing I know
[1:00:04] Charles Lin did not have who was the
[1:00:06] seven Church age messenger he didn't
[1:00:09] have that one right so so so so uh so
[1:00:12] when we look at things like that we
[1:00:13] don't we and and here's the other thing
[1:00:15] I I I asked the question did when
[1:00:17] Charles Lin wrote his book that might
[1:00:19] and I I've never read the book but
[1:00:21] others say they read it look just like
[1:00:22] the church A's book evidently you ain't
[1:00:24] read the whole church A's book if you
[1:00:25] can say that right but but here here the
[1:00:27] other thing I want to say is that at the
[1:00:29] end of Charles Lin writing his book
[1:00:33] whatever the name of the book is I don't
[1:00:34] even know the name but whatever the name
[1:00:36] of the book is did the angel of the Lord
[1:00:40] come into the church go to the back wall
[1:00:44] and draw on the wall what was being
[1:00:46] taught in the front of the
[1:00:48] church see the signs and wonders of the
[1:00:51] word promise backs it up yes sir when we

[1:01:41] to pass that they disbelieve this
[1:01:44] Prophet Lord amen after seeing the word
[1:01:48] being so confirmed the bright got out of
[1:01:53] Step you know what I'm speaking about in
[1:01:56] the vision see got out of Step but look
[1:01:59] at this he says there was one stayed up
[1:02:02] by the name of Joshua and Caleb amen and
[1:02:07] believe the Word of Promise true

[1:02:22] word regardless of the circumstances
[1:02:25] brother you just can't bring up a
[1:02:26] website and talk about a bridge and
[1:02:29] think that's going to get me not to look
[1:02:31] at the message you need to understand
[1:02:34] something if you want to try to get me
[1:02:35] to disbelieve this message you going to
[1:02:37] have to disprove it by the
[1:02:38] word not by a bridge not by bear you
[1:02:43] ain't going to get me like that you
[1:02:44] going to have to disprove this by the
[1:02:45] word and I'm going have some questions
[1:02:48] for you that's
[1:02:52] right I'mma take you to Matthew 177 you
[1:02:56] better have an answer if you tell me
[1:03:00] that John the Baptist was the one that
[1:03:02] restored then I'm might have a
[1:03:10] question all right what did he restore
[1:03:13] let's go on all right so here uh since
[1:03:15] he say we we we we G to be like uh he
[1:03:18] said Joshua and Caleb was the one that
[1:03:20] was still standing there with the word
[1:03:21] regardless of the circumstance here in
[1:03:23] the in the church a book The Angel of
[1:03:26] the Lord had told the prophet to pick up
[1:03:28] his pen and write and and that's why you
[1:03:30] see it kind of italicized there because
[1:03:32] this is the Angel speaking directly to
[1:03:34] you Hallelujah now the angel says let us
[1:03:39] stand like Joshua and Caleb our promised
[1:03:43] land is coming in sight even as theirs

[1:03:50] he represents the end time leader that
[1:03:53] will come to the church even as Paul

[1:05:55] on that end one at the beginning one at
[1:05:56] the end Paul was a book in
[1:06:00] messenger that's right yes sir he was on
[1:06:04] the front end but in order to keep this
[1:06:06] thing together we need a book in on the
[1:06:09] back
[1:06:09] end and the book in message on the back
[1:06:12] end was William Mary and
[1:06:14] brandham and his message was to restore
[1:06:18] everything that Paul taught he had to
[1:06:20] come back and preach everything Paul
[1:06:22] taught so when he went across to the
[1:06:24] other side
[1:06:26] and the angel allowed him to come in and
[1:06:28] see all these people he say he say these
[1:06:29] are your people that say they are Broms
[1:06:31] no not brandom they your converts
[1:06:36] right he says I want to see Jesus and
[1:06:38] you can't see him right now he said you
[1:06:39] going you have to wait he going to come
[1:06:41] to you because you was a leader on the
[1:06:42] earth in your day you was a leader says
[1:06:44] he going to come to you and going to
[1:06:45] judge you by Everything You
[1:06:48] Preach that's right it says Paul here
[1:06:53] yeah Will Paul be judged by everything
[1:06:55] he preach yeah he said well I
[1:07:02] preach this message is not a new message
[1:07:06] this message is a restoration message
[1:07:09] preaching the same thing Paul
[1:07:12] preach he says I preach the same thing
[1:07:16] that Paul
[1:07:19] preached
[1:07:21] Millions
[1:07:23] Hallelujah Millions
[1:07:26] screamed out when they heard brother
[1:07:28] Brandon say that in heaven Millions
[1:07:30] screamed out sir we are resting on that
[1:07:34] yes sir sir and I'm here to tell
[1:07:38] you I was right there I was one of the
[1:07:41] millions that said I'm resting on that
[1:07:44] and I'm here to tell you one of the
[1:07:46] millions too you why because in every
[1:07:49] age God predestines his word for that
[1:07:51] age and he predestines the people to
[1:07:54] believe the word for that age yes so I'm
[1:07:56] not here by mistake I came here from God
[1:08:00] I had to believe this message yes sir
[1:08:03] amen let me finish reading this
[1:08:06] quote let's
[1:08:08] stand like Joshua and Caleb our promised
[1:08:10] land is coming in sight even as theirs
[1:08:12] did now Joshua means Jehovah's Savior
[1:08:15] and he represents the end time leader
[1:08:17] that would come to the church even as
[1:08:19] Paul came as the original leader Caleb
[1:08:22] represents those that stayed true with
[1:08:24] Joshua
[1:08:29] can I uh drop this
[1:08:32] off we're gonna stay true to
[1:08:35] Joshua not Joshua's
[1:08:40] children
[1:08:43] sir all
[1:08:47] right let me go
[1:08:49] on cuz this what the angel said yes sir
[1:08:52] the angel said we got to stay true to
[1:08:54] Joshua yes sir that Joshua's children
[1:08:56] might lead us into other
[1:08:58] things but we stand true to Joshua
[1:09:01] Hallelujah all right remember God had
[1:09:04] started Israel as a virgin with his word
[1:09:06] but they wanted something different that
[1:09:08] mean they were getting out of step right
[1:09:10] so did the last day Church notice how
[1:09:14] God did not move Israel or let her go
[1:09:16] into the promised land until it was his
[1:09:18] own appointed time amen now the people
[1:09:23] might have put pressure on Joshua the
[1:09:25] leader and said the land is ours let's
[1:09:27] go and take it Joshua you are all
[1:09:30] through you must have lost your
[1:09:32] commission you don't have the power you
[1:09:34] used to have now you know I know people
[1:09:36] that have left the message because they
[1:09:37] Fel they felt that it didn't have the
[1:09:39] power no Supernatural happening like it
[1:09:41] used to be and they get CAU they don't
[1:09:43] realize there's a spirit coming in
[1:09:45] causing them to think that way Jesus
[1:09:47] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:09:49] forever he ain't lost his power sir amen
[1:09:53] look he says um you don't have the power
[1:09:56] youed to have you used to uh uh the land
[1:09:58] let's go and take it Joshua all through
[1:10:00] you must have lost your commission you
[1:10:01] don't have the power you used to have
[1:10:02] you used to hear from God and know that
[1:10:04] know the will of God and act quickly
[1:10:07] something is wrong with you oh my they
[1:10:09] point the problem is on Joshua now
[1:10:11] people pointing the problem to brother
[1:10:13] brandom and don't even know him a't
[1:10:15] never met him one day in their life
[1:10:17] right but but something's wrong with you
[1:10:19] but Joshua was a god-sent prophet and he
[1:10:22] knew the promises of God so he waited
[1:10:24] for them them he waited for a clear-cut
[1:10:27] decision from God and when the time came
[1:10:29] to move God placed a full leadership in
[1:10:31] Joshua's hand because he had stay with
[1:10:33] the word God God could trust Joshua but
[1:10:37] not the others so it will repeat in this
[1:10:40] day the same problem the same pressures
[1:10:45] so we see that spirit and now the angel
[1:10:47] told the prophet to pick up his pen and
[1:10:49] write and the angel spoke these things
[1:10:52] brother brandham just recorded it on
[1:10:53] paper yes sir so the angel told us that
[1:10:55] these Spirits would come and what we
[1:10:57] need is a message that will cause us to
[1:10:59] get back in Step all right let's go
[1:11:06] on scripture we read that which the
[1:11:09] Palmer worm hath left hath the Locust
[1:11:12] eaten that which the Locust hath the
[1:11:13] cankerworm eaten that which the canker
[1:11:15] worm left hath the caterpillar eaten now
[1:11:17] I mentioned to you all I've been talking
[1:11:19] to you about this commentary amen that I
[1:11:22] pull from called illuminous software and
[1:11:25] uh um um this was their definition this
[1:11:27] is what something I've been driving at
[1:11:29] you all the theme of the first chapter
[1:11:31] they're trying to explain joel4 and it
[1:11:34] says the theme of the first chapter of
[1:11:35] the prophecy the destruction caused by
[1:11:37] the Locust plague is introduced in in
[1:11:40] this verse palmerworm Locust cankerworm
[1:11:42] caterpillar and they said the meaning of
[1:11:45] the four Hebrew words translated here is
[1:11:49] uncertain they say they probably refer
[1:11:53] to four stages in the development of the
[1:11:55] the Locust rather than to four distinct
[1:11:57] types of locust now part of what they're
[1:11:59] saying is right because this is the same
[1:12:01] in insect in four different stages it is
[1:12:05] but when they say the meaning of these
[1:12:07] four Hebrew words translated is
[1:12:08] uncertain that because they looking at
[1:12:10] it from an intellectual point of view
[1:12:13] but as we're going a prophetic view
[1:12:16] gives us so much more insight on this
[1:12:20] one
[1:12:21] scripture the average church when they
[1:12:24] look at Joy going for they wouldn't have
[1:12:26] much to say about it what is being
[1:12:28] restored right but here brother brandom
[1:12:30] gives us a few things and and and the
[1:12:32] other other uh uh book that I that I I
[1:12:35] gave you was I just um in the next slide
[1:12:39] this um uh the definition I gave you
[1:12:41] from this book I got key to the Bible
[1:12:44] and this word restore means to deliver
[1:12:45] back again and they they use the
[1:12:48] scripture Genesis 27 that's that's uh
[1:12:51] ailec having to give Sarah back to
[1:12:54] Abraham we went through that on last
[1:12:55] week so that's what delivered back again
[1:12:57] the next one it says to make a return as
[1:12:59] a thief and I went back and and verified
[1:13:02] that and and uh Exodus 22 if you got
[1:13:05] caught
[1:13:06] stealing my God if you got caught you
[1:13:09] had to you had to give it back double
[1:13:12] I'm going tell you we done caught the
[1:13:13] devil stealing we done caught the devil
[1:13:16] stealing so I'm not just expecting just
[1:13:18] what I got back I I'm getting back that
[1:13:24] plus I caught you steing
[1:13:27] Satan you tried to take my peace you
[1:13:30] tried to take my joy I caught you
[1:13:33] stealing Satan I want it back double
[1:13:37] Hall and you know what there was a law
[1:13:40] God put a law there to make them give it
[1:13:42] back double amen that's right if they
[1:13:45] took one one one Ox they had to come
[1:13:48] back with
[1:13:49] two praise the Lord church that's how
[1:13:52] you settled it when you doubled it yes
[1:13:54] sir amen make that devil double it up
[1:13:57] all right all right all right so to make
[1:14:00] return as for a theft the next one says
[1:14:02] to reestablish as an office they used
[1:14:04] the butler uh found in Genesis 4013 this
[1:14:07] is the scripture that they were using
[1:14:09] amen the other thing is to reclaim an
[1:14:11] heiring Christian which we uh brought
[1:14:13] that out last week to restore such a one
[1:14:15] in the spirit of meekness but you had to
[1:14:16] be spiritual if you found somebody
[1:14:19] overtaken in the fault you had to be
[1:14:21] spiritual Amen to restore such a one in
[1:14:23] the spirit we meekness Now understand
[1:14:26] this when we find somebody overtaken a
[1:14:28] fault we don't want to drive them down
[1:14:32] we want to lift them up am amen right
[1:14:36] your your your your your your objective
[1:14:38] is to lift them up considering yourself
[1:14:41] lest you also be tempted all right now
[1:14:44] the other thing that they brought here
[1:14:45] was to recover the purity of divine
[1:14:47] worship by Reformation that's their uh
[1:14:50] definition but I put restoration and the
[1:14:54] reason that I could put I can add to
[1:14:56] their
[1:14:58] definition because of the scripture that
[1:15:01] they're re they're using yes sir they
[1:15:03] use to recover the pure to Divine
[1:15:05] worship by reformation and they use
[1:15:08] Matthew 17:10 through1 3 we went through
[1:15:11] this on last week but I'm just recapping
[1:15:13] some things so this next slide is what
[1:15:16] we what we what we we talked about in
[1:15:18] Matthew uh 17 10-13 says and his
[1:15:21] disciples asked him saying why then say
[1:15:24] the scrib
[1:15:25] that Elias must first come and Jesus
[1:15:28] answered and said unto them Elias truly
[1:15:32] shall first come and restore all things
[1:15:38] but I say unto you that Elias is come
[1:15:43] already see now and and then he not
[1:15:46] playing games with the words all this is
[1:15:49] is actually two different comings of
[1:15:51] Elias or Elijah two different coming and
[1:15:54] We Know by re the spirit of Elijah was
[1:15:56] used four five times it was in Elijah it
[1:16:00] was an Elisha who got a double portion
[1:16:03] of Eliah Spirit it was in John the
[1:16:06] Baptist the third time the fourth time
[1:16:08] it was in the ministry of William Mari
[1:16:10] and branom and then the fifth time is as
[1:16:13] one of the two witnesses coming back to
[1:16:15] deal with the Jews according to the Book
[1:16:17] of Revelation Revelations amen five
[1:16:20] times the spirit of elij just used
[1:16:22] according to the scripture right all
[1:16:25] right all right all right so Jesus said
[1:16:27] Elias truly shall first come and restore
[1:16:30] all things but I say unto you that Elias
[1:16:34] is come already and they knew him not
[1:16:37] but have done unto unto him whatsoever
[1:16:39] they listed likewise shall also the son
[1:16:41] of man suffer of them now here is where
[1:16:44] they finally it finally struck them this
[1:16:46] is after Mount Transfiguration the
[1:16:49] disciples that the Bible says then the
[1:16:51] disciples understood that he spake unto
[1:16:52] them of John the Baptist now there when
[1:16:55] it said he spake to them of John the
[1:16:57] Baptist they understood that this Elias
[1:17:00] that came already was John the Baptist
[1:17:03] but they did not know who this Elias
[1:17:05] truly shall first come and restore all
[1:17:07] things
[1:17:08] was remember my question last week if
[1:17:11] somebody say that John the Baptist was
[1:17:13] the Fulfillment of both of these
[1:17:14] scriptures you have one
[1:17:17] question according to this Elias's got
[1:17:20] to come and restore all things so the
[1:17:22] question is what did he restore right
[1:17:25] well I said it was brother brandham that
[1:17:28] restored all things
[1:17:30] so what did he
[1:17:32] restore all right He restored serpent
[1:17:36] seed water
[1:17:38] baptism
[1:17:40] godhead no eternal hell the truth of
[1:17:44] marriage and
[1:17:45] divorce Grace straighten
[1:17:49] out even predestination in election
[1:17:52] there some churches that will not even
[1:17:53] preach predestination because they think
[1:17:55] that God got favorites no it's not a
[1:17:58] thing of favorites God can predestinate
[1:18:01] by for
[1:18:04] knowledge because he knows what choices
[1:18:07] you are going to make when the word is
[1:18:09] presented to you God already know what
[1:18:11] choice you're going to make so he
[1:18:12] predestines based on his for knowledge
[1:18:16] yes sir brother Brandon brought that
[1:18:17] adoption and placing yes sir right
[1:18:20] brother Brandon brought that to us who
[1:18:22] is this MDC yes sir right um and and and
[1:18:25] and and one of the real really important
[1:18:27] on was the revelation of the Seven Seals
[1:18:29] and the Seven Thunders praise the Lord
[1:18:33] amen these Revelations nobody else
[1:18:35] brought that it was sealed until this
[1:18:37] time but once once the prophet came and
[1:18:39] see it was released to us and there was
[1:18:41] a supernatural element that happened
[1:18:44] even to bring the revelation of the
[1:18:46] Seven Seals to us seven angels from
[1:18:49] Glory caught the prophet up in a cloud
[1:18:52] sent them back to the east to preach
[1:18:54] these things to us that's right he
[1:18:56] wasn't just preaching and every every
[1:18:58] day glory to God that he preached a seal
[1:19:02] the angel came into the room to tell him
[1:19:06] what to preach yes sir
[1:19:09] amen that's right
[1:19:11] brother I'm going be honest I've been
[1:19:13] preaching for 20 something years I ain't
[1:19:16] never had a physical
[1:19:18] Angel come into my room and tell me
[1:19:21] exactly what to
[1:19:23] preach
[1:19:26] any of the preachers had that experience
[1:19:28] yet I mean this is exactly what you what
[1:19:30] you not and when he preach the Seven
[1:19:32] Seals every night for a whole week Angel

[1:19:54] as a man he still got some things

[1:23:50] that is seen is not hope for what man

[1:24:05] the Spirit uh also helpeth our
[1:24:08] infirmities for we know not what we
[1:24:09] should pray for as we ought but the
[1:24:11] spirit itself maketh intercession for us
[1:24:13] with groanings which cannot be uttered
[1:24:16] and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth
[1:24:18] that knoweth what is the mind of the
[1:24:20] spirit because he maketh intercession
[1:24:22] for the Saints according to the will of
[1:24:24] God God and this is the one that's
[1:24:25] really good and we know yes that all
[1:24:29] things work together for good to them
[1:24:32] that love God to them who are the called
[1:24:34] according to his purpose for whom he did
[1:24:37] for no praise God he also did
[1:24:41] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:24:44] image of his son that he might be the
[1:24:45] firstborn among many Brethren moreover
[1:24:48] whom he did predestinate them he also
[1:24:51] called amen and whom he called them he
[1:24:53] also
[1:24:54] Justified Hallelujah that's why I said
[1:24:56] the devil can't hold nothing against you
[1:24:59] when you realize you a part of this
[1:25:02] restoration amen then amen more whom he
[1:25:04] did predestinate then he also called and

[1:25:30] also freely give us all things who shall
[1:25:32] lay anything to the charge of God's
[1:25:36] elect it is God not the devil it is God

[1:25:52] of Jesus amen my attorney is also my
[1:25:57] judge amen amen he says uh who shall lay
[1:26:00] anything to the charge of God it is God

[1:26:07] risen again who is even at the right
[1:26:09] hand of God who also maketh intercession
[1:26:12] for us who shall separate us from the
[1:26:15] love of Christ shall
[1:26:18] tribulation come on or
[1:26:21] distress or
[1:26:23] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[1:26:28] Peril or sword as it is written for thy
[1:26:31] sake we are killed all the day long we
[1:26:33] are counted as sheep of the slaughter
[1:26:36] [Music]
[1:26:37] nay in all these things all what things
[1:26:42] persecution famine distress nakedness
[1:26:45] Peril sword tribulation all these things
[1:26:49] Paul said me in all these things we are
[1:26:51] more than conquerors through him them
[1:26:54] that loved us Paul got excited for I am
[1:26:58] persuaded amen I'm not discouraged I am
[1:27:02] persuaded that neither death nor life
[1:27:07] nor angels my God nor
[1:27:11] principalities nor powers nor things
[1:27:15] present whatever I'm going through it
[1:27:18] can't discourage me no things present my
[1:27:22] nor things to come
[1:27:25] hallelujah hallelujah amen nor height
[1:27:28] nor depth nor any other creature you
[1:27:32] can't take my
[1:27:36] praise nor any other creature shall be
[1:27:39] able to separate
[1:27:42] us and I like the way Paul put that he
[1:27:45] didn't make it personally he could have
[1:27:47] said separate me but separate us you
[1:27:50] going to overcome this thing brother you
[1:27:52] going to overcome this thing sister
[1:27:54] nothing going to separate us from the
[1:27:57] love of God which is in Christ Jesus our
[1:28:02] lord when you know you've been restored
[1:28:04] ain't nothing the devil can
[1:28:06] do to stop you from getting all that God
[1:28:09] has for you let's keep going on here God
[1:28:14] already
[1:28:15] glorified Justified us and glorified so
[1:28:18] now there's four stages of the same
[1:28:20] insect brother brandom tells us first
[1:28:23] the Palmer worm comes the next he um
[1:28:27] destroyed the
[1:28:29] fruit of the spirit right he DW this
[1:28:32] destroy the fruit and uh and brother Ram
[1:28:34] says it's the fruit of the spirit that
[1:28:36] he actually came came after fruit of the
[1:28:39] spirit we find that in Galatians 5 ver
[1:28:41] 22-2 you can find that but he destroyed
[1:28:44] the fruit of the spirit next thing he uh
[1:28:46] he also destroyed Brotherly Love in the
[1:28:48] church amen and the way he destroyed it
[1:28:50] is through
[1:28:52] gossip that's how that that's why
[1:28:54] brother brand said we need a spiritual
[1:28:56] Electrical Fence to stop all the
[1:28:59] gossip it's got to come to a
[1:29:02] halt cuz this is the devil take the
[1:29:04] brotherly love right out the church you
[1:29:06] know I'm going tell you something this
[1:29:07] is when people start feeling led to
[1:29:09] leave and go to another
[1:29:11] church amen and something something done
[1:29:14] happened here some some little talk
[1:29:17] somebody spread something they shouldn't
[1:29:18] have said well they going to think this
[1:29:19] way about me they going to think that no
[1:29:21] no no no we don't want that around here
[1:29:24] amen don't talk about nobody pray for
[1:29:26] pray for one another sir he also say eat
[1:29:30] your faith in the word right and he eats
[1:29:32] the joy of your salvation that's what
[1:29:34] the Palmer worm does the next one is the
[1:29:36] Locust and he ate the leaves of divine
[1:29:39] Fellowship that's what the Locust comes
[1:29:41] to do eats the the leaves of divine
[1:29:44] Fellowship my hallelujah it's so
[1:29:48] important church that we stay in
[1:29:50] Fellowship one with the
[1:29:52] other we we we try to put on events here
[1:29:55] at the church we want the young people
[1:29:57] to be able to have somewhere that can
[1:29:58] come and just kind of just just enjoy
[1:30:00] one another's presence I rather for the
[1:30:02] young people to be together
[1:30:04] fellowshipping than not there with the
[1:30:05] world and cousins that'll lead them to
[1:30:08] stuff that they shouldn't be led to
[1:30:11] right put them in the in the in in the
[1:30:13] presence of the the other youth it's
[1:30:16] going to be important to their
[1:30:18] development praise the Lord they get out
[1:30:21] there next thing you know they want to
[1:30:22] marry somebody out there and now we got
[1:30:24] a real problem cuz a a a Believer can't
[1:30:26] be yoked up with an
[1:30:28] unbeliever
[1:30:30] Hallelujah and see what happened then
[1:30:33] you know we get a Believer go get yolked
[1:30:35] up with unbeliever then and like like my
[1:30:36] uncle say they get a lemon
[1:30:40] yeah they get a lemon it's a
[1:30:44] sour sour marriage you know what I'm
[1:30:47] saying and when they get a lemon you
[1:30:49] know what they want to do they want to
[1:30:50] bring the lemon to church and try to get
[1:30:52] the pastor to make some lemon
[1:30:55] I was trying to make lemonade in you
[1:30:57] before you went out there and got that
[1:31:04] lemon but keep them surrounded by
[1:31:08] Saints amen and it's going to be a
[1:31:11] sacrifice take your kids to meetings yes
[1:31:13] sir amen praise the Lord take them
[1:31:16] somewhere where the presence of God is
[1:31:18] moving where they can get closer to God
[1:31:20] take them make a sacrifice go in your
[1:31:22] pocket get some money out and get take
[1:31:24] them to a
[1:31:28] meeting this cankerworm he comes amen he
[1:31:31] attacks the bark of the tree destroys
[1:31:34] the covering or the religion he also
[1:31:36] attacks the doctrines like baptism and
[1:31:39] also substitutes a genuine Holy Ghost
[1:31:41] experience with a handshake he attacks
[1:31:43] these things another thing the the
[1:31:46] caterpillar comes and he sucks the very
[1:31:48] life out through denominating this is
[1:31:50] how the life is taken out of the church
[1:31:52] is through denom name so these are the
[1:31:54] four stages of the same insect now let's
[1:31:56] go further let's go
[1:32:00] further in the message the restoration
[1:32:02] of the Bride tree brother brandom tells
[1:32:05] us he says listen real close now look
[1:32:08] there was four death Messengers kill
[1:32:10] that tree is that right what was it
[1:32:13] Palmer worm Locust cankerworm
[1:32:17] caterpillar is that right four
[1:32:19] messengers of Roman Devils dogmas kill
[1:32:22] that tree one took its fruit one took
[1:32:25] its bark or its leaves one took its bark
[1:32:28] one took the life is that right four
[1:32:30] messengers of dogmas kill that tree all
[1:32:34] but the
[1:32:35] roots and if four messengers of Death
[1:32:38] kill the tree four messengers of Life
[1:32:41] restores the tree hallelu come on a
[1:32:45] little further here four messengers of
[1:32:47] Death kill the tree four messengers of
[1:32:50] life will restore the tree hit next
[1:32:53] again brother brother random goes on to
[1:32:54] say this it says did you do you get it
[1:32:58] amen for God said I will restore it now
[1:33:02] remember I told you the the theologians
[1:33:04] and that that Illumina uh software that
[1:33:07] I'm using is written by the Catholic
[1:33:09] church now these are people that's
[1:33:11] supposed to really study this Bible but
[1:33:13] they say we don't really know what this
[1:33:14] means it's uncertain but here a prophet
[1:33:17] picks this up and says four death
[1:33:19] Messengers killed it but four life
[1:33:21] Messengers will restore it sir
[1:33:24] Hallelujah glory to God Amen he says uh
[1:33:27] he says I'll restore it he is going to
[1:33:29] restore it how by four death Messengers
[1:33:32] killed it then four life Messengers will
[1:33:34] restore it yes sir what was the first
[1:33:38] how does a prophet pick this up and give
[1:33:40] it to us the the the Catholics have no
[1:33:42] idea but a prophet is a man with a
[1:33:45] seventh grade education tells us what
[1:33:47] this is all about yes sir when he picks
[1:33:49] up Joel 14 and Joel 2 he picks it up and
[1:33:52] he tells us exact ex L what it means it
[1:33:55] says what was the first Martin Luther
[1:33:57] justification what was the second John
[1:33:59] Wesley by sanctification what was the
[1:34:01] third Pentecost with the restoration of
[1:34:04] the
[1:34:05] gifts now listen this is why I said last
[1:34:08] week we done have people preach the
[1:34:11] gifts out of the church but the gifts
[1:34:13] were part of the
[1:34:15] restoration
[1:34:16] amen the gifts were part of the
[1:34:19] restorant it was part of the process
[1:34:22] just like justification sanctification
[1:34:24] the gifts had to come back yes right
[1:34:26] they had to that's why that's why a
[1:34:28] Susan Street took place that was a that
[1:34:30] was a the Fulfillment of this scripture
[1:34:33] happening in this in a souu street a
[1:34:35] part of the Fulfillment of the scripture
[1:34:37] look he says uh he says what was the
[1:34:39] first Martin Luther justification what
[1:34:41] was the second John westation what was
[1:34:43] the third Pentecost with the restoration
[1:34:45] of the gifts the Holy Ghost baptism of
[1:34:47] the Holy Ghost what was the
[1:34:49] fourth the word what the word
[1:34:54] word oh my my my my my we going further
[1:34:57] we're going further there were four
[1:34:59] great prophets one of them Martin Luther
[1:35:01] he began to shine a light there was a
[1:35:03] little light just a very small strength
[1:35:05] of justification Along come Wesley
[1:35:07] stronger signification after Wesley
[1:35:09] comeing stronger than him Pentecost of
[1:35:11] the baptism of the Holy Ghost another
[1:35:13] great prophet see but in the last days
[1:35:16] of Malachi 4 Elijah is to come with the
[1:35:20] very word this is what Jesus said that
[1:35:23] Elijah El would come and restore all
[1:35:25] things He restored the word and there
[1:35:28] was a supernatural element that came to
[1:35:30] prove and vindicate that what he was
[1:35:32] saying was the
[1:35:35] truth Elijah to come with the very word
[1:35:38] hallelujah the word of the Lord came to
[1:35:40] the prophet in the evening light is to
[1:35:42] come forth to restore and bring back
[1:35:44] what turn the hearts of the children
[1:35:47] back to the faith of the father's fourth
[1:35:50] light the fourth light and not don't
[1:35:53] have time to deal with that fourth light
[1:35:58] y'all know I want
[1:35:59] to Fourth light let me just drop this
[1:36:03] off it was uh the fourth light actually
[1:36:06] brings the
[1:36:09] restoration
[1:36:11] see he said justification
[1:36:15] sanctification then he said the baptism
[1:36:18] of the Holy Ghost but then the fourth
[1:36:19] light was the word coming back that that
[1:36:22] that's that that's that's the that's the
[1:36:23] full restoration and the fourth light
[1:36:26] amen is what brings the complete
[1:36:28] restoration here's another thing I want
[1:36:29] to tell you is that it was only on the
[1:36:31] fourth day that we actually got
[1:36:38] sunlight the first day when he said let
[1:36:41] there be light that was s o n light but
[1:36:45] it was on the fourth day that we got s n
[1:36:47] light and we got Moonlight two great
[1:36:50] lights to rule the day and to rule the
[1:36:51] night that happened on the fourth day
[1:36:54] right my God my God can I tell you
[1:36:57] another thing about this fourth light it
[1:37:00] was it was in the fourth
[1:37:07] generation brother brandom said in
[1:37:09] Israel's history Reviving one generation
[1:37:13] they saw the Revival start in the first
[1:37:15] generation Hallelujah and then in the
[1:37:18] Next Generation the fires begin to
[1:37:21] fade in the third generation generation
[1:37:23] says the Embers may be glowing
[1:37:26] slightly but then it says when we get to
[1:37:28] the fourth
[1:37:30] generation Hallelujah fourth light when
[1:37:33] we get to the fourth generation it says
[1:37:34] there's no
[1:37:36] vestage of the original flame that's why
[1:37:39] you saw people rise up in this
[1:37:41] generation and begin to go against the
[1:37:43] message they did not do it 30 years ago
[1:37:46] or or or 50 years ago they was too close
[1:37:48] to it then but when it got to the fourth
[1:37:50] generation that's when this I mean this
[1:37:53] this group rose up with their intellect
[1:37:55] and said that the message was wrong all
[1:37:58] because of a bridge and all because of a
[1:38:01] a
[1:38:02] bear a
[1:38:05] bear a bear took him from the word a
[1:38:09] bear that's all the devil had to show
[1:38:12] show you that he didn't get his bear
[1:38:14] well he's disobedient and he said he was
[1:38:16] disobedient that's why he get his bear
[1:38:18] but they ain't got nothing to do with
[1:38:19] the
[1:38:21] word but when we see that we enter the
[1:38:25] fourth generation there's no vestage of
[1:38:27] the original flame also the fourth
[1:38:30] there's something happens in the fourth
[1:38:31] generation that didn't happen in the
[1:38:33] other Generations it's in that
[1:38:35] generation where God promised to light
[1:38:39] the fire again
[1:38:43] amen fourth light and it just so
[1:38:46] happened this is part four of get back
[1:38:49] and
[1:38:51] step fourth light
[1:39:01] so brother random tells us that this
[1:39:03] next slide it says uh four death
[1:39:05] Messengers took it but four like four
[1:39:08] life Messengers were bring it
[1:39:10] back so we going to list these four
[1:39:12] death Messengers and four life
[1:39:14] Messengers The Four death Messengers was
[1:39:16] the Palmer worm took the brotherly love
[1:39:17] and the
[1:39:18] fruit the the the the uh also the Locust
[1:39:22] he took the leaves of divine
[1:39:24] Fellowship the caner worm attacks the
[1:39:27] doctrine or the
[1:39:29] religion the
[1:39:31] caterpillar sucks all the life out but
[1:39:34] there is life in the
[1:39:36] root couldn't get
[1:39:39] that you
[1:39:41] know even in our Natural Life boy the
[1:39:44] devil will cause us to leave the church
[1:39:45] and get involved in some crazy stuff
[1:39:48] things that we're ashamed of but you
[1:39:51] know even in the midst of your
[1:39:52] involvement there was always something
[1:39:54] in your
[1:39:57] roots it was always something in your
[1:40:00] roots I mean I I remember my brother
[1:40:02] sharing how he got invited you know to
[1:40:05] they they saw he wasn't going to church
[1:40:06] like come on over to this church here
[1:40:08] Baptist Church come on over this church
[1:40:10] and he say nah I know I'm doing some
[1:40:13] stuff out here things that I shouldn't
[1:40:15] be doing I know I shouldn't be doing but
[1:40:17] one thing I am not going to do I am not
[1:40:21] going to that church to sit in there act
[1:40:22] like I'm
[1:40:25] eaten I ain't going there it was
[1:40:28] something inside of his
[1:40:31] roots Hallelujah something that'll hold
[1:40:34] you that'll anchor you no matter how far
[1:40:38] the devil take to you it's something in
[1:40:39] your roots that caus you to come back to
[1:40:42] this four death messages took it here's
[1:40:45] four life messages the first first one
[1:40:47] was Luther the second was Wesley the
[1:40:50] third was Pentecost and then Malachi 4
[1:40:53] four and again I put Matthew 17:11 right
[1:40:56] because Jesus said that Elias truly
[1:40:58] shall first come and restore all things
[1:41:01] so Malachi 4 is connected to Matthew
[1:41:04] 17711 Malachi 4 is also connected to
[1:41:07] Revelation 10 and 7 it seem there's no
[1:41:10] one scripture we following it's the word
[1:41:12] this this this all over the
[1:41:14] word but what was restored if for Life
[1:41:17] Messengers brought it back what did they
[1:41:22] restore
[1:41:23] Luther brought us
[1:41:25] justification the just shall live by
[1:41:28] faith he got so tired of the Catholic
[1:41:31] church if you just reading your
[1:41:33] Bible Revelation 2 talks about the first
[1:41:37] four Church ages and in the fourth
[1:41:38] Church age they went to the depths of
[1:41:41] Satan but then in Revelation three
[1:41:43] Luther starts coming and then wesle
[1:41:46] starts coming and this this whole
[1:41:48] chapter of Revelation 3 is a Reformation
[1:41:50] turning into a restoration sir
[1:41:53] amen just in your Bible is broke up like
[1:41:57] that my God Luther start out but you
[1:42:00] know he started with justification just
[1:42:02] your live by faith then what does Wesley
[1:42:04] uh restore Wesley comes along with
[1:42:07] sanctification brother brandom call a
[1:42:08] second work of Grace what does uh
[1:42:11] Pentecost come restoration of the gifts
[1:42:14] through the true baptism of the Holy
[1:42:16] Ghost this why I say we not getting rid
[1:42:18] of gifts around here no I encourage
[1:42:21] gifts as long as they are in order with
[1:42:23] the scripture I encourage that because
[1:42:26] that is part of the restoration we can't
[1:42:29] push that to the side we just got to get
[1:42:31] it lined up correctly amen amen you you
[1:42:35] take it out of the Bible when you when
[1:42:37] you when you when you take it out of the
[1:42:38] church like that it's got to stay in the
[1:42:40] church if that's what they had at
[1:42:42] Pentecost we supposed to have the exact
[1:42:44] same thing that's right amen the only
[1:42:47] thing we got now is the word to go on
[1:42:49] top of that and that was the fourth
[1:42:52] thing that was restored it was the word
[1:42:55] the word was restored the the revelation
[1:42:58] of the word you say well we always had a
[1:43:00] Bible you're right you're right but they
[1:43:02] didn't know what it
[1:43:04] meant how many churches you go to today
[1:43:06] and you tell them turn to Revelation
[1:43:09] 10:7 they like what oh what you get
[1:43:14] ready and I come in come on Brother come
[1:43:18] on come on I mean what is it it's these
[1:43:20] are people that's been restored they
[1:43:22] know exactly what where we
[1:43:30] are I just had a supporting quote that I
[1:43:33] wanted to go along with
[1:43:36] that and I'm I'm I'm going somewhere I
[1:43:38] just I want to just put this on the
[1:43:40] slide so y'all can see it
[1:43:42] all brother Brandon says this in the
[1:43:44] message the Masterpiece do you know the
[1:43:46] Masterpiece
[1:43:47] itself was uh a message with brother
[1:43:50] Brandon preached about restoration and
[1:43:52] and the Masterpiece he tells us that uh
[1:43:56] uh
[1:43:57] Michelangelo had this great sculpture of
[1:44:00] Moses he never seen a picture of Moses
[1:44:03] never never um he he just in his mind he
[1:44:06] just kind of he he said this is what
[1:44:08] Moses must have look like and he spent
[1:44:11] years carving out this Moses carving him
[1:44:13] out carving him out and um you know and
[1:44:16] and when he when he carved them out uh
[1:44:19] and he unveiled
[1:44:21] it where he looked at that he looked at
[1:44:24] what he had created he was so inspired
[1:44:28] he took his little instrument that he
[1:44:29] was chiseling and carving with he took
[1:44:31] the instrument and struck
[1:44:34] Moses say speak
[1:44:37] Moses oh
[1:44:39] God if Michael Michelangelo would try to
[1:44:42] get Moses to speak what you think the
[1:44:44] Holy Ghost is trying to get you to
[1:44:47] do I'm going tell y'all something your
[1:44:49] restoration will be released by what you
[1:44:51] say right
[1:44:56] your restoration will be released by
[1:44:59] what you
[1:45:01] say and I'm going to prove it to you in
[1:45:04] scripture in just a little bit your
[1:45:06] restoration did y'all get your pen out
[1:45:08] did y'all write that down my restoration
[1:45:11] is released by what I
[1:45:13] say

[1:45:18] God say don't say nothing
[1:45:20] negative God want you to have this
[1:45:22] church
[1:45:23] now here in this message the Masterpiece
[1:45:25] brother Brandon makes a statement says
[1:45:26] notice here the life that was in the
[1:45:28] husk and the stalk and in the tassel and
[1:45:31] the hus all gathers in the seed and the
[1:45:34] life that was in the stalk went one went
[1:45:38] went uh went to make the other
[1:45:39] justification made a way for
[1:45:41] sanctification sanctification made a way
[1:45:43] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[1:45:45] baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for
[1:45:48] the Holy Ghost itself to come write down
[1:45:51] imperfection back to the word again to
[1:45:55] manifest itself so what was restored
[1:45:58] justification sanctification praise God
[1:46:02] and uh and then the the gifts but it
[1:46:04] also brings us back to the word when he
[1:46:06] says uh the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:46:08] made a way for the Holy Ghost itself
[1:46:09] this is the very person of Christ so

[1:49:24] but I'm going start with verse 1-5 says
[1:49:27] the hand of the
[1:49:28] Lord was upon me and carried me out in
[1:49:32] the spirit of the Lord and set me down
[1:49:34] in the midst of the valley which was
[1:49:36] full of Bones now here's what I need you
[1:49:38] to see when ezekiel's looking at this
[1:49:41] Valley full of Bones this is a hopeless
[1:49:46] situation I mean they done lost
[1:49:49] everything Hallelujah I mean sometimes
[1:49:52] you if you've ever had the experience
[1:49:54] you know looking at someone that that
[1:49:56] just passed away and their body is
[1:49:58] laying there sometimes you as a Believer

[1:50:32] but but he said look you you just just
[1:50:33] believe now don't don't don't worry
[1:50:35] about it now but but somebody in a
[1:50:37] situation like that it look like it's
[1:50:38] there's some hope here I can still see
[1:50:40] their flesh I can still see this I can
[1:50:42] still see that but when they get down to
[1:50:44] just
[1:50:46] bones I can't even identify the
[1:50:49] body it's just bones it look hopeless
[1:50:52] help
[1:50:53] I'm just dealing with bones some of us
[1:50:55] got situations in I it just feel like
[1:50:58] bones God I'm I'm surrounded by a valley
[1:51:01] of Bones my my child is and my this that
[1:51:05] and my body is just
[1:51:10] bones God look at them bones and ask a
[1:51:19] question the hand of the Lord was upon
[1:51:21] me and carried me out and Spirit of the
[1:51:22] Lord and set me down in the midst of the
[1:51:24] valley which is full of Bones and caused
[1:51:25] me I think this is too too hot uh and
[1:51:27] caused me to pass by them round about
[1:51:29] and behold there was very many in the
[1:51:32] open Valley and lo they were very dry
[1:51:35] not just
[1:51:39] dry and it said unto me son of
[1:51:44] man can these bones live and I I'm
[1:51:48] speaking to your
[1:51:50] circumstance I'm speaking to your
[1:51:52] situation can these bones
[1:51:54] [Music]
[1:51:57] live and I answered oh Lord God thou
[1:52:00] knowest like like like you going to put
[1:52:01] it off on God no no no no God didn't ask
[1:52:04] the question if he ain't already know
[1:52:06] the
[1:52:08] answer again he said unto me
[1:52:13] prophesy upon these bones now now I want
[1:52:16] you to get this I want you to get this
[1:52:19] he did not tell
[1:52:21] Ezekiel what he was amen he didn't give
[1:52:24] him no inspiration to to say something
[1:52:26] actually he just expected Ezekiel to
[1:52:28] open his own mouth and speak to the
[1:52:31] situation some of us waiting on God to
[1:52:33] give us something before we say
[1:52:35] something God waiting on you to say
[1:52:37] something before he do something it is
[1:52:40] what you say out your mouth that's going
[1:52:42] to release your
[1:52:45] restoration whatever restoration mean to
[1:52:48] you amen because this is personal right
[1:52:54] tired of the devil taking this and
[1:52:56] taking that I'm tired of
[1:52:58] it Satan give it
[1:53:00] back you got to prophesy out of your own
[1:53:07] mouth look at it now let's watch the
[1:53:10] scripture and again he said unto me
[1:53:12] prophesy upon these bones and say unto
[1:53:15] them oh ye Dry Bones hear the word of
[1:53:17] the Lord where was the word of the Lord
[1:53:18] it was in Ezekiel yes
[1:53:20] sir thus said the Lord God unto these
[1:53:23] bones behold I will cause breath to
[1:53:25] enter into you and ye shall
[1:53:30] live I'm going
[1:53:32] on and I will lay sin you upon you
[1:53:36] remember brother random says four stages
[1:53:39] of ezekiel's dry bones look at it it's
[1:53:40] right there in the scripture I will lay
[1:53:42] sin you upon you I underlined it for you
[1:53:43] made it
[1:53:45] easy I'mma lay sin you upon you you dry
[1:53:51] bones and will bring up flesh upon you
[1:53:54] I'm GNA give you some flesh we're gonna
[1:53:55] be able to identify you
[1:53:58] again and cover you with
[1:54:02] skin and after that I'mma put breath in
[1:54:07] you and when I get finished with these
[1:54:09] four
[1:54:12] stages ye shall
[1:54:15] live and ye shall know glory to God that
[1:54:20] I am the Lord h amen this ain't Joel's
[1:54:25] prophecy this ain't ezekiel's prophecy
[1:54:28] this is God using these prophets to
[1:54:30] bring this to
[1:54:35] pass so look at look at look at look at
[1:54:37] look at look at Ezekiel verse 7 so I
[1:54:42] prophesied and and how did they slip
[1:54:44] that one right in verse 7 you know what
[1:54:47] seven means right seven is a number of
[1:54:49] completion you a part of the completion
[1:54:53] you have to prophesy so I
[1:54:56] prophesied as I was
[1:54:58] commanded that you was commanded not to
[1:55:01] say nothing negative now you commanded
[1:55:03] to
[1:55:05] prophesy
[1:55:06] amen amen speak to your own family speak
[1:55:10] to your own body speak to your own
[1:55:14] finances speak to it praise God speak to
[1:55:18] it don't cry no more after the day speak
[1:55:23] and then after you speak move
[1:55:27] forward
[1:55:34] Hallelujah so I prophesied as I was
[1:55:37] commanded and as I prophesied as I was
[1:55:41] speaking there was a noise and behold a
[1:55:45] shaking and the bones came together bone
[1:55:49] to his bone and when I beheld below the
[1:55:52] senu and the flesh Came Upon them and
[1:55:56] the skin covered them above but there
[1:55:58] was no breath in
[1:56:04] them fourth
[1:56:06] light then he said un me prophesy unto
[1:56:09] the wind prophesy son of man and say to
[1:56:12] the wind thus sayith the Lord God now
[1:56:15] now now now let me just also drop this
[1:56:18] when can
[1:56:20] represent troublesome
[1:56:27] situations but it's okay because you
[1:56:30] know when Peter walked on the water he
[1:56:33] walked during
[1:56:37] trouble the wind actually didn't stop
[1:56:40] until he got back in the boat what
[1:56:43] caused him to sink is because he start
[1:56:45] looking around at the wind and the waves
[1:56:48] he was already walking on it sir exactly
[1:56:51] right a't no sister look at you already
[1:56:53] done walked out here on that that's why
[1:56:55] I say Jesus ain't pick no Peter up and
[1:56:56] say I'mma carry you back no get up and
[1:56:58] walk again because you walk
[1:57:02] before Oh I just tell your neighbor just
[1:57:06] touch
[1:57:07] them keep on walking tell them keep on
[1:57:15] walking
[1:57:21] Hallelujah Glory verse 9 then it said
[1:57:23] and me prophesy unto the wind prophesy
[1:57:25] son of man say to the wind thus say the
[1:57:27] Lord God come from the Four Winds oh
[1:57:29] breath and breathe upon these slain that
[1:57:31] they may live so I prophesied as as he
[1:57:33] commanded me and the breath came into
[1:57:35] them and they lived and stood up upon
[1:57:37] their feet an
[1:57:40] exceeding great
[1:57:47] Army the four stages of ezekiel's dry
[1:57:50] bones four of death death Messengers
[1:57:53] took it from us there's four death
[1:57:56] Messengers again are the palmerworm took
[1:57:58] the brotherly
[1:57:59] love the fruit which a fruit of the
[1:58:02] spirit the
[1:58:04] Locust took the leaves of divine
[1:58:07] Fellowship the cankerworm attacked the
[1:58:10] bark of the tree which was the doctrine
[1:58:12] or the religion of the tree and the
[1:58:16] caterpillar suck the life right
[1:58:20] out but in the four four
[1:58:22] stages of ezekiel's dry bones brother B
[1:58:25] say I wish we could just get to
[1:58:29] it in the first
[1:58:32] stage
[1:58:34] senu which was
[1:58:37] tendons hit next I believe yeah it's the
[1:58:40] tendons and these are the natural cords
[1:58:44] that hold the body
[1:58:46] together and let me tell you the way we
[1:58:48] treat one
[1:58:49] another we can either divide the body
[1:58:52] body because we connected now or we can
[1:58:56] we can we can hold a body together by
[1:58:58] how we handle one another don't let the
[1:59:00] Brotherly Love leave
[1:59:02] now the tendons the the the send you the
[1:59:05] tendons are what hold the body
[1:59:08] together the next thing was he said I'm
[1:59:11] G to bring flesh upon you and what what
[1:59:14] I what I what I what I what I put here
[1:59:16] and I'll read the scripture about it in
[1:59:17] a little bit it says um we need a heart
[1:59:20] of Flesh we is to be tenderhearted
[1:59:23] towards God and let me tell you if you
[1:59:25] are tenderhearted towards God you will
[1:59:28] also be tenderhearted towards your
[1:59:30] brother and your
[1:59:33] sister it brings back Divine
[1:59:36] Fellowship when I bring flesh upon you
[1:59:40] it brings Divine Fellowship here in the
[1:59:42] next stage he said I'm going to cover
[1:59:44] you with skin now this is amazing
[1:59:48] because skin is a natural covering of
[1:59:52] our flesh that's
[1:59:53] underneath and you know on a tree the
[1:59:56] bark is its
[1:59:58] covering so see in the stat where the
[2:00:01] ker worm am man that took the bark
[2:00:03] attack attacking the doctrine and
[2:00:05] religion God said in ezekiel's a stage
[2:00:08] four stage of his dry bones when I cover
[2:00:10] you with skin I am bringing back to
[2:00:12] covering yes sir
[2:00:19] amen the caterpillar suck the life
[2:00:25] out but the last thing that he told
[2:00:28] Ezekiel I'mma put breath in you and what
[2:00:32] is
[2:00:36] breath I'm going to put life right back
[2:00:39] in you when I breathe into you the
[2:00:42] breath of
[2:00:47] life if you want to see this process
[2:00:49] started you going have to open up your
[2:00:53] mouth and speak some things everybody in
[2:00:56] here know what the devil done stole from
[2:00:58] him it's time for him to give it
[2:01:04] [Applause]
[2:01:11] back I'm just going I'm I'm G read these
[2:01:15] scriptures here because Ezekiel 37
[2:01:18] before you get to chapter 37 you got to
[2:01:19] read chapter 36 and in chapter 36 it
[2:01:22] says something for I will take
[2:01:25] you from among the
[2:01:28] Heathen and gather you out of all
[2:01:30] countries and will bring you into your
[2:01:32] own land then will I sprinkle clean
[2:01:35] water upon you and ye shall be
[2:01:39] clean from all your
[2:01:42] filthiness from all your Idols will I
[2:01:45] cleanse you and this is the most
[2:01:47] important a new heart also will I give
[2:01:50] you your heart done got all messed up
[2:01:54] but a new heart will I give you and a
[2:01:56] new spirit will I put within
[2:01:59] you now when you get a new spirit don't
[2:02:02] mean you got the Holy
[2:02:04] Ghost but but God had to give you a new
[2:02:06] spirit so that Spirit can get along with
[2:02:08] the Holy Spirit a new spirit will I put
[2:02:11] within you and I will take
[2:02:14] away the Stony heart out of your flesh
[2:02:19] and I will give you an heart of Flesh
[2:02:23] and I will put my spirit within you and
[2:02:28] cause you to walk in my statutes and ye
[2:02:30] shall keep my judgments and do them you
[2:02:34] can't say you got the Holy Ghost and
[2:02:35] won't follow the
[2:02:37] word because the Holy Ghost will make
[2:02:39] you follow the word it gives you
[2:02:41] strength to follow the word amen and ye
[2:02:44] shall dwell see what happens is you got
[2:02:46] a new spirit not the Holy Spirit Holy
[2:02:47] Spirit follow word a new spirit will do
[2:02:50] things like I'mma do what the world do
[2:02:52] and I'm going do what the word do you
[2:02:53] it's a crow eat everything anything
[2:02:56] Buzzard eat anything everything but a
[2:02:59] but a dove can't eat like that an eagle
[2:03:01] can't eat like that
[2:03:03] amen I will put my spirit within you
[2:03:06] cause you to walk in my statutes and you
[2:03:07] shall keep my judgments and do them and
[2:03:09] ye shall dwell in the land that I gave
[2:03:11] to your fathers and ye shall be my
[2:03:12] people and I will be your
[2:03:15] God I'm laying senu upon you I'm
[2:03:18] bringing I'm bringing flesh upon you I'm
[2:03:20] covering you with skin then I'm going to
[2:03:22] breathe in you look at
[2:03:26] this brother brandom
[2:03:29] says restoration B tree the fourth light
[2:03:31] is to come that will bring forth the
[2:03:34] same signs watch justification brought
[2:03:37] back the pulp sanctification brought
[2:03:39] back the bark doctrine of Holiness what
[2:03:42] brought back the leaf Pentecostals what
[2:03:44] is it Pentecostals leaves clap their
[2:03:46] hands Joy rejoicing Pentecostal what the
[2:03:48] fourth was the word itself the word made
[2:03:51] flesh fruits of the proof of the
[2:03:53] Resurrection sign that Christ has
[2:03:54] finally after justification being
[2:03:56] planted sanctification being planted
[2:03:58] baptism of the Holy Ghost organizations
[2:04:00] died out and Christ has again sented
[2:04:03] himself like the cap of the
[2:04:06] pyramid amen he is the capping Stone it
[2:04:09] says the first line justification
[2:04:12] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:04:15] then coming of the cap what is it the
[2:04:17] Holy Ghost Bunch being honed out brother
[2:04:20] brother brother tro tells us how we have
[2:04:21] have to have that
[2:04:23] sandpaper we're being honed out glory to
[2:04:26] God Amen so that it can fit with the
[2:04:29] same kind of ministry he had when he
[2:04:32] went away that when he comes back it'll
[2:04:35] catch the whole thing in the Rapture
[2:04:36] where the Justified Sanctified baptism
[2:04:39] of the Holy Ghost the pyramid will stand
[2:04:42] again the house of God will live again
[2:04:45] the tree of life is growing
[2:04:48] again that ain't something that's going
[2:04:50] to happen is happening right
[2:04:54] now here's my last
[2:04:59] slide this was a prayer brother Brandon
[2:05:01] prayed in the message proven his word
[2:05:03] where we gathered our thought from get
[2:05:05] back in step and I'm praying this same
[2:05:07] thing says when we think of this Solomon
[2:05:11] in that great Millennium of the Jews
[2:05:13] that when no Nations Dar to touch them
[2:05:16] and the great gift of God was in the
[2:05:18] prophet till he made known to the queen
[2:05:22] all of her secrets of her heart now he
[2:05:24] praying this prayer about Solomon but we
[2:05:27] know that this happened in brother
[2:05:29] Brandon's Ministry he he you know
[2:05:31] secrets of the heart was revealed like
[2:05:33] crazy right uh and it was spot on every
[2:05:36] time every time um actually I I'll tell
[2:05:40] you I only know one
[2:05:43] time if you want to call it a Miss I
[2:05:46] I'll give it to you it's only one time
[2:05:48] he missed it somebody say well if he
[2:05:49] missed one time then he's he's out we
[2:05:51] not looking looking at the one million
[2:05:53] times that he got it there's only one
[2:05:55] time he missed and maybe I'm I might not
[2:05:57] even tell you he actually mispronounced
[2:05:59] somebody's
[2:06:03] name he told a person that their name
[2:06:05] was
[2:06:07] strong because in the vision what he saw
[2:06:11] was somebody doing something like this
[2:06:14] he didn't see the name he just saw a
[2:06:16] representation of the name and he say is
[2:06:18] your your name strong no stout
[2:06:23] and they mean the same
[2:06:29] thing they mean the same thing now and
[2:06:32] I'mma tell now I just gave that away I I
[2:06:35] should have made them go look for that
[2:06:36] in the message to find it that that's
[2:06:38] the only one you got I'm giving you one
[2:06:40] but for me that ain't enough to get me
[2:06:43] did you see a vision of somebody strong
[2:06:45] and call out day name try
[2:06:48] it you just try it sometime before you
[2:06:52] put him down you try to put yourself in
[2:06:54] his
[2:06:55] shoes amen just try it all over the
[2:06:58] world going all over the world and God
[2:07:00] just used him everywhere he went that
[2:07:02] was just to get our attention so that we
[2:07:04] would believe the word that he was
[2:07:05] preaching EXA
[2:07:07] right the great gift of God was in the
[2:07:09] prophet till he made known to the queen
[2:07:11] all of her Secrets all of her secrets of
[2:07:13] her heart nothing was withheld the great
[2:07:16] age showing and typing that there was a
[2:07:17] great age coming now father that was you
[2:07:19] not Solomon that was you in Jesus for he
[2:07:23] said God was in Christ reconciling the
[2:07:24] world to himself he was the beginning of
[2:07:27] the creation can I just add to this
[2:07:28] before I go further into prayer that
[2:07:30] wasn't brother brandom that was God in
[2:07:32] brother
[2:07:35] brandom his body was redeemed creation
[2:07:38] and now Through the Ages the church lost
[2:07:40] its first love and now in the last days
[2:07:42] you promised to call a little minority
[2:07:44] the little flock at the last days father
[2:07:46] our hearts are jumping and my heart's
[2:07:49] pounding when I think of that and know
[2:07:52] that your words are true none of them
[2:07:54] can fail let these people today
[2:07:56] understand that let the sinner seek you
[2:07:58] at this hour before the gates Clos and
[2:08:01] there will be no more time he says this
[2:08:03] let the
[2:08:04] Bride As she
[2:08:07] starts getting out of Step from
[2:08:11] this and that when the bride is getting
[2:08:14] out of Step from
[2:08:16] this and
[2:08:18] that may she come back in the step as
[2:08:21] the vision showed a few weeks ago notice
[2:08:23] this I sh when I shared the vision with
[2:08:25] you all brother Brown seeing the Bri get
[2:08:27] out of Step he said he was about to
[2:08:29] scream out get back and step but somehow
[2:08:33] the bride got back and step on her
[2:08:37] own and one of the reasons why I believe
[2:08:40] the bride going to get back and step is
[2:08:41] because she already been prayed
[2:08:43] for by a
[2:08:46] prophet let the Bride As she starts
[2:08:48] getting out of Step of this and and
[2:08:52] that may she come back into the step as
[2:08:57] the vision showed a few weeks
[2:09:01] ago and if the vision showed that
[2:09:05] somebody got back in
[2:09:09] Step the vision is thus saith the
[2:09:20] Lord
[2:09:26] I ask for the musicians to
[2:09:29] come we close amen our service today
[2:09:32] Father we are
[2:09:35] grateful for the truth of the
[2:09:40] word the fellowship we can have around
[2:09:43] this not just Fellowship just for head
[2:09:46] knowledge but it raises our expectations
[2:09:50] our faith
[2:09:52] to believe
[2:09:55] you
[2:09:56] for the
[2:09:59] impossible some of us are just like
[2:10:01] Ezekiel we're looking at a hopeless
[2:10:05] situation it looks
[2:10:08] dead it's like no no life can come to it
[2:10:12] but Lord when you ask Ezekiel the
[2:10:14] question son of man can these bones
[2:10:20] live
[2:10:22] he began to put it back on you and say
[2:10:25] Lord you know but father you wouldn't
[2:10:27] ask the question if you didn't already
[2:10:29] have the answer you told Ezekiel yeah
[2:10:32] but I need you to prophesy to it I need
[2:10:35] you to speak to it I'm going to bring
[2:10:38] sin you upon it I'm going to I'm going
[2:10:41] to uh uh give it
[2:10:44] flesh skin a
[2:10:46] covering I'm also going to uh put breath
[2:10:50] in it but you're going to have to called
[2:10:51] for these things
[2:10:53] Ezekiel and as he called for
[2:10:56] it it stood to his feet like a mighty
[2:10:58] marching
[2:11:01] Army God we're looking for these things
[2:11:03] to be manifested in our day and the
[2:11:06] prophet said that he in his prayer that
[2:11:09] Lord let the bride get back in Step as
[2:11:11] the vision showed she
[2:11:14] was and that's what our prayer is today
[2:11:16] God let the bride get back in Step as
[2:11:19] the vision is showed
[2:11:22] Lord uh uh it was to do we're expecting
[2:11:25] it father many have just made mistakes
[2:11:29] uh uh the enemies come in and Lord just
[2:11:32] uh confuse some of them but we believe
[2:11:34] God that you could come and straighten
[2:11:36] out the confusion you can fix it all
[2:11:38] there's anybody can fix it you can fix
[2:11:41] it so father we just commit all these
