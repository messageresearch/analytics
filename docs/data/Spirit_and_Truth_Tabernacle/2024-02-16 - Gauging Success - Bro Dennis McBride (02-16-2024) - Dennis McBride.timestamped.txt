[41:44] driver like that uh if I can fly I'll
[41:49] fly I I like to get there all

[41:57] sometimes you have to drive all right
[41:59] Amen to to go to the service of the Lord
[42:02] to to be of a service to God's people so
[42:06] it's a worthwhile drive in that respect
[42:10] sir but um during my military time I was
[42:13] stationed in California and the plane
[42:16] tickets for me and my wife was Sky I
[42:20] think for us to come home round trip it
[42:22] would have been like $1,600 or whatever
[42:25] and we didn't have much at that time you
[42:27] know young couple young in the military
[42:29] and what have you so we would have to
[42:32] drive but whenever we did that I would
[42:34] always make sure I had a 30 days uh
[42:37] period of
[42:39] time cuz I'mma take
[42:41] up about six days driving you know uh
[42:47] but it was one thing that I knew for a
[42:49] fact wasn't wasn't my lot in life and
[42:52] that was to be a truck
[42:55] driver I told my wife during those days
[42:58] I said I'll never be a truck
[43:02] driver I couldn't do it but for the ones
[43:05] that can do it praise the lord we need
[43:08] you and God gave you the makeup to be
[43:10] able to satisfy that need
[43:13] amen but God bless each one of you God
[43:16] bless brother Jack we really enjoyed him
[43:18] and his wife on last week uh weekend um
[43:22] as always I just he's always been a
[43:24] blessing to me his ministry and all and
[43:27] and so it's just good to have contact
[43:30] with genuine
[43:32] people real
[43:35] Christians you know the more experiences
[43:37] you have the older you get certain
[43:39] things become more and more
[43:41] valuable amen so I really appreciate uh
[43:45] I really appreciate him and I thank God
[43:47] for the opportunity to
[43:48] come uh when I got to the place that
[43:51] I'll be staying um I noticed how
[43:55] spotless it was
[43:57] was everything was properly
[44:00] placed I said whoever this is they clean
[44:03] like
[44:07] me and then he came to get his truck I
[44:11] saw it was brother quinnn I said now it
[44:13] makes
[44:15] sense all the washcloths and towels just
[44:18] fold just right I said man who is this
[44:22] had to shake
[44:25] their
[44:27] Glory hey man I just I even before the
[44:30] military I was kind of like in that mode
[44:32] I I don't know what it is but all right
[44:35] Amen Let Us stand together I don't want
[44:37] to keep you long
[44:40] tonight
[44:42] uh okay so let's let's go to Matthew
[44:46] chapter
[44:48] 6 and then from there we'll go
[44:51] to uh Matthew 8 and then we'll go to
[44:55] Psalms 85
[44:58] 4 Matthew chapter 6 and uh let's start
[45:03] at verse
[45:08] 24 everybody feeling okay tonight amen I
[45:12] just asked that you already sound like
[45:14] it so I enjoyed how you enjoyed the
[45:17] worship all right amen I'm not I'm not
[45:21] as get out in front as brother Jack and
[45:24] brother Diggs those are those brothers
[45:26] are real
[45:27] worshippers sometimes I got to fill
[45:30] in and I do
[45:32] it we have a good
[45:35] time I don't get out and do all the
[45:38] dancing and stuff I ain't as animated as
[45:40] that but I can hold a tune pretty good
[45:43] there so amen uh all right so verse 24
[45:48] it says no and and this really caught me
[45:50] Saints as I was reading this scripture
[45:53] because the Lord is tying verse 24 in
[45:57] with the rest of this and I I never saw
[45:59] it like that before he says no man can
[46:02] serve two
[46:04] masters for either he will hate the one
[46:07] and love the other he says or else he
[46:10] will hold to the one and despise the
[46:12] other he's saying it can't happen like
[46:15] these are the only
[46:16] options good right right he says ye
[46:20] cannot serve God and he calls it
[46:23] Mammon then he goes into verse 25
[46:26] therefore I say unto you so he's tying
[46:28] this in with that verse therefore I say
[46:31] unto you take no thought for your life
[46:33] right what ye shall eat or what ye shall
[46:36] drink nor yet yet for your body what ye
[46:38] shall put on it says is is not the life
[46:41] more than meat and the body than
[46:43] rainment behold the fowls of the air he
[46:46] says for they sow not neither do they
[46:48] reap neither gather into barns yet your
[46:50] heavenly father Feth them he says and
[46:53] are ye not much better than they
[46:56] verse 27 says which of You by taking
[46:58] thought can add one cubit unto your
[47:00] stature he says and why take you thought
[47:03] for rainment consider the lies of the
[47:05] field how they grow they toil not
[47:07] neither do they spin and yet I say unto
[47:10] you that even Solomon and All His glory
[47:12] was not AR raay like one of these
[47:15] wherefore if God so clothed the grass of
[47:17] the field which today is and tomorrow is
[47:20] cast into the oven shall he not much
[47:23] more clove you and notice what he it's
[47:26] on the end of this he says oh ye of
[47:28] little
[47:29] faith right he says in verse 31
[47:33] therefore take no thought saying what
[47:36] shall we eat or what shall we drink uh
[47:38] or where with shall we be clothed for
[47:40] after all these things do the Gentiles
[47:43] seek for your heavenly father knoweth
[47:45] that ye have need of all these things
[47:47] and he comes to this main
[47:49] point he says but seek ye
[47:52] first the kingdom of God and his
[47:55] righteousness and all these things shall
[47:59] be added unto
[48:02] you how many believe he knows what we
[48:05] need yes
[48:08] brother and he knows what we don't
[48:12] need can we say praise the
[48:16] lord we don't we don't know that about
[48:19] our own selves right we think we know we
[48:23] don't even know that about our own
[48:24] selves that's right we need somebody
[48:26] like God to tell us all right the last
[48:29] verse says Saints he says take therefore
[48:31] no thought for tomorrow for tomorrow
[48:33] shall take thought for the things of
[48:35] itself SS sufficient unto the day is the
[48:37] evil thereof Matthew chapter well yeah
[48:40] Matthew chapter 8 two verses verse 19
[48:44] and 20 and then we're going to go to
[48:45] Psalms 84 that's one verse Matthew 89
[48:50] and 20 it says and a certain scribe came
[48:52] and said unto him master I will follow
[48:54] thee with so ever thou goest Jesus saith
[48:58] unto him the foxes have holes and the
[49:00] birds of the air have nests but the son
[49:02] of man have nowhere to lay his head and
[49:05] Psalms 84
[49:07] and11 brother how you going to tie all
[49:09] this
[49:10] together I'm not I'm just going to lean
[49:12] on
[49:14] God I'm just saying what's on my heart
[49:16] just to lay a foundation and I believe
[49:18] he'll bring it together for us okay 84
[49:22] and 11 of Psalms it says for the Lord
[49:25] God is a son and shield it says the Lord
[49:28] will give Grace and Glory it says no
[49:32] good thing will he withhold from them
[49:34] that walk uprightly amen let's pray
[49:37] heavenly
[49:39] father I'm very grateful Lord God that
[49:42] you granted me traveling mercies Lord it

[49:47] prayer and Lord just how things unfolded

[49:56] will for me to be here Glory but now

[50:54] seated
[50:56] praise the Lord I feel
[50:59] good I'm tired but I feel
[51:02] good praise
[51:05] God the traffic coming here yes sir I
[51:08] said I should have did like I thought
[51:10] before I should have came earlier cuz I
[51:12] would have missed a lot of that traffic
[51:14] but I
[51:17] learned I learned am but by the grace of
[51:20] God we're here so now I want to just for
[51:23] a portion of time here want to work with
[51:26] this particular subject or topic um and
[51:29] I pray it be a blessing and I I pray
[51:31] that the young people are able to
[51:32] capture something from it um gauging
[51:36] success
[51:38] right gauging
[51:44] success depending on your upbringing you
[51:49] know where your roots are where you grew
[51:51] up at and what have you what school you
[51:53] went to what family you were born
[51:56] in right as you begin your days in this
[52:00] earth you begin to hear words at first
[52:02] you didn't know all of us right we
[52:04] didn't know what we
[52:06] heard we just heard noises yes and as we
[52:11] grew and as we matured we begin to
[52:14] understand through teaching right that's
[52:16] it words right and when we begin to
[52:19] understand words then as we mature and
[52:23] begin to understand more now that things
[52:25] that were being spoken to us we were
[52:27] able to understand them yes and once we
[52:30] reach the point of being able to
[52:32] understand the words that were spoken to
[52:35] us no matter where you were it begin to
[52:38] have an impact all right come on you
[52:41] begin to make decisions concerning what
[52:44] you're going to keep and take on to your
[52:47] like your environment begin to shape
[52:51] your perceptions of
[52:53] life and based off of what you were
[52:55] exposed to right that became your
[52:58] perspective right and you chose what you
[53:02] wanted to keep and hold on to and what
[53:04] you wanted to Dish aside that's right
[53:06] isn't that right right so your
[53:08] environment heavily laid into your
[53:10] makeup yes yes right so for instance if
[53:16] and I don't believe anybody here is in
[53:17] that situation but if you have a young
[53:20] person that's brought up in a a home
[53:22] that was
[53:24] racial they didn't know anything about
[53:26] that at one point right but the more
[53:30] they begin to understand concerning the
[53:32] things that were spoken around them and
[53:34] going on around them yes they begin to
[53:37] take on those same perceptions yes
[53:39] that's right right and they begin to
[53:41] look at life through that particular
[53:44] lens isn't that right so that's how each
[53:47] one of us
[53:49] are right amen I'm going to say maybe I
[53:52] could say were because I know all of us
[53:54] now we've been introduced to
[53:56] Christ but that that that that was a
[53:58] major shock to us all right because we
[54:02] had learned all these ways of the world
[54:04] perceptions of the world from people on
[54:07] right that's right and if you didn't
[54:08] grow up in a Godly home you you you you
[54:11] learned a lot of ungodly
[54:13] ways amen and then you comeing now now
[54:16] you come into the time of your life
[54:18] where now Christ is introducing himself
[54:20] to you and he literally has to deprogram
[54:24] us yeah that's right everything we ever
[54:27] learned our perceptions the people that
[54:30] we esteem the things that we esteem our
[54:33] priorities in life right amen right as
[54:36] Christ introduces himself to us through
[54:39] his word by his Spirit it begins to
[54:42] challenge our thought
[54:45] processes am amen so as a part of that
[54:49] from a young child no matter what age
[54:51] what grade or whatever there are certain
[54:53] things that are
[54:57] it begins to kind of communicate to you
[55:00] what success is in that stage and phase
[55:03] of your life all right all right yes sir
[55:07] yes the word success itself it means
[55:09] favorable or desired
[55:12] outcome it says a favorable or
[55:14] prosperous termination of attempts or
[55:17] Endeavors the accomplishment of one's
[55:19] goals so when you a young kid I got five
[55:24] then Young no
[55:26] more my oldest is 26 my youngest is 16
[55:30] and I got in between there of course all
[55:32] right but I remember things they went
[55:35] through as they were coming up listen
[55:38] now even in church my God my God cuz
[55:43] young people are young people yes
[55:45] brother until they're born again they're
[55:46] going to think like young people that
[55:48] they're impressionable they're they're
[55:50] influential you understand what I'm
[55:52] saying like and I can I can I just be
[55:54] real like
[55:56] transparent right there are a lot of
[55:58] things that are said and done that
[56:00] parents have no
[56:04] clue yeah cuz amongst kids or whatever
[56:07] they got this code amongst them too
[56:10] depend depending on what it is they
[56:12] ain't going to tell you what's really
[56:14] going on right right so it's things that
[56:17] are happening and unless by chance one
[56:20] of them just are affected to such a
[56:22] degree that where they say I got to tell
[56:24] my mom or my daddy you will never know
[56:26] what they're actually experiencing you
[56:28] don't know the pressures that they're
[56:30] under wow wow even at that young age
[56:33] because even at a young age amongst the
[56:35] peers
[56:37] there's there's a pressure to
[56:42] conform to be
[56:48] accepted and to an adult or older per
[56:50] and I hate I mean even even amongst
[56:52] older people amen yeah that that that
[56:56] that thing is there to where it's like
[56:58] they want to be
[56:59] included they want to be
[57:02] accepted you understand they don't like
[57:04] the feeling that comes along with with
[57:06] being rejected or or or or or kind of
[57:08] you know moved outside of
[57:11] circles right so now they want to kind
[57:13] of try to take on what or change
[57:16] themselves to fit the mold of what's
[57:19] needed for that group or that particular
[57:23] person my one of my sons I ain't going
[57:25] to call his name but he uh you know all
[57:28] the young young Brothers around the
[57:30] church began to get Michael
[57:33] Jordan's he didn't have a
[57:37] pair
[57:39] and they would make fun of
[57:42] them brother now I didn't know that this
[57:46] was going on but it got to a point to
[57:48] where it's so bothered him and he wanted
[57:51] to belong he wanted to fit in right
[57:55] so he came to me and he said
[57:58] dad he said the kids they they picking
[58:01] at me at
[58:04] church that hurt
[58:07] me sir so you say but you got to give
[58:10] Grace though because when there's not a
[58:12] conversion that's there I mean evil
[58:15] spirits are able to come in they don't
[58:17] understand what they're being moved by
[58:19] they don't understand what's what's
[58:21] causing them to have these mindsets and
[58:24] to handle other little kids like that
[58:28] God so he was
[58:30] hurt and I saw the hurt in his
[58:33] eyes and he just wanted a pair Jordan so
[58:36] that he wouldn't be picked
[58:39] at so to him at his age in order for him
[58:43] to be successful at that phase of his
[58:46] life he had to have a pair of
[58:49] Jordans because his peers molded that

[1:01:09] attitude you see listen I'm talking
[1:01:11] about gauging success now sometimes you
[1:01:14] might not have the car that you want to
[1:01:16] have you might not have the house you
[1:01:18] want to have you might not live in the
[1:01:20] neighborhood you want to live in but
[1:01:22] your attitude toward what you
[1:01:26] have if it mean that much to me a man
[1:01:31] how much more
[1:01:33] God and sometimes God allows the he
[1:01:36] allows you to have those those those
[1:01:39] those pre-
[1:01:41] blessings you don't know what all God
[1:01:43] God has in store for you you understand
[1:01:46] what I'm
[1:01:47] [Applause]
[1:01:51] saying so even though I'm talking about
[1:01:53] what I'm talking about I seen God give
[1:01:55] me things and it leaves me sitting
[1:01:57] wondering I'm like Lord you had this in
[1:02:00] your mind for
[1:02:02] [Music]
[1:02:02] [Applause]
[1:02:04] me I mean the very thing I
[1:02:08] wanted and I'm sitting there like Lord
[1:02:10] you had this in your mind for me you
[1:02:12] actually thought to give me
[1:02:15] [Applause]
[1:02:19] this now one thing that left me thinking
[1:02:21] like that is when we first got off
[1:02:23] Mercedes at
[1:02:25] SUV it's a older model now but when my
[1:02:29] wife first talking about G I said man
[1:02:31] what you talking about a Mercedes we a
[1:02:33] no you know how much some things
[1:02:37] cost but how about Saints the Lord had
[1:02:40] one packaged up right for
[1:02:42] us that was at a price that was amazing
[1:02:47] it up
[1:02:49] couldn't
[1:02:50] couldn't pull it out on the hood right
[1:02:53] away
[1:02:56] listen listen the guy sold it to us for
[1:03:01] 11,000 this was years ago he paid 84,000
[1:03:05] for it listen now he still owed
[1:03:08] 13,000 all we had was 11 he said you
[1:03:11] give me that and I'll put the other
[1:03:13] 2,000 with
[1:03:14] [Applause]
[1:03:18] it praise the Lord all right so back to
[1:03:22] the Air Force Ones
[1:03:26] so my son with a good
[1:03:28] attitude like it it it touched me now
[1:03:31] just to think about it he's my 26 year
[1:03:36] old he put it back in the box and he
[1:03:39] gave it to the guy he's smiling he's
[1:03:42] about to walk
[1:03:44] off and the guy said um hold on young
[1:03:49] man and he got a bag put the shoes in
[1:03:52] the bag and gave it to my
[1:03:56] [Music]
[1:03:59] son he saw that with his own eyes he
[1:04:03] knew he prayed for it and he saw God
[1:04:08] answer God cares about the young
[1:04:12] children so you can pray
[1:04:15] see I'm a witness you can pray you
[1:04:19] understand the truth and if God be
[1:04:21] pleased he'll give it to you amen
[1:04:24] exactly
[1:04:27] right praise the Lord
[1:04:30] hallelujah he's a good
[1:04:34] god oh man
[1:04:39] okay all right glory to God so I'm just
[1:04:44] kind of going according to how I feel
[1:04:46] led here all
[1:04:47] right when it comes to amongst you know
[1:04:51] you know some of the older people right
[1:04:53] young adults
[1:04:55] to older
[1:04:56] adults there's this there's this saying
[1:04:59] that I I I I've heard multiple
[1:05:02] times now don't get on me now cuz if
[1:05:05] it's something that you believe in and
[1:05:06] you you now this just me I'm just just
[1:05:08] brother McBride now but it just didn't
[1:05:11] set well with me right cuz you know how
[1:05:14] it is brother it's like you would hear
[1:05:16] certain people say things when all of a
[1:05:18] sudden scriptures come into my mind I'm
[1:05:20] say well that don't line up with that
[1:05:23] SC ain't trying to do that but it just
[1:05:25] happens like that and the thing of it is
[1:05:27] that I'm talking about is concerning you
[1:05:30] know your level of
[1:05:32] success your income
[1:05:35] level they say your income level will
[1:05:38] tend to be within a certain
[1:05:41] amount concerning the group or the your
[1:05:45] Associates that you hang with so if it's
[1:05:48] 50,000 your income level would tend to
[1:05:51] kind of
[1:05:52] fluctuate above or below
[1:05:55] 50,000 yeah
[1:05:58] right and that sounds good right but
[1:06:01] what they're doing is they're saying now
[1:06:03] you want to make sure that you make your
[1:06:05] circle if you want to make more money
[1:06:07] you want to make sure your
[1:06:09] circle has a high average income and in
[1:06:13] that way you can actually climb to those
[1:06:16] Heights as
[1:06:18] well isn't that
[1:06:21] right so now the scripture that we read
[1:06:23] here
[1:06:27] [Applause]
[1:06:31] here Matthew chapter 8 again uh verse 19
[1:06:35] and verse 20 verse 20 is my focus he
[1:06:38] says and Jesus saith unto him the foxes
[1:06:41] have hes and the birds of the air have
[1:06:43] Nest but the son of man have nowhere to
[1:06:46] lay his
[1:06:47] head what so if you applied that
[1:06:51] mentality on right
[1:06:56] like you said who better to have in your
[1:07:00] circle
[1:07:04] right they ain't even have enough money
[1:07:06] to pay their
[1:07:08] taxes but that didn't matter right he
[1:07:11] said go
[1:07:13] fishing sir and the first fish you pull
[1:07:15] up you listen now you go get the money
[1:07:19] out of there for me and for
[1:07:22] you super
[1:07:29] he sent them out two by two that's right
[1:07:32] don't take nothing with you that's right
[1:07:34] that's right that's right brother now if
[1:07:36] you go by
[1:07:37] that Cal and
[1:07:40] say what would you would have missed out
[1:07:42] on you you would have missed out on so
[1:07:44] much and I'm saying that to say in this
[1:07:47] hour you got to be careful with that
[1:07:50] right brother it sounds good you know
[1:07:52] it's going out there in the everybody
[1:07:54] want to make more money right Lord have
[1:07:57] Merc who don't want to make more money
[1:07:58] in here raise your
[1:08:00] hand my hand ain't rais I want to make
[1:08:04] more money
[1:08:05] right but there some things that we need
[1:08:08] to come to
[1:08:10] grasp I'm going call it a
[1:08:15] balance if you got a six figure income
[1:08:18] praise the Lord but you only got it
[1:08:21] because God gave it
[1:08:25] yes
[1:08:26] sir but what happens too often I'm
[1:08:29] talking about gauging success the Bible
[1:08:32] says they that compare themselves among
[1:08:34] themselves are not
[1:08:36] wise the Bible talks about
[1:08:39] covetousness yes sir amen come on
[1:08:44] Amen this is way too much
[1:08:48] brother way too
[1:08:52] much
[1:09:03] okay bear with me for one moment
[1:09:11] Saints Hebrews chapter 13 it says in
[1:09:14] verse 5 let your conversation be without
[1:09:18] covetousness but notice how it says this
[1:09:21] it says and be content
[1:09:24] yeah with such things and ye as ye
[1:09:27] have for he ha said I will never leave
[1:09:31] thee nor forsake
[1:09:33] thee in verse six we understand
[1:09:37] that it's talking about a promise he
[1:09:40] said be content with whatever you have
[1:09:42] for he ha
[1:09:43] said that means your provider the one
[1:09:46] that's able to make things happen he
[1:09:49] have said I will never leave you nor
[1:09:50] forsake you see Satan is always always
[1:09:54] trying to get people to be
[1:09:57] dissatisfied always want
[1:10:00] more Never
[1:10:03] Satisfied and then your life becomes
[1:10:05] plague your thought process becomes
[1:10:08] plagued with always trying to calculate
[1:10:10] how to get more Jesus and if you're not
[1:10:14] careful it moves into a
[1:10:17] perversion to where now that becomes a
[1:10:19] consuming
[1:10:21] thought that's why he said with said in
[1:10:24] in the in the opening scripture of
[1:10:25] Matthew that we read in Matthew 6 he's
[1:10:28] saying you can't serve two
[1:10:31] masters you can't he say you can't serve
[1:10:34] God and
[1:10:36] Mamon right wow now he say seek ye first
[1:10:40] the kingdom of God and his righteousness
[1:10:42] and all this will be added but he don't
[1:10:45] want us to put the cart before the
[1:10:47] horse Glory isn't that right listen now
[1:10:52] even amongst a lot of the younger adults
[1:10:54] and whatever right when it comes to
[1:10:56] making decisions in life oh
[1:10:58] Lord please bear with me
[1:11:01] right there
[1:11:03] are there are many that need the baptism
[1:11:07] of the Holy Ghost amen amen and they're
[1:11:11] going out trying to find husband and
[1:11:16] wives you understand what I'm saying but
[1:11:18] they don't even have the very
[1:11:21] core they just did a Mar a marriage uh
[1:11:25] Workshop
[1:11:27] now and man while you guys were talking
[1:11:29] that was just ringing in my spirit God
[1:11:32] has to be first in each individual's
[1:11:36] life he has to be the center he has to
[1:11:39] be really there cuz if he's not really
[1:11:42] there things can break out of
[1:11:45] control he's that Governor that helps to
[1:11:48] bring into check each partner yes sir
[1:11:52] you understand what I'm saying the word
[1:11:53] they go to marriage counselors and
[1:11:55] things of that nature that stuff ain't
[1:11:57] going to work like that you dealing with
[1:12:00] [Applause]
[1:12:03] Devils ain't no psychology no well put
[1:12:06] together statements it's going to reminy
[1:12:09] situations in the home you need the Holy
[1:12:12] Ghost you need God at the core he brings
[1:12:16] Harmony he brings peace right he gives
[1:12:20] Direction amen he softens hearts
[1:12:24] he helps he helps the husband and the
[1:12:25] wife to say forgive me amen he helps the
[1:12:28] husband and the wife to admit when
[1:12:30] they're
[1:12:32] wrong he cast Pride
[1:12:35] out so that real love and
[1:12:39] humility amen can abide in that home and
[1:12:42] that's where real power is right there
[1:12:45] amen amen amen
[1:12:47] amen
[1:12:49] amise God but when you try to go and
[1:12:52] Attain
[1:12:54] things you see the world put pressure on
[1:12:57] you it tells you what success supposed
[1:13:00] to look like so now everybody trying to
[1:13:03] go out and get the same kind of bags
[1:13:05] that got the same names on
[1:13:07] it the same kind of clothes that got the
[1:13:10] same names on it huh and unless you have
[1:13:15] that somehow people don't feel that they
[1:13:18] have come up to a successful level in
[1:13:20] life and it puts pressure on people to
[1:13:24] try to look like something that's really
[1:13:26] not
[1:13:27] there people that can't even afford it
[1:13:30] going and getting credit cards and
[1:13:32] whatever so that they can look like it
[1:13:34] because Society is painting a picture of
[1:13:38] success that people want to fit into
[1:13:41] exactly right so now these young
[1:13:44] Brothers some older ones too I ain't
[1:13:47] want to tap you on
[1:13:49] I'm I'm sorry
[1:13:51] brother I'm here but but I ain't here
[1:13:54] I'm
[1:13:55] sorry but they want to get these belts
[1:13:58] and because they pay so much money for
[1:14:00] it they want to make sure you see they
[1:14:02] got one on so they they can't wear the
[1:14:05] shirt out a shirt that's made to be out
[1:14:07] they can't wear it out they got to tuck
[1:14:08] the front in so when they walk around
[1:14:11] you got to see that you can see that
[1:14:12] Buckle cuz it means something to them
[1:14:15] for somebody to identify what you have
[1:14:17] on and give you
[1:14:20] props come on pre what is that
[1:14:23] in the sight of God has
[1:14:30] foolishness everybody all right I don't
[1:14:33] mean to yell Saints I I get excited
[1:14:39] sometime Lord have mercy GL to God Amen
[1:14:42] watch this
[1:14:44] Saints brother brandham says he endure
[1:14:47] the door inside the door he says and I
[1:14:50] always tell my young couples like this
[1:14:53] that happiness does not consist of how
[1:14:55] much the world's good you
[1:14:58] own but how contented you make yourself
[1:15:02] with the portion that's lotted to
[1:15:07] you that's the point I want to bring it
[1:15:09] to right
[1:15:12] there don't get upset with me
[1:15:16] now everybody ain't ordained to make six
[1:15:22] figures amen amen but it's nothing wrong
[1:15:25] with wanting six
[1:15:28] figures but it has to be put into its
[1:15:31] proper place so it's not taken into a
[1:15:34] perversion to the point to where if you
[1:15:36] don't get that now all of a sudden it's
[1:15:38] affecting
[1:15:39] you or it's causing an individual to put
[1:15:43] God out into a second third or fourth
[1:15:48] place because you trying to obtain this
[1:15:51] Mamon he said you can't serve two
[1:15:54] masters no sir we know that when we get
[1:15:57] too headr strong too locked in into a
[1:16:00] particular thing we're trying to achieve
[1:16:02] something suffers yes
[1:16:06] sir God truth and what normally ends up
[1:16:12] suffering especially when you done put
[1:16:14] your hard-earned money into
[1:16:16] something hold on now I done took out a
[1:16:19] loan I done invested $50,000 in that
[1:16:23] payment coming around this thing got to
[1:16:26] work Lord you can't even sleep
[1:16:32] good oh
[1:16:34] my you know that's the truth yeah real
[1:16:38] brother right am and because now you got
[1:16:40] this loan and them payments coming you
[1:16:42] know how much they all would have you
[1:16:44] you something got to
[1:16:46] happen oh God so you dedicate yourself
[1:16:49] oh God to making sure you do whatever
[1:16:52] necess
[1:16:54] necessary and I hate to say it like this
[1:16:56] but it happens like that sometimes we
[1:16:59] forget that God is the one that makes it
[1:17:01] happen Sira right meaning that's how we
[1:17:04] go about it we trying to connect this
[1:17:07] and pull this and do all this and that
[1:17:09] there and running ourselves ragged
[1:17:14] sir and our prayer life begins to
[1:17:17] suffer you ain't reading a word like you
[1:17:20] need to you understand yeah
[1:17:23] even if you read the word or listen to
[1:17:25] the message it's
[1:17:26] like quick quick quick quick quick hurry
[1:17:29] up and get something in just to try to
[1:17:31] appease your
[1:17:33] conscience but it's no real quality time
[1:17:36] yeah that's
[1:17:39] true Lord for those that are
[1:17:41] married what if you see your your
[1:17:43] significant other become
[1:17:46] distracted they with you but they ain't
[1:17:49] with you you in the same room you in the
[1:17:52] same in bed and you
[1:17:56] talking right and they're listening
[1:17:59] enough to be able to repeat what you
[1:18:01] said if you stop and say you ain't
[1:18:04] listening to
[1:18:05] me I heard what you said and they catch
[1:18:08] those last few word you said po
[1:18:13] [Music]
[1:18:15] po but you're not
[1:18:18] there now if we pick up on those things
[1:18:21] as PE as humans
[1:18:24] a't God
[1:18:26] aware of how present we are when we say
[1:18:30] we're spending time with him amen that's
[1:18:36] good praise the Lord
[1:18:39] Saints praise
[1:18:41] God we make
[1:18:44] plans
[1:18:45] right and like I said once it reaches
[1:18:49] that point then God begins not to be as
[1:18:52] much of an emphasis or a
[1:18:55] priority we somewhat put him there but
[1:18:58] we don't really put him there and
[1:18:59] consider him in the way that we
[1:19:02] should right he
[1:19:05] says lean not to your own
[1:19:09] understanding but in all your ways
[1:19:11] acknowledge Him He said he'll direct
[1:19:13] your paths you might be running yourself
[1:19:16] raging and God got a easier way it might
[1:19:20] be his will to give you the very thing
[1:19:23] yeah but if you go about it the wrong
[1:19:24] way if you don't include him in the way
[1:19:28] you make things
[1:19:29] harder far more difficult
[1:19:36] amen praise the Lord
[1:19:39] Saints he says go to now James 4:13 go
[1:19:43] to now ye that say today or tomorrow we
[1:19:45] will go into such a city and continue a
[1:19:47] year and buy and sell and get gain
[1:19:49] whereas ye know not what shall be on the
[1:19:51] tomorrow for what is your life it is
[1:19:54] even a vapor amen he says that appear
[1:19:57] for a little time and then vanisheth
[1:19:58] away he says for that ye ought to say if
[1:20:01] the Lord
[1:20:03] will how do you even know it's God's
[1:20:08] will just because we have something that
[1:20:10] we want to do yeah yeah who's to say
[1:20:14] that that's what God wants us to
[1:20:16] do but sometimes because you feel so
[1:20:19] strongly about it we try to make it
[1:20:22] God's will
[1:20:24] I really feel led about
[1:20:26] this Lord and if you ain't
[1:20:31] careful everybody listening yes sir if
[1:20:34] you ain't
[1:20:35] careful you'll go in the way of
[1:20:41] balum God gave an answer but because it
[1:20:44] wasn't quite the answer that he wanted
[1:20:47] and because of the desire that was
[1:20:49] already there you got to be careful how
[1:20:51] strong you allow your desires to be TR
[1:20:55] cuz it'll make you not be satisfied with
[1:20:57] God's initial
[1:21:00] answera and then you'll go to God again
[1:21:03] and it'll be a balum situation where he
[1:21:06] told balum it seemed like God was okay
[1:21:08] with it he go
[1:21:11] ahead go it's okay go ahead and balum
[1:21:14] could have said clearly God told
[1:21:18] me but what was the end result
[1:21:21] Saints you
[1:21:23] understand those things happen they're
[1:21:26] happening right now the truth sir even
[1:21:30] when it comes the
[1:21:33] partners with young with single people
[1:21:35] the Bible is very clear very C it says
[1:21:39] you you if you're single and you want a
[1:21:41] husband or a wife the Bible pretty much
[1:21:43] the Bible say you shouldn't even be
[1:21:45] thinking about that right off he said
[1:21:48] you should attend upon the Lord without
[1:21:51] distraction yes you understand because
[1:21:54] that Foundation that relationship with
[1:21:57] God is not there you will make wrong
[1:22:01] choices and how many of us know for a
[1:22:03] fact that those things have happened and
[1:22:07] are happening right
[1:22:08] now being led by the flesh through demon
[1:22:12] powers through carnal
[1:22:14] lust right amen amen well man they look
[1:22:18] just like I want them to
[1:22:20] look that's exactly like they got the
[1:22:23] eyes the eyebrows the hair the bill look
[1:22:27] how much money they
[1:22:28] make they got they got six figures B
[1:22:32] everything this young man right here is
[1:22:35] prime like Prime
[1:22:40] selection look at this sister she got
[1:22:42] everything everything in place amen and
[1:22:47] you ain't even listen it's so in place
[1:22:49] and so up your line you ain't hardly
[1:22:52] praying about
[1:22:53] nothing you you you feel you acting like
[1:22:55] you done got dust say at the
[1:23:01] Lord is't that
[1:23:04] right but brother Brandon watch this
[1:23:07] Saints Lord have mercy I'm getting ready
[1:23:09] to
[1:23:11] close brother brandom he said he married
[1:23:14] several young couples and it's two in
[1:23:16] particular he pointed out the first one
[1:23:19] he pointed out they had 14 karat gold
[1:23:22] door
[1:23:23] knobs is't that right bro that's
[1:23:27] right their weedding was
[1:23:30] magnificent and right after all that
[1:23:33] fluff and flush and all that stuff
[1:23:36] brother brandom said he went to go and
[1:23:37] check on them and while he going to
[1:23:40] check on them they carrying on and
[1:23:43] fussing and
[1:23:44] everything why were they fussing like
[1:23:47] that cuz the foundations wasn't
[1:23:51] righten you understand what I'm saying
[1:23:53] it was built off of the wrong
[1:23:57] things so when trying times come in when
[1:24:00] situations arise it just resorts to a
[1:24:03] carnal frame of mind and everything just
[1:24:07] happening just being carried out all In
[1:24:08] the Flesh controlled by demon
[1:24:12] spirits but then he said what they had
[1:24:14] was pretty much a facade it was a fake
[1:24:17] show cuz once he knocked on the door and
[1:24:20] they came they came holding hands they
[1:24:22] didn't know that he had already seen
[1:24:23] them in their fight and he asked them
[1:24:26] how is everything going oh everything is
[1:24:29] going good brother
[1:24:31] Brandon he said there are a lot of
[1:24:33] couples that are just like
[1:24:36] that but then the one that didn't have
[1:24:39] that I'm talking about gauging
[1:24:41] success they had all the material wealth
[1:24:45] 14 karat gold door
[1:24:48] knobs you understand what I'm saying
[1:24:51] Accord to the world man they were
[1:24:54] successful they got everything they ever
[1:24:57] wanted to their fingertips Fest doctors
[1:25:00] anything they didn't have real love they
[1:25:03] didn't have
[1:25:05] God so were they really
[1:25:07] successful but this poor couple he said
[1:25:11] the young man couldn't even afford to
[1:25:12] get a
[1:25:14] preacher to marri them so his friend his
[1:25:18] dad knew brother brandham and so he
[1:25:20] married the young man didn't charge
[1:25:22] anything or whatever but he said where
[1:25:24] you going to take him at young man take
[1:25:26] her at young
[1:25:27] man I'll find something and he found a
[1:25:31] box car
[1:25:33] yeah their walls I think were you know
[1:25:36] set up with newspaper right and their
[1:25:39] table was made out of cardboard
[1:25:41] boxes so brother Brandon went to visit
[1:25:44] them and it was a totally different
[1:25:46] story they had real
[1:25:49] love sir they had something that was
[1:25:51] genuine
[1:25:54] watch what he said about
[1:25:57] this and I stood there and turned around
[1:26:00] this way and looked up on the top of the
[1:26:02] hill and I could see the home of the
[1:26:03] other the Steeples top of the house I
[1:26:06] thought which is the rich man which one
[1:26:09] he says would you rather take Billy if
[1:26:11] you were going to take your choice let
[1:26:13] me have a real true wife one that loves
[1:26:16] me let me live down here in a box car
[1:26:19] for I tell you happiness and content
[1:26:22] money cannot buy money cannot buy love
[1:26:26] that's the real
[1:26:29] things
[1:26:33] yeah praise the Lord Saints I'mma leave
[1:26:36] you on this note I got other things here
[1:26:38] that I could touch on but I'm I'm going
[1:26:41] kind of omit those things for now for
[1:26:43] time sake and I'm going come down to
[1:26:45] this one little thing here that that
[1:26:48] there's certain things and I'm not
[1:26:49] saying it's intentionally done
[1:26:53] but I just don't hear it a whole
[1:26:58] lot because most people really want to
[1:27:02] have nice things and whatever and
[1:27:03] there's nothing wrong with having nice
[1:27:05] things right but you don't want to be
[1:27:08] consumed by you don't want to lust
[1:27:11] after you don't want to be
[1:27:14] Covetous right to the point to where if
[1:27:16] God don't want you don't even you don't
[1:27:18] even think to ask God about it you just
[1:27:21] want it and you do whatever you got to
[1:27:22] do to try to get it right but on that
[1:27:25] note bringing a balance watch what
[1:27:27] brother brandham says here in the
[1:27:28] exposition of the seven Church a samran
[1:27:30] church
[1:27:32] age he says the people of God are not
[1:27:34] Material
[1:27:37] minded he says they are christm
[1:27:40] minded they do not seek the treasures
[1:27:43] that are below they seek those
[1:27:46] above it is absolutely true the majority
[1:27:49] of Christians are not wealthy right
[1:27:53] right everybody hearing
[1:27:55] this I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm kind of slowing
[1:27:58] down here for a reason because there are
[1:28:01] a lot of people that are not
[1:28:03] satisfied with their present
[1:28:07] State you can want to do better but
[1:28:10] watch how you allow your thoughts to
[1:28:14] run CU it can move you into covet
[1:28:17] covetousness it can move you into
[1:28:20] ungratefulness exactly right now what
[1:28:23] you have you begin to look down on it
[1:28:26] you look you look at somebody else's car
[1:28:29] you say my car ain't like that now all
[1:28:32] of a sudden you begin to treat your car
[1:28:35] different the car that God gave
[1:28:38] you because you're not as into it you
[1:28:42] don't want to wash it you don't want to
[1:28:44] do the maintenance on it you let it be
[1:28:47] dirty but God gave you that car and God
[1:28:51] is watching how you're handling what he
[1:28:53] gave you he's watching your attitude
[1:28:56] toward it because he may have something
[1:28:58] more he want to bless you with but if
[1:29:01] you ain't taking care of the little
[1:29:03] things seemingly insignificant things
[1:29:06] you understand what I'm saying sir I've
[1:29:09] heard people tell me brother if the Lord
[1:29:12] bless me with a million dollars man I'll
[1:29:15] help the bride I'll do this and that and
[1:29:17] I sit there and I look I'm like well
[1:29:19] what you doing right now kind of is a
[1:29:22] a
[1:29:23] precursor to tell what you would do if
[1:29:25] you had more you can't fluff God up Sir
[1:29:30] speak all these sweet things in God's
[1:29:32] ears and oh yeah oh son I know you will
[1:29:34] do God already know
[1:29:37] us I'mma hit one more thing after I read
[1:29:41] this actually let me move that in right
[1:29:45] now all right everybody okay yes
[1:29:48] sir I want to slip this in here really
[1:29:51] quick
[1:30:00] quickly this is the message doors inside
[1:30:02] the door brother brandom says I'm so
[1:30:04] glad that he supplies our every need he
[1:30:08] promised he he promised he says he
[1:30:10] promised he would do that he says now he
[1:30:12] never promised that he would Supply our
[1:30:15] wants he didn't promise that but he
[1:30:18] still does it at times you don't even
[1:30:20] know when it's coming yeah but when it
[1:30:23] comes you just rejoice in that moment
[1:30:25] you thank him for what he allowed to
[1:30:27] what he gave you what he allowed you to
[1:30:29] have and you be grateful for it sir
[1:30:31] right cuz he didn't have to do it he
[1:30:34] says he never promised that he would
[1:30:35] Supply our wants but it was it was our
[1:30:38] needs that he would Supply I'm so glad
[1:30:41] of that because there's many times that
[1:30:43] we want things that's not good for
[1:30:47] us you may think you really want
[1:30:49] something or need something I'mma read
[1:30:51] on down he says I was thinking just uh I
[1:30:54] was thinking of that he says the other
[1:30:56] day when I was trying to shave with a
[1:30:58] straight razor and I was very awkward
[1:31:00] with it and I had never undertaken it
[1:31:02] before and my little boy Joseph was
[1:31:05] saying Daddy let me do it he says 5
[1:31:07] years old he says and I thought now and
[1:31:10] he cried he actually cried because I
[1:31:12] wouldn't let him have the
[1:31:14] razor but you see I knew better than to
[1:31:18] do that and that's the way God is he
[1:31:20] said sometimes we think we we must have
[1:31:23] a certain thing and we'd only hurt
[1:31:25] ourselves with
[1:31:28] it there was a job I thought I
[1:31:31] wanted I was done wrong with it I should
[1:31:34] have got the job at least in my mind I
[1:31:37] trained the person that got the job how
[1:31:39] I train you and you got a higher paying
[1:31:41] job than me
[1:31:42] now I'm just going to be real with
[1:31:46] you to make sure he was a white
[1:31:50] guy
[1:31:52] now I don't have no racism mindsets like
[1:31:56] they ain't none of that in me at
[1:31:57] all
[1:32:03] but I made you what you
[1:32:06] are and you going to get put in that and
[1:32:09] I
[1:32:14] what so I was
[1:32:18] bothered listen my name Dennis right his
[1:32:22] name was
[1:32:24] Dennis nice guy good guy but I I had
[1:32:27] problems like how in the world it's
[1:32:29] going to happen I'm just getting off
[1:32:31] throw out of sorts and
[1:32:32] whatever and the Lord rebuked me Saints
[1:32:35] because there was another job that
[1:32:38] opened that was a job he intended for me
[1:32:41] to
[1:32:42] have once I got that job and I was in it
[1:32:47] I realized it was a better job than the
[1:32:49] other job was amen
[1:32:52] and you know what the Lord did for me he
[1:32:54] gave me a message to preach thou shall
[1:32:56] not
[1:32:58] covet I did I went to the church and I
[1:33:01] preached I was he taught me a lesson yes
[1:33:04] sir all
[1:33:06] right wrap up this last one here he says
[1:33:09] the people of God are not material-
[1:33:11] minded they are Christ minded they do
[1:33:13] not seek the treasures that are below
[1:33:15] they seek those above and it he says
[1:33:16] it's absolutely true the majority of
[1:33:18] Christians are not wealthy rather they
[1:33:20] are on the Poor Side side he says it was
[1:33:22] so in jesus' day it says and he says it
[1:33:26] was true in the day in Paul's day and it
[1:33:28] should be true
[1:33:30] today everybody heard that yes sir
[1:33:33] that's not brother McBride I just
[1:33:35] thought it was
[1:33:37] interesting cuz many people are not
[1:33:40] satisfied with where they are and they
[1:33:42] find themselves being
[1:33:45] discontented Paul said I've learned to
[1:33:47] abase and to abound no matter what state
[1:33:49] no matter what hand God allows me to be
[1:33:52] dealt I've learned there with to be
[1:33:55] content can we say praise the
[1:33:58] Lord he says rather they are on the Poor
[1:34:01] Side it was it was so in Jesus day it
[1:34:03] was so it was true in Paul's day and it
[1:34:05] should be true today oh it is not too
[1:34:07] true today for the layer de seean agees
[1:34:09] one of vast wealth where often the
[1:34:11] Criterion of spirituality is an
[1:34:14] abundance of Earthly Goods my how rich
[1:34:17] the church is in Goods but how poor in
[1:34:21] spirit
[1:34:24] what happens is people begin to run
[1:34:25] after these things it begins to consume
[1:34:28] them and their inner man is
[1:34:32] suffering all because they're being led
[1:34:36] by what's being impressed upon them as
[1:34:40] the meaning of
[1:34:41] success they're running after these
[1:34:44] things trying to obtain trying to
[1:34:46] satisfy this life with all kinds of
[1:34:48] material stuff that's not everything
[1:34:51] everybody but there are some people that
[1:34:53] that applies to that's right and their
[1:34:56] relationship with God is
[1:34:58] suffering God doesn't even have real
[1:35:02] Fellowship Fellowship is very important
[1:35:04] to God you understand what I'm saying
[1:35:07] like we haven't even attained the levels
[1:35:10] listen that God is calling for everybody
[1:35:13] in this room I believe all of us are
[1:35:16] bride you feel the pull of God he's
[1:35:20] calling you to a deeper prayer life he's
[1:35:23] calling you to get into your word more
[1:35:25] meaning to spend time he want to reveal
[1:35:27] things to you he want to one onone time
[1:35:30] we make sacrifices for everything else
[1:35:34] you understand what I'm saying it can be
[1:35:35] something new pop on the scene and we'll
[1:35:37] make time for that depending on the
[1:35:40] value that we feel it
[1:35:44] holds and God is
[1:35:47] patient and he's a gentleman and he's
[1:35:50] having to deal with things and he
[1:35:51] shouldn't even have to deal
[1:35:54] with isn't that right Saints all of us
[1:35:58] can stand and have a closer walk with
[1:36:00] God he's calling for it it's going home
[1:36:03] time he's putting finishing touches on
[1:36:06] his
[1:36:08] bride you understand I ain't telling you
[1:36:12] anything you don't already
[1:36:14] know I'm just bringing to the
[1:36:17] remembrance certain Needful Things
[1:36:20] praise God that maybe we can consider
[1:36:22] re-evaluate kind of see where we
[1:36:25] are and then give God cuz he want to
[1:36:28] have the
[1:36:30] preeminence cuz when he has that
[1:36:32] preeminence d man we he going to take us
[1:36:34] places brother brandom said that I'm the
[1:36:36] one that get in God's
[1:36:39] way he said when I get out of God's way
[1:36:42] God can do things that William Brown
[1:36:44] don't even know nothing
[1:36:46] about God want to take us to level
[1:36:48] Saints we're used to living on certain
[1:36:51] levels
[1:36:52] but there is higher levels higher ples
[1:36:55] there's gifts in this church
[1:36:58] Supernatural spiritual gifts amen amen
[1:37:03] how many believe
[1:37:04] that there's Eternal purposes Eternal
[1:37:10] occupations that God wants us to invest
[1:37:12] in put the work in so that we can see
[1:37:17] results we're more than just whatever
[1:37:20] our natural occupation is but even
[1:37:22] within our natural occupation Eternal
[1:37:25] purpose is are serve cuz there are
[1:37:27] people that are there that God ordain
[1:37:29] for you to cross paths
[1:37:31] with and he's going to use you to help
[1:37:34] to bring a witness
[1:37:35] to no matter which way it falls
[1:37:38] sometimes it's a witness for their Grace
[1:37:40] and sometimes it's a witness that'll
[1:37:42] be a condemnation to them in the day of
[1:37:45] judgment the voice of many Waters sir
[1:37:48] amen God bless you thank you for your
[1:37:50] time
[1:37:52] I pray something was said that was just
[1:37:54] help that would help just a little bit

[1:38:00] focus I want to put God first I want to
[1:38:03] give him what he
[1:38:05] deserves and I'm seeing

[1:38:22] for all the wasted
[1:38:25] time cuz it's things I gave myself to
[1:38:28] that came up to be

[1:38:33] to God who can take us places that we
[1:38:36] can't even
[1:38:37] imagine you talking about happiness you
[1:38:39] talking about fulfillment you talking

[1:40:27] sorts of heartache and strain and stress
[1:40:30] and
[1:40:32] tension it'll help us to be more relaxed
[1:40:35] even as your word says father it'll give
[1:40:37] us
[1:40:39] peace in the midst of
[1:40:43] adversities may we take full benefit
[1:40:46] Lord full advantage of the benefits that
[1:40:48] you've laid before us father we love you
[1:40:50] we love one another Lord help us to love
[1:40:53] one another more help us to love you
[1:40:54] more have your way in our lives in the
[1:40:57] mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:40:59] Christ we ask all these things and we
[1:41:02] pray amen God bless you Saints
[1:41:04] appreciate
[1:41:12] you we thank the Lord for brother
[1:41:15] McBride uh on tonight
[1:41:18] and sermon I believe all of us amen got
[1:41:22] something out of and how we are gauging
[1:41:26] uh
[1:41:27] success
[1:41:29] um the um quote that he was reading
[1:41:33] there at the end out of the church age
[1:41:34] book where brother Brandon was just kind
[1:41:37] of um saying that we uh determine how
[1:41:43] blessed uh of God we are by the things
[1:41:46] that we have attained or the things that
[1:41:49] we have achieved and you know even when
[1:41:51] you think about uh social media uh it
[1:41:55] pushes us in a place where we have to
[1:41:59] try to achieve what the next person just
[1:42:03] achieved and uh all of it's very very uh
[1:42:06] natural we're going after this and going
[1:42:08] after and people always showing what we
[1:42:11] call their best
[1:42:13] life amen it's not their real life it's
[1:42:17] the life that they want to have uh
[1:42:20] sometimes s people posting pictures of
[1:42:22] things that don't even belong to them
[1:42:24] somebody gave it to them and using their
[1:42:27] influence right it's the truth anyhow
[1:42:29] using their influence and they don't own
[1:42:31] it but they going you going to try to
[1:42:33] own it because they got it right and and
[1:42:35] we keep running after these things and
[1:42:37] running after these things and don't
[1:42:39] realize that uh it's leading us further
[1:42:41] and further away from God uh I thought
[1:42:44] this was a perfect sermon and and young
[1:42:46] people praise the
[1:42:49] Lord
[1:42:52] if if there's nothing that you get out
[1:42:55] of it I I want you to always remember
[1:42:57] seek
[1:42:59] first the kingdom of God put God first
[1:43:03] in everything you do put him first when
[1:43:07] we were when we were coming up we made
[1:43:09] sure that we got jobs that did not take
[1:43:11] us out of church we sought first the
[1:43:14] kingdom of God and and if you if you
[1:43:16] start out that way when you go through
[1:43:18] life and the other pressures that are
[1:43:19] come in life you always keep got first
[1:43:21] nothing come before God and not just
[1:43:24] going to church I mean brother brother
[1:43:25] McBride even took it a little further
[1:43:27] how much time after church do you get a
[1:43:29] chance to spend time with
[1:43:31] God sometimes we have so many things
[1:43:33] that's just cloud in us and God can't
[1:43:36] speak to us we actually clogged it up
[1:43:40] God didn't clog it up decisions that we
[1:43:43] made clog us up where God can't speak to
[1:43:46] us right we got choices to make amen
[1:43:50] seek seek first the kingdom of God all
[1:43:54] its
[1:43:55] righteousness and everything else will
[1:43:59] be taken away from
[1:44:02] you everything else will be subtracted
[1:44:05] from you now ain't what the Bible say if
[1:44:08] you put God first God will add to
[1:44:12] everything you got I I I got a little
[1:44:16] something in my Bible I remember when
[1:44:17] brother chendi came here and preach and
[1:44:20] he say write some things down put in
[1:44:21] your Bible that you want God to to do
[1:44:24] and and stick it on a certain scripture
[1:44:26] there in the book of kings and and one
[1:44:28] of the things that that I I got in my
[1:44:30] Bible and I'm just waiting on the Lord

[1:49:53] the holy spirit that sent the

[1:50:04] gain from what has been shared here
[1:50:08] tonight Lord I as the young people I
[1:50:10] pray Lord that they would understand
[1:50:13] just the the simple
[1:50:15] principle of seeking you
[1:50:18] first God and not allow anything else in
[1:50:21] this world to become a
[1:50:24] distraction it's so easy for it to
[1:50:27] happen but God if we keep you first you
[1:50:30] told us everything would be
[1:50:33] added every need would be
[1:50:36] supplied sometimes it might not be in
[1:50:38] our timing but it'll always be in your
[1:50:41] timing so help us to just be patient and
[1:50:43] to wait on you God and so we're saying
[1:50:46] even as single people our foundation has
[1:50:49] got to be right
[1:50:50] the Holy
[1:50:52] Spirit Lord at the center of our Lives
[1:50:55] governing and guiding us and directing
[1:50:57] us so important father without that no
[1:51:00] matter what we say no matter what we do
[1:51:02] Lord we just won't have enough to make
[1:51:04] it but Lord we trust that father our
[1:51:07] Attention our Focus will be more on
[1:51:10] you as we as we put our mind on you then
[1:51:13] you'll send the mate at the time that
[1:51:15] you have for us to have that mate but
[1:51:18] Lord we want to keep our attention
[1:51:20] on you
[1:51:21] Jesus father I just pray that you bless
[1:51:24] brother McBride that you give back to
[1:51:26] him and thank you for him laboring to
