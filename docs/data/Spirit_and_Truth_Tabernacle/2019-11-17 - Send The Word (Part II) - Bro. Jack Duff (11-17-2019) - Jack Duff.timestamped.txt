[1:03:50] of God brother the song was mentioning
[1:03:53] we just we would hit a subject there on
[1:03:59] Friday night and and I was going to move
[1:04:03] away from I had something else that I
[1:04:05] wanted to speak but it just seemed like
[1:04:08] after we hit the subject a lot of other
[1:04:10] things just started to start again the
[1:04:12] kind of come out and and what I felt
[1:04:15] this morning that I would do is try to
[1:04:19] just bring a little bit of it back
[1:04:20] around for us for those that work here
[1:04:24] on Friday because I'd love for us all
[1:04:26] it'd be underneath the same anointing
[1:04:28] and I think it's very very important you
[1:04:31] never know when God I'll speak in man we
[1:04:34] were we were here and you know I just I
[1:04:38] took this dog on sin the word and you
[1:04:41] know after we finish church we was you
[1:04:44] know I think we you know I would
[1:04:46] preached and then brother Solomon came
[1:04:50] up and he testified and brother Jerry
[1:04:53] came up and he testified and listen they
[1:04:56] only came up and she testified and then
[1:04:59] sister Dixon went outside and just
[1:05:02] carried the atmosphere here
[1:05:08] we was freezing gone outside just by the
[1:05:18] old shirt and I was like praise God all
[1:05:24] right and you know he was just digging
[1:05:26] she put down a walk of just put
[1:05:29] everything down gotta lift my hands and
[1:05:32] let's begin the praise the Lord and just
[1:05:35] a wonderful atmosphere and walked on to
[1:05:37] the coward I know walking now is this I
[1:05:43] say Lord this is church and we were just
[1:05:48] we were just over a medal with joy with
[1:05:51] just the presence of the Lord and not
[1:05:54] that we necessarily try to recreate that
[1:05:56] but what I do want to do is again try to
[1:05:59] bring the entire church underneath the
[1:06:01] anointing of what we were under for
[1:06:05] Friday night and I just believe that the
[1:06:08] Lord will bless a man power
[1:06:13] you know our service is already blessed
[1:06:16] it is already blessed it so let's just
[1:06:19] read I got one scripture to read a man
[1:06:21] this is John 15 amen and 7 John 15 and 7
[1:06:27] praise the Lord and man the Bible
[1:06:33] declares if ye abide in me and my words
[1:06:42] abide in you and this is just powerful
[1:06:48] to me there's first is the fighting in
[1:06:52] him and then his word has to be in you
[1:06:56] all right if he is bothering me and my
[1:06:59] words abide in you ye shall ask what ye
[1:07:04] will and it shall be done unto you glory
[1:07:11] to God
[1:07:11] a male I say man I say man I believe
[1:07:16] God's Word I believe God's Word I
[1:07:20] believe God's Word a man let's pray
[1:07:26] father we thank you for the word of the
[1:07:28] Lord and we thank you for the anointing

[1:08:51] man a man god bless you can be seated
[1:09:03] so we were talking on the subject a man
[1:09:07] on Friday night of sin the word a man's
[1:09:13] sin the word and we're just trying to
[1:09:18] bring to everybody's a man attention
[1:09:24] just the power a man that that's that's
[1:09:27] in the word of y'all forgive me let me
[1:09:29] just take a step back here I forgot to
[1:09:31] read this card but special thanks it's
[1:09:37] easy to say thank you but it's hard to
[1:09:38] find a way to let you know what warmth
[1:09:41] there is behind those words today but
[1:09:44] somehow hope this message helps to show
[1:09:46] at least in part the very gratitude
[1:09:49] that's that's felt deep in the heart
[1:09:52] because your thoughtfulness and all the
[1:09:54] kindness that you show will always be
[1:09:57] remembered and appreciated so thank you
[1:09:59] this is from sister Erica and I to the
[1:10:02] church we want to thank you all again
[1:10:03] for a man your wonderful surprise that
[1:10:06] you gave us a member of the appreciation
[1:10:09] amen we just really appreciate your
[1:10:11] night got a little something that I
[1:10:13] wrote and then we'll put it on the board
[1:10:14] so if you want to take time to read it
[1:10:17] you certainly can
[1:10:18] Amen but I just we want to express on
[1:10:20] things sin the word is what we are
[1:10:24] talking about and and the Lord just
[1:10:28] really just kind of helped us look at a
[1:10:30] couple things and just trying to get us
[1:10:32] again to understand the importance of
[1:10:35] the word of God and and and and the
[1:10:39] power that is in the Word of God there's
[1:10:45] power in the word that is not found
[1:10:47] anywhere else
[1:10:49] praise God there's power there that's
[1:10:53] never found anywhere else there's
[1:10:54] encouragement there that you will never
[1:10:57] find anywhere else there is strength
[1:11:00] there that you will never find anywhere
[1:11:03] else and and and the other thing I will
[1:11:06] tell you there is a present
[1:11:10] all the word and in the word right there
[1:11:16] is an anointing that is that is in the
[1:11:19] Word of God that you're not gonna find
[1:11:21] anywhere else so it's very important for
[1:11:23] us to understand this right and so this
[1:11:26] is some let me just read a little
[1:11:28] something here from from the properties
[1:11:30] preaching from the endtime sign scene
[1:11:34] I'm a paragraph 83 it says if you're
[1:11:37] here and sick and you believe that God
[1:11:40] will grant you divine healing you just
[1:11:44] place that word a man you just place
[1:11:47] that word I'm the Lord that he loves all
[1:11:50] that diseases Lord I believe it
[1:11:53] watch what takes place amen amen
[1:11:57] I remember there was a sister who had a
[1:12:00] prayer cloth thing she was over in
[1:12:02] Germany and brother Branham you know
[1:12:04] just total people said when you get the
[1:12:06] prayer cloth just you know put it
[1:12:08] wherever it is you know you owe your
[1:12:09] body that up that where you might be
[1:12:11] feeling that illness and you know just
[1:12:13] pray to pray and prayer faith and then
[1:12:14] you know just you know go on from there
[1:12:16] and here this lady was in Germany and
[1:12:18] the prayer cloth got the hurried and
[1:12:19] soon as she got the prayer cloth a man
[1:12:22] she took it in our hand and said you
[1:12:25] know Lord I believe then when you got to
[1:12:27] get out of here got up and just start
[1:12:28] walking right she she had a confidence
[1:12:33] and what had had what had been done they
[1:12:35] they took you know they took garments
[1:12:38] and things like that from the body and
[1:12:39] Paul right and the disease is left to
[1:12:43] people yeah go over to God even recently
[1:12:47] after you know I I was I was at a point
[1:12:50] God had to kind of show me something I
[1:12:52] won't see here not that sort of rebuked
[1:12:54] me but he reminded me but I I wear a
[1:12:57] prayer cloth all the time and you know
[1:12:59] and and I was uh I was I was out one day
[1:13:02] playing golf and somehow the collar fell
[1:13:05] off and I lost it you know and I'm like
[1:13:08] I don't know what happened to that club
[1:13:09] I can't find it so I'm with a good while
[1:13:12] not not wearing one you know not where I
[1:13:14] said well I just lost that one is going
[1:13:16] in that's fine I had some actual but I
[1:13:18] just didn't think they put it on and and
[1:13:20] and I read a quote here recently where
[1:13:23] brother Brandon was telling the
[1:13:26] testimony about a lady that took a
[1:13:29] prayer cloth and gave it to a friend of
[1:13:31] hers and I know spa baby and the baby
[1:13:34] was sick and and somehow the prayer
[1:13:36] cloth up through the washing the clothes
[1:13:38] and everything it just began to shrivel
[1:13:39] up and just got the looks almost just
[1:13:41] just a string and and the mother was
[1:13:43] saying you know what it hasn't done
[1:13:45] anything yet it hasn't done anything yet
[1:13:50] and it's down to this little string so I
[1:13:52] might as well just take it off and not
[1:13:54] worry about it and so so that sort of
[1:13:56] woman that sense of saying I don't care
[1:13:58] if it's just a strain put the strain on
[1:14:01] the baby and watch God do what God said
[1:14:05] he gonna do hallelujah so got reminded
[1:14:08] me that closer now you might have lost
[1:14:09] the freshman book don't give it another
[1:14:11] one put it on your body and what God do
[1:14:15] what he say he gonna do hallelujah amen
[1:14:18] when they took these deep these prayer
[1:14:20] cloths from the body of oh every disease
[1:14:23] left charge of resetting oh if we sin
[1:14:26] with faith like that every disease will
[1:14:28] leave us too
[1:14:31] hallelujah every disease will leave us
[1:14:35] alright search I'm I'm on expectations
[1:14:37] but for this so he goes on to say and
[1:14:40] say I'm the Lord that healeth all thy
[1:14:41] diseases and it says Lord I believe it
[1:14:45] watch what takes place say Lord I
[1:14:46] believe it
[1:14:47] open up every channel and Here I am
[1:14:51] watch what takes place the same as it

[1:18:40] see one person go free and I'm taking it
[1:18:43] upon myself to believe God then the next
[1:18:46] person gonna go free
[1:18:47] come on somebody if I see one person get

[1:22:04] that's what we did on Friday night we
[1:22:06] sit the word after I've loved worse
[1:22:08] amen and I prophesied out of my own
[1:22:11] mouth now I just say the Lord told me to

[1:22:37] talked about the false prophet you know

[1:23:27] let's bow our heads now prayed to be
[1:23:28] sainted so he goes on just a couple
[1:23:30] other statements that I want to just
[1:23:31] make I won't read all these quotes but
[1:23:34] um brother and brother branham said the
[1:23:37] word went forth she believes they were
[1:23:39] to talk about the young lady 17 years
[1:23:40] old dying with cancer never was prayed
[1:23:42] for but she got up and walked right out
[1:23:44] the church heal just because she
[1:23:46] received the word if somebody today
[1:23:48] might be going through something in your
[1:23:49] body if you just accept the Word of God
[1:23:52] you can leave this place heal you can
[1:23:55] leave this place free you don't have to
[1:23:57] leave here the same way you came and you
[1:23:59] would accept the word amen
[1:24:01] I need you to understand something when
[1:24:03] you're accepting the word that's not
[1:24:06] just a singing the word is a person is
[1:24:12] the word is a physical being right can
[1:24:16] we read John 1 can we reach our one I
[1:24:20] want you to see that the word is is in
[1:24:23] the word is is something special
[1:24:26] Oh glory to God I this this is just it
[1:24:31] means something John wants a in the
[1:24:33] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:24:38] with God so when you when you accept in
[1:24:42] the word watch this time and the word
[1:24:44] was god when you sin in the word you're
[1:24:47] actually sending God onto the scene of
[1:24:50] whatever it is that you needed to be on
[1:24:53] like out celebratory you are giving him
[1:24:55] permission to work on that situation huh
[1:24:59] yes I can't read all this but but
[1:25:02] brother branham said it was a man that
[1:25:03] was missing $400
[1:25:06] somebody had robbed the man of $400 I'm
[1:25:09] he sold makan the guy got away from him
[1:25:12] with that Panama's money so so the
[1:25:15] Brotherhood down tribe but you know he
[1:25:17] didn't know really what to do it and I
[1:25:19] he's so they just began the prints they
[1:25:21] lost somehow someway I get it back you
[1:25:23] know I'll get it back you know I don't
[1:25:24] know how you know so so brother Ram him
[1:25:26] say they prayed over it you say all they
[1:25:29] did was pray over it he said now when
[1:25:31] they prayed over it the man that had the
[1:25:34] money did not have a tow package and
[1:25:38] what I mean by that is that this man did
[1:25:40] not have anything in him that would
[1:25:42] identify with the word hallelujah we're
[1:25:45] not when they talk to this man about
[1:25:47] going to church it's purposely going to
[1:25:49] church what to see the sisters in the
[1:25:51] church they knew that he had their own
[1:25:53] spirit so he didn't have the tow package
[1:25:55] brother branham said when I said the
[1:25:57] word a him I knew that it would lack
[1:25:59] show he said but the world watched him
[1:26:02] wherever he went
[1:26:05] the line was on his trail the line was
[1:26:09] keeping up with him the word new way he
[1:26:11] lived probably you might have tossed his
[1:26:15] brother and got out of town but the
[1:26:16] world will find you and the wife found
[1:26:20] them in Bowling Green and another
[1:26:22] brother recognize who this man wasn't oh
[1:26:24] brother
[1:26:25] NSA I found this family in here he's in
[1:26:28] Mississippi this is where it is so so
[1:26:31] brother branham said now you know when
[1:26:32] they heard that he knew that brother
[1:26:34] Evans was gonna get the money but he
[1:26:36] couldn't tell her Lance so he's saying
[1:26:38] said by the heavens we're gonna week on
[1:26:41] the Florida but before we go to flood we
[1:26:43] gonna go by Bowling Green we're gonna go
[1:26:45] through Bowling Green
[1:26:46] he was gonna go 30 miles out of the way
[1:26:48] so brother it was like okay all right
[1:26:50] we'll go through world agree and finally
[1:26:52] struck him say brother Graham I've been
[1:26:53] thick-headed he said didn't you say we
[1:26:56] going to Bowling Green go up the Rosary
[1:26:57] say yeah he said yeah he said you know
[1:27:00] that man that that got my money he live
[1:27:02] in Bowling Green say yeah so he said my
[1:27:06] brother Brandon if it was you know if it
[1:27:08] was you what would you do if you was
[1:27:10] going to Bowling Green would you don't
[1:27:12] get your money and brother brand himself
[1:27:14] come tell him everything he said now
[1:27:16] that he prints it up now I can express
[1:27:19] to him say if I don't say if it was me
[1:27:22] that was hundred dollars don't give my
[1:27:32] money right now
[1:27:34] and then with brother Evans with market
[1:27:37] demands Tony
[1:27:38] got his money that's why I say the word
[1:27:41] gonna bring your money back took your
[1:27:44] money and they paid you back God come
[1:27:47] finish were after them to get so many
[1:27:49] bad god I didn't concern about that too
[1:27:58] you know the same thing he said when the
[1:28:01] man stole his yeah and he went the
[1:28:04] bullish the man was on the way the bull
[1:28:05] agreed he say he say we stick the word
[1:28:07] after him he say the word caught that
[1:28:10] man he actually had something he had a
[1:28:13] tow package right and then what this
[1:28:15] made it work because when the word
[1:28:17] called him he began to think oh I'm
[1:28:19] wrong he used to be a Christian I said
[1:28:21] do this I need to take this car back
[1:28:23] this ain't right it was it was
[1:28:25] conviction to follow don't hit him that
[1:28:27] shows that the word caught up with him
[1:28:30] let me tell you if the work had kept up
[1:28:32] with him and bring conviction the word
[1:28:34] context might silent bring conviction
[1:28:37] the word can catch up solid break
[1:28:39] conviction the work he kicks your mama
[1:28:42] bring conviction the world of kept so
[1:28:44] daddy and bring conviction the word of

[1:38:46] sons of God deity dwells in the man
[1:38:50] hallelujah then you talk about blind
[1:38:53] eyes being open it says they said

[1:39:05] sake talk about what they say let's talk

[1:40:01] that's in him is God the Creator lives
[1:40:04] in the creation oh my how I think of
[1:40:08] that then staying with an unwavering
[1:40:10] faith and asks what you will it'll be
[1:40:13] done unto you there he is God's there he
[1:40:16] is I say hey man today

[1:54:09] can't if you can't give it and not
[1:54:12] expect it back don't give it I remember
[1:54:16] my dad tell me that so I learned that
[1:54:19] sometimes that's where you give just
[1:54:20] give and don't expect the back now if
[1:54:22] you told me that you wouldn't give it
[1:54:26] back I'm expecting you but I'm leaving
[1:54:29] the situation like if they throw I'm
[1:54:31] gonna go on and I've watched God still
[1:54:33] blessed even everything regardless of
[1:54:37] somebody not not holding up the end of
[1:54:39] the bargain but when I ran into this
[1:54:40] coach
[1:54:41] I said no God concerned about that so
[1:54:44] not all I can do it I'm not calling you
[1:54:46] up I'm not I know I'm not calling you
[1:54:49] remember you of not hanging to another
[1:54:51] day I ain't doing lemon imma let God
[1:54:53] sing you a dream in your life and I'm
[1:55:01] just gonna bring me back to your memory
[1:55:03] do you remember this even if you have to
[1:55:06] make payments I know I seen your spirit
[1:55:12] and the word is what did it can I first
[1:55:18] read this oh look at this man he said
[1:55:20] this you can't separate the separate God
[1:55:22] and the word they're one and then he
[1:55:24] goes on saying now then this word he has
[1:55:30] left behind on the printed page is part
[1:55:33] of him when you accept it by faith into
[1:55:36] a spirit filled life he said that his
[1:55:39] word was life amen Romans he said John
[1:55:44] 6:63 be but that
[1:55:47] exactly what he is John 14:6 I am the
[1:55:50] way the truth and the life Romans 8:9
[1:55:52] beat any man have not the Spirit of
[1:55:55] Christ he is none of his
[1:55:56] there it is he is spirit and he is life
[1:56:00] that is exactly what the word is the
[1:56:02] word is spirit and the word it's like
[1:56:04] that it's exactly what Jesus is oh I
[1:56:08] like that
[1:56:08] he is the word so when I'm similar word
[1:56:11] I'm sitting Jesus and Jesus is God
[1:56:15] Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of
[1:56:19] the new man Jesus is God so when I'm
[1:56:22] sitting where I'm releasing Jesus I'm
[1:56:25] releasing God to do something about this
[1:56:28] let's look at this he says Jesus is
[1:56:31] Jesus he is the word so in a spirit born
[1:56:35] spirit filled man in fancy it's one
[1:56:40] thing to send the word but it's another
[1:56:41] to send it to mix it with something and
[1:56:44] we're not spirit born spirit filled man
[1:56:47] in faith takes that word into his heart
[1:56:53] not a quote didn't stop there the quote
[1:56:57] did not stop and you just put them in
[1:56:59] your heart hey there's a comma there
[1:57:03] praise the Lord so what's it I'm you can
[1:57:06] sit here save me all day long but after
[1:57:09] you save man there must be some
[1:57:12] that goes along with this say when the
[1:57:16] spirit born spirit filled man and thing
[1:57:19] takes that word into his heart and upon
[1:57:24] his lips Wow when you let it come out of
[1:57:37] your mouth anointed by God it's the same
[1:57:40] as if God Himself spoke now have you
[1:57:42] ever seen God speaking that didn't come
[1:57:44] to pass if it did if it came to pass for
[1:57:52] him it will come to pass for you I'm
[1:57:56] gonna tell you another thing your doubt
[1:57:58] can't even stop it brother Branham say
[1:58:05] unbelief does not stop God I don't
[1:58:07] believe only hinders the unbeliever but
[1:58:10] it don't stop God amen gotta go right
[1:58:14] over the top of your down and break it
[1:58:15] the pastor
[1:58:16] amen I said that some somewhere somebody
[1:58:20] got offended by me saying that I had to
[1:58:22] give a few quotes on it God will go over
[1:58:25] here to town did he go over Abraham's
[1:58:29] doubt did not Abraham show some doubt
[1:58:32] waiting waiting when he sold his wife I
[1:58:35] mean game his wife that told her to
[1:58:36] that's that's my sister lied to the
[1:58:38] tutor to the leader that a Hitler like I
[1:58:43] believe his name was lied to that that's
[1:58:45] my sister and God went over the man's
[1:58:47] doubt unbelief and told man give him
[1:58:51] back his wife his wife the man told me
[1:58:56] his sister yeah that's what he said but
[1:58:58] that's his wife said I want to give him
[1:59:00] back say give him back because that man
[1:59:02] is my prophet the lighteth prophet this
[1:59:11] man can't be a prophet this man's a liar
[1:59:15] prophet
[1:59:19] then you move to that and that's what
[1:59:21] see if your actions don't change what
[1:59:25] God thinks about your actions didn't
[1:59:33] change God's thoughts this is my problem
[1:59:35] not only do it I want you to give him
[1:59:37] back his wife I want you to have him
[1:59:40] pray for you seriously you won't you
[1:59:48] won't heal it you want your family
[1:59:50] Thanks straight not have it this man
[1:59:53] free food and none of it I'm not gonna
[1:59:55] mention how Abraham felt having to pray
[1:59:57] for you knowing that you just doubted
[2:00:00] God I just lied to this man that all of
[2:00:03] this is what I feel happened they met
[2:00:05] after this occasion because we don't see
[2:00:08] report it reporter anymore inscription
[2:00:09] after this occasion Abraham never live
[2:00:12] like that again and something's got to
[2:00:15] take you through to take their actions
[2:00:16] Oh hallelujah I'm finished read this
[2:00:23] pull look at this church when a spirit
[2:00:26] born spirit filled man and faith takes
[2:00:29] that word into his heart and places upon
[2:00:31] his lips while that is the same as deity
[2:00:33] speaking every mountain has to go and I
[2:00:38] like this Satan cannot stand before that
[2:00:41] man while you just delivered another
[2:00:43] destro to him by taking God at His Word
[2:00:47] let me go on a little further in the
[2:00:50] church way back there in the third age
[2:00:54] have only held on to the revelation of
[2:00:58] the Living Word in their myths if we can
[2:01:02] only hold on to that revelation the
[2:01:04] power of God would not have faded as it
[2:01:06] did in those dark ages and right today
[2:01:09] when the church returns to the word of
[2:01:11] the faith we can say without a doubt
[2:01:13] that the glory of God and the
[2:01:15] for acts of God will be in her midst
[2:01:17] again so I'm looking for the glory of
[2:01:19] God I'm looking for the wonderful acts
[2:01:21] of God that come forth from us sinning
[2:01:24] the word I'm on the expectation can I
[2:01:29] just just give you another scripture
[2:01:31] then we'll come with a closing quote
[2:01:33] here in a second
[2:01:34] take me to John for this is I used on
[2:01:38] Friday night where the Lord the Lord
[2:01:42] Jesus was approached by the Centurion
[2:01:44] and the sentirse you know I'm not
[2:01:46] worried that you've come under my roof
[2:01:48] but if you would just speak the word
[2:01:49] only my servant will be made home Jesus
[2:01:52] never went and prayed for the man Jesus
[2:01:54] never even said any more about the man's
[2:01:56] healing he just told her the Saturnian
[2:01:57] go find it the way you believed it right
[2:02:00] and it was the Centurions faith that
[2:02:02] brought it brought about the result can
[2:02:05] I tell you something's gonna be your
[2:02:06] faith that's gonna bring him back about
[2:02:08] bring about the result hallelujah
[2:02:10] hallelujah hallelujah that court I just

[2:02:16] because I did tell you to use the name
[2:02:18] of the Lord Jesus and I and I we want to
[2:02:21] seal it like that but your faith gonna
[2:02:23] get to a point where you don't just be
[2:02:25] able to take a not from God oh I hope
[2:02:28] y'all catch this man you got to be able
[2:02:30] to take it back from God because what
[2:02:31] brother Graham just say if say how do
[2:02:32] you ask you acts according to his will

[2:03:59] about that that Centurion how you saved
[2:04:01] if you just speak the word only my serve
[2:04:03] you meant well and Jesus never went to
[2:04:05] his house to you there's never went to
[2:04:06] pray for lay hands on a man that man was
[2:04:08] made well by the word by the word I said
[2:04:11] Lord where's another little example in
[2:04:13] Scripture that we can use where where
[2:04:15] the word itself brought healing the word
[2:04:18] did it not not not anything else and if
[2:04:20] the word can do it and skip to the work
[2:04:22] and still do it today
[2:04:23] John for let's pick this up Jonah for
[2:04:26] verse 46 and and imma take some when you
[2:04:30] send the word you are releasing Jesus to
[2:04:35] do something about you're releasing God
[2:04:37] to do something about it now now now for
[2:04:40] my understanding any time Jesus showed
[2:04:43] up in in a situation it was changed if
[2:04:47] Jesus is here this thing will change
[2:04:49] when we marry mother say lord if you had
[2:04:53] been here my brother would not have died
[2:04:56] I don't care how close he was to death
[2:04:58] if Jesus would have been there ain't no
[2:05:01] way
[2:05:02] Lazarus for the time that's the type of
[2:05:04] faked ahead but then he took another
[2:05:07] level and then no I'm not watching here
[2:05:10] but if you believe even right now I know
[2:05:13] you did full day's go but if you believe
[2:05:16] right now we'll bring them out of the
[2:05:19] green church I don't care how long has
[2:05:22] been the tubing wait no you promise to
[2:05:23] be fulfilled if you'll believe right now
[2:05:25] that thing will change somebody might
[2:05:29] have Tony ain't no way to think I happen
[2:05:31] don't accept what they say except what
[2:05:34] God's Word is telling you no reasoning
[2:05:37] there's somebody say your credit your
[2:05:39] credit no no no that's not this is not
[2:05:41] credit this is blessings

[2:06:14] if somebody slips up from he would
[2:06:16] rebuke the Devourer for my seat that's
[2:06:19] what he said all right all right so

[2:28:07] house the mother hands don't have to be
[2:28:09] over the egg to hatch it Jeff so it has
[2:28:11] got some warmth of it in a hatch Laurie
[2:28:14] Oh God he set his word and that's what
[2:28:18] I'm trying to give you his word his
[2:28:21] promise he prepared it at Calvary he
[2:28:24] prepared the sacrifice for your healing
[2:28:26] this morning he got it here and he
[2:28:28] watches over it and you're getting and
[2:28:31] you're getting it in your heart and the
[2:28:33] Holy Ghost is brooding over it it'll
[2:28:35] take the life and produce just exactly
[2:28:37] what God said it would produce every
[2:28:39] word will produce just exactly what it
[2:28:42] promised Gus because God has provided it
[2:28:45] look at the preparation when a person's
[2:28:47] getting ready to put that to send their
[2:28:49] chickens of things how they select their
[2:28:51] eggs put them under the brooder and put
[2:28:54] them in the brooder house and how the
[2:28:55] heat is regulated then he has capped
[2:28:58] over that egg
[2:28:59] till it is hatched I like that if the
[2:29:02] heat is put over it until its hatched
[2:29:04] and sometimes God got the Simpson trials
[2:29:06] some heat heat into a person's life
[2:29:10] until they come out I'm coming home and
[2:29:14] into that that he is kept over that egg
[2:29:17] until it's hatched and God is so set in
[2:29:21] order that one day through all the the
[2:29:25] types back through Adam a man through
[2:29:28] Eve on down through the prophets down
[2:29:30] through Abraham he said in order he put
[2:29:32] it in all those Testaments showing that
[2:29:34] I've shown what he was gonna do and he
[2:29:36] finished it at Calvary when he said
[2:29:38] Jesus who was wounded for our
[2:29:40] transgressions bruised for our
[2:29:42] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[2:29:44] upon him with His stripes we were healed
[2:29:47] he finished it at Calvary then he
[2:29:50] ignored it breaches and set it out now
[2:29:54] to bring the word to put the eggs in the
[2:29:56] right position the right place then he
[2:29:59] sent this same word and a cos it out
[2:30:02] there and then comes right and hovers
[2:30:04] over it by the Holy Ghost until the word
[2:30:07] becomes life in the human heart and
[2:30:10] that's what we want to see this word
[2:30:12] take life look at this and all the
[2:30:14] Devils out of he'll couldn't keep life
[2:30:17] out of it yes sir
[2:30:20] no no no whatever it is if it's a duck
[2:30:24] egg it'll bring a dunk if it's a chicken
[2:30:27] it'll bring the chicken if it's a bird
[2:30:31] it'll bring a bird
[2:30:32] and if God promised salvation taking it
[2:30:37] to your heart the Holy Ghost sees that
[2:30:40] means we stand in the word the Holy
[2:30:42] Ghost will brood over it brood over it
[2:30:45] till it comes to life if he promised
[2:30:49] healing take it into your heart is God's
[2:30:52] provided way and the Holy Ghost come
