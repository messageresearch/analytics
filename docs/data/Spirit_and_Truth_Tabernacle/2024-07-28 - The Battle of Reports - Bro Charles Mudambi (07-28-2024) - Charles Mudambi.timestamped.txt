[1:11:24] titled looking to a Divine promise
[1:11:27] brother in this message amen I was
[1:11:29] quoting what the prophet says one time
[1:11:31] he was invited to go to a hospital amen
[1:11:34] and when he went to hospital there were
[1:11:36] I believe there was a child that was

[1:11:48] is very very infectious you go and give
[1:11:51] it you you know so contagious you end up

[1:11:56] if a Roman Catholic priest was to come
[1:11:58] you would let him go in amen and then
[1:12:01] eventually they allowed him to go in
[1:12:03] they dressed him up amen with all the
[1:12:06] protective amen clothing and he went in
[1:12:09] and when he went into this word he went
[1:12:12] in and you know the Father the I believe

[1:12:29] report what the report say he says
[1:12:31] Believers shall lay hands on the sick
[1:12:34] and they shall recover and the prophet
[1:12:36] came in and he all he did he didn't see
[1:12:39] no vision he didn't see anything else he
[1:12:41] just came and he read amen the scripture
[1:12:44] and then he prayed praise be to God and
[1:12:48] then this father he said this old father
[1:12:50] he says praise be to God praise be to
[1:12:53] God for healing our child but the child
[1:12:56] was lying there dying the child was
[1:12:58] lying there dying and then the little
[1:13:00] Nest that was there could not believe he

[1:13:05] celebrating and thanking God when your
[1:13:07] child is dying amen and he says no no no
[1:13:10] no and she was she couldn't understand

[1:13:17] amen telling them that the child is
[1:13:19] going to come amen that machine that you
[1:13:22] see there amen there's a report that
[1:13:24] says when you you see that machine
[1:13:26] coming all the way to zero amen there's
[1:13:29] not a child there's not a man that has
[1:13:31] been ever known to come out of that

[1:23:08] will have their breakthrough praise be
[1:23:11] to God sir in the message wisdom versus
[1:23:16] Faith the prophet tells us you know it
[1:23:19] depends on what report you believe right
[1:23:21] I want you to understand amen whatever
[1:23:24] that you're going to believe is what
[1:23:26] you're going to
[1:23:27] see there is a certain amount of faith
[1:23:30] that goes with
[1:23:32] Satan there is a certain amount of
[1:23:36] faith that goes with Satan in order to
[1:23:39] accept Satan you got to believe Satan
[1:23:43] are you getting it so for you to be able
[1:23:47] to accept Satan and you have got to
[1:23:49] believe in Satan are you getting this
[1:23:52] brother sister how many believers do we
[1:23:54] have of Satan Amen brother if you are
[1:23:56] fearful amen you are a believer of Satan
[1:24:00] praise be to God what is that amen why
[1:24:02] am I getting that that's perfectly
[1:24:04] scriptural yeah do you know fear
[1:24:07] produces results the same way Faith
[1:24:09] produces results amen do you know that
[1:24:11] fear is the opposite of Faith others
[1:24:14] those that define fear they say it's
[1:24:16] false evidence appearing real amen the
[1:24:19] things that you see amen they regardless
[1:24:22] of how real it looks praise be to God if
[1:24:24] it's contrary to this report it's a
[1:24:27] lying vanity are you getting this am so
[1:24:30] we know that God he send Salmons like
[1:24:34] this afternoon God seon is targeted to
[1:24:38] the six sense yeah the super sense amen
[1:24:43] it's a six sense Satan Salmons they are
[1:24:46] targeted to the five senses the things
[1:24:49] that you see the things that you hear
[1:24:51] amen so that Satan's audience your
[1:24:55] natural
[1:24:56] senses and God the audience Amen to
[1:25:00] God's word is
[1:25:03] Faith yeah the six sense so God appeals
[1:25:07] to the six sense Satan appeals to the
[1:25:09] five
[1:25:10] senses so when you are afraid of the
[1:25:13] things that you're seeing God does not
[1:25:16] care about what you he didn't say did
[1:25:18] you see it he says did you believe
[1:25:20] it so the things that you hear the bad
[1:25:23] news that you hear that your family is
[1:25:26] not going to be happy amen you know your
[1:25:29] your sickness the sickness that you have
[1:25:31] I don't want to say your sickness is not
[1:25:32] yours it's the devil's sickness amen you
[1:25:36] know Satan wants you to believe you know
[1:25:39] the feelings that you have when your
[1:25:40] body is telling you that you are dying
[1:25:42] amen that's Satan preaching his sermon
[1:25:45] are you getting this one time amen as
[1:25:48] the disciples were in the boat and Jesus
[1:25:52] started walking on the water they saw
[1:25:54] him walking amen and Peter say Lord if
[1:25:57] it is you beat me to come he never
[1:26:00] thought about it he never reasoned are
[1:26:02] you getting this he started walking on
[1:26:04] the water why because it was faith that
[1:26:07] caused him to walk on the water and then
[1:26:10] Satan came with his sermon the Bible
[1:26:13] says and the ways became bolers amen the
[1:26:16] things that he was seeing he began to
[1:26:19] believe what Satan was preaching so it
[1:26:22] was the faith you know the Simon that
[1:26:25] Satan was preaching that caused him to
[1:26:27] begin to sink he was afraid to sing amen
[1:26:31] why because Satan showed him that you're
[1:26:33] going to sink wow are you getting this
[1:26:35] yes sir and he believed the seon so much
[1:26:38] so it was his faith in the seon that
[1:26:41] Satan was preaching that began to cause
[1:26:44] results god brother job he says the
[1:26:47] things that I fear the most that's the
[1:26:49] thing that befil me are you getting this
[1:26:52] so brother sister if you believe Satan
[1:26:55] amen why there's an amount of faith that
[1:26:57] goes with
[1:26:59] Satan are you getting this in order to
[1:27:02] accept Satan you've got to believe Satan
[1:27:04] so what produces
[1:27:07] fear it's a faith in Satan it's a faith
[1:27:11] in the things that you see around you
[1:27:13] it's a faith of the things that you are
[1:27:15] hearing amen it is actually a faith it's
[1:27:19] a faith in a report that Satan is
[1:27:22] presenting amen that's why it ends up
[1:27:25] happening praise be why it is a faith
[1:27:28] wow
[1:27:31] wow
[1:27:33] God Amen you found the same thing
[1:27:36] happened with the spies yeah the 12
[1:27:39] Spies they were sent 10 of them they
[1:27:41] came they brought an evil report God was
[1:27:43] not happy why they had it was faith in
[1:27:46] Satan God had already told them that
[1:27:48] that land I've already given it to you
[1:27:50] all they needed to do was to believe it
[1:27:52] amen you you know it's not yours because
[1:27:54] you feel like it's yours they were
[1:27:56] already Amen anakims on the land are you
[1:27:59] getting this but God says it is yours
[1:28:01] amen there may be anakims on your health
[1:28:04] amen but God already says it's your
[1:28:06] health praise be to God it's not yours
[1:28:08] because you feel like it's yours it's
[1:28:10] yours because God says it's
[1:28:13] yours are you getting this amen
[1:28:18] hallelujah so
[1:28:20] now we're talking about the Battle of
[1:28:22] report say Amen brother way had a sister
[1:28:25] a few weeks ago amen at our church this
[1:28:28] sister she was told she went for a
[1:28:32] biopsy and she was told amen that the
[1:28:35] results are not looking good you know it
[1:28:37] looked so wrong praise be to that was
[1:28:39] the doctor's report Amen brother we
[1:28:42] speaking about the Battle of reports
[1:28:44] praise be to God so the doctor's report
[1:28:46] said things are not looking well you
[1:28:49] have got to come she was given a date to
[1:28:51] bring all her medication and they wanted
[1:28:53] to start her on treatment amen she came
[1:28:56] to church again in that service amen
[1:28:58] where we were talking about the Battle
[1:28:59] of reports brother sister the reason why
[1:29:02] I'm speaking about this amen if you can
[1:29:04] read your name praise be to God into
[1:29:07] this sermon brother sister you are going
[1:29:08] to see it it's going to happen amen it
[1:29:11] is going to happen because this report
[1:29:13] is is unchangeable praise be to God
[1:29:16] brother once one time amen the prophet
[1:29:19] he you know he went he bought a gun amen
[1:29:22] it was a model 75 Winchester praise be
[1:29:24] to God and you know he was zeroing in
[1:29:27] from 50 yards and he was hitting the
[1:29:29] target he was hitting the eye from 50
[1:29:32] yards amen and then after a little while
[1:29:35] you know this gun was not zeroing the
[1:29:37] way it ought to amen he took it back to
[1:29:40] the Winchester company says but you know
[1:29:42] what's wrong my gun is not performing
[1:29:44] the way it ought to perform and the
[1:29:46] people they looked at him they no no Mr
[1:29:48] Bram you are wrong amen why because this
[1:29:51] gun is designed to shoot from 20 yards
[1:29:54] you are saying you shot from 50 yards it
[1:29:57] was not designed to do that amen it can
[1:29:59] only hit from 25 yards and the prophet
[1:30:02] says no no no no no I know it has hit
[1:30:05] from 50 before I know it's zeroed him
[1:30:08] before it should zero in again praise be
[1:30:11] to God brother sister I want to tell you
[1:30:13] that this gospel this report is zeroed
[1:30:15] him before because Jesus Christ is the
[1:30:18] same yesterday today and forever so if
[1:30:21] it zeroed him before it should zero in
[1:30:24] again brother this is not a Winchester
[1:30:26] company now if it doesn't zero in we
[1:30:28] will take it back to the author we will
[1:30:30] take it back to God himself and God is
[1:30:32] not going to tell you that if it's
[1:30:34] zeroing the days of Malachi 4 that you
[1:30:37] know it's somehow it's lost its power if
[1:30:39] it's zeroed in in the gospel if it's
[1:30:42] zeroed in in the days of brother Bram
[1:30:44] it's going to zero in in your day amen
[1:30:46] if it's zeroed in Amen in in the
[1:30:48] testimony that I'm giving now if this
[1:30:51] gospel if this message zeroed in is is
[1:30:54] going to zero in this afternoon praise
[1:30:56] be to God whatever it is brother sister
[1:30:58] you ought to believe the report amen
[1:31:00] that's all it takes am so this sister

[1:48:27] speaking about this amen when I preached
[1:48:30] this message they also for the first
[1:48:32] time ever there was a couple that had
[1:48:34] come in I'd never met them all my life
[1:48:37] was just sharing the testimony that I've
[1:48:39] just shared the same testimony that you
[1:48:41] are hearing now amen that's why I'm
[1:48:43] saying brother sister amen if you
[1:48:45] believe the report if you there's
[1:48:48] nothing there's not enough devils in
[1:48:50] hell to withstand it amen there was a

[1:49:08] for the first time ever these people
[1:49:09] were invited to church by someone and

[1:49:21] playing out live as the word was going
[1:49:23] forth amen this is the power of the
[1:49:25] report that's what the report can do my
[1:49:28] brother my
[1:49:29] sister and we are expecting amen the
[1:49:31] next time we'll see each other we'll be

[1:54:09] prophet telling us he says you know make
[1:54:12] these Valle is full of ditches amen he
[1:54:14] says you know it wasn't going to rain
[1:54:17] amen so where was the rain coming from
[1:54:19] the prophet tells he says a few years
[1:54:21] before that amen along that because the
[1:54:23] Bible says on the tomorrow amen oh my

[2:09:18] amen just give me another 5 10 minutes
[2:09:20] we'll be done
[2:09:25] 1 Samuel chapter
[2:09:27] 17 and they went out a champion out of
[2:09:29] the camp of the Philistines named
[2:09:31] Goliath of goth whose height was six
[2:09:34] cubits or in the span and he had a
[2:09:37] helmet of brass upon his
[2:09:40] head and was armed with a coat of male I
[2:09:44] want you to was the language
[2:09:49] amen and he had Grieves of brass upon
[2:09:52] his legs and a
[2:09:55] target of brass between his
[2:09:57] shoulders amen verse number seven and
[2:10:00] the staff of his spear was like a waver
[2:10:03] beam and his Spear's head weighed 600
[2:10:07] sheos of iron and one bearing a shield
[2:10:10] went before him look at the depth and
[2:10:14] the level and the trouble that the word
[2:10:16] went forth to describe how big the
[2:10:19] problem was you see how you know the
[2:10:23] they extend you know look at the level
[2:10:25] of description you know so this is what
[2:10:28] happens when doctors give you a report
[2:10:30] they will give you names a they will
[2:10:32] give you all the technical stuff about
[2:10:34] it amen why because they want you to be
[2:10:37] scared amen by the time you get to verse
[2:10:39] number seven you know you'll be very
[2:10:41] scared amen just by the description of
[2:10:44] the
[2:10:45] problem so that's what Satan's reports
[2:10:48] are there to do to describe a problem
[2:10:51] until you you you you you you are done
[2:10:55] before you even confront the
[2:10:59] problem my god brother are you getting
[2:11:01] this so this is how Satan works now
[2:11:05] these are the things that you see amen
[2:11:07] you know the report comes in a way that
[2:11:09] is explaining exactly you know it goes
[2:11:12] into unnecessary
[2:11:14] depth unnecessary depth Amen to try to
[2:11:18] cause your heart to faint
[2:11:21] that's all right but brother I have a
[2:11:23] report
[2:11:24] amen this report doesn't tell you how
[2:11:27] you should believe it it doesn't that's
[2:11:29] why the angel of the Lord loved that
[2:11:31] song only believe only believe Amen
[2:11:35] brother is that simple amen God did not
[2:11:37] want to complicate it any further only
[2:11:40] believe amen but when Satan comes he
[2:11:43] comes he magnifies his St he wants you
[2:11:47] to begin to faint just by reading amen
[2:11:50] amen
[2:11:56] now David was the son verse number 12
[2:11:58] now David was the son of ephra died of
[2:12:00] Bethlehem Judah whose name was Jesse um
[2:12:03] I'll just leave that and he had sons and
[2:12:06] uh the men went among them for an old
[2:12:08] man in the days of Saw verse 14 and
[2:12:10] David was the
[2:12:12] youngest and the three Elders followed
[2:12:14] sa so the Bible doesn't even go into any
[2:12:17] depth about David David was just the
[2:12:25] youngest David was just the youngest are
[2:12:28] you getting this only believe are you
[2:12:30] getting this only believe is that simple
[2:12:34] amen but you did you see the level of
[2:12:37] depth amen the trouble that the word has
[2:12:39] gone forth in just describing Goliath
[2:12:42] including his clothes how he looked all
[2:12:44] these other
[2:12:46] things there are two reports amen I'm
[2:12:49] speaking about the Battle of two they
[2:12:51] coming to their climax amen as we get
[2:12:54] ready to close
[2:12:56] God I don't know what report you
[2:13:01] have but David went and turned from so
[2:13:04] he just now you not even describing
[2:13:06] David just you know giving a recounting
[2:13:10] uh just uh giving a listen says and
[2:13:13] David went and returned from so to feed
[2:13:15] his father's sheep at
[2:13:16] Bethlehem yeah so the only description
[2:13:19] that David had was he was was the
[2:13:23] youngest yeah but David went and
[2:13:26] returned from so to feed his father's
[2:13:28] sheep at Bethlehem and the Philistine
[2:13:30] Drew near morning and evening and
[2:13:32] presented himself 40 days and David
[2:13:35] spake to the man that stood by him
[2:13:37] saying what shall be done to the men
[2:13:40] that killed the Philistine amen how many
[2:13:42] Davies do we have here you know they
[2:13:45] looking at the reward they're not
[2:13:46] looking at the problem amen what you
[2:13:48] know they are looking at the Ultimate
[2:13:50] Prize is Beau don't focus on your
[2:13:52] problem focus on the
[2:13:55] reward amen and so said to
[2:14:00] David Thou Art not able to go against
[2:14:03] this Philistine look yeah but look I
[2:14:06] like before we get there verse 26 says
[2:14:08] for who is this uncircumcised Philistine
[2:14:11] that he should defy the armies of the
[2:14:13] Living God so David identified a
[2:14:16] weakness amen he identified that this
[2:14:19] Philistine though he be he be
[2:14:21] but he's
[2:14:23] uncircumcised we know circumcision
[2:14:25] represented is a type of the Holy Ghost
[2:14:27] amen does your problem have the Holy
[2:14:34] Ghost so already you've identified that
[2:14:38] it's an uncircumcised
[2:14:40] Philistine already it's in trouble now
[2:14:43] it's already in trouble isn't
[2:14:46] it
[2:14:50] God and so say to David listen to this
[2:14:53] Thou Art not able to go against this
[2:14:55] Philistine to fight with him for thou
[2:14:57] art but a youth so the reason why he
[2:15:01] brings it down to age you are just but a
[2:15:04] youth so you won't be able to go against
[2:15:06] this man what an irony and he now
[2:15:10] describing him a man of war from his
[2:15:14] youth so I am a youth I can't go against
[2:15:18] him but he has been a man of war from
[2:15:21] the youth from his youth from his youth
[2:15:25] he's acknowledging that he was already
[2:15:27] Warrior from his youth but he's saying
[2:15:29] you can't be a war because you're a
[2:15:32] youth so this is what Satan does amen he
[2:15:36] wants to convince you you can't do it
[2:15:38] but if he was a Warrior from his youth I
[2:15:42] can't do it because I'm a
[2:15:45] youth what an
[2:15:48] irony so that's how cheap Satan
[2:15:51] arguments can
[2:15:52] be are you getting
[2:15:59] this and David said unto so thy servant
[2:16:03] kept his father's sheep and there came a
[2:16:07] lion and a bear and took a lamb out of
[2:16:12] the flock so the prophet tells us that
[2:16:15] you know one trial makes way for another
[2:16:18] trial so if you are going from from
[2:16:21] trial to trial from trial to trial it's
[2:16:23] God is preparing you for an ultimate
[2:16:26] trial that will put you on the throne
[2:16:30] are you getting this the absolute
[2:16:34] trial so let me read that
[2:16:36] again thy servant kept his father's
[2:16:39] sheep speaking of himself and there came
[2:16:41] a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of
[2:16:44] the flock thy servant flew slew both The
[2:16:47] Lion and the bear and this uncircumcised
[2:16:50] philistin
[2:16:51] shall be as one of them I want you to
[2:16:54] identify your uncircumcised
[2:16:56] Philistine and he going to be is one of
[2:16:59] them but you see I heard something about
[2:17:03] ship that's quite interesting they say
[2:17:06] that before a ship goes
[2:17:09] forward to fight they say that it comes
[2:17:14] back to gain momentum so when it's moved
[2:17:17] back to gain momentum then it can launch
[2:17:20] for
[2:17:21] forward so we find David he understood
[2:17:24] the language of
[2:17:25] ship he started going back to his
[2:17:30] experiences as he spoke about the lion
[2:17:32] he was going back as he spoke about the
[2:17:35] bear he was going back he was ready to
[2:17:38] launch forward to the uncircumcised
[2:17:41] Philistine amen because it gave him
[2:17:43] momentum
[2:17:45] now to go after Goliath amen so
[2:17:48] sometimes my brother sister you've got
[2:17:50] to look look back amen at your life and
[2:17:52] see the battles that God has fought for
[2:17:55] you before if he delivered me amen is
[2:17:58] the god that healed me before he the god
[2:18:01] that delivered me before he's the god
[2:18:03] that made a way for me before brother if
[2:18:05] he did that before he's able to do this
[2:18:09] and brother sister amen so this
[2:18:11] uncircumcised Philistine will be as one
[2:18:14] of them listen to this now as we are
[2:18:16] closing oh
[2:18:18] my this day will the Lord deliver thee

[2:18:48] actual encounter amen so you can defeat
[2:18:51] your enemy by the spoken word I want you

[2:48:39] our life where Satan uses it to try to
[2:48:44] produce fear but God you use the same
[2:48:47] situation to produce a faith and father
[2:48:51] is to allow attributes to come out of us
[2:48:54] that you placed in us and God it's only
