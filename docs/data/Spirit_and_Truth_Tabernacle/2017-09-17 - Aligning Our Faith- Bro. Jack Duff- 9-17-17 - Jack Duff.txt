Albany was a wonderful time really wonderful time and as I was going now really wasn't feeling the greatest but I was gonna press on anyway praise the Lord I've been having some problems in my legs and some time I felt real weakness and cramping of what have you and I surprised everybody this time all those that travel with me but get in the wheelchair because I didn't want to slow everybody down with my problems you know and I'm glad that I did that it was a real battle of pride a real battle of pride but it's a girl you know you're close to 70 years old you ought to be able to sit in a wheelchair praise the glory to God but as we got there in turn into the service really really had a beautiful time and after thee I believe it was the first service we were in to praise and worship after the music I believe that was the first service and as we were praising and worshipping the Lord the pastor's mother sister Dottie she came down the center aisle and I saw her stop near the road that I was on but I wasn't really paying attention to her and then I look in the south her motioning and I wasn't sure if she was motioning to me Yahoo but finally I got to understanding that she was motioning to me and she called me out cuz she wanted to pray for me she she later told me that it was just so heavy on her heart to pray for me and I really really appreciated that because he doesn't let me know the Lord knew what I was going through and I think tour you know it was just such a blessing the service on Sunday night another glorious time another glorious time the after the service brother Nathan the pastor he called me forward because they had seen their little just the I guess I was a little tired because the night before I hadn't rested much at all I was up and down all night with cramps and usually vinegar would help but the vinegar wasn't doing much and all my roommates just sleeping soundly and I'm just up and down up and down finally got in the shower they gave me some relief but anyway he made it through the day fine but that night brother Nathan called me up and for prayer and I just think the Lord for that again I didn't ask for a prayer line but the Lord he closed the prayer line and brother Nathan prayed for me because I have to go back little earlier his wife had asked me how I was feeling and what have you now I told him you not had a rough night or what have you but he prayed for me and you know it wasn't anything that was especially emotional or anything but when he prayed for me I just believed and I thank the Lord that that night that I slept

Tuesday at 7:30 service Wednesday night no service Friday night brother Nathan Brian at spirit and truth Tabernacle Saturday evening at 7 o'clock and Sunday morning at 10:30 an anniversary potluck dinner October 15th reasonable and we have another testimony and we like to hear this morning from sister Tanya will you come up system [Applause] [Music] god bless you sings I just want to give a little testimony about the goodness of God I first like to start it out by saying I know God's life has I mean I know God has been had his hand on my life since way back since I can remember I must I've never got a chance to give him glory for all of the things he did in my life which is so many I can't go over all of them but I'm I know when I was a little girl maybe two or three someone in my house had put some bleach and a lemon juice bottle and I used to like to drink lemon juice so I got the bottle and I drink it my father my mom had to rush me to the hospital they pumped my stomach and there was no residual burns and my soft focus and my stomach and you know I just know that was a hand of God because drinking bleach you know I should have had all kinds of burns in trouble but I never had trouble with my stomach and never had trouble with my throat and bringing it on up to date when I was 16 I contracted some kind of rare virus and I was paralyzed from the neck below I missed maybe three-quarters of a year out of my freshman high school year I was completely paralyzed and what the virus does is it spreads it starts from one side of the body and I started getting numb all the way down spread it to the other side then I started coming up and I was in the hospital for several months they had no idea what was wrong with me and then they were expecting it to spread to my lungs it was expecting my lungs to stop working that's what the virus just spreads to the muscles and each muscle it attacks it just stops working so but before it ever got to my lungs I was completely paralyzed from the neck below and one side of my face I couldn't move my eye or if I was smiling but only going this side but it never went to my lungs you know and they didn't have any treatment for it they just kind of had a wait to the virus wear off and I told he just my mom was praying the church is praying and it turned around so I never had to get put on a ventilator which is what they was expecting you know it was a long recovery it took me months to learn how to walk all over again and I had to go to therapy and stuff but you know I'm here and again no residual from that so many things you know God has just had his hand on my life all the way through and I don't know why I'm so undeserving you know I don't know why but he chose me you know and I thank him for it so about two and a half months ago I was doing my hair and I looked in the mirror and I seen a little bump up there look like a little pimple so just kind of watch it so in about three weeks time it tripled in size it became about the size of a dime or nickel you know maybe it's a little you know low infection I still wasn't really worried about it at the time I said well I took a picture of it sent it to my sister and she said well I'll just go to the doctor let him look at it so I went to the doctor he was a little worried he said hmm he sent me to the dermatologist so I went to the dermatologist and it really seemed real worried at the time he cut a piece of it and sent it to have a biopsy so he told me all the results would be back in about four days so we waited you know the devil just flying all over your head I say well you know I'm not gonna worry about it you know four days came and gone still didn't hear from the doctor I called they said well it's not ready yet you know we'll call you when it's ready week later still hadn't heard no results so low I what's going on so the doctor called me finally about a week and a half after that biopsy a seven o'clock one night I said just can't be good doctor call this legal so he called me he said well I got some news for you he's saying it's cancerous I say hmm really so at the time I was like well I said well what kind of cancer is it he said well it's a lymphoma I said okay didn't really know how to take that news you know nobody to get a diagnosis like cancer you don't want to hear that nobody want to fight that battle I can tell you firsthand nobody want to hear that kind of news so I said well okay you say well you know it's a cancer of the immune system and it's a cancer it's in the blood so okay that's what do you want to do you cell camera senior oncologist and we'll go from there so I went to see the cancer doctor and they sent me four PET scans but again the insurance didn't want to pay for the PET scan they denied it so I'm like okay so how you gonna deny a test that important you know so they can find out what stage it is or where it is or how to treat it insurance didn't want pay for it so after that I got the PET scan done my sister paid for it I got the PET scan done went back to the doctor they wanted to know whether the cancer was anywhere else in my body other than just on the top of my head so I was praying press the Lord this is in your hand I don't know why I'm going through this test but I give it all to you so I was just praying and consecrate myself and try my best to stay as positive as possible fighting back all of the negativity all of the demons that kept trying to grip my heart with fear I said Lord that I know you're in control I'm not gonna worry about it so the tests came back it was clear no more cancer nowhere else in my body other than the spot on my head so I was thankful for that I went back to the doctor again and she said well I'm gonna need you to do one more test you know to rule out whether or not you're gonna have to have chemotherapy as well as radiation so okay one more test I hate waiting for results of tests so this time they sent me to get a bone-marrow biopsy I went in the hospital had that done and this is about a week before the storm before we went on the trip I went back to see the doctor for the results of that on the 28th and she said well I got good news I say yeah I know it's clear you're not gonna find nothing in my bone marrow and there's nothing there she said well did you get the results I said no I just know it's clear I have a piece of my heart I know it's in God is in control I told us to the doctor I say you know she said well we want to start radiation now that you don't have to get chemotherapy we want to do radiation we want to start it this week to keep it from spreading I said well I got a trip that I'm going on with my church is already paid for and we can't start this week because once you start radiation they don't like you to miss you have to go every day I said okay well I'm going on a trip and it's already paying for it I'm not I'm not starting this week let's put it off till next week so she's okay September 5th soon as you get back we got back on Monday she says soon as you get back I want you in here 8:15 in the morning I said well doc I'm praying that this tumor won't be here and you won't have nothing to treat I said but I'm going on this trip I'm praying it's gonna be gone by the time I see you again so she just looked at me and saying all right all right so I left you know and Thursday before we were supposed to leave to go on a trip I wash my hair and I pull it up well but let me back up before that I had to go see the radiation doctor they had to create a mask for my face to protect my eyes and all that stuff when they go in the machine and they cut out a little hole in the top so that the beam can go down to treat the tumor so I had went to him I had the mask made and everything and then I had to see the doctor as well so I saw the radiation oncologist and I said doc there's another load of tumor that's coming up right next to the original tumor so I showed it to him he was like huh we need to increase we got to make that hole bigger in the mask so we can cover the area to cover both tumors I said hold Lord is paying sprint so fine don't worry about it W Allah don't worry about it so you know we did that and say okay he said you're gonna start this week I said no doc this is the second radiation doctor I said no I'm going on a trip we're coming I'll see you next week when I get back if the Lord will I'll see you next week so um we Thursday when I washed my hair I pull it up in a ponytail so I wouldn't have to worry about doing nothing to it the whole weekend so we was at the services in India and I was just praying sit lord I need a word from you as to what you want me to do I said Lord I'm giving it all to you I don't know what to do I don't know which direction you want me to go but I'm giving it all to you and I just I was praying and just listening to tapes and trying to keep myself in the right atmosphere at all times I mean to the point where I was even with my daughter and she was talking gossip and negativity I said you got a hush I don't need that around me right now I want to hear it I want to hear it she got upset with me if I say I'm sorry I'm not gonna be a dumping ground for your negativity I cannot have that around me right now you know but I had to do it so we were in Indiana and the services was going on they were very good services and I have to back up and I thank God for my pastor because all those services that he'd been preaching it's really elevated my faith to the point where I was like okay you know it was a 24-hour fight to keep the Devils from landing because they were definitely circling in flies trying to get me upset trying to get me to you know believe all this stuff that you're telling me oh you know it's a 50/50 chance it's gonna come back you know and you know there's no cure and all of this and you'd be lucky if you live five to eight years all this kind of foolishness I said WI I'm not gonna not gonna accept it not gonna accept it so I thank God for my pastor and the messages that he's been preaching that really really just elevated each service just elevated my faith and elevated my faith so Friday night it's a service in Indiana you know it was very good and you know I was just still praying thanking God and waiting for an answer Saturday I was still waiting for an answer so Laura tell me what you want me to do just give me a sign speak to a minister anybody just let me know what you want me to do Sunday came and go yeah I was getting a little worried I said Lord I got to see these people and go back and I don't know what you want me to do so Sunday night the minister called me up for prayer and I wasn't expecting that because I didn't go and get in the prayer line that's just Lord I'm just gonna trust you and he called me up for prayer on Sunday night and he prayed the minutes just stood around me and prayed and you know like sister Berthe said it was you know no emotional workup and nothing I just thank God for the prayer I went back to my seat still didn't feel no different and we came home on Monday and soon as we got home you know we were hearing about the storm so we got start preparing for the storm and you know running to get water and wood and all this stuff and I still hadn't even looked at my scalp my hair was steering the ponytail I hadn't taken it down so Tuesday morning it was time for me to go to the hospital had to be there at 8:15 for a radiation treatment the first time I took my hair Dera not Anna ponytail was Tuesday morning so I'm looking in the mirror so I'm doing my hair cuz they told me leave it loose in the front so they can get to it that's what the ponytail down I'm looking at my hair I say nothing I'm like at first I was like okay is this just me because I want this thing to be gone so bad maybe I was just seeing things so I felt around I looked around nothing's there and when Troy came to pick me up cuz he was just getting off work he came to pick me up we went to the doctor I said Troy look at my head tell me if you see anything or if you feel anything because I don't know if it's just me want this thing to be gone so bad that do you see anything he's like no it's gone we immediately start praising worshiping God you know and I was like you know I was happy but I wasn't really shocked I was kind of expected it because I prayed I said Lord and I told the doctor I want this thing gone before I come back and see you so I wasn't really shocked but I was like wow he's really gone he really did that so I went ahead and went to the to the hospital and the nurse came and got me she put me in the room to start the treatments and I told her I said you know before you do anything can I see the doctor I said no I'm not scheduled to see the doctor today but I really need to see the doctor and she was like why I said well he need to reevaluate me so she was like what's wrong and I parted my hair in our shoulder I said the tumor is no longer there he's gone and she looked at me she's like hmm okay so she put me in a room and she went and got the doctor but he came in and he looked at me he started looking inspecting my head he didn't see anything I said it's gone doc it's gone I told you it was gonna be gone before you start any treatment I told you it was gonna be gone so he looked at me he said well what did you do to it I started do anything to it he said would you put on it I said I didn't put anything on it you said did you take any kind of medicine I said no dog didn't take no kind of medicine then I thought about I said well you know there is one thing I put on it I was pray for some hands on some ministers was laying on it that's the only thing that was put on it so the doc said well he was stunned he didn't know what to say I said so doc does that mean I don't have to get radiation because there's nothing there to treat no radiation there's no tumor there's nothing to radiate he looked at me Oh doubting Thomas come in he said well even though the tumor is gone I still think we need to do some treatment I say doc can't we get another PET scan can I prove to you that there's nothing there I know is there's nothing there I said I'd serve a God as a mighty guy he don't have dude healing he's not gonna take away the tumor and leave behind some cells you know so you know the doctors he's doctors just being doctors Wow I don't know there's a small chance that it could still be some cancer cells that are left there and I just don't want to miss pray Eddie trying to put fear in me I don't want if I do nothing you know then the thing spread and now we got to do aggressive treatments and we just don't want it to go that way I said lord have mercy I got to get one of these doctors to believe me to give me a prescription for a pesky and so I can prove to them that there's nothing there so he didn't he went hearing it I went to the other doctor my oncologist I saw her I just went to the office I have no appointment I said I need to see the doctor and it's like well it's really busy we got a lot of people since the storm you know and just jam-packed we can't fit you in I say look it's very important I need to see the doctor so the nurse I showed in pictures on my phone I said look this is very important I need to show her that this tumor is no longer here and I need her to convince the radiation doctor that I don't need radiation so she went back there she said let me go see the doctor I go back there now talk to her she went back talk to the doctor she came back out well the doctor said she'll see you so she put me in a room the doctor came in I can tell soon as she walked in the room myself I say remember what I told you a week ago I told you by the time I come back and see you this tumor was gonna be gone and I say I serve a mighty God [Applause] [Music] and she she just looked at me and she saying yeah yeah you did say that I said you can't deny it it's gone I mean if there was anything I could come up with a concoction to make a tumor disappear I would be a rich woman there's nothing I did it was all God she said well I don't didn't I don't negate the power of prayer that's what she said I don't negate the power of prayer but I said Oh Lord you're gonna talk to the other doctor ain't you yeah he didn't convince you the same story he told me but even even if they're they're doubting and they still want to you know do what they want to do I know I serve a mighty God and I know that he has definitely touched and healed my body come on let's pray [Applause] we serve a real God you can see the pictures there of showing before and after and even though the doctors may not want to acknowledge it you know you you messing with people money money that's tied up in that but you know I tell you when when we see God do what he's done it ought to it certainly ought to do well I wonders for sturgeon and we thank God for what he just did for sister tiny if this is diverse nothing short of a miracle and the thing about miracles is that you don't have to fill them all right you don't have to fill them but they still miracles right and and and this is nothing short of a miracle and we gonna claim that as a testimony of God's grace and man I'm just I'm just I'm overjoyed I'm overjoyed a man a man let's just give the Lord another hand of praise [Applause] let's have a word of Prayer father we have heard these powerful testimony serious warning then your showing to us that you are the same yesterday today and forever you told your prophet that if you could if he could just get the people to believe him that not even cancer was standing in the way of the prayer and God I believe you you had very specific reasons for telling him not even cancer you knew that would be something that we'd be facing in this hour just attack after attack but God we stand today so far Lord just knowing that you have touched so many and heal so many of cancer my daddy was healed to cancer now my sister-in-law being healed of cancer sister Sam healed of cancer father we know that you are God amen that you are completely in control the father we know that amen the doctors have not come to an agreement and maybe they recommend and other things that just tells us that there's more to this testimony that you'll even make the doctors testify of your greatness hallelujah so we give you the praise and the honor the glory and Lord as we just prepare our hearts a man for a little thought today we pray that you just minister to us Lord and may you Lord just bless amen this time together in Jesus name we pray amen amen let's give him another hand of praise a man thank you musicians you all just get your Bibles it went quickly and we'll turn to a portion of Scripture I want to thank the Lord for seeing sister Robles a man so good that to have her today and rather storm also passed through Dominican Republic but brother Robles told me that everything was just fine a man there with their home and also I wanted to officially a man welcome brother Quinton a mentor fellowship this brother Quentin this with your hand brother Quentin I've been telling y'all about brother Quentin for a long time for the Quentin just relocated from Maryland a man and he's here in fellowship with this the Lord blessed him to buy a place here very close to the church and and I'm just good to have him a man here at the fellowship we welcome him in Jesus name a man I'm gonna go to Hebrews 11 and and as you're getting that that you all heard the announcements for services next weekend brother Nathan Bryant the pastor of open door the Church of the open door there in New Albany that's where we went to be in fellowship with them now he's coming here and gonna be in fellowship with us but next Saturday night the reason I wanted to test him on a shared I want a faith to be elevated brother Nathan the Lord has blessed him to be able to pray for people that are sick and God gives results while he was there just kind of sharing prayer he he had prayed for sister Tanya once before here in our church last year and she wasn't able shouldn't have any motion in her arm and he come and prayed for her and that same night she went home she was ironed and she was doing all kind of things she noticed that the motion had been restored you know after the prayer and and you know we saw that and then while we were there he was explaining all that and brother Nathan beginning I just I don't know how he remembered all the details but he remembered every detail my said man this just this brother has a in his life you know and and oftentimes he's pray for different ones and they've been healed and so next Saturday night we don't have a prayer line here at the church and what I'm asking you to do bring folk that you know need a touch from God amen bring people that you know need a touch from God if you need to touch we're gonna have a prayer line for that but if you know people that you know you know what I just believe if you had hands laid on you it'll be all right tell them sister tongue is testimony telling sister burrows testimony right it just just get people here into the presence of the Lord and let's just let God do what God does amen but next Saturday night we're gonna have that and if you've been going through something I want to encourage you please amen come to that service of expectation we want to pray for the sick amen on next next Saturday night we want to do that God is moving Amen God is moving and now the other thing I'll tell you is that we've been taught well we know that you don't have to be a Christian to get a healing we already know that but if you want to keep your healing now you just open up the door to talk to somebody about Jesus right gentle never again got to be a Christian to get healed you gotta be a Christian come on come on we gonna pray for you and after they leave and they taking it they they healed nicely now if you want to keep your healing now you got to become a Christian all right now so I tell you church let's let's come back and expectation looking for God just to do some mighty things here I miss Hebrews chapter 11 verse 1 through 6 a man it reads as says now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do here by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God now see so before the translation there must be a testimony Amen that you please God and now the Bible tells us how to please him right the Bible says in verse 6 but without faith it is impossible to please them so this is you know probably one of the most important sermons that could ever be preached because we are in the time of a rapture I don't know if people realize that right we're in the time where we can expect the translation of some saints that's the promise for this day and it ties right back down to your faith amen right but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him amen the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word I'll let you be seated and I have another scripture that I want to try to get to if the Lord would allow us a mint over in second Kings and we will it's going to be second Kings chapter four just give me a second and we will get to two that praise the Lord I want to just talk on the subject today aligning our faith amen aligning our faith some of the other details behind the testimonies that were just shared here today we were I was actually in the office preparing a man to speak on that Sunday night at the church and and as I was just making preparation [Music] sister-sister Bryant brother Nathan's wife she came into the office and she said you know my brother but she said brother Nathan if there's any way you can have a word of Prayer for sister Byrd she you know she could really use it tonight just just pray for her please so you know brother brother Nathan said okay we'll gladly do that we'll gladly do that and then brother Troy had come to the office as well and he said you know my wife asked that you know just if you know she could just be prayed for you know brother Nathan you pray for once before and there's very specifically say brother Nathan you prayed for once before and God touched her and God healed her and she was just you know before she goes back home she just wanted you to pray for her and he said well you know what we'll just do it right after the service and now typically what he does is the minister that's preaching he always kind of has that Minister because the minister is coming from underneath the anointing of preaching he always says that Minister preach I mean pray for it pray for the sick after the service but and these two particular cases he just kind of felt he even actually said brother Jack would you like to explain you know what what happened was just a time yeah last year and when she was healing said no no brother you take it you explain it you you you you you let everybody know and so he went up and after the sermon he just began explaining her condition from last year and how he prayed and how God touched and you can just see the sincerity and feel the sincerity those of you that were there you you felt that you know as a certain sincerity they they had just almost moved him to tears when he begin to think about you know what she had gone through and I think you know before you pray for sick you got to be able to feel what the people feel a man if you can't feel what they feel and if you're not touched by the feeling of their infirmity you'll never be able to get no results right but but when you can feel what other people feel and then you begin to pray like brother Branham you know said it was like you know a man working with a horse say that horse get all worked up you know and and when you get all worked up and everything you can't stand there and yell and scream at the horse you you just all you gotta do is create a worse problem right but he said he said when you when you when you just go to just just stroke the horse and whoa boy whoa it's gonna be alright it's gonna all of a sudden you just you you're atmosphere changes the horses atmosphere come on somebody Amen when you're talking to people you're the faith in the and the testimonies that you share that's the atmosphere that you're creating that's gonna change the atmosphere you can't carried out into situations like that you can't talk doubt you're talking I could just put it in plain language you're talking nonsense a man you you got a top plate in there we need Thanks somebody build up my plate right and so there's a way that you have to handle these things but as brother Nathan just begin to you know kind of moving to her infirmity you know just just just just from what uh what he what he remember from last year I said man it's just it's just something so you know call both sister Tanya up in sister Birds up man he just prayed a simple prayer and who would have ever known that after that prayer these things were coming for we knew the next day since the birds that told us the very next day say I don't my legs I had a better sleep last night my legs feel much better sad I'm doing much better but we didn't know about such a Tanya right and y'all saw the picture a man the doctors want to deny I can see the evidence right I can see the before and after now they would show you before and after surgery pictures why can't we show you before and after prayer pictures we know our God is still wrong right but you know what I was feeling there is that what happened there was an alignment of faith there was an alignment when when sister Tanya you know requested number see if she remembers and I remember the last time you pray for me God heard your prayer right and if God heard your prayer last time god I hear your prayer this time right so I want you to pray for me and he is she eating heater he you know he just kind of felt less so you know what let me let me let me take this I want to pray for this listen and I'm like well we just all gonna join together and just pray but but it was just a thing where you knew that guy was moving so now we see the results as I wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute look I don't care what you're going through here today I don't care what your situation is today I think you're in the right place at the right time where God can change whatever you're going through you don't have to take the doctor's report didn't gotta accept that right I mean sometimes we just surround everybody with such negative reports a man whose report are you gonna believe imma believe the report of the Lord all right I mean don't there's there's not one person that heard these tests for today that can leave here and say God is not a healer God heals can't serve God hears cancer we just saw him do it let me just give you a little something here amen I want to read this out of the message why cry speak Amen now as I'm just getting that then I'm reading paragraph 42 on this I want you to just get understand there's a difference in having an intellectual conception of the promises right and then also having faith in God's promises you know because sometimes when when we just get an intellectual conception we just mentally agree with what God said right but but at some point in time has got to go beyond just a mental agreement to a revelation on the inside of your heart that God gonna do what he promised you that he was gonna do right say brother Branham was kind of mentions that Moses had that intellectual conception of his purpose and life that his intellect can only kill one Egyptian right I'm going through this quote in a second say but after Moses had an experience on the backside of the desert he became a one-man army and was able to conquer the greatest army in the whole world at that time but that was after his experience what we're trying to do is bring people to an experience with God amen not just the intellectual conception you got I mean when you hear things like this if God can do that for them then I know God can do the same thing for me whatever you have neither it might not be healing it might be something else but whatever if God can take care of cat's-eye I can take care of you how do you somebody I want to just kind of get their start let's go to this quote brother and said Moses being born with this great gift of faith he said then he was anointed so it's one thing they had the gift of faith but it's another thing to be anointed he was anointed and commissioned at the burning bush to deliver God's people now see now sees what are great qualities this man had he was born for a certain thing God had a purpose of not catch this Moses was born for a certain thing God has a purpose in look you say God has got a purpose for you being here see if you can only get to the place how much trouble you'll save God or yourself to I want you to get that one real good you got a purpose for being born and your purpose is not to serve the devil amen your purpose is to serve Almighty God and once you can get to that once this revelation strike you that you got our paths you will save yourself some trouble and you'll save God some trouble amen see I mean you know all you got to do is some time to look around there's some people have to tell you like I'm brother branham's the first one say if I would just serve God early in my life how much more God could have did for me right but oftentimes we have that struggle you know our bodies here but our mind is somewhere else well I can't wait for the day for our body and mind to get an alignment hallelujah amen we got to get that thing in alignment when you when you when you got your car running all out of alignment it's not a good ride you hate to touch the brakes right you hate it because when you touch the braces just go to shake it all over the place right I mean when or or if you if you're driving at a certain speed and that thing out alignment it's pulling to one side of you're constantly fighting with it oh y'all work with me here you constantly fightin if it's functional right you practically pull it back left if it's pulled to the left you fight to pull it back right Amen but when you get an alignment you can take your hands off the steering wheel and that thing that just goes straight by itself holiness somebody stop fighting with God's here line it with your faith and let God do the drivin God has got a purpose of you being here see if you can only be get to that place how much trouble you save god of yourself - it says Moses born and then he was afterwards he was brought to the place where he was anointed and noticed the sea laying there with an intellectual conception the sea was laying there with an intellectual conception now the reason he hath that's because his momma and stood at him his momma told him you know how God did so many things at his birth and and how he was protected from you know the people coming to destroy the kids two years old and then how he was raised up in Pharaoh's house and how God paid the momma to take care of take care of all son I mean his momma taught him all them things so he had an intellectual conception can I just be honest we don't we don't taught our kids this message maybe we're not taught him the word they got a good intellectual conception but now they need an experience and once they come to an experience and that connects with the intellectual conception now we're in alignment all right now it becomes a faith a true revelation of who you are glory to God a man listening says he says and notice the seed laying there with the intellection with an intellectual conception with all the faith that he was born to deliver his people yet it never come to life until their light from the burning bush flashed across him yeah until that life of the burnt from the burning bush blast across it until he's seen not something he read about that's what I'm talking about not something he read about but something he's seen with his eyes something that spoke to him and he spoke back to it and how that did bring things to life I'm going on it says I think any man or a woman boy or girl nothing and intellectual conception of what they think the word is and so forth ever can have a pool never can have a full foundation stand until they have met that light that brings that word to a reality now this is important to me I think no church can see our action all the question a few weeks ago say how you know he how you know he's the same yesterday today and forever I asked that question you know and now with the testimonies that we just received we know he's the same yesterday didn't we not talk about what he did back in brother branham's day we don't talk about what happened in in barber day we talk about what happened in our day listen he says I think no church in its practice no matter how intellectually fundamental it might be that church cannot thrive until the supernatural is made known among that people we just can't keep talking about this we just can't keep quoting it we have to become the quotes you want them to talk about what happened in your day not just have a go Bob we got to become this word the church came through listen at the church the bunch the church can't drive until the supernatural is made known among the people and they see it I love that quote not just hear about it see I'm grateful for hearing about what God do it in this church and what God doing that search but it creates a godly jealousy when I hear God there one over them we got some of the same conditions here wait a minute my God is the same if he has no respect of churches no respect of people so if I can do for him I'm expecting God to do the same thing right here and he has done it he's done it Church he says he says until the supernaturals made known among the people that people and they see it something they can talk to that will talk back to them that vindicates this written word I tell you what he just spoke back to us this morning a man and you like it's out like I said you cannot leave here saying a man that God is not a healer not a dis Church you can't say that number yeah I mean anybody got any condition we pray we lay hands on the sick we pray for him and like they did you put no I was anointed with oil not in this but just right here on my forehead North it with oil and that's what the Bible said pray for the anointing with or pray for the sick say the Lord will raise them up that's what the Bible say it's real simple I think we make it too complicated one time brother Branham say he had some people coming up you know before the prayer line and you know they would stay with you know there was Gary pray and they just got a little too excited amen as they were approaching the prayer line you know actually let me go to this message faith is the is the substance faith is a substance and I'm going to paragraph C 63 but he was just talking about how people were approaching a prayer line I want to I want to this is why it was so important that the way that the sisters approached and how God did it it's simple y'all a man it don't you don't have to make it more than what it is you know how something you don't realize that you got faith you know a lot of us don't realize it I'm going to show you how you know you got faith when you came in here today Amen you saw that chair and you just plop right down in it you did not inspect the chair to see if the chair will hold you up you know you didn't know whether it will hold you up at night and some of y'all instead of chairs that didn't hold you up but you still have faith enough to anomalus sit in that chair but got faith after you got hurt to sit in another chair it is real simple I mean you have faith just to plop right down that chairs that you know I'm not gonna get hurt this chair told me and I mean you know and when you could just apply just simple faith to simple things like that it's the same thing with God if God made you a promise if God said it that settles it it don't matter whether you believe it or not it is still settled they used to say God said it I believe it that said no it don't matter whether you believe it or not it still saddled see it's all it's all in your approach oh my god Amen listen to this he says this it's just the simplicity it says there's nothing you can work yourself up to it's no excitement right it says there's no excitement I'm East 63 says there's no excitement I noticed people coming in line just get to shaking themselves and saying oh God hallelujah Aidan and glory to God see you're working yourself up before you even get you done working yourself you know and brother Mannis say don't do that so you interfere with things there when you start acting that way you interfere with things you say you say they say you interfere with God come up reverently and just lay your hand up and believe that's all faith you don't work yourself up to it faith is something that's already in your heart you just come and believe you see what I mean all my friends my I love you I wouldn't talk to you straight if I did love you but I love you too well to see you get by without this see you mother understand so you know when you're approaching you can't you just approach very simple and just taking God at His Word you'll see that uh that everything that you have asked God for it will come to pass I'm going back to that same message I want to start a paragraph c6 a man and I want to read just a couple of things then we'll we'll move on here in our fault it says now some thinks that it's a mental conception of the word but that is not right faith is a substance faith is not a myth faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence to have an evidence it must be a substance so it's not just something that you imagine in your mind right it's something that absolutely you have it's something that you possess in your own being and what is it it's the evidence of things that you have hope for it's the evidence of things you do not have as yet unlike what he says there it's the evidence of things that you have hope for amen but it's also the evidence of things that you do not have as yet listen but you but you have the authority of God oh my lord you have the authority of God to say that you have it now you might not have it physically a check but you have the authority of God to say that you have it oh that's why I suppose you could tell the doctor I'm gonna come back in a week from now and it's gonna be going we've been preached that it's gonna be like you say see I mean you come back to that scripture and you really read that March 11 and you see how Jesus was before he gave that that you know that thought on it'll be like you say if you say to the mountain he spoke to that fig tree and when he spoke to the fig tree it's just my imagination I don't think Jesus stood out there yelled at a fig tree I don't see I don't see him doing that you know I ain't no fruit on you know Manny for you know more prayer Jesus didn't have to do it like that I think I think he just said no Manny from you know more forever kept walking they come back in 24 Oh God they come back in 24 hours and in 24 hours that at the roots oh lord have mercy I hope y'all get it that that tree began to dry up at the roots the life was taken from it at the roots right and when the life was taken from that tree at the roots what I mean Peter noticing say that Lord the tree you spoke to yesterday look at it it is trauma it's the same thing when prayer was paid by our precious sister that they began to dry up at the root that's why the doctor could not see is the same Jesus in operation right now he hasn't changed that they will dry up at the roots whatever you need to try Abdallah try to pet the roots Oh oh my God my god I got a confidence you know my faith is just just moving to a level where I'm not looking at just just stuff that the devil try to get you to look at to get the cause you to doubt right I mean you know it like I said it's not just about healing in your body a man it's healing of souls right I'm looking for God to heal some Souls and and and I my prayers that God and I'm just speaking out of my mouth Lord I'm at Lord let every influence let every so call friend because a friend that'll keep you from crisis not a friend a man let every so-called friend every so-called associate let the relationships dry up let it be so bad God that they will never want to talk again Lord push them back into true friendships true relationships with the saints of God I want to see things fly up at the roof amen that's what my prayer we looking for for souls a man to be restored glory to God let me go on a little further here he says it's not just something to imagine the amount of something to absolutely have is something you possess in your own being what is it it's the evidence of things that you've hoped for it's the evidence of things that you do not have as yet but you have the authority of God to say that you have it authority of God to see it Amen even I mean whether anybody agree with you not you still got the authority of God to see that you got it the authority of God the doctor won't give you that authority but God has given you an authority to say it's mine I know what I'm dealing with but it's still mine listen it's an evidence something you have in your heart see it says now now it's not something that you're counting you just kind of push yourself to I've noticed so much of that in my meetings that people try to work themself up into something to make them believe now you can't do that you just beaten the air but faith is something that's just as calm and settled as it can be I like this faith the faith is something that's just as common as settle as can be that's why you walk around with a smile even though you're going through listen listen he says he says my faith is something that's just as common stuff as it can be it's taking God at His Word and have any assurance in your heart that God is able to keep what he has said that he would do and will perform everything that he said he would do now notice that many times people think they must be grateful oh look at this now people think they must be prayed for that's all right we should pray for each other or their hands might be or some Evangelist hands must be ministered that's right that'll bring contact and so forth of faith but real unadulterated faith is taking God at His Word that's the main thing now I've just got to show you you know God responds a man to different face and I want to just kind of just-just-just break this down if I can when the Centurion came to Jesus a man and he said now I'm not worried that you should even come underneath my roof he says but if you would just speak the word only and my servant will be made whole you know what the manservant was made whole because of his faith but God didn't let me just put this way God then required that all of us got 1/2 Centurion faith some of us may have spoken word faith but some may not be able to get it up to that level but just just ask something oh my let me just go a little further there was a man that was sick of the policy oh my god the man was sick of the boss he was paralyzed right and not now all that what would happen him is that his friends began to tell him what had happened the last time Jesus came to town the last time this man passed through something happened and I heard that he's having service again tonight at so-and-so's house right so since they said well if he don't be at saltos house I better get myself some how to solve those house now I'm sick of the palsy I'm paralyzed I can't pick myself up so his friends picked him up and put him on the bed and carried him to church that's why I'm inviting y'all to bring people to church next week if you know they need something from God get him here to the presence of God if you got to pick them up and carry them then pick them up and carry him amen if you got to go put them in your car put them in your car whatever you gonna do get the people here to the presence of God here they come caring that their friend the church and they get there to church was packed I would love to have a situation like that so bad I mean it's so packed that nobody could get in so sort of sick with the membered cyclic process now his faith thing got elevators he's coming he's free and all the testimonies what Jesus did it's an iron I'm not gonna let this pass me by no I'm gonna make sure I get in on this hallelujah see that sometimes a wave will come through and amen and there's a wave of faith that's coming through the church right now I hope everybody would get in on this glory to God but you know he said no I hadn't come this far say man I'm not I'm not I'm not taking no for an answer I need to have Jesus do something special for me and as they brought him you know there to the house and you know and they've realized that he said man we can't get you in we tried our best but you know we can't get Jim he said well you know do me a favor once that's it taking me up to the roof now what we gonna do here in the roof man you mean you know he can't see you but don't worry just just take me up there to the roof if you don't mind just just do that for me you brought me this far don't drop me here just take me to the roof they get them up to the roof and you know an innocent listen now what what do you want us to do see they think that don't run out they thought if we just got them amen to the meeting and maybe get them inside then then it'll be taken care but but they said no even though I can't get in I can still find the way somehow to get Jesus attention Jesus is sitting there explaining amen answering questions and all these other things that he's talking but all of a sudden a man up there the roof they begin to tear this soften and tear that often and tear this time for there's some stuff you got to tear that off it and tear this off damn I'll tell you unbelief often you're doubting and whatever it is that's hindering you from getting into the presence of God tell anything off they begin to tear it off and Jesus looked up and the Bible say Jesus solved their things Jesus saw their faith and I love that because your faith can call somebody else to get healed Jesus saw their faith and when Jesus saw their faith he was moved by it here come this man being let down out of the roof right into the presence of Almighty God and this man got up off his bed and he walked home carried his own bed home oh I wish we had some people that can believe God for that they'll carry their own bed home you'll push your own wheelchair come on our God is still God but that was that was another type of faith that he honored the woman with the issue of blood this was a different faith her face said I don't need him to talk to me I don't even need him to pray for me I don't need him to even look at me I don't need any of that I don't you got to understand the condition that she was in nobody could touch her she was ostracized because of her condition 12 years ostracized kid not a man I mean it was really bad but she said you know even though the Lord might say they can't touch me but it didn't I say I couldn't touch them and her faint said if I could just touch the hem of His garment and the Bible said she came from behind she came from behind and she resounded just got a little touch Amen maybe maybe just enough maybe even even realized you know I mean it was so strong that he could feel it's coming coming - nothing like that just virtue left his body and when she touched in church when she just returned she walked away and she when she was going on her own and then going back to the house but she say if I can touch him I know that I will be made whole but before she could get back home the think that everything stopped Jesus say who touched me who touched me now you know he was on his way to go touch I mean go go heal somebody else daughter Tyra's had thought about this lady stopped him in the middle of his of his of his journey he say who touched me say Peter said not all these people touching you how you gonna say some license not my PDA lunder stand virtue just left my body somebody touched me with faith it's a different touch so I'm not some some people touching a man like like folk trying to get an autograph that's the way they touch you know Jesus told ya jeez oh Jesus yeah yeah you know my god and they leave and go back home and say I touched Jesus but now did you really touch Jesus well she say who touch me they start looking around saying he's a caller I say what was it Oh Lord I've been dealing something for 12 years 12 years I didn't know I'm spit up all my money doctors have tried to help me they couldn't help me I did everything I could and I just say it within my heart but if I could just touch the hem of your garment I'll be made whole he said go and be made whole your faith has made you whole see how faith was different from front from speak the word only faith her faith was if I can't touch the hem of His garment gyres faith didn't gyrus gyrus wasn't a man that half a percent if you just speak the word only my daughter race no gyrus say I need you to come to my house but when Jesus got to his house and pray for his daughter his daughter was raised everybody faith might be a little different but it's still faith oh my god the seer Phoenician woman right I mean she got there and her faith was like oh my Jesus gave her a hard time I just you know just bear with me she's gay you know I'm not sent to t32 your kind you Gentiles I'm not sent to y'all and she say she say say say you know yeah I know but you know I know you the only one that can help my daughter so I'm coming at you asking you for help I need I need some help you say look say not even you know we not giving nothing to the dogs this is this is the children's bread it's not for dogs now y'all know the current day version of the seer phoenician woman would have been a no you didn't but not her her faith was like now I understand you right we're called dogs you say but she said even the dogs even dogs can get crumbs from the master's table and Jesus was so penetrated by her faith he said you know what you know I say you said woman great is your faith great is your faith and because you got great faith go find it the way that you acts see everybody has something different that they was dealing with never on approached but they all had some level of faith we're gonna need that Church we don't need that let me just read a couple statements here brother Branham made this statement I just want to these are about 13 statements I want to make of what brother Graham said faith is or even the Bible the Bible says now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen that's what that's what Hebrews 11:1 tells us brother Branham said now faith is a direct evidence of things not seen it's a direct evidence of things not felt taste smell or heard your faith is a direct evidence right faith is of God say God got a drop faith down inside of you God got to give it to you Amen hallelujah says how he says faith is something that's just as calm and settled as it can be Amen it's taking God at His Word and having the insurance in your heart that God is able to keep what he said that he would do and will perform at everything that he said he would do he says faith is a positive sense man see whatever sister had to give the negative away from her because when you got faith you can't talk negative faith is a faith is only positive it's not negative faith is a positive since it's not a guest work listen he says you don't just imagine it it's just as real as any other sense your body just the same as sides-- can I just give you an example of that what colors my shirt everybody says why is there anybody here think my shirt blue anybody think it's great pink anybody all right so everybody say it's white now you leave Church and the action now what color was brother Jack shirt what were you saying now no matter how much time I might try to convince you that with some other color you know by your own sight by your own sight you know what color the shirt is and no matter and if somebody comes to you to try to tell you that the show was any other kind of color you wouldn't even argue with them well argue with you doctor why argue with your friends when you know you have seen it yourself this is your personal experience you ain't got to argue it nobody I saw that this week we were doing something and one of the brothers was going through a little something and and everybody know you better watch this you better watch this he just got quiet online bang where my faith is my faith is somewhere else and he just kind of got quiet he just let them argue he just got quiet I just watched you just got quiet all right see I'm a team when you stop talking it they're gonna stop talking don't sit there and argue with little buddy when you got faith on the inside God does showed you something you gotta argue with no party it's a personal revelation okay all right all right let's change subjects two days ladies sent me a little text to say I told you what I was believing out for is exactly what I got I ain't taking what they say I got it they stole a see that might have been your experience but then ain't gonna be my experience can I tell y'all something no they gotta accept something because its genetic you ain't gonna take it because so let's go ahead and let's run through the family maybe some of your family won't come about the blood of Jesus but because you have been covered you ain't gonna accept it get it back to the devil don't take it get it back to the devil there's power in the blood Church you know sitting there when mama was was going through what she was going through there and in jeffersonville it thought came back to me I remember mama actually going through something there's like cancerous in her body as well her my daddy went away for a trip on the west coast and was just there in their room just praying about this thing that that was there in my body and just trying to figure out what they was gonna do to handle it you know and some kind of way I don't know how it happened but while they were there praying mama noticed something just just don't you know I think it's right there on her neck so I'm kind of waiting and she's just begin to push a little bit just push and that thing that was growing inside my body came out came out and she never dealt with that thing anymore that growth came out and I began to thing I said I seen God do this for mama before I say now he can do the same thing for her again sometimes when you when you when you working with people you got to remind them of what God did and sometimes you you need to you need to remind yourself of what God did that way now you can pray for the person I got a quote up here I can't read them all but you know we talk about gifts of healing you know brother Branham say every pastor has a gift of healing then he went further than that he said every person you have a gift of healing you have it if you say he said cuz that's what the Bible said if you just lay hands oh I'm trying to get them if you just lay hands on the stick they shall recover that it didn't even say pray for them just lay hands Oh God listen listen to this faith is a positive fist it's not a guesswork you just don't imagine it it's just as real as any other sensitive body just the same as sinusite is real hearing is real see taste feel smell hear the five senses of the body that control the body they're real faculties to you if none of them is injured and then and then faith is just as real as any of the other five senses and more real because it'll go in and above those five senses listen faith is long-range vision I like and then not knowing the other thing that brother Bevan say he says faith it don't lower its sights you know Abraham got stronger the longer he waited his faith got stronger his faith increased the longer he waited you know the longer I wait the greater the miracle that's just that's the way it's gonna be faith is long range miss an adult law recites it holds to the target faith is a sixth sense in a sense with faith really histor heart it doesn't have to be a spontaneous miracle when faith really hits the heart and that's where the devil give us come on y'all know that devil you get pray fun oh it's still there but that's not faith basically I was prayed for and the prayer of faith will save the sick and God gonna raise me up so I don't care about it still being that it's gonna go it's leaving amen it's leaving hallelujah faith when it when it really hits to heart it don't it doesn't have to be a spontaneous miracle he says this faith faith is a conqueror faith amen is it is an overcomer Amen faith is the victory that overcomes the world he goes on to say that she says faith is a law of God the same thing all this power of God that we're tenth we're talking about is accessible to us by faith all things are possible say to this mountain be moving it on down to your heart believe what you say it come to pass you can have it accessible if you've got the law there it is the law see the law is faith that controls all things he says this perfect faith is a master of all circumstances I like that not just some circumstances perfect faith is a master of all circumstances perfect faith not just all circumstance now now what what what no matter what it is it masters it now just watch when you believe in anything do anything you got faith in what you're doing no matter what the circumstance is that don't have one thing to do with it see it masters that circumstance it's in a room of sickness and the Lord's revealed that this certain things going happen you just speak it and go on that's faith Luke you can only have faith as God gives you faith faith is a gift of God ever how religious him you may be you must have faith in your faith can only rest if you're Christian upon the proven Word of God it says faith is something that's revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be faith is a revelation of the wheel of God all right let me um I wanted to slip over to something here and and before I do that one last quote out of faith is our victory I'm at paragraph 23 I just my goal is to build faith faith is necessary for the translation if we ain't got faith that God can bring him you know brother branham self a person did not believe in divine healing they would not make the rapture if they didn't believe it now it's one thing you know we know that there's been some people that's been sick and wasn't healed but that didn't mean that they didn't believe in healing just because I mean the doctor did lose it didn't lose his license when his patient died dr. Tolley was like actually he get more patients after his patient dies right amen so our God gonna lose any credibility if somebody passed away amen he don't lose no credibility he's still God I mean there's there's many that I've gone down in faith believe in God and that faith that they went down is the same faith that's gonna raise them up and change their bodies alright church amen so I mean whatever you do you just keep having faith I remember one preacher say if he was praying for the sick and one drop dead why he was praying for him he just stepped over the top of them and pray for the next one that's faith that's tell the devil he ain't gonna get love no no credit no glory nothing we're not even considering anything all right Church look at this brother Branham says in faith this victory says now faith is a conqueror faith is an overcomer it's just a peacemaker it overcomes faith is the victor overcomes the world what does it do what is faith what is the conquer a conquer and conquer and victory is the same to conquer it means to beat down your faith is what's conquering that means your faith is beating down oh lord have mercy okay you can get a devil a beat down just by quoting scripture after scripture just get beat the devil down to it means to beat down the override to handcuff to throw into prisons it means that the thing that once rule you you rule it now it means that you have overcome you've whipped it you're greater than it is oh I feel religious right now says which was first to sit on Savior I save you for us figure is more powerful than a sin which was first of the healer or a sickness it couldn't be a healer unless it was over the sickness it is a healer it could conquer the sickness and faith is the victory that overcomes every curse of the devil faith is the victory faith overcomes your genetic disorders you ain't got to take it just because it passed through your family your family didn't have the revelation that you got hey man I know they had that kind of trouble but they ain't got the same faith that you got they didn't have nothing to fight with I mean even even science improves they get they got better medicines that they go to and all those types of things so we got different things that we can we can fight stuff that other people I mean used to be a time women died having babies soon as they have it they did that but we don't we don't found a way to overcome that type of stuff science has found a way to overcome that right I mean in the science gonna prove what about us as a church amen as a spiritual body of Christ we ought to be improving in our faith recognizing what God promised us but don't live beneath your privileges all right let me go here let's pick this up because we're talking about aligning faith and and there was this thought here out of second Kings chapter 4 let's just pick that up in and I'll try to bring this home second Kings chapter 4 what was what was going on here in this particular story if we don't we won't have time to read the whole thing but in in the first part of this chapter we have a lady that was I would call a poor eighth man and and and and she was going through a little something in her house she had kind of run into some got into some debt and as she fell into debt she was looking for a way to get out of it she went to the the prophet and the prophet gave her you know something said go and borrow some you know some vessels and fill it up with oil and then sell it he said he'd say borrows many as you can borrow as many as you can from your friends and and said then just just go fill it up with oil and then sell that and and when she went and sold it did exactly what the prophet told to do not only did she pay her debt off she ended up with an abundance right she ended up with an overflow glory to God I hope you caught that because the some of us are in debt while we got to do is what God tell us is doing not only we pay the debt off we'll end up in overflow and I don't know about you but I'm moving from that I'm moving from debt to overflowing I'm gonna follow the Word of God whatever you tell me to do I'm gonna do and I'm moving from debt to overflow hallelujah some night but but you know that that happened at the beginning of chapter but then we get later on a chapter there was a wealthy woman but she had a problem and she and this problem this lady had had no children but but the thing about this later is that she was very you know very kind to God's prophet and and what she did you know she actually uh she told her husband say you know I perceived that this is a man of God as he's passing through the city I perceived that this is a man of God she said she said let's do something let's build a room on our house and let's let's put a bed in there and let's put a little a little couch or something just let the mana man let the man a guy rest at our house he gotta stay at a hotel when he come to this city I want the man of God to rest at my house hallelujah glory to God amen we got to be able to do that now you know when states come from other places we ought to have a room ready for some Saints to let them in we want the people of God to rest in our house oh Jesus glory to God a man see if we can get ourselves out of debt and go to overflow we can get our houses set up to welcome people of God ain't number the truth right we are you are a desire to wanna you ought to desire to want to be a help to the people of God not just your family and friends the people of God and you want to welcome them into your house I got a room set up just for you I remember going to the pastor's house one time I've never been welcomed like this the brother said well sit down right over there and say your wife once you come over here in this room I said okay no problem he said I'll just take off your shoes all right I'll take off my shoes and you say brother I got this pill here I want to wash your feet this is a well-known pastor each saying I want to wash your feet my wife on a wash your wife's feet we just want to pray over y'all and welcome y'all to our house I've never experienced anything like that right but by me you know we are the other we ought to create a welcoming environment for the saints of God's oh come on church but I mean and see what you're an overflow you ain't got to worry about where I get groceries from God gonna make sure you're covered don't go empty oh if you take care of people of God gotta make sure you're covered don't go empty it's in the Bible it's in the Bible Church see what we got to learn that we got it we got to give God you know our best give God's people our best not just you no no no no no no I want you standing standing at that hotel no I got I got a place for you I got a room set up just for you I know we got to handle it all with within reason you know you understand right I don't I don't I don't I don't think Amen a single sister should just have a single brother from you know I want you to come stay with me no I ain't talking about none of that Oh singer brother yes sister you you got no place now you know now you pay for her hotel room we want to keep it holy Steve you understand but a single sister should be welcome all to see you no other single sisters to be able to come stay with him right single brother welcome with other single brothers that come stay with Amen married couple welcome married couples praise the Lord and don't get me wrong sometimes you do have you got you got culture shocks you got all kind of stuff people doing you might have to kind of straighten them out sometime culture shocks might cause you not to want to do it no more but but but but but just just trust me something if you find yourself being a blessing to the people of God gotta make sure you always have plenty so you can be a blessing see if you're doing it just for yourself nothing but when you decide that Lord I'm doing this for your people watch god bless you this lady was wealthy and she decided to do that so the prophet saw the kindness that this lady brought to him and and and and and not only him his servant they have always had a place to go to and they came to that city they have to worry about no hotel stay they had a room dedicated to them so when the prophet saw discount and say you know what can I do for for you she said you know I don't I don't need I'm good I'm good only nothing well the Prophet looked at the survey what can we do for her he couldn't even think of what to do fun he's just receiving so much kindness he wanting to bless it back I'm gonna tell you something that's the secret to getting a blessing be a blessing but but as you know he said what can I do for what can I do well you know children oh that's a good call the lady always say and you know at the time of life you're gonna have a son you cannot just have a child you're gonna have a son told exactly what she was gonna have all right don't play games with me don't get me all worked up because we have been trying to have children for years and I never had enough now don't get me on words that at the time of life you're gonna have enough you gonna have a child and here it comes it you know later on the lady gave birth to the son prophet still you know are going to and fro and and and here brother branham say the boy got about 12 years old the same boy about 12 years old and there he was out in the field and there was a heat stroke that hit and the boys started getting headaches and and he went to complaining to his dad dad in my head I don't know what's going on daddy I don't know and the dad it's just seven back to the mama brother branham said was the best place he could be his in his mama's lap right he said went sent him back to his mom and and dad like I don't know what to do with this boy he just walk in the flow that's pacing and up now just I don't know what to do and he said just just give him to his mama mama mama got him and the boy died in his mama's arms but the the mama mama didn't stop there mama say you know what give me give me one disturbance and give me a donkey and I'm going to see the Prophet they say say no this is probably not the right time to go go see him you know but but she said she said no no everything gonna be all right I'm going to see the Prophet not now that lady had a faith that lady had a faith in and when we when we talk about a lot in the faith what you look at is you know this woman went to see the property she made a statement she told us a night as we on our way even though the riot might get uncomfortable even a riot might get a little hard sometimes you go through things in life it gets a little uncomfortable but she told us she told the service they don't slack - right I know it's a little hard right now but I ain't going nowhere imma be right in church today man don't slack the ride for me just just get me to the Prophet get me to the Prophet and brother branham was saying how you know when she got there to the Prophet and you know if say God it never showed the property life should what was going on he looked I said that's that shooter my woman that that sir come and say you know it's a garden show said I wonder what's the matter with her and say when she got there she she win and she grabbed the prophets feet and he say she say he say it's all well with you and your family and her testimony not my my son is dead that's not the first thing coming out her mouth she say all is well no matter what you feeling that's what you still got to speak oh this world the prophets say okay you know what's going on and then she began to telling saying I told you action prophet please don't play don't play games with my feelings my emotions I didn't want this child you gave me this child you gave me this child and since you gave me this child I've done the best I could and raising another child is dead and going on an iPad I just need to understand what's going on I just need some clarity privacy okay he gave his little staff to his servant gob sitting on the hard to go out there and just just touch the baby with the staff but the lady looked at the staff and it's what brother branham say this is what I mean by a line in our faith it was brother branham saying when he looked at when the lady looked at the staff she say the staff didn't speak to me now you might have confidence in your staff your faith is in your staff but my faith is in you so the fact that the staff did not speak to me the staff didn't give me a promise and now he knew that whenever he touched was blessed that's where his faith was right brother Branham said that's that's where we even get you know the prayer cloths and things and if we get it from that scripture right he said whatever he touched was blessed but she said no no my faith that's why they had to get in an alignment oh my god you know i'ma just read this real quick he says no he say no matter no matter what his faith was if the woman's faith wasn't the same then it won't work her faith was not in the staff and that's why she stayed right there to speak say no no no I can't I'm not going back with the staff but I will go with you and say as the Prophet company left we realized that the lady wouldn't be was she wasn't moving till he moved and as she comes to the house brother Branham say she laid her son out on the same bed that the Prophet laid here now she laid her son on that bed that the Prophet laid in she just waited waited daddy walking in patience not know what to do but she just waited and said when the Prophet got there brother Branham said God did not give him a vision he didn't know what to do so what the Prophet did was just he went him and laid on the boy and when they laid on the boy nothing happened but not before he laid on them Gazi had already come back and says I laid this the staff on him but ain't nothing happened with that staff can you imagine being the servant of the Prophet taking a staff into a dead person and laying it on now most of us if we see it that person we running the other way but he took the staff who say he laid on us and now I'm sorry I we've tried and nothing worked it's a when the Prophet coming he laid on top of the boy and nothing happened brother branham save just forgetting the pace up and down this way you got to be calm when you got faith just become just wait on the Spirit of God wait on the Spirit of God he says as a prophet just beginning to wait on spirit guy he say he never even prayed but he felt led to go back and lay on that boy again when the Spirit of God came upon and he laid them in the second time and when he lay it on my got that boy beginning to sneeze first time a little warmth came back into his body but this time he began to sneeze and the Bible say he sneezed seven times hallelujah see I like that because the church ages we sneeze seven times and it's only after the seventh sneeze that we came back to life for the random sets and things here about this lady in you know how faith wasn't in the staff he says it depends on where your faith is some people let's read this this is a paragraph ether tea out of the message Elisha and then I got one other quote I think I want to read after that he says this it says and so Elijah girded up his lorentz and where he went without a vision not knowing what to do in a way they went Ghazi beat them he went ahead went into the room and laid the staff upon the baby weight at no life come baby still dead it turns around looks awhile still the baby was dead so he picks up the staff and runs back in meets Elijah and the shunammite woman coming woman coming and so when he did he said I laid the staff upon the baby and there was no life no breath he didn't open his eyes he's still dead so that's the report so see the woman's faith wasn't in the staff it was in the prophet now it depends on where your faith is some people said you've got to have hands laid on you the other said Roman said just speak the word of my son shall live and yet the woman didn't want him to lay hands on her she just touched his touched His garment and little gyrus and a few nights ago and in the lesson why he said come lay your hands on my daughter it depends on where your faith lays and what I want you to get from that got them meet you right where your faith is it depends on where your faith lays so Elijah was right he says now I believe he's just proven but he knew that God had blessed whatever he touched you see it he believed that God blesses so he said God had blessed this and if you lay it on the baby I believe that God will make it well now no matter what his faith was if the woman's faith wasn't the same then it won't work you see what I mean it takes your faith and your passes faith together you to have to have got to have the same faith and if you believe the same thing that the man of God has told you then something's got to happen so the man of God believed that he wouldn't have to go over there he would just send the staff but the woman said no no no I going to stay right with you I'm gonna stay right here till I find out so then gajala said there's no breath in the baby he's still dead so away they went coming to the yard and now look at the crowd everybody around a wailing and screaming what a place for faith Elijah standing there no vision didn't know what to do all he could do was look around there was a father screamin there was all the neighbors and everybody carrying on well he goes around his little old chamber and the woman had the baby laying on the bed so he shut everyone out of the room and pulled the door together by himself went over in a corner knelt down began to pray when he got through praying he got up walked up and down the floor back and forth to and fro up and down the floor until the Spirit of God come upon him when the Spirit of God come upon him no doubt but what he saw a vision goes over stretches his stuff on top of the baby his nose again again his nose no no prayer notice that his nose against his nose no prayer just the nose against its nose lifts against its lips eyes against its eyes hands against his hands and the baby sneeze seven times and kind of like what was that that wasn't that preacher that was Christ in His Prophet that brought that baby back to life hallelujah oh my when he stood out there and said Gahan Zeke all this you know mighty man the woman come to the door then all the good things that she had done little did she know what she had that bed made in there for Elijah and made his bed with her own hands that someday her dead baby would be laying there and the body of that prophet through the Christ would bring that baby back to life again you don't know what's happening when you try to do something for one another try to help one another that's right like bread upon the water it'll return to you someday hallelujah Church one other quote that I want to read a man for you and we'll close this off today this is the message why Christ speak and I'm going back to paragraph 47 hallelujah align our faith just know that you know it might be spoken word to some it might be lay your hands for others it's still faith it might be touch to him of his garment it's still faith and God will honor your faith without faith it's impossible to please him listen now remember when Moses met this burning bush the word that word was a vindicated exactly it was the word Moses didn't have to worry what's this voice all about what is what is this being here because God had already wrote in the scripture in Genesis your people are sojourn in the strange land but they'll be brought back after 400 years we'll come back into this country again for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet fulfilled now hundreds and hundreds of years before God said that God had said that Israel was sojourn and mistreated in a strange country and would stay there for hundred years but God with a mighty hand would bring them out so you see with this burning bush Moses note this intellectually and the seed that was born in him was laying in his heart and a tribe through his intellectual experience with the word to try to bring them out to deliver them because he know he was born for that purpose he note that the time the scriptures all said that they had already been there for four hundred years before I go further I feel the Holy Spirit just telling me do not accept death don't accept it I mean whatever the doctors have said don't you accept the report of death take the report of faith a man by his stripes your heel glory to God just as we know now as a man asked me a few moments ago about the coming and the rapture we know we live the time out at the time of the render at the time of the raptures at hand and we're looking for a rapturing faith that can pull the church together and give it some supernatural strength that can change these bodies that we live in when we see a God that can raise the dead off the floor or out of the yard and bring them back to life again and present him before us when we see a God who can take a cancer that's eat a man to a shout and raise them up a strong healthy man that ought to give rapturing faith to the people we might not have saw a rapture in faith a man take a person down to a shadow but I mean assaults all cancer take a person down to a shadow but we we did see cancer heal and that itself ought to produce rapture faith see if we can't believe God for our bodies to be here how we gonna believe God for these bodies to be changed so we oughta have week we've been preaching it and now we saw the manifestation of it and I'm just trying to cap it off this is what's gonna produce rapture and faith in the people says that when the light when that light flashes from the sky and the trumpet sounds the body of Christ will be quickly gathered together and changed in a moment and take it into the heavens yes there's got to be something like that happen and our schools of theology can never produce that yet they intellectually are alright but you've got to meet that light you've got to find that something in church I believe we found that something a man has been laying here all the time we didn't realize that like that first quote when I first started on the rapture face program say I see a woman in the balcony she don't realize she got faith she don't know she got it they say but sister you got it and I'm telling you right here the devil been making you doubt that that you even got faith yes you got it that God didn't bring you this father leave you oh yes you got it we might have to go through a little suffering here and there every once in a while I mean I'm preaching y'all about faith and I got pain all through my link but I'm not I'm not thinking like that a manner I just keep applying the promises over night advice professor you know my faith says I don't have to be in spontaneous miracle but it's gonna be a miracle one day I'm gonna wake up and gonna be no more pain ain't gonna be no more pain praise the Lord I got a double promise on that a man I got a promise that by stripes I'm healed I got another promise that my body gonna be changed so one way or the other I'm gonna have a body with no pain I believe that church a man not and I'm not sure my faith is not just from my body my faith is for every other thing in my life my faith this is my family hey man I'm not care what I see no it's not it's what my faith sees my face see my whole family here rejoicing and praising God that's that's what my fave sing right a man church they man we go you know we all gonna be changed and I'm declaring that every influence is gonna be broken in the name of Jesus that you can't see nothing but Jesus all right amen glory to God we got to align this faith church we got to align this faith and I believe it is coming and alignment you know brother Branham was making a statement how if you were going overseas on a boat we say really the man that's up top he's not controlling the boat the captain he's not controlling the boat but what he is is what he sees he's telling a man down underneath he said not to knots to the right he said but if man down underneath when he here to not stood right and he turned it left they say he said he gonna mess up the boat he got to follow what the man up at up top is telling him praise the Lord and this is up top the Word of God is up top it's always up top you got to follow what the Word of God is telling you if it's a to - to the left - to the left - to the right - to the right whatever the words say that's what we're gonna follow we align our faith and we'll make it in amen into the other Shore praise the Lord let's have a word of Prayer my father we are so grateful a man for what we have thing you do your prophet has told us that no church can thrive into the supernaturals made known in the midst of the people something that they can talk to and something that will talk back to them and God we have just experienced that you you started us on this journey with these messages to build faith not knowing what we'd be going through but God you your anointed us even even when the storm came we still had a peace that passes all understanding that that kept our hearts and minds and to know God that not even a storm can can hinder this bride not even a storm no matter that here that the the newscaster sin is the biggest storm the worst storm that ever came to the coast and God but I thought about the people in those little islands where could they evacuate to where were they going how could they get out there was no place to go the safe place is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so father we're grateful that we found my place of safety and that you got provided that to each and every one of us we're grateful God that you kept us through this time and Lord you just anointed my faith I you didn't you didn't tell us to speak to the storm you didn't tell us to do that we know
