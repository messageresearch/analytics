certainly appreciate that tonight I'm glad brother Quentin told on the Saints a man that's that was a real blessing you know just it always means something amen you know every coming from the states and going going anywhere in Africa you know we just we just identified just on a different level right and and I remember the first time I went to Zimbabwe I told her brothers I said man we finally made it back with me and the brothers say well brother way there was never any slavery here in jean-bob whereas it may say well okay we have to find somewhere but it was just touching the soil and a man in Africa just meant so much to us and we thank God for things so good to have a man you thanks with us and just fellowshipping and thank you for for just blessing us they met with that on tonight a man now we know the job do that every time you come we'll be expecting a little something something something in Shona hey man hey man hey man praise the Lord thank y'all I appreciate y'all I'll let you all be seated I want to read actually just a scripture here from Luke 17 I read here from Psalm 105 words that make known as deeds among all men and and tonight I just kind of had in my spirit just to come in off of the Lord some things a man he is worthy of the praise and it's been so good and I just felt there would be robbery if we just didn't stop and just take a moment just to thank him for some of the things that he has done the metaphors here in Luke 17 and you all would stand with me amen I'll start reading at verse 11 a man is that right yes Luke 17 and verse 11 says and it came to pass as he went to Jerusalem that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee and as he entered into a certain village there met him ten men that were lepers which stood afar off and they lifted up their voices and said Jesus master have mercy on us and when he saw them he said unto them go show yourselves into the priests and it came to pass that as they went they were cleansed and one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back and with a loud voice glorified God a man and fell down on his face at his feet giving him thanks and he was a Samaritan and Jesus answering said where there not ten cleansed where are the nine they are not found that returned to give glory to God save this stranger and they said unto Him arise go thy way thy faith have made the whole man thank God for the reading of his word let's just pray father we thank you for the reading of Scripture and as this this little story or a parable that you give us of this the ten lepers and God just how they responded they realize that you were the one able to do this you could cleanse them from their leprosy and brother Branham even tells us that because they had confidence in you because they cared enough to come to you you cared enough to do something about their situation the unfortunate part here is that only one returned to give you thanks and tonight Lord we want to just stop and take some time just to offer our thanks for how good you have been to us God we we we could never repay you for goodness that you have given in the blessings that you have bestowed and as a psalm was just saying showers of blessings showers God that's that's that's kind of what we've been seeing here and just in the weather just showers a little bit come and then it stops and then a little bit more come and then it stops and then a little bit more coming then it stops it a little bit more come and father that's what you've done to us spiritually so father how we just want to express our appreciation we want to express our love won't express our gratitude here in this place tonight we give you the glory the honor and the praise in Jesus name Amen amen god bless you can be seated I don't necessarily have a title for this sermon tonight but it's just more of you know a opportunity to just express to God amen thank you I just went back to that that scripture in Luke 17 and you know brother Branham made the comment about it that you know these these guys cared enough to believe that Jesus could do something about this situation and Jesus cared enough to actually do something about it and I believe he's proving that to us throughout this year you know things that we've carried to the Lord in prayer he's cared enough about us to actually do something about it a man and and and and the least that we can come back to do on this night is just tell the Lord thank you right God God we appreciate all that you have done and all that you will do we appreciate that but you know as we started the year off a man I just went back to to the beginning of the year and the very first sermon Lord gave us this year was the year of the incredible so I'm just you put them some closing comments a man on an incredible year a man that's all I'm making tonight is just some closing comments on an incredible year glory to God amen there's a scripture in Matthew 17 because this is one of the scriptures that we read when we started the year with talking about this is a this is a year than credibly declared it by faith and God certainly met that expectation he actually exceeded it but here Matthew 17 verse 14 through 21 says and when they were come to the multitude there came to him a certain man kneeling down to him and saying lord have mercy on my son for he is lunatic and sore vex for all times he falleth into the fire and oft into the water and I brought him to thy disciples and they could not cure him all right so this man is bringing them to people that are fellowship with the Lord Jesus they're hanging with Jesus and this man's got confidence that if these guys are as close to Jesus as they are they should be able to do something about this they should be able to get this situation resolved right and this man had confidence and the disciples but here we see something he really makes a statement he says they could not cure him they tried they tried I'll read it quote here in a second brother branham you know was saying how what the disciples were doing is really their approach to it well the way that they were approaches like let me show you how I did it let me show you how I did it let me show you it was more of a competition Oh glory to God amen and I want to tell you when we're dealing with the supernatural things of God it cannot be a competition hallelujah amen what what it has to be you know everything that when we talk about spoken word Authority amen that cannot be based on competition why do you want to speak that why do you need that what what's the purpose of that right you know brother Branham tells us that is based on motive and objective a man so if our motive and objective is not right then we won't get the results that we're looking for but he the disciples didn't really have the right motives they were actually competing with one another they knew they had the authority because Jesus gave them the authority and the power to cast out Devils but when it came to this case they fail hallelujah glory to God so so the problem is a man's the way that they were approaching this now let's look at this a Manticore little further verse 17 the man's bringing this case to Jesus say Jesus answer said o faithless and perverse generation how long shall I be with you how long shall I suffer you bring him hither to me and and I love this there's a confidence that Jesus has there is a a man he has complete control over the situation he's actually showing that there's nothing too hard hallelujah amen I don't care what you facing bring it to me bring it to the Lord Jesus amen he can take care of it Oh glory to God we brought many things to the Lord Jesus this year and he's taking care of many things God we couldn't do nothing with it but God did Oh hallelujah bring it to me bring it to me whatever it is that's what he says bring it to me Oh glory glory glory glory it says in the bottle saying Jesus rebuked the devil Jesus rebuked the devil and he departed out of him and the child was cured from that very hour praise God verse verse 19 says then came two disciples to Jesus apart and said why could not we cast him out and even Jesus and we handled he handled it privately with them he didn't you know just rebuked him openly but he just he handled them privately he just told him why they couldn't get this done he said jesus said unto them because of your unbelief for verily I said to you if you have faith as a grain of a mustard seed ye shall say unto this mountain remove hence to yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you what a statement right because we all realize there's nothing impossible with God but now he reverses this and says nothing will be impossible unto you and the only thing you need a man to overcome the impossible is faith the size of a mustard seed Oh glory now you know I I don't know how many of you all still have your mustard seed in your Bible it should be laying right there on that scripture and as I open up my Bible tonight one of my mussel seeds fell out all right I said I'll put it right back in there you'll already got because I'm believing God I'm gonna have faith the size of a mustard seed and what must that see faith is it's pure unadulterated faith right it's faith that cannot be mixed with anything else faith that will not mix with anything else right it's not sometimes faith sometimes doubt it's faith all the time glory to God it's faith in this year it's faith that's going into the next year and if the Lord Terry will have faith the next year glory to God your faith remains the same all the time no matter what you're facing no matter what you're going through it you must maintain that same level of faith Oh hallelujah it made me sense he says remove heads to yonder place in the shell removing nothing shall be impossible unto you howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting now just a little quote here this is going to come from the message Jesus Christ the same yesterday a man today and forever and the date I'm giving you 61 - 0 5 1 6 a and the paragraph number is going to be e - 30 praise the Lord says when the disciples was given power to heal the sick 10 days later we found them defeated on an epileptic case and I'd imagine Peter saying wait I'll show you how I down at Capernaum and the other ones saying I'll show you how I did it and none of them can make this demon leave the child but when Jesus came and the father went to see Jesus and he said I brought him to your disciples and they could do nothing for him and I brought him to you he said I can if you believe for all things are possible to them that believe and the child he's going to refer to another scripture he says and the child went into the hardest fit ever had oh my that means it seemed like it got worse before it got better a man some of you all the faced situations where it seemed like it got worse before it got better holiday that is just a devil trying to knock you off of the promise hallelujah amen you still must maintain faith in the myths when it looked like he got worse I smoked it and it got worse I did this and it got worse but always understand it gets worse before it gets better hallelujah it will get better if you would only believe hallelujah amen I want to encourage you if there are some things that you were looking for God to do this year amen and you have not yet received or remember we still in the fourth quarter Amen we still in the fourth quarter God can still do it amen this year but if it does not happen carry the promise over into the next year because God is going to bring it to pass hallelujah it may get worse but it will get better thank you Jesus hey man listen he go he going says this in the quote he says it says if you can if you believe for all things are possible in that belief and the child went into the hardest fitted ever hand because the devil knew that he meant faith on a different level now we saw that was the first quote God gave us this year that the devil knew he meant faith on a different level glory to God then then what the Apostle says and I just believe that God is an order a man in the sold a different level glory glory glory amen III believe my face is on a different level than it was before and I'm without--without when I find myself doing is reminding myself of what God has already done hallelujah if he's done it before I know you'll do it again and there is nothing impossible to God nothing impossible Oh hallelujah he says he faints on a different level than what the apostles had he met a perfect faith and that's what we must have perfect faith to make the perfect Word of God perform perfectly amen perfect faith to make the perfect Word of God perform perfectly that's it we must believe it without a shadow of doubt see that's that's what that's what must have see faith is it's faith that will not allow doubt to get in God wants us to have that type of faith you know it's going to take this type of faith for us to make a rapture it's going to take a perfect faith for us to make a rapture and I believe the Lord allowed certain things just to challenge our faith to raise us to that next level amen in him and and and I thank God that you know we have it we've elevated we've elevated in our faith I know the devil try said now you doubted here you doubted that but no I did believe here amen and I got what I believe for praise God and and some must believe through some some some tumultuous situations Amen but he made away he made away a man God made away and I'm gonna just remind us of a little bit of some of the things that the Lord did this year Oh glory glory glory glory I just came to worship him that's all a man and now here's the thing and and I want to go to this this statement I've been I shared this this is gonna come out of Jehova of miracles jehovah of miracles the the date on this is 59 - 11 26 and the numbers II - 28 I made reference of this a man while we were at pinnacle Palms just on Sunday and you know coming through the Christmas season last year and the Lord just kind of given us this sermon amen oh nothing is impossible nothing is impossible and we looked at Mary and you know just just when you think about her being able to give birth to a baby and not being touched by a man if there was anything that was impossible that should have been it that should have been it right there but what we find the scriptures that Mary gave birth to Christ right and she got pregnant just through the spoken word hallelujah not not not not and it was there was a couple of things this and that we got we're gonna look at here in this quote but she got pregnant because she was able to receive the word right and brother Branham said that she she didn't she didn't she didn't doubt at all there's one one place she didn't argue with the angel right no no no fussing and fighting with the angel you know she said how could these things be that was a first question because I ain't never heard of that like this but how could these things be he say the Holy Spirit will overshadow you and you have the child and and in-residence say now you know that ain't never happened before that's not that's not Mary's response that's that's not the way she talking to the angel and I'm not come on now you're gonna make me come on you want me to go tell somebody that that's not how she responded she said be it unto me according to thy word and because she was able to receive the word she could receive the manifestation and to make if you are able to receive work then you can receive your manifestation hallelujah we don't need nothing else but the word even if it goes against what the doctor says as long as I got God's Word I am standing on something solid hallelujah glory to God we don't have the weight to it feel nothing we don't have to wait till we see nothing we got the Word of God we could move out with that hallelujah this this is what Mary this is how Mary actually a man was able to produce Christ it's because she was able to receive the words glory to God she was able to receive the word now look at this in jehovah miracles the Prophet says now the angel Gabriel six months later had visited Mary and told her that her cousin was going to have a baby also so Mary knew that that would be a miracle of that old woman well stricken in age having a baby but she said to the angel how shall it be with me seeing that I do not know a man and ask and you shall receive since he said the Holy Ghost is going to overshadow you that holy thing which shall be born of you shall be called the Son of God that's how it's going to happen Mary never talked back to the angel I like that don't question God Mary never talked back to the angel she never discussed it in any way and then the only thing she said was Behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to thy word did you think even that even the priests acker ayats that question him being an old man and her old - well no this is Zechariah and Elizabeth went when the angel came to Zechariah he's wondering about you know I'm old she old this they never happened he got out now he's a priest he should be believing but you know and and here he's a teacher of these things but but now he's there but Mara never doubted and you know because Zacharias doubted he lost his ability to be able to speak ain't that something I want you to think about that tonight because he doubt it he lost his ability to be able to speak hallelujah amen so so if we're gonna have faith then it should release something out of our mouth hallelujah but if you doubt you may lose your ability to speech Oh hallelujah God could of God get a lot in the loses ability with with walking them and maybe something else but God said no you're not gonna be able to speak that's how important it is for us to only say what God says man you just got visited by an angel angel told you this this was not another man speaking this but an angel came to you and said this and you got out what the angel say don't you fuss with the angel honey Oh glory to God don't argue with an angel now I can say something there but I don't want to throw you Oh hallelujah amen do you know something when the word is coming forth to you a man JEP I'm innocent that's an angel the Lord coming to you speaking to you but sometimes we just get caught up in the flesh the veil if I can put it that way we get so messed up with the veil that we can't see or hear God be careful don't argue with the angel you might lose your ability to speak all right let's go a little further he says so did you think even the priest Sakurai's that question him being an old man and her old to how this would be done and a pre-suit should know the word and know what God did but this little virgin was just a child and she had no husband had to believe the Impossibles something that had never happened before but she never argued she never questioned anymore his word was enough for her I got a question is the word enough for you tonight if God just give you a promise out of his word is that enough to keep you know I when I read this a man you know well when I preached this early in a year we struck that point and just you know the word being enough there were it be enough and and God had given me a scripture a man out of I might as well read it I'll read it again because I want the devil to know that this is enough for me jeremiah 32:40 one man I need that's all I need is what God said is where sometimes when you're reading the Bible what happens that the Lord just it's like the scripture just get anointed and it just rise up out of the pages of the Bible in and just begins to speak to your situation right where you are hallelujah that happened with brother Simba when he ran across that 320 a man Ephesians 3:20 it just rose up and and just spoke right to the situation so this this is something that the Lord gave us and and you know God has done so much and and God knows that I'm I still got my faith on the lie for a little bit more hey man I you know and they could happen it could happen this year if not I'm still I'm going to carry it over a man I'm care I'm gonna carry it over glory to God amen but this is what the Lord that was spoke to me and and and and this is concerning a man the church and the school that we looking forward to a man III wrote by the other day I show brother deny where it was he like this is yet brother yeah yeah everybody see it as an agreement everybody's in agreement and you know we just we just waiting on the Lord we won't get ahead of him we won't get in front of him we can't make nothing happen but but we can have faith and just believe right he could turn hearts and do whatever whatever needs to happen God can do it but God gave me the scripture and it says yay I will rejoice over them to do them good and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul and I'm believing God that Scripture is gonna take us to a church named man and I'm gonna keep believing for that church until God say no on that church hallelujah that's what my faith that right and and I'm just gonna stand on this word just like Mary stood on her promise we're gonna stand on our promise Oh hallelujah you know he's done too much to me to doubt he done too much to me to actually consider other things somebody ain't even actually why don't you look at it others no not I ain't giving up on that until God say so and I know when God say so when somebody else by I know I know it went mine praise God and then I know this much to somebody else by then God got something much better for me but long as that's there I'm gonna keep believing God for it glory to God oh Jesus we we start testifying at the beginning a year we start praying over it faster no we've been we've been doing a lot you know concerning it and we just we just commit it to the hands of the Lord he knows how to take care of things in his time but my face is still on the line I'm still standing on that Satan praise God hey man I just wanted him to know that all right let me let me go on a little further here Mary all she had was was the Word of God and she had the the brother branham said she had to believe the impossible this was a man how can a virgin conceived she had to stand there and believe for the impossible she had nobody else that she could actually look to and say this happened to them this this happened to this person she was the first person not only at first but the only person this would ever happen to my god she had to stand on her conviction and tonight I want to tell you you gonna have to do the same thing sometimes when God speaks to you stand on your conviction it may not happen to your brother your sister but you have to stand on what God has done or what God has spoke to you praise God it may seem impossible amen but God's gonna do something incredible all right let's read this last quote on that go to paragraph ether T in the same message just go to paragraph ether t says you got thousands of examples of divine healing look at the people's been healed with cancer blindness dumbness deafness all kinds of sickness and diseases we've got plenty of that to look at as example but this little girl didn't have nothing but justice words amen justice word and that was sufficient his word was good enough for her and I want you to notice she didn't wait till she was positive amen it was going to happen she started testifying about it right away she being wait till she's felt life so she could be positive she was going to have the baby just as soon as she heard his word she took him at his word and she started testifying and praising God for the baby before she felt anything hallelujah he said give us more mary's around here that can take God at His Word and praise him whether you feel nothing or not oh my we need some omaree's right and and and and I just love the way the Prophet put that we ain't gotta wait you know and this was at the beginning of the year too I said you know what we gonna do when we enter into the new church how y'all gonna act actually all that question how you gonna act when you get into the new church let me I'll say y'all gon shout the place down and I say you ain't gotta wait til you get to the new church shut the place down you can start shouting now huh well I'm living for this week won't you go ahead and start giving some practice that way you can perfect your place but get some practice now why are you here so when you go there you can do whatever you want to do hallelujah a man ain't man y'all they've seen no dancing yet yeah y'all ever seen brother simply cut his cut one I mean he he can dance but we're gonna get in

at the very end of the sermon sister Marva came up and gave a testimony and in her testimony she began to express how the Lord just gave her a vision coming to some gathering where most of my family was and she saw my daughter at the gathering and and it was just an opportunity for her to go and just sow a seed you know if my daughter just encourage you come on back to the house of the Lord and God opened up that door so and the way that God opened up the door he calls to have trouble with her car now we don't see this is way we got to understand this every time you have a problem doesn't really mean that it's a problem but there's something could be masked behind that oh my got to get this now because it'll change the way that you look at your issues you know they won't become issues all the time hallelujah but it's like okay God why'd you stop me here what I mean a sister about having a problem in the car she couldn't go home she had to wait for us to carry at home and and the care at home she had to come to the house God just orchestrated so many things to put her in position to speak that word now for me to see that manifests I got complete confidence that God gonna do the rest of this I say he ain't done yet he ain't done yet I and just with the restoration that I did see my faith has been elevated I'm believing God for more oh Jesus restoration Church growth what about healings that God did this year you know just you know we just heard from brother brother Joe underlined they come right here to this church come through a prayer line him and his wife had not been able to conceive for seven years a prayer line that happened in this church God touched his wife's body and they get me to have their first baby and 2020 that that's a miracle that took place here I remember also during those same services sister sister Michelle testified how God touched her body and heal her you know of a condition that she was going through there with her back I believe and and another I'm gonna I'm telling the devil I'm claiming this one a few weeks ago we came in and we preached send the word send the word the Norton was so powerful sister Dixon come out the church start worshipping and praising God outside put down her cane walked out to the parking lot and the next sir she came back without the King now I know I know how the enemy is you don't like that testimony so he want to keep attacking Isis but Satan you are like we are claiming her complete and total healing we claiming that in Jesus name ha-la-lu we already thought my god did you're not gonna take it from us Oh hallelujah this year brought some trials one of our sisters lost both her father and her mother this year but the testimony that goes with her mother it's something that we were not allowed a devil to take from us a mother was in the hospital and had already code it doctor said that's it she's coated nurses worked on it for a little bit and they were able to get a restored when he got a restored they called and start telling us you know what was going on and we went to visit at the hospital and and one of the one of her sisters was telling us about a an experience that her young daughter had there at the house and she was saying that you know she said we were at home you know at mama said mama said us I see this this young lady that's here in our house and she she wants to come upstairs but she's afraid and she just stand downstairs she just stand out says she wants to come up here but I'm looking at her mama she's a young lady and she wants to come up but she's just afraid so she stand down so when I went to the hospital and I heard them talking about this you know being message believers our prophet share so much with us that you know we hear things that other people don't hear because we know that the Prophet told us that we go back to being a young person when we go to the other side know that right so here this lady that's generally descendants and about four years old what what what would a four year old what what what would they gain by sharing an experience like this very innocent heart that God uses so I say I say oh she wanted to go upstairs but she was afraid and so she stands downstairs I said oh she's not ready to go meet God I said I got to get into her room and I got to be able to talk to her and and I had all kind of opposition different ones saying we don't want nobody here visiting we just only want the family and I had all kind of opposition I said well let me just slip down the hall so I'm not I'm not saying I'll just pray and we God open up a door I'm going right there into that room and I'm gonna talk to this lady by giving her heart to the Lord now the Lord opened up the door and you know they kicked everybody out the room and in the Lord and everybody kind a lot of them went home so I just stayed in hospital the Lord opened up the door and I walked right on through and I said okay I just need to get right in her ear she couldn't respond amen the way that you all could respond to me tonight but they say that when a person is leaving the last thing that go is their hearing so I got right in her ear not told her the experience that a granddaughter hat and I say what that meant to me is that you were not ready to go I say ma'am you might not be able to repeat these words but I want to lead to to the Lord Jesus so that you will be ready to go hallelujah and I began to pray with that lady right there in the room her family was there many of them witnesses and within a couple days after that experience God called her home God brought her back in order to get her ready to go God brought her back hallelujah they wasn't the nurses that brought her back God brought her back in order to get her ready to go and God positioning placed us so we could be there I was reading a quote and I won't have time to read it here tonight but brother Branham said you know sometimes he say when I lost my mother he said no actually I didn't lose my mother I didn't lose her she just went ahead of me and she's just waiting on me to get there as a believer you don't lose nobody they just went ahead of you I start thinking about my daddy I ain't lose my daddy he just went ahead of me and just waiting on me to get there you know I daddy always went ahead of you well you know in order to teach me how to drive daddy had to go ahead and me in order to teach me how to ride how to ride a bicycle daddy had to do it before I did it huh and order to handle myself in search situations to give me wisdom on how to handle myself daddy had to go through those things before I did daddy went through it before I did any just waiting on me to come church I'm encouraged I'm encouraged this has been an incredible year I want to read you a quote here from why Christ speak the daintiness is 63-0 7 1 4 m 63-0 7 1 4 m and the paragraph numbers 161 maybe there are some things here tonight they say I'm still holding on and I know we got some things that we still believe in God for a man there's we had I believe eight houses and or apartments or whatever it was this year but there's one more we still wait now there's at least one more we wait so God ain't done yet my god I ain't done yet and and and and my faith is just on the line for some more incredible things but but here this thing I want to encourage you with this quote the Prophet says for you see faith sees what God wants done faith looks to see what God wants and it works accordingly that's what faith does it sees what God wants and what God wants done and faith operates through that he says this faith is a long-range vision that means faith don't just stop December 31st come on somebody faith gonna keep going over to the next year hallelujah faith is a long-range vision and look at this it don't lower its sights if the thing if Satan coming try to bring some doubt he might as well forget about it faith will not lower its sights look at this it holds to the target it says Amen any good shooter knows that see that is a long range it's a telescope it's a binocular that you don't look around here you don't use binoculars to look to see what time it is see you don't use that but you use binoculars to look away off and faith does that faith picks up gospel oculus both of them both sides the New Testament and the Old Testament and sees every promise that he made and faith sets it out yonder and faith chooses that regardless of what the present tense says here can I say that again faith chooses that regardless of what the present tense says here he looks at the end he don't drop his sights down to look this away he looks out yonder he keeps the crosshair danced centered on the word that's what faith does that's the faith that's in man that does those things I want to encourage you keep your faith your crosshair is dead sitting on it and don't look don't lose sight of your target you have what your axe got for a man we see it's not impossible for him but he said there's nothing impossible for us and I believe that this has been an incredible year and I just wanted to just take some time tonight just to thank the Lord for all these tremendous things that he's done for this this group of believers god is good god is good and I don't I don't know who wouldn't want to serve a god like this a Manny blesses beyond my expectations hallelujah so many things so many things that the Lord has done and my mind just annoys me just to believe for for more for more he's not a God that does less is a God that does more amen let's pray father we're just grateful and want to just take a little time Lord to make mention of the great deeds that you've done in our mence you've proven yourself Lord to be Jehovah Jireh Oh God providing houses cars apartments Lord you you'd proven to be Jehovah Rapha and providing healings God we've seen you do restorations we watch your Lord and in just so many ways just the the the many things God that I some things that just went mine we never saw it coming we never expected it but God you did it shows how Lord that even as you spoke to us doing the exceeding the abundant above all we can ask a thank God we saw you do that we saw you do that so Lord if our faith Lord just might get a little weak help us Lord just to remind ourselves that these things that you've already done and it will anoint us God to just believe you to keep the cross hairs on the target we know there's more where this came from well that's the the man that ate the watermelon and the Prophet told a story and they asked him did you enjoy the watermelon did you enjoy they say yeah I did but it's got to be more where that came from God that's the way we feel tonight it's certainly more where these blessings came from so we're praying God that the showers would just continue to fall and Lord as different hearts different needs that are even represented in this place tonight father we know there's nothing too hard for you Jesus you got our heart that turns wayward people father back to your presence you are one God that a man God that that that that that reconciles you restore you do all kind of great things Lord Jesus father we just believing that you're gonna do even more my faith is on the line for God my own daughter and my son-in-law and grandson what I even got sisters brother I got family God that leads you Jesus Lord and and I know many of them have walked in this way before I know they know about it Jesus free that you just meet them right with er God no matter how the devil might presented law it may make a snake Lord that is just impossible father you are an incredible God you do the impossible things so Lord we're just believing God that we'll see them worshipping again we're seeing praise them again we'll see them serving again we'll we'll see it with our own eyes that's our expectation and whatever other needs Lord might be in this place that might God we just commit it all to you and help us to only believe Lord God no matter what it is that we're facing lord help us to only believe if we have faith the size of a mustard seat nothing will be impossible that's not what we said but that is what you said and God we say a man to what you said help us to be like Mary don't argue with the angel father help us just to stand
