happen on earth junction when he allowed resurrection to come on earth so everything has got a junction that the lord deals with amen and in the life of his people in the ministry of jesus christ the lord gives us junctions that we go through amen the gospel goes through junctions human beings go through junctions men and women go through junctions and the body of christ goes through junctions of time amen so you can never do without junctions the life was full of junctions when when is friday you are happy thank god it's friday you come back to uh friday relax saturday sunday church before you could say jack monday is here again you have to turn another junction and go back to work so even in the weekdays we have junctions that we have to partition through those junctions and the lord has equipped you and i to partition through every junction that is before you glory hallelujah to the lord amen and amen and amen blessed be the name of the lord jesus christ we want to read a couple of scriptures we want to read from matthew i'm sorry if you have my powerpoint you can project it for me please god bless you brothers we want to read from matthew chapter 25 verse 6 it's just one scripture and we read a couple of other scriptures matthew 25 6. we want to talk about junctions of time and at that midnight there was a crimea behold the bride the bridegroom cometh goi out to meet him and at that meet time and at midtime sorry there was a crimea behold the bridegroom cometh going out to meet him now the scripture is talking about a bridegroom coming and he said go ye out to meet him he didn't qualify who should go out and meet him so it's open right anybody can go and meet the bridegroom the bridegroom was qualified but then who should go meet him wasn't qualified so anybody can put himself there hey i'm the bridegroom i'm going to meet up going to meet the bride it's open statement but then let's read um let's go to another scripture let's go to revelation 1 17 sorry one seven you begin to put meat on the flesh remember the scripture about ezekiel then the dry bones there were dry bones in other words just a it's just a form of life but the lord hasn't put flesh on the life so let's see how the lord put flesh on the body of his wife amen so revelation 1 7 it goes behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierce him and all the kindreds of the earth shall will because of him even so amen they will cry because of him so now the bible is talking about how he's coming he so doesn't qualify who should go meet him but he said he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him the eyes of the predecessor shall see him and even those who pierce him they will see him and all the kindreds of the earth amen let's go to the next scripture which is revelation 19 7 now is going to qualify who actually met the bridegroom amen revelation 19 7 says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife has made herself ready amen let us rejoice and be glad and give anna to him for the marriage of the lamp has come and his wife has made herself ready you may take your seat god bless you so now matthew was talking about a groom coming we don't know who's going to meet him whether it's his friends his family his mom and dad because a groom is a human being he's got relationships but then he said we should go and meet him so that we can make certain assumptions that the bride should go meet the groom and then as we read further now their brother has already met a groom and the bride is rejoicing with his groom and the marriage is already come in the kingdom's version coming is already taking place it's already in activity it's going on amen it's no longer something in the future it's something which is happening and it happened and it's happening amen now in the seven churches the lord wanted to pick a wife or a bride for himself so he sent messengers to go look for a wife or a bride for him he sent the first messenger as we know paul to go and look for a body of uh to go and look for a wife for him and there was certain measurement they needed to measure up to to qualify to be the wife of king jesus christ now if we read uh let me go back a little bit the lord wrote three bibles the first bible the lord wrote was the uh the zodiac which is the sky we know until until noah there was no clouds you could see the sun you could see the moon as it is you don't have to shoot telescope to be able to just catch a glimpse and pieces of the planet all the planet planetary bodies are just in plain view so prophet like adam job they didn't have to read these paper bibles that we read they didn't have to use uh put bible internet they look at the sky and they could see the sun it's christ jesus the moon is his wife and all the stars are the body of christ sons and daughters of christ from adam to the last one the second bible is the pyramid and the paramedic was actually built by enoch we know scientists they call them egyptologists they try to study the pyramid how could they i mean human beings take stones which way tons of kilograms into the sky they don't know because prophets are christ sons and daughters of god are christ and they speak into creation so enoch didn't have to construct use brick missions to construct a pyramid he's put them into creation and enoch was a testimony of the blessing of the love of christ the lord was going to destroy the world at that time he was ending a generation he was ending a dispensation to create a new dispensation so the lord used enoch to build a testimony that is not going to destroy the earth entirely but he was going to wipe their sin and the unbelief and the unbelievers out of the earth but then for the testimony of his life the lord allowed enoch to speak pyramid into creation which wasn't destroyed during the anti-anti-diluvian distraction as a testimony of justification that the lord has justified the earth the earth is his love and regardless of her sins of iniquity the bloodshed the lord will pay whatever price to redeem the earth so enoch spoke the pyramid of egypt into creation and is still standing tall and loom as of now amen glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be the lord then in the pyramid the bible sorry let me go back a little bit to the zodiac the zodiac is made up of 12 houses as we have the paper bible we have how many 66 books if i'm right the zodiac has got 12 houses and every one of you were born in a certain house in a certain month under a certain sign under the zodiac sign your emotions your mannerism your the way your demeanor is all from the house that you are born under some people are just emotional they can cry easily and in the same situation other people will eat and they'll be happy and be giggling there's a saying that a problem that can cause the dog to bark the dog will go through this sorry the cat will go through the same problem and just sitting down and watching it doesn't bother the cat but the dog if he sees a neighbor around he'll be screaming and crying and yelling for everybody to know that they say somebody passing around but the cat will just sit down and watch the person the passerby because they've got different nature they were born under different signs in your children in your family you're conceiving your children one is god this nature one is stronger one seems to be like a weakling one is more reserved one is open one is troublemaker one is different ones in the family and the lord put them there for a purpose amen and you have to love all of them they all serve a purpose and you're gonna find out the purpose they will save as they grow amen glory hallelujah to the lord so then back to the zod back to the uh pyramid pyramid has got seven steps just as uh the zodiac has got 12 houses which is from the month that we were born in the 12 cents of jacob and the 12 12 you can the 12 types in the in the bible now the seventh the pyramid types the seven you go through the first step and every parameter has to have a foundation so the foundation every building is in the form of a pyramid this wouldn't have a foundation you can't build a building in the sky you have to have a foundation so what is the foundation jesus christ the foundation of the church and then the seven church ages were there then they have the chamber the chamber is where the king is that is the eighth the eighth chamber which is the eighth day which is eternity now to cross over from the seventh chamber to the a chamber you're gonna see a messenger or a guard security guard and the god is going to tell you where do you want to go he said i want to go married to jesus christ okay now you have to take off all your clothes and get this clothes if you really want to go to the a chamber and if you don't want it you can say goodbye adios and go back if you want to go to the ace chamber to be messy jesus christ then you have to strip yourself your character your nature how you were born and then pick his nature pick is the major nature of pure white the holy ghost baptism wash you water in the snow then you don't you are no longer yourself you are now jesus christ his genes is in you his blood has been transfused in you and you become a new creation in christ jesus then you can boldly cross the seventh chamber to the eighth chamber but many people get to the seventh chamber they are not able to go to the a chamber glory hallelujah because of the pleasures of the world but those that were predicted before the foundation of the world regardless of what they would lose they will lose it and get married to the king of kings amen glory hallelujah so the lord used enough to build this a foundation to be a sign then the lord brought uh his i think his grandson or great-grandson noah was either grandson or great-grandson of uh of enoch so the bible said that lord never sent two prophets at the same time there could be two prophets on earth but the lord doesn't use them at the same time a church cannot have two pastors no it doesn't happen there's only one pastor there could be associated ministers or associate pastors but there's only one pastor in a church a woman cannot have two husbands or three there can be only one husband and one wife amen so the lord is the king and the husband of us all amen glory hallelujah so the lord sent in the seven churches the lord wanted to build a pyramid the natural pyramid that enoch spoke into creation was a type of the pyramid the lord was going to build and even before then that we know when we split scientists can split the world into seven continents different ones asia africa north america south america and so on and so forth europe but now before then before noah there was only one earth and all the waters were around just like an island there was no reverse meandering between the earth but then in the times of noah when rain noah spoke when his grandfather was raptured he quickly knew it was his time to be on the scene noah means a comforter the lord wanted to comfort the earth so when his grandfather enoch was raptured the lord anointed noah to take his place to begin to say there's going to be a rain and the said people said you must be crazy rain what is it we know water from the coming from the earth are springs from the water breath what is rain we have not even seen it before so what well that says the lord there's going to be a rain and noah seems to be like a crazy person what is rain and that's where godly people are amen those old prophets and old women they were ragged they didn't have bible people to read they didn't have reference they didn't have a job to preach to them but they were men and women who were ragged they went by inspiration from within out the holy ghost anointed them and they could stand in the face of death and mock death amen and that is the way as a christian you have to take your stance for the lord your stance is not because you are coming to church for somebody to pamper you to somebody to make you happy for somebody to give you money or for somebody to make you uh to i missing your praises but you are here for eternal life amen you are here nothing can offend you nothing because christ put you here amen if you can if you are easily offended then you are not ready to walk with the lord glory hallelujah to the lord so in the seven and churches the lord sent messengers and every age spark kim in his time and the body of christ we're married to the anointed word for the of the word christ and the word is the same amen because he's the one who lives in his word and so they went over through seven churches and in 1906 there was one of the greatest revival pentecostal revival on earth which took place right here in in the united states it started in california as user asus reviva 1906 maybe i could be off on the date in 1933 around the same time 1909 a man called william brown was born april 26th in a bakersfield kentucky and this one was just a strange person he was born in a strange way his ways were very strange but the lord had a purpose for his life he grew up and he saw the pentecostal time in 1933 there was a a a phenomena on ohio river this one was baptizing people the lord has opened to him revelation of jesus christ because the church has gone through the dark ages and even things that were simple doctrine of baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ has been taken from from the word of the lord so now they've put in place of that uh trinity which means god the made three god father son god the father goddess got the holy ghost but the lord that god is one so this man called the revelation and was baptizing people in the name of the lord jesus christ and there was a light a supernatural light not just a light but the lord jesus christ himself as he vindicated john the baptist on ohio river sorry on river jordan this time he vindicated vindicated his prophet on ohio river in 1933. so the lord like i said love the earth the lord will never forsake the earth so he loves your earth he'll never forsake you so you redeem you regardless of the condition and so the lord began to manifest 1933 commissioned a prophet told him about the coming of christ told him about things he's apt to do in the near future 1946 there was one of the greatest revival a healing revival on earth even beyond the times of jesus christ said brother how do you say that well read the message talking you find out that the lord it wasn't willie abraham it was jesus christ just borrowed the flesh of willy abraham and jesus christ want to borrow your flesh to do the same works amen all that i'm speaking is history but we want to bring it to our time in real time we just want to lay a background amen the lord is not dead no he's a living being if he borrowed the flesh of william abraham martha marry rebecca and manifested the lord is burning the flesh of brother jagdaf but a solomon brotherhood's way sister all my sisters and brothers to use amen and what we need to do is to know who we are as our sisters were singing this morning the authority has been given to us that you speak and whatever you desire when you speak it you believe it you don't look at the circumstance but you look at the word that you spoke and what you spoke will be given to you amen glory hallelujah so 1946 saw the greatest healing revival on earth up to that time the lord anointed his servant willie abraham to go to the word preaching seven times going around i mean went around the earth seven times preaching healing only believe all things are possible only believe all things are possible only believe cancer is healed healable only believe it doesn't matter death can be raised only believe whatever sin you have could be forgiven only believe all things are possible only believe amen just two ways only believe amen there's no god is not complicated he's so simple amen and he does simple things because his people are simple so only believe and 19 the same time the prophet the prophet prophesied that israel is restored back to their homeland the prophet you have to speak the word the prophet didn't have to carry jet plane or helicopter and carry israel from the nation from russia from u.s to israel but the way that he spoke the word is here and amen and the word that you speak your word can go and create your word can anoint someone to bring you the desire you might not have what you have what you need in your hands but when you stand as a daughter of god in the authority of the word and when you speak by inspiration of the holy ghost you just can't sit back and relax because your word is life your word is a creative voice and what you see there's a power it doesn't matter your flesh it doesn't matter your sickness but the power authority of christ in you will cause your flesh to obey the word that you speak that's why you have to speak positive don't speak negative if you speak negative you're going to receive negative but you speak healing to your body you're going to receive healing it doesn't matter how long it doesn't matter the process it's going to happen just as you spoke it amen and that's what the lord is trying to do this hour to let you know who you are that is hiding in your flesh is it brother but i smiley was there a couple of weeks ago he gave it he was preaching he got to a place said i don't need mine i don't even need my my sermon no more i'm the same one amen i don't need to give you quotes on the quotes amen and that's what the lord has brought us to sometimes you don't even need people in this computer so listen you are the bible amen you are the pill of fire amen there was a time samson went to he was he was in the lost way and he met enemies that he didn't encounter he didn't envisage more than thousand people he didn't have a gun he didn't have a coat he didn't have a scripture he didn't have a pastor to preach to him at that time they were going to kill him that was what he was facing and what did he do he just saw a jawbone of an ass he grabbed it and you know he was a seed of jehovah he grabbed it and the anointing came upon samson how could you use a jawbone of an ass to kill thousand people where the thousands were just sitting there looking at you killing them they were fighting back but there was an annoying it wasn't samson it wasn't the jawbone but a supernatural person took over the jawbone took over samson and slayed the enemies thousand of them amen what problem do you have now that the lord cannot do for you what is your worry what is your trouble why are you crying it's okay to cry but after crying wipe your tears and speak as a daughter of god and speak as a son of the living god for your word is not a word of a man your word is the word of the living god amen glory hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord glory 1946 israel became a nation this is our history that i'm lining up israel became a nation they had their own flag their own president or prime minister their currency they become an established nation meanwhile israel was scattered for more than two thousand years but on the third day the third thousand years the law began to do manifestation begin to manifest his people in the natural 1956 the lord closed the seven church ages the churches were over william brown was preaching somewhere i think if it could be africa billy graham was preaching somewhere outside the united states or robert we were preaching somewhere and the lord anointed them to come back all the three ministers because the lord was using them mercy came on earth with two men william brown was a type of mechisadek and billy graham and aura robert were type of the two messengers who preached to sodom and gomorrah amen the lord also sent messengers to sodom because they need to hear the gospel anyways whether they will take it or not they need to hear it so that the lord will be justified when he bring judgment amen so all of them they said for some reason for some reason i don't know how but i felt it go back to the united states the council they are meeting and he said this day is the time that united states has to take christ or reject christ one or the other and it's they rejected christ as we know and ever since it's not been the same in fact there were some code said that america is not a democratic nation anymore democracy is over the the a lot of scriptures were full around that time kennedy sent a military and when he sent them he ended up sending 663 666 people which signifies 666. the first catholic president i mean at the white house a lot of scriptures was fulfilled but that was the world that wasn't our scriptures yeah 1963-62 the lord began to do something people begin to have some weird dreams but jack preached on it about two years ago and if you have if you want you can go back and read it i mean it couldn't be better about the dreams of brahms tabernacle some sisters and brothers ministers were having dreams it's about abram i had this strange dream and i saw this and this and their dreams were six and i think the prophet himself had a seventh dream amen and seven is the number of what completion william brahm's name is william abraham 777. there's no coincidence with the lord everything is just right the way the lord ordained it because the lord was about to come down and break the mysteries that were hidden in the bible all the messages from adam up to whenever the lord was about to breed the mysteries and give it to you the mysteries that was hidden from uh from daniel is now in plain view so that you not to fill your mind but to be in your heart that you'll be the fountain of living waters amen glory hallelujah to the lord so in 1963 as we know after the dream the lord began to vindicate and the lord himself came down to fulfill a scripture that was the scripture that we read he said i'll come in clouds and behold all eyes will see him the scientists took a picture they were not believers the lord didn't make with abraham to take the picture no they wouldn't have believed it but he made the unbelievers scientific world to vindicate the truth and they themselves took you to uh one of their best uh investigators of questions document uh what's the name let's see uh whatever george leslie thank you bro jack and so when he investigated and said look this is the only supernatural and so william ramoda as any other mortar man but his memory of that supernatural will outlive him amen your life that you are living the christian life that you live in yes a time will come if the lord terrorists will drop this flesh like any other mortar man by your memory of your life will outlive you amen the memory of your testimony well i'll leave you your faith and your passion will achieve with you your ministry will outlive you amen that's why the lord has put he let you go through sudden suffering to bring certain attribute out of your life glory hallelujah to the lord so 1963 revelation chapter 1 verse 7 was fulfilled the lord came down in the form of cloud cloud of what not just natural cloud but mysterious cloud what is cloud if you go back to the scriptures cloud of witness paul talk about cloud of witness how can cloud be a witness cloud is inanimate object it's just the wind and gases it's talking about few funnies celestial bodies but a solomon in his celestial body all of you were there amen it wasn't just for abraham it wasn't just the men that were there but a jack was there even so but i wasn't born it doesn't matter were you in christ before the foundation of the world you didn't have no flesh this flesh with you but you had a supernatural flesh how many were in the ribs of jesus christ when the pierce is ripped and blood and water we were not born two thousand years ago when we're not on this flesh your atoms were lying somewhere in the united states man was lying somewhere in ghana but the true you you were in christ and let me tell you something who you are amen the lord came in flesh he was 100 human being he was 100 percent omnipotent and he manifest both of them depending on when it was necessary there was a time he was faced with a cavalry and cavalry wasn't a fan it wasn't a picnic it was death and demonic spirit all the satan and all the demons of the world coming to face this a lanky 33 and a half year old man and he saw in him in in in in visions just about 12 hours before it took place you could see visions of people with anointed with demons coming to torment him and he was a hundred percent human being so he praised the lord father the people of fire in him he be your wall let his suffering cup mean suffering cup of bitterness let the suffering pass by me but he said not my word but i will because for this course i came to the world amen and the bible said that angels came to minister to him who are those angels theophanies you and i brother jack all of us say lord you need to go to calvary if you don't go to calvary all of us are lost lords please raise up and go to calvary we need you on calvary remember the scriptures revelation i think five where john envisions uh saw a book and the lord standing in the throne and there was no worthy no one worthy to read the book and he cried he knew that all human humankind were lost but then a lamp came out of the scene and picked the book and opened the seals now that lamp in the vision the lord jesus christ was on calvary and he needed to bring salvation to mankind redemption and he's the only one enoch wasn't worthy elijah was raptured wasn't worthy adam wasn't worthy you and i were not worthy but there was only one the lord jesus christ he has to come in a human flesh and he was worthy and in being in human self he was found in the time that he was weak he was he was crying and we came down from the celestial dimension to minister unto him to pick him up lord go and die for us and the lord went to die for you and i amen before you drop on earth you wear celestial being that's right you wear a physical like i see you now you were a human being not this flesh not just blood you had a more more powerful flesh your blood was it was the holy ghost and that is what we being redemption means to be restored to bring back who we who we are amen the celestial body that we operated in the new bed restores that celestial body to you and if it becomes necessary to go through the walls there's a power authority and everything in you to speak and go through the walls if it's necessary for us to pass through the uh the roof without even the roof nothing to disturb it we can do it right it happened before amen peter was in jail they were going to kill him and he felt like he was having a dream something like you know a dream and somebody told him rise up put on your clothes and let's go and it was like a dream when you sleep at daydreaming something like that and before he realized somebody was i mean leading him and they went through a door which is locked there was security strong men guarding him they passed by those men they didn't have a clue they didn't know the door didn't open but supernaturally he changed pictures from the celestial body from the flesh to the theophany and when he went over the flesh body came in peter's body and peter realized that this is not a dream i'm out of the jail wow what's going on here and he knew that they said they said angel of the lord he has a theophany the lord himself is with him and he went to do what he needed to do to be with the disciples the same authority the same business you don't have to die physically to pick you with you funny let me and just give an illustration lot lot wasn't a serpent seed lord was a seed of god but lord decide not to pick his still funny in other words he doesn't know to pick the holy ghost baptism abraham said that i and sarah we are going to stay with jehovah before he even make his deck he came as mercy lord said well i'm going to have some fun in sodom and gomorrah he is boring i want to go have some fun and so lord and his wife and his family moved to sodom and they went into sodomy and if you read the bible the bible said that lord was a righteous man and the sense of sodom affects his soul there's something in him that denounce those spirit denounce a man marrying to a man a woman having an affair with a woman it wasn't his makeup but at the same time that's where he found himself so his spirit was in constant rich but abraham the lord gave him a promise that abraham you and sarah will be a father and mother of nations and the promise the day was going by there was no sign physically and for 25 years once a while sarah will ask abram said honey are you sure i mean i know you the law speaks to you but are you really sure i mean look at who we are now we are just you know just about to die and we haven't seen this promise and abraham said have i ever had has the lord ever to this lie it's going to happen he said praise god i'm with you abraham and at the right time one day mercy sadek told two angels you know the lord changes his name based on what he want to manifest when he was in the angelic form fighting the antichrist he picked an attribute called michael michael is crazy says in the celestial body and he told the angels that hey we need to go down to earth and go and manifest the word of the lord my word so he picked two angels with him he picked billy graham and ura robert with him as a type and they went and the two of them went to sodom and gomorrah to preach to them but then mercy sadek stayed with who with abraham said we need to pass by abraham is my friend and see how many want to be a friend of jesus christ then you have to sacrifice to be his friend amen and he said abraham can i do anything without telling you how can god god doesn't have to tell a man what he wanted to do but he fell in love with abraham because abraham fell in love with him and you fall in love completely with jesus christ let everything else go its way and let the lord be the all in all in your life the lord will not do nothing without telling you amen it doesn't matter you are young you're a sister you're a brother if something is going to happen the lord will reveal it to you that's why he's put gifts in you amen gifts of tongues prophecy wisdom and what have you in your lives to manifest him so through those gifts he revealed himself to you amen and to the church of the living god glory hallelujah to the lord the lord is so wonderful amen so let's go ahead i want to bring a couple of quotes here praise praise be to god let's go to the second coming of the prophet preacher same one title of the second coming this was 55 february 20th and watch the watch the title of the same one and look at the dates and i'll show you something five five oh two twenty and uh paragraph 20 is that and then another thing okay let me jump and go for the sake of time is that i believe that all the blessings will be dumped out as it was before by the heavenly father upon the church in this last days and what a day we are living in then here you begin to prophesy and say oh i hope i can see he's coming i can see him coming i believe we are in it now for i just hope i live to see the day when i can see them coming from arizona across the wilderness and joining hands together for a meeting in the air what a day that will be this was 1955. he was prophesying about i hope i want to see him who is him christ jesus elohim and i said i want to see them who are them the sins the theophany you and i and all the body of christ from adam to the last person who is not born yet where others said i hope to see them coming and across the desert of arizona why did he say israel why did he say ohio why didn't he didn't he say africa but he said arizona arizona that's the way i say it arise and watch let's go to the next coat the lord is so wonderful this day this scripture is fulfilled the first quote was 1955 february 20th this is 1965 february the 19th this day this scripture is for just like exactly 10 years is that right now let's it's going to be lengthy but let me cut it down if anyone anyone's sick this time it's your healing if you want whatever sickness whatever demon whatever one whatever sickness your loved one is going through just listen to this quotation i need to send it to your loved one send it to your flesh two five one there is a man sitting right here back he's suffering he's got a tumor on the left on the left leg he isn't from here you've been a mind worker that is right i'm a total stranger to you if that's right shake your hand the tumor is in your left lung and you are up for an operation right away that's right you are not from here you are from out of town you are from virginia that's right you believe god knows who you are mr mitchell that's right go home and be well do you think a human being can just tell somebody who is watch out glory hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord he said jesus christ makes you whole ask the man never see him in my life he was sitting he was sitting never see him in my life jesus christ makes you whole okay never seen in my life sitting here praying this day this scripture is fulfilled now watch but abram turns his back to the congregation do you make it more complicated maybe if i know but solomon i can tell something about him but then if i turn my back i don't know what's going on all right and there's no people that he knows it's not like regular congregation this is people from meeting they organize the meeting from him sometimes they have to hide him and squeeze him to the meeting because somebody wants to just touch his flesh people want to and he's so loved and so kind he will preach i've saw a pastor in texas gave me a photo i should have made a copy of abraham after the meeting he was just a dead man sometimes if you if you read a message he said after they meet you don't know what it takes but this kind of ministry it's kind of he said the lord himself when the woman touched him it made him weak and he felt like virtue has come out of me how much more a sinner saved by greece he says sometimes my manager and my son billy paul packed me up and i saw a picture of brahmos like a dead man they were packing him and his head was behind him just like that person he was out of it he's gone the flesh strength is completely gone and sometimes he's between dimension he doesn't know who where he is whether he's on earth whether it's in the other dimension there was a time believers said they went to visible abraham they wanted to see him and when he went he was sitting in his chair and they said okay he's resting we're gonna wait till he wakes up and he was sitting there he just woke up so god bless you brother josue he wasn't sleeping he was in another dimension he realized that no he wasn't sleeping he was somewhere else so he just came back out god bless you brother you welcome you and your wife so he was operating through dimension for you amen he was the first fruit to open the piece he was a pacesetter to set the pace for you that whatever you might not have to go around it was seven times but in your home in your family in your church in your community people that love you and you laugh if there's a situation and you have to speak whether you're a sister you're a brother you are young you are adored you are the oldest you speak the word and the word that you speak is ye and amen glory amen let's keep going so he turned his back uh to the people he said here's a lady sitting right here behind me is sarah as sarah was in the tent she's praying for a daughter stand up the daughter is not here she's away the daughter and you are this you are the same as it was and you are the same as it was when a woman come to jesus now you change the scenario who had a woman that was variously vexed with a devil the woman a girl a girl is demon a girl is demon possessed she's not here you are from north carolina you believe that and that's the truth isn't it mrs orders you can go home if you believe with all your heart you find your daughter like found when jesus christ in the days gone by said it was healed so this 65. he mentioned mrs odyssey when he didn't know mrs oda she came from north carolina right and this same one i think was in i'm not sure whether it's the first envelope or somewhere and he mentioned his name who was that it was jesus christ hiding behind a badger skin and the same jesus christ is hiding behind your skin to do the same thing to do the same third pool the same spoken word when you need it amen now let's go a little bit 253 paragraph 253 the same quote this day this scripture is fulfilled the son of sodom do we see sodom here yes the son of super seed are you the super seed the son of the natural church do we see them around this day this scripture is fulfilled in your midst do you believe it congregation says amen will you accept him right now as your savior healer stand up on onto your feet every one of you say i accept my healing i accept him as my savior i accept him as my king each one stand up on your feet this day listen friends he read the scripture now he now begin to forfeit scriptures here he said he read a scripture handed a bible now he's quoting from jesus christ in the book of isaiah if he's 55 i don't remember quite well handed over the bible back to the priest and said all the eyes of the people were fasting on him and he looked down upon them and said this day this scripture is fulfilled i've read now he came to himself i've read the scripture with a dozen or more evidences that we are living in the last day the generation that will see jesus christ return to the earth and i say unto you tonight again this day this scripture is fulfilled in your sight you in tucson you in california you in new york you in west palm beach on the telephone on the internet who caps this day this scripture is fulfilled let us be glad to make mary for the marriage of the lamp has come and her bride is right has made herself ready amen so now but abram is talking about the generation that will see jesus christ return to earth and he said this this day this scripture is fulfilled how come remember when you go to the message 55 second coming he said i hope to see him come to see them coming in arizona in the world and shaking hands with them i hope i'll live to see that day the holy ghost in him was prophesying about sister excuse me 65. sometimes men and women of god do things without even thinking because your mind as we preach sometimes your mind is pro your normal mind can process let's say a certain rate but when you're under anointing it is processing maybe 200 times beyond your regular thinking and you see things in anointing that normally you wouldn't see amen because somebody took over your mind the same thing the holy ghost took over his mind his heart his body and speaking things that normally he wouldn't see he said the only thing is i'm the one that is close i'm not the one that performs those miracles but i'm the one that is close when he performed the miracles and the one that is near when he showed the supernatural to give it to you amen so now the lord said that that coming that coming is not for the world you know in our our denomination church were thought about taught about second coming of christ that is going to come i for me i remember when i was in in my in my church they said then because that they said jesus will come and when he comes there's going to be people blowing trumpets and if you see jesus you're going to be flying like michael jackson mcjustin's movie i forgot trailer flying and then with the lord so when i was a kid i was looking to the sky that one day the lord is going to come in the sky and i'm going to just meet him in there and go with him but abram said what similarity he said when i was young my mom taught me that when everybody dies they go to their class and they play drums and music they said if that so do you have it on us that was the methodist age it was good but we are in the opening of the seven seals we don't believe them doctrines that jesus christ is coming in the skies and then you see jesus and you begin to fly up somewhere no to begin with you're not going with this guy this guy is here that's where he belongs to amen he came from here but there's another guy the one that is speaking for from within he's the one he's celestia amen he can be here and can be in africa he can be here and be in another place because he is not limited to time but this flesh man is just limited to this time amen so the word is for you amen the word that wasn't for the world no that wasn't everybody know go to that drunkard on the street oh the lord is coming you tell you good people that go to pub and drink oh yes have you seen a drunkard preaching you will repent they can tell you jesus is coming oh yes i believe it and he's just drunk sick and wet with alcohol but they would preach to you the coming of jesus christ the second coming of christ but that was in the in the denominational era but we have got the opening of the seven seals we have got like brother jack and i smiley pray to us he said you can believe that jesus christ two thousand years ago but anyways i said jesus christ but a jack says oh no but jack i know him he's only 50 something years old how can he be jesus christ i know sister naomi she cannot be jesus christ i know sister cup she cannot be jesus christ because you limit jesus christ to 2000 years ago sistine element that's one of our biggest problems that's why they stone jesus christ let me go back to history a little bit when jesus was on earth he said i am that i am you i i said before abraham i am they said no no no we can't take this we have to kill this guy what doctrine is he preaching you are not even 50 years old anywhere before abraham you have a demon you have the devil not just the demon but you are the chief of the devil you are how can you be i mean see abraham he said before abraham was i am and abraham wanted to see my day how because they're looking at jehovah that came in a pillar of fire and when it comes there's thunders and quickening and so forth by the same jehovah who did the thundering and the awakening he said i'm no longer my children cannot they told muslim moses you were built and born to to take this go speak to him whatever he tells you come tell us right we cannot this is too much for for us and our children will be good to see their building shaking fenders no no no moses please just go and take a break take your feet and just come and pray to us so moses but the lord wanted to not only to be with moses he doesn't want to stay dressing by the jack nothing brother smiley alone nothing but a salomon nothing but a troy nothing sister uh luis you want to stay in each and every one of you the young people the old every one of us you were in the mind of christ and you were christ amen so they said jesus no they wanted to kill him because they were living in history they believed java of history but when java put on flesh i said i don't know how much he weighed he was always fasting and he didn't have much with maybe 150 pounds and he was working in jerusalem we didn't feel that i am that i am they said how can you be we know your mother what does mary your dad is i mean uh joseph you were even born in in a covered up kind of a whatever you know you were born in some mysterious i mean we know the story you are ill illegiti you are illegit illegitimate and you claim to be before abraham was and they were sincerely but it was sincerely wrong but now when jesus christ died and resurrected the same spirit that were in the pharisees jump upon people at that time at this time now now if you tell them that jesus christ is in this sister jesus christ is in you maybe you can have his anointing but you are not jesus christ but the same jesus christ 2000 years ago he died and resurrected and we say he's risen the end the tomb is empty so where is he now you can't tell me that he's risen that's why sometimes muslims don't believe christians because they tell the muslims that yes there's an empty tomb in jerusalem but wait see they wanted to see allah you call him jehovah or jesus that god almighty they want to see him in action so if he's raising where is he so if you can't display him in your flesh and in my flesh then we have to stop we don't have a story to tell but if he's in your flesh and in my flesh then we have to have all the boldness like peter and his brothers and sisters in the day of upper room when they were filled and drunk with the holy ghost they didn't have no limitation they prayed the gospel with boldness and the dust opened to them amen there were no hindrances because the word that was coming from them it wasn't peter the coward it was coming from jesus christ himself because he just changed his garment he wanted to be have no longer one man ministry you want to be in many members ministry a man he want to be in all the body of christ so he moved away from willie abraham and he moved into a mini-member ministry william brown preaches salmon it is the rising of the sun how can yes okay let's read the quotes quickly blessed be the lord the rise of the son paragraph 40 the first time the sun rose in genesis it was bringing a message that there will be life upon the earth mortal life that's the natural sun all the light that we see here came from the sun the first physical thing the lord created was the sun the moon the stars and all the earth planetary bodies came from the natural sun which is the type of the sun of god but this time when the sun rose there was a dual sun rising the natura which is typing the supernatural s-o-n rising it was not only sun rising s-u-n rising it was s-o-n sun had risen to bring eternal life to all gas promises that that by followage had been had been had been seen laying upon the earth before you were born your your assistant element were upon the earth the law saw the assistant element and it brought the quickening power through the natural breath and he brought a new breath so now there's another sunrise which is the son of the living god where did he rise from within you i think it's luke chapter 17 21 or 21 17. people wanted to see the kingdom of god and they went to jesus where is the kingdom of god some say go to the north the south the east go to this tabernacle said but the kingdom of god is within you it cometh not with observation you might not cut by the brother salomon you're not going to see any pillow fire in him get the best doctors to cover the jar cut me you're never going to see any physical pill of fire you're going to see lungs and a biological element you're going to see botany biology but there's the supernatural element that the doctor the best doctor in the united states cannot detect you'll be standing there amen when your loved one is dead and you are crying he's standing right there by by his flesh body it's a supernatural being if he's born again if he's got christ in him you cannot die you can lay down the garment flesh but you on the inside is not possible for you to die because eternity cannot die that's why jesus died in his flesh by the jesus the supernatural person he's been here all the time glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be the name of the lord glory can we go further a little bit let's read invisible union paragraph two two three it's talking about the certificate the lord has given to you when you receive the new birth when you are married to christ invisible union two two three now you your old book is gone with your old union your name is in your old book has been transferred do you mean to tell me that my old book which is the old nature god put it in the sea office forgetfulness it doesn't judge you do you mean um you stand perfectly before god now your na your name is now in the new new book not the book of life but the lamb's book of life not the ammo yeah the breath that you take but there's another book in you the holy ghost that's the lamb book of life what the lamb redeem not the old book of your natural union but your new bride hallelujah your new life is in the lamb's book of life your marriage certificate hallelujah where your true eternal gem from the beginning takes hold you are not only forgiven but you are justified glory justified so now when do a man when does a man give or they call give a man or your wife when do you give you a woman a marriage certificate is it when you get engaged to the woman but when you get what married do you have the holy ghost the holy ghost is your wedding certificate just ask a natural man they put their wedding ring on their hand to show that this one is married the lord jesus christ before there was a type the lord put a wedding ring not on your fingers but in your whole body your whole body is what is the wedding certificate and when you come on on the up here there's a scene a theophany a dimension the pillow fire the holy ghost come through the building when you say amen the word and their wife say amen they are one is the lord jesus christ saying amen to his own word amen he's preaching and he's listening and he's the only one that can do that amen there's nobody who can do but the lord himself is the one that listened the one that preaches his own word amen glory hallelujah to the lord the lord is that we have a scripture that said in the training of an uh twinkling of an eye i think first corinthians i'm not going to read is that in a training of an eye we shall be changed now we look at the twinkling of an eye as i add twinkle yes the lord can do that but you know who the eye of the lord is a prophet so when a prophet appears the eyes of the lord are twinkling he has a message for you he has a ministry to change you and you are being changed how do you change by the holy ghost baptism it's a supernatural dimension phenomenon the next person will not see what's going on but as the preacher's eye is twinkling which is the eye of the lord the word is being preached to you from a jag but a troy but a smiley by the jerry and all the ministry the eyes of the lord is trinkling on you to give you eternal life to give you change your nature you'll be sitting on pure and you'll be born again that's why jesus told uh connie is i forgot his name is that you should be born again and say how can i be born again i'm nicodemus thank you brother jack how can i be born again when i'm 50 years old plus i'm not talking about you going in your mother no i'm talking about you must die the old person dies the consuming fire consume the old person and christ is born on the inside of you and the word become activated and the work takes you over and when you are working is omnipotent god walking on two feet when you speak it's crazy speaking when you talk is the lord talking when you listen is the lord listening when you say amen is jesus christ aiming in his own word glory hallelujah to the lord and all their powers in glory all the powers in the dimension is in you you know the signs say that human beings reduce our potential we use only up to about 10 percent those who really maximize their potentials christians probably use only about two percent because we limit ourselves i don't have money i can't do this this one but the jack is the one who has to do it i can't i can't do this no so you are limited and you use only two percent if you can even go up to 15 30 50 100 your rapture is in you you don't worry about rapture coming from somewhere you are the rapture nothing can happen without you amen just like the lord couldn't do nothing without consulting abraham abraham was it was christ on earth and so when the almighty came nobody can come here and preach regardless of your message whatever the jack you can have the best message you can't just come and say the lord has sent me to preach push brother jack aside no no the dickens will come for you regardless of how strong you are they'll bundle you up and trash you somewhere amen because there's a representative of god on earth here and you can't bypass him to do anything here you can be the mega church you can be whoever you can even be the police this is the post of duty the police cannot come here no they don't have the authority the lord put the same thing put you in authority in your home in your family no demon can bypass you you've got the eyes of the lord and you can see things that the ordinary cannot see and the lord is dependent on you and i to go into action and to bring his word into manifestation but we are pushing it back tomorrow in the future one day when i die i'm gonna have a glorified body your eternity doesn't be glorified you are a tenor is a tenor that glorifies the flesh the eternal person you when it comes into your flesh let me take you to an attractive mount sinai now santa wasn't anything any any i mean holy mountain or just a regular mountain animals and tigers and this run around but when the lord chose mount sinai to be his mountain where his prophet met him everything changed mount sinai became a holy mountain where even an animal you step your foot on mount sinai you're gonna die it's only moses and those that the lord has consecrated who can go to mount sinai and if the lord has chosen you regardless of who you were you are becoming a holy mountain and nothing can touch you the lord used mounsana for some however many years is on the holy mountain rats and animals and lizards are all over mount sinai because the lord doesn't use man sana no more people tourists can go and visit but in the time of moses call yourself a tourist and go to mount sinai that i want to visit mount sinai i'm a tourist from the united states i want to see how mansana is like okay you're going to be a dead body you can't do that because that mountain is the lost mountain not everybody can touch the mount sinai and you are the man you are greater than man sana is here nobody can touch you no no demon no death amen no coronavirus can't touch you because he that is in you is greater than he does in the world until the lord himself when the lord decided that okay moses i'm down with mount sinai now taurus can go to mount sinai if the lord decides to this flesh to decay it now the devil can take over and do whatever you want to do with it but as long as the lord is living in it he'll heal it he wash it you when when the flesh gets discouraged the one is crying you wipe your tears he said i'll be with you even in you on to the end of this world but as long as he's living in you if you are going to live thousand years you don't have to worry a brother had cancer and he was hospitalized state for cancer and the doctor said of course you know said four it means you are going you are gone almost gone and in the hospital the angel of the lord visited him said you are not you are not it's not your time and so i didn't care about what the doctor said when the lord visited you visit you you listen to the the lord he's greater than the doctors it doesn't matter what stage of cancer it doesn't matter the variant of chronovirus yes you could be infected a lot can allow it you can get sick even jesus had headaches but the lord living in you i'll be with you even in you on to the end of the world glory hallelujah give me a couple minutes i'm closing and i have a piece of advice for i want to speak something real-time situation amen for a young people a man because we are living in a real time where coronavirus has changed the whole world how even business corporate world do their business [Music] corporate will find out that people can be more productive when they work at home so some companies they are not returning to the offices they rent offices pay for utilities pay for electricity uh rent uh water and what a view but then if you work from your home they don't pay for electricity they don't make coffee for you you make your own coffee and you have it more productive and you put more pocket in there in the pocket of the corporate world they make more millions and billions and trillions from you so hey work from your home just just keep it keep working from home it's good it's okay once a while we can have like company meeting if you need to or if you need to do some training we can train you so corporate world has adapted with a chronovirus now in the world people say oh brother jack used to have a lot of meetings for young people you know we used to go to other places but now with chronovirus it's been more than a year there's no meeting here how am i going to meet my husband and my wife i mean i want to have my husband and children before the rapture i don't know what's going on i don't know but jack is not announcing any young people's meeting where are we going to where's the chronovirus taking us to you know but the lord is not limited to chronic virus i'm going to give you a testimony and uh and uh to you for you to be encouraged that the lord is in charge of every situation and it's not limited to the dictations of chronovirus amen it's not limited to even to meetings young people's meeting the lord has obtained your husband and your wife for you before the foundation of the world and wherever he or she is you get him amen there was a brother somewhere the story is in two parts let me speak one part and this brother was he's finished college and he had a scholarship to go and study in a certain country in europe so the brother at the same time he went to he had some friends who were believers and so he went to visit their friends and they were talking and they said well how about they in the conversation their younger sisters or their friends came in and it's all my our sister is no longer a younger sister she's a big sister so this is a number if you want to say hi to her you can do that so the brother pick his number and he called and stones begin to his tones iraq began to hit racks and he changed her love story so to make the long story short that brother said you know what i have scholarship going to this country and this is in this country in europe so what do you do and your friend said that look take the scholarship trash it go marry your wife that's what you need you don't need a scholarship so the brother went and got married to his wife after some time their brother another brother they better visit and in the visit that says that's give a testimony to their brother i said look brother i was 20 28 years old and i was struggling this is a real time human human human being experienced so i was struggling i couldn't take it normal i told the law that lord if you don't give me my husband i'm going to get my husband from the pentecostal so i can't take it no more and the same time she was thinking about this the lord ordained someone he has already ordained but the lord made a way for the right person she was in europe the person was in africa and the lord somehow threw the sisters brothers connected to them because their brother the sister has gone through all the camp meetings this is the people in the church where all the people that were already married and those that she's all far older than them so there was there seemed to be there was no hope for her and she's a human being she's got a hemoglobin and blood in her and so she was going through issues say lord i can't take it no more the loneliness is too much i need help else i go find me a husband from the pentecostal from the other church but that's not what the lord has done has ordained for you the lord has ordained for you the one that will be an angel of the lord to you as you are an angel of the lord to him the one that will understand you the one that will cover your mistakes another one that would throw you away at a slighted mystic there was a man that invited his friends to come and dine and when the the wife prepared food and it was as if they were for a jaguar a jug a jar of salt in the food it was so salty beyond saltiness so when the man tasted the food he has to come up with something to you know cover the wife he said look i'm so sorry friends i'm so sorry i didn't tell you my tastebuds are gone so i let my wife pour in so much salt and i forgot that you guys were coming i i should have told you actually i told her to to minimize the salt but i forgot so it's all my fault and the man covered his wife their friends didn't know that the woman didn't know how to cook he covered his wife and after they took it over you know and a true man of god and one that truly loves you will cover you up the one that loves your flesh and not you your holy ghost will just take your flesh and drop you when he doesn't need you and his vice versa a woman that wants your money you are loaded you are enterprising you are industrious you want your money you know gold digger when you give the gold and there's no more gold you leave the land and go and look for another land to dig more gold but but if the lord give it to you if the lord gives it to you you are covered there's not the lord doesn't take back when they give it to you it's christ and christ together is christ himself and the lord will give you somebody who holds you up let me use william brown for example some of you the lord has made you your spiritual entity not every man can handle you some of you brothers your spiritual entities not everyone can handle you even among the sons of god if they line up about let's say a thousand sons of god who are followed the holy ghost maybe none of them will appeal to you or maybe the only one will put to you and he's the one the lord you were with before the foundation of the world glory hallelujah to the lord if you take anything else beside that it's not gonna work you're in trouble if you look upon you look over your husband's shoulder to see another man then he wasn't the right man for you if you look on top of your wife's shoulder to see another woman she wasn't your wife to begin with the one that is for you ordained for you before the financial world if the alliance 10 billion rich men you meander through them and go and pick this poor brother because your heart and his heart is connected there's no even reason to wait how do you love this guy i don't even know how do you love this man i don't know how do you love this lady there's something in you deep calling for the deep and that's how the lord bless people so circumstances doesn't limit the lord let me use brother brown for example brother jack was talking about our mother's happy mother's day last week but abram's wife of course we know he had a first wife he loved him but the mother the wife's mother was a problem so the lord has to take sister hope away and it also means prophetess in indian native indian language so the lord ordains the hope um sister mida for but abraham somebody that wasn't c visions like abram was seen visions she wasn't supernatural lady who sees visions their hazmat abraham used to see vision but the lord used sister media to balance but abraham in his way abram had never breakdown he was he was a very spiritual person and sometimes people are very sensitive and they are navals so when he on arizona when the lord told him to consecrate himself and he was ready to reveal the mystery of the servant seal he went to arizona there was a blast you know the blast where he thought it was the end of his life it was beyond what a human being can comprehend and i'll show you an example of how the supernatural blends with that natural so when he came back home he thought that was the end of him so he told his wife go get with i think it's my end so go and stay with billy paul and make sure that you don't go through high school and so forth and mira said billy the deloted told you is going to take your life he said how can i stand how can a person stand this this thing he i think is the end of sun or the lord he didn't tell he's going to take your life and the lord used his wife to bring him the balance it's not a mystery he didn't preach mystery to him but he needed to let you know that the lord didn't take he's going to take your life calm down boy and be at peace get from the supernatural and be a human being and the lord brought him down to earth you know that's if the lord chose for you he'll bless you but if you go and get something that you can't carry it's going to be a headache the lord used uh uh sister media in summit bram used to say that mida is only 35 and she's gone completely white gray hair when i think was in rebecca one of their daughters were born but brown went around the world six months when it came back i think it wasn't even there when the daughter was born or he was born when she was there he went to preaching how many women can do that you go preaching around the world and as you stay six months when you come you go to the court and go and get your divorce papers or you get the divorce in the mail she's not even there she's gone but the lord gave him someone who is ordained and consecrated for his ministry there was a time stamina even he didn't see the pillar of fire she had the holy ghost but she didn't explain the pillow fire until brother jack most church but jack mo put but stamina was very timid so she kind of laid back and jack mo put them on on on the spot said i want brown family to come in i think sing or something like that so they came to the platform and he saw the pillow of fire well around but abraham and that was her first time i mean ordinary people have been seeing a pill of fire all the time in the meetings on abraham on the sick people in the congregation but his own wife never saw the pillar of fire with her own eyes but this time on the property saw abraham was talking going around he was seeing the pill of fire following him leading him and so he came i said billy i saw it for myself this is the first time i saw the pill of fire around you but at the home she was the one who takes charge of abraham we were ordinary people sick people who come from some of them were not even will i say they are not a great christians but they were seeing the pillar of fire but the lord ordained system either for her to be the right person for it i don't have time i would have take gone through some use uh moses and uh and if there's time for some scriptures i lay down maybe give me if you can land me some few few minutes can i get some few minutes i'm not going to keep you alone maybe you stay till uh it's now 12 51 probably you can stay till 8 pm quick we've got young ones you should have told us to bring mattresses if you are going to stay till 8 p.m i'm just kidding i'm just kidding i want to i want to give a word of advice and encouragement that the lord is in control but reject was it last week he said uh paul and his people were not even his people it wasn't a journey there was there was a shipwreck but paul told them to be on the stay on the ship don't panic you're gonna be fine stay in the church stay in the world right don't say it because of kona virus i have not seen anything i'm going to go on my way i've been saying but jack is organizing youth meetings so i'm going to go and go and do my own thing you're going to get something load you can't carry and your neck is going to break but you stay in the shape if you have a problem if you like the sister get to a place you can't control you can't take it no more go talk to your pastor the lord put him there for you he'll give you counsel and advise us what to do you pray for you he prayed with you through to their promises become become a manifestation but if you go take something you cannot carry i'm going to get me something sometimes the lord will let you go get but can you carry that load it's going to be a misery pain and crying but if you wait humbly upon the lord patiently the lord will give you what he has with them for you let's read a let me see let's read genesis 41 41-46 praise be to the lord genesis 41 41-46 and pharaoh said unto joseph see i have set thee all over the land of egypt and pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon joseph's hand and i read him in a virtue of finally leaning and put a gold chain about his neck and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had and they cried before him bowed the knee and he made him ruler over all the land of egypt and pharaoh said unto joseph i am pharaoh and without thee no man left up his hand or foot in all the land of egypt 45 and pharaoh called his name zafnap penang and he gave him a wife asanath the daughter of potiphar priest of on and joseph went out over all the land of the land of egypt and joseph was 30 years old when he stood before pharaoh king of egypt and joseph went out from the presence of pharaoh and went throughout all the land of egypt now look at joseph you know the story of joseph he was the son of what uh jacob and he was a beloved son because the lord gave him a a little gift and his brothers thought to you know they were jealous and they wanted to destroy him but look at the plan of god when you stay in the perfect will of the lord the lord he went through battles upon battles the christian general is not uh roses all the time yes sometimes we have roses and butter and bread and uh picnics but sometimes a lot allows hard trials to train you to mold you and that's where a lot of us make our mistakes because of the trials i'm living i'm gone i'm no longer coming to church i'm out of this church i've been here for years what i've been praying for the lord hasn't given to me the lord don't be like soul so almost go to the promise but impatient led him to dispossess himself of the promise wait patiently on the lord so let me just finish so pharaoh was giving a wife his wife means he's a daughter of the pyramid doesn't mean of asana she was a spiritual man she was a you know old old testament they called them men prophet the women had the same the women also had the same spirit of the lord in them jehovah in them and the lord who didn't before foundation of the word ordained asked not to help balance the ministry of joseph abraham had her his wife right from his half-sister from babylon where the lord called him from now his sons isaac had a rebecca look at the story of rebecca rebecca didn't know isaac there was no instagram to chat to see the picture of isaac there's no facebook to be friend with isaac to see how isaac is friends and people that has economy what he says he put on facebook no but she went by revelation of jesus christ or jehovah it does not they call him jehovah he didn't know nothing about isaac but there was something in her she was a prayerful woman she had a spirit of christ in her and so when eliezer came and proposed to him that i want to give my sons and my master's son is looking for a wife they told his parents her parents and they agree the parent didn't try to even hold her she said no i'm going because she had a revelation and watched as they were going to stand they had they didn't have a cameras and loosens they were just riding on horses and and chariots and they saw probably saw a lot of men young men along the way but nothing no none of them attracted when he saw he met isaac he said who is he who is this man they say deep in her the lord in her telling her this man is the one i'm giving to you he said who is this one he said he's my master son he's the one who's gonna get married and the lord has got appointed designated son or daughter for you and he's the only one that your life will be a balance amen if you go for something else it's going to be a catastrophe amen and so look at even eyes joseph regardless of his condition you know where he was trying to move from country to country trash upon trials joseph could have counted himself out but he knew that jehovah has him in control and if you stay in the boat if you stay with the ministry if you stay with your pastor everything's going to be all right for you you don't have to struggle you don't have to go looking for somebody the lord has ordained it for you amen blessed be the name of the lord let's read the last scripture uh exodus chapter two now moses his story is similar to uh to joseph let's read ezra chapter 2 verse 16 to 20 22. someone read for me oh it's right here thank you but someone can read for me now the priest of midian had seven daughters and they came and drew water and filled the troughs to water their father's flock and the shepherds came and drove them away but moses stood up and helped them and watered their flock when they came to ruel their father he said how is it that year comes so soon today and they said an egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds and also drew water enough for us and watered the flock and he said unto his daughters and where is he why is it that you have left the man call him that he may eat bread and moses was content to dwell with the man and he gave moses zipporah his daughter and she bare him a son and he called his name gershom for he said i have been a stranger in a strange land amen now look at moses your story is there where is the moses is corona where is that the cancer travel and fly moses was stranded he was actually a what is his condition he killed somebody in egypt so he couldn't go back to egypt to his people so he was stranded in median but the lord has ordained even in your mistake in your wrongs the lord eternity how do i even explain it let's take like an end right put an ant in the palm of your hands count 20 seconds and then another auntie said oh glory i'm now i'm now free i've left the hands of the man i'm free i'm gone he doesn't do that he's just in the palm of your hands you are in the palms of god's hands regardless of your trials your brokenness whatever you're going through you are in the palm of his love and this love converts you amen the lord already before moses made mistake kill somebody and went to a medium the lord has already obtained a wife for him he didn't even know so moses was just a young man just like any other young man and this sisters they didn't have a the lord put you know marriage sometimes the lord use it use marriage to bring redemption not only to their wife or to the husband but to their family to community to people it looks like uh what's the name of the past um the man rahu or whatever moses father-in-law didn't have a sons he has seven daughters and those times the occupation is agriculture and farming and uh livestock take care of your father's goats and sheep and what have you and so these people take these girls take their that is a sheep and goats and cow and whatever to go and clean them and wash them and i mean get grass for them and they were they were sons of uh ishmael you know the sons of ishmael and sons of isaac they are each of these fruits if you read the news in israel and hamas they are hanging on each other's throats they didn't start today it was way back over there so sons of ishmael would come and grab the good from the girls they were girls you know they were ladies they couldn't fight this man so moses saw it and no he just stood up for them washed their ship and so forth he didn't even say nothing the lord will work on your behalf when you find favor with the lord don't rush just wait on him and watch the holy ghost working for you some people rush and destroy things i had ahead of them blessing mostly didn't say nothing she was just kind to them help them was in his way and they went to tell their father how come you guys you i mean you you've come back so early say well we saw an egyptian who watered our sheep and did whatever why didn't you bring him to eat bread bring him next time they brought moses home and moses the lord has put upon a man's heart to give him a one of his daughters for a wife zipporah means a comma the lord was beginning to minister the law is a comma it's not the end grace was coming in jesus and paul was coming in so even the wife and the husband the lord gives you types who your ministry taps your predestination taps who you are no matter the battles of life amen and the lord blessed moses through his wife the wife was sometimes a redeemer in moses way moses was always on the supernatural side and he forgot to even circumcise his own children sometimes you don't know what ministers go through you don't know what pastors go through they'll pray the word to you but their children suffer they're battles that they go through because they're always thinking about the church and sometimes they even know that they forget about us on that they don't take care of their own family like they take of the church so sometimes you see a pastor's children going with what don't blame them oh he said pastor look at his children his blessing is coming upon you and the battles is coming to him you know the battle you should oppose to your children he feels the battles and the devil gets annoyed with him and the bad day raids come upon him because he's standing here to preach you know what happens when the pastor is preaching when medicines are preaching life is being changed are receiving the holy ghost demons are being cast away healing is taking place the devil is being dispossessed of his inheritance maybe the devil possessed me bless the devil is using me to rob people in miami west palm beach and that's what what is he want to do and now but preaches to me and i stopped i stopped becoming an armed robber the devil is not happy so what is he going to do is going to attack him so that's what preachers go through so you pray for your pastor support your pastor love your pastor don't condemn him amen don't don't look down because oh look at look at the ministers sometimes you might see me says children they might be even way off because of where they are standing and you can go to the bible you can look at abraham so you pray for your ministers because sometimes what they go to they don't tell you amen is their calling and allah equip them to face those battles so they stand on your behalf and intercede on your behalf they'll raise their hands and bless you so you raise their raise your hands in prayers amen glory hallelujah and the lord has [Applause] all the blessings in heaven is for you every blessing don't go out of the camp stay in the camp and it shall be well with you the lord knows where your husband is you might not know he knows where your wife is don't forsake the lord let me i'm i'm closing look at life as a pyramid a hierarchy right the first thing is eternal life the lord jesus that's the most important in life if we have to forsake whatever to get eternal life for sick and get eternal life forsake and grab to their word of the hour now the next is family a spouse husband and wife children and what have you grandchildren the lord made it that way for you the third is job occupation skills and whatever and the third one supports the family and the first one and the ministry of jesus christ don't put don't don't disorganize distort their balance christ first family second and job and every other thing occupation and trade and what have you businesses come fed if you keep it in that pyramid order in that hierarchy you cannot count your blessing amen and that's my last my last and the last powerpoint patient if you can if you can highlight it thank you patience and faith in christ are great virtues and they unfold everlasting blessings and rewards from the hands of the of elohim to the believer if you are faithful in the lord and you are patient and wait upon him he'll bless he has the blessing for you hannah has to go through certain trials rachel has to go to certain trials but the lord gave them great blessing isaac brother jack brother solomon brother josue all everyone brother smiley all the sons and daughters of god the lord allowed them to go to trials but your blessing you can't

pray amen god bless you brothers and sisters [Applause] you may take your seat please god bless you praise the lord how many appreciate brother quaku uh on today i um there's a number of things that that that were spoken today that i just felt was um very very important one of the things was this the first quote that he read uh i actually forgot to announce this little earlier but um can we just go back to that quote it was out of um uh the second coming the message the second coming just just go back to that for me really quick um but i just appreciate just how the lord just kind of deals with brother kwaku just very very special gift you know uh that that god has given us here he said um then another thing i believe that when satan which was prophesied would go about like a wrong line in the last days of strong mortal life and spiritual life and everything that he could i believe then if he if all the dumpings of all this evil is being dumped out in the human race in this day i believe that all the blessings will be dumped out all the evil dumbed out all the blessings gonna be dumped out and and i don't know if i don't know about you but i'm on the expectation for blessing upon blessing if i'm blessing up on blessing because that's that's what god has promised me he says by the heavenly father upon the church in this last day says and what a day we're living says i hope i can see them coming i believe we're in it now i just hope i live to see today when i can see them coming from arizona across the wilderness and joining hands together for a meeting in the air what a day that will be and um you know as he was just going he's making a point about um uh brother branham had an another quote where uh he was pretty much saying we're in the coming of the lord right now you know we're not looking for it we're living in it right now not somebody coming out the sky with some horn blowing if you're not hearing the trumpet sound right now the jubilee trumpet come on somebody it's a jubilee trumpet that sound that you won't have to be bound anymore in denomination hallelujah you can be free because christ has made you free but you know he was just making points along those lines and i see but there was a it meant just a little something else to me because on um i believe it was friday friday i had a a a brother sent me a text say brother i just been thinking about y'all i've been thinking i said well you know what i i i not that i hadn't been thinking about you but i'm gonna just be honest we so busy it we just well i i'm beyond i i'm so busy i'm a watch and i know some of y'all so busy y'all all out i can tell it i can tell it in the service i can tell you whoa out and sometimes sometimes you're busy doing nothing it's a truth in it hi right never got too busy on on instagram and got you busy on facebook you just woke up before you get to the house of god but you know we're living in a day where where these things are so but um but the brother sent me a text and said brother i was just thinking about y'all i said you know brother you know what me you've been talking for a long time and i and i i asked you know we should do something so i say tell me uh what your schedule is in in in august and i say around mid-august what your schedule is he said this right here is open it's okay let's lock something and i'm putting on my schedule i want you to come and preach for us and uh brother caleb duran from arizona right brother caleb duran from arizona uh and he as i said so when he put the quote up there from arizona i say that's my confirmation that brother caleb was supposed to come so i say brother get everything ready we go we're going to welcome you in you know in in in in august so uh you know sometimes you just come you know how god gonna speak and how god is gonna give you a little a little something and i pray that some of the young people got a little encouragement uh god will send you somebody from ten buck two and that is a real place i heard you know but but god will send you somebody you just wait on the lord somebody's gonna love god and somebody's gonna love you hallelujah if they don't love god they can't love you i'm gonna just tell you that right now but but i'll tell you that that just encouraged my heart and and i just appreciate uh appreciate the lord god bless you uh brother kwaku and that that twinkling of an eye who is the who is god's eye a prophet is his eye so when you see a prophet come on the scene you better watch something hallelujah the coming of the lord is upon you right then brother that was good i wrote that one down i like that i like that so god bless you brother thank you thank you so much for sharing amen your heart with us on today amen i won't i won't hold you uh any longer um i know some of y'all really really need to rest and i hope you'll get it praise the lord but uh but the lord knows all things right the lord knows all things um i i was um um thinking here and and and uh uh while sister dixon was just kind of there i was she was mentioning something to me yesterday you know things happen in our lives that um others would have no idea uh it may not mean anything to them but it means it means so much to us and she you know when she's feeling up to it we'll have her just kind of give the testimony but just a little portion she told me she said she was listening to the doctor she was coming out of her uh procedure and doctor said um that uh on the seventh time we were able to get something that they were trying to do and they could not get it done until like the seventh time it was successful in the seventh time and she said she said seven times so for her it brought encouragement it brought um it brought comfort because uh even though the doctor's thinking like oh lord we we couldn't get this thing right we couldn't get it but on the seven times so he's like no that's exactly what i need to hear god was in it if you got seven mean completion to us right so so even even coming from underneath anesthesia and everything she heard seven times like that's that's it god was with me through this whole process so you know sometimes different things will happen and and we just thank god for it all uh he's still worthy to be praised in the midst of it all so we give him glory let's have a word of prayer amen and uh we'll we'll prepare to dismiss you on the day god we thank you um thank you for your your word that has been brought to our hearts lord and and this brother quake who just kind of taken us through a journey there and lord we could see the different junctions in life uh lord from marriage and uh young people lord waiting for you to provide a a spouse and not to get ahead of you lord to see how you operate in the lives of other how god you send certain people in our lives to help balance us and to keep us lord uh in in in check uh you do that you have purpose for for all of that lord to to help us to see how close we are to the coming of the lord that your promises in your word that it would be in the moment in the twinkling of an eye god that we would be changed and uh lord if we just look at that a little from a different angle here this morning that twinkling eyes and a prophet is is the eyes of god that you use you use a prophetic ministry as as your eyes so lord when we see a prophet come on the scene one that's promised according to scripture malachi 4 speaks of him revelation 10 speaks of him saint luke 17 matthew 17 there's various scriptures that speak of the coming of of that prophetic ministry in the last days so god as we keep our eyes on that and watch it fulfill and unfold then we know father we are in the coming of the lord i pray father that uh that you would just strengthen the people touch each and every one uh just just think of lord just the the the children of israel as they were leaving egypt they were preparing to leave egypt it seemed like the taskmasters put them under the load and they were just probably so wore out from the things that they were going through but yet god it was during that time that they were preparing for a great exodus and lord i i noticed that not not just the people but even myself just thinking about it on yesterday lord just seemed like just so busy doing this and busy doing that and and so wore out that when you come to the house of god you're tired so so hard to enter in because your body's so tired but god even in the midst of that as it was shown to us lord uh even in the midst of a mistake it may look like a mistake you got something great happening and father even right now we know that a change of the body is taking place we know that what we've heard here today what we have received in our spirits god is doing something on the inside that satan cannot stop father we're grateful for that and we just pray that you just continue to strengthen the believers god give us travel and mercies as we prepare to leave this place but not your presence strengthen your your servant god uh brother kwaku lord and just thank you for him getting himself out of the way pressing through and bringing the word of god uh to us we appreciate it father today bless them abundantly ask that you would keep us all until we're able to meet back here together again on wednesday night and lord may you meet us in a special way god is our prayer it's in jesus name we ask it a man a man amen i did want to also mention um a few weeks ago we had a little celebration for brother um capers and i had a chance just to kind of look at the uh the hotel there was a big group that was meeting at the hotel and uh i noticed that they were having some type of little convention i said well you know this this this right here might work out and i start you know just questioning and get some get some questions and i found out you know that uh of the cost of it and um and so there have been some discussions that because i think they can seat about 700 people at this hotel and um so there's been some discussions that maybe we will try to do something here in the future with a meeting and uh may uh just a couple churches here in the area may go together to try to split the expenses so it's not all in one church and we have a big meeting together uh and and i was you know one of the brothers was asked me yesterday brother with the with the conditions the way they is would it be wise for everybody to have a meeting would it be wise i said i'm gonna have to answer that from two ways i say spiritually i think it would be the best thing that ever happened to the people because the expectations are much higher when we haven't been able to come together like that so yeah spiritually i i've watched other people that have meetings this time and that powerful things are happening powerful things and so you know i feel like it's in atmospheres like that where the holy ghost people are filled with the holy ghost and delivered and set free not saying that they can get delivered and set free outside but the meeting brings a certain atmosphere right it's a different atmosphere and i say you know but i understand you know with with with what we've been dealing with all honesty i don't think covet gonna go away it's here it's here to stay and not only that i say you know brother branham told us that they're going to be using germ warfare it's going to be more coming right and uh and and i might the question that the lord just put in my heart amen early this morning if jesus christ himself was passion through your city and say he was having a meeting would you let kovat stop you from going to to see jesus right because you got you got a confidence that if you're in the presence of jesus he can change it right uh if brother branham was coming to your city and say i was preaching i'm going to preach at such and such place would you allow kobe to stop you from going to that meeting you would have a confidence that god hear this man prayer and he'll be able to whatever he pray i just believe that situation like he don't even know me he called my name i know this thing is over with right well you coming to the meeting if jesus was here if brother branham was here you're coming to the meeting with one thing faith and the same faith that you would use if jesus was here and the same faith you use if brother brown use that same faith now and you'll see god make a difference in your situation it's the same faith it's not a different faith so all we got to do is just approach it with faith not fear church amen i mean and don't don't get me wrong don't get me wrong i i i take it i take it seriously but death is something that will has come to us because of what happened in the garden of eden covet came because of what happened in the garden of eden car accidents happened because of what happened in the garden of eden cancer is here because of what happened in the garden of eden high blood pressure people die from it every day is here heart problems they die from it because of what happened in the garden but you know what i'ma still keep praising god no matter what takes me out of here i plan on praising him anyway he's still worthy so church i i'm i i just want us to get to the spot where yeah let's let's let's get our expectations up let's look for god to do something and uh and i i just believe we're gonna start with these these little fellowship meetings amongst the churches but yes it is a possibility that it may evolve to a meeting back in south florida again praise the lord amen hallelujah glory to god i'm telling people asking for a while when y'all gonna do something in south florida folk want to come i think it's a blessing that people want to come be with you some folk some places people don't want to go hello but people want to come and be be a part of the experience that happens here and it's not just one church it's when all of us come together something special happens so i just appreciate the lord amen god bless you brothers you all can come and amen we'll dismiss the the congregation at this time uh god bless you we'll be back here on wednesday night at 7 30. god bless [Music] so [Music] so [Music] you [Music]
