[1:02:03] one last weekend so I was just very
[1:02:06] grateful not just for the trip at all
[1:02:08] than all the brothers that just kind of
[1:02:09] stepped up and did what Amen what we do
[1:02:12] have a spirit of true Tabernacle and
[1:02:15] just everybody followed them to the
[1:02:17] places they ban I think they call it
[1:02:19] next man up and that's that's the way
[1:02:22] y'all was handling things and I was just
[1:02:24] very very grateful brother Solomon just

[1:02:43] very very grateful thank you so much for
[1:02:45] the Solomon god bless you
[1:02:47] man raised alone man and I wanted to
[1:02:55] also Jesse because there's a number of
[1:02:58] things that's just in my heart and I
[1:03:01] wanted to also express my appreciation
[1:03:03] for brother Jerry a man owned on Friday
[1:03:07] night where he was alone as as one of
[1:03:16] the things we have a little privilege
[1:03:18] that we have amongst brothers we send
[1:03:20] out a man every other Tuesday and one of
[1:03:24] those things that we have on a prayer
[1:03:25] list is that either God was sin help or
[1:03:28] raise up help they met in the church and
[1:03:32] and I'm seeing God raised up some help
[1:03:34] in the church and the event brother Troy
[1:03:37] and man brother brother Jerry just
[1:03:39] raised enough to help and and we're very
[1:03:42] very grateful a man but for what the
[1:03:44] Lord is doing and you know so I last I
[1:03:49] think last week when I saw the service
[1:03:52] on the video one of prayers that I've
[1:03:55] always had I never wanted this church to
[1:03:58] be built a man on me a man on me and
[1:04:02] things that makes I want the church be
[1:04:04] built on word Christ because it's not
[1:04:07] about me it's about him and church ought
[1:04:09] to be able to still go I mean without a
[1:04:11] hitch when brother Jack not around and
[1:04:14] and and and I never wanted to be where
[1:04:17] people all they come to church for
[1:04:19] brother Jack here right we don't want to
[1:04:21] be that way either but what I saw last
[1:04:23] week I'm like
[1:04:24] god this is this is the fulfillment of
[1:04:27] what you know what I've been praying for
[1:04:29] and God allowed my eyes to see that you
[1:04:32] know I'm very very thankful for that so
[1:04:35] and there's just so much more that's
[1:04:38] that's that's in store let's see God
[1:04:40] doing and and I'm just I'm blown away
[1:04:43] I'm absolutely blown away who knows what
[1:04:45] the Lord has in store for a song but
[1:04:47] we're gonna be faithful advancing his

[1:08:02] what is written that Abraham had two

[1:08:09] a freewoman but he who was of the
[1:08:15] bondwoman was born after the flesh but
[1:08:20] he of the freewoman was by promise which
[1:08:26] things are an allegory

[1:08:32] covenants the one from the one from the
[1:08:37] mount sinai which gendereth to bondage
[1:08:40] which is Hagar for this Hagar is Mount
[1:08:45] Sinai and Arabia and answereth to

[1:08:56] above is free which is the mother of us
[1:09:01] all for it is written rejoice about
[1:09:07] barren that bearest not break forth and
[1:09:09] cry thou that travellers not for the
[1:09:12] desolate hath many more children than
[1:09:14] she which have a husband a man list will
[1:09:19] stop our reading there I think a little
[1:09:21] bit later on I want to pick up a little
[1:09:24] bit more than that that that chapter but
[1:09:28] we'll stop there for now let's just have
[1:09:30] a word of Prayer and now we will go into
[1:09:33] our thought for today father we thank
[1:09:34] you for the opportunity we have to stand
[1:09:38] in the presence of the Lord to read the
[1:09:41] Word of God to hear the word of God it's
[1:09:43] certainly a man a grand privilege as we
[1:09:47] come this day we pray that the Holy
[1:09:50] Ghost would take control over this
[1:09:52] portion of the service as we have felt
[1:09:54] your presence through the worship
[1:09:55] through the specials amen now through
[1:09:59] the word and now we ask God that you
[1:10:01] would just take control of our
[1:10:03] environment we take every spirit that's
[1:10:05] against the Spirit of God underneath the
[1:10:07] control of the Holy Ghost even right now
[1:10:09] it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen you
[1:10:13] can be seated
[1:10:19] so since I missed last Sunday
[1:10:23] hey man I'm have to give my mother's
[1:10:25] dang sermon today a man and just a
[1:10:30] little something that I had in my spirit
[1:10:32] that I wanted to share with you all and
[1:10:35] I believe God's timing is always perfect
[1:10:38] a man and what he does he's always
[1:10:43] perfect what I think I want to do here
[1:10:49] my lord
[1:10:50] a couple of things in my spirit y'all
[1:10:53] just bear with me a man as we go through
[1:10:57] this brother Jerry brought a scripture
[1:11:00] on Friday that Ben it hit me like a ton
[1:11:05] of bricks and and I wanted to just kind
[1:11:09] of go back to that I think what he was
[1:11:13] sharing connected a lot with what
[1:11:14] brother Troy was sharing on last week
[1:11:16] and and we haven't we have a
[1:11:18] responsibility you know I'll be open and
[1:11:22] honest with you all there
[1:11:26] you know with with the the turn of
[1:11:30] events with you know some of the things
[1:11:32] that's happening right here in our and
[1:11:35] our myths and our own families and
[1:11:37] things like that hopefully can be read
[1:11:39] between the lives but some of these
[1:11:41] things that are that are happening we
[1:11:44] see certain spirits that have come into
[1:11:46] the land today and and oftentimes you
[1:11:49] know actually you know before I preach
[1:11:50] the message containment I was a little
[1:11:53] sensitive to you know just just the
[1:11:57] condition I didn't want to offend
[1:11:58] anybody
[1:11:59] not intentionally that's not what we're
[1:12:01] trying to do intentionally right if
[1:12:03] preaching the word offends you then you
[1:12:05] got to get back in line somewhere right
[1:12:07] but but you know there there's a there's
[1:12:10] a you know I know sometimes some I've
[1:12:12] seen preachers do it where they
[1:12:14] intentionally go after certain things or
[1:12:17] certain people that's that's that's one
[1:12:19] thing and I don't think that's right
[1:12:20] right but then on the other side I think
[1:12:23] that you know when certain things happen
[1:12:26] or or are happening
[1:12:29] we have to have a defense right and if
[1:12:33] sometimes it has to come forth from the
[1:12:35] pulpit but it's not uh you know
[1:12:37] something to to hurt somebody you know
[1:12:39] that that's that's not the objective and
[1:12:42] what we're what we're trying to present
[1:12:43] but if we could warn somebody then then
[1:12:47] we want to do the best that we can there
[1:12:50] so you know there's out there some
[1:12:52] things I felt like the Holy Spirit was
[1:12:53] sharing with us on last Sunday you know
[1:12:55] through brother Troy sermon and then
[1:12:57] picked it up again on Friday night and
[1:12:59] brought it through brother brother Jerry
[1:13:02] and you know I know brother Troy was
[1:13:04] kind of hitting a man just just how the
[1:13:07] devil operates how sneaky is you know
[1:13:10] how if soul plan is just to get worship
[1:13:12] and folk and go to church every Sunday
[1:13:16] and not realize that they actually
[1:13:18] worshipping Satan and not God in church
[1:13:22] right I mean that'sthat's how slick he
[1:13:25] was know and don't think I'm alright
[1:13:27] because he was seeking worship in heaven
[1:13:30] right so so I think if you can try to
[1:13:33] get it in heaven what you think you're
[1:13:34] doing Church right so so so you know
[1:13:38] sometimes you have some honest people
[1:13:40] honest hearted people very I mean pure
[1:13:44] in their motives and an object of some
[1:13:46] other month not all of them are but some
[1:13:49] of them are honest and you know and they
[1:13:51] would they would um you know they reduce
[1:13:53] some things but I'm doing that don't
[1:13:55] realize that they way out of the will of
[1:13:56] God right don't go and realize that you
[1:13:59] know and and and and unfortunately you
[1:14:00] know we all we can do just see what the
[1:14:02] word say you know because there's many
[1:14:04] people that would ask is like you know
[1:14:06] if they doing the best they can and you
[1:14:09] know maybe they just don't believe the
[1:14:10] message you know but they're doing the
[1:14:12] best they can't say that's that's
[1:14:13] reasoning that's what Satan used
[1:14:15] wouldíve reasoning is what reasons why
[1:14:19] you go to the hospital reasoning is why
[1:14:23] children are born a man and Hart liebe
[1:14:26] reason is why we go to work every day
[1:14:30] reasoning produced this right if we
[1:14:33] would have just stayed with the Lord we
[1:14:35] were
[1:14:35] reasoning produced war right reasoning
[1:14:41] produced sickness reasoning produces a
[1:14:44] lot of negative things that we you know
[1:14:47] we would another experience it's even if
[1:14:49] evil just stay with the word but so so
[1:14:52] we can't approach this thing we reach
[1:14:54] that we ought to say over the worst and
[1:14:56] I'm gonna tell you now you know you can
[1:14:57] be we will talk about this in some
[1:14:59] school you can be very Amen sincere you
[1:15:02] can be a foolish virgin sincere virgin
[1:15:07] clean right you can be you can be all of
[1:15:11] that and still be lost right so we don't
[1:15:16] want to be foolish virgin we want it we
[1:15:18] want to be wise a man in this hour what
[1:15:21] we're doing so you know brother brother
[1:15:22] Jerry hit this scripture out of second
[1:15:24] Thessalonians 2 it I'm a oh I didn't
[1:15:25] even give you all my title amen the
[1:15:27] title is another woman's bosom so let's
[1:15:37] let me let me try to get to that though
[1:15:40] if I can't I got that you know praise
[1:15:43] the Lord second because second
[1:15:45] Thessalonians to a man the 2nd
[1:15:48] Thessalonians
[1:15:49] lordy God a man so this is a brother
[1:15:54] Jerry hit this and I just wanted to read
[1:15:55] this real quick and then I got a quote I
[1:15:57] want to try to slip in there with y'all
[1:15:59] on this so if you if you you know the
[1:16:02] second throw these second Thessalonians
[1:16:04] to brother Brandon brings out a lot of
[1:16:05] that in the first steel you know because
[1:16:07] he's dealing with the man of sin and and
[1:16:10] just the stages of that man of sin and
[1:16:12] how the Pope is involved in that stage
[1:16:14] you know and you know and and actually
[1:16:17] what most people don't realize because
[1:16:19] you know again tie these things together
[1:16:21] for the Troy hit it last week the you
[1:16:24] got denominational people preaching
[1:16:27] against the Catholic Church publicly
[1:16:31] because they can see according to
[1:16:34] scripture that the Catholic Church was
[1:16:36] called the great they can see that
[1:16:40] and preach it but the Bible also say
[1:16:44] that the hat harlots
[1:16:47] children and don't realize that they
[1:16:50] wanted a children and every child
[1:16:54] eventually goes back to his mama it's
[1:16:58] Mother's Day on tell about Mother's Day
[1:17:00] every child gonna go back to its mother
[1:17:02] and we don't realize that spiritually
[1:17:06] and then the church nominal is going
[1:17:09] right back into the Catholic Church and
[1:17:11] have no idea that it's happening Oh
[1:17:15] glory to God how you gonna make it when
[1:17:18] denomination we already know that we're
[1:17:20] denomination head it to they going back
[1:17:22] to where they come from because they did
[1:17:25] not come from God
[1:17:30] all right Church so I mean we gotta we
[1:17:34] gotta just you know apply to you with
[1:17:36] that and one of the preachers told me
[1:17:38] say brother we have a responsibility you
[1:17:40] know as the priests we got to keep the
[1:17:42] people from leprosy that's my job and in
[1:17:46] order to keep you from less leprosy I
[1:17:48] gotta isolate some stuff all right and
[1:17:52] I'm not coming against that's not that I
[1:17:55] don't love people I love them and I love
[1:17:56] you too and when I'm isolating that's
[1:18:00] protect you and them right that's that's
[1:18:05] what we're doing here so you know I hope
[1:18:07] you can you know understand my spirit
[1:18:10] please second Thessalonians 2 verse 10
[1:18:12] through 12 it says and with all
[1:18:13] deceivableness big words big words
[1:18:17] deceivableness right of unrighteousness
[1:18:20] in them that perish because they
[1:18:24] received not the love of the truth they
[1:18:30] might be saved right that they might be
[1:18:33] saved so so just than that that those
[1:18:35] words alone that one verse we realized
[1:18:37] salvation is found in the truth and we
[1:18:41] know Christ is the truth we know that we
[1:18:45] know Christ as the truth but you know
[1:18:47] what people say is that salvation found
[1:18:50] in Christ any man but Christ is the
[1:18:54] truth oh he said it he said I am the way
[1:19:01] but truth and the life's of you looking
[1:19:05] for Christ you to have to find him in -
[1:19:08] [Music]
[1:19:12] glory to God listen so so because they
[1:19:15] received not the love of the truth that
[1:19:16] they might be saved and you know you
[1:19:19] know in those day if they didn't receive
[1:19:22] the truth
[1:19:22] they weren't safe in Moses day if they
[1:19:25] didn't receive the truth they weren't
[1:19:27] saved and it's the same time if you're
[1:19:30] not gonna receive the truth today how
[1:19:31] can you know no you might thank you safe
[1:19:35] but you don't understand you're under
[1:19:38] this next verse yeah you thank you safe
[1:19:42] oh my that's that's heart y'all you
[1:19:45] think you see you act like you said you
[1:19:47] can impersonate Christians demons can
[1:19:51] impersonate Christians let me go on say
[1:19:54] and for this cause because they won't
[1:19:56] receive truth right the love of the
[1:19:57] truth for this cause God shall send them
[1:20:05] before about how evil spirit from the
[1:20:07] Lord evil spirit not that your God shall
[1:20:12] send them because you're rejecting his
[1:20:15] truth God shall send them strong
[1:20:17] delusion now here's the problem the
[1:20:20] strong delusions that you you actually
[1:20:22] think you're Christian that's the
[1:20:25] delusion you really think you're
[1:20:27] Christian and you think at the end all
[1:20:30] of us don't get in some kind of way
[1:20:31] nodding I work that way no I mean the
[1:20:34] the the seed of the bondwoman is not err
[1:20:38] with the freewoman all right let me go
[1:20:42] home since when is called God's are
[1:20:43] sending from the loose initiative that
[1:20:45] they that they should believe a lie and
[1:20:47] not only that that they share that they
[1:20:49] all might be damned who believed not the
[1:20:52] truth but had pleasure in
[1:20:54] unrighteousness now I got I got a lot to
[1:20:58] to stay here and Lord just helped me to
[1:21:00] get to get to all of this you know what
[1:21:04] I'm gonna go to this part right now
[1:21:06] I was gonna save it so later I'm gonna
[1:21:08] go ahead and hit it right now I'm going
[1:21:10] to the seed is not air with the shucks
[1:21:20] now let's let's look at this I'm
[1:21:23] paragraph 70 a man with the C does not
[1:21:26] air with the shucks now I want you to
[1:21:28] notice this and Lord that y'all just
[1:21:30] bear with me there wouldn't notice Sarah
[1:21:33] the tassel had that had the pollen the
[1:21:37] Jewish nation raised from her from out
[1:21:40] of cerebral Isaac through Isaac brought
[1:21:42] Jacob Jacob brought the patriarchs and
[1:21:44] through the picture patriach brought
[1:21:46] forth the nation Mary the Virgin's faith
[1:21:49] produced a true spiritual see Word made
[1:21:53] flesh see the three women three women
[1:21:55] that this seat was carried through in
[1:21:57] his trunk I'm Hagar Sarah and Mary
[1:22:00] alright he's using them as types and if
[1:22:01] I could just use it he's using them as
[1:22:03] allegories okay I'm gonna just leave it
[1:22:07] like that and I got to go back and try
[1:22:08] to hit it a little bit later but brother
[1:22:10] branham is bringing to us an allegory
[1:22:12] Paul brought to us an allegory right
[1:22:15] when in Galatians 4 when Paul used a
[1:22:18] statement which things are an allegory
[1:22:20] right I mean that that means there's a
[1:22:23] there's a there's something here but
[1:22:25] there's a greater meaning behind it and
[1:22:26] I'm just symbolizing it this way right
[1:22:29] so he's using so when you look at woman
[1:22:32] in Scripture you got to think Church
[1:22:34] because every woman is an allegory to
[1:22:37] the church there's a greater meaning
[1:22:39] there hallelujah right and so so so when
[1:22:43] Paul is bringing that Paul is giving us
[1:22:46] this allegory even tells us you know
[1:22:48] very clearly who Hagar was says she was
[1:22:50] Mount Sinai right she was Mount Sinai
[1:22:53] elite leave that leave that leave that
[1:22:56] quote there that's fun I'm I gotta go
[1:22:59] into spirit justly so y'all just bear
[1:23:01] with me here please bear with me but he
[1:23:04] said hey guys Mount Sinai in Arabia and
[1:23:07] what this is is that that's where they
[1:23:09] received the Ten Commandments all the
[1:23:11] commandments from the Lord this is where
[1:23:13] they got Commandments right the law okay
[1:23:16] Paul Paul Sam Hagar represent the
[1:23:18] receiving the law all right but Sarah
[1:23:21] was an allegory or a type of Jerusalem
[1:23:25] the free woman all right and then what
[1:23:27] happened at Jerusalem a man went with
[1:23:30] the free run free free woman
[1:23:32] that's where Christ the true promised
[1:23:35] learn that Isaac but Christ the true
[1:23:38] part a son brought grace oh yeah right
[1:23:44] so we thank God but a low but we needed
[1:23:47] great and this is what Paul is trying to
[1:23:50] get the people to see hallelujah and
[1:23:53] even before he brings them to that he
[1:23:56] acts from in verse 21 it says he that
[1:23:58] desire to be under the law well what is
[1:24:01] he saying because you know I was under a
[1:24:04] man bondage when I was in denomination
[1:24:08] hallelujah but I come to freedom when
[1:24:11] this word was revealed to me Oh glory to
[1:24:15] God
[1:24:15] so polina want to go back to the
[1:24:17] nomination I'm going back to the law all
[1:24:22] right let me go let me go on let me go
[1:24:25] woman all right so this quote here that
[1:24:28] I'm reading out of the sea does not air
[1:24:31] with the ship he says the three women
[1:24:35] three three women that that this sea was
[1:24:39] carrying through one of them was
[1:24:40] actually Abdal tree
[1:24:42] all right so Hagar relationship with
[1:24:44] Abraham was an adultery
[1:24:46] all right under polygamy and it was
[1:24:49] legal back then it's not legal today
[1:24:51] Amen but but but
[1:24:54] so under under adultery action adultery
[1:24:57] under polygamy the second when he
[1:24:59] brought forth Isaac under from from on
[1:25:01] Sarah he said the second was a free
[1:25:03] woman and the third one had no sex
[1:25:06] affair at all but by faith she believed
[1:25:09] the Word of God
[1:25:10] Hagar Sarah boasts Aaron Hagar was six
[1:25:13] but Mary was virgin by the power of the
[1:25:16] promised Word of God that's right he
[1:25:17] goes on to say the stump Hagar two wives
[1:25:21] doubted the promise but watch what's
[1:25:24] that brought forth when Hagar the second
[1:25:27] wife of Abraham
[1:25:28] which was just i absolutely a concubine
[1:25:31] wife but she broke up the man what kind
[1:25:34] of man was he the Bible said he was a
[1:25:36] wild man he lived by his boat and no man
[1:25:41] would conquer him look at this
[1:25:44] he was untamable I'm convertible unruhe
[1:25:49] generated oh my god so so so so Ishmael
[1:25:54] produced by Abraham is a man it's
[1:25:58] uncomfortable oh my god see this is my
[1:26:03] you know and if I could just you know
[1:26:04] just kind of take you back my brother
[1:26:07] branham say when in Revelation where
[1:26:09] save Jesus stands at the door and knocks
[1:26:12] that was true the entire age and that
[1:26:15] one just to an individual that was some
[1:26:18] hour to our age because that ain't the
[1:26:20] denominational age will never be
[1:26:22] converted untamable listen I regenerated
[1:26:27] listen he cannot be tamed he was a wild
[1:26:30] man because he was other contrary to
[1:26:32] God's Word and if y'all just you know I
[1:26:35] ain't tellin number the truth the
[1:26:36] denominational Church they produced a
[1:26:38] while untamable Christians stuff that
[1:26:43] going inside the church that would have
[1:26:45] never happened years ago
[1:26:48] I'm Tama when you start talking to them
[1:26:50] they got every excuse as the right here
[1:26:52] for their life if not it's not what the
[1:26:55] Bible says what my bishops thing you
[1:26:57] know your bishop got a love spirit
[1:27:00] that's why he want the sisters up there
[1:27:02] dancing like that mister truth in their
[1:27:08] hand he got a lot spirit that's why he
[1:27:11] that's why he won them up they're
[1:27:12] running around but we call their self
[1:27:13] praise dance minister minister what
[1:27:19] brings a lot of church right but you
[1:27:22] know I mean you start looking at some of
[1:27:24] these things and and you know it's
[1:27:26] unattainable and it just keep getting
[1:27:29] worse and worse I mean I you know I was
[1:27:33] listening to one preached so I'm just
[1:27:34] like okay let me see you me got a pretty
[1:27:36] good-sized rhythm see what this guy

[1:28:18] can't even be converted now I know they
[1:28:20] go to the altar like they are getting
[1:28:22] converted but if you have been converted
[1:28:24] your life will change and this I'm
[1:28:29] telling you what when we talk about
[1:28:30] these women here because hey God gave
[1:28:32] birth to something alright hey God gave
[1:28:34] birth to something

[1:28:38] but about what Hagar gave birth to was
[1:28:40] untamable I'm convertible I'm
[1:28:44] regenerated alright he could not be tame

[1:29:55] comfortable
[1:29:56] glory to God you know I know some people
[1:29:58] get comfortable just a winner when a
[1:30:00] wedding is established that's when they
[1:30:02] feel that they can put some stuff on I'm
[1:30:04] not sure what scripture you got that
[1:30:05] from I don't know what Bobby you reading
[1:30:11] and even Jezebel didn't do it at
[1:30:13] weddings
[1:30:14] she did it all the time all right and so
[1:30:21] the only woman I've knowing the bar but
[1:30:22] I did it is Jezebel that's that's all
[1:30:24] when I found them you found somebody
[1:30:26] else that you cannot identify with as a
[1:30:28] Christian all right amen as a church
[1:30:33] member you can do those things but as a
[1:30:35] Christian you can't
[1:30:38] okay I'm going on I'm going on we not
[1:30:42] trying to produce that we trying to
[1:30:43] produce a bright for a rapture
[1:30:45] okay I got to go wrong I'm all mixed up
[1:30:49] in my notes but I must move forward a
[1:30:52] man a man we talk about another woman's
[1:30:56] bosom okay so now now let me go back
[1:31:00] here to another little quote here and
[1:31:03] I'm a slip around this is god of the
[1:31:04] evil age the god of the beige trying to
[1:31:07] bring this just this scripture of second
[1:31:10] Thessalonians 2 verse 10 through 12 back
[1:31:12] around and here and and god of this evil
[1:31:16] the god of this evil age the Prophet
[1:31:17] says now back through there you belong
[1:31:19] other ages you belong to denominations
[1:31:21] you belong to this that or the other
[1:31:23] what happened to the denominational
[1:31:26] stock it dries up the spirit keeps
[1:31:29] leaving and going on and it heads up in
[1:31:32] a seat you see and the temptation of
[1:31:35] both heads back the same way it was at
[1:31:39] the beginning notice don't don't don't
[1:31:42] I do not forget it now as John first
[1:31:45] John four five and six if you want to
[1:31:47] put that down he puts it the spirit of
[1:31:50] error now before I go further than that
[1:31:51] quota I have to let you read first John
[1:31:54] four or five or six then you understand
[1:31:57] the quote see this is what happened this
[1:31:58] is this is why we offer a lot of folk
[1:32:00] all mixed up because they didn't stop to
[1:32:02] read where the
[1:32:03] was getting this wrong he just gave you
[1:32:05] a scripture right all you have to do is
[1:32:07] stop reading the scripture now you can
[1:32:09] understand the next statement that he's
[1:32:11] about to make now look at this first
[1:32:13] time four five and six now look at this
[1:32:16] he says they are of the world therefore
[1:32:21] they speak of the world and the world
[1:32:25] heareth you wait a minute let me let me
[1:32:28] let me let me let me let me read that
[1:32:30] again they are of the world therefore
[1:32:33] speak day of the world and the world
[1:32:37] heareth them the bride is not listening
[1:32:38] to it but the world I hear you the
[1:32:42] denominational world
[1:32:43] alright Church we are of God he that
[1:32:48] knoweth God heareth us he that is not of
[1:32:54] God what a probably pulled it from he
[1:32:59] that is not of God heareth not us all
[1:33:03] right hereby I hereby know we the Spirit
[1:33:06] of Truth and the spirit of error so it's
[1:33:11] two spirits working in this last day and
[1:33:14] you gonna have to be able to decipher
[1:33:16] which one is the truth and which one is
[1:33:18] a pair all right because if you're not
[1:33:23] careful you give your baby to another
[1:33:25] woman's bosom and I think that's bad
[1:33:30] right well I mean here this woman went
[1:33:33] through all these labor pains and I mean
[1:33:35] couldn't eat certain things or her body
[1:33:38] was craving for stuff she didn't even
[1:33:40] like right but because the baby was
[1:33:43] asking for it the momma would go through
[1:33:45] great extremes to make sure the baby was
[1:33:48] satisfied and then go through all that
[1:33:50] and then all the pain of labor right to
[1:33:54] go through all the pain of labor and
[1:33:55] then I'm gonna give my baby to another
[1:33:58] person no no no I keep my baby praise
[1:34:02] the Lord I'm kidding I did all that I'm
[1:34:04] gonna keep this one praise the Lord
[1:34:07] search Amen I mean he used to be ashamed
[1:34:10] for a woman I want to give up a child
[1:34:12] women want to have children that was
[1:34:14] that was
[1:34:15] was a blessing for them right if a woman
[1:34:18] that have a child in the Bible days and
[1:34:20] that she felt really really bad that's
[1:34:22] my hand I was praying the way she would
[1:34:24] friend I gotta have a child and when God
[1:34:28] blessed her with a child now she did
[1:34:29] give up her baby but not to another
[1:34:31] woman she gave up her baby to God
[1:34:35] and Mama's you gonna give up your baby
[1:34:39] give your baby to God don't give your
[1:34:44] baby to another woman all right and I'm
[1:34:52] a retailer cool so y'all know where I
[1:34:53] got that statement from just stay with
[1:34:58] me please
[1:34:59] so now we understand there's these two
[1:35:01] spirits the Spirit of Truth in the
[1:35:02] spirit of error so the Prophet now goes
[1:35:05] on the stateís he says as John first
[1:35:07] John four five and six if you want to
[1:35:09] put that down he puts it the spirit of
[1:35:11] error Eve never just simply walked out
[1:35:16] willfully say I don't believe in God no
[1:35:19] it was an error she believed it was the
[1:35:24] error that that's what happened with E
[1:35:26] and you if you just look at the whole
[1:35:28] thing with everybody that has done what
[1:35:30] they've done it was an error I mean cuz
[1:35:33] where did it come from I mean you had
[1:35:36] never we've been around here for 30 40
[1:35:39] years and everybody just everybody loved
[1:35:41] the Lovelace words right but all of a
[1:35:44] sudden error got released in the land
[1:35:46] the spirit of error and before you know
[1:35:51] it now we're compromising with the error
[1:35:54] I'm already gone hallelujah what really
[1:35:57] got we start compromise we start giving
[1:35:59] it you know giving up a given ear to it
[1:36:02] not me I closed my I closed my spiritual
[1:36:05] womb a long time ago I I'm not a man a
[1:36:09] man a man he I don't bend that done that
[1:36:11] got me a t-shirt to tell you where I've
[1:36:13] been I know what it's like in
[1:36:15] denomination you're not taking me back
[1:36:18] praise the Lord Amen not does not to be
[1:36:21] a member
[1:36:23] hey man come on somebody emember
[1:36:29] all right they put that chat all they
[1:36:32] want to glory to God amen I found
[1:36:42] something much greener alright listen
[1:36:45] hey glory to God amen
[1:36:48] so it says it was an airship leave Satan
[1:36:50] never come out and said oh well that's
[1:36:52] that's not even the Word of God that's
[1:36:55] not even a word of God he admitted it
[1:36:57] was the Word of God but he put his own
[1:37:01] interpretation to it which God plainly
[1:37:03] told them not to do it what does this do
[1:37:10] so when they put their own
[1:37:11] interpretation to it it makes a strong
[1:37:13] delusion for the people to believe a lie
[1:37:18] and be damned by it now if you want to
[1:37:22] read it
[1:37:22] 2nd Thessalonians 2 11 all right as I
[1:37:26] have as I have about quite a few
[1:37:29] scriptures here and we won't be able to
[1:37:31] read them all one now and then I'll give
[1:37:34] them to you as it hasn't seemed strange
[1:37:36] that you question it or something and we
[1:37:38] might put it down and read for your
[1:37:40] goods now he's gonna throw a scripture
[1:37:43] he might not read them all but he gone
[1:37:45] through a scripture and what you need to
[1:37:47] do is go back and read it alright and as
[1:37:50] you read it it's gonna be real good he
[1:37:52] know what he's talking about
[1:37:54] it's been vindicated and all up
[1:37:56] sometimes people have no idea but
[1:37:57] probably the Prophet is preaching by a
[1:37:59] vision not just no regular preacher here
[1:38:03] it's a vision gone going forth and he
[1:38:06] preached about a vision matter ain't
[1:38:10] just showing him everything that just
[1:38:11] line it up to make sure we got to stay
[1:38:13] and rightly divide it so literally say
[1:38:14] says making a strong delusion as the
[1:38:17] Bible said it would
[1:38:18] second Thessalonians now this man of sin
[1:38:20] would come into existence and set in the
[1:38:24] temple of God as that what brother
[1:38:25] trolls talked about last week this
[1:38:28] member coming to existence said in a
[1:38:30] temple of God showing himself he was God
[1:38:33] and cause the people to go into strong
[1:38:36] delusion to believe a lie and believe it
[1:38:39] and would be damn fine that's the same
[1:38:42] thing he did to Eve he never told her
[1:38:44] the word wasn't right but give her
[1:38:46] strong delusion that she believed a lie
[1:38:49] the spirit of delusion is of the devil
[1:38:55] Devils now working in the children of
[1:38:58] disobedience disobedient to what once
[1:39:00] the children of the state disobedient to
[1:39:02] like heed was at the beginning their
[1:39:05] disobedient to the true Word of God now
[1:39:09] that's that's powerful y'all right
[1:39:12] because Eve miss you know don't eat from
[1:39:15] that tree right don't either eat from
[1:39:17] the tree when I was getting the evil
[1:39:18] that's what he's telling and in fact in
[1:39:21] this it's plain simple people
[1:39:24] eat from the same tree today it was not
[1:39:26] a physical tree it was a spiritual tree
[1:39:29] and when you're taking google over the
[1:39:34] Bible what tree are you eating from
[1:39:42] plainly did not all you're still gonna
[1:39:44] use Scripture right but it's the spirit
[1:39:47] of air with the scripture and that's not
[1:39:51] that's how that's how the devil slip see
[1:39:53] right there through the spirit of era
[1:39:55] and people going to not realize that
[1:39:57] they worship him the devil he died
[1:40:00] slipped him a lot
[1:40:01] oh my god he gave him father's sudden
[1:40:03] the Holy Ghost and they back time to
[1:40:05] think they doing something we got no
[1:40:06] hundred baptized the wrong way all right
[1:40:13] I'm trying to get to this now bear with
[1:40:16] me so he says here disobedient to what
[1:40:19] was the rest of children of this day
[1:40:21] disobedient to life Eve was at the
[1:40:22] beginning the true Word of God that's
[1:40:24] right now if you will want to get that
[1:40:26] let's turn to it the Ephesians two just
[1:40:29] a minute because it seemed good that we
[1:40:30] I'll stop just a minute if if you're in
[1:40:32] no big hurry and read some of this three
[1:40:36] some of this Ephesians two one two and
[1:40:38] says in you has he quickened who were
[1:40:40] once dead and trespasses and stands
[1:40:42] we're in times past
[1:40:43] you walked according to the course of
[1:40:45] this world a
[1:40:46] to the Prince of the power of the air
[1:40:47] the spirit now that worketh in the
[1:40:50] children of disobedience but we're not
[1:40:52] walking that way anymore
[1:40:53] amen we're walking according to the Word
[1:40:55] of God all right let me uh let me go
[1:40:58] further here aid man I think I want to
[1:41:02] pick up a scripture at this point in
[1:41:03] time Genesis 16 Genesis 16 all give us
[1:41:10] this allegory a man and what an allegory
[1:41:15] is it's a story a poem or a picture that
[1:41:19] can be interpreted to reveal a hidden
[1:41:21] meaning and man it's a story a poem or a
[1:41:26] picture that can be interpreted to
[1:41:28] reveal a hidden meaning and so when we
[1:41:31] pick up here
[1:41:32] a man Paul talking in Galatians about
[1:41:34] the allegory again in Galatians 425 he
[1:41:38] says Hagar was Mount Sinai right in
[1:41:40] Arabia and that's where they received
[1:41:42] the commandments or they received the
[1:41:44] law and Mount Sinai but then in verse 26
[1:41:47] of Galatians 4 he says Sara
[1:41:48] a man was type in Jerusalem because she
[1:41:52] was the free woman that brought forth
[1:41:53] the promised son and Christ is the true
[1:41:56] promised son and he brought grace they
[1:41:59] got law under Hagar but they got grace
[1:42:01] under Sara praise the Lord that's what
[1:42:04] we're trying to say here
[1:42:05] but now let's pick up this because when
[1:42:07] we start looking at again these women we
[1:42:09] in scripture we want to think of the
[1:42:11] church all right we want to think of the
[1:42:13] church when we look at these women in
[1:42:15] Scripture now let's pick up let's pick
[1:42:17] up this now give us is 16 now before we
[1:42:22] you know just read this first first
[1:42:24] understand that God has visited Abraham
[1:42:27] God has told Abraham that I mean here he
[1:42:31] is 75 years old does not have a child
[1:42:36] but God tells him that you're going to
[1:42:38] have a son you're gonna have a son and
[1:42:41] I'm gonna give you a son by Sarah your
[1:42:43] wife I'm going to give you a son and so
[1:42:47] Abraham and Sarah are going on for a
[1:42:49] number of years on this promise that God
[1:42:50] has given them and roughly a man 11
[1:42:55] years has gone by and and no son has
[1:42:59] huh right they got to promise 11 years
[1:43:03] ago and no Sun has come and they're
[1:43:05] getting older if I could just say the
[1:43:07] biological clock is ticking and because
[1:43:10] Sarah's biological clock is now ticking
[1:43:12] a man she feels the need to assist God
[1:43:18] right she wants to help God right I know
[1:43:21] what he said 11 years ago and and I want
[1:43:24] I want there's some things that I watch
[1:43:26] ups the first thing I need y'all to see
[1:43:28] is that Abraham had a son by Hagar whip
[1:43:34] seeing that you will understand that
[1:43:36] Abraham representing the father did not
[1:43:40] have any problems he could have children
[1:43:43] at 86 years old so the problem was not
[1:43:50] with father Abraham father you
[1:43:56] understand that the problem is not with
[1:43:59] dogs the problem has always been with
[1:44:03] the church that no one had a problem
[1:44:09] Abraham never had a problem he didn't
[1:44:15] even either body changed he was produced
[1:44:18] in children at 86
[1:44:32] let's pick it up these things are
[1:44:35] written for a reason right and we start
[1:44:37] looking at this Abraham never had no
[1:44:39] problem he never had no issue at all and
[1:44:41] he should have known that you should
[1:44:44] have known that sooner students instruct
[1:44:45] a man like oh I got no problem with my
[1:44:48] body but you know you don't produce this
[1:44:51] this this wild child you know in all
[1:44:57] honesty this is where the Arab nations
[1:44:59] come from Ishmael and God actually
[1:45:02] promised to I'm gonna raise up you're
[1:45:03] gonna have 12 boys and you know and they
[1:45:05] look just you know when you look at
[1:45:07] Ishmael and Isaac they kind of look
[1:45:09] alike because there are Isaac line here
[1:45:11] comes these twelve boys from Jacob right
[1:45:14] I mean but by age spell also had 12 sons
[1:45:17] right and instrument' was going to be
[1:45:19] like our OVA nations and stuff like that
[1:45:21] too
[1:45:22] God made him some of the similar
[1:45:23] promises oh my god but there's a
[1:45:27] scripture there where I'm gonna try to
[1:45:29] get to it and read it oh Allah I can't

[1:45:43] Ishmael might live before thee and God
[1:45:47] said Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a
[1:45:51] son indeed right God never changed his
[1:45:53] promise I'm gonna brought Ishmael on the
[1:45:56] scene but I told you Sarah don't have a
[1:45:58] child right Sarah thy wife shall bear
[1:46:01] thee a son of deep and thou shalt call
[1:46:03] his name Isaac John even had his name

[1:46:26] fruitful and will multiply him
[1:46:27] exceedingly well Prince's shall he beget
[1:46:30] and I will make him a great nation but
[1:46:35] my covenant Oh Lord Jesus right uuugh

[1:46:45] have blessings many of them will have
[1:46:50] blessings they will even feel the power

[1:47:01] covenant is not there but he said my
[1:47:04] covenant will I establish with Isaac we
[1:47:09] does not looking for blessings we want
[1:47:10] to come lit right but my covenant will I
[1:47:14] establish with Isaac which Sarah shall
[1:47:16] parent to me at this cent time in the
[1:47:19] next year you know I'm just going on a
[1:47:24] little further here she covered it
[1:47:25] something powerful God established a
[1:47:28] covenant you know you look at this whole
[1:47:30] thing amen
[1:47:32] Isaac was a perfect type of Christ you
[1:47:36] know we know that so many things that
[1:47:39] happen kind of in his life Isaac being a
[1:47:41] perfect type of Christ
[1:47:43] Isaac Isaac was to someone we talked
[1:47:49] about this covenant being establish with
[1:47:51] Isaac I start looking at it
[1:47:52] Isaac was the one to be sacrificed not
[1:47:56] Ishmael God say I bring Isaac Ishmael
[1:48:01] wouldn't know where to be found bring
[1:48:03] Isaac Isaac was the one to be sacrificed
[1:48:05] on Mount Moriah not Ishmael there's a
[1:48:09] covenant in Isaac listen look at this so
[1:48:13] Isaac is brought to Mount Moriah to be
[1:48:15] sacrificed Isaac is the one that's
[1:48:18] packing the wood on his back as they
[1:48:21] went up Mount Moriah right Isaac is the
[1:48:24] one that's acting asking his daddy you
[1:48:26] know you remember it took three days to
[1:48:27] get the Mount Moriah y'all know about
[1:48:29] them threes it took three days to get
[1:48:32] the Mount Moriah and here Isaac is going
[1:48:34] to Mount Moriah amen to be sacrificed by
[1:48:37] steady not knowing what was happening
[1:48:38] and when you begin to ask questions like
[1:48:40] that and I see the wood and I see the
[1:48:43] fire but where is the sacrifice and his
[1:48:45] daddy spoke by faith that God would
[1:48:48] provide not for himself but God will
[1:48:51] provide here
[1:48:52] a sacrifice and a ram came out of
[1:48:56] nowhere had to stop Abraham from from
[1:49:01] Lauren his hand on Isaac and Garcia I
[1:49:03] know that you were you faithful and you
[1:49:05] that I know that you love me and it's
[1:49:06] that place where God established the
[1:49:08] terms Jehovah Jireh our provider right
[1:49:12] and that RAM that was there on the
[1:49:15] mountain represented Christ a male lamb
[1:49:19] hallelujah and by the grace of God God
[1:49:24] led Abraham to the same mountain that
[1:49:27] Christ would die on when he came to
[1:49:29] earth where he gave His life our sins
[1:49:33] Isaac was where the Covenant was see
[1:49:36] through Abraham
[1:49:38] we got Isaac through Isaac we got Christ
[1:49:40] and we're Abraham's seed because of
[1:49:44] Christ so that the lineage the Covenant
[1:49:48] the lineage
[1:49:49] even I mean where where Christ was going
[1:49:51] to be born came through Isaac not
[1:49:53] through Ishmael oh my god there'll be a
[1:49:57] great people but the promise is not
[1:49:58] coming through them the promise is
[1:50:00] coming through Isaac watch Isaac can I
[1:50:03] put it this way
[1:50:04] the prom is coming up through
[1:50:06] denomination but through the pure Word
[1:50:08] of God rap Jim not coming through
[1:50:12] denomination through the pure Word of
[1:50:14] God truth okay
[1:50:18] can I go a little further God acts for
[1:50:22] awesome to be sacrificed not Ishmael it
[1:50:24] was Isaac that packed the wood on his
[1:50:26] back as he went up and mount I went up
[1:50:28] Mount Moriah Isaac was the one that was
[1:50:30] obedient unto death
[1:50:31] just like Jesus was obedient to death
[1:50:34] and the Prophet says and through Isaac
[1:50:36] was the seed of Abraham through Isaac
[1:50:37] come Christ and through Christ comes you
[1:50:40] right and the other and I just wrote
[1:50:42] this down Christ came salvation came
[1:50:46] Redemption came restoration came through
[1:50:50] the lineage of Isaac not Ishmael praise
[1:50:54] the Lord the Covenant was through Isaac
[1:50:57] alright let's go on back here amen and
[1:51:01] just pick up a couple things here Oh
[1:51:03] Lord Jesus
[1:51:06] alright Genesis 16 now I was gonna read
[1:51:09] this and deviated remember everyone no
[1:51:16] problem with Abraham Abraham gave forth
[1:51:20] he brought forth
[1:51:21] Ishmael so we know he can have children
[1:51:24] at 86 if he can do it at 86 he can do it
[1:51:27] at 100 phrase alone the problem was
[1:51:31] never with Abraham the problem was
[1:51:33] always with Sarah and she the one
[1:51:36] recommended this thing well we came
[1:51:38] ready to see right now she the one
[1:51:39] brought this home
[1:51:40] Sarah's doubt Sarah's compromise and now
[1:51:47] you know come on now let's just let's
[1:51:49] just let's get on the scene for a little
[1:51:51] bit then we got husbands and wives here
[1:51:53] now if God were to give you a promise as
[1:51:57] a husband that you know he you don't
[1:51:58] have face to face talk with God
[1:52:00] and he said you're gonna have you're
[1:52:01] gonna have a son and you gonna call his
[1:52:03] name Isaac and Syrian wife come bare now
[1:52:06] you're gonna believe that you're gonna
[1:52:07] hold on to that you're gonna go home and
[1:52:09] share it with Sarah and you know what
[1:52:10] you know there's going to be multiple
[1:52:13] conversations not one this same there's
[1:52:16] no after the 11 years we've been waiting
[1:52:18] for you let me hear it ain't nothin
[1:52:19] happenin and Abraham I believe this is
[1:52:21] the way God gonna do it I think it took
[1:52:23] multiple conversations to break Abraham
[1:52:25] down Oh Lord Jesus
[1:52:28] cuz cuz I'm gonna tell you if you're not
[1:52:29] careful it's going to be multiple
[1:52:31] conversations and they're gonna use that
[1:52:34] to break you down that's why you got to
[1:52:37] stay with the word every time and if you
[1:52:40] use the word they'll stop talking to you
[1:52:45] they'll stop they'll leave you alone if
[1:52:48] they know they go get the words but
[1:52:50] where they are looking for is where than
[1:52:52] where's the weakness and once we can
[1:52:55] identify witness then they coming i'ma
[1:52:57] tell you I don't hear from nobody
[1:53:02] amen cuz we know you didn't know what
[1:53:05] they're gonna get you're gonna get the
[1:53:07] word no no no we ain't got time to
[1:53:09] sympathize we talked about rapture
[1:53:12] and we closed it down we ever been
[1:53:15] praise the Lord all right
[1:53:18] a priest identified leprosy quick out
[1:53:22] you can't hurt somebody all right come
[1:53:27] on let me go over here here in
[1:53:29] and-and-and-and-and Genesis 16 I want to
[1:53:32] pick this up because look at this
[1:53:33] now Sarai Abrams wife there have no
[1:53:38] children and she had a handmaid an
[1:53:41] Egyptian whose name was Hagar and Sarai
[1:53:44] said unto Abram behold now the LORD hath
[1:53:49] restrained me from bearing now you gonna
[1:53:51] put this on God when God made you a
[1:53:56] promise the LORD hath restrained me from
[1:53:59] bearing I pray thee go in unto my Mane
[1:54:05] it may be that I may obtain children by
[1:54:08] her period I mean this conversation been
[1:54:16] happening for a little bit then the
[1:54:18] Bible say and Abraham hearkened to the
[1:54:20] voice of Sarai because you know they've
[1:54:23] been talking about this for a while and
[1:54:24] I'm sure he said no no that's not the
[1:54:26] way God said do it no but no I'm telling
[1:54:28] I mean Abraham you know when they went
[1:54:32] ahead he did it and look at this and
[1:54:33] Sarai Abrams wife took Hagar her made
[1:54:38] Egyptian after Abram had dwelt ten years
[1:54:42] in the land of Canaan and gave her to
[1:54:44] her husband Abram to be his wife look at
[1:54:48] it and he went in unto Hagar and she
[1:54:50] conceived and when she saw that she had
[1:54:53] conceived her mistress was despised in
[1:54:55] her eyes and Sarai said unto Abram I
[1:54:59] mean it's already a problem and you know
[1:55:01] just just at the conception there's a
[1:55:03] problem all right a problem has already
[1:55:05] started so verse 5 says if so
[1:55:07] right-center Abram my wrong be upon thee
[1:55:12] I have given my maid into thy bosom and
[1:55:18] when she saw that she had conceived I
[1:55:21] was despised in her eyes the Lord the
[1:55:24] Lord judge between me and
[1:55:26] but Abram said unto Sarai behold thy
[1:55:29] maid is in thy hand due to her as it
[1:55:32] pleaded thee and when Sarai dealt hardly
[1:55:35] with her she fled from her face now
[1:55:38] let's go on and the angel or found her
[1:55:41] by a fountain of water in the wilderness
[1:55:42] by the fountain in the way up way to
[1:55:45] shore amen
[1:55:47] and he said Hagar Sarai's me whence came
[1:55:52] this down and where the wilt thou dole
[1:55:55] and she said I flee from the face of my
[1:55:58] mistress Sarai III I'm you know now
[1:56:02] there's a lot in here but I'm gonna have
[1:56:03] to inject this too because we're not
[1:56:05] preaching this way and I know I got I
[1:56:06] got I got loved ones that are better
[1:56:08] that of trap and with the spirit of
[1:56:10] error right but I but but when I leave
[1:56:13] when I went when Moses left Egypt he
[1:56:17] didn't even cows hooked behind and when
[1:56:20] I'm leaving for a rapture this third
[1:56:23] Exodus I don't plan on leaving my family
[1:56:24] behind me and gotta make sure if he
[1:56:30] meant so he met Hagar at sure God will
[1:56:34] make sure gotta meet my family at sure
[1:56:43] glory to God Amen hallelujah allegories
[1:56:48] types Amen but I'm calling them right
[1:56:52] all right the bride will not be deceived
[1:56:55] somehow someway that thing oh I got a
[1:56:58] quote on here on read it brother Branham
[1:57:00] saying and somehow someway they sitting
[1:57:02] at the marriage supper of the Lamb and
[1:57:04] got with his majestic fingers well it
[1:57:07] unravel all the knots God with his
[1:57:13] majestic fingers will unravel all the
[1:57:16] knots so all the questions that they
[1:57:18] have you might not be able to answer but
[1:57:20] God can and God will unravel all the
[1:57:23] knots I'm looking forward to that
[1:57:28] alright let me let me go on here alright
[1:57:32] so verse 18 says Hagar Sarai's me which
[1:57:34] came is doubt and whither without though
[1:57:36] and she said I plead from the face of my
[1:57:38] mistress Sarai and
[1:57:40] the angel the Lord said on her return to
[1:57:42] thy mistress and submit thyself under
[1:57:44] her hands now this is where I'm getting
[1:57:46] my thought from another woman's bosom
[1:57:49] because Sarah's plan was to raise this
[1:57:51] child as a home that was Sarah's plan
[1:57:56] I'm gonna raise you yes I'm gonna give
[1:57:58] you Hagar and then I'm gonna raise them
[1:58:01] as my own child right and uh and she
[1:58:05] didn't realize that the child that was
[1:58:07] actually being produced was an
[1:58:09] unattainable child a regenerated child
[1:58:13] oh wow child this is what you get when
[1:58:20] you try to help God out right that but
[1:58:23] if she does that's way too old god she
[1:58:25] would have got her promise no matter how
[1:58:28] long it took but she tried to help out
[1:58:30] and she ended up with this unruhe
[1:58:32] generated but yet he got some minister
[1:58:34] to Sarah and gave her child so another
[1:58:37] woman's bosom I'm carrying I'm producing
[1:58:43] it I'm doing all these other things and
[1:58:45] you're gonna have me give the child back
[1:58:47] to this woman God say I want you to do
[1:58:48] that I see how i'ma tell you you came
[1:58:51] when you got some matter with that type
[1:58:54] of sphere to untamable spirit they not
[1:58:55] gonna stay around the word they'll leave
[1:58:59] all right let's go on and read something
[1:59:03] here for you
[1:59:08] oh my god
[1:59:11] oh my god
[1:59:15] oh and listen I want to go to the scene
[1:59:21] is not air with the show and this is
[1:59:28] paragraph 136
[1:59:34] oh my
[1:59:37] so he says see Sara the church
[1:59:41] handpicked Hagar the church handpicked
[1:59:44] Hagar it didn't work did it
[1:59:48] no her hand-picked group won't work
[1:59:51] today either doctors and PhDs and LEDs
[1:59:56] don't do it all the carriers fail
[1:59:59] he says Luther fail as Hagar dent what
[2:00:04] the hey guard ooh hey God gave her son
[2:00:07] to another woman's bosom that's right to
[2:00:12] raise her child Hagar did that gave her
[2:00:15] circle only Son to another woman's bosom
[2:00:18] not his mother to raise him so that's
[2:00:21] the same thing Luther did when he gave
[2:00:23] his son justification over to the
[2:00:27] denomination to fool with you get that C
[2:00:31] so it when you when you when you oh my
[2:00:34] III mean as a parent I could not take my
[2:00:37] children's at the nomination neither
[2:00:40] join up I'd be giving my giving my
[2:00:42] giving my children to another woman's
[2:00:43] bosom they get life from Christ all
[2:00:48] right listen
[2:00:49] he said so that's the same thing Luther
[2:00:50] did when he gave his son justification
[2:00:53] over to the denomination to fool with
[2:00:55] that's exactly to raise him up Wesley
[2:00:58] fail the same way as salad did doubting
[2:01:02] the supernatural birth being the baptism
[2:01:04] of the holy ghost as Sarah did at the
[2:01:07] oaktree when Wesley was introduced to
[2:01:09] the supernatural when the Pentecostal
[2:01:11] age come on and West was introduced to
[2:01:13] speaking in tongues and all this they
[2:01:15] laugh to make fun of it all your Church
[2:01:17] of Christ and you so call you Baptists
[2:01:20] see these allegories right says since
[2:01:22] all you Baptists and Presbyterians and
[2:01:24] every one of you turn your nose up on it
[2:01:27] and win away from it right what did you
[2:01:28] do Wesley you saw your child to an
[2:01:31] organization and at diamond Parish
[2:01:35] that's exactly right but the word true
[2:01:37] where it went right on it didn't stay in
[2:01:39] that organization to move right on into
[2:01:41] Pentecost and such some more with it it
[2:01:44] was more it was a more mature son like
[2:01:46] the seed that fell into the womb and
[2:01:48] after a while it started in the backbone
[2:01:51] then to have lungs and then and have
[2:01:53] head and feet and after a while it comes
[2:01:56] to a place it was born that's right so
[2:01:58] that's how the church has matured the
[2:02:01] same way so brother Branham this just
[2:02:04] kind of struck me when I was listening
[2:02:05] to this message the seasons not able to
[2:02:07] shut how Hagar when she gave her son to
[2:02:11] Sarah to be raised she was given her son
[2:02:14] to another woman's bosom right and
[2:02:16] brother Branham was bringing it back how
[2:02:18] the church today went into doubt
[2:02:20] denominationalism they gave their child
[2:02:23] to another woman's bosom and and and I
[2:02:26] want to bring it a little closer to home
[2:02:27] because here we have this pure
[2:02:30] unadulterated words and what we're doing
[2:02:32] is and we got people leave in this pure
[2:02:34] on the dirt road on adulterated work
[2:02:35] going back to another woman's bosom
[2:02:40] mmm and I'm gonna tell you I didn't give
[2:02:42] my child to that I gave my child to the
[2:02:46] Lord and I'm expecting Amen the same way
[2:02:49] that Hagar I'm sorry the same way that
[2:02:51] Hannah gave her child a Lord God blessed
[2:02:53] her for that you know it's hard to give
[2:02:56] you a child to another woman's bosom you
[2:02:59] know that it's very difficult for a
[2:03:01] woman that's really in love with a child
[2:03:04] to just give it to another woman to
[2:03:06] raise I mean no this is my child I'll
[2:03:08] take care of that with I'll do that I
[2:03:09] got that I mean even you know we so bad
[2:03:14] nowadays because you know it used to be
[2:03:16] even if somebody back of my day the
[2:03:20] other people didn't have a right to
[2:03:22] chastise you but after it says sighs
[2:03:24] you've got to go tell that mama what you
[2:03:26] did
[2:03:27] hello somebody just don't check stop
[2:03:29] don't say nothing don't and you might
[2:03:31] get now you know you're not the mama
[2:03:33] I don't mind your doing what you did but
[2:03:37] you need to inform me as to what's going
[2:03:39] on because I I'm mama all right right
[2:03:44] but nowadays we don't we don't let
[2:03:45] nobody touch our children right I mean
[2:03:48] and and and and I understand ever summer
[2:03:50] needed a little a little pop everyone so
[2:03:52] let me get surprised
[2:03:55] let him get surprised standing next to a
[2:03:57] mother the church is something and say
[2:03:59] something and you know because you know
[2:04:01] it was it would hit first apologize
[2:04:04] later
[2:04:06] all right they said Wow and it just it
[2:04:11] just was automatic right the whole
[2:04:14] neighborhood would whip you right but
[2:04:17] but you know but and it was okay like
[2:04:19] that but but you know nowadays we got we
[2:04:21] got you know other young people rising
[2:04:23] up Nate you know because they want to go

[2:05:00] responsibility hello
[2:05:04] amen keep that baby in your bosom all
[2:05:08] right let me go on let me go on and but
[2:05:13] what mothers were really you know
[2:05:14] mothers that you know they they they
[2:05:17] look to raise their own children you
[2:05:19] know they they them they didn't think
[2:05:22] about abortions and nothing like that
[2:05:23] this is my child I'm gonna raise my
[2:05:25] child right but it's not easy it's not
[2:05:29] easy for a real mother to give her child
[2:05:32] to another woman's bosom it's not easy
[2:05:34] right Amen there's even when you a real
[2:05:37] mother have a problem dropping their
[2:05:38] kids off at a daycare and back in my day
[2:05:44] Wayne had no cameras to be watching
[2:05:47] what's going on at the daycare people
[2:05:48] can't even get work done got a little
[2:05:50] window opening in the top of the screen
[2:05:53] on the computer and they said looking at
[2:05:55] what's they got they I mean they put
[2:05:56] that IP address in and they looked right
[2:05:58] at that camera this with my toilets all
[2:06:00] day that's a real mother they concerned
[2:06:02] about their child but you got some
[2:06:04] others that have dropped that child off
[2:06:05] and ain't looking at nothing
[2:06:07] it was a nice babysitting service for
[2:06:09] him but a real mother is hot for her to
[2:06:13] give her child to another woman's
[2:06:16] listen a couple of mothers in the
[2:06:19] scripture I talked about Hannah
[2:06:22] that was Stamey's mother she made a
[2:06:24] promise that if God gave her son she
[2:06:26] would give that son back to the service
[2:06:28] of God right she wasn't giving it to
[2:06:30] another one but she was giving it back
[2:06:31] to God I remember brother Branham
[2:06:34] sharing the story of the mother dear and
[2:06:36] when Burt blew that whistle that old
[2:06:40] crew hunted he blew that whistle
[2:06:41] sounding like a little fawn say the
[2:06:43] mother did just rolls up out of nowhere
[2:06:45] look the deer look look the the hunter
[2:06:47] right in the eyes that ain't going
[2:06:48] nowhere cuz my baby is in trouble so
[2:06:52] that's the mommy there's one take care
[2:06:53] of her child and she would face death if
[2:06:56] she had to in order to take care of a
[2:06:58] child right also you know I thought
[2:07:01] about the woman in Berlin and King
[2:07:03] Solomon's date King Solomon he did they
[2:07:07] come together with him these ladies and
[2:07:09] had two children one later and slept on
[2:07:11] her child at night and killed a child
[2:07:12] stole the other ladies child put it
[2:07:14] underneath them and the little I quit my
[2:07:16] child let you got my child he said no
[2:07:18] that's my child they just argue and fuss
[2:07:20] about the child
[2:07:21] let's go before King Solomon got before
[2:07:22] King Solomon King said okay I tell you
[2:07:25] what I don't know which one of y'all
[2:07:26] right and whose child it is he said I'll
[2:07:28] tell you I bring this sword and say I'm
[2:07:30] gonna take the towel and I'm gonna split
[2:07:33] this child right in half and you can
[2:07:34] have half of and you can have half of it
[2:07:36] and one later say yeah that's right
[2:07:38] split it in half and the other they said
[2:07:41] no those finish she can have the child
[2:07:43] if Solomon King Solomon said I'm not to
[2:07:46] say brother Solomon but but King Solomon
[2:07:48] a man because he is a king to a man King
[2:07:52] and priests but they said that King
[2:07:54] Solomon to keep keep when he heard the
[2:07:55] woman say no don't doing say now I know
[2:07:58] who the real mother is because no mother
[2:08:03] will want to see a child go through
[2:08:04] something like that the other mother had
[2:08:06] already killed one child
[2:08:09] and didn't mind killing anymore he said
[2:08:12] I found the real mother give it to her
[2:08:17] see it's hard for a woman to give her
[2:08:20] child up that's why she was stupid
[2:08:22] Stalin she wanted to give up
[2:08:24] she's gonna fight for her child listen
[2:08:28] to this I thought about the woman in
[2:08:30] Elijah's day
[2:08:31] Elijah's date who stopped the product a
[2:08:34] child had died from a heat stroke and
[2:08:37] she went running looking for the Prophet
[2:08:39] you know I thought you told me that I
[2:08:42] was gonna have a son and you know when
[2:08:44] you're told you said and all that came
[2:08:45] to pass but I I told you I didn't want
[2:08:47] to be let down prophet see what she
[2:08:51] wouldn't let him go said he's in the
[2:08:52] house he'll take my rod and go lay it on
[2:08:54] the chassis no no no no no I'm not
[2:08:56] ain't got no faith in your rot and I got
[2:08:58] no faith in your servant but I want you
[2:09:00] to come you come and see about my child
[2:09:04] see it's hot real mother when the real
[2:09:06] mother's like that amen it's hard for
[2:09:09] her to just give her a child to some
[2:09:11] other woman's bosom I got one more real
[2:09:14] mother I want to talk to you about that
[2:09:16] had to give up her child but not to
[2:09:18] another woman
[2:09:19] and I want to read this out of X's 2
[2:09:22] verse 1 through 3 says this not bringing
[2:09:29] home here in a second I cut it all up
[2:09:31] but I pray that you all receive a meant
[2:09:34] something today
[2:09:36] Exodus 2 verse 1 through 3 it says there
[2:09:39] went a man of the house of Levi and took
[2:09:42] the wife a daughter of Levi and the
[2:09:45] woman conceived and bare a son and when
[2:09:48] she saw him that he was a goodly child
[2:09:51] she hid him three months notice this
[2:09:55] because there was persecution happened
[2:09:57] at the time that that Moses was born
[2:10:00] they were looking for all the children
[2:10:01] we're gonna kill him on every every
[2:10:03] child that was under two years old every
[2:10:04] male child they were going to kill but
[2:10:06] here this this mother is hiding her
[2:10:08] child three months hiding can you
[2:10:10] imagine
[2:10:11] Moses crying for a bottle and when you
[2:10:14] start crying for a bottle harder the
[2:10:16] mama trying to get a bottle to them as
[2:10:18] fast as possible
[2:10:19] cuz she don't want any
[2:10:21] finding no neighbor to hear that huh hot
[2:10:23] Sun is in here crying cuz they might
[2:10:25] give the secret away that she got a boy
[2:10:27] in here you can imagine how close they
[2:10:29] probably got to Moses being discovered
[2:10:33] look at verse 3 and when she could not
[2:10:37] longer hide him that's why I said it's
[2:10:39] very hard for a real mother to give her
[2:10:42] child up to another woman's bosom but
[2:10:44] when when she could not longer hide him
[2:10:47] she took for him an ark of bulrushes and
[2:10:50] daubed it was slime and with pitch and
[2:10:52] put the child therein and she laid it in
[2:10:54] the flags by the rivers bank so uh
[2:10:57] rivers breathe so here you know yoshi-p
[2:11:00] I found say I can't I can't keep him no
[2:11:03] mo if I keep him I'm gonna lose
[2:11:05] something but if I can just give him
[2:11:07] back to God then God can do something
[2:11:09] with her and she gave up her son to the
[2:11:14] now river not to another woman's bosom
[2:11:15] but she gave them to the now river and
[2:11:18] in trusted God parents sometimes you
[2:11:21] can't do no more than what you can do
[2:11:23] but once you give them to the hands of
[2:11:26] God God is able to take up a little
[2:11:28] further here Moses ended up in amen in
[2:11:32] an outrigger and before you know it
[2:11:34] Moses got into that that little arc and
[2:11:36] that arc ended up down in pharaoh's
[2:11:38] court they found a little baby Pharaoh's
[2:11:41] I believe sister found a little baby and
[2:11:44] and say you know when I'm a raise this
[2:11:45] child is my own now now Moses mother
[2:11:47] didn't give her to Pharaoh's sister
[2:11:51] that's not what Moses mother did but
[2:11:54] because she gave with a God when she
[2:11:58] made it when when Moses made it down
[2:12:00] there Miriam have to see him naked in
[2:12:02] and when they picked him up out of the
[2:12:04] you know out of out of this artists and
[2:12:07] that we need somebody that's capable of
[2:12:09] actually feeding this baby because ain't
[2:12:12] none of us had no children right we
[2:12:14] don't keep them that's our own right but
[2:12:16] we need somebody to be able to feed this
[2:12:18] baby and because mothers Moses mama
[2:12:22] trusted God with hot shock she
[2:12:27] end up getting a job in the corner
[2:12:30] Farrow to raise her own child she never
[2:12:34] gave ourselves another woman's bosom she
[2:12:37] raised her own child and there's some
[2:12:46] things we just can't do some things we
[2:12:50] just can't handle right now
[2:12:51] but I'm not giving them to another I'm
[2:12:53] not giving them to denomination I'm
[2:12:56] giving them the God and when you give it
[2:13:03] a gaga got a we're giving it back to you
[2:13:05] I got a couple of things I want to read
[2:13:14] it yeah I want mine right just give me
[2:13:16] this I want to read from this quote out
[2:13:18] of Mother's Day because your mothers
[2:13:20] that have gone through some things a man
[2:13:22] and I was thinking to myself there many
[2:13:25] mothers that could look and see that the
[2:13:26] families are not where they want them to
[2:13:28] be but I want to encourage you this
[2:13:31] morning I want to tell you God will fix
[2:13:33] it gotta fix it so this is a quote out
[2:13:40] of Mother's Day that says this then we
[2:13:44] we see him as we will we see it then we
[2:13:49] see him and we will not be as we are now
[2:13:53] we'll know how to love him more will not
[2:13:57] stand back with a little fear because
[2:13:58] we'll be like him well well he will be
[2:14:02] more of a relative to us than he is now
[2:14:05] we'll understand him better because
[2:14:08] we're so far away in the mortal bodies
[2:14:10] then then we'll have a body like his
[2:14:12] glorious body will know how to worship
[2:14:15] Him and when we see what the presence of
[2:14:18] his being has done to us changed us the
[2:14:21] old back young all the deforms
[2:14:24] straighten out
[2:14:25] Oh we'll understand then while his power
[2:14:27] healed us the question that's been in
[2:14:30] our mind how can he do it what with this
[2:14:33] somehow mysteriously they all fade away
[2:14:36] the knots that's been tied in the back
[2:14:39] of our
[2:14:40] will it be this how could it be somehow
[2:14:43] or another majestic fingers will just
[2:14:46] untangle unravel those knots see I mean
[2:14:51] we got some folks in some knots right
[2:14:52] now but somehow someway majestic fingers
[2:14:56] will untangle he can do it through a
[2:14:59] dream he can through it do it through
[2:15:01] somebody send him a prophecy right he
[2:15:03] got a way of doing things he can send a
[2:15:06] dark kick-butt majestic fingers will
[2:15:11] untangle unravel those knots and it will
[2:15:14] fade into one big crown of love then we
[2:15:20] shall see him then we shall be like him
[2:15:23] then we shall worship Him then we should
[2:15:27] we shall see mother as God wants her
[2:15:29] mother this is my momís mother would not
[2:15:35] be complete there without her family and
[2:15:45] giving them to another woman's bosom I'm
[2:15:47] taking them with me
[2:15:49] mother would not be complete there
[2:15:52] without her family because the greatest
[2:15:56] time of all her life is to see the
[2:15:59] children around the table and all of
[2:16:02] them healthy and happy and the see her
[2:16:07] pour the coffee or whatever she does
[2:16:09] maybe your mama like tea right amen
[2:16:12] whatever she does and fixes supper and
[2:16:15] her and dad sat down why that's the
[2:16:19] happiest time and Mama's life see her
[2:16:22] kid is all at home don't be missed in
[2:16:27] that day let the great chain of your
[2:16:29] family be hooked together link by link
[2:16:31] that every spoke be in the wheel and
[2:16:34] when we sit down with our families and
[2:16:38] groups across the canopies of eternity
[2:16:40] what a day that will be then we'll
[2:16:44] understand Church I'm looking forward to
[2:16:49] that
[2:16:50] I'm looking forward to that and I can't
[2:16:53] wait you know and I just love how God
[2:16:56] would allow the Prophet to make a
[2:16:57] statement like that in the message of
[2:16:59] Mother's Day what an encouragement to
[2:17:02] the months so I was reading a little
[2:17:09] something on the internet 21 statements
[2:17:12] about Mama's and this is gonna be in 21
[2:17:16] statements y'all bear with me Billy
[2:17:20] suddenly said I don't believe there are
[2:17:22] Devils enough inhale to pull a boy out
[2:17:24] of the arms of a godly mother Billy
[2:17:29] Graham said to many women have too much
[2:17:31] leisure time for their own good they
[2:17:33] have time for criticism gossip
[2:17:37] fault-finding and complaining they have
[2:17:41] time for idle games and laid to much
[2:17:43] attention to the things of the flesh
[2:17:45] they there are other women who have too
[2:17:48] little time for the enduring things of
[2:17:51] life they are too busy flitting about
[2:17:54] doing this and that they have great
[2:17:57] activity and much doing but they lack
[2:17:59] time for building Christian character
[2:18:01] both kinds of women to idol that the to
[2:18:05] idol and the too busy need to take time
[2:18:08] for meditation and quiet repose and
[2:18:11] prayer to God they need time to
[2:18:14] cultivate their souls that in turn they
[2:18:16] may cultivate their children's lives DL
[2:18:21] moody said the impression that a praying
[2:18:22] mother leaves upon her children is life
[2:18:24] long perhaps when you're a dad and going
[2:18:27] your prayer will be answered the Billy
[2:18:30] certainly said there is more power and a
[2:18:32] mother's hand than in a king scepter
[2:18:40] Lin Yutang says of all the rights of a
[2:18:43] woman the greatest right is to be a
[2:18:46] mother
[2:18:48] George Washington said my mother was the
[2:18:51] most beautiful woman I ever saw all I am
[2:18:55] I owe to my mother I attribute all my
[2:18:57] success in life to the moral
[2:18:58] intellectual and physical education I
[2:19:01] received from her I wonder how you got a
[2:19:04] physical education from his mama and
[2:19:13] rejection and rejection there never was
[2:19:16] a woman like her she was gentle as a
[2:19:18] dove and brave as a lioness the memory
[2:19:21] of my mother and her teachings were
[2:19:23] after all the only capital I had to
[2:19:26] start life with and the only and on that
[2:19:29] capital I had made my way Thomas fuller
[2:19:33] for a wife a wife take the daughter of a
[2:19:37] good mother hello any young man for a
[2:19:40] wife take the daughter of a good mother
[2:19:43] if you're looking for a wife but watch
[2:19:45] up mama if she got a good mama you're
[2:19:47] probably gonna end up with a good wife
[2:19:48] for a wife take the daughter of a good
[2:19:51] mother all right
[2:19:52] also Booker T Washington says and all my
[2:19:55] efforts to learn to read my mother
[2:19:58] shared fully my ambition and sympathize
[2:20:00] with me and aided me in every way she
[2:20:02] could if I have done anything in life
[2:20:05] worth attention I feel sure that I
[2:20:07] inherited the disposition from my mother
[2:20:12] Abraham Lincoln all that I am or ever
[2:20:15] hope to be I owe to my angel mother John
[2:20:21] MacArthur to be a mother is by no means
[2:20:24] second-class men may have the authority
[2:20:27] in the home but the women have the
[2:20:29] influence the mother more than the
[2:20:31] father is the one who molds and shapes
[2:20:34] those little lies from day one a Chinese
[2:20:38] proverb there's only one pretty child in
[2:20:40] the world and every mother has it
[2:20:46] a Jewish proverb a mother understands
[2:20:50] what a child does not sing our prophet
[2:20:56] William Branham said when motherhood is
[2:20:58] broke the backbone of the nation is
[2:20:59] broken
[2:21:01] Donna Maddox Cooper said when you were
[2:21:04] small in just a touch away I covered you
[2:21:06] with blankets against the cold night air
[2:21:08] but now that you're all tall and out of
[2:21:12] reach I fold my hands and I cover you
[2:21:16] with prayer this author is unknown but
[2:21:22] it says a mother's love has the ability
[2:21:24] to forgive even the most difficult child
[2:21:29] Henry Ward Beecher said the mother's
[2:21:32] heart is the child's schoolroom
[2:21:36] Mildred B Vermont said being a full-time
[2:21:39] mother is one of the highest salary jobs
[2:21:43] since the pavement is pure love Henry
[2:21:51] Ward Beecher said again the most
[2:21:53] important thing a father can do for his
[2:21:55] children is to love their mother Abraham
[2:22:03] Lincoln says I remember my mother my
[2:22:05] mother's prayers and they have always
[2:22:06] followed me
[2:22:07] they have clung to me all my life
[2:22:12] the last thing by our Prophet William
[2:22:15] Branham says a good Christian mother is
[2:22:17] a treasure to a human heart that's never
[2:22:21] forgotten no matter what your children
[2:22:23] go through they remember mama and at
[2:22:26] some point in time God come take the
[2:22:28] majestic fingers and unravel and
[2:22:31] untangle all the knives I got confidence
[2:22:37] in that and I'm looking forward to it
[2:22:40] that's my Mother's Day sermon god bless
[2:22:43] you all
[2:22:47] [Applause]
[2:22:50] what's that word of Prayer
[2:22:52] your God we are so appreciative of your
[2:22:57] word and just thinking here on the
[2:23:01] Prophet Lord just kind of share some
[2:23:02] things with this and my prayer is that
[2:23:05] we got would be alive and alert to what
[2:23:09] the Spirit is trying to speak to us in
[2:23:11] this hour the mother's father's they
[2:23:17] have so much that they're going through
[2:23:19] sometimes a family just get into
[2:23:21] disarray
[2:23:24] trying to hold on with everything we got
[2:23:26] but the best we can do is just hold to
[2:23:27] your word no matter what we see no
[2:23:29] matter what we hear we got to just stay
[2:23:33] with the word because it'll bring it out
[2:23:35] it'll it'll take care of it it will
[2:23:37] settle it the word knows and God if we
[2:23:41] could just be faithful we'll win the
[2:23:44] battle so Lord Jesus my prayer is that
[2:23:47] you just help us to to do all that we
[2:23:50] can a reminder of Jesus when he was on
[2:23:53] earth Satan came attacking him and
[2:23:56] attacking him and all he said was it is
[2:23:59] written it is written it is written and
[2:24:02] the Prophet told us that Jesus overcame
[2:24:04] the devil with the word he didn't use
[2:24:06] any supernatural power anything like
[2:24:08] that he just used the word that's the
[2:24:10] same thing that we use in order to
[2:24:12] overcome the enemy father help us we're
[2:24:17] not giving our children over to a
[2:24:20] denominational bosom the Lord we've
[2:24:23] raised them amen in this word we're
[2:24:25] going to continue to raise them his word
[2:24:26] there's there's a great attack against
[2:24:28] this word and as I was just sharing a
