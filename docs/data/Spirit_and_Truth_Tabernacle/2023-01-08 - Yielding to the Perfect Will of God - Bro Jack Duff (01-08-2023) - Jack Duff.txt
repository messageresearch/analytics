just welcome Sister Yvonne Robinson amen came to be with us on today man God bless you [Applause] and she was I heard the story was that her daughter actually attends school here and went home went home mama they have church in the school and uh and mama say I grew up in the church so I'm gonna go visit that church in the school and it's good to have you and they've been here this morning the Lord reached the bless you amen the Lord is good amen and he's doing great things uh in our midst amen amen appreciate the specials this morning I appreciate the worship song service I'm very grateful for the presence of the Lord I won't hold you longer ask that you get your Bibles and we'll read a scripture uh this morning and so good to see brother Robles amen sister Robles in the house of the Lord on the day and amen um he was down for a little bit but the Devil Couldn't keep him down amen and uh we certainly certainly thank God for touching him uh and y'all Brother Joseph made it back on on Wednesday night and uh you look better on the front road and in that hospital bed Brother Joseph amen but we thank God for bringing you through uh amen God God is God is good amen he told me before uh before he went on the uh the surgery and everything he said the Lord just well I'll I'll call it a vision but something he says uh we were at our new church that's the that's the other good part about it we were at our new church and he says uh brother Jack you called for the preacher to come out and you call me out brother Jack I said well brother and you ain't leaving here until that's manifested so there's two parts to that a new church and brother Joe got to give us a sermon at some point in time so so we uh we just we just we just believe in God and you know I was just um uh thinking someone turn to Romans 12 while while I'm talking here uh but I was just thinking this morning I said you know it God is a God that opens Red Seas God is a God that does the supernatural and um uh the one thing that I'm sure is that we don't have to uh struggle with the Enemy trying to get a church that's when God opens a door then God opens the door and when God closes a door then God closes a door but the God we serve when he's ready to move he doesn't makes it real easy it makes it really and everybody know that it's him uh so what I what I've come to understand that there is a purpose for our being here and if it's to pick up one soul if it's just to pick up one soul on our journey amen then we've done what God has asked us to do so I don't think it's by accident on since Yvonne heard that from her daughter and then decide to come God know what he's doing so amen we thank God for all things amen amen Romans 12 is is where I want to uh draw our attention to on today um the uh scripture says I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that ye present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God and I love the way Paul puts this which is your it's the least you can do your reasonable service and verse 2 says and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God Amen the Lord is a blessing to the reading of his word let's pray father we thank you for the ability to read the scripture in a very familiar scripture we've read this morning but God May the Holy Spirit make the word of God live in US father we don't want to come and just go through motions this morning but father we want to hear from you and we want you God to have your way uh in this portion of the service thank you for the anointing that has been here through the worship and the song leading and Lord the specials and everything now the word of God the most important part of service has come and we trust that you would speak to each and every heart those present those that are online speak to each one God and may you challenge us with your word today in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you you can be seated Amen in the presence of the Lord amen um I um I want to I'll give you my title here in a second but just just bear with me as we just kind of go through um just a few things a few things and I'll give you the title in a second uh early this week I guess uh a day or two ago I got a a text from Sister Amina Tom Wang and uh she had sent me this uh quote that I want to read and I and when she said I'm like this is exactly uh what was in my spirit and I just spelled it was a confirmation uh for you know just just just how I want to start the year off amen uh brother Spradley brought our our our new year sermon it did a wonderful job a man on last week and I the the scripture that he read out of uh the Book of Joshua is a very uh personal scripture you you haven't gone this way before all right you you you've never gone this path before and and since you've never walked this walk before you've never a man uh gone this path before he says the the best thing you can do is keep the word of God in sight amen don't don't get in front of the word amen don't get too far behind the word but keep the word of God in sight because the word is what gives us Direction and I think I believe brother smile is saying now you ain't been this way before but God has and since God knows the way all we got to do is follow amen just follow amen don't leave but follow amen so so you know I I I've been you know just dealing with some things in my own spirit and I want to bring something to the church and I'll give you my title like I said in a second but let me read this this quote from the message the contest uh this sermon the contest is one that brother Brandon preached as he was closing out one year and going into the next year amen and I thought it was just a very fitting quote that sister Amina sent me she said the quote says this the prophet says now beginning a new year it says I want to say not happy New Year to you I want to say this to you God bless you amen and if he does that that's all you have need of for the coming year and I trust that he will and he says and I'm by his grace we're going to try this next year he shall spare me spare you by his grace I hope I am a better Pastor amen next year than I have been this year praise God it says I hope I a better servant to Christ see I want to improve if you understand I mean that there's there's room for improvements come on somebody amen there's room for renovation bless it be the name of Lord I want to be a better Pastor amen I want to be a better servant to Christ I believe as Christians you want to be better Christians you want to be better in every every every area of a life better parents say man come on somebody better husbands better wives we we want to be better Hallelujah amen amen he says I'll try hard to to try to live closer more truer to bring the message just as he gives me I shall bring it to you the best that I can without holding with hope withhold nothing that he would want me to give you I'll do all that I know how glory to God and I know you feel the same way you feel like that we all want to work together now for the evening lights are certainly getting dim and the sun far setting amen the Earth is cooling off we know that spiritually speaking the church here it is the church is cooling off and the Revival is over we don't know what comes next but we will trust God for that whatever it is amen he says we'll trust God for it so you know I was just looking at that and that cooling off and I think it's um uh it's it's very fitting I think we are we we can all see that in our own lives amen we can see it in the world that we're living in there's a cooling off that has taken place and and I've said to myself we got to fight to stay warm Hallelujah we got a fight to stay warm we got to fight to stay on fire spiritually the devil always trying to take that fire the devil always trying to take your joy and trying to take your peace we have to fight for these things amen and I and I made this little statement to myself said lower spring blessings are great so that means the blessings that you get on your job and in your house and you know uh anything that helps us get through on this Earth those are lower spring blessings they're great I thank God for it but up a spring blessings are Eternal amen so we're asking God for upper spring blessings this year amen I believe that we're closer this year than we have ever been to the coming of the Lord and I know you have heard that um over and over in your life and sometimes because you've heard it so much it doesn't mean as much to you praise the Lord but but but but but eventually this this revelation's got to sink in we're getting closer to the coming of the Lord and and I want to ask the question are we getting closer to Jesus are we actually pulling further away from him uh our decisions taking us closer to the Lord are they actually taking us further from him amen because we're getting close did we're closer this year to the coming of the Lord than we've ever been amen and we got to get desperate for God hallelujah I sat with this in mind realizing that the coming of the Lord is so close with this in mind I need to do a spiritual checkup on my own life amen hallelujah amen I need to do a spiritual checkup on my own life and and I'm gonna tell you I want you to also do the same do it spiritual checkup on your own life Paul said to lay aside every sin and every weight that's so easily besets us amen and I'm asking a question to the Lord what can I lay aside this year that will allow me to draw closer to you now that's my question and since I had that question I felt everybody should just stop for a moment right glory to God just stop for a moment I want us to pause just for a minute hallelujah amen and and as we're making this pause if you have a sheet of paper amen nearby I want you to just just grab it if you don't have a sheet of paper maybe you can get your phone hey man and just grab it and just make a quick note but I want us just to pause just for a minute hallelujah amen glory hallelujah hallelujah amen and while we're in this pause amen I want you all just to uh uh uh say this this little prayer amen with me glory to God and you just repeat the words after me I'm going to say the prayer but you just repeat the words and and then after after after you repeat the words some of y'all may have an answer already to it Others May get the answer throughout this sermon but whatever it is I want you to write that answer down and hold on to it glory to God here's the prayer I want you to just uh say these words after me Lord show me something that I can lay aside this year Lord show me something that I can lay aside this year the rest of the prayer says something that would allow you and I to draw closer I want you to think about that just take a moment even those that are online take a moment amen I want you to be involved in the moment amen Lord show me something that I can lay aside this year something that would allow you and I to draw closer put that on a sheet of paper put it in your phone put it somewhere but that's what your goal is this year amen and and I don't want you to just wait to the end of the year to get your goal start on it today start working towards that goal today we're trying to get closer to the Lord not further away from God Hallelujah in Prior years amen here at the church we would um take a word that we would just kind of use and that would be our word for uh you know things that we want to accomplish that year and a couple years ago one of those words was replication amen and and I believe God certainly honored that and and allowed us to replicate in many ways praise God and then uh one of the other words that we had in the last couple years was being intentional about some things and I was very intentional in a lot of areas you know that that I knew and and I was happy that God uh gave us that but this year I was kind of struggling I was trying to find the mind of God uh for our church and you know what is it that God would want us to to kind of focus our attention on and um and I was praying over it and just just meditating on it and I just really couldn't get any peace on it so uh a few days ago uh maybe about a week ago or so a brother beginning to preach on on this morning call that I'm on brother Stanford Christ is his name up there in in in in North Florida and he was preaching saying you know every year from my church we take a word and we we use that word to kind of be our Focus for the year I said oh wow they do the same thing we do and uh he said the word that the lord gave me this year was Perfection I said hey I like that brother you know and I began to just kind of ponder that and thank God and say okay I might have to hold on to that just for a little bit and as I was waiting then I got a little text that came through and uh brother Josue didn't realize that what he had done but he sent out a text to the brothers in our group chat and he he found himself a man at a uh at a junction come on somebody amen he says I'm here at the junction and uh and I began to think about how we talked about that a few years ago that we were we were at a junction amen when the Ministries were merged and we were at a junction glory to God and I believe we've done very well through that merging amen we were at a junction and brother brother brother Josue said you know at the junction what I recognize here is before I can enter the junction I have to yield that's right amen I said hey that's a good word right there yielding so what the Lord just kind of put in my spirit amen for this year and this is the title of the sermon yielding to the perfect will of God yielding to the perfect will of God amen hallelujah amen and and yield means to give the right away Hallelujah somebody amen and I want to encourage us as a church give God the right away in your life amen yield to uh to to what is per what is perfect will and what his perfect plan is for your life yield means to give the right away uh to others in traffic another thing that yield means cease to argue about it you mean stop arguing amen give that thing to God Hallelujah the Bible actually tells us that that uh where there is no wood the fire stops we gonna have to learn how to yield how how to take the time how to take the heat out of the fire you'll cease to argue about amen another thing yield means is the relinquish possession of so that thing that you wrote down you have to relinquish to God relinquish possession of give up something when you're yielding to his perfect will you are giving up something you're giving up your will you're giving up your way you're giving up your thoughts you're giving up your ideas you're giving up everything to follow Christ relinquished possession of or give up something amen and another thing yield is because when you when you finally give up something you just turn it all over to Jesus the other thing yield is it it it it provides interests on your investment and the greatest investment you can ever make is giving your everything to the Lord Jesus see some of y'all amen that yielding might just simply mean uh being more active in service just coming on Wednesday night amen that that might be what your yield is for this year there is something that you can do to draw closer to the Lord Jesus Hallelujah all right here I want to just kind of catch a a a a a quote out a resume of the ages and just bear with me Hallelujah I I am I'm just thanking God yielding to the perfect will of God you know there's uh uh let me let me let me let me just uh put this in here before I go to that quote uh before this ministry started I I had to come to a place where I yielded I had to give God I had to Just Surrender my all to the Lord and recently you know a brother was asking him say brother um tell me about your calling to the Lord you know when the Lord called you to preach I said well brother you know I had seven different events happen in my life that uh showed me that God was calling me to this seven different times something happened to me I said brother take me a good while to kind of explain all seven I'm saying but let me just pick out one or two and I'll share them with you and and this morning I'm gonna share one with you some of y'all most of you all already know it but I'll just share it with you anyway uh one was when I when I was going for my Master's Degree when I walked into the classroom um you know to to do a business class and and we had a three-week class at that time so I walked into the classroom and and uh on the third week that the teachers giving us assignment that we all have to come and present for five minutes in front of the class and uh we got to talk talk about this you know some business and things that nature says okay so I got myself ready and I was just as nervous as I know I don't know what to get up there and standing for them people so the teacher asked the question says um he says look it's time for a break and uh I know that everybody got to give their five minute presentation says do y'all want to do it now do you want to do it later and I yelled that I said let's do it later let's do it later later later and the rest of the class said no we want to do it now I said oh Lord have mercy this is going to be rough so uh so everybody took their time and got up there and did their five minute presentation I did mine I sat back down and somebody else come up did there's a sat back down and then the teacher says um you know uh well you know if y'all want me to I can give y'all feedback now or I can do later I said later later after lunch you can give us feedback after lunch the rest of the class say no we want our feedback now now my teacher just so happened to be a retired preacher a Lutheran preacher and uh when he said it retired Lutheran preach I'm saying oh Lord how did I end up in this class you know so so you know I'm there he says okay well everybody want their feet back now so I'm going to give it now and uh and and and when he stood up he says uh so-and-so you know you need to do this when you stand up and speak and so and so you need to do that and and this other one you need to do that and I said I said and then he said Jack I said oh Lord here it comes here comes and he says Jack you are natural I said what he said says Jack your natural says just uh it just flows out of you I said I would just so I was so nervous I didn't feel like it was flowing I didn't feel like I'm I feel like I'm a failure he says no Jack you're a natural I said well wow so I went on to to my break and I'm sitting there pondering with this man standing like this is I never I never expected that so while I'm sitting on break one of those other students two of the other students in class one guy hey man he was a a a military captain and I think in the um the Marines and he says uh he says Jack his name was Captain Carr it says Jack I said uh yes sir he says uh anybody ever tell you that you sound like a reverend I said uh I said no I'm just up here talking business don't don't you know don't don't don't you know just just no don't don't go there he said well you you know I just want to just ask anybody ever tell you you sound like that I said nah so after I tried to get him to calm down another girl piped up she said she said yeah while you was up there talking I ain't know whether to say Amen or what I say I'm here in business school talking business they say I ain't nowhere to say Amen or what I say well hey I appreciate that y'all thank y'all very much so he says Jack I say yes yes sir how can I help you he said how old are you sir I said uh I'm I'm 33. I'm 33. it says okay and it said uh Jack I said hey Mr Mr Mr Carr yes what and I'm on my break and this man is doing this to me except he said he said Jack how old was Jesus when he died I said he was 33. and at that moment I had to give up some things because I knew it was not just Mr Carr talking to me anymore I knew that actually on that day there were three Witnesses I didn't even catch that to now but that preach I mean that that former preacher that was my teacher Mr Carr and the other young lady by the name of Diane all of them made these comments at the same time about me I knew I had to yield I had to give up something and let me taste that I'm so glad I yielded it because there's a return on the investment Hallelujah and I'm telling you this morning if you were yield to the perfect will of God there will be a return on your investment Hallelujah to the Lamb of God let me read this out of the resume of the ages it says I sincerely believe that the spirit of God has been speaking to us not only teaching us the the truths of the ages but he's been Faithfully dealing with hearts that they may turn to him that is the reason for all the preaching and teaching for it it is in the preaching and teaching of the word that the sheep hear the voice of God and follow him look at this not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me or join my church or start some fellowship and organization I have never done that and will not do that now I have no interest in those things but I do have an interest in the things of God and people and if I can accomplish just one thing I'll be Satisfied hey man it says that one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and Men where men become New Creations in Christ filled with his spirit and live according to his word since I would invite my God plead and warned all to hear his voice at this time and listen to this and yield your lives completely to him even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to him God bless you and may his coming Rejoice your heart I want to encourage us I want to plead with the church yield to the perfect will of God he'll stop fighting with God stop arguing with God yield to God God I'm not worthy and God I'm not this God knows you he made you and he has allowed certain things to happen in your life for a reason and let me tell you he is gonna get Glory out of everything he allowed to happen to you but he wants you to just heal give up something give up your ideas give up your Ambitions give up your thoughts give it all up Hallelujah yield to the perfect will of God I was reminded amen just a few years ago how as we were just yielding to the spirit of the Lord in our church we start we start seeing gifts manifested here and the devil didn't like it and and I'm gonna tell you there was gifts coming in not just and and um tongues and interpretations but dreams were coming out of everywhere people were in a position where they could hear from God hallelujah amen but it seemed like you know um uh you know it's just that they as as things begin to change you wanted to do we start slipping and getting further away from God or are we drawing closer to the more God speaks to us and through us we ought to want to draw closer to him we want to get sin out of our life amen anything in my life that is not pleasing to you I want to get rid of that Hallelujah glory to God Amen I was just reading an article here you know and they were saying 10 sins that happened online that the church has become comfortable with and I'm gonna have to bring that because I don't have them all but you know one of them when we post you know we brag we boast when we post and boasting is not a not not a a a something that Christians supposed to do but we boast when we post right amen I mean I I I I put that quote out there for the brothers I was in you know reading in my my daily devotions and you know and if just um Brother Brad I'm talking about this brother how he they asked him if they could put his daughter's picture on some type of little box and then the brother said that's an insult to me to have you ask me to put my daughter's picture on that box you know I don't want people looking at her like that but look at everybody of their selfies today praise the Lord somebody right I mean you know and we we promote ourselves so much hey hallelujah amen a gift supposed to make room for itself hello somebody that's biblical principles we've gotten away from a lot of these things and it's just become acceptable but according to God it might not be acceptable I'm gonna tell y'all another thing that the lord lord lord shared with me amen he says sometimes when people saying Amen in church it is a mental amen it's a mental amen and what a mental amen is that I'm gonna just say that so you stop talking I'ma just give you Amen on that but some amens come from the heart when people really agree with the word of God that amen will change you that it may not change your situation that's the type of Amen had a right hand which he said that's nothing but the truth man that struck God let your amen strike God and let your amens change you this year Hallelujah here you know we got to look at some things and I'm gonna tell you one one other things that's in my heart we're going to get practical this year we're going to do a lot of practical things and I'm gonna go back and get some of that you know that I read I want to share with you because we got the we got to do checkup we drawing closer closer to the coming we're not getting further from the coming or we're getting closer to the coming of the Lord I was thinking about all the gifts and everything flowing through the church and you know with a church with all the word that we have we ought to see a living Jesus in our midst sick is not supposed to come to the church and be comfortable disease not supposed to come to the church and be comfortable you know when you go to a hospital you're expecting to do something about it I'm not here visiting I'm here with a issue and people come to church with issues and the church has got to rise up and accept responsibility somebody need to learn how to be more sensitive to God can speak to us and speak through us oh my God I was just looking at something here you know um and I won't read this uh maybe I you can pull this up but um get down to paragraph right at paragraph 22 and pull up that quote the Messiah don't pull it up on the screen but on your on your screen just pull it up brother Brandon just talking about this in this message of Messiah let's talk about how over in England there was a time that they they they said they they uh they turned the Heelers loose in the hospitals they turned the healers loose what what that meant is that they realized they couldn't do nothing with the sickness the doctors were just at their wits in but they knew God was God and they they turned their healers loose my God Amen I wonder would they be able to call you up we need the healers to come we need somebody to pray for the sick to to show up here at the hospital somebody believed God because we can't do nothing with this and they turn the healers loose oh my goodness Lord can you can you have confidence in us that we can be the healers for this day oh my God Amen here in in in this in this message uh it says um they find that there is a ray of light they had this man you know that that laid hands on the sick and they said a red light passed through the man they picked it up so they find that there was a red light when this man sincerely not knowing they would well uh knowing they were doing it put his hand upon a man and prayed an Earnest prayer they was putting the X-ray down and found out a light coming from his ham God knew what he had talked about when he said lay hands on the sick and they shall recover he knows what he was speaking of oh I want to see the church press into that place where it can come like God wants it to be I'm saying that for this year I want to see the church press I'm at I'm right above paragraph 22. I want to see the church press into that place where it can come like God wants it to be it says then when God was made flesh and became the Messiah then if we can yield ourselves to be the anointed like he was we become Messiahs little lights that's what the church is supposed to be lights little anointed ones that's God's Church his standing light is the lighter Messiah raised in Christ and his people the anointed ones caring forth his light all the church ages sometimes it almost goes completely out then it comes back again God's anointed when God's Messiah church if Messiah means the anointed ones it means king and then if the church is Anointed by the Messiah Spirit it becomes a lesser but still a messiah because it has his light reflecting his power reflecting his glory reflecting his Dominion so it is Messiah oh how it reflects him in his kingdom in his domain I like that and uh you know this is what I want us to yield yield to a spot where God could actually use this the way that he uh the way that he promised in Scripture they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover now you got to have a life to do that you got to have a life to do that you got to be following the word of God you got to be you got to be yielded a man yielding to the perfect will of God let's go back and look at this scripture Romans 12. I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy accept one to God which is your reasonable service I'm begging of your church just present your present your your body's a Living Sacrifice holy and we're going to get into that in our in our Wednesday night teachers Holiness is not just a man the way you dress that is part of it but it's not stopping at the way you dress your attitude got to be holy amen amen uh you you you you uh you you as husbands and wives you committing a man um you're committing to not uh live some ungodly life with somebody else outside of your spouse that's a holy life for the young people not to get involved in fornication that is a holy life praise God to amen avoid looking at pornography pornography on the internet that is a holy life come on somebody holding this ghost so many areas of our life stop stealing from your your boss that's a holy life you can steal time on the job that's a holy life that God is calling for you come on somebody amen present your bodies of Living Sacrifice holy accept unto God which is your reasonable service and I like this and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove uh what is good and acceptable and perfect will of God and as I was just looking at amen some of those words renewing when it says be be transformed by the renewing of your mind that means amen a renovation glory to God it's a renovation and at the beginning year we need to be renovated y'all we all watch them shows amen where people gonna try to decide whether they're gonna buy a new house or renovate amen and oftentimes when they renovate my that the renovations look better than buying a new house amen but it's the same address it's the same house it's just been changed on the inside hello somebody amen you at the same address you the same house but you need to be changed on the inside renewed renovated glory to God Amen renewing me to renovate completely change for the better see I told you we ready for some improvements amen I myself am ready for improvement I know I can be a better Pastor I know I can be a better Christian I know I can be a better father I know I can be a better husband I can be better and you can too good means upright and honorable amen so it says transformed about an anointing amount that you may prove what is that good means to be upright and honorable in everything that you do amen acceptable means to be well pleasing glory to God and I like this he says be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good amen which is upright and honorable and acceptable which means well pleasing and it says and then uh imperfect will of God perfect means full grown mature and you you can't tell me spiritually we can't we're not in a place where we can mature see this is why we gotta yield to the perfect will of God and let me tell you something each each person in here got God's got a perfect will for each life in here but you have to yield to what God has for you praise the Lord what he got for you might not be for your neighbor but you got to yield to what God has for you yield to the perfect will of God I want to pick up a quote out of the power of transformation amen you know even on on Friday night we were listening to the tape and you know you got to be you got to be able to hear God's voice you know when you when you're sitting there and uh you know we're listening and brother branham's you know preaching there on uh the seated discrepancy and then towards the end they start uh going through that prayer line and as as he's going through the prayer line and the lady walks up he says oh you got a request I know what you request is ma'am okay I see it and now you gotta understand when brother branham's in that prayer line in order for him to see what the spirit wants to show him he has to learn how to oh he has a yield he has to get quiet before God he he can't have a lot of distractions y'all gonna have to get these distractions out of your life amen get get quiet before God so God can speak to you come on somebody we this is what yielding is all about what Lord what can I give up this year that will Draw Me Closer to You right but he's he's daring it's just yielded and you can see the return on the investment after the prophet yields he said I see what you hear for sister you're here for you know you want a baby and that's a wonderful request and as brother Brandon starts saying I said hey something just struck me and I say oh I just began to think about uh brother Stephen and sister Rachel I say Lord give them that that that request they're not there to go through the prayer line but Lord I believe you're the same God and you hear their request come on somebody man then he started talking about a way with child glory to God and how somebody was in line for a way with child I start thinking about brother Nehemiah glory to God then I stop thinking about my own daughter then I stopped thinking about some of your kids I say Lord give us all our kids if they got their requests granted What About Us what about us he's the same God Hallelujah we want to be sensitive to the voice of God we want to be sensitive to the spirit of God what you read in your Bible that's what your life's supposed to look like you're gonna have to yield some of your time so you can get back in the word of God Hallelujah you got that you got to find time in your schedule to get God back in the picture at the beginning of the year yield yield the power of transformation The Prophet says this to be Transformers to be changed and made something different so it's like a tadpole it's transformed from a tadpole to a frog see once he looked like a catfish he swims around he's got a head and it's telling everything looks uh just like a catfish then after a while he begins to lose loses the tail he's transformed from one specie to another transform that but it's the same animal now but it's just transformed we need to go through this process of transformation amen he says I think that's what Paul must have had in mind when it's that be ye transformed by the renewing let's see let me get that right be not conformed you know what conform this be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind the prophet says renewing of your mind the things that you once thought upon praise God to be precious the things you thought were precious amen laid that aside and be transformed to something else hallelujah what you was one time to what you are now see amen Lord God we know where God brought us from and someone start to head back in the direction that God brought us from it's the truth anyhow amen be renewed Amen in your mind yield to God give up something amen that would cause you to draw closer to Christ all right look at this he says oh that's what we all want to know how to do it where we are here we love him he saved us now we want to know what to do and we're trying to take a little step this morning to raise up just a little bit higher sometimes we have to hit things you just hold off a few to to till we see what it comes out to be now I like they says we got to know how to do it and now there was a quote that I that I have here amen and I was saving it for later but I think this would be a perfect place to put it this is in the in the sermon how can I overcome we need to know how to do it how do I heal God how do I do that brother Branham brings us something here Amen in the message how can I overcome Hallelujah amen and and every mother every Father Here ought to be able to identify with this one right here he says just like putting a little baby's arm in a sleeve hold you see you want to know how to yield he says it's just like putting a baby's arm in a sleeve hole you see he just up down over everything else and if you ever try to give like a jacket or something to a baby and put this on I'm talking about a little baby little baby that they ain't got no no no no no no no control over his muscles yet I mean that that jacket the hand just be flailing and they just can't never seem to get that their hand right through that it just and eventually they get tired they'll just wear that thing draped over them Hallelujah somebody glory to God I mean they they tired they can't they can't figure out how to do it I've been trying I can't get my hand in the jacket I know I need my hand in that jacket but I don't know how to put my hand in a jacket Hallelujah brother random says he can't do it the little arm is up and down and around it it takes your Steady Hand glory to God and some of you just grabbed the baby's arm and then you wrap that around the arm and then you go to the other side grab the other arm and then you wrap that around now they're ready to go outside glory to God brother random say oh how glad I am I can just yield my hand to the father amen say Lord Jesus I can't get it in there amen you help me put the coat on me I quit trying and just let him do it how many things you tried last year that didn't work out now it's time to let him do it Glory yield to the word of God yield to the will of God yield to the ways of God yield to God he says if the little baby keeps trying oh I can't do it I can do it I can do it I can do it he says and he's just everywhere he can't do it neither can you neither can I but if we'll just hold still and let him do it just yield to him it says here Lord here I am just let me be nothing I yield put my hand in the right place that's the victory that's the overcoming the thing you have to the thing you have to overcome is oh my God your mama not the problem your daddy not the problem your husband not the problem your wife not the problem your children not the problem your biggest problem is you the thing you have to overcome is yourself your idea your thing and surrender yourself to him he overcome for you he knows the way we don't see how that goes right with brother Smiley's sermon from last week he said we we're going away we never went before it says but keep the word in sight see he knows the way we don't but yield yield to him don't try to leave him let him lead you here you know I want to just kind of uh uh yes okay there is uh what we call the permissive will of God and there's also the perfect will of God and for me this year I am more interested in Walking In God's perfect will for my life I believe we are we can all evaluate areas in our life where we're not walking in God's perfect will and that's why I say hey write down lord what can I give up this year so I can draw closer to you and I'm gonna tell you next year if the Lord Terry we're gonna have a you write it down again Lord what can I give up this year that would draw me closer to you we're getting closer to the coming of Lord not further away closer we want to be more like him we're going to be magnetized to him we got to be made of the same material we got to have the same thoughts we got to have the same ideas we got to be on the same page come on somebody amen hallelujah we're not coming here just to go through the motions I want to get ready for a rapture there's many things that we may have to give up and and it should be easy because a lot of stuff that we do we're not going to be doing in heaven amen stuff we doing now a lot of things we're not going to be doing to Heaven Ain't gonna be no social media in heaven ain't gonna be no social media it's not gonna be there amen glory to God you you might have to yield YouTube [Music] first time you might have to yell YouTube because you know YouTube Just swallow you up so I mean and they they call it binging the next day you're gonna spend hours and you wonder what happened I'm supposed to pray you ain't prayed and now you got this five minute prayer that you want to give God yield yield yield yield you're gonna have to say no to YouTube know the Netflix praise the Lord amen Church glory to God Amen we got to yield we got to give up something get closer to God amen here's some examples of of perfect and permissive will Cain knew the perfect will of God when it came to the offering you know how he knew it because God told him exactly what to offer but Cain rejected that and and actually I said like this Cain refused to yield to what God told him to offer Hallelujah it was a perfect will for Sarah to have the promised son but God permitted Hagar but the perfect will of Sarah always the perfect will with Sarah look and we we can't we can't we can't be like Sarah were we suggesting things to God pause for a second who are you to suggest to God what he should do did you make him or did he make you all right hello somebody right we don't suggest to God we yield Israel rejected Grace and cried out for law amen and that that when they cried out for law that was not God's perfect will for them to have he wanted them to have Grace but they cried for law another thing Israel did they wanted a king to rule over them rather than following God's perfect will of speaking through a prophet and letting that Prophet lead them they rejected God's plans and God's ways for for for for for their uh uh just just for the leadership of their Nation amen another thing that that that you know just in my studying our birth you all born a man and uh born in this earth your very birth came through the permissive will of God hello somebody your birth was permitted by God Amen but it was not the perfect will of God for us to come through that sexual act hallelujah amen we could have come through a spoken word amen but your birth was a permissive wheel and you know what with that verse when we're in the permissive will of God we see all the negative things that come along with the permissive will look at all the sickness look at all the disease look at all the death our kids can't go to school anymore you all heard it this week a six-year-old go to go to school with a gun how did a six-year-old get a get a hold of a gun that's right a teacher six years old life has they don't they'll never even see life what a shame we need to yield to the perfect will of God here you know our birth should have been by the spoken word that's how Jesus came but God permitted our births to come through the sexual act another another uh example Jonah was completely out of the perfect will of God as he was traveling to tarshish rather than going to Nineveh I got this scripture here in Jonah 1 12 and and I'm gonna read this for you here really quick Jonah even though he was out of perfect will of God God God allowed that permissible will to work to his perfect will and I'm gonna tell you sometimes we've been in the permissive will and God will turn that person that permissible to work to his perfect will but let me tell you stop if you stop fighting with God stop struggling with God it'll be much easier on you Jonah did his own thing John knew he was in trouble not only he knew he was trouble everybody on the boat knew they was in trouble and they could not figure out now this this this don't make no sense I believe those men that studied the seeds they knew that uh a storm probably shouldn't even been out there and this is why they start responding where they was like wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute this is not the time of year for this why is this happening somebody on this something on this boat that they should not have done everybody start confessing Journal finally jumped up and said you know I know you know you know why a lot of stuff going wrong in your life because you out of the wheel you added a perfect will and when you get yourself aligned with the perfect will of God you'll see other things line up in your life hello somebody get back in line with the perfect will of God Hallelujah here Jonah when they came to Jonah they asked him here in Jonah 1 12. they say now what did you do what's going on why is the storm say say look you know I did this I did that I can I confessed that I did it it said why did you do that why are you running from God why are you doing that so tell you what you'll tell y'all what y'all do take me up cast me forth into the sea so shall the sea be calm unto you if I know that for my sake this great Tempest is upon you now here Jonathan thought I said well I still ain't gonna get God's will accomplished because I'm a drown in this sea well then how God think God prepared a fish if the fish was already created the fish was growing for years to be big enough to swallow Jonah not only not only growing on all those years I don't know where that fish was but somehow the fish found this way in the ocean to get the right where Jonah was to be cast out of a boat and be there to swallow him predestination God allows for his his that that permissive will to always work out to his perfect will and God caused a fish since he couldn't go by boats he calls a fish to take Jonah right to Nineveh and you know the other beautiful partners that they worship the fish God in Nineveh so when Jonah comes walking out Amen on the tongue of a fish they knew they had to hear God but if Jonah would have just submitted himself to the perfect will of God he would have never found himself in the belly of a well are you in Wells belly today because of your disobedience are you in Wales belly is your business in Wales belly is your family in Wales belly I'ma tell you something about God if you are in Wells belly he'll bring you out but you gotta surrender to the perfect will of God yield to the perfect will of God is another one that I got Balaam Balaam Balaam knew the perfect will of God and that perfect will of God got it out I told him do not go with balak I don't care how much money they offer you I don't care if nothing but don't do not go with balac you stay right here and he he you know they send back one group say no Balaam said he not come say he so balakcept sends somebody a little bit more important than y'all go down there off a little bit more go pray he go pray God said no don't go down there and they say he says uh uh they start off from all these things say well you know okay I I I'll go and God God told you now you go I'm gonna permit you to go but you better only say what I tell you to say you get down there and on his way the reason he found out he was in the permissible of God what happened he the donkey that he's riding sees the angel of the Lord sometime because we we so far out of the will of God we can't see God we can't hear God we can't feel God but a donkey had to tell him and can you imagine a man he got so mad he hit the donkey crazy donkey out you know I'm trying to go here and then the donkey just start talking it's just for me I don't have any more um pets at the house amen but if I had a pet that started talking to me that would that would say something that I'm I'm something right here I need to turn around and go back to where I I I left but for him he hear the donkey talking still want to pursue it oh my God God got a donkey talking to y'all this morning yield to the perfect will of God Balaam was out of out of the perfect will of God God turned it to uh to work so he was in the permissible but God worked it to the perfect will hearing this message the Sheep the seed shall not be able to shut brother random makes a statement it says now you see from as I said last night any move from that original plan of God throws the whole thing out of cater any move from the original plan of God throws a whole thing out of cater we can't move from that original word since we talked on it last last evening or the evening before last rather on Balaam he he got God's answer he got God's answer right I mean straight and clear don't go but he has a permissive will and you can work in that if you wish to and God will make it honor him but it's still but still it's not God's perfect will and that's what we should strive for his perfect will not his permissive will the kingdom of God which he is in the Earth today can never be set up justly this is important to me the kingdom of God which he is in the Earth today that Kingdom can never be set up justly on the permissive wheel God can't accomplish the work that he wants to do in our life if we're going to continue to operate permissive will some important time we got to yield we got to stop doing what we're doing and we got to yield to God's perfect will for our lives it's got to come back to its perfect will I was um looking at something here that just kind of blessed me and I I I'll I'll share this maybe I'll just share a couple more things and then we'll come to a close uh one time brother Brandon went overseas to meetings and he says you know the uh if you ever want to get yourself all tangled up just get amongst a bunch of preachers that's how you get tangled up and um and as he was over there it says the Lord had told him before he went and says be careful there's a trap set for you and and Africa there's a trap set for you there's a trap set and he's like oh my so he was expecting the trap to be some type of witch doctor or something like that he didn't realize the Trap was going to come from Ministry he didn't realize that so uh as he was over there he says uh Brothers the Lord just told me we're not supposed to take this little the way that y'all got the meeting set up the Lord said we're not supposed to do that he said we're supposed to go back this way and do this do that and they said no no no no no no no God told us to do it this way we got it all set up they said no God telling me not to do that we need to go back over here God showed me in a vision not to do that brothers and so it's it's they say so one of the brothers yeah hyped up it says uh um you're the only one God speak to he looked at the brother they say they thought the same thing one day when he tried Moses like that he says I'm telling y'all in the name of the Lord we are going in the wrong direction and we're going to pay for it if we do this it says he took some leaves down off the tree and start throwing them at the brother's feet thus saith the Lord we honor the will of God thus said the Lord we out of the will of God and as they they looked at us and and and only a son and one of the other brothers were standing there with him say brother Brandon we'll go back to the States if you want to go back he's like no we'll go but I'm just telling our brothers we're out of the will of God things you know so they went down to meeting all these peoples gathered and out of nowhere storm just came shut the meeting down nobody could get out of their car and go to the meeting shut the meat now say we're going to get back together next night next night they went say out of nowhere uh it start freezing and the people can get out because it's too cold they won't even prepare for God was showing them they were out of the perfect will of God let me tell you something sometimes storms come up in your life to show you that you're out of the will of God you're out of place and all God wants you to do is get back in line so that he can bless you oh help me somebody brother Brandon say you know he says Brothers we're out of the will of God I know God showed me this and then he said he went and he's praying throughout through the nine and him and the son praying and says God said you know I'm Gonna Let You Go at these brothers he says but I'm letting you know right now this is not my perfect will he said y'all not gonna be blessed he says but uh he says I'm Gonna Let You Go with him he says but you're gonna pay for this decision and just through eating and drinking some kind of way he got an amoeba into his into into a system and end up off the field for eight months because he didn't follow the perfect will of God don't you know you suffer you suffer when you don't follow the perfect will of God I want to encourage this church at the beginning of the year heal give up stop pause give God the right away follow his perfect will I was thinking on this and there's a a statement here and I want to read this about brother Billy Billy Paul we all uh those you know many of us know the message pretty well we know that Brother Joseph Branham has a tremendous he has a gift you know a prophetic anointing on his life and and don't let nobody tell you that they don't have he does have it it just has to be placed right in the scripture and the way I place it the five full ministry said that God gave unto the church pastors prophets evangelists teachers preachers I mean he gave that uh Apostles he gave that to the church so I see brother Joseph's ministry right in that amen not not somebody to take brother Brown's place no preacher do that because it's not scripture but it's certainly within the fivefold ministry amen but um brother Brandon made a statement about Billy Paul that just blessed me it's hearing the message Jairus and Divine Healing he says there's good evening friends it's indeed a pleasure to be here tonight and a privilege I thank you for your thoughts of the boy my son he's just a lad he's been going through now for a little while the managers in Canada Mr Baxter and so I hardly know uh how I would it'd be hard for me to get along without him right now so it's kind of in my right hand man he's but being just a kid and you all and you you always respect for him I certainly appreciate that he says and I hope someday that God makes a minister out of him and if he would only give a complete yield to God of course he's just a kid he's an adolescent age but Billy if he will yield to God look at this if he will yield to God his ministry will exceed mine brother Branham said this about his son that if if Billy would have yielded to God his ministry would exceeded his fathers if he would yield to God his ministry would exceed mine so bad till so far it won't be even it won't even be in the picture Billy is going to be a very spiritual boy and the spirit of the Lord is near him for instance we'll be riding down the road on a place we've never seen before he's talking to me the other day he said Daddy he said I see we're going to make a turn after a while and there's a red barn and there'll be a cow standing over here and some chicken standing around beside it'll it'll be just there don't just don't worry it'll be just there he see and it's so near him the same thing if he just yield to it and then we'll go a little further and I'll say now watch Paul if you see it's the same I'm telling you uh I said now we're going to we're going to be a man uh you be ready to catch your breaks cause there's a man gonna come around the corner and the next city and the man's gonna be dressed in a certain way like that and there and there he will be just like and he will say well now daddy that I see that too he said but I don't know what to do I just want y'all to catch this Billy in the car with his daddy and I mean his daddy you know being a prophet got all kind of visions that he see we're gonna see this we're gonna see that we're gonna see this and the fellowship in this car y'all not catching it yet the fellowship in this car is the Dr is the passenger can say well I see this I see that I see this I see that and it's gonna be just that way oh that's what you see well I see and everything that they saw God would can you imagine the level of Fellowship in that car see if I was riding with the prophet it'd be like oh my oh but I I don't know and I just wondered myself you know was was it because brother Billy was around it so much that God elevated him to be able to see because if that's the case we've been in this so much we've been around this so much for years after years that we should be elevated to a spot now where we can see some things but in order for you to see something we got to yield I don't know what to do I said just follow what the Lord says see gifts and columns are without repentance that's right and of course be thousands of things happen we've never I never even mentioned it he just tells me certain things and I just go ahead that's all right I'm thankful and just don't tell it to the people you don't have to unless it's going to do somebody some good or help somebody if it isn't going to help anyone it doesn't do any good anyhow does it just maybe for our own our own benefit and there's many things he lets happen that he never tells me nothing about it just lets me go right on in and I don't know nothing about it until it's done happen he just tells me what he wants to and what he doesn't want to he doesn't have to that's the way God does brother random saying brother Billy Paul could have had a really really powerful Ministry and we all know he went through some things in his life especially this marriage and all of that he uh he ended up in a situation where he married a girl that he wants he ran out married and brother Randall said no you want you were supposed to do that they had to knowledge so that causes divorce and that that that that caused him to be taken out of the ministry but if he would have yield it to God where would his ministry be now we all know also by scripture that his ministry couldn't have been no greater than his dad but as far as the Supernatural still happening the way it was happening we would still see it we still have fresh testimonies if a man in his teenage years oh y'all gotta get that if a man in his teenage years would have yielded to God this generation would have been far more blessed can I tell you something I'm not just going to just put that on brother Billy Paul I'm putting that in your lap today if you would just learn how to yield to God how much further would our church be on the road yielding to the perfect will of God each one of you wrote something down on your list today and and I'm trusting that you'll be sincere with God that you will uh take that before him in prayer Lord what what can I what can I give up that will help me draw closer to you what can I give up this year I'm not talking about next year this year what can I give up that will Draw Me Closer to You here this last quote and does God ever change his mind about his word the prophet says it is best to have God's will that's what he taught us thy will be done thy kingdom come thine will be done we must submit ourselves to his will and his word don't question it believe it don't try to find a way around it just take it the way it is so many wants to go around get some other way and when you do you find yourself going on and you find God blessing you but you're working in his permissive will see that's that's another that's another tricky thing right there you can actually get blessings in the permissive will and still not being the perfect will amen right we don't want blessings in the permissive will we want the perfect will blessings look at what he says he says you find yourself going on you find God blessing you but you're working in his permissive will and not in this perfect Divine will he permits it as I've said but he will not he will not let it be his perfect will so you can't make you can't make God's permissive will become his perfect will he'll bless you for it but you're going to pay for some things too along the way I want to look at this he says he permits it my but you're working in his permissible and not in this perfect perfect Divine will he permits it as I said but he will not let it be his perfect will but he'll make it work to honor and bless his perfect will and childbearing by sex is one of that that's uh our birth is a part of God's permissive will he's blessed it but mind if we were to come to perfect will how much more could he have done for us and even in this as we're approaching this next year uh this year amen if we would just yield this perfect will how much more can he do for us how much more we see the gifts of God manifested in our midst how much more will God give dreams how much more will God speak to his people how much more will God heal the sick how much more will God raise the debt how much more will God do in our midst if all of us would just learn to yield husbands got to give wives got to yield children have to heal a pastor has the yield we all have to learn how to yield yield and to give God the right of way Lord I'm not holding on to this I don't need this this thing this thing this ain't gonna take me into no Rapture let me let this thing go and notice what notice what Paul said lay aside every sin and every week that's so easy to beset you that means you got to give it up not God come take it from you but you lay it aside God I'm giving it up Lord I'm giving it up this year is going to be a different year I want to draw closer to you I don't want to get further away from you and I'm starting off right now Lord I'm yielding let's pray father Heaven has spoken and we know it's nothing but happiness your voice that speaks Lord each one of us receive in a different way because we're at different stages in our life but Lord I believe that you have uh challenged us and this will be a year God where we will we will yield yield to your perfect will we don't want to walk in the permissive will of God we've done that and we haven't received the full blessings but today Lord we want to surrender we want to we want to give up we want to what we want we want the we want you to take the the Searchlight search our hearts God anything in there that is that that is not pleasing to you because we want to live lives that are acceptable pleasing if it's not pleasing to your Lord let the light shine on it and Lord that we would be willing to uh surrender it you mean more to us than anything and we got to prove that Lord through our actions demonstrated through the lies that we believe that you mean more to us than anything thank you that you care so much about us that you would speak to us words like this we we we we surrender Lord I want to be I want a way better pastor past I want to be a better Christian I want to be a better husband I want to be a better uh father I want
