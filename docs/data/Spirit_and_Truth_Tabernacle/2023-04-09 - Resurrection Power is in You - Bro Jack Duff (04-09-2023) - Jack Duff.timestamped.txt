[36:23] like I'm coming this morning
[36:26] praise the Lord but I'm still fighting
[36:28] the enemy
[36:29] amen John 14
[36:32] um uh verse 19 through 21.
[36:37] it says
[36:40] um
[36:43] it says uh yet a little while
[36:48] and the world seeth me no more but ye
[36:51] will see me
[36:53] because I live ye shall live also
[36:56] because I live
[36:59] ye shall live also

[37:07] this was a a statement that the Lord
[37:10] Jesus was making to his bride because I

[37:18] at that day
[37:21] you shall know that I am in my father
[37:24] and ye and me
[37:27] and I in you and um and and I think it's
[37:32] very important for us not to keep
[37:34] putting this off to a future day uh when
[37:37] it says at that day ye shall know he was
[37:41] talking about this day
[37:44] this day ye shall know that I am in my
[37:48] father and ye in me and I in you verse
[37:54] 21 says he that hath my Commandments and
[37:59] keepeth them he it is that loveth me and
[38:02] he that loveth me shall be loved of my
[38:05] father and I will love him and will
[38:08] manifest myself to him let's turn also
[38:13] to Romans chapter 8.
[38:16] amen praise the Lord
[38:20] um
[38:21] I tell you I was certainly looking
[38:23] forward to this Easter it's been a
[38:25] couple years since I've been home for
[38:27] yeast and I was glad to be home this
[38:29] time I say you know it's one thing to
[38:31] preacher brought but there's nothing
[38:32] like preaching at home a man on Easter
[38:35] amen so I'm happy to be here this
[38:37] morning uh here Romans 8 and verse 11
[38:40] says but if the spirit
[38:45] of him that raised up Jesus from the
[38:49] dead
[38:50] dwell in you he that raised up uh uh
[38:57] he that raised up Christ from the dead
[38:59] shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by
[39:03] his spirit that dwelleth in you amen
[39:09] Hallelujah Let's uh let us just have a
[39:14] word of prayer father
[39:16] we thank you for the word of God that
[39:19] has been read and uh we trust now that
[39:23] the Holy Ghost would take what has been
[39:26] read
[39:27] and make a present tense father speak to
[39:31] our hearts on this Resurrection Sunday
[39:33] we accept the Holy Ghost but take
[39:36] complete control of of uh each and every
[39:39] person
[39:40] father we know that uh the resurrection
[39:44] is not an event but the resurrection is
[39:48] a person
[39:49] and may the Resurrection show up this
[39:53] morning in the lives of his people God
[39:57] manifest yourself once more prove that
[40:00] you are still
[40:02] amen the same yesterday today and
[40:05] forever so in Jesus name we pray amen
[40:09] amen God bless you can be seated
[40:14] thank you
[40:24] man I'm gonna have to be careful and all
[40:26] kind of things
[40:27] but uh it's all right
[40:29] man we uh
[40:31] we're gonna get through it
[40:33] I just
[40:35] if I could borrow some words from uh I
[40:40] used to be a Baptist a man before I came
[40:43] to the message and the preacher but come
[40:46] up and say I just stopped by to tell you
[40:51] amen I stopped by to tell you that
[40:53] resurrection power is in you
[40:57] amen resurrection power is in you turn
[41:02] around and tell somebody resurrection
[41:04] power
[41:06] is in you
[41:09] blessed be the name of the Lord
[41:11] you see when we come to Easter
[41:17] uh Easter
[41:19] is what separates Christianity from any
[41:23] other religion
[41:25] amen and there are many other religions
[41:27] out there and things that people believe
[41:30] and and sometimes we have questions as
[41:33] to whether they have a portion of Truth
[41:35] and sometimes they do uh but Easter is
[41:39] what separates Christianity from
[41:42] everybody else
[41:43] because Easter is where our leader our
[41:47] Lord and our savior proved that he was
[41:52] who we said he was
[41:55] blessed be the name of the Lord amen
[41:58] Matthew 17 verse 22 and 23 the Bible
[42:02] says in while they Abode in Galilee
[42:06] Jesus said unto them the son of man
[42:09] shall be betrayed into the hands of men
[42:13] and they shall kill him and the third
[42:17] day he shall be raised again and they
[42:21] were exceeding sorry and and maybe they
[42:24] had never understood this type of
[42:26] language uh you know they were sorry
[42:28] because they didn't really hear what he
[42:30] said the the statement before amen the
[42:34] state all they heard was they shall kill
[42:37] him and they were exceeding sorry but
[42:40] they missed the third day he shall be
[42:43] raised again
[42:46] and if they would have cope that and
[42:48] understood that it would have produced a
[42:51] level of excitement
[42:53] Hallelujah somebody amen but Easter is a
[42:57] time where Jesus proved
[42:59] what he said in John chapter 2 verse 19
[43:04] amen the Bible says Jesus answered and
[43:08] said unto them destroy this Temple
[43:12] and in three days I will raise it up and
[43:16] when it got up in three days
[43:19] Jesus proved that Christianity was
[43:23] different from any other religion
[43:27] in John chapter 10 verse 17 through 18
[43:31] the Bible says therefore doth my father
[43:35] love me because I lay down my life
[43:41] and I love this he also says that I
[43:43] might take it again
[43:46] he says no man taketh it from me but I
[43:50] lay it down you got to be willing to be
[43:54] crushed
[43:58] you got to be willing to go through
[44:00] something sometime amen no man taketh it
[44:04] from me but I lay it down of myself and
[44:07] I like this I have power
[44:11] to lay it down come on somebody
[44:15] and I have power to take it again
[44:18] this commandment have I received of my
[44:21] father
[44:22] you see I like this you know because
[44:26] um you know if if he had if he's before
[44:28] his his crucifixion before his death at
[44:32] Calvary he makes this statement that I
[44:34] have power to lay it down
[44:36] and he says I have power to take it up
[44:39] again you know you wonder well if he had
[44:41] power to lay it down and and that power
[44:43] to take it up again uh at what point in
[44:46] time that this power intend to him
[44:48] you see it wasn't it wasn't when he was
[44:51] in the grave that the power came into
[44:52] him
[44:53] the power was in him before he got in
[44:56] the grave
[44:57] and I'm gonna tell you another thing
[44:58] about the power the power was in him
[45:00] before he got in the grave and the power
[45:02] was able to keep him in the grave
[45:06] he exit could come up before three days
[45:08] because he kept saying three days there
[45:10] was power to take him in there was power
[45:13] to keep him in and there was power to
[45:15] get him out that same power is dwelling
[45:18] inside of those that have the Holy Ghost
[45:21] resurrection power is laying inside of
[45:24] you
[45:26] you ain't gonna get this when you die
[45:29] you got it right now
[45:32] I say you got it right now if you're
[45:34] filled with the Holy Ghost you got this
[45:37] same power in you right now
[45:40] resurrection power
[45:43] well that's greater than any power
[45:46] amen let's go back to this quote that
[45:49] brother Smiley used on last week
[45:52] I know I just tell you I I was blessed
[45:55] by the sermon
[45:59] I was you know listening and I say well
[46:01] my it just blessed my heart I love when
[46:03] the church is eating I just like to see
[46:06] y'all eat
[46:07] amen but here he was reading this quote
[46:11] from the message I know and it says uh
[46:14] see it takes a crucifixion
[46:17] it takes a crushing of the flower to
[46:20] bring perfume from it it takes a
[46:22] crushing of a life to get the best out
[46:25] of it that there is
[46:27] that's the reason now that's that's just
[46:29] beautiful in order to get the best
[46:33] out of it
[46:35] it has to go through
[46:37] crush it
[46:40] see you thought you were at your best
[46:42] when you were on the Mountaintop
[46:45] really you at your best when you're in
[46:47] your Valley
[46:50] come on somebody
[46:52] when you and your violin you still gotta
[46:55] Hallelujah from the valley
[46:59] see it means something your holiday your
[47:02] Hallelujah means something when you're
[47:03] walking through a valley
[47:05] hey I can walk like David yay though I
[47:09] walk
[47:11] through the valley of the shadow of
[47:13] death
[47:14] I know he's with me because he promised
[47:18] he would never leave me
[47:20] nor forsake me
[47:23] when I can't feel them
[47:25] I know he's there when I can't see him
[47:29] I know he's there and I trust by faith
[47:33] as I keep walking he'll show up
[47:36] somewhere
[47:38] you gotta be willing to go through the
[47:41] valley
[47:45] it takes a crushing of a life to get the
[47:48] best out of it that there is
[47:51] that's the reason Jesus had to be
[47:54] crushed
[47:55] to bring forth what he was
[47:58] my he said that's the crushing is what
[48:01] separated him from any other religious
[48:04] leader come on Church the the crushing
[48:08] the crucifixion amen that's what's
[48:10] several because he he he not only laid
[48:13] his life down but he picked it up again
[48:15] that's what separates him but we're not
[48:18] just talking about somebody with just
[48:20] some good words no this this is this is
[48:22] a power that goes beyond all of that
[48:26] look at this he says this that's the
[48:29] reason Jesus had to be crushed to bring
[48:30] forth what he was he cannot stand before
[48:33] the he could not stand before the
[48:35] crucifixion say all power and heavens
[48:38] and earth is given unto my hands
[48:41] but after the crucifixion he could stand
[48:43] and say all powers and heavens and earth
[48:45] is given unto my hand but what did it do
[48:48] it taken crucifixion first it taken the
[48:52] crushing and the disappointing of the
[48:55] Apostles they had seen uh their savior
[48:58] the one they love and seen him raise up
[49:02] the Dead from the grave they had seen
[49:04] him do that and then the thing there he
[49:06] lays cold in the grave himself this
[49:08] morning
[49:10] but they didn't realize he needed to go
[49:12] through that I I was just saying I wrote
[49:14] some notes here you know as I was
[49:16] listening to brother Smiley bringing
[49:17] that sermon the first thing I was
[49:19] thinking man I just wish we would have
[49:21] been able to have our own like Easter
[49:23] meeting you know where you had the
[49:25] different ministers going forth that
[49:26] would just been so perfect but God knows
[49:28] all things and uh but but I was I was
[49:31] just really enjoying it and and the
[49:32] thing I like about is that I love a man
[49:35] how we would walk through the personal
[49:37] and applicable aspects of that sermon
[49:41] amen first of all the the personal part
[49:44] is that the Lord Jesus himself had to
[49:47] experience a a crushing at his
[49:49] crucifixion
[49:50] and uh and because of that crushing we
[49:53] can go to Isaiah 53.
[49:57] verse 3 says he is despised and rejected
[50:01] of men
[50:03] come on a Man of Sorrows and acquainted
[50:06] with grief
[50:07] and we head as it were our faces from
[50:10] him he was despised and we esteemed him
[50:13] not
[50:15] verse 4 says surely he has borne our
[50:18] griefs and carried our sorrows amen yet
[50:21] we did esteem him stricken smitten of
[50:24] God and Afflicted this is his crushing
[50:27] but to see it was through the crushing
[50:29] that we got the best part out amen
[50:31] because verse 5 says but he was wounded
[50:35] for our transgressions
[50:38] amen he was bruised
[50:40] for our iniquities he went through it so
[50:43] I don't have to go through it
[50:45] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[50:48] him
[50:49] and with his stripes we are healed
[50:53] and I'm gonna tell you I want to make it
[50:55] a little bit more personal because I
[50:56] know that there was a a captain one time
[50:59] on the ship he was sick and um and he
[51:03] just I mean he was out there couldn't
[51:04] get in hospital anything like that so he
[51:07] had one of the fellas on the ship you
[51:09] know get on he said he says uh Captain I
[51:11] know you you're going through and we
[51:12] don't know if you're gonna make it but
[51:14] let me just read some scripture over you
[51:16] but let me read it to you the way Mama
[51:17] read it to me
[51:19] I know you're familiar with it Captain
[51:21] but you got to read it differently you
[51:23] got to put yourself in there
[51:25] because as he died you died and as he
[51:29] rose you Rose
[51:31] Resurrection Powers inside of you
[51:37] but he was wounded verse 5. for Jack's
[51:41] transgressions
[51:44] he was bruised for Jack's iniquities
[51:49] the chastisement of Jack's piece was
[51:51] upon him
[51:52] and with his stripes
[51:55] Jack is evil
[51:59] hey I can claim it
[52:01] I can claim it because his death not
[52:03] only brought salvation but his death
[52:06] brought healing there's a dual atonement
[52:08] at Calvary
[52:12] brother Smiley brought in on last week
[52:15] how brother Branham himself experienced
[52:17] his crushing
[52:18] in his own life and losing his wife and
[52:20] his daughter
[52:22] but you know it's through things like
[52:23] that that God was able to to bring forth
[52:26] a man a Ministry that impacted all of
[52:29] our lives
[52:30] even brother Smiley brought his own
[52:33] personal testimony amen of just going
[52:36] through a crushing
[52:38] but I tell you after I listened to the
[52:40] sermon last week if if if a crushing is
[52:43] going to produce a word like that
[52:45] then praise God
[52:51] I think it's Moe in there where that
[52:52] came from
[52:54] and I'm looking forward to see what God
[52:56] do it's it's important when you
[52:58] recognize what God has done in your life
[52:59] amen the Bible tells us that all things
[53:02] work together
[53:06] oh I don't know if we heard it
[53:08] and all things work together for the
[53:11] good
[53:12] to them that love God unto them
[53:15] to this purpose
[53:16] and say it's gonna feed good and then
[53:19] say it's gonna be good but it's gonna
[53:21] work together for the good
[53:24] oh we gotta trust him in the valley
[53:27] he also brought amen the the uh the
[53:31] character of job to our amen attention
[53:33] and I just wanted to kind of get a
[53:36] glimpse of him because job is the very
[53:38] first man they got a glimpse of the
[53:40] Resurrection
[53:41] in Job 14 verse 14 job was going through
[53:46] his his uh is his trials and his
[53:49] tribulations his crushing his friends
[53:52] with air accusing him of doing things
[53:54] wrong and he knew that he had done
[53:56] nothing wrong and job was just wondering
[53:59] a lot you know about man I see when a
[54:01] flower die it drops a little seed into
[54:04] the Earth and and that same flower will
[54:06] come back up again it has Perpetual life
[54:08] I can look at the trees amen and they
[54:11] died a certain time of year but you know
[54:14] that tree maybe that leaf might fall off
[54:16] but inside that tree another Leaf will
[54:18] come out in the springtime amen the tree
[54:21] itself might look dead but there's going
[54:23] to be something come forth more fruit
[54:25] will come forth from that tree if it
[54:27] just weathers the storm
[54:29] come on somebody you got to learn to
[54:31] just weather the storm the tree is still
[54:34] planted in the earth it's still got a
[54:37] source
[54:38] it's still got something that can it can
[54:40] it can pull from
[54:43] but you got to be willing to go through
[54:45] that winter season of life
[54:47] I'm so glad that God arranged it and
[54:49] after winter you can look forward to the
[54:52] springtime
[54:54] the resurrection is found in nature but
[54:57] job said this in Job 14 14 as he was
[54:59] wondering about uh life and nature says
[55:02] if a man die
[55:06] if a man died
[55:08] shall he live again
[55:11] this is Job's question
[55:14] now before we get too too fast in that
[55:16] verse you got to think he's he put the
[55:18] question mark there and he's just
[55:19] wondering if a man die he's put it in in
[55:22] on paper if a man thou shall he live
[55:24] again
[55:25] and he's wondering to himself what about
[55:27] a man
[55:29] I'm going through all this I know about
[55:31] a flower and I know about a tree I know
[55:33] about this and you know and I believe uh
[55:35] one place said in the Book of Job job
[55:36] say that that a a dead tree just at the
[55:40] scent of water
[55:42] if it just had a way to smell water that
[55:45] tree would start rising and living again
[55:48] Resurrection would show up in that tree
[55:51] just at the scent of water
[55:54] hallelujah hallelujah amen by but job
[55:57] was wondering these things and and then
[55:59] I believe Revelation struck him he says
[56:02] all the days in my appointed time
[56:05] will I wait I know I might be going
[56:08] through right now but all the days of my
[56:10] important time will I wait till my
[56:13] change comes
[56:15] sometimes when you're in the valley all
[56:17] you got is just one lure one little
[56:19] little something you can hold on to me
[56:21] it might be a song it might be a verse
[56:23] it might be a just a little something
[56:25] you hold on to but just hold on to that
[56:27] I'm gonna tell you that little bit that
[56:29] you're holding on to it's enough to
[56:30] carry you through
[56:34] but job
[56:36] job uh has this question I want to go
[56:39] back to the message I know the second
[56:41] quote here and the message I know
[56:44] it says all these Great Men because job
[56:47] is the first one to see the resurrection
[56:49] he said all these great men that would
[56:51] take much of our morning service away to
[56:54] go into
[56:55] I mentioned that they went through
[56:57] trials and saw God
[56:59] they went through trials and saw angels
[57:02] they went through trials and Revelations
[57:06] and saw signs and wonders and things
[57:08] amen
[57:10] but look at what it says here in the
[57:12] message I know it says but oh none of
[57:14] them saw what job saw
[57:17] all them man after seeing angels and
[57:21] seeing God and all these things they
[57:24] never saw nothing to give them hopes
[57:26] beyond the grave
[57:28] beyond the grave they never saw anything
[57:31] to give them hopes beyond the grave but
[57:35] job saw the resurrection
[57:38] he saw Easter
[57:41] Glory he sought a thing that Comforts
[57:45] every heart
[57:46] then when he did all that my words would
[57:49] be printed in the book oh that they
[57:51] would be engraved with an iron pin in
[57:54] the Rock now what did job see that
[57:57] changed his perspective
[57:59] we find this written in job Chapter 19
[58:02] Verse 22.
[58:04] praise the Lord what did job see
[58:12] why
[58:14] do you persecute me as God
[58:17] and are not satisfied with my flesh
[58:20] oh that my words were now written
[58:23] oh that they were printed in a book
[58:26] that they were graving with the iron pen
[58:29] and led in the rock forever
[58:31] this is where they start for I know
[58:34] come on somebody that my redeemer living
[58:39] and that he shall stand at that Latter
[58:42] day upon the Earth
[58:44] look at this and though after my skin
[58:47] worms destroy this body yet in my flesh
[58:54] shall I see God
[58:56] whom I shall see for myself but my eyes
[58:59] Shall Behold and not another though my
[59:01] Reigns be consumed within me
[59:04] job got a glimpse of the Resurrection
[59:07] when he says you know that I'm going to
[59:09] see I'm going to see my redeemer I know
[59:11] he lives and I'm going to see we're
[59:12] going to stand on the latter day Joe job
[59:15] got a glimpse of Easter
[59:18] how we thank God sometimes we need a
[59:20] really good glimpse of Easter
[59:23] now you know job made a statement there
[59:25] that I want to amen just kind of look at
[59:27] just for a second
[59:29] job said
[59:31] uh though the skin worms
[59:35] destroy this body yet in my flesh shall
[59:38] I see God and and brother Brandon makes
[59:41] this statement that I wanna I wanna I
[59:42] wanna just bring your attention to the
[59:45] skin worm that's gonna destroy you
[59:47] is already in you
[59:51] but it can't activate
[59:54] until a certain time
[59:56] come on somebody he said he said when
[59:59] you land a man in a casket all of a
[1:00:03] sudden the skin worms that was in you
[1:00:04] start to activate
[1:00:07] but if the if the if the skin were
[1:00:10] is also in you right now
[1:00:13] you might not be able to feel it you
[1:00:17] might not be able to see it but the skin
[1:00:18] worm is there inside of you right now
[1:00:21] the skin worm ain't coming
[1:00:24] the skin worm lives in you right now
[1:00:28] come on somebody
[1:00:30] you ain't got to feel it you gotta see
[1:00:33] it operator doing nothing it's laying
[1:00:36] dormant
[1:00:37] but he's still in you
[1:00:39] if the skin worm is in you then
[1:00:42] resurrection power is also inside of you
[1:00:49] sometimes it lays torment but there's a
[1:00:52] promise of that resurrection power that
[1:00:55] even if you died
[1:00:58] you gotta have a power that'll get you
[1:01:00] out the grave
[1:01:01] the same power that raised up Jesus is
[1:01:06] the same power that's living inside of
[1:01:08] you
[1:01:17] brother random makes this statement and
[1:01:19] the message faith
[1:01:23] it says this and and I was I was just
[1:01:26] went back to listen to this this quote I
[1:01:28] mean this discernment it's about a 27
[1:01:31] minute sermon
[1:01:32] and I couldn't believe some of the
[1:01:34] things brother Adam was said in these 27
[1:01:36] minutes
[1:01:36] but he made a statement it says but
[1:01:38] you've got to use faith in God
[1:01:41] to make it work see
[1:01:43] so you got your own Resurrection
[1:01:47] inside of you
[1:01:49] your Resurrection
[1:01:52] lays inside of you and your spirits
[1:01:59] your Resurrection ain't coming
[1:02:01] your Resurrection is here
[1:02:07] that I gotta defeat devils
[1:02:10] because you realize the same power that
[1:02:12] took Jesus to a cross and from across to
[1:02:15] a grave is this internet from a grave to
[1:02:18] the sky that same power is in you that
[1:02:21] have the Holy Ghost
[1:02:24] you don't fear death
[1:02:26] when you know that power is inside of
[1:02:28] you
[1:02:30] here's a couple definitions that I want
[1:02:33] to give
[1:02:34] amen Resurrection is the act of factor
[1:02:38] resurrecting a being
[1:02:41] uh or being resurrected uh also they
[1:02:44] said it's a Christian belief of Christ
[1:02:47] rising from the dead it's also a
[1:02:50] Christian belief that the rising of the
[1:02:52] dead at the last judgment
[1:02:53] uh and also they said a resurrection and
[1:02:57] I like this definition
[1:02:59] it's the revitalization revitalization
[1:03:03] or Revival of something
[1:03:07] so you know when you look at it from
[1:03:10] these different angles it's not just
[1:03:11] necessarily about Christ rising from the
[1:03:14] dead which we believe that's the
[1:03:15] ultimate but sometimes it can just be
[1:03:17] the revitalization or the revive or
[1:03:20] something
[1:03:21] sometimes in your spirit
[1:03:24] you need
[1:03:26] a resurrection
[1:03:29] and Resurrection is not replacement
[1:03:34] see red Resurrection is not replacement
[1:03:36] Resurrection is is if I put this down on
[1:03:40] the ground
[1:03:41] a man to resurrect it is not going to
[1:03:43] get me another bottle of water
[1:03:46] that's replacement
[1:03:47] resurrections get the same one that was
[1:03:50] put down lift it back up again
[1:03:54] it's the revitalization of something
[1:03:59] oh my there's so much I can say right
[1:04:02] there
[1:04:03] but some of us need to go through a
[1:04:05] revitalization
[1:04:07] Hallelujah somebody and my prayer is
[1:04:10] that this Resurrection Day somebody
[1:04:13] would experience a personal
[1:04:16] Resurrection
[1:04:20] there was a statement that was made
[1:04:25] and I mentioned it earlier uh but
[1:04:27] there's a statement that was made if we
[1:04:29] did brother Brandon said if we didn't
[1:04:31] even have a Bible we will still know
[1:04:33] that Christianity was right
[1:04:35] if we even if we didn't have a Bible we
[1:04:38] still know it's right and there are some
[1:04:40] things that he said he says he talked
[1:04:42] about it through nature and I just wrote
[1:04:44] a few notes as seen in the Nature's
[1:04:47] trees loses its leaves in the fall the
[1:04:49] sap drops into the roots during the
[1:04:52] winter the tree looks dead
[1:04:56] it looks dead and some of us look dead
[1:05:01] but there's a resurrection
[1:05:03] inside of you
[1:05:07] and all we got to do is get it into the
[1:05:09] right conditions
[1:05:11] oh
[1:05:12] yeah
[1:05:14] I wish I could preach it the way I felt
[1:05:17] it
[1:05:19] but the tree looks dead
[1:05:22] amen the stops drop into the roots
[1:05:24] during the winter amen but nature
[1:05:26] produces a vibrant Green Tree in the
[1:05:29] spring
[1:05:31] even a flower seems as if it died in the
[1:05:34] winter
[1:05:35] but because it dropped the seed of
[1:05:38] itself
[1:05:39] into the Earth beforehand oh my before
[1:05:43] the winter strikes the flower has an
[1:05:46] intelligence in it to take a seat of
[1:05:48] itself
[1:05:50] and drop it into the Earth and when the
[1:05:52] winter amen the winter strikes and then
[1:05:54] the spring rains come that flower begins
[1:05:56] to come back up again it's the same
[1:05:59] flower with amen uh what we call
[1:06:01] Perpetual life
[1:06:04] glory to God the flower has Perpetual
[1:06:06] life and it does rise again
[1:06:10] the Sun that rises
[1:06:13] will also set
[1:06:16] but tomorrow the same sun will rise
[1:06:18] again and I like this step storm clouds
[1:06:22] cannot even stop the Sun from rising
[1:06:27] amen
[1:06:28] they may temporarily block our view of
[1:06:32] seeing the s-u-n
[1:06:34] but they cannot stop it from rising
[1:06:39] and spiritual storms may block our view
[1:06:42] of Christ
[1:06:44] but they cannot stop the Daystar from
[1:06:47] shining in our hearts
[1:06:51] oh I'll worship him in the valley
[1:06:57] actually that's when your prayers get
[1:06:58] the best
[1:07:01] we can see resurrections happening all
[1:07:04] throughout scripture even before our
[1:07:06] Lord and Savior Jesus rose from the dead
[1:07:11] um there was I'll give you three amen
[1:07:13] but before I get to those one one
[1:07:15] statement brother Brandon made about
[1:07:17] amen Isaac being offered at Mount Moriah
[1:07:20] it was a foresight of what the
[1:07:24] resurrection of Christ would be we find
[1:07:26] that in Genesis 24 the same Isaac that
[1:07:29] was laid on the altar was the same Isaac
[1:07:31] that was brought from the altar
[1:07:34] it was a foresight there was amen the
[1:07:37] resurrection uh in Elijah they in his
[1:07:41] ministry he prayed for a little boy
[1:07:45] and this boy uh uh was dead and and he
[1:07:48] went in there and prayed and and the
[1:07:50] Lord raised this boy up you find him and
[1:07:52] find the story in First Kings 17 verse
[1:07:54] 20 through 24. but also that same Spirit
[1:07:58] was in Elisha
[1:08:00] praise God and here in Elisha there was
[1:08:04] a little little boy who died amen and
[1:08:07] the mother come running a man to get
[1:08:09] Elijah she says look you know uh I used
[1:08:13] to prepare a place for you I used to do
[1:08:15] this and and her husband said don't go
[1:08:17] to the prophet don't bombs no no I'ma
[1:08:18] just go because he might be the only one
[1:08:20] with a word so let me just go and she
[1:08:22] would say a boy about 12 years old is
[1:08:23] dead and I had a son stroke and he died
[1:08:26] so the mother comes and and uh gehazi's
[1:08:29] there and and uh and and he says uh the
[1:08:32] Lord doesn't hear from me uh what what
[1:08:34] was troubled woman so let me just ask
[1:08:35] her is everything well now her testimony
[1:08:38] Hallelujah even though her son was dead
[1:08:41] her testimony is all is well
[1:08:45] when you going through you got to have
[1:08:47] the right testimony
[1:08:50] all is well and he said well what is it
[1:08:53] say well you know Prophet you know I I
[1:08:55] couldn't have children and and you
[1:08:57] promised me to have this boy and and the
[1:08:59] Lord blessed me with the boy but now the
[1:09:01] boy is dead and I don't know what to do
[1:09:02] so he gave gods of the stickers say go
[1:09:05] lay this the staff on them and and the
[1:09:07] woman said well I'm sorry now I
[1:09:09] appreciate your stick but I ain't going
[1:09:12] back to my house without you
[1:09:15] and Elisha goes back to the house with
[1:09:18] this woman amen and the boys laying down
[1:09:21] their Elisha lays on top of the boy amen
[1:09:24] when he lays on top of the boy stretches
[1:09:26] himself on top of the boy same way
[1:09:28] Elijah have come and then he stretched
[1:09:30] himself on top of the boy the Boy
[1:09:31] sneezed seven times and came back to
[1:09:34] life
[1:09:36] we saw resurrections happen in the
[1:09:39] scripture
[1:09:40] but this same Elisha
[1:09:42] that brought a boy back to life
[1:09:46] he died one day
[1:09:48] and when he died they took his bones and
[1:09:51] they buried him
[1:09:53] just uh uh just a a normal place of
[1:09:57] burial
[1:09:58] but there's a soldier
[1:10:00] that's in battle
[1:10:02] and he gets struck down in battle and
[1:10:04] he's dead and his comrades are carrying
[1:10:07] them away in battle from the battle and
[1:10:10] they say well we got to Bear him
[1:10:11] somewhere so it just happened to just
[1:10:13] throw him on the bones of Elisha
[1:10:18] and when they threw this fella home to
[1:10:20] the bones of Elisha he jumped up
[1:10:25] come on somebody I can tell you right
[1:10:27] now there was resurrection power in them
[1:10:30] bones
[1:10:32] Oh Glory to God the man can't Rose to
[1:10:36] his feet and went right back into the
[1:10:37] battle again
[1:10:39] they had saw a resurrection
[1:10:42] they experienced it
[1:10:44] I love this amen let's read that uh
[1:10:47] Second Kings 13 21 that's where we find
[1:10:49] it
[1:10:52] Second Kings 13 21 says and it came to
[1:10:55] pass
[1:10:56] as they were bearing a man they behold
[1:10:58] they spot a band of men and they cast a
[1:11:02] man into the sepulch of Elisha and when
[1:11:04] the man was let down and touched the
[1:11:07] bones of Elisha he revived and stood up
[1:11:11] on his feet
[1:11:13] you know and I would just you know it
[1:11:15] kind of kind of struck me it was so much
[1:11:17] power in his bones
[1:11:19] that it caused another man to rise up
[1:11:22] but why didn't he lie to himself
[1:11:26] right
[1:11:31] they just keep that one in mind
[1:11:34] why didn't he rise but he had power in
[1:11:36] his bones
[1:11:38] I think if they would have threw another
[1:11:39] one down there
[1:11:41] he would have got up
[1:11:42] and another one they were there it would
[1:11:44] have been all kind of people rising up
[1:11:45] because there was resurrection power was
[1:11:49] laying in them bones
[1:11:51] Elisha is a type of the Bride
[1:11:55] Hallelujah Elisha represents Us in the
[1:11:59] scripture and if resurrection power was
[1:12:01] inside of him that same Resurrection
[1:12:04] Powers inside of us
[1:12:06] Oh Glory to God
[1:12:08] let's go on a little further Jesus
[1:12:11] before he raised from the dead
[1:12:14] Amen in his ministry was manifested
[1:12:16] three people rising from the dead
[1:12:19] and what we got is Lazarus we all know
[1:12:21] about the store of Lazarus how he
[1:12:23] experienced a resurrection after being
[1:12:25] gone four days brother random said that
[1:12:28] even as corruption was setting in on on
[1:12:31] Lazarus corruption newest master
[1:12:35] and Corruption had to let go Lazarus
[1:12:38] praise God when he went to the Grave the
[1:12:41] prophet told us that had he not called
[1:12:43] Lazarus by name everything would have
[1:12:47] came out of the grave
[1:12:49] oh resurrection power was walking on the
[1:12:52] Earth
[1:12:53] he said Lazarus come forth and Lazarus
[1:12:55] came out of the Grave another one was
[1:12:57] Jairus daughter young girl dead and
[1:13:00] Jairus come and say would you please
[1:13:02] come to my house my daughter's dead and
[1:13:04] I just want you to come to my house and
[1:13:06] lay your hands on him he went there to
[1:13:08] jireh's daughter's a rescue and he laid
[1:13:11] hands on her and she rose up from the
[1:13:13] dead
[1:13:15] a third instance of Jesus Amen uh
[1:13:18] displaying this resurrection power was
[1:13:21] when he was passing through a city one
[1:13:23] day he happened to come on the right day
[1:13:25] this woman had just buried her husband
[1:13:28] now she's bearing a son and they're
[1:13:29] going through they've just had the
[1:13:31] service glory to God and now she's
[1:13:34] getting ready to take him to the burial
[1:13:35] and that's the only way to bury oh Jesus
[1:13:38] just touches the buyer
[1:13:39] [Music]
[1:13:41] and the Bible say the boy just rose up
[1:13:43] began to talk to his mama went home and
[1:13:46] got himself a real good meal
[1:13:49] it's something when you come in contact
[1:13:51] with resurrection power
[1:13:55] I don't care what your situation is I
[1:13:58] don't care how bad it is you could be on
[1:14:00] your way to the graveyard but when you
[1:14:03] come in contact with the resurrection
[1:14:05] power it changes everything
[1:14:11] I like to say the resurrection of Christ
[1:14:13] we know hey man this day that people
[1:14:16] celebrate his resurrection and and I'm
[1:14:18] glad that people celebrate it you know I
[1:14:20] get tired of people pulling up Easter
[1:14:22] bunnies in in Easter eggs what that got
[1:14:25] to do with Jesus
[1:14:27] how did abundant take the place of Jesus
[1:14:31] I was at Dunkin Donuts on yesterday and
[1:14:33] I I walked in with another fella and
[1:14:35] Easter bunny sitting there and he's
[1:14:37] trying to scare everybody I'm looking
[1:14:38] man this is nonsense this is nonsense
[1:14:42] get get this guy out of here
[1:14:44] why why don't why don't why don't you

[1:14:48] put a costume on like Jesus and tell
[1:14:51] people what the real story of East is
[1:14:53] all about
[1:14:57] glory to God
[1:14:59] but when Jesus rose from the grave I
[1:15:02] love uh What uh maybe we'll pick this up
[1:15:05] Matthew 27 52 I didn't write that one
[1:15:07] down but let's pull that one up for me
[1:15:09] Matthew 27-52
[1:15:12] you know when I was listening to a
[1:15:14] brother make a comment this morning and
[1:15:15] and he was saying when we think about it
[1:15:18] in Israel uh there's an empty tomb this
[1:15:22] morning
[1:15:23] our Lord and savior is no longer in the
[1:15:25] Tomb we know he rose he's he's no longer
[1:15:28] there but when you think about it
[1:15:29] according to Matthew 27 and 52 there
[1:15:32] were some more empty Tunes
[1:15:34] because the Bible says and the graves
[1:15:36] were open
[1:15:37] and many bodies of the Saints which
[1:15:40] slept
[1:15:41] a rose let me tell you something there
[1:15:43] was resurrection power
[1:15:46] in them
[1:15:47] before they died they had it in them
[1:15:50] my God my God my God
[1:15:53] so it wasn't just one empty grave but
[1:15:56] there were many empty griefs and I'm
[1:15:59] here to tell you this morning if the
[1:16:02] devil has you in a grave of doubt
[1:16:04] the grave is gonna be empty

[1:16:16] engrave of Oppression and a grave of
[1:16:18] depression the grave is about to be

[1:17:01] amen there will be a resurrection there
[1:17:05] will be a revitalization there will be a
[1:17:08] return
[1:17:09] resurrection power is in you
[1:17:15] my God
[1:17:18] Peter received a resurrection in his
[1:17:21] spirit
[1:17:22] the brothers on the road to Emmaus
[1:17:24] received a resurrection in their spirits
[1:17:29] I want to tell you you even experienced
[1:17:31] a resurrection when you were baptized in
[1:17:34] the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:17:37] let's read Romans 6 verse 3 through 5.
[1:17:40] you experienced it
[1:17:42] Oh Glory
[1:17:50] verse 3 says no ye not
[1:17:54] that so many of us were baptized into
[1:17:57] Jesus Christ were baptized into his
[1:18:00] death
[1:18:01] therefore we are buried with him
[1:18:05] by baptism
[1:18:08] oh my into death that like as Christ was
[1:18:11] raised up from the dead
[1:18:13] by the glory of the father even so we
[1:18:17] also should walk in newness of life
[1:18:21] for if we have been planted together
[1:18:24] in the likeness of his death we shall be
[1:18:27] also in the likeness
[1:18:30] of his resurrection
[1:18:33] when you were baptized it's Amen the the
[1:18:37] baptized in the name of Lord Jesus
[1:18:39] Christ it is the old person going into
[1:18:41] the water we took the old man into the
[1:18:44] water and when we when you come up out
[1:18:46] the water the new man is is walking now
[1:18:49] you experience a resurrection and
[1:18:52] remember Resurrection is not replacement
[1:18:55] Amen brother Branham also said not only
[1:18:58] do we uh uh uh as a scripture just read
[1:19:01] Paul told us that we we experience the
[1:19:03] resurrection when we're baptized in the
[1:19:04] name of the Lord Jesus Christ but
[1:19:06] brother random saying you experience a
[1:19:08] resurrection
[1:19:09] when you left the deadness or the
[1:19:12] deafness of denominationalism
[1:19:15] you experience the resurrection when you
[1:19:17] came out of her my people
[1:19:21] you experience a resurrection when you
[1:19:23] left the things of the world
[1:19:25] because that's when the lifestyle you're

[1:19:34] give you a personal Resurrection
[1:19:37] I want to kind of just inject a couple
[1:19:41] things here listen to this uh uh and out
[1:19:45] of the sermon does God ever change his
[1:19:47] mind about his word

[1:19:51] set I think I'm doing real good with my
[1:19:53] time and uh we gonna get this home your
[1:19:57] Resurrection is in you right now
[1:20:00] it makes a statement here at the
[1:20:02] beginning of the sermon does God ever
[1:20:03] change his mind about his word he says
[1:20:05] I'm happy to be back in church tonight
[1:20:08] and to be with you dear people
[1:20:10] I know it's warm but I just called my
[1:20:12] wife I think it's 90 degrees or
[1:20:14] something or 95 or 96 or something
[1:20:17] and it's quite a bit warmer than it is
[1:20:19] here so I'm getting used to the warm
[1:20:22] weather now but I'm so glad to be here
[1:20:25] at the Tabernacle of this wonderful
[1:20:26] Easter time
[1:20:28] it says that I can't say that I
[1:20:30] apologize for that long long message
[1:20:31] this morning
[1:20:33] but I didn't want to wear out your
[1:20:35] patience and then come at it again
[1:20:37] tonight
[1:20:38] but I want it
[1:20:40] to get that message to you
[1:20:43] that you are a part of this Resurrection
[1:20:48] the prophecy I wanted to get that
[1:20:49] message to you that you are a part of
[1:20:53] this Resurrection see
[1:20:56] he says and don't you worry about it no
[1:20:58] more see just Rejoice over it there is
[1:21:02] nothing nowhere can separate you from it
[1:21:06] nothing eternally secure in the kingdom
[1:21:09] of God when God has stabbed his seal
[1:21:11] upon you you're to the end of the
[1:21:14] destination
[1:21:15] now he makes this statement but I wanted
[1:21:18] to get
[1:21:19] I wanted to I want to get that message
[1:21:22] to you
[1:21:24] and uh the question is what message did
[1:21:27] he want to give to you
[1:21:31] what message did he want to get to you
[1:21:33] well
[1:21:35] the sermon that he was referring to
[1:21:37] us it is the rising of the Sun
[1:21:41] that was a sermon that he preached right
[1:21:43] before
[1:21:44] and uh so he had one in the evening one
[1:21:47] in the morning and we go back to the
[1:21:49] rising of the sun now and we pull up
[1:21:51] just a few quotes from here the first
[1:21:53] one that I want to get
[1:21:55] amen is this
[1:21:58] it says on Easter morning
[1:22:01] not only did he raise look at this but
[1:22:04] his beneficiaries raised with him that's
[1:22:07] us
[1:22:10] Oh Glory to God
[1:22:13] see if if if if if that same spirit
[1:22:17] that raised Christ from the dead dwell
[1:22:20] in you it'll Quicken your mortal bodies
[1:22:24] we identified in him with him in life
[1:22:27] and we identify with him in death
[1:22:30] we're identified with him in
[1:22:31] Resurrection
[1:22:32] he says on Easter morning
[1:22:36] not only did he raise but his
[1:22:38] beneficiaries raised with him they were
[1:22:41] in Christ at his crucifixion
[1:22:45] they were in him at his resurrection we
[1:22:50] are his beneficiaries quickened after
[1:22:53] being dead in darkness in a darkened
[1:22:57] world of unbelief where churches and the
[1:23:01] denominations and so forth had drawn us
[1:23:04] out
[1:23:05] we were quickened from it you know I was
[1:23:08] listening to a brother say this this
[1:23:09] morning let me just I'll I'll pause
[1:23:11] there just for a second
[1:23:14] uh as brother Belton I was talking to
[1:23:16] him earlier you know in the week and and
[1:23:18] he was telling me says you know
[1:23:21] when brother Branham told the story
[1:23:23] of a eagle
[1:23:26] that have been uh misplaced down in a
[1:23:30] barnyard
[1:23:31] and he says uh and he said the mother
[1:23:34] Eagle came and screamed looking for that
[1:23:36] baby eagle it says for those of us that
[1:23:40] were in denomination
[1:23:42] when brother Branham said that that
[1:23:45] meaned everything to us
[1:23:47] because we could clearly identify that
[1:23:50] there was more than this
[1:23:53] well let me let me let me let me let me
[1:23:55] break this down just a little bit more
[1:23:57] there are some people
[1:24:00] that go to denominational churches just
[1:24:03] to be able to tell people I go to church
[1:24:08] there are other people like I was when I
[1:24:11] was in denomination I didn't just go to
[1:24:13] tell people I've been to church but I
[1:24:15] was involved
[1:24:17] deeply involved
[1:24:19] amen if they want to join the Usher
[1:24:21] board you was on the Usher board if they
[1:24:24] needed you in the choir you was in the
[1:24:25] choir what Sunday school we was there we
[1:24:30] did everything for when they had three
[1:24:32] o'clock services in the afternoon
[1:24:35] serving pound cake and punch
[1:24:39] hello somebody we was there when nobody
[1:24:43] else was representing the church in the
[1:24:45] afternoon
[1:24:46] they say the choir was supposed to come
[1:24:48] we happened to be there
[1:24:51] only a few members of the choir we gave
[1:24:53] everything to the system
[1:24:57] we weren't going just to say we went to
[1:24:59] church but we gave everything to the
[1:25:01] system
[1:25:03] and when you're giving everything to the
[1:25:05] system then you begin to understand the
[1:25:07] inner workings
[1:25:09] of the system
[1:25:12] you don't notice if you ain't really
[1:25:14] involved
[1:25:16] so I'm gonna tell you like if you're
[1:25:17] gonna go
[1:25:20] so you can get spiritually sick
[1:25:23] and when you get sick you will realize
[1:25:25] something he was wounded
[1:25:27] for your transgressions he was bruised
[1:25:31] for your iniquities
[1:25:33] the chastisement of your pieces upon him
[1:25:36] and with his stripes you can be healed
[1:25:40] spiritually healed
[1:25:46] but to say when brother Brandon made
[1:25:47] that statement it really meant something
[1:25:49] to us
[1:25:50] because we were there but people that's
[1:25:52] born in this message people that's
[1:25:55] raising this message you don't even
[1:25:57] understand what he's saying
[1:25:59] you know you have no idea what he said
[1:26:01] you haven't experienced that
[1:26:05] that's why that's why that's why when we
[1:26:07] come out and we say look at me look I
[1:26:08] don't tried it all right I've been there
[1:26:11] and I can tell you right now it's worse
[1:26:13] now than it was when I was there
[1:26:19] homosexual song leaders
[1:26:23] I mean back in those days we had a
[1:26:25] homosexual musicians now they song
[1:26:26] leaders and preachers
[1:26:29] you're gonna raise your kid in there
[1:26:31] you gotta be kidding me
[1:26:34] people ain't got enough in them to come
[1:26:36] out of here
[1:26:37] [Music]
[1:26:40] I had a friend of mine recently
[1:26:42] she sent me a card in the mail to me and
[1:26:45] sister Erica
[1:26:46] she said she was just watching some of
[1:26:47] this stuff on TV and some of these great
[1:26:50] preachers and
[1:26:51] some of them getting caught in some
[1:26:52] really really bad situations
[1:26:54] and she said you know I was just so
[1:26:56] frustrated what I was here and I said
[1:26:57] you know what I got to tell I got to
[1:27:00] tell Jack and I gotta tell his wife that
[1:27:02] I really appreciate them
[1:27:04] he said because they they really doing
[1:27:06] things right they they ain't in no
[1:27:08] scandals
[1:27:11] they living right before the people
[1:27:13] they ain't got a bunch of nonsense
[1:27:15] happening in the church
[1:27:17] we got a standard in the church but we
[1:27:19] ain't got nonsense
[1:27:22] come on somebody
[1:27:23] just I just need to let them know how
[1:27:25] much I preach okay this guy he all on TV
[1:27:27] but look at what he's doing I look at
[1:27:29] look at what his son doing and he's
[1:27:30] supporting his son doing that look at
[1:27:33] this guy look at this guy
[1:27:39] she told me about uh I'm gonna just call
[1:27:41] these things I use it on cause but TD
[1:27:44] Jakes had uh
[1:27:46] what's the guy that played my dear
[1:27:49] Tyler Perry TD Jakes have Tyler Perry
[1:27:51] praying over him
[1:27:54] and then I hear this guy got not just
[1:27:57] dressed up as a woman my dear
[1:28:00] not just that but now he got a new show
[1:28:03] with two men being in a bed
[1:28:06] homosexual stuff happening all over and
[1:28:09] he praying over a preacher
[1:28:11] he couldn't come here and pray
[1:28:14] you can come here and get prayed for but
[1:28:17] you can't come here and pray
[1:28:20] it's sin all over the place and come on
[1:28:23] y'all as Christians we can't be
[1:28:25] identified with this stuff ain't nothing
[1:28:27] funny about it
[1:28:29] this stuff and leading people to hell
[1:28:33] you better see somebody say I hear all
[1:28:35] this and I see how I said she said I
[1:28:37] just had to send a little note in the
[1:28:39] mail just to say thank you
[1:28:41] thank you for being real thank you for
[1:28:45] keeping it right thank you
[1:28:47] thank you that we at least got one
[1:28:49] representative
[1:28:51] ain't sugarcoating the gospel
[1:28:54] it is what it is
[1:28:55] since I got family members living in
[1:28:57] this homosexual lifestyle but I'm
[1:28:59] telling this wrong that's right you
[1:29:01] gotta tell them it's wrong
[1:29:03] it's love that tells them they're wrong
[1:29:06] because love corrects
[1:29:09] anybody anybody agreeing with you and
[1:29:12] sin does not love you
[1:29:15] imma go into my message they trying to
[1:29:17] put are we trying to get a resurrection
[1:29:18] of some people
[1:29:20] glory to God look at this it says we've
[1:29:22] been if we are as beneficiary as quick
[1:29:24] and after being dead in darkness in a
[1:29:26] darkened world of unbelief where
[1:29:27] churches and denominations so forth had
[1:29:30] drawn us out
[1:29:31] and there was something in US calling oh
[1:29:33] we want God we're hungry and thirsting
[1:29:35] for God We join the Methodist Baptist
[1:29:38] Pentecostals Presbyterians and what more
[1:29:40] and still there was something wrong we
[1:29:42] just couldn't find it yet
[1:29:44] all of a sudden
[1:29:47] while we was groping in darkness
[1:29:51] the Great
[1:29:53] Resurrection
[1:29:55] came to us
[1:29:58] anybody has it I I know if you sitting
[1:30:01] here if you sitting here under the sound
[1:30:05] of my voice the great Resurrection has
[1:30:07] come to you I told you the resurrection
[1:30:10] is not an event the resurrection is a
[1:30:13] person of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:30:17] the great Resurrection has come to you
[1:30:22] come to us in the manifestation of the
[1:30:24] promised word of God oh my God remember
[1:30:26] sister Dixon telling me the testimony
[1:30:28] when she first heard this message
[1:30:31] she said she grabbed the whole the book
[1:30:33] pulled it close to her chest she heard
[1:30:36] she heard brother Brandon preachers say
[1:30:38] Lord we need them here
[1:30:41] she was sincere and since she was
[1:30:44] sincere she heard God
[1:30:47] speak back to her
[1:30:49] come on somebody oh
[1:30:52] she heard the voice of God Speak
[1:30:55] the resurrection spoke to her and said
[1:30:58] he is here
[1:31:02] it turned her tears into Joy
[1:31:06] and if she ain't got nothing else she
[1:31:08] got that he is here and I'm identified
[1:31:12] with them
[1:31:16] see I'm gonna tell you when you got
[1:31:18] people like this that don't have their
[1:31:19] experience with God when the
[1:31:21] Resurrection comes to them
[1:31:26] you can't change their minds
[1:31:29] if this intellect ain't gonna get it I
[1:31:32] had an experience with God
[1:31:38] oh my God my God my God
[1:31:41] that great Resurrection came to us in a
[1:31:44] manifestation of the promised word of
[1:31:46] God I can just I can I can go all into
[1:31:49] that you realize when we talk about the
[1:31:51] manifestation of the promised word of
[1:31:53] God
[1:31:54] Malachi 4
[1:31:56] is a manifestation of the promised word
[1:31:59] of God Revelation 10 is a manifestation
[1:32:03] of the promised word of God Revelation
[1:32:06] 18 4 I heard The Voice come out of her
[1:32:10] my people that's a manifestation of the
[1:32:13] promised word of God
[1:32:17] he was a manifestation of the promised
[1:32:19] word of God I will not leave his soul in
[1:32:22] Hell neither will I suffer my Holy One
[1:32:24] to see corruption
[1:32:26] he manifested every word God that every
[1:32:29] word of God that was promised to him he
[1:32:31] proved it when he raised on Easter
[1:32:34] morning
[1:32:42] Romans 8 11 told us about and I
[1:32:44] mentioned this earlier and just hit it
[1:32:46] again
[1:32:47] you you experience a revelation a
[1:32:49] resurrection when you when you left the
[1:32:52] things of the world you experienced the
[1:32:53] resurrection
[1:32:55] some of us experience the resurrection
[1:32:56] when we came out of dead
[1:32:58] denominationalism
[1:33:00] to this manifested word for this day
[1:33:03] Romans 8 11 says but if the spirit of
[1:33:06] him
[1:33:07] that raise up Jesus from the dead dwell
[1:33:09] in you
[1:33:10] he that raised up Christ from the dead
[1:33:12] shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by
[1:33:16] his spirit that dwelleth in you
[1:33:18] I'm going back to
[1:33:23] the message faith and I'm going to the
[1:33:26] second quote that I have listed there
[1:33:28] in the message faith on the first page
[1:33:31] says now
[1:33:34] when we receive Christ into our hearts
[1:33:38] there's all that we have need there's
[1:33:40] eternal life
[1:33:42] when you truly receive Christ in your
[1:33:44] hearts it says now Christ
[1:33:46] could not come back
[1:33:52] until three days was fulfilled
[1:33:56] because his spirit
[1:33:58] was behind a screen
[1:34:01] like a bar
[1:34:03] I want y'all to get this
[1:34:05] I told you he had power
[1:34:08] to lay himself down
[1:34:11] he had power
[1:34:13] to pick himself up
[1:34:16] but he also had power
[1:34:18] to stay there for three days
[1:34:23] he had to stay there because he kept
[1:34:25] saying in three days I'm gonna do this
[1:34:27] in three days so he could not come
[1:34:30] before three days
[1:34:32] otherwise he would have broke the word
[1:34:37] he had to have Oh my he had to have
[1:34:39] power to control himself
[1:34:45] that's probably the greatest power right
[1:34:48] there
[1:34:49] not only power to give up my rights and
[1:34:52] lay my life down
[1:34:54] but already know that if I did lay my
[1:34:56] life down then I wouldn't make her way
[1:34:57] for man to come back into the presence
[1:34:59] of God so I gotta lay my life my life
[1:35:02] down but I also know that when I lay it
[1:35:04] down
[1:35:05] the power's already in me while I'm
[1:35:07] sitting here talking to you
[1:35:09] while I'm while I'm uh mentioning these
[1:35:12] things I want you to know I got power to
[1:35:14] lay it down ain't no man gonna take my
[1:35:16] life no nobody gonna do that
[1:35:19] they tried and they got pushed off by
[1:35:21] the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:35:23] but I gotta yield myself to this
[1:35:26] but the same power I have to yield
[1:35:29] myself
[1:35:30] I got power to pick my own self up
[1:35:34] can I put it this way you don't need
[1:35:36] people to encourage you
[1:35:37] you got to encourage it inside of you
[1:35:40] [Music]
[1:35:43] that ain't no reason to stop serving God
[1:35:45] because ain't nobody encourage you David
[1:35:47] said David said I encourage
[1:35:51] sometimes you gotta talk to yourself I
[1:35:54] encourage myself in the Lord
[1:35:56] somebody might not send you a card all
[1:35:58] the time in the mail but you can still
[1:36:00] Encourage Yourself
[1:36:06] God bless you yeah God bless you
[1:36:09] everything I'm going through but I'm
[1:36:11] gonna make it
[1:36:13] I'm going yes I'm gonna make it I don't
[1:36:15] I haven't been through this I haven't
[1:36:17] been through that I can make it through
[1:36:18] this too
[1:36:21] sister Keisha call me recently say
[1:36:23] brother Jack I got this song in my mind
[1:36:25] and I just can't remember who sung in it
[1:36:27] who all the words and and it's just like
[1:36:30] could you send it to me because I said
[1:36:31] yeah what is it they used to say you can
[1:36:33] make it
[1:36:36] you can make it
[1:36:38] hey
[1:36:39] this trial you're going through
[1:36:43] God's gonna show you just what to do you
[1:36:46] can make it come on somebody you can
[1:36:50] make it
[1:36:53] I don't care what's going wrong God
[1:36:57] won't let it last too long you're not in
[1:37:00] this thing alone you can
[1:37:08] [Applause]
[1:37:15] demonstrate this
[1:37:18] he had power
[1:37:20] to hide himself behind that bar
[1:37:23] in the grave now how you know I'm over
[1:37:26] here
[1:37:27] you can hear my voice
[1:37:29] you might not be able to see me but you
[1:37:32] know I'm here
[1:37:33] Jesus was in the grave and he could not
[1:37:37] come out
[1:37:39] because there was a promise there in
[1:37:41] amen Psalm 16 10. so that's what thou
[1:37:45] would not leave my soul in hell
[1:37:48] neither will thy suffer thine Holy One
[1:37:51] to see corruption so he had to stay
[1:37:54] there three days power to keep him in
[1:37:58] the grave
[1:38:01] but on the third day praise God
[1:38:05] resurrection power came out the grave
[1:38:10] and he lives forever more
[1:38:13] there was a promise that kept him in the
[1:38:16] grave there was a promise that took him
[1:38:19] to the Grave there's a promise that got
[1:38:22] him out of the grave
[1:38:25] I wanted to say it like this
[1:38:27] we have some saints go on before us
[1:38:31] but all of them experience a personal
[1:38:34] amen a spiritual resurrection and some
[1:38:37] even experience a physical Resurrection
[1:38:41] mother Tillman experience a physical
[1:38:43] Resurrection
[1:38:45] come on somebody
[1:38:47] hallelujah amen and I want you to
[1:38:49] understand now when Jesus died on the
[1:38:51] cross within a minute he could have
[1:38:54] opened his eyes
[1:38:56] because he had power to do so
[1:38:58] amen within 24 hours he could open his
[1:39:01] eyes because he had power to do so
[1:39:05] within 48 Hours he had power to open
[1:39:08] amen and come out of grave because he
[1:39:10] had power to do so
[1:39:13] but he stayed there because of a promise
[1:39:15] in the scripture
[1:39:18] I asked earlier
[1:39:19] Elisha
[1:39:22] man that guy could lay on your bones and
[1:39:25] just jump back to his people why are you
[1:39:27] laying there
[1:39:31] the same resurrection power that Christ
[1:39:33] had our love was had in them before they
[1:39:36] left here
[1:39:37] and at any moment you know at in five
[1:39:40] minutes God could have raised them up
[1:39:42] Mother Temple was going to think about
[1:39:44] uh eight minutes or something like that
[1:39:46] God brought her back
[1:39:48] come on somebody
[1:39:49] Hallelujah
[1:39:52] God could have brought it back amen
[1:39:55] again an hour could have brought it back
[1:39:57] again in another day I mean he could
[1:39:59] have been been just like our Lazarus
[1:40:01] after four days brought him right back
[1:40:04] amen amen but why why why would they be
[1:40:09] behind the screen
[1:40:12] what
[1:40:14] why can they go behind the bar
[1:40:16] what's keeping them behind the bar
[1:40:23] because they got a scripture that they
[1:40:25] need to reveal
[1:40:28] and I cannot give you the scripture
[1:40:31] they are hell behind the bar because of
[1:40:34] a scripture
[1:40:36] not that there's no power in our God the
[1:40:40] same power that kept him behind the bar
[1:40:42] is the same power that brought him up
[1:40:46] but what is this power that that that's
[1:40:48] keeping them amen from from being a
[1:40:51] physical manifestation with us right now
[1:40:56] [Applause]
[1:40:58] please let's get on people to a sister
[1:41:01] Nelly
[1:41:02] it's right there in the Bible but
[1:41:04] there's a power Resurrection Powers
[1:41:07] inside of them and if you happen to go
[1:41:10] the same way resurrection power it's
[1:41:12] already inside of you those of you with
[1:41:15] the Holy Ghost
[1:41:20] let's read it first Thessalonians
[1:41:23] chapter 4.
[1:41:25] hey I love Jesus
[1:41:30] for this we say
[1:41:32] unto you by the word of the Lord
[1:41:37] that we which are alive and remain unto
[1:41:39] the coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[1:41:44] them which are asleep
[1:41:46] for the Lord himself
[1:41:49] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[1:41:53] with the voice of the Archangel and with
[1:41:56] the Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[1:42:01] shall rise first
[1:42:06] that's the scripture that keeps them
[1:42:08] behind the bar
[1:42:11] it just keeps them there but we know
[1:42:13] we're gonna see him again
[1:42:15] because Resurrection powers in the bones
[1:42:19] it says then we which Our Lives remain
[1:42:21] shall be caught up together with them in
[1:42:23] the clouds to meet the Lord in the air
[1:42:25] and so shall we ever be with the Lord
[1:42:30] and Paul said wherefore
[1:42:34] Comfort one another with these words
[1:42:37] I know sometimes you might get to
[1:42:39] missing
[1:42:41] some of the ones that's going on
[1:42:43] but Resurrection pot was laying in them
[1:42:46] and I want you to know something here
[1:42:47] amen that uh that power that is in him
[1:42:51] is gonna get him up
[1:42:52] but that same power's not keeping them
[1:42:55] behind the bar
[1:42:56] amen if I can put it that way uh you
[1:42:59] know beyond uh beyond the Curtis I'm
[1:43:01] just keeping them there just for a
[1:43:02] little bit because they got to fulfill
[1:43:04] that scripture
[1:43:05] and if you happen to go that way you got
[1:43:07] to fulfill that scripture but it's still
[1:43:09] resurrection power in you one way or the
[1:43:11] other
[1:43:14] one day we may be in here worshiping
[1:43:17] and we'll see that resurrection power
[1:43:21] I was just thinking this morning as I
[1:43:23] was in prayer it might be coming to
[1:43:25] servicing this young fella come running
[1:43:27] down the aisle
[1:43:29] and run down the island get to the front
[1:43:31] of the church it just
[1:43:33] all right don't know what to do with
[1:43:35] himself cause he never heard these
[1:43:37] things before
[1:43:38] you look up you say hey that's brother
[1:43:40] Mike
[1:43:41] amen
[1:43:43] I thought it might be a sister sitting
[1:43:45] down sitting on a second row with a hat
[1:43:48] tilted
[1:43:52] and she won't be 80 years old
[1:43:54] but she about be about 20 years old
[1:43:57] he'd be looking to say who is this new
[1:43:59] sister
[1:44:00] and then sister Tina come up and sing I
[1:44:03] have a testimony
[1:44:06] and you'll see that sister get up out of
[1:44:08] seat
[1:44:09] throw our hands in the air begin to
[1:44:12] worship God like you never saw before
[1:44:14] who is this Sister Sister Tillman
[1:44:20] you see another slender sister
[1:44:23] amen with black hair you never seen her
[1:44:26] like that before
[1:44:28] cause when you knew she had gray hair
[1:44:30] white hair
[1:44:31] but she was just as young as everybody
[1:44:34] else
[1:44:35] glory to God but with a black cast say
[1:44:37] who was that Sister Sister wayson
[1:44:43] then there might be another fella kind
[1:44:45] of tall walk inside the church he won't
[1:44:49] come here but he want to go and appeals
[1:44:51] a plus
[1:44:52] with a seats are nice because he said
[1:44:55] you graduated if you sit down on the
[1:44:58] chair start looking around saying my God
[1:45:01] the church doesn't grow what happened to
[1:45:05] the church brother Lim damn
[1:45:13] and I can see another fella come
[1:45:15] he might be running around
[1:45:18] because he don't mind getting out there
[1:45:20] with the young people
[1:45:21] he owed us I don't know what but he
[1:45:24] don't mind getting out there with the
[1:45:26] young people to shoot him what he can do
[1:45:28] he may take you up and say I'm gonna
[1:45:30] race you
[1:45:32] he may walk up to the front of the
[1:45:34] church and said take a look
[1:45:36] at the poop and say yeah it's still
[1:45:39] hurting on it's still steady
[1:45:41] then brother brothers please say I added
[1:45:44] this and I added that but we still got
[1:45:46] the basics
[1:45:49] Hallelujah
[1:45:51] and then he'll pull you to the side and
[1:45:53] start talking to you about some sprouts
[1:46:00] brother purse is in the house
[1:46:04] resurrection power
[1:46:10] it was in them
[1:46:12] it was in them before they left here
[1:46:15] it's in them keeping them behind the
[1:46:17] screen
[1:46:21] but the dead in Christ will rise first
[1:46:24] and we which are alive
[1:46:27] that's the key you just can't be alive
[1:46:31] but you got to be alive and
[1:46:33] remain
[1:46:36] unto the coming of the Lord
[1:46:39] we'll see him again
[1:46:41] resurrection power and if you don't have
[1:46:44] that resurrection power in you
[1:46:46] through the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:46:49] my advice is repent
[1:46:52] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:46:54] Jesus Christ
[1:46:56] for the remission of your sins and ye
[1:46:58] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:47:01] which is resurrection power
[1:47:06] you want to be able to Rejoice like the
[1:47:07] other Saints rejoice
[1:47:10] when when my dad was called home
[1:47:13] resurrection power came out my brother
[1:47:18] it was always there
[1:47:21] no matter what he was going through
[1:47:22] resurrection power was in them
[1:47:25] sometimes just take a certain situation
[1:47:27] to release resurrection power in you
[1:47:34] let me just read a couple more things
[1:47:36] and
[1:47:37] close here today
[1:47:40] my God
[1:47:43] brother random said this in the message
[1:47:45] faith I'm going to the third quote there
[1:47:48] just a little portion of it maybe about
[1:47:50] two sentences he says this now each one
[1:47:52] of you
[1:47:54] each one of you I guess I didn't finish
[1:47:56] the last one did I let me go back to the
[1:47:59] last one I'll just roll right into the
[1:48:00] next one uh that second one it says now
[1:48:04] when we receive Christ in our hearts
[1:48:07] there's all that we have need of there's
[1:48:09] eternal life now Christ could not come
[1:48:11] back
[1:48:11] until three days with fulfill because
[1:48:14] the spirit was behind the screen like a
[1:48:16] bar
[1:48:17] like this that he could not cross over
[1:48:19] that bar because it was a spoken word of
[1:48:22] God that he was delay in the grief for
[1:48:24] three days and three nights now
[1:48:29] now he could not come back until that
[1:48:32] three days and nights was up then when
[1:48:35] three days and nights was up his Spirit
[1:48:36] was loose it went directly to his son
[1:48:38] and soul come back and picked up the
[1:48:40] body and fulfilled what he said I have
[1:48:42] power to lay my life down I have power
[1:48:44] to take it up up again I have power it
[1:48:48] goes on to say this now each one of you
[1:48:49] have power
[1:48:51] the same way because you are the sons
[1:48:54] and daughters of God and the Very Spirit
[1:48:56] that's in you this morning the holy
[1:48:58] spirit says in you this morning that
[1:49:01] same holy spirit will raise you up
[1:49:05] I like this statement so you have power
[1:49:09] power to raise yourself back up
[1:49:12] and if you've fallen into sin
[1:49:15] you have power to fall in
[1:49:18] you got power to get out
[1:49:25] [Music]
[1:49:27] let me go to it's the rising of the Sun
[1:49:30] when this is going to be paragraph 35 I
[1:49:32] think is the second quote there
[1:49:35] I believe I'm not sure it might be the
[1:49:37] first one but he says this when they say
[1:49:39] that Jesus Christ isn't the same
[1:49:40] yesterday today and forever
[1:49:42] that his power isn't the same that his
[1:49:44] gospel is the same when the Bible says
[1:49:46] is the same God defied every
[1:49:48] denomination
[1:49:49] every Creed and they move forth with his
[1:49:52] holy spirit as he promised and proved it
[1:49:54] to us that he is alive we are the
[1:49:57] benefactors of his resurrection
[1:50:00] quickened after being dead in the world
[1:50:02] in sin and trespasses he has quickened
[1:50:06] us together with him raised with him now
[1:50:09] sitting in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:50:11] Jesus his Spirit brings the same life
[1:50:13] again on the earth if the spirit of God
[1:50:16] that raised up Christ the body the
[1:50:19] anointed body if the spirit of God
[1:50:20] anointed that body in such a way when
[1:50:23] that seed fell into the Earth he just
[1:50:25] wouldn't let him rest there no he
[1:50:27] quickened him and raised him up that
[1:50:30] same Spirit by the same works by the
[1:50:33] same Power by the same size be in you
[1:50:37] it'll also raise you up
[1:50:41] I'm skipping down to uh paragraph 94
[1:50:44] Amen in that same sermon uh just quoting
[1:50:48] the scripture Ephesians 2 1 says you
[1:50:50] have to Quicken who were dead and
[1:50:52] trespasses and sins paragraph 94 says
[1:50:56] this as Christ was the first one to
[1:50:58] raise from all the prophets and so forth
[1:51:00] although typed in many places he was the
[1:51:03] first fruits of those that slept in the
[1:51:05] bride coming of Christ coming out of the
[1:51:08] church they'll and look at that the
[1:51:10] bride coming of Christ
[1:51:12] leaving denominationalism amen we didn't
[1:51:15] get that Pride coming of Christ we left
[1:51:18] the nominationalism we were resurrected
[1:51:20] out of denominations amen hallelujah
[1:51:23] that was Christ's pulling us out of
[1:51:25] there the resurrection came to us
[1:51:28] amen came preached all in one sermon but
[1:51:31] I'm here to tell you the resurrection
[1:51:33] came to me
[1:51:36] just like he came to the brothers on the
[1:51:37] road team man he came to me
[1:51:41] on the road timings he broke the open
[1:51:43] the scriptures
[1:51:45] and they understood him by scripture the
[1:51:47] reason I believe this message is because
[1:51:49] of what scripture says
[1:51:52] the resurrection came to me now he's
[1:51:55] living in me
[1:51:56] I got resurrection power
[1:52:01] look he says he was the first person of
[1:52:03] those that slept in the bride coming of
[1:52:05] Christ coming out of church there will
[1:52:08] have to be a sheath waved again the last
[1:52:10] days oh my waving of the chief what was
[1:52:12] the chief the first one that comes to
[1:52:14] mature the first one that proved it was
[1:52:16] a wheat that proved it was a Sheaf
[1:52:19] Hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm
[1:52:20] talking about it was weighed over the
[1:52:22] people and the first time they will come
[1:52:24] forth for the bride age for Resurrection
[1:52:26] out of dark denominationalism will be a
[1:52:29] message that uh that the full maturity
[1:52:31] of the word has turned back again and
[1:52:33] it's full of power and being weighed
[1:52:35] over the People by the same signs and
[1:52:36] wonders that he did back there because I
[1:52:39] live
[1:52:40] ye live also
[1:52:42] speaking to his wife because I live you
[1:52:46] live also amen that's what we read in
[1:52:48] the Book of John it says uh what a
[1:52:51] resurrection that was
[1:52:53] Glory but what a resurrection this is
[1:52:58] to be quickened from the dead to me be
[1:53:01] made alive in Christ Jesus by God's
[1:53:04] quickening power
