[Music] save me Bay but I'm surrounded by you Oh somebody worship Him in this place Oh hallelujah good God Almighty [Music] you know this year certainly provided its own set of trials and tests and things of that nature that we all had to go through and often times when you're going through you you yeah somehow God's gonna make a way but when you're in the midst of it you just don't know how that way gonna be made all right man but you got faith that somehow got guns God gonna bring me through this thing and I know for myself there were there were a number of things a man that I faced throughout the year and even all the way up to you know where we are right now and and all what you're going through all you can do is just stand on the word and I'm gonna tell you when you're standing on the word you're standing the place that you can stand and I'm just just thinking back throughout the year and you know just just some of the mighty testimonies that we heard and it meant one of the ones that came to my mind is how God provided $10,000 right and when I think think about that you know this is how we fight our battle you don't know hottest thing on happen I'm sure they they got all kind of threats and all kind of stuff that they're sending but this is how this this is how I fight my battle [Music] amen you get it you get it but you know when we're going through various things like that you know all we can do is just stand on the word don't make me a promise right when when I saw the enemy coming in like a flood I also saw the Spirit of the Lord raised a standard against the enemy hallelujah sir my a man and when it seemed like the devil was attacking my finances I saw God rebuke to the firewalk for my sake and see when I'm going through all I can do just give him the Word of God and brother Adam say when the devil come back them walking with the word and he'll fall with one whack whack deep and just keep whacking of the word and before you know it you'll see that devil fall Church this is how we fight our battles say this is how I fight my battle come up say this is how I fight my since half say this is how I fight my death this is how I fight this is how I fight say how about oh this is how I fight they look like I'm sorry but I'm surrounded it may look like [Music] it may look I'm so well but I'm yeah it may look like I'm surrounded but I'm surrounded by you because you are we make a miracle-worker promise be light in the darkness my god whoa whoa yeah light in the darkness my god - that is who singing insects away vinegar Oh God is who you are ah I don't mind declaring that over my god because that's what I've seen them do for me throughout this year he is a wave maker miracle worker and every promise that he's made he will keep a man that's our God how grateful we are in manless this morning I won't I won't take too much of your time I wanted to thank the Lord for Christian Luciano is that right a man so good to have you with us they met on today invited by system is praise the Lord a man certainly certainly good to have with this and we are blessed a man to have my precious friend a members family here brother Trevor from Andy a man I don't know just loan me a little bit more from Indiana we thank God for him Jeffersonville area Sellersburg a man is a precious wife and three kids and you know they just stay there there they've been friends for quite some time we were kind of going through the numbers last night has been 17 years a man that we've been friends [Music] [Applause] [Music] and I could also say really it was before the foundation of the world that we were connected and it just took 17 years ago for us to finally you don't get connected on this side but but we thank God and a man he's been a real blessing and one of the things that I mean his ministers always been a blessing to us but I think you was my daddy's favorite preacher my daddy would always make comments when brother Trevor would come and he hadn't he had been here amens since dad had passed this is the first time in about three years but brother Trevor's is the one responsible for kind of putting the church age curriculum together and we have been thoroughly blessed at this church a man by that curriculum thoroughly blessed hey man thank God for giving them inspiring it with that idea and you carried it forth and and and we just been reaping some of the benefits from it but uh today he'll speak for us a man and also on tomorrow night a man if you don't have a church to go to and I want to put emphasis on that if you don't have a church to go to out and say if you didn't have a party to go to cuz I know you're not going to no party to celebrate no new year but he ain't got no church to go to come on and be in church with us on tomorrow night and at 9:30 we go we gonna enter the Year by worshiping God amen he brought us through another year carrying us into another year and has been been so good to us so we want to invite you to come and be a part of that amen on to tomorrow night at 9:30 so we're gonna get out of the way and let our precious brother come and just share from his heart amen to our hearts today amen hallelujah that's appropriate mass appropriate fallen in love with Jesus a man I want to do more than just fall deeper and deeper in love with the Lord Jesus as we welcome my precious brother Trevor to the pulpit on today the best thing here's the best thing ever done hallelujah [Music] falling in love with Jesus falling in love whoa falling in love [Music] one more time falling in love with ji Molly [Music] with G falling in love with you it's the best thing evert can we bring it this way I'm satisfied [Music] I'm satisfied we today so is that your testimony he satisfies which I'm satisfied it's all just give him a hand of praise oh he's everything he's the satisfying portion and he's all that we'll ever need amen as you're standing if you have your Bibles we'll turn to first Thessalonians chapter 4 Thank You musicians such young musicians that's wonderful it's good good to be blessed by serving the Lord and having a gift put into the body of Christ and having the desire to use that gift it's wonderful so 1st Thessalonians chapter 4 a very familiar scripture verses 13 through 17 but I would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with a voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first and then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord we just bow our heads for a word of Prayer Heavenly Father Lord we pray that you would let your word speak to our hearts that you would come and anoint me to speak and and to use your words Lord and to get myself out of the way Lord that's that's what your prophet taught that we ought to do Lord the kongregate Lord that we would all get out of the way that you could have your way in your will and it might be done in our lives as we we talked about in Sunday school how Balaam wanted to have it his way and even though you said no I want you to do it this way he came back and asked again as if your first word on the subject wasn't enough but father we want to say we're satisfied Jesus your first word on the subject Lord that satisfies Lord would to be honest we were humbled that you would even speak to us but you would even give us an answer Lord that you would even hear our prayer God is what a blessed people we are God you are everything you are the great way maker Lord we love you continue to be with us now Lord bless this service we ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen so this one on well I don't hear me all right Amen all right you may be seated so I guess well I haven't been here for three and a half years and brother Jack and I were discussing and I've been busy and he's been busy and you know it's a long drive to get down here and I could fly but my family likes to come and you know so it's it's good to be here some new faces since the last time I've been here brother Trevor Eamon is who I am most people refer to me as brother Trevor cuz they can't say nor spell Eamon so you can just forget that part and I'm brother Trevor you don't know any of the other any other brother Trevor's and the message probably so it's helpful to be unique sometimes so anyway that's who I am from Jeffersonville Indiana areas brother jacket said attended the Branham Tabernacle for close to 20 years and now with your friend and mine brother Nathan Bryant at his church Church the open door and bring you greetings from them and of course had a wonderful time of fellowship when so many of you all came and we we just had a time of worship and the Lord moved in a mighty way healings and different things so we thank God that he still Hebrews 13:8 he's still alive and well amen he still moves in his church and in his people and that's not just a platitude that's not just something we say but it's truth because it manifests amongst us you know cancer has been healed by my prayer how about yours you know and it's nothing about me but it's to say that God is still alive that he still moves and I'm it's so thankful you know I'm just thankful to be with family again you know you know we've just we've just been 17 years is a long time to be friends and I thank God every day for it you know sometimes brother Jack sometimes brother Jack has has the ability to push me from behind you know you know I'm kind of a you know sit back and calculate and make sure that you know he who builds a tower you know must first sit down and count the cost to see if he has enough money and then he builds the tower you know and brother Jack he uses the movie and he's instead of the word he says if you build it they'll come I've just play in there but you know I you know to show that we're on sometimes you know we're in we're in two different you know viewpoints but that but that III appreciate his faith you know and and and the gift that he has I realized you know brother Nathan Bryant and I have been friends for even a few years longer than brother Jack and I have been friends and realized that you know God used the gifts and talents in his life and he started a church you know I could have done the same thing sometimes I look and go well why didn't I do that why that I could be the pastor and you know that need be the Evangelist and you know things would be different but you know but I but I recognize that God puts different talents in different gifts and different perspectives even brother Nathan that I used to work together and he had that entrepreneurial you know he took what I was doing I was working as on contract for this company and he took that and he took over for me when I left to take my current job and you know and then he's like well I did this you know if I'm doing this for these people I can do this for you know five other people and he made a business out of it you know so it was a job to me and it was a business to him well that same entrepreneurial spirit now brother Nathan you know he he one that starts a church you know so we recognize that God has different callings and different abilities in different people and we just we just thank God for all of those things yeah so but but so as we you know just to bless their to be in the in the Sunday school and going over the church age book and my I think I'd you know I was like oh man I I need about I got a I need about a week just here every night you know I could just I just preach you know I just you know got me so fired up and but it was to me very fulfilling to see a church that's using a curriculum that I put together by the help of the Lord but not to you know to take all the credit because as I was saying brother Jack sometimes kind of pushes me from behind and the story there is I was doing this curriculum for my Sunday School and then we had a change of leadership in our church and then I'm not teaching Sunday school and I had this curriculum about half written and then suddenly I'm not teaching anymore well you guys are like 1015 lessons behind me at that point I'm brother Jack's like brother Trevor you uh you can't stop writing this I said well brother you you know you you're doing fine you know you can teach this you you pick up you know you're you're the one teaching you go ahead you know it won't be the same so the fact that it's finished and I want to apologize because I have a box in the back of our van of published church age book study guides and my van is in my garage because we rented a car so I will send those to you all when I got back home I don't even have one with me to show you because just a few weeks ago we went down to Tennessee and there's a sister in the church that does not there that designed the cover for me and of course I forgot her copy as well so I gave her mine and never got a new one in back in my bag so I don't even have but it's a nice book it's 215 pages you'll have much more room to write your answers down because as many have commented I didn't give you any room to actually write answers so you'll actually have that room now and then you know our I know our resident grammarian isn't here as much I know that maybe there's a few others of you who have those gifts and you know I thought I was pretty decent until brother Nathan and you know he he'll tell you he's homeschooled and he's maybe not the greatest person with grammar and things like that and you know I give him a bad time about how he pronounces things and some of the things he says behind a pulpit and then I just had to stop because I was giving him a complex but you know he took a red pen in his OCD nature and just looked for things that were inconsistent and how I applied things and he I mean it was bleeding red I was like are you kidding me and so anyway so it's been cleaned up quite a bit quite a bit so you'll know you'll enjoy it so for those of you that are that are going to that class and doing that you know I appreciate that and those of you that aren't boy you you know you're missing out not just because I wrote the study guide but you know it's just you know I was thinking about it is here sitting in church and having a service like this you come and you bring you bring something to the table you bring your lick of fire you bring your desire to worship you bring things to the table this is a corporate setting its corporate worship and we're all supposed to participate but when you're doing a class like that you're just coming in and and just like this is for me you know I don't have to just I don't have to be a part I need to sometimes you come to church and the pastor ain't touching you you know you're just sitting there going well that's that's nice but doesn't everybody need and you don't know that like really aren't we past that yet and you know but there's somebody that's sitting there that's going oh my goodness I needed that you know pastor just slapped me up one side and down the other you know and then you know and we're sitting there going home oh what the Lord's even lead in that pastor you know but well you know okay praise God that you're a mature Christian you know we laugh because it's true you know it you've thought it you've sat there and gone what on earth that was a disaster no okay you know what be a mature Christian and come to church come on brother you go I don't know who you're hitting right now but hit them good so we can get on to something I want you know I mean so you come and you participate in a service but when you're in a class like that is just like man just feed me anchor me put my feet you know and put my feet in the forum and then just put cement pour that cement in so that these feet can't go anywhere anchor me down and that's what that's what that's supposed to do you go slow and methodical and few pages here and there and pull in all of these truths that the Prophet that's given us it'll really stable you so so I think brother Jack in this church for pushing me to finish that and I just got an order for 480 books from from a church in Georgia and so I just want to say whoever gets a blessing whoever is touched by this curriculum will you're a part of it this church is a part of it so I thank God for that so anyway all right enough of that little handwritten note little well family talk there so I I appreciate you all very much it's really really good to be back so all right shall we shall we shall we turn our thoughts to the Word of God now so first Thessalonians chapter 4 we just read and we you know the devil has been really trying to frustrate us this this trip we started out I left work a little early I get to budget rental car and I get the keys and I'm man I'm just you know things are working like clockwork I'm on the roll I'm you know left work even a little earlier than I planned now I'm at the airport now I got a car put my bag in the car oh yeah we ain't we ain't showing up at spirit and truth Tabernacles smelling like we've been smoking this dis car hang on work so I'll bring the keys back in I said that one's unacceptable I'm sorry I just you got to give me a different one I'm sorry sir we don't have a different one you know you can take a 12-passenger van if you'd like I rented a very nice SUV and now you want me to drive a 12-passenger van for 18 hours no no it's not a pride thing it's a comfort thing here you know so you know well all the Fords have been recalled and this is the only one we have and you know I I won't go through all of what I tried to push and pull and ice lord I know that the devil is just trying to frustrate me here and to be quite honest it's slightly working I am getting a little frustrated I need to be getting down the road but I know Lord you're gonna if I have to take a 12-passenger van I have to but lord I do not want to but finally you know miraculously or other ways I don't really know if they just lied or what they did but suddenly one of these recalled forward expeditions shows up and they finally get it cleaned up for us and it puts us an hour and 15 minutes later whatever and we get to the hotel and I don't know if the just the way they air was working in that car just you know brother branham talked about how the air would come across his face and so we get to the hotel and I'm like why does my throat hurt like no I'm preaching six times this week let's that's supposed to happen as we leave like I get that but before I start preaching like no my throat's not supposed to be hurting right now so you pray for me and then we get to well when we get to the hotel it's midnight we're tired we're frustrated and they don't have my reservation and the hotel is full and every hotel on that exit is full and you know start calling around try to find a hotel finally you know asleep by 1:30 or something like that you know get up and I don't know what happens on i-75 between you know I 10 and Ocala every day but I certainly hope it's not usually I feel sorry for anybody that has to drive through that stop and go for like a hundred miles or something like that I'm just like you know one of those things alone is you know but EFT you know just keeps hitting you it's like oh like they're full like you lost already would you get the picture as I'm going I'm preaching you can delay me you can frustrate me whatever fine you know but God's will will proof be prevailed so I think the Lord we're here and those things are just you know not even trials I remember brother Jack talking one time about being in the bus and headed up to you know headed up to see us and you know all the DVD players as well yeah rather that's that's terrible you know I better the Apostle Paul was really you know I thought that was a great zinger so I have to just you know I'm sure the Apostle Paul you know would have loved to have traveled in a Ford Expedition where he went to and probably wouldn't complain too bad about you know how many miles is it from here to you know nine hundred miles from here to Louisville or something like that you know and the Apostle Paul probably would have loved to have just been in the vehicle that I was in the Apostle Paul would have loved the 12-passenger man so all of those annoyances aside we are here and we are so supremely blessed amen so you know we got a we got a look at the things that God has blessed us in so 1st Thessalonians 4 all right we're really going to get into it now so 1st Thessalonians 4 we read about it coming about a time when you know there there are dead in Christ that have gone on as brother Jack said you know brother brother birds you know he's not here anymore in this I thought that was that sad this is the first time I've been here since he's passed on and but you know that's kind of appropriate to be thinking about because this is this is what we're talking about is there's a time coming when those and brother birds are gonna come they're not gonna prevent us they're coming first they're gonna come up and they're gonna have a body change we're gonna come we're gonna fellowship with them we're gonna take a body change and then we're gonna meet God in the air that's what the scripture is telling us we are going to meet Christ in the air we're gonna be caught up together with brother birds in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and ever be with the Lord you see there is coming a day that a supernatural event is going to take place in your life so my title this morning is the coming supernatural now you as soon as we get into this just we read the next scripture you're gonna be like what is this part three yes this is nothing what is it nothing is impossible with God this is nothing as impossible with God part three brother Jack started telling me and really did you really because I'd already you know this is really what I want to bring this morning and then he's like yeah I've talked about Barry he's like I never caught this and Mary you know I was like really that's nice that's nice because I was gonna talk about Mary you always do that to me you can't tell him anything the coming supernatural the coming supernatural it's gonna happen in your life as Christians this is what we believe look this isn't about just you don't be nice to one another love people and God's gonna give you money and God's gonna take care of your problems and God does all those things nothing is impossible but is that what this Christian walk is about now those are the benefits that come with the responsibilities that he's given us the responsibility that we have to believe the Word of God and the Word of God says there's a coming a day and it's coming soon that we are gonna take a step over and get caught up to meet the Lord in the air that's what it means to be a Christian and then we're not looking for a millennium here we're not looking for a good time here but we're look we're saying no Jesus is what satisfies me Jesus is what I want to be with so I'm looking I'm not satisfied here even in my comfy SUV I'm not satisfied here look the Christian doesn't care how good you can make it here you know and we thought we ought to be content in whatever state we are in but to the Christian there's always a little longing in his heart we can be content with what God gave us but on another sense nothing will ever be good enough when we're standing here on these two feet because he is everything now we ought to have that kind of relationship here but there should be a longing if you are a Christian that says I can't wait for that day I am looking for the coming and Mary was one of those people she was looking for the coming of the Messiah and we ought to be looking for the coming of a messiah amen oh my I'll try not to preach to a Monday night sermon here but I just caught how well these agree with one another so we look in Isaiah chapter 7 and verse 14 therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Immanuel butter and honey shall he eat that he may know to refuse the evil and choose the good so Isaiah here in this prophecy comes with a very scientific statement that a virgin shall conceive showing of course Isaiah's ignorant in matters of how these things work you know Isaiah if she has conceived she is no longer a virgin that's how this was a virgin cannot conceive that that those words should not be written together can't happen that is impossible let's look at Isaiah chapter 9 hey if you're a Christian this is what you believe that the impossible happened that a virgin did concede now Isaiah nine verses six unto us a child is born unto us a son is given the government shall be upon his shoulder his name shall be called wonderful counsellor the mighty God the everlasting father the Prince of Peace of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David upon his kingdom to order it to establish it with judgment and justice from henceforth even forever the zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this so a child is going to be born a son is going to be given and among the things that he shall be called he shall be called the everlasting father he's a born into the world so he hasn't been everlasting his son that's born can't always be I mean he could be a father in twenty years or so but he can't be the everlasting father you can't have a son that is an everlasting father it just doesn't work Isaiah come on could you prophesize some things that actually make sense that actually work actually aren't impossible cuz that's what you're asking us I say we're staying reasonable people we went to school but you you are asking us to believe things that not not not just that you know a mountain could be moved and cast into the sea or something like that but you know cuz that really you know maybe a lot of wind or you know we could conceive of all kinds of crazy things but these things these things are just impossible by definition by just plain language these things are impossible they cannot be done I say how are we to believe you impossible impossible do you ever think how is it gonna happen this coming supernatural we're gonna we're gonna bounce back and forth we're gonna compare and contrast marry and us do you ever think where we're asked to believe oh yeah we are literally asked to believe that that someday the Lord is going to appear in the clouds and that we are going to be caught up with people who have been passed away and we are gonna and do you ever think how does that happen how does how does that happen you know I used to have dreams that the rapture was happening these are great dreams you know you get really excited for a little bit of time it was like oh my goodness and you know and and I remember one time I felt like I had you know you remember those old round sleds I was in an old round sled and there was no snow but I was in an old round sled and just kind of sitting there holding on and it suddenly I just man I just started getting lifted up and I was like oh praise God it's the rapture you know and I'm not preaching around sled doctrine that that's how we everybody get your round sleds no that's not what brother Trevor is saying but you know and I get so I get high in my dream and a hall praise God the rapture is happening in you man it's wonderful you know and then I look down sure hope the rapture is happening because that's a long way down and if this ain't the rapture then what goes until that time the law applies that what goes up must come now and now the rapture is going to defy that law of gravity but so if you're in around slid and you're really high in the air if you just better hope it's the rapture do you ever think about that though how is it gonna happen you know we're gonna be sitting around slid and just be just be lifted off the ground or we're just gonna be standing here just lifted off the ground or we you know we are we you know Star Trek you know dissolved and then Reda's alt or whatever I can't even remember what the word they use is and that but you know yes Jesus is gonna just beam us up or how does that work like what is it like I don't know and isn't it difficult that's see isn't that the problem is that we're asked to believe something that we don't understand I don't know how it's gonna happen I don't know if I'm gonna look down when Jesus comes and go Jesus I'm glad you come in cuz it's that's a long way down now I don't know will I be scared and excited will I just be excited will I just I don't know how I'm gonna feel I don't know how it will happen I don't know oh there's all kinds of questions surrounding this but I know that he is coming but see that's where we get to we get to a place where we like I don't know and when we don't know something we tend to try to push it away Oh pastor can you explain this to me no yeah pastors don't like saying that you know so a lot of times what they do is don't preach that you know just love one another we can't really explain that either but you know we all get it right cuz it's supernatural it's supernatural the Christian is commanded to believe the supernatural the Christian is comin to believe that the impossible is going to happen can I take it one step further you think oh how is it one step further and then the impossible can happen I want you to say I want you to know that the Christian is commanded to believe that the impossible is going to happen in your life oh it's easy yeah you know it's you know it's easy to believe for someone else's healing Oh God you know come here I'll lay my hands yes God is going to heal you claim it don't ever confess anything different you are healed in the name of Jesus and oh brother this man I heard would you hold you pray for me that this this won't last long because oh my goodness this is driving me crazy and I just I'm in such pain in the home man would you it's a lot harder you know where's that hey in Jesus name you healed and confess and it's all well and you know it's so easy to believe the supernatural can happen for someone else it's easy to believe that the supernatural that yes there's going to be people that take a rapture you know it was easy to believe that there was gonna be a great falling away you know and then we realized we knew those people we realized this oh yeah of course that's gonna happen but you know me yeah and then one of your best friends is that person that's like whoa this just got real all of a sudden and it's but you know what when those scriptures get real all of a sudden I want you to understand there's other scriptures that get real on us and why because the supernatural is real because this is a reality these aren't just things that we say these aren't just platitudes and little isms of this isn't that snow but this is reality that we're preaching that you were born into this world why were you born into this world because God created you because God created this earth and everything that says in the book of Genesis tells you why you're here and who you are and what you're doing and it's reality and to deny that is to deny reality and I'm so glad today we we prove over and over that God is alive and he's in our midst he is reality my praise the Lord okay Luke chapter 1 Luke chapter 1 verses 26 we start in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the house of David the Virgin's name was Mary we didn't we just read about a virgin conceiving and then very obviously virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the house of David and the Virgin's Naito Duss that already you told us Luke that that she's a virgin you did you didn't have to repeat that we'd sort of picked that up already yeah there's a reason he's making a connection for you he's stressing something this is the one that was talked about in Isaiah chapter 7 there's something to this the angel came in unto her and said hail thou that art highly favoured the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at the saying he cast in her mind what manner of salutation shall this be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou has found favor with God and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth his son shall call his name Jesus he shall be great shall be called the son of the highest the Lord God she'll give unto him the throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God and behold my cousin Elizabeth she has also conceived a son in her old age and this is the six month with her who was called barren for with God nothing shall be impossible and Mary said Behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her now obviously you've been covering this scripture for the last couple of weeks but we want to just look at some of these things you know she cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and this is a really good thing you know when we're presented with information you know we really ought to cast in our mind what is this about is this really something I should listen to or isn't it you know especially when an angel comes to you and says you know very great things we ought to we ought to go hmm what is this about an angel has just come to me and said some really great things said I was highly favored and said I was going to have a son and many you know wonderful things that you know seem impossible but an angel what is this about why is this angel talking to me why is this angel talking to me what is this about why is this why is this prophet coming and saying things to me what is this what is my life why is this impacting me why has this come across my path at this time you see it's not just some random chance but this that there's there's a purpose that God is these things are affecting you and impacting you for a purpose so she begins to say you know well Who am I and what is my life why am i a part of this what what is this angel what is this thing that's going on here and so now that you're here and you're in church and you're hearing this you ought to be thinking your mind what is this I'm hearing why am I here what is there something to this is this is this bad pizza or is this real I want you to know this is real so maybe we ought to act like Mary in that and just begin to consider now see Mary was just a normal girl in a very normal place maybe even look down upon just a little bit you know can any good thing come of Nazareth and here's Mary and Mary Mary had every reason to believe that she was completely insignificant completely what shows show me what Mary had was that money was it Fame was it what was it why why does God choose her iiiiii I'd love to know because the scripture doesn't really tell us much we can infer from things that you know how you know like it says of Simeon you know that he was just into devout waiting on a consolation of Israel there were different ones that that had a character about them and God recognizes this character and her ability now to hear this angel and to receive what he is saying is really showing something about her character willing to believe the impossible willing to believe that what is being spoken could be manifested in her life hallelujah you see if you're there maybe you feel completely insignificant and Who am I but if you're there if you are saying I I can listen and I can believe that this will happen in my life you are blessed you are blessed now now Mary then she says in verse 34 how shall this be seeing I know not a man now is she is she doubting here is she doubting what the Angels saying oh she's not doubting what the Angels saying she's not gone yeah angel doesn't know virgin can conceive either no she's just saying Amen okay how so this happened like I don't understand that could you could you help me a little bit on understand what it is you're asking me I'm willing that's fine but could you give me a little bit more here you know there's nothing wrong with a desire for the word there's nothing wrong with asking I don't understand could you help me to see this more that's not doubt you see but there was another couple that we were at about here that Elizabeth and you know her husband Zacharias and an angel comes to him and says your wife is going to have a baby now brother Branham says now look at the difference between Zacharias that minister who'd studied the scriptures over and over and over and over and over again had plenty of examples that was Sara and Hanna so forth back in the Old Testament plenty of examples what he's telling us is there was examples in the Old Testament where old barren women had conceived and born sons all - plenty of examples that God had done this before he doubted it to be so but this little girl this Mary she didn't doubt she said Behold the handmaid of the Lord and be it unto me according to the word what a difference he says now sometimes you can callus yourself reading the Bible just like reading a newspaper and having the same kind of faith that you have in one that you wouldn't the other and then you calles yourself when you read God's Word believe it just like it says it is there and take God and His Word you see the devil you know he's gotten things to where you you can't even believe anything anymore right can you believe the news agencies you know I was going there fake news was Trump the first president in 20 years to not visit the the guys the troops and in at Christmastime or wasn't he you know and I mean it's just one of the recent ones that I just happened to see not that I even follow that closely you know and then somebody's like what part of this picture with Trump of Trump with the troops was not him visiting Trump you know that the troops at Christmastime you know I mean there's many things are just reporting and they're saying this and saying that and you can't believe anything anymore and the devil is actually designing things in such a way that did to get you to a place to get this culture to a place well that nothing is true because if he can get in your mind and the minds of you know you think we're here and we see this we see this thing happening but you go and you look at our children and their children and what where are they going to be they're gonna be living in a world where people don't believe anything and if you're living in a world where people don't believe anything and then you go oh you know what you should believe this this is truth and they go one truth well what's that word that's one of those Old English words right truth because we we don't have those things we gotta be careful the devil would like to get us to a place where nothing is believable oh my you see what today we live in so you got to make sure that you don't calles yourself to the word that you don't allow that culture to pull you into such a place where you begin to get kind of a skeptic assist about everything that you read and everything that you hear and then you go I say virgin conceived I'm smarter than that you can't deceive me try to be all spiritual say you a prophet say things that don't even make sense and then think I'm gonna believe it right yeah I wasn't born yesterday you know God forgive me I don't believe any of that you understand right we're together on this huh I'm say this is how the devil would like to get into your mind and cause you to think and thus make the Word of God uneffective to you completely now but let's look again at Mary now see see as soon as she read this and she's seen us be hope before the anus of the Lord said you're going to have a baby look at what she had to believe she had to believe something that never happens Zacarias didn't happen have to plenty of times did that happen through the scriptures he had plenty of examples he also happened to be the husband of a woman who could have children it's not impossible it was just very difficult for them they were just too old but they at least were married Mary is asked to believe if you have no husband this has never happened but you have to believe that you're going to conceive Mary had to believe something that was totally impossible and had never happened before but yet she didn't stagger at it she just said Behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me she took God at His Word so we are expecting a coming supernatural we're expecting a catching away of the bride of Jesus Christ we're expecting a rapture to take the Churchill a guess what it's never happened before the Lord has never come now now when Jesus don't don't misunderstand me you know be all technical Jesus rose he took the Saints Abraham and Sarah are therein in Palestine or not Palestine to Paradise right now and okay but but you understand now we are asked to believe that Jesus is coming in the clouds and that we are going to be taken up and meeting him this has not happened before this is impossible this is unscientific this is supernatural Mary was asked to believe something unscientific supernatural had never happened before and she said be it unto me according to your word do you see the attitude that she took to what the angel I mean I mean did you see the attitude that she took to what the angel brought to her can I can I can I and I just can I just I just I just sorry I just can't can you can you see the attitude that she took to what the angel said to her we've had we've had a prophet in our day it was the seventh angel you maybe you understand the language that I'm using there's plenty in Revelations we're in a seventh Church shades the Laodicean Church age revelations 314 that there was an angel that was going to come to that church and that that God would give a message to that angel and and I could take you and bring you through many different things to prove to you how wonderful and beautiful this scripture is hey if you would like to come Monday night that's what I'm planning on doing it's good I mean I'm gonna just blow everybody's minds my mind included every time I look at this I'm just like not that I'm doing it but that it's just God's Word and you you student you take a look at Eagle God that's that's impossible because I want to tell you that the man that wrote this book God is the best author he is the greatest author that you you talk about plot twists theirs plot twists all my goodness you go I didn't see that coming till I read it 20 times and there's still more in there how every time I read this this book gets better the third time you read a book it's probably getting boring I don't care who it is what author it is but man the third time you read this you just starting to get it amen so it was the attitude and then so what I'm saying is is that we are following a prophet that is the manifestation of revelations 3:14 that there was an angel to the last church age and and Mary had an attitude that she had toward what the angel had said to her and we are being looked at and what the attitude that we have toward what the angel is saying to us hey mint now and this is that angel he's a man but it it's a messenger that God sent us and this pillar of fire well that's just Jesus Christ not that the man is but that pillar of fire that that's the same thing that led Moses that's the same thing that struck Paul on the road to Damascus amen so so we're Mary you know she comes and she has an attitude to believe even though all of these things are impossible but she has an attitude to believe what the angel says to her she has the right attitude to believe it oh my that's just that's just powerful we you know the right attitude towards any promise of God brings it to pass so what what begins to how did she get into this attitude and brother branham begins to dramatize it and he and can we maybe look it let's just look at at this prophecy that a virgin shall conceive and maybe before the angel comes to Mary maybe we can have a dramatization that brother Branham kind of gives us you know here's Mary and all of her friends around the well one day and and and and everybody's talking and you know maybe the conversation went something like this you know do you all believe that prophecy of Isaiah you know that a virgin shall conceive I mean are we really looking for a messiah to come because you know Isaiah lived 700 years ago and really really that prophecy if you if you look in kings and chronicles and you you and Isaiah and you recognize what's going on here is one of the Kings had asked for a sign and Isaiah says our virgin shall conceive so I mean had every reason to believe that it should have happened like right then but it didn't and so then we decide ah okay it's a prophecy it's it's the coming Messiah that's wonderful okay so we're expecting this to happen and then Isaiah passes away and well was it was he true I mean was he a true prophet I mean he prophesied this he's dead now and it hadn't happened I mean I don't I don't know if anybody finds themselves there with anything where you're at but so they're there and they say y'all my granddaddy he believed that Messiah was coming do you know that my granddaddy almost didn't let his daughter get married because he was so bent on her being the one to bring the Messiah and of course if you're married you're not a virgin anymore and then and then you you know you just kind of done you know prophesy ain't gonna happen through you anymore so it's a it's a merit you know I do believe in miracles it's a miracle I'm here because of the way my granddaddy believed the scripture and you know what his granddaddy believed the same thing and his granddaddy before him believed the same thing and at some point at some point please I mean come on at some point isn't there a statute of limitations to this this it's been 700 years can you count the 700 that's a bit high in it that's a lot of years yeah is there anybody in here and that's 700 years old no no there's nobody here 700 years old 700 years we've been waiting for this prophecy I just you know I I mean at some point guys sitting around here around the well I just you know I just don't know that I can see that this is gonna happen you know at what point do we say oh yeah I just you know I think about this sometime you know I I want my children believe this sin to know this and I believe this is real you know and if I'm sitting there in my hospital bed and I've been telling them Jesus is coming soon they've been hearing they've been traveling around the country hearing me preach this right here and you know hey there's a common supernatural it's gonna happen soon and I hope I have time to get into that a bit but you know and then they're up maybe I'm 50 years from now am I in my hospital bed and you know hey Dad you believe that Jesus was coming yes I still believe it it's just as true today as it was when I was preaching it in West Palm Beach 50 years ago but we are tempted to believe that you know we put times on it sometimes but God isn't putting the times on it and the time has nothing to do with it because God gave a prophecy and God guess what he doesn't have time he's not in time and so 700 years go by and these kids they're there around the well thinking I don't know you know it's been a long time people have believed this and died and believe this and died and believe this didn't died and you know am I gonna be one of those am I gonna believe this and die come on hmm a lot of people have believed in a rapture and have died and gone on before and maybe we're sitting around a well sometimes with some of our friends going you know is this rapture thing really true I mean maybe we should just be you know nice and love one another and you know kumbaya my lord kumbaya kumbaya oh this is church kumbaya I mean don't y'all feel so good when you get done why don't we just go back to that and just you know and just live and be good you know we should just be good to one another that's just that's what God is just asking us to be it's just good no God is asking you to believe in a supernatural event that's coming it is coming and just as it came to Mary and Mary witnessing these these young people sitting there around the world talking and saying I don't know my granddaddy and his granddaddy believe this and it hasn't happened guess what maybe your granddaddy believed this that Jesus was coming maybe his granddaddy believed it he's and they're dead but guess what it is going to happen it happened to Mary and it's going to happen to you and that's what I'm asking you to believe this morning is it's going to happen to you but a supernatural event a catching away a rapture is going to take place in your life so Joseph and where we were asking you know well how I you know what what would put Mary in the attitude in the condition to be able to accept this and so maybe they had that conversation and then she's walking home with Joseph and saying you know do you Joseph do you believe this for seeing they begin to talk about the scriptures and Joseph began to say oh I believe it Mary I I know it's been a while but God's Word has never failed and then they just began to talking and their faith begins to rise up you know because they were just speaking positively about the word and they were confessing the Word of God and saying I believe in it brother Branham says you know the reason an angel came to her home is because she had prepared her home let me let me read that so I don't just mess that up so bad if you want the honor of an angel visiting your home have a home ready for him to visit prepared and ready under the blood of the Lamb angels of the Lord come to such places you see the angels of God love to come to a home that's prepared haumai prepared is how about this home right here is this home prepared for an angel of the Lord to honor a visit - have you been speaking about the Word of God have you been you know having your conversation about the Word of God have you been confessing and allowing your heart to believe the things that God is asking you to believe because an angel of God can come and visit your home that's that's what I want I'm thankful that an angel of God has at least his voice now we brother madam says have to believe the impossible I'll try to hurry here we have to believe the impossible to see new life amen you've got but when you believe the impossible the doctor says you've got cancer you're dying you you've got to believe the impossible to see a new life take hold of you now amen if the doctor says you'll never walk you've got to believe me impossible to see new life come into you new life in them fibers and all God bring forth a new hand a new arm new lungs new stomach whatever it is God will do it if you take him at his word now she had no evidence of it at all only his word oh I like that I think right now stop just a moment I don't preach to everybody that lives right on the highway I have to go down Elaine sometime to pick up somebody so you know we want to see new life right old things have passed away all things have become new we want to see new life take place on the inside we're gonna have to believe the impossible you know brother Branham said about Abraham you know as Abraham's taking Isaac you know the promised son up to offer him on the on the on the mountain he said God was taking away every evidence from Abraham god that's that's not fair that's not very nice it's hard enough to believe you as it is you know at least you could give us some evidence you know but think about Mary Mary highly favored the Lord Holy Ghost is going to overshadow you and you will conceive a son it's never happened before she goes oh oh yes I feel I feel something kicking yes oh yes sir mr. Angel is that how it went no no evidence you're gonna have a son amen don't feel nothing no evidence do you have an evidence that there's gonna be a rapture you have an evidence amen you have faith my brother amen that's the only evidence you have you don't have any physical evidence Mary didn't have any feelings she didn't have anything going on but she was asked to believe the impossible so that new life could take place on the inside of her you're asked to believe that this word this old quaint archaic unscientific not culturally acceptable you're asked to believe this so that new life can take place on the inside of you believing the impossible yeah it should be impossible to believe that a guy like me a sinner all kinds of problems it should be impossible that a God would desire that I would be his child that I would be his servant but he did but he did and he desired you too and the angel comes to you and says here you go here's the Word of God no evidence but here it is are you gonna believe it what's your attitude see Mary had cultivated an attitude of faith her and Joseph had began to discuss the Word of God and they believe the Word of God so then an angel comes and she's ready to just say okay I believe the Word of God I'm not doubting it let it happen no evidence okay be it unto me according to your word and new life new life came forth so she's just an 18 year old girl living in a town she's scorned loli she probably felt like a pebble on the beach maybe sometimes you feel like I am just a pebble on the beach I am just a little piece of sand just nothing you ever feel that way that's what Mary really was Mary didn't come from West Palm Beach you know big place happenin warm lovely place really Mary's in Nazareth I mean this isn't a good place Hail Mary blessed art thou amongst women thou has found favor with God Oh church hail blessed are you among the people for you've found favor with God you've believed for eternal life God's given you the baptism of the Holy Ghost right this Messenger will be a true Messenger of God the Holy Spirit which is God's message that's from Mary's belief church hail you have found favor with God that's the first thing this angel is saying to you you have found favor with God Here I am I am an angel of God and I am speaking to you to tell you that you have favored the very fact that an angel of God has come by your home and spoken to you shows you one thing that you found favor with God you had an angel come by and you've got favor with God you've got favor Church you're highly favored you're justified you're sanctified called elected already qualified oh I don't know what I'm doing but somebody should have just started shouting here just a minute you know when it when an angel of God is come by your home and said you are highly favored me I'm highly me are you talking about was it somebody else so no you're talking about me yes already glorified seated in heavenly places - is who we are Church all it that let God just start welling up some faiths are believing that I my god God sent me an angel and it shows that I'm favored with God oh my love that don't you love me and found favor with God the desire of my heart is I just want to please him the God didn't made me I want I want it I want to be found in his favor yes absolutely what a wonderful place to be I sure don't want to be in is this favor you found favor with God and Here I am and asking you to believe something to believe the impossible and when you do you say oh yeah be it unto me according to your word it's impossible but let it happen to me new life begins to take place this is the Christian experience this is what we want isn't it Church a new life new life old things passed away I'm new now this is what we want and we can walk around going yes I'm favored I'm favored y'all just know what's coming next I think that must be what it is because you get to you realize that I'm about to switch things and then kick you in the teeth because you know that marry that highly favored of the Lord you know she she she believed the word she said be it unto me according to thy word new life took place and then a few months later a new life is was taking place and a few months after that new life is is taking place she's highly favored and there she is you know you know she believed the word it kind of changed her walk just a little bit you know suddenly he sees she's forgive me sisters I'm probably killing that but you know but believe in the word changed the way she walked but the more the word in her begins to mature the more she began to change how she walked amen the more the Lord begins to mature in your life the more you believe the impossible the more it's gonna change how you walk the things that you used to do you're not doing them anymore I used to bend down and pick those things up but I don't I don't bend down anymore that's just too hard I can't change is how she walks the word should change how you walk hey men all in a C and as the word begins to change her life because remember she's highly favored of the Lord and so then she believes it new life is there it's absolutely what we want but it begins to change how she's walking and as it begins to change how she's walking there she is that the well and she's talking to her friends and then her friend's mom comes out and says Mezen and says you know oh I don't know some other names Sarah come here oh yes mother what do you want it's just like have you um notice something different about Mary that didn't notice yes mom I don't want you hanging around girls like that you know she doesn't have a husband and I don't want you coming under her bad influences I don't want you doing anything like what she's doing excuse me Mary here highly favored don't you want to be my friend because I'm highly favored of the Lord don't don't go anywhere near her okay you begin to shun her she's not your friend anymore you you can't be like her so she's highly favored Lord but nobody knows it why cuz it changed the way she walked when the word of God began to manifest in her life began to change the way you know I mean the things that she used to wear that that were kind of tight they just got to be too tight and she had to put something on that just wasn't so tight does anybody I mean you know it changed the way she walked what she wore once she couldn't wear anymore why because she was carrying something precious and if you're carrying something precious oh my goodness it's inside what the precious thing is inside and you don't have to be like doll yourself up in all different kinds of ways and why cuz what's pressed you're already highly favored and I don't care how you want look that I want you to understand that the Word of God in your heart is more blessed and being favored having favor with God is better than anything else that you could ever desire so you just can just change the way you walk you can change the way you dress and if other people are saying no don't don't hang around them anymore I don't want you along around their influence and look don't try to change things so that you can have them come back they'll never until the God changes their eyes they'll never see what's inside of you and who cares what they see what's on the outside of you because those people have totally missed totally missed the event that happened totally missed that that supernatural that take that has taken place and when you believe God you've done something you've changed my life you've sent me an angel be it unto me according to your word new life begins to take place you begin to mature in that it begins to change the way you walk and change the way you dress change the way you live and Friends that you wants head begin saying you are weird you are wrong you are you know you know what you are you're a hate-filled bigot in that in that what we are church I mean in that what they say just a bunch of hate you know uh you you you hate me because the way I dress that's not what I said at all you're a bigot you you think that some people dress you know better than others well you know if that's what a big it is then I guess so but it ain't me it's God's Word he tells us how to live and it's for our good and so they begin to look at you and think you're a hateful bigot because you're a Christian and you you you don't tell them that their truth is just as good as your truth because that's ridiculous but you realize that this word is truth and so they begin to pull away from you they begin to shun you that you begin to find that the friends you once had you don't have anymore and you know but you know Mary I mean if we're talking about the Blessed Virgin Mary here of course Mary reacts to that the same way any devout Christian would react you know my friends all hate me now they all think that literally I'm a prostitute now and they don't want anything they actually think I'm evil when actually everything about me is just the Word of God coming forth you know but they think I'm evil for it and they all hate me for it and but you know what I am the Blessed Virgin Mary and that doesn't bother me a bit you're kidding you're kidding yourself it hurts it's hard it was hard for her there may have been times and there really was times that she just she just wanted to get to a normal spot you know this this this change that happened her and this man what a wild ride she went on you know down to Bethlehem and away to Egypt and suddenly events were taking place changing faster than she could even feel to react to him and maybe at some point in time it got to a placement you know can Oh Lord I just kind of want to live a normal life here you know you've you've really changed a lot for me so she wasn't looked upon his blessed she wasn't looked upon as highly favored now but she came to a place then and imagine how she must have felt you know through all of these trials that she went to but she knew that as things matured those evidences finally came and you're gonna have evidences you know okay they're really they really hated me now but I can see God doing something in my life but it got to a point point that there Mary is and Joseph in there back in Jesus is 12 and they come to the temple and you know they have the sacrifice and then they leave and Jesus is there in the temple and they can't find him and then they go back and they're searching in three days later they they find him in the temple with the with the scribes and and teaching and and things like that and so what does she come and she says you know Luke 2 verse 48 when they saw him they were amazed his mother said unto him son why hast thou dealt with us behold thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing he said unto them how is it that ye sought me wist ye not that I must be about my father's business you see sometimes we just want normal you know we get a little callous to the supernatural to the things happening in our lives and we just Lord can it just be normal for a literally can it just be me and Joseph in Jesus and we kind of have a normal family for just a little bit you didn't sign up to be normal can I say this way you didn't sign up to be just natural you signed up for supernatural things to take place in your life but it's been so long I mean that prophecy yeah it's been so long it's been a long time for Mary gonna be it's been a long time we've waited not seven hundred years about seven hundred years as it was for Mary but two thousand years brother Trevor two thousand years Jesus told us he was coming back about two thousand years ago about two thousand just start counting you know one day we're gonna be here a while it's a long time maybe sometimes as we're waiting for that to happen we just kind of want things to be normal we don't want people to despise this we don't want you we just want normal but the Word of God but the Menem says corrects that error brother branham say says i want you to say god how thankful we are that our religion is not false how could you accept signs and wonders and say that your religion is no more than mohammedans the Muhammadans have a psychology and teaching they're all bible buddha does and all of these but this proves christianity is the truth proves then that if these things are true christianity unbelievers are condemned to doom to die without repentance so every sinner repent of your sins you may go to church but if you're not a believer one hundred percent the baptism of the holy ghost resting on you you get right with God tonight I want you to I want to tell you Church these things are true and it doesn't matter the time delay doesn't matter it didn't matter in the days of Mary and it doesn't matter in your day that it's going to happen that this is truth and we know it's truth and and there's just you know look if you're gonna if you're gonna run away from this if you're gonna run away from this it has nothing to do with truth for you you could people want to say that well it's not true it's not this it's not that no you just don't want it just go ahead and admit it to yourself right now I just don't want that because you can't unsee the things that we talked about in that Sunday School class if you see those you can't unsee those things you it just it just it's plain it obvious why cuz its truth its truth god vindicating it that is the truth and so so realize that it if you're saying look I want truth man I I just want to know what's true well you know I I told my brother-in-law I said well look here you've been searching for truth and he gave me this book about from this atheist you know he's like you oughta you know you ought to try reading this you know you maybe you should search for - truth - I said okay give me this atheist book by Richard Dawkins oh yeah Richard Dawkins yeah he's one of the good ones right I mean he's like yeah I mean this guy's really an atheist you know he's like you know prophetic atheist you know I mean he's the you know he's the man he's the Evangelist of evangelists of atheist evangelism right you know the religion of atheism this guy is the premier guy yeah let me read his book and I got about halfway through it and I just he was just so whiny that I just wasn't it I just couldn't see what he was saying but it was just like look this dude has issues I mean he's just he's as whiny and I just can't take any more of his drivel at least be happy about what you don't believe so I I gave my brother-in-law gave him this book I said look you know I gave him case for Christ he knows the message I wasn't gonna throw a message book at him aside he knows that so look there's case for Christ you're just just the truth that Christ is real there's there's no reason not to believe in Jesus Christ and and that's another sermon I could preach that I'd love to preach but we're not going to but you know how just how true the New Testament is and that you can believe it and if you can believe the New Testament you can believe the Old Testament and there's just there's really more reason to believe that Jesus Christ lived died and rose again then there is to believe that Julius Caesar ever walked the face of this earth and that's that that is from just a learning like archaeological standpoint so so anyway I said look it you know you're searching for truth this guy was searching for truth - maybe you should read his book sat on the Shelf because it was nothing about truth he wants to say that you you wanna say I'm searching for truth and but never read this well you're searching in all the wrong places and some at some point in time we realized you're not really searching for truth you just don't want it you just want it my way now brother Branham says now if this is what we have here Paul was saying this to his Hebrew audience how should we neglect this great salvation he says now they didn't have tape recorders today like we got here but they had scribes who was sitting there taking it down just as Paul was preaching it and that's what it is right here we're getting it by tape recorders these tapes go around the world to see to show it at its truth our religion is not in vain it's absolutely the resin resurrected Lord Jesus Christ same thing now we mustn't neglect it see Mary wasn't neglecting these prophecies in Isaiah no and we shouldn't be neglecting this in our daily lives we should not be neglecting this we should be listening if God saw fit to record that seventh angel we should be listening to that well that should be that should be part of our lives there's coming something he's telling us about it how you think about Mary you think like how maybe she would have like you know a month later to just have heard what that angel said again to just play it back what did he say again now well how did he say this was gonna happen what about this what about that and she probably wished she would have had it but you've got it what time okay 10 to 1 right and that would that says all right let me try to bring this to a close but the book of James says what is your life remember the salutation came to Mary and she begins to ponder it and go what is this why what is this so what is your life James says go to now you that say Tim today or tomorrow we will go into such a city and continue there a year and buy and sell and get gain whereas you know not what shall be on the morrow for what is your life it is even a vapor that appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth away for that you ought to say if the Lord will we shall live and do this or that but now he rejoice in your boastings all such rejoicing as evil therefore to him that knoweth to do good and do with it not to him it is sin so what is your life because you've come you're here in the service near you're being asked to think about yourself in the grand scheme of eternity you're being asked to think about is there or is there not a an event that is coming and soon soon coming that is coming to take us away in a supernatural way so Who am I where am i what is my life in context of this you know it's we're here we're here at the end of the year look back over 2018 what have you done what is it about why am i standing here why am I sitting here this morning what is my life I'm hearing these things is it true why am I here let me ask you a question how many of you can tell me the name of your great-grandfather three four five your great-great grandfather that's pretty good okay some some people have done some ancestry.com you know it's the only way I could tell you but most of you can't tell me a great-grandfather that lived like a hundred years ago they probably don't know where he was buried what his name was who his wife was I mean you know it was really critical that he lived on this earth for you really really critical kind of an important person for your life and you don't know his name or where he's buried guess what the Lord tarries you're gonna be a great grandfather someday will they know well they know well they know where you're buried well they know your name you know people buy life insurance you know it's like well you know what's gonna have any when you die well I'm not really gonna die will you just bought life insurance well yeah I mean just protect my family you know what is your life what's the point what's the purpose what are you doing if you're not found in this you have no answers for that and James here is asking the question you don't know what's gonna happen tomorrow what's your life it's a vapor it appears for a little time vanish it away nobody knows your name where you're buried for that you ought to say if the Lord will we shall live and do this or that but he now rejoiced in all your postings and all such rejoicing is evil you know you guys you have hurricanes here and you recognize the power of nature we had an earthquake about 200 miles it was a 4 number 4 on the Richter scale earthquake about 200 miles into Illinois from our house it felt like our house lifted up went like that and slammed back down and guess how big I felt I mean just like I can't get my fingers close enough together to recognize that we put so much emphasis on me Who I am and fail to realize what's going on around us fail to realize what the Word of God is doing in our midst fail to realize the supernatural element that is all around us and I'm not just trying to be you know super spiritual oh my it's all around you and but to recognize this said something this said something and it's going to happen and if I can do one thing this morning is to just put something just a little seed in your heart that says is this truth and if this is true then what's my responsibility to that truth what I'm asking you to believe is that God that with God nothing is impossible what I'm asking you to believe is that for your life that rapture that we're talking about that coming supernatural that's not impossible that it's going to happen to you that you should believe it'll happen to you now you should say believe being on to me according to your word I'll change the way I walk I'll change the way I dress I don't care I'm thankful that I'm favored enough to hear the word of God and say be it unto me according - the word for with God nothing shall be impossible and I'm getting out of here so I hope that as you're eating lunch today cuz you're probably all starting to think about lunch and if you weren't you're not you are now and you know says you're chewing what is my life am I here for a cheeseburger I mean I'm eating the cheeseburger right now but is that what it's about I mean is it about cheeseburgers or is it about something else because I can eat a cheeseburger today and tomorrow I'm gonna forget and the next day I can eat a cheeseburger and is that what it's about is just sitting here going the thing and doing that and doing this and or is it because there's something supernatural that's going on oh I I don't I don't have the time this morning I preach too long already can I can I just I just real quick I want them Hosea and I know I'm kind of skipping around here but Hosea chapter 6 and verse 1 and 2 now this is a prophecy - Israel come and let us return of the Lord for he hath torn and will heal us he had smitten he will bind us up after two days he will revive us in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight now this prophecy of Hosea speaking to the Israelites is in 780 BC we know that a day on with us or a day with the Lord is a thousand years to us right okay so he says two days he will revive us in the third day he will raise us up 780 BC this prophecy goes forth with a time element now and if we if we can understand it correctly we could always be wrong and have some things wrong but 780 BC 2018 I can't do that math but let's see here 2017 when I wrote that was 27 97 now of course we can do 360 day calculation and find out that it's two hundred two thousand eight hundred and twenty-five well what does that tell us but we're within 200 years of Israel being revived and we'll talk about that more on Monday but but we're within 200 years and it didn't say after the third day he shall raise us up know this prophecy that Hosea gave to the Israelites was after two days he'll rise us up in the third day in the third day which day are we in if a day with God as a thousand years to us and worth two thousand eight hundred twenty-five years into it we are in the third day the third day doesn't have much left there's just a little bit you think well that's just pretty obscure you know you can you could say you could come to me and say well that's pretty obscure prophecy brother Trevor it's like okay let me give you Daniel let me give you Daniels vision yeah you know well how many do you want how many of you want cuz I can I can lay them down if you want me to you know we could be here for another three hours and then you know be thinking about dinner too and lunch and I'm not gonna do that to you but how many do you want that I could take this Bible and I could show you so many ways that we are so close to the end and this is just one of them where the Bible has hey you know we'd look at Daniels vision man you know okay Babylonians then the Medes and Persians then the Greeks then the Romans and then you know that all happened before any of that you know that it was all prophesied before any of that actually happened it's like boom Bible's true deny it and I mean nobody denies that that that prophecy absolutely came to him to pass nobody there's so much so many ways that we show this Bible is absolutely true shows us history is you know how God has just shown what history was gonna happen before it even happened oh my and we're here we have another prophecy saying within two hundred years now I know I'm not gonna live to be 200 you know for another 200 years but it's within the third day it isn't after the third day it's within the third day guess where we are guess where we are within the third day Church there's a coming supernatural as it came to Mary though many around Mary may have doubted it because 700 years oh my here we are today having those same conversations maybe not around a well but maybe around the water cooler at work is it really gonna happen is Jesus really gonna come back yeah yeah yes prophecy after prophecy after prophecy has come to pass it came to pass in Mary's life and it's gonna come to pass in your life and you just gotta you just gotta decide which of the prophecies is going to come back come to pass in your life that one that we read at the beginning that we which are alive and remain shall be caught up to meet him in the air those of us that are looking for us coming just like Mary was looking for his coming Simeon was looking for his coming and I was looking for his coming there was those that we're looking for this coming there's gonna be a people looking for his coming they're gonna be taking up to meet him in the air and that prophecy is gonna come to pass it doesn't matter what you think about it it's coming to pass that train of God's Word is just rolling and I'm almost done that train of God's Word is rolling it's coming to pass and that's coming to pass soon or you could be one of those standing there Lord Lord have not I'd this that depart from me I never knew you you're gonna fulfill Scripture one way or the other but you're highly favored enough this morning to come within earshot of the Word of God the message all I've done is just preached to you the message that brother Branham brought us your your your favored enough not just not because it was me but because it's the Word of God you're favored to hear it so what's your reaction you're at you you rise to close a 20-18 here what are you gonna what is this you're gonna mean in the grand scheme of eternity it can mean everything to you if you receive the word and you say Lord I believe the impossible will happen in my life amen maybe the musicians could come let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord you spoke this morning and we recognize where we're at we can see it Lord and Lord we recognize these things our truth though it seems fantastic though Lord it seems impossible but yet you are the god of the impossible Lord Lord we want that new life to take root and be birthed in our hearts or move on us now let your spirit is we just worship for just a little bit let your spirit come and minister to each heart I ask that you take these words Lord and as it says in your word that you'd accomplish the thing you sent it to do I ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and that's your word be born let you people in a manger of my heart let it live in me let its turn live inside this house of clay and movin everyday that you were people in a manger is there a better key I don't know I'll stay the same with it okay let you were people in the manger of my heart let it live in me let its time I live inside this house of clay and mold every day let your people in a manger of my let's overworld baby in the manger lady me [Music] [Music] in the manger of my heart [Music] I mean appreciate brother Trevor just I thought it was very very fitting just to kind of come in on the end of the sermons that the Lord had given us about nothing being impossible and just the angle you know of you know looking at Mary and how she had to believe God for producing Christ's right and here we are in an age or a time but we have to also believe God for a change of the body I mean one day you could just be driving down the street or or laying in the bed or you know whatever and a change takes place in your body and you know you wonder how could this happen I mean and oftentimes we make so many preparations and plans for so many other things in life but we're not making preparations and plans for this body change frame when we come into true revelation understanding as to what God has called us to and I love the way brother Trevor put that Mary very highly favored but the people despised her right the people looked at are a little different than the way God looked at her and and I'm gonna tell you something when you've really come into a man a true relationship with Christ then you should see people despising you as well can I say it this way if everybody accepts you something wrong those closest to you they still accept you something wrong but but but when you're really coming to relationship with Christ people don't want that everybody don't want that only very few don't want that so when you when you find that everybody just got no problem with you something wrong somewhere I remember as he was saying that you know Mary got a new walk her dressing changed a clothes change when a winner when a when a woman is pregnant a cool suppose it changed and I don't know I know nowadays people don't want to admit that they pregnant the clothes that they wear show that to try to show that you're not pregnant we see something different you pregnant you don't need to dress like that might as well say man all right and when you've been pregnant with the Word of God you don't need to dress like that you don't need to act like that you need to talk like that if there's a change really taking place on the inside things should be reflected on the outside I remember the prophets and say as Christ was being formed in Mary so that's when the persecution set in and if Christ has been formed in you some persecution just said him I was blessed today absolutely blessed and I'm expecting the coming supernatural to happen to me because nothing absolutely nothing is impossible with God praise the Lord can we just stand and sing just the course of the song in my life Lord be glorified in my life Lord be glorified with your hands lift it say say him would be glorified me glorified be clarified grrowph I'd say my Oh if we were we qualified today come on say in my life Lord my my low got a big old fine in my in my life lord yes today one more time everybody my life Lord yeah yeah give my life in my life whoa [Music] today allelujah father Dennis is truly our desire we say as Mary said you might not understand oh god that is suppose that people might not understand father how it is to happen it's never happened before Mary Mary looked at us she never even heard the term holy ghosts she never go in the church and heard that term before but the angel said the Holy Ghost will come upon you will overshadow you and he'll he'll cause this thing to come to pass maybe there are some things that our prophet has shared that we have never heard before the angel that God has sent to us in this hour we believe it Lord let us be like Mary let us say as she said be it unto me according to thy word I might not understand all these things but God I'm gonna yield myself to it and I'm gonna allow myself to be changed by the Word of God father maybe we've just been struggling we've been fighting in our minds with these things but Mary would have never produced Christ as she'd not come to a place of complete surrender and God will never never be able to participate in a rapture until we come to a place of complete surrender it's not about just going to church on Sunday but God we're living in an hour in a time where we can expect a body change and God help us to catch this by revelation don't let us miss what the spirit of what was trying to say to us today God we want we want to be ready we want to be ready when you come as we close them out this year God we are getting closer to your return and as as Mary that promise took 700 years before it was fulfilled 700 years maybe people say it's no way it's gonna happen but God yet it came to pass and now this second coming of the Lord we're we're beyond 2000 years well god we've know father that this is the hour this is the season and every day we wake up what we're getting closer and closer to it we heard brother Solomon kind of share that in the song service about us being closer and here brother Trevor comes out and speaks it in a sermon God you're trying to tell us something don't let us miss this Oh God and whatever it takes we want to be ready God we want to be rainy bless your servant pray that you continue to use him for your glory God as he would come back on tomorrow night to speak once more to our hearts Lord use them and help us Lord to really catch a man what what you're what you're trying to get to us help us to catch it father's our prayer Lord as we
