[0:29] Saints I mean I was at the place where
[0:32] there was nothing but despair and ugly
[0:34] faces but I'm just grateful I mean I
[0:40] would steal stuff from her brother
[0:41] smiling well some mostly all know me
[0:45] some might not know me I've been a part
[0:48] of the message for a while but the
[0:51] message wasn't part of me because it was
[0:56] so easy for me to go back and forth
[0:58] because I felt like I was missing
[1:00] something but once the message become
[1:04] part of you y'all wanna go back say the
[1:11] message is part of me

[2:01] all these brothers always been there for
[2:04] me and I mean just like in the beginning
[2:07] in the fall Eve with the seed but Adam
[2:10] was I made the choice to go back
[2:13] I wasn't deceived I knew what I was gone
[2:15] and I chose a good so even in my choice
[2:20] God couldn't curse me but he concurred
[2:23] everything that I did and even through
[2:27] it all he continued a blessing and I
[2:30] appreciate
[2:33] [Applause]
[2:38] see I said the best is in me so late bag
[2:42] I said look at you know even with what
[2:49] you all want to be and you feed on the
[2:52] world you become the world but if you
[2:54] feed on the word you become the world
[2:56] this is the one letter difference
[3:05] I just I did the crime I did what I did
[3:12] I'm not gonna say him like you know
[3:13] sometimes you have to be honest God God
[3:16] analyzed or handled several life I'm
[3:18] sure I didn't I had to be honest then
[3:22] trust me it was nerd I was here because
[3:26] I was like wow up until this point I
[3:30] never thought I was being this place and
[3:33] I was there and I couldn't sit there and
[3:35] say I'm not like that person I like that
[3:38] person but we all made a choice and it
[3:41] got us in that building
[3:42] I know so how I will so I had a choice
[3:47] with my attorney Kang me she came to me
[3:50] she told me I you know first they told
[3:53] me when I got put in there right oh
[3:55] you'll be out in two days
[3:56] I got there to mentor me in two weeks
[3:59] two weeks turned into four weeks I'm
[4:02] like but I know that all it was all I
[4:08] knew while I was in there the word and
[4:11] even some of the deputies everything
[4:13] they said you don't belong to some
[4:15] different ones but they'll be sitting
[4:16] there arguing about the Bible and I'm
[4:17] like that's not right that's wrong
[4:20] [Applause]
[4:22] let me tell y'all I'm like I know I
[4:29] don't but you know you know God took me
[4:35] through a process and he's still taking
[4:37] me to a process he's new
[4:39] I was hard-headed I needed it like you
[4:41] know if I don't strip you with
[4:43] everything your freedom and everything
[4:45] you won't come back so he knew he had to
[4:49] take everything my freedom just
[4:51] everything
[4:53] aha three hots and a cot but this is all
[5:00] I mean I got the opportunity my lawyer
[5:02] came to me and said all right you've
[5:04] been trying to fight it and you're
[5:05] looking at five or seven years in prison
[5:08] or she like we got a plea deal you see
[5:13] like if you if you take the plea deal to
[5:16] plead guilty you can be out tomorrow
[5:18] oh what's the stipulation so she told me
[5:22] the stipulation I said I'm only taking
[5:24] this I only take the plea deal you take
[5:26] it back to the state and say make sure
[5:29] to say that I will not be adjudicated I
[5:34] didn't want on my record so seem like I
[5:37] see they I wouldn't go for I say we'll
[5:40] go ahead
[5:42] so I prayed brain playing oh my god I
[5:45] didn't wanna be like everybody I said oh
[5:48] yeah I'll be all like Lord I deserve
[5:52] this you did this for purpose I see the
[5:54] purpose whatever your will is I still be
[5:58] happy because I deserve so she came back
[6:02] she called me that night before I will
[6:06] be be I said you'll be out tomorrow
[6:08] they took my bunkie I told myself well
[6:30] they took I said yeah so that morning I
[6:34] woke up well that night when I went to
[6:36] bed I had a dream but I had my job now
[6:40] you know you because being a corporate
[6:42] America most of us know you'd be gone
[6:43] for 45 days they ain't got no job
[6:45] there's no so I had a dream before I
[6:48] went to bed that I well before I won't

[6:58] day and my car was sitting in a windy
[7:03] sparking line for 45 days and when they
[7:04] arrested me I was in the Wendy's parking
[7:06] lot so I left my car there I left my
[7:09] keys I left her wallet but I didn't want
[7:11] to take nothing deal because if you got
[7:13] money why they take me so I like office
[7:18] and we say people want to take it in I
[7:19] believe in the concept no I said here
[7:23] we're gonna take this key that's it so I
[7:25] left everything in the car and I have 45
[7:27] days in the parking lot next to a
[7:29] homicide I didn't know what
[7:35] and now I get I gotta get people told
[7:37] they gotta go find it all right over I
[7:40] ain't shaking so I got out I took the
[7:43] bus I'm street
[7:44] I knew my car was I said boy because
[7:47] they give you a bus pass when you get
[7:48] out free bus my god I took the bus down
[7:51] the street and house I was walking the
[7:55] part when I was in nothing in the cross
[8:03] it right there got to my car so yeah and
[8:26] it was 45 days so I spent 40 days in the
[8:29] wilderness and then I got 5 days of
[8:30] Greece
[8:37] so I got my car
[8:40] then I with my dad and my dad say what
[8:43] you gonna do I said well I had a dream I
[8:45] have I had my job he said uh well he
[8:49] said hold on to that he said hold on a
[8:52] GoSee and I gotta get one thing I worked
[8:55] through the process and God I'll show
[8:56] you the end result but he'll never show
[8:59] you the steps that take a hit you have
[9:02] to walk in to truly believe so I went of
[9:07] course the week before I got out my job
[9:10] had just terminated but I can't get
[9:13] discourage I said look I have a drink so

[10:31] have manifested what I needed but like I
[10:35] said that's how I appreciate the steps
[10:36] he showed me the end result but I still

[16:01] brother Jack read these scriptures and
[16:03] I've held on to him ever since that day
[16:06] but it just meant so much to learn the
[16:09] first message coming out was royal
[16:11] priesthood it says wherefore laying
[16:13] aside all malice on dial off hypocrisy
[16:16] dog envy and all evil speaking as
[16:19] newborn babes desire the sincere milk of
[16:21] the word that you may grow thereby
[16:24] if so be
[16:26] we have tasted that the Lord is gracious
[16:30] to whom he come as into a living stone
[16:34] disallowed indeed of men but chosen of
[16:38] God and precious gay also has live
[16:43] installed our middle upon spiritum
[16:45] houses house and holy priesthood to

[16:51] our by Jesus Christ wherefore also it is
[16:54] contained in description behold I lay in
[16:57] Zion a chief Cornerstone elect precious
[17:01] and have that believe of him shall not
[17:05] be confounded until you therefore which
[17:08] believe he is precious but until them
[17:11] which be disobedient the stone which the
[17:13] builders disallowed the same as made the
[17:16] head head of of the corner in a corner
[17:20] any stone of stumbling and a rock of
[17:23] offence even to them which stumble at
[17:27] the word being disobedient swear to also
[17:30] they were appointed but he our chosen
[17:33] generation a royal priesthood a holy
[17:37] nation they could kill you people that
[17:41] ye should shew forth the praises of him
[17:43] who have called you out of darkness into
[17:46] his marvelous light within times past
[17:52] were not people but are now the people
[17:55] of God which had not obtained mercy but
[18:00] now have pain
[18:18] place the morning certainly appreciate
[18:22] brother Garin and just saw that the Lord
[18:25] is doing why do you stand on Morita a
[18:27] quick scripture and then I'll let you be
[18:30] seated a couple of things I just need to
[18:32] say in and we will move on I'm going to
[18:37] Matthew 18 that's one verse actually
[18:48] Matthew 18:18 ladies our Lord says this
[18:57] barely I said to you what subbing each
[19:00] of five on earth shall be bound in
[19:02] heaven and whatever you loose on earth
[19:05] shall be loosed in heaven and the Lord
[19:08] added lessons reading of his bird let's
[19:11] just pray over the word of dr. my father
[19:13] we thank you for they men the ability to
[19:17] read the work that made a holy spirit
[19:19] not just bring something to us
[19:20] spiritually this understanding here

[19:25] strengthened thank you for everything
[19:26] that has happened here tonight and I
[19:29] expect you that would just take control
[19:30] of this fortune or services works in
[19:32] Jesus name we pray amen
[19:34] god bless you can be seated I just
[19:37] needed to quickly to share a couple
[19:40] things with you you know a number of
[19:44] years ago I was I was in church and
[19:50] just a young man certainly going to
[19:53] church but I wasn't saved I wasn't a
[19:55] Christian man I wasn't a Christian I was
[19:57] going to church but I went to a church
[20:00] when I was invited by some friends to
[20:03] church one night and they were playing
[20:05] this movie at the time I believe is
[20:07] called the burning hail something like
[20:10] that and and I went to see this movie
[20:13] and you know when I saw all these people
[20:15] inhale I said lord I don't want to go
[20:17] you know so I need to get my life right
[20:20] and you know that night I went to the
[20:22] altar and I got things right you know at
[20:25] least I thought I'd be all right but uh
[20:27] but by God's grace tonight not the
[20:31] pastor that was a man of that church
[20:35] that night he happened to be sitting
[20:37] here tonight and I'm so grateful
[20:39] a man to see him here tonight
[20:46] [Applause]
[21:02] hold on - and I let it go a man who got
[21:05] swept away with some ups and things
[21:07] there in the world you know but I'm glad
[21:10] he didn't let me drown many he took
[21:13] again a man we're so so grateful and
[21:16] again I want to say thank you to
[21:18] everyone that's come to be a part of
[21:19] these services this has been the first
[21:24] time doing this underneath the tent like
[21:25] this and I feel like it's been a
[21:27] tremendous success
[21:28] a man just the tiniest giving her
[21:31] testimony here just a little while ago
[21:33] and now she gave her testimony and was
[21:36] talking about how the Lord didn't I
[21:38] showed her the pictures around sister
[21:42] steamin called holding act and she was
[21:46] in and inside my happen to be inside and
[21:48] she said brother Jack does that supposed
[21:49] to go to your turn to say yes yes she
[21:51] does to say well I believe you know what
[21:55] she'd just shared and said got a I got a
[21:56] condition here my body and would you
[21:59] pray for me right now because I believe
[22:00] God
[22:06] and so Jimmy is there and other
[22:09] genuinely hands on her appraisal name
[22:11] and unexpected
[22:14] [Music]
[22:35] [Music]
[22:37] start spreading from here four things
[22:40] that happen underneath this tent and you
[22:43] know just I want to quickly a man just
[22:47] share our our our thing a man was light
[22:51] the fire again and you know we took that
[22:55] from a particular pole out in the church
[22:57] age book and you know just something
[23:00] that God's prophet made a statement he
[23:02] was quoting revelation 2:4 says
[23:05] nevertheless I have someone that
[23:06] somewhat against thee because thou has
[23:08] left my first love right and he made a
[23:11] statement are gone alone that he say
[23:14] history keeps repeating itself and the
[23:16] generations of Israel we see revival in
[23:19] one generation only to see fires fading
[23:22] in the next and the third generation
[23:25] members may be glowing slightly but in
[23:27] the fourth there may be no vestige
[23:29] whatsoever of that original flame and
[23:32] when you look at that that situation it
[23:35] seems very hopeless right because when
[23:37] you get down to the fourth generation
[23:39] there's there's just no vestige of the
[23:42] original flame right the thing that the
[23:45] thing that lit the fire the generation
[23:48] before and the generation after that
[23:50] their fires were lit but but when it got
[23:52] down to the fourth generation which is
[23:54] where we are right now when it when we
[23:56] talk about this message Amen this fourth
[23:58] generation they've let the fire go down
[24:00] right and and and but the good thing
[24:03] about this is that it's not left in that
[24:06] condition because the rest of the crew
[24:08] says then car likes to fire again right
[24:13] so there comes a time where we we will
[24:16] see a man the the the the original flame
[24:21] I believe God can light the fire and
[25:13] that's what this is all about it's just
[25:15] been spotted yeah tell your neighbors
[25:17] just gonna start just
[25:21] man but I'm not going to take too much
[25:25] time a man tonight I want to I want to
[25:30] just focus a little bit on something
[25:32] here III brought this this card with me
[25:37] tonight and man this car represents
[25:40] something here but what what what it
[25:43] happen here we we do outreach there at
[25:46] the church and we had some the place
[25:49] that we go to do outreach we were went a
[25:52] couple of months ago when we were not
[25:53] able to get into the building that we
[25:54] don't do outreach in and they had put a
[25:58] current reader on there and that the
[26:01] door would open less you had a current
[26:02] reader so one of the residents had come
[26:06] down and they just happened to be coming
[26:09] by at the same time we were there and
[26:10] they they said oh we let you in okay but
[26:12] I need to find out how do I get one of
[26:14] those cards myself so I can get in and I
[26:17] emailed the office and they said okay
[26:19] sure you can you know just stop by you
[26:20] can get a card so we went and we got the
[26:23] card you know and the card is what gives
[26:25] us access to the building a man the card
[26:29] is what gives us access a man but but I
[26:32] want to talk on tonight if I can on the
[26:36] subject of override the man override
[26:40] praise the Lord just just bear with me
[26:42] here for a minute a man as I thought
[26:45] about this little thought tonight a man
[26:49] I thought of sometimes our sisters can
[26:54] go to the store a man and shop a little
[26:58] bit and when they they get to the store
[27:03] they get to the clearance rack now the
[27:07] thing about sisters that's different
[27:10] from brothers brothers go to the
[27:14] clearance rack a man they thinking about
[27:16] what they can get
[27:18] right but when a sister goes to the
[27:21] clearance rack she's not thinking about
[27:24] herself but she's actually thinking
[27:26] about the other sisters
[27:43] [Music]
[27:49] dealer price that you just can't pass up
[28:06] social media
[28:18] [Applause]
[28:29] [Applause]
[28:38] [Music]
[29:54] [Applause]
[30:03] because you just experienced
[30:14] [Applause]
[30:20] so I'll just feel tonight that somebody
[30:23] might need an override spiritually God
[30:28] wants to give you an override and I
[30:30] override a work in your favor but if you
[30:32] seek you need an override if you
[30:35] insinuated overrides hallelujah son I go
[30:40] over to God and when you get the
[30:41] override the override works in your face
[30:43] right I was looking a man at this story
[30:51] in John chapter 5 this is the story of
[31:00] the man that was sitting at the Pool of
[31:03] Bethesda yes and and you know everybody
[31:08] can't give you an override the cashier
[31:11] wouldn't have been able to do it right
[31:14] the cashier didn't have enough authority
[31:15] high enough power but but the manager
[31:20] had the ability to be able to give an
[31:22] override right and as seen let me let me
[31:25] also just kind of drop this off because
[31:28] the definition for override a madness is
[31:31] the use of one's authority to reject or
[31:34] cancel a man is the use of one's
[31:37] Authority or and another another
[31:39] definition is to interrupt that action
[31:42] typically in order to make to take it to
[31:46] manual control right so if it's an
[31:48] automated device and you interrupt the
[31:50] action in order to take it to man
[31:52] control because you want to override the
[31:55] automatic action hallelujah glory to God
[31:59] either yeah I think everybody here if
[32:01] you have not experienced the Lord Jesus
[32:03] as your Savior you were going in the
[32:05] wrong direction one day but he gave you
[32:07] an override
[32:09] he walked up with a little bats and he
[32:12] took a strike and your life been
[32:14] different ever since because the
[32:17] override always works in your face you
[32:23] know I mean I just I just all the
[32:25] testimonies that I was here here tonight
[32:27] Saints that experience it overrides
[32:29] glory to God glory to God I mean when
[32:33] brother Gary got his job back that was
[32:35] an override when sister Tanya went to
[32:41] the doctor and she told her doctor you
[32:44] know pretty much before you touch my
[32:45] body this thing gonna be taken care of
[32:48] [Laughter]
[32:59] [Music]
[33:16] illumise from our watch
[33:29] everything looking at this this man and
[33:37] you know we know the scripture tells us
[33:39] here that he was sitting at this this
[33:42] Pool of Bethesda let's read it after
[33:45] this there was a feast of the Jews and
[33:47] Jesus went up to Jerusalem now there is
[33:50] that Jerusalem by the Sheep market a
[33:51] pool which is called in the Hebrew
[33:53] tongue Bethesda having five porches and
[33:56] these lay a great multitude of impotent
[33:58] folk a blind hawk with it waiting for
[34:02] the moving of the waters so the process
[34:04] is to wait for the angel to come down in
[34:06] trouble of water and history tells us
[34:10] that when the waters were troubled the
[34:12] first person to jump into the waters was
[34:15] the person that was healing okay but
[34:18] let's go on here verse 4 says for the
[34:20] angel went down at a certain season into
[34:22] the pool and trouble the water who said
[34:24] with in first after the troubling of a
[34:26] water and stuck I stepped in was made a
[34:28] hold of what sort of a disease he had
[34:30] and a certain man was there which had an
[34:33] infirmity 30 in eight years now the key
[34:36] thing I want you to understand that this
[34:37] man has been in this illness longer than
[34:40] Jesus has been alive this man has been
[34:46] in this condition for a great many years
[34:49] right so so so here you know we can see
[34:52] verse 6 says when Jesus saw him live and
[34:55] knew that he had been now a long time in
[34:58] that case he said unto Him wilt thou be
[35:01] made whole now this is a personal
[35:04] conversation with the Lord Jesus now
[35:06] let's just keep on reading he says verse
[35:09] 7 of the impotent man asked him sir I
[35:12] have no man when the waters trouble to
[35:15] put me into the pool but while I am
[35:18] coming another steps down before me
[35:20] right so first he's saying I need help
[35:22] for somebody to help me but
[35:24] I'm strong enough to counter do some
[35:25] things on my own right so so the problem
[35:28] is the man didn't know who he was
[35:29] talking to right so jesus said to him
[35:31] rise take up thy bed and walk
[35:36] now at first I said then immediately the
[35:39] man was being hope and took up his bed
[35:42] and woke and on the same day was a
[35:45] second and when I looked at this man's
[35:47] condition being there 38 years with this
[35:50] condition and all the times that the
[35:52] angel told no water this man was never
[35:54] able to get into a magma water and have
[35:58] this situation taken care of whatever
[36:00] the situation might have been this man
[36:02] was never able to get that accomplished
[36:04] but when Jesus showed up on this day and
[36:07] being the talk directly with this man
[36:09] what Jesus did was buy a pass process
[36:15] right here
[36:39] [Music]
[36:45] [Applause]
[36:57] [Music]
[37:14] [Applause]
[37:16] to change
[37:29] his name you just think about your own
[37:35] personal testimony yes the window the
[37:37] override this what I call the grace
[37:38] college as we all have experienced it we
[37:44] all needed it the man you were we were
[37:47] all shaped in sin right we were we were
[37:50] born born us in shape to the knick with
[37:53] it we came into the world speaking of
[37:54] life and if you say you didn't come that
[37:57] with you man right now but we need a
[38:03] grease we need an override Jesus Christ
[38:08] is the only one that can give us that
[38:09] look how happy that the cashier can't
[38:11] handle it I need your manager yeah cuz
[38:16] your manager got a set of keys your
[38:20] manager got a coach just type in there
[38:24] and when your manager finish this thing
[38:27] don't change my doctor came to it but I
[38:35] knew Jesus my words could be words but I
[38:40] knew Jesus
[38:41] it gave me override I want to tell you
[38:49] something this override is something
[38:53] that every generation can experience
[38:55] parents if you're believing God for you
[38:58] for you and for you for your children
[38:59] maybe they've walked away from certain
[39:01] the Lord a man named baby you just don't
[39:04] give up on nobody you never know when
[39:07] they gonna get the override car but I'm
[39:11] reminded of the story of had it right
[39:14] and how had it right had given some
[39:16] money in the offering and God's prophet
[39:19] decided to go back and give him out of
[39:21] money saying no she shouldn't she
[39:22] shouldn't give that lady way too poor to
[39:24] have to give money like that and I she
[39:26] said I he said I'm gonna go back and
[39:28] give that lady this $20 this you know
[39:30] within a depression and I'm gonna think
[39:32] this lady should be cheating that she
[39:34] she she's lost a husband yeah just she
[39:37] got way too many responsibilities giving
[39:38] $20 in the offered a I'm gonna give it
[39:40] back and as he was on his way to Holy
[39:42] Spirit told me say now when Jesus was on
[39:44] the earth and he saw the woman coming
[39:47] two pence that he stopped her from
[39:48] giving her two pigs
[39:49] he said no no no he said well if I
[39:52] didn't stop her then don't you stop
[39:54] letting down he says okay okay you know
[39:57] I won't stop and he went to the house
[40:00] and set out and and had a little meal
[40:02] and they said no until God has dropped
[40:04] down in that place where people's face
[40:06] was inside the place we need another
[40:10] Norton right but their faces were in the
[40:14] plates and that was they were in the
[40:16] place just sitting there and he was
[40:17] telling the testimony of how God had
[40:19] allowed him to speak a couple squirrels
[40:21] into existence and rather than a Hattie
[40:24] right criticizing Hattie right said
[40:27] that's nothing but Ruby say the same God
[40:29] that provided a ram for Abraham it's the
[40:31] same God that provided squirrels for me
[40:33] and as lessee said he said he had it and
[40:37] I said that's nothing but the true
[40:38] receipt
[40:38] I'm not too sure if they had it right
[40:40] thus saith the Lord what ever you acts
[40:42] for right now you can
[40:45] she looked around she saw a sick parents
[40:48] she saw sister that was there I've been
[40:51] praying for many times that had been
[40:52] healed and said whatever your acts was
[40:55] she was poor I said whatever you asked
[40:56] me I said what should I ask for sad you
[40:59] say I can't tell you what that's why I
[41:01] don't know I don't know what to tell you
[41:03] x-ray said but I do know this much that
[41:05] whatever you act for you gonna get right
[41:07] now whether it was a million dollars she
[41:10] could have had it right then you know
[41:11] and the Prophet couldn't tell her what
[41:13] to ask for
[41:14] right and I'm so she said she said she
[41:15] said well what what I don't know what to
[41:17] ask when she looked around and she
[41:18] solved but two points and then two boys
[41:21] was sitting there just give them yes
[41:23] laughing
[41:24] unconcerned and you know they eat with a
[41:28] tremendous anointing like that they
