[1:45] endures forever amen let's open our
[1:48] Bibles to Psalms 149.
[1:51] foreign
[2:03] 49 it says praise ye the Lord
[2:06] sing unto the Lord a new song
[2:08] and his praise in the congregation of
[2:10] the Saints
[2:12] let Israel rejoice in him that made him
[2:14] let the children of Zion be joyful in
[2:17] their King

[2:21] them sing praises unto him with the
[2:23] timbrel and heart for the lord taketh
[2:25] pleasure in his people
[2:27] he will beautify the meek with salvation
[2:30] let the Saints be joyful in glory let
[2:34] them sing aloud upon their beds
[2:36] I like that let the high praises of God
[2:40] be in their mouth and a two-edged sword
[2:42] in their hand to take vengeance upon the
[2:45] Heathen and punishments upon the people
[2:48] to bind their kings with chains and
[2:50] their nobles with feathers of iron to
[2:52] execute upon them the Judgment written

[3:10] comes out of the Revelation the book of
[3:12] symbols

[3:17] Living God
[3:18] that's been born down in the middle of
[3:20] fanaticism and chaos
[3:22] but she's wound her way through the
[3:24] grime until she's on top of the thing
[3:26] now spreading forth her wings for the
[3:29] flight many shall run to and fro in the
[3:32] people that know their God shall do
[3:33] exploits in that day
[3:35] God's revelation to his church

[3:43] sister Angie used to sing here keep
[3:45] holding on don't worry

[3:51] get at the mystery of God revealed to
[3:53] his church

[53:09] amen we just appreciate the Lord for
[53:13] speaking to us amen just just things we
[53:16] can apply to everyday life and um and
[53:19] and I I was just I I'm watching as we
[53:22] just kind of go through you know we
[53:23] coming to Ephesians five we're coming to
[53:25] Ephesians 6 and so much and all of those
[53:28] chapters uh but as we as we get to
[53:31] coming to the end of Ephesians 4 there's
[53:34] a lot left that that I want to go in
[53:36] especially uh when he talks about grief
[53:39] not the Holy Spirit whereby yeah sealed
[53:42] unto the day of your Redemption and I
[53:45] said we're gonna have to really just go
[53:47] in there and one of the one of the
[53:49] things that I'm going to talk about was
[53:50] in the tape the guide for the random
[53:53] made a statement at the very beginning
[53:54] of that tape
[53:57] um you know and um and it's something
[53:58] that I I took and said I need to add
[54:00] this to my notes uh because uh I think
[54:03] it's just going to be very very helpful
[54:05] I got I got almost like a two-part
[54:07] teaching just on Ephesians 4 30 that I
[54:10] want to bring to you all but I'm just
[54:12] looking forward to it and amen and and
[54:15] we just we're just looking for more and
[54:17] more of God even even on this past
[54:19] Wednesday I just kind of felt God took
[54:21] us through a little cleansing to get us
[54:24] ready for this weekend
[54:26] and uh and that's why he come down in
[54:29] such a special way on last night because

[58:47] faithfulness amen amen I believe it's
[58:50] those times of prayer that create
[58:52] atmospheres like this amen we can never
[58:55] pray too much amen I was um
[58:59] um last night brother Jason was uh
[59:02] sharing a little bit and he was at the
[59:06] men's meeting I shared a quote about
[59:09] um just encouraging the young man about
[59:12] um
[59:13] marriage actually just give me a quick
[59:15] search
[59:16] um put this in just a little something
[59:19] just put that in just a little something
[59:21] probably going to be 24 hits and gonna
[59:23] be the last hit in there that I'm gonna
[59:25] go to here in a second out of on the
[59:26] wings of a dove but brother Jason that
[59:29] made a um
[59:30] a a statement about a quote that I had
[59:33] read at the meetings and we were just
[59:36] encouraging the young men about you know
[59:38] things that you really need to have the
[59:40] Holy Ghost before you get married
[59:42] amen young sisters and young Brothers
[59:45] you need the Holy Ghost before you get
[59:48] married because the Holy Ghost is what's
[59:49] going to keep you in the marriage
[59:51] ain't nothing but the truth people ready
[59:54] to give up on their marriages but it's
[59:56] the holy ghost that keeps us Amen in the
[59:58] midst of all the trials and things that
[1:00:00] we go through and uh you know I was I
[1:00:02] was reading a quote there at the men's
[1:00:04] meeting and brother Brandon was talking
[1:00:06] to this uh he was given counsel to this
[1:00:09] brother and his sisters telling us that
[1:00:11] you know brother your family is like
[1:00:12] this and sister your family is like this
[1:00:15] and uh and saying the problem is your
[1:00:17] son got both of these things crossed up
[1:00:20] in him the genes from your family and
[1:00:22] the genes from this family came into
[1:00:24] this boy now he's Double Trouble
[1:00:27] right and it just it's just something
[1:00:29] that passed down through the genes and
[1:00:31] it says the reason that you not the way
[1:00:32] you are like your family system reason
[1:00:35] brother you're not the way your family
[1:00:36] is because the Holy Ghost make the
[1:00:38] difference in you it says and I would
[1:00:40] advise that that boy not get married to
[1:00:42] any girl until he's filled with the Holy
[1:00:45] Ghost
[1:00:46] and you know as I was reading the quote
[1:00:48] I said man and you know brother Brandon
[1:00:50] was talking and and then in the quote
[1:00:51] for the random say that the man raised
[1:00:54] up and and you could see him just kind
[1:00:56] of standing up on the prophet and I have
[1:00:58] you to know my son is this he said yeah
[1:01:01] intellectual he got all of that but
[1:01:03] until you have a birth and experience on
[1:01:04] the inside you better not let them get
[1:01:06] married and uh so as it's been raised up
[1:01:09] I'm just sitting there reading that
[1:01:10] quote like I just can't imagine this you
[1:01:12] know and brother Jason just gave so much
[1:01:14] more light to me last night to say the
[1:01:16] reason this man raised up is because it
[1:01:18] was brother branham's brother and he was
[1:01:20] talking about his nephew
[1:01:23] and talking to his sister-in-law I say
[1:01:27] wow only family will do you like that
[1:01:33] say Amen somebody
[1:01:36] but brother Branham didn't put their
[1:01:37] names out there but but but you know
[1:01:39] it's just it's beautiful when you have
[1:01:41] uh brothers that are just
[1:01:43] um you know that's been around a little
[1:01:44] bit and they can kind of give you a
[1:01:46] little bit more insight on that quote
[1:01:47] and just what what what was going on
[1:01:49] there so I just appreciated a few
[1:01:52] um months ago or maybe even a year ago
[1:01:54] and I'm not sure but I was I was
[1:01:56] teaching on the line because both
[1:01:57] brother Jason and I we teach the uh the
[1:02:00] eight o'clock calls in the morning and
[1:02:03] uh brother Jason's been doing a lot
[1:02:04] longer than I have him and brother Tim
[1:02:06] Calhoun uh they've been working with uh
[1:02:09] this brother that that out of out of
[1:02:11] California that had a desire just to go
[1:02:15] through the Book of Revelations and as
[1:02:16] brother Jason was introduced through uh
[1:02:19] I believe was brother Ernie Nueva I also
[1:02:22] got introduced and you know and as soon
[1:02:24] as I got on like the first time I got on
[1:02:26] the call just to listen brother Jason
[1:02:27] call me out you say brother Jack I know
[1:02:30] you're here but we're not just looking
[1:02:32] for you to listen brother we're looking
[1:02:33] for you to teach I say well praise the
[1:02:35] Lord but uh but I was I was teaching one
[1:02:37] morning you know after I you know we got
[1:02:39] it got going and and I read a quote one
[1:02:42] morning
[1:02:43] uh out of the message on the wings of a
[1:02:45] dove and um and it says so I want to
[1:02:49] just uh just a little something this
[1:02:51] little incidents happen
[1:02:53] he says why they was telling me a while
[1:02:56] ago uh there was a brother perhaps here
[1:02:59] in the meeting tonight that just come
[1:03:01] out of denominationalism coming to
[1:03:03] Shreveport wanted to hear about the
[1:03:05] message
[1:03:06] and it got mixed up they didn't know
[1:03:08] where he was at so he went downtown he
[1:03:11] seen a people gathered he said Is this
[1:03:13] where Billy Branham is going to preach
[1:03:15] he said no it's where Billy Graham's
[1:03:18] preaching by the way of a film he said
[1:03:21] well I'm sorry I got the wrong place
[1:03:26] it ain't Billy but two different last
[1:03:28] names and remember now uh Graham
[1:03:33] g-r-a-h-a-m-6 letters
[1:03:36] hello somebody all right and uh and
[1:03:39] brother Branham kept pointing it out he
[1:03:40] hadn't heard anybody since the days of
[1:03:42] Abraham when God used the man with those
[1:03:44] those letters ham at the end of his name
[1:03:46] and he just kept saying look at look at
[1:03:48] Billy Graham g-r-a-h-a-m six letters
[1:03:52] and he just leave it like that now you
[1:03:54] had to be spiritual and you had to catch
[1:03:57] that brother branham's brother branham's
[1:03:59] last name was h-a-m
[1:04:02] but his name was seven letters
[1:04:06] God was using both of them at the same
[1:04:07] time now you had to kind of catch and
[1:04:09] this man that was going to this this
[1:04:11] church he knew Hallelujah I'm not
[1:04:14] looking for Billy Graham
[1:04:17] I'm looking for Branham
[1:04:19] amen so he says this says well I'm sorry
[1:04:22] I got the wrong place he said he'd come
[1:04:24] up he said no now where can I go Lord
[1:04:26] say to start walking up this Main Street
[1:04:30] I don't know what it is there's a big
[1:04:31] church up here at the end Texas Street
[1:04:33] and there was a big white cross up on
[1:04:35] the church said the Lord told him said
[1:04:37] just keep walking
[1:04:39] so when he got there there was said well
[1:04:41] here must be where it is there's a lot
[1:04:43] of cars sitting around and said a bride
[1:04:46] and groom come walking out of the church
[1:04:48] that was last night there was a wedding
[1:04:51] I've seen it come out the Lord said now
[1:04:54] that's what it is you're coming out of
[1:04:57] denominationalism to enter
[1:05:00] into the bride to go with the groom c c
[1:05:04] so you know I was reading that quote and
[1:05:08] teaching and at the end of a teaching
[1:05:11] typically they asked certain ministers
[1:05:13] just to comp make comments uh on it and
[1:05:16] uh my brother Jason was just sitting
[1:05:18] there just waiting and he didn't know
[1:05:20] whether it was going to get called to
[1:05:21] make comments but it got called on that
[1:05:23] day to make comments this brother I was
[1:05:24] waiting to say this he said this uh
[1:05:26] quote that brother Jack read it says I'm
[1:05:28] very familiar with the quote it says
[1:05:31] because um that was my daddy
[1:05:39] see it's something about when the when
[1:05:42] the word begins to live
[1:05:45] it's not just stories but these are the
[1:05:48] people
[1:05:49] a man that that go along with the story
[1:05:52] and and so when Brothers Jason comes and
[1:05:54] he speaks he's speaking from a personal
[1:05:55] place right and and I believe these are
[1:05:59] the things that help us you know we down
[1:06:01] here in South Florida we're we're
[1:06:02] somewhat disconnected from some of that
[1:06:04] but we believe this message
[1:06:06] right so I love it when God sends
[1:06:09] ministers our way that that can give you
[1:06:11] some more personal insight
[1:06:13] oh Hallelujah church this is a real
[1:06:16] message
[1:06:17] amen it's a real God that we've Fallen
[1:06:19] we came out of denominationalism to
[1:06:22] enter into the bride
[1:06:24] hallelujah amen so I'm grateful to to
[1:06:28] have uh brother Jason Watkins with us
[1:06:31] amen again this morning and uh and and I
[1:06:34] just know that the Lord has something
[1:06:37] good in store and I'm not going to take
[1:06:39] any more time I want him to come and
[1:06:41] just have his way so let's just stick

[1:09:05] atmosphere it's so noticeable Lord when
[1:09:09] you come among God's family Lord
[1:09:11] everywhere I go around the world I find
[1:09:13] that the Holy Ghost produces the same
[1:09:15] kind of believer in every country and
[1:09:18] every culture and every race it doesn't
[1:09:20] matter Lord and we're grateful for that
[1:09:25] commit the service into your hands I
[1:09:27] commit myself both speaker and Here and

[1:09:32] we are in need of today we commit it to
[1:09:35] you now in Jesus wonderful name amen all
[1:09:39] things are possible
[1:09:41] amen praise the Lord mine had a
[1:09:45] wonderful time
[1:09:46] last night and I'm going to invite you
[1:09:50] to Colossians chapter 1
[1:09:52] and I'm just going to
[1:09:56] um kind of move a little bit out of my
[1:09:59] normal way so you'd be praying for me I
[1:10:03] can make things uncomfortable for a
[1:10:04] minister when he has to kind of move out
[1:10:07] of his own way
[1:10:08] and not that we're going to
[1:10:12] cover material that's not familiar to me
[1:10:15] but in the way I'm going to go about it
[1:10:17] okay so I'm just going to kind of step
[1:10:19] out of step out of the norm a little bit
[1:10:21] and I was telling brother Jack I really
[1:10:24] can't remember if I've ever approached
[1:10:27] it this way before I think I have at my
[1:10:30] own church more not really in a service
[1:10:32] per se more of a Bible study
[1:10:35] type of an atmosphere so I was
[1:10:39] encouraged by Brother Jack talking about
[1:10:40] the value of Bible study amen so you be
[1:10:44] praying for me today but we'll let you
[1:10:46] read one verse in Colossians chapter one
[1:10:52] and then we're going to read one verse
[1:10:54] and let you be seated but I'm going to
[1:10:56] invite you to keep your Bibles open
[1:10:58] because we're going to go down these
[1:11:00] verses amen praise the Lord Brother
[1:11:03] Branham used to do that all the time
[1:11:04] when he would take the Hebrews series
[1:11:06] and different things like that in
[1:11:07] Revelation chapter three and four and
[1:11:09] five he would just go like verse by
[1:11:10] verse where that's what brother Jack and
[1:11:12] I do on the call in uh on on on the
[1:11:16] morning uh call in and that uh you know
[1:11:19] that that
[1:11:21] um little service we have there really
[1:11:23] goes all around the world and uh there's
[1:11:26] there's whole churches who play that for
[1:11:29] their midweek service and groups of
[1:11:31] people everywhere so it has really
[1:11:33] blossomed into quite something quite
[1:11:36] amazing let me have the monitor turned
[1:11:38] down just a little bit that's roaring
[1:11:40] back at me just a little bit I promise
[1:11:42] you I won't need it a whole lot once I
[1:11:43] get going
[1:11:45] amen praise the Lord yeah that's um
[1:11:48] that's a little better
[1:11:50] all right so Colossians chapter 1 and
[1:11:55] we'll just read verse 1 Paul an apostle
[1:11:59] of Jesus Christ by the will of God and
[1:12:02] timothius our brother may the Lord bless
[1:12:05] the reading of his word as you have your
[1:12:07] seats and you keep your Bibles open
[1:12:09] please there we want to look at these
[1:12:12] verses
[1:12:14] and I I have notes here before me that I
[1:12:17] believe I'll get to and I want to try to
[1:12:20] tie this into this and the Lord being my
[1:12:24] helper so I'm I'm counting on your your
[1:12:27] longevity today and your patience in the
[1:12:29] word of God and uh white people are
[1:12:32] harder harder to preach to because
[1:12:34] they're always in a hurry they're always
[1:12:36] looking at their watch and uh you know
[1:12:39] brother Branham you know I've got quotes
[1:12:42] where black people are more laid back
[1:12:43] and they're they're they're not you know
[1:12:46] so brother Brown said there's something
[1:12:49] about them they got a quality that white
[1:12:51] people don't know nothing about and so
[1:12:54] amen one thing you're going to find is
[1:12:56] I'm just real amen amen praise the Lord
[1:13:00] so that's why I like brother Jack he's
[1:13:02] just real I can be real around him but
[1:13:04] it is a fact sometimes white people let
[1:13:07] their whiteness get in their way and uh
[1:13:10] so today we're just gonna relax and
[1:13:13] preach the word of God
[1:13:14] all right Hallelujah I knew you'd react
[1:13:17] that way amen Hallelujah
[1:13:23] um
[1:13:24] you know William Booth said one time
[1:13:27] that your days
[1:13:28] at most cannot be very long so use them
[1:13:34] to the best of your ability for the
[1:13:37] glory of God and the benefit of your
[1:13:39] generation
[1:13:41] and you know something friends one of
[1:13:44] the things that become it's really
[1:13:47] Paramount is that we we realize which
[1:13:50] generation we are
[1:13:52] and really the scripture sums it up uh
[1:13:55] well and we find that we are the
[1:13:58] generation upon whom the ends of the
[1:14:01] world have come
[1:14:03] and that's not a cliche that's not just
[1:14:06] a saying that's real and you know Time
[1:14:10] meets prophecy and it has met prophecy
[1:14:13] it intersects with prophecy brother
[1:14:16] Branham said God sends out his word
[1:14:18] might be thought profit or however and
[1:14:20] then it just circles the world until
[1:14:22] time intersects and then brings that
[1:14:25] prophecy to pass and you can't stop it
[1:14:27] you can't hurry it
[1:14:29] you can't speed God up and you can't
[1:14:32] slow him down and you should be grateful
[1:14:34] because you would always get that wrong
[1:14:36] I'm just glad he's in control and he
[1:14:40] starts out here by saying that he is an
[1:14:42] apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of
[1:14:46] God and you know it has to be that way
[1:14:49] and I I I think that you do well to
[1:14:53] remember that when you're thinking about
[1:14:54] the ministry you know when you're
[1:14:57] especially your pastor uh but not just
[1:15:00] your pastor other types of ministry God
[1:15:03] has a full bouquet of various types of
[1:15:06] ministry but but God's servants are are
[1:15:10] set aside they are reserved unto Christ
[1:15:13] and you know you can you as the laity
[1:15:16] and I and I I just hope you will absorb
[1:15:18] this and have an appreciation sometimes
[1:15:21] your pastor or ministers will do certain
[1:15:24] things say certain things and you wonder
[1:15:26] why I promise you they wonder why all
[1:15:29] right and I've had my wife you know come
[1:15:31] home my wife say to me say you know why
[1:15:34] did you do it that way and I would my
[1:15:36] answer is very often I I don't I don't
[1:15:39] know it's not the way I would have done
[1:15:41] it but it was the way I was told to do
[1:15:43] it it's not how I would have done it and
[1:15:46] I don't really I'm not sure why he did
[1:15:47] it that way but I knew better than to
[1:15:50] disobey that voice
[1:15:51] because Servants of God are set aside
[1:15:54] they're reserved unto Christ as a as a
[1:15:57] special core uh of of of expositors of
[1:16:01] the word of God they're gifted to
[1:16:03] rightly divide the word and you know you
[1:16:06] as the laity you can put move do
[1:16:09] whatever pretty much you want you can
[1:16:10] live wherever you want to live work
[1:16:12] wherever you want to work do whatever
[1:16:13] you want you know as long as it's Godly
[1:16:15] but you know ministers they don't really
[1:16:18] get to choose any of that
[1:16:20] your pastor don't get to make any
[1:16:22] choices about his life he don't get to
[1:16:24] choose where he lives he don't get to
[1:16:26] choose where he's pastoring he don't get
[1:16:28] to choose what he says he don't get he
[1:16:30] don't even get to choose what he thinks
[1:16:32] if he thinks a little wrong from the way
[1:16:35] God wants him to think God will God will
[1:16:37] discipline him until his thinking gets
[1:16:39] back right so pray for your pastor pray
[1:16:42] see pray pray for these other
[1:16:44] evangelists and you know brother Willie
[1:16:47] going out on the road pray for him
[1:16:48] because men of God are held under a very
[1:16:52] tight uh regulation by the Holy Spirit
[1:16:55] and things you could get away with your
[1:16:57] pastor can't get away with and so you
[1:17:00] know the Lord will as the Bible says you
[1:17:02] know even concerning Christ that he
[1:17:04] would beat him with many stripes
[1:17:06] and that the the Bible says that Jesus
[1:17:09] learned obedience by the things that he
[1:17:11] suffered see and and that's why you
[1:17:14] you're you're seeing a process and I
[1:17:16] really want to emphasize that starting
[1:17:18] out here today because it is a process
[1:17:21] of growth you're going to see that in a
[1:17:23] number of places we're going to stop in
[1:17:24] these verses and note it make a notation
[1:17:27] to you that this is all about
[1:17:30] progression and this is all about growth
[1:17:32] and this is all there's a there's a
[1:17:35] motive and an objective that God has you
[1:17:38] here for and his word has a motive
[1:17:40] behind it and it's for your good see God
[1:17:44] doesn't always explain his actions to
[1:17:46] you and sometimes he just says to you
[1:17:49] can you thank me for allowing you to go
[1:17:52] through this suffering even if I never
[1:17:55] tell you why
[1:17:57] and sometimes that's all we're left with
[1:17:59] is God saying can you thank me for
[1:18:02] giving you the privilege to prove my
[1:18:05] word by your suffering even if I never
[1:18:08] explain why
[1:18:10] see and so so so we find that that God
[1:18:15] moves in this way and it's all about
[1:18:18] expression and I don't want to get ahead
[1:18:20] of myself because I will real easy
[1:18:21] because that's a passionate topic for me
[1:18:24] we're going to get there so you just you
[1:18:26] just carry on with me here in the word
[1:18:28] of God so in Colossians chapter one I
[1:18:32] want to look uh first at these first six
[1:18:34] verses and you just follow along with me
[1:18:36] so Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ I'm
[1:18:39] continuing from last night on The Living
[1:18:42] Word and so so because it's when we say
[1:18:46] a living word that means it's going to
[1:18:47] live inside of you it's not just
[1:18:50] Doctrine it's going to be an expression
[1:18:51] see all right you can listen you can
[1:18:54] argue people can argue your Doctrine
[1:18:57] they can't argue your experience because
[1:18:59] you had it
[1:19:01] amen you understand so you get an
[1:19:04] argumentative person don't debate the
[1:19:05] scripture they argue with you all day
[1:19:07] long just tell them what God done for
[1:19:09] you because nobody can debate that
[1:19:12] because you're the one who had it now
[1:19:14] they might not believe it you're
[1:19:15] responsible for what they believe but
[1:19:18] they can't argue against it see
[1:19:21] and so so we find that he says here Paul
[1:19:24] an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will
[1:19:27] of God and timothius our brother
[1:19:31] I love this this is very very specific
[1:19:33] to the Saints and faithful brethren in
[1:19:37] Christ which are at colossae Grace be
[1:19:40] unto you and peace from God whose father
[1:19:45] from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
[1:19:48] Christ look at verse 3 we give thanks to
[1:19:51] God and the father of who
[1:19:54] so your father and Jesus father is the
[1:19:57] same father
[1:19:59] you understand that the same way he come
[1:20:02] from God you come from God the same way
[1:20:05] that Christ was in in God you are in
[1:20:07] Christ see amen this is exactly why when
[1:20:11] you go to Matthew 16 we won't turn there
[1:20:13] today I want to keep us right here at
[1:20:14] Colossians but but when you go to
[1:20:17] Matthew 16 and Jesus comes to his
[1:20:19] disciples and said who do men say that I
[1:20:22] am and the disciples said well you know
[1:20:24] some say you're Elias and some Jeremiah
[1:20:27] and one of the prophets and and and
[1:20:29] Jesus that was fine that was a world
[1:20:31] view
[1:20:32] but now like Paul is writing to the
[1:20:36] Saints the faithful Brethren he said but
[1:20:38] who do you say
[1:20:39] it's most important who you say I am the
[1:20:44] world is going to have all kinds of
[1:20:45] opinions about me but I want to know
[1:20:47] what my family
[1:20:49] thinks about me
[1:20:52] and Simon Peter speaks up and says Thou
[1:20:55] Art the Christ the son of the Living God
[1:20:57] and Jesus says it may use an interesting
[1:21:00] Greek word to him he says blessed art
[1:21:02] thou Simon this Greek word blessed
[1:21:04] unfortunately uh sometimes is is
[1:21:06] translated to mean you know fortunate
[1:21:09] but he's not saying fortunate are you
[1:21:12] Peter the word macarius actually
[1:21:14] transliterated means exactly this
[1:21:18] possessing the characteristic of deity
[1:21:23] so it's not about you're lucky it's not
[1:21:26] you won the lottery it's that Peter the
[1:21:29] way you recognize me is because we have
[1:21:32] the same father we came from the same
[1:21:34] gene pool and that's how you know who I
[1:21:37] am the world thinks I'm Beelzebub but
[1:21:40] you know better there's an element down
[1:21:43] inside of you that a prophet would say
[1:21:45] it's the seed Gene of almighty God and
[1:21:51] that is a part of God that is Zoe life
[1:21:54] that's not that's not a gift from God
[1:21:56] that is God
[1:21:58] Hallelujah
[1:22:00] it's one thing to get a gift it's
[1:22:01] another thing to get the giver
[1:22:03] [Music]
[1:22:06] and and and this is how
[1:22:08] Peter this is how I recognize you I say
[1:22:11] thou art Peter because I recognize you
[1:22:13] too I recognize you you recognize me
[1:22:15] this is this is this is God being
[1:22:18] recognized in his people
[1:22:23] so we have this common father he is the
[1:22:28] god he says here Christ which are
[1:22:31] closing Grace be unto you and peace from
[1:22:34] God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:22:37] we give thanks to God and the father of
[1:22:40] our Lord Jesus Christ praying always for
[1:22:43] you
[1:22:44] since we heard of your faith in Christ
[1:22:48] Jesus
[1:22:49] and of the love which you have to all
[1:22:52] the saints
[1:22:54] wow am I about to do something I never
[1:22:56] do
[1:23:02] it
[1:23:04] oh I feel better now
[1:23:11] verse 4 again since we heard of your
[1:23:13] faith in Christ Jesus and of the love
[1:23:16] which you have to all the saints
[1:23:19] for the Hope which is laid up for you in
[1:23:22] heaven whereof you heard before in the
[1:23:26] word of the truth of the Gospel now
[1:23:30] that's an interesting way to say it
[1:23:32] listen look at it again and we're
[1:23:34] building a case now so just keep
[1:23:36] following on you I'm gonna put all this
[1:23:37] together for you these pieces are all
[1:23:39] going to fit as we go all right read it
[1:23:41] verse 5 again for the Hope which is laid
[1:23:43] up for you in heaven whereof you heard
[1:23:46] before in the word of the truth of the
[1:23:49] Gospel now
[1:23:50] there are many versions of the Gospel
[1:23:55] today
[1:23:57] now there's only one truth
[1:24:00] Jesus said I'm the way the truth and
[1:24:02] brother Brandon would always fall back
[1:24:03] on that and say he's his word in the
[1:24:06] beginning was the word it was with God
[1:24:07] it was God and it was made flesh
[1:24:10] and so so we so you cannot disassociate
[1:24:14] Jesus from his word which makes it
[1:24:16] impossible which which which literally
[1:24:19] invalidates the claim of the world today
[1:24:23] who say we have Jesus we love Jesus we
[1:24:27] believe Jesus but they deny the word
[1:24:30] so that you can't you because Jesus is
[1:24:33] his word you can't separate them
[1:24:36] this was this was why the godhead was
[1:24:39] attacked uh right off the bat in the
[1:24:41] early church that's why gnosticism began
[1:24:43] rising up and and they began separating
[1:24:46] Christ from the word they didn't they
[1:24:47] didn't want to see it that way because
[1:24:49] if they believe that Jesus was the word
[1:24:51] made flesh then that meant there was a
[1:24:53] standard for them to live and they
[1:24:55] didn't want to live according to
[1:24:56] Holiness so they they said he wasn't
[1:24:58] really a man he was an apparitioner he's
[1:25:00] an angel maybe or some some Phantom and
[1:25:03] and so and and and ireneus just you know
[1:25:07] put it on him as brother Branham said
[1:25:08] he's very militant he just called him
[1:25:10] the Sons of Satan he didn't play he said
[1:25:13] you're the Sons of Satan and this is why
[1:25:16] John that this it was John arguing not
[1:25:18] arguing but John correcting gnostics in
[1:25:21] the early church when he said whoever
[1:25:23] will not say that Jesus Christ has come
[1:25:25] in the flesh is Antichrist because that
[1:25:28] was a teaching starting to move in the
[1:25:29] church see and it was the first attack
[1:25:32] on the godhead because if you can't
[1:25:34] understand the the relationship between
[1:25:36] Jesus as a man and his father which was
[1:25:40] God if you can't understand that Oneness
[1:25:42] then you'll never understand your
[1:25:44] Oneness if you don't understand his
[1:25:46] position you won't understand yours
[1:25:48] say why because because yours is just a
[1:25:52] continuation of his
[1:25:55] yes this is an unfolding this is an
[1:25:57] expression
[1:25:59] you see
[1:26:00] and so so this is exactly why why you
[1:26:04] have it that way you have Ephesians
[1:26:06] Philippians and Colossians because you
[1:26:08] know Ephesians is is where the is where
[1:26:11] election that's where the bride is is
[1:26:13] called from and then Philippians of
[1:26:15] course deals with the bride and then
[1:26:17] Colossians deals with Christ and so so
[1:26:19] it's it's the it's the it's the one
[1:26:22] church that that Paul never never had to
[1:26:24] make a correction to and so so we find
[1:26:27] that he says here
[1:26:29] you know the word of the truth of the
[1:26:32] Gospel say how many versions would you
[1:26:35] say there are well if we only if we only
[1:26:37] count denominations and various
[1:26:40] organized movements of Christianity
[1:26:42] there's north of 33 000.
[1:26:45] so when somebody says they don't believe
[1:26:47] this message uh I just say okay get in
[1:26:50] line
[1:26:51] just just get in line you're go all the
[1:26:54] way down you're 33 0001 right
[1:26:57] all right so that's fine uh you know but
[1:27:00] but I do believe it all right
[1:27:03] and so you know I hear here's what I
[1:27:05] find and and we find this in people in
[1:27:09] this in this day falling away as we knew
[1:27:11] there would have to come A Falling Away
[1:27:12] there would be people who would rise up
[1:27:14] at the end times saying where is the
[1:27:16] promise of his coming now they're not
[1:27:19] speaking just of his Corporal coming
[1:27:21] where's the promise of his parasia or
[1:27:23] you may have heard it as Perugia it's a
[1:27:24] mispronunciation where's the promise of
[1:27:26] his pariseum because it meant that God
[1:27:28] would come in the form of the son of man
[1:27:30] the word made flesh would move among us
[1:27:33] again and bring a bride into that same
[1:27:35] image
[1:27:36] that's what it that's and that would
[1:27:38] happen before the Corporal body that
[1:27:40] would happen to prepare us to meet the
[1:27:42] Corporal body
[1:27:44] and there would be people say my
[1:27:46] goodness you know I've been in this
[1:27:47] message all these years I'm it's nothing
[1:27:49] but rigor it's nothing but legalism I
[1:27:51] don't want it anymore and and they run
[1:27:54] away from it why because they they never
[1:27:56] got to the point where Jesus said take
[1:27:58] my burden upon you my burden is light my
[1:28:01] yoke is easy my burden is light I'm here
[1:28:04] to tell you once you're born again it's
[1:28:06] your whole desire
[1:28:09] it's not that has nothing to do with
[1:28:10] legalism or trying to be a Christian I'm
[1:28:12] not trying to be a Christian I'm trying
[1:28:14] to I'm trying to I'm trying to not fail
[1:28:16] because I don't want to fail
[1:28:20] and if I fail I repent
[1:28:22] which proves I didn't want to do it else
[1:28:25] why did I repent
[1:28:27] see
[1:28:30] all right so so we find that that what
[1:28:33] happens and here's what I have found and
[1:28:35] then you you see them run off to this
[1:28:37] and that and and I you know my wife made
[1:28:40] an amazing statement you know when all
[1:28:42] that began to unfold in my and when you
[1:28:44] begin to see as they as they leave the
[1:28:47] light and Jesus talks about when the
[1:28:49] when your light goes out your darkness
[1:28:52] is now greater than before you had the
[1:28:54] light
[1:28:55] and they backslide they all backslide
[1:28:57] they all immediately the wind
[1:28:58] immediately start cutting their hair and
[1:29:00] start wearing pants and the men start
[1:29:01] drinking and cussing carousing you see
[1:29:03] it all the time and it's not failed
[1:29:05] and and and and that's going to happen
[1:29:07] because it it just proves the nature was
[1:29:09] never changed
[1:29:11] and she made this point she said you
[1:29:12] know their problem never was with a
[1:29:14] prophet
[1:29:15] she said it wasn't with William Branham
[1:29:17] if it had been with William Branham or
[1:29:19] been with the prophet if that was where
[1:29:21] their problem was they would have just
[1:29:22] made a lateral move to some Holiness
[1:29:24] movement and carried on with Jesus
[1:29:27] but you they don't do that they
[1:29:29] literally backslide and go into the
[1:29:30] world and you find that that their
[1:29:33] problem was not with a prophet their
[1:29:35] problem was with sanctification
[1:29:39] the problem was with godliness
[1:29:42] see
[1:29:43] and you know they say well you know
[1:29:45] William Branham you know he was wrong
[1:29:47] about women cutting their hair and
[1:29:48] wearing pants I'm like wait hold it hold
[1:29:51] it stop stop
[1:29:54] women cutting their hairs not a William
[1:29:56] random Doctrine
[1:29:58] that's a Paul Doctrine
[1:30:01] women not wearing pants is not a William
[1:30:03] Branham Doctrine that's a Moses Doctrine
[1:30:06] on the other side you're not gonna have
[1:30:07] to deal with William Branham you're
[1:30:09] gonna have to answer Paul you have to
[1:30:10] answer Moses
[1:30:15] so here's what I am here's what I have
[1:30:17] found too often true
[1:30:19] that when you are trying to be a
[1:30:23] Christian without a new birth
[1:30:26] you will eventually choose the version
[1:30:29] there's many versions you will choose
[1:30:32] the version of the Gospel that you want
[1:30:35] to be true
[1:30:37] not the version that is true but the one
[1:30:40] you wish was true the one that will
[1:30:43] allow me to do this and allow me to do
[1:30:45] that and I can still claim the Lord
[1:30:47] Jesus Christ
[1:30:49] so this is why there's nothing more
[1:30:51] important than being born again of the
[1:30:54] spirit of God
[1:30:57] and it demonstrates itself
[1:31:00] brings the book of Acts alive again it
[1:31:02] absolutely does we're testifying a
[1:31:04] little bit about that last night the
[1:31:06] various things I'm here to tell you
[1:31:07] there's power in the word of God there's
[1:31:10] power when it's believed these signs do
[1:31:13] indeed follow them that believe
[1:31:15] so we've seen the casting out of devils
[1:31:17] and the healing of the sick and the
[1:31:19] opening of the blinded eyes and the dead
[1:31:21] being raised
[1:31:22] we've seen I I was telling brother
[1:31:24] brother
[1:31:25] um Jack last night I said you know the I
[1:31:28] was I was ministering in in Beirut
[1:31:30] Lebanon and by the map my son was with
[1:31:32] me we were in Lebanon you want to talk
[1:31:34] about a surreal moment where they they
[1:31:37] literally said okay we're going to take
[1:31:38] you for a drive and they literally took
[1:31:40] us into the Hezbollah controlled areas
[1:31:43] and I said to my driver what are you
[1:31:45] doing
[1:31:46] and everybody's staring at us and he
[1:31:48] goes oh they're not going to bother you
[1:31:50] and I said really he goes no no he said
[1:31:52] two two American white men driving
[1:31:54] through the Hezbollah he said they think
[1:31:56] your CIA they won't touch you
[1:31:59] I said okay so they think I'm the cia's
[1:32:02] oh yeah they think you're CIA they're
[1:32:04] not gonna they're not gonna touch you
[1:32:06] but we were we were holding a Bible
[1:32:08] study and brother Matt was preaching on
[1:32:11] that very subject on the Holy Ghost his
[1:32:13] preaching on Acts 2 experience and he
[1:32:15] starts talking about about you know and
[1:32:18] they and and these devout Jews that came
[1:32:20] and said how here we every man in our
[1:32:22] own tongue and and and they literally
[1:32:24] heard them speaking in their own
[1:32:25] language and and Matthew as he was as he
[1:32:27] was teaching that the anointing began to
[1:32:30] drop down it got so thick there was
[1:32:32] actually a Catholic priest
[1:32:34] uh in the in the service probably seven
[1:32:37] or eight uh men Lebanese men myself Matt
[1:32:39] an interpreter and four or five other
[1:32:41] men and one of them was a Catholic
[1:32:43] priest in his in his black robes and
[1:32:45] when Matthew got talking about the power
[1:32:47] of the Living God to come in and change
[1:32:48] the life that man got out of his seat
[1:32:51] and dropped to his knees and raised up
[1:32:53] his hands and began to call on the Lord
[1:32:56] he wanted to have that kind of real
[1:32:58] experience
[1:32:59] I'm here to tell you this experience is
[1:33:01] real
[1:33:03] it's not a Doctrine it's a person
[1:33:08] amen
[1:33:09] when when things settle down and we had
[1:33:12] prayer with them and then they wanted to
[1:33:14] have a series of questions and answers
[1:33:16] and I and so the questions were going to
[1:33:19] come to me being the senior Minister and
[1:33:20] I was sitting there the translator was
[1:33:22] here and the men were all sitting around
[1:33:24] me translators here Matthew's right
[1:33:25] there and these men are all around me
[1:33:27] and and right away the man here on the
[1:33:30] right is going to have the first
[1:33:31] question and he starts asking his
[1:33:33] question in in Arabic that's because
[1:33:36] they didn't speak English only the
[1:33:37] translator so we had him and he's
[1:33:39] rattling off Arabic and the translators
[1:33:42] waiting to get enough of a sentence to
[1:33:44] translate it to me because he's been
[1:33:46] translating the whole time but now the
[1:33:48] question starts and when he he's asking
[1:33:50] the question he got about halfway
[1:33:52] through his question and I heard myself
[1:33:54] say yeah
[1:33:57] and the translator stopped said what do
[1:33:59] you mean yeah
[1:34:00] and I said what do you mean what do I
[1:34:02] mean well you you said yeah like as if
[1:34:04] you understood him he said I haven't
[1:34:06] given you the translation yet and I said
[1:34:08] well I
[1:34:10] I understood what he said
[1:34:13] and he said how could you hear
[1:34:15] understand he said you speak Arabic I
[1:34:17] said no and suddenly things got real I
[1:34:20] thought I felt very funny and I said I
[1:34:22] don't know I said but I heard what he
[1:34:24] said I heard his question perfectly he
[1:34:26] said tell me what his question was and I
[1:34:28] repeat it though I repeated the whole
[1:34:30] question
[1:34:31] and he started saying glory to God glory
[1:34:34] to God glory to God I'm here to tell you
[1:34:36] something friends the book of Acts lives
[1:34:40] and I I would be I would be hard-pressed
[1:34:43] to tell you and explain what happened to
[1:34:45] you all I can point back to is the book
[1:34:46] of Acts how here we every man in our own
[1:34:49] tongue and I and when I heard that man
[1:34:51] there was something inside of me
[1:34:52] translating it as it was coming in
[1:34:55] it wasn't a voice over a voice I was
[1:34:58] hearing one voice and I understood it
[1:35:01] don't tell me God's not real he doesn't
[1:35:03] live He's Alive he's here today he can
[1:35:07] meet your need
[1:35:09] thank you
[1:35:10] hallelujah hallelujah sorry we said last
[1:35:13] night you've come too late to tell me
[1:35:15] this message ain't real I already seen
[1:35:17] it
[1:35:18] I've been all around the world with it
[1:35:19] I've seen I've seen the demons uh be
[1:35:22] subject to
[1:35:23] prayer in the word of God
[1:35:28] and so we find here that he says
[1:35:31] so where have you heard before in the
[1:35:34] word of the truth of the Gospel now we
[1:35:36] want the real version right
[1:35:38] not one we won't wish it was the one the
[1:35:40] real one
[1:35:41] which is coming to you
[1:35:44] as it is in all the world now watch this
[1:35:47] and bringeth forth fruit there's the one
[1:35:51] sure ringer that is a sure sign of the
[1:35:54] true gospel it'll bring forth the fruit
[1:35:57] of God
[1:35:59] as it
[1:36:01] as it doth also in you
[1:36:04] since the day you heard of it and knew
[1:36:08] the grace of God in truth there is where
[1:36:13] the grace of God lies is in truth
[1:36:18] if we walk in the light as he's in the
[1:36:22] light
[1:36:23] we have Fellowship one with another and
[1:36:26] the blood of Jesus cleanses us from all
[1:36:28] sin see so now the blood of Jesus it's
[1:36:32] interesting brother Brandon would show
[1:36:33] how that no one has the chemistry of
[1:36:36] that blood that blood ran down the cross
[1:36:38] and bathed the Earth and God claimed he
[1:36:40] baptized in the water under Noah claimed
[1:36:42] it by the blood of Jesus spilling upon
[1:36:43] it and then he's going to come and
[1:36:45] baptize it with fire at the end of the
[1:36:47] millennium
[1:36:48] and make it for our new heavens and a
[1:36:49] new Earth so so we find that it's not
[1:36:52] the physical blood it's not the
[1:36:54] chemistry because you ain't got it you
[1:36:56] can't get it right I don't have it the
[1:36:59] Vatican doesn't have it it's not in
[1:37:00] Israel anywhere there's nowhere the
[1:37:02] chemistry of the blood of Jesus is but I
[1:37:05] have the life that was in the blood
[1:37:08] see
[1:37:10] so so this is that's why brother Brandon
[1:37:12] would introduce us to a bleeding word
[1:37:14] I'll say more on that in a moment
[1:37:17] so the grace so now
[1:37:20] which is coming to you as it is in all
[1:37:23] the world and bringeth forth fruit as it
[1:37:26] doth also in you since the day you heard
[1:37:29] of it and knew the grace of God in truth
[1:37:33] this is this is knowing uh in a
[1:37:36] relationship like a husband would know
[1:37:37] his wife
[1:37:40] you've come into a relationship with
[1:37:42] Christ it's not just a head knowledge
[1:37:44] that's not the kind of knowing that it
[1:37:46] is
[1:37:47] and so we find here that he goes on he
[1:37:50] says now
[1:37:51] all right
[1:37:53] um and he speaks about uh um epipherals
[1:37:56] and the fellow dear servant fellow
[1:37:58] servant verse 8 who also declared unto
[1:38:00] us your love in uh in the spirit verse
[1:38:03] 9. for this cause we also since the day
[1:38:06] we heard it do not cease to pray for you
[1:38:09] and to desire now watch that you might
[1:38:13] be filled with the knowledge of his will
[1:38:16] in all wisdom and spiritual
[1:38:19] understanding that's a mouthful
[1:38:21] now he's talking to people who are
[1:38:25] already born again
[1:38:27] he's not these people have been born
[1:38:29] again for years and Paul is saying to
[1:38:33] them here's my desire for you that you
[1:38:35] might be filled with the knowledge so
[1:38:37] this expression needs to continue it's
[1:38:41] not like God said it met you at an altar
[1:38:43] and said okay you're saved see you in
[1:38:45] heaven see I mean we are going home on
[1:38:49] The Old Ship of Zion but God didn't tell
[1:38:51] you to go down to the dock and sit on
[1:38:53] your luggage
[1:38:54] you understand this is a lifestyle this
[1:38:57] is an expression they're on a journey
[1:39:00] and we're to grow in knowledge and grow
[1:39:03] in wisdom and grow and power and grow in
[1:39:05] relationship
[1:39:07] see this is the continuation of Jesus
[1:39:11] Christ's Ministry
[1:39:14] to be filled with the knowledge of his
[1:39:17] will in all wisdom and spiritual
[1:39:20] understanding now I want you to watch
[1:39:22] The Chain Reaction verse 9 sets off when
[1:39:25] you are filled with his knowledge of his
[1:39:28] will and all wisdom and spiritual
[1:39:29] understanding look at this chain
[1:39:30] reaction what it does to you in verses
[1:39:32] 10 and 11 that you might walk worthy of
[1:39:35] the Lord unto all pleasing being
[1:39:39] fruitful in every good work and
[1:39:41] increasing in the knowledge of God
[1:39:44] strengthen with almight according to his
[1:39:47] glorious power unto all patience and
[1:39:49] long-suffering and joyfulness all of
[1:39:52] that comes from the continuation of
[1:39:55] being filled with all of his knowledge
[1:39:58] and wisdom
[1:40:00] these are the things that it brings on
[1:40:02] you this is how you know you're feeding
[1:40:04] on the right version of the Gospel
[1:40:07] because it fills you with all knowledge
[1:40:11] and and wisdom and and it's the grace of
[1:40:14] Truth and it and and what it does is is
[1:40:17] that it makes you walk worthy it makes
[1:40:19] you pleasing it makes you fruitful
[1:40:21] you're in always increasing in the
[1:40:24] knowledge of God you're strengthened
[1:40:25] with all might how many want to be
[1:40:27] strengthened with all might
[1:40:29] listen not according to your limits
[1:40:31] according to his glorious power
[1:40:34] uh my limits are pretty pretty small I
[1:40:37] don't think that I could defeat one
[1:40:38] devil but I'm told that in Christ I can
[1:40:40] defeat them all
[1:40:42] Hallelujah so it's it's it's not just me
[1:40:45] it's his glorious power unto all
[1:40:48] patience and long-suffering with
[1:40:51] joyfulness oh friends that's the thing
[1:40:54] that'll beat the bitterness Out of You
[1:40:56] When Trials come one after another and
[1:40:59] you're either just come out of a trial
[1:41:00] or you're currently in one or you're
[1:41:02] about to go in one but I'm here to tell
[1:41:04] you don't think it's strange When Trials
[1:41:06] come even the fiery ones because
[1:41:08] therefore you're good they're to grow
[1:41:11] you
[1:41:14] and they'll give you Joy because there's
[1:41:16] joy and there's a satisfaction
[1:41:19] giving thanks unto the Father which hath
[1:41:22] made us meet look at that to be
[1:41:24] partakers partakers so the Bible says
[1:41:27] that we are we are Heirs of God
[1:41:30] however
[1:41:32] that we while we're Heirs of God we
[1:41:34] differ nothing from a servant though we
[1:41:36] be Lord of all
[1:41:38] but we differ nothing from a servant in
[1:41:41] other words I've got all this
[1:41:42] inheritance I'm an heir of God
[1:41:45] but I actually am not reaping any
[1:41:47] benefits as long as I'm only an heir
[1:41:50] but when you become a joiner with Christ
[1:41:53] now you're not just an heir now you are
[1:41:56] are a partaker you're now a joint Heir
[1:42:00] with Christ because you've passed from
[1:42:02] Death unto life you're not just got a
[1:42:04] gene of God running around the world now
[1:42:06] you've been born again
[1:42:08] you're not just an heir of God but
[1:42:09] you're a joint heir of Christ
[1:42:12] see it's a continuation that means that
[1:42:15] you're standing with him and he's
[1:42:16] reaching his hand into the treasure
[1:42:18] chest and you're reaching your hand
[1:42:20] right beside him into the same Treasure
[1:42:22] Chest Hallelujah this is why the Bible
[1:42:25] would say if you say to this mountain
[1:42:27] this is exactly why these scriptures
[1:42:30] come to pass
[1:42:32] because your will is gone you've
[1:42:34] increased in the knowledge of God you
[1:42:36] know you have thus saith the Lord and
[1:42:37] you keep still
[1:42:39] you know the will of God the bride knows
[1:42:41] what he once done with his word
[1:42:47] so he says
[1:42:50] hath made us to be hath made us meet to
[1:42:53] be partakers of the inheritance of the
[1:42:56] Saints in light oh my we're talking
[1:42:59] about that last night oh my he commanded
[1:43:02] the light to shine out of Darkness oh my
[1:43:06] you can paint a pretty picture in the
[1:43:08] word of God and talk about what we can
[1:43:09] be and God and all the things we can
[1:43:11] have and all things we can do but as
[1:43:13] mortal beings and and we're we're so
[1:43:16] aware sometimes so painfully aware of
[1:43:19] our own weaknesses and our own frailties
[1:43:21] and we say how am I ever going to get
[1:43:24] there I see what it's calling for but I
[1:43:25] I can see it in everybody else but what
[1:43:27] about me how am I ever going to get
[1:43:29] there he commanded the light to shine
[1:43:32] out of Darkness the Lord is commanding
[1:43:35] Delight to shine out of Darkness amazing
[1:43:39] see who hath delivered us from the power
[1:43:44] of Darkness
[1:43:45] and watch and hath translated us into
[1:43:49] the kingdom of his dear son all right
[1:43:50] now
[1:43:51] now we're starting to see something
[1:43:53] watch where because now there's a
[1:43:56] kingdom
[1:43:57] oh wow really yeah okay so what's what's
[1:44:00] up with the kingdom a kingdom I mean if
[1:44:03] you don't a kingdom is the people right
[1:44:04] went to a King any good to be a king if
[1:44:07] he didn't have a kingdom
[1:44:09] I understand so that's the whole thing
[1:44:11] that made him a king is he has subjects
[1:44:13] and so there's a kingdom of his son this
[1:44:17] this you know this is why when when they
[1:44:20] come to Jesus and
[1:44:21] you know and they're they're trying to
[1:44:23] make him a king and all you know trying
[1:44:25] to run ahead of the scriptures and you
[1:44:27] know they they can't never seem to get
[1:44:28] it right and and there and and Jesus
[1:44:31] says listen accept a corn of wheat die
[1:44:33] it abideth alone
[1:44:35] but if it die then it'll bring it'll
[1:44:37] come back multiplied see so the
[1:44:39] intention of God was never to live
[1:44:42] bottled up in one man walking the shores
[1:44:44] of Galilee that was never God's plan
[1:44:46] never
[1:44:47] God's plan was always to send that one
[1:44:50] to be their total satisfaction of the
[1:44:52] believer and then by his death burial
[1:44:55] and resurrection and then that life
[1:44:56] returning back into the church his
[1:44:59] ministry could be continued on the earth
[1:45:01] the word made flesh again in a
[1:45:02] many-membered body that's the plan of
[1:45:05] redemption that's the kingdom
[1:45:08] see Jesus when he's being questioned by
[1:45:11] pilate and he says you know they say
[1:45:13] you're a king and you know are you a
[1:45:16] king and Jesus says somebody tell you to
[1:45:18] say that
[1:45:19] but yeah what do I know am I a Jew your
[1:45:21] own people are accusing you and he says
[1:45:25] your Jesus says Thou sayest I am a king
[1:45:27] in other words you're not wrong you're
[1:45:30] correct in saying I am a king Paula said
[1:45:32] because pilate said oh so you are a king
[1:45:34] he said if my if my kingdom were of this
[1:45:37] world my subjects would fight for me he
[1:45:39] said oh so you are a king he said to
[1:45:41] this end was I born right for this cause
[1:45:43] came I unto the Earth that all who
[1:45:46] believe that all who come to me would
[1:45:48] come to the truth and Believe on the
[1:45:49] truth see and pilate such a such a fatal
[1:45:53] question because it's the wrong question
[1:45:55] people miss the right answer because
[1:45:57] they get the wrong question and pilate
[1:45:59] said what is truth what should have been
[1:46:01] who is truth had he just flipped that
[1:46:03] and said who is truthy that had a chance
[1:46:05] but instead he looks at truth as a what
[1:46:07] it's not a what it's a who see
[1:46:10] and so Jesus is making a point here no
[1:46:13] my Kingdom's not yet if my kingdom was
[1:46:16] here my subjects would defend me they in
[1:46:18] other words they would live for me my
[1:46:21] Kingdom's coming
[1:46:22] after the upper room my kingdom will be
[1:46:24] on the earth and then they'll spill out
[1:46:26] and then they'll testify of my kingdom
[1:46:28] they'll testify it'll go from it'll go
[1:46:31] from one Christ to 120 Christ and it'll
[1:46:34] go from 120 to thousands see that's the
[1:46:37] whole Christ means the anointed word
[1:46:40] I mean this is exactly why the the I
[1:46:43] believe it's uh Psalms 27 I believe or
[1:46:46] 127 I can't remember I can't remember
[1:46:48] but children are the heritage of the
[1:46:50] Lord
[1:46:52] remember that yeah happy as the man who
[1:46:55] hath his quiver filled with them see
[1:46:57] because they shall testify they they
[1:47:00] shall have a Victorious testimony uh at
[1:47:03] the day of trial at the courtroom at the
[1:47:05] gate the Bible says at the gate the
[1:47:07] Gateway in the Old Testament in the East
[1:47:08] the Gate of the city was the court
[1:47:10] that's where lawsuits were settled and
[1:47:13] and the and the the the the allegory is
[1:47:16] that a father who's innocent who's a
[1:47:19] good man who's righteous who's who's
[1:47:21] who's who's honest he's being brought up
[1:47:24] on false charges
[1:47:25] and the false charges are that he's a
[1:47:28] liar and that he's a scoundrel and that
[1:47:30] he's he's breaker of the God's law and
[1:47:32] he's not who he says he is but the Bible
[1:47:35] goes on to say happy is the man who hath
[1:47:37] his quiver full of children because they
[1:47:40] will testify the father will never have
[1:47:42] to open his mouth his children his
[1:47:44] Heritage will go to the court and say
[1:47:46] look at my life look at our life our
[1:47:50] life proves our daddy our life proves
[1:47:53] the kind of man that raises us I'm here
[1:47:55] to tell you friends that's why brother
[1:47:57] Branham took preached a trial my parents
[1:47:59] were at that at that service he preached
[1:48:02] a trial and he and he said I'm giving
[1:48:04] Jesus another trial because he didn't
[1:48:06] get a fair trial and he says I'm going
[1:48:09] to give him a new trial tonight and
[1:48:10] there was now a family of God to stand
[1:48:13] on their feet and say he is true and the
[1:48:16] word is true and the word doesn't lie
[1:48:19] and this message is real and the pillar
[1:48:21] of fire is real
[1:48:23] [Music]
[1:48:26] yes sir it was the lives of the children
[1:48:29] their lives testified the father never
[1:48:32] had to say a word wow
[1:48:34] see and so Jesus said if my if my
[1:48:38] kingdom was now my subject would fight
[1:48:39] they would defend me
[1:48:41] amen they would stand for me wouldn't
[1:48:44] keep them they would get martyred but
[1:48:45] that didn't matter God's word was stood
[1:48:47] for
[1:48:48] God's word was proven see that's what
[1:48:51] the continuation of the son of man
[1:48:53] Ministry is it's the continuation Jesus
[1:48:56] was the beginning of a new creation and
[1:48:59] brother Branham said you are the
[1:49:01] continuation of that same creation
[1:49:05] bad
[1:49:06] see we're reading about it here watch
[1:49:08] now let's look at the effect
[1:49:11] verse 13.
[1:49:13] who hath delivered us from the power of
[1:49:15] Darkness
[1:49:16] and hath translated us into the kingdom
[1:49:18] of his dear son
[1:49:20] in whom we have Redemption through his
[1:49:22] blood even the Forgiveness of sins
[1:49:26] see now you're realizing what it means
[1:49:28] to have the pillar of Fire
[1:49:30] because the pillar of fire identifies
[1:49:32] the ministry of the son of man it
[1:49:35] identifies the office and the ministry
[1:49:37] and they're different the office of son
[1:49:38] of man just means prophet
[1:49:40] all prophets were in the office of Son
[1:49:42] of Man Jesus came as son of man
[1:49:44] but the ministry of the son of man is a
[1:49:47] broader term it means the word made
[1:49:50] flesh multiplied
[1:49:52] amen see so though the minister the
[1:49:55] office of a prophet comes God gives him
[1:49:58] his word and and that Prophet when God
[1:50:01] put his word in Moses he the Bible says
[1:50:04] he was God to the people they had to
[1:50:06] Veil his face because they couldn't look
[1:50:07] at him and brother Branham said he was
[1:50:10] that in that state until he spoke the
[1:50:12] word and when the word went out of him
[1:50:14] he said he went back to being Moses
[1:50:16] again
[1:50:17] oh this I'm gonna tell you something
[1:50:18] you're guaranteed not to hear this
[1:50:20] preached an average Pulpit on Sunday
[1:50:21] morning
[1:50:25] that's brother Lee's Famous you're
[1:50:27] guaranteed not to hear this and
[1:50:28] happen on Sunday morning but we find
[1:50:31] that that that this ministry of the son
[1:50:33] of man this is why and and and and this
[1:50:37] is why it takes a profit it takes that
[1:50:38] Pillar of Fire to bring a bleeding word
[1:50:41] listen I've made this point before I
[1:50:42] don't know I made it made it here some
[1:50:44] time ago I don't remember it's a good
[1:50:45] point I'm going to make it again
[1:50:47] but we find that
[1:50:49] that the ministry of the son of man when
[1:50:52] you when you take Moses let's look at
[1:50:53] Moses for an example because Moses said
[1:50:56] the Lord your God shall raise up a
[1:50:58] prophet like me all right so this kind
[1:51:00] of ministry you see is going to continue
[1:51:02] and that'll be Messiah and then when
[1:51:04] that happens then that's coming to bring
[1:51:05] a kingdom all right where God's not just
[1:51:08] going to be above us and not just
[1:51:10] walking with us but he's going to be in
[1:51:11] US Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:51:14] that's the mystery if we got time we'll
[1:51:16] get to it see and so so we find that
[1:51:20] Moses now Aaron in the priesthood
[1:51:23] when Aaron went into the Shekinah Glory
[1:51:26] he had there had to be a lamb killed
[1:51:29] there had to be blood he had to have his
[1:51:31] garments he had to take a bath he had
[1:51:33] everything had to be perfect there had
[1:51:35] to be incense there had to be all of
[1:51:37] this all of this and it's not just pop
[1:51:39] and Circumstance it's all symbolisms of
[1:51:41] Christ and and but if Aaron even though
[1:51:45] he was called thus saith the Lord he had
[1:51:47] a Divine call from God to be high priest
[1:51:49] but if he walked into that Shekinah
[1:51:51] Glory without blood God killed him
[1:51:54] see not that God was a tyrant or wanted
[1:51:57] to do that but God cannot be in the
[1:51:59] presence of sin
[1:52:01] if sin comes into his presence it dies
[1:52:03] you understand he's holy and so Aaron
[1:52:07] had to bring blood to come into the
[1:52:09] presence of the Shekinah Glory but you
[1:52:12] see the office of a prophet is different
[1:52:16] the office of a prophet is not designed
[1:52:18] to just bring God's blessing to you the
[1:52:21] office of a prophet is not designed just
[1:52:24] to take you under the anointing you can
[1:52:25] go to a Benny Hinn service and get under
[1:52:27] the anointing the true anointing you can
[1:52:31] pay your tithes and offerings and don't
[1:52:33] even have to be a Christian you'll get
[1:52:35] blessing you can give the Bible says
[1:52:37] give and I will cause men to give unto
[1:52:39] your bosom these are laws of nature that
[1:52:41] work but a prophet doesn't come just to
[1:52:44] take you into God's blessing it's not
[1:52:46] just about blessing and jumping and
[1:52:48] shouting it's not it's not just
[1:52:50] anointing a prophet comes to take you to
[1:52:54] conduct you into the presence of God
[1:52:58] you understand because he's a holy God
[1:53:00] and you're a sinful man and it takes you
[1:53:02] say but I'm born again well how did you
[1:53:04] get Born Again by the blood of the Lamb
[1:53:06] what blood you don't have the blood it
[1:53:08] had to be the life how did we get the
[1:53:09] Life by a Divine Office a son of man
[1:53:13] Ministry came back in this day just like
[1:53:15] Moses just like Jesus just like Paul it
[1:53:18] was the ministry of the son of man
[1:53:19] because now there is now therefore no
[1:53:22] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:53:28] when Moses went up into the mountain and
[1:53:31] walked in and out of that Shekinah Glory
[1:53:32] and never took a lamb never took blood
[1:53:34] never never had an offering never
[1:53:36] changed his clothes and he lived he
[1:53:38] walked in talked to God left came back
[1:53:40] talked to God and left
[1:53:42] let Aaron try that he's dead man
[1:53:46] and see God said Moses don't let anybody
[1:53:48] break through make sure you keep him off
[1:53:50] this mountain if even an animal touches
[1:53:52] he's got to be killed see God's not evil
[1:53:55] it's just no sin can come into His
[1:53:57] presence but yet Moses could
[1:54:01] you see because the ministry the office
[1:54:05] of son of man is a Ministry of atonement
[1:54:10] this is why Jesus came as son of man
[1:54:12] that's why every son of man it's a
[1:54:15] Ministry of atonement that's who God
[1:54:16] brings Redemption through oh my goodness
[1:54:19] do you understand friends and then he
[1:54:21] says to Moses he says now when you go
[1:54:23] back down he says tell the people and
[1:54:24] Moses said Lord we got it trust me we
[1:54:27] build a fence around this mountain
[1:54:28] nobody can get up here Moses go back
[1:54:29] down and tell them this is important
[1:54:31] tell them not to try to break through on
[1:54:33] me and and he said now when now go back
[1:54:36] down and Moses start turns to go back
[1:54:38] down and God says oh Moses when you come
[1:54:40] back bring Aaron with you and when he
[1:54:42] came back he brought Aaron with him and
[1:54:44] they had no lamb and no blood and no
[1:54:47] offering and no garments but Aaron was
[1:54:49] with Moses
[1:54:50] and he walked him right into the
[1:54:53] presence of God and he didn't die you
[1:54:55] know why because in the mind of God
[1:54:57] Moses and Aaron had no sin
[1:55:00] you say did they make mistakes of course
[1:55:03] they made mistakes but numbers 21 proves
[1:55:05] remember when Balaam tried to curse
[1:55:07] Israel
[1:55:08] and Israel had a laundry list of things
[1:55:10] they were guilty of but the prophecy
[1:55:12] that came through Balaam says he does
[1:55:14] not behold iniquity and Jacob he doesn't
[1:55:18] see it the shout of the king is in the
[1:55:20] camp brother Branham said what they were
[1:55:23] not understanding is they had a Brazen
[1:55:25] Altar and they had a pillar of Fire
[1:55:28] Hallelujah it has conducted you today
[1:55:30] into the presence it has given you the
[1:55:33] Forgiveness of all your sins it has made
[1:55:36] you a part of the kingdom of the Living
[1:55:38] God
[1:55:40] this is what the pillar of fire has done
[1:55:43] for us
[1:55:46] see
[1:55:48] sure we make mistakes but there's now no
[1:55:50] therefore no condemnation
[1:55:53] I'm unindictable
[1:55:54] say you don't you got mistakes not in
[1:55:56] God's eyes
[1:55:58] I can't even be charged
[1:56:00] I can't even he won't even accept an
[1:56:01] accusation against me it doesn't even
[1:56:04] matter if Satan has DNA evidence it
[1:56:06] doesn't matter if he has instant replay
[1:56:08] God will not allow the evidence I mean
[1:56:11] now you know you know where you're at
[1:56:12] now now you're back in Zechariah 3.
[1:56:15] because that's where Joshua the high
[1:56:17] priest
[1:56:18] stood before the angel of the Lord and
[1:56:21] he was seated in judgment it's a trial
[1:56:23] Satan the scene is Satan has brought a a
[1:56:27] lawsuit into God's court now the charge
[1:56:31] is God you said Israel was your people
[1:56:36] and they would be your people forever
[1:56:38] however I happen to know that you can't
[1:56:41] tolerate sin and they're sinful
[1:56:44] and they're Hypocrites and they're
[1:56:46] hiding their sin and they got iniquity
[1:56:49] and that Satan wasn't wrong he had
[1:56:52] Israel dead to rights they were
[1:56:55] absolutely guilty of all of that stuff
[1:56:57] in Satan's charges that once if his case
[1:57:00] is if his case is is held and and stands
[1:57:05] then literally God's Got to Give up the
[1:57:07] kingdom give up the throne and give it
[1:57:08] to Satan because God's word has failed
[1:57:09] and I can't be God anymore all right
[1:57:12] all right
[1:57:13] and he's absolutely I mean Joshua is
[1:57:16] literally standing there and felt the
[1:57:18] garments
[1:57:19] this ain't I mean there's no way to hide
[1:57:21] it
[1:57:22] there's there's no there's there's
[1:57:23] nothing that Joshua can do he's straight
[1:57:26] up guilty and because he's the high
[1:57:28] priest see that's why it's the high
[1:57:29] priest because the high priest
[1:57:30] represents all Israel God the whole
[1:57:33] Israel would have to come stand only the
[1:57:34] high priest had to go in
[1:57:36] so he's standing there
[1:57:38] and God brother Jack the judge as as
[1:57:41] Daniel Simon in Daniel 7 Seated on the
[1:57:45] throne in judgment
[1:57:46] the judge literally
[1:57:49] disallows all the evidence of Satan
[1:57:55] dismisses all his evidence in the
[1:57:57] lawsuit based on one single criteria
[1:58:01] just one
[1:58:03] and he says is not this Jerusalem whom I
[1:58:07] have chosen
[1:58:10] how dare you bring an accusation against
[1:58:14] my family this is my elect Lady this is
[1:58:20] bone of my bone life of my life word of
[1:58:23] my word this is The Offspring of God and
[1:58:27] I will not hear an accusation Against
[1:58:30] The Offspring of God
[1:58:33] case dismissed get out of my courtroom
[1:58:39] he turned out of the courtroom
[1:58:42] say what what Josh would do about his
[1:58:44] filthy clothes he turned around he said
[1:58:46] bring clean garments and take these
[1:58:49] dirty garments off of him and put clean
[1:58:52] garments upon him
[1:58:54] oh Hallelujah and there's Zechariah
[1:58:56] watching his cry writing all the vision
[1:58:58] down and he gets so excited he gets so
[1:59:01] under the inspiration he says put a fair
[1:59:03] miter on his head
[1:59:05] who said that and the prophet's like
[1:59:08] I said it
[1:59:10] and now the Bible says the one seated
[1:59:14] now stood up
[1:59:16] and he stepped forward it's like brother
[1:59:17] Brown said in Book of Revelation he
[1:59:19] stepped from eternity to claim the book
[1:59:21] he was back in there interceding but now
[1:59:24] the same one John only saw one throne
[1:59:26] and the one that was Seated on the
[1:59:28] throne now steps forward and says to
[1:59:31] Joshua I have taken your filthiness away
[1:59:34] and I have put a fair miter upon your
[1:59:36] head because my authority is now going
[1:59:39] to be in you and that's why a prophet
[1:59:41] had the authority to say I no longer
[1:59:43] call you a church I call you the bride
[1:59:47] you've got the the minor of authority
[1:59:49] upon your head why do we let the devil
[1:59:52] push us around you have the authority of
[1:59:55] the word
[1:59:57] God has changed your garments he cannot
[2:00:01] behold iniquity why because I have no
[2:00:04] mistakes no you got loads of them but
[2:00:06] you're under the ministry of the son of
[2:00:07] man
[2:00:08] you're under the ministry of the pillar
[2:00:10] of fire oh Hallelujah friends that's
[2:00:13] what the devil doesn't want you to
[2:00:14] realize that's why brother random said
[2:00:15] when you realize who you are
[2:00:18] that's where your secret of power lies
[2:00:23] see
[2:00:25] so now watch him watch him go here
[2:00:28] he says
[2:00:31] in whom we have Redemption
[2:00:34] through his blood
[2:00:36] even the Forgiveness of sins I still got
[2:00:38] a little time
[2:00:43] in whom we have the Redemption
[2:00:45] have Redemption through his blood
[2:00:48] even the Forgiveness of sins now watch
[2:00:51] now this son that he spoke of remember
[2:00:54] we've been translated verse 13 into the
[2:00:58] kingdom of his dear son
[2:01:00] in whom we have Redemption through his
[2:01:03] blood now we now now we know how we got
[2:01:05] his blood now we know how we got the
[2:01:07] effect of his blood the life came on us
[2:01:10] see God sent a son of man Ministry the
[2:01:13] pillar of fire came to to do what an
[2:01:15] office became a Ministry and that and
[2:01:18] that that means that God can actually
[2:01:20] take the prophet home but the ministry
[2:01:22] continues
[2:01:24] you understand when brother Brandon went
[2:01:26] home the pillar of fire didn't go back
[2:01:27] pillar fire still here it was a pillar
[2:01:30] of fire and that little in that little
[2:01:31] office in Beirut Lebanon
[2:01:34] when I'm literally hearing a man
[2:01:35] speaking in Arabic and I understand the
[2:01:37] words he's saying it's the same God who
[2:01:40] was opening the eyes of that Blind Lady
[2:01:41] 80 years old it's the same God casting
[2:01:43] out Devils of epilepsy from children
[2:01:45] it's the same God helping you to be an
[2:01:47] overcomer in this evil day this
[2:01:49] impossible day this that day of
[2:01:51] Blackness and darkness it's impossible
[2:01:53] and yet here we stand
[2:01:58] so this son the kingdom of this of this
[2:02:00] Dear Son verse 15 the son now
[2:02:04] who is the image of the invisible God
[2:02:07] they're first born of every creature
[2:02:09] watch now so now when when we
[2:02:13] when we begin to look at it this way for
[2:02:15] by him now watch the kingdom of the Sun
[2:02:18] he's the image of the invisible God
[2:02:21] for by him were all things created
[2:02:25] see
[2:02:26] now we're going to understand God's
[2:02:29] secret objective
[2:02:31] it's starting to come a little more
[2:02:33] clear now at this point now these next
[2:02:35] verses Paul is really going to start
[2:02:37] breaking down he he first talks about it
[2:02:39] here in the Kingdom of his dear son oh
[2:02:40] there's a kingdom so it's more than just
[2:02:43] going to be Jesus by himself yeah it's
[2:02:45] going to be a whole Kingdom it's going
[2:02:47] to be a whole family and they're all
[2:02:49] going to they're all going to come back
[2:02:51] to their original Nature by the new
[2:02:53] birth which they have access to because
[2:02:55] they believed the bleeding word
[2:02:57] you see
[2:02:59] this is why there's no Redemption
[2:03:00] outside of the bleeding word
[2:03:03] see the foolish virgin are saved from
[2:03:04] destruction but they're not born again
[2:03:07] and they can't be because they appeared
[2:03:09] the Judgment in Matthew 25 and Jesus
[2:03:11] made a faithful promise in Saint John 5
[2:03:13] 24 that when you've passed from Death To
[2:03:16] Life you'll never come to that judgment
[2:03:17] and there they stand being judged being
[2:03:19] separated so it's obvious that they
[2:03:21] weren't born again
[2:03:23] they were Saints men Sanctified ones
[2:03:26] they were righteous so don't go don't
[2:03:29] don't go out here and point to this
[2:03:30] Tommy rot of modern Christianity and say
[2:03:33] oh I I think that is probably foolish
[2:03:35] virgin they seem so sincere when they
[2:03:38] sing that Christian rock and I see real
[2:03:39] tears flowing down their face that's not
[2:03:41] sanctified
[2:03:43] that's not righteousness the foolish
[2:03:46] virgin are righteous people they're
[2:03:48] sanctified people only they're not
[2:03:50] ordained to to to this message because
[2:03:53] because only the predestinated are
[2:03:55] considered in Redemption
[2:03:57] see in Redemption not wrong we're not
[2:04:00] talking about just salvation Redemption
[2:04:01] salvation a further work of Salvation to
[2:04:04] bring you back Paul said we all at one
[2:04:06] time had our conversation in the lust of
[2:04:08] the flesh things of the world and we're
[2:04:10] by very nature the children of Wrath
[2:04:11] even as others now that's not your
[2:04:14] original nature that's the nature you
[2:04:16] were born with by a fallen birth but God
[2:04:18] rich in Mercy loved us while I was a
[2:04:22] sinner you understand he's restoring me
[2:04:25] back I've been redeemed back to that
[2:04:28] image that I had in the mind of God
[2:04:30] before the foundation of the world and
[2:04:32] he cannot behold iniquity in me
[2:04:35] see
[2:04:38] so he says so now he's going to build on
[2:04:40] it he's going to build on it more
[2:04:42] for he's already talked about the
[2:04:44] kingdom now we've got a kingdom in play
[2:04:45] here let's learn about it
[2:04:48] for by him were all things created that
[2:04:50] are in heaven and are in Earth visible
[2:04:51] and invisible
[2:04:52] whether they be Thrones or dominions or
[2:04:54] principalities or Powers all things were
[2:04:56] created by Him and for him
[2:04:59] and he is before all things
[2:05:02] and by him all things consist
[2:05:04] and he is the head of the body
[2:05:09] the church who is the beginning the
[2:05:14] firstborn from the dead that in all
[2:05:17] things he might have the preeminence see
[2:05:20] when you realize when you talk about
[2:05:22] election people struggle with it because
[2:05:24] they they don't look at election
[2:05:26] correctly they look at election like a
[2:05:29] like a like a biased prejudiced lottery
[2:05:31] pick like we you know back in the days
[2:05:34] of backyard football or pick up
[2:05:35] basketball and you had more players than
[2:05:38] you needed and who's going to get picked
[2:05:39] and who's not and the guys who don't
[2:05:41] have to go sit down that's not election
[2:05:43] election is based on one single thing
[2:05:46] origin
[2:05:48] it's based on Origin Jesus teaches us
[2:05:52] that in Saint John 13 Saint John 15 and
[2:05:54] 16. he says I came from God I go back to
[2:05:58] God
[2:06:00] see Saint John 13 says Jesus knowing
[2:06:02] that he came from God and went back to
[2:06:04] God he layeth aside his garments right
[2:06:06] see and so so we realized that election
[2:06:09] is based on Origin so I why am I a
[2:06:12] Believer because I can't not be
[2:06:16] I know you School teachers that's a
[2:06:17] double negative I'm sorry but I can't
[2:06:20] not be
[2:06:21] uh it's impossible for me not to be a
[2:06:24] believer because it's this word is part
[2:06:25] of me I'm like Peter Thou Art the Christ
[2:06:27] the son of the Living God what do you
[2:06:29] say of this man what what do men say of
[2:06:32] this message well some say it's a cult
[2:06:34] and some say it's this some say but who
[2:06:36] do you say I say it's the word of the
[2:06:38] Living God I say it's the word of
[2:06:40] redemption to call a bride to get her
[2:06:42] ready for a rapture
[2:06:44] blessed art thou church because Flesh
[2:06:47] and Blood never taught you that you had
[2:06:49] your origin in God and you're
[2:06:52] recognizing your family
[2:06:56] [Music]
[2:06:58] glory amen and this is why the Bible
[2:07:02] shows us that you know when people argue
[2:07:04] with you about election because they
[2:07:06] they think of it as fairness and
[2:07:07] unfairness it has nothing to do with
[2:07:08] that there's only one elected son
[2:07:11] Isaiah 42 tells us that the only elected
[2:07:15] son is Christ say well how did you get
[2:07:17] elected I was in him
[2:07:20] as he has expressed what was God the
[2:07:22] expression he expressed himself in a
[2:07:25] pillar of fire then and and he wasn't
[2:07:27] the pillar of fire was in a second God
[2:07:30] it was the same God condescended into a
[2:07:32] form that you could see before he
[2:07:34] dwelled in you can no man could see him
[2:07:36] but now he's in a form that he can be
[2:07:38] seen
[2:07:39] he he was a pillar and that was same
[2:07:41] Pillar of Fire mode when Moses saw him
[2:07:44] he was a fire in a burning bush
[2:07:47] it was a cloud in the day and a fire by
[2:07:51] night that led him when Joshua met him
[2:07:53] he was a soldier
[2:07:56] he's the captain of the Lord's army
[2:07:59] you understand we can get in met him
[2:08:01] he's an angel when we find all of these
[2:08:04] different things happening friends this
[2:08:06] is why it's so important to always know
[2:08:08] where the I am is that's why when he
[2:08:11] said Moses said who will I say sent me
[2:08:12] say I am has sent me in other words
[2:08:15] Moses just say you're me because my word
[2:08:18] is inside you say I am is speaking to
[2:08:22] you I am you've got to know where the I
[2:08:24] am is where is he today he's not in
[2:08:27] denomination he's not in 33 000 versions
[2:08:30] he's in his bride he's in his church
[2:08:32] she's the Living Word of the hour
[2:08:36] [Music]
[2:08:39] who do we have the I am
[2:08:42] Hallelujah
[2:08:48] see now you're catching it see this is
[2:08:50] Paul's case Paul's building his case
[2:08:53] so and he is the head of the body the
[2:08:55] church
[2:08:56] who is the beginning the firstborn of
[2:08:58] from the dead that in all things he
[2:09:00] might have preeminence
[2:09:02] for it pleased the father that in him
[2:09:04] should all fullness dwell and having
[2:09:07] made peace through the blood of his
[2:09:09] cross by him to reconcile all things
[2:09:13] unto himself and by him I say whether
[2:09:16] they be things in Earth or things in
[2:09:19] heaven and then he goes on down and you
[2:09:21] that were sometime alienated enemies in
[2:09:23] your mind by Wicked Works yet now hath
[2:09:26] he reconciled in the body of his flesh
[2:09:29] through death to present you holy and
[2:09:32] unblameable and I love this one an
[2:09:35] unreprovable in his sight oh jump jump
[2:09:39] to verse 26 with me now watch he's gonna
[2:09:42] he's gonna start breaking this down he's
[2:09:44] going to take the next step even the
[2:09:46] mystery which hath been hid from the
[2:09:49] ages and from Generations but now is
[2:09:54] made manifest to his Saints to whom God
[2:09:57] the Saints to whom God would make known
[2:10:00] to the Saints to whom God would make
[2:10:03] known what is the riches of the glory of
[2:10:07] this mystery
[2:10:10] just a secret Doctrine there's a glory
[2:10:13] there's a manifestation to it this thing
[2:10:15] becomes a Living Word a living life it
[2:10:18] becomes a living Kingdom it becomes a
[2:10:21] people who are literally I am the vine
[2:10:24] you are the branches my father is the
[2:10:26] farmer The Gardener the husbandman a man
[2:10:29] his life he planted it all Hallelujah I
[2:10:33] am the vine and you come off of me it
[2:10:35] went from him to me now to you and now
[2:10:37] it goes out into all the world
[2:10:39] it's Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[2:10:48] see the bride is the mystery of Christ
[2:10:51] revealed
[2:10:52] see that's right
[2:10:56] to whom God would make known what is the
[2:10:57] richness of the glory of this mystery
[2:10:58] among the Gentiles which is Christ in
[2:11:01] you the hope of glory
[2:11:05] so when we
[2:11:06] when we look at this this term now I
[2:11:09] want to bring a term to you brother
[2:11:10] Branham uses this term quite a lot
[2:11:12] incarnate or Incarnation and brother
[2:11:14] Brandon talks about it a lot now he's go
[2:11:16] I don't I'm out of time so I'm just
[2:11:18] going to go over these last Parts
[2:11:19] quickly
[2:11:20] but we find that that that this is God's
[2:11:24] way to Incarnate himself in a further
[2:11:27] expression you see this is exactly why
[2:11:31] this is my brother Branham
[2:11:33] when he stood between the trinitarians
[2:11:37] and the Oneness
[2:11:39] and he said frankly you're both wrong
[2:11:43] oh he must be too no brother Graham said
[2:11:45] in Paradox as soon as you think he's too
[2:11:46] you missed it
[2:11:48] see well then what help us to understand
[2:11:51] it it's all about expression see in in
[2:11:55] the formula of the trinitarians in their
[2:11:58] formula they chopped the one God into
[2:12:01] three individual persons
[2:12:04] and that was ancient Babylonian
[2:12:06] polytheism right
[2:12:07] belief in multiple gods
[2:12:10] and they it's uh they you know it's all
[2:12:12] jacked up in the way they say and they
[2:12:13] you know all this one God all in one
[2:12:15] purpose and all this no you got three
[2:12:17] persons
[2:12:18] explain it how you want but at the end
[2:12:20] of the day you got three persons
[2:12:22] you can't have a person without having a
[2:12:23] personality you can't have a personality
[2:12:25] without it being a person
[2:12:27] but the problem with the Oneness was
[2:12:30] the Oneness only saw Jesus only
[2:12:33] their formula didn't include his family
[2:12:36] their formula didn't include his bride
[2:12:39] his church his body the continuation of
[2:12:43] that same creation
[2:12:45] and that's why when brother Branham
[2:12:46] comes to preach the missed Christ is the
[2:12:48] mystery of God revealed he says now it's
[2:12:50] been a mystery and it's been hidden and
[2:12:53] no one has known anything about it but
[2:12:55] and then he comes right around he says
[2:12:57] but he has revealed it and all down
[2:13:00] through the Bible because God has had
[2:13:03] one goal just one goal and all the Bible
[2:13:07] now we know he worked it in stages of
[2:13:10] God above us God With Us God in us we
[2:13:12] understand that he the the first part
[2:13:14] was to to get to display himself in
[2:13:17] Christ the second part in the Ages was
[2:13:20] to gain preeminence in his family and
[2:13:21] the third part was to restore the
[2:13:23] kingdom back to its rightly position
[2:13:24] that fell by sin in the garden
[2:13:26] so I get the stages but it's all one
[2:13:29] objective one goal God's got one goal in
[2:13:32] all the Bible and brother Branham says
[2:13:34] every life you read and all the people
[2:13:37] and all the prophets priests and kings
[2:13:38] and Prophets and apostles and everything
[2:13:40] is all an expression of that one goal
[2:13:44] and where he says then we're going to
[2:13:46] see what it is here tonight in this
[2:13:47] sermon and when you listen on to the
[2:13:49] sermon the whole thing is about God
[2:13:51] expressing himself
[2:13:54] God expressing himself incarnating
[2:13:57] himself into people
[2:13:59] the word incarnate let me give you this
[2:14:03] Incarnation literally means
[2:14:06] embodied in flesh
[2:14:08] are taking on flesh
[2:14:12] it refers to the conception and the
[2:14:15] embodiment of a deity in some Earthly
[2:14:18] form
[2:14:21] Incarnation all right
[2:14:25] or the appearance
[2:14:27] of a God as a human
[2:14:30] if capitalized it is the union of
[2:14:33] divinity with Humanity in Jesus Christ
[2:14:36] in its religious context the word is
[2:14:39] used to mean a god deity or Divine being
[2:14:41] in Human or animal form
[2:14:45] now brother Branham draws a parallel in
[2:14:48] the Book of Revelation
[2:14:49] he says here in the second seal now
[2:14:52] Satan is going has incarnated himself
[2:14:56] from Antichrist to false prophet now so
[2:15:00] the false prophet which is the pope he's
[2:15:02] full of demons they're just placeholders
[2:15:04] he's not the Beast incarnate yet the
[2:15:06] Beast is a power it's represented as an
[2:15:08] animal all right
[2:15:10] and in the days of the Jews as
[2:15:12] Antichrist among the early Church in the
[2:15:14] Dark Ages he become a false prophet
[2:15:16] remember they crowned him in the fourth
[2:15:17] age as a false prophet brother Adam said
[2:15:19] what made him a false prophet is that he
[2:15:21] preached false Doctrine
[2:15:23] brother Brown says that here in a minute
[2:15:25] you're gonna you're gonna hear it you're
[2:15:26] going to hear the how Satan got his and
[2:15:28] its exact same way Satan copying God how
[2:15:30] he got you all right watch
[2:15:33] so he says
[2:15:35] he says he's uh in the Dark Ages he
[2:15:37] become a false prophet to the world see
[2:15:39] here see her there with her cup of
[2:15:42] iniquity nice in the Book of Revelation
[2:15:44] now that's to the church age now but in
[2:15:48] the age after the bride goes home
[2:15:50] remember the bride goes up Satan comes
[2:15:53] down he says when the bride goes home he
[2:15:57] becomes a beast he becomes the devil
[2:16:01] incarnate see the red dragon himself so
[2:16:05] he literally kicks the demons out takes
[2:16:07] moves into the false prophet and the
[2:16:10] false prophet becomes the Beast
[2:16:12] see now that's why it's a it's a it's
[2:16:15] God in a living in flesh of a human or
[2:16:20] an animal all right so you see that the
[2:16:22] symbology in the Book of Revelation why
[2:16:23] it calls him a beast see he become the
[2:16:26] devil incarnate the red dragon himself
[2:16:28] oh my can't you see what I mean he is
[2:16:30] Incarnate in his people then he's got
[2:16:33] his people Bound by his power the now
[2:16:37] here's how they here's how he pulled it
[2:16:38] off the false prophet has prophesied
[2:16:41] them right into it
[2:16:44] that's it you wonder why the world is
[2:16:46] going to believe a lie and be damned by
[2:16:48] it because the false prophet has
[2:16:50] preached them right into it see
[2:16:54] so he says the false prophet has
[2:16:56] prophesied them right into it give them
[2:16:58] over to strong delusions to believe a
[2:17:02] lie and be damned by it denying the word
[2:17:04] with a form of godliness see not real
[2:17:08] godliness just to form and now he says
[2:17:11] here's what brother Brown in the second
[2:17:12] seal God works his place in a trinity
[2:17:17] justification sanctification and
[2:17:20] incarnate himself in his people with the
[2:17:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost
[2:17:25] is not a gift or just an emotion it's
[2:17:28] God incarnating himself in a human being
[2:17:32] see
[2:17:33] so he says same thing the devil is just
[2:17:36] in type after Christ Satan incarnates
[2:17:39] himself when Jesus incarnates himself in
[2:17:41] his people the very life that was in
[2:17:44] Christ is in the person you need to say
[2:17:47] that about yourself today the very life
[2:17:49] that's in this word is in you in the
[2:17:52] very person
[2:17:53] I have God living inside me I'm a
[2:17:56] believer of his word I'm marching to
[2:17:58] Zion I'm a continuation of his kingdom
[2:18:05] see
[2:18:06] so some people they where they struggle
[2:18:09] a lot of times people struggle
[2:18:11] with the you know because the scripture
[2:18:13] when it explains the the humanity of
[2:18:16] Christ
[2:18:17] and of course Jesus wasn't half human
[2:18:19] and half God he was 100 human and he was
[2:18:22] 100 God
[2:18:24] say well that's weird no it's a paradox
[2:18:27] and a paradox is something that can't be
[2:18:29] but it is
[2:18:31] though it can't be
[2:18:32] but it is though it can't be
[2:18:35] but it is
[2:18:37] but it can't be
[2:18:38] but it is
[2:18:41] said it was a paradox in his day on
[2:18:44] Earth when he as a man yet he was God he
[2:18:46] said it's still a paradox today and the
[2:18:49] best way for you to understand it is to
[2:18:51] see it in you because what happens when
[2:18:54] you look at the at the gospels and you
[2:18:57] see the parts where it deals with his
[2:18:59] Humanity
[2:19:00] you know he's standing in the water and
[2:19:02] a voice speaks out of the atmospheres
[2:19:04] and he's praying in the garden who's he
[2:19:06] praying to and he's crying at the time
[2:19:08] at the tomb of Lazarus and you know and
[2:19:10] brother Brown says that was a man weak
[2:19:12] is a man weak when he sit down on a rock
[2:19:13] with a headache and and and he was a man
[2:19:16] who said oh you're going to say
[2:19:17] physician heal thyself because he was
[2:19:19] actually sick in body and there he's
[2:19:20] holding a prayer line himself sick
[2:19:22] and he said oh you're you know you're
[2:19:24] going to mock me and say physician why
[2:19:25] don't you heal your own self see but the
[2:19:27] gift wasn't for him he came he said I
[2:19:29] come not to do my will but the will of
[2:19:31] him that sent me the son of man came not
[2:19:33] to be served but to serve came not to be
[2:19:36] ministered to but to minister see
[2:19:39] and so that's why the Bible says that
[2:19:41] you know when he when he was in in the
[2:19:45] locks of his torment on the cross the
[2:19:47] Bible said he will see his seed and be
[2:19:49] satisfied oh and all of his torment
[2:19:51] friends I like to believe he saw me and
[2:19:53] you
[2:19:54] and he said it's worth it this pain is
[2:19:56] worth it
[2:19:57] but when people read those passages in
[2:20:00] the gospels now hear me I'm closing this
[2:20:02] will make these final points to you
[2:20:04] so when they read these passages without
[2:20:06] an understanding the revelation of the
[2:20:08] godhead being expression they don't
[2:20:10] understand that it's expression that's
[2:20:12] why they miss it because they don't
[2:20:13] understand it's continuation it's just
[2:20:15] further expression of the same God in
[2:20:17] multiple forms you understand and so so
[2:20:20] we find that that when they read these
[2:20:23] parts in the scripture about his
[2:20:25] Humanity just remember this for me will
[2:20:27] you do this remember God doesn't put
[2:20:30] that in there to confuse his family
[2:20:33] that's just put in there to confuse the
[2:20:35] world that's put in there to Blind them
[2:20:38] that's not to Blind you
[2:20:40] the reason it's put in there for you is
[2:20:43] so that it's for you it's a blueprint or
[2:20:47] a road map when it's your turn to be the
[2:20:50] word made flesh
[2:20:52] because that's the mystery coming the
[2:20:56] kingdom was coming and no one understood
[2:20:58] it even the disciples caught him on the
[2:21:00] on the mount on Mount of Olives and he's
[2:21:02] about to ascend and they said now will
[2:21:04] you restore the kingdom to Israel
[2:21:06] they're still not catching it
[2:21:07] and he says that's not even for you to
[2:21:10] know that's in the father you're going
[2:21:12] to go and be and do you're going to go
[2:21:13] and tear and be endued with power
[2:21:14] because the program is carrying on
[2:21:16] now this life that was in Christ is
[2:21:19] going to come back into the church and
[2:21:21] it's not going to be a Mr Jesus it's
[2:21:23] going to be Mrs Jesus because Mr Jesus
[2:21:26] lives inside of her and she's now that's
[2:21:29] what Oneness is so it's not it's not
[2:21:32] it's not a human language to confuse you
[2:21:34] it's human language to give you a road
[2:21:37] map to give you a set of blueprints so
[2:21:39] you know how to live when it would
[2:21:41] become your turn today it's your turn
[2:21:44] it's your turn to be the word made flesh
[2:21:47] it's your turn to go out into the hedges
[2:21:50] and the highways and compel them to come
[2:21:52] it's my turn it's your turn Hallelujah
[2:21:56] hallelujah it's the same word made flesh
[2:21:59] in the people
[2:22:02] see it's incarnate
[2:22:04] it's Christ incarnate in his people
[2:22:08] see brother Branham says it like this
[2:22:11] unless it's my last quote
[2:22:13] he says the in The Invisible Union of
[2:22:15] the bride of Christ
[2:22:17] he says look what kind of sign that
[2:22:20] Jesus himself
[2:22:21] the incarnated God standing there in
[2:22:23] human flesh you say this is when he was
[2:22:25] Melchizedek meeting with Abraham
[2:22:28] you say that was an angel the Bible says
[2:22:31] it was God and that's absolutely
[2:22:33] accurate you go back to the Hebrew and
[2:22:36] the word that Abraham referred to him as
[2:22:38] the Hebrew word he used what is never
[2:22:41] ever ever used in the Old Testament
[2:22:44] unless it means the almighty God
[2:22:47] there's no other usage of that word it's
[2:22:49] always the Almighty
[2:22:52] and he says that was an angel the Bible
[2:22:53] said it was God Lord God Elohim standing
[2:22:57] there in human flesh
[2:22:58] showing that he would so anoint his
[2:23:01] church that's what it was showing that
[2:23:04] he would so anoint his church in the
[2:23:06] last days it be God working in human
[2:23:09] flesh again this is why the world that's
[2:23:12] that's why there's a question who is
[2:23:14] this Melchizedek
[2:23:16] that the world don't understand who
[2:23:18] Melchizedek was I heard we got a we got
[2:23:20] a mega church in our city and the doctor
[2:23:23] of divinity that's on the air
[2:23:24] monopolizes the airwaves won't even
[2:23:26] accept money to get airtime on there I
[2:23:27] tried to buy some air time and he
[2:23:29] wouldn't even sell it to me for money
[2:23:31] hell wow I thought you loved filthy
[2:23:33] looker but
[2:23:35] and you know he says he starts talking
[2:23:37] about Melchizedek and he says you know
[2:23:40] Melchizedek was just a man he was born
[2:23:42] he lived and he died I'm like you know
[2:23:45] do you not do you not read your actual
[2:23:46] Bible I mean my Bible says that he had
[2:23:49] no beginning of days and no ending of
[2:23:52] life and abideth continually I love I
[2:23:55] love how brother Brandon has put in his
[2:23:56] Same Old Kentucky simple English he said
[2:23:58] whoever he was he's still alive
[2:24:02] say what you want but whoever he was
[2:24:05] he's still alive today see and this was
[2:24:09] the mystery this is why the world
[2:24:10] doesn't understand who this Melchizedek
[2:24:12] was because they missed the point of the
[2:24:14] demonstration they're missing the whole
[2:24:16] imagery and brother Branham says what is
[2:24:18] the what is this imagery he says it's he
[2:24:21] says Lord God Elohim standing on human
[2:24:23] flesh showing that he would so anoint
[2:24:26] his church in the last days
[2:24:29] this is why brother Branham would
[2:24:32] constantly go back to that experience
[2:24:34] with Abraham and Melchizedek had his
[2:24:36] back to the Tenon discern Sarah's
[2:24:38] thoughts of her heart and brother
[2:24:39] Brandon would turn his back to the
[2:24:41] audience and do the same thing he's
[2:24:43] showing the Church of the last day this
[2:24:46] has repeated
[2:24:48] and you're it you're it you're in this
[2:24:51] has repeated it's God made flesh again
[2:24:55] and the world misses it it was in the
[2:24:57] Sodom days of Sodom so shall it be in
[2:25:00] the coming of the sun man same kind of a
[2:25:01] thing they see it right there in the
[2:25:04] scriptures oh we see it right here in
[2:25:05] our scriptures don't we friends we're
[2:25:07] not wondering about the meaning of life

[2:25:37] mystery it's a mystery to the world but
