lease it man good to see brother saw Jay amen today [Music] just quickly I'll just make a few announcements a man and before we would just get started in the word of the Lord today we we want to continue to do what we what we have been doing Amen with our services no service on Friday for right now but Sunday's we'll continue to do our virtual service 9:00 and twelve for those that have to watch online but those are able to make it you know your scheduled service say man you can certainly be part of that and also don't forget Wednesday nights I will be here to a divergence service as well don't forget to download the new church app [Music] as we're transitioning there so just go there to your app store and find the church after then look for spirit of tabernacle I also just wanted to just mention amens we just prepared for our time of offering this I'm gonna I guess pandemic or whatever it certainly has generated just a lot of other expenses that the church didn't really anticipate having to undertake and one of those has been we had to buy a new computer just to do streaming and we finally got the computer running to spot the way the reason y'all don't see the other I Pat here is because we have both our Facebook and our periscope stream running through the same computer and so we're doing all that now and there was you know a few brothers stepped up and just we didn't bring that need to the church but a few people just stepped up and just really took on the expense of getting a new computer and and I'm grateful for that but I did just want to mention to the church there's still some more work that needs to be done when it comes to this and one of those things that we we actually had to purchase a new cameras not that's not in place to start yet but we will have it installed probably this week we had the purchased in the camera now our whole thing goal is to try to improve the experience for everybody that's watching online and you know there's a lot of upgrades that we need to do there with the with just a video system and and what we want to do is I wanted everyone if you could we have these envelopes here on our on the table for now so those that are coming into the sanctuary if you don't mind just taking the envelope and just putting something in it we we kind of estimated that our expenses a man for the video would probably cost us roughly $4,000 for everything that we want to do and you know that's our goal to try to raise $4,000 to in order to do two things that we need to do so if you don't mind just taking an envelope and putting something in and helped us towards that goal four thousand dollars we will improve our entire online experience if you're not here in church and you want to help us Amen with that you have two ways that you can give you can give online a man through cash app if you want to sip something say hey this is to help with the video upgrade just you know send us something in there let us know what it's for we'll make sure it goes in the right account you can use cash app with cash sign severe than 50 or you can use PayPal and you can use just give to friend or family member and that's giving at John four to three or gets the email address that you use that should give so we're just thinking God for everything that he has done they man that we believe that whatever he whatever is been presented to us will overcome every challenge that comes our way we're trusting the Lord a man for for every need to be men and when he's done it before so we know he can do it again we have no doubts in our God we got complete confidence to him it may bless us with this keyboard and we did not have to take from our regular expenses or even from my building fund we just stepped up tinned it what we need to do so I want to encourage the church if you can just help us say man again this time I trust that we can get this done and that'll be in day man so for now praise the Lord so unless let's pray amen of our giving amen at this time father we just thank you for the opportunity that we have to worship you even through our giving the Lord how you have proven them provided Lord in so many ways we could never ever repay you for your goodness and for your mercy that you have rendered to us God has we just bring our tithes and offering to the house to the Lord as you told us in your word to do so we actually to a continue to repeat the Devourer for our sake continue Lord to open doors that we can't see continue to providing wings that go beyond expectations or moved by your spirit upon every need I pray that you bless your people Lord abundantly thank you for their faithfulness Oh God and just exit to give back to them one hundredfold as they get from their hearts in Jesus name we pray a man a man and a man praise the Lord God bless you thank you musicians appreciate you all on today I want to read a man to passage of Scripture if we could just stand to our feet we'll read the word of the Lord on today I am entering back into our journey as we've been talking from the beginning of the year there's a just kind of talking about stepping into the vision and there is just just kind of bringing piece by piece of a particular vision that the angel Lord gave the prophet that the Prophet wrote 1962 is when he shared this vision and and what I'm seeing is a lot of things that the angel told him to write we're seeing the manifestation of that even right before our very eyes 1962 was written and and here you know it's right before so I have been the Lord just placed in my spirit just to kind of keep bringing portions of that vision amen before the church so that we could we could stay in line and step in to what God has for us so I want to read from the book of a man there's only one chapter in the book of Jude and then also I'll read from revelation 18 amen Jude as chapter 1 and which is only one chap and I'm gonna start at verse 11 here in the book of Jude praise the Lord here the scripture states woe unto them man this is a warning the man one to them for they have gone in the way of Cain a man this is a warning that the Holy Spirit is given and this this warning is actually for the time in which we live right now right this is not a scripture for some other day but this is being fulfilled right before our very eyes and if and if we're not careful we'll miss what the Holy Spirit is actually doing in front of us what the Holy Spirit does does not get headlines you understand only what the devil does get headlines but what God is doing does not get headlines only the spiritual people will understand what God is doing so the scripture says woe unto them for they have gone in the way of Cain and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward all right and perished in the gainsaying of korah these are spots in your feasts of charity when they feast with you feeding themselves without fear carried about of winds winds trees whose fruit withereth without fruit twice dead plucked up by the roots raging waves of the sea foaming out their own shame wandering stars to whom is reserved the black of Darkness forever amen let's also just read over here in the book of Revelation chapter 18 and verse 4 praise the Lord just one quick verse there in Revelation 18 as we just look at this glory to God revelation 18 and verse 4 it says this it says and I heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues Amen the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word let's just bow in a word of Prayer a man this morning father we thank you again for the ability to read scripture but we know it takes the Holy Spirit to bring clarity to the things that we read this John just wrote here he heard a voice from heaven saying come out of her my people God may we hear that same voice this morning speak to us so real in your word and help us Lord God to draw closer to you not just those that are here present but those that are streaming a man and streaming the service and watching me the Spirit of God speak to them right where they are and god I just pray that you just do a mighty work in every heart in every life it's in Jesus name that we pray amen and amen god bless you you can be seated and the presence of the Lord praise the Lord I just want to take for a title on this morning simple title God's choice a man God's choice praise the Lord I want to just start by reading a man just a couple statements here from God's prophet the first witness coming out of the message this great warrior David a man this great warrior David as we talk about this subject today God's choice he says this now the men here in the city wants to become religious a man the men here in the city wants to become religious the the first thing he will hunt for is one of the biggest churches he can find in this city so when people trying to draw closer to God that maybe maybe a little tug in their heart they feel like they need to you know they need to you know I need to get into church I need to do something you know because you know I know God is dealing with me I know that and so typically what happens when a man is in that conditional woman's in that condition the first thing they will heart forward it's not going to church the first thing that hunt for is one of the biggest churches he can find in the city with all the crucifix hanging all around and the great stained windows and the plush pews and and everything that's where he thinks he finds God because it's big a man he think he can find God there because it's big and maybe he may be a dignitary maybe the celebrity does go there but that doesn't mean that God's there hallelujah Amen it might be a big church they might have accomplished a lot but it doesn't mean that God is there usually God's choice is a little omission down here on the corner somewhere where they're beating a tambourine clapping their hands sometimes that's where God's acts hallelujah amen if you just go back to Scripture Amen Jesus was not born in a nice plush hospital room a man Jesus was born in and I stable they had to put them in a manger he was born with some small place Jesus amen will be found all right look usually God's choice is a little old mission down here on the corner somewhere where they're beating the tambourine clapping and sometimes that's where God said that's right see by the human side the humanistic spirit they look for that big bright shiny something and jump at everything they see shining amen but all that glitters does not go you can remember that he met him then so he you know he tells us that so everything that shining Amen don't mean God is in it just because some big huge Amen church don't mean that God said they just know how to raise money y'all yes yeah I'm just I'm be honest with you there's an art to it and people study the psychology of people a man so they know how to get your heart string there tell you about great projects that they got going on with their feeding the hungry and they're doing this and they doing that and they show you pictures a man of kids that are starving in Africa hallelujah if you ever go to Africa you will find out that pictures not true right amen glory to God so you know they know how to just count on a pool on your psyche and get money to do the things that they want to do now some of that money does go to the kids but a lot of it go to the bank all right church it's the truth in behind amen but this is just because you see a great grand and all this don't mean God is actually in it hey man one of the one of the churches that got more money than anybody else in the world is the Catholic Church don't mean God is in it a man actually according to Scripture the Catholic Church a man represents the Antichrist according to Scripture praise God so if you look at the God in there you're gonna miss him he's not there all right all right all right let's go on all right let's start this this message a man taking sides with Jesus man the Prophet makes a statement here and says God respects anybody who is sincere I love these statements that is making God respects anybody who is sincere now I'm using that but I also want to just just try to make you it make you see you can't be sincere and you can also be sincerely wrong hallelujah glory God but because you are sincere God respects that they matter that he's obligated I feel to try to bring truth into your past because of your charity you can be absolutely wrong the contest work but because you're sincere he's respecting that and he brings truth into you now God does not force you to accept truth you have to be the one to say yes I agree with that yeah you're a man say I agree with the Word of God God is a gentleman he never forced himself on anybody all right look at this God respects anybody who is sincere Peter said that he perceived that God was no respect of persons all nations calling when on the winner on that House of conveyance when they received the Holy Ghost like they did at the beginning see God is no respecter purses we see a person deeply and sincere he can be sincerely wrong but if he sincerely God will lead him to the light somewhere he will come to it because gosh I don't get it to do that now you know i'ma just share this when Peter went to the house of Cornelius a Canadians was so sincere that God sent an angel to Canisius house tell him go send some service down to a certain address you're gonna find Peter there hallelujah Peter's gonna come and preach the gospel to you and and I think the questions that you got in your heart they gonna be answered by this man Peter now you know our angel came to Kinesis and told him exactly what to do because of it his sincerity he got a visitation from an angel hallelujah amen he did exactly what the angel said do went down there got Peter went to the exact address they brought Peter forward to him but you know where went when Peter showed up to the house and all his sincerity he still did something wrong he dropped down on his knees and began the worship Peter hallelujah Peter I just said you don't worship me but you worship Jesus and I want to tell you this morning we're not worshipping nobody else but Christ amen we're not down on our knees to no other man here glory to God glory to God will quote a prophet but we're not bound on these sub prophets a man just like I can quote peel them I can quote Paul I can quote our prophets for this thing man alright stay with me here it says and we think about the coming of the Lord being such a great thing in the message no more than a Swint remember there's a predestinate group to be here when the Lord returns it says it might not be over a dozen see we don't know it might be a hundred it's the message sent of God which we believe it to be I say amen to that now I'm going further I'm going further so we talked about God's choice let me just give you a couple examples a man from the very beginning of time God made choices God made choices and in a story of Cain and Abel God's choice was to accept the sacrifice that Abel brought that was God's choice and not only that not only did he accept it but he told Cain if you will give me this the very same thing that your brothers given me I will accept it the problem is it just was not in pain to do what God was asking him to do hallelujah and sometimes it's just not in people to do what God is asking them to do but for the protest nations they will hear it and they will believe it they will accept it somebody so sure from the very beginning of time God's choice was a man he wanted the worship that Abel was bringing Abel took a bleeding bloody lamb and he offered it to God where where Cain was offering the fruit of the ground the very thing that got cursed Cain is bringing us back into the presence of God expecting God to accept it you just can't give caught anything and expect him to accept it God tells us what he wants a manner we have become God's provider way not our way if we want it to be accepted another thing from beginning in in Scripture God's choice was that Abraham would have a promised son through Sarah Sarah thy wife shall have a son God's choice was Sarah a man but Sarah offered Hagar God did not acts rahaga God says Sara Sara has some problems in her body God's choice with Sara amen not hey God God's choice he meant another choice Amen that got me was so similar prophet to lead the children of Israel God God wanted to be let God wanted to speak to a property he had sent me on the scene and they hadn't had a divorce the Lord I've been I mean it hadn't been a been around for years for centuries they they were they were without without having a man that could hear from God so finally God sent Samuel the scene and Sam is leading the people in and out of battle doing all kind of great things but the people chose that hey we don't want Samuel to lead us I mean we don't want God to lead us through a prophet we want a king God's choice was through a prophet the people's choice was through a king and every time the people make their choice their choice is always different than what God's choice is what we want to do today is get ourselves in alignment whoa what is your choice what is your word I want to align myself with what the Word of God says Amen I miss you see that there's a way that seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways to pass we want to what God's choice is a man another another thing was when Jesus died and a man he had itself twelve disciples and you know they decided that I'll you know do this winning hunk itself a man Judas was a chosen disciple Jesus picked them up and use them in ministry but he had a very specific purpose he had to be the one to sell Christ out but after after Judas did what he did the disciples said we gotta find another amen disciple to take Judas place now what they decide to do is it's kind of cast Lots in and try to find a certain man may pick Matthias I believe brother Branham say you can't find one scripture by Matthias Amen and the rest of the Bible he never did nothing that was that was man's choice but God's choice at that time was go get Paul the one that was condemning Christians a man the one that was considered go get soul of Tarsus he is my choice I have a work for him to do glory to God God's trust always goes against popular opinion God's choice always goes again how the people feel and what the people think but we must align ourselves with God's choice I want to bring out a couple more things they meant another choice that God made will see chose Moses to lead the children of Israel and you know this is why we read the scripture here in and Jude because you know the people got got messed up in and some things here here God chose Moses but but what they went up to the gainsaying of korah the Bible says they went up to the the gainsaying of Korah and and I'm going to get a little deeper into that in a second but but the choice a man was Moses to lead the people and Moses being a prophet was the one to lead the people to work came to the Prophet the Prophet brought it to the people praise God and that is what was supposed to lead the people back in Moses day Amen God Himself wanted to come down and speak to the people and when he came down one time and spoke the people got so afraid they say Moses no longer let God speak but you speak for God so since that time God has been speaking to a prophet to his people people say they want to hear the voice of God some of us can't even handle the voice of God i'ma just be honest with you you can't even have if God came to you and spoke in its first to you directly you might not even gave it a handle the voice of God one one sister amen she was in a meeting brother Brandon was praying for some people and he was a little weary and tired and and you know and and and she just you know where he just you know he just kept going kept doing what the Lord called me to do so this sister was sitting there in the meeting and and and and and the angel Lord showed up to the sister came while she was sitting there in church out hallelujah why are you sitting here you know you can hear from an angel angel could come to you right why are you sitting here and speak to you this was sitting there in the age of the Lord she saw him I mean stops all of his speeches and and then angel or saying see my servant there yes say he's looked he tired and weird don't he look pretty bad again so he gonna be all right though don't worry about he gonna be all right say the sisters just heard those few words from the ancient was out of her mind for days just don't see you you can't handle this from just hear from the angel so so so the husband call brother Branham up is singing oh hey my wife saw angel and I was at the meeting and an angel said this and he said brother Graham said what the angel looked like he look like this did a little like that you look like so yeah that was him that was him say what did he say to you say he said you look a little weird and you're going through this but you're gonna be alright he say that's all I need to hear that gonna be alright hallelujah I don't care where I go through right now what I know is I'm gonna be alright hey my body might be broke down my Amen I might be feeling this this symptom I might be feeling that symptom but the angel said I'm gonna be alright glory to God somehow God gonna bring me through this thing I got a promise from the aims of the Lord that I'm gonna be alright say God chose Moses Amen but date didn't Cora disputed that God was choosing Moses hallelujah and we want to talk a little bit about that in a second I want to also tell you another choice that God made God chose to use William Mariam Branham as the fulfillment of Revelation 10 and 7 as a fulfillment of Malachi 4 verse 5 and 6 Amen God chose of the ministry and the message of William Mary and random to bring a message that will forerun the second coming of Christ just as God chose John the Baptist to bring a message that will forerun the first coming of Christ these are God's choices blessed be the name of the Lord now another thing I want you to know is God chose you before the foundation of the world is because you are God's choice the reason you are streaming this service is because you are God's choice blessed be the name of the Lord's now let me just read a couple things here this is going to come out of the message Hebrews chapter five and six part one the Prophet makes a statement he says so in Paul I chose Paul man chose Matthias since they cast a lot but he never did nothing that shows the power the church has then to make a choice to elect their deacons to send their preachers to different places that's carnal many times he says let a man go where God leads lead them to go I like that if the people in a conference just say well here's a nice church this brother has built up a nice church and we have a little pet they'll send a man they'll send him over to this church and and they don't realize they're killing their selves now brother Branham is talking about something that happens in the denominational system if you've never been there you've you've never seen this but I've seen it many times so you know in the denominational system a preacher could go in an established church and he's and he does very well with the people there that he's preached it to and but because he's a part of an organization the organization has the right to come in and say you know what at that conference time they'll come in and say you know we know you're doing well there we see a financial report but I got this gal over here I think I would like him to step in and take that church and I'ma send you somewhere else now the man could be in his neighborhood we're gonna raise the church and that's tonight man an hour away actually trying to break his ministry hallelujah politics get into the organization when they begin to maneuver certain things and then they finish this other man in he'd come and run the church into the ground running to the ground and when they see them on the ground then they call the other man and bring him back and say the Lord is leading me to bring you back to this church it's all politics and actually the the man had a bid Amen moved around like chess pieces hallelujah Amen they moved around like chess pieces pieces they feel it must be the will of God if the bishop said it a name North political they know God ain't got nothing to do with that decision they know to hold a political but there stay right there in that system a man being being being torn torn to pieces underneath a setup like that God never intended for the church to be led that way we need to be led by the Spirit of God hallelujah we don't have no no headquarters that we report to around here I thank God for that we got I just say we got one headquarters heaven and heaven is our headquarters hey man we don't check with no other search Esther what we're gonna preach we let the Holy Ghost lead us and guide us as well as to what we gonna preach amen man has nothing to do with this it's got it's the Spirit of God that's running the church yeah glory to God somebody hallelujah hallelujah so glad I could be in a place like that where we're free and the reason that man was subject himself there is recovery because of my paycheck glory to God they do these things all in all in order to get a paycheck they'll they'll take whatever they said they win brother branham's say I'd rather be on the corner drinking branch water and eating soda crackers then be subjected to a system like that praise God amen I'm a living witness I had to make a choice one day a man as to whether I was gonna stay in the big Cathedral like Church if I had to make a choice what you know cuz somebody acts been you know what well what about your church and you know how many people oh this many people okay it's the same amount of people from about five years ago in ain't you no more no more growth this church is growing like crazy yet it growing like crazy but people not changing see so now I learned a long time it's not necessarily quantity its quality right quality it's the quality of the believer it's the quality of the saints of God right it's what I see in their lives I know God is transforming these people God is changing these people right so I'm not looking for quantity I want quality and I had to make your choices I know I'm sorry I'll take I take the ones that God gave me and I passed them to the end praise the Lord had to walk right out of the big thing I walked out of it praise the Lord amen they've told me so we've been waiting it for you to make a decision whether you gonna join it no God ain't told me to do nothing it was pretty much such a church down and come and be with us then what God told me to do and I know what God I know how I know God told me to started but he never telling me to shut it down it's like it's like it's like when you when you when a parent gives I mean the mother and the father has something to do it too when they give birth to a child they man that child belong to them praise the Lord and you gonna you gonna treat you're gonna do everything you can to make sure that child gets to a man a proper stage praise the Lord and can take care of itself but not God it told me to abandon my child praise the Lord you understand God told me to do that man choice would be abandon it but God saw say stay right there hallelujah and God I bless you alright let me go on a little further I got to get into some things it says let this quote goes on to say they'll send them over there to this church they don't realize they're killing theirselves see first place if that man goes in there he can't feel that man's place it came feel the other man's place they then they only weak in the church to try to show favor to some pet and always been that way that's denominations right it says but I believe in the supreme authority of the local assembly amen yes ladies church be its own chooses pastors the deep whatever it is and then that way the man in there has no Bishop over him the Holy Spirit wants to speak something to that church they don't have to ask anybody about whether they could do this or do that glory sets up its the individual in contact with the Holy Spirit show me by the Bible was great in the Bible and a local elder to a local church that's right yes sir the sovereignty of a local church each church in itself now Brotherhood that's wonderful all churches ought to be a brotherhood like that together but the sovereignty of local church as the Lord leads us that's how we go a man we don't have to check with nobody about decisions that we make here a man it's as the Lord leads us that's how we go I thank God for that hallelujah now the Scriptures we were reading there and you 111 says sworn to them for they have gone in the way of Cain and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward now look at this he says and perished in the gainsaying of its escort but it's Korah a man Korah it referring back to the gentleman and a Moses day now I want to look at this the way of Cain a man the error of Balaam the gainsaying of core now now I looked up that word gang saying just to try to get a little bit more understanding and before before I go that once you understand three things about the weight I mean one thing about the way of Cain the error of Balaam and the casing of Korah I want you to notice what they all three of these situations involved worship hallelujah all three of these situations involved a form of worship amen so this is a very spiritual thing that they talk about in Cain's day he offered got his sacrifice now because God did not accept the sacrifice he refused to give God anything else where you decide to do it's killed my brother in order to kill my brother is gonna force God accept my sacrifice that big calls God to accept his sacrifice amen the sacrifice was that slay an animal just like your brother did then I'll accept that hallelujah it involved worship in the days of Balaam Balaam was going down there and to speak to them and notice the skips a ring greedily after the error of Balaam for reward the reason Balaam ended up down there trying to curse the tomb of Israel with Belak it's because they were offering him prestige they were offering him money they were offered in position they will offer him think so he took the offer and he went down there to try to try to curse God's people God never allowed him to curse what God had blessed hallelujah God never longed I got used to a talking donkey to try to get his attention AHA hallelujah what does God have to use to try to get your attention let you know you have the will of God I mean some of us will be just like Balaam hallelujah I might as well say even when a talking donkey we gonna do what we want to do you still will not go in a different direction he got a talking donkey he got an angel about to kill him nothing stopped them from going down there because of money going back through a sermon that I preached by about 2014 say money is the thing that caused people to get out of will of God money can do that to you that's why you got to be very careful with money hallelujah preachers have to be careful with money money would cause a preacher to get out of the will of God hallelujah amen that's why the Prophet could not be controlled by money somebody walked up to him or a very wealthy woman say you know brother Branham she loved her she loved his ministry say but some brothers got to him just begin to talk to her say now if you could just get him to change his stance on this and change its stance on that just give them all this money if he'll if you change the stance so he went in and let's just say brother Branham I want to give you this okay thank you I appreciate that she said but I just have some requests okay what's the request could you just change your stance on this and could you change your stance on that could you not preach this thing could you not preach that you know and then you can have this check you say sister take the check back take it back because I mean the gospel can't be purchased like that the gospel can be purchased like that so I'm not gonna allow you to chief in my experience with God by offering me money like that anyone he did it multiple times somebody else came with 1.5 million dollars he told her check up a sinner I said I'm not gonna accept it because he knew that preachers always got mixed up when it came to money and I'm gonna tell you it's not just preachers that get mixed up when it comes to money the church would get mixed up when it comes to money be careful when the devil starts throwing dollar signs that you be careful always be careful because of that mean if it's only for the money it's not gonna work out right praise the Lord I'm gonna be honest with you if it's only full of money it's not gonna work out right I went back and there's a sermon I preached to I'll go back and listen to five years ago 2014 the I think I tired the escaping chorus lie and in there identify many of these things hallelujah and after I finished preaching I was listening to yesterday I said Lord everything I was talking about has been manifested it was a prophetic sermon amen praise the law was a prophetic sermon I'm gonna try to finish what I'm where I'm going here today but in this balaam because of money he will listen to the talking donkey he wouldn't listen to the angel of the Lord he didn't even listen to God God told him not to go he had three three chances not to go and he still presses press his way in there anyway God down there could not curse them couldn't curse them kept blessing every time he every time he opened his mouth it was a blessing pronounced on Israel hallelujah but then they treated he taught them a lesson of how he can get how they can get Israel involved in certain things and then God God would have to curse them because of the involvement they got in and it happened to be with worship there was involved in a man and Anna but and a particular service that they shouldn't never should have never even been there hallelujah all right the gainsaying of korah also involves worship now let's deal with this let's deal with this I looked up this gainsaying of korah and the gainsaying meant contradiction strife opposition rebellion so anytime a person is getting involved in the gainsaying of korah it starts with contradiction strife opposition rebellion okay these are the things that kind of come in now now our chorus problem and I'm and I'm gonna try to get this because problem was that you not the only holy one among us Moses and they're not gonna say it this way Cora had a problem with a one-man ministry i'ma say it again Cora had a problem with the one man ministry father if I recall correctly core was actually related to Moses I believe like a cousin or something like that he was related so so here Carla had a real issue with Moses being the one that God chose to lead his people Cora said you'd like the only one holy and he was right because God had raised up a whole nation of holy priesthood he called a whole nation of Israel holy people so he was right there was God's chosen people but God had a chosen prophet to lead his chosen people Moses was that prophet did not cause see when when when Miriam and when when Aaron came against Moses what God did to Miriam why could he not take notice of those things but he still rose up and say you're not the only holy one a wrong among us then now I want to kind of I want to put it on this level for you because you have a lot of people say brother Branham on the only prophet brother Branham one only one that God use and I'm gonna tell you like this yes sincerely there were some other people that got used but when we talk about a prophetic ministry one that the Word of God has revealed to there was only one that got used his name was William Aaron Branham for this day for this day now Cora had a problem and I want to just let me just forewarn the church it happened before and I know this spirit is still around it'll happen again anytime you got somebody trying to tell you that brother Branham one the only one watch that spirit now we know he won the only one we know God using other people I told you you were God's choice I'm hopeful I have a call to bring to you in a little bit to to just share I meant a little bit more than that but but I want you to understand anytime a person is getting you to reason against a man the person that God chose to lead us watch that spirit Oh glory I know what I'm talking about here today because the spirit of Korah is still in the land the spirit of Carl always stands up against oh my goodness always stands up against who God chose to lead you got oh my my my you weren't even thinking like that until the spirit korra came into your living room you won you won even considering energy star until the spirit of car intervene and what the spirit of Cora does it does not go to Moses directly when he has a problem I'm just preaching to y'all just for a little bit what the spirit of corpses it gets you privately y'all hang on talk to me but the spirit of courgettes you probably then begins to break this down and break that down the spirit of Korah use the Word of God the spirit of a man will use experiences the spirit of core users all caster but ultimately the spirit is trying to bring you to himself rather than put you to Jesus Christ this might be prophetic again this might be prophetic again I'm telling you watch out for this because see this was a spirit that's in the land now and that's why Jude warned us now watch out for this now hallelujah spirit of quarter Legion and spirit of core to have his own church going in the middle of Moses church spirit of Korah why Moses got Church they got Church hallelujah I'm telling the truth now amen the spirit of core just just you know Aaron just it's just rebellion all the time and I want to tell the rebellion is that's the sin of witchcraft Wyatt see see see it see if we just all join together and work together then God can do great things but the spirit of core comes in and said now you know what I don't really think Moses helling that right I think I do it this way may the Prophet didn't mean it this way he should have said this you don't tell God what he should have said you just follow what was already spoken all right now I'm telling you watch this spirit because it's a real spirit that comes into the land and have people are confused it's it's opposition its rebellion and it's always contradictory it creates strife that the spirit of court will create strife now you know some others say brother Jack you calling me the spirit of Cour I ain't called nobody the spirit of Cour I'm telling you that that spirit does exist and like I read last week ur evil spirit can't do nothing until it find somebody that we can work through don't you yield yourself to this spirit that is working in the land hallelujah all right let me read another quote here why why I'm against organized religion notice this the Prophet makes this statement says God has chosen Moses and God had chosen heir God had chosen Moses this was God's choice God had chosen Moses God had chosen Aaron and it was a message of the day so what Aaron and what Mose what Moses and Aaron with bringing was the message day you know Moses gave God account excuses I can't even speak I came this you say I tell you what you be the God and Aaron's gonna be your prophet hallelujah you be the God and then air is gonna be your profit God gave Moses a personal profit God had chosen Moses and God had chosen Aaron and it was the message of the day and no matter how good the other side looked it was contrary to God's thinking let me go on says we got a leg we gotta let God's thinking be our thinking let the mind that was in Christ be in you and this Bible this Bible reveals the mind of Christ and the whole Book of Revelations called the apocalypse in the revelation of Jesus Christ and we see how the how he condemns the thing how he takes it to one side we'll get to it after a bit all right he keeps going his he keeps saying Cora I believe he was sincere in his act say that's why I said you can be sincere but be sincerely wrong Cora I believe what he was sincere and it's act I believe the man didn't mean to do wrong I believe it was the ignorance of the man that didn't see the hand of God o my Lord Jesus the ignorance of the man that didn't see the hand of God now look at this he says see the hand of God moving and know the scriptures and that's the reason it has brought it to reasoning Cora is gonna bring everything to reasoning to reasoning amen and that's just about 90% of the trouble today that we try to inject into the program of God I would think him and we're not supposed to think at all my god he does I was thinking we're supposed to surrender our thinking to his will you understand now so if a person are willing to surrender their thinking to the will of God watch that spirit call with good intent now look at what privacy Cora with good intent when around with a false doctrine telling these brothers and showing them by reason that God hadn't only blessed Moses God show me this and God did this for me and god did I tell you if you watch this spirit it's still alive today see he says he says God that God hadn't only blessed Moses the Prophet the messenger and had only blessed him blood the whole congregation who was holy he said now the whole congregation has a right to do this and the whole congregation has a right to do that and so they got good man Levites Oh My Jesus now that is gone Joris which would be called today the ministers hallelujah I noticed you know there's something I think is again prophetic to the people because we if there's a spirit that gets in the land you know I always watched what I call parking lot preaching I always watch that you know and I watch out you know after sermon it's preacher or the Word of God I always try to go back and and Riaan or what was already said see because it's cuz Cora ain't gone real north what was saying Cora's gonna say well I would have said it like this I would have did this see Absalom did the same thing right hallelujah I mean that that's a spirit and if somebody you know I know God sent a prophet I know that but but but but what but what you're trying to say because you know my mama just be honest what I feel people doing they're trying to bring disciples to themselves not make disciples to Christ they trying to make disciples unto themselves they want a following it's the truth in their how a man they got ways to lead Jews Cora had a way of leading renowned man Karlin just go to anybody the Bible if I don't get a chance to read it but you go back and read number 16 Carl when it got written now man important man and he got them all mixed up and he started trying to lead them and then a user used to think with a whole congregation is holy not just Moses all right all right all right let's watch this he says and so and so they got good man Levites now that's God that is God's choice which would be called a daily ministers Levite was the minister of the temple did not Moses call them down for it and here he never went irreverent he told them to take census and put a holy fire in it and put the incense over the top of it and to waive this holy incense which was the command of God and they come up to make a group of men to control the church a man where God had commanded one man to do so let's go on they have a problem at one man ministry hallelujah and when they did that Moses fell on his face when he knew that God had commissioned him for him to that work and God said I have them to bring those senses up here before the tabernacle and so when they begin the way that sense is full of fire the instance going God said to Moses and their separate yourself from them come out from among them for later he called them sinners unbelievers now you know when God was was God spoke this in and-and-and-and-and number 16 and maybe we just I'll stop that quote then I go back and just pick this up in number sixteen let's go to verse 20 God spoke this where he told him to come out from among them a man now you got some things you got to do glory to God when you recognize the spirit you got to get away from that spirit a man come out from among its glory to God it's a spirit it's the spirit that that works come to come it's contradictory amen it goes against the Word of God it goes against the leadership praise the Lord God has a way to lead his people God and Moses day Moses was the one that God chose to lead the people but here comes Dayton and Cora against the leadership that God chose now look at this and number 16 now they did already I'm just kind of summarizing this because you can read the whole chapter when you get home but they had already kind of come up they got all these people coming against Moses and you know and that they're thinking in themselves you know you're not the only holy one week we can do these things too and Moses was just furious with them you begin to pray and they brought they senses forward and and everything like that and and Moses saw why why they have the census waiving God begins to speak to Moses now here in verse 20 and the Lord said in the motion unto Aaron saying separate yourselves from among this congregation that I make us that I may consume them in a moment and they fell upon their faces and said O God the God of the spirits of all flesh shall one man sin and wilt thou be wrought with all the congregation and the Lord spake in the motor saying speak unto the congregation saying get you up hallelujah from about the tabernacle I told you he was having Church while Moses was having church get yourself from Amen about the tabernacle Korah Dathan and Abraham and in a a Byram hallelujah now now now Moses gives up an analysis that hey y'all better yeah I better leave and I felt like that that script right there was a perfect tie-in to revelation 18:4 where John said I heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that she be not partakers of her sins and that she received not of her place hallelujah back then there was a plague getting ready to strike Korah glory to God and today if we don't recognize the denominational system it's in God is calling his people my people be not separated a man beat I mean description come out of my people that should be not partakers of a sins and that you receive not of her plagues what's this plague that struck Korah after Moses got him so y'all better leave leave the church of Nathan leave the church the Byram and leave the church of coure right now before God strikes something strikes him dead leave the church there was some folks that got up and left i'ma tell you according to scripture Cora's own sons got up and left his sons did not die when he died because they left the church hallelujah hallelujah they left the church and they were spared they came out from underneath that spirit people gotta watch these spirits that's in the land I mean soon you know and I'ma just be honest with you at a time like this if folk differ with the way that the church is being led through the pandemic the spirit of Korah rice huh we all got to wear masks while they make enough watch that the devil want to use that I mentioned this last week how many get in glee leave there and left the house this morning with the door unlocked yeah your front doors unlock wide open back door wide open I mean nobody did that you know why you do that it's just because Amen you just it's a safety precaution how many how many actually just don't even put a lock on your door no luck no whatsoever it's got what we call a safety precaution when you got out of your car in the parking lot you actually locked the door unless you don't want the car hallelujah it's a safety precaution so some of the things we're doing through this kovat amen pandemic safety precautions and it shouldn't be an issue but but we have people to zero I don't think brother Jack should do that no wait a minute wait a minute watch this now because it's the same spirit in the land I'm telling you all right now I mean if this goes a little deeper I mean it hits it hits it and Meniere's that hit in the local church it can hit on your job sometimes you get you get you don't like I wait a boss did things so you're gonna rise up you got a different spirit on you gonna rise and not only not only o Hallel help me god I know the Holy Ghost is all over this but now you don't start going behind your boss back and you've got different people on your side and you're gonna bring something up in a meeting that ain't no way to handle things if you differ with a person the Bible say go to that person praise the Lord don't try to call a coup yeah praise the Lord don't try to call a whole bunch of people together so you can soar in numbers you can outweigh with the point whether there was a bus that laid down that's a spirit from hell it's a truth innit glory to God see the spirit that the court of gainsaying of korah don't get wrapped up in that now watch watch this I want to just show because in quarters day what happened mostly I've been a leaf court Church and after they all after the different ones got up he said now watch what God do say if I'm a false prophet if God don't do something different than he never done before the earth gonna open up and swallow these men hold right now soon as soon as Moses let the words out of his mouth earth opened up where their churches were and swallowed them up and cover right back up right right over them they died death like nobody else died you talk about a sinkhole that was a real sinkhole but it happened to happen it happened in the area where their churches were no more influence from these churches and then on top of that after that God said I bring the rods in here and the rock that that I choose the one that I'm making a choice bring the Rogers say now now once there happen these dead rocks that you're gonna bring in here I'm gonna do some supernatural and 24 hours I'm gonna do something supernatural to prove to you who my choice is and God said bring them in put their names on it and put his name on the rod and then 24 hours air is dead Rob began to blossom in the presence of the Lord I'm telling you you will start blossoming if you're in the presence of God stay away amen from from the gainsaying of core but just be in the presence of God and watch your life begin to blossom into it won't take long what I mean by blossom is that the revelation begin to unfold of you the Word of God begin to unfold of you you begin to catch this you begin to catch that your life will begin to blossom because you're in the right place at the right time God has a choice all right let me let me go on here a little further a man a man a man now I want to just kind of hit this spoken words original seat I want to hit this because this is kind of where my thought come from the angel the Lord gave the Prophet this message told him to pick up his pen and right now I'm going to but for today I usually don't do this but I'm gonna do this for today Amen because I think it's very important for us to see what God's choice is what is worried is I want to read this quote and I want to read a few scriptures look at this the the met the message spoken words original seat how different today so this is the angel speaking to the Prophet now a man and and a study just finished talking about how John the Baptist was a faithful forerunner hey man and and and I says how different today many so called evangelist this paragraph 427 and spoken words original seat part to a man who says how different today many so-called evangelists claim they have the answer from God for the people glory to God a man if I'll give you the date here 60 2-0 3 1 8 and the paragraph is 427 62 - 0 3 1 8 4 - 7 if it's - if it's 2 messages then it's part - I want this one let me let me give you some words to put in there because this is gonna be important and that that's put in this was a money - making scheme this was a money - making scheme praise the Lord I got it I got to make sure y'all get this one and y'all just bear with me how different today many so-called evangelists claim they have the answer from God for the people just as Cora did denying disputing the authority not an angel it's prophesying that this is what was going to happen the people Justice court denying disputing the authority of God's vindicated anointed prophet Moses claiming he had the answer so chorus claiming he had the answer Amen this was a money-making scheme to a golden calf as many do today big building big school hatch our incubators of their same seed and then people then as like now they're for it after they have heard the true Word of God oh my through an anointed profit that was vindicated they fell for chorus lie now after they heard the word from the vindicated prophet then Cora comes along and begins to share all kind of other things and they fall put a spirit of Cora hello they fail for course not God proven prophet and knew God had told them Israel knew God I told them distinctly that he would vindicate his prophet by his word that's how a prophet is vindicated is by the word not the supernatural but by the word the reason we believe brother Branham was God's property because we see certain things in scripture that identifies a ministry like this it's supposed to come hallelujah glory to God look at this it says a new God had told him Israel new guy that told them distinct that he would vindicate his prophet Bosworth Cora was not a scriptural prophet but it looked awful good to the people not know he said corals not a scripture prop that mean he could have been a prophet just not a scripture one oh Jesus I hope we get that yeah you may prophesy sometimes you may get some things right but we talk about fulfilling Malachi 4 we talk about fulfilling revelation 10 7 we now talk about hitting and missing all right I'm going on because there's some things that's gonna be said here it says corals not a scripture prophet but it look all for good to the people same as it does now today today it's blood on your hands oh my balls of fire on the platform all emotion this is all emotion they're not looking at the word no more they're looking at the emotion we don't want you to get caught up on the emotion we want you to get caught up on what is dust at the Lord watch this now watch he says today it's blood on your hands balls are fine the platform oil in your fingers already away the Word of God this is my God if I can show you where it's written then you gotta say man it's not my emotion that's doing this this is what the Word of God say can I go further look at this it today it's blood on your hands balls of fire on the platform oiling your fingers and the same thing produces women preachers when we leave the church buying motion it would produce women preachers they say my brother Jack what's the matter with that let me read the scriptures for you they say the same thing produces women preaches not only that it produces short hair bobbed makeup what's the matter with all that let the Scriptures what do you have you won't you know this this not even brother branham's words I angel from heaven spoke these words and told the Prophet to write this down now see it see see Paul said if an angel for having come and speak to you things that that I that that's different from what I already spoke let him be a curse because he knew what he was saying was the word my and people call Paul a woman hater they'll iose Paul was not a woman hater Paul Paul was a messenger from Almighty God sent to established a New Testament church and all what has happened is that we've gotten away from the word you know what got us away emotions emotions has led us away from the word we so emotional that we don't believe God gun judge nobody oh he's a loving guy yeah in order to in order to be a loving God he also got to be a just guys yeah and if you don't line up with his words there will be judgment yes hell hell hell hell has enlarged it's not because so many people want to go yes there is a hell it everybody ain't dying and going to heaven praise the Lord we can't preach hell no more from the pulpit if you don't live right you're going to hell you'll be separated from God all right all right all right let me go emotions emotions emotions emotions don't let the church be run by emotion let the church be run by the word now let me just the angel said this stuff the Angels say that we got to go find it in the scripture now let me let me let me go he says the same thing produces women preachers Shorthair Bob make up what do you have you would not think that people would fall for it but they did for Korah and they do the same thing now and turn away from the true word for denomination shorts so what kind of seed that's in them it says he goes owner says but thank God all Israel never fell for kora some state by Moses the anointed prophet with the Word of God saying is it today with many of God's elected by his word and his spirit see in and encourage that his sons got up and left the church and and stood with Moses and today Amen we left denominational churches and we come understand with this word reveal through a prophet now he used these statements about you know they they got blood in it on the four hands on their hands balls of filing platform they're loud women preachers let women cut their hair wear slacks and shorts and bypass the Word of God for the creasing talkers let's just read a couple of scriptures why why does the why why would the angel say don't bypass the word and allow this first Timothy to best read these read the scriptures there with me first to minister we not just make we're not just preaching things just because we wanna preach things we're trying to stay with the word our hearts would turn back to scripture if the scriptures say it you know what we say to description a man let it be so God if you wrote it in your word then I want I want to live that now watch this first Timothy 2 he says but I suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silence 1st Timothy first Timothy 2 verse 12 but I suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silence for Adam was first formed then Eve and Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression so so so from that from the beginning of time when God came down and gave his punishments a man Adam and Eve were co-equal at one time hallelujah but after that she said he said that she have to serve her husband that's what happened because of the fall now now Paul Paul is picking up that same scripture bringing it to the church the same thing that happened in Genesis bring to the churches signal I suffer not a woman to teach nor usurp authority over the man and any time whoever's in the pulpit is the person that is usurping authority in the congregation hallelujah so if you have a woman behind the pulpit then you just broke this scripture hallelujah you just broke now I can go a little further if you want me to if you want me to the church as a whole represents a woman in Scripture Christ would be the male Christ is the bridegroom the church is considered the bride hallelujah so if a men in the in the church physically Amen if you have a woman given the word to the woman Church you have a spiritual homosexual relationship spiritually you incident and this is why the Spirit is coming to the land today in the church what we try to do is keep the church pure keep the church clean stay on the words there wasn't because he hated women it was because of what happened at the beginning just exactly this virtual sense and the Adam was not deceived verse 14 Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived because she was deceived this is why she can't take the pulpit all right she was in a transgression he also said this he also and I could preach a whole sermon just on that but he said she said some other things I'm taking you back to the scripture now he says they're loud we're and preachers let women cut their wear slacks and shorts now why would the angel have a problem with women wear slacks and shorts well because angel wrote the Bible and if anybody does something Sogetsu Bible the angel has a problem can we just read Deuteronomy 22:5 praise the Lord I'm just reading it I could just say I'll go back and read it now I'm gonna read it for you I got another one Deuteronomy 22:5 look at this this is what the Bible say the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man neither shall a man put on a woman's garment and we ain't living in a day where men are wearing god women's garments and and and and and and women wearing men's garments this is a day of perversion I was just government going down the street here the other day and and you know they were get on the rosin and I see this person walking guy got gold in their mouth and you know I'm just in the way today Walker the minute like so a really rough guy it was not a guy it was a lady and I guarantee that lady had a wife when you got a woman marrying a woman you got perversion praise the Lord shirt you got a man married a man you got perversion praise look God never intended for it to be that way so so here we got scripted selves the woman shall not wear that with which potatoes and I noticed this it's they pertaining that mean if it looked like a man wear wear it a woman is not supposed to wear it the woman should not wear that which pertaineth unto a man neither shall a man put on a woman's garment for all that do so are abomination unto the Lord thy God now this is the Bible this is the Bible I know churches don't preach this no more but it's in there and that's why the angel said you know say say people when they start compromising when they start getting in their feelings they're gonna get away from these things and they're gonna go right back and doing things that's against my word hallelujah now let's talk about what when the angel said you know if it's gonna lead to wear and slacks and wearing shorts and women cutting their hair well let's look at first Corinthians chapter 11 verse 14 and 15 the angels only quoting what he put in his word the angels only quoting what he put in his word now it's up to us to go back and find it in Scripture and live it alright look at this 1st Corinthians 11 verse 14 and 15 dumped not nature itself teach you hallelujah that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto Him that mean men are supposed to cut their hair now we in a day when men wanna have longer hair than women women want to have shorter hair than men hallelujah glory to God says dub not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto Him look at this but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for a covering so in scripture God teaches the man cut his hair but he wants to to where how long hair and I love the way one brother put it say some sisters because of you know just their ethnicity they might not have long hair naturally you say but sister if you don't cut it your hair is long in God's eyes so another sister could have hair down her back but if she cut it she got short here but you ain't cut your hair one day in your life God say that's long hair and it says glory these are God's choices see I'm talk about God's choice God's choice this wasn't for the sister not to cut a half but for the brother to cut his hair and God's choices for the woman not to wear garments pertaining to a man and the man not to wear garments that a woman would wear that's that's God's choice but what we've got out got involved in today is our own choices God has a heaven and a hell to put us in and it's up to us to follow his worked I told you see when when the believer hears the word when he hears the message too believable the believer hears it and he believes now how you know that I believe will leaves it because they begin to do it I'm not making this up when I say that our hearts were turned back to the word this is what our hearts went back to our hearts went back to Genesis all the way to Revelation and I don't say well well that's Old Testament we don't use that anymore okay so what about thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal thou shalt not commit adultery are we throwing that away too we're gonna hold on to everything God spoke that's God's choice and I'm gonna let my choice be God's choice let me just read you one last quote cuz you are also God's choice oh oh oh oh I forgot one more scripture I got to read forgot to highlight this one second Kings 9:30 because it said that they wear Shaq slacks they cut their hair they wear shorts they bypass the word for their own crease in dogmas and another one another statement that the angel said when they fell for course lie it said that this this the state produces women preaches short hair bobbed make-up it produces makeup well where we get makeup in the scripture second Kings chapter nine verse 30 there's only one woman in the Bible ever wore makeup look at this and when Jay who was come to Jezreel Jezebel heard of it and she painted her face and tired her head and looked out at a window the only woman to ever wear makeup in Scripture was Jezebel Jezebel was not a daughter of God Jezebel serve heathen gods and brother branham said the makeup is a heathen trait anybody read that quote or heard that quote it's a heathen trait hallelujah so when the angel says that this is what they do when they begin to compromise or when they begin to a man just get worked up in their emotions these are the things that come into the church I'm accepting God's choice I don't want to do nothing that displeases him a man I'm telling you you are God's choice and he wants you to walk according to his word not just a part that you agree with even the part that you don't agree with you can still say a man with your life alright one more quote this this great warrior David I'm going back to their paragraph ether t2 and this great warrior David should be on your first page I'll finish with this quote hallelujah there you are he know where he was standing he was a man of faith he believed God God was in him he knew he was anointed and you know the same thing if you you're Christians and if you if God hadn't elected you to be a Christian you would not be a Christian listen it's God's choice not yours so even for you to be a Christian it's God's choice not yours no man seeks God no man seeks God at anytime you have a salt god but God has sought you it wasn't you call it for God it was God calling for you look and then when God called you it showed he elected you you accepted the call it was justification then you gave your heart to Christ and was filled with the Holy Spirit and now your positionally placed in the body of Christ now if it made you quit your old mean habits and act like a Christian ought to if it'll do that for you it'll heal your body because it's a promise amen there you are I want to tell you that you're God's choice elected before the foundation world to hear the truth in this state so you could walk according to that and angel said you would be here now angel said that Amen that we would accept this work we wouldn't fall a man like the others four cores live we wouldn't get caught up in all that and start making his word just use my emotions a man in order to justify scriptures or the proof scriptures that's not it no we've taken God for what he said and what he is we say a Mantid or even the part that hurts us we say a man we God's choice we're God's choice we're God's people praise God a believer when he hears God's worries as a man a man a man shall we pray father you have given us your word and Lord there's a journey that you have carried us on through this year looking back at what an angel spoke in 1962 to a prophet told him to pick up his pen and write and Lord just been bringing paragraph by paragraph you know the timing you know Lord all about it and father you know that you are in control Lord the word must be preached and lord I just pray that we as a people can accept what has been given to us and love we got to be so careful Dathan the spirit of Dathan and kora in the land coming against what a prophet spoke Lord as he turned our hearts back to the word we didn't even know these things where there in scripture our churches never told us we didn't know it God and God the Bible says there there's a Time Lord where you winked at our ignorance you leave it you realize we didn't know it so you didn't hold it against us your grace was so great God but once we receive truth God that's when you begin to expect us to walk according to it so I pray God that those that are heard online those that have heard in person God as the word has been presented I pray Lord Jesus that they would God they would receive it they would walk in it and they would live it daily father's my prayer God we can't do this in our own strength but that's why we need the Holy Spirit Lord to come a man in come in to it's not just owners but come into us God give us the unction and the power to be able to live the Word of God you said after the Holy Ghost has come upon you you receive power God that's what we need the power of God the power of God to live the Word of God to bear the fruit of God to accept your choice God for your foster not like our thoughts and your ways are not like our waste fathers in Jesus name that we pray amen amen can we give the Lord a hand a priest brings the Lord a man I forgot to do this earlier there was a car that I received a man on today and since dear
