[15:17] his lifetime was that he did not serve
[15:19] God early enough a man he didn't start
[15:23] serving them early enough and oftentimes
[15:25] we can go back in our lives and just
[15:27] reflect that had we given God everything
[15:29] an earlier age not much further down the
[15:32] road we'd be Amen tonight oh we just

[15:38] he's everything that we need everything
[15:41] we need you can be seated man praise the
[15:46] Lord
[15:47] [Music]
[15:51] man we want to just give opportunity
[15:57] tonight for anyone that wouldn't want to
[15:59] share a testimony here man just
[16:03] something that the Lord has done for you
[16:05] the Bible tells us to make known his
[16:07] deeds among men man so if God's done
[16:12] something special for you for your
[16:14] family or something you want to share we
[16:17] want to give space it man for you to do
[16:19] that on tonight
[16:22] yes I'm an axe that you just had this
[16:29] microphone because when we do this and
[16:31] they have the video going nobody came
[16:34] here god bless you I just want to thank
[16:43] God for I think God for his love
[16:49] he's concerned about me he is caring
[16:53] about me
[16:54] and his divine protection probably a
[16:59] couple of months ago I went in for my
[17:02] annual exam and they called me back
[17:09] within a few hours that I had left and
[17:11] said that my exam was abnormal and I
[17:15] needed to go get another exam so when
[17:20] they rescheduled it they rescheduled it
[17:23] about three weeks out and in this three
[17:26] weeks time I I just had so many my own
[17:30] battles I went through so much I found
[17:34] myself just filled with fear I was so
[17:40] afraid I was so worried
[17:41] I was so concerned I was I was literally
[17:44] scared and I just didn't know what to do
[17:51] but I wanted to be able to lean on God
[17:55] for myself I didn't want to tell anybody
[17:59] because when you ask for prayer you got
[18:03] to believe yourself or it won't work as
[18:06] far as I'm concerned and I was so afraid
[18:10] and so scared when I say afraid that's a
[18:13] whole different thing than being scared
[18:15] and I was so afraid that I didn't even
[18:19] want to say it out loud so I just kept
[18:23] trying to just get in touch with God for
[18:25] myself and I I found myself crying I
[18:29] felt alone I felt like I just didn't
[18:33] want to say it everything
[18:35] and so all those three weeks going on I
[18:39] was going through this so finally I went
[18:41] to the the doctor had the exam
[18:46] she had me sit down she said let me let
[18:49] the back to read it so while I was
[18:52] sitting in the waiting room I was there
[18:53] all by myself and I was really I was
[18:55] praying the whole time I was scared
[18:56] those three weeks I was praying as well
[18:58] but this time I was in the waiting room
[19:01] and I was just praying so hard but what
[19:06] it happened was in the meantime brother
[19:09] Jack had preached the sermon those two
[19:12] sermons on fear and they were right on
[19:15] time because they really just gripped my
[19:18] heart and I just went through my Bible
[19:22] and I found all of the scriptures that I
[19:24] could find on fear and I just covered
[19:27] myself covered myself with those
[19:29] scriptures and while I was sitting in
[19:33] them in the waiting room I just was
[19:36] praying and praying and just asking God
[19:38] to just wouldn't leave the fear I don't
[19:40] even know if I even I don't know if I
[19:42] asked him to take care of the situation
[19:44] I just asked him I remember asking him
[19:46] to relieve the fear so they called me
[19:51] back in again I had to do another exam
[19:55] the same thing and she say sit out there
[19:58] they're gonna check it and everything so
[20:00] I set out and I waited and I was praying
[20:03] again I I'm telling you I have I can't
[20:07] really count the number times on my one
[20:09] hand how close I felt to God at that
[20:12] time I just felt such a peace and I just
[20:18] felt like everything was gonna be okay
[20:20] and so that's why while I was sitting
[20:24] out there praying and just meditating
[20:26] she called me back again and this was
[20:29] the fourth time that I went in there for
[20:32] the first time was the the original time
[20:35] and then three more times his fourth
[20:36] design this time and I went in and the
[20:40] lady was just talking to me you know and
[20:42] then and I was nervous but she was just
[20:45] talking to me and talking to me and just
[20:46] teasing and stuff like that
[20:48] and while I was talking back to her I
[20:51] was just so relieved and so happy I
[20:54] didn't know what was going to happen I
[20:56] didn't know any results but I just felt
[20:58] so relieved and so happy the thing about
[21:02] it is those that whole time that I was
[21:04] going through I went through a lot of
[21:06] stuff a lot of mind battles in different
[21:08] situations but I just thank God so much
[21:12] for bringing me through and for just
[21:15] letting me know that he really is real
[21:17] and I know within myself I didn't need
[21:19] anybody to to qualify it for me I didn't
[21:24] need anybody to reassure me I knew
[21:26] within myself that I reached God for
[21:30] myself and I think I think brother Jack
[21:32] for just listening to God and just
[21:34] bringing those those sermons right on
[21:38] time I don't know who else it helped but
[21:40] it sure helped me right on time
[21:42] god bless you man certainly thank God
[21:50] for that and a man just bringing a
[21:52] conference trip to assist a copy man
[21:55] during her trial his word is a man is
[21:59] real it's real and all we have to do is
[22:02] apply it anybody else want to share
[22:04] tonight all right don't say you wouldn't
[22:09] ass
[22:20] god bless you um it's short and sweet I
[22:24] just want to thank God for just watching
[22:27] over me last night I hit a deer yeah
[22:32] didn't see it
[22:35] driving down jog it was dark and if
[22:38] anybody's driven down job at night the
[22:41] lights are out and they've been out for
[22:43] months and huh and the lights have been
[22:49] out for months and so it's it's
[22:51] literally in some areas just pitch-black
[22:53] dark and and and it was raining as well
[22:56] so I something was going on on the other
[23:00] side of the road and I looked over there
[23:03] because two cars have pulled over and I
[23:05] thought maybe they had an accident or
[23:06] something so I looked over to kind of
[23:09] just see what was going on and when I
[23:10] look back deer was right in front of me
[23:12] and so I just thank God because I didn't
[23:15] I didn't I didn't panic you know I just
[23:19] turned the wheel just a little bit so I
[23:21] wouldn't hit him head-on and he he just
[23:24] sideswiped the car and really if you
[23:26] looked at it you wouldn't even know that
[23:27] anything happened so I I just thank God
[23:29] because all the different things that
[23:32] you hear you know about people hitting
[23:34] animals and stuff and you know large
[23:37] animals and how either they're killed or
[23:40] the car is totaled or things like that
[23:42] and none of that happened but I mean I
[23:44] was just in complete and total shock
[23:46] because who hits a deer in Florida I
[23:48] just but uh but I just thank God for
[23:53] just um protecting me and and also if
[23:56] there were no other cars around me so I
[23:58] didn't you know um you know it could
[24:00] have actually hit somebody somebody else
[24:02] I could have ran up on the sidewalk or
[24:05] the um the median where it's full of
[24:07] trees so I just think God for just being
[24:10] there for me because I don't know how
[24:12] you I mean
[24:13] people and other you know kundur
[24:16] countries people in other states deal
[24:17] with it all the time you know I've never
[24:19] dealt with anything like that you know
[24:21] so just thank God for just giving me a
[24:23] clear head and just allowing me to walk
[24:25] out of that situation god bless praise
[24:29] the Lord
[24:32] certainly thank God for watching over a
[24:35] man's sister Erica during that time

[38:09] privilege for me to just be able to
[38:11] present this word to you what the Lord
[38:14] has placed in my heart so I know you
[38:17] guys are my family so I'm home so I have
[38:19] nothing to worry about
[38:20] all right if you would just turn me to
[38:23] mark mark
[38:37] mark chapter 10 verse 17
[38:48] just say man when you get me there and
[38:56] when he was gone for it and to the way
[38:58] that come one running and kneeled to him
[39:02] and asked him good master what shall I
[39:06] do that I may inherit eternal life
[39:09] and Jesus said unto him why call us down
[39:14] me good there's none good but one that
[39:17] is God they'll know it's the
[39:20] commandments do not commit adultery do
[39:22] not kill do not steal do not bear false
[39:25] witness defraud not honour thy father
[39:28] and mother and he answered and said unto
[39:31] Him master all these things have I
[39:34] observed from my youth
[39:35] then Jesus beholding him loved him and
[39:39] said unto him one thing thou lackest go
[39:43] thy way sell whatsoever that has and
[39:46] give it to the poor and thou shalt have
[39:49] treasure in heaven and come take up the
[39:51] cross and follow me and he will say at
[39:54] that same and went away grieve for he
[39:57] had great possessions may the Lord add a
[40:00] blessing to his reading so I don't know
[40:04] about you guys but if the Lord told me
[40:06] to give up everything I had I wouldn't
[40:09] even have thought about it if God just
[40:11] told me to let him enter into my heart
[40:13] article let go of everything that I had
[40:15] that wouldn't be a thought but see if I
[40:20] could use as a title tonight it'd be the
[40:23] confrontation of eternal life see
[40:26] there's only one form of eternal life
[40:28] and that's his word and that's exactly
[40:31] what was presented to this young man I
[40:33] like to also go to Matthew 7 verse 13
[40:46] Matthew 7 verse 13 says enter ye and
[40:49] after straight gate for wide is the gate
[40:52] and broad is the way that leadeth to
[40:54] destruction and many there be which go
[40:57] in thereat because Strait is the gate
[40:59] and narrow is the way see he was
[41:02] speaking of a narrow path and just to
[41:05] dissect the scripture here the narrow
[41:06] path is telling us that few there be
[41:10] that find it
[41:11] see many are called but few are chosen
[41:14] see this narrow path understand that you
[41:17] can't walk on this path with with two
[41:19] people you can't walk on this path with
[41:21] three people you can't you can't turn
[41:23] left or turn right this crisis to lead
[41:25] you to Christ this path is to give you
[41:28] life see while there's a path that leads
[41:31] to destruction there's many people
[41:33] that's gonna find it but this path
[41:36] that's narrow it's an individual walk
[41:39] with Christ see the life is presented in
[41:42] two forms two roads two different
[41:45] journeys to different destinations see
[41:48] what all things being said there's one
[41:49] important aspect all that you have the
[41:52] choice of choosing choosing which road
[41:54] you want to take see if I can go to
[42:02] Strait is the gate and year 59 0 301
[42:08] would you see a little bit what the
[42:09] Prophet says see he says he in paragraph
[42:18] 58 lot didn't know he was going to
[42:22] backslide see he went looking toward
[42:26] Sodom when things were easy and there's
[42:30] many times we look towards the easy way
[42:33] see this when you're on the right path
[42:36] the devil has one goal it's to lead you
[42:39] off it's to lead you off the right path
[42:41] so if the devil's attacking you tonight
[42:44] that means you on the right path
[42:46] so this lot didn't have any idea that he
[42:51] was gonna be lost but can I say this to
[42:53] you you have to be lost sometime
[42:56] to find the right road to take and many
[42:59] of us in here have been lost is that
[43:01] right we've been lost but now we're
[43:04] saved
[43:04] that's why we're here because we
[43:06] understand that we were walking on that
[43:09] right path and Christ out a hold of our
[43:11] hearts see understand when you're on
[43:17] this path you're not gonna have too many
[43:19] friends now a lot of people is not and I
[43:22] allow people's gonna like you and verse
[43:25] impatient of paragraph 59 it says if you
[43:28] follow Christ you'll be hated by people
[43:31] for all that live godly in Christ Jesus
[43:34] shall suffer persecution and if you come
[43:37] to Christ you'll not come by any church
[43:40] or anything nomination or creed you'll
[43:42] come by the blood that's the only Avenue
[43:45] and you cannot bring no one with you you
[43:48] come alone and you stand on your own
[43:50] confession and your own thing and just
[43:54] to just to say this also your confession
[43:57] actually gives God permission see you
[44:00] have to confess what your situation is
[44:03] you have to confess what it is that
[44:05] you're expecting from God because if
[44:08] you're not confession what your need are
[44:10] you're not allowing God permission to
[44:12] move you see God standing at the door
[44:15] knock but you have to allow him to open
[44:18] up you have to allow him the permission
[44:22] to come in paragraph 60 says what if lot
[44:31] when he's seen everything he saw where
[44:35] there was where there was money much
[44:37] popularity because he had a strange
[44:40] because he'd be a stranger and smart man
[44:42] educated a lot of psychology and he'd do
[44:45] certain things and yet maintain his
[44:47] religion he thought I've got faith in
[44:50] God so I'll just go down into Sodom and
[44:52] I'll make some extra money and I'll
[44:55] become a great man we become power may
[44:58] be wonderful preacher see you you have
[45:00] to make a choice you you can't
[45:03] compromise your way to get to the life
[45:05] if you compromise your way your actions
[45:09] in your life will
[45:10] louder than what you have to say and
[45:12] it's gonna bring you to the path that
[45:14] leads to destruction and that's exactly
[45:18] what lot dad
[45:19] si la try to compromise he try to find
[45:22] the easy way while trying to find the
[45:24] easy way he find himself being lost see
[45:28] there are two roads but only one leads
[45:30] to life and you have to choose you have
[45:33] the decision to choose which road you
[45:35] want to take see if we can go back to
[45:38] the to this rich young ruler one thing
[45:41] that that uh that I came to see is he
[45:45] came to God and he kneeled to God and
[45:48] asked him good master what shall I do
[45:51] that I may inherit eternal life and
[45:54] Jesus said up to him why have you called
[45:57] me good right there's no good but God
[46:00] and don't know it's the commandment see
[46:02] this young man came to God with a need
[46:04] he realized yes I've observed everything
[46:08] from my youth but I still have a need
[46:11] there's still something that I need
[46:14] that'll make me complete that was
[46:16] eternal life and if I could just say
[46:19] this as he approaches Jesus right this
[46:23] this was actually a form of prayer he
[46:25] prayed to Jesus and his prayer was
[46:27] answered right on the spot because he
[46:29] asked God what he shall inherit and God
[46:33] told him well go Vout go that way
[46:37] one thing that lack is go thy way sell
[46:39] whatsoever that has give to the poor and
[46:41] thou shalt have treasure in heaven
[46:43] his answer his prayer was answered right
[46:46] there and he didn't even realize it
[46:48] matter of fact he was talking to the
[46:51] answer cuz Jesus is eternal life
[46:53] is that right so he didn't realize what
[46:57] he had but but sometimes when you pray
[46:59] you don't know you're not ready for the
[47:02] answer you're not you're not ready for
[47:04] God to move and you have to you have to
[47:07] understand when you pray God is ready
[47:09] more than you are and that's exactly
[47:12] what happened see if God told me to let
[47:16] go and let God
[47:16] I would even I thought about it it
[47:20] wasn't even a choice
[47:32] and if I could just go here leadership
[47:36] passive leadership
[47:38] year 65 the Prophet says this young man
[47:43] this rich man when he come down a young
[47:47] ruler we talked about all religious and
[47:50] belong to the church and everything fine
[47:52] educated fine businessman and everything
[47:55] when he come to the end of that road he
[47:58] began to scream see he did all that he
[48:02] had to do he was a good man he had good
[48:05] education he went to school respected
[48:07] his parents right he kept the
[48:09] commandments but but in all of that
[48:12] there was an end to that road there was
[48:14] an into that road and he realized he
[48:16] needed eternal life to complete that
[48:19] road for him right he had nowhere to
[48:22] step so he'd been led by many other
[48:25] things he'd been led by the church he's
[48:27] been led by his education he's been led
[48:29] by his parents but they won't think he
[48:32] liked that he wasn't led by Christ and
[48:34] and here we find that Jesus seeing all
[48:41] the good that he's done loved him so it
[48:45] was something good about him he loved
[48:47] them there was something good about him
[48:48] and Jesus Jesus looked at him and told
[48:51] him what well young man all you have to
[48:53] do is give up all you have and give it
[48:57] to the poor right so if Jesus looked at
[49:03] him and loved him there was something
[49:05] real about the boy for the Bible says we
[49:11] found him in mark and jesus beholding
[49:13] him loved him so therefore there must be
[49:17] something real outstanding about this
[49:19] young fellow he had a good character he
[49:23] had a good character rating he was a man
[49:25] that raped I was raised right
[49:26] intelligent smart intellectual
[49:28] successful in business and a religious
[49:30] man had a lot of good characteristics
[49:32] that was outstanding but so much that it
[49:35] attracted the attention of Jesus Christ
[49:37] to save her but when he was confronted
[49:41] being successful in all of these things
[49:43] nothing had
[49:44] wrong he was perfectly cut out right
[49:47] measured up right intelligent right
[49:50] educated his success he was smart a fine
[49:53] businessman probably belonged to a
[49:55] businessman group somewhere there in
[49:57] Palestine
[49:59] he might have belonged to a businessman
[50:02] fellowship like we have no doubt about
[50:04] it because businessman has always had
[50:07] their fellowship with one another and
[50:09] when he was religious as he could be
[50:13] because Jesus had questioned him he said
[50:15] I have kept these commandments observed
[50:17] them from my youth
[50:19] that's right see he had been brought up
[50:22] right did this young man had everything
[50:24] that he mean but but he liked one thing
[50:27] and and and that's when you when you
[50:30] were confronted with eternal life the
[50:32] question is are you ready you you have
[50:34] to be ready to receive it
[50:36] because your life is what receives
[50:39] eternal life not now what you say not
[50:41] not not your faithfulness to going to
[50:44] church but it takes more than that to
[50:47] attract the attention of Christ you your
[50:49] heart has to be ready to receive it and
[50:52] I like I like how the word goes as we
[50:56] find it was one that rejected eternal
[50:59] life we also find someone else that
[51:01] accepted eternal life right so this
[51:06] young man living in this world thought
[51:09] he had everything he needed he had all
[51:11] the treasures of this world he was rich
[51:14] he had money he had nothing to complain
[51:16] about
[51:17] yet we found somebody else if we can
[51:20] this go to Hebrews 11
[51:40] praise the Lord Hebrews 11 23 so we see
[51:48] by faith Moses when he was born was hid
[51:53] three months of his parents because they
[51:57] saw he was a proper child and they were
[52:00] not afraid of the Kings commandment by
[52:03] faith Moses when he was come to years
[52:06] refused to be called the son of
[52:08] Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to
[52:11] suffer affliction with the people of God
[52:14] than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for
[52:16] the season esteeming the reproach of
[52:20] Christ greater riches than the treasures
[52:23] in Egypt for he had respect unto the
[52:25] recompense of the reward by faith he
[52:29] forsook Egypt not fearing the wrath of
[52:32] the King for he endured as seeing him
[52:35] who is invisible through faith he kept
[52:38] the Passover and sprinkled of blood less
[52:40] that less he that destroy the firstborn
[52:43] should touch him so so we see Moses by
[52:48] faith accepted the the promise of God he
[52:51] accepted the offer that God was giving
[52:53] to him and in all that he forsook Egypt
[52:56] he forsook everything that he had and
[52:59] and he accepted eternal life see Moses
[53:04] was rich he was a young ruler and he was
[53:07] to become Pharaoh he had everything that
[53:09] he needed he was filled with the
[53:11] knowledge the education but he realized
[53:13] that wasn't enough he realized that was
[53:15] a net and as he forsook that God dealt
[53:20] with him and took it took all of that
[53:21] away led him to a place where he had
[53:25] nothing but only to only forgot to lead
[53:28] him in the work of his of his
[53:30] fulfillment see and paragraph 250 the
[53:37] first thing when we had accepted to take
[53:40] the reproach of Christ and forsake his
[53:42] education that's the first thing he had
[53:45] to do he was thought in all wisdom of
[53:47] Egyptians and all of his popularity has
[53:50] thrown his Skepta his ski
[53:53] his crown everything he had he rejected
[53:55] it and this other fellow wanted it and
[53:59] refused Christ and this man refused that
[54:01] and accepted Christ and quickly what
[54:04] happened
[54:05] he Moses how to separate himself the
[54:08] minute that he rejected the things of
[54:11] the world he had to separate himself the
[54:13] scripture says if you have love for the
[54:15] world then the love of God is not in you
[54:18] see you you have to have the right kind
[54:20] of love if you don't have the right kind
[54:23] of love is going to lead you to
[54:24] destruction it's going to lead you to do
[54:27] things that aren't the will of God
[54:44] she claiming to be a Christian is is is
[54:47] like I said the life that you live that
[54:49] shows what you are it's this old rock
[54:52] LeMay ssin of the reflection of Christ
[54:55] but you can't be identified with Christ
[54:58] and be identified with the world at the
[55:00] same time Christ crucified the world he
[55:03] he dealt with that overcame the world
[55:05] and see being identified with the world
[55:10] but Satan doesn't always mean featuring
[55:12] yourself with with things like a highly
[55:15] offensive crime or things that are so
[55:18] out in the open but but what it is is
[55:21] complete disobedient to God if your life
[55:24] is not holding up to the obedience of
[55:26] the word then then you're not walking in
[55:30] a line of price you're identified with
[55:33] Satan and disobedient to the word is
[55:37] it's simply not having the love of God
[55:39] because the love of God is what draws
[55:41] you to be obedient to be faithful
[55:45] disobedient is what entices sin when you
[55:48] are when you when you find yourself in
[55:51] the midst of temptation right you have a
[55:53] choice to make
[55:54] you you have a decision to decide
[55:57] whether you're gonna go to the road that
[55:59] leads to destruction a little the road
[56:01] that leads to life it's your choice but
[56:05] disobedient is gonna be the very thing
[56:08] that places you in the midst of
[56:10] temptation when you're obedient in
[56:12] church in church
[56:14] how can a devil attack you when you're
[56:16] obedient in your prayer how can the
[56:19] devil attack you when your obedient and
[56:22] your fasting and your meditation on the
[56:25] word how can a devil attack you see
[56:27] you're leaving no room for sin and when
[56:30] you're on this road that leads to life
[56:32] see you you have to have eternal life
[56:34] and to have eternal life you have to be
[56:36] sealed you have to be sealed with the
[56:38] Holy Ghost see it isn't enough for you
[56:41] to say yes I've been enlightened by the
[56:44] Word of God and I've tasted the good
[56:46] fruits but but you have to be able to be
[56:49] sealed with the Holy Ghost
[56:54] see the Prophet says something
[56:56] interesting
[57:01] he says something interesting here it
[57:05] says and the breach between the seven
[57:08] churches in the seven seals in paragraph
[57:11] 74 he says you all have heard me say
[57:16] that people said the devil made me do
[57:18] this no no the devil didn't do it you
[57:21] just wasn't sealed in because when you
[57:24] were sealed in he was sealed out now you
[57:28] went to him he couldn't get to you
[57:30] because the only way he could get to you
[57:32] is to come to the same process that you
[57:35] have he would have been saved sanctified
[57:38] and filled with the Holy Ghost if you
[57:40] went to the same process you went
[57:42] through and he'd be your brother see he
[57:45] didn't do it
[57:46] no you just went borderline and come
[57:49] back let's sing for the things of the
[57:51] world you never went all the way into
[57:53] Cannon you you you see Jordan and you
[57:56] just never went on way to begin with
[57:58] that's what that testifies see you have
[58:03] to be sealed by the Holy Ghost when you
[58:05] see about Holy Ghost you you leave no
[58:07] room for the devil operate you you leave
[58:10] no room for him to do anything that he
[58:14] desires because the devil has only one
[58:16] goal one plan the minute you testify
[58:18] what God has done for you he's already
[58:20] working on how he can destroy that of
[58:22] how he can eliminate your victory but
[58:26] see if I could just say sometimes we
[58:28] don't realize not closely out of victory
[58:30] because see oftentimes we we don't
[58:34] really not close to out the victory but
[58:35] if for just one second we were to open
[58:38] our eyes and and and I can put it as
[58:41] this activate your faith right we'll see
[58:44] how close we are to victory see in the
[58:47] midst in the midst of any doubt fear
[58:50] darkness right when you have when you
[58:53] have that kind of faith it bring
[58:55] immediate victory see it sends your
[58:58] greatest temptations that you find
[59:00] yourself having your greatest rewards
[59:01] right because you have to overcome
[59:05] something you have
[59:06] to put the activation of your faith and
[59:09] you have to allow God to be God in the
[59:12] midst of the temptation that's how you
[59:14] overcome so so see you when you're
[59:18] dealing with such you you should never
[59:21] try to give up but you should try to
[59:23] keep going your endurance in the midst
[59:26] of of your pressure only brings forth
[59:29] your faithfulness when you can keep
[59:32] moving the spite of what's holding you
[59:34] back you begin to be the very victory
[59:36] see victory isn't what you've done or
[59:42] what you are able to do but victory is
[59:46] simply exceeding and overcoming every
[59:50] doubt that tries to hold you down every
[59:53] time so you have to have that kind of
[59:56] faith when you're on this road this road
[59:59] has to be able to lead you to life it
[1:00:03] has to be able to produce the same
[1:00:05] fruits of the spirit you have to be
[1:00:08] sealed in and if you if you're not if
[1:00:11] you're not sealed in then then you have
[1:00:15] to you have to pray about it you you
[1:00:17] have to be in line with God's Word in
[1:00:19] obedience so that God can fulfill
[1:00:21] because God is waiting for you he stands
[1:00:24] at the door not but what is your
[1:00:26] confession tonight what what what what
[1:00:28] is your confession what about you is
[1:00:30] bringing glory and honor to Christ
[1:00:32] because Christ is raiding but he needs
[1:00:35] your permission he needs your permission
[1:00:37] so that he can bring forth the victory
[1:00:39] so that he can step in and give you
[1:00:42] eternal life god bless you
[1:00:47] [Applause]
[1:01:16] thank the Lord for brother Jerry a man
[1:01:23] confrontation of eternal life
[1:01:26] I like that two rows two choices to
[1:01:30] different destinations and just a real
[1:01:33] good comparison air of the rich young
[1:01:35] ruler and Moses both of them being well
[1:01:39] established but one made the right
[1:01:41] choice and one one didn't how brother
[1:01:45] branham even brought out the point that
[1:01:46] when when the rich none really got all
[1:01:48] the way down to the end the quote said
[1:01:51] he had nowhere to step
[1:01:53] he had nowhere to step you got all the
[1:01:55] way down to a knee I had nowhere else to
[1:01:57] go
[1:01:58] right no else to step in and I tell you
[1:02:00] what you don't want that to ever be your
[1:02:02] testimony that you get all the way down
[1:02:05] to me and you just got nothing else to
[1:02:08] do I want to go directly into the
[1:02:10] presence of God I want that to be my
[1:02:12] last step take me right into his
[1:02:14] presence right but but I tell you I just
[1:02:17] I just appreciate that that was that was
[1:02:20] wonderful
[1:02:20] Amen let's give the Lord another hand of
[1:02:22] praise for our precious brother man well
[1:02:47] let's just sing a little song before we
[1:02:51] dismiss I want you to continue to keep a
[1:02:54] man brother Jerry in prayer you know I
[1:02:58] just I'll tell you I'm this year
[1:03:02] just seeing out and just what the Lord
[1:03:05] is doing here in our midst brother Jerry
[1:03:09] his first time in Troy was his first
[1:03:11] time and when I heard both of them a man
[1:03:14] speak for the first time I said well my
[1:03:16] lord
[1:03:17] you know they got something that they
[1:03:18] need that you know that they can say and
[1:03:21] you know and I'm just grateful just to
[1:03:24] see how the Lord is just elevating one
[1:03:27] of the things that I have been praying
[1:03:28] for and asking the Lord for its help
[1:03:32] right we need help and and you know the
[1:03:36] other thing about that is that when you
[1:03:38] see things like this my biggest concern
[1:03:43] is that I let me put it this way all the
[1:03:49] brothers that since spirit and truth are
[1:03:51] not called administer I wouldn't want it
[1:03:54] to be that way I would want to be that
[1:03:57] way because we got a whole bunch of
[1:03:58] chiefs and no Indians we got problems
[1:04:01] y'all understand what I'm saying right
[1:04:03] what what we're trying to do is find
[1:04:06] where everybody fits in their place
[1:04:09] right and when you when you get into
[1:04:12] your place and you're anointed and what
[1:04:14] you're doing then the church just run
[1:04:16] they're very smooth right but but I
[1:04:19] don't want a spirit of jealousy to rise
[1:04:22] up or any of that you know I just I mean
[1:04:24] if somebody got an anointing you work
[1:04:26] with them with where that anointing is
[1:04:28] but but please you know you don't want
[1:04:30] it to be where man I'm gonna go do what
[1:04:33] I got it
[1:04:35] don't God will God does it in his own
[1:04:38] time right the Bible say a man's gift
[1:04:40] make room for himself and bringing him
[1:04:42] before great man and and and one of the
[1:04:46] other things is I never like to have
[1:04:47] anybody you know like my uncle told me
[1:04:51] that there's a man went to church one
[1:04:52] time and they say he went to told my
[1:04:55] uncle say I'm going to my past on
[1:04:57] something I'm gonna tell him to let me
[1:04:58] preach my uncle say no don't don't don't
[1:05:01] do that say no i'ma let him know I've
[1:05:03] been sitting here for a long time tell
[1:05:04] him to let me preach she said no no no
[1:05:06] when it's time for you to preach God
[1:05:08] will speak to your pastor and then tell
[1:05:11] you when it's time for you to go forward
[1:05:13] that's the way it work but you don't go
[1:05:15] and tell nobody this is what I'm gonna
[1:05:16] do cuz that's not God actually doing it
[1:05:19] that's you doing it right so well you
[1:05:21] know church let's be let's pray for one
[1:05:23] another right let's pray for each other
[1:05:25] and and and I want next year I'm looking
[1:05:28] to just kind of see these brothers just
[1:05:30] keep moving on and you don't just see
[1:05:32] God just use them and and I look up
[1:05:34] there everybody to get behind him push
[1:05:36] him on a little further a man encouraged
[1:05:39] their hearts and totally said something
[1:05:41] encouraging to you right and a man will
[1:05:43] just see what God got in store cuz it's
[1:05:45] I tell you what it's not a one-man
[1:05:46] ministry it's not a one-man ministry and
[1:05:50] that's that's not what it's all about
[1:05:52] but the other thing is we look for a
[1:05:55] life and the first thing if you can get
[1:05:58] you can have a gift but you ain't got no
[1:05:59] life we can't use you that's just bottom
[1:06:02] line there's got to be a life verse

[1:06:06] we've seen and a man and our precious
[1:06:09] brothers and and y'all just continue to
