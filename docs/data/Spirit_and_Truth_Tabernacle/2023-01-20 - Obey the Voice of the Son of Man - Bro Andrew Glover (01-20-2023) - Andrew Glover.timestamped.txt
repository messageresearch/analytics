[29:41] days but it is a real honor to be here
[29:43] with you all again and
[29:44] I was just tearing sharing every brother
[29:46] Troy was walking around he said we are
[29:49] here and then brother Jack was kind of
[29:51] sharing with me a little bit about your
[29:52] building situation and we were just this
[29:54] week or last weekend rather out in
[29:56] Kansas some of you may know Brother Sam
[29:58] Parker he started an assembly there in
[30:01] Bentley Kansas and they started in a
[30:03] community center renting it and they'd
[30:05] want to have a meeting and they had to
[30:06] get permission to have the meat and then
[30:08] they'd go back and all kinds of things
[30:10] and about about six months ago there was
[30:13] an old church there in Bentley had a
[30:16] fellowship hall a parsonage in a
[30:18] building and the people come to him and
[30:20] said look we want to make sure that this
[30:22] building remains a church so would you
[30:24] all be interested in it he said well he
[30:27] said how much are you asking they said
[30:28] well we really hate to ask this but
[30:31] we're just asking a thousand dollars and
[30:34] if that's too much we'll come down just
[30:37] a little bit uh just to make sure you
[30:40] all can keep this building as a church
[30:42] and so I actually preached in a building
[30:44] last week that they got for a thousand
[30:46] dollars and they put a new roof on it
[30:49] before they turned it over to him so
[30:50] amen I believe if God did that in Kansas
[30:53] amen I believe God can do it right here
[30:56] in West Palm Beach amen he remains to be
[30:59] God right he's still Jehovah Jireh amen
[31:02] he he'll meet the need of his children
[31:04] amen I I was actually preaching out
[31:06] there and I told him I said if you back
[31:08] this message God will back you amen and
[31:11] you all been faithful in this community
[31:12] for many years to this message and God
[31:14] will give you the desires of your heart

[32:10] Father Lord as we step in this building
[32:13] tonight we are very well aware that this

[32:18] more than just a place that has been
[32:20] designated for your children together

[32:24] word but Lord this is your provided
[32:26] place that you've given us tonight Lord
[32:28] father to step into the light of your
[32:31] presence and father as we come here
[32:32] tonight we are a needy people Lord we
[32:35] have many needs here I am a firm
[32:37] believer tonight Lord if I was to pass
[32:39] this microphone through the entire
[32:41] congregation Lord and every person would
[32:43] give a need they have and we would
[32:45] calculate those needs and write them
[32:47] down father when the last person had
[32:49] spoken when the last need had been made
[32:51] known I would still be able to say
[32:53] there's not a need in this room but what
[32:55] God can meet and tonight father we
[32:58] invite you in this building may you take
[33:00] control of my thoughts take control of
[33:02] my heart take control of the Direction

[33:23] of no ways father Lord you're still a
[33:25] Creator we stand in a special place
[33:27] tonight not by accident not by chance
[33:30] but father by your provision now Lord
[33:32] may you drive every Spirit out of this
[33:34] building that's unlike the Holy Spirit
[33:36] and Lord May Liberty fall in this field
[33:38] and may may the spirit of Revelation and
[33:41] power of creation may it move throughout
[33:43] this room dear God and may healing take
[33:45] place Deliverance is Father fill with
[33:48] the Holy Ghost Lord forgive us of our
[33:50] failures forgive us of our shortcomings
[33:52] and Lord whatever is accomplished during
[33:54] these meetings this weekend we'll be
[33:56] sure to give you all the praise all the
[33:58] honor and all the glory for it's in the
[34:00] wonderful name of our Lord and Savior
[34:02] Jesus Christ we do pray and all the
[34:05] Believers says a man and amen The Book
[34:08] of John the fifth chapter the 21st verse
[34:12] Jesus here speaking he says for as the
[34:16] father raiseth up the dead and
[34:18] quickeneth them even so the son
[34:21] quickeneth whom he will
[34:23] for the father judgeth no man but hath
[34:26] committed all judgment unto the son that
[34:29] all men should honor the son even as
[34:31] they honor the father now he that
[34:33] honereth not the son on Earth not the
[34:36] Father which hath sent him verily verily
[34:39] I say unto you he that heareth my word
[34:42] but remember said understandeth my word
[34:45] and believeth on him that sent me hath
[34:48] everlasting life and shall not come into
[34:51] the Judgment but is passed from Death
[34:53] unto life I love the way brother
[34:55] Brandman says that one time he says rub
[34:57] that out if you can amen there's no
[34:59] possible way to rub that out it's a
[35:01] promise to the believer for verily
[35:03] verily I say unto you the hour is coming
[35:05] and now is when the dead shall hear the
[35:08] voice of the Son of God and they that
[35:10] hear shall live for as the father hath
[35:12] life in himself so hath he given to the
[35:15] son to have life in himself and he that
[35:18] given authority to execute judgment also
[35:21] because he is the son of man now he he
[35:24] is the son of man how many believes he
[35:26] is the Son of Man Marvel not at this for
[35:30] the hour is coming in which all that are
[35:32] in the graves shall hear his voice and
[35:35] shall come forth they that have done
[35:37] good unto the resurrection of life and
[35:38] they that have done evil unto the
[35:41] resurrection of damnation now if we
[35:43] could turn to the Book of Revelation the
[35:45] 10th chapter
[35:46] a few readings here tonight Revelation
[35:49] 10 a very very familiar scripture to the
[35:52] Believers in this hour in Revelation 10
[35:56] and I want to look in the seventh verse
[35:58] I I know we could all probably read this
[36:01] verse by heart but in Revelation 10
[36:05] and verse 7. the Bible here says
[36:09] but in the days of the voice of the
[36:12] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[36:15] sound the mystery of God should be
[36:18] finished as he have declared to his
[36:21] servants Amen in the days of the voice
[36:24] so we're speaking of that voice again of
[36:26] the seventh angel when he shall begin to
[36:28] sound the mystery or the culmination of
[36:32] God should be finished as he has
[36:34] declared to his servants the prophets
[36:36] now I want to read one verse with you
[36:38] again in Luke 17. back to Luke 17 you
[36:42] all forgive me I got a bit of reputation
[36:45] there at home of having a lot of opening
[36:46] scriptures but I love studying the word
[36:50] underneath a Vindicated Prophet Amen in
[36:53] Luke 17
[36:55] in verse 30 another scripture we could
[36:58] read by heart but Jesus here says even
[37:01] thus shall it be in the day when the son
[37:04] of man is revealed remember said Lord
[37:06] Jesus Christ is made manifest in his
[37:09] people when the son of man is revealed
[37:13] we ask the Lord this evening to add the
[37:14] blessing to the reading of his word as
[37:16] you can have your seats here this
[37:17] afternoon I I want to by the help of the
[37:19] Lord for just a few moments tonight to
[37:21] speak to you from these different
[37:23] passages of scripture and if I speak to
[37:25] you tonight on the title I want to title
[37:28] this obey the voice of the son of man
[37:30] obey the voice of the son of man I was
[37:34] just listened the other day to a tape
[37:35] and brother remember says like this and
[37:37] Faith he comes down to the end of the
[37:38] tape and he says now 1956 I'm going to
[37:41] ask you all to be reverent just as
[37:42] reverent as you can you say brother
[37:44] Branham what are you talking about
[37:46] you're stalling I am exactly see I'm
[37:49] waiting for that angel of the Lord to
[37:51] come that's exactly right I don't know
[37:53] none of you and how could not do
[37:55] anything he says I can't it's him he
[37:59] said I can't do it even when he comes
[38:01] unless your faith operates it it's not
[38:04] me I can't see Visions unless it's your
[38:06] faith that does it sure he said God's
[38:09] Will by Divine gift the only thing I do
[38:12] is just keep yielding myself and as I
[38:14] get myself completely yielded to the
[38:17] Holy Spirit then he starts talking see
[38:20] it's no me he is using my voice amen
[38:23] amen it's not me he is using my voice
[38:27] see it's not me it's him that's exactly
[38:30] what the scripture says so what a
[38:32] prophet of God was doing was taking the
[38:34] emphasis off of himself and he was
[38:37] placing it on someone else now he was
[38:39] not placing the Head Upon a bishop or
[38:41] upon a cardinal upon a pulp or Upon A
[38:43] group of men but he was placing the
[38:46] authority back on the one amen that was
[38:48] giving him the authority to operate in
[38:51] the office he was operating them he
[38:53] would say see it's not me it's him he is
[38:56] just using my voice now in John the
[38:58] fifth chapter we read about the voice
[39:00] right Revelation 10 we read about the
[39:02] voice but remember says 1958 he said if
[39:05] you can hear a voice that's speaking to
[39:06] you that's God see because it copes with
[39:09] the scripture if it doesn't then there's
[39:12] some kind of a wrong voice speaking to
[39:14] you amen that's right he said but the
[39:16] right voice will tell you he meant to
[39:18] follow the rules of the Bible so there
[39:21] there is a right voice and there is a
[39:23] wrong voice and the prophet is saying if
[39:25] it's a voice that's coming from the word
[39:27] it's going to tell you to follow the
[39:30] rules of the Bible he said there'll be
[39:32] no sprinkling there'll be no poor and
[39:34] there'll be no falsely he said but come
[39:36] right straight and follow the rules of
[39:39] the Bible now that was not me saying
[39:41] that but that was the seventh angel amen
[39:44] declaring to the church if you're going
[39:46] to receive the blessing you've got to
[39:48] come God's provided way and it's to
[39:51] follow the scriptures of the Bible I I
[39:53] like to say it like this amen seventh
[39:55] thing so amen was not the mighty angel
[39:58] of Revelation 10 1 amen but he was a
[40:00] spokesman amen for the angel of Christ
[40:03] The Covenant Angel then when you begin
[40:05] to realize that there is a spokesman
[40:06] that has come do you realize that a
[40:08] spokesman a true spokesman amen does not
[40:11] send himself he he does not go to school
[40:13] and learn how to say things he does not
[40:15] amen get sent out by a group of men amen
[40:18] but God sends a spokesman the Bible says
[40:21] in Hebrews 12 25 amen see that you
[40:24] refuse not him amen that speaketh for if
[40:27] they escape not who refused him that
[40:29] spake on Earth then how much more shall
[40:31] we not Escape if we turn away from him
[40:33] amen that speaketh from heaven so here
[40:36] is somebody on the earth that is
[40:38] speaking amen but they're not speaking
[40:40] by the inspiration of the earth amen
[40:43] they are speaking by their inspiration
[40:44] of Heaven I love that word speaketh it
[40:47] means to articulate sounds amen it means
[40:50] to declare one's mind amen by speech or
[40:53] by sound amen so before word comes out
[40:56] of the mouth it has been a thought
[40:57] somewhere
[40:59] before a word comes out of the mouth it
[41:01] has been a thought somewhere amen and
[41:03] the only thing that word is doing is
[41:05] declaring amen what was in the mind now
[41:08] let me set you like this we had a
[41:10] Prophet come in this generation and said
[41:12] I'm going to go all the way back to the
[41:14] back part of God's mind amen and reveal
[41:17] to you the Hidden Mysteries and the
[41:19] secrets amen of what God was thinking in
[41:21] the back part of his mind I don't think
[41:23] it's a coincidence amen that we've got
[41:25] 1200 tapes Amen in books that have been
[41:28] recorded amen and it was not recorded
[41:31] the wind in the trees it was not
[41:33] recorded amen the Rocks hopping across
[41:35] the ground amen but there is a voice on
[41:37] those tapes there is a sound almost amen
[41:41] there is a speech on those tapes and
[41:43] that sound amen is not coming from a
[41:45] denomination it is not coming from a
[41:47] system and it's not coming amen from a
[41:50] personality but that voice amen is
[41:52] sounding from the heavens of Heaven amen
[41:54] it is sounding from the throne room of
[41:56] God and there is a sound that has come
[41:58] in this Center Nation it's not the sound
[42:01] of a Kentucky hillbilly it's not the
[42:03] sound of a Preacher amen it's the sound
[42:05] of redemption it's the sound of Freedom
[42:08] it's the sound of Deliverance it's the
[42:10] sound of Correction it's the sound of
[42:13] righteousness it's the sound of Victory
[42:15] I'm on Church we're not here together
[42:16] tonight amen hearing a bunch of sounds
[42:19] without a distinction amen between what
[42:21] is piped and what is harmed amen but
[42:23] we've got a stone amen and it's a trying
[42:26] Stone and it'll try the voice amen and I
[42:29] propose to you tonight any voice that
[42:31] says anything contrary to what this word
[42:33] teaches it's not a right voice it is a
[42:36] wrong voice and we ought to squash it we
[42:39] ought to squash its influence we
[42:41] shouldn't listen to it another second of
[42:42] Our Lives we are not following a wrong
[42:45] voice We are following a right voice
[42:47] amen it's a voice of authority it's a
[42:50] voice of power now amen that word
[42:51] speaketh means to declare my mind
[42:53] declare one's Mind by speech or by sound
[42:56] you all know amen that according to the
[42:58] Bible there are two types of sounds
[43:00] there is a certain sound and then there
[43:02] is an uncertain sound and Paul said if
[43:05] the trumpet gives an uncertain sound
[43:07] then who shall prepare himself for the
[43:10] battle right amen if the trumpet now
[43:12] he's just identified amen where the
[43:15] sound is coming from it is coming from a
[43:17] trumpet if the trumpet give an uncertain
[43:20] sound who shall prepare himself for the
[43:22] battle you go to Revelation 1 10 John
[43:25] says amen I was in the spirit on the
[43:27] Lord's day and I heard behind me a great
[43:30] voice amen as of a trumpet he has just
[43:34] connected The Voice Amen to the trumpet
[43:36] and a prophet comes along and says
[43:38] trumpet is an announcement see amen
[43:41] Gabriel at the coming of the Lord amen
[43:43] shall sound the Trump of God he said
[43:45] this was God's trumpet blowing in other
[43:48] words he's fixing to announce Amen to
[43:51] Eternal destination of the world Listen
[43:53] friends we are not here tonight they've
[43:56] been preparing for an eighth Church age
[43:57] we are not here tonight God Amen
[44:00] preparing to receive an eighth day
[44:01] messenger amen but the next step for the
[44:04] Church of the Living God Amen is back
[44:06] into eternity where she come from listen
[44:09] you may be playing church but I want to
[44:10] tell you amen play time's over amen the
[44:13] Bell has sounded recessed his sin is
[44:15] it's time to get down to business with
[44:17] God this ain't time to be playing church
[44:20] this ain't time to be just well who's
[44:22] who and who's not and well glory to God
[44:24] can we preach amen who likes who who
[44:26] don't like who that's not what we're
[44:28] here for tonight we got a Rapture to
[44:30] take we got a body change to go into we
[44:33] got a future home to go to we got a
[44:35] marriage supper of the lamb and this
[44:37] trumpet sound in this voice amen is
[44:40] dealing with eternal destination of the
[44:43] world he said a trumpet what is it get
[44:45] ready I'm going to give you the
[44:47] revelation of Jesus Christ
[44:49] when John heard that trumpet he said get
[44:53] ready I'm going to give you the
[44:55] revelation of Jesus Christ now brother
[44:57] Jack why was he giving him that
[44:58] revelation Nation he said to give to the
[45:01] church I will speak to you and what will
[45:04] be the destination of the world Amen is
[45:07] for those who receive and those who
[45:09] reject amen can you say it with me
[45:11] receive or reject amen see you'll either
[45:15] receive what is coming from that voice
[45:17] you will receive what is coming from
[45:19] that trumpet and you will receive it and
[45:21] go to your Eternal destination amen or
[45:24] you will reject it and you'll still go
[45:26] to a destination amen say it's not up to
[45:29] you Amen to determine whether the
[45:31] trumpet is Vindicated or not it's
[45:33] already been Vindicated it's not up to
[45:35] you to determine whether we should
[45:37] preach what a prophet said it's already
[45:39] been Vindicated that we should say what
[45:41] a prophet is saying amen then it's up to
[45:44] us tonight amen to receive the words of
[45:46] lies or to reject the words of Lies but
[45:48] listen friends I believe I'm preaching
[45:50] to a group amen that is not among the
[45:52] thorns and they're not among the rocks
[45:55] amen but they're among the good ground
[45:56] that when the word which is a c eat amen
[46:00] begins to go forth they can receive that
[46:02] word and as they receive that word it's
[46:05] more than a sermon it's more than a
[46:07] special meaning it's more than a shout
[46:09] hallelujah time it is them becoming the
[46:11] word amen listen friends God is Not
[46:14] rapturing books he's not rapturing
[46:16] pictures but he's going to Rapture the
[46:18] word and it's become flesh in the
[46:20] generation you're living I say it's high
[46:22] time Amen to become one with his word
[46:25] until the very pulsation in your heart
[46:27] is pulsating Jesus Christ it's the same
[46:30] yesterday today and forever listen this
[46:33] message ought to get your attention this
[46:35] message ought to change the way we do
[46:37] things and all that change the way we
[46:39] conduct ourselves
[46:40] come on it's a message of change amen
[46:43] and if you receive it it'll be a
[46:45] blessing if you reject it it'll be a
[46:47] curse amen what's it going to do it's
[46:49] going to be a sound but it's not going
[46:51] to be any kind of sound amen it's going
[46:53] to be unarticulate sound so in other
[46:55] words when you hear a prophet there's no
[46:58] longer going to be a question on whether
[46:59] it's right or whether it's wrong
[47:02] can I preach them in it and that there's
[47:04] no longer going to be a question on
[47:06] whether it's right or whether it's wrong
[47:08] do you know why we got questions it's
[47:10] because men has gone beyond what a
[47:12] prophet taught and they Blaze the trails
[47:15] to find new revelation and they cannot
[47:17] back it up in the Bible Well I might as
[47:19] well preach them here and they can't
[47:21] back it up in the Bible they can't back
[47:22] it up in the message amen but because
[47:24] there's some personality attached to
[47:27] that Doctrine people think they all
[47:28] receive it but I propose to you that as
[47:31] the Church of the Living God you are not
[47:33] subject to anything except when a
[47:35] prophet is told you're not subject to
[47:37] how a preacher feels you're not subject
[47:39] to how a church feels you are subject to
[47:41] the word and if you receive the word
[47:44] that word will change you if you receive
[47:46] that word that word will lift you up out
[47:48] of it bold rooms of Life it'll lift you
[47:50] up out of the Town Hallelujah it'll lift
[47:53] you up out of the ash Heats it'll lift
[47:55] you up out of the gutters it'll set you
[47:57] in a place of authority how will you get
[47:59] there you will get there by the word
[48:01] amen I think it's amazing in the Malachi
[48:03] 4 amen God promised to do what he
[48:06] promised to send a prophet to this
[48:08] generation let me say it to you like
[48:09] this a true prophet of God is Not
[48:12] man-made he's not man called he's God
[48:14] sent
[48:16] and God has kept his voice alive amen
[48:19] from Eden remember said from Eden and
[48:22] since Eden amen through the prophets now
[48:25] listen there's always been a battle he
[48:27] meant to silence the voice of God and
[48:29] remember when Abel was killed by Cain
[48:31] right his purpose was Amen to silence
[48:35] the voice of God and to kill the seed of
[48:38] Resurrection that was coming through the
[48:40] lineage amen but watch a prophet say it
[48:42] like this when Cain killed Abel God
[48:45] raised up Seth amen now watch this and
[48:47] when Seth went off the scene amen God
[48:49] raised up another one then I can tell
[48:51] you tonight by Authority amen that the
[48:54] same voice that was speaking in the book
[48:56] of in the Book of Genesis in the Garden
[48:58] of Eden is the same voice that is
[49:01] speaking in this building tonight it's
[49:03] not the voice of Andrew cover it's not
[49:05] the voice of Jack Dove it's not the
[49:07] voice of Willie Smiley it is the voice
[49:10] amen of Jesus Christ the son of God Amen
[49:13] I tell you like this it's very important
[49:15] Amen to believe that God sent him amen
[49:18] that speaketh in the generation that
[49:20] you're living listen it's not enough
[49:22] just to believe God sent him amen but
[49:24] you've got to receive him you've got to
[49:26] receive him who God has sent is that all
[49:30] right you got to receive him who God has
[49:33] sent amen I'll tell you like this the
[49:35] works of God Amen is more than dancing
[49:37] the aisles and then the works of God is
[49:39] more than shouting or two Hills off amen
[49:41] The Works of God is more than speaking
[49:43] in tongues amen but in this generation a
[49:46] prophet identified with the works of God
[49:48] is he said it's believeth on him who God
[49:51] has said listen friends we got people
[49:53] shouting the eyes and can't even shake
[49:55] hands with one another we got people
[49:57] dancing shines and they can't even love
[49:59] one another amen we got people shouting
[50:02] and speaking in tongues and arguing with
[50:04] what a prophet told but in the last days
[50:06] they would be a people who would rise up
[50:08] and they would not be a rebellious
[50:10] people they would be an obedient people
[50:12] and they would believe him who God sent
[50:15] they would receive him who God sent they
[50:17] just wouldn't believe it brother Troy
[50:19] and they wouldn't just receive it but
[50:21] they would obey him who God is sin and
[50:24] that obedience would unlock the
[50:26] supernatural power of almighty God
[50:29] we got to believe him who God sent well
[50:31] the song we got to receive him who God
[50:33] said but we've got to obey him
[50:36] oh we got to obey him you say God sent
[50:39] yeah in the Dark Ages the word was
[50:41] almost entirely lost to the people amen
[50:44] but God sent Luther with the word and
[50:46] the Lutheran spoke for God but they
[50:48] organized and again the pure word was
[50:50] lost amen because organization tends
[50:53] towards dogma and Creeds and not simple
[50:55] words they could no longer speak for God
[50:57] but then God sent Wesley are you
[51:00] catching it here God sent Luther God
[51:03] sent Wesley he was the voice with the
[51:05] word in his name and the people who took
[51:08] his Revelation from God became living
[51:10] Epistles red and known of all men amen
[51:13] for their generation and when the
[51:15] methodists failed God raised up others
[51:18] and so has gone on to the years until in
[51:21] this last day there is again another
[51:23] people well I feel like I'm preaching
[51:25] that people there is another people in
[51:28] the land amen notice who's not above
[51:31] their messenger they're not beside their
[51:33] messenger but they're under their
[51:35] messenger and they will be the time of
[51:37] voice Amen to the final age among Church
[51:40] we're not above the seventh angel we're
[51:42] underneath the seventh angel we're not
[51:44] beside the seventh angel we're
[51:46] underneath that seventh angel and by
[51:49] being underneath him he's messaged not
[51:51] the man the message has become the
[51:53] headship or the leadership to the church
[51:56] what are you saying I'm saying the final
[51:58] voice to the final age amen is going to
[52:00] call a final people let me say you are
[52:03] the final voice to the final age you're
[52:06] the final people
[52:08] well Hallelujah you are the final people
[52:11] that are the written Epistles that are
[52:13] read of all men remember said you got to
[52:15] get that Living Word in you you have to
[52:17] have the Living God in you because the
[52:20] word in here is when God it's made flesh
[52:22] in you he said made Spirit life in you
[52:25] when it goes into your flesh and your
[52:28] faith and becomes life then you are a
[52:30] living example that's a mouthful when
[52:33] that word goes into your flesh amen and
[52:36] your faith and becomes a life he said
[52:39] then you are a living example you are an
[52:42] Epistle of God rid of all men he said
[52:45] you won't have it like Christ not the
[52:47] fullness amen because it was divided up
[52:49] on the day of Pentecost and then let me
[52:52] let me lay this in here again it is
[52:54] important to receive amen and believe he
[52:57] that speaketh but it's also important to
[52:59] obey him that God has sent and him that
[53:02] you have received now I'm not going to
[53:04] focus so much tonight amen upon he who
[53:06] God is saying that is identified there
[53:09] is no question beyond the side of it now
[53:11] amen that the prophet of Malachi 4 is
[53:14] the angel of Revelation 10 7. amen is
[53:16] the angel of Revelation 18. are you
[53:18] hearing me there's no question that is
[53:20] settled amen now let me go a step
[53:22] further and say Amen there's no question
[53:24] here amen whether you receive that
[53:26] that's the truth or not amen you all
[53:28] sitting right here nodding your heads
[53:30] amen I believe it amen but the question
[53:32] he is amen have you obeyed amen he who
[53:35] God sent in the generation that you're
[53:38] living in
[53:39] because the Bible says in Exodus 23 amen
[53:42] verse 20 behold I send an angel before
[53:45] they notice his angels before thee Amen
[53:47] to keep me in the way and to bring me to
[53:50] the place which I have prepared beware
[53:52] of him and obey his voice and provoke
[53:55] him not amen for he will not pardon your
[53:58] transgression for my name is in him
[54:01] amen obey his voice amen if Thou shalt
[54:05] indeed obey his voice and do all that I
[54:08] speak then I will be an enemy unto thine
[54:10] enemies and an adversary unto thine
[54:13] adversaries for mine Angel shall go
[54:15] before thee and shall bring thee into
[54:17] the amorites and the Hittites and the
[54:18] parasites and the Canaan and the
[54:20] highlights and the champion science
[54:22] notice this and I will cut them off thou
[54:25] shall not bow down to their gods Lord
[54:27] serve them nor do after their works but
[54:29] Thou shalt utterly overthrow them and
[54:31] quiet break down their images and ye
[54:34] shall serve the Lord your God he shall
[54:36] bless thy bread and thy water amen and I
[54:39] will take sickness away from the midst
[54:41] of thee amen but what phrase does he
[54:44] keep saying obey his voice if you will
[54:47] obey his voice amen that he will bless
[54:50] your bread if you will obey his voice he
[54:52] will bless your water if he if you will
[54:55] obey his voice he will remove sickness
[54:57] out of the midst of thee I'll just say
[54:59] it to you like this brother Smiley I
[55:01] believe that obedience is very important
[55:03] I don't believe it's optional I don't
[55:05] believe it's it's a possibility amen my
[55:08] Bible says behold to obey amen is better
[55:11] to than to sacrifice amen and to hearken
[55:14] than the fat of rams said obedience is
[55:16] the best he says one place like this
[55:19] obedience unlocks the supernatural now
[55:21] if you look in Genesis 22 and verse 15
[55:24] the angel of the Lord amen calling to
[55:27] Abraham Out of Heaven the second time
[55:29] and said by myself have I sworn saith
[55:31] the Lord for because thou has done the
[55:33] thing and it's not withheld thy son
[55:35] thine only son amen that in blessing I
[55:38] will blessing and in multiplying I will
[55:41] multiply that seed as the stars of the
[55:43] heaven and as the sandwiches upon the
[55:45] seashore and thy seed shall possess the
[55:49] Gate of his enemies and in thy seed
[55:51] shall the nations of the earth be
[55:53] blessed because he hath obeyed my voice
[55:56] among church amen the blessing upon the
[55:59] Seed of Abraham amen that would be
[56:01] manifested in Samson would be manifested
[56:04] in samgara goes all the way back to
[56:06] Abraham amen as a father being obedient
[56:09] to the voice of God come on now amen you
[56:12] say we were there it's hard to obey
[56:14] imagine being Abraham
[56:16] imagine being Abraham and God tells you
[56:19] take your boy up on the mountain lay him
[56:22] up on the altar amen cut his neck amen
[56:24] lay him out there as a blood sacker come
[56:26] on now and imagine being Isaac walking
[56:29] with Abraham Amen brother jack up the
[56:31] mountain this wasn't the first time that
[56:33] boy went to church he had been to
[56:35] sacrifice many times he had been to
[56:37] worship many times he could look and see
[56:39] the wood he could look and see the stone
[56:41] he could look and see the night amen but
[56:44] down in his heart was a question daddy
[56:45] amen there's the wood there's a knife
[56:48] there's a Rock Amen but where is the
[56:50] sacrifice amen but because Abraham amen
[56:53] was an obedient servant of the almighty
[56:56] God he said Isaac you just don't worry
[56:58] about it our God will provide himself
[57:00] amen of sacrifice and you know what
[57:03] Abraham's obedience done amen Abraham
[57:06] went up on the mountain he showed up to
[57:08] church on Sunday morning he told her I'm
[57:10] preaching to you now he didn't stay home
[57:12] amen he didn't call 50 other people
[57:14] that's all wadded up in their spare it
[57:16] and Argan question he went and did what
[57:19] God called him to do and right there in
[57:22] the Coos moment right there in the
[57:24] crucial hour amen Abraham's obedience
[57:26] unlocked they've been the providing
[57:28] element of Jehovah and out of nowhere a
[57:31] ram appeared and the prophet said it was
[57:34] not a vision he said it was a real Ram
[57:36] he said Abraham cut it and the ram bled
[57:39] and he carried Isaac back home what are
[57:42] you saying I'm saying I'm going to
[57:43] preach her for a second if you'll stay
[57:45] in line if you'll stay in position if
[57:48] you'll obey the voice of the Angel amen
[57:51] God will come down on a Friday night
[57:52] when Praises are going up he'll come
[57:55] down on a Friday night and unlock
[57:57] Supernatural blessings in the middle of
[58:00] West Palm Beach upon a supernatural
[58:02] people who are not just a bunch of
[58:05] church members but they are obedient
[58:07] Sons and Daughters of God
[58:09] oh what a promise amen because of
[58:13] obedience you realize the prophet of God
[58:15] said then prophets went out and preached
[58:16] the word he said they didn't want to go
[58:18] do it he said if they went anyhow he
[58:20] said not to be different but to be
[58:22] obedient
[58:23] he said it was a hard trial it was a
[58:26] hard burden but they were not doing it
[58:29] to be different they were doing it to be
[58:31] obedient he said see he would go out
[58:33] there and he would say the only thing I
[58:35] can say is what God has put in my mouth
[58:37] God had so much complete control of them
[58:40] amen until he was their voice amen he
[58:43] was their action amen I said like this
[58:46] the prophet said the signs of God are
[58:48] always overlooked amen one of God's
[58:51] signs amen is the coming of a prophet
[58:54] one of God's signs that's always
[58:56] overlooked is the coming of a prophet he
[59:00] said see those who are elected to see it
[59:02] does see it amen but the coming of a
[59:05] prophet was the sign that God was ready
[59:08] to speak listen when you've seen a
[59:10] prophet I know today we gotta we got a
[59:12] bunch of I think a brother call him the
[59:14] name bunch of prophet Liars he said they
[59:16] go around Prophet line you know oh write
[59:18] me a check for thirty thousand amen and
[59:20] God will give you 130 000. amen or go
[59:22] outside and touch your mouth box and
[59:24] drink this a bunch of ProFlowers amen I
[59:27] tell you this I tell you how much time
[59:28] should change in the Bible when the
[59:30] prophet showed up at your house it
[59:32] wasn't a shout and Hallelujah time it
[59:34] wasn't to kick his shoes off and Shout
[59:35] the house down amen God was coming to
[59:37] that house he meant to do business
[59:39] through his prophet and I think it's
[59:41] time the church the Living God Amen
[59:43] remember that God has sent us a prophet
[59:45] in this generation and he didn't just
[59:47] come to tickle our ears he didn't just
[59:49] come to give us a better understanding
[59:51] he'd been in the church down the road
[59:52] but he come to unlock the supernatural
[59:55] element that was hidden in the church
[59:57] underneath the five senses underneath
[59:59] the five hour and inner census there was
[1:00:02] a sixth sense laying there and it was
[1:00:04] the sense of faith and God sent a
[1:00:07] Prophet by his word to wake up that
[1:00:09] sense and to remind you that no matter
[1:00:11] how dark it is you can still praise God
[1:00:14] no matter how bad it is you can still
[1:00:16] praise God
[1:00:19] God is ready to speak because if God
[1:00:22] ain't going to speak then the prophet
[1:00:23] would not be on the earth amen remember
[1:00:25] unless the God was ready to speak then
[1:00:28] the prophet would not be on the earth
[1:00:29] now you all know that brother man
[1:00:31] preaches several messages called amen
[1:00:33] the voice of the sign right amen the
[1:00:36] voice of the sign he said see he wants
[1:00:38] an audience amen so the sign is given
[1:00:41] Amen to gather an audience to get their
[1:00:44] attention Amen to hear the voice see he
[1:00:47] wants somebody that's going to listen to
[1:00:49] what he's going to say the sign is an
[1:00:52] alert to attract the attention of the
[1:00:54] people amen that the word is getting
[1:00:57] ready to speak my when you see the sign
[1:01:01] it's only an alert it's a it's an
[1:01:04] announcement amen that the voice of the
[1:01:06] word is getting ready to speak now I
[1:01:09] said to you like this amen the other day
[1:01:10] I was somewhere I can't remember where I
[1:01:12] was brother Jack but somebody had a car
[1:01:13] out back and they still had a sign on
[1:01:16] the back of the car said believe the
[1:01:17] sign now amen I'm not here to preach and
[1:01:19] getting all that but I'm going to preach
[1:01:20] here for a second amen because amen that
[1:01:22] that rent right through here went right
[1:01:24] through the country amen believed the
[1:01:26] sign and I brother I was praying one day
[1:01:28] I was honestly praying I said Lord amen
[1:01:30] how can these people see what they've
[1:01:32] seen hear what they've heard been a part
[1:01:34] of churches they've been a part of and
[1:01:35] then turn around and go from believing
[1:01:37] the sign to rejecting the sign and I was
[1:01:39] praying one day listening to brother
[1:01:40] random and he stopped and he said it
[1:01:42] like this he said see see the sign but
[1:01:45] believe the voice I said oh there we go
[1:01:48] amen he never emphasized On Believing
[1:01:51] the sign he emphasized on seeing the
[1:01:53] sign amen but believing the voice of the
[1:01:56] sign amen was Forerunner I tell you why
[1:01:59] you're still here tonight it's not
[1:02:01] because you saw the sign it's not just
[1:02:03] because you saw the first and second
[1:02:05] pull but there was a seed on the inside
[1:02:08] of you there was a soul in there it
[1:02:11] wasn't a first pull Soul it wasn't a
[1:02:13] second pole Soul it was a third pool
[1:02:15] soul and that Soul was looking for the
[1:02:18] word and when you Saw the Sign amen
[1:02:20] behind the sign come the voice and the
[1:02:23] voice said come out of her my people and
[1:02:25] be separate saith the Lord come on we're
[1:02:28] not shouting because we saw the sign
[1:02:30] we're not dancing because we saw the
[1:02:32] sign we're shiling because we've heard
[1:02:35] the voice
[1:02:35] [Music]
[1:02:37] we heard the voice it was the Eagle's
[1:02:40] scream it was a sign Amen to get our
[1:02:43] attention to hear the pure unadulterated
[1:02:46] word of God
[1:02:48] oh they saw the sign but they never
[1:02:50] believed the voice but there's a bride
[1:02:52] here in the last days
[1:02:55] like this he said many will see the
[1:02:58] sign but only the elected will hear the
[1:03:01] voice
[1:03:03] many will see the sign but only elected
[1:03:06] will hear the voice you say that what is
[1:03:08] the voice according to the Prophet The
[1:03:10] Voice is the word
[1:03:13] so we were not looking for the fishes
[1:03:15] and Loaves we were not looking for the
[1:03:17] Miracles
[1:03:19] we were looking for the word now if you
[1:03:23] go back to Abraham I can't get away from
[1:03:25] you for a second the Bible says Abraham
[1:03:27] heard the voice it said come out from

[1:05:40] words if you're going to be a successful
[1:05:42] Soldier you've got to be able to say I'm
[1:05:44] wrong and the general is Right you've
[1:05:46] got to be able to say my opinion is not
[1:05:48] valid but his word is the truth I'm on
[1:05:51] church I'll tell you why we're in the
[1:05:53] heat of the battle and there's been some
[1:05:54] drop off to the left in the right it's
[1:05:56] because they couldn't say I'm wrong and
[1:05:58] William Branham is Right amen but there
[1:06:01] was an elected seed on the earth that
[1:06:03] was ordained to hear the voice and In
[1:06:05] the Heat of the battle she married this
[1:06:07] new anointed word and refused to turn
[1:06:10] from it but she marched Through The
[1:06:11] Valleys she marched across the mountains
[1:06:13] and she's still marching with the word
[1:06:15] because she's not here for the sign
[1:06:18] she's here for the word the principle of
[1:06:22] obedience
[1:06:24] and then I cannot preach to you for a
[1:06:26] second amen the principle of obedience
[1:06:28] was actually established when Jesus amen
[1:06:31] performed the first miracle you realize
[1:06:33] that the first miracle he's had a
[1:06:35] wedding and they run out of wine so what
[1:06:37] do they do and then they go over to
[1:06:39] Jesus and say listen oh we got's water
[1:06:41] Jesus said that's all right bring me the
[1:06:44] water pitcher full of water now they
[1:06:46] looked at him like he was crazy brother
[1:06:47] Smiley they said come on man amen we run
[1:06:50] out of wine we got plenty of water he
[1:06:52] said no just bring me the water
[1:06:54] and it and and Mary spoke up and saith
[1:06:57] in the servant whatsoever he saith unto
[1:07:00] you do it
[1:07:02] I can preach Sarah all night can I
[1:07:05] whatever he's safe unto you do it
[1:07:07] brother said that's still good teaching
[1:07:09] tonight whatever he saith unto you just
[1:07:12] do it if he tells you to make ready for
[1:07:14] death you get ready if he tells you
[1:07:16] you're going to get well you believe it
[1:07:18] if he tells you that you are healed you
[1:07:20] are whatever he says you do it this
[1:07:23] believe it is a sin
[1:07:25] whatever he says do you do it to
[1:07:29] disbelieve it is a sin now how many
[1:07:32] agrees that God sends his instructions
[1:07:34] to an age Amen to the angel messenger of
[1:07:37] that age now you agree with that right
[1:07:40] Paul says in First Corinthians 15 1 more
[1:07:43] over Brethren I declare unto you the
[1:07:45] gospel which I preached unto you which
[1:07:47] also you have received wherein you stand
[1:07:50] by which also you're saved if you keep
[1:07:53] in memory what I preached unto you
[1:07:54] unless you have believed in vain I'm
[1:07:57] sitting now watch he said watch this
[1:07:59] verse for I delivered unto you first of
[1:08:02] all that which I also received how that
[1:08:05] Christ died according for our sins
[1:08:08] according to the scriptures how many
[1:08:10] knows he was born according to the
[1:08:12] scripture he lived according to
[1:08:14] scripture amen he died according to
[1:08:16] scripture he was buried according to the
[1:08:19] scripture he arose brother Solomon on
[1:08:21] the third day amen according to the
[1:08:24] scripture
[1:08:25] see then what it was it was a voice amen
[1:08:29] that was a scriptural voice that was
[1:08:31] causing a life to cope with the word
[1:08:33] amen look at this word delivered it
[1:08:35] means to give into the hands of another
[1:08:37] it means to give over into one's power
[1:08:40] or use I love this one it means to
[1:08:43] deliver to one something to keep it
[1:08:45] means to deliver verbally so in other
[1:08:48] words what Paul was speaking amen had
[1:08:51] been delivered to him it was not an
[1:08:53] impression it was not a feeling amen it
[1:08:56] was a verbal voice that Paul heard amen
[1:08:59] that he come to the church and delivered
[1:09:01] it to the church now I can't help but
[1:09:03] preach here can I amen First Tape we got
[1:09:05] on record the prophet says we're getting
[1:09:06] some new gadgets for recording Malachi 4
[1:09:10] said we're getting some new gadgets for
[1:09:12] recording I'll just go this far to say
[1:09:14] Amen that the reason we got recording
[1:09:16] devices was to record The Voice amen of
[1:09:19] the seventh angel in the last days now
[1:09:21] we might as well preach and we Amen in
[1:09:23] the last days you were not under a
[1:09:25] Catholic spirit
[1:09:27] we're not under a Catholicism spirit I
[1:09:30] listen I know you ministers here some of
[1:09:32] you Brothers here been around a lot
[1:09:33] longer than I have and you fought those
[1:09:35] battles but brother Brandon said this
[1:09:37] and brother Brian said that and brother
[1:09:38] bam said this amen and then you go
[1:09:40] searching never said nothing like that
[1:09:42] amen but they say well amen you know
[1:09:44] what amen it's there and there well can
[1:09:48] I preach a second I was preached one
[1:09:50] time and I heard a quote I read the
[1:09:51] quote and I went I quoted the brother
[1:09:53] come to me said that's not how it was I
[1:09:55] said no that's how brother said it was
[1:09:57] he said no that's not what he meant I
[1:09:59] said well I'm just going to say what he
[1:10:00] said he said no he said you didn't hear
[1:10:02] what he said I said I did hear what he
[1:10:04] said he said no you didn't hear what he
[1:10:05] said I said listen there's nothing wrong
[1:10:07] with my hearing I hear fine
[1:10:10] are you hearing me I'm no longer
[1:10:12] debating whether it's writer I heard it
[1:10:14] for myself I'm on church amen we might
[1:10:17] as well squash that Catholic devil it's
[1:10:19] crept its way right in this message
[1:10:20] where there's only certain men that can
[1:10:22] tell you a certain Revelation that is a
[1:10:24] Catholicism devil from the pits of hell
[1:10:27] you know why they bring the hell God
[1:10:29] have mercy you know why that devil
[1:10:31] Creeps in amen because if the Catholic
[1:10:33] gotta hold the Bible they would see that
[1:10:35] guy they've been kissing his ring and
[1:10:37] sending him money every day it's the
[1:10:39] viker of God he's the son of perdition
[1:10:41] amen but because they're blinded a blind
[1:10:44] person is easier to deal with amen but
[1:10:46] my Bible says in the end time that God
[1:10:49] would send an i7 to the church we would
[1:10:51] not be a bunch of blind leading the
[1:10:53] blind but we would have shot listen we
[1:10:55] can see for ourselves we can see Malachi
[1:10:58] 4 we can see the Holy Ghost we can see
[1:11:01] predestination we don't have to back up
[1:11:03] and say well brother can you tell me if
[1:11:05] it's okay to believe it we've heard it
[1:11:07] delivered verbally by the word
[1:11:11] oh come on Friends hey man I tell you
[1:11:14] how strong it is brother I'm coming 1965
[1:11:16] and says his Moses gathered them up on
[1:11:18] the mountain and said this day I
[1:11:20] received the Commandments he said so say
[1:11:22] unto you don't you add to or take away
[1:11:25] from these Commandments and brother
[1:11:26] Branham stood right there himself and
[1:11:28] said so say unto you don't you add to or
[1:11:31] take away from these tapes you say what
[1:11:34] is on them tapes
[1:11:36] Brothers said the only thing I can do is
[1:11:40] deliver the message just like he told me
[1:11:42] he said now Prince Albert Alberta
[1:11:44] Saskatchewan Faith 1956 Jesus died God's
[1:11:47] covenant and raised again that same
[1:11:49] Spirit was on him it's in the church and
[1:11:52] promised by God that would be to the end
[1:11:55] of the world it's up to you to receive
[1:11:57] it what are you saying I'm saying God's
[1:12:00] Duty bound ascended it's up to you to
[1:12:02] receive it whether you want it or not
[1:12:04] God takes his place he said God pokes
[1:12:07] his religion down nobody's throat amen
[1:12:09] the preacher might do it but God does it
[1:12:13] God does not poke his religion down
[1:12:15] anybody's throat he said he sent his
[1:12:18] word and it's up to you to receive it
[1:12:20] now Paul said I delivered I verbally I
[1:12:23] verbally turned over into your use what
[1:12:26] I received from Heaven amen first of all
[1:12:28] which I also receive look at this word
[1:12:31] received I love this definition brother
[1:12:33] Jack it means not to withhold obedience
[1:12:36] so if you actually receive something
[1:12:39] then you release your obedience to it
[1:12:43] oh my the Bible said he that happened
[1:12:46] here let him hear what the spirit is
[1:12:47] saying to the churches it may be that
[1:12:49] Millions will hear the words or even
[1:12:51] read them but how many will paid heed to
[1:12:54] them that we do not know but he who will
[1:12:57] lend his ear and want to know the words
[1:12:59] of truth will find the spirit of God
[1:13:02] enlightening him if your ear is open to
[1:13:05] the word the spirit of God will make the
[1:13:07] word real to you now that is the work of
[1:13:09] the spirit I can teach you the truth but
[1:13:12] if you don't open your ear to hear it
[1:13:14] and your heart to receive it amen then
[1:13:16] you won't get the Revelation you've got
[1:13:18] to open your mind you're going to open
[1:13:20] your spirit you've got to receive what's
[1:13:22] being teached but listen to really
[1:13:24] receive it you've got to release your
[1:13:26] obedience to it and your obedience will
[1:13:29] make you one with the word that you're
[1:13:31] here listen I think it's time that the
[1:13:33] colonel mind ought to be out of the
[1:13:34] church I think it's time for the
[1:13:36] spiritual mind of the spiritually
[1:13:38] elected by predestination to have the
[1:13:41] preeminence in the church
[1:13:43] like this he said I pray there's no
[1:13:45] carnal Minds Among Us that there is a
[1:13:47] spiritual mind Among Us that we can
[1:13:49] understand what the father is trying to
[1:13:51] get to us here another place it's all
[1:13:54] spiritual revealed truth laying right
[1:13:56] there but it takes the spiritual mind to
[1:13:59] catch it watch this amen seems
[1:14:01] Birmingham says that the spiritual mind
[1:14:03] is becoming numb
[1:14:06] the spiritual mind he says is becoming
[1:14:08] numb now you know that only the
[1:14:10] spiritual mind amen can actually catch
[1:14:13] the word teachings of the message of the
[1:14:15] hour like you you all know this right

[1:18:10] says brother Smiley I must have needs to

[1:18:14] Jesus Christ did not die Amen to produce
[1:18:17] a sob story hoping somebody would come
[1:18:20] along and read it feel sorry for him and
[1:18:22] Believe on him unto salvation he said
[1:18:24] but he died with a person in mind he
[1:18:27] died with names in mind and what were
[1:18:30] those names those were the names of
[1:18:32] redemption that was in the Lamb's Book
[1:18:34] of Life from before the foundation of
[1:18:36] the world come on church amen when Jesus
[1:18:38] went by the woman at the well he wasn't

[1:18:54] he knew what she would be wearing
[1:18:56] come on Church remember I'm sitting
[1:18:58] proving his word he said what did God do
[1:19:00] he prepared you to receive him in this
[1:19:03] age from before the foundation of the
[1:19:06] world listen she thought it was another
[1:19:07] day at the whale she just thought it was
[1:19:10] another Friday night service amen a
[1:19:12] spirit true Tabernacle but little did
[1:19:14] she know it was the breaking of a new
[1:19:16] day it was the dawn of a new chapter in
[1:19:18] her life the old was going to be washed
[1:19:21] away and all things were going to become
[1:19:23] new oh I pray God break out in the
[1:19:25] church again until we receive the word
[1:19:27] and we obey that word and we walk with
[1:19:30] that word and we march with that word
[1:19:32] regardless of the conditions
[1:19:36] now the prophet said like this I love
[1:19:38] the words he uses he said she stood
[1:19:40] there looking for the manifestation of
[1:19:43] the word notice the words he used she
[1:19:46] said we know Messiah cometh and it's
[1:19:48] going to do what he does and notice what
[1:19:50] Jesus said I am he
[1:19:52] that speaks to you
[1:19:55] I am he that is declaring what's in
[1:19:58] God's mind about you
[1:20:02] Hallelujah I am he that is articulating
[1:20:06] sounds to you I know you've heard Rabbi
[1:20:08] sounds you've heard the teacher sounds
[1:20:10] but I am he that's going to speak to you
[1:20:13] I'm going to declare to you what was in
[1:20:16] the back part of God's mind and before
[1:20:18] come on Church before she received the
[1:20:20] word what did she see she saw the sign
[1:20:23] she saw the sign of the son of man
[1:20:25] reveal the secrets of her heart and she
[1:20:28] said that ain't nothing but the truth
[1:20:29] but she didn't stop at the sign come on
[1:20:32] church she didn't stop at the sign amen
[1:20:35] she said messiah's coming he said I'm he
[1:20:38] that speaks to you brother what did she
[1:20:40] do she dropped roll denominational water
[1:20:42] bucket she dumped she dropped throw
[1:20:45] bucket and the Bible said she ran out in
[1:20:47] the city and said come see a man come on
[1:20:50] church amen five minutes before she met
[1:20:53] the Messiah she was a prostitute who had
[1:20:55] five husbands and was living with a
[1:20:57] sixth husband you don't think this
[1:20:59] message will bring you from to nobody
[1:21:01] ain't meant to be in a somebody get
[1:21:03] underneath the influence of the message
[1:21:05] of the hour it'll change the way people
[1:21:07] see you it'll change the way people
[1:21:09] think about you
[1:21:10] can I preach are you hearing me five
[1:21:14] minutes before sister Erica she was an
[1:21:16] ill-fame woman who the Bible says if she
[1:21:19] went in the community and there was kids
[1:21:20] playing in the street and she said
[1:21:22] little little Johnny get out of the road
[1:21:24] you might get run over but I said the
[1:21:27] fathers had told their children because
[1:21:29] of her condition don't you listen to her
[1:21:31] you laugh in her face and keep on going
[1:21:33] but my Bible said after she met the
[1:21:37] anointed word for her age that she
[1:21:39] dropped her water bucket and she ran
[1:21:41] into the City and she sold the men come
[1:21:44] see a man and the Bible says Men
[1:21:46] followed her testimony to meet the
[1:21:49] Messiah what made the difference I'll
[1:21:51] tell you what made the difference she
[1:21:53] got under the influence of the anointed

[1:25:13] hurry in the evidence of obedience was
[1:25:15] not quoting what Moses said it was
[1:25:18] applying the blood as Moses said see
[1:25:21] then what did obedience do it brought
[1:25:23] the Covenant into effect if you say you
[1:25:25] believe and you don't follow the
[1:25:28] instructions of the word then you don't
[1:25:31] believe so how do you obey the messenger
[1:25:33] then you obey the messenger by taking
[1:25:35] the message into your heart and allowing
[1:25:38] it to have access into your life now the
[1:25:40] prophet God said watch he said see in
[1:25:42] Genesis 6 he said Noah receive the
[1:25:44] dimensions from God to build the ark he
[1:25:47] said in him being a carpenter he went to
[1:25:50] work and began now go read Genesis and
[1:25:54] you'll read about we're going to be best
[1:25:56] friends for this weekend's over
[1:25:58] it's okay go read Genesis 6 and you'll
[1:26:03] read about about wood and gopher you'll
[1:26:05] hear about all right
[1:26:07] it's okay brother
[1:26:10] you
[1:26:12] I knocked a guitar down the other day so
[1:26:15] amen you'll read about all kinds of
[1:26:17] instructions right amen and Noah
[1:26:20] couldn't cut one corner because if he
[1:26:22] cut one corner the ark would have sunk
[1:26:24] God give him the dimensions on how to
[1:26:27] prepare the ark amen for the saving of
[1:26:29] his household and God said I'll meet you
[1:26:32] in there now watch this how many we got
[1:26:34] any Carpenters here tonight we got any
[1:26:36] Carpenters no any construction workers
[1:26:39] okay we got real Smiley okay I've yet as
[1:26:43] my grandfather was the Carpenter I've
[1:26:45] yet to meet a carpenter who got now
[1:26:47] maybe I maybe I love you buddy get this
[1:26:50] set of plans and look at him and say
[1:26:52] That's How we'll do it
[1:26:54] I remember my grandfather used to get
[1:26:56] plans all the time and the first thing
[1:26:57] he said was we can change this we can
[1:26:59] change that well amen amen but the plan
[1:27:02] said it ought to be done this way so
[1:27:04] what you start doing is cutting corners
[1:27:05] and when it's all said and done you got
[1:27:07] an arc falling apart you know why
[1:27:09] because you cut Corners when Moses
[1:27:12] received the instructions he did not
[1:27:15] take them down to the city hall lay him
[1:27:17] out on the board and say what do you all
[1:27:19] think about this message can we preach
[1:27:21] if a woman wears makeup she ought to be
[1:27:22] called dog meat can we preach it's wrong
[1:27:25] for a man to marry a man can we preach
[1:27:27] it's wrong for a woman I'm on Church
[1:27:28] Moses said Noah didn't take their
[1:27:30] instructions down and subject the
[1:27:32] message to popular opinion but they
[1:27:34] received the message and they deliver
[1:27:36] the message and the eight Souls that got
[1:27:39] on the ark obeyed what the message was
[1:27:41] saying and the children of Israel that
[1:27:43] left Egypt obeyed what the message was
[1:27:44] said what are you saying preacher I'm
[1:27:46] saying there's a bride in the last days
[1:27:48] that doesn't say I've got a better
[1:27:50] thought I think it can be done this way
[1:27:52] if you're going to obey this word word
[1:27:54] you don't have to change amen from your
[1:27:56] opinions to the word and obey every
[1:27:59] instruction what are you saying I'm
[1:28:00] saying obedience I'm hurrying obedience
[1:28:03] causes you to surrender your own
[1:28:06] thoughts you bring every fault into
[1:28:08] captivity to the what Obedience of
[1:28:11] Christ Reverend said what do you do you
[1:28:13] let the thoughts it was in Christ be in
[1:28:15] you and that's the word 1963 free
[1:28:18] thinking I do my own thinking you ain't
[1:28:21] got no thought coming what will you do
[1:28:23] with Jesus called Christ you ain't no
[1:28:25] free thinker there is no free thinking
[1:28:27] let the mind that was in Christ be in
[1:28:30] you
[1:28:32] now how many knows amen that oh my help
[1:28:36] me Lord how many knows amen that the
[1:28:39] mate of the church is the revealed word
[1:28:42] said the mate of the church is the
[1:28:45] revealed word so what God is doing then
[1:28:47] is he is opening your eyes of
[1:28:48] understanding and he's enlightening you
[1:28:51] to your mate to the revealed word of the
[1:28:53] hour and remember him said like this he
[1:28:55] said if you're the Seed of Abraham
[1:28:56] you'll recognize the spirit of Abraham
[1:28:58] of Christ which come through Abraham by
[1:29:01] the flesh so then may the Lord grant you
[1:29:03] tonight that your eyes of understanding
[1:29:05] will be opened and if you're here
[1:29:07] tonight as a lukewarm church member I'm
[1:29:09] not criticizing you my brother I believe
[1:29:11] you to be a Christian if you've
[1:29:13] confessed Christ but just in lukewarm
[1:29:15] State my sister I'm not criticizing you
[1:29:17] but I'm trying to tell you stop that
[1:29:20] little old formal way you're living and
[1:29:22] coming to Christ be anointed and go out
[1:29:24] and do something for him don't leave
[1:29:26] your church just make a real church on
[1:29:29] fire Christian in your church that's

[1:29:50] amen so get you some more leaves throw
[1:29:52] it back home there it'll burn hot and
[1:29:54] heavy for a few services and then it'll
[1:29:56] burn down but this bride's Revival is
[1:29:58] not a leaf Revival it is a long Revival
[1:30:01] so if you want the fire to burn you quit
[1:30:04] throwing leaves on it you quit throwing
[1:30:06] just camp memes and conventions but you
[1:30:09] lay some logs of the word on the church
[1:30:12] and let the fire of God's tracking and
[1:30:14] brother it'll burn when the church is

[1:30:27] the voice of Revelation has set her on
[1:30:29] fire and if you take that voice out of
[1:30:31] the church it'll become a lukewarm
[1:30:33] launch
[1:30:34] it'll come at lukewarm Lodge with a
[1:30:37] bunch of people arguing and fussing and
[1:30:39] carrying on Amen but if you get the
[1:30:40] voice of Revelation and the logs of the
[1:30:43] word I'm gonna I know people say well

[1:30:58] preacher for a second
[1:30:59] the message of the hour is the standard
[1:31:02] of judgment on the condition of life in
[1:31:05] a church not another church

[1:31:33] standard of judgment in the church
[1:31:34] listen I don't judge a church but how
[1:31:37] loud they can shout I don't judge a
[1:31:39] church but how hard they can dance I
[1:31:41] judge a church by their ability to say
[1:31:44] Amen to what a prophet is called
[1:31:46] concerning the word in the angel listen
[1:31:49] I'll tell you this there'll be people
[1:31:50] that'll never dance down the aisle but
[1:31:52] to walk on the streets of gold there'll
[1:31:54] be people that'll never speak in tongues
[1:31:56] but they'll sit at the marriage supper
[1:31:58] of the lamb and the same God that wipes
[1:32:01] the Shadows tears away will wipe the
[1:32:03] Believers tears away we're not here to
[1:32:06] make a bunch of Andrew Glover arts or
[1:32:07] any other preacherized we're here to
[1:32:09] preach the message and let the message
[1:32:11] break out with a spirit of influence
[1:32:13] until it changes everybody in the church
[1:32:16] [Music]
[1:32:19] Hallelujah somebody's broke through
[1:32:22] and they've come under the influence of
[1:32:24] the message therefore they're
[1:32:26] influencing by what they've been
[1:32:27] influenced by now they say what are you
[1:32:29] influencing the People by the message
[1:32:34] am I going too long the message what are
[1:32:37] you saying I'm saying what a prophet
[1:32:38] said oh God he said it's plain it was
[1:32:42] veiled he said but somebody broke
[1:32:44] through the veil he said they went in
[1:32:46] there and got the pillar of power got
[1:32:47] the blessing he said and today Veil to
[1:32:50] the people it's revealed and made plain
[1:32:52] to people God the Mighty God veiled in
[1:32:54] human flesh the word now we find out it
[1:32:57] was here to the unbeliever but it was
[1:32:59] revealed to the believer I'm coming down
[1:33:02] to the close here God reveals himself in
[1:33:04] three ways right
[1:33:05] all right first time in the pillar of
[1:33:07] fire that was called fatherhood same God
[1:33:10] manifested in Jesus Christ which he
[1:33:12] built a body made his body thirdly
[1:33:13] through the death of his body Sanctified
[1:33:16] a church that he can dwell in it was
[1:33:18] gone above us God With Us God in us the
[1:33:22] same God God reveals himself in three
[1:33:25] sons names son of man the prophet Son of
[1:33:29] God through the church ages and Son of
[1:33:31] David in the Millennium but according to
[1:33:34] Luke 17 30 between the Son of God and
[1:33:36] the son of David brother Solomon the son
[1:33:39] of man was to return to the church in
[1:33:42] the last days to fulfill scripture he
[1:33:45] said to the church age now he's been Son
[1:33:47] of God in the Millennium he'll be son of
[1:33:49] David but between this time we find out
[1:33:52] by the scripture he is to reveal himself
[1:33:55] again as the son of man a prophet and it
[1:33:58] can only be brought to a prophet thus
[1:34:01] shall it be in the day when the son of
[1:34:04] man is revealed guilt what is revealed
[1:34:07] made known a secret a revelation or make
[1:34:10] known a secret I love this quote it's
[1:34:12] one of them it's one of them power pack
[1:34:14] quotes he said the son of man is
[1:34:16] prophesied to be revealed and what kind
[1:34:19] of a revelation will it be it'll be the
[1:34:22] revelation of his living
[1:34:26] the voice of the son of man I'm closing
[1:34:29] out will be the revelation of his living
[1:34:32] after being crucified 1900 years is
[1:34:36] raised from the dead and is alive with
[1:34:38] us he will be revealed then what are we
[1:34:42] living in tonight church we are living
[1:34:43] in the revealing of the son of man we
[1:34:46] are living in the time where the Prophet
[1:34:48] said aren't you happy to be living when
[1:34:50] the son of man is revealing himself to
[1:34:53] his church what is he revealing himself
[1:34:55] in Mercy saving your soul amen giving
[1:34:58] you of his life then the revelation of
[1:35:00] his living is his life living through
[1:35:03] You by The Obedience to the word he's
[1:35:05] revealing in the age you're living in
[1:35:07] he's giving you Joy in the Sin of
[1:35:10] sadness he's given you faith in the
[1:35:12] state of fear he's giving you healing in
[1:35:14] the state of sickness he's revealing
[1:35:16] himself the very same way he did back
[1:35:18] there what is it it's a son of man
[1:35:21] revealing the son of man it was the
[1:35:25] voice it was The Voice he said I have no
[1:35:27] more to do with it than nothing no more
[1:35:29] than just a voice I was only a voice
[1:35:32] that he used to say it it wasn't what I
[1:35:34] knew it's what I surrendered myself to
[1:35:37] that he spoke through it isn't me it
[1:35:40] wasn't the seventh angel it was the
[1:35:42] manifestation of the son of man it
[1:35:45] wasn't the angel his message it was the
[1:35:48] mystery that God unfolded it's not a man
[1:35:51] it's God the angel was not the son of
[1:35:54] man he was the messenger from the son of
[1:35:56] man the son of man is Christ somebody
[1:35:59] shout Christ and he is the one you're
[1:36:02] feeding on and if you're not feeding on
[1:36:04] a man his words will fail but you're
[1:36:07] feeding on the unfailing body word of
[1:36:10] the son of man what is this seventh
[1:36:12] angel brother Solomon I'll say what he
[1:36:14] said I'm a mute until he speaks through
[1:36:17] me he said I'm only his mouthpiece he
[1:36:20] said I've got to get the law of William
[1:36:21] Branham out of the way my intellectuals
[1:36:23] my spirit my knowing whatever and I get
[1:36:26] all that out of the way he can use my
[1:36:29] eyes and he can use my lips to glorify
[1:36:32] himself before his people
[1:36:36] what he's saying I'm saying the son of
[1:36:39] man is back in the church I'm gonna I'm
[1:36:43] gonna I'm gonna tie it right here and if
[1:36:46] you fail to believe
[1:36:48] and you fail to obey the voice you will
[1:36:51] never reap a benefit direct quote I want
[1:36:55] all you dear people sitting here in the
[1:36:57] audience there I want you to believe
[1:36:58] with all your heart now remember that's
[1:37:00] the only way I could help you but now

[1:37:03] to to be a Christian you have to believe
[1:37:04] God and the Father the Son the Holy
[1:37:06] Ghost in order to be a Christian but
[1:37:08] believe in that still won't help you in
[1:37:09] this gift you've got to believe that

[1:37:14] as them but believe that they have sent
[1:37:16] me for this purpose are you ready for
[1:37:18] this now you could be a renowned
[1:37:20] Christian and fail to believe what I've
[1:37:23] told you to be the truth and you never
[1:37:25] be able to reap a benefit from it
[1:37:29] when the angels of the Lord moves down

[1:37:39] saying that then you forgive me but I
[1:37:41] feel that might have been resented but
[1:37:43] I'm God's voice to you I say that again
[1:37:45] that time was under inspiration see I
[1:37:48] felt bad about it the first time but it
[1:37:51] repeated it
[1:37:55] it repeated it see who was the it it was
[1:37:59] the it he the son of man it was Christ
[1:38:02] speaking through a son of man what are
[1:38:04] you saying in Luke the fifth chapter the
[1:38:06] Bible says that the son of man hath
[1:38:07] power to forgive and to heal there was a
[1:38:10] man laying with a policy right in a bed
[1:38:12] and Jesus saw his sins faith and said
[1:38:15] man thy sins are forgiven me I love Luke
[1:38:18] 5 24 but that you may know that the son
[1:38:21] of man hath power upon Earth to forgive
[1:38:22] sins he's saith unto the sick of the
[1:38:25] palsy I say unto thee arise take up thy
[1:38:29] couch and go into thy house what are you
[1:38:31] saying I'm saying the voice of the son
[1:38:33] of man separated the man from his
[1:38:35] condition and caused him to walk into
[1:38:38] his future by the authority of the word

[1:39:13] voice said get up out of that chair and
[1:39:15] walk where did the strength come from
[1:39:17] the same voice

[1:39:42] cause William Brandon walked in there
[1:39:44] she didn't just scream because he walked
[1:39:46] in there but where did the miracle take
[1:39:47] place when she received and obeyed what

[1:43:32] if he says bring me a picture of water
[1:43:34] just take it to him
[1:43:37] if you're Peter out I was listening at
[1:43:39] Thy word preached in West Palm Beach
[1:43:40] only over here or not Birmingham said if
[1:43:42] you're Peter out there fish on the water
[1:43:44] he said while you're fishing he said
[1:43:46] you're a fisherman and you know there's
[1:43:48] no fish in there and he said Here Comes
[1:43:50] Jesus walking by and says Peter let down
[1:43:53] my net he said but Lord there's he said
[1:43:55] but then he remembered Reverend stopped
[1:43:58] he said then he remembered he said so he
[1:44:00] let down the net I got thinking about
[1:44:02] that
[1:44:03] the one who created the fish
[1:44:07] he was letting his net Down Under The
[1:44:09] Power of word creative of cred listen if
[1:44:13] Jesus listen he could have been out in
[1:44:14] the desert somewhere and Jesus said let
[1:44:17] down your net in the dust and there
[1:44:18] would have been water and there had been
[1:44:20] fish there because it's the voice of
[1:44:22] creation come on Spirit true Tabernacle

[1:44:34] nothing and under the voice of the son
[1:44:36] of man you can say Let There be this let
[1:44:39] there be that you can stand before a
[1:44:41] negative report and say let that go out
[1:44:43] of existence and let the positive charge
[1:44:45] of the almighty word of God come into
[1:44:48] effect what are you saying I'm saying
[1:44:51] take the supernatural power away from
[1:44:52] this church and it'll crumble and fall
[1:44:54] into a crippled condition
[1:44:56] but if that power is here
[1:44:59] it's the same power
[1:45:00] whatever he says do
[1:45:03] just do it
[1:45:06] brother Solomon just just do it
[1:45:09] just bring him the picture of water
