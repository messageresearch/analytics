continue to direct him as he goes amen praise the lord let's read in our bible here isaiah uh chapter i'm sorry actually you know what let's go to luke chapter two luke two and i read isaiah 9 on last week but i want to read luke chapter 2 today praise god and it says here in verse 1 uh it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from caesar augustus that all the world should be taxed and this taxing was first made when cerenius was governor of syria and all went to be taxed everyone into his own city and joseph also went up from galilee out of the city of nazareth and to dodea into the city of david uh yeah unto the city of david which is called bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of david to be taxed with mary as a spouse wife being great with child and so was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the end and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel the lord came upon them and the glory of the lord shone round about them and they were sore afraid the angel said unto them fear not for behold i bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you this day in the city of david is i mean a savior which is christ for unto you is born this day in the city of david a savior which is christ the lord and this shall be a sign a sign unto you ye shall find the bait wrapped in swallowing clothes lying in a manger and suddenly there was with the angel multitude of the heavenly host praising god and saying glory to god in the highest and on earth peace good will toward men and it came to pass as the angels were going away from them into heaven the shepherd said one to another let us now go even unto bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass which the lord hath made known unto us and they came with haste and found mary and josephine the babe lying in a manger and when they had seen it they made known abroad the same which was told them concerning this child and all they that heard it wandered at those things which were told them by the shepherds but mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart and the shepherds returned glorified and praising glorifying and praising god for all the things they they had heard and seen as it was told unto them and let's just go back to isaiah uh really quick isaiah 9. good to see sister rebecca and a precious daughter god bless you all amen isaiah 9 verse 6 and 7 praise the lord this is up for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end peace and i love that of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of david and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even forever the zeal of the lord of hosts will perform this praise god shall we just bow in a brief word of prayer amen dear god we are privileged to be able to come into the house of god lord and uh certainly uh this being the last sunday of the year we take time to reflect on how good you have been to us uh throughout this year every door that you open every way that you made just the mere fact that we stand here this morning god you've given us life health and strength and god we're grateful for that there's many that would love to trade places with us today but god you saw fit to have us to come and help us not to take these things for granted but to know god that you truly have been good and you deserve all of our praise thank you for all that has happened in the service for the the specials that went forth uh uh thank you for what you're doing our sister linda and god and how she's learning that instrument and i just pray that you just continue to bless her abundantly father just appreciate seeing the young people yielding their talents to you father not just allowing you to get all the glory and all the honor out of what you've given them so i pray father to just bless her abundantly and lord all the saints that have gathered here today families that have come into town thank you for each and everyone those that have joined us online bless them as well and use your word god to draw our hearts closer to you father so in jesus name we pray amen amen you can be seated amen sister linda we really appreciate that song that was a a a blessing that was a real blessing i thank god for that amen well uh i i want to start a man a subject today i don't think i will have the opportunity to finish this but we'll at least get it started i want to talk to you about peace is a person amen amen peace is a person and you know i just i i've been thinking on this and and and i don't know where the thought even dropped down and came to me but um i was you know doing something and just kind of struck me peace as a person and uh and and i thought about it and then you know we read there in the scripture uh in isaiah 9 what says for unto us a child is born unto us the son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace and just there in that scripture long it lets us know that this is a person you know it's not just a feeling it's not just an emotion amen but it's a person and and if you don't know this person if you don't know this person there is no there's no way possible that you can have peace right you you have to know this person you you have to know who the prince of peace is if if you're going to experience true peace right you know so so so we we want to just kind of take our time a man with this if we can this morning and and uh uh uh you know and you know let me just start with this quote out of why are people so tossed about uh and just just the title alone tells you that people don't have peace if they're tossed about they're moving from here and moving there and just all over the place they don't have peace glory to god amen but but by here you know the prophet says something in the message why are people so tossed about saying i was saying somewhere maybe here a few nights ago i wanted to preach so bad i preached to my wife in bed till 12 o'clock can you imagine that i just i just it was just something bubbling up in the prophet that he wanted to share and he didn't have a pulpit to go to so he made his bedroom a pulpit and he started preaching to his wife until 12 o'clock says just telling her of how gl now i'm going to tell you that's a real preacher a preacher and preached to one person is a real preacher because god put something that's hard he had to get it released amen hallelujah let me get that started uh he said he said he says uh i wanted to preach so bad i preached to my wife in bed till 12 o'clock just telling her of how glorious jesus was a text come in my heart it kept burning me so great till i just couldn't rest with it and i just said honey i want to preach to you a little while and she route rose up pretty much rounds up by grace she listened my god what a wife what a wife god bless you sister branham amen and said by gracie listen i said the christian faith is based solidly upon rest now now if i can just add a little bit to that amen uh if the christian faith is based solely upon rest amen uh in order to be a christian glory to god amen and if you know jesus he's the one that gives you rest and by giving you rest he also grants you peace hallelujah no matter what you're going through this morning you can still have peace [Music] oh glory to god amen said the christian um uh uh the christian faith is based solidly upon rest not worry not complaining none of that amen it's based upon rest oh hallelujah somebody you know i i mean the devil i he see see i'm just saying let me just stop just hold on one second let me just kind of throw this in here you know this morning you know i come here and you know and and um and just in prayer and while i'm in prayer get a couple text messages and uh and and you know about something with with work and and as i'm sitting there thinking about like now i can't be sitting here worried about who gonna do this and who gonna do that it's time for church right so so i told my wife i said look we're gonna do this we're gonna do that then i'm gonna just cut this off and i'm gonna just put this in the hands of god and let him handle it because the christian faith amen is based upon rest look you can't you can't do nothing about it yourself anyway why not give it to jesus and and live in peace hallelujah glory to god look at this he says he says the christian faith is based solidly upon rest that's right a christian a christian is not tossed about i'm talking about a real christian amen a christian glory to god can always be at peace a christian can always rest on the promises of god a christian know that all things are working together for good that's the way a christian response that's why i can look like the next year right in the eye says come beyond right i got peace [Music] [Applause] glory to god amen glory if he brought me through this he'll take me through next year if he provided this year he'll provide next year glory to god a christian a christian is not tossed about a christian i'm talking about a christian now creature a christian doesn't run from place to place a christian am i talking to some christians this morning a christian don't fuss oh hallelujah a christian doesn't fuss and fume and worry about things christians don't worry christians pray and they leave it at the feet of god they rest they rest they rest look at this it says a a christian rests and when a christian rests you know what it's all over it's all over right as soon as you can find rest so you can find peace and it's all over he says it says it's all finished for the belief at calvary that's right all sickness may come and disappointments but the christians at rest knowing this that god is able to keep that which he has performed now i like that i like that notice the statement that he just made god is able to keep that which he has performed not what he promised but what he's already performed and what you're waiting on is for the performance that's taking place in the spiritual to manifest itself in the natural but a christian's at rest knowing that god's going to do what he said he's going to do all right he says that god's able to keep that with jesus before him knowing that no matter what the thing is or how it looks there's neither sickness sorrow death there's neither starvation or anything that can separate us from the love of god that is in jesus christ we are at rest just let the old ship toss any way she wants wants to the anchor hoes man this is a christian that's why you know when they when they come up with a new variant christians are not shaken we will do what we need to do praise god amen and protect ourselves and protect everybody else around us but we at rest we have peace we at peace what we gonna do about this we don't worry we don't we don't operate like that we pray amen we just let god be god in the midst of the situation hallelujah glory glory glory so you know as i was just thinking about that and you know how brother branham just had in his heart just to preach that and he woke his wife up and said look i just got to preach to you and preach for hours about rest about rest uh you know and i wonder what things he was going through in his own life to kind of cause him to come to that spot where he realized that the christian faith was solidly based upon rest amen i know sometimes you know we can look back through this year there's been some some major trials but church we've been resting amen god has given us peace in the midst of these thoughts glory to god and we still press it on now here uh as we talk about this piece is a person peace is a person we were looking a man at a couple scriptures amen here today and and uh one of them found in uh uh luke and as i was just kind of you know reading that and uh just you know just kind of thinking about it hear the lord jesus is announced in um at his birth verse 14 there in luke chapter two the the announcement was well i'm sorry verse 13 and 14. let's look at it and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly hosts praising god and saying that now you have to understand some that when a king is born there's always singing conducted when when a new king is born so here we have the king of kings and the lord of lords that is coming to earth and and we didn't have any earthly people to sing so god sent angels down amen to sing at the birth of the king of kings and the lord of lords says and suddenly there was with the angel multitude of the heavenly hosts praising god and saying glory to god in the highest and on earth peace good will toward men now now this this announcement that peace has come good will towards men at the birth of this child peace has come to the earth you know ever since the fall in the garden of eden there was no peace hallelujah there was no peace ever since we had to start facing death amen uh uh because they they took of that forbidden fruit you know there was no peace for man glory to god but when jesus was born now peace is being announced for the earth glory to god peace is a person hallelujah now i thought about this you know uh here this announcement of peace coming through the angels and everything and telling the shepherds where to go find the the christ child and and i thought about it at the time of his birth it really was a time of turmoil hallelujah amen herod had ordered that all the male children under two years old they were to be killed in efforts to eliminate amen the threat of this new king so this was actually a time of it was not a time of peace even though peace was announced hallelujah amen it was still a time of turmoil can i go a little further and i want to say this now amen it was not peace to those families that was losing their children because of harry's uh a decree amen it was also uh uh uh you know i mean anybody that was i mean as joseph and and mary had to go back even in the middle of her her pregnancy they're going back to the city to be taxed that was not peaceful for them hallelujah amen that was turmoil for them but yet peace was being carried by mary hallelujah amen the person of peace was being carried by mary and no matter what they did they could not they could not stop peace from coming forth to the earth oh hallelujah somebody amen here the other thing i want to just uh make mention so so if it was a a a tumultuous time that christ was being born i want us to think about this a little bit more because peace is more i believe something much greater than the way that we define it peace is a person glory to god look at this peace can only be realized when we accept christ into our hearts his salvation brings the inner change to the hearts of men and that's what gives them peace now i want to just say a couple things here stay with me here people are in constant search for all peace and and one of the one of the things you hear now one of the statements you hear is i'm looking for my inner peace my my inner peace and you know and and i want to just tell the church y'all be careful searching some of this stuff and listening to some of the stuff where people talk about this inner peace you know some of it a man sound okay but then other times it starts getting really questionable is that really a christian principle now i start i start researching some of it and and i just didn't even want to go through all the different things but they got people out there to tell you things you can do to get inner peace hallelujah one of the things they tell you to do is spend time with nature see we can start kind of getting in between now ain't none roman enjoying a mountain ain't nothing jordan roman enjoying a a a a river or the beach or i mean not now hallelujah here in florida we try to go to the beach to enjoy enjoy god's creation and then we don't have no peace hello somebody the way the way the people dressed on the beach we ain't got no peace i i can't enjoy god's creation looking at all this other stuff on the beach hallelujah right so so so here they tell you they say spend time with nature you can find your inner peace now they also tell you say uh in order to be uh have inner peace be 10 minutes early now i i can deduce what they're saying i can understand that you know if you're not scrambling right you got a little time just to think about what you're doing be 10 minutes early no now you know hallelujah for me that goes a little further because for church praise god the prophet told us be 30 minutes early and that'll really allow you to get your mind settled hello somebody glory to god but they give me these little things be 10 minutes early another one say just slow down stop being in such a hurry all the time just slow down some of these things sound all right glory to god i'm not here to dispute any of that but but one of the other things they say here is be assertive in order to find your peace they tell you to be assertive and don't let anybody stand in your way for you to get your inner peace you got to be assertive and don't let nobody stand in your way now to me that sounds very selfish because you're only thinking about yourself many us many of us make decisions amen and not thinking about the impact on others but as a christian you know you want to know the way to make decisions god first other second yourself last but when we follow stuff like this to find our inner peace we forget about the christian principles god first of the second yourself last hallelujah that's the christian way to do things another thing they say uh you know in order to find your inner peace they say escape for a while where you gonna go where you gonna escape to and then let me just ask the question after you finish your escape and you get out your escape room and you come back out here to reality where's your peace because you're still dealing with the same thing you do i mean some people use drugs alcohol to try to a man to try to drink away some of the problems or smoke away some of the problems of what it's not some of the you can't do none of that to find peace peace is a person peace is a person see when you escape for a while when you return the situation is still staring you right in the face and your your stress level go right back up again and now you're looking for another trip to get away you just got back yesterday you just got back yesterday see that's because you're looking for peace in the wrong places peace is a person i want to add a scripture here all the people that's give me isaiah 48 and 22. if you don't know jesus you don't know peace here the bible says this there is no peace there is no peace saith the lord unto who unto the wicked so if you don't know jesus you don't know peace and i don't care how much of this stuff you follow if you don't know jesus you'll never have peace right i mean this wicked means people that are morally bad and also another definition says they are addicted to evil where the wicked you are addicted to evil i'd rather be addicted to god i'd rather be addicted to jesus right not addicted to evil but if you're addicted to evil you'll never have peace because there is no peace saith the lord further unto the wicked the other thing that i found here about this word wicked in the hebrew lexicon it says you're guilty of sin wicked means you're guilty of sin and if you're guilty of sin and you've never reconciled that with god you will never you'll never experience true peace in our webster's dictionary they say peace is defined amen as freedom from disturbance quiet tranquility this is why people like getting next to the water get into the mountains and they're trying to find that quiet and tranquility but i'ma tell you you can only find that in christ amen glory to god hallelujah they call it a mental calm a serenity uh and i was just thinking on myself uh uh oftentimes in families we look for this peace we want this quietness we want this tranquility we want this freedom from disturbance we want the mental calm we want the serenity we want we want all that inside of our families we want it on our jobs we want it everywhere we go we just want peace peace peace but i want to tell you that in families a man peace sometimes can be disrupted hallelujah peace can be disrupted and uh and i was just you know just thinking about this one family where peace was disrupted and uh it was david's household glory to god uh one time there come a situation that rose up in his house and um he had a a a a son ma that had a lust spirit on him and uh and you know uh our mind had this spirit on him and and he got one of his friends that gave him some bad counsel hallelujah this friend you know he said man what's the matter what you say well you know i really really i really love tamar tamar was his sister half sister you know i really loved him i said well you know you can um uh you can just act like you're sick and uh and when you act like you're sick ask your daddy just to send to ma with some baked goods and have her alone bring it to you and then you know you can do what you want to do when she's here and they say you know what that's pretty good counsel and he called he got he started acting like he was sick coughing and sneezing and sniffling and all kind of stuff daddy i'm sick but the thing i think that's going to make me get better is if you send tamar in here and i said daddy say okay if that'll make you better son your daughter my daughter can come and bring you bring you what you want to eat and and when he locked the doors put everybody out then then he took advantage of his sister but before he took advantage she said now look look look she tried to give him some counsel she says that look before you do this all you got to do is ask for daddy ask daddy for my hand and marriage you ain't got to shame me like this he didn't think that was good counsel he took advantage of her and then after he took advantage of a raptor i'm just giving you what the bible said after he raped her and then then he didn't put her out put it out of his uh out of his uh out of his room and didn't want nothing to do with it anymore here this household did not have peace and as tamar is leaving the scene her biological brother sees her his name is absalom you know what i found out church absalom means my father is peace his name his very name means my father is peace and he absalom sees uh what has happened to his sister and and you can tell even though he had a name that my father is peace absalom was not a man of peace see i don't care if your name might be representative of something you still got to meet the person of peace if you want to really have peace oh hallelujah somebody absalom said you know what this man did this i'ma just i'm gonna come up with a plan somehow some way i'ma kill this guy i'm not a disruption going through the family here here here i'm not i mean i'm not going along after i'm going to took about two years for his plan to actually come to pass hallelujah he's been working on this thing for two years glory to god and finally when it gets to the spot he's like now we gonna have sheep here in time and i'm gonna invite all the king's sons and he said daddy just let all the boys come we want to just just just have a good time he said not all the boys say yeah dad i want all the boys to come it's all right i'ma let you have them all and you know y'all go out there and before you know it while they're out there getting drunk absolutely told this boy saying now look when when when i'm not get get a little tipsy i want y'all to rise up and slay him no peace in this household no peace in this household now now what we what we find is that they slayed omnom they killed him absalom end up in um he just ended up away from the family after he committed this this great tragedy in the family and it took years for them to bring him back into fellowship with the family sometimes we do things amen that caused us to be separated for years and we didn't have to do that we could have just walked in peace live according to your name here we find this same islam that said his father is named my father's peace the same guy rises up when he comes back because he doesn't come back with the same spirit he still he's still got problems and now he finds himself trying to a man take the kingdom from his own daddy but his name meant my father is peace but his actions show something totally different it shows us that a man peace is much deeper than just our name peace and peace is much deeper than just the family that we associate it to peace is much deeper than that peace is a person hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah let me just kind of work with this a little bit i want to say that uh peace i want to go to another quote here peace is something much deeper than tranquility and and the state of mind and all these other things that they're trying to give us peace really is a person and i'ma tell you when you get to know the lord jesus in a very real way he can give you the peace that passeth all understanding but it's only by knowing him let me let me just show you something because this piece that we're talking about when you get to know jesus is not just a peace that you have here on earth but it's a peace that you can have even when you leave in the earth even when you're dying you can have this peace see peace on earth good will toward all men there's a if you meet this person the prince of peace you can really have something special i want to show you something here in this message who is this melchizedek look at this it says a theophany is something that you cannot see it could be right here now yet you cannot see it it's just like well like television this that's in another dimension television people are moving right through this room now singing there is colors also but the eye is only subject to the five senses your whole being is only subject to the five senses rather and you are only subject to what the site has been limited to see but there is another dimension that can be seen by a transformation by television now television does not manufacture a picture television only channels it into a circuit and then the television screen picks it up but the picture is there to begin with television was here when adam was here television was here when elijah sat on mount carmel television was here when jesus of nazareth walked the shores of galilee but you're just now discovering it they wouldn't have believed it back there you'd have been crazy to have said something like it but now it's become a reality and so is it that christ is here the angels of god are here and someday in the great millennium to come it'll be just more real than television or anything else because they are here he reveals himself in his great form of what he claimed and he and morphed himself into servants and proves himself he says now he now here he is in the form of spirit and when he comes in the form of in morphy now he appeared to abraham and morphy when abraham was returning from the slaughter of the kings here come melchizedek talk to him now i'm i'm i just gotta i'm uh i'm gonna inject there let me let me see if i can slip i'm trying to slip past that i really am yeah oh my i got to see it i got to see it um brother random just introduced something there in that quote and i'm going in this quote in a little bit but when abraham was uh out in the plains of mamrie and he got the word that lot had been captured see here's another family that had gone through a disruption and uh and they were just in chaos and here lot and his family was was was taken uh captive and abraham got word that you know what lot has been taken and uh five kings came together these number of kings came together and nate they took they took out sodom and took out gamora and they captured a lot has gone with them abraham said i can't let my my loved ones stay out there like that oh hallelujah i can't let lot go i mean be in captivity like that i mean lot made a bad decision that put him in the wrong place amen and now he's captured and now he said now he's really in trouble i can't let him stay like that so abraham got his servants all they got was some some pitchforks and some shovels and amen and whatever they could find around uh the gardening house and they took off to go to battle no swords no no no no guns none of that they just took off of what they had to go face these kingdoms and abraham went out there and he conquered and he was able to get locked and bring lot back and he got all these spots and he brought it back god was with abraham to help him overcome in that battle but as abraham was on his way back abraham met somebody met the man by the that's king by the main name of melchizedek and the bible says it means king of salem which also means king of peace peace is a person oh hallelujah abraham met the person of peace in the book of genesis and we can still meet the person of peace today peace is a person not only is he a king of peace he's also the prince of peace peace is a person [Applause] he's a real being he's a real being i told you this person when you when you come to know him it's not just peace in this life in which we're living i mean we we can have peace no matter what storm we're facing i mentioned on last week how to you know the the disciples were inside the boat and when while they were in the boat they thought for sure that they were going to drown here jesus said let's go to the other side just gave him a command let's go to the other side and as they're getting just rolling jesus was so tired he went back and laid down in the back of the boat i mean fell asleep i'm talking about slobbing snoring i mean a deep sleep and you know and i can just imagine i'm kind of like that look oh man when it's time for me to go down i'm going down you can be talking to me and i'm gone just like that you wonder what happened look sleep has hit me and please don't wake me up i'm i'm here i've i've reached this this ultimate place don't wake me up praise the lord let nature take his course i'll wake up on my own right but but by here jesus is in the back of the boat just sleeping and the disciples are rowing and and they notice that the storm just comes out of nowhere it wasn't predicted by the weatherman that this storm was coming and here the storm just shows up out in out of nowhere so so the disciples maybe are sitting there scrounging like should we wake jesus they said no he's sleeping man let him sleep you know he tired he'd been doing this he'd been doing that just let him sleep maybe peter said look i can't let him sleep we about to die and maybe peter's going to shake jesus jesus you know how peter is he got he got a real funny spirit jesus do you even care that we about to perish you healing this one you healing that one but look at us out here about to die jesus just look at peter shake out of his sleep walk to the front of the boat push his foot up on the front of the boat and just says peace be still see the person of peace is speaking peace peace be still and when he spoke it the wind stopped the waves stopped and he went back and laid down and the disciples had a conversation they looked at each other and oh and finally somebody just let it out their mouth what matter of man is this that the wings and the seeds obey i can tell you who he is boys he is peace he is peace and i want to tell you i don't care how much your boat in life is rocking this morning jesus the person of peace is here to speak peace to every wind and every wave praise god you have peace inside your boat you just gotta activate peace peace is laying inside of you [Applause] he's a person if you feel with the holy ghost he's a person and he gives you you don't have to go seek an inner peace it's already there if you would just learn to rest let me keep reading this who is this melchizedek says the other day in the tucson paper i was reading an article there were there was a woman driving down the road i believe about 40 50 miles an hour and she hit an old man with an overcoat on she screamed and stopped her car it threw him up in the air right out in the plain desert she run back to find him and he wasn't there so what did she do some people behind her saw it happen saw the old man fly up in the air and it's overcoat turning so they run back to find out they couldn't find the man anywhere they called the police force the police come out to examine the place there was nobody there well each one of them testified the car chugged hit the man he went up in the air and and everybody saw witnesses and two or three carlos of them they seen it happen come to find out five years ago there was an old man with an overcoat on hit and killed on the same spot look at this when you leave here you're not dead you've got to come back even if you're a sinner and be judged according to the deeds done in the body if this earth the tabernacle is dissolved we have we have one waiting and morphy that's the word so what i thought about is that when this man died he did not have peace he didn't have peace right and remember what the scripture says in in isaiah uh 48 you know there is no peace says the lord unto the wicked hallelujah so when this man died he didn't have peace but when you meet the person of peace and you have him in your heart even death even in death you can have freedom from disturbance oh i like that i want to say that again when you meet the person of peace and you have him in your heart even in death you can have freedom from disturbance you can have quietness you can have tranquility you can have peace because peace is a person let's look at this amen glory to god glory to god here in this message to whom shall we go to whom shall we go the prophet says this then another thing fifthly i have to say this he's the only successful and secured happiness and peace he talked about the lord jesus he's the only successful and secured happiness and peace that's the reason we come to him oh i know you can laugh like an idiot or you can get out here and laugh till you go into hysterics at some joke that some movie star popped off of something and you know now even in church they have churches that are set up to that when you come they just have everybody laugh they just keep laughing and you just see people just just laughing and then you know and you know how sometimes um the thing might not even be funny it might not be funny what somebody's saying but sometimes you can you can see somebody else laughing and it'll make you laugh right but here they go to church and that's the whole service just just standing around laughing pastors start laughing then this will start laughing and they say laughing laugh laughter is like a medicine you know but after you after you stop laughing you still got problems right how long you can't laugh them problems away but you'll still have problems after you after you're not stopped laughing but but by here you know uh brother branham is saying this he says um you can laugh like an idiot or you can get out there get out here and laugh till you go into hysterics at some joke that some movie star popped off or something or somebody you might get a little too much to drink and laugh like you was with some loon but that don't bring peace says there is there is no other peace and no other happiness like coming to jesus christ it says i've seen people put on i've seen young women try to brush their selves around with their new frocks on and act like they were happy they're not amen he says that they're only building a painted fire you can't warm by a painted fire you've seen young men that try to think his muscles were so big that you could drive a nail down and never touch him and a knife would bend his blade on them just give him a few years and he's turned back old enrico there's no eternal happiness outside of christ oh i love this to whom shall we go he says looky here i'll put any of you here tonight in perfect health your family in perfect health all around you what about mama that's not here how do you know that's your dad amen how do you know your dad's not dying now how do you know that the uh the one of the children didn't get killed a few minutes ago away from here how do you know that something else hasn't happened how do you know you're going out of this building tonight you may drop in a heart attack you don't know so there's no eternal happiness outside of christ that's the reason we must come to him you can have whiskey you can have pleasure you can have the things of the world but they're not successful happiness nothing can can give peace like him he gives a peace so you say i got peace some people feel like if i get into this relationship i'm gonna have peace if i if i can hang with this friend then i'm gonna have peace if i can do this in my career then i'm gonna have peace none of those things bring peace hallelujah the only way you can have peace is to have jesus glory to god glory to god i mean you know even right now you can get the best job in the world but at some point in time then bill's still going to get power this high with the best job and you're gonna you're gonna find yourself like oh lord how are we gonna get through this and see when you get to that point your piece just went right out the window i'm talking about your personal piece but when you got him as your peace glory to god nothing changes you're not stressed you're not worried god got this all worked out let me go on a little bit from this quote it says if you ever got real peace you got jesus if you ever got real real peace you got jesus if you haven't got jesus you don't even know what peace what what what uh know what peace means can i say that again if you don't if you haven't got jesus you don't even know what peace means so all that studying on the internet and trying to find these different steps for inner peace that ain't gonna get you there you must know jesus and you say well i got him i know jesus but i still ain't got no peace but you need to start praying a little bit more hallelujah because i i i i've had it happen to me many times in my life you get into a little fix somewhere and you just begin to call on the lord jesus and all of a sudden there's a peace that overtakes you that just kind of calms your spirit that you know i'ma make it through this thing i can't tell you hi i don't know that but i know that i'm gonna make it through oh hallelujah glad i got jesus said glad i got jesus oh glad i got jesus hey glad i got jesus in my heart glad i got peace yeah glad i got peace oh glad i got peace yeah glad i got peace down in my heart i got jesus i got jesus i got peace cause i got jesus anybody got him i said anybody got him i got jesus oh i got jesus i said glad i got jesus oh glad i got jesus yay glad i got jesus oh glad i got jesus in my heart i i'm talking about when you're going through one of them songs like that it's a spirit and you get to sing in it and and my god you can injure yourself by praising god hallelujah somebody i actually uh everybody was asking me i kind of sprung this ankle a man this this week and i was just telling i didn't know what i did i'm gonna tell you what i think i did i'm gonna be honest with you there was this big need that i had um and and i was looking at it and i just saw uh how the lord was getting ready to make a way for that need to be met and as i looked at him making a way for the need to be met i just and next second i said but you know what when it when they get healed i'm going to do it all over here i i'd rather get hurt praising god and i'll let y'all talk about me but what what but what was i doing i was worshiping hallelujah i was amen i was finding peace in the midst of my storm if you ever got real peace you got jesus if you haven't got jesus you don't even know what peace means until you come to him i'm here to tell you this morning peace is a person i've seen people kings potentates great men athletes movie stars and all that and what brother brandon said i mean you look at you look at these these guys that we talk about more than we talk about jesus but many of them uh they don't have peace their families not in peace i mean y'all think dwyane wade got peace his son don't have peace and i said his son he was born a a boy i don't care how much dwayne try to say he's a girl and dress him up like her and then even dwayne himself got the nerd to put on skirts and stuff i don't care what team he owned no peace hallelujah and and his wife thought she had peace when she had him thought she had it made when she got into you know i got me i'm married to this this this this basketball stuff he went on a hat baby by another woman now she ain't got no peace and she thought she was all that look your piece can't be found in a person outside of the lord jesus your peace ain't found in a movie star your peace ain't found in the basketball person or football per your peace ain't found in a soccer player your peace got to be found in christ it was only at his birth that they announced peace goodwill toward me peace is found in jesus the lord jesus christ oh my my my i just i love this i seen people kings potentates great men athletes movie stars all that they're not peaceful look at them wash their eyes for a few minutes their neurotics see no man no woman no child no one can have peace outside of jesus christ and i like this my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth it i unto you it says see not as the world gives you peace see not just going to the beach not just you know uh uh uh getting out and talking to trees or hugging trees and that ain't peace you've got to meet the person of christ right here you know he goes on he says not as the world gives you peace but he has eternal peace a resting peace if you live if you die no matter if the rain comes or the sun shines you got peace anyhow the light brother should carry his old number he sings great big old fellow sings i got peace like the river i got peace like oh that's right when when you got peace you got christ christ is your peace so that's why we must come to christ to find peace let me just jump and just give a couple of the things here another definition that they gave for this word peace at a website says it's a state or period where there is no war or war has ended and when i when i thought about that a state of period where where there's no war or wars ended i thought about peace treaties that different nations might sign with one another and you know and there was a a peace treaty one time in scripture that was uh that was that was presented and it was goliath that was presenting this peace treaty his his words amen here in first samuel 17 verse 8 through 9. this is his peace treaty first samuel 17 verse 8 and 9 says and he stood and cried unto the armies of israel and said unto them why are you come out to set your battle in a ray am not am not i a philistine he servants to saul choose you a man for you and let him come down to me if he be able to fight with me and to kill me then will we be your servants but if i prevail against him and kill him then shall then shall ye be our servants and serve us so this is a goliath peace treaty amen that he gives them say if i win in the battle just give me one man we got to have all this bloodshed just give me one man and if if i win y'all serve us and if if y'all if he wins then we'll serve y'all this is the peace treaty and i thought about this you know uh how many nations have tried to use peace treaties but none of them ever work most of them never work at some point in time the peace treaty is broken it's because they need more than just a treaty they need the person of the lord jesus dwelling on the inside if they really want to have peace here goliath makes this this great boasting and he asked for them to do this and you know and and they go all these days and one day david is sending to the camp to bring some food to his brothers and he hears goliath makes his posts like now what the king gonna do for the man that go out and fight this guy say he'll give him his daughter he'll do this well i didn't really think about all that i'm just tired of seeing this man scare all the all the armies of the living god so i'll go out and fight him and david went out and fought goliath we all know the story he went out and fought him took those five smooth stones and picked him up and and he threw one stone at goliath and the first stone hit him right in the center of his head killed him knocked him out david took his sword cut off his head and you thought they would have had peace but they didn't because you know what happened in david's life later on the same guy he just killed the same peace treaty just signed david joined that army and also was getting ready to fight against israel you talk about no peace for the wicked see peace is a person and and and they went through all of this you know and and they still did not have peace i'm reminded of of a scripture here in job 3 17 it says there glory to god the wicked cease from troubling and the weary be at rest and what job is said is that when we get to the other side that's when we're really going to have some peace glory that's when you're really gonna have tranquility but to get to the other side come on somebody if you talk about going to the other side to get to the other side you got to experience the person of peace on this side amen oh i love this genesis uh 31 laban and jacob came together and and and and you know there was no peace in that household too that family was totally disrupted with some of the things that had happened uh what we found there is laban his daughter's uh uh first you know he trick he trick tricked jacob into marion leah he wanted rachel and he got leah and uh and then when it was time for them to leave he said you know your dad doesn't change my wages ten times and i'm kind of getting tired i need to i need to leave here now the reason jacob had left home is because at his house in his house with his mom and daddy he had done something that disrupted peace he did something that disrupted tranquility in this house and he had to take off and run for it and now he gets down there and gets a wipe and now i don't think that let me just let me just say it like this don't think you can do something wrong over here and that you're going to get over there and it's going to be all all right what you did wrong over here going to follow you it's going to follow you and here jacob thought he got us in and and his mama said just send them to my brother you know all right he gonna go but when he got that to the brother then they had what he sold over there he was reaping over here hey hey hey hey hey here here he's over here reaping and he says uh say yeah i i work for seven years for your daughter i want rachel i i work seven years and i wanna tell y'all sisters if a young man won't work for you he don't love you i don't care how much he said out of his mouth if his actions don't show it he don't love you if he won't work for you hallelujah but here you know jacob jacob says yeah i work seven years for her i work seven you say okay i let you work seven years and he worked him seven years and boy he was so happy going to work you got to have a reason to go to work and say i'm going out here and i'm working for what i'm working for and man seven years went by it's just like yesterday and he got ready for his wedding night and good god almighty he was so excited dumb said his vows done did everything then when he says his vows and said okay y'all can go to the tent and you know say well praise the lord and get there and he lift the veil i can't believe this man just did me like to see all your deception just caught up with you hallelujah i mean you got to watch deception there's a spirit of deception that just follows you right and says all that deception because but we be scheming all kind of stuff scheming this and scheming that no no no no you ain't got peace if you're scheming because when you got peace you let god do it and i'ma tell you something if you gonna do it god ain't gonna do it god just gonna sit back and just let you work yourself to death and then you're gonna get to a point like lord i need you i've been waiting all this time to keep you give me the help that you need i've been waiting for you to get out of the way and there there jacob jacob jacob said i can't believe it now jacob ain't got no peace he says okay i'll tell you what you know you don't trick me you don't did they say well look we got this law and i never even told him about the law he'd been there seven years and never even heard nothing about this law we got this law we don't let the second one get married before the first one well i honor your law well i have to say you could work another seven years for the others i did but now he didn't work another seven he just finished a week and he got uh leah i mean rachel he got rachel but he had to work another seven years to pay off the debt and here he's 14 years like this and finally gets to the point and say i'm leaving and when they leave he tells his wives lee and rachel that they're leaving with all the kids and when they leave he says um you know we got to go and i'm just you know i i i can't take no more your daddy's doing this and your dad is doing that we got to go say okay we with you we we going with you but leah i'm sorry rachel snuck in there stole her daddy's false gods and then took off with with jacob now she never told jacob that she stole this stuff so here's jacob going and and he thought man we don't separate it and we're going and and and and he hear laban just coming behind him they even just know why is this man coming and so you can tell by the way he's riding you can tell what he's getting ready to do this man got some problems with me so he said he said uh uh so let me find out what's going on he says uh he said look i i'm okay with you going and you're going back to your family i understand all that but why you had to steal the gods man steal your gods why you accused me of this he said go through the ten and five who got your gods and kill that person that got you god oh lord the very one that he loved the most got the gods and here she has to deceive again she has the light of her daddy she's sitting on the guards and telling her daddy i'm experiencing this time of life right now and and i can't get up but she's sitting on the gods and the man could not find the gods anywhere in the tent and finally when when when laban leaves and he they had they they actually made a peace treaty and that's when laban left then it was revealed to to to jacob said yeah i got my daddy gods you got your daddy gods you almost get killed all of us killed by doing something like that see there was no peace in that family they didn't have the personal peace dwelling on the inside you know only person that can change your nature the only person that can change your very nature is jesus christ let me uh i already mentioned this before and i i told you i oh man i got so so so many little things that i want to just kind of drop off here let me let me let me i'm going to skip something here and when i was looking this this word up piece and just the the dictionary definition they had some phrases that they use along with this word and they talk about how people use the thing i'm at peace i'm at peace and what this means is it's a it's a euphemistic free from anxiety or distress and sometimes we use that word that i'm at peace and that's only for a few minutes you get another telephone call another text another email and now you're a piece done shot at the window somewhere you're in an uproar you're no longer at peace but you like that you like to make yourself think that you're at peace but the only way you can be at peace is if jesus is giving you that peace another statement that they says uh uh to be at peace is also to be dead so somebody dies we say they're at peace but remember i said there is no peace saith the lord for the wicked so it's only in christ that you can really be at peace everybody like to say this when they die or they went to a better place did they are you sure because i ain't the one saying that i don't know where they went uh it's not my job to put them nowhere i don't know but i mean some people i can tell the way they they live on this side they had peace but everybody i can't say that about i just gave you a story how this man kept getting hit over and over again he was not at peace a dead man being hit they got another one that they like to use keep the peace and that means we're refrain or prevent others from disturbing civil order in order to keep the peace you have to refrain or you have to help prevent others from disturbing civil order another one they use is rest in peace and that's stated for a person that has to cease and uh uh but like i said you can't rest in peace if you don't know jesus and here's another one that i want to give you hold your peace oh god you want to know what it mean to hold your peace that means remain silent about something oh god lord hallelujah hold your peace mean remain silent but don't say nothing my mama taught me a long time ago if you can't say nothing good don't say nothing at all hold your peace can i read down a few scriptures proverbs 11 12. i i got a whole bunch i told y'all i'm gonna get through with this proverbs 11 and 12. look at this it says he that is lord of wisdom despiseth his neighbor but a man of understanding holdeth his peace he that is vote of wisdom despiseth his neighbor but a man of understanding holdeth his peace now that says a lot let me go into proverbs 17 and 28. uh it says this even a fool oh glory to god i love the word of god even a fool when he holdeth his peace is counted wise even a fool when he holdeth his peace is counted wise and he that shutteth his lips i told y'all about that new ministry brother diggs talked to us about this new ministry and we all need to enter into the new ministry as we go into the new year practice the new ministry just shut your mouth even a fool when he holdeth his peace is counted wise and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding i mean we used to have some very hard sayings when we were coming up me and my brother very very hard sayings very hard sayings now remember once it was told to me they would never know your level of intelligence they never know i'm just dressing up the words here they never know your level of intelligence if you just keep your mouth shut but sometimes we just talk too much and through talking too much everybody know and you know and when they do that uh and they said unto you they're practicing wisdom they just they just shut in their mouth because he that understandeth holds his peace and what he realized that you don't understand without what i see i'ma let you run down this road i'ma let you run down this road you'll see some things then we'll talk but right now you can't see it hello somebody sometimes you got to just hold your peace i'm preaching real good i know i'm preaching real good because i'm preaching the bible even a fool when he holdeth this piece is counted wise and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding let me give you another one exodus 14 14. glory the lord shall fight for you and you want to know what you got to do why the lord fighting this will make me hurt myself i hurt the other leg on this one the lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace they got another one in their definition they say make peace and to make peace means to re-establish friendly relations become reconcile this needs to happen in families it needs to happen in friendships it needs to happen in churches let me read you a quote and and i'm gonna read you a few more scriptures i got a whole bunch of scriptures but i'm gonna just read you so many and i'ma stop for the day i'm coming back i'm coming back but here in the message desperations because uh i was telling you about jacob and jacob it was finally reveal you know what has happened and and and god told jacob i mean i'm sorry jacob told his wives so they had these faults god said you know put away them strange gods and the strange gods they had was the ones in their ears praise the lord he told them put away the strange gods the ones that you have in your ears put them away don't don't don't do that don't do that right and they had to get rid of them strange gods i think it's genesis 35 you'll find the story they had to put away them strange gods but here jacob was actually going going back home to his family remember he left it was it was it was it was chaos but now he's going back and he's hoping for some peace here in desperation we pick something up jacob knew that his life was close at the end he had a messenger come told him that his brother with 400 armed men was coming to meet him oh lord now this show don't give him peace my brother come up for now it's one thing my brother coming by himself but he coming with 400 men this man means something was coming to me him no he was on his road fear took a hold of him he sent man on the head with ox and cattle and sheep to make a peace offering with esau then after that he started another group with another load of stuff then he started another group with another load of stuff man he was trying to meet him first trying to turn his wrath then he got to thinking that won't stop him because he's probably richer than i am he doesn't need it then he took his wives and his little children and sent them across that he saw would see them little children and his wives and surely on his own little nieces and nephews he would not slay him then he still it still he couldn't do it god knows how to get a man jacob crossed a brook there he got down on his knees you know he had kind of he had kind of been a kind of a little shyster before that excuse the expression but kind of he was a jacob jacob means a deceiver and that's what he was but there something had to happen to him there in desperation there when death laid before him see when he got and got in touch with god while he was in prayer at this time jacob ended up wrestling with god jacob met somebody that he wrestled with and this person after he wrestled with him it changed the way he walked it changed the way he handled things something happened on the inside of jacob his nature changed after he met peace and i'ma tell you if you want something to change for you you got to meet this person peace reconciliation make peace that's what this means reconciliation look at this matthew 5 9. matthew 5 9. blessed are the peacemakers not the wicked not the wicked for the peacemakers they are they shall be called the children of god hebrews 12 and 14. follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the lord so here in this scripture we see paul connect peace with holiness follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the lord if you want to meet god in peace you have to receive his peace romans 12 18. can i just read these scriptures if it be possible as much as lieth in you live peaceably [Music] with all men i'm reminded of a scripture back in proverbs that say you know where there is no wood the fire season that mean the fire goes out you got to stop adding wood to the fire if you want peace in your home i got some more isaiah 26 and 3. thou will keep him in perfect peace you wanna know how you get it whose mind is stayed on thee why because he trusteth in thee i got some mo isaiah 52 7. if you want peace you're gonna have to come to church to get it sometimes because here it is how beautiful upon the mountains of the feet of him that bringeth good tidings that publisheth peace when we're preaching about jesus we bring in you the person of peace amen that bringeth uh that that bringeth good titus that publishes peace that bringeth good titans of good that publishes salvation that santa the zion thy god reigneth ii thessalonians 3 16. now the lord of peace himself give you peace the lord of peace himself gives you peace always by all means the lord be with you all colossians 3 15. y'all just a little bit more i i'm cutting off i'm cutting off i'm not this this this thing just get to running i got notes and notes and pages here but i have to let me just get you these scriptures colossians 3 15 and let the peace of god rule in your hearts to the which also you're called in one body and be thankful you got to find something to give god glory for even when you sitting and you know we've done this me and my wife have had counseling with couples and recently we were sitting with a couple and they were just giving us their list of what they didn't like and i don't like this and i don't like that and i don't like this so we say now what we giving you some homework to do what i need you to do is go find three things that you like about him and you find three things that you like about her and don't tell them now what those three things is y'all go out to dinner and y'all talk about the list of three things that y'all like about each other and then they have to come back and they have to tell us what they did at then and the three things that they like now tell me what you liked tell me those three things that's on your list and we want to take it even a little deeper and before you know it they start talking about all the things they like about each other they forget [Music] about the things they don't like about each other we trying to establish peace and here here the scripture tells us amen let the peace of god rule in your hearts to the which also you're called in one body and be ye thankful stop complaining find something you can be thankful about and sit and talk about that and watch how peace take control of the situation y'all got time for for another one philippians 4 verse 6 through 8. be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto god and look at this and the peace of god which passeth all understanding glory shall keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus finally brother whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things i got one more for you isaiah 53. i'm just going to verse five but i need to read more than this actually i'm gonna start at verse one lord i got i got to go i got another one wait a minute i got i got more and let me just let me let me just give this and and then uh i will uh i'm gonna leave i'm gonna leave for today i'm gonna get out y'all get out of y'all here amen amen amen amen i want this to go home with you who hath believed our report to whom is the arm of the lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground he have no form no commonness and we wishes when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hear it as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did a steam and stricken smitten of god and afflicted verse five but he was wounded i'm talking peace is a person he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him is not in nature is not at the beach it's not in the mountains the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we're healed that means we're made complete we're made whole can i just give you one more and i'm gonna stop right there my timer just went off and uh i'ma stop and i'll pick this up i got i got more to share on this because that that that that that completeness that isaiah just talked about um that that when you when you click on the word peace in that scripture in the in the hebrew lexicon it talks about tranquility contentment but it's only found in christ i got one more number six verse 23. it says this speaking to aaron and unto his sons said on this wise you shall bless the children of israel saying unto them the lord bless thee and keep thee as we're ending this year the lord make his face shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee the lord lift up his countenance upon thee and give thee peace that's my prayer as we go into this next year may god give you the peace that passeth all understanding and the only way you can get that from god is you got to know his son the prince of peace because peace is a person let's pray father your word has gone forth we pray that the word of god would bring lord the change that is needed in our hearts and in our lives you promise to keep us in perfect peace if our minds were stayed on you father and lord we realize that uh without you in our hearts there is no way we can have peace we're chasing something that doesn't even exist we don't even know what peace is until we come to know you no matter how rocky our boats in life are what situations we're facing as long as you're in the boat we got peace as long as you're in our hearts we got peace the peace that passeth all understanding it will guide and guard our hearts and minds in christ jesus says as christians we rest in this we rest lord knowing uh that this is uh uh our entire experience is built upon rest we're not to be worried and and concerned and freaking out no no no no no god you give us rest you give us peace i pray lord that this won't just be a a sermon that kind of goes in one ear not the other but lord let it let it let us process it and god and let it let it make a difference lord in our life so we bring the year to close and god we won't meet again until the new year father we're praying that you would just uh bless the saints many will be traveling god going to and fro

together amen it says and shall put my spirit in you and ye shall live and this is the part that she highlighted she says and i shall place you in your own land then shall you know that i the lord has

israel that you were going to take them into a land you promised that to the children of israel saying the lord and see when you have when you when you have a relationship when you can you can talk to him a little bit y'all can laugh while y'all talking you know anybody talk to the lord like that y'all can laugh while y'all talking to each other i say i know you promised children of israel you know that you was gonna gamble and you manifested it but it took you 400 years i said god i ain't got 400 years old but i believe your words i don't even want to be here for 100 years but lord i believe your word and i'm trusting you to fulfill your word i'm calling it next year god gonna plant us in our land he gonna perform it i'm believing that next year next year is a very special year next year

every blessing that you've given us the blessings that you have in store and [Music] as believers we rest on every promise that you gave us knowing that it will come to pass and there's nothing the devil can do to stop it from being manifested father we ask that you would just bless the saints as they prepare to leave this place many will be going into [Music] their homes and just a number of places god but as they we won't be able to have the service for new year's so they'll be celebrating with families or maybe at other churches but god we pray a special blessing as we've already read it over the saints that you would bless financially physically spiritually materially emotionally lord whatever the need is bless the people abundantly god exceed their expectations is my prayer and lord i just i just ask that you would keep us all as we lord just look forward to celebrating the closing of this year but father beginning of a new year we look back to see all the great things that you've done all the ways that you've made all the doors that you've opened god you've been very supernatural and we know you're going to even be more supernatural we could just turn the microphone over to many people he could walk up here and start testifying the lord did this the lord did that the lord did this the lord did that god it was it would just go it would be a service that just keep going on and on and on that but we just want to say thank you god in our own personal way for all that you've done thank you jesus my hallelujah god they say man has a way of saying to oh god uh just how we start a new year and even how we end the year how it affects how we start we end in peace we start in peace peace in the church peace in our homes peace on our jobs we speak peace everywhere
