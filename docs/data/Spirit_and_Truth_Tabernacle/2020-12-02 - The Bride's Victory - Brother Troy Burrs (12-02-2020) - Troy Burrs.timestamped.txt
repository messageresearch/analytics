[5:10] some of you bible readers kind of know
[5:11] where i'm going with this and uh
[5:14] uh and then we'll be going over to

[5:26] amen um we'll be reading from there the
[5:28] first
[5:30] the first verse there uh
[5:34] just trying to to to to uh give a little
[5:38] insight as the lord has just sort of
[5:40] laid it on my heart as
[5:43] what the enemy is doing in this hour
[5:46] even
[5:47] what we see that's going on now
[5:51] here amen preaching to an
[5:54] empty building but that's all right
[5:57] that's all right you know because
[5:59] the prophet uh kind of explained to us
[6:02] in the bible
[6:03] uh teaches us uh uh uh
[6:06] this is not the temple amen this is our
[6:09] gathering place for this local assembly
[6:12] amen but the temple is in you
[6:15] amen so uh we're gonna just try to hit
[6:18] some things and just kind of expose the
[6:19] devil a little bit this evening
[6:22] amen so first chronicles the 17th
[6:26] chapter the first verse it reads on this
[6:28] wise
[6:29] now it came to pass as
[6:32] david sat in his house
[6:35] that david said to uh nathan the prophet
[6:39] lo
[6:40] i dwell in a house of cedar
[6:43] but the ark of the covenant
[6:46] of the lord remaineth under curtains
[6:51] nathan said unto david do all this
[6:55] do all that in my in that's in thine
[6:58] heart
[6:59] for god is with thee
[7:03] and it came to pass the same night that
[7:05] the word of god
[7:06] came to nathan saying go and tell david
[7:10] my servant thus saith the lord thou
[7:12] shalt not bill me and house
[7:15] to dwell in for i have not dwelt in a
[7:18] house since the day
[7:20] that i brought that i brought up israel
[7:24] unto this day but have gone
[7:27] from 10 to 10 and from
[7:31] one tabernacle to another
[7:34] amen wherever i have
[7:37] walked with all israel spake i
[7:40] word to any of the judges of israel
[7:44] whom i commanded to feed my people
[7:47] saying
[7:47] we have saying why have ye
[7:51] not built me a house of cedars amen
[7:55] if we'll go over to acts the seventh
[7:59] amen acts the seventh chapter
[8:04] we'll begin reading there from the 44th
[8:09] verse
[8:11] amen our fathers
[8:14] had the tabernacle of witness
[8:17] in the wilderness and he had appointed
[8:22] speaking unto moses that he should make
[8:26] make it according to the fashion that he
[8:29] has seen
[8:31] which also our fathers that came after
[8:36] brought in with jesus into the
[8:39] possession
[8:40] of the gentiles who god drove out
[8:43] before the face of our fathers unto
[8:47] the days of david
[8:51] who found favor before god and desire
[8:55] to find a tabernacle for the house of
[8:59] jacob but
[9:00] solomon built him in house
[9:04] howbeit the most high dwellers not in
[9:07] temples made with hands
[9:10] as says the prophet heaven is
[9:14] my throne and the earth is my footstool
[9:18] what house will ye bill mean
[9:23] and the lord of in the lord or what
[9:27] is the place of my rest
[9:30] amen what house will ye build me
[9:34] saith the lord or what is the place
[9:39] of my rest hebrews the 10th chapter
[9:50] hebrews 10
[10:06] amen 10th chapter the fifth
[10:09] verse amen
[10:13] wherefore when now cometh into
[10:17] the world he saith
[10:21] sacrifice and offering
[10:25] thou what is not but a body
[10:29] has thou prepared for me
[10:32] amen a body there hot that thou has
[10:36] prepared for me
[10:37] and i'd like us to go on there and and
[10:40] read on
[10:41] down to the uh the 21st if we could just
[10:45] pick up there from
[10:46] the 21st verse it says on this while it
[10:48] says
[10:49] and having a high priest over the house
[10:52] of god
[10:54] let us draw near with a true heart
[11:00] in full assurance of faith
[11:03] having our hearts sprinkled
[11:07] from an evil conscience and our bodies
[11:10] washed with pure water
[11:14] us hold fast to our profession
[11:17] of our faith without wavering
[11:21] and he is faithful that promised
[11:26] and let us consider one another
[11:31] to provoke unto love and good works
[11:36] not forsaking as
[11:41] not forsaking the assembling
[11:44] of ourselves together as the manner of
[11:48] some
[11:50] is but exhorting one another
[11:54] and so much more as ye see
[11:57] the day approaching amen
[12:01] and and my brothers and sisters uh
[12:06] i we certainly see the day approaching
[12:10] let us go over here to the 11th chapter
[12:13] and i like to pick up a little something
[12:15] here from the 11th chapter of hebrews
[12:17] and the 9th verse
[12:19] it says by faith he surgeoned
[12:22] in the land of promise talking about
[12:25] abraham here
[12:27] he saw john in the land of promise as in
[12:30] a strange
[12:31] country dwelling in tabernacles
[12:36] with isaac jacob the heirs
[12:40] with him of the same promise for
[12:43] he looked for a city
[12:46] which had the foundation who builder
[12:49] and maker is god so
[12:53] my brothers and sisters that we we we
[12:55] certainly see that we're living
[12:57] the the current times and the situations
[13:00] that we're living in
[13:02] from from what i've seen in the
[13:04] scripture
[13:05] everything is is is
[13:08] is is is is drawing us together
[13:12] the bible says that where the caucuses
[13:16] the
[13:16] eagles are be gathered together
[13:20] but if you see what's going on in this
[13:23] in this
[13:23] present condition this present time
[13:27] we see that there's an attack of the
[13:30] enemy
[13:31] but you know something this is not
[13:34] surprising
[13:36] by no means is he catching anybody off
[13:39] guard
[13:40] we understood by the revelation of the
[13:43] word
[13:44] that these are the tactics that the
[13:46] enemy
[13:47] does amen these are the
[13:51] schemes that the enemy uses
[13:54] but we're just beginning to see that
[13:57] these
[13:57] these schemes and these tactics are at a
[14:01] greater level
[14:02] what is that telling us my brothers and
[14:04] sisters that's telling us that he's
[14:06] getting desperate
[14:08] that's telling us that it's coming close
[14:11] to the time of the end because we see
[14:14] that the battle is intensifying
[14:16] amen we see that the the the tests are
[14:20] getting greater
[14:21] we see that that that we we are getting
[14:24] to a point
[14:26] amen where everything that we've been
[14:28] taught
[14:29] everything that we've been told over the
[14:32] years and everything that we
[14:34] have have have been been explained in
[14:37] the seals opening
[14:38] and it's coming a time but we are at
[14:42] that junction right now my brothers and
[14:44] sisters
[14:45] we are at a time so many times i can
[14:47] remember
[14:48] been in the message some 30 years
[14:52] and many times that one day the doors of
[14:55] the church
[14:56] will be closed i never thought in a
[14:58] million years that we would see
[15:01] a time like this that we would actually
[15:05] see where we couldn't gather together
[15:08] for one reason or another
[15:10] amen but this is where we're at
[15:13] this is the time that we're living in
[15:16] this is the conditions
[15:18] of this present hour that is forcing
[15:21] these things to happen
[15:23] we see that the devil amen is is causing
[15:27] a great division
[15:29] everything like i said everything in the
[15:31] bible is is telling the saints of god
[15:34] it's telling the bride to gather
[15:36] together
[15:37] so many examples and saying they're
[15:39] saying that we are that this time and at
[15:41] this juncture
[15:42] should be coming together why amen
[15:45] because
[15:46] we're we're like that that that that
[15:48] those ducks are deep
[15:49] on the pawn amen we've heard from the
[15:52] lead duncan they all gather together to
[15:54] get ready to
[15:55] fly south for the winter amen but see
[15:58] what the devil wants to do
[15:59] is he wants to separate amen he wants to
[16:03] divide
[16:04] he wants to isolate amen this is the
[16:08] tactics of the enemy amen we'll show you
[16:11] that a little bit more
[16:13] i just like to take a little reading
[16:14] here from a message here that the
[16:16] uh prophet
[16:20] the arrow of god's deliverance
[16:24] shot from a bow
[16:27] preached in 1956 0801
[16:32] amen the prophet said this
[16:36] he says he says as i think of moses
[16:42] how that moses standing up there
[16:46] on the mount by the side of the burning
[16:49] bush
[16:51] now the prophet said this he said he
[16:54] lost
[16:55] all hope of freedom
[16:59] did it seem like that freedom
[17:03] that the people he so gallantly stood
[17:06] for at one time
[17:08] was ever going it was ever going to
[17:11] happen
[17:12] but in the light of god standing
[17:15] by that burning bush everything
[17:19] in him changed
[17:22] amen the prophet said it seemed like
[17:25] moses had
[17:26] lost freedom he had he had he had lost
[17:29] hope my brothers and sisters he says i
[17:32] think
[17:32] it's the same today that
[17:36] many of us lose sight
[17:39] of our freedom lose
[17:42] sight of what god gave us
[17:46] amen that listen
[17:50] the children of israel amen
[17:54] god at one time led
[17:57] them down into egypt to be sustained
[18:02] amen there was a great famine in the
[18:05] land
[18:06] and god led them there
[18:09] led them there amen to be fed amen
[18:13] to sustain life so it was a it was a
[18:17] great time
[18:19] but over time things began to change
[18:23] things began to get get get a little bit
[18:26] oh but this isn't the same like it used
[18:29] to be
[18:30] but what was going on he had to
[18:34] he had to cause trouble he had to cause
[18:38] turmoil he had to cause bondage why
[18:41] because he needed to get the people to
[18:44] pray
[18:45] as long as things was good and cush
[18:49] amen and they had need of nothing
[18:52] and everything was good amen the people
[18:55] won't pray
[18:58] amen but when the minute amen
[19:01] demanded that the taskmasters amen their
[19:04] attitudes begin to change
[19:06] the bible says that dale rosa pharaoh
[19:09] who didn't know
[19:10] joseph amen and he began to he began to
[19:13] persecute the people
[19:15] and i believe that's what's going on in
[19:17] this hour let me tell you something
[19:19] brothers and sisters we see things
[19:21] happening on a worldwide scale
[19:24] amen we're seeing things happening on a
[19:27] national scale
[19:29] but don't you get it twisted the devil
[19:31] is after one person and that's you
[19:34] amen he is not after everybody else he
[19:38] is
[19:39] after the bride of jesus christ and i'll
[19:42] prove it to you by the bible
[19:44] amen this whole thing amen the
[19:47] everything that they did amen
[19:50] against god's people against the
[19:53] children of israel
[19:54] amen was to get them and enslave them
[19:58] amen to work amen for egypt
[20:02] amen to get them to build on their backs
[20:05] and let me tell you something right now
[20:07] my brothers and sisters
[20:08] there is a battle going on right now
[20:11] there is a battle going on for the
[20:13] throne
[20:14] of your heart amen satan wants you to
[20:17] make it
[20:17] make you a worker in his vineyard
[20:21] amen but you don't belong to him amen
[20:24] you belong to god
[20:26] amen you are a temple amen his temple
[20:30] but satan desires to assist you with
[20:32] weak
[20:33] amen he desires to be worshiped amen he
[20:36] don't want to be worshipped from
[20:37] everybody
[20:39] he wants to be worshipped from god's
[20:41] wife
[20:42] amen that's who he really wants he is
[20:46] not
[20:46] satisfied with just being worshiped from
[20:49] anybody
[20:51] amen he'll take that amen but he
[20:54] wants the wife of god because if he
[20:57] could get
[20:58] a man could get a man's wife he then
[21:01] he's defeated
[21:03] amen this battle is not about you and
[21:06] i we're just in the middle of it
[21:10] amen but this is god's battle
[21:13] this battle started long before us amen
[21:17] so we but we know how it's going to end
[21:20] amen stay with me my brothers and
[21:22] sisters now we see
[21:25] amen here what the prophet said here
[21:29] same message here in the uh arrows
[21:33] of god's deliverance
[21:36] the prophet said god
[21:40] has asked us to believe
[21:43] his word he sends the holy ghost
[21:48] the spirit to energize the word
[21:53] when he fails falls into it
[21:58] when the word is being preached by the
[22:00] holy spirit
[22:02] brings the word he energizes
[22:06] that and flashes the same light of god

[28:39] the prophet said amen if you can't
[28:42] bitterly agree
[28:43] with your brother and sister and turn
[28:45] around and hug his neck and mean
[28:47] it something is wrong with your spirit
[28:51] but we got people all upset with one
[28:54] another
[28:56] over politics
[28:59] over stuff that don't matter it's gonna
[29:01] happen anyway
[29:03] prophecy is on its head i don't care
[29:06] who's in office
[29:08] this is not the time for the blood of
[29:11] jesus christ to be bickering and
[29:13] hollowing up arguing and going on one
[29:15] another he says
[29:16] right there he says keep the joy of the
[29:18] lord amongst the saints
[29:20] keep the love amongst you amen
[29:24] earlier we were reading amen to talking
[29:27] about how
[29:28] the dedication of the temple and how
[29:31] solomon
[29:32] amen was building amen this temple
[29:37] and and and the story there's and i
[29:41] think it's in
[29:42] first kings the fifth chapter amen
[29:46] he he he went and he got uh uh of
[29:49] materials from all over the place
[29:52] amen he didn't just get materials
[29:56] amen from right there where he was
[29:59] a temple hey man he got uh uh
[30:02] uh uh one from from from lebanon amen
[30:09] cedar from lebanon amen he was
[30:12] the the redwood the prophet says in
[30:15] california
[30:17] amen in africa he he went and got
[30:21] another another certain type of wood
[30:24] amen he called it a stink wood amen but
[30:28] it was
[30:28] it was knee full amen and it came
[30:31] floating in on barges and ships
[30:34] amen for one purpose amen to build the
[30:38] house of the lord
[30:40] amen and we see
[30:44] amen in this hour amen god
[30:47] building a temple building a bride of
[30:50] jesus christ
[30:51] he didn't just choose black people he
[30:54] didn't just choose white people
[30:56] he didn't just choose oriental people he
[30:59] went all over the world
[31:01] amen to choose a man a specific
[31:05] body amen to come together in this
[31:09] hour amen amen the body of the lord
[31:13] amen a body amen amen that
[31:17] a house amen the lord jesus christ
[31:20] the heart of god amen amen his
[31:24] very bride that's what the devil is
[31:27] against
[31:28] that's what the fight is for amen
[31:31] he wants the bride of jesus christ
[31:34] he wants god's most prized possession
[31:37] amen the very thing that he died for
[31:40] if he can conquer that amen
[31:43] then he then he wins that's what he's
[31:46] after
[31:47] that's the prize amen you are the prize
[31:51] hey man so amen
[31:54] we don't fall for the devil schemes
[31:58] that has uh the prophet here
[32:01] in the message uh uh uh
[32:05] uh the message uh dedication
[32:08] he says here now we find that the great
[32:12] cedars were honed down
[32:14] amen by the amen and that they
[32:18] had
[32:18] amen blueprints and they brought them
[32:22] together from different
[32:23] parts of the world he says now if you
[32:26] notice solomon
[32:28] never varied one big from the pattern
[32:31] amen he stayed right with that pattern
[32:34] that
[32:35] moses saw on mount sinai
[32:38] hey many many man moses
[32:42] say man saw the pattern solomon stayed
[32:45] right with that pattern amen
[32:48] but he used a man amen the materials
[32:52] amen from all over the world
[32:55] amen the vision he pitched the tent
[32:58] and he made it just exactly the way he
[33:00] saw it and when solomon built the temple
[33:03] he made it exactly the way
[33:06] he seen it on the pattern the tight
[33:10] moses pistol perpetual type
[33:13] because it was moved from place to place
[33:18] but solomon he made the tabernacle
[33:21] it meant just exactly in the fashion
[33:24] that moses
[33:25] did it was all put together
[33:28] and set in order exactly
[33:31] amen he said what a spiritual
[33:34] application
[33:36] but i never leave the scripture stay
[33:39] exactly with the pattern my brothers and
[33:42] sisters
[33:43] that's the reason i believe that the way
[33:46] the first church was patterned
[33:49] that's the way the next one should be
[33:52] patterned
[33:53] that's the way everyone should be
[33:55] patterned
[33:56] that's the way it was in the beginning i
[33:59] believe
[33:59] god has it that way i believe the real
[34:03] church amen i believe
[34:06] the real church all right the material
[34:09] was cut out of their native land
[34:11] and brought into one place but they were
[34:14] brought together
[34:16] he says i'm reading here from the 16th
[34:18] chapter of quoting
[34:19] when they were brought together they
[34:22] were
[34:22] so perfectly fit
[34:25] that in that space over 40 years
[34:30] it taken to put the to put the
[34:32] construction up
[34:35] and wasn't one stone to be
[34:38] saw one wasn't to be buzzed
[34:42] or solved or the sound of a hammer for
[34:46] 40 years
[34:48] talk about masonry
[34:51] and architect you know the prophet
[34:53] talked about
[34:54] uh it takes a real craftsman amen to
[34:57] turn a corner
[34:59] amen i believe god has a fivefold
[35:01] ministry
[35:02] amen that is that that he that is
[35:05] specifically designed
[35:08] amen to lead a group of people
[35:12] the one thing my brothers and sisters we
[35:14] can't we we
[35:16] we can't we we can't each
[35:19] church is not cookie cutter
[35:22] just because one thing works with your
[35:25] group
[35:26] doesn't mean it might work here at this
[35:28] tabernacle
[35:30] or one thing that might work here it's a
[35:32] it's a it's a different group of people
[35:35] it's a it's a different uh uh uh a a a
[35:38] different location
[35:40] maybe maybe maybe it gets a little cold
[35:43] where you at so you might have to do
[35:45] things a little bit different
[35:47] you have to allow amen for the
[35:50] leadership of that local assembly
[35:53] amen to be led by god amen for the group
[35:56] of people that he's placed a shepherd
[35:58] over
[35:59] amen and let me tell you something each
[36:02] and every one is important
[36:05] amen if you notice that an arrow he says
[36:08] recommend yourself submit yourselves
[36:12] i notice you know sometimes we get a
[36:14] little discouraging
[36:16] the devil is going to shoot those adopts
[36:18] well i don't know i wonder if he led
[36:22] you better rebuke that devil
[36:26] rebuke that devil because all he's
[36:28] trying to do
[36:29] is shoot a little doubt in you the next
[36:32] thing you know
[36:33] you'll be sitting at the back of the
[36:34] church and then out the door
[36:37] that's just the truth of the matter
[36:40] you can't allow these locusts
[36:43] amen to eat away at the joy
[36:47] love peace
[36:50] long suffering you see
[36:54] a brother struggling you praying through
[36:58] you see the pastor struggling with a dif
[37:00] with a decision you pray for him
[37:03] but god placed you there for a reason
[37:08] amen for nothing else to be a prayer
[37:10] warrior
[37:12] amen he placed man in charge he demanded
[37:15] to do certain things
[37:17] but that's nothing without a field to
[37:19] receive seed
[37:23] amen what is a man
[37:27] what is a man amen a man
[37:31] a man grows and he desires to get
[37:34] married
[37:36] and what he needs his wife i i i have
[37:39] yet to see a man produce a child
[37:43] by himself
[37:46] what does he wants to do he needs a
[37:49] bedding grind for
[37:50] his seed to reproduce himself
[37:54] amen and god is is his word amen
[37:58] he he's looking for a betting ground
[38:01] amen
[38:02] to plant his seed amen to reproduce
[38:05] himself
[38:08] his bride amen
[38:11] to reproduce himself
[38:15] amen amen but we see
[38:18] satan desires to stop all of that
[38:24] he desires to put all kind of roadblocks
[38:27] and different things in the way cause
[38:30] turmoils in the home caused you to just
[38:33] get a little unhappy cause you to get
[38:34] just a little bit uncertain
[38:36] now i'm looking at this whole thing with
[38:38] this the pandemic and
[38:41] and all of these things and just looking
[38:44] at how
[38:44] how this thing is playing out first
[38:47] thing
[38:49] no no no no no i'm not arguing with the
[38:51] science
[38:52] i'm not arguing with the science but you
[38:55] have to
[38:56] also look at the spiritual application
[39:01] the first thing we have to do is put
[39:03] math on
[39:04] one of my greatest things i i probably
[39:08] told the story before
[39:10] i had a person that tell me on and asked
[39:12] me a question on the interview once they
[39:14] say
[39:14] when are you at your happiest and i as
[39:17] i say when the other people around me
[39:19] are happy
[39:21] i walk through the stores and through
[39:22] the streets
[39:24] and i smile at people and they don't
[39:26] even know i'm smiling
[39:28] at them i can't tell anymore
[39:32] they could be smiling at me or frowning
[39:35] at me
[39:37] i don't know we covered
[39:41] this section of our faces now don't get
[39:43] me i'm not saying don't wear your mask
[39:46] i'm saying recognize what the devil is
[39:48] doing
[39:50] you cover your faces one of the
[39:54] warmest things you may see somebody
[39:56] walking down the street
[39:58] and just give them a nice smile and say
[40:00] good morning
[40:04] everybody got a mask on now you don't
[40:07] know whether they smiling or not
[40:09] then on the other hand you got this
[40:11] political thing going on
[40:13] they sizing you up politically i know
[40:16] this person got to be a
[40:17] democrat i can look it doesn't tell you
[40:19] a democrat
[40:20] or i can look at this prison until he a
[40:22] republican
[40:28] dividing lines on our jobs
[40:33] in our churches in our communities
[40:39] even in our homes politics
[40:43] causing divisions these are seeds
[40:47] of discrepancy these are seeds that were
[40:50] planted by the devil
[40:52] to do what for such a time as this
[40:56] because the word is telling us to gather
[40:58] together
[41:00] the word is telling us everything to
[41:03] to to to love one another
[41:06] buying that much more closer together in
[41:09] love
[41:10] amen let the let the the the gifts the
[41:14] the spiritual gifts
[41:15] amen let your your fruit hang low amen
[41:21] we're looking at this this message he's
[41:23] talking about the dedication
[41:25] amen that the the the restoration amen
[41:31] of this building we see we see that uh
[41:36] over time amen where he
[41:39] he preached in the in in the message of
[41:43] uh uh uh the the bride tree
[41:47] restoration of the bride tree and he and
[41:50] he taught us
[41:51] amen that that there that that four
[41:54] stage insect
[41:57] amen was to eat away at the at the tree
[42:02] amen but joelle there in chapter two
[42:06] said i will restore
[42:09] what was it amen there's a restoration
[42:13] that's going on
[42:15] now just as sure as there's a healthy
[42:18] tree or restoration
[42:19] here comes the devil to eat that eat it
[42:22] down again
[42:22] that's exactly what's going on
[42:26] i was speaking with some people not long
[42:28] ago and uh
[42:31] uh just talking about how
[42:35] one of the things that the prophet said
[42:37] is that
[42:39] um we have that locus
[42:43] the kinker worm the palmer worm
[42:46] the caterpillar and the locust
[42:51] and the first the first thing they eat
[42:55] off of that bride tree amen is the fruit
[43:00] he take away your love for one another
[43:04] he take away your joy of the gospel
[43:07] the peace the long suffering
[43:12] the brotherly kindness begins to eat at
[43:16] these fruit
[43:19] we look at this thing here with the mask
[43:24] some believe in wearing the mask some
[43:27] don't want to wear the mask
[43:29] but where's our brotherly kindness
[43:33] where's our brother kind if if my if if
[43:36] my brother
[43:37] or my sister has a condition in the mask
[43:41] i'm not going to fall out with you
[43:42] because you don't want to wear a mask
[43:46] and neither should well other if if this
[43:48] person well mad
[43:49] well i don't i don't i don't what
[43:51] happened to our brotherly kindness and
[43:53] brotherly love
[43:54] we can't allow these type of things to
[43:58] eat away at the fruit
[44:00] of the spirit because it's the very
[44:03] thing that's going to
[44:05] join us together
[44:08] it's the very thing that's going to fit
[44:10] the joint the
[44:11] the hair stone we're talking about the
[44:14] dedication of this building
[44:18] each stone each part
[44:22] was fitly joined together not by man we
[44:26] didn't pick people
[44:27] god chose he chose their character
[44:31] he chose their attitudes their makeup
[44:34] and everything
[44:37] amen fitly joined together
[44:42] to make up the body of christ the bride
[44:46] of jesus christ
[44:48] amen and how can i
[44:52] uh uh uh uh uh hate one part of the body
[44:56] no love that brother love that sister
[45:00] i read him because you keep an
[45:03] old-fashioned prayer meeting going on
[45:07] amen keep an old-fashioned prayer
[45:09] meeting going on i was having a
[45:10] conversation with a
[45:12] guy at work and then and and and i was
[45:14] telling me
[45:15] we was there and it was seven o'clock i
[45:17] said you had a church in prayer right
[45:18] now
[45:18] he said he said in prayer i said yes sir
[45:21] we have seven o'clock eight o'clock pray
[45:23] every sunday morning
[45:25] and he said that kind of early i say
[45:26] yeah bro but we that's what that's
[45:29] what's been keeping our church strong
[45:32] he said there's no doubt in my mind
[45:34] that's what's been keeping our church
[45:35] strong
[45:36] he said man that's really something he
[45:39] said that takes a lot of dedication i
[45:40] said yes sir it does
[45:43] and i shared with him i said i even
[45:44] tried to go sometime after work but i
[45:46] felt realized i
[45:47] that was a mistake i got there and got
[45:49] down on my knees after the whole night's
[45:51] work and
[45:52] and the devil won that day
[45:55] took a nice nap right down there on the
[45:57] front row
[45:59] but yeah the prayer keep a good prayer
[46:02] meeting going
[46:04] love one another don't let the pastor
[46:06] and i think it was the last bible study
[46:08] talk
[46:09] don't let schisms and isms enter in
[46:12] among you when you see that kind of
[46:14] stuff happening
[46:14] when you see yourself feeling like that
[46:17] you got to resist that devil
[46:20] that's your brother that's your sister
[46:24] and if i had to wear a mask
[46:28] so that another person would feel
[46:30] comfortable coming to church
[46:34] well i don't feel comfortable coming
[46:35] because everybody don't wear math you
[46:37] mean to tell me all i got to do is wear
[46:39] a mask and you'll come to church
[46:42] i'll gladly wear a mask for you
[46:46] even though i don't want to i'll gladly
[46:49] wear a mask for you
[46:52] but that's the brotherly love
[46:55] that's the brotherly kindness
[46:58] don't fall out with one another over
[46:59] these kind of issues
[47:02] this is what the devil is after
[47:06] you're playing right into his hand
[47:10] leave the politics out of it don't let
[47:13] them kind of things come amongst us
[47:16] start drawing that dividing line this is
[47:19] the body of jesus christ we
[47:20] the government shall be upon his
[47:22] shoulders and his name should be
[47:24] a wonderful counselor a mighty god a
[47:26] prince of peace
[47:29] that's who we follow
[47:32] i'll read something a little bit later
[47:34] we are getting out of here
[47:36] we're not conforming we're not
[47:39] conforming to this world but we're being
[47:41] transformed
[47:43] by the renewing of our minds amen
[47:52] i wanted to get into something here we
[47:55] look at
[47:56] how uh uh
[48:01] i take a a a an example of a great boxer
[48:06] amen been training all his life
[48:10] been training for 30 years for the big
[48:13] fight
[48:15] been doing all of his calisthenics and
[48:17] sit-ups and lifting and
[48:19] and everything for this great fight he
[48:21] got one one fight so
[48:23] the the the trainer uh uh knows
[48:26] where he's weak at and knows where his
[48:29] strengths at
[48:31] so he puts him in the ring now and and
[48:33] for a while
[48:34] he's he's shadow boxing he's just
[48:37] sitting the ring by himself and he's
[48:39] looking good
[48:40] he's floating like a butterfly you know
[48:42] and he's a light on his feet
[48:44] and he guarding he doing how he oh he
[48:46] look beautiful
[48:48] but now i put him in there against an
[48:50] opponent
[48:53] so that trainer says okay
[48:56] i i want to put him in there so i'm
[48:58] going to put him in there or get
[49:00] somebody that
[49:00] that's bigger than him and see how see
[49:03] what he do
[49:05] so this guy he he hires this guy
[49:09] and this guy's probably outweigh him by
[49:12] a hundred pounds got muscles
[49:15] everywhere and he puts him in the ring
[49:18] what's he doing he's seeing if he if he
[49:21] if he gets scared
[49:23] get scared and say man he's too big
[49:26] i i i can't do nothing with him he's too
[49:28] big look at how big
[49:30] he is training though he ain't ready
[49:35] you're not confident enough in the
[49:36] skills that you have
[49:38] you're not confident and confident
[49:40] enough in the training
[49:41] that you've been going through amen
[49:45] so he goes back and he got to continue
[49:49] training he put him in there with this
[49:50] guy and he has to get in there and have
[49:52] the confidence that he can
[49:54] he can take this guy so he goes in

[53:21] hour my brothers and sisters
[53:23] we've had a revelation amen
[53:26] of who we are and where we're at in this

[53:35] we're not guessing we're not wavering we
[53:38] know who we
[53:38] are amen we
[53:42] know what time it is amen
[53:46] let me look at some read something here
[53:49] amen
[53:53] reading here the end of the sabbath
[53:58] from matthew 28th chapter
[54:01] the end of the sabbath as it began to
[54:05] dawn toward the first day of the week
[54:08] came mary magdalene and the other
[54:11] married to see
[54:13] the subculture
[54:17] and behold there was a great earthquake
[54:20] for the angel of the lord descended from
[54:23] heaven
[54:24] and came and rolled back the stone
[54:27] from the door and sat upon it
[54:31] his countenance was as lightning and his
[54:34] raiment was as snow
[54:37] and for fear of him that for fear of him
[54:40] the keepers did
[54:41] shake and became as dead men
[54:45] the angel of the lord answered and said
[54:46] unto the woman
[54:48] fear not ye for i know
[54:51] that ye seek jesus which was crucified
[54:56] amen and he is not here he is risen
[55:01] as he said come see the place where the
[55:04] lord lay
[55:07] and go quickly and tell the disciples
[55:10] he is risen from the dead and behold he
[55:14] goeth forth into galilee
[55:18] there shall ye see him lo
[55:21] i have told you i want you to notice
[55:24] something here
[55:27] the angel is not telling jesus
[55:31] the 11 disciples directly
[55:34] he is telling this woman amen
[55:40] he's telling the the the woman there
[55:43] to uh uh go tell amen the disciples
[55:48] they didn't believe him
[55:52] amen they didn't believe
[55:56] they didn't believe this woman they
[55:57] didn't believe it they they had doubt
[56:00] amen nobody telling you uh uh
[56:03] make you truly believe
[56:07] if you believe then that is because the
[56:10] lord himself has
[56:11] given it to you to be able to believe
[56:18] amen so we notice in the bible there
[56:23] that a woman represents
[56:27] the church so we see
[56:30] that this angel amen
[56:34] came and revealed amen
[56:38] uh this angel to the woman that he's
[56:40] risen
[56:42] that he's not and and this woman was
[56:45] charged
[56:46] amen to go tell the disciples
[56:50] but right away everybody did they didn't
[56:52] believe him
[56:54] now this is just like the message
[56:57] amen we had an angel in this day
[57:02] amen that told us that that that that
[57:04] he's returned
[57:06] that that christ came and and we went
[57:09] telling neighbors and everybody but
[57:10] everybody don't believe
[57:14] everybody don't believe us
[57:18] but there's going to come a time amen
[57:21] that you'll see for yourself
[57:25] and we go on the story goes on where we
[57:27] see that uh uh uh
[57:29] he had to gather amongst them and prove
[57:32] himself amen
[57:36] amen that that that there was a
[57:38] resurrection
[57:40] amen that took place
[57:43] he had to go in and meet them in a
[57:46] specific place
[57:49] amen to prove to them
[57:52] that's what's been going on god has been
[57:56] proving to us amen that he is a
[57:59] resurrected savior
[58:02] a resurrected king amen
[58:05] and we have nothing to fear in this hour
[58:09] he's not dead the tomb is empty

[58:16] whatever come

[58:24] savior is risen

[58:32] i'm getting ready to close but i want to
[58:33] read something here
[58:36] the easter seal
[58:39] the prophet said
[58:54] he says have i ever told you anything in
[58:56] the name of the lord
[58:59] but what happened i want to
[59:03] i want you tell me about it
[59:07] every time has it been
[59:10] perfectly at the platform
[59:14] every time has
[59:18] it happened just like
[59:21] he said congregation says amen
[59:24] i stood there and looked over that time
[59:28] i seen tens of thousand times
[59:32] thousands coming young men and women
[59:36] run throwing their arms around me
[59:38] screaming i look
[59:39] right back and see myself laying on the
[59:43] bed
[59:43] oh lord look oh lord let me look
[59:48] it past the curtain of time what is it
[59:54] he says it's the quickening power that
[59:57] will catch us away
[59:59] that great quickening power the
[1:00:02] quickening power will come
[1:00:04] in the last days that's
[1:00:07] what i'm in that's what
[1:00:11] i'm in arizona for right now
[1:00:15] there's many people sitting right here
[1:00:19] stood right here at phoenix and heard me
[1:00:22] tell you
[1:00:23] from that very platform thus
[1:00:26] saith the lord how many remembered it
[1:00:30] now go uh something is fixing to happen
[1:00:36] i saw seven angels come
[1:00:40] didn't life magazine packet as the fog
[1:00:44] it floated across here uh
[1:00:47] across here 27 miles high 30 miles
[1:00:51] across
[1:00:53] it's not fred scotchman these others
[1:00:55] gene norman
[1:00:57] them setting back there stood right
[1:01:00] there
[1:01:00] when the seven angels appeared right
[1:01:03] there on the hill it
[1:01:04] shook the hills for miles
[1:01:07] like that there stood seven angels
[1:01:12] and thrown a sword into your hand
[1:01:17] said go home and open these seals
[1:01:21] that are given
[1:01:24] and here they are the true mystery
[1:01:28] of marriage and divorce
[1:01:32] and the serpent's seed and all these
[1:01:35] things
[1:01:36] that's been fussed about
[1:01:40] it's thus saith the lord what is it
[1:01:45] he says it's the quickening power coming
[1:01:47] to the church
[1:01:48] to make her ready this hour
[1:01:52] that we're approaching quickening power
[1:01:56] oh god help us to receive it let us to
[1:02:00] be help us to believe it
[1:02:03] see just depend on what your attitude
[1:02:07] you take to it whether it's going to do
[1:02:10] you
[1:02:10] any good or not though see you
[1:02:14] have to believe that you don't believe
[1:02:17] it
[1:02:19] you won't do one it won't do you one bit
[1:02:23] of good
[1:02:25] how old samuel stood there
[1:02:29] before the people and said have i ever
[1:02:31] told you anything
[1:02:33] in the name of the lord that wouldn't
[1:02:35] happen
[1:02:37] did i ever beg for money
[1:02:40] to live on now but
[1:02:43] it says no but what uh
[1:02:46] but we want the king anyhow
[1:02:51] that's the way the church is today they
[1:02:54] want their own
[1:02:55] ideas they won't
[1:02:59] pay a bit of attention to you they walk
[1:03:02] right around
[1:03:04] well it just goes on to show
[1:03:07] the quickening power is not there
[1:03:12] oh you say i spoke in tongues i
[1:03:15] jumped and i shouted that's all fine
[1:03:19] but if that quickening power is there
[1:03:23] you'll recognize like that little eagle
[1:03:28] that his mama that's the word
[1:03:32] that's thus saith the lord that's what
[1:03:35] god promised
[1:03:37] that's what he foretold that's exactly
[1:03:41] what
[1:03:42] happened we're beyond
[1:03:45] any shadow of doubt
[1:03:49] potentially in the resurrection
[1:03:54] right now
[1:03:57] the saints getting ready to be taken up
[1:04:01] in the air he said we're potentially
[1:04:06] in the resurrection right
[1:04:10] now and we're going to
[1:04:13] allow coronavirus
[1:04:19] and all of these things
[1:04:22] to shake us to divide us
[1:04:26] to separate us
[1:04:29] these are the tricks of the enemy
[1:04:36] this is just a big sparring partner
[1:04:41] that's come to hit us with a really big
[1:04:44] blow
[1:04:46] to see how you're going to react
[1:04:51] how you're going to handle the attack
