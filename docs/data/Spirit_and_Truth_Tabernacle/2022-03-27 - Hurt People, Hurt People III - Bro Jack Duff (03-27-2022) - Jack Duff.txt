leave off so just just really appreciate him god bless you brother troy man thank you so much amen um you know before i i i i give you all there was a testimony uh that we needed to share uh with you and um i got a i got a a a a a letter that was given to me just this week and it was um um my band that's what i that's that's just my name amen his sister sister beverly grieves but i call him my beth brother troy's uh mother and she sent me a you know just a letter and she said um she's telling me to say you know you were preaching some time ago and you got to talking about um uh running up your credit cards for uh for for christmas and she said you you didn't know that you said you don't you don't know why you were saying what you were saying and i said she said but i need you to know that you were saying that for me and she's online and i'm here saying something that she's online i don't even know she's like that was for me she said of some things that i had done and um and it caught up with me and you know so i got to a little situation where i was a little impressed you know with my finances and and uh she was telling me she says um you know i i was kind of in between two spots and and i needed to pay my taxes and she said but i also needed to pay my tires and i said so what i i decided to do was just uh sit write a check for my tires and write a check for my taxes and i just sent them both out by faith and i just i like you know i'm like wow she said she said i knew that i need to do this and i didn't have enough money to do it but i hadn't paid my times i said so i'ma just write it out by faith and just i just began to pray and just lord i don't want that check to bounce god i don't want that check to bounce lord i need you to move you know and she said all of a sudden um somebody could start driving down the street and uh she says a car that she's somewhat familiar with you know and they're like why is this person driving down the street and they just driving they're driving next thing they stopped at a house and what they want and they get out the house get out the car and they come up to the house and they're not going to do it like okay i wonder what they want and they walked up and they uh put an envelope in a ham praise the lord and uh they say they said god told me to give you this say god told me to give you this and left just like that so she went and counted up the the money that was in it and it was enough to take care of everything so her checks didn't bounce and god made a way he said prove me see when i open up the windows of heaven and pour you out blessings where you have room not enough to receive so she she she not only did that so she you know she paid a time she paid uh her uh her taxes and then she gave an offering so god bless you my bev amen we appreciate the testimony and thank god for you amen glory to god it's good to know that god still works his word still works amen if we just trust him amen he will do exactly what he's saying amen so praise the lord amen we thank god turn with me to genesis chapter 15. glory hallelujah genesis chapter 50 amen and um verse 19 i i trust today that we will be able to bring a little closure to this thought that we've had a man will hurt people hurt people amen i have been talking i've been reading from genesis but i've never actually talked about it so hopefully today we can do that now genesis 50 and in verse 19 says and his brethren also went and fell down before his face and they said behold we be our servants and joseph said unto them fear not for am i in the place of god but as for you he thought evil against me but god meant it unto good to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people alive amen let me let me go into verse 21 here says now therefore fear ye not i will nourish you and your little ones and he confident them and speak kindly unto them so we have a word of prayer father we thank you for amen all that you're doing in our midst we thank you father for allowing us to be able to gather uh once more um we pray father that as we come here today that you administer uh to our hearts and to our needs you know exactly what we stand in need of let the word of god do only what the word can do and we trust god that you would just not only be with us but those that are at home those are looking online be with them so many god going through in their bodies we pray a special touch upon each one and uh god those that are away for whatever purpose actually should be with them and thank you for the powerful testimony you gave us there from my bev and may you just continue to prove yourself to your people uh over and over and over again we ask god that you would take control of the thought that'll be presented here today and may you receive all the glory and all the honor from our gathering it's in jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you you can be seated um again we want to continue our thought of hurt people hurt people this is part three we have just been bringing this um because it is a real thing uh in in church uh we have seen it i i've brought it to you from just various different angles we you know we see it in family uh i i've given you some of the results of what happens in families uh when uh families go through hurt um you know we're giving you you know just just uh some talked about last time and i was so blessed how um when last sunday we were there at the at brother west coast and brother nathan got into talking about brother ramsey and uh i just finished preaching about brother ramsey how he was a minister that was hurt i mean he was a pastor that got hurt you know uh and in ministry and just through his hurt it caused him to give up cause him to quit just throwing the towel and uh you know and and and i think the the reality that i was trying to bring to is that yes even here in the pulpit ministers get hurt ministers can get hurt this is something that we all uh have to bear jesus said it's it's impossible for offenses not to come amen so so as as believers we understand that there will be offenses in our life there will be things that uh we will we will endure things that we'll have to you know go through uh but uh the the thing of it is is not to allow your experiences to make you bitter come on somebody but the experiences actually come to make you better right so not to make you bitter but better and what you need to understand what you need to try to find out god what are you trying to speak to me amen through this situation what what where are you trying to take me to uh it's one thing just i i i mean i know we've all been hurt but i don't i don't think we should dwell in our hurt amen that that's not where we should dwell is in our heart uh i mentioned it before god wants to turn your pain into purpose amen god wants to turn your process into praise amen god wants to turn your misery into a masterpiece glory to god and god can turn your mess into a message right so god can use your hurt if you will allow him to amen so you know today we want to you know try to give some practical things that we could use to to make it through her it's one thing to be heard and you know and a lot a lot of skills you know man yeah i've been hurt but where are you at now glory to god where are you going to amen so so so so the thing of it is is that we want to be moving forward in christ i want to use amen just a little a a little quote here this morning from the sermon uh or actually the book the 20th century prophet uh there was a statement made here to a woman that was in the prayer line and i just want to read this amen as we just kind of get started here uh this morning uh here you know uh brother branham uh says this in the sentence and this this book the 20th century prophet says excuse me sister he's in a prayer line he's in a prayer line he says i have to relax my mind once in a while now we'll we'll be strangers i see that you're you are strictly a stranger to me you're from away from here you've come from another city you've got a lot of trouble on your heart you got heart trouble to begin with he's discerning what's going on in her life you got heart trouble to begin with is that right he said there's a whole lot of blackness says i see a black sheep keep following you like that oh it's alive it's a black sheep following her he says oh it's a lie amen he said somebody told a lie on you good god almighty and that was a man was professing divine healing this lady is gonna get hurt where in church i want you to catch this amen i mean understand this lady is coming to church with a man a very clear conscience this lady wants to draw closer to god this lady amen uh realizes she needed more from god she had enough faith to get into a prayer line and when she got into the prayer line she got told something that was a lie oh a lie can hurt you in church oh hallelujah amen look at this now uh he says this he says a black sheep keep following you like that oh it's a lie somebody told a lie on you and that was a man professing divine healing the sister says yes sir he said you was a witch yes is that true and you got a whole stir in your church or something another about it isn't that right your pastor is sick right now he has got polio is that right says sister don't pay no attention to what them people tell you they're lying oh hallelujah this just blessed my soul he said don't pay no attention to what the people telling you that they're lying and the only things wrong with your heart is that nervous condition got your heart worked up go on home in peace and god bless you you're all right god bless you you're not a witch and here's the thing that i that that i realize here amen this lady was distressed over a lion preacher amen and some of us have been distressed over things that have happened inside the church maybe somebody said something about you that was not right maybe it was a lie that they told on you and you get hurt by things like that but i'm here to tell you if it was a lie you don't have to hold on to that lie you can release that and let it go brother branham never prayed for this lady he just told her that you are not a witch you are not what they say you are amen you don't have to accept what they the names that they call you you don't have to walk in that but you can be all god said that you are hallelujah glory to god see this lady was so distressed by what the lying preacher said amen and and not only did she suffer in her own body but she caused others in her church to suffer from what she was going through my god and i want to tell you here her freedom came when she was able to release the lie and accept the truth and i'm here to tell you this morning your freedom will come when you're able to release those lies and accept god's truth over you glory to god amen so you know uh i want to maybe come back to her a little bit later amen but but the thing that the thing of it is here is that we got to understand god has purpose for everything and and hurt you know is is something that uh like i say it's real you know the definition of of of hurt is to cause physical pain or injury uh or to cause mental pain or distress to or you can have a lot of mental pain mental distress amen you got to let it go you got to find some kind of way to let it go i'm talking even to myself this morning you got to let it go amen i i i can i don't want to be a brother ramsey but but i mean things happen you got to find a way to let it go god i'm giving this thing over to you and ain't nothing i can do about it amen ain't no sense of me crying about it ain't no sense of me worrying about it i'm here to release it to you father oh glory to god amen i was reading a little something there this week and you know brother branham saying you know sometimes things happen and maybe somebody do something and it's hard for you to say something nice to that person y'all ain't gonna talk to me but sometimes people say something or do something it's hard for you to say something nice to him it's very hard he said he says what he says if it's hard for you to say something nice it says what you need to do after amen you get out of their presence go on your knees and start praying for them and you don't realize why you praying for them god is changing you oh glory to god god is actually changing you while you're praying for them and before you know it the next time he comes to any presence you can greet him with a smile because god has dumped something on the inside of you but you got to be willing to release it no sense in holding on to it you know i i was uh looking here at a at a little statement here and i think i have time to read this so let's let's go to godhead explain amen a quote out of godhead explain here the prophet is is making a statement here a amen because you know i want to tell you denominations are usually started because somebody got hurt another church gets started because somebody got hurt amen that's how church did another church get started another church so i sometimes a pastor come and preach and he's not trying to say nothing that caused no hurt but he's just saying just preaching but somebody take it the wrong way hurt and i'm leaving i'm gonna start another church and i'm gonna tell you when the church has started like that it usually don't last amen you can't build a church like that another thing i found out you can't you can't you can't build your ministry on putting other people down you got to lift yourself up by putting other people down something wrong with you your ministry got to be built on the word of god all right look the prophet says this and god had explained this now you see what i mean brethren i'm driving towards the one thing jesus christ and the uniting of the body of jesus christ that's what my purpose is that i don't say nothing about hey you ain't baptized in jesus name you're going to hell now he said now that's nonsense oh i i i love this i ah i feel jesus i'm i'm going to tell you something there's many people that are not walking according to this message because the message has been given to them the wrong way we don't package it right i mean we put people in hell real quick amen if they don't see it this way you set up a denomination in the message you got to wait for god to show them things ain't nobody forced this revelation on you amen it came to you by grace you got to let god give it to them by grace amen then jesus tell peter flesh and blood have not revealed these things unto you but my father in heaven has revealed it you gotta wait for god to open things up to people and until then be patient with them you gotta you amen you just gotta be patient and you gotta handle things with nurse's gloves that's to try your patience you understand that's to try your patience oh glory to god i don't say nothing about hey you ain't baptized in jesus name you're going to hell brother bran i'm saying now that's nonsense even though being baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ is the right way it's just the approach sometimes our approach creates hurt and i'm and i'm here to tell you i see many people that that have walked away from this truth because they've been hurt it was presented the wrong way and i'm gonna tell you another thing even even we as believers we've had to grow we didn't have this thing all together at the beginning when we first got ahold of this it was like dynamite we were blowing everything up we blew up everything and in the process we destroy everything destroy our families destroy our homes destroy the church we not lost jobs because of a man being unwise we have to grow we have to develop we have to mature amen i thank god the word can bring us to maturity amen not only are we all hurt people but we have hurt people along the way oh god help us all right let me keep reading i'll tell you what happened the other day i was down in texas um uh and the brethren uh here our witness to this the oneness church 72 churches sponsored my meeting i put and i put brother petty the assembly of god brother up on the platform that night now so here this is 72 oneness churches but he has one brother on the on the uh on the platform sitting behind him that is um that is uh uh uh assembly of god so he's not oneness now watch this 72 wonders but then one that's a little different now i just love his name his name is brother petty y'all i hope y'all got it i hope you get it because there's some petty stuff i mean it's some petty things that we hold on to and we don't realize these petty things just just destroy us look at it brother patty the assembly of god brother up on the platform that night now you know that's true he's a precious brother brother petty if any of you know him from beaumont texas he's one of the finest men i ever met his wife is a converted catholic a real sainted woman he's a real man of god tell me who's a finer man than brother roy weed of the assembly of god symbols of god mention any of these men look here all these brothers i know around here brother from the philadelphia church here and the sims of god men and who's any finer people tell me tell me who's a finer man than jack moore tell me amen he says uh uh uh what what they call they belong to them he's not a radical you find radical on both sides and that's where people point and that's where the devil points but they're all men of god gods give them the holy ghost if it wasn't for the grace of god we all be gone with our fusses and things that's exactly right but the grace of god binds us together no wonder we can sing blessed be the tie that binds our heart in christian love that's what we need brother branham is trying to bring a uniting oh can i just actually are your actions bringing a uniting or a dividing are your words bringing a uniting or a dividing you know when when when i when when the churches came together last year we i i remember making some statements that you got to be ready for the growth right and you got to be ready for the things that are going to change around you and and as you get ready for it you're bringing a uniting and accepting a welcoming presence oh hallelujah oh i i i know what i'm talking about amen because if you're not prepared you don't know what the next season gonna bring amen and if we can't get over these petty hurts these petty you know your sister didn't mean to do that you know your brother didn't mean to do that why are you gonna let the devil let you hold on to things like that let it go let's go on here let's go on let's go let's go on my god he says um then and so you know what the general superintendent over the church called me up he said did you know what you did last night now they couldn't get nothing outside of the service this all they got this brother patty sitting on the on the platform he said do you know what you did last night uh my second night there i said what i said we had a wonderful meeting oh hallelujah i can go back to last week we had a wonderful meeting but how many gonna find something in the weekend oh god i i i i have to let it go i it's something something something did happen last weekend and i'm i'm sitting here debating i'm gonna have to let i'm gonna have to pass it by because something did happen and and and i have to release it i'm gonna just let it go and the way i release it just don't say nothing just don't say it don't say nothing i mean but you just don't know sometime what i mean like i said medicines can get hurt different things you're accused of this accused of that but you know what you just gotta let it go let me let me just keep reading amen hey man you know you know just you know when i do that sometimes y'all don't realize when i have to pause i have to stop and and just process real quick lord do i say that or not because sometimes the devil actually want me to say something that could create some problems now i can be justified in what i'm saying right but but but i got i got to use wisdom is that really edifying anybody is that helping anybody is it only helping me is it helping because i'm not here for me i'm a gift to the people so as a minister i got i got to be careful take us to take a step back pause call time out before you just release something out of the atmosphere all right so sometimes even in preaching you battle it because the devil right here trying to say that say that i ain't saying nothing but what god told me to say all right all right all right let me keep going i'm trying to get through this series but but he says he says um my second night there said what so we had a wonderful me he said you had a man on your pulpit was a sinner now holy ghost filled man they calling him a sinner he said i said i i didn't know it who was it i it said that mr petty and notice that the title they use mr petty rather than rather than brother give him his two respect brother repented brother petty not mr petty he said he says oh i said a sinner well i said he's an assembly of god preacher brother and look at how brother brandon put that brother on the end of it assembly god preacher brother he said yes but he's still a sinner because he hasn't been baptized right and i said brother pray tell me why i said he's got the holy ghost he said brother branham what did peter say repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins therefore your sins cannot be remitted until you're baptized in jesus name now watch them now because they don't build their doctrine on this glory to god but they don't realize their doctrine is about to be shook by another scripture that's why you can't put a period on what you believe put a comma there look at this he says is that the formula my brother he said that's the formula i said god upset his own apocart and then in acts 10 49 for while peter yet spake these words the holy ghost fell on all them which heard the word and they had never been baptized at all then god gave the holy ghost to people that wasn't even converted i said where in the world are you standing now see brother brandon was trying to show him a a greater way to handle things and this is this is what i what i want to try to drive home for for hurt people there's a greater way that we can handle things amen because hurt people usually kind of pull back to themselves hurt people go into isolation hurt people want to avoid everybody you know that that's what hurt people do when you get sick yeah that's what you're about you just want to lay in the bed you want you want to try to avoid everybody and you know and i understand that's the way i feel i don't want to be bothered by nobody i'm not feeling well right now amen this is what hurt people do but when you're hurt spiritually you do the same exact thing you withdraw from people you pull back and god don't want you to pull back he wants you to go forward look at this look at this brother brahma is going to teach us a lesson here let's go on in the quote you asked brother where you standing at now you say the man was a sinner but god filled him with the holy ghost even though he has not come to the understanding of water baptism he's still got something you got to learn to work with people where they are i don't have seen too many times where people try to i mean let me you know i'm gonna use fishing as an analogy how many i mean you don't you ain't even caught the fish yet you got your knife out and you about to scale it you don't even have it yet you gotta wait to catch the fish before you can scale a fish wait until you got him in the boat in the bucket amen then bring your knife out my god but don't scale until you catch them oh you got to change this you got to dress like this you got to you know what they can do all that amen just for you they can do it all just for you but when they get out and by themselves they're doing something you want something that's in a person's heart that'll keep them 24 hours a day seven days a week not just on sunday and wednesday we want the real thing in people's hearts hey if god can give you that conviction he can give that conviction what you got to do is pray that god would give it to him pray and wait pray and wait that's the hard part the waiting part because we we we we we we microwave christians we pray and we want something right now god don't do things that way he he teach us patience and so and if you don't realize how long you got to wait ask noah he waited 120 years abraham waited 25 years amen pray and wait let me go on look at this this this this this principle that we get from here he says um you know you know we're going to do so we're going to draw a little ring and drawing you right out of our circle it was the man telling brother branham after he just had a good service because brother branham had brother patty see this this preacher is picking up something petty and he says uh brother man in response to the man says then i said i'm gonna draw another one i'm gonna let you draw a circle and you're gonna draw me out but um since you can draw then i can draw and you're gonna draw a circle and you're gonna draw me out but i'm gonna draw another circle and i'm gonna draw myself right back in oh we don't let the devil draw circles in here but it's time to i want you to get your finger in the sand and draw a bigger circle put yourself back in fellowship with your brother or your sister says then i'm gonna draw another draw another one and draw you right back in again so i said you can't draw me out cause i love you so you just can't do it i said there's too many of you brethren out there that love me and believe in me and i said they'll come anyhow i said they'll come and you can't draw me out if you draw me out i'll draw you back in when you make one circle god uh by his grace will let me draw another one and pull you right back in that's right draw them right back again it's time for us to draw bigger circles amen stop letting hurt people keep hurting people but let's draw bigger circles and just let the love of god amen be expressed from our hearts to others god uses human beings to redeem other human beings i want to go back to a scripture here in john 18 35 brother troy uh brought this to us a man a few months ago and and i'm picking up this uh this scripture again because i want to just kind of make this point i'm trying to move on jesus was crucified by hurt people jesus was crucified by her people the religious leaders were hurt in john 6 a man and and that caused him persuade the peop persuade the the people of that day uh to ask for barabbas rather than jesus in matthew 27 but we pick up in john 18 35 this scripture pilate answers jesus is standing before pilate amen before uh judge to be judged amen pilate answered him and am i a jew in john 18 35 says thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me what hast thou done amen and when brother troy was ministering on this he you know he he he he made the statement he says pilate is you know just using it in today's language what have you done to make these people so upset what did you do jesus i mean these people are running you to my to to my hall to be judged by me and i can't figure out what i'm not a jew i don't understand your law and why this and why that but they running you here to be judged what have you done hallelujah i want to go back to john 8 verse 36 and let's kind of show a little bit of what was done jesus amen did not come necessarily to try to hurt people intentionally amen not like this preacher that got in the pulpit and he told that lady she was a witch and i just got i need to say this i need to say this you say she a witch but she came to church to be prayed for she came to church to be praying for why didn't you pray that spirit off of her but you just let the lady leave there you a witch and just let them let her leave there i don't know what what that what was in that preacher's mind to do that to that woman to have her messed up like that she was hurt emotionally she was hurt mentally she was hurting all kind of with and it hurt her church because of that but the lady was there to be delivered why didn't they pray for deliverance maybe he thought he was something by just telling how she was a witch oh my but thank god she ran into a real prophet amen someone that told us they just lied on you and all you got to do is release that lie and you'll be free accept god's truth of what he said about you here amen jesus came uh not not intentionally bringing hurt but what jesus did was bring truth and here i'm here to tell you something this morning the truth does hurt now the truth is not coming to hurt you in a way amen to to uh to make you make you bitter but the truth comes in a way to to help you to make you better glory to god the truth will hurt glory to god but but but the truth actually has a healing bomb in it if we could accept it now jesus brought fruit to the religious leaders of his days they did not want to receive it now look here in john 8 36 pilate want to know what hath thou done here are some of the things that jesus did john 8 36 says if the son shall if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed amen i know that ye are abraham's seed but ye seek to kill me because my word have no place in you he's given them truth i speak that which i have seen my or seen with my father and you do that which you have seen with your father now look at this truth that's going now he's he's telling him now you of your father the devil that's what he give me to tell him says they answered and said unto him abraham is our father jesus saith unto them if you were abraham's children ye would do the works of abraham my but now you seek to kill me a man that have told you the truth which i have heard of god this did not uh of this did not abraham ye do the deeds of your father then said they to him we be not born a fornication we have one father even god now they're trying to use their words to even hurt jesus we be not born a fornication oh hallelujah see i'm gonna tell you something jesus knew he was not born a fornication he was the virgin born son of god and let me tell you something you don't have to wear the title that people assign to you when you know who you are we be not born upon uh we be not born of fornication we have one father even god jesus said unto them if god were your father you would love me for i perceived forth and came from god neither came out of myself but he sent me glory and look at this now he says why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word oh here's the one that hurt him here it is here it is ye are of your father the devil and the lust of your fathers he will do he was a murderer from the beginning identifying where this murdered spirit came from it came from satan amen he was a murderer from the beginning and abode in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it when jesus gave them this truth this created a great hurt it caused hurt amongst these religious leaders and because of the hurt that they experienced amen they themselves began to call for his crucifixion through the people oh hallelujah how many have been heard in church because a preacher has told the truth and then they go spreading all kind of nonsense all throughout the church and what they try to do is kill that man's influence they i mean brother branham say you don't have to necessarily take a knife amen and stick it in the back of somebody but you can just the way that you talk about them and you kill their influence that that's you might as well just to murder them just by killing their influence you should have just went ahead and murdered him and i'm gonna tell you something when when oh i'mma just say it when parents kill the influence of the preacher the preacher can't help their family can't help their kids you have destroyed the influence of the preacher in your family's life and now that preacher cannot help your kids and it's because of what you said oh you know i i can go back in the scripture now you know brother brother brother brother branham told us that you know that when them she bears came and destroyed all them kids it was because of what the parents were saying in the house what they were saying in the house it destroyed i mean it i mean they were disrespecting the man of god they were disrespecting the prophet and as they were disrespecting the prophet their kids got it and didn't know how to how to control it on the outside oh my see the parents talk about it on the inside but the kids don't know how to control what they heard on the inside how to stop it from coming out on the outside and here they come old bald head prophet go on up like your master did and they they just criticized he got upset now i won the holy ghost but he got upset and it caused she bears out and they destroyed i think 42 children but that came because of parent delinquency amen if even if you don't agree with the pastor just respect the office respect the office glory to god many all are blessed today because you respected the office you might not agree with everything but you respected the office and you're blessed all right let me keep going verse 44 says you have your father the devil and the lust of the father you will do he was a murderer from the beginning and a vote not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it and because i tell you the truth you believe me not which of you convinces me of sin and if i say the truth why do you not believe me he that is of god uh he that that is of god heareth god's words ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of god now they could uh take the lineage and show you where they were born and how they were born and how they were abraham's seed physically spiritually jesus told him you are of your father the devil this truth this truth generated an internal hurt it caused the religious leaders to encourage the people to call for the crucifixion of matthew 27 uh we also see in the scripture that uh even after jesus died uh stephen a man who was a a deacon in the church there uh he ran into the same religious group glory to god hurt people hurt people this same religious group and he picks him up in acts 7 and and i'ma tell you hurt people will continue to hurt people these hurt people amen these religious leaders that that took jesus to a cross and he did nothing wrong nothing wrong they took jesus across the same her her group would take stephen and stone him hurt people continue to hurt people look at it in acts 7 51. it says you stiff-necked and uncircumcised and hardened ears this is a deacon preaching to him now he says you do always resist the holy ghost as your fathers did so do ye now can i can i just inject a little something here this is a deacon preaching and notice what the deacon the deacon is coming straight at him oh i'm saying something because sometimes when a deacon speaks he say something that might generate hurt not intentionally amen he's not picking on you he's picking off of you amen but god gives him an anointing to be able to say certain things and let me tell you they need to be seen you stiff neck and uncircumcising hardened ears you do always resist the holy ghost as your fathers did so do ye it says which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted and they have slain them which look which show before the coming of the just one of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murders he's telling y'all jesus said you of your father the devil as he murdered the beginning you murdered me i ain't did nothing wrong now here's stephen picking up the same sermon and so y'all murdered him hallelujah then let him off the hook y'all murdered the king of kings he says we have received the law by disposition of angels and have not kept it when they heard these things they heard again they were cut to the heart and they gnashed on him with their teeth my god you can imagine what they were thinking they gnashed on him with their teeth but he being full of the holy ghost looked up step fast into heaven and saw the glory of god and jesus stand on the right hand of god and said behold i see the heavens open and the son of man standing on the right hand of god then they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and ran upon him with one accord and cast him out of the city and stoned him and witnessed witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet whose name was saul here we see hurt people continuing to hurt people they never go through a process of healing and this is what i want to tell you uh we all like i said we've all been hurt at some point in time and we're going to be hurt in the future if you haven't been you're going to be hurt at some point in time it's how you handle the hurt it's how you process the hurt but sometimes the hurt is for your good actually i'm gonna say it like this all the time the hurt is for your good how can you say that brother jack because the bible said all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are called according to his purpose let's pick up a quote here out of the mighty conqueror here brother brother branham's talking about the lord jesus amen he was hurt the very people that he came for rejected him and and this hurt actually is what what caused him to die on the cross he died from a broken heart it wasn't from the nails in his hands and things like that in his feet it was from a broken heart hurt people go through things in the on the inside on the inside it manifests itself sometimes in our in our in our physical being but it's something that's happening in the heart at the heart level we got to have god come in and bring healing to the heart and i'm gonna tell you because if god bring healing to the heart it'll manifest in every other area of your life look at this this this this statement out of the mighty conqueror he says uh and his own dear mother walking in his bloody footprints god let me walk the same way and as he went yonder to calvary down in her heart was a wandering and when she seen her darling child die young the man 33 years old and looked like 50 the bible said of his strained weight probably turning grave and the grim look on his face to where he was suffering not so much physically the grim look on his face where he was suffering not so much physically but as it was agony and what agony means is extreme physical or mental suffering that's what hurt is it's mental suffering right it says the bible said that his blood and water separated from each other and any doctor anything can tell you that knows the chemistry of blood that only sorrow will do that only sorrow will do that he never died from a roman spear neither did he die from a nail drove in his hand or his feet but he died of a broken heart being rejected amen he came to his own in his own received him not said brother branham i wish i could stood there that day at calvary brother you're standing in a better place today you're standing in the presence of a resurrected lord jesus who has proved himself triumph so here we see it was hurt that actually caused him a man to die at calvary's cross this internal pain that he that he went through even though he was hurt by the people that rejected him i want you to understand why he was there on the cross he did something that all of us need to do i told you we got to draw the circle bigger amen when they draw you out you got to draw them back in glory to god and what jesus did they drew him out but the way he drew them back in he prayed a prayer even on the cross father forgive them for they know not what they do can you say that to the people that might have hurt you father forgive them for they know not what they do hallelujah hallelujah this is found a man this this this whole um example is found in the life of joseph what we see in the life of christ yes he was hurt as well everybody gonna get hurt by something in life you can get hurt by family members you can get hurt by co-workers you can get hurt by church members you're gonna get hurt by something but what you gotta learn to do is commit things to the lord in prayer husbands can be hurt by wives wives can be hurt by husbands children can be hurt by parents parents can be hurt by children i mean it's just heard everywhere the congregation can be heard by the pastor the pastor can be hurt by the congregation it's hurt everywhere but we don't want to just have a cycle of hurt people hurting people somewhere that cycle got to be broken and i pray that through the word that we can break the cycle we recognize it but god how do we break out of this how do we break out of this lord what can you and not only what can you do but i know you can do something on the inside of me where you can take the hurt away i want to be like jesus i want to pray like jesus father forgive them for they know not what they do joseph life was a perfect type of christ he also is in agony for for many things that he suffered we're picking him up in genesis amen again now he was hurt by the fact that his own brothers rejected him just as christ was hurt that he the bible says he came to his own and his own receiver not he was hurt through that by that rejection oh my oh glory says uh and joseph life you know i want to just see if we can let's see here yeah yeah uh and joseph life so many things that happened in his life was a was an exact uh replica what happened in the life of the lord jesus uh when they threw joseph in a pit and supposed that he was dead but joseph was raised up out of the same pit that they threw him in glory it was a type of lord the lord jesus going into a grave but he was raised out of the same grave that they threw him in and i'm here this morning to tell you it's time for you to come out your pits it's time for you to be resurrected from the hurt it's time for you to be resurrected from the pain it's time for you to release those things that amen have had you bound god wants to bring you out of the the pit of despair the pit of feeling like you are a victim no you are a victor hallelujah amen uh the other thing is they sold joseph into slavery amen they they lied about his death glory to god when they went back to their father they lied about joseph death and they they said you know we found uh this uh this this coat of many colors and it's been and maybe a wild animal might have got them and we don't know what happened daddy but we found this and knowing that they had sold him into slavery but they lied about his amen about his death i found the same thing in scripture that when jesus rose again amen the soldiers were told a lie about the resurrection hallelujah hallelujah his life was the perfect type of the lord jesus he spent years a man uh and as a slave and and he was bought and and took down to potiphar's house and and they had to serve under potiphar's roof and and there and part of his house would lie again hallelujah by part of his wife i want to like i started with the quote where this lady had a lying black sheep that's a a black sheep followers a lying spirit following her amen joseph had lie after life following him you might have lie after lie following you but you don't have to accept the lie and maybe the lie amen as it as it did in joseph like it have created some really difficult times for you maybe the lie have made it very stressful in your life maybe the lie has caused you to make decisions that you never thought you would have made maybe the law has been doing that to you but you don't have to accept a lie anymore accept god's truth to what he says about you here joseph is in prison because of a lie here joseph is in prison because his brothers sold him into slavery here joseph is in prison because his brothers hated him without a cause here joseph is is going through all these things you talk about a man that has been hurt we see a man that's been hurt but here we see while he's in prison god allows a man a particular thing to happen here uh he sends the butler and the baker into this prison and when he gets there the butler and baker has a dream and joseph amen interprets uh the dream glory to god of both men and when he interprets one one is going to be raised back to life and the other is going to go on to death mine was a perfect type of the lord jesus because when he hung on the cross there were two male factors amen and one was going to meet him in paradise and the other was going to go on to his eternal rewards hallelujah glory to god a perfect type of the lord jesus and i want i want to i want to ask you a question and i want to pick up something here in in genesis 45 we're going to go here to genesis 45 and start in verse 1 in a second but i want to just ask you a question about joseph class did joseph attend to learn how to process hurt what internet site did he go to amen to get some information on how to go through things like this i want to ask another which pastor did he sit down with to get counseling see he didn't have none of those joseph had the word of god to carry through and and and i'm gonna tell you what what the other thing i feel joseph at is he had the dream that god gave him amen all he had was a dream that he and i i can just uh just imagine that when the butler and the baker came with their dreams it might have reminded joseph of his dream and that's why he might have told him brother says down now now look when y'all leave hey when he told the butler when you leave don't forget about me now he knew that god was going to bring him out somehow someway but that wasn't the season for it had to wait two more years i want to tell you amen right now you might be you might be pressing god for a man particular thing to happen right now could i tell you this might not be the season god always has an answer it's going to be either yes no or just not yet genesis 45 verse 13 joseph has gone through all these things and what i'm i'm just here to just just kind of get you to see yes we all been hurt and we have reasons for you know maybe feeling the way that we feel but at some point in time we got to be able to identify with some of the characters of scripture and we can see how yeah they've been hurt too but look at how they came through i want you to watch the words of joseph now we we see him after he's been raised out of prison we're picking him up in scripture he's been he's come out of prison he's standing in pharaoh's court he's revealed pharaoh's dreams and and now he's been elevated to a place of second and command in the kingdom but he had to go through all these things god was using all that for joseph's betterment god's using everything you've gone through for your betterment look at this in genesis 45 then joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him and he cried caused every man to go out from me and there stood no man with him while joseph made himself known unto his brother verse 2 says and he wept aloud and the egyptians in the house of pharaoh hurt and joseph said unto his brethren i am joseph dove my father yet live and his brethren could not answer him for they were troubled at his presence look at this and joseph said unto his brethren come near to me i'm drawing the circle bigger come near to me amen and i pray you i pray you and they came near and he said i am joseph your brother whom he sold into egypt they couldn't imagine they they you know they totally lie so long that our brother is dead they believe their own lie but now joseph is standing who said no i'm joseph your brother come near to me oh glory to god look at this amen uh now therefore be not greed nor angry with yourselves that ye sold me hither for god did send me before you to preserve life oh i just love the way joseph is approaching this i know you hurt me i know you caused pain in my life but i don't want you to be grieved by it god allowed these things to happen for a reason not only am i here to save myself but i'm here to save you as well god wants to use human beings to redeem other human beings there's a cause for redemption a price has to be paid for redemption look at this amen verse six for these two years have the famine been in the land and yet there are five years in the which there should neither be earring nor harvest and god sent me before you to preserve a pot preserve you a posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance i i want y'all to get this look at this next verse look at this look at what joseph says so it was not you that sent me there oh it wasn't you that sold me into slavery it wanted you to cause me to go through all this it wasn't you it ain't got nothing to do with you oh i can go back in my life i can go back in my life when when i lost my job the second time i so had a problem with the guys that were set across the table from me but i had to realize it was not them god just god had to give you a certain disposition to make you do what you needed to do in order to put me where he wanted me to be had he not made you the way that you were i would not be standing here today so here i can say thank god for the man he made you to be thank god that you had the amen that the unction and the courage to make the decisions that you made it was not you [Music] it was not true i'm here to tell you it was not your brother it was not your sister it's not them your hurt was not them [Music] it was not you that sent me hither but god and he hath made me a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of egypt it's not you brothers y'all ain't got nothing to be worried about and they couldn't believe it they couldn't believe this but you know you know a man that had been sold by his brothers he had a reason to be upset he had reason to to get revenge and he was in a place he was in position in order to be able to take revenge and nobody would stop him but something that changed on the inside man he sent him back home said go get daddy tell him what you don't heard but down here in egypt tell them and come on down here and i and i just the rest of the scripture you can go back and read it he said when it's time when i know daddy gonna be thinking about this stuff and that stuff tell daddy regard not your stuff don't worry about holding on to nothing let go of everything and come on down here i'm going to take care of y'all tell daddy his son is in a pretty good position i'll take care of you don't tell daddy it's all right and and let them know i forgave y'all it's all right you can tell them the truth not it wasn't y'all that put me in the pit it wasn't y'all that told that life all these years it wasn't god did that for a reason tell that there's five more years left of this family it's gonna get rough but i'm i got something i'm gonna reserve you and preserve your family i'm gonna make sure everybody taken care of see that's why we pick him up over here in genesis 15 i read this earlier let's start at verse 17 now because my dad is gone and they thinking joseph doing all this because daddy was alive no i did this because it was in my heart here genesis 50 verse 17 so shall verse 16 let's start there oh wait a minute wait a minute no verse 15 let's pick it up and when joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead they said joseph will pray adventure hate us oh no when god dumped something on the inside and when god doesn't release me from all that hurt and all that pain and all that stuff i ain't going back to it it feel good to be free when joseph's brethren saw that their father their father was dead they said joseph with her adventure hate us and will certainly require us all the evil which he which we did unto him and they sent a messenger to joseph saying thy father did command before he died saying hey they're lying they're lying so shall you say unto joseph forgive i pray thee now that the trespass of thy brethren and their sin but they did they they for they did unto the evil not now these fellows are really trying to repent they just saying it the wrong way all they need to say brother i did unto you evil not daddy said the same no no no no no i did unto you evil right it says uh for they did unto you evil and now we pray thee forgive the trespass of the servants of god of the god of thy father and joseph wept when they spake unto him see this is a man that's broken it's a man that's been changed he's crying and his brethren also went and fell down before his face and they said behold we be thy servants joseph said unto them fear not for am i in the place of god brothers y'all stop this am i in the place of god i told y'all when y'all came it wasn't y'all that put me in the pit it was god that did that am i in the place of god look at this but as for you as for you you thought of evil against me i love it but god meant it unto god to bring the past as it is this day to save much people alive now look at this now therefore feel you not i will nourish you and your little ones and he confident them and speak kindly unto them my brothers this that nothing to do you this was all god you meant it for evil all the hurt that you've been through the pain the suffering all that the agony you maybe somebody did meaning evil but god meant it for good i wanted to just take a a few moments some closing this amen today and i want to set a man in motion just some practical things for us as we you know it's one thing to talk about hurt people hurt people but it's another thing to bring healing to hurt people and this is the change the turn that we want to make today just stretch with now let's move towards healing of hurt people and i want to give you what what what what what what counselor did joseph talk to what pastor did he get to nobody was there joseph had one-on-one conversation with god and through this through his his relationship with god he was able to understand that god everything i've gone through everything that i have endured is because you wanted me to go through it you brought me into this place for such a time as this i don't like how i got here but god i'm here by your grace and i'm grateful for what you've done let's read some scriptures i want to give some scriptures to hurting people things that you can you can just you can use amen amen for yourself um jeremiah 17 14. glory to god jeremiah 17 14 this is for hurt people heal me o lord and i shall be healed save me and i shall be saved look at this i love this but thou art my praise i'm gonna tell you uh uh brother gene has told us this uh psalm 107 is where i'm getting ready to go to but uh brother gene gabold has told us this many times it says when when a husband and wife come to church and against a massive argument before church and um uh you know the husband comes in and he just praising god like crazy wife sitting there like wonder what are you doing i can't believe this so after church after church they uh they leave and you know the wife just gets to come say i can't believe you're acting like a hypocrite in that worship of god you know the big argument we just had how can you be in there acting like that i can't i can't believe he said he'd say well you know it's because um uh i was upset with you but i wasn't upset with god he didn't do nothing to me so that wasn't gonna stop my praise and that that and what jeremiah just said but thou art my praise i ain't gonna let brother stop my praise i'm gonna let sisters stop my prayers i'm gonna let husband wife children i ain't gonna let nobody that hurt me stop my praise for thou art my praise let's go to psalms 107 verse 19 psalms 107 19 then they cry unto the lord in their trouble and he saveth them out of their distresses look at this he sent his word and healed them i believe through these sermons through hurt people hurt people god has sent his word to bring healing so i heard he sent his word and healed them and healed them and delivered them from their destructions now look at verse 21 oh that man would praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men now what i don't go through don't look wonderful and when you're going through it it really don't look wonderful but oftentimes you get on the other side of it and you can say god you did a wonderful thing first thessalonians 5 and 18. we got to praise them in the midst of whatever we're going through first that's known as 5 and 18. look at this look at this and everything in everything give no give complaints tell everybody about your problems make everybody see how you are a victim know that what the bible says in everything all your hurt all your pain all your suffering and everything give thanks and you want to know what this is the will of god you want to know what the will of god is the will of god is for you to give thanks in the midst of what you're going through for this is the will of god in christ jesus concerning you now i'm gonna read your favorite scripture romans 8 28. it's your favorite one and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god sorry

has come to us to deal with us right where we are follow the truth that has been spoken to us lord bring a man healing to our hurt lord let the truth that has been spoken to us bring a release and a freedom help us to realize that uh every step that we have taken in life has been ordered of you we're not here by accident god you are involved in everything you don't allow things to happen just uh by happenstance at halfhazardly god you always have a plan you always have a purpose lord let us rest ourselves on the word of god and in the word of god may we find our soulless when we find our comfort may we find our strength may we find our peace may we find it all may we find all that we need right there in the word of god and father may we lord rather than turning and running from situations may we turn to you [Music] knowing father you god are able to see us through sometimes we have to patiently wait not get in a hurry and get ahead of you but patiently wait father for you god to to do the things that only you can do god so we just pray father that you would help us lord let your word amen have preeminence in our circumstances and in our situations and lord may we be like like joseph god he could go through and process the situation he can realize that no it wasn't my brothers that did this it wasn't my brothers that that that that that that uh caused me to have to go through these things but it was god's positioning and placing me in a spot where i could be a help to them god he realized amen what are you going through and he stopped a man uh complaining and maybe just lord just blaming everybody as he stopped being a victim he became a victor jesus this is where we want to move to today god and we can't do it without you so bring us to that place where we're no longer seeing ourselves as victims lord but we're victors we're more than conquerors through him that loved us father we love you god we praise you we thank you oh it's in jesus name that we

hurt you want to release the pain you want to release these things that may have hindered you and entered your walk with christ maybe handed your relationship with a brother a sister sometimes it hinders in families and things like that whatever it might be if you feel like maybe god's been speaking directly just lift your hand where you are i want to pray especially for you amen yes the lord
