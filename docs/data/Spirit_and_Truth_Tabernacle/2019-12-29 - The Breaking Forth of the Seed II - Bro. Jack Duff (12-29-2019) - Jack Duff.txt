always good to kind of come to this point of the year we're closer today than we ever been before to the coming of the Lord [Music] and sometimes I like to just go back and reflect and just just think about how good god has been to me throughout the year and and and I was um just wanted to encourage if some of y'all would just just take a journey back a man to maybe at the beginning of this year maybe think about where you was at the beginning the beginning of this year but look at you now amen and I mean you can you can you can put a smile on your face because you know God's been good to you praise the Lord you know God's been good to you [Music] you're not praised them for somebody else's testimony praise them for your own testimony oh yeah I was listening amen to that sermon and begin a year the year the incredible and somewhere in that sermon I made a statement and I didn't because sometimes have to remind you of things but I made a statement I said brother Josue and sister Amanda were considering a manor house for those way and introduced house in Vero Beach the sister Amanda since Amanda said a little sway a nice house but is there spirit and truth tabernacle in Vero rates to Vero Beach and she said not not just any spirit of truth tabernac is the one that brother Jack passed us because if there's no spirit of truth Tabernacle Eurobeat say I don't really want to go to Vero Beach and in that sermon at the end I said God god bless you for that statement sister man and here at the end of the year I can think I can say God has blessed you for that statement [Music] oh he's away maker he's a miracle worker he is a promise keeper [Music] I mean God's been good God's been good you know I am III I do have something that I want to share in just a couple of things but before I go too far I did want to ask this question do the the Saints brother system origami december's just Ruth a man's just a Roomba do y'all have a song I want to sing this morning okay think about it I'm making a couple of announcements but they song for us on Friday night and they just they just blessed our hearts and since you know we got more here today I'm sure y'all be blessed just to hear amen just to hear them sing this this morning they were announced in sunday-schools gonna start again on the first first Sunday of the month and just wanted to let everybody know we're who's going through the church age study if you've never had the opportunity to read the church changes a man we have a curriculum that we use in here for Sunday school and you can join us on the journey throughout the year to read the entire church age book and just kind of study if not just read it but just really study and I think it would be a real blessing so if you've never had the opportunity to do that we're doing that I actually printed out the first lesson is sitting there on the table there brother Steven or a standing and as you're leaving today and a man you can get the lesson these lessons will have the page for original church age book as well as the new church age book one is called the Blue Book One career but they both charge eight books but the pages are laid out differently but we have the pages on these studies so if you desire to join us on that journey Amen for next year it'll be a real blessing we're starting off the year amen for our first lesson and you can read the the lesson there as well as read the pages that we'll be studying for next week for a Sunday school and you just be able to get right in the beginning amen of that so keep that in mind don't forget brother smiley be coming to speak for us on New Year's Eve night service will start at nine o'clock we will have a time of Prayer or our prayer before we actually go into the service

praise the Lord keep pressing on everybody hey man we certainly appreciate that that wonderful song on today musicians thank y'all so much I really appreciate you all the specials that we're saying this morning we're a grateful man for those songs as well certainly appreciate the Lord Jesus I believe this is a sister is this kind of quick-connect wa koneko okay god bless you sister koneko is so good to have you and man with us on today we put on the business cards who you invited by I should say the Holy Spirit and fight it I know God don't make mistakes a man God is God is perfect and all that he does so I want to just read a man maybe two scriptures this morning and we kind of got started and they thought a few weeks ago and I'm this priest portion of it then I said I want to come back because I got a few more things that I want to share and so I want to just maybe go into that a little bit more today if you just turn with me to mark chapter 4 my man mark chapter 4 starting here at verse wide and man says and it began to teach by the seaside and there was gathered unto him a great multitude so that he entered into a ship and sent in the sea and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land that taught them many things by parables and said unto them in his doctrine hearken behold they went out a sower to Seoul by this is really something so this was verse 2 says he taught unto them in his doctrine so this was very important words that Jesus was sharing right so verse 3 says hark and behold there went out a so worth to Seoul and it came to pass as he sowed some fell by the wayside the fowls of the air came and devoured it up some fell on stony ground where it had not much earth and immediately it sprang up because it had no death of Earth and you know we wanna we want to watch this parable very closely you know the even even when the fowls came and devoured the seed that was sown it does not mean that the seed did not have an opportunity to grow hallelujah the reason for that is because when the bird eats it it passes through the bird the birds system and the bird has to let it go again there's just some seeds grow through stuff sometimes have to just come through some stuff but it does not stop the growth amen all right verse verse five again some fell on stony ground where it had not much earth and immediately it sprang up so now even when it was on stony ground it was still growing right because it had no depth of it didn't have much earth so there was conditions but it did grow for a little bit now it did grow for a little bit I don't want to just have a little bit of growth amen I want full potential praise God a man verse verse six says but when the Sun was up it was scorched and because it had no root it withered away right a menace conditions for not being rooted alright a man and some fell among thorns and the thorns grew up now for the thorns to grow up the seed that was actually amongst the thorns was also growing they were both experiencing growth hallelujah catch that now so they're both experiencing growth the problem is a man said some fell on thorns and the thorns grew up and choked did and it yielded no fruit because it was growing amongst thorns it got choked out hallelujah yielded no fruit and an other fell on good ground and dear yield fruit that sprang up and increased and brought forth some 30 some 60 and some 100 and we said unto them he that hath ears to hear let here alright let's leave that one there and then we'll probably come back and pick it up in a little bit but let's turn over to Genesis 1 verse 11 here in Genesis 1 praise the Lord from the very beginning God was concerned about this process a man Genesis 1 in verse 11 says and God said let the earth bring forth grass leather yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind a man whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so and the earth brought forth grass an herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and God saw that it was good and the evening and the morning were the third day amen let's pray over what we have read father we are so appreciative of the word of the Lord we pray father the Holy Ghost would make things clear to us as we just embarked upon this thought thank you for the anointing that has been in the service through the worship and the specials and everything that has happened Lord we're going into a new year encourage we're going into new year strengthen looking a man back over the year and all of the various tests and trials but yet we're still standing in the house of God and a man willing to give God praise and honor and glory shows that we got the victory no matter what it is that we face so father we thank you for the incredible things that you've done and we know that Lord is just a continuation a man that we will flow into and and our confidence and our hope and our faith is in you we just trust you God and as we enter this thought Lord how it's to take this Lord and build a Punnett that you might get glory and honor out of our lives it's in Jesus name we pray amen they man god bless you can be seated praise the Lord so we want to just continue our journey amen on the breaking forth of the seat amen the breaking forth of the seat and I want to just sum we talked about this a little bit a few weeks ago but I want to just hit a few things and then I will go forward I won't read all of this a man so don't worry about pulling this close up but I'll just tell you where they are this message changed with God brother Branham makes a statement says Jesus said the word is a seed that a source source sold and a seed if it's Germa ties if it's a Dermott AR the sun and moisture will bring forth the life that's in the seed right and here's the thing we gotta get the seed amen under right conditions a both Sun and moisture oh come on somebody a man as I look around I see a bunch of seeds in here I see seeds all over the place and in order to get the seed to come forth what God put in it before the seed amen was created alright what God puts something in that seed and in order to get that seed to express what God put in it we must get the seed a man in there under the right conditions of the Sun and moisture hallelujah if I could just a man just go a little further he says it will bring forth the life that's in the seed all right now another little statement that he makes he says the Bible said that God is in the world and this is the message investments just a quick statement the Bible said that God is in the world he is the word and if the word in you it produces God again hallelujah if the word is in you it produces God again and I an order for to produce God again we must put it under the right conditions Amen of Sun and moisture Oh church I hope we get this amen what is it what God placed in you when it's put in the right condition it will bring forth God again hallelujah glory to God amen it will bring it will produce God again this is this is what he tells us now I want to pull this one up this is out of that the seat shall not be heir with the shuk Amen the Prophet makes this statement and this is where we get our thought from about the breaking forth of the sea amen it says in the message the sea should not be here with a shut it says but now we're standing at the time of the seat now we're spending at the time of the seat now the sea will hold I'm going to tell you to I tell you the truth amen win it win it when a flower is going through winter everything in the flower dies right era it's only one thing in the flower that does not die right but the leaves will come off right amen you know you won't even see anymore the still right roots and everything else right on it seem like everything of that flower died but but before the flower actually enters into a winter season I hope y'all stay with me I said it for what i'ma say it again before the our interest into winter season the flower always trots a seed that's why the Prophet said the sea will hold because the Amen so when it goes to winter season it drops even though everything else was there it dropped that see you might not even be able to find the seed the scene actually freezes winter will freeze the sea but when the Sun began to come out well in the springtime amen it begins to melt the four songs around the sea somebody's in winter season right now but don't worry after winter it's a law of God after winter you've gotta go through spring rains cold and I'm looking forward to spring season some season get ready to come fall hallelujah all glory to God that's see me by going into the earth that winter before went to buy that seed being dropped in the earth what happens in spring is that we don't see a different flower we actually see the same flower and the process repeats itself because there's a low and where is the law the law is found inside the scene [Applause] it is the smallest part of this whole process but there's a lot of guts there and it's gonna reproduce yourself over and over and over again let me read this this quote here my god I love this hey Manny Manny man they may say not a seat will hold the seed will hold a man what support cooperate with the seed holding it it was set there for that purpose to hold it Amen because as the Sun comes up in the early spring upon the wheat watch the whole nature through the season roll through the day roll everything rolled just perfectly right with God amen can I say that again everything rolled just perfectly right with God ain't nothing out of Cana nothing out of cater amen all things are working together for your good because you're called according to his purpose glory to God says everything roll just perfectly right with God now when that warm Sun begins to shine upon the seat it breaks forth and that's where we get the breaking amen forth of the sea when the warm Sun begins to shine upon the seat it breaks forth hallelujah amen it says but the world has to be in a certain position to make that sea break forth out of the dirt I like that the world and if I could just put it this way your world your world has to be in a certain position in order to make the seed break for hallelujah and see this is this is a thing you don't even have a choice in this right if God has equipped you with a particular seed then it's got to come forth if we can get it under the right conditions give the right amount of Sun on the right all right right amount of moisture it will break forth you can't even stop it I don't know if we get that I don't care how hard you try you can't even stop this from happening the reason you can't stop it cuz God place the law in the sea oh god help us Jesus the world has to be in a certain position to make that seed break forth out of the dirt it has to come around this away and get it a certain position to make that seed come forth it had to come that way to get it up out of the Dark Age now I'll come back to that hopefully in a little bit but you know I was talking to a man about this and and and and I and I went just did a little study on these seeds I had to go to a little children's website called cool kid facts a man I mean you want to understand these things and sometimes if you just look at it look at it from a child's perspective it begin to make a little bit more sense to you amen but as I was studying on this little website I found something out about a seed say inside a seat is an embryo inside the seat right this little I mean my sort the seat is so small but inside of it you can't see it but there's an embryo and and what the embryo is it's a tiny plant in the sea and the endosperm which a small leaves which feed the embryo so it's got this the endosperm the leaves and everything all inside say the outside of the seat has a coat and it acts as protection for the embryo to make sure it's safe halleluyah halleluyah stay with me the embryo is safely stored inside the coat now you don't see that amen the embryo is simply stored inside the coat waiting for the perfect time to begin terminating the embryo is inside the coat it's just waiting for the perfect time to begin germinating glory to God and that means it's going to start growing hallelujah when the seed begins to Germany it's starting to grow hallelujah glory to God and see what's happened is that that that little place that's on the inside cannot remain on the inside will it start germinating the little plants out and this ain't gonna be enough for me and the more it absorbs moisture and the more it absorbs the Sun all of a sudden before you know what's on the inside as he begins to sprout out now you still don't know what kind of seed it is but it's going through a process of growing a man church hallelujah events that see will reach maturity glory to God and that's what we expected from some of God's people to reach a place of maturity and God when we reach maturity and we shall look like Jesus we should talk like Jesus we should act like Jesus but I want you to understand the potential Center a man for you to look like Jesus and act like Jesus and talk like those potentials are already laying inside of you we just need to put you under condition in the right situation and did it express itself spoken one is already in you Amen the spoken word Paulo is already laying inside of you but once you come into the right condition it will express itself Oh search Oh sir stay with me here I'll tell you glory to God I thank God for this it says it says I'm distance the website says the embryo safely stored inside the coat waiting for the perfect time to begin germinating which means that it starts growing glory to God now you know why that thing is growing inside the seeds you can't see it you know and I was saying this before you know you look at people and you don't even really you don't know what's going on the inside of them you look at the outside and I don't see nothing now if it's a seat a man there then just give it time it's waiting for the perfect time to start manifesting itself glory to God glory to God look you says this discuss this this website that the seed needs the right conditions to germinate and they may have to wait for years before those conditions are right it needs the right conditions and it may have to wait for years and do you realize why you're waiting for years you might get discouraged you might think that this has never produced anything and you might get a man tempted to go dig it up no don't dig it up commit it to the earth and what's at the right time when the conditions are just right watch it come forth Amen God knows the conditions we might not know the conditions there you know there it's there you know I know I know that there's a they say everybody to go to jail get jailhouse religion say everybody go but you know some people really get touch with God when they go through a situation like that some people be flat on their back in the hospital before they actually begin to give God their attention the condition has to be right the situation has to be right the sea will come for Oh glory glory glory our trials put us in condition our trials position us for for the Sun they hit us just right oh I don't know if we hit it I don't know if we're here but the Sun will hit us just right and you know what let me keep going here I got it now I don't want to get ahead of myself a man sees need the right condition to germinate and they might have to wait four years before the conditions are right sometimes we might think they're dead it's just waiting on the right condition listen some seed needs light to germinate and others need darkness some will germinate or they'll start growing in light but others will grow in darkness hallelujah oh my you know I gotta keep going but all seas need moisture all seas need moisture oxygen and the right temperature to Germany now let it look look at this the statement that they may hear that just bless me seeds need to pass through the process called Scarah fication all seeds must go through a process called Scarah fication and this means that the hard C coat changes the outer shell of the seat begins to change and the reason that the outer shell is changing is that it allows moisture to enter into the embryo you know how some people be so hard they don't want nothing to do with God they so tough on the outside but when the conditions change brother let me tell you something your condition will change system your condition will change if you belong to God it is impossible for God to lose you all that the father has given me will come that's his promise so he has allowed a situation to change a lost job my culture situation to change a lost car might coach your situation to change there are many things that can happen to you in your life that will cause your situation to change sometimes losing a loved one causes your situation to change it actually takes our hard-shell where people can talk to you before they can say nothing to you before now all of us say you just open up lose this a little bit and you know one word strike that seat things begin to change look at this Scarah fication a man is when the heart Seco changes to allow moisture to get in they said now scarification happens naturally in a number of ways now listen to this for example scarification can happen through freezing temperatures so remember I just said that you know see drops right before winter that seed actually freezes so scared for keishon it's happening and it's going to actually produce growth watch this Scarah fication can happen through freezing temperatures temperatures also scare fication happens when a seed passes through the digestive tract of an animal hallelujah amen that's why I say when when Jesus spoke about the fowls you know the fowl may take it and run off with it but that same see can be replanted because it went through the digestive tract of the animal and now it can't bring forth you just might have to go you know go through some stuff but it is still bring forth yeah look listen it's in the ghazal says once the conditions are right the plant starts the plant inside starts to grow and get bigger it pushes open the Seco a bit like a chick hatching out of an egg tiny leaves appear and they push out of the soil brother I'm looking for some stuff to push out next year even if it's a tiny leaf praise for the tiny me full of rain just let me see the the cloud the size of a man's hand that's enough for me to begin to tell everybody it's gonna rain please God I know it's gonna grow to full maturity just a little bit it's the breaking forth of the seat just a little bit just a little bit let me go on with this I love this this quote here I am the resurrection of life brother Branham who makes a statement that just goes right along what we just read from this website the man he says now God has a funeral procession for the flower seem strange says but the little seed is laying on the ground then the fall rain comes now can you imagine nah nah y'all got to catch this the the seed dropped from the flower before winter and the seed actually just nobody planted it it just laid on the ground it just laid on the ground it says then the fall rain come oh can I can I just I just I want to break into these things you know because the the the bird could actually take the seat and take off somewhere else stay with me the bird could take the seat from this place right here and take off somewhere else and when it releases an out of his digestive tract it's gonna grow where it is planning Oh hallelujah you might end up in a whole nother country but you'll start growing because there was a love inside the sea so you win it when it's planted right in a spot producing hallelujah watch this watch this he says mine says he says the little seed is laying on the ground then the fall rains come like tears dropping from the sky and pass down upon this little seed until it buries it so the rain is actually coming to do what bury it the Holy Spirit rain comes to burial seat nobody else planted it nobody touched it but when the Holy Spirit rain comes it buries your seat Oh God is so smart listen listen it says and along comes the cold winter now the petals are gone and then the stock is cold the bowl in the ground the roots is dried up says oh the sea when the winter freeze it freezes the sea it burns the seat open the Pope runs out look now we get a loan February March there's no pedal no stop no snow signal Pablo nothing is that the end of that flower can see when you're looking at people and they went to see so you might think they've all washed up but I got good news that's not the end of the flower hey we get ready see some some saw some of God's radiance that's what brother Jerry told us we are that we're the radiance of God but we got to go through our seasons before we can radiate hallelujah listen it's at the end of the flower not by no means there is a little charm of life somewhere within that seat that you might give the dirt in your hands and take it to the laboratory and let the scientists examine it back and forth and he'll never find that Jermel life God hid it I love this church that the scientists may never find it Amen by God hate it and see sometimes when you're going through various trials folk will give up on your folk will quit on you right folk will say will write you off amen because they think they have you underneath their their microscope they can't see nothing amen they can't see anything so they just give up on you but God hate it God hid it glory but just as soon as the world rocks around in the solar system until it gets around to where the Sun begins to strike the earth became you cannot have that life brother when the asteroid strikes it you can't hide it you can't stop him from coming to church they might have been due season you may see him nowhere around but all of a sudden the sea begins to show where was inside it can't stop praising God it can't stop worship Him I got to get to church Friday night Wednesday night send me more I want to be in the house of God something is structure.c glory I believe this search I believe this and I'm preaching it because it's what I'm looking for look at this if you lay a concrete walk down through your yard on top of the grass where the next summer where is the most grass set it says right around the size of the walk a man says why it's that light that was laying beneath that concrete and when it comes springtime though a rock lean on it oh Jesus because some spare me and see my the devil got us just mash down with this sin with we got our counter stuff laying though a rocket sleigh on it though trouble surrounds it though our Rockets laying on it hallelujah glory to God it sets a rock laying on it it will not hide it you know that's the best best accident thickest grass and the strongest grass that's growing underneath the rock even when you cut off the edges you still ain't got to the roots and since you ain't get to the roots guess what's gonna happen it'll come right back praise God this is a losing battle that you're fighting oh Jesus I've ceased I just I need the devil to know that saying you might have put some people on the rock thought you had them buried but because the s/o in a striking underneath the rock they gonna come back stronger than before oh when it comes to springtime throw a rock laying on it it was not hot it the light will weed its way right through that's what makes so much grass around the edge of the wall you cannot hide life it has to come up because God has put the the Sun s you in over this the Botany life and it controls Botany life alright I thank God for that now I've got a couple other things that I just want to share here this next one out of wisdom versus faith wisdom versus faith oh Jesus and and now when we talk about this we can we can see this in the natural but I'm leaning more a man towards the spiritual this morning because this see we're talking about the seed of God that's laying on the inside of believers and sometimes when we're going through rocky situations in life or whatever it is it look like we're we're hopeless we're helpless but if there's a seed there if you put it in the right conditions it's gonna sprout it's gonna come forth a man no matter no matter I mean as long as the soil is right the Sun is right the moisture is right it will come forth hallelujah it will be everything that God predestinated it to be a man church now I made this statement before and and let me just get this again hallelujah brother Branham made a statement the word the word because there's a word see in you glory to God that word can not come forth or cannot grow in denominations it can't grow I want to say that again amen if you've ever tried it to go to denominational Church because of what's on the inside of you you cannot digest what they're serving hallelujah you can't agree with what they're serving amen your experience only goes so far in a denominational Church but if you're ever gonna be like Jesus you're ever gonna talk and walk like Jesus you will never get there by going to the nomination Church hallelujah glory to God and see God amen we will read this and say the word is a seed and when the when the scriptures say that the word is a seat well the word was god hallelujah the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us so we were talking about the word as a seed we said that is God Himself in that seat and when God produces amen another seed that means God producing himself hallelujah if you were made in his image if you came just like apple has to produce apples God produces God all this producers are just bananas producers in the bananas God produces God and if you already see the God that you must produce God nothing short of it it must look like God it must like God [Applause] what you think isn't in God see himself a man the same thing you see the apple tree you I'll be expected of seeing yourself as a son of God and a supporter of God hallelujah let me let me a word the word cannot grow in denominations Amen brother branham say go seize of the Bible cannot grow in the atmosphere of wisdom Holy Ghost sees of the Bible cannot grow in the atmosphere of wisdom what we need is faith hallelujah it'll grow in an atmosphere of faith but not an atmosphere of wisdom let me go amen let me read this this little statement here from wisdom versus faith says how could a lily live amen a lily seed seed seed live and grow when it thrives on waters grow in one of those dusty denominations he says how could it do it when it thrives on water water is a spirit they have a form of godliness but they're neither power of the Spirit amen see though the word falls on them it can't grow hallelujah and if you just notice anybody that's ever come in contact with this message I wanna I'm gonna say 100% but probably well over 90% they'll leave the message and they'll go to the denominational Church but they can't stay in the church that they go to they get out of that church and go to another church they get out of that church and go to another church they can't stay in those conditions that there's a reason why because that seed that's on the inside of them will not grow under those conditions we're trying to get everybody in the right condition sitting in the right atmosphere then we'll see what's inside of there then the sson can strike it with water with moisture and we'll see God produce God himself again look at this Pro look at what it says amen they have a form of guns but deny the power of the Spirit see though the word falls on them it can't grow it can't grow just like the word was on Eve but it couldn't grow just like the word was on Eve but it couldn't grow it says why accepted wisdom Satan's wisdom the work comes to them the word falls upon them sure it does a man growth in a fall of them they can hear the word preach but the issues they'll never grow they'll never grow hallelujah hallelu if you want to come a man into a full statue of a perfect man you got to get somewhere where they preaching that look at this hallelujah I want to just go back to this scripture and mark for now Jesus gave the parable of these different grounds and as I was sharing with you amen there are that the see was growing it certainly looked like it was growing Amen in these conditions but it just it it didn't have anything to keep it glory to God went when the trials came it didn't have anything to keep it glory to God a man and and and we want to make sure that we're on good ground that this seed is growing on good ground I'd rather bring 434 or something then bring forth nothing at all right so when it's on good ground there it will increase and it will produce something some 30 some 60 some 100 now my goal is 100 I want maximum potential hallelujah well I settle for half way I want maximum potential if that's what God has for me that's what I want maximum I want to maximize my opportunities with God hallelujah now Jesus gives a man some clarification let's go to mark 4 and verse 10 Amen for the sake of time glory to God we'll just kind of pick it up right there it says and when he was alone they that were about him with the twelve acts of him the parable it says and he said unto them unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God but unto them that without all these things are done in parables that singing they may see and not perceive and hearing they may hear and not understand lest at any time they should be converted and their sins should be forgiven them he goes on he says and he said unto them know ye not despair about and how then when you know all parables the sower soweth the word now remember the word is God the Word was God the Word was with God and the Word was made flesh amen in 12 months so the word is godless this seed is God being sung hallelujah the sower soweth the word and these are they by the way sides where the word is sown but when they have heard Satan cometh immediately so can I tell you all that before you when you get out the church Satan gonna be right there but try to take this from you but we're gonna find out who we are right look at look at what happened these I'd say that by the weight site where the word is sown but when they have heard Satan cometh immediately and taketh away the word that was sown in a hearse now that's something to me well just catch what Jesus just said Satan come not you it was a fight for you to get to church you abide wrestling with the devil and you want you you want and you get here to the church and you hear the word of God and then you go outside and the Bible says that Satan come immediately he don't even ask you to give it up you don't even wrestle with you this time the Bible tells us that he comes immediately and takes it away now I'm bringing it up for a reason I'm bringing up that point for a reason I want you to realize you have to fight to keep what you got the kingdom of God suffers violence and the violent will take it by force rather don't let the devil take nothing from you if God gave it to you it has become your personal property Satan you can have nothing this is my this is my promise this word God said to me he must speak it to you spoke to me and I refuse to let you take this from me you don't have to fight to hold on the what God gave you praise God them children below me you we're gonna have to fight the hold on for please God Church tell the devil no no no no no no glory to God hallelujah oh Jesus Jesus look at what the scripture is telling us here st. us I mean I just refuse to just allow them just coming in just no no no you're taking nothing nothing that God gave me nothing you cannot have it if I have to fight on my knees I'll fight on my knees and until that seat gets into the right place hallelujah see that you know what is the scripture Seder that promises unto you and to your children those that are far off as many as the Lord our God shall come that's what that's what the words say so we're if you got a promise like that you don't you don't you don't wrestle with no devil plants in the world put it for six but put that script in an envelope and send it on off the way now let me ask you a question when you send packages out do you do you chase them down to track them do you follow the mail truck to see where were you at with the package you don't do stuff like that you might log into your computer and just find out or kiss here is here is here and that's based on based on what information you get from the computer if there's a problem you know exactly where to go look based on what I just saw online it's here somebody better find my package here right I noticed I know it's there I had one lost in a man and they trying to tell me and I know no no the computer say it's right here in this facility it's right here say no sir you know that they think they forgot to update the computer and and it's all the way up to something no no no no no that's not what your computer say it says here and I'm not leaving here until I find it hallelujah I had something to stand on and I stay right there next to her they come to find her oh yeah it was back there in this look Conan then Tom the computer said it was here bring me my package [Applause] brother amen and you can you can stand toe-to-toe with the devil and say God says this God gave me this promise I'm reading it right here bring me my package bring me my son bring me my daughter bring me my mama bring me my daddy bring me my brother bring me my sister God said it's here bring me my package please Jesus blow a hallelujah we got to take anything and everything from the devil we know by revelation who where we stand search a man a man's watch this now watch the scripture it says verse 13 and these are they by the wayside where the word is sown but when they have heard Satan cometh immediately and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts so fight to keep you cease now fight to keep your promises and these are they so many hearts all right and these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground who when they have heard the word immediately receive it with gladness now I don't want to just sit here in church and say amen to the word but not having a root because look at what happens in verse 17 and have no root in them oh you got to have your own root now you got to be planted somewhere this ain't the pastor giving you your root you got to have your own root you got to make your own decision you got to know what sort of the planet in have no root in themselves and so endure but for a time when but I fought for time afterward when affliction or persecution Arase for the word seat now the persecution come against the word that's in you now brother branham say you know when when Mary was pregnant with Christ a man with when she received the word from the angel and now she's about to amen I give birth to Christ he said that's when the persecution set in that's when they changed the laws that's when they caused them to leave Leave leave Leave leave Leave leave Galilee and go back to Nazareth hallelujah it's when the word was actually on the inside the persecution set in can I tell you something when you see the enemy coming like a flirt maybe something he's coming after something that's on the inside of you and notice gonna go fight this battle for you you gonna have to fight to keep this amen God promised that God gave you hallelujah church fight for on your knees whatever you got to do fight till you get what God promised you when the persecution arose the Bible say fought for the word sing cuz that's what you're gonna get attacked for the worst thing many of y'all I could tell you I mean some of us have given up we got discouraged because people attacked us for the words sake let me just work with that let me just work with that a man maybe because of sister the way you have to dress as a Christian people will attack you for the word sink hallelujah brother when you going to the basketball court and not wearing shorts they will attack you for the word sink and sometimes what happens that you get tired of somebody telling you that you looked old-fashioned you look this you get tired of them saying making them kind of slack it's about you so brother work but I meant before you know it you don't let down your standards you want to throw a little finger for fingernail polish hallelujah hey man you get your skirt a little tighter a little shorter amen you're trying to do something you've been attacked for the words sake and you give it into the attack but I want to encourage it don't give in stain when haven't done older span stay glory maybe somebody that's you know the reason your kids going through this it's because you will let them do this and you will let them do that know you've been attacked for the Lord's sake and we're being attacked you keep standing no matter what the reason my Charlie's in jail is because I took a stand wish him it could be worse than what it is so I praise God for what I got [Applause] hallelujah don't get don't let this tender town for the word sing with people come against you for the Lord sing hallelujah glory to God you know some of us are going through some of the things we're going through because we let down for the word sing if we would have held a stand everybody got a hold it high not just a pastor oh brother Randall said we had a church where we didn't believe in planting carts everybody ought to go home and throw away date cards a man Church that's what he's saying we all got to uphold the standard of the word the devil will come immediately and bring affliction or persecution for the words sake and know what the Bible says and I have no room a man in themselves and so and do it before time after when affliction or persecution arises for the words sake immediately they are offended don't be offended for the word stand for the word and if Jesus had to go through some persecution for his beliefs you have to go through some for yours as well hey man there being a Christian is not a picnic it is a war brother we didn't some some people get into a military just to look good with a uniform but other people get in because they want to go to role they'll fight for their freedoms not only fight for theirs in fact for yours too glory to God a man I'm fighting for your freedom in Christ all right listen listen he says in verse 18 and these are they which are sown among thorns such as here the world and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches now why would Jesus say deceitfulness of riches anybody has been living long enough knows that the devil always got something he got another scheme brother if he can't get you with wit juice wee-wee I guarantee we got some a ton so some Amway or Amway didn't work they start selling juice when the juice didn't work then they went to supplement aloe vera right they went from there to something that everybody selling something the devil constantly got you going after something i'ma tell you if you just whittled God he'll bring it to you you won't have to go for it he'll bring it to you if you just do what he asked you to do I'm a living witness a man a man a man I'm a living witness hallelujah amen III I'm driving a truck that I didn't even go to buy didn't even go out there to buy it well I went out there for somebody else I'm out here doing them a favor and and it just so happened that very day I go it's a very day that they put it out there I'm like well it didn't even have a price on it like what y'all asking for that they told me I said hey what I want to pay in my head I said how much I wanted to pay and next thing you know I'm telling the brother brother brother say how much you wanted to pay for that that's what I wanted to pay okay I'm gonna try to get them to include your truck in my deal you are okay and he went out and did it that way God will bring you your desire if you just serve Him don't be chasing riches you know the reasoning used to see Pizitz of riches because you taste and you never actually accomplish you know what you can actually get it and by the time you get it you gotta spin it like that don't chase it let God bring it to you listen listen I'm trying to go forward since and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word the less of other things entering in choke the word and it becometh unfruitful see we're trying what kind of ground you are you because I'm gonna just be honest with you when Jesus gave us these full different examples all of us fit within these four categories which which ground are you first win is the ground that I want to be and these are they which are sown on good ground brother branham call it pre-prepared ground predestinated ground amen these are they which are sown on good ground such as hear the word not only hear it what they do and receive it and by hearing it and receiving it something happens and bring forth fruit some thirtyfold some 16 and some a hundred church I want to be the one that's bringing forth 100 fold I wanted everything everything God everything God is I want to be can I give you just another quote here all Jesus glory to God this is out of the message recognizing your day and its message and as a message just in the title recognizing your Danis message says look look what he said in this day would take place listen to it real close the sign of Sodom would take place in the day sound like Abraham the day before Sodom that was called out all these things that was prophesied will be taking place now watch the day you're living we've we've went over it and over it notice he has promised to send you heavenly light he has promised to send you heavenly light we need something to shine on this right because we get it in the right condition it will grow many of us already tried denominations we did not grow there but brother when this found us because we didn't find this but when this found us that's when we started to grow that's when the Bible became a new pole this is now I promised to send you heavenly light to ripen the word seat that would be sown for this day the seed is here the seed is the Bible why Jesus says so the word is the seed that a so assault says and now before you can have any crop no matter if you sow the seed if you've got to have I said say it's got to have light to ripen that seed or it'll rot it won't do no good it'll perish but if they if it's got if it's got seed in the ground the right ground with the right kind of a sunlight on it it's got to write them listen and he promised that in the last days in the evening time the Sun would come out to ripen that seed the seed is being preached the Son of God is ripening that sea by vindicating it making it push out before you and proving that it's right do you get it recognize your day a man let's go on a little further here now I wanna show you that a seed has just been in the right condition for the Esso in the strike it and for it to come forth and build random called it pre-prepared ground in my thoughts go back to the woman at the well we don't know her name but we know her situation and she's just given a title woman at the will but the Bible tells us that Jesus said you know I have need to go by Samaria Jesus said I hadn't need to go by and there was a certain time of day that Jesus was coming and when it got there he you know he sent the disciples away and because according to his vision this woman would be there by herself and and nobody else needed to be there so he sent the disciples amen on an errand to go get some vittles hallelujah glory to God and hear this woman come to the well and and Jesus just begin to have a conversation now the time of day that she came to the well she had to come with all the other women I mean she couldn't come with the other woman because of the type of woman she was by being a prostitute she could hang out with the other ladies so they came early November morning by here she come they come before the Sun actually a menace it's up and shining real hot but she comes at the middle of the day when the sun is shining at its hottest but you know what by her coming at that time she was in the right position for the S o n to strike her seat now brother Branham said Amen on the outside and looked like this lady was dark but on the inside she had she sang she had some life there she just needed there so in the strike it hold so she was sitting myself at the Whelan and Jesus beginning to have a conversation woman bring me a drink she said ah it's not customary for your people to talk with my people and for us to have fellowship like this it's not customary he'd say well if you really knew who you were talking to you would actually ask me for a drink because because the drink that I have amen it will flow like wells of living water amen out of your I'll be out of your innermost being it'll be like wells of living water just say well what kind of drink is this should say now you don't even have anything to draw out of the will and she said oh well is deep you ain't got nothing to draw how do well how are you gonna give me some water she just began to talk and and have this conversation and then and before your north Jack's Jesus or the questions sir give me this water that you're talking about they say well now before I can give you the water and this right we got to get ourselves in the right condition amen before we don't see some growth maybe we got to do what this lady did repent they begin to talk jesus said now now now Ya Allah I'll give you this water I got this water for you amen but but we don't need to settle the same question first he didn't say like that he just said before you get this water go get your husband and then come and I get something to drink with your husband and then she finally say sir I have no husband and then Jesus with a little father say yeah and the one you living with the one you living with the one who make him your beau with is not your husband is that what he said so that's not your husband pretty much what he said you should be living there in the first place hallelujah he say say the one you living with is not your husband he said I'm not wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute you know the they told us that when Messiah come no you know what when were people looking for Messiah just for the miracle part but we're Messiah come he don't just do miracles when Messiah come he deserves scene when Messiah come these are the things that he does in the age when Messiah come he would do these things she say he say you know the one you're talking to he is the Messiah what she is something that's truck on the inside she halle-loo she went through a little scare fication process and when they're so instruct what was on the inside after she had got rid of the same question after she settled the same question did she could take over a little city and start running and say come see a man that's told me two things that I done [Applause] [Music] and I'm gonna tell you something the reason that them people could listen to her testimony because evidently when she come in contact with Christ something change ain't no way to come see a man you inviting us to come see a man nobody coming to see no man you see and honey evidently something changed when she come in contact with Christ and what we need see see see the before before that seek and break forth it was there all the time darkness had it all messed up the life she was living had it all messed up but she just had to get into the right position Oh God I want me to just get in the right position and when she got in the right position s o n reveal her sin and that was light striking her seat so if God was to come today and reveal your sin that's like striking your seat because God don't want you walking in that darkness I can I can almost assure you when the seen in her life broke forth that man got a hug guy at her house you see the one or two things either she left oh he left you don't go back to the same condition you run from that you you get out of that situation as fast as mine why if you don't that is the devil coming immediately to take what has been soul and you find yourself just going through mine better after mine but the devil just took our your strength from more than one service that's what when you leave serves you gotta make good decisions separate yourself from seeing not only separated from yourself from sin separate yourself from anything that looked like seeing you man Church we talk about trauma we want to see the see a man come to full maturity my chest not just a shout on Sunday and then you bite right back into what you was in no no we looking for more than that now I can tell you that some churches down the way they'll be happy to have you come and shout on Sunday and live any kind of way the rest of the week but not here right here we all got to come to maturity hear that woman with her sinful condition simply just had to get into the right position for the Esso end to strike a seat let me go a little further oh my mind let me read this side of the message taking sides with Jesus says that see was laying there the only thing that it needed was water and the water had fell on it all they needed was water and the water fell on when it fell upon those Pharisees they said s Beelzebub couldn't bring nothing there was nothing there but we used to come from them to come from says but when that pedestrian see struck that water of life she said sir you must be a prophet I know that when the Messiah cometh he would tell us these things he said I'm he that speaks to you she left that water pot amen and into the city she had something to tell she said come see a man who has told me that things I've done isn't this the very Messiah see she took sides with Jesus that's right strange thing wasn't it all the Pharisees and Sadducees didn't know him and this prostitute know him see why those who believed him and loved him and seen his signs they no that was the Cylon Messiah there's no getting around it they knowed it the other thing that I just want to bring out before we would try to find a way to get out bear with me I just want to read this quote spoken words the original see part 2 I'll read paragraph 399 on this paragraph 399 now stay with me here it says oh here we're gonna get in get in something deep now says now watch this see Church this real church you all have that when I give you the date it's spoken word is the original see part 2 6 - 2 - 0 3 1 8 ok in paragraph 399 yes is it I think that's I think that's part that's the spoken words originally that's part one let me see something here I want to make sure we get this do me do me a favor and just I don't know why the date didn't come out right there put in put in a search for real true sperm just put it in that and it should bring up this quote real true sperm here we go so here we're going to get in something deep now now watch this see Church this real church with the real true sperm notice the eunuch had been with all the Dedes now remember and this is important because he's talking about the unit that went down to into Israel and you know he went there for the Passover and everything but he didn't he didn't get anything but ritual this this this this were in order to produce Christ it will never come through denomination it'll never come through wisdom it's gonna be by faith amen and some humble waiting that God gonna do things look says now remember God never committed his preaching and his gospel to an angel how many knows that how many rows that Galatians 1/8 said if an angel come from heaven and preached something else beside besides they had preached let it be a curse so the angel is wrong if he's different from the word glory God came on down below angels and committed it to man which were sons you believe that now watch now he never committed it to angels notice he did not do it now now the power of the believing Church Christ oh man I'm sorry I skipped something I got my I got my quotes messed up here let me um let me I'll go go to paragraph 388 in that same same same message but I want to just try to get something here to you amen it wasn't given to angels and there's a reason a man that wasn't given to angels God gave the word to man to preach God gave the word to mean to preach accidents another quote where brother and say God did not ordain a tape recorder to preach the gospel God did not ordain a CD player to preach the gospel God did not Oh Dana mp3 player to preach the gospel yes we can hear the gospel but it was not ordained by God to preach the gospel hallelujah now listen say there's a reason why Amen God ordained men to do this hallelujah for some reason that is not okay yes that's it since now the power of the believe in church Christ has all power in heavens and earth you believe that now what if he is in you what if Christ is in you listen oh my has Christ got all power he is the C word in his body and he in us becomes a C word in us hallelujah he is the C word in his body and he and house becomes a C word in us what all that God was he poured into Christ and all Christ was was poured into the church that's the power Nitori we're not waiting for if the seed is there the power is already in it you know every apple that is going to be produced from that apple tree was inside the seeds while it was in seed form amen every miracle that will be performed by you it's already in you in C form but it must come forth to maturity getting in the right situation watch the excellence track it see what comes forward I've already Amen I can't go but I got testimony after testimony after testimony I can share with you but just being in the right position we're spoken word just comes out just like that just take being in the right position and you can put yourself in that position God just put you there I've had multiple multiple people here and in positions where they stopped bringing now the only way you're gonna stop praying it had to be raining ain't no sister and you can't stop raining it's and it's not raining the situation has to be right right and it wasn't that they stopped it just to stop it they had a need this is the only time imma be able to get this thing done and I can't get it done in the ring god I got a beat and as sons of God speak to the rain in the rain stop all right let me go a little further I want to just get this in if I can god help us it says and he and us becomes a worse eating us what all that God was he poured into Christ and all Christ was was poured into the church Nestor power now watch remember God's law of reproduction now remember after its kind that's right the seed of Christ the word must come through his body look at what he said hahahahaha the word must come through his body are you getting tired he says alright just a minute now let's just so quiet and pray I want to give this in real good I want this to grind down the seed of Christ must M UST must come through his body not through a denomination but through a born-again seed of the word it must come through now remember what is it Christ see how does my see come through the body how does the apple trees apple tree see come through the body see this through the body and the church is the body of Christ that's right the Bible Church the birth disparate produces that's the new birth himself embody his church is His Word so that people can see the confirmation of Hebrews 13:8 hallelujah we're not just carrying it just to be carrying it people need to see Amen a reproduction of Hebrews 13:8 they need to see that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today forever they can't go everywhere in they can only go where the scene is and the seed is in the body this is the body the seed is in the body Oh glory to God glory it's not coming to the body it's already in the body watch this church watch this Jesus Christ the same yesterday if ever you believe it there these are not denominational hybrids now a man this is those that's an orbit waiting for the countdown you know what I mean fixing to take a rocket that I don't know where I'm at I'm fixing to take a rocket glory amen these are not denominational hybrids not standing in here they're not no sir it's the seed that's what the Prophet called you now let let's go on a little further it says now I'm going down to paragraph 401 I believe in that same message and I got it mixed up there it says now Philip had been up to Pentecost Jerusalem to worship I mean he says amen to that the eunuch he had been I've been down there with all the DVDs I think I already got that I got that I got that okay no okay why didn't he get something he come back down studying the prophecy of Isaiah although an angel directed Philip to him the German life had to come through the body Philip notices now what the brothers say you know so what we have is Philip they meant this when Jesus had to go by Samaria he knew the German life had to come through him to her to the woman at the well that's why Jesus had need to go by Samaria Jesus has left the scene now and now we got these disciples on the scene and here Philip is it once city preacher the revival but because there's one man Amen on the backside of a desert that is study of Scripture and this man has questions that angel goes to Philip and says Philip I need you to leave here and go to the backside of the desert because he didn't even tell him I just get down the backside of desert and when he got there he heard this man reading Scripture he was reading a book if I said you know and as he's reading scripture like well who is this prophet talking about who is the prophet referring to is he talking about himself or is it talking about another man Philip say do you understand with Teresa how can I understand unless somebody show me when the man opened up that was that it was just what was happened just just a little Amen the little shell was coming off to allow just a little water to get in hallelujah and when Philip jumped up of a chariot and begin to preach Christ out the scripture to this man hope that s om begin the sign on a eunuch in there in the desert there on his way back to Ethiopia the conditions were just right for the answer win the strike this man glory to God and when the conditions get Scott just right the man say who can stop me from being baptized when your conditions get just right you go run into the water when your conditions get just right you repent of all your sin when your conditions get just right you can't stop this seed from coming forth but the reason that the angel did not go down and see that man himself is because the C word the germination process had to go through the body hallelujah God want us to produce a man ever see this but those supposed to produce after his own kind can I ask what's must being produced off of your tree what's being produced off your tree next year you ought to be looking to bring somebody else to church with you because the seats was reduced after some guy not only did the c-word a man passed through the body and fill his time but you know even when it when it came to you know brother branham gave out a couple other other examples you know the reason that Peter had to go to connect his house the angel told Peter where to go Gary told the angel token is where to go get Peter from and the reason the angel told Coe token is where Peter was because the angel himself could not bring the seat word he needed Peter as another human being identify with canoes to bring the c-word Peter was carrying the germ of life are you with me Peter at that time was Karen determine can I tell you this morning you are also carrying the germ of life all we got to do is get it in the right position don't let the devil come take these promises from you even when you're amongst your loved ones remind them of who they are reminder this is what God said about you and this is what this is what God's promises to me for you and I'm believing God for you honey hey man I'm sticking everything I got on that and I'm not gonna let the devil take it from me no matter what I see the seed is passing through your body Oh glory to God glory to God glory to God let me let me just find one and we'll break out of this oh my the conditions just got to be right the reason that Paul had to be visited by Ananias is because the seed had to pass through the body the German life was coming through Ananias Oh God the German life is going through you a man that's going through you even right now it's going through you remember I told you sometimes you can be looking at a at just something on the seat that seek out an embryo in it and it don't look like nothing happening to it but you just leave it right where in that condition the earth will strike it God will put in a certain position and what was in it is gonna come forth oh yes believe that let me just finish off with this one quote Jesus let me start with God is in his people God is in his people Oh glory all right many people gets the wrong impression on these meetings they think because the Evangelist is there or something someone praying for the sick when he's gone all the healing virtue is gone God covers the earth your pasta what's the matter with my pastor that he can't do that well friends that's the wrong impression half yea passes if he's a godly man his prayers will be answered just the same as any evangelists or anybody claiming any gift or anything else he's a man of God and you should respect him that way believe in him and God will answer your prayer answer his prayer he said confess your faults one to another and pray one for the other that you might be healed not only every person in a measure that's got the Holy Spirit has the gift of healing in a measure notice that not every person they got the Holy Ghost in a mess you already got to get to healing no I don't think we caught it don't pray don't pray X got to give it to you you already have it it's just in a mention that means you can lay hands on the sick and they'll recover hey man listen it says every Apple that's in the tree is in the tree when it's a sprig no more than that when it's a little-bitty branch set in the ground every bloom that I ever be in the tree is in it right then the blooms don't come down out of the air the blooms don't come up through the ground the blooms already in the tree the apples already in it the trees planted in the ground and the only thing it has to do is drink praise God and when it goes to drink him and it has to drink more than its portion and it's Red's out push this out that's the way we're planted in Christ Jesus through the inexhaustible fountain of life we start drinking the more we drink we just push out that's right it brings out these elements I want to encourage you to drink as much as you can as we go into this next year drink as much as you can watch what pushes out a man you can never have too much of God and the gift of gift that God has called you to the trouble of it is you don't drink that's right you don't drink don't you believe he's the inexhaustible fountain of life come to me all you let are the ends of the world and drink the devil don't care how much you come as long as you don't drink so today I will let you coming in shout and jump and do everything and Long's you'll know that you don't drink because if you drink you're getting yourself in right conditions the devil don't care how much you've come as long as you don't drink you come and drink and that's what the meeting is for now for you to drink there's a fountain open flowing freely everywhere just drink to you just came drink no more the tree if it just drink to what it was a lot man why it would just always still just always still in drought that's what's the matter with the Christians they don't drink enough you want a drink to you just spread out and let somebody else see it now like that see push out get a testimony commit it to God believe it step out on it claim God's promise just committed to God believe it commit my ways them to the Lord he will bring it to pass whatever you want but he can't do it as long as you're holding it so now I will see if I'm any better amen and see if I'm any better and see if this will work you committed to him forget about the rest of it go testifying of things you don't even see alright I'm just I'm almost I'm almost done but please just just just touch your neighbor and say testify things you don't even see all right testify of things you don't see I'm not talking about things that you do see testify things that you don't see what's going to happen when you start testifying things that you don't see you're gonna make it come to pass then remember we said on Friday night you got you got you know God took the speech from Zachariah he couldn't speak anymore amen it's a curse come on you when you don't believe right but you want to start testifying of things that you don't even see hallelujah amen you say have a song I see my promise coming down the road listen go to test other things you don't even see you believe it's not what you see it's what you believe it's not what you feel he never did say did you feel it he said did you believe it that's how you saved us by faith that's how you healed us by faith and faith is the substance of things hoped for and not only that it's the evidence of things you don't see taste feel smell or hear you just believe it act upon it as though it was hey Church I'm under expectation for what God has put in me to come to full manifestation I've seen bits and pieces at different times because situations might have you know caused it to be that way but I'm on expectation for everything all that God wants he poured in a crisis and all that Christ is he has poured it into his church churches time for us to rise up and let's see some seeds break forth hey man a man if God planted himself in you then God must come for but in order to get those things coming forth let's settle all the same questions Amen let's take care of the same question begin ready to go into another year let's expect great things from God hey man let's pray father we thank you O God Lord you have encouraged us with your word just even think about the song Lord that was used to bring us out Lord waymaker a miracle
