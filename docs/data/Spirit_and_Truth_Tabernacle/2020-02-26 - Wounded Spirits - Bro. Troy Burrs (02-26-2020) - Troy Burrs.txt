TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] forty-two man Psalms 42 just a real good study the word a man some sorta to the first chapter will be reading first through the third chapter amen it reads as the heart penneth after the water Brooks so Paneth my soul after the O God my soul thirsts for God for the Living God when shall I come to appear before God my tears have been my meet day and night while they continually say unto me where is thy God amen you may be seated made a lord at a blessing to the reading of his word amen last time I was before you I think it was last Wednesday I was sharing on how how antibiotics and different medications and different things you there's a certain weight you have to follow the prescription if it's going to do you any good and sometimes we get physically sick in our bodies and different things let nature and we go to the doctor and the doctor will prescribe him do it run some tests a man said well I'll see what's wrong what's wrong with you a man and and and and and that's kind of you know what God is doing you know when our life there's certain things that happen certain trials and tribulations and things that we come up against this is God just running tests a man to see where you might be lacking so once you find out where these trials and tests and different things that you might go through and you might discover what were you a little bit low here or you got this maybe a little high the doctor prescribes a prescription for that so what I'm going to prescribe this and dis use you to take it this way and and and the problem is is you you will go and we may take get this for subscription and and we'll we'll sit it on the counter and and and don't take you and it's not going to do us any good unless we take the prescription not only must we take the subscription we must take it according to the directions prescribed on the bottle president God said that you know medicine is a form of healing he said that he knew to Debbie people he loves people so much they said they knew the dougie people that won't come to church he knew that there will be people that won't have her faith amen to trust and believe in God so what he did he provided he he allowed men amen to dip into the mind of God amen and to develop medicine amen for their bodies they may he allowed he allowed science amen the science is to just go a little deeper to things and be able to put things together to be able to to to to aid in the healing of the body God allows this so our doctors in in our our medicine that we have there is a form of healing a man a doctor can take a bone or whatever and put it in place but ultimately it's God that does to heal it but he allowed me to help facilitate these things amen but God is still the healer a man I'm reminded when the Prophet was gone uh-uh-uh-uh-uh he was a contested by this man named dr. Beth and I think it was a bad word say well let me Adam brother Brent let me have him he say well long as you don't get up there and start fighting with the man and get all up said no no no I won't I won't do that I won't do that and one of the thing man was where he asked brother Bosworth was brother broswer tied him up and just taller Muslims those seven names of Jehovah is that Christ the man got all discombobulated and just didn't know how to come back so now he he got upset but brother bars worsen and and everything and and and he said where is that healer where is that healer and but the bonds were totally saying that my that brother branham never to be a healer he just claimed to be a minister for the gospel so brother Branham I never claimed to be a hill of God is to heal a man in the minister and the prophets they just facilitate a man on my mind a winner mm I'm sorry this drew a blank he fell through the lattice and he took up sick after he fell through the lattice and he went down amen to consult Beelzebub a man for healing and the Prophet said go stand in his way seeing a process that our God will build will send all kind of things when you are gone in the wrong way when you're gone about it the wrong way to stop you but a lot of times we fight all over what God is doing we fight right over what he's doing he'll give us he said why is there no balm in Gilead why would you go and consult a man the world or for for the things that that you have need of and when is there no ball and killing it amen now let's get to where we trying to go here we see here this description of this distance here in Psalms and David as the heart pennant after the waterproof so does my soul throne of my soul after the Oh God we see that dis describing of the animal amen the heart which is a deer and man that is in a situation of having been wounded and bit of an animal of prey that is seeking to devour we know that Satan is like a rolling lion roaming to and fro seeking whom he may devour so this this animal prey on his deer seeking to devour him and and this deer is searching for water to stop the bleeding he's wounded and there's a lot of times we get wounded a man but we what we need to do a state right with life-giving water a man because that life-giving water is what's going to sustain us through that womb a man he says my soul thirst for God and for the Living God when shall I come and appear before God amen he's asking a question when shall I come and appear before God when will it be my turn to meet God and observe him in a personal encounter appear means to look at or either face the encounter to meet with a cause to look intently at take a real good look at the situation wait oh god I thirst after you where are you gonna show me you wait have you gonna wait when can I see you do something in my life amen in this present situation that I'm going through this deers wounded and he knows if he don't get to water it's over he'll be destroyed the Lord lead me to the brook amen he says my tears have been my meat day and night oh my David is really going through something he's wounded a man he said my tears have got me been buy me day and night while they continually saying unto me where is that God so he's going through a trial it may not be a physical trial it may not be a physical one but it's spare is wounded sometimes we get wounded on the inside but we walk around with a smile on my face we walk around with a shell amen and like everything is okay but in our heart we're like David here my tears is my meat day and night where oh where is the God of my salvation amen David is writing this as a man that is in discouragement he's the wounded spirit and others are observing him that it seems like God is not around to bring him relief for him in the way that they think God should give relief and I see that's just it he said he'll never leave us nor forsake us and a lot of times when when when the answer don't come in the way that we think it should come we think that God is not there sometimes he wants you to go through a little bit remember the doctor is testing you and sometimes when the doctor is testing you it may hurt I have to go in the morning to give blood I need a hurt why do I have to go through this but when they're running the tacks it may cause some pain but you have to rest and I think rubber cause a little pain you know thank God is with you that that give out of 5 it meant they're going to find nothing amen are they going to be able to cure whatever you find out whatever may be low high or whatever the deal is but you may go through some pain you may go through some torment that's physical same thing in the spiritual where oh where is God the Bible says in proverbs 18 the spirit of a man was sustained his infirmity but a wounded spirit who can bear the spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity but a wounded spirit who can bear his physical sickness or disease a man people can get a bruised and her and won't in their spirit that is often harder to bear than to heal from a physical injury I'm gonna say that again people can't get a bruise and hurt and wounded in this spirit that is often harder to bear or harder to heal than from a physical injury or pain talking about wounded spirits the subject the purpose is to bring encouragement that no matter what it is you're going through there is a balm in Gilead there is an attested inoculation for whatever you might be going through be encouraged expecting for those of us who struggle with wounded spirits in some way for we will all go through these things at some time or another because this is the way of the journey of life that we are all alone but there is a bone there is a medicine God has provided that for us he said in the Book of Psalms 147 the third chapter he that he lists a broken heart and bind it up there was a man proverbs 18 the spirit of a man will sustain infirmity but the wounded spirit II can bear a spirit that has been struck and received a hard blow a spirit that has been struck and received a hard blow the prophet said a lot of times they would a hard blow causes a bruise and sometime that would cause an infirmity cancer from a fall from a bruise from a hard blow amen so we see here in proverbs the 17th chapter xxii verse a merry heart doeth good like a medicine but a broken spirit dries the bone in other words it can drain once strengthen a merry heart when a person is joyful a man in laughter humming in know laughter is a form of healing amen but a broken spirit says try it's the bone it drains you not only does it drains you to fix others around person asked me one time on an interview it's a job interview so when are you at your most happiest and I guess it was inspiration all that because I had never heard the question or whatever had not answered the question when the others are around me are happy she kind of paused and so I never heard that I said me neither me neither but it was good wait agreed on that she said yeah that was good but that's what came from my heart when are you at your most happiest when others around me are happy it's contagious its contagious amen so we see we know the human spirit of a man or woman then Austin does become discouraged and even wounded by varying degrees by negative exist some circumstances in life our spirits can also be affected by negative actions and attitudes and words of others especially from people that are closest to us hey man sometime we all say things that we wish we could bring back just not thinking sometimes a man thoughts not thoughtful enough before we say things sometimes we can say things I've heard others because maybe we're just a little carnal insensitive absorbed in ourselves so that tend to make us not very perceptive of what others might be going through relationship and others that maybe just a little bit more sensitive and how many times have you been talking with someone and you just say something and joking and they take it the wrong way amen that's because that person has already got a wounded spirit and you just hit a sore spot see so we must be perceptive amen but that person we're talking about the wounded spirit there is a balm in Gilead for that wounded and broken spirit a man we see that there are many things many things that can negatively influence us that would even wound our spirit amen David experienced rejection by King Saul rejection from leaders can wound our spirits rejection by friends family these things can wound us unforgiveness can wound our spirits it will bring us harm betrayal betrayal can cause us to have a wounded spirit being falsely accused or suspected of something that you did not do can wound your spirit a loss of a close loved one can wound the human spirit these are just a few of the things that everybody will go through at some point or another in our lives that will wound us it's impossible to work in a kitchen environment certain environment without getting scrapes but it's impossible to go through this world without getting scrapes cuts but we must be wise and how we treat those we don't ignore a wound or to get infected and cause a bigger problem sometimes we ignore a wound and the pastor was talking about that slow fade it calls you to faith and you wonder what's wrong you got a room that you didn't take care of and it got infected now there's a infection through the body but you gotta take there's an inoculation what's the sense of going to the doctor getting the prescription and dying on the doctors doorstep there is a bomb in Gilly when we talk about a bomb when they when they win mate when they when they develop medicine they go through research and they use what we call them guinea pigs but those things have variables because the guinea pig or whatever they may use is not exactly the same as a human body and they test this serum at on this guinea pig to see if it cure this or I would have fixed this and they may look at all of the side effects and sometime I'd rather take I'd rather deal with that to deal with the side effects but see when God brought a guinea pig oh Jesus he had a guinea pig and he injected him at Calvary amen and it healed it when they injected him at Calvary a man wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities and the chest tightened and other people's upon him and by His stripes were healed they then use a guinea pig he used our Lord who came down and took on the body like ours amen so there's no side effects - that's the population no side effects it does what it's sad it does amen it does exactly what it says it does you think and apply it according to the directions according to the prescription I made the comment and I was coming to church Sunday I was praying in myself and it's his law did so many need he say the Word of God the Word of God do the job but then it was just like the law was sitting in the next scene of when he said but you have to take you have to apply it correctly see we can have all of the quotes we can have the Bible is a new book but unless we do what it says like I see we come to the doctor on one day he give us assignment go take this take this do that hit plenty of rest drink liquids come back in two weeks if you don't come back in two weeks he can't see us what you have to come back you have Jesus meets all his appointments do you he means the Prophet said that a Christian with the baptism only knows can't wait to get to his appointment we have an appointment a divine appointment a meant to be in the presence of the Lord in the presence of the presence of the Lord to womb to heal that wounded and broken spirit but we get cuts in this life and the worst thing you can do is ignore well it's just a little cut Oh it'll take care of itself you don't put nothing on it you don't come to the lower house of the Lord and that's boomed in your spirit don't get no SAP and it's an open wound and the devil just simin other devils right in that womb infecting the body you got no choice no peace in your heart you begin the thirst you begin the thirst yes you've not taken the right prescription if you're not standing the presence of the Lord dangerous say Lord lead me to the water guess what the devil quench that thirst if you don't he will give you some substitute you got an open wound the body is infected now he says just take your drinking and liver it'll take care down here to take care that pain I got so afraid go to the West doctor you go to Beelzebub kill it you go to Beelzebub to find a cure for that whatever is bothering you on the inside a many tenant coming into the house or the Lord what it's infected and there's that slow thing now the devil is gonna offer you something it don't heal it it just causes problems elsewhere that's right brother it masks and Dean calls it's a defense they offer you why don't you smoke this cigarette but you're sucking now cancer all the time side effects man I could have tired of this side effects amen he offer you adultery Oh your spirit is wounded and I got somebody make you feel bad about yourself it's down offer you down put this pleasure in it it may feel like it's taking time but just cause you offer you mean are you coming back $50 $100 I know people pay they hope but they on the frat Oh awesome scratch up you got a deal hey man some find it going to the club can't wait to Friday or whenever to go out what dish that I've been stressed all week I'm going out man I tell you what come to church no but what it is is you you got something going on and you trying to solve it the dealt with the first from the devil it's in you the thirst God placed it in you the first when you wounded that's a natural you wounded you hurt you're going through something you don't to clean this body Lord Amen there is a balm in Gilead for whatever you're going through it's like castor oil my grandmother used to give me cash to roll it took three good men to hold me down I couldn't stand that stuff but they get it in me and they say if it don't if you don't if you don't hurt you and man it ain't doing you know cuz I think Sunday we all had a look at all thank God for the cash flow rate man appreciate it amen first corinthians the tenth chapter 13 verse says there has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able to bear a man but will with the temptation also make a way of escape that ye may be able to bear it see a man it's only your test a man we trust our doctors we go and if they say they got to do surgery we trust him so open up our body to do what they have to do to save our life allow God to spiritually open you up and perform a surgery he's the best doctor areas the best doctor area see that not that he can only Deacon all the work on what he can see he can only work on that physical part but see when our spirit is oh we need we need we need something more than just that doctor man we need doctor Jesus hey man we need dr. Jesus a man who we trust him we need to keep our appointments amen we take the medicine Amen we apply it according to the directions it will soothe us it would take care of what Elvis but we have to have faith and be patient half a and be patient and trust in it it'll take care of us amen it says and it seems like the Lord this is uh and I'm sorry then there are times we'll also be in our lives that even as even if we have a close relationship with the Lord times of trouble will come along in our lives and it's seen by the law fails to bring relief to our trials like we think he should and then we may feel that he has failed us as a friend as they Savior and then if we're not mature enough our relationship can become stained with the Lord or strained with the Lord and that can also wound our spirit by us thinking that the Lord has led us down a man but actually that is just wrong thinking remember the Prophet went through that when his baby died he was met with that test the double came and told him and you serve a god like that amen he was back that spirit was rising up in him trying to rise up in him to get him angry with the Lord all of these people every seven years the prophets say he used them haven't he had an illness the hot stuff in his mouth for you to say some gas something he said I go around healing people and touching this person and heal healing that person but Lord I have to go through this he just had to trusted an inoculation he had to just trust in it amen that God will bring the healing Psalms I think Marie of Psalms 46 psalm 46 God is our refuge and Our Strength 1st chapter God is our refuge and strength a very present help in the time of trouble therefore we will not fear though the earth be moved and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters thereof raw then troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof sail on there is a river the stream where all of shall make glad the City of God the holy place of the tabernacle of the Most High God is in the midst of her she shall not be moved God shall help her and then right early a man Hebrews the 13th chapter I will never leave you nor forsake you I'll be with you to the end Isaiah 40 second chapter the third verse says a bruised Reed shall he not breathe and the smoking flax shall he not quench he shall bring forth judgment unto truth a bruised Reed will not break and the smoking flax shall he not quench he shall bring forth judgment unto truth amen in other words he will faithfully bring us out of the situation in the end it is just our perception at the time the trial that we would think that he is left us it is just our perception because of the bruise but he will be with us to the end and that we could not see him at work a man while we are in the trial a lot of times we can't see what he's doing that's why you have to have faith in Him a man he could be doing something for your own good but we can't see the end but we have to have faith and believe that all things work together for good to them that love God in the call according to his purpose amen all things even in the midst of our trial even in the midst of our womb that God will take us to this trial amen and he'll I won't we still must have but even if we have a womb we're going through something we come to church I don't feel no relief keep coming keep praying keep applying mesial keep taking the inoculation but I don't see where it's doing it no keep taking it God the end result he'll meet you at the end trust in Him God I did everything you told me to do now here we are at the end I'm just waiting on you but if you don't do it you can't say what God you didn't do it but you didn't take you didn't apply it you didn't apply the scripture you went to church you heard the word and did you lesson you did what you wanted to do you never lied it will heal that's proof that's proof after proof that it will do the job if you just take the inoculation according to the direction and meet your appointments amen maybe there was another man that knew something about trials amen Oh Joel knew something about trials job said behold I go forward but he is not there I go backward but I tend not perceive him on the left hand where he do its work but I cannot behold him he hired us himself on the right hand and I cannot see him but he knoweth the way that I take when he hath tried me I shall come forth let's go my foot has yield his steps his way have I kept and not decline and neither have I gone back from the commandments of his lips oh job's some kind of man after all that he was going through he said I go forward I can't find God I go back what sin he ain't there all around me where is the God where is he he see what I'm going through I lost my land I lost my mommy I lost my job I lost but sure my wife left me um our body is breaking down I imagine his spirit was wounded I imagine his spirit was wounded but he didn't say I quit I give up on you he says oh he's a slaver yet I'll trust you hmm and I imagine God to smile I told you to and that's he's bragging on us today he's bragging on you he won't quit no matter how hard they try no matter what he go through he'll come it'll take the medicine my granddad my granddad my grandad a diabetic and they had it my granddad was one of the Deacons in the church and he was set over here and there denied then he'd get me shot he shot he give up the shot but they couldn't leave my granddaddy was shot even without his leash anyone going that take his prey he won't let me let the devil take his prints he shot on one knee shout on one day amen but no matter what you're going through no matter how hard the test no matter how tough the trial stay in the fight my brothers and sisters apply to soldier inoculation or work we just have to apply it right there is a balm in Gilead proven tested better than the FDA proven and tested by God Oh proven and tested by God Almighty it'll do for you what you needed to do never stand a man a man let us take the inoculation the castor oil how I become a man we trusted our medical doctors a man we trusted
