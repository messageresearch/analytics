[27:40] make enough grace to make everybody's
[27:42] experience a little bit better
[27:45] and also try to keep it consistent Lord
[27:48] bless us with a new computer this
[27:50] weekend a manly California on computer
[27:53] were streaming both periscope and
[27:56] Facebook we understand that there was a
[27:58] issue so we went back to original setup
[28:02] and I'm just a lot of changes that we
[28:04] went bacon just renovate your brother's
[28:06] experiences might better so just bear
[28:07] with us made at that and I'm just
[28:11] [Music]
[28:13] this week we had a little problem with
[28:15] love the sound system and we had to make
[28:17] some changes last night to try to get
[28:19] that fix for the day so we're not really
[28:21] sure what all could be contributed to
[28:23] what some just just bear with us a man
[28:25] in that so let me quickly just say we
[28:31] know that here in our area things are
[28:33] starting to change live for Palm Beach
[28:35] County Broward County and daycare they
[28:41] call phase 1 phase 2 phase 3 and we're
[28:45] waiting just to see how things are gonna
[28:47] kind of settle out so as a church will
[28:50] continue to do what we have been doing
[28:52] amen continuing a social distancing
[28:55] washing my hands and then all of those
[28:57] things as we come into the house in the
[28:59] morning our desires eventually get
[29:01] everybody back together again but for
[29:03] right now let's just - we are
[29:06] we'll keep you updated so the virtual
[29:08] service always if I look to you that
[29:10] that happens at 7:30 again joined
[29:13] virtually via periscope or via Facebook
[29:16] no Friday services until further notice
[29:19] and also our service services will
[29:25] and for the second group and again those
[29:27] services will be streamed via Facebook
[29:31] fi periscopes of that in mind I wanted
[29:34] to also just announce we are we have a
[29:38] church app that many older forebay with
[29:41] but the company that we bought the that
[29:44] we're paying for the app through they
[29:46] actually have sold they'd have to
[29:47] another company
[29:49] they've been asking us since the
[29:51] beginning of the year to migrate to the
[29:53] new platform
[29:55] we have got most of it working what we
[29:58] were asked everyone to view adjust
[30:01] download on your phone
[30:04] that map is called the church app th
[30:08] each church at the church and if you
[30:11] just download that to your phone
[30:15] then you just find the church spirit
[30:16] 'triple tabernacle and you'll see that
[30:19] new app and if you you know you see all
[30:21] those just different functions that we
[30:23] have there and if you would just
[30:25] download that start using it if you run
[30:29] into any problems with anything please
[30:30] just let us know something try to get
[30:32] things corrected
[30:34] within the next month or so we'll have
[30:36] to start moving over to that platform
[30:37] because they're asking us to do don't do
[30:40] that
[30:40] so make good more
[30:41] my church app a platform to the church
[30:45] at the platform zone just saw both of
[30:48] them will be working for now but
[30:50] probably within a month or so the only
[30:55] thought Church Apple works please start
[30:57] downloading that
[31:00] manages follow us there
[31:04] all right you think that's that so as
[31:06] far as giving a man we continue to
[31:12] use giving through PayPal as well as the
[31:16] room
[31:18] - yeah
[31:21] PayPal I can mention see all it does
[31:23] charge a number of fees if you don't do
[31:26] it just right so if you if you have a
[31:28] cash at Macau and encourage if you want
[31:30] to give online maybe the best just to do
[31:32] the cash after that you don't have to
[31:34] worry about the email address and all
[31:36] that
[31:37] using paypal just make sure that you
[31:40] giving that job $43
[31:43] you want to give to a friend you wanna
[31:45] make sure you select that option to give
[31:47] to a friend and they email address that
[31:49] you use is giving at John four to three
[31:53] so again if you have cash that is you
[31:56] don't have to worry about that just use
[31:59] the church
[32:01] their spirit of team cash a foul spirit
[32:05] of t mo you can give their war news big
[32:08] now just make sure you give to a friend
[32:11] use giving in John 4:23 now Morgan as to
[32:14] fritz email address I think has give to
[32:17] the family of friends with something
[32:18] like that with that not eliminate fees
[32:20] man when they don't take from us if we
[32:24] give their PayPal so just remember for
[32:26] that no fees would cash that but PayPal
[32:28] we do have that and if we don't forgive
[32:30] amen not as a friend so let's pray about

[36:15] special blessing to them as our prayer
[36:18] in Jesus name we ask it amen amen you
[36:22] can be seated
[36:28] since it is Mother's Day I wanted to
[36:31] just take a thought that would be geared
[36:36] towards the mothers a man and and I know
[36:40] that brother Branham there was a quote
[36:42] that I have here we tell you know
[36:43] mother's day shouldn't just be
[36:44] celebrated one day out of the year
[36:46] should be every day a man 365 days we
[36:50] should appreciate Mother's a man but I
[36:53] am glad that there is at least one day
[36:55] set aside that we gotta stop and take
[36:57] time and acknowledge and appreciate mama
[37:00] a man for all that she is and and I pray
[37:04] that everybody that has a mother a man
[37:07] that's that's present even if she is far
[37:10] away and send at least some no to
[37:12] something let him know that you love and
[37:13] that you appreciate it
[37:15] you know you're given a card or some
[37:16] flowers a present or something but let
[37:19] mama know that you love a man so here
[37:22] you know we want to just use for a title
[37:25] this is for our mothers ye shall be
[37:28] comforted
[37:28] a man ye shall be comforted
[37:32] praise the Lord only only the Lord knows
[37:35] what a mama goes through amen only only
[37:39] the Lord knows what she's feeling and
[37:41] and and and identifying oftentimes men
[37:45] we cannot identify with the feelings
[37:50] that the mama has a man we're kind of
[37:52] tough and we are you know not as
[37:56] sentimental you know but but mama has a
[37:59] heart like no other a man
[38:02] I mean you won't remember the story that
[38:05] brother Branham told us of of the the
[38:08] the cruel hunter a man the one with the
[38:11] lizard eyes
[38:12] and you know and lizard I burped with go
[38:17] out and hunt and he would he would take
[38:19] his little horn and he would call he
[38:24] would act as if he was a little fawn and
[38:27] he would blow that that little horn and
[38:29] when you know acting as if it was fun
[38:32] and notice now in the story that the
[38:35] Prophet tells us the daddy deer is
[38:39] nowhere to be found
[38:40] praise the Lord somebody the daddy
[38:43] there's nowhere to be found but but but
[38:45] mama has this sense that the baby's in
[38:51] trouble and since the baby's in trouble
[38:53] mama will go through whatever it is that
[38:57] she have to go through in order to
[38:59] protect this baby a man when it's when
[39:03] it's in her nature to actually run from
[39:06] the hunter when she sees the hunter she
[39:09] notices that the hunters there if she's
[39:11] picked up his scent or you know
[39:13] something like that this mother has
[39:15] instinct to get out of harm's way but
[39:18] because her baby it's in trouble then
[39:21] she Rises amen and looks the hunter
[39:23] right in the eye
[39:24] I don't care about your bullet I don't
[39:26] care about your gun but I'm gonna stand
[39:28] here and take one for my baby
[39:30] hallelujah Mama's are willing to go
[39:32] through things that a man others may not
[39:35] go through Mama's will put up with
[39:37] things that others may not put up with
[39:39] praise the Lord somebody a man when you
[39:42] if you've ever been in trouble or
[39:44] something like that and you know you
[39:45] knew you couldn't go to your daddy with
[39:47] that alright somebody might as well be
[39:50] honest you could go to Daddy with that
[39:52] you went to mama because mama has a
[39:54] certain spirit but I mean even even the
[39:57] day we we we fought it we 50 we Amen if
[40:01] you believe you six and you still got
[40:02] your mama if you going through something
[40:04] you gonna go get the mama real quick
[40:06] mama got a way to comfort you mama got a
[40:09] way of speaking
[40:11] mama got away of saying things a certain
[40:13] way and ain't no voice like Mama's voice
[40:18] hallelujah I don't care who you hear
[40:21] from but when you hear from it brings
[40:26] comfort a man it does something very it
[40:29] does something for your soul glory to
[40:31] God thank God for Mama's right here you
[40:35] know I want to just encourage the
[40:36] mothers she shall be comforted and I
[40:39] don't know I I do have a couple of poems
[40:42] that I was gonna read one of them I know
[40:44] you don't have in the back but the other
[40:46] one I got one from rep Brent I don't
[40:48] know if you got that one back there but

[40:59] fragrance of a flower the majesty of a
[41:03] tree the gentleness of morning dew the
[41:08] calm of a quiet see the beauty of the
[41:12] twilight hour' the soul of a starry
[41:15] night the laughter of a rippling Brook
[41:19] the grease of a bird in flight
[41:22] then God fashioned from these things a
[41:26] creation like no other a man and when
[41:30] his masterpiece was through he called it
[41:33] simply mother a man a man Herbert farm
[41:38] ham wrote that that poem there and I
[41:41] just thought it was very fitting here
[41:43] for Mother's Day I want to read to you
[41:44] from a couple of quotes out of the
[41:47] message mother's day I thank God that
[41:49] the Prophet preached on this subject and
[41:51] and and I always love going back to this
[41:54] sermon especially on this day and
[41:55] pulling out some things that we can we
[41:57] can just get comfort from this first
[41:59] thing that he says here to us his mother
[42:01] is so great
[42:02] praise the Lord he says you know the
[42:05] first one that receives you in this life
[42:08] is your mother no one can touch you
[42:13] because you're conceived and she bears
[42:17] you under her heart
[42:19] Amen this is where we all have a
[42:21] special connection to mama all right
[42:24] she bears you under heart and and and
[42:27] and and and you know whatever whatever
[42:33] we do this is one thing if we can all
[42:36] just understand this connection that
[42:38] people have when I'm born of this this
[42:42] this particular lady I when when I was
[42:45] conceived it was in her womb and and and
[42:47] and and before anybody knew me before
[42:49] anybody saw me right you know I was
[42:53] growing inside of her but before I could
[42:55] come to the earth and be an expression a
[42:57] man of my father I had to grow inside of
[43:01] her I had to be nurtured by her she had
[43:03] to watch what she ate in order to take
[43:06] care of me come on somebody right you
[43:08] know and and and there was so much that
[43:11] she didn't make sure that I arrived here
[43:13] safely praise the Lord and so so so now
[43:17] when I realized how important that
[43:20] process was you're not gonna lie you're
[43:23] not gonna come to me when I become an
[43:25] adult right and and then try to come up
[43:28] with something to put a wedge between me
[43:30] and my mama hello somebody right I mean
[43:34] we got to understand no matter no matter
[43:36] what has happened between your mama
[43:38] Mama's still special if it wasn't for
[43:40] mama you wouldn't be here
[43:42] praise the Lord Amen also if it weren't
[43:45] for daddy wouldn't be here but but but
[43:46] today is Mother's Day so you know you
[43:48] got to learn to appreciate mama you're
[43:50] right you ain't gonna get so old come on
[43:52] somebody and go through some things
[43:54] where you can't you can't it just say
[43:56] mama thank you praise the Lord I don't
[43:59] care what I don't care about your
[44:00] disagreements there must come a time
[44:02] when you set that to the side he said
[44:04] mama I appreciate yes praise Aloha they
[44:07] think about what she did to bring you
[44:10] here glory to God all right let's go on
[44:13] now she bears you under our heart and
[44:15] she is the first to know you and the
[44:17] first in this life to hold you then when
[44:20] you're born she is one of the first
[44:23] first hands that touch you and wipes
[44:25] back to tears out of your eyes she's the
[44:28] first one to pat you pat you and to love
[44:31] you and to coo over you in this
[44:34] is your mother now I think that there's
[44:37] not enough honor that we can give to a
[44:40] mother mother is first with the child
[44:43] and she has a great responsibility of
[44:46] what that child will be a man Mama's the
[44:50] first with a child and she has a great
[44:52] spice responsibility of what that child
[44:54] would be it would be based upon the way
[44:57] that mother starts that child on the
[45:00] path that it must travel mother has a
[45:04] responsibility from God to place that
[45:07] child on the right Road and I think
[45:09] that's why Mother's has a special little
[45:12] touch so if you had a mother and your
[45:14] life that is placed on the right Road
[45:16] that taught you about Jesus that took
[45:18] you to church so you can learn about
[45:20] Jesus that that great for you pray in
[45:23] front of you a man prayed amen even when
[45:27] not maybe if she prayed against some of
[45:29] the things that you doing you want to
[45:30] appreciate a mama like that hallelujah
[45:34] and I know when I was coming up there
[45:36] was times where I didn't really want to
[45:38] go to church a man I didn't really want
[45:40] to I didn't really want to do some of
[45:42] the things that I saw mama doing but I
[45:44] tell you what I can appreciate today a
[45:46] man that my mama was consistent in what
[45:49] she was doing when the Lord got ahold of
[45:52] our life we all realized God it done
[45:54] something different a man I can go back
[45:56] in in my mind and just remember one time
[45:59] we were in the house and we were all so
[46:01] hungry amen we were we were ready to eat
[46:03] him and and you know we just depended on
[46:06] mama to cook we just depended on that
[46:08] and I sometimes you take things for
[46:10] granted but mama what my mama would have
[46:12] the food already and we just we gobbled
[46:15] it up you know but this one day we was
[46:17] all hungry like where is mama and we
[46:19] were open up the front door and we see
[46:22] all the vehicles outside and we know my
[46:24] man left the house she's somewhere
[46:26] around here but where is mama I mean we
[46:29] hungry mama we we want to eat mama and
[46:31] we could not find mama for nothing I
[46:34] mean we looked in the backyard we looked
[46:36] in the front yeah we looked on the side
[46:38] of the house we looking everywhere where
[46:40] is mama and and
[46:42] and none of us confinement then all of a
[46:44] sudden we went till we had a van at that
[46:47] time and and we went to that we went to
[46:49] the van and we found mama inside the van
[46:51] praying that time it didn't mean as much
[46:58] as it means to me now a man by all I can
[47:02] think about is I want something to eat
[47:03] and I was interrupting prayer time but
[47:06] but I can appreciate a mama that came he
[47:09] found in the kitchen but she can be
[47:11] found on her knees somewhere praying for
[47:14] her children that's that's a mama that's
[47:17] racing on the right way
[47:19] a mama that that's gonna influence them
[47:21] in the right way and the scripture tells
[47:23] that when you train up a child the way
[47:25] he should go when they get oh he warmed
[47:27] apart thank God for momma's like that
[47:30] mom I want to tell you if you got away
[47:31] with child this morning you will be
[47:34] confident you will be comfortable praise
[47:39] the Lord
[47:39] look at this the Prophet goes on to say
[47:41] I know a boy in this city and I think
[47:44] his mother's present now he's almost my
[47:47] age but I don't say this to hurt the
[47:50] mother I'm in the same quote says I
[47:53] don't say this to hurt the mother
[47:54] because that she has enough hurts a man
[47:59] we don't say things to hurt mama mama
[48:00] got enough hurts
[48:02] I hate man look you put mama through
[48:04] hurt and if she got mo children their
[48:06] mother children putting her through hurt
[48:08] right she got enough hurts but you know
[48:11] why he went all to her stepmom a guy she
[48:13] always got enough room for you and your
[48:15] problems it's a true thing a man no
[48:19] matter what no matter what the other
[48:20] kids are putting up through she'll still
[48:22] got she's still got time to listen to
[48:24] what you got the same hallelujah a man a
[48:27] man listen since I'm she's got enough
[48:30] verse as all mothers but her but the boy
[48:32] dreams and he drinks heavy and when it
[48:36] gets real drunk he will come home and
[48:39] jump in the bed with his mother and put
[48:42] his arms around her
[48:43] and he's got grandchildren what kind of
[48:48] man is
[48:49] it's he's got now now not now not now me
[48:51] as a man I'm gonna look at this fella
[48:53] say now what in the world you got
[48:55] grandchildren and you jumping in the bed
[48:58] with your mama what's the matter with
[49:00] you right as a man I'm gonna come down
[49:02] on him heart but his mama wants to feel
[49:05] his touch his mama wants to know shoot
[49:08] me make sure you're gonna be all right
[49:09] son yeah and if you made it back home
[49:11] one more time then God was protecting
[49:14] you
[49:14] my prayer was answered I'm happy to have
[49:17] you I'm happy to have you next to me to
[49:20] feel your touch mama thinks about it a
[49:22] little different it says he's got
[49:26] grandchildren but there's something
[49:27] about just the part of a mother that
[49:30] seems to take a different place than
[49:31] anything else can touch that is in this
[49:34] life humanly speaking at their seat he
[49:37] tells us that there's nothing like a
[49:39] mother's touch so when this man is even
[49:41] at his law and sustained maybe he's
[49:42] feeling real bad about what he's done
[49:44] but he goes home and it just tries to
[49:46] get next to mama
[49:48] even with his the man got grandchildren
[49:50] but he wants to be next to mama because
[49:51] mama brings something that nobody else
[49:54] can thank God for godly mothers all
[49:58] right this scripture that we read here
[50:00] and I said amen 66 verse 13 as one whom
[50:07] his mother confidence I mean even our
[50:09] Lord and Lord puts this in the word as
[50:12] one whom his mother confidence a man he
[50:15] didn't say to father he put mother here
[50:18] and as one whom whom his mother
[50:20] confidence so will I comfort you there's
[50:22] nothing like a mother's touch there's
[50:26] nothing like the comfort of a mother
[50:29] Amen my mama like mama was just designed
[50:33] to be able to bring comfort her voice is
[50:35] softer than daddy's right Amen I'll just
[50:39] just so much about her and she just she
[50:41] just you know her her nature is
[50:42] different than daddy's she's designed to
[50:45] bring comfort she says I thank God I
[50:47] mean we meet both of them in our lives
[50:49] but amen it's just something and as we
[50:52] just celebrate the Mother's Day there's
[50:54] just something about being able to get
[50:55] comfort from mama it's somebody being
[50:57] able to go and talk to her and just just
[50:59] just
[51:00] my mom's going through this and my mom
[51:02] going through and it's something about
[51:03] being me to get godly wisdom Amen for a
[51:06] mama glory to God
[51:07] godly comfort my momma got away of
[51:10] saying things that just just just keeps
[51:12] us all together look at this as one who
[51:16] his mother confidence so will I comfort
[51:19] you and ye shall be comforted in
[51:21] Jerusalem now I was looking at this word
[51:23] comfort just wanted to kind of get a
[51:25] couple definitions and and one set a
[51:28] state of physical ease freedom from pain
[51:32] or constraint you know and we realized
[51:35] that you know our mothers can do that
[51:37] you know to us a state of physical ease
[51:39] and freedom from pain and constraint if
[51:41] you've ever had what we call a boo-boo
[51:43] you know something hurtin you go running
[51:45] to mama to see if she can kind of ease
[51:47] the pain a little bit and you know
[51:50] children as children it was and I don't
[51:55] want to take this away from the kids I
[51:56] got to be careful about this but but as
[51:59] children it was just something in our
[52:01] psyche there if we had a little boo-boo
[52:04] a little scratch a little whatever we go
[52:06] running to mama
[52:07] somehow if mama just blow on it somebody
[52:17] just blow on it somehow we felt a man we
[52:22] still bleeding but we felt better
[52:24] because mama blew on it
[52:27] hallelujah what comfort our mama brings
[52:31] hallelujah hallelujah glory to God thank
[52:34] God for say a state of physical ease and
[52:37] freedom from pain or constraint another
[52:42] definition that they had here is the
[52:45] easing or alleviation of a person's
[52:48] feelings
[52:49] Amen the easing or alleviation of a
[52:52] person's feelings
[52:53] Amen feelings of grief or feelings of
[52:56] distress it was the easing of that when
[52:58] when a person is bringing comfort
[53:00] they're trying to ease your feelings
[53:02] they're trying to ease your grief
[53:04] they're trying to ease your distress
[53:07] hallelujah and I don't care you might
[53:10] having trouble on the job but you can
[53:12] somehow call mama mama might not have
[53:14] worked a day in her life don't even know
[53:16] what it means to go through some of the
[53:18] things that go through but somehow mama
[53:20] has the right word to say in order to
[53:23] alleviate or ease the pain or distress
[53:26] that you have hallelujah glory to God
[53:29] amen
[53:30] now I say that because you know it's
[53:33] very easy sometimes that when folk get
[53:35] married amen
[53:37] the wife wants to sometimes play the
[53:39] part of mama she wants to cook she wants
[53:41] to eat this she wants to do that but
[53:43] i'ma tell you amen
[53:45] that there's a connection that is me at
[53:47] birth Amen with Mama that nobody could
[53:51] ever replace how so so in families I
[53:54] wanna encourage the families don't try
[53:56] to come between the relationship of a
[53:58] mother and a daughter or a mother and a
[54:01] son don't try to come between a
[54:03] relationship because it's something that
[54:05] happened at birth encouraging don't
[54:08] discourage it
[54:10] praise the Lord somebody all right all
[54:13] right all right look at this I was
[54:15] thinking a man on this this message the
[54:20] the resurrection of gyruss daughter this
[54:24] quote came around and just talking to
[54:26] talk about a mother here Amen how God
[54:28] was answering her prayer and when a
[54:30] Mama's prayers being answered her pain
[54:33] is being alleviated her distress is
[54:36] being alleviated when God is answering
[54:38] her prayer now look at this in this
[54:40] message to the resurrection of Jarvis's
[54:42] daughter I forgot to bring my timeout
[54:45] here so y'all just bear with me huh
[54:49] since our text this dealing tonight of
[54:53] course with the resurrection of the of
[54:55] Jairus daughter our our kind loving
[54:58] Savior has spent much time just before
[55:01] this he was busy all the time moving
[55:04] from place to place crossing seas
[55:06] stealing waves give him maniacs their
[55:10] right mind he was always busy about the
[55:13] father's business he was a very humble
[55:15] son and obedience
[55:17] even to death night before that or two
[55:20] he crossed the sea and the disciples had
[55:23] been very weary and he had still the sea
[55:26] for them glory to God crossed all the
[55:29] way over into Coderre where there was a
[55:33] maniac taking the chance of crossing a
[55:36] stormy sea when the devils of the sea
[55:39] swore they drown him that night but he
[55:43] went over there
[55:43] and the cry of one person Jesus moved at
[55:48] the cry of one person one poor maniac
[55:53] lost his mind perhaps perhaps a good
[55:58] name at one time in and maybe mommy you
[56:01] got a wayward child that perhaps was a
[56:06] good man at one time perhaps a good
[56:10] woman at one time because it's not the
[56:26] end that you really want to be confident
[56:29] they made me thank God for the
[56:31] deliverance that he brings in the middle
[56:33] but what I really want to see is my
[56:35] child make it yes hallelujah hallelujah
[56:40] that really brings comfort they mean if
[56:43] what God is telling me can make it back
[56:46] to the father's house then I know I'll
[56:48] be comforted alright look at this look
[56:51] at this he says probably perhaps a good
[56:54] man one time walked up right before God
[56:58] but probably got in the wrong crowd
[57:01] might be started drinking or something
[57:05] lost his mind and he lived out in the
[57:09] tombs where the demons live but Budiman
[57:12] changed and he has supernatural powers
[57:14] he break those chains and jump o men and
[57:18] beat them and kill them
[57:20] when they come back look at this and
[57:24] that poor fella maybe he had an old
[57:27] gray-headed mother somewhere glory
[57:31] praying for him Jesus cross to see all
[57:35] the way over into Ghaderi to give mercy
[57:38] to that man he'd do the same tonight
[57:41] where one humble soul is calling to him
[57:43] he crossed the cease or leave the
[57:45] heavens to answer that prayer it's the
[57:48] same Jesus yesterday the Dean fella
[57:51] I love that Oh gray hair mama was
[57:55] praying for her son that was in the
[57:58] tubes a sign that was living in the
[58:00] graveyard see a man I don't care how low
[58:02] you go you can't go Lord enough when
[58:05] mama don't stop praying for you
[58:07] praise the Lord mama will never give up
[58:10] on that child I don't care how far they
[58:13] get away from God
[58:14] mama will still be praying and if he has
[58:17] to cross a stormy sea to get to just one
[58:21] God will do that why because he's
[58:24] answering Mama's friend mama you shall
[58:27] be comforted
[58:30] [Applause]
[58:32] a man you shall be comforted
[58:36] you know I think of a man of this and it
[58:40] just just drives my mind my mind my mind
[58:43] to you know just a mama that saw a boy
[58:46] get real low perhaps he was a good man
[58:49] one time and this fellow was well he was
[58:52] a decent boy got it on the wrong crowd

[1:02:32] he's sure Elisha say say I know I'm the
[1:02:35] my beware is he likes you and then
[1:02:37] she said he say all she said lord I just
[1:02:39] I just don't know what to do and then
[1:02:41] she was praying a prayer like that she
[1:02:43] identifies herself in the Word of God
[1:02:47] because God to respond based on the
[1:02:51] prayer that she prayed this one Jess
[1:02:53] Jess Lord send me a preacher
[1:02:56] send me the priests no she say I wanna I
[1:03:00] mean to see line shot and there was only
[1:03:04] one Elijah on the earth day at that time
[1:03:07] and it just so happened that this Elijah
[1:03:09] was flying right over the top of her
[1:03:12] city and because of a prayer God calls
[1:03:16] the planes are having mechanical failure
[1:03:19] they had to bring the plane down glory
[1:03:22] to God hallelujah when they brought it
[1:03:25] down they could not put it back in the
[1:03:27] air they put everybody up in a hospital
[1:03:29] minute
[1:03:30] in a hotel and here comes a prophet at
[1:03:32] the hotel room the next morning walking
[1:03:34] down the street bother by being led by
[1:03:36] the Spirit of God the spirit states has
[1:03:39] to keep walking just keep walking and
[1:03:41] you know a song the Prophet was a man
[1:03:44] was singing the same song that brother
[1:03:47] solomon brought me up home Amen I'm so
[1:03:50] glad that I can say I'm one of him a
[1:03:53] matter that's he's singing to get into
[1:03:55] the spirit walking into a neighborhood
[1:03:58] that he said I'm not sure I should be
[1:03:59] here but I feel the Spirit of God
[1:04:02] telling me to keep walking he gets down
[1:04:07] there as his crossing as he's walking
[1:04:09] down the street and just singing in the
[1:04:10] spirit there's a latest in tonight that
[1:04:13] she's so sure she heard from God she'd
[1:04:16] witness to that side by the road service
[1:04:18] on the inside dying but she's standing

[1:04:25] comfort here come brother ran and
[1:04:30] walking down the street oh my now I
[1:04:33] wonder what the Lord showed her because
[1:04:36] brother Brennaman tell us all that he
[1:04:38] just said the briefcase but I think the
[1:04:40] Lord might have showed her a little bit
[1:04:41] more because of the neighborhood she was
[1:04:44] in she knew would have been a little
[1:04:46] strange for a certain man to be walking
[1:04:47] in that neighborhood do you get what I'm
[1:04:49] saying
[1:04:51] I think God showed her a little bit more
[1:04:53] if she could see the briefcase she can
[1:04:55] also see the me praise cops God works on
[1:05:00] both things but here here she's standing
[1:05:03] there and he's just singing I'm so glad
[1:05:05] I can sing with him and and why are you

[1:27:37] I'm so glad we've got a message that
[1:27:39] makes the word live hallelujah
[1:27:48] amen I want to just maybe skip here and
[1:27:57] to just another woman God brought a
[1:28:03] comfort God brought her comfort this
[1:28:07] this woman we find her and and and as I
[1:28:10] I read to you Isaiah 66 13 but what I
[1:28:15] didn't tell you is that that scripture
[1:28:18] is connected a man to second Corinthians
[1:28:22] chapter 1 verse 3 and 4 and let's read
[1:28:26] that because a few weeks ago we heard a
[1:28:30] message from that scripture God just
[1:28:37] brings angles on his word I'm gonna tell
[1:28:41] you that God God uses angles and here in
[1:28:44] 2nd Corinthians 1 verse 3 and 4 blessed
[1:28:47] be God even the father of our Lord Jesus
[1:28:50] Christ the father of mercies and the God
[1:28:53] of all comfort who comforts us in all
[1:28:57] our tribulation that we may be able to
[1:29:00] comfort them which are in any trouble by
[1:29:04] the comfort wherewith we ourselves are
[1:29:06] confident of God and what we heard a few
[1:29:09] weeks ago by our precious precious
[1:29:10] brother Troy is that this message that
[1:29:13] God has given us has brought us comfort
[1:29:17] even in the midst of a pandemic we got a
[1:29:20] comfort Amen we and that when we read
[1:29:24] scriptures about it it shall not come
[1:29:25] now well if everybody want to clean that
[1:29:27] but know that that that's what people
[1:29:30] that's dwelling in the secret place of
[1:29:31] the Most High right so when we know
[1:29:33] where we're dwelling we know we got a a
[1:29:35] a a we got the reveal word for our day
[1:29:38] then we can comfort people with that hey
[1:29:41] man we're comfort about a word of God
[1:29:43] we're confident by what God says
[1:29:45] this bird here is a woman that I want to
[1:29:48] just read about here in Scripture now
[1:29:51] let me just tell you a little bit about
[1:29:52] her before we read about her brother
[1:29:56] Branham said in one place
[1:29:57] he says she must have been an honorable
[1:29:59] woman I won't I won't read the full
[1:30:01] quote I'm just gonna read part that says
[1:30:03] she must be an honorable woman she must
[1:30:05] have been the type of woman that Elijah
[1:30:07] was a man I loved the way he put this he
[1:30:12] says she must have been a been the type
[1:30:15] of woman that Elijah was a man because
[1:30:20] he said the reason he said is because
[1:30:21] God wouldn't send his prophet to this
[1:30:23] woman's house if she was a dishonourable
[1:30:26] woman so she might not have been a
[1:30:29] prophetess but the life that she live
[1:30:32] the same way
[1:30:33] Elijah lived a life that was close to
[1:30:35] God this woman lived a life that was
[1:30:37] close to God that that their spirits
[1:30:39] could connect hallelujah
[1:30:43] she was a spirit too warming she was a
[1:30:46] woman going through and suffering on
[1:30:48] behalf of others here she is in a
[1:30:51] situation where the entire city is in a
[1:30:56] drought that the country is in a drought

[1:31:08] you know what's going through this chick
[1:31:10] out she sees a widowed woman she has one
[1:31:12] boy and she gets to a point where she
[1:31:15] has her last and say brother branham say
[1:31:17] there was many days that she would just
[1:31:19] try to put that baby to sleep even
[1:31:21] though she knew that he was in having
[1:31:23] hunger pangs and like this boy says you
[1:31:26] know I know what the boy going through
[1:31:27] it said maybe sometimes she'd get up and
[1:31:30] look in the mirror and see how her face

[1:31:34] different when she had food but now she

[1:32:50] coming no doubt I mean I read this from
[1:32:54] Freddie this is in be starting of God
[1:32:55] paragraph he 19 a man he night II - 19

[1:33:55] please Collin says when you plan
[1:33:59] everything that you know how to omit
[1:34:03] every requirement that God has required
[1:34:06] that's where faith takes hold cuz she
[1:34:10] came to know more you don't get all the
[1:34:12] talking you don't need all the pacing at
[1:34:15] night Reed's got chewed on had your
[1:34:17] sleepless night but today God wants to
[1:34:20] bring you glory to God you can go to
[1:34:24] sleep because God is bringing you
[1:34:25] comfort I'm gonna stay right there says
[1:34:29] that's where faith takes home that's
[1:34:31] where faith comes in if you've met every
[1:34:34] requirement that God required you to do
[1:34:36] then sometimes God tests your faith to
[1:34:41] see what requirement that God requires
[1:34:43] you to do sets up then sometimes God
[1:34:46] tests your faith to see what kind of
[1:34:47] reaction you have on your action there's
[1:34:49] paragraph 819 since God God will test
[1:34:53] your faith to see what kind of reaction
[1:34:56] you have on your action God want to see
[1:35:00] what your reaction gonna be even now
[1:35:02] like like I told you
[1:35:03] you know when had Iraq was there in the
[1:35:05] parental reaction was that nothing about
[1:35:08] the truth
[1:35:09] hallelujah don't allow the devil to get
[1:35:13] you so wrapped up in your problem in
[1:35:15] your feelings that you miss your promise
[1:35:19] let me say it again don't allow the
[1:35:21] devil to get you so wrapped up in your
[1:35:23] feelings that you miss your promise
[1:35:26] hallelujah alright when you come to
[1:35:29] church put all that to the side you
[1:35:30] don't know what God I speak to you and
[1:35:32] all it takes is one word to turn your
[1:35:34] situation around glory to God says it
[1:35:39] says God tests your faith to see what
[1:35:41] kind of reaction you have on your action
[1:35:44] oh he's good at that it just it just
[1:35:47] proves whether you really believe
[1:35:49] what you think you believe see the test
[1:35:52] is there to really prove whether you
[1:35:56] believe what you think you believe I
[1:35:59] know you've been saying you believe it
[1:36:01] but let the tests come and it's gonna
[1:36:03] show what you really believe your
[1:36:05] actions doing the tests tell us what's
[1:36:09] really there the Hebrew boys their
[1:36:15] actions during the test look here's what
[1:36:17] we could say man we see you eating that
[1:36:19] fire up seven times Harlan
[1:36:20] our God can deliver we didn't read about
[1:36:23] it we don't heard about it he can
[1:36:25] deliver now but if he choose not to
[1:36:27] deliver I want y'all to write in this
[1:36:30] book that they did not bow now take us
[1:36:33] home down to the fire all three I'm went
[1:36:36] on down see their actions at a time of
[1:36:38] the test show what was what was really
[1:36:40] in them and your actions during the
[1:36:41] midst of the test shows what's really
[1:36:43] inside of you hallelujah I mean I don't
[1:36:46] have time to read it all but brother
[1:36:48] Brandon made a statement in this message
[1:36:49] you can go back and listen to it be
[1:36:51] certain of God he says you know what we
[1:36:53] need to learn how to do is be steal they
[1:36:58] say that that's what we need to learn
[1:36:59] how to do it just just be steal don't
[1:37:01] get all worked up say when actually he
[1:37:03] said the walls of Jericho did not come
[1:37:05] down and today got steel he said not
[1:37:08] when it was marching that's not when the
[1:37:10] walls came down it's actually when they
[1:37:11] stop marching
[1:37:12] oh y'all didn't get that it wasn't when
[1:37:16] they were marching that the walls came
[1:37:17] down it's when they stop marching
[1:37:19] that the walls came down so when you
[1:37:21] stop worrying when you stop marching
[1:37:24] when you stop crying when you stop
[1:37:26] whining when you stop complaining your
[1:37:29] walls will come down we gotta learn the
[1:37:34] peace deal here the Prophet tells us
[1:37:39] about this lady and and the beautiful
[1:37:42] thing is is that he he was saying in the
[1:37:45] same message be stricken God is saying
[1:37:47] that you know she was going out she said
[1:37:48] I can't keep this boy
[1:37:49] hungry like this the more I didn't put
[1:37:52] him off for a good while but I'm out to
[1:37:53] get his boy this last cake say we gotta
[1:37:56] eat this we don't die say I'm gonna go
[1:37:59] outside I'm gonna get myself two sticks
[1:38:02] and I'm gonna bring these sticks and
[1:38:04] I'ma make this fire i'ma bake this cake
[1:38:07] I got a little bit more water left we
[1:38:10] gonna die now it was already other folk
[1:38:12] dying all around them right other folk
[1:38:14] that was a man if I can just use this
[1:38:17] way they were they were impacted by the
[1:38:18] pandemic the drought but here this woman

[1:38:31] couldn't get comfort is I got to do what
[1:38:33] God God asks of me and she she had a
[1:38:36] faith she believed God so here she goes
[1:38:38] out brother branham said God was working
[1:38:40] on both ends
[1:38:41] cuz he told a prophet by a vision and
[1:38:44] when his water was no longer flowing
[1:38:48] through the brook he said I commanded a
[1:38:51] widow woman to sustain you for the next
[1:38:54] feast for in the next season your life
[1:38:55] now brother Branham said God showed the
[1:38:58] Prophet a vision and he showed the
[1:39:00] Prophet that this woman would have two
[1:39:02] sticks in my hand so if he went to her
[1:39:06] house and the lady picked up three or
[1:39:08] four sticks that's not the woman this
[1:39:11] woman got to have two sticks and God is
[1:39:13] working on both in so when it gets down
[1:39:15] and he sees the lady are going around
[1:39:18] the yard with two sticks now say brother
[1:39:20] Branham God God I brother Branham say
[1:39:22] that God even showed the Prophet how you
[1:39:24] know she was she really won't don't have
[1:39:26] much but yet even in this state I
[1:39:28] commanded her to sustain you and when
[1:39:31] you get that you're gonna realize she
[1:39:33] got that much she gonna tell you this
[1:39:34] but I still commanded her to sustain you
[1:39:38] why can the Bible say I commanded her
[1:39:40] because this woman was worrying waiting
[1:39:43] on one thing hallelujah the one this one
[1:39:47] was waiting on the one word that she
[1:39:49] needed to hear that would change the
[1:39:50] situation was thus saith the Lord that
[1:39:54] says the Lord changed anything

[1:40:01] to hear thus saith the Lord
[1:40:03] look don't play with me don't play with

[1:40:28] that they don't come to pass and all the
[1:40:31] faith that I put into it
[1:40:33] man I got a problem that say the Lord
[1:40:36] means everything to me

[1:44:04] this
[1:44:04] this is a rare very lengthy quote and
[1:44:07] then I just want to read two other
[1:44:08] quotes and then I'll bring this to a
[1:44:10] close I don't I think okay we should be
[1:44:13] good this is not a message be certain of
[1:44:15] God and this is a paragraph II - 34 this
[1:44:19] this this this man got comfort
[1:44:25] from a visitation from his mama after
[1:44:27] she had passed away see it's something
[1:44:30] about when mama tell you something when
[1:44:32] mama do this but especially if mama's
[1:44:34] lived a certain life before you you can
[1:44:36] take confident what she's saying look at
[1:44:38] what happened here in this story there's
[1:44:41] some time ago I was over in a little
[1:44:44] city in Arkansas about 15 years ago not
[1:44:46] quite that long I'd say 12 years ago
[1:44:49] they have a terrible segregation in
[1:44:51] Arkansas in and I've been into a little
[1:44:54] church and a policeman helped me and an
[1:44:57] out now praise the Lord brother Ram say
[1:45:00] they had a terrible segregation in
[1:45:01] Arkansas say I've been into a little
[1:45:04] church and the police and helped me in
[1:45:06] and out and I was coming out of the
[1:45:08] church and I could hear someone saying
[1:45:11] mercy mercy
[1:45:12] I thought where is that coming from and
[1:45:17] I looked over to my left standing over
[1:45:19] to one side a Negro man way out from the
[1:45:22] white people he had his little old cap
[1:45:24] in his hand hollering mercy mercy and
[1:45:27] something struck me that wants that that
[1:45:33] man wants to talk to me and I said said
[1:45:37] to the policeman I said I want to go
[1:45:39] over and see that man he said mr. Branum
[1:45:42] you can't do that you start trouble here
[1:45:45] in Arkansas said you can't do that he
[1:45:47] said we just can't let you do that I
[1:45:50] said but the Holy Spirit's
[1:45:52] telling me to go he said well brother
[1:45:56] Branham you'll start a race riot hey man
[1:46:00] I'm gonna just inject this here before I
[1:46:04] go further there is so much stuff
[1:46:06] happening in our country to create
[1:46:08] division and I want to encourage our
[1:46:11] Saints when stuff come up if there's so
[1:46:13] many things I was telling telling my
[1:46:15] wife there's so many things you know we

[1:46:19] died because some people chased him in
[1:46:21] his neighborhood and all this other
[1:46:22] stuff and and when that happens

[1:46:29] spirits when we do that

[1:46:36] keep it to yourself right try to keep it
[1:46:39] to yourself because sometimes what you

[1:46:47] something just because you cry out about

[1:53:33] mother's day so out of paragraph 87 and
[1:53:36] mother's day unit I want to say mothers
[1:53:40] you might see your families are not
[1:53:42] where you want them to be but I want to
[1:53:46] encourage you this morning God's gonna
[1:53:48] fix it God will fix it remember comfort
[1:53:52] means the easing or alleviation of a
[1:53:56] person's feelings so sometimes you feel
[1:53:58] man I don't know about this this time
[1:54:00] went wrong that done went wrong this
[1:54:01] ain't right that you know those feelings
[1:54:03] God gonna bring you comfort in the midst
[1:54:05] of that he's gonna relieve the grief
[1:54:07] he's gonna relieve the distress that's
[1:54:09] what he does when he brings us comfort I
[1:54:11] want to tell you this one the confidence
[1:54:13] come the Holy Spirit the confident has
[1:54:16] come to relieve you of your distress
[1:54:17] take God at His Word look at what the
[1:54:20] Prophet says here in this message
[1:54:21] mother's day says then as we see him and
[1:54:28] we will not be as we are now we'll know
[1:54:33] how to love him more will not stand back
[1:54:36] with a little fear because we'll be like
[1:54:39] him as well he will be more of a
[1:54:43] relative to us than he is now we'll
[1:54:47] understand him better because we're so
[1:54:50] far away in the mortal bodies then we
[1:54:53] have a body like his glorious body we'll
[1:54:55] know how to work
[1:54:57] and when we see what the presence of his
[1:55:01] being has done to us changed us the old
[1:55:04] back young all the deform straighten out
[1:55:07] Oh we'll understand then why his power
[1:55:11] he willed us the questions that's been
[1:55:14] in our mind how can he do it what with
[1:55:20] this somehow mysteriously they'll all
[1:55:23] fade away the knots that's been tied in
[1:55:28] the back of our minds will it be this
[1:55:30] how can it be somehow another majestic
[1:55:33] fingers were just untangle unravel those
[1:55:37] knots and it'll all fade into this one
[1:55:41] big crown of love mama you might have
[1:55:43] had a loved one pull away from the
[1:55:45] message you're praying for you're gonna
[1:55:48] be comforted because majestic fingers
[1:55:51] got on untangle and unravel the knots I
[1:55:57] say a man to the words
[1:55:59] majestic fingers were untangled and
[1:56:03] unravel the knots it'll all fade into
[1:56:06] one big crown of love then we shall see
[1:56:10] him then we shall be like him
[1:56:13] then we shall worship him then we shall
[1:56:17] see mother and as God wants her mother
[1:56:21] would not be complete there without her
[1:56:28] family that's love God saying this is
[1:56:32] this you know I'm just reminded of this
[1:56:35] statement that the Prophet said and some
[1:56:37] people just only give it to the Prophet
[1:56:39] see i'ma tell you like this the Bible
[1:56:41] say the secret things belonging to God
[1:56:43] but once they are revealed they belong
[1:56:47] to us and one of the things that God
[1:56:49] told her prophecy everything that you
[1:56:51] love and everything they'd ever loved
[1:56:53] you it'll be waiting for you on the
[1:56:56] other side see once it was revealed not
[1:56:59] that belong to us and I remember my
[1:57:02] brother he told my daddy that my dad was
[1:57:05] sick and he told my daddy he says daddy
[1:57:09] remember the Prophet said
[1:57:10] everything she ever loved and everything
[1:57:13] that ever loved you you'll see on the
[1:57:15] other side my daddy kind of shook
[1:57:17] himself out of his sickness I'm looking
[1:57:20] for you praise the Lord and I'm gonna
[1:57:25] tell Mama's shake yourself from whatever
[1:57:27] it is you're going through this promise
[1:57:28] is to you and to your children those
[1:57:31] that affirmed let God bring comfort to
[1:57:33] you through his word everything that you
[1:57:35] love look he says this you say mama
[1:57:37] mother would not be complete there
[1:57:40] without a family because the greatest
[1:57:44] time of all of her life is to see the
[1:57:47] children around the table and all of
[1:57:49] them healthy and happy and to see her
[1:57:52] pour the coffee and whatever she does
[1:57:54] and fix his supper and her and dad sat
[1:57:56] down why that's the happiest time in
[1:57:59] Mama's life see her kiddies Oh at home
[1:58:04] says now don't be the missing don't be
[1:58:08] don't be missing that day let the great
[1:58:11] chain of your family be hooked together
