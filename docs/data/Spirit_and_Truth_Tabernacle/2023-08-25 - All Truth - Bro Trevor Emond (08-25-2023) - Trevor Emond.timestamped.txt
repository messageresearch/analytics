[27:52] [Music]
[27:57] Hallelujah
[28:00] it's good to be back to my Florida home
[28:04] [Music]
[28:06] a little while
[28:07] but
[28:09] you know
[28:10] we just always pick right back up where
[28:12] we left off
[28:14] amen
[28:16] so
[28:18] praise the Lord if you would turn with
[28:20] me
[28:22] to John chapter 16.
[28:25] and verse 13.
[28:39] I see where
[28:41] we're interpreting in the back so I'll
[28:44] I'll try to be slow enough
[28:48] all right so John chapter 16 and verse
[28:51] 13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth
[28:55] has come
[28:56] he will guide you into all truth
[28:59] for he shall not speak of himself but
[29:02] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[29:04] speak
[29:05] and he will show you things to come
[29:08] so when the spirit of Truth has come
[29:11] he will guide you into all
[29:15] truth
[29:17] okay so I want to look at also
[29:19] Revelations chapter 10 and verse 7 very
[29:21] familiar you probably don't have to turn
[29:24] there
[29:25] but in the days of the voice of the
[29:27] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[29:29] sound the mystery of God should be
[29:31] finished as he's declared to his
[29:33] servants the prophets so if there's
[29:35] mystery there's truth in those Mysteries
[29:37] but but but the spirit of Truth is going
[29:40] to come and reveal all
[29:43] of those Mysteries
[29:45] it's gonna it's going to have to take
[29:47] the spirit of Truth
[29:50] to open these Mysteries to to reveal
[29:53] Mysteries to us so that's what the holy
[29:56] spirit is is going to come and do I want
[29:59] to speak on a subject of all truth if
[30:02] you would just bow your heads for a word
[30:04] of Prayer
[30:05] Heavenly Father
[30:07] Lord you're good to us
[30:09] we know you love us
[30:11] we know that you are the great one
[30:14] the Eternal Heavenly Father
[30:17] you are the one who brought to us truth
[30:20] oh God
[30:21] and through so many ways Lord you have
[30:24] done this
[30:25] you sent us your word oh God and we have
[30:28] this book we call the Bible Lord
[30:31] he sent us prophets throughout all ages
[30:33] Lord to manifest and live this truth to
[30:36] prophesy this truth
[30:38] you sent your son Jesus Christ to fully
[30:41] embody
[30:44] godhead and fully embody the character
[30:46] and heart
[30:48] of God lord we are we are just
[30:51] overwhelmed by all the expression that
[30:53] you've given to us and father because
[30:55] you had a great plan in your mind
[30:58] because you wanted to call out a gentile
[31:00] bride
[31:02] because you wanted to
[31:05] reverse what Satan did in your Eden
[31:08] and you wanted to come and pull out a
[31:10] people out of his Eden
[31:13] Lord so you hid things
[31:15] but Lord you prophesied and told us that
[31:19] in these days it would be open to us
[31:22] again and we're so thankful for it Lord
[31:26] because Lord we see that it gives us not
[31:30] just truth Lord as such not just
[31:33] knowledge father
[31:35] but Lord it it reveals to us the
[31:37] character and heart of God more fully
[31:40] than we've ever seen and are known it
[31:41] before
[31:42] and it is that Lord that truth
[31:45] that moves our hearts so passionately oh
[31:48] God
[31:49] so we bless the name of the Lord Jesus
[31:51] Christ

[32:10] that we have together in the name of the
[32:13] Lord Jesus Christ we ask you
[32:14] amen amen you may be seated
[32:21] so it's as I've said it's so good to
[32:24] return
[32:26] amen be here
[32:28] and just always love to come down and be
[32:32] apart and
[32:34] yeah I think brother Jack and I met in
[32:36] 2001.
[32:40] Zion was six weeks old
[32:43] he's now 22.
[32:47] he has a girlfriend that he's
[32:49] pretty serious about
[32:52] you know
[32:54] time just moves on you know
[32:58] so
[33:00] um but I think you know brother Jack I
[33:02] would say his um
[33:04] would be the first Minister that that
[33:05] really invited me to come and and
[33:08] sent me a plane ticket and said come you
[33:11] know others may be well if you're here
[33:14] maybe we'll give you a shot but
[33:16] but brother Jack emailed plane tickets
[33:20] it's just um
[33:25] I'll never forget that moment
[33:27] it's like oh
[33:30] going to Florida
[33:33] you know when you're
[33:35] I guess 22-23 you know and someone asked
[33:39] you to come preach that's a pretty big
[33:41] deal for a for a young minister so been
[33:43] a lot of water under the bridge since
[33:45] then and and
[33:47] um just this just way of testimony since
[33:49] we're all friends and family here you
[33:51] know just as brother Jack was commenting
[33:53] on
[33:54] just how the Lord has been taking my
[33:57] Ministry and I'm totally out of days off
[33:59] um
[34:00] they called me with website troubles
[34:02] today I was like praise the Lord I'm not
[34:04] taking a vacation day for that you
[34:07] called me
[34:08] you're paying me so I thought it was a
[34:11] blessing but
[34:13] um
[34:13] you know
[34:15] um just just how the Lord has been using
[34:17] me I've been in Africa and just many
[34:19] different places over the last few years
[34:23] brother job I think some of you know
[34:25] brother job was giving me a bad time I
[34:27] was trying to give him a bad time about
[34:28] how many times he you know flies from
[34:31] Europe to America and he's like wait a
[34:32] second how many times have you been to
[34:34] Europe in the last 12 months and I was
[34:37] like this calendar year it's only
[34:40] it's only been once
[34:42] but you know we we were in Italy and
[34:44] Norway and you know I've been in Norway
[34:46] twice in the last 12 months and and just
[34:48] preached a big Camp there I uh preached
[34:51] at the youth camp in Indiana and just
[34:53] just been amazing um to be used at the
[34:56] Lord and I'm so thankful and
[34:58] and uh
[34:59] just for the doors that he's opening and
[35:01] I'm just trying to be faithful and be a
[35:03] blessing and that's what I've always
[35:04] wanted to do is just be a blessing
[35:05] wherever I'm at so
[35:07] and um I sometime I'm going to send
[35:11] um my father maybe a sermon of yours
[35:14] brother Jack maybe you tell me which one
[35:16] you think is the best one and then we
[35:18] can see if maybe my dad
[35:20] hey
[35:23] maybe he'd think you were better
[35:29] it's just a thought I don't know
[35:32] but we
[35:34] we certainly miss him and always enjoyed
[35:37] having him with us and
[35:39] so all right maybe we should now go to
[35:42] the word but it just so good to be back
[35:45] with you all
[35:50] sir brother Brenham and I'm going to
[35:51] take quite a bit of our thought tonight
[35:53] from that message the seventh angel is
[35:56] winding up all the Mysteries
[35:58] that's laying loose ended
[36:01] all out through these denominations and
[36:04] organizations and denominations the
[36:06] seventh angel gathers them up and
[36:07] finishes the entire mystery now I want
[36:10] to go maybe go back one and I just want
[36:13] to point out that that nowhere are we
[36:15] ever saying that there was no truth
[36:17] in denominations
[36:20] there was truth throughout these
[36:22] denominations many of them had much of
[36:26] the truth as brother Branham even said
[36:28] many of them were probing at it and and
[36:30] had different things about it but but
[36:33] but we are now in the days where the
[36:36] spirit of of Truth has come to guide you
[36:39] into all truth
[36:42] so the holy spirit is his intention is
[36:44] to come not just into part but into all
[36:46] truth so we believe that the Holy Spirit
[36:49] coming in our lives shows us and brings
[36:51] us and guides us into the place where
[36:54] all truth is so so these denominations
[36:57] had some and I don't disregard that at
[37:00] all and I just want you to to know that
[37:02] you know tonight as I bring this thought
[37:04] out I have no disregard to to
[37:07] denominations but I have full regard to
[37:11] the full truth and it is the full truth
[37:14] that I want to walk in
[37:16] and so so that's that's what we're just
[37:18] looking at and that's what we believe
[37:20] this message has done is not to bring us
[37:23] into a super denomination or a better
[37:26] one or blah blah blah like no this isn't
[37:29] a group thing
[37:30] this is this is a word of God that calls
[37:33] us out
[37:35] of group things
[37:37] into a he wanted to to bring us into his
[37:40] true spiritual relationship between God
[37:43] and man and so so so how is he going to
[37:47] do that he's going to do that by giving
[37:49] us all truth
[37:52] because if we have all truth and we know
[37:54] the very heart of God
[37:57] that's what changes us
[38:00] then the structures don't you know you
[38:02] don't you won't need brother Jack is a
[38:04] pastor to say not that you won't want
[38:06] him but you won't need him to say now
[38:08] what's your name young man Joseph I
[38:10] should have known that I'm sorry now
[38:12] Joseph
[38:13] you realize you've been doing these
[38:14] things wrong
[38:15] you need to stop doing all that
[38:17] and this and this and this and this but
[38:20] when Joseph catches the vision in
[38:22] Revelation for himself
[38:24] of the character and the Heart of God
[38:27] it's going it's going to captivate his
[38:30] mind so much
[38:32] that that it's like like everything else
[38:34] is just gonna be like
[38:36] no I don't want that
[38:38] because the things that are truth are so
[38:41] much more moving
[38:44] all right so
[38:46] all right so we can go forward
[38:48] um
[38:49] uh yeah we can go go on to Matthew
[38:51] Chapter 13 there and so I just wanna so
[38:55] so as we look at this at this message
[38:58] this serves as this the sign of the end
[39:00] and this will be the last message to the
[39:02] second to last message that brother
[39:03] Branham preaches in 1962 but it's the
[39:07] last Sunday morning and he knows he's
[39:09] about to go to Arizona
[39:11] and he's taking it out of Revelations T
[39:13] starts in Revelations 10 and he's in 10
[39:15] 1 he's in 10 7. he's going all the way
[39:17] through Revelation 10. he is talking
[39:20] about that the Lord himself would come
[39:23] with a cloud now he doesn't know that
[39:25] there's going to be a picture of a cloud
[39:27] taken later on he just knows that I'm
[39:30] preaching this and I feel drawn to
[39:33] Arizona and something is going to happen
[39:35] I've seen this Vision I'm going to be
[39:37] picking a over all these different
[39:38] things that we're all aware of right but
[39:41] what he's but but he's tying this event
[39:44] that that this is this is going to be
[39:47] the tying up of all of these Mysteries
[39:50] that's why he's in Revelations 10 and
[39:53] that's why we get down to Revelations 10
[39:55] 7. so so but then he's going to be
[39:57] showing us doctrines
[40:00] that we that this ministry
[40:03] is going to be bringing to us
[40:06] and we want to look at those doctrines
[40:09] and what I what we're going to see and
[40:11] what I'm going to try to show is I'm I'm
[40:13] going to try to show a picture of this
[40:15] is what it looks like without message
[40:18] Doctrine
[40:20] wow and this and we'll try to keep you
[40:23] know that will be not message doctrine
[40:25] of this over here will be message
[40:26] Doctrine try to keep the sides right God
[40:30] but not that we want to you know just
[40:33] show a picture of Doctrine
[40:36] that's God
[40:38] doctrines
[40:40] make sure they're right brother
[40:43] because you're a message believer all
[40:45] right so you should have the right
[40:46] doctrines this is what it should look
[40:48] like okay no
[40:51] right but but what I want to show you is
[40:54] that with the right doctrines the the
[40:57] picture that we have of Jesus Christ is
[41:00] the most compelling and wonderful
[41:03] picture of Jesus Christ that you could
[41:06] ever think of
[41:07] [Music]
[41:09] and so so that it is the message that's
[41:11] not just rules and regulations you know
[41:13] in Pentecost but harder
[41:18] I mean that hit hard on some people
[41:21] you know it's not that
[41:24] right but it's that these doctrines that
[41:26] the denominations had tying loose ended
[41:29] they were laying out there
[41:31] but when we've pulled them all together
[41:33] the picture that we have of Jesus Christ
[41:36] is amazing
[41:39] amen so so that's what we're we're about
[41:42] this evening now so as just kind of as
[41:45] we we just kind of slowly bring our way
[41:47] into this I want to look at Matthew
[41:49] chapter 13.
[41:52] and and we have slides for you but I'm
[41:54] going to also turn there
[41:56] um but Matthew Chapter 13 and the
[41:58] disciples came and said unto him why
[42:01] speaketh thou unto them in parables
[42:04] he answered and said unto them because
[42:07] it is given unto you to know the
[42:09] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but
[42:11] to them it is not given now it is that
[42:14] this it is at this spot in the Bible
[42:16] that brother Brennan will be preaching
[42:18] in this message
[42:20] and he will be telling us he'll start
[42:23] listing Mysteries that Scofield had
[42:26] listed
[42:27] and then he'll go into Mysteries that
[42:29] his ministry
[42:30] has has has brought out so so he's this
[42:34] is the spot where he's tying those
[42:35] things in but but he says it says it is
[42:39] given unto you to know the mysteries of
[42:41] the Kingdom of Heaven
[42:42] but to them it is not given
[42:45] for whosoever hath to him shall be given
[42:48] but whosoever hath not from him shall be
[42:52] taken away even that he hath
[42:57] now
[42:58] now I struggled with this scripture as a
[43:00] kid
[43:01] maybe some of you do too
[43:04] because you have to you have to look at
[43:06] the scripture and go
[43:09] that's not fair
[43:15] why why why would God do this like is it
[43:19] your fault you don't have it like maybe
[43:21] God could give it to you and then he
[43:23] could then give you more but like
[43:26] seems unfair
[43:28] seems unfair therefore speak guide to
[43:30] them in Parables because they seeing see
[43:34] not and hearing they hear not neither do
[43:36] they understand and in them is fulfilled
[43:39] the prophecy of Messiahs which saith by
[43:42] hearing ye shall hear and shall not
[43:44] understand seeing ye shall see and shall
[43:48] not perceive for this people's heart is
[43:51] waxed gross their ears are dull of
[43:54] hearing and their eyes they have closed
[43:56] lest at any time they should see with
[43:59] their eyes and hear with their ears and
[44:02] should understand with their heart and
[44:04] should be converted and I should heal
[44:06] them but blessed are your eyes for they
[44:09] see and your ears for they hear
[44:12] for verily I say unto you many prophets
[44:15] and righteous men have desired to see
[44:17] those things which ye see and have not
[44:20] seen them and to hear those things which
[44:22] ye hear and have not heard them so if we
[44:25] can just I just I want to go back to
[44:26] verse 11 here
[44:28] and and just stay here for a minute
[44:30] because so I want to ask I want to ask
[44:33] us all a question
[44:35] does Jesus love
[44:37] everyone in the world
[44:40] and this is not a trick question
[44:42] okay I know I know I ask them but just
[44:45] Jesus did Jesus die for everyone
[44:49] does he love everyone
[44:52] absolutely he does
[44:54] he does he loves brother Jack stop
[44:56] laughing it's true
[45:01] God is love
[45:04] he died for everyone he's not willing
[45:07] that any should perish
[45:09] but that all should come to repentance
[45:15] is that the scripture
[45:17] not willing that any should perish but
[45:19] that all should come to repentance
[45:22] but
[45:25] when he's here in Matthew 13 and he's
[45:28] been preaching to everyone
[45:30] he's been doing it in parable
[45:35] and then the disciples come to him and
[45:38] ask a very fair question hey Jesus
[45:40] why are you talking comparables and
[45:43] Jesus says because to them
[45:46] is not given to know
[45:48] but to you it's given to know
[45:51] but Jesus you're gonna die on a cross
[45:54] soon for us and Them
[45:58] but yet you're
[46:01] all right like it's not just
[46:03] you know it's just not just scripture
[46:05] Jesus is participating in this thing
[46:09] Jesus is saying you know then you know
[46:12] we're just okay this group over here
[46:13] we're not going to have anybody in this
[46:14] room you know like over here no
[46:18] I'm preaching to them in parables
[46:21] because if they see they might see
[46:24] things and
[46:25] they shouldn't because of Isaiah's
[46:27] prophecy if they hear it they might hear
[46:30] it and they shouldn't because of
[46:31] Isaiah's prophecy
[46:33] wow what
[46:36] Jesus
[46:37] what are you doing here you love these
[46:40] people but you're speaking to them in
[46:42] Parables and to these you're revealing
[46:44] it plainly
[46:45] but why are you doing that it's almost
[46:48] Jesus it's almost as if you already know
[46:51] there's two groups of people on this
[46:54] Earth
[46:55] it's as if you knew there was two groups
[46:57] of people on this Earth and you were
[46:59] talking to one in a way you knew they
[47:02] would catch things in another you knew
[47:04] they wouldn't
[47:06] so you already know there's two groups
[47:08] of people
[47:12] so I would just like us to take in our
[47:15] minds for a moment now this concept
[47:17] right here in Matthew chapter 13.
[47:20] and go and ask your Baptist friends sir
[47:24] ask your denominational friends could
[47:27] you explain that to me
[47:30] is there a Bible Doctrine already in the
[47:33] Bible
[47:34] that tells me why Jesus is doing this
[47:39] where does Jesus get that there's two
[47:41] groups of people
[47:47] I don't know what the answer will be
[47:50] because I don't there's there's only one
[47:52] answer for me
[47:54] he knows about Genesis chapter 2. and
[47:59] Genesis chapter 3
[48:01] Jesus knows about serpency
[48:05] so Jesus knows
[48:08] there are two groups of people
[48:12] and if we're honest with ourselves so
[48:14] did the Pharisees
[48:17] because there I believe it's John
[48:19] chapter 8 and they're struggling and
[48:21] they're having problems and Jesus is
[48:23] like they're
[48:24] the reason you can't you can't
[48:27] understand my speech why do you not
[48:29] understand my speech it's because
[48:31] there's nothing in you to hear me with
[48:35] because you're of your father the devil
[48:39] so the reason they can't hear is because
[48:42] they have a different father
[48:45] and the Pharisees themselves response
[48:49] we be not born of fornication
[48:53] they themselves know about serpent C
[48:57] they know about Original Sin
[49:01] so Jesus and and so and we'll get into
[49:03] this in a bit but while we're here you
[49:05] know John chapter 3 Nicodemus comes to
[49:08] Jesus
[49:08] [Music]
[49:10] and Jesus is like you you're gonna need
[49:13] to be born again
[49:16] because the way you were born was wrong
[49:19] amen
[49:21] are you a master in Israel
[49:24] and you don't know this
[49:30] you see Nicodemus my birth my first
[49:33] birth
[49:34] there was no problems
[49:36] because it was spoken word
[49:40] but Nicodemus your birth
[49:43] it had a problem
[49:45] because it came the same way that it
[49:47] came in the Garden of Eden
[49:50] and you were born in sin
[49:52] you were shaped in iniquity you came
[49:54] into the world speaking lies
[49:56] because you weren't spoken word born
[49:59] you were born by sex and this is a
[50:02] problem this means that's why you must
[50:04] be born again and we'll we'll get back
[50:05] into that but here Jesus is he is he is
[50:09] actively participating
[50:12] in the fact there are there are two
[50:14] groups of people
[50:16] and that that should seem very unfair
[50:19] that should seem like what but Jesus you
[50:21] love all of them but here's this is how
[50:23] you're you're working this it's because
[50:25] Jesus knows about serpent seed and
[50:29] serpent seed is the only way you can
[50:32] make Matthew 13 make sense
[50:37] otherwise
[50:40] Jesus is being arbitrary
[50:44] he's these people can these people can't
[50:47] well I mean
[50:50] how do I get onto the other side like
[50:54] Jesus here's here's some bread could I
[50:57] it's not no no so so he's not arbitrary
[51:01] there there are there are just there are
[51:02] two groups of people that exist on this
[51:05] earth now we understand their spiritual
[51:07] implications of that now like you know
[51:10] look when it was Cain and Seth
[51:14] one was a child of God and one was a
[51:17] child of the serpent and it was really
[51:19] easy to figure out which was which
[51:22] but since Noah we don't we don't have
[51:24] that
[51:26] right now there's a spiritual element
[51:28] now but you don't need to start trying
[51:31] to you know go back in your genealogy
[51:33] and all of these things
[51:36] but do you hear the word of God
[51:41] amen amen all right so so let's continue
[51:44] on now I want to go
[51:46] um
[51:47] maybe to slide 18 there sister the
[51:50] beginning of the the next quote there
[51:53] um is this the sign of the end sir
[51:54] that's some of the Mysteries now as I
[51:57] said this that we right there where we
[51:58] were in Matthew 13.
[52:01] Schofield has all of these Mysteries
[52:03] listed and he reads all of these things
[52:05] and many of them about the Catholic
[52:07] church in Rome and different things like
[52:08] that
[52:09] he reads through those
[52:11] and then he says that's some of the
[52:14] Mysteries that this Angel is supposed to
[52:17] wind up
[52:18] all the mystery all the mysteries of God
[52:22] may I say this with reverence not
[52:26] referring to myself
[52:27] but to referring to the angel of God
[52:31] the serpent seed that's been a mystery
[52:34] that's been hidden that's been a hidden
[52:36] Mystery all through the years the grace
[52:39] straightened out not disgrace but real
[52:44] true Grace
[52:46] no such a thing as an eternal burning
[52:49] hell you'll burn for millions of years
[52:51] but anything that was eternal had never
[52:54] a beginning or an end and hell was
[52:57] created
[52:58] all these Mysteries the mystery of the
[53:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost without
[53:03] sensation but the person of Christ
[53:05] performing in you the same works that he
[53:08] did the mystery of water baptism
[53:11] where the extreme trinitarianism has
[53:14] brought it into titles of Father Son and
[53:16] Holy Ghost and the Mystery of the
[53:18] godhead being fulfilled in the baptism
[53:21] of the name of Jesus Christ according to
[53:23] the Book of Revelations that the church
[53:25] in this time was to receive there is
[53:28] some of the Mysteries the pillar of fire
[53:31] returning back amen that's the thing
[53:33] that's supposed to take place and we see
[53:36] it
[53:37] oh how we could go on naming the
[53:40] Mysteries seeing that Pillar of Fire
[53:42] that led the children of Israel the same
[53:44] one that struck down Saul on his road
[53:47] down to Damascus and the same one coming
[53:50] with the same power doing the same
[53:53] things and revealing the same word
[53:55] staying word by word with the Bible so
[54:01] in no place is he saying he's referring
[54:03] to an angel he's referring to Mysteries
[54:06] that are going to come but he is also
[54:08] very very aware that he must stay word
[54:12] by word with the Bible because if it's
[54:14] not it's not true Revelation it's not
[54:18] all truth if it's not tying to the Bible
[54:21] so he's wanting to stay word by word
[54:24] with the Bible
[54:32] no problem
[54:36] I got it I was about to bring brother
[54:38] Jonathan up here
[54:41] he's he gets that for me sometimes that
[54:44] was so embarrassing we were in Africa
[54:45] preaching together
[54:48] and I had I was struggling with a
[54:49] shoulder issue and I could not open this
[54:52] bottle for nothing and it just
[54:58] tumbling tumbling for a brother
[55:02] all right we're staying so we got all
[55:03] these Mysteries
[55:05] and we're going to stay word by word
[55:07] with the Bible so now we can go and we
[55:10] want to look at the list here of all of
[55:12] these and we'll just you know serpent
[55:14] seed Grace straightened out no eternal
[55:16] hell baptism of the Holy Ghost without
[55:19] sensation water baptism in the name of
[55:21] Jesus Christ godhead
[55:24] so we're going to go through all of
[55:25] these in the next 35 minutes or so and
[55:29] and we're going to look and we're going
[55:31] to build this picture of Jesus Christ
[55:33] okay so starting here now with serpent
[55:37] seed and now we've we've kind of begun
[55:39] to already tease out some of some of how
[55:42] this matters and and it matters because
[55:45] we can begin to see the pattern of
[55:47] scripture and what's going on and we can
[55:50] see the way Jesus is ministering makes
[55:52] sense now
[55:54] and that he's not being arbitrarily
[55:56] choosing but that there is the truth
[55:59] that there are some that are and some
[56:02] that are not
[56:04] right
[56:05] so so then we can also see the Virgin
[56:09] birth was necessary and has meaning
[56:15] and it's because of serpent seed
[56:18] because because otherwise you just ask
[56:21] our denominational Christian friends why
[56:24] does Jesus need to come and be born as a
[56:27] virgin
[56:29] well you can say because the Bible says
[56:32] so
[56:34] true
[56:35] but is there is there a reason is is it
[56:38] like God doesn't just randomly doing
[56:40] things there's a there's a connection
[56:41] back to the mind and heart of God and
[56:44] all of this and the original way was
[56:47] spoken word the original it got let
[56:49] there be light and there was
[56:53] let there be a child and there was it
[56:56] was Jesus Christ
[56:58] right so so the word was spoken to Mary
[57:02] and Mary with a heart of Faith received
[57:04] it
[57:05] and had a child
[57:08] that was a spoken word child
[57:11] so the reason this this had to come was
[57:13] because of serpent seed was because the
[57:17] devil lied to to Eve and she took of the
[57:20] fruit and so and so and now now man is
[57:24] coming through a means that God allowed
[57:26] for but wasn't the original idea
[57:30] because it was all about the word and
[57:33] faith
[57:34] because your word is who you are and God
[57:37] wanting to reproduce himself
[57:42] has to come through the word right okay
[57:45] so that's a very cool picture and so so
[57:47] so we can look and we can say well the
[57:49] Virgin birth like well that's cool it's
[57:52] supernatural God does things
[57:53] Supernatural like there's all there's
[57:55] all kinds of reasons that we could say
[57:57] and yes we've understood those things
[57:58] but to understand that the word itself
[58:01] is the Original Seed
[58:04] that when God spoke it created life
[58:07] that's that is the point in the heart of
[58:09] God is because each seed brings of its
[58:13] own kind
[58:14] so what seed brings the Son of God
[58:17] there's only one seed that brings the
[58:19] son of God
[58:19] [Applause]
[58:21] it's Son of God seed what's what's Son
[58:23] of God seed word
[58:26] caught caught in the ground of Faith
[58:29] produces children of God because God is
[58:33] his word so the Virgin Birth has meaning
[58:36] because we're looking for a word birth
[58:39] not a sexual born birth
[58:43] and that's why you must be born again
[58:46] and you could ask Lord why do I have to
[58:48] be born again
[58:51] and Jesus could go to Nicodemus and say
[58:53] you've got to be born again don't why
[58:54] don't you understand this Nicodemus
[58:57] it's Jesus's first Doctrine
[59:00] you must be born again
[59:02] and we could go and we could ask
[59:04] denominational friends why do you have
[59:06] to be born again well because you know
[59:08] you need to be born into Jesus okay
[59:11] but but why like can't he he died for me
[59:15] his you know his blood covers is is is
[59:18] is the propitiation for my sins I I'm
[59:21] Justified because I believe on him why
[59:23] is it that I have isn't that enough
[59:26] shouldn't do why do why do I have to be
[59:28] born again what is this Born Again
[59:30] speech that we're even talking about
[59:32] because you must have a word birth
[59:36] in the same way that Jesus had a word
[59:40] birth
[59:42] and I I have been saying this in just
[59:44] every place that I've been Jesus was
[59:47] born
[59:49] we're born again
[59:51] when Jesus was born he was the firstborn
[59:56] among many Brethren the only way Jesus
[1:00:00] is going to be the firstborn among many
[1:00:03] Brethren is for there to be many
[1:00:05] Brethren to have a word born birth
[1:00:11] that didn't come through a sexual
[1:00:13] encounter but came because the word came
[1:00:17] to a heart of faith that said be it unto
[1:00:21] me
[1:00:22] according to your word
[1:00:24] [Applause]
[1:00:28] the Virgin birth makes sense because we
[1:00:32] understand serpent seed
[1:00:34] being born again makes sense because we
[1:00:38] understand serpency
[1:00:42] the consequence of your sin makes sense
[1:00:45] because we understand serpency
[1:00:48] that you have to die means the sin came
[1:00:52] in the Life production
[1:00:58] we also begin to see something that's
[1:01:00] very beautiful
[1:01:03] oh you better not even sit down brother
[1:01:04] Troy
[1:01:10] this concept
[1:01:13] shows us it's not about your works
[1:01:17] if it's about your birth
[1:01:22] is it about your performance
[1:01:25] is it about how good you're doing
[1:01:28] ye must be born again
[1:01:31] it didn't say ye must do better
[1:01:34] no is it you must be born again
[1:01:38] so if you're born again we expect that a
[1:01:41] word birth takes place and begins to
[1:01:45] produce and to grow into a son of God
[1:01:49] but but but production of of of works
[1:01:52] and performance metrics and how good are
[1:01:55] you on the scale
[1:01:58] it all falls away doesn't it
[1:02:00] it's either you have the right birth or
[1:02:02] you don't
[1:02:04] we do expect the right birth to produce
[1:02:07] something in your life
[1:02:10] but it is not about the works it is
[1:02:13] about the birth and I think that's very
[1:02:15] beautiful
[1:02:17] Hallelujah
[1:02:19] we also can begin to understand
[1:02:21] predestination
[1:02:23] because let's just face it
[1:02:27] like if there wasn't two groups of
[1:02:29] people being created in the garden
[1:02:32] what's predestination for
[1:02:35] how was not how is everyone not a son of
[1:02:38] God
[1:02:39] and how is everyone not predestinated
[1:02:42] everyone's name would have been there
[1:02:45] but no there was someone who came on the
[1:02:47] earth and was born on the Earth whose
[1:02:50] name was never written down on the Book
[1:02:53] of Life from the foundation of the world
[1:02:56] his name was Cain
[1:02:59] he was not in the mind of God he was not
[1:03:02] in the list of God
[1:03:04] so so so you can have Seth being
[1:03:07] predestinated and Cain is not
[1:03:09] predestinated because one was in the
[1:03:12] mind of God in the original plan of God
[1:03:16] and one was somebody else's son
[1:03:20] so predestination that it's in the Bible
[1:03:23] has to bring us back to serpent seed now
[1:03:26] we're going to continue on so that this
[1:03:28] whole sermon isn't just serpent seed but
[1:03:31] now we begin to and and all of these
[1:03:32] things begin to build on on one another
[1:03:34] is because now we can go to Grace
[1:03:36] straightened out and we can begin to
[1:03:38] understand that if it's so now we we get
[1:03:42] ourselves on very precarious place
[1:03:44] because now you know we can say well
[1:03:46] it's about your birth as I've just said
[1:03:48] and it's not about your performance and
[1:03:50] as I've just said and so now look hey am
[1:03:53] I not just saying then that you just
[1:03:55] have to have the right birth and then
[1:03:56] just go about your Merry way
[1:03:59] do whatever you want
[1:04:00] [Music]
[1:04:03] and and so so I've Been Told
[1:04:06] by by many Pentecostals like oh I see
[1:04:09] what it is you believe what oh what's
[1:04:12] the word um
[1:04:14] um yeah you believe in once saved always
[1:04:16] saved and that's almost always said in a
[1:04:19] negative connotation as in you you feel
[1:04:22] like you just get the Holy Ghost and
[1:04:23] boom done you can just go live however
[1:04:25] you want
[1:04:27] amen if I actually got the Holy Ghost
[1:04:31] and my desires changed
[1:04:34] then I'm going to live how I want
[1:04:37] and that's the point and that's what
[1:04:40] we're talking about is that is that this
[1:04:42] well and so now we get into godhead and
[1:04:44] you just can't separate these things but
[1:04:46] if he's actually like if the holy spirit
[1:04:48] is all that God is and lives on the
[1:04:50] inside of you that's change
[1:04:53] that's holding in lasting change and
[1:04:56] it's not just you trying to do the right
[1:04:58] Works to maintain your Christianity
[1:05:00] that's not what we're talking about but
[1:05:03] that the life of almighty God has come
[1:05:04] in and straightened my life out
[1:05:07] justification as though I've never done
[1:05:09] it and that brings into me also then a
[1:05:11] sanctification that prepares me for the
[1:05:13] baptism of the Holy Ghost like this is
[1:05:16] the process of Grace
[1:05:18] Grace is not merely forgiveness
[1:05:23] that's what we want Grace to be just
[1:05:24] Jesus died on the cross and you can be
[1:05:26] saved if you accept it Grace
[1:05:29] there's so much more to Grace
[1:05:33] is you weren't good enough
[1:05:35] so I'm going to come and live on the
[1:05:37] inside of you
[1:05:38] I'm Gonna Change you
[1:05:40] I'm gonna make you what you desire to be
[1:05:43] but don't feel like you have the
[1:05:45] strength to do
[1:05:47] Glory Hallelujah
[1:05:52] so I ask you if you receive the Holy
[1:05:54] Spirit
[1:05:55] can you lose it
[1:05:59] that's what we're talking about
[1:06:01] if you've received the Holy Spirit can
[1:06:03] you lose it
[1:06:04] does Jesus give you the Holy Spirit
[1:06:07] and then we're going to see how you do
[1:06:10] nope and then he fell two weeks later
[1:06:13] and not just one of them little ones
[1:06:16] like we're talking smack
[1:06:19] and so God's like well
[1:06:23] you you didn't do good enough with the
[1:06:25] Holy Spirit
[1:06:26] so I'm going to take it back
[1:06:30] because I didn't know what I was doing
[1:06:32] the first time apparently
[1:06:37] I'm going to take it back
[1:06:39] until you repent thoroughly enough
[1:06:42] and until you know and there's a six
[1:06:44] month waiting period
[1:06:47] or at least two weeks you know we don't
[1:06:49] need to be extreme
[1:06:51] um
[1:06:51] but there's like a two-week waiting
[1:06:53] period sure hope he doesn't come back in
[1:06:56] that two-week waiting period
[1:06:57] before you can come to the altar again
[1:06:59] and receive the Holy Spirit again
[1:07:02] see there's problems with this these
[1:07:04] ideas right so if you're receiving the
[1:07:06] Holy Spirit he doesn't take it back and
[1:07:08] if you're receiving the Holy Spirit you
[1:07:09] have the eternal life of almighty God on
[1:07:12] the inside of you
[1:07:14] this is Grace straightened out it's not
[1:07:17] licensed to sin Romans 5 Romans 6 shall
[1:07:20] we continue in sin that Grace May abound
[1:07:22] God forbid
[1:07:24] how can we
[1:07:27] that are dead to sin because there's new
[1:07:30] life on the inside live any longer
[1:07:32] therein we just can't do it
[1:07:39] all right
[1:07:40] so then we can get to uh to to no
[1:07:43] eternal hell and this one man this
[1:07:45] people do not like this Doctrine
[1:07:49] denominational people will will just
[1:07:51] they will they're not happy about this
[1:07:53] Doctrine and there's a reason
[1:07:55] and so so
[1:07:57] well let's talk about it for a moment
[1:08:00] what is hell
[1:08:01] okay we we know that it was created so
[1:08:04] it can't be Eternal so that's what we're
[1:08:07] getting no eternal hell
[1:08:09] um but but what is it so we go into
[1:08:11] Souls that are in prison now and brother
[1:08:13] Branham is preaching and and he had had
[1:08:15] an accident and his legs were shot and
[1:08:18] he had a vision as he as he was he was
[1:08:20] dying and and he had a vision that he
[1:08:22] was falling through all hell
[1:08:25] and he's looking around he's looking he
[1:08:27] cries out for his father and his
[1:08:28] father's not there he cries out for his
[1:08:30] mom his mom's not there
[1:08:32] he cries out for God and God's Not There
[1:08:35] so what is hell is hell a truly a
[1:08:39] burning Lake of Fire
[1:08:41] or is Hell merely the lack of God
[1:08:46] is hell just alone without him
[1:08:56] this is what hell is
[1:08:58] and and and so so here's the here's the
[1:09:02] idea that we get because of what brother
[1:09:03] Branham is preaching to us
[1:09:05] is that we begin to understand that hell
[1:09:08] isn't just burning as punishment but
[1:09:11] hell is merely what you've asked God for
[1:09:14] anyway the prophet teaches us God sends
[1:09:17] doesn't send anyone to hell
[1:09:20] you go there and you go over every
[1:09:24] roadblock that God has put in your way
[1:09:27] to get there
[1:09:28] because God is calling out for you he's
[1:09:31] not willing that any should perish but
[1:09:33] that all should come to repentance but
[1:09:35] if you've come to a place
[1:09:38] where you say God
[1:09:40] I know that you want to love me I know
[1:09:43] that you want to save me but I want to
[1:09:46] do it my way
[1:09:48] I don't want what you have for me God I
[1:09:51] don't want to listen to you I don't want
[1:09:54] to listen to your word at some point
[1:09:58] God will say the worst thing God could
[1:10:01] ever say to you
[1:10:03] okay
[1:10:05] have it your way
[1:10:09] and all God is doing is honoring your
[1:10:12] request you don't want me around here
[1:10:15] you go and that's why the prophet says
[1:10:18] there are souls in prison now because
[1:10:22] they're already rejecting God he'll
[1:10:25] never come to them they're already alone
[1:10:27] and without God and will never be with
[1:10:29] him
[1:10:31] amen
[1:10:34] so then hang on a second because if
[1:10:38] if their souls in prison
[1:10:40] now
[1:10:44] then there must be people
[1:10:47] who have accepted Jesus Christ who've
[1:10:50] said I believe your word God I want to
[1:10:52] be with you the rest of my life and
[1:10:54] throughout all eternity there must be
[1:10:57] souls in heaven now
[1:11:00] and as a matter of fact the scripture
[1:11:02] says that we are already
[1:11:06] seated in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:11:09] Jesus
[1:11:10] so it it makes the the idea of hell and
[1:11:14] heaven to be are you with God or not
[1:11:18] it's actually just relationship
[1:11:22] that's all right
[1:11:23] the problem is and and this is look you
[1:11:26] don't find this Doctrine outside of the
[1:11:30] message
[1:11:31] what they'll begin to do is so we let's
[1:11:34] start building up this picture because
[1:11:35] we've we're through three doctrines now
[1:11:37] and so let's imagine we don't understand
[1:11:39] serpent seat what does Jesus look like I
[1:11:43] preach to you you don't understand I
[1:11:45] preach to you you understand there's not
[1:11:47] really any good reason other than
[1:11:51] that's just what I want to do
[1:11:54] because we have no we have no doctrinal
[1:11:57] way to say it any other way Okay so
[1:12:00] we've got an arbitrary God who's just
[1:12:02] kind of picking and choosing and there's
[1:12:05] no real reason
[1:12:06] okay then Grace straightened out
[1:12:09] okay what what is what is that speaking
[1:12:12] to now now we have a god who's just like
[1:12:14] hey if you don't do it
[1:12:16] you don't do it right
[1:12:18] I'm gonna punish you
[1:12:19] [Music]
[1:12:21] and that's because it's not about
[1:12:23] whether the spirit like Born Again
[1:12:25] doesn't have as much meaning it's not
[1:12:28] about is it the spirit of God in you or
[1:12:29] not it's just don't don't don't you come
[1:12:32] to an altar and then go back and start
[1:12:34] sinning again if you do don't even think
[1:12:36] about yourself as a Christian
[1:12:38] you've got to perform this Christianity
[1:12:40] right
[1:12:41] or you have no claims to him now there's
[1:12:44] there's I'm there's truth there
[1:12:48] there's truth there but it's not all
[1:12:51] truth is it like it's not a real full
[1:12:53] picture and then as we begin to develop
[1:12:55] it a little bit more because this grace
[1:12:57] and it's like no you can't go back out
[1:12:59] and have any problems you've gotta just
[1:13:02] continue to do this thing right and if
[1:13:04] you don't
[1:13:08] I am going to send you to Hell To Burn
[1:13:12] and pay for your sins for all eternity
[1:13:17] and it's amazing how and and and and and
[1:13:20] and and and I understand I'm I'm king of
[1:13:23] overselling a point for for the effect I
[1:13:25] I do get that but we begin to see a
[1:13:27] picture right we begin to understand
[1:13:28] because you can go and you can talk to
[1:13:30] denominational people and they'll get
[1:13:32] really mad when you start trying to tell
[1:13:34] them hell is not Eternal and there can
[1:13:36] be only one reason that I can understand
[1:13:38] that people will get upset about tell
[1:13:40] like I thought people would be
[1:13:41] compassionate you know it's like oh good
[1:13:42] like hell they're not going to burn
[1:13:44] forever that makes me feel better like
[1:13:45] that's that's actually
[1:13:48] better others people I know are probably
[1:13:49] going there and I feel bad kind of you
[1:13:51] know I would think that you know but no
[1:13:52] it's like no why is that so such a
[1:13:55] strong thing it's like well because if I
[1:13:57] have to do it right
[1:13:59] and they don't then yeah let them burn
[1:14:03] for eternity
[1:14:04] because I gotta spend my life being
[1:14:06] miserable trying to serve Jesus like
[1:14:08] like I don't I don't understand how else
[1:14:10] do you say this
[1:14:12] so but over here we begin to see a
[1:14:15] picture of Jesus
[1:14:17] very consistent
[1:14:19] scripturally based
[1:14:22] there's a there's a cane and there's a
[1:14:25] Seth there's two types of people in this
[1:14:27] world
[1:14:28] so it so Isaiah makes sense Matthew 13
[1:14:32] makes sense
[1:14:34] New Birth makes sense virgin birth makes
[1:14:37] all of these things that we understand
[1:14:40] right
[1:14:41] then if he's going to come and he's
[1:14:43] going to live inside of us then Grace is
[1:14:46] straightened out then it is about that
[1:14:48] and whether or not he's living through
[1:14:50] you not a performance
[1:14:52] and then it is not about eternity and
[1:14:56] hell because because
[1:14:59] that was a creation
[1:15:01] it's got to be the life of almighty God
[1:15:03] to be eternal
[1:15:05] and so we can understand and we begin to
[1:15:07] see the picture that God is just
[1:15:09] Desiring relationship and when you don't
[1:15:11] want relationship with him for all of
[1:15:14] eternity he says okay don't have a
[1:15:16] relationship through all eternity
[1:15:19] but we begin to see a picture that this
[1:15:21] is a very very hard very arbitrary look
[1:15:24] of Jesus
[1:15:27] and over here we begin to see one of
[1:15:29] compassion one of Grace one of love one
[1:15:31] one of truth that's Desiring you to come
[1:15:33] to him and see his word that he might
[1:15:35] live inside of you and so it's a very
[1:15:37] it's a very different picture here that
[1:15:39] we begin to see so let's continue on the
[1:15:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost without
[1:15:43] sensation now so it's it's
[1:15:48] um
[1:15:49] brother Branham continues that he says
[1:15:50] but the person of Christ performing in
[1:15:53] you the same works
[1:15:55] that Christ did
[1:15:57] that's that's the idea it's not the
[1:15:59] sensation at the altar that you got when
[1:16:02] he came into you
[1:16:03] but it's it's the sensations and I don't
[1:16:06] want to use that really that word but
[1:16:07] it's the Life of Christ being performed
[1:16:10] in your life again and again and again
[1:16:13] it's not one moment it's many
[1:16:16] it's not oh I got cold chill and I felt
[1:16:19] really good and I felt real clean and so
[1:16:21] and but and then nothing later
[1:16:25] it's not about that moment but it's
[1:16:27] about each moment like that moment
[1:16:28] started it but if it didn't continue on
[1:16:30] in that the life of God came on the
[1:16:32] inside of you and began to produce the
[1:16:34] works of Jesus Christ in your own life
[1:16:37] then you missed something
[1:16:39] so to focus on the moment of reception
[1:16:42] and not the moments that God is dealing
[1:16:45] with your life and using you for his
[1:16:47] glory and producing his own life for and
[1:16:50] manifesting himself in you you've
[1:16:52] totally missed the points
[1:16:56] are we together
[1:16:58] and so over here we can we we can begin
[1:17:01] to build this picture that it's just
[1:17:02] like just come to the altar
[1:17:04] have this moment have a sensation run
[1:17:08] around the building a little bit and
[1:17:10] then leave but bless God don't you go
[1:17:12] and sin any ever
[1:17:14] if not you're gonna have to come back
[1:17:15] and probably do that all over again
[1:17:18] and we'll get to that a little bit too
[1:17:20] but we also got to go into water baptism
[1:17:22] in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:17:25] and I love this point because it's about
[1:17:27] the name of Jesus Christ and and I know
[1:17:30] I've probably preached this to you
[1:17:31] before look
[1:17:32] but it's in the the name that we're
[1:17:35] baptized in matters
[1:17:36] because it speaks to relationship
[1:17:39] because you don't you don't come home
[1:17:41] and you know call your wife the wrong
[1:17:43] name
[1:17:45] you don't come home and just say hey
[1:17:47] wife
[1:17:49] like all the time like maybe sometimes
[1:17:51] you do ironically jokingly
[1:17:54] you know but but if you were just like
[1:17:57] hey wife
[1:17:58] hey and I've I've said this many times
[1:18:00] like it's like I've told anime I'm like
[1:18:02] look
[1:18:04] We're not gonna be that old couple
[1:18:06] that sits on the rocking chairs is like
[1:18:08] well mother like well father
[1:18:11] it's like
[1:18:13] like that's sweet it really is
[1:18:18] but I have a name
[1:18:20] and that name is part of me it's who I
[1:18:22] am it's part of my character
[1:18:25] you know my wife has a name and brother
[1:18:28] Brandon tells us and this is just you
[1:18:30] know I he didn't exactly get this from
[1:18:33] the word of God I don't think but I
[1:18:34] think he just found this from just
[1:18:36] absolute observation
[1:18:38] the sweetest sound
[1:18:40] on human ear
[1:18:42] is a sound your own name
[1:18:44] and how sweet will that moment be when
[1:18:47] God calls your name
[1:18:49] and he'll do that he'll speak your name
[1:18:52] before his father and the angels
[1:18:54] because you spoke his name before all
[1:18:58] people
[1:18:59] and so being baptized is a symbol of
[1:19:01] it's not my identity anymore it's I'm
[1:19:03] being identified in him who's him Jesus
[1:19:06] Christ
[1:19:07] I I'm taking on relationship
[1:19:10] but but over here we've got no be
[1:19:13] baptized in Father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:19:14] well who's that well it's God
[1:19:19] so I'll be Mrs Father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:19:21] In Heaven
[1:19:23] or will I be
[1:19:25] that sounds different very different
[1:19:28] I'll be Mrs Jesus Christ
[1:19:30] like this sounds way closer
[1:19:33] and you might say that different seems
[1:19:35] trivial
[1:19:36] well I think if you looked in the mirror
[1:19:38] and you realized if someone was trying
[1:19:40] to claim you by titles and not by name
[1:19:44] it just you wouldn't like it either
[1:19:47] speaks to a deepness of relationship
[1:19:50] and finding our identity in him okay so
[1:19:52] godhead so now we get here because this
[1:19:54] is this kind of helps us wrap a lot of
[1:19:56] this up because because if if we don't
[1:19:59] have godhead right
[1:20:01] that a lot of these things really really
[1:20:03] break down
[1:20:04] and so so as we've been saying so so if
[1:20:06] you have God as you've got a father
[1:20:09] and as brother Branham said I used to
[1:20:12] think
[1:20:14] that God hated me that Jesus loved me
[1:20:18] right he used to think that then I
[1:20:20] realized
[1:20:22] that Jesus was the very heart of God
[1:20:24] and in the message titled message of
[1:20:27] Grace
[1:20:28] is when he tells us of the vision that
[1:20:30] he had of the three rainbows where God
[1:20:31] comes to him and says Jehovah of the Old
[1:20:34] Testament is Jesus of the new
[1:20:37] and so he begins to understand and see
[1:20:40] that it's not a God on the throne that
[1:20:42] hates him and a Jesus that died for him
[1:20:45] and loves him and that a holy spirit
[1:20:47] that then goes and does stuff in him
[1:20:50] because we don't know who that is if
[1:20:52] he's a third like
[1:20:54] and does he stay is I don't know like
[1:20:57] that gets that gets pretty sketchy we
[1:20:59] don't really understand how that happens
[1:21:00] but if all of them are one and all that
[1:21:03] was in God was poured into Jesus Christ
[1:21:05] and all that was in Christ he poured
[1:21:07] into his church because of the holy
[1:21:08] spirit that means that the father that
[1:21:10] said on the throne the father that said
[1:21:11] let there be light
[1:21:13] that's the one on the inside of you
[1:21:15] not another but that one that's the one
[1:21:18] who said he'd never leave you and he'd
[1:21:19] never forsake you that's the one that
[1:21:21] when you receive it he's not taking it
[1:21:23] back because he's there with you
[1:21:25] I will be with you always unto the end
[1:21:27] of the Earth
[1:21:28] [Applause]
[1:21:29] [Music]
[1:21:31] that's amazing right
[1:21:33] but here's the problem that we when we
[1:21:35] get over here and and look and I've seen
[1:21:37] this I've seen this in message young
[1:21:39] people and and this is a this is a
[1:21:41] problem is that even some of our message
[1:21:43] young people don't understand godhead
[1:21:45] correctly and and this is what really
[1:21:48] gets me about this thing because it's so
[1:21:50] destructive because you have you have
[1:21:52] young people coming to an altar because
[1:21:54] they realize they're struggling in their
[1:21:56] own lives
[1:21:57] they're struggling with overcoming
[1:22:00] things
[1:22:01] and there's so much pressure upon them
[1:22:04] because they still see a father sitting
[1:22:07] on a throne with his arms crossed that's
[1:22:10] saying hey if you don't do it right
[1:22:14] I'm gonna judge you
[1:22:16] so you better get it right because if
[1:22:19] you don't get it right I'm not coming
[1:22:21] and living on the inside of you in the
[1:22:22] Holy Ghost I'm not sending my Holy Ghost
[1:22:25] to you
[1:22:26] if you don't get it right first
[1:22:29] and there's pressure and anxiety
[1:22:32] that comes with that because they're
[1:22:35] looking they're looking at their own
[1:22:37] performance
[1:22:38] because they're afraid of the god that's
[1:22:41] on the throne
[1:22:43] and so when you divide him into three
[1:22:45] you put a God on a throne that's judging
[1:22:48] you based on your performance but a
[1:22:51] Jesus that's come and said but it's okay
[1:22:53] you're basically a loser
[1:22:56] but I'm gonna die for you anyway
[1:22:59] I mean
[1:23:01] he's he's really angry
[1:23:04] but me
[1:23:07] I love you
[1:23:10] and and what we call this and again I'm
[1:23:12] King of overselling the point
[1:23:13] we call this oh we call this emotionally
[1:23:17] scarring Jesus
[1:23:19] because does he love me or hate me I
[1:23:21] don't know I'm getting mixed messages
[1:23:23] here and it's because we don't have
[1:23:25] godhead right
[1:23:28] and I've had to counsel young men
[1:23:30] and say no no
[1:23:33] no no no next service you don't go to
[1:23:36] the altar
[1:23:38] how many preachers have ever told a
[1:23:40] young man that
[1:23:42] man I don't want to see you at the altar
[1:23:43] at the next service
[1:23:46] I want you to sit there
[1:23:48] and I want you to talk to Jesus
[1:23:51] I want the seat next to you I want you
[1:23:53] to imagine that Jesus Christ himself
[1:23:56] is sitting next to you
[1:23:58] and if you don't feel like you're doing
[1:24:00] it right
[1:24:01] I want you to tell him that
[1:24:03] I want you to just have a conversation
[1:24:05] with someone that loves you
[1:24:07] just like me just like your friends just
[1:24:09] like your dad just like your mom whoever
[1:24:11] it is I want you to have a conversation
[1:24:13] with Jesus like that because all that
[1:24:15] God was
[1:24:16] Jesus was the very heart of God and I
[1:24:19] don't understand why you're scared of
[1:24:20] someone that had a heart that produced
[1:24:23] Jesus Christ
[1:24:24] because he is one in the same
[1:24:27] and so I want you to have a conversation
[1:24:29] with Jesus
[1:24:31] I couldn't talk to him like that it's
[1:24:34] like no no no he wants to talk to you
[1:24:36] like that because he loves you
[1:24:41] he's not mad at you
[1:24:44] just wants you to receive him
[1:24:46] he'll take care of the problems
[1:24:49] but if we haven't broke into three we've
[1:24:51] got we've got a father up here that's
[1:24:52] that's on the throne and he's mad at
[1:24:55] people and we've got Jesus that loves
[1:24:57] people and then we've got a holy spirit
[1:24:59] that that's how God works and and and
[1:25:02] well and then we can get into well how
[1:25:06] long like this whole once saved always
[1:25:08] saved ideas so I had I had um
[1:25:11] we had some young people that were from
[1:25:12] a United Pentecostal church and and it's
[1:25:15] so amazing because they're dressed
[1:25:17] Holiness there's so many things that we
[1:25:19] would agree with with them right and so
[1:25:21] I'm talking to these young people and
[1:25:23] and I was like okay and he's like oh you
[1:25:25] believe in once saved always saved I was
[1:25:27] like well
[1:25:28] I was like oh so what you're saying is
[1:25:30] that you can come to the altar speak in
[1:25:32] tongues receive the Holy Spirit but then
[1:25:35] if you go out and you fall the Holy
[1:25:37] Spirit goes away
[1:25:39] he's like yes exactly and I was like and
[1:25:41] then you have to come back to the altar
[1:25:43] and speak in tongues again before you
[1:25:45] can have the Holy Spirit again he's like
[1:25:47] yes exactly otherwise you're just you're
[1:25:50] just playing around it's like I
[1:25:51] understand what you're trying to say
[1:25:53] like we should live right
[1:25:55] but we we but but Jesus redeemed our
[1:25:58] flesh
[1:25:59] and put his word on the inside like gave
[1:26:01] us new life that's kind of the point
[1:26:04] but but but so so I said but hang on a
[1:26:07] second we agree on so much I said but
[1:26:10] but and you all baptized in the name of
[1:26:12] of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:26:15] you all believe in Holiness and you
[1:26:17] dress so nice
[1:26:20] but but
[1:26:22] but you believe that you have to have
[1:26:24] you you know you have to speak in
[1:26:26] tongues to receive the Holy Spirit
[1:26:28] but but what about the other
[1:26:29] Pentecostals that are not United
[1:26:31] Pentecostals and they baptized in Father
[1:26:33] Son and Holy Spirit and they believe
[1:26:36] they have to come to an altar
[1:26:38] and they have to speak in tongues to
[1:26:39] receive the Holy Spirit and then after
[1:26:41] they receive they speak in tongues you
[1:26:43] believe because they spoke in tongues
[1:26:45] that they walk out of here and they have
[1:26:47] the Holy Spirit
[1:26:48] yes
[1:26:50] but they baptized like the Roman
[1:26:52] Catholic Church
[1:26:53] yes
[1:26:55] and they stood
[1:26:57] like you don't see a problem with this
[1:26:59] no no sir no sir speak in tongues
[1:27:08] so so but but what is your Holy Spirit
[1:27:10] doing
[1:27:12] okay there's a there's a sensation
[1:27:15] there's a manifestation if you will of
[1:27:17] speaking in tongues
[1:27:18] but then there's nothing in you to hold
[1:27:20] you there's nothing in you to keep you
[1:27:23] what is who did you get if you got the
[1:27:25] Holy Spirit
[1:27:26] what was like you didn't get God
[1:27:30] who said I'd never leave you or never
[1:27:31] forsake you
[1:27:32] like you didn't get that
[1:27:34] so I don't understand what is it the
[1:27:36] what is the holy spirit to you then so
[1:27:38] again we can begin to see we've got
[1:27:40] emotionally scarring God we've got
[1:27:42] arbitrary God we've got God that's going
[1:27:44] to burn you're gonna he's gonna send you
[1:27:46] to hell and Byrne for all eternity if
[1:27:48] you don't serve him rightly
[1:27:50] and he won't even stay with you because
[1:27:52] there's three of them one of them is mad
[1:27:55] at you one of them died for you to love
[1:27:56] you and one of them comes and helps you
[1:27:58] do stuff sometimes but
[1:28:00] will he stay or won't he I don't know
[1:28:04] and I mean this sincerely because I've
[1:28:06] had so like this this I just want you to
[1:28:09] understand this this sermon is a product
[1:28:10] of four or five years of me just
[1:28:14] thinking through these things and saying
[1:28:17] God I want to unders like like I like I
[1:28:19] need to see all of these things and and
[1:28:22] and and and I've had all if you think
[1:28:24] I'm being insincere at all understand
[1:28:26] all of these things that I'm saying to
[1:28:28] you I have been told by other
[1:28:30] denominational people
[1:28:34] but over here we get this picture
[1:28:38] that he says I want you to come to me
[1:28:41] I love you
[1:28:43] I want to put my spirit inside of you I
[1:28:47] want the word to be born in your heart I
[1:28:49] want it to then grow and flourish out of
[1:28:51] you when you receive my spirit I'll
[1:28:53] never take it from you
[1:28:55] you will be eternally secured but you
[1:28:57] will not you will not use that as an
[1:28:59] excuse to go out and sin actually it's
[1:29:02] it's you're going to feel so terrible
[1:29:04] about it and you're gonna have to even
[1:29:06] remind yourself over and over again it's
[1:29:09] not about your performance because Grace
[1:29:11] provided a seed on the inside and Grace
[1:29:14] provided a Jesus that died on the cross
[1:29:17] for you that redeemed your very flesh so
[1:29:20] when your flesh fails
[1:29:23] it's already taken care of
[1:29:28] the sin question was settled at Calvary
[1:29:31] but you'll remind yourself that that I
[1:29:34] am one of his because the word of God
[1:29:37] has been born on the inside of me and I
[1:29:39] I because I can recognize and I see the
[1:29:42] word of God and I am in the word of God
[1:29:44] that has been revealed to us in our day
[1:29:47] and it's not just and it's not just some
[1:29:49] status that we're trying to make sure
[1:29:51] that you get like oh are you amending
[1:29:53] the word of God for your day so that we
[1:29:55] can beside whether you're a message
[1:29:56] believer or not
[1:29:58] no what I'm saying is is this Jesus
[1:30:02] Christ because this is the word of God
[1:30:05] revealed to us in our day showing us the
[1:30:09] very character the very Heart Of God
[1:30:12] expressed to you this is why the prophet
[1:30:15] came to pull you out you there were
[1:30:18] there were there were bits of Truth
[1:30:22] some of these things had truths but
[1:30:24] because all of them weren't together you
[1:30:27] got this hard-edged this is very just a
[1:30:30] picture that isn't exactly complete and
[1:30:33] it isn't but when you come over here
[1:30:35] because the revelation of the word of
[1:30:37] God came to us today God coming in
[1:30:40] Satan's Eden to woo a bride
[1:30:45] those aren't words they're reality
[1:30:48] exactly what he said he would do then he
[1:30:51] manifests it and when it comes forth and
[1:30:54] spoken through the mouth of that prophet
[1:30:56] and comes to us this is what we see and
[1:31:00] when all truth comes to us it shows us a
[1:31:03] God we want to love we want to be with
[1:31:10] and it pulls us out of that not because
[1:31:13] oh you were wrong because you were in
[1:31:15] the status that's not why it pulls us
[1:31:17] out of that it pulls us out of that
[1:31:18] because that doesn't look good anymore
[1:31:21] because now that I have all truth why
[1:31:24] would I stay in a system of some truth
[1:31:29] that's trying to control me by a status
[1:31:32] and this message doesn't control You by
[1:31:35] a status
[1:31:37] but it's a revelation of the character
[1:31:39] and mind of and the Heart of almighty
[1:31:41] God
[1:31:46] so then he speaks about a pillar of Fire
[1:31:50] and we needed this Pillar of Fire
[1:31:51] because it had to vindicate that one
[1:31:54] that was going to come and tell us these
[1:31:56] truths and why and wrap up all of these
[1:31:59] truths
[1:32:01] and we see a pillar of fire vindicating
[1:32:03] prophets throughout the scriptures
[1:32:05] and here we have it in our day and this
[1:32:08] is the picture that it shows us
[1:32:10] so brother bran I'm recapping
[1:32:12] in the pergamian church age he speaks of
[1:32:14] John 16 13 how be it when he the spirit
[1:32:18] of Truth the word has come he will guide
[1:32:19] you into all truth Thy word is truth he
[1:32:22] shall not speak of himself but
[1:32:24] whatsoever he shall hear the word of God
[1:32:26] that shall he speak a word and he will
[1:32:29] show you things to come the spirit
[1:32:31] bringing the word of Prophecy I want you
[1:32:34] to note very carefully that Jesus did
[1:32:36] not say the evidence of being baptized
[1:32:38] with the Holy Ghost was speaking in
[1:32:40] tongues interpreting prophesying
[1:32:42] shouting and dancing he said the
[1:32:45] evidence would be that you would be in
[1:32:47] the truth you would be in the word of
[1:32:49] God for your age evidence has to do with
[1:32:53] receiving that word
[1:32:57] now
[1:32:58] if I would have started with this
[1:33:01] this little nugget right here
[1:33:04] you could have thought many different
[1:33:06] things
[1:33:07] you could have thought here we go we've
[1:33:09] got
[1:33:11] another one of these message preachers
[1:33:12] coming
[1:33:13] saying you got to believe this message
[1:33:15] are you out
[1:33:20] amen
[1:33:21] is that what that's saying
[1:33:24] you
[1:33:26] but I think but I think under context of
[1:33:28] what we've just talked about
[1:33:31] and this becomes a reality to you
[1:33:34] how do you reject this
[1:33:36] how do you say I have the Holy Spirit
[1:33:37] but this is what I want I want Father
[1:33:39] Son and Holy Ghost and I want eternal
[1:33:41] hell
[1:33:45] I I don't understand how you could say I
[1:33:47] have the Holy Ghost and believe those
[1:33:48] two things when your eyes have been made
[1:33:50] open to this truth
[1:33:53] so it has nothing to do with you know
[1:33:56] well did you recognize that the prophet
[1:33:59] came or not because man that's the
[1:34:01] ticket Oh I thought it was about Jesus
[1:34:03] Christ
[1:34:04] and not about whether or not we decided
[1:34:06] whether the prophet was right or not
[1:34:08] it is about Jesus Christ amen and the
[1:34:11] prophet came and showed us Jesus Christ
[1:34:13] and the reason that we can see this and
[1:34:15] say this that the evidence has to do
[1:34:17] with receiving the word
[1:34:21] is because this is the amazing picture
[1:34:24] that is obviously and evidently truth
[1:34:30] it makes sense from Genesis to
[1:34:33] revelation
[1:34:35] but over here that doesn't make sense I
[1:34:38] mean Matthew 13 Jesus himself speaking
[1:34:41] to two groups of people doesn't even
[1:34:43] make sense without the doctrine of
[1:34:45] serpent seed so you can't make scripture
[1:34:48] make sense but because God sends us a
[1:34:50] prophet and goes through these doctrines
[1:34:52] we see Jesus Christ as he is the Mighty
[1:34:57] God has been unveiled before us and we
[1:34:59] see him as he is not in a glass Darkly
[1:35:03] but very apparently the heart and
[1:35:05] character of Christ revealed to us in
[1:35:07] this day
[1:35:09] how do you say I've got the Holy Ghost
[1:35:11] but I'm going to walk away from that and
[1:35:13] I'm going to stay over here
[1:35:16] it's not status
[1:35:19] it's not except the right thing and be
[1:35:21] in our group
[1:35:24] it's
[1:35:26] God wanted to make himself known to you
[1:35:29] in this day and he did
[1:35:32] and when he does that how would you even
[1:35:35] think to reject such a marvelous
[1:35:38] wonderful amazing truth
[1:35:43] that's what this is
[1:35:45] that's what the prophet came to do
[1:35:47] that's what the pillar of fire came to
[1:35:49] vindicate was to show us
[1:35:51] this is the one who's going to just
[1:35:53] gonna wrap up all of these things and
[1:35:55] the spirit of truth I'm going to the
[1:35:57] spirit of Truth is going to come and use
[1:35:58] this this vessel
[1:36:01] to present to you
[1:36:03] all of the Mysteries being finished and
[1:36:06] when all of those Mysteries are finished
[1:36:07] and wound up
[1:36:09] you're going to see Christ like you've
[1:36:11] never seen him before
[1:36:15] I don't understand why anybody would not
[1:36:17] want this
[1:36:19] nor can I understand why anybody would
[1:36:21] say I want to leave this because I want
[1:36:23] to I Just Want Jesus
[1:36:26] this is
[1:36:28] Jesus
[1:36:30] many people have been offended by
[1:36:31] preachers saying this message is Christ
[1:36:38] but it just is
[1:36:40] what we're seeing this message is
[1:36:43] showing to us Jesus Christ
[1:36:49] musicians you can come
[1:36:51] I am so thankful
[1:36:53] I am so thankful to live in a day
[1:36:56] where we have all truth
[1:36:59] where the spirit of Christ has come
[1:37:01] and given us all truth
[1:37:04] that we can see him
[1:37:08] to know him
[1:37:10] to love him
[1:37:12] to see his love for us
[1:37:15] how am how amazing is that
[1:37:19] amen amen can we bow our heads for a
[1:37:21] word of Prayer
[1:37:23] Heavenly Father
[1:37:26] Lord you're so good to us
[1:37:29] to open your word and show us Lord
[1:37:32] All That You Are
[1:37:34] that we could
[1:37:36] that we could be a part of the unveiling
[1:37:38] of God
[1:37:40] to see you Lord in your love and your
[1:37:42] grace
[1:37:44] and your consistency and your constancy
[1:37:47] Lord
[1:37:48] How Great and Mighty you are Lord
[1:37:55] father let your word truly be born in
[1:37:57] our hearts Lord God
[1:38:01] Lord Jesus told your disciples and the
[1:38:03] Pharisees that some can hear and some
[1:38:05] cannot
[1:38:07] and God I'm so abundantly thankful
[1:38:11] my ears have been able to hear this word
[1:38:14] I did nothing Lord
[1:38:16] but just be a recipient of your grace
[1:38:18] and I'm so so thankful father
[1:38:23] and Lord when
[1:38:24] [Music]
[1:38:25] how great it is oh God
[1:38:28] when our hearts are downcast
[1:38:31] when discouragement hits and
[1:38:34] when in our flesh Lord we failed you at
[1:38:37] times
[1:38:38] and the Devil comes to us and he tries
[1:38:39] to beat us down and kick us
[1:38:43] remind yourself you failed again but
[1:38:46] father
[1:38:48] when we can look inside and we can see
[1:38:51] that little
[1:38:52] seed of the word of God has been planted
[1:38:54] and that it doesn't matter what the
[1:38:56] devil might want to try to do
[1:38:58] but that'll never be taken away
[1:39:01] our inheritance is sure
[1:39:04] God what courage and what encouragement
[1:39:05] that gives us O Lord Jesus
[1:39:09] to recognize that we're Sons and
[1:39:11] Daughters of almighty God
[1:39:14] hallelujah thank you Jesus thank you
[1:39:18] Jesus Lord we love you and we praise you
[1:39:20] Reveal Your word to us
[1:39:23] we ask give us faith in the name of the
[1:39:26] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:39:27] amen
[1:39:28] [Music]
[1:39:33] [Applause]
[1:39:45] amen
[1:39:47] appreciate brother Trevor on tonight
[1:39:50] amen just a a wonderful thought there
[1:39:55] the
[1:39:56] the purpose of God sending his spirit
[1:40:00] is to lead us and to guide us into not
[1:40:05] just some truth
[1:40:06] but uh the Bible said all truth
[1:40:10] amen and and I just love the way he
[1:40:14] um
[1:40:15] uh mention that when they took us
[1:40:17] through Matthew I believe it was 13 and
[1:40:19] some of the statements that the Lord
[1:40:21] Jesus made
[1:40:22] and I said the only way that Jesus could
[1:40:25] make this statement is because Jesus
[1:40:27] understood it
[1:40:29] um serpent seed
[1:40:31] Jesus understood it he knew what
[1:40:33] happened that there were two groups that
[1:40:36] uh was on the Earth right and that's
[1:40:39] brother Trevor just began to go through
[1:40:41] that it just it came to my mind even
[1:40:45] at his death on the cross
[1:40:49] two different groups were represented
[1:40:52] and we have one man that says uh
[1:40:56] remember me when you come into your
[1:40:58] kingdom
[1:40:59] and another man that says uh you know if
[1:41:04] you really ah who they say you are but
[1:41:08] why don't you get yourself out of this
[1:41:10] and also us
[1:41:14] and uh this one man that was identified
[1:41:18] with Christ makes the conversation now
[1:41:20] why don't you just leave him alone
[1:41:22] me and you are on the cross because of
[1:41:24] what we have done
[1:41:26] right we did the wrong thing and that's
[1:41:28] why we're here this man did nothing
[1:41:30] wrong
[1:41:31] he was identified with the words
[1:41:35] one fellow could not come to repentance
[1:41:37] at all
[1:41:38] and um and it showed even at death even
[1:41:42] at death there was two different groups
[1:41:44] that were represented uh uh just a real
[1:41:48] wonderful thought here amen that we have
[1:41:50] uh before us and we we just really thank
[1:41:53] the Lord uh for the word of God tonight
[1:41:56] uh brother brother quick who had told us
[1:41:59] on Sunday it says um uh you know there
[1:42:04] is two different types of a mans that
[1:42:07] people give in church
[1:42:08] one is inspired by the Holy Ghost Amen
[1:42:13] to say Amen then the other one is uh
[1:42:17] coerced
[1:42:19] you have to be coerced to give somebody
[1:42:21] an amen force them into Sammy man if if
[1:42:24] you don't say Amen you're not a believer
[1:42:28] no no no he said sometimes God wants to
[1:42:31] send a word and just let it
[1:42:33] soak it
[1:42:36] and tonight God sent us a word to let it
[1:42:40] just soak in
[1:42:42] [Music]

[1:43:02] everybody live right
[1:43:04] if I gotta live right you got to live
[1:43:06] right the bottom line but we gotta
[1:43:09] understand God's got to be the one to
[1:43:10] bring us to those places and it's good
[1:43:13] to know that that he even when we make
[1:43:16] mistakes he still promise that he'll
[1:43:19] never leave us
[1:43:21] nor forsake us Even in our mistakes he
[1:43:25] will not leave us he'll be right there
