couple of nights ago i was at home and i had already gone to bed and i was awakened i think about an accidental phone call so it's about 2 a.m in the morning and i couldn't go back to sleep so i was just laying there and i was just thinking thinking on the goodness of god and um while i was just laying there thinking god just brought back to my remembrance um that how good his grace actually is and i gave my husband a call he was at work and i said honey you know what i'm laying here and i'm just thinking of the goodness of god and i say his grace is just so sufficient i said you know this month makes you know the number of grace is five and this month makes five years that i've been cancer-free [Applause] as i lay there and i just pondered on a number five and things just kept coming to me and i told them i said you know when that tumor popped up on my head actually in january on the new year's service is when i said i was gave a testimony i said i'm not going to go back to the doctor because i've been going to a hematologist for two years and they kept saying you got some infection in your body your body is fighting something because the autoimmune is just going crazy but we can't find it so two years i've been seeing this doctor and in january at the new year's service i said you know what i'm not going back i'm just leaving in god's hand and that five exactly five months later in june is when that tumor popped up on my head and i look at that and i say you know that was nothing but the grace of god again number five exactly five months later it was in june um and because that tumor could have been anywhere in my body and i wouldn't have seen it um it was lymphoma it could have been anywhere could have been in my any of my organs i wouldn't have never known it was there but he allowed it to pop up right on the top of my head where i could see it and i just know that was nothing but the grace of god again and and as i just laid there and pondered says all these things just kept coming to me and i said you know the car that i had um i had it for five years the honda it started acting up the engine was giving me problems i took it to the mechanic he said you're gonna have to have somebody open up the engine that's gonna be real costly and i was like lord i'd rather get rid of this car before it put me down so um i went to the car lot i came back with a car and i just thank god for that because that car started acting up after me having it for five years so i say that was nothing but again by the grace of god um but anyway i was thinking so many things just kept coming and they all was just all tied around the number five and i say you know god i thank you for your grace upon grace upon grace and i'm just thankful and grateful that he chose me um i'm not worthy i'm just glad that he could um use me in whatever small way this is a little song i'm gonna try to sing um it just says um it's called i stand in awe and um i'm gonna attempt it anyway you are beautiful beyond description to marvelous for words too wonderful for comprehension [Music] like nothing ever seen or heard [Music] who can question your infinite wisdom who can fathom

died [Music] and i stand [Music] is too [Music] [Music] holy god [Music] of you [Music] of you and i said [Music] you [Applause] [Music] like you [Music] no one else can touch my heart like you do i

little song that's kind of been on my heart for a little while i don't have to sing that much no more cuz my voice ain't what it used to be but uh i just felt i just felt a little bit inspired to try this little song sister burrows wrote years ago it's a lot of it's a lot of songs that we used to sing back in the day and maybe we'll pull some of them out songs that have kind of gone just all around the message and uh uh i just felt like we will just attempt i'm like sister tyler this morning so i'm gonna attempt i'm gonna attempt so if i mess up it'll be okay is that all right um y'all probably ain't never heard this song but i'm quite sure y'all gifted enough to um pick pick it up it's a little song that says back to the original world let me see lord i put aside my thoughts

original world the original word lord spoken long ago you're living where lord that we should thirst no more this everlasting life [Music] we've got to go back to the original world lord i put aside

man so i wanna i wanna start uh using it a little bit more and um hopefully things have come back but let's just remember brother jack and the saints just not here this morning and uh just trusted the lord to use him to break the bread of life this morning we appreciate brother quickly last week in the testimonies and amen his message we always get a a whole lot from it and uh we all kind of you know jail with one another we appreciate the lord this morning we want to read from ephesians chapter four uh we want to read the um from the 30th verse and it reads uh and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption amen let's just bow heads for a word of prayer gracious heavenly father we just come this morning to give thanks and praise for just another opportunity to be able to feed upon life this morning the bible said your word is spirit and it's life and we just come to feed upon food and season we thank you for a seventh course meal this morning lord help us to get um ourself out of the way so the holy ghost can do the winning lord we just want to remember the saints of god that's out and about this morning and we just pray for them wherever they are we just want to pray for the service this morning that lord when saul said and done lord you can be glorified we realize lord you're not going to share your glory with anybody and we're just here to be an instrument this morning so we just thank you we thank you for tanya's testimonies amen every five years you work the miraculous for amen thank god for a new car so we appreciate you this morning lord and we just give thanks and praise for all things in jesus name amen amen may be seated amen uh this morning we we uh we like to use as a topic uh the sealed steel holes now y'all just kind of bear with me a little bit um this little topic that we preached um two weeks ago up in orlando and uh had a real wonderful time y'all just continue to pray for us trusting that god will just continue to open up doors that we can go in and just uh minister the word of god i was listening to a little message a couple of weeks ago um you know when i'm riding i normally pop in a tape you know to just kind of um settle my mind uh because you know like everybody else during the run of the week we like wild people we just kind of in and out up and down and and by 9 10 o'clock we just you know we don't hardly have time if you got children y'all knowing oh my you're running them here you're doing this you're doing that if you work it's it's a constant constant uh battle all the time so sometimes you got to get it where you can i know some of y'all might spend all time you know four five hours every day listening to the prophet and reading your books fine but don't criticize the folks that don't praise the lord hallelujah glory to god amen because we all do not do it amen uh but we still need to sing the song lord make us desperate um that's that's just that's just life life life keeps us busy sometimes uh but i was i was i was listening to uh this little this little message um uh does god change his mind about his word and brother branham he bring he you know he he brought out a statement we're going to get into it but i like to try to just live platform and and he said some things that you know encourage encourage me you know i thank god that god is a sovereign god god god gives us god gives us food and season god is inspirational god inspires a word for us in season is that right in in season god or god or let somebody say something i i appreciated the meetings that we had over the a couple of weeks ago uh i i feel like i was writing channel because i thought my god i might have to go rethink all of my messages because the brothers they just blew through everything that i thought i wanted to preach but uh i thank god that that we we got 66 books of the bible and a message so i'm i'm never really worried about that i just need god to inspire us and and you know sometimes you you look at you look at ministers and and you might think that we don't go through anything but that's not the truth we we have our ups and our downs and and you know when when we're anointed it feel like we we feel like we could jump through a truth right we we think you know we could make a way out of no way y'all unheard that he's a mighty good god yes he is and but that's just a gift that's the anointing that's the pull from the people right but but when you're not behind the platform it's it's it's totally totally different because you know you got to live everyday life and and what goes along with everyday life everyday life is filled with uncertainties right um just just when you think that you know uh everything is going good then something starts happening to your motor when you don't really want no payment you know just like me i'm riding and i'm i'm hitting animals in my little car like i i mean i think about i talk about another car in the future but that's the future i ain't ready to start all over again with payments but uh uh but life life is so so filled with uncertainties right we we we're living in a we're living in in a day in an hour where it just you just don't know all the time but that's things that we do know right and the things that we know has got to be scriptural because one of the things that i'm starting to realize that in in the midst of uncertain because you don't know if you're gonna have a job tomorrow we think we are when we wake up in the morning we got faith we we're just hoping to focus keep us there you know because we realize well i got bills to pay and they just constantly coming and and thank god you know my children are up and their adults and and and uh they're able to make their way but you know i still got a wife i still got bills to pay and and and you know it's just so much uncertainty associated with that and and and what what happens is when we're not sure about things uh buddy if you don't have a real true revelation or word of god man i tell you what it it it brings gloomy days right and and so i'm gonna read i'm gonna read this just quote it in a second as as we kind of get started i'm gonna be all day i'm just gonna take about two hours but we'll be all right y'all don't mind if i preach a two-hour sermon dude i'll preach two hours service i just want to test y'all you know i when i see a finger go up i know what that means when you go outside though i told him that brother stasis i i remember the cartoon with the little lion hangings the mercury troy he was pune but but uh inspirational wise while while i was i i was writing i was listening to the little message and i had to go back and and uh uh read and listen to the message previous because they both kind of dovetail uh it's the rising of the sun and i'm gonna tell you something i i don't normally do this but that's a really good book if you haven't read it in a while and really go back to it because i find that there's a lot of nuggets in there i might have got four five messages out of it uh i may preach it here if not i preach it where the lord leads us but but it's it's a lot and and i'm just saying all this to draw our background because uh in in listening to the prophet and studying a lot of times you know i i try to listen and get a get a feel for his heart right and and the reason and the reasoning behind why he's bringing what he's bringing right because because you know one of the things and studying for you know 35 years now i i realized that that the messages wasn't just a man trying to be smart right not just trying to show knowledge but but the heart of a man trying trying to uh anchor a people i i appreciate i appreciated the brothers doing doing the uh uh meetings that friday night and the subject matter that they brought uh on malachi 4 and uh man i was saying to myself during that time i said man that's a 50 minute 50 message subject you can't you can't begin to touch it i was watching the brother stumbling like 15 minutes i can't even get started to say anything pertaining to the scripture but then you realize god god sent us a prophet and gave him a ministry so that in these in these times of uncertainties in this in these times when the world is falling apart when when when the mentality and the minds of people is evil and when writers become wrong right and and just sometimes they're just talking to and and i don't say this to be critical these generations you realize that sometimes that they don't really have a clue they don't really they don't really um scripturally um understand where they are right and and for me that bothers me as a servant of god i have children right i i have children and and just kind of watching them navigate through life and i try to be right now because they're adults i try to you know allow them to make their their own choices and decisions and and it's it's difficult uh because i i just thought that man everything would go a certain way and you have to appreciate uh uh uh seeing pastors children in church worshiping god right um i'm riding with him right you you i mean you you just really have to applaud and give give god thanks cut it because it could have been another way right it could have been another way and but i'll say this you know for preachers children that may not right now be serving god in the way that we think they don't worry about it everything is everything is in control there's nothing out of catering god right there might be uncertainty in us but god is sure god is sure about what he's saying right god is sure about what he said and and and so brother branham the i think the night before he preached this message of of it's the rising of the sun and and and the next day when he preached this other message he was just trying to tell him yeah this this that message it was long if you read it if you listen to this rising sun that's probably about a three hour message right so you're probably going to have to listen to it and read the book and segment scope cause it'll kind of get to you and take your time but he was saying that it was something right that he felt like he had to get to the people right and so when when when i hear these things it's it's like to maybe to y'all those things don't mean anything but to me those little things mean a lot to me because i get inspired by those things and i realize when he says those things i can feel his heart and there's something that that he's looking at in the natural in the spiritual and seeing the importance right and i'm gonna help us this morning even in ministry when brothers jack is up here and things of that nature we we've got to be in the spirit right right brother bannon preached that he said you gotta be in the spirit to hear and know we we gotta we gotta try to make sure that that you know our minds is clear our hearts is right so that we could be in the spirit so that we can feel we can sense the urgency sometimes right feel feel the you know the heart a lot of times i've heard a lot i'm gonna get to where i want to go but y'all y'all just pray for me over the years we've heard a lot of criticisms and things of that nature of of of the message and and the messenger and uh for me for me here's what i do i listen i listen to the heart of the man i listen to what he's saying i try to to uh put myself right in there with him and and feel his heart right to make sure that he's he's sincere and and what he's saying and regardless of all the criticisms and regardless of you know people and regardless of the mistakes that they say he make he even said he makes mistakes i i feel the heart of the man and you see where the man is sincere in what he said and that means a lot to me the sincerity and the uh i'll just say that because i ain't gonna be able to pronounce this word it ain't gonna come out right right um so those things help me you know when i'm i'm studying and and i'm i'm reading the books and i'm listening to the tapes i want to get a sense of feeling i want to sense the urgency behind uh uh what he's saying and so so for me i believe that the profit of god in preaching the rising of the sun is to uh bring an anchor right to give us some sort of guarantee right we love guarantees now we try not to buy nothing without a guarantee we like uh guaranteeing your money back that sounds good to me because if this thing don't work out i'm coming back to get my money well praise the lord y'all can let folk have y'all money but i'm going back to get mine i got a cousin that i work with he will take stuff back to walmart or anywhere else i'd be like man you gonna take that cause i'm taking this back get my money they're gonna do something for me man if you give me a give him a guarantee you to you hey but but watch but watch this brother banham says in uh does god ever change his mind 1965. is is verse three i think on what i got his first he says and i i i can't say that i'll apologize for that long long message this morning i guess that was the morning he was preaching at night but it was he says i didn't want to wear out your patience and then come come at it again uh tonight but i wanted to get that message to you right amen and and this is the part when i heard it right in that day man sometimes i have to pull over to the side and write because it's just something that strikes me at a time where i where i need something right i'm a needy person right when it when it comes down to the things of god i'm a very needy person maybe y'all aren't but i'm needy i need y'all don't know nothing about that theo i wish i was in an old-fashioned church i need thee [Music] maybe y'all don't need him everybody [Music] come on let's have church now oh bless me now my seat [Music] i'm starting to feel something i don't know what y'all feel i like old-fashioned church like brother jack would say church y'all like church we like church i'm old school in a couple of days i'll be 60 years old so i'm i'm back in the days where i'm back in the days where we had church amen y'all like church amen but he says um then i uh he said but i i want to get this message to you that you are a part of this resurrection and i thought man you said a mouthful then be and it's good to know these things because people we we want to be a

and i thought i was flying cool and all that i wanted to be a part of the who's who's and and but one thing about it when you when you when you link up with these folks you realize it you realize

know who they are right and have a confidence in who they are and willing to amen uh uh walk alone if need be right glory to god i know i feel funny walking through the school camp is all by yourself

do me very well now you know i know how to go to the restaurant bye ma you're married and i'll take her too but sometimes you need some me time well y'all gotta talk to me huh i know how to be i've been mad now a little longer than a whole lot of y'all you know so sometimes when you've been married a long long time and you got a lot of life sometimes it's good i hope y'all don't think nothing wrong with that cause if you do well that's just your hang up it ain't mine sometimes i need brother smiley time come on to go if any number sit up at mcdonald's sit up and spend ten dollars on myself well praise the lord i hope y'all still like me after that but but sometimes you need to be able to decompress sometimes you need to be able to think things through think conversations through think things where you at you know maybe sometimes just change the atmosphere right i hope i'm teaching y'all something if you don't know you will know after a while by and by yeah hey man you just you know husbands and i did she might just need to you know go to marshall somewhere and and and not where where you at well praise the lord look i felt something on that lord of god she gonna be all right she ain't meeting nobody in the cut sometimes she just need you take the children and and i'm gonna go over here and just it ain't number window shop huh maybe you throw a physical gone go on do yourself something you know if you could stand in your pockets could stand it you know she might have even her own money you know nowadays women got their own money that's the day that we living in i give you to know i'm just as educated and smart i got my own money but with your own money i hope you got the right spirit ain't nothing wrong with you ain't nothing wrong with you you know my wife got to own money i don't accident nothing i don't it don't even bother me you know it's your money when you spin it you know right just don't look at me now but you have your own money i'm gonna take care of all of this and this this this this and you know whatever you want to do with yours that's fine you know you ain't got to put it in the well praise the lord i'm getting into trouble now let let me back up because i didn't plan on standing you see i'm a little bit different i just say what's on my heart you know i may not please y'all with the things that i say but i say what's on my heart but but you know people are different every household is different every household is sovereign sometimes sisters you might that y'all set up you might have to make sure so i'm i'ma just kind of back up a little bit everybody everybody everybody household ain't like mine and don't try to make my household like yours praise the lord praise the lord well move on brother smiley i didn't come to say that see i always get myself in trouble i'm trying to i'm trying to preach on something else the seal still holds but uh brother brother branham he says that you you are a part of this resurrection right sometimes just people need to know these little things that might seem to be my new because you you find this it is realistically it's a struggle a lot of times in church and there's a there's a lot of uncertainty right there's a lot of people unsure people are pursuing people are tossed about right look at our generation a lot of times i think back because i've been around south florida for 35 years right i may not have been to a lot of places where some of us has come from but this area alone i've been around for a mighty long time right and i've i've watched a lot of people young people right adults right come and go in and out right that that that shows you something right it shows that there's such a uh uncertainty right and then for the cr the criticisms about the word that shows that that's an uncertainty one thing that i'm sure about i'm sure about i'm safe like the old timers say sanctified holy ghost field five baptized i don't do everything that i supposed to do but a saint is just a sinner who falls down sometimes but to get back up we make mistakes even god's prophet god would speak to brother brown and tell him things to do and he would do the exact opposite does that dis-christianize him no right see i'm sure this morning i'm certain that something took place in me august of 1988 i'm sure that you can't take that away from me i'm sure about that i'm certain there's there's been a change in my life i can clearly say you know what the places i used to go i don't go no more cause um monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday saturday sunday i was clubbing at one point and then when i got really deeply into drugs then i was somewhere looking crazy saturday sunday well i don't do those things no more haven't done it for 35 years see so so when everybody's doing all of these things i'm certain about one thing i believe i am where god wants me to be at this morning now y'all got to speak for yourself right next week you might feel like i don't know what people be feeling sometime but that's up to y'all some things that i'm certain about right and and with this statement see that that gives me some sort of clarity i am a part of right just resurrection to know that is is wonderful that i'm not because see we always we want to be a part of things and to know that you know what uh i'm a part of this man that does me good is that right brother madam says and don't worry about it no more see just rejoice right rejoice over it what because because sometimes we we stop questioning your christianity stop questioning your walk either you're born again or you're not born again is that right it's just something that you know what you just got to know the very hour the very time this is a quote just something took place in you is that right glory to god see that help that helps me when when it looks like my world is falling apart and things is uncertain i i could look back you know like sister time was looking back to all the things that you know god brought us through i just look back to what god did for me and and what god is doing for me is that right these things become my anchor is that right glory to god and so to know that you know what i may not be a part of certain societies certain clubs right the in crowd and the end club but to know that i'm a part of the resurrection my god my god that's all i need to know right and he says you're so so rejoice right amen what are you happy about i'm part of resurrection i'm gonna be a part of this change i heard um uh brother whispers preaching on that while we we was in orlando i went back and listened to uh portions of the message see the the greatest event ever the thing that that we looking forward to is that right glory to god he says don't don't worry about it no more see just rejoice there's there is nothing nowhere can separate you from it right nothing this this is powerful statement here you're eternally secured in the kingdom of god right see when god has stamped his seal upon you you're to the end of your destination not to the time that you we all make mistakes right we we all since we've been a christian we we've made mistakes we got sometimes preach a realistic gospel to folk and especially to um our younger generation that's that's that's trying to get themselves together in god you know it's important for us to to give them some leeway because you know it used to be a time where we were very very very very very very legalistic and you know we didn't give room for growth like i said i've been around 35 years some of y'all ain't even 35 years old i've been around a little while don't make me an old man i'm still a young man 60 ain't old right but we used to be very realistic you know we used to like we say we bust them and we blast you know uh when we did have the church in okeechobee i got to a place um um and working with the saints of god that started to bother me when when when when i heard a heard of people when i blasted my church oh i busted it's like listen buddy we have got to preach the word of god and get out of the way and and allow for god to bring the growth and it's a good teaching tool for parents you can't beat your children into submission it's something some things has got to be quickened to them made alive right like like you know your baby they might touch something hot you ain't got to worry about them touching that no more right come on somebody i mean you don't want them to get burnt but they do that a couple of times you ain't got to worry about that mo they might go over that close to it and look at it but they've been touching they're like hot mommy hot yeah hot sugar baby hot it's certain things there's certain things that they they grow to i had a child that used to like to fall out just get fall but we had some terrorism floors in the house my mom old house no coffee was down there and buddy he used to fall out one day he fell out too hard and bumped that nougat boy look at him when he had to teach him after i remember why we used to just laugh i see y'all y'all don't believe this the amount of intelligence that kids actually have y'all think that they're not learning they're learning all the time after a while he's still trying to kick out and fun but he hey he fall down fall back put his hand put his hand back and when he when he when he realized his back and laid down then he kicked his feet i say you got six don't you baby and i mean he was probably about two years old right but you know you you you gotta give you got to give room the growth we listen church 35 years and i s i'm still growing i'm still growing i'm still a work in progress all right all of us all of us are still a work in progress right i know that i know we all still growing you're still maturing i don't care who you are how old you are how long you been married you still there's still growth still room for growth right amen we make we make mistakes but but the thing that the thing that i like is that you know uh you gotta know that you're sealed right amen you this is something that that you cannot at any time as ministry we can't never get to a place with with all of our preaching and all of our understanding get away from preaching the new birth amen you you because listen let's let's face it everybody's not born again people sing people are gifted people tell churches we do all of these things but then but then you you have the you know you just have to watch things and and people might be backsliding today you know they're part of god because we predestinated to adoption i thank god that you know what the day that god chose me you know that was 900 and however many you know i'm one in a million i put it that way i started trying to count then y'all know that i ain't been in school in a long time right sister tina she's the teacher i hate the teacher but god god had to walk walk over and says there's one right right and these things are important and i ain't screaming and hollering this morning i'm taking my time right so we could marinate on on on the points because sometimes we go to church and we scream and holler and we leave out empty yeah we'll praise the lord and put the glasses on i'm gonna get in trouble again i've been doing this a long time church really right but but what what you want you want to make sure that that we're certain right that that there's an assurance in our heart about about what jesus christ done for us brother branham says in the breach message he said he's talking about ephesians 4 30 and he talks about the inspector right he he inspects he inspects the cargo before he ever puts a seal on it right because the contents in in the boxcar has got to reach its destination right glory to god so he inspects brother branham say the inspector he inspects the boxcar before he ever seals it right but once he but once he seals the car right that's the thing no and you know what we used to put emphasis on this right brother troy uh coming up when we were young converts and the thunders one thing that you know you you could look back on and and give credit to they want to make sure that that i believe that part of that that you were sealed is that right something that you had to know that something has taken place in you is that right amen something that you have got to have a revelation of you have got to be certain that that i'm sealed in and the devil is sealed out right glory to god i'm in he's out and the only way that he can get in which he ain't trying to get in because he do not want to be your brother he don't want to be your friend he wants to be your adversary like brother branham say the devil made me do it he said no he didn't no uh he didn't nope nope nope he said you did you came out you that's all you came out right amen in order for him to get you you had to come out because he ain't coming in because he don't want to be your homie he said you came out lusting for the things of the world wow big statement see so when you watch when you watch people and i don't want to be critical i want to be positive but it's something that's got to be said what happens to a lot of people is not that people don't have experiences and things it is it's that people come out they start lusting for for the things of the world right and being enticed right you know the the white horse rider uh under the the doctrine of of nickelodeonism you know it just seemed like it started out brother branham says a little saying right before it became a deed and and all of that it just was something that seemed so so inoffensive something that it just won't really hurt any no and that's how the devil presents sin right it's so inoffensive it's you know just a little bit but sin would take you further right than than you could even imagine right glory to god see it might start out amen you know just a little can i use myself as an example you know that there was a time when i really started out um on on drugs and you know i started smoking a little pot and uh you know maybe social drink here and there and i could not see myself because i started out as a young age about 11 years old right and and it was just the influence of my surroundings and and brother i know what i'm talking about see when you grow up kind of grow up in the inner city i don't know how it is well the suburbs just as bad too right um um and and and you know i grew up going to church come on praise the lord hallelujah so that don't stop nothing because you take your children to church and you just gotta you gotta keep them under the blood keep praying for them right because my mama took us to church every sunday um but it started out so you know we smoke and giggle me and my homie i hope this all right right uh but i couldn't i couldn't see 14 15 years down the line my life in total disarray right all of my ambitions shot her i thought i'd be rich by now i'm 60 years old still working hard i i never even thought about working hard i thought about i'd be going to work in a suit or something huh but god had other plans but it was the result of the choices that i made not being able to stand alone huh you know why we got young people up in here they got to know this senator take you places listen prostitutes ain't growing up with the ambition well when i get get older i'ma praise the lord people don't skid row and and all that they did right but from from a innocent smoke something that that the devil presented as as innocent they did not have a seal right they weren't sealed in christ right just having columbine carnal perspectives just something that started out and appeared to be so innocent right right a little a couple of puffs and you come out from your little spot giggling and laughing with the munches y'all don't know about that you just want to go to the store get some candy some tater chips it's a soda waffle hungry boy huh i can recall many days coming out me and my homeboy we laughing the stupidest thing and you just why are you on the ground somebody know what around mine but but we couldn't we couldn't see the next stage to it right we this is this was the starting point right and then i found myself on on pills right the influence my homie brought some pills by the time we was the end of ninth grade i don't know why i'm going this way this wasn't in my nose but just somebody need to maybe hear this this morning and then by the time i was in 10th grade i was on power i'm sure i don't want to be too too direct right i never saw that for myself right right but from innocence right something that seemed you know this like this don't hurt nobody but i was starting to hurt myself right see because these things started affecting my ambitions right my ambitions and my goals now is starting to be affected and and and alter my character right my character as a as a uh uh individual my mindset yeah right right the the because it's demon inspired right desert there's a it's natural but there's an element of demonology that's associated with these things right amen listen because once this stuff gets you hooked you hooked you know i was i was thinking about i was thinking about the one of the message brother whispers was preaching um i think the message first message he preached here and uh i was just i was just thinking and i think he was talking about um um leasing in them right listen when you hooked right it takes a source it take it take a greater power to break the power of the thing that got you bound is that right it takes a it takes a greater power and thank and thank god for the promised word right thank god for what's been spoken right because god looks at his word and come to your rescue let me tell y'all something if it wasn't a word there we'd all be in trouble if we didn't have a promise we would not make it through this age of everything you said right this bad except for the word but god by his word right that motivates god his word that brings that brings god on the scene the thing that he said the thing that he promised right but things start out from an innocent i'll tell y'all young folks some you might say well these kids are you sure uh are you sure there's so many levels to this stuff right from from physical attractions huh the inspiration oh he cute oh she fine i'ma leave that alone y'all don't want me to preach that huh right i'm i'm you know just as a servant of god as a young man that has been somewhere and some seen something sometimes you know what let me tell you something i didn't have i didn't have men of god i didn't have father figures that could relate these things to me right uh because maybe just just maybe um i i don't know but i could just i know hindsight is 20 20. but just maybe um some of the things that i did i might not have done them i don't i don't know the hindsight it's it's easy to say yeah i hate uh cause we hard head well maybe y'all just wasn't like bro me we we don't really listen we feel like we know you're five years old and i can't tell you that all right five five you 10 years old listen church i'm telling y'all i started in the fifth grade i wasn't even in middle school i wasn't in high school 25th grade in here anybody in fifth grade any fifth graders fourth boy you're a general giant well you just like me sixth grade sixth grader okay any sixth graders okay we got one over there could you imagine me look at her innocent little dumpling over there do y'all realize what i was doing when i was her age that's brother solomon little baby girl over there but could you imagine see i was a big kid they used to call me the big little boy because i was bigger than him he was small compared to me when when i was his age i hung with the teenagers and adults so they just call me the big little boy right but the innocence but there was no seal there there was so much uncertainty there at every turn pursuing me right venturing out with no authority you what you say you want people to move with authority with a certainty is that right come on as christians we have got to live with an uncertainty i got 10 minutes and i'm going home with an uncertainty right and so for brother madam say you're going to be a part of something that's positive praise god you know and and the day that i listened to that i was kind of i was kind of down in my spirit i ain't not listen church i ain't always on the mountaintop right i know every time you see me you ain't gonna get no praise the lord hallelujah thank you either that you know i ain't that type of person you know you get some people you run into right they just be pretending he's like buddy you ain't you always y'all know what i'm talking about that's un to me that's unrealistic maybe maybe some people like that maybe some people like that i want to do and most of the time you know people say well you got the right name smiley but i don't always feel like smiling huh sometimes i just i want to be i want to be frowny i want to be just let me be today tomorrow uh give me an hour the next hour i might be greater than laughing with you you know that's just that's just being realistic come on church not unless some of y'all might have it down pat like that when y'all always grinning and laughing pray the lord hallelujah god is good and this and that and i know brother westco used to be like that but i i do know realistically i passed it that's i hate to say it like this but sometimes that stuff being facade because if you're dealing with people every day sometimes people can bring you on a low huh amen i i doubt very seriously you know brother jack is always on a high yeah he might be at high when he step up behind the pulpit but but but we when you got so much going on you ain't always on no high come on brother brother was not always on no high he wasn't he wasn't but but let me go i'm give me 10 minutes i'm i'mma quit cause i don't wanna preach out two hours my brother adam started on the sermon he said i don't wanna weigh y'all patience right but he says um uh uh there is nothing nowhere can separate you from it that's powerful to know listen i cannot be separated from god once there's a connection once there's a seal i can't nothing see it eternally secured right in that word secured is fixed or attach something firmly so that it cannot be moved or lost that's powerful and see i'm not basing that upon how i feel because i don't always feel i'm basing that upon what he's saying right that's it i'm basically i'm eternally secure in the kingdom of god got nothing to do with how i feel right now i'm anointed when i leave here in the next two hours i don't know how i know how i feel and feel sleepy right but no matter what i gotta face tomorrow this is the thing these statements are the things that carry me right that carry me right when when when i'm looking for god to uh manifest his promise these things is what carried me these this is the these promises and these quotes is the things that that you know when i feel like falling down and when i feel like giving up these things pick me up these things carry me glory to god amen he said when god has stepped the seal upon you you're it's you're to the end of your destination right uh let me see if i can go a little further he said when the government puts a seal upon a package the railroad puts a seal on a door that car cannot be tampered with until it reaches its destination see church this ain't from revival to revival right it's it's not it's not i you know i'm i'm so i'm weird y'all i do things purposely sometimes i do things sometimes to make people check themselves right say brothers molly you need to stop why right it's just we all different and one thing i learned i can't be none of these brothers but they can't beat me neither really i can't beat them and they can't beat me don't try to put me in a box but don't you know don't try to put them in my box right cause i'm one way here and i'm a whole nother animal when i go out i remember times the same the saints used to travel with me and they're like brother smiley you preach like this at home well i hate to say y'all don't eat pool like this at home either sometime see these people be under expectation y'all people be like time to make the donuts and see out there i can just blow off steam see and they won't see me again for six months i could say something here right and and i have to deal with y'all for six months look at that be funny that's the difference come on watch follow brother jack out i mean brother dad do a good job here but but i always enjoyed preaching the bible true tabernacle because i could preach things in a way that sometimes i couldn't preach out there right because it's so many when you're going when you go to a meeting it's so many so many spirits it's so many it's so much going on right it's so much it's so much going on and anybody that's running running around the church some folk be just hiding well praise the lord i'm about to close i'm finna get in trouble i'm gonna keep reading this quote right here about troy cups cause i'll get i'll i'll get in trouble but it's the truth in the hell you see a lot of hypocrisy see people can people could people can hide in a meeting and people people could pretend in a meeting that's right it's hard to do it well praise the lord let me go home i'm gonna get in trouble god i'm wasting up my life two minutes i'm about to i gots to go but but he says here um the car cannot be tampered with until it reaches its destination when god puts the seal upon a man and the seal of the holy spirit when he seals a man like that he is going to his eternal destination right never no more can he ever ever go back anymore right i'm gonna let y'all think about that statement cause remember grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you're sealed for all times nothing can't break that seal right see you are sealed forever you are sealed eternally into the kingdom of god by the holy ghost well i lighted that boy see these things help me it's forever it's eternal i'm in there i'm gonna be a part of this thing he says uh uh uh i got one more then i'm gonna go i think this is the same message uh he says then you the devil will punch at you right i think it's verse five he'll say everything to you and accuse you he's an accused other brother boy you know how you spoke to your wife boy and a christian and the bible the devil can quote you know the bible say love your wife as you love yourself boy yours you was mighty hard nowadays it's the s it's the sisters rough roughing up the men well praise the lord oh glory hallelujah i'm going out the door y'all make away from him i have to run to the car i'm telling you sisters nature's brother branham priest said this women used to blush in the presence of men they don't bless no more huh what hey they get so gangster you'll be like yes ma'am yes ma'am yes man but see when you do that i don't just christianize you i don't even take away your holy ghost but it's like you got a problem you got a problem see for any woman to talk to me off off-key yeah i might i'm not gonna argue and fuss with you right i'm not built like that you know i try to keep them that devil down dead cause there was a day if you talk to me like that i might knock your head off but i don't i ain't that person no more but it's lord so sometimes i just keep my lips closed see you can't right i'm gonna tell you what make people mad when they arguing by themselves when they somebody look man i'm not gonna entertain that now now when you want to have a a decent conversation right i'll talk with you but you you wanna when i get tired i'm gonna turn my back i'm going on right you say why you like that brother smiling i grew up with that i grew up seeing my uncles and aunts in my mind i'm screaming holler it's like the house is shaking folks screaming and hollering and this i said to myself as a young boy i said boy there's nowhere in the world i'm gonna be fussing and screaming and hollering and arguing with no woman i ain't finna do it now y'all brothers if y'all want to be fussing and arguing with y'all go ahead see how far you get blood pressure high everything somebody take me to the hospital somebody take me to the hospital elizabeth elizabeth it's i'm coming honey this is the big one this is the ring though you're not gonna kill me you know i'm not i'm a peaceful person man i'm not i'm not arguing with no brothers or no sisters no men and no women no i'm not look bro we ain't finna do this i'm like you're not gonna you know how to because when you i'm i'm i'm dropped something just dropped in the spirit when you're doing that you're borderline insane that's a quote come on you you right here at the line of insanity all right you all the time hey tell yourself i'm scared of you up in there go where you going going to my mama house a hotel or something i can't sleep with you y'all got to preach with me maybe this for my nephew when he get married one of these days huh you can't be doing that because if we doing that i'm leaving i'm leaving right what i'ma say this again not that we're doing it so don't y'all try to get your wheels turning i've been told y'all i don't argue with nobody i'm not gonna let my wife argue with me like that because i ain't gonna entertain that but i will say this if it comes to that i am leaving that situation if it cannot be rectified huh because somewhere somebody ain't saved y'all gotta talk to me now huh cause somewhere somewhere the word is being broken huh come on somewhere the word is being broken for you in order for you to do that the word has to be broken because there's an order and and and you know we we know brother bannon talks about not making the wife of a doormat but y'all just don't make the matter don't mat don't and don't make him don't don't um demoralize don't make him less than a man you know challenge his manhood come on mccloud in the bible come on see i'm gonna tell y'all something church people we do i ain't even talking about the outside world right around church there's a lot of damage that be done right in the midst of people are damaged because ministers are afraid preachers ain't preaching now people are afraid to say anything we're afraid we're gonna offend somebody right but if we don't say it who if we don't address the issue who going to address them who going to teach this young generation about about lord heaven i don't know how i always get get here right huh some maybe somebody we just need this right amen that's such a fine line there's a there's an order um and we stay with that man there's always be honey around the moon right we had our couples thing and everybody was you know folk was holding hands not everybody but you know that is right some folks were holding hands and folks was with with giving jabs but that that that was cute i mean that was that's wonderful especially newlyweds man you got two three years under your belt at least your whole hand when you get but you should always do a cabela capers assistant capable they'll put us to shame a lot of us you know i i don't know they pass but since i've known them for 30 35 years they've been the same they've been they've been they've been a couple right they they've been smiling at each other and all that brother cable was talking about when when sister cape was in the hospital the nurse was like whoa why was i at my husband like that he could be if you get out of the way and you stop stop trying to be be the hub and the wife he could be he could rub your feet lord have mercy let the muses make musicians make the way up that we'll lead at the couple's class let jack brother jackpot she have a couple's class huh whoa church i'ma tell y'all something y'all don't believe me probably there's a lot that still needs to be taught it's just the truth it's it's a lot that needs to be taught um because as men we we rough and we had these little tendencies and our thoughts and you know we don't want to show our tender side and you know there ain't nothing wrong with with being with being you know a little mushy showing that i ain't no punk you ain't gotta be no problem see you you say well why you say that because this is the way we grew up my generation my generation grew up this way right all of the information that we got from our daddies and cousins and uncles and right and sometimes it wasn't even things that they said it was their actions and so we thought that was right and then we grow up and you get in god you realize boy you were wrong with two left shoes and y'all know two left shoes is wrong try to put them on your feet it don't even work huh so so we we gotta reevaluate a lot of stuff man even even even me you know i'm still growing like i say i'm still evaluating still trying to understand myself and who i am and and and all of that and uh i'm not ashamed of that don't i say this don't look at me like i'm perfect i'm the first to tell you i'm not i'm scarred and flawed right i've been through a whole lot of stuff but uh but you know what i'm i'm still a part of resurrection amen amen i i just i just pray that let us stand something was said that that helped us um you know and uh y'all continue to pray for me pray the doors continue to open up for us and uh if y'all want to see me standing in chairs y'all might have to follow me out in the field somewhere uh but you know i i when i'm here i just feel like i'm at home and uh i uh i just feel like you know um it's two churches now in one location and i know brother jack the senior pastor and i just got a lot of experiences to share and this high priest when i when i had the church i i i can't be what i'm not i can only be who i am and uh so i just pray that you know after the discernments that you get something out of it and uh if you do i thank god for that but uh maybe when we take a meeting and we get out y'all to see the other side of the smiley maybe i'll stand on the chair for you i'm just kidding i stand on the town too heavy to be standing on 10. because you imagine 275 pounds on that chair man that check be like you better get off me before i collapse but but i appreciate the lord let's remember brother jack in prayer amen and the saints of god they they some everywhere this weekend but we appreciate your patience with us and
