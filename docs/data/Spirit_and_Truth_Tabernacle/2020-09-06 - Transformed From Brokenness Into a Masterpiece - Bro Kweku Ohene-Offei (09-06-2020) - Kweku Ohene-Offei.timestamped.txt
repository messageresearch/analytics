[42:06] amen glory hallelujah to the lord shall
[42:09] we pick our bible and just do a little
[42:10] reading
[42:14] um
[42:16] let's go to the book of joshua
[42:23] joshua chapter two i wish you can read
[42:26] the whole book but it's quite long
[42:29] wanted to pick a story here
[42:34] of how the lord can turn brokenness into
[42:36] masterpiece
[42:38] so we're going to go through that we're
[42:40] going to go pick him from where we left
[42:42] from
[42:43] we preach on a trans transforming from
[42:45] brokenness to masterpiece
[42:47] and we might if we want to give it a
[42:48] title we can put it transformed
[42:51] from brokenness to masterpiece or you
[42:53] can make it version two
[42:55] it doesn't matter amen transformed from
[42:58] brokenness into
[42:59] masterpiece let's go to the book of
[43:03] joshua
[43:05] let me make sure i have the scriptures
[43:07] right
[43:09] okay joshua chapter two verse one
[43:12] probably we might escape some of the
[43:13] verses
[43:14] and joshua the son of anand sent out of
[43:17] shittim
[43:18] two men to spy secretly saying go view
[43:21] the land even jericho
[43:23] and they went and they came into the
[43:25] halot's house
[43:26] named rahab and lodged there it was
[43:29] through the king of jericho saying
[43:31] behold
[43:32] they came in in heather to tonight
[43:35] of the children of israel to search out
[43:37] our country
[43:38] verse three and the king of jericho sent
[43:41] out rehab saying
[43:42] bring for the men that are come to thee
[43:45] who are entered into thine house
[43:47] for they become to search out all the
[43:49] country
[43:50] and the king of jericho said sorry and a
[43:52] woman took two men
[43:54] the two men and hit them and said and
[43:56] said that
[43:57] they came in unto me but i wish not once
[44:01] they were this is the king james version
[44:03] i don't know where they went
[44:04] yes surely men came to my house but i
[44:06] don't know where they went
[44:08] verse five and it came to pass about the
[44:10] time of shouting of the gate
[44:11] when it was dark that the men went out
[44:14] whether the men went
[44:15] i what not pursue after them quickly for
[44:18] you shall overtake them
[44:20] verse six but she had brought them up to
[44:23] the roof of the house
[44:25] and hit them with the stalks of flags
[44:27] which she had laid
[44:29] in order upon the roof and the men
[44:31] pursued after them
[44:32] their way to jordan onto the forts and
[44:35] as soon as they
[44:36] which as soon as they which pursuit
[44:37] after them were gone out
[44:39] they shut the gate and before they were
[44:41] laid lay down she came up onto the roof
[44:44] upon the roof and she said unto them i
[44:46] know that the lord
[44:48] god has given you the land praise god
[44:50] hallelujah
[44:51] who is searching for a land the lord god
[44:54] has given you the land
[44:56] you don't have to battle amen
[44:59] amen i don't want to jump i'll finish my
[45:02] reading but i want to say something the
[45:04] bible said in
[45:05] the new testament that you are more than
[45:07] conquerors
[45:09] let's break it down who is a conqueror a
[45:11] conqueror is the one who fight a battle
[45:14] or fight a war and win the victory but
[45:17] if you are more than a conqueror what
[45:18] does it mean
[45:19] right you don't have to fight a battle
[45:21] somebody wants a battery for you so you
[45:23] are more than a conqueror
[45:24] amen and the lord jesus christ won the
[45:26] battle for you
[45:27] so you are more than a conqueror you
[45:29] don't have to fight you have to
[45:30] surrender to him that's right glory
[45:32] hallelujah
[45:34] so which phase are we
[45:38] i think there's eight right and before
[45:40] they were let down and she said unto the
[45:42] men i know that the lord has given you
[45:43] the land
[45:44] and that your terror the fear of you is
[45:46] falling upon us and that all the
[45:48] inhabitants of the land
[45:49] faint because of you if we get to know
[45:52] our position
[45:54] situations will faint because of you
[45:56] amen
[45:58] glory hallelujah for we have heard how
[46:01] the lord dried up the water
[46:03] of the red sea for you when you came out
[46:06] of egypt
[46:07] and when did you and when you when when
[46:09] he
[46:10] he did unto the kings of the amorites
[46:12] that were on the other side
[46:14] of jordan sion and og whom he
[46:17] utterly destroyed and as soon as we
[46:19] heard
[46:20] of this our hearts did melt neither did
[46:22] they remain any more
[46:24] courage in any man because of you for
[46:26] the lord your god
[46:27] he is god in heaven above and in earth
[46:30] beneath
[46:30] amen look at
[46:34] rehab professing things that are all
[46:36] transfers of the lord
[46:38] that the lord is god of heaven above
[46:41] in other words god takes all the
[46:42] celestial dimension things that you
[46:44] can't see with his eyes
[46:46] he's taking care of angels theophanies
[46:49] demons things that you can see with your
[46:51] literal eyes
[46:53] and on earth below right here he's
[46:55] thinking of your situation
[46:57] so if the lord is with you why should
[46:59] you fear
[47:00] why should you panic why should you have
[47:02] a headache
[47:03] when the lord himself why do you have a
[47:05] migraine when the lord is in your
[47:07] situation
[47:08] just let him have control amen glory
[47:11] hallelujah
[47:13] glory glory and verse 12. now therefore
[47:17] i pray you swear unto me
[47:18] sway unto me by the lord since i have
[47:21] shown you kindness
[47:22] that you also show me kindness unto my
[47:24] father's house and give me a true
[47:26] talking that what is heavy talking a
[47:29] promise
[47:30] amen and all that and that you will save
[47:33] alive my father my mother my brethren my
[47:36] sisters
[47:37] and all that they have and deliver our
[47:39] lives from death
[47:41] the lady could see that there's an
[47:42] imminent death on their way
[47:44] and these people have got control over
[47:46] death they've got the power to give life
[47:48] and a power to kill amen if you have
[47:51] christ in you
[47:52] you've got the power to destroy the
[47:53] works of the enemy and the power to
[47:55] raise our life
[47:56] amen because the same jesus christ
[47:59] two thousand years passed ago the same
[48:01] jesus christ is leaving you
[48:02] and whatever the jesus christ of
[48:04] nazareth did you've got the authority
[48:06] and the power of heaven in you and the
[48:09] power in all the dimensions in you
[48:11] to do the same amen glory hallelujah to
[48:14] the lord
[48:15] because you're a little omnipotent you
[48:17] are christ
[48:18] you are not modern omnipotent because
[48:20] who your father is
[48:21] is who you are amen you take the jesus
[48:24] of your father
[48:25] and your mother so if your father is
[48:27] elohim you've got to make up genetic
[48:29] makeup of elohim
[48:31] if your father can speak into creation
[48:33] the same authority
[48:34] is vested in you by genetics by the
[48:37] token
[48:38] by the blood by the covenant by the
[48:41] lifeline
[48:42] amen glory hallelujah
[48:45] so then she let down the court through
[48:47] the window for the house was upon the
[48:51] i think i missed something okay and the
[48:52] man answered our lives
[48:54] for yours and you utter not our business
[48:57] and it shall be when the lord has given
[48:58] us the land
[48:59] then we will deal kindly and truly with
[49:01] thee then she let them down by the court
[49:04] through the
[49:05] window for her house was upon the town
[49:08] wall and she dwelt upon the wall and she
[49:10] said unto them
[49:11] get you to the mountain let's list the
[49:14] persuase meet you and hide yourself
[49:17] there three days until the persuasive
[49:19] return and after
[49:20] after what may you go your way and the
[49:23] man said unto her we will be blameless
[49:25] of this
[49:26] than oath which thou has made made us
[49:29] swear behold
[49:30] when we come into the land that shall
[49:33] bind this line of scarlet thread
[49:35] in the window which thou has which doubt
[49:37] these letters down by
[49:39] and thou shalt bring thy father thy
[49:41] mother thy brother
[49:43] and thy father's household home unto
[49:45] thee and it shall be that whosoever
[49:47] shall go out of the doors of that house
[49:49] into the street his blood shall be upon
[49:51] his head and we will be giftless and
[49:53] whosoever shall be with thee in the
[49:55] house
[49:56] his blood shall be on our head if any
[49:58] hand be upon him
[50:00] verse 20 and if thou alter this our
[50:03] business then we will be quit
[50:04] of that oath which thou has made us away
[50:07] and she said according to
[50:08] your words so be it and she sent them
[50:11] away
[50:12] and they departed and she bound the
[50:14] scarlet line
[50:15] in the window and they went and came
[50:17] onto the mountain about three
[50:19] about there three days until the
[50:20] persuasive returned
[50:22] and the pacers saw them throughout all
[50:24] the way but found them not
[50:26] so the two men returned and descended
[50:28] from the mountain
[50:29] and passed over and came to joshua the
[50:31] son of man and told them all the things
[50:33] that befell them
[50:34] and they said unto joshua truly the lord
[50:37] has delivered
[50:38] into our hands all the land for even the
[50:40] inhabitants
[50:41] inhabitants of the country do faint
[50:43] because of us
[50:44] amen may the lord add blessing to the
[50:46] reading of his word shall we be seated
[50:48] glory to the lord
[50:58] so we want to give it a title
[51:00] transformed from brokenness
[51:02] into masterpiece how the lord can take
[51:05] things that have
[51:06] broken things of no value
[51:09] since of no dignity and the lord can
[51:11] transform them
[51:12] and make them a masterpiece now if you
[51:14] take the word masterpiece
[51:16] you can break it into pieces master and
[51:18] peace
[51:19] master is if you bring it into artistic
[51:22] language
[51:23] someone who who is specializing in a
[51:25] craft he can take
[51:27] just a piece of wood and craft it like a
[51:30] sculptor put into pieces and
[51:31] make a wonderful design that can cause
[51:35] thousands and billions of dollars so it
[51:37] contains just a wood
[51:38] which is just a piece of food which is
[51:40] nothing which is broken
[51:42] cut into pieces and design something out
[51:44] of it
[51:45] in art they call something like a
[51:46] collage they can take
[51:48] maybe papers pieces of papers trash and
[51:51] assemble them together
[51:53] and make beautiful art forms with it so
[51:56] masterpiece is
[51:57] someone who can take something like a
[51:59] scrap something that is of no value
[52:01] let's say car manufacturers they take
[52:03] auto manufacturing vehicle metals
[52:06] plastics and different things meld them
[52:09] weld them use of course we are in the
[52:11] modern world use
[52:12] computerized machines and make ford make
[52:15] chevy make whatever vehicles you want
[52:18] out of them
[52:19] but those met those uh materials came
[52:21] from the earth
[52:22] which was just like ordinary metals
[52:25] nothing of any value
[52:26] but when they put it goes through the
[52:28] factory they melt it
[52:30] and then it comes out you see your brand
[52:32] new for now you can put
[52:33] paid a hundred thousand for that you can
[52:35] pay forty thousand
[52:37] because now the car has got the value
[52:39] it's become it passed through the fourth
[52:41] line so it's come up as a masterpiece
[52:43] now the natural type
[52:45] spiritual the lord does the same thing
[52:46] the lord can take your broken life
[52:49] your wretchedness you can take whatever
[52:51] you are
[52:52] which nobody even regards you your
[52:55] broken life
[52:56] your broken dignity your broken
[52:58] relationship and the lord can put them
[53:00] together
[53:01] and make a brand new nature out of out
[53:03] of you amen
[53:04] is anything hard for the lord no there's
[53:07] nothing that the lord cannot do
[53:09] all you need to do is surrender to the
[53:10] lord regardless of you don't have to
[53:12] think about your situation
[53:14] just give it to the lord in prayer and
[53:16] believe it
[53:17] and go the way the lord list you amen so
[53:20] we know rehab here
[53:21] her life was not a life of dignity she
[53:23] was a prostitute
[53:25] she was a woman of ill fame who is known
[53:27] by many men
[53:29] now god didn't choose out of the whole
[53:31] the people in jericho they were good
[53:33] women
[53:33] they were virgins there were great women
[53:36] there were women who had good
[53:37] reputations they were princes and
[53:39] princes maybe queens but the lord choose
[53:42] uh rahab to save god
[53:45] his spies amen there's nothing in the
[53:48] believer's life that is out of cater
[53:51] whatever happened to you is for a
[53:52] purpose amen
[53:54] whatever you go through is for the lost
[53:56] redemption in your life
[53:58] so that the lord can bring his
[53:59] attributes out of you
[54:01] amen because the lord is a deliverer
[54:03] he's a savior if nothing is lost he
[54:05] cannot save nothing
[54:06] if there's nobody sick doctors nurses
[54:09] pharmacists
[54:10] health care workers all of them will go
[54:11] back home because there's no job for you
[54:13] to do
[54:14] nobody comes to the hospital now this
[54:16] earth is a hospital
[54:17] full of sick people and that is the work
[54:20] the lord doctor jesus has specialized in
[54:23] healing people saving people
[54:25] transforming broken lives
[54:26] into masterpieces glory hallelujah so
[54:30] when the two spies came
[54:31] they found himself i mean in the house
[54:34] of this
[54:35] woman rehab and rehab was had the seed
[54:38] of god regardless of the
[54:39] the the outside there was something on
[54:42] the inside
[54:43] called a seed called a life of god
[54:47] called a presentation called the
[54:49] theophany called
[54:51] element of god a part of eternity
[54:54] elohim is in this woman was in that lady
[54:57] regardless of the outside
[54:58] the eyes i was shocked was nothing that
[55:00] you couldn't admire
[55:02] because she was a woman of what
[55:04] ill-famed but
[55:05] inside her is a seed of god before the
[55:08] foundation of the world
[55:10] before she became a prostitute the lord
[55:12] knew her amen
[55:13] glory hallelujah to the lord so this one
[55:16] came before the two men
[55:17] and they have to make a vow the vow is
[55:20] if you keep my business i'll keep your
[55:21] business
[55:22] so the woman realized that this men are
[55:24] not ordinary men
[55:26] the lord is with them amen and that is
[55:28] what a believer has to know his or her
[55:30] position
[55:31] if you know your position the situation
[55:33] circumstances will be afraid of you
[55:36] you will not be afraid of coronavirus
[55:38] but coronavirus has to be afraid of you
[55:40] coronavirus is just a manifestation of
[55:42] death angel
[55:43] upon the land a man is nothing that an
[55:46] angel of death moving across the whole
[55:48] earth
[55:49] or the continent destroying people is
[55:51] nothing different from what happened in
[55:52] the time of egypt
[55:54] when there was under there was a death
[55:56] angel going on on the land
[55:57] to kill the egyptians because of the
[56:00] sins and abomination
[56:01] of the earth the lord permitted the
[56:03] death angel
[56:04] to go about the earth and bring judgment
[56:07] upon the earth
[56:08] and also for mankind to know that the
[56:09] lord is the one who controls the earth
[56:11] not a putin not a a
[56:15] trump none of them but jesus christ is
[56:17] the one who controls the planet
[56:19] amen none of the atomic bombs and the
[56:22] hydrogen bombs and the nuclear weapons
[56:23] could save any mankind
[56:25] all of them were hiding all of them were
[56:27] in the india india india chambers all of
[56:30] them were some of them were taking
[56:31] chloroquine
[56:32] some of them were taking
[56:32] hydrochloroquine and different things so
[56:35] the only one who has got a power
[56:36] who has got a cecil is jesus christ amen
[56:40] not politicians no not religious people
[56:43] but the lord jesus christ when he say he
[56:46] says his word is he in amen
[56:47] and if the lord is in you you have to
[56:49] just let him come out of it
[56:51] and take control of our situations amen
[56:54] he that is in you
[56:55] is greater than he that is in the world
[56:57] the lord in you
[56:58] is greater than chronovirus if you it's

[57:46] amen sometimes it can appear in
[57:48] different forms into you to let you know
[57:50] in your life that there's a higher power
[57:52] who is in control for your life
[57:54] when situations get worse and you can't
[57:56] control those situations

[58:09] where there's nothing you can do about
[58:10] this situation you might
[58:12] feel you're going down but all of a
[58:14] sudden the lord will open the door for
[58:16] you
[58:16] you can use a human being you can use
[58:18] the word of the lord you can use signs
[58:20] and wonders
[58:21] you can use miracles you can use
[58:23] creation you can use the energy in the
[58:25] universe
[58:26] to change your situation regardless of
[58:28] whatever it might be
[58:29] amen it could be sickness it could be
[58:32] job
[58:33] it could be family issue it could be
[58:34] finance it could be whatever it is
[58:37] but the lord is the one who takes
[58:39] control i am the lord that god
[58:41] amen have no fear of no other god
[58:44] all the other guys are what they are
[58:45] dust everything else is creation of god
[58:48] don't worship vehicles don't worship
[58:50] human beings
[58:51] don't worship politicians don't worship
[58:54] religious men
[58:55] don't worship but worship the lord jesus
[58:56] christ who lives in your heart amen
[58:59] glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be
[59:02] the name of the lord
[59:04] so this woman was like i said was nobody
[59:07] but there was something in in her and
[59:09] when she saw the word
[59:11] in those two spies the word in her and
[59:14] the word in the spice of joshua
[59:16] connected
[59:17] the word calling upon the word deep
[59:19] calling for the deed
[59:20] this one confessed that we could see
[59:22] that the lord is with you
[59:24] and the fear of you is is upon the whole
[59:26] nation
[59:29] our kings and our soldiers they're all
[59:31] running away they can't face corona
[59:33] but there's god in heaven he's the one
[59:35] who takes control over every situation
[59:38] so this one asks for a sign i want a
[59:40] token
[59:41] to make sure that when you when you guys
[59:43] come and destroy the land
[59:44] my parents my family my loved ones are
[59:46] not destroyed and that took him was a
[59:48] red skelet
[59:49] that was symbolizing the blood of jesus
[59:51] christ which is the took him for all
[59:53] mankind
[59:54] amen that can deliver them from death
[59:56] but they say token
[59:58] that would develop you from judgment and
[59:59] distraction in this life and after this
[1:00:02] life
[1:00:02] and that token is the holy ghost baptism
[1:00:05] not the physical blood of jesus christ
[1:00:07] if the lord is here and he gives you his
[1:00:09] physical blood he's not going to profit
[1:00:10] you nothing
[1:00:11] because his blood is from the earth it
[1:00:13] went back to the earth
[1:00:15] but there was a life in the blood that
[1:00:17] is eternity itself
[1:00:19] that is eternal life that is the
[1:00:21] almighty god the creator himself
[1:00:23] when he comes to dwell in you by the
[1:00:25] seed by the new breathe
[1:00:27] by the holy ghost baptism by adoption
[1:00:30] there's nothing you should fear in this
[1:00:31] planet
[1:00:32] because everything is in your control
[1:00:35] by the christ in you amen your word
[1:00:39] is the word of the almighty when you
[1:00:41] speak your word is here and amen
[1:00:43] when you speak heaven speaks when you
[1:00:45] speak all the authority in the universe
[1:00:47] obey your word amen glory hallelujah to
[1:00:51] the lord
[1:00:51] blessed be the name of the lord so this
[1:00:53] one was given the red token
[1:00:55] and they told her to display the token
[1:00:57] on the door post
[1:00:58] somewhere around the house and everyone
[1:01:00] that would come under they took him
[1:01:02] will not be destroyed but those who stay
[1:01:04] outside they took him
[1:01:06] their blood would be upon their head and
[1:01:08] so when god has given you a token what
[1:01:09] is the token the holy ghost baptism
[1:01:11] you've got loved ones that you are
[1:01:13] praying and praying and crying after
[1:01:15] you bring them under your token under
[1:01:16] your love and you pray for them
[1:01:19] you can't physically go and arrest them
[1:01:20] and bring them to your lot to your house
[1:01:22] no your house is not where the
[1:01:24] your heart the holy ghost is where the
[1:01:25] token is amen and if you put your loved
[1:01:28] ones
[1:01:28] in your heart and you pray for them in
[1:01:30] your heart
[1:01:31] you pray for them and love them the holy
[1:01:33] ghost in you
[1:01:34] that redeem you will redeem your loved
[1:01:36] ones it's not it's not going to be on
[1:01:38] your time
[1:01:39] but it's going to be on the time of the
[1:01:41] lord jesus christ amen
[1:01:43] because he that is in you is greater
[1:01:45] than other universe
[1:01:46] is greater than the situations that hold
[1:01:48] your loved ones is greater than all the
[1:01:50] other barriers all the chains and
[1:01:52] darkness and each time that you pray
[1:01:55] the lord does something supernatural you
[1:01:57] might not see it visibly
[1:01:58] but the lord does something amen and at
[1:02:01] the right time
[1:02:02] things will fall in places for you so
[1:02:04] you just keep praying
[1:02:05] and keep believing amen glory hallelujah
[1:02:08] to the lord
[1:02:09] there are four elements on the earth the
[1:02:11] element of fire
[1:02:13] the earth itself a and a
[1:02:16] f water all the elements under the
[1:02:19] control of the creator
[1:02:21] and those elements are under your
[1:02:22] control a man
[1:02:24] this energy system in the universe on
[1:02:26] the planet
[1:02:27] and those energy system is controlled
[1:02:29] the lord put in the those energy system
[1:02:32] in the earth let me let him put in a
[1:02:34] simple way if you go to sometimes when
[1:02:36] you when you're distressed from what you
[1:02:38] go to
[1:02:38] park all the woods or a river to rest
[1:02:42] it calms you down you look at the blue
[1:02:44] skies you look at
[1:02:45] atmospheres you look at the animals they
[1:02:47] have an energy
[1:02:48] they have something about them it's part
[1:02:50] of its energy system the lord put in the
[1:02:52] creation
[1:02:52] to bring calmness how much more the word
[1:02:57] these are elements how much more the
[1:02:59] word of the lord the word of the lord is
[1:03:00] life
[1:03:01] itself is the source of life and when
[1:03:03] you eat the word
[1:03:04] into your heart the word takes away
[1:03:07] everything that is not of god
[1:03:08] it takes away sin it takes away unbelief
[1:03:11] it takes away your brokenness
[1:03:13] and transforms your life amen so the
[1:03:16] word himself is christ
[1:03:18] the word of the lord is not what is on
[1:03:19] the paper the paper is just an attribute
[1:03:22] that we can read to understand the word
[1:03:24] which is the lugas
[1:03:25] the logos is christ himself amen so
[1:03:28] through the written word the lord
[1:03:30] reveals himself in the revelation of the
[1:03:32] word what is the revelation of the word
[1:03:33] is christ himself amen
[1:03:36] what is the evidence of the holy ghost
[1:03:39] when you can receive the word
[1:03:41] know when you can read bible know when
[1:03:43] you can read and write
[1:03:44] bible verses no but when you can receive
[1:03:47] christ
[1:03:48] the word of the lord into your heart
[1:03:50] that will show that you've got christ in
[1:03:52] you
[1:03:52] that issue that has exceeded you that
[1:03:54] can eat the word of the lord
[1:03:56] glory hallelujah to the lord
[1:04:00] let's let's take another lady
[1:04:03] before the lamb captioned what i
[1:04:05] preached last week maybe some people
[1:04:07] were not here
[1:04:09] so that everyone will benefit glory
[1:04:12] hallelujah
[1:04:13] how the lord bring brokenness bring
[1:04:16] masterpieces out of brokenness last no
[1:04:19] last week i think two weeks ago
[1:04:21] we learned that when you go to the book
[1:04:23] of genesis
[1:04:24] man broke his fellowship with his maker
[1:04:26] christ
[1:04:27] but out of that brokenness the lord
[1:04:30] brought redemption the greatest
[1:04:31] redemption plan of salvation
[1:04:33] unto mankind exodus speaks about broken
[1:04:37] laws and
[1:04:37] commandments of god but god used those
[1:04:40] to prove that his mystery of salvation
[1:04:42] and grace is not on condition it's not
[1:04:45] on your merits
[1:04:46] but it's on the grace of the lord unto
[1:04:48] you amen
[1:04:50] that is unconditional love numbers the
[1:04:52] book of numbers depicts a broken
[1:04:54] covenant
[1:04:55] but god used to use it to establish a
[1:04:57] more excellent covenant
[1:04:58] in christ jesus without condition the
[1:05:01] first covenant was if you do this
[1:05:02] i'll do this if you tell the tree of
[1:05:05] knowledge of good and evil
[1:05:06] the day that you touch it you will
[1:05:08] surely die but now the
[1:05:10] second covenant was not based on if you
[1:05:12] touch something
[1:05:13] is the lord himself is a decreed
[1:05:16] commandment to you
[1:05:17] amen be holy how are you going to be
[1:05:19] holy
[1:05:20] how can a human in yourself be holy and
[1:05:23] please the lord
[1:05:24] but it's a decreed and declared
[1:05:26] statement that be
[1:05:28] holy in other words the lord has put
[1:05:30] something in you to make you holy
[1:05:32] amen not your holiness but this holiness
[1:05:36] in you because your holiness will not
[1:05:37] please the lord the bible said that your
[1:05:39] righteousness is a filthy rack
[1:05:42] unto the lord at the best of our
[1:05:44] righteousness
[1:05:45] without christ is a filthy dragon to him
[1:05:49] that's when a rich young ruler came to
[1:05:51] jesus christ
[1:05:52] and now that young man was holy he was
[1:05:55] consecrated to the lord
[1:05:57] to the god of moses he obeyed all the
[1:05:59] commandments
[1:06:00] man of the holiness of the lord had
[1:06:02] shifted from moses law
[1:06:04] unto grace unto the second covenant of
[1:06:06] unconditional love
[1:06:08] so all that this young men needed was to
[1:06:09] accept the lord jesus christ
[1:06:11] but he wanted to count upon his own
[1:06:12] merit he wanted the lord to approve his
[1:06:15] righteousness
[1:06:16] but the righteousness of the lord was
[1:06:18] the word for the hour and the day
[1:06:20] and he couldn't receive the word so he
[1:06:22] went back hopeless
[1:06:24] but they broken a woman at the wall of
[1:06:27] samaria
[1:06:28] oh let me finish this one before i go
[1:06:30] there glory hallelujah
[1:06:31] i'll go there so god is the broken
[1:06:33] covenant if you go to numbers
[1:06:35] god uses a broken covenant to depict a
[1:06:37] more excellent covenant in jesus christ
[1:06:40] when you read the book of psalms it's
[1:06:42] had as david pouring out his heart
[1:06:45] broken and a contract heart of king
[1:06:47] david
[1:06:48] god used this one to reveal his
[1:06:49] unconditional love for his elect
[1:06:51] sons and daughters amen if you take the
[1:06:54] book of kings
[1:06:55] it talks about broken prophet elijah
[1:06:59] he was broken as being chased by jezebel
[1:07:01] but god used the spirit of elijah time
[1:07:03] and time again
[1:07:04] five times amen god said behold i'll
[1:07:07] send you elijah
[1:07:08] before the great and dreadfully of the
[1:07:10] lord but this prophet was broken
[1:07:12] so he was run away from a woman jezebel
[1:07:15] but god
[1:07:16] can use your brokenness to bring
[1:07:18] redemption
[1:07:19] to do greater things amen
[1:07:22] if you look at a book of judges judges
[1:07:25] speaks about broken pictures in the
[1:07:28] hands of 300 men
[1:07:30] god used to show his victory over the
[1:07:32] enemy
[1:07:34] it doesn't matter the tools in your
[1:07:36] hands
[1:07:37] it doesn't matter how broken it is
[1:07:39] samson had a jawbone of an ass
[1:07:41] that's all he had and he had about a
[1:07:44] thousand men
[1:07:46] to face to fight how are you going to
[1:07:48] use a jawbone of an ass
[1:07:50] a job of a move of a cow of a horse
[1:07:53] to face thousand men those thousand men
[1:07:57] are they just standing there
[1:07:58] even if they are standing they are not
[1:07:59] fighting how are you going to kill
[1:08:01] thousand men with a jawbone of an ass
[1:08:03] don't you see there was a supernatural
[1:08:05] element behind a jawbone
[1:08:08] it wasn't the born but it was the lord
[1:08:10] jesus christ
[1:08:11] it was the overt gyra it was elohim
[1:08:14] using the jawbone in the hands of samson
[1:08:17] to slay those thousand men
[1:08:19] so now no matter what you have or your
[1:08:21] emptiness your mind
[1:08:23] your hands might not contain nothing but
[1:08:25] when you surrender it to the lord
[1:08:26] the lord can use it to kill thousand
[1:08:28] philistines
[1:08:29] amen you might not have nothing in your
[1:08:32] bank account
[1:08:33] but if i surrender your finances to the
[1:08:34] lord the lord can make millions
[1:08:37] out of you amen you might not have
[1:08:39] riches and houses and
[1:08:41] and things of this world but you
[1:08:43] surrender your life
[1:08:44] when you surrender your life to the lord
[1:08:46] the lord can use your life
[1:08:47] to save millions and to bring riches
[1:08:49] unto you and onto others
[1:08:51] glory hallelujah to the lord our god who
[1:08:54] make things out of brokenness
[1:08:56] in matthew we look at a broken loaves of
[1:09:00] bread in the hand of jesus christ
[1:09:02] the lord took piece two pieces of bread
[1:09:04] and three
[1:09:05] uh two pieces of bread and three fishes
[1:09:07] some something like that
[1:09:08] and it fed how many five thousand people
[1:09:11] and they were extras
[1:09:12] twelve baskets four in other words the
[1:09:14] lord can feed multitude
[1:09:16] out of the little that you you have amen
[1:09:19] uh
[1:09:20] mark talks about the lord can use
[1:09:23] uh broken things to feed the multitude
[1:09:26] the book of mark talks about broken roof
[1:09:28] when jesus was ministering unto the
[1:09:30] people it
[1:09:31] god uses to show how he can be
[1:09:33] approached no matter the obstacle
[1:09:36] regardless of the obstacle before you
[1:09:38] you don't have to go to
[1:09:40] pennsylvania to pray in the old
[1:09:42] testament they had a place of worship
[1:09:45] they have shiloh so yearly probably it's
[1:09:48] a long
[1:09:48] long distance so they go yearly with
[1:09:50] families but in the new testament

[1:10:11] when you are talking to people so you
[1:10:13] don't have any limit
[1:10:14] amen talking to the lord is not limited
[1:10:18] in no way you can pray in your mind in
[1:10:20] your heart
[1:10:21] in your thought in your sleep you can
[1:10:23] pray all day long

[1:13:37] from your life they have to seek christ
[1:13:40] in you
[1:13:41] if they are not seeing christ in you
[1:13:42] then keep praying
[1:13:44] amen
[1:13:48] if you're a human being and people don't
[1:13:49] see you a human being they think you're
[1:13:51] a cow
[1:13:52] then there's something wrong either the
[1:13:54] people are not seen right
[1:13:55] or maybe you are behaving you are
[1:13:56] walking as a cow your foot your hands on
[1:13:59] the ground so people thought you were a
[1:14:00] cow or you were a donkey
[1:14:02] amen but if you're human being
[1:14:05] even animals you know you're a human
[1:14:07] being sometime when an animal sees you
[1:14:09] they stand a fight and look at you
[1:14:11] if they haven't they are not experienced
[1:14:13] like what is this in their mind
[1:14:15] they also can think they can't reason
[1:14:17] but they can they have seen something
[1:14:18] they haven't seen before
[1:14:20] they've got spirit animals don't don't
[1:14:22] do not have souls
[1:14:23] but they've got spirit they can see with
[1:14:25] wearing blue jacket they could see this
[1:14:26] is not
[1:14:27] it doesn't look like the trees that it
[1:14:29] doesn't look like the green leaves
[1:14:30] they are used to those things in the
[1:14:31] woods but when they see you they could
[1:14:33] feel your spirit they have a spirit
[1:14:35] so they can stand and watch you it
[1:14:37] doesn't matter
[1:14:38] it doesn't have to be domestic animals
[1:14:40] i'm talking about animals in the woods
[1:14:42] you could be the raccoons it could be
[1:14:44] deer they watch you
[1:14:45] and they could even feel your spirit
[1:14:47] sometimes you see certain animals they
[1:14:49] want to walk after you
[1:14:50] and i've experienced it before animals
[1:14:53] walk where i was walking
[1:14:54] where i went to pray now down to pray a
[1:14:56] deer went to lie down right there
[1:14:58] where i went down to pray for a child of
[1:15:00] god so animals can't even see the spirit
[1:15:03] in you
[1:15:03] amen that you are the creator is living
[1:15:06] in you
[1:15:07] glory hallelujah to the lord so the fear
[1:15:09] cast off here and doubt away
[1:15:11] and let the lord jesus christ be in
[1:15:13] control glory hallelujah
[1:15:16] let's look at a broken roof when
[1:15:19] jesus was ministering the lord used it
[1:15:21] to be that he cannot he can no obstacle
[1:15:23] you can approach him there's no obstacle
[1:15:25] that can hinder you
[1:15:27] look the book of luke right about a
[1:15:28] broken alabaster oil
[1:15:30] god uses to show that he can accept even
[1:15:33] our brokenness
[1:15:34] a woman with a broken spirit broken life
[1:15:37] no good nobody regards this woman
[1:15:39] but she anointed the lord before her her
[1:15:42] burial
[1:15:43] amen with a broken alabaster oil that
[1:15:45] she bought with money from prostitution
[1:15:47] so even in your brokenness in your
[1:15:49] unworthiness the lord can see use you
[1:15:52] glory to the lord amen let's look at a
[1:15:55] broken hearted family
[1:15:59] lazarus in the book of john right about
[1:16:02] broken hearted family
[1:16:04] lazarus was that that laying dead
[1:16:07] god used the situation to prove that
[1:16:08] he's a resurrection and life
[1:16:11] when the only brother of two sisters was
[1:16:13] dead
[1:16:14] there was no hope for them they were
[1:16:16] grieving the lord used a situation
[1:16:18] to show them that he was the
[1:16:20] resurrection and he was alive
[1:16:22] and today he is the resurrection and
[1:16:24] he's alive because hebrews 13 8 says
[1:16:27] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:16:29] and forevermore
[1:16:31] is there any death situation in your
[1:16:32] life is there anything that i need to
[1:16:34] resurrect
[1:16:35] in your life what are you looking for
[1:16:37] this morning what is your objective this
[1:16:39] morning
[1:16:40] what is your desire why are you sitting
[1:16:43] here
[1:16:45] what what requests what did you think
[1:16:46] about before coming here
[1:16:49] whatever was on your heart before coming
[1:16:50] here there's a living crisis
[1:16:53] to take off your situation it doesn't
[1:16:55] matter how dead it is
[1:16:57] if it's your children if it's your
[1:16:59] husband your family if it's your job
[1:17:01] if it's your relationship if it's your
[1:17:03] marriage whatever it
[1:17:04] is if it's sickness the lord is here to
[1:17:06] heal you amen
[1:17:08] because he can create broken create
[1:17:10] masterpieces
[1:17:11] out of your broken condition glory to
[1:17:14] the lord in the book of um
[1:17:19] we read a broken net after fishing all
[1:17:21] night
[1:17:22] in the time of peter in peter's life god
[1:17:24] used the situation the happening to
[1:17:26] reveal his change of dispensation
[1:17:28] from the night of the church ages to the
[1:17:30] day the day time of revelation 10.
[1:17:33] now peter fished all night and the
[1:17:34] disciples didn't even get one fish
[1:17:37] but when jesus came to the situation he
[1:17:39] told them to cast their net
[1:17:41] at the other side and if you fish at the
[1:17:43] wrong side
[1:17:44] you only have one fish but if you fish
[1:17:47] at the right side
[1:17:48] you're going to have abandoned so your
[1:17:50] net will be even be breaking
[1:17:52] amen so you have to fish at the right
[1:17:54] where the word of the lord is
[1:17:56] in the old testament they have to go to
[1:17:58] shallow to pray that's where the lord
[1:17:59] put his name
[1:18:00] but in the new testament god has put his
[1:18:03] word
[1:18:04] if you find someone with the word of the
[1:18:05] lord whether he's a man
[1:18:08] he's a young person he's an old person
[1:18:10] he is where the lord who
[1:18:11] is where the word is amen when elisha
[1:18:15] saw that elijah had the anointing of the
[1:18:17] lord and there was a desire upon
[1:18:19] elijah's
[1:18:20] heart to get a double portion of what
[1:18:22] elijah has
[1:18:24] he didn't go after king king ahab no
[1:18:27] he didn't sit in the palace but he went
[1:18:30] after eli he followed elijah
[1:18:32] amen and if you have the elijah's
[1:18:34] ministry
[1:18:35] given in this hour malacca 10 malachi
[1:18:39] 5 4-5-5-6
[1:18:43] behold before us before the great and
[1:18:45] dreadfully of the lord
[1:18:46] i will send you like the prophet to turn
[1:18:48] the hearts of the children to their
[1:18:50] fathers
[1:18:51] who is the children the children are
[1:18:53] christianity who have gone into
[1:18:54] trinitarianism
[1:18:55] worshiping three gods with idolism god
[1:18:58] is turning our hearts
[1:18:59] from idol worshiping unto god of jehovah
[1:19:02] god of moses
[1:19:03] o israel the lord your god is one god we
[1:19:06] don't have three guys we don't have two
[1:19:08] guys we are not poli
[1:19:10] politistic polytheism is worship of more
[1:19:12] than one god
[1:19:14] we are not adult worshipers we have even
[1:19:16] certain idols worship only one god if we
[1:19:18] go to in the olden days egypt
[1:19:20] they knew that there was only one god
[1:19:21] even idol worshipers they called their
[1:19:23] god
[1:19:23] ra god of the son
[1:19:26] which was an adult worshiping how can we
[1:19:29] christians
[1:19:29] worship three gas trinity god the father
[1:19:33] god the son god the holy ghost which has
[1:19:36] got no basis
[1:19:37] in bible no basis in creation even
[1:19:40] animals
[1:19:41] trees the moon the sun they know that
[1:19:44] the america
[1:19:45] is one even the sea
[1:19:48] they know there's one maker there are
[1:19:50] not three guys who agree
[1:19:52] father son and jesus and the dove are
[1:19:55] green together no
[1:19:56] that is trash that is filthiness
[1:19:59] that is ungodliness amen it doesn't
[1:20:02] matter whether it's coming from
[1:20:03] religious big religious men
[1:20:04] from whichever pulpit the lord your god
[1:20:07] is only one god
[1:20:08] he is the lord jesus christ jehovah
[1:20:12] became he can translate himself the same
[1:20:15] jehovah he was in the time of moses adam
[1:20:17] he transformed himself i use the word
[1:20:20] theomorphy theo means
[1:20:21] god elohim murphy and morphy means
[1:20:24] changing forms so now god spanish people
[1:20:28] call it a deal
[1:20:29] portuguese causes adults friends say
[1:20:32] deal it's all
[1:20:33] around the same thing the same field
[1:20:35] theo
[1:20:36] god himself which is a from the greek
[1:20:38] origin transformed
[1:20:40] theomorphic himself from jehovah who was
[1:20:43] almighty when he was coming he attended
[1:20:47] there was lightning and flashing and
[1:20:49] fenders and and
[1:20:50] things where buildings were breaking and
[1:20:53] people couldn't stand it they said moses
[1:20:55] you were able to stand this we cannot we
[1:20:57] cannot stand it just
[1:20:59] news and come and tell us that's enough
[1:21:01] so the lord said okay i'll be selling
[1:21:02] you prophet
[1:21:03] but now the same guy said he loved
[1:21:05] mankind he loved you and lied so he
[1:21:07] wanted to come and live
[1:21:08] with you so emmanuel emmanuel means
[1:21:11] the lord with us so the lord himself the
[1:21:15] great almighty god
[1:21:17] who thundered he didn't even tell his
[1:21:18] name to moses moses said lord when i go
[1:21:21] and tell your people that you send me
[1:21:22] and if they ask me what is your name
[1:21:24] what do i say
[1:21:25] say tell them that i am that i am
[1:21:29] what is this i am that i am you give
[1:21:32] them that
[1:21:32] that that name i'll tell you later i am
[1:21:35] that i am but now he became
[1:21:37] a son right that's why sometimes we
[1:21:38] christian confused people
[1:21:40] who are not because son and you don't
[1:21:42] break it down people think like god
[1:21:44] married
[1:21:44] what do you mean by that jesus is the
[1:21:46] son of god so god had having a
[1:21:48] wife in heaven that demanded no he
[1:21:51] himself became a son means something
[1:21:53] coming out of you
[1:21:55] your son is a product from you is a jinn
[1:21:58] and your blood self coming from you
[1:22:00] so a son the flesh of jesus is called
[1:22:03] the son
[1:22:04] but in him the spirit and the soul is
[1:22:07] the same almighty god
[1:22:08] that was speaking to moses and to the
[1:22:11] children of israel
[1:22:12] so their son means their flesh is called
[1:22:14] their son
[1:22:15] it doesn't mean god had a wife elohim
[1:22:17] had a wife in heaven
[1:22:18] and married the way human beings were
[1:22:20] married no but he transformed himself
[1:22:22] from the thief from the celestial
[1:22:24] dimension created a body spoke a
[1:22:26] body into the womb of mary and then went
[1:22:28] into that
[1:22:29] that body called jesus little jesus who
[1:22:32] played like little children
[1:22:34] like little girls who did everything
[1:22:36] like every normal boy would do
[1:22:38] amen he was circumcised on the a day
[1:22:42] and he dwelled in that flesh to save
[1:22:44] mankind
[1:22:45] because mankind felt in this in the
[1:22:47] flesh in blood system
[1:22:49] so the lord the almighty has to leave
[1:22:52] the great
[1:22:52] dimension leave the angels leave all the
[1:22:55] glories of the celestial dimension
[1:22:57] and drop into flesh because you can't
[1:23:00] see if someone is drowning in a leak
[1:23:02] you can't stand on top of the lake and
[1:23:05] save the person about five feet or six
[1:23:07] feet
[1:23:07] is what feet am i right how many feet
[1:23:10] right
[1:23:10] five feet down no if you're a diver and
[1:23:13] you're a rescuer what do you do
[1:23:16] right get in there and just hold him and
[1:23:18] bring him out get the water out of him
[1:23:20] so the lord has to leave angels behind
[1:23:22] and then dive
[1:23:24] take a deep dive upon the earth come
[1:23:26] here to the lower basement
[1:23:28] coming into our muggles and fruitiness
[1:23:30] and sinful nature
[1:23:31] and become part of us amen that he can
[1:23:34] rescue you and
[1:23:35] you and i and that is a real diver
[1:23:38] a real a saver a real a water give me
[1:23:41] the term
[1:23:42] uh those who rescue people in decision
[1:23:45] knife lifeguard thank you
[1:23:46] he's a real life guard so he came to
[1:23:48] save us from our wretchedness
[1:23:50] amen it was the same almighty god in the
[1:23:52] time of moses
[1:23:54] now that wasn't enough he said i'll be
[1:23:55] with you
[1:23:57] elohim who was the almighty god said
[1:23:59] i'll be with you jesus
[1:24:01] but i want to be immanuel i want to be
[1:24:03] in you
[1:24:05] so that i'll become one with you one so
[1:24:08] after he died he resurrected and what
[1:24:10] did he do
[1:24:11] he came in another form called the holy
[1:24:14] spirit
[1:24:15] baptism king of sins he was the son of
[1:24:18] david
[1:24:19] to dwell in you and i so when brother
[1:24:21] solomon is working
[1:24:22] people know him as oh mr solomon maybe
[1:24:24] your workplace
[1:24:26] your your environment your family your
[1:24:28] friends
[1:24:29] but maybe some not all of them i know
[1:24:31] that the almighty is living in him
[1:24:33] amen when sisanami is working people
[1:24:36] might think oh this naomi i know her
[1:24:38] i mean i know her i know i know her i
[1:24:40] was a young friend right there we
[1:24:41] went to school together but they might
[1:24:43] not know that the almighty
[1:24:45] is dwelling in hair amen because the
[1:24:47] almighty has changed
[1:24:48] dwelling place again he moved from the
[1:24:50] tabernacle of jesus christ
[1:24:51] into 2000 plus years ago and came to
[1:24:55] live
[1:24:55] he's now living in your tabernacle is
[1:24:58] dwelling in you and i
[1:24:59] if you have the holy ghost baptism and
[1:25:01] if you don't have it today is the day
[1:25:03] amen as you hear the voice of god not my
[1:25:06] voice but the voice of god
[1:25:08] you hear is where they receive the word
[1:25:09] the word has got the power to transform
[1:25:11] it's supernatural
[1:25:13] it changes you amen and when you become
[1:25:15] jesus christ
[1:25:16] walk as jesus talk as jesus speak as
[1:25:19] jesus
[1:25:20] because your work you are jesus christ
[1:25:22] walking upon the earth

[1:25:26] christ you are embodiment of jesus
[1:25:27] christ
[1:25:28] working and what doing redemptive
[1:25:29] redemptive work as he did
[1:25:31] two thousand years ago amen that's why
[1:25:34] you carry burdens of people on
[1:25:36] on your shoulder the lord has given you
[1:25:38] that grace the loss
[1:25:40] is living in you it doesn't matter
[1:25:41] whether your sister a brother
[1:25:43] when you have the holy ghost you are
[1:25:45] just like rahab when
[1:25:47] rehab when he had it she had a token
[1:25:48] what did she do she wasn't selfish
[1:25:51] she said before she could even think
[1:25:53] about herself he said my father's house
[1:25:55] my mother my sisters and their family
[1:25:58] wow this one went she went far she could
[1:26:01] have talked about her boyfriend alone no

[1:26:07] my brothers-in-law sisters-in-law and
[1:26:09] their family my friends my neighbors
[1:26:11] everyone i want you to save everyone and
[1:26:13] jesus can go more than what
[1:26:15] you can even ask amen she can give you
[1:26:18] he can give you more than
[1:26:19] he gave rehab what a true spies given to
[1:26:22] rahab
[1:26:23] if you ask their loved ones your friends
[1:26:26] your country your neighbor your city
[1:26:28] the lord will do it amen if the lord is
[1:26:30] living in you
[1:26:31] he's not living in you for a show off
[1:26:33] he's leaving you for a purpose
[1:26:36] a function amen and you have to
[1:26:38] recognize that purpose
[1:26:40] for he taking upon all the flesh upon
[1:26:41] the planet he didn't live in in
[1:26:44] in the big peoples in the billionaires
[1:26:46] but he's living in you
[1:26:48] and you have to recognize who you are
[1:26:50] and the purpose that you're leaving you
[1:26:52] for you manifest that purpose
[1:26:54] amen the redemptive work of christ amen
[1:26:57] so that through you others will come to
[1:26:58] know him in the power of resurrection
[1:27:01] glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be

[1:27:21] use the pieces to save paul and all that
[1:27:23] were in the ship
[1:27:24] from death amen so the lord has got a
[1:27:28] broken body
[1:27:29] he said this my body when the lord
[1:27:31] before he died he took bread
[1:27:33] and wine brewed the bread and he said
[1:27:35] this is my body
[1:27:36] which is broken for you the physical
[1:27:38] bread was symbolizing his body
[1:27:40] the body of christ that will be broken
[1:27:42] for all of us
[1:27:44] that everyone will have a peace how can
[1:27:46] it be one person
[1:27:48] it wasn't his physical flesh but it was
[1:27:50] the spirit of the lord
[1:27:52] that was broken because when he was
[1:27:54] killed when he was broken on calvary
[1:27:56] i'll read that scripture for you he
[1:27:58] cried said ella elijah sabachthani
[1:28:01] my lord my lord the flesh was crying the
[1:28:03] human spirit in him jesus was 100 human
[1:28:05] being
[1:28:06] he got tired he slept he ate
[1:28:09] he cried he wept he did everything human
[1:28:12] beings do
[1:28:13] he gave his life to us so on the cross
[1:28:16] when he pierced him when he was done he
[1:28:18] cried my lord
[1:28:20] my lord why has thou forsaken me
[1:28:23] and the bible said that water and blood
[1:28:25] came from his side
[1:28:26] the water and blood is where you and i
[1:28:29] came from
[1:28:31] where he took our sin upon himself took
[1:28:33] our death
[1:28:34] he became death that you and i will
[1:28:36] become life
[1:28:38] amen he died for you that you may live
[1:28:42] he died for me that i'm gonna leave he
[1:28:45] took all my sins
[1:28:46] upon him that i will become his very
[1:28:48] righteousness
[1:28:50] you took all your sins all your
[1:28:52] brokenness
[1:28:53] all the wretchedness everything you can
[1:28:56] dream of every negative things you can
[1:28:57] think about in your life
[1:28:58] he took every iota of it he didn't leave
[1:29:02] any stone on ten
[1:29:03] he took all the blame upon himself
[1:29:05] because when he died
[1:29:07] heaven rejected him and the earth was
[1:29:09] already done with him
[1:29:11] there was darkness on the on the ninth
[1:29:13] hour at his death
[1:29:16] why darkness means gloom
[1:29:19] sin death death
[1:29:22] fell upon him and he died physically as
[1:29:25] a human being
[1:29:26] why because he took your sin he took my
[1:29:29] brokenness
[1:29:30] before even you committed your sin
[1:29:32] before even you were born
[1:29:34] there was a prize paid for you already
[1:29:36] there was a blood to
[1:29:38] save you there was redemption already
[1:29:40] for you that you become his
[1:29:41] righteousness
[1:29:42] for what to walk as a testimony that is
[1:29:45] alive today
[1:29:47] not that he's going to be resurrect no
[1:29:49] he already resurrected
[1:29:50] and he's living in you and i we are the
[1:29:53] waves being with upon the earth
[1:29:55] you know in the east in the time of
[1:29:56] israel they used to do a famine when you
[1:29:59] plant corn
[1:30:00] whatever mango whatever plant that you
[1:30:02] you you whatever
[1:30:03] fruit and plant that you plant you sowed
[1:30:07] when you get a first fruit you bring it
[1:30:09] to the high priest
[1:30:10] and the high priest will take your your
[1:30:12] your corn if it's corn
[1:30:13] the first corn fruit and wave it to the
[1:30:16] lord
[1:30:17] that lord thank you for the first fruit
[1:30:19] may all the fruits
[1:30:20] all the plants come i mean bear fruits
[1:30:22] like this one
[1:30:23] so the lord jesus christ were the first
[1:30:25] fruit who was weaved
[1:30:27] upon the earth he was the one who
[1:30:29] resurrected
[1:30:30] a man he was the first person to
[1:30:32] resurrect and when is erected
[1:30:34] he brought resurrection onto all mankind
[1:30:37] that's why you and i
[1:30:38] are resurrected from sin not resurrected
[1:30:40] from from physical grieva
[1:30:42] no if you die and israel you're going to
[1:30:44] die again
[1:30:45] lazarus was resurrected but what
[1:30:47] happened he died physically again
[1:30:49] so the resurrection i'm talking about is
[1:30:51] not leaning the tomb yes the lord does
[1:30:53] it
[1:30:53] i've seen it twice before the lord
[1:30:55] that's it people who died and lord bring
[1:30:57] them back from life
[1:30:58] that's not but the most important
[1:31:00] resurrection is when you are dead in sin
[1:31:01] and unbelief
[1:31:03] your soul is dead you are broken and
[1:31:06] wretched
[1:31:07] you could see you could see within you
[1:31:08] there's nothing good in you
[1:31:10] but there's another voice that tells you
[1:31:12] my daughter
[1:31:13] my son you are mine and nothing can take
[1:31:16] you for my life
[1:31:18] that is your resurrection amen glory
[1:31:20] hallelujah
[1:31:26] glory hallelujah to the lord so
[1:31:29] transform from life i want us to read
[1:31:30] one more scripture
[1:31:33] look at another let's look at john john
[1:31:35] chapter four
[1:31:38] let's look at another broken life broken
[1:31:41] dignity
[1:31:43] broken marriage broken relationship
[1:31:45] broken whatever you can call it
[1:31:47] and let's see how the lord took this
[1:31:49] broken woman
[1:31:51] at samaria and turned her life around
[1:31:54] and not only her
[1:31:55] but use her life to save others so if
[1:31:58] you have your bible let's go to john
[1:32:00] chapter four
[1:32:01] let's read um verse one
[1:32:07] when therefore the lord knew how the
[1:32:09] pharisees had heard that jesus made
[1:32:12] and baptized more disciples than john
[1:32:14] though jesus himself baptized not but
[1:32:16] his disciples
[1:32:18] he left judea and departed again to
[1:32:20] galilee
[1:32:22] and he must he must need go through
[1:32:24] samaria
[1:32:25] then comment here to the city of samaria
[1:32:27] which is called
[1:32:28] psycha near to the parcel of ground
[1:32:31] that jacob gave to his son joseph now
[1:32:34] jacob's world was there
[1:32:36] jesus therefore being worried with his
[1:32:38] journey
[1:32:39] sat thus on the world and it was about
[1:32:41] the sixth hour
[1:32:42] in those time the counter time in hours
[1:32:44] first hour
[1:32:45] third hour six hour ninth hour and so
[1:32:47] forth there cometh a woman of samaria to
[1:32:50] draw water
[1:32:51] jesus said unto her give me to drink
[1:32:54] for his disciples who have gone away
[1:32:56] onto the city to buy meat
[1:32:58] verse nine then said the woman of
[1:33:00] samaria unto him
[1:33:02] how is it that being a jew ask drink of
[1:33:04] me
[1:33:05] which i'm a woman of samaria for the
[1:33:07] jews
[1:33:08] i have no dealings with the samaritans
[1:33:10] racism didn't start today
[1:33:12] racism was way back in bible times
[1:33:15] so let's see then jesus answered and
[1:33:17] said unto him he thou knew was the gift
[1:33:19] of god
[1:33:19] and who it is that seed to thee give me
[1:33:22] to drink
[1:33:23] thou would ask would have asked of him
[1:33:26] and he would
[1:33:26] give thee the living water so now jesus
[1:33:29] was using
[1:33:30] finding a way into a spirit if you want
[1:33:32] to help somebody
[1:33:34] don't look at it from the outside look
[1:33:37] at it from the outside but go inside
[1:33:39] if you've got a spiritual eye so jesus
[1:33:41] was looking at trying to descend her
[1:33:43] problem
[1:33:44] so the water is just a conversation to
[1:33:47] get into his soul
[1:33:48] so he was striking a conversation with
[1:33:50] this uh woman
[1:33:52] trying to go into a suit to see her
[1:33:53] problem because he got another
[1:33:55] third eye beside the two eyes jesus has
[1:33:57] got a third eye from from the inside out
[1:33:59] eternity
[1:34:00] and you have got the same eye you've got
[1:34:01] a third eye beside your two eyes
[1:34:03] what is that eye is the eye of faith the
[1:34:06] eye of revelation
[1:34:07] the lord in you so let's see how the
[1:34:09] conversation
[1:34:10] ensued um
[1:34:12] [Music]
[1:34:14] last night we read that one we read that
[1:34:16] one verse 10. he said jesus said if okay
[1:34:18] verse 11 then the woman said unto him
[1:34:20] say thou has nothing to draw with
[1:34:23] and the world is deep from whence then
[1:34:25] has thou
[1:34:26] the living water are thou greater than
[1:34:29] our father jacob which gave as the world
[1:34:31] and drunk there himself and his children
[1:34:33] and his cattle
[1:34:34] jesus answered and said unto her
[1:34:36] whosoever drinketh of this water shall
[1:34:38] fast again
[1:34:39] but whosoever drinketh of the water that
[1:34:41] i shall give him
[1:34:42] shall never fast but the water that i
[1:34:45] shall give him
[1:34:46] shall be in him a world of water
[1:34:47] springing up into
[1:34:49] everlasting life in other words eternal
[1:34:51] life
[1:34:52] the woman said unto her say give me the
[1:34:54] this water
[1:34:55] that i fast not neither come heather to
[1:34:57] draw jesus said unto her go call that
[1:35:00] husband
[1:35:01] and come either the woman said answered
[1:35:03] and said i have no husband.
[1:35:05] jesus said unto her thou has well said i
[1:35:08] have no husband
[1:35:09] for thou has had five husband and he
[1:35:12] whom thou
[1:35:13] now has is not a husband in that says
[1:35:16] doubt truly
[1:35:17] the woman said unto him say i perceive
[1:35:20] that
[1:35:21] thou art a prophet our fathers worshiped
[1:35:23] this mountain
[1:35:24] worshiping this mountain and you see
[1:35:27] that in jerusalem is the place where men
[1:35:29] ought to worship
[1:35:30] jesus said unto her woman believe me the
[1:35:33] hour cometh
[1:35:34] when you shall neither in this mountain
[1:35:37] nor in jerusalem
[1:35:38] nor jerusalem worship the father but the
[1:35:41] hour cometh 23
[1:35:43] and now is when the true worshipers
[1:35:45] shall worship the father in spirit
[1:35:47] and in truth for their father's secret
[1:35:49] search
[1:35:50] to worship him god is a spirit and they
[1:35:53] that i worship him must worship him and
[1:35:55] spread it in truth
[1:35:56] then the woman said unto him i know that
[1:35:58] messiah cometh which is called christ
[1:36:01] and when he's come he will tell us these
[1:36:02] things jesus said unto her i that speak
[1:36:06] unto thee am he and upon this came his
[1:36:09] disciple a marvelled that he talked with
[1:36:12] a woman
[1:36:13] yet no man said why secret thou or why
[1:36:16] torquez thou the woman then left
[1:36:17] the water pot and went into the city
[1:36:20] let's see what happened after that
[1:36:22] went into uh went to the city and said
[1:36:24] unto the men
[1:36:25] come see a man which told me all things
[1:36:28] that
[1:36:28] i ever did it's not this them the christ
[1:36:31] then they went out to the city and came
[1:36:33] unto him in the meanwhile the disciples
[1:36:36] praying said unto him master it but he
[1:36:38] said unto them i have
[1:36:40] met to eat that you know off you know
[1:36:42] not of
[1:36:43] therefore sell the disciples one to
[1:36:45] another had anyone brought him meat
[1:36:47] jesus said unto them my meat is to do
[1:36:49] the will of him that sent me and to
[1:36:50] finish his work
[1:36:52] amen jesus forfeited his lunch
[1:36:57] for further going to the city for the
[1:37:00] sake of this broken
[1:37:02] no dignity wretched woman
[1:37:06] amen when you have a need
[1:37:09] this one didn't even pray it was the
[1:37:12] time that they have preached they are
[1:37:13] tired it's time to go and go and buy
[1:37:15] lunch
[1:37:16] and just to the disciples i'll go get a
[1:37:18] lunch
[1:37:19] because his lunch was to do the will of
[1:37:21] his father
[1:37:23] his lunch was to look for the sons and
[1:37:26] daughters of jacob
[1:37:27] his lunch was to look for sons and
[1:37:29] daughters of god
[1:37:30] who have been kidnapped by the enemy
[1:37:33] broken into pieces
[1:37:34] by circumstances of life and they are
[1:37:37] mourning and crying and weeping
[1:37:39] there are people that have no joy they
[1:37:41] go to bed
[1:37:42] they cry and wet their pillows there are
[1:37:45] people that walk around could be your
[1:37:46] co-workers
[1:37:47] you they might smile they might have a
[1:37:49] makeup on their face
[1:37:51] but deep on the inside is full of sorrow
[1:37:55] and and wretchedness and the lord put
[1:37:57] some of these people in your path
[1:37:59] the lord put you in the path of some of
[1:38:02] those people
[1:38:03] that you will be the arm of salvation
[1:38:05] unto them
[1:38:07] just like this woman who received mercy
[1:38:10] she had a five husband the sixth one
[1:38:13] but she needed a seventh husband seven
[1:38:15] is the number of completion
[1:38:17] and all the husbands all of us need that
[1:38:19] husband the lord jesus christ
[1:38:21] because without him you are not married
[1:38:24] so i've married for 50 years i've got
[1:38:25] children grandchildren no you're not
[1:38:27] married if you don't have jesus christ
[1:38:30] the true marriage is married to the son
[1:38:32] of god
[1:38:33] married to christ the word married to
[1:38:36] god himself god wants to have that
[1:38:39] relationship with you
[1:38:40] so regardless of how many children you
[1:38:41] have under your marriage
[1:38:43] or how long you married if you are not
[1:38:45] married to the lord jesus christ
[1:38:47] today is the time to have that wedding
[1:38:49] and you can have it right now
[1:38:50] amen and that's where speaking weddings
[1:38:52] are going on right now god is marrying
[1:38:54] to his people
[1:38:55] amen marrying to the word marrying to
[1:38:57] eternal life
[1:38:59] and god put people in your life that
[1:39:02] when you open your eyes
[1:39:03] when you are sensitive enough you will
[1:39:06] be the
[1:39:06] arm of deliverance unto those people
[1:39:09] just like jesus
[1:39:10] was an arm of deliverance onto the woman
[1:39:13] of
[1:39:13] of samaria and when this woman received
[1:39:16] greece
[1:39:17] she went she threw the water pot away
[1:39:19] went into the city
[1:39:20] come and see a man that i found he told
[1:39:24] me all that i
[1:39:25] have done all my wretchedness there was
[1:39:27] nothing that was hidden

[1:39:56] to the lord
[1:39:58] let him know your situation let me know
[1:40:00] that you need deliverance
[1:40:01] maybe not for yourself for your family
[1:40:04] for your relationship
[1:40:05] for your husband for your children for
[1:40:07] your parents
[1:40:08] for your neighbors for somebody who
[1:40:11] might not be your physical bloodline
[1:40:13] by your co-worker somebody on the street
[1:40:15] begging
[1:40:17] when you hit a traffic light you look at
[1:40:18] that person so poor
[1:40:20] poor old what do you call it a homeless
[1:40:22] person
[1:40:23] for you you despise him no you don't
[1:40:27] you're not supposed to do that
[1:40:28] you probably to show your heart he said
[1:40:30] mankind he's the daughter of god
[1:40:32] he's a daughter of abraham son of
[1:40:34] abraham life situation has put her in
[1:40:36] that broken situation
[1:40:38] and if you cannot give him a penny you
[1:40:40] can pray for him or her
[1:40:42] amen if you cannot maybe you are not
[1:40:44] trapped you cannot go down and say god
[1:40:46] bless you my brother my sister
[1:40:47] you can pray lord the holy ghost in you
[1:40:49] is not limited remember you read from
[1:40:50] the bible
[1:40:51] god is not limited you can speak the
[1:40:53] word in your heart
[1:40:54] you can have a thought of goodness to
[1:40:56] that person sitting there begging
[1:40:58] running around begging
[1:40:59] on drugs on cocaine on marijuana you can
[1:41:03] speak into his life
[1:41:04] i've seen people that never i didn't
[1:41:05] even i heard them having conversation
[1:41:08] about stopping
[1:41:09] trying to stop cigarette smoking i
[1:41:11] didn't have a word with them i didn't i
[1:41:12] had a co-workers
[1:41:13] i didn't say nothing to them i just look
[1:41:16] at them they were having their
[1:41:17] conversation in the
[1:41:20] teacher's room and i was listening to a
[1:41:22] conversation this person said i've
[1:41:23] smoked for this number of years
[1:41:25] i want to quit it's about time for me to
[1:41:27] quit and i was just watching them
[1:41:29] and my heart went after them i didn't
[1:41:31] ask them i want to pray for you
[1:41:34] and one of them stop smoking the other
[1:41:37] one stop smoking and sweet to switch to
[1:41:39] another one
[1:41:40] i know by this time you stop smoking all
[1:41:41] together because there's something in
[1:41:43] you
[1:41:44] that when you project the love of god
[1:41:47] the sovereign grace of god takes over
[1:41:50] and i saw this one talking about smoking
[1:41:51] going through the difficult time when
[1:41:53] you smoke and nicotine is addictive
[1:41:55] so when he was quitting he was having a
[1:41:56] hard time he said but i'm determined and
[1:41:58] i was praying for him i was just
[1:42:00] letting my energy the lord in me
[1:42:02] touching him without physically going to
[1:42:04] say nothing to him
[1:42:05] and the lord makes the lord has a way of
[1:42:07] letting you know what you need to know
[1:42:09] when we are there he'll be having a
[1:42:11] conversation it's hard for me it's very
[1:42:13] difficult it's tough
[1:42:14] i mean i quit koteki and it's hard i
[1:42:17] feel like going back but i don't want to
[1:42:18] go back
[1:42:19] yes lord glory hallelujah and i just put
[1:42:22] the energy to him
[1:42:23] he doesn't know that i was praying for
[1:42:25] him in my heart
[1:42:27] but the lord almighty knew it and he
[1:42:29] quit smoking
[1:42:30] he doesn't smoke no more
[1:42:34] [Applause]
[1:42:36] there's something in you that is a lord
[1:42:39] that when you let him project
[1:42:42] he operates on your choices sometimes
[1:42:45] you operate on what you let him to do if
[1:42:48] you limit him in your mind
[1:42:49] that lord i want you to go so far that's
[1:42:52] how much fire can go
[1:42:55] there's a story in i think a brazilian
[1:42:57] family told me
[1:42:59] that a man had a christmas uh
[1:43:02] christmas celebration and he he prepared
[1:43:04] a chicken
[1:43:05] and he said our chicken wanted to invite
[1:43:07] jesus to come and participate with the
[1:43:09] chicken
[1:43:10] a fiesta festival for you chicken
[1:43:12] festival
[1:43:13] pollo di carlo di pollo so that's what
[1:43:15] spanish college right
[1:43:16] so this man was waiting for jesus to
[1:43:19] come and
[1:43:20] dang with him with his chicken and
[1:43:21] somebody knocked on the door
[1:43:23] there was a little little tiny girl so
[1:43:25] hungry chicks
[1:43:26] protruding and he said can i have
[1:43:28] something to eat
[1:43:29] i said well i mean uh i have a chicken
[1:43:32] but you know that
[1:43:32] chicken is for jesus so i can give you
[1:43:34] the the defeat
[1:43:36] so this man broke a little feet one of
[1:43:39] the chicken pieces
[1:43:40] that fit and gave it to the girl the
[1:43:42] girl said thank you she went
[1:43:44] and after a while this man was waiting
[1:43:45] for jesus to come and come and
[1:43:47] have this dinner a chicken fiesta with
[1:43:50] him with him and
[1:43:52] after a while somebody knocked on the
[1:43:53] door and they saw this
[1:43:55] man limping with broken legs and i mean
[1:43:58] he said i want something to eat i've not
[1:44:00] eaten in a while say well
[1:44:02] i have a chicken face but you know it's
[1:44:03] for jesus so but i can do a favor or
[1:44:06] give you one arm so the man took a piece
[1:44:08] of arm and gave it to uh
[1:44:10] the old man the woman said thank you he
[1:44:12] went i mean chewing on the chicken
[1:44:14] and a third person came another a young
[1:44:15] boy came very hungry
[1:44:17] and he was asking for to eat he gave it
[1:44:19] peace and this man waited and waited and
[1:44:20] waited
[1:44:21] a long time so finally jesus came and
[1:44:24] said lord
[1:44:26] i think in a dream he said lord i've
[1:44:27] waited for you
[1:44:29] a long time to come and down with me you
[1:44:31] didn't come you came too late he said
[1:44:32] well

[1:44:37] so i came in the form of the girl
[1:44:40] with protruding cheek hungry
[1:44:44] and you gave me a piece and the lord
[1:44:46] showed him the peace
[1:44:48] i came in the form of the old man
[1:44:50] wretched
[1:44:51] maybe he's thinking i didn't take in
[1:44:53] shower in in in probably years
[1:44:55] you gave him a piece of arm i came in
[1:44:58] and found a little girl
[1:44:59] who was hungry and he gave me a peace
[1:45:02] that was me i said oh lord
[1:45:06] if i knew you were the little girl if i
[1:45:09] knew you were the old man
[1:45:11] if i knew you had a little boy i would
[1:45:13] have given you the breasts
[1:45:14] and everything about the chicken and the
[1:45:17] potato and everything all this you and
[1:45:18] the gravy that went with it

[1:45:49] beggar
[1:45:50] regardless of what they wear regardless
[1:45:53] of who they
[1:45:53] are regardless of their position
[1:45:57] treat them with your heart as you treat

[1:49:15] us so much that we should also give it
[1:49:17] to others
[1:49:20] because we were also broken at one point
[1:49:21] in time
[1:49:23] we were broken and wretched we didn't
[1:49:25] have anything good
[1:49:27] but the lord brought something good out
[1:49:29] of our brokenness
[1:49:30] let's look at how the lord use
[1:49:34] a few more broken situations and we'll
[1:49:37] be done for the day
[1:49:38] praise be to god let's use how the lord
[1:49:41] used broken funeral
[1:49:42] procession to raise a dead person
[1:49:47] time will not permit i'll give you the
[1:49:48] scripture second kings
[1:49:50] 13 20-21
[1:49:54] probably i can't read oh it's only two
[1:49:56] verses i think i can do that second
[1:49:57] kings
[1:49:58] 13 20 to 20 20 to 21 20 and 21
[1:50:03] and elisha died and they buried him
[1:50:06] and the bands of the moabites invaded
[1:50:07] the land at the camel
[1:50:09] are they coming in the year and it came
[1:50:11] to pass as they were burying a man
[1:50:13] that behold despite a band of men
[1:50:16] and they cast their man into the sipoca
[1:50:18] see what is a
[1:50:20] tomb of elijah and when the man was let
[1:50:22] down
[1:50:23] and touched the bones of elijah he
[1:50:25] revived
[1:50:26] and stood upon his feet glory hallelujah
[1:50:31] there was a funeral procession people
[1:50:32] holding cascades they didn't have
[1:50:35] this sophisticated uh heads and
[1:50:38] ambulances and vehicles and you know
[1:50:40] they use their men use their hands they
[1:50:42] haven't grabbed their casket
[1:50:44] let's go so they went and they saw these
[1:50:46] enemies
[1:50:49] and when they saw the enemy hey this one
[1:50:51] is already dead
[1:50:52] i'm not going to lose my life for the
[1:50:54] sake of a dead person
[1:50:56] no let's have an idea let's throw this
[1:50:57] now and run for our lives so they throw
[1:50:59] their casket
[1:51:00] and quickly run for their life and the
[1:51:02] casket didn't land anywhere but where
[1:51:04] elijah the prophet was buried that's
[1:51:07] where the casket landed
[1:51:08] and this man that person resurrected on
[1:51:12] his feet
[1:51:15] how a broken family
[1:51:19] broken funeral possession there was a
[1:51:22] resurrection
[1:51:23] and i saw the lord reveal my something
[1:51:25] to me last night
[1:51:27] as i was thinking about that god used a
[1:51:29] broken dead man
[1:51:30] hitting the bone of elisha and to show
[1:51:33] that there's
[1:51:34] life in death even in death
[1:51:37] there's life and number two
[1:51:41] prophets and christians cannot die
[1:51:45] prophet and christian do not die they
[1:51:48] only change
[1:51:49] their dwelling places there's a
[1:51:51] dimensional change
[1:51:52] but they don't really die in the flesh
[1:51:55] yes
[1:51:55] humanly speaking jesus died how can
[1:51:58] almighty died
[1:51:59] in their flesh this flesh has a
[1:52:01] beginning
[1:52:02] that's why we have braved this the day
[1:52:04] we were born so they said you're gonna
[1:52:06] be have a last birthday whether you drop
[1:52:08] to the earth or whether you come up from
[1:52:10] the flesh and go to the other dimension
[1:52:12] right here
[1:52:13] we can call it death but christians and
[1:52:16] prophets do not die
[1:52:18] amen so elisha wasn't dead
[1:52:22] he changed his dwelling place and one
[1:52:24] revelation the lord gave you to realize
[1:52:26] if elisha was alive
[1:52:29] he was a person to pray for the dead for
[1:52:32] the dead uh
[1:52:33] for for the son of uh for the for the
[1:52:35] young man the person that was dead
[1:52:37] but because he wasn't in the physical
[1:52:39] dimension to pray for this man who was
[1:52:41] dead
[1:52:43] he died his mother lost the sun
[1:52:46] but the sovereign lord has a way of
[1:52:48] doing things
[1:52:49] the lord raised an enemy who were coming
[1:52:53] he
[1:52:53] the lord knew that this people were
[1:52:54] afraid of this enemy so this enemy were
[1:52:56] coming they didn't even see them
[1:52:58] but they fear of them let this young men
[1:53:01] who are going to bury the dead person
[1:53:03] drop the casket and i mean run for their
[1:53:06] life
[1:53:07] and the cascade landed on the sepoka the
[1:53:09] tomb of elijah
[1:53:10] and elijah in the celestial dimension
[1:53:13] spoke into creation
[1:53:15] spoke his life back to him how can a
[1:53:18] dead person
[1:53:19] raise a dead person it wasn't a dead
[1:53:22] elijah
[1:53:23] it was jesus christ he has a ministry
[1:53:27] the lord has spirits if you read a book
[1:53:29] of revelations there's seven spirits
[1:53:30] there's only one spirit but the form of
[1:53:33] manifestation
[1:53:34] is different the way brother solomon
[1:53:36] sings
[1:53:38] if you told me to come and sing like him
[1:53:41] i'll get a sore throat
[1:53:47] yeah because i cannot the lord didn't
[1:53:50] give me that makeup
[1:53:52] i can sing in the kitchen i can make a
[1:53:54] little noise to the lord but i don't
[1:53:55] have this
[1:53:56] the voice the tone how the lord did it
[1:53:59] the lord did it
[1:54:00] so the lord has a form of anointing that
[1:54:02] check with brother solomon's voice
[1:54:04] with my sisters my brothers the lord has
[1:54:07] a form of
[1:54:08] using the piano as my sister and sister
[1:54:11] rachel
[1:54:12] and their sisters how they play if you
[1:54:14] put me here
[1:54:15] i'll stare at you i don't know how to do
[1:54:16] it
[1:54:19] i don't know how to do it i don't know
[1:54:21] how to do it i just don't know the keys
[1:54:23] i don't even know the keys the only key
[1:54:24] i know is the key of key
[1:54:26] the key of cocoon i can sing that's
[1:54:27] that's make a melody to the lord a
[1:54:29] joyful noise
[1:54:31] i can't do what but i tried it this
[1:54:33] morning no
[1:54:35] so the lord has got different not one
[1:54:37] spirit but different way so the bible
[1:54:39] said
[1:54:40] seven spirits uh um
[1:54:43] paul up to abraham it's only one spirit
[1:54:46] but it works in different different ways
[1:54:49] so uh
[1:54:50] the lord has a spirit called elisha a
[1:54:52] prophetic elijah double anointing
[1:54:54] which is a form of elijah but the noble
[1:54:56] anointing so if elijah elijah was alive
[1:54:58] he was the one to pray for this woman
[1:55:01] and the sovereign lord has to make a way
[1:55:02] that they have to go to elijah for
[1:55:04] prayer
[1:55:05] even her dead body on the tomb the pill
[1:55:08] of fire was still there
[1:55:10] the theophany of elijah was still around
[1:55:12] and when the
[1:55:13] the dead man had it the life came back
[1:55:15] to him
[1:55:17] i've seen pictures of people go to
[1:55:19] abraham's er where he was buried in
[1:55:20] jeffersonville indiana
[1:55:22] they go for tourism believers from
[1:55:24] different countries us they go and want
[1:55:25] to see where
[1:55:26] the prophet of god was buried and i've
[1:55:29] seen pictures where there was
[1:55:30] a dove not a physical death supernatural
[1:55:33] like a fire
[1:55:34] coming from the tomb two of them
[1:55:38] the pill of fire the prophet don't die
[1:55:40] they are still alive christians do not
[1:55:42] die
[1:55:43] amen that's why we are not afraid of
[1:55:45] death death is just as swapping your
[1:55:47] dimension
[1:55:48] swapping your clothes changing your
[1:55:50] athlete tabernacle
[1:55:51] to the to the eternal price and you
[1:55:54] going to the theophonic dimension
[1:55:56] amen it's still here you use it but when
[1:55:58] you leave this flesh
[1:55:59] you have no limitation amen christians
[1:56:02] do not die
[1:56:03] when sister and sister hope but abram's
[1:56:06] first wife died
[1:56:08] and iran was grieving there's only one
[1:56:10] who could console him the lord was
[1:56:11] certain but the lord couldn't console
[1:56:13] him she has to he has to use the spirit
[1:56:15] of uh
[1:56:16] hope to consult with abraham so he said
[1:56:19] go and console your husband
[1:56:21] and she went physically when i was there
[1:56:24] put his son around him
[1:56:25] he said billy don't don't cry no more
[1:56:28] go ahead and preach you don't know you
[1:56:29] preach about heaven but you don't know
[1:56:30] what happened is
[1:56:32] when i went to them at peace i was like
[1:56:34] a made of
[1:56:36] what you call a guest of anna women in
[1:56:39] and white clothes came to meet me birds
[1:56:41] singing trees
[1:56:42] beautiful trees working on blue grasses
[1:56:45] things that you cannot imagine with the
[1:56:46] natural mind here i haven't seen blue
[1:56:49] grasses before i've seen green grasses
[1:56:51] and when they dry they become brown but
[1:56:53] this in the sixth dimension
[1:56:55] there are blue grasses that we working
[1:56:56] upon amen
[1:56:58] and so when she came around to comfort
[1:57:00] the husband
[1:57:01] she left and when she dropped she went
[1:57:03] back to the pill of fire there was a
[1:57:05] rainbow
[1:57:06] so you are not just a human being you
[1:57:08] are a celestial person
[1:57:10] that's why death cannot conquer you amen
[1:57:14] death is not your ultimate even in death
[1:57:17] there is life amen glory hallelujah
[1:57:22] blessed be the name of the lord so god
[1:57:25] even in funeral possession
[1:57:27] can bring life let's look at the son of
[1:57:29] god
[1:57:31] broken son of god the messiah in his
[1:57:33] broken situation
[1:57:34] the whole mankind had eternal life
[1:57:37] matthew 27 37-46 i'm not going to read
[1:57:39] i'll read only one
[1:57:41] one three verses matthew

[1:57:48] 36 to 46. you can't really want to go
[1:57:50] home but let me read 40
[1:57:51] 44-46 the thieves
[1:57:55] also they were talking about when jesus
[1:57:56] was on the cross the thieves also which
[1:57:57] were crucified with him cast the same
[1:57:59] in his teeth now from the sixth hour
[1:58:02] there was darkness over all the land
[1:58:05] until the ninth hour
[1:58:06] 46 and about the ninth hour jesus christ
[1:58:09] with a loud voice saying
[1:58:10] eli eli lammak sabachthani
[1:58:13] that is to say my god my god why hast
[1:58:15] thou forsaken me
[1:58:17] so the spirit separated from the flesh
[1:58:19] the son of god died
[1:58:21] in the flesh broke into pieces and
[1:58:24] through his death
[1:58:25] he was able to live in you and i amen
[1:58:29] even in death the lord can do miracles
[1:58:33] let's look at as samson when he was
[1:58:36] disappointed
[1:58:37] the lord disappointed himself let's see
[1:58:40] what the lord did
[1:58:41] broke his secret brokenness right vow
[1:58:44] let's uh judges 15 14-16
[1:58:48] i'll read only one
[1:58:53] lemme see what some say lord let me die

[1:59:14] or let's read 29 to 31 and
[1:59:17] something took a hold of the two middle
[1:59:18] place upon which the house stood
[1:59:21] and on which it was born up of the one
[1:59:23] which is right and the one which is on
[1:59:25] the left and samson said let me die with
[1:59:27] the philistines
[1:59:28] and he bowed himself with all his might
[1:59:30] and the house fell upon the laws
[1:59:32] and upon all the people that were
[1:59:33] therein so the dead which he slew
[1:59:35] at his death were more than they which
[1:59:37] he slew in his life
[1:59:39] this is the this is th then his brethren
[1:59:42] and the house of his father came down
[1:59:45] and took him and brought him up and
[1:59:46] buried him between
[1:59:47] zorah and esther in the barren place of
[1:59:49] manwa his father
[1:59:51] and the judge israel 20 years now samson
[1:59:54] we know how
[1:59:54] he disappointed the lord he had a vow
[1:59:56] that was not supposed to be known by the
[1:59:58] enemy
[1:59:59] he had seven locks like the way our
[2:00:01] sisters played their hair
[2:00:03] that was a nazarite vow given by that by
[2:00:05] an angel of the lord
[2:00:07] samson gave his flesh to women and they
[2:00:09] will go defeated
[2:00:11] but even at the time that when he was
[2:00:12] most defeated his lowest ebb
[2:00:15] the lord had his cry because samson was
[2:00:18] a spoken word son of god
[2:00:20] he had that says the lord amen so he
[2:00:23] cried he prayed for one prayer i said
[2:00:24] lord
[2:00:25] let me down with avenge me give me a
[2:00:27] revenge
[2:00:28] because they plucked these two eyes and
[2:00:31] it was makings he was making cracking
[2:00:32] jokes
[2:00:33] for the enemy to to to be happy he was
[2:00:36] making spots
[2:00:37] he was entertaining them so something
[2:00:39] said lord just one more time
[2:00:42] and the pillar of fight the enemy didn't
[2:00:43] know that his hair was growing now when
[2:00:45] he was
[2:00:46] in his ministry he had seven locks which
[2:00:48] was a type of the seven church ages
[2:00:50] but the seventeen chinese were shaving
[2:00:52] off
[2:00:53] leaving nothing but the a.d the
[2:00:56] awareness of christ
[2:00:58] he tended to begin to grow on his head
[2:01:00] and they didn't know that his head was
[2:01:01] growing
[2:01:02] there was nobody to plate it but they
[2:01:04] were all grown together as one
[2:01:06] amen it means god is bringing unity upon
[2:01:09] the earth
[2:01:10] we have seven planets we have waters and
[2:01:12] sea
[2:01:13] but that wasn't the original creation
[2:01:15] original creation was the whole world as
[2:01:17] one country or continent or city or
[2:01:19] village whatever you call it
[2:01:21] and the sea and the rivers are around it
[2:01:23] and the lord is bringing it back to
[2:01:24] where it used to be before
[2:01:26] noah amen so when the enemy when the
[2:01:29] uh something prayed the pillar fired
[2:01:31] anointing god on him
[2:01:33] and he let the small boy go far away and
[2:01:35] with all his might
[2:01:37] he build a pillars and he killed more
[2:01:39] even in his in his
[2:01:40] lowest ebb a child of god is omnipotent
[2:01:44] the time when you are crying you are
[2:01:47] sobering you are having fears
[2:01:49] you are at your lowest end you don't
[2:01:51] know where to go
[2:01:53] just yell out a little cry just speak
[2:01:55] from your heart
[2:01:57] just speak your desires to the lord and
[2:01:59] the lord will hear you
[2:02:01] hannah at the lowest ebb when she was
[2:02:03] broken
[2:02:04] when she thought she couldn't have
[2:02:05] children menopause 17 years
[2:02:09] hannah cried lord if you give me a man
[2:02:12] child
[2:02:12] i will dedicate and consecrate him to
[2:02:14] unto the lord the lord heard him give
[2:02:16] him a prophet
[2:02:18] and many other children at your lowest
[2:02:20] condition if you can cry as an
[2:02:22] omnipotent son of god
[2:02:24] regardless of the situation what we do
[2:02:26] is we look at situations we don't look
[2:02:27] at christ in us
[2:02:29] so the situation put us down bury you
[2:02:33] barries you your faith is no longer in
[2:02:35] action you don't have the joy of the
[2:02:37] lord in your heart
[2:02:38] one time it happened to the king david
[2:02:40] he was a joyful person playing music and
[2:02:42] dancing and rejoicing
[2:02:44] but the enemy took his joy out of his
[2:02:46] life and there was no joy and
[2:02:47] david came to realize amnesia is when
[2:02:50] you don't know who you are
[2:02:51] david went into amnesia but the
[2:02:53] sovereign sovereign lord was with him
[2:02:55] he came to himself he said this is not
[2:02:57] who i am it's a lord restore
[2:02:59] the joy of my salvation creating me
[2:03:03] a clean heart oh lord
[2:03:07] a renewal spirit within me

[2:03:18] oh lord and renew every spirit
[2:03:23] within me oh lord cast me not away
[2:03:29] musicians from thy presence
[2:03:33] lord take not thine holy spirit
[2:03:38] from me
[2:03:41] but restore to me
[2:03:45] the joy of my salvation
[2:03:49] and renew every spirit within me
[2:03:55] the lord doesn't cast away amen and the
[2:03:58] lord restored the joy of the
[2:03:59] uh of david unto him
[2:04:02] and the lord made everything new for him
[2:04:05] amen
[2:04:06] so the lord has specialized in
[2:04:08] transforming
[2:04:09] broken situation onto masterpieces
[2:04:12] what is your situation this morning
[2:04:16] what are you crying about where has the
[2:04:19] enemy defeated you or your loved one
[2:04:22] what situation do you think that the
[2:04:23] lord cannot overcome in your life
[2:04:26] whether you are on watching through the
[2:04:28] internet or you are here physically
[2:04:30] the lord knows everything about you and
[2:04:32] the lord is in you
[2:04:34] speak the word why cry even in your
[2:04:37] brokenness
[2:04:38] yes the law sometimes permits to be
[2:04:40] broken so that the supernatural will
[2:04:42] work in you
[2:04:43] when you are not broken when moses
[2:04:45] wasn't broken
[2:04:46] he thought he was a deliverer he was a
[2:04:49] deliverer
[2:04:50] but his delivery was not going to be his
[2:04:51] human might
[2:04:53] he was supposed to stand up to the lord
[2:04:54] for the lord to do it for his glory
[2:04:56] but moses went ahead of himself to use
[2:04:58] his human mind
[2:05:00] he failed willfully but then when he saw
[2:05:03] the pill of fire
[2:05:04] at the back of the desert when he was a
[2:05:06] broken runaway prophet
[2:05:07] that's when the lord began his
[2:05:08] redemption redemptive work at the age of
[2:05:10] 80.
[2:05:11] the lord can use your brokenness to
[2:05:15] form a masterpiece amen shall we pray
[2:05:19] heavenly father we thank you for this
