afar no more to let them they followed a star they entered high places then valleys low on what they traveled just where they didn't know the stars in the heaven declared a great birth God the Redeemer has come down to earth and finding that Holy One consumed them like fire beholding the Savior was their only desire casting aside their own riches and fame they vowed to follow that star with no shame not heeding the words of men a friend or stranger they considered not their lives in danger when at last they found the lad so sweet with joy that Mary hearts did leave unbelief they bowed down worshiped at his feet they're thankful hearts they evidence with gold myrrh and frankincense wise men still come seeking him today the strength and the power a long life's way is when we seek with all our heart that Jesus comes his grace he imparts it's when we kneel before him in prayer he showers us with his loving care may Lord today the gifts that we bring our nnedi Redeemer and our

man I just told let us pick up right where they left off [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] praise the Lord a man certainly appreciate that tonight a man I just get a real good picture of my mind of each one of us presenting our gifts to the Lord Jesus and man just as the wise men did on that night but now I have one more amen I believe his sister Rachel and sister Rebecca gonna come at this time and amen and then after that we'll just just read something from the Word of God amen god bless you publish this is a poem that I wrote three years ago and we did it three years ago and the way the poem came about I was sleep and I woke up saying the words away in a manger in the whole world sits in danger because they pushed me away and kept me in a manger you find they find more pleasure singing about a red nose and of that fictional character with wet clothes that they have no idea of the joy that I came to bring and I was like what did I just say so I just started typing the words out and as more things came to me I just started typing out it came out to a poem and then the more I roll the more it turned into a conversation so sister Rebecca and I did a couple of years ago we decided to do it again we have not really practiced it we haven't really had a lot of opportunity to practice it forgive us if we make mistakes been three years so so um I just want to we just gonna do it it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas the most wonderful time of year to hear those sleigh bells ring art are you listening music the music fills the air the atmosphere scenes of hope because christmas is here the celebration of our saviors birth here on earth with with food and gifts and gifts ah I have to finish shopping hypocrisy and I've got to see about the turkey mutiny seriously what's gotten into you when you should be getting into me I do how oh I forgot you read a chapter or two from your Sunday only books so I can keep somewhat into perspective what the holiday really means it's tradition exactly how do you expect to celebrate me you're born living dying raising King when you forgot what you're celebrating I mean it's not that I'm not listening I've just got so much to do the buying the wrapping traveling food one more purchase that's it I'll be through will that be credit or debit credit what declined like your time with me will be if you keep pushing off your eternity saying you'll pay me later all the praise that I'm due now trying to get as close to your limit with me without going over without the swipe decline away in a manger and the whole world shakes in danger as I sit in my anger because you pushed me away and kept me in a manger you sing silent night yet not so silently you all lake italy and wonder what's so and so cut from me surely I don't take it for granted the day you stretch your arms and died for me I celebrate it every day I thank you religiously as the blood drip drip drip down your side you I bled for you you might hung there my time I'm thankful that with my final breath you see of your eternity in a moment then why don't you show it I do I do this time of year I got it all down to a science it is tradition rehearse for the place remembered all the lines sang all the songs every ding dong ding dong ding dong ding dong of the carol of the bells in the story that that song tells that that well that one doesn't speak of you technically but it's Christmasy so it still counts right I mean I'm not really all like to the mistletoes and here in South Florida Jack Frost is nipping at my nose but I hear it said everywhere I go many times many ways merry Christmas although Xmas is one of the ways but really I promise it's just a paraphrase a way for me to serve me religiously without looking silly to those who don't know my practice Christianity yeah I admit some of those do exist I guess I messed up I guess in the hustle and the bustle of the holiday rush I forgot to mention you to a person or two but they see my long skirts daily they know I serve you I get it you don't get it you think it's about those things but you've forgotten what it really means everyone is rushing around asking Mary did she know but nobody's asking me what it is I came here for peace is in pieces all hell is beginning to break loose and the needs of the Christians are growing weak because no one is speaking to me they're all singing God rest ye merry gentlemen and the only gentleman merry are the ones with the Heineken I know that's not you but it might as well be you find more joy and singing about a red nose and a fat fictional character with red clothes and and you don't have any understanding of the joy to the world that I came to bring I seen about what about you song that sing bring praises to your ears like what Emanuel you sing that one every year it's tradition do you see what I see lights candles Christmas trees programs and activities without regret gluttony that is not how it's supposed to be vanity stivity x' but it's supposed to be about me hello are you listening to me I'm sorry I am but there's just this great sale at JC Penney cheer up I promise I'm hearing everything you say but come on let's not put a damper on the holiday I've got more gifts to buy and more sales to check out but me me guess raise the Lord certainly appreciate a man that and to get it from a dream to go all the way there and that's that's a real blessing puts everything in perspective and then we certainly thank God thank you all musicians I'm just gonna try to share a quick fault with everyone tonight thank you all so much for being so spontaneous a man in coming to service tonight and I pray that the Lord will bless you richly but I tell you what this is what when we as Christians come to Christmas I mean this is what it's all about us bringing our worship amen adoration to our Lord and Savior we thank God for his birth we thank God for his living we thank God for his death but most of all we thank God for his resurrection the Bible tells us that if there be no resurrection that we are without hope so we thank God for that I want to read two scriptures from you before you tonight and we want to just speak on the subject of Christmas grace a man Christmas grease I will read from Matthew 1 verse 21 and 22 and then also a one take a scripture from 2nd Kings chapter 25 if you would stand with me tonight and we'll just read these two scriptures Matthew 1 verse 21 and 22 says and he shall and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet saying let me keep going behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is God with us let's also turn over here to 2nd Kings chapter 25 a man 2nd Kings chapter 25 praise the Lord starting here verse 27 man somewhat ironic that this story is found in the twenty-fifth chapter of 2nd Kings a man and we know that the Lord Jesus was not born on the 25th day of December but yet the world is celebrating it and I find it ironic that God would put a story like this in the 25th chapter of 2nd Kings and it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiakim king of Judah in the 12th month on the seven and twentieth day of the month that evil married a king of Babylon and the year that he began to reign did lift up the head of Jehoiakim king of Judah out of prison and they spake kindly to him and said his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon and changed his prison garments and he did eat bread continually before him all the days of his life and his allowance was a continual allowance given him the king a daily rate for every day all the days of his life in man the Lord at a blessing to reading of his work was just by a brief word of Prayer father we thank you for all that has gone forth tonight Lord and we just pray that you receive it as a sweet sound in your ears we just bring our various gifts and talents and Lord just our even our attention here tonight to focus on you to put things in perspective because you are the reason that we're even here not just for the season you're the reason that we're that we live we breathe and have our being you're the reason Oh God and we thank you for that and as we just enter into the word of the Lord tonight take these scriptures Lord and use them to encourage our hearts and draw us closer to your father's in our prayer in Jesus name we pray a man a man a man you can be seated a man again we just want to take a for our subject tonight Christmas grace Christmas grace just reading a couple statements here from the Prophet I want to read from the message God's wrapped gift a man praise the Lord it says way into East and many hundreds of miles away from there the Magi was already on their Road they'd seen his star was coming to worship god's little gift package that he was sending to the world just a little while from then and the world was going to receive his greatest gift that had ever received a little package wrapped up the little first little Christmas package that was ever wrapped in all the world God wrapped it up I want to break in on my thought and say this the greatest thing was ever wrapped in human flesh was wrapped in it a man God Himself wrapped his own self in a Christmas package and sent it to the world a man Amazon ain't got nothing on this hallelujah hallelujah God Himself wrapped his own so in a Christmas package and sent into the world why did they refuse him why couldn't they see it why did they turn it down why is it that they didn't want it the same reason they don't want it tonight it wasn't handed to them in the custom that they were used to gifts being hand dipped ma they rejected it because it wasn't handed to them and the custom that they were used to gifts being handed that's the reason it's rejected yet tonight is because it's not handed to the people in a custom that they had been used to receiving gifts oh my but God wrapped his own package he's got a right to do it he's the one that's giving it he has a right to wrap it any way he wants to wrap it doesn't make any difference how it is he's got a right to do it because he's the one that's giving the gift and we thank God for the gift that he gave the gift of himself praise God amen amen so now as we just I want to go forward here tonight there's another quote that I want to read it out of surgery would see Jesus this gift that God wrapped they man this gift that god wrapped if a man there there's so many ways that we can take this but one of the gifts that God gave a man to his people when the Lord Jesus was born one of the gifts that he gave was Grace a man one of the one of the gifts that he gave us was Grace and and how grateful we are that we have received that on tonight Amen here in this message sirs we would see Jesus the Prophet says so God did it that way because he said he would he would hide it from the eyes of the wise and prudent and would reveal it to babes such as would learn God is not known by how much education you have Amen God is known by what faith you have see God's not known by science a man neither is he know by any culture glory to God but he's known by faith a man and through grace he projects himself to his belief oh I love that a man it's through grace that he projects himself to the believer it's through an act of grace that God protects himself to the people they man he man we thank God for this Greece he says if we would start to follow him for a little bit then we would know more about what type of person we would look for well we know his birth as we're going to celebrate that soon the Lord willing at Christmastime how he was born in a manger and so forth but then we find out that find out that wasn't just exactly the Christmas story many times if you read the Bible we find out that this Christmas story that I find out this Christmas story have gone to Mary at the manger and a little baby so that's fiction a man so you know brother Branham gives us very clear understanding through Scripture some of the pictures that we might see of the the manger scene would with though the Wiseman there that that's fiction that's not the way things work when we really look at the things that look at things in the Bible he made a made a statement he says when when Jesus was born typically anytime a king is born they always sing to announce the king being born amen it says but I but it came so humble that none of the people knew that a king was being born so God stepped it up a man and not only he didn't have men there to sing at the birth of our Lord and Savior but he had angels come and sing Oh hallelujah amen the king of kings was being born and made flesh amen to die for our sins thank God for that but he was coming and there was a gift that was wrapped there there was a gift of grace that was being given to the people if they could only see it amen grace is free grace is unmerited a man Grace's a man is something that you can never work are good enough but do anything good enough in order to get it from God God just gives it to you because he loves you amen this world was in turmoil this world was in a mess but God sent a package called grace and he wrapped it and he gave it to us and what we need to do tonight it's unwrapped this grace hallelujah amen we need to unwrap it and appreciate it glory to God but here it says a grommet now the definition of grace says it's the free and unmerited favor of God amen as manifested in the salvation of sinners and the bestowal of blessings praise God a man now I want to just take a little time here tonight and I'm gonna read a little bit here and there but did you know I was just reading this scripture and that what we read here out of out of second Kings 25 and you know I've just it just kind of struck me here you know just just some things here certainly grace is being extended to this this individual but I want to let me just before we go too far in that Scripture I want to just bring a quote out of crisis and mystery of God revealed hallelujah glory to God the Prophet makes a statement it says he and that's talking about the Lord Jesus he is the principal theme of the entire Bible a man he's the principal theme of the entire Bible says if you read the Bible and don't see Christ in every verse of it go back and read it again so somehow tonight we got to find Christ in the mix of second Kings 25 a man says go back and read it and see if you can't see Christ and every verse of the Bible then you you read it again because you missed something the Bible is Christ he is the word when you read in the beginning God created there is Christ and from that to the amen and revelations is everywhere testifying of Jesus Christ so that's why of these added blue stick that they call the second book of Daniel and the book of the Maccabees and and an agus purgatory and stuff like that see it's not spoke of in the scripture see it doesn't theme up with the rest of it there's no place to place purgatory in there there is no place to place the intersection or intersection of sinks and things there is no place in there for that there's no place for denomination there's no place for Crees outside of it of the Bible see when you see those things they just don't come into the picture and that's why people it's added those got their jigsaw puzzle all mixed up see they can't make it right same yesterday today and forever you know I was just looking at some recent videos and you know I find it shameful that churches amen are having worship services for a man for Jesus at Christmas time but they bring in Santa Claus into the house of God I find that you know that that that's offensive amen to bring Santa Claus into the house what does he have to do with Jesus hallelujah right you know so so you know here here when we get this when when when we're looking at script we want to find Christ and everything that we look at brother Adam goes on to say the sense but if the thing is put together right there is the entire picture of the fall and briefie regeneration the whole picture of creation and God's whole plan revealed right in Jesus Christ a man that's the whole picture set together every little crook in corner now I don't mean to be sacrilegious by this but it's just like putting a jigsaw puzzle together that's why we got pictures today that looks looks that looks horrible say we are believers in the cow picking grass up in top of the tree hey man it doesn't work that's when they say yeah he's every way but just of a certain know he's the same yesterday today and forever all but a certain thing see then you ruin your picture now he goes on a little further he says the Bible says he's a saint st. John 5 verse 8 in John 14:12 say he he anybody he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also well that was fun another age there you got to picture wrong again you got a man fishing out in the desert a man for a fish and a bunch of hot sand where there is no fish that see you've got to bring them back to where he's fishing amen at Galilee where there's plenty of fish you see you've got to make the picture look right it's God's great picture and there is only one way you'll see it that's when you see Jesus Christ there is the entire Bible he's the principal thing of the Bible hallelujah so we want to go in here and look at this scripture tonight because he's our principal thing as I was looking at this a man this this particular passage and second Kings we have a king by the name of Jahi akin when he was a king of Judah and and what what what struck me is that the scripture made make reference to a couple of things that happen let's go back and read it a man let's go back and read it Oh glory a man let's go back and read it says verse 27 and it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jahi ik and king of Judah in the 12th month on the seven and twentieth day of the month that evil Mara that king of Babylon did lift up the head of Jehoiakim king of Judah out of prison and he spake kindly to him and said is throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon and changed his prison garments and he did eat bread continually before him all the days of his life and his allowance was a continual hours giving him the King giving him other King a daily rate for every day all the days of his life now this and being a king of Judah you know went into into captivity there in Babylon but there come a time in his captivity where he was lifted up pretty much what means that he was free from amen the state of being in prison he he came out of prison somehow hallelujah Amen when and when I look at this man I say that he was undeserving of what happened very undeserving because you know when you follow his life amen the scripture said that this man did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord Amen Jahi akin did that which was evil in the sight Lord and if I could just be honest tonight we all have done some things that have been evil in the sight of the Lord Amen we were born and seen shaped in iniquity and we came into this world speaking lies amen this man was undeserving but also we were undeserving of the grace that was given to us through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he didn't have to do it but he did hallelujah amen stuff so when I look at this man a man I didn't see you know before he had his his head lifted up and and before he was released from prison I didn't see in Scripture with its men ever repented of the evil works that he had done oh there there was a lot to be said amen about this man he was uh he was only he was eighteen years old when he was raining he only rained for about three months and he was taken into captivity and he was in captivity for 37 years carried away into captivity for 37 years but you know here in second Kings 25 they made it set on the that the seven and twentieth day but it reads a little different in the Book of Jeremiah so let's read Jeremiah 52 glory to God a man just a little bit different in Jeremiah glory glory glory glory verse 31 and Jeremiah Christmas grace Jeremiah 52 it says in a king the past in the seven and thirtieth year of captivity of Jehoiakim king of Judah in the twelfth month in the five and twentieth day so I'm Christmas he would have been delivered on in the five and twentieth day hallelujah and see this is why I call it Christmas grace because this man did nothing to deserve this this I can't even remember finding a script tonight is possible that the man repented but it just wasn't recorded in Scripture that he repented and received this grace hallelujah you know I just you know grace is something that's given to us even when we don't deserve it hallelujah that's that's what I see here amen grace is something given to us even when we don't deserve it listen look at look at look at this he says in the fireman 20th day of the month that evil married a king of Babylon in the first year it's reign lifted up the head of Jahi akin king of Judah and brought him forth out of prison and speak kindly unto him and said his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon and changed his prison garments and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life and for his diet there was a continual diet giving him of the king of Babylon everyday apportioning to the day of his death all the days of his life this happened on the 25th day of the 12th month this man received Christmas grease let me go on a little further here because when I look at all of these things that that that Judge Ohia can receive there was five actions a man that were given him first was he had his head lifted up he had his head lifted up and when were talking about having your head lifted up this compares to what happened to Joseph down in Pharaoh's prison a man fair I mean Joseph might have thought he was forgotten about Joseph might have thought that a man he would never come maybe Joseph thought that the dreams that God gave him would never come to pass but there came a day that God amen aloud plus a couple dreams to strike the land and if Pharaoh had nobody could interpret him and God God allowed Joseph to be remembered at the right time and when he get when he got remembered he got brought into pharaoh's court and when Pharaoh a man thought that there was nobody else able to interpret the dreams and give him counsel away Joseph gave him counsel Joseph had his head lifted up and he didn't go back to prison hallelujah I pray tonight that somebody will come out of the prison cells that the devil might have them bounded there have their head lifted up and they receive some grace on Christmas hallelujah amen the other thing that happened is that the man speak kindly unto him this new king a man evil Marivic he spake kindly unto him and when I when I just Briton you know we reflected I said well how did the Lord Jesus speak kindly unto somebody I thought of the woman that was caught in the act of adultery hallelujah when they brought this woman to the Lord Jesus and they became the accuser of all the things that she had done Jesus just began to write in the sand and and he acted as if he was ignoring every accusation I thank God for grace like that a grace that would ignore every accusation everything that the devil can pinpoint are on you anything the devil can accuse you of Jesus ignores bless it be the name of the Lord for grace like that Jesus ignored everything that hurt uses brought to his attention and then he spoke kindly to it after he told he accused us he that's without sin let him cast the first stone when all of them dropped their rocks and begin to walk away Jesus spoke kindly to say woman where are your accusers if she looked around because I can I can see her maybe balled up ready to get hit by a rock but she looked around saying Lord I have none I have none he says neither do I accuse you he spoke kindly to her oh Jesus the third thing he brought them forth out of prison and we know Joseph was brought out of prison but I thought of how the Lord Jesus a man enter he sent his angel to the prison one night and got Peter out of the prison hallelujah while Saints were praying and I and I just found this out this week I was so I was so glad to hear this you know we had our last night of Prayer last night for just further for the brothers a man and we had seven brothers show up for the last night of Prayer ain't that beautiful seven is a number of completion and if we're coming to the end of the year with seven brothers to complete the prayer that was perfect then I was telling my wife but I should say you know what when we had sister's prayer last week we had seven sisters hallelujah God know what he doing right amen them sevens means something glory to God but but as the Saints were praying for Peter God amen brought him out of prison hallelujah and I believe as we pray for others God is gonna also bring our loved ones out of prison praise God this is a season for them to be released this is not the season for them to be bound this is the season for them to be released gonna bring our loved ones out of prison I don't care how deep they in gotta bring them out of prison if you have to if we have to blind my eyes of other ones that's keeping in prison gotta do whatever he needs to do to bring them out hallelujah Peter was locked in prison but he was delivered through the prayers of the Saints and that's the same way many are gonna be delivered today through the prints of the Saints the other thing that the scripture says he said is throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon I love that he said his throne above because you know about the the the the Babylonians they had actually taken over so much they took over Egypt and and Israel and just a number of kingdoms so this man had his throne set above those that were in Babylon did not now and we'll read something a little bit later if I can I want to read a quote here for you really quick the scripture I've quoted real quick Revelation 3:21 just took my when I thought about this said is throwing the butter throwing the kings that when Babylon I thought about revelation 3:21 says to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne that's the promise of the Lord Jesus to us as overcome us and here in the legacy in the aged brother Adam says now now what we ought to overcome that is the normal question that asked here but that is not the actual thought of this verse for some it's not so much what we are to overcome but how we are to overcome now this is logical for does it matter much what we ought to overcome as long as we know how we can overcome it says a quick look at those scriptures which involve the Lord Jesus overcoming will bring out the truth of this proposition in Matthew 4 where in Jesus is tempted of the devil he overcame the personal temptations of Satan by the word and by the word only in each of the three major trials that comprehend that correspondent exactly to the temptation of the Garden of Eden the lust of the flesh the lust that I have a proud of life Jesus overcame by the word he failed to the personal temptation of Satan by falling by failing to use the word Adam fell in direct disobedience to the word but Jesus overcame by the word and right now let me say this this I say that this is the only way to be an overcomer also it is the only way that you can know if you're overcoming because the word can't fail so if you want to be an overcoming this out you can't overcome with the word it's gonna take it natural fillers not your emotions you're gonna need the words hallelujah Amen I'm skipping down at the paragraph 366 Amen they're in the same same page there it says now then there will not be one person who will sit in the throne of the Lord Jesus Christ unless he has been living that word your prayers your fastest your repent assists no matter what you present to God none of that will gain you the privilege of sitting in the throne and it would be granted only to the word bribe as a throne of the King gets shared with the Queen because she is united to him so only they who are of the word even as he is of that word will share that throne as Joe Hiatt Kim Amen he was given a throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon we as a bribe of the Lord Jesus Christ as overcomers will sit in his throne god is so good the other thing that happened here the fifth thing that happened is that they changed its prison garments and anybody that's ever been in prison knows what it feels like to be able to wear normal clothes don't have the way to Orange and whatever it is that look you have to look and identify yourself as a prisoner but people want their garments changed as soon as they get out they want to change them gums they don't want to be identified with that anymore and I'll tell you what when you come a man out of bondage you come out of bondage you're going two garments change too when people are really free Oh y'all it hurt me yet but when they really get free that garments gonna change I'm gonna say that again when you really get free I'm talk about really free your garments gonna change you're gonna identify yourself with the world no more hey man we're now now we try to get as close as we can to the world but we're but when you when you when you when you went when he changes your prison garments hallelujah you look like the world no more and won't even care that you don't look like them hallelujah hey man Church let me read this say man this is coming from the sardian Church each the Prophet says in revelation 3:5 he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment I would not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and his holy angels he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment says this is actually a repetition of verse 4 where an has made the reference to the few who have not defiled their garments we used to have a saying years ago that no doubt was taken from this verse it said it was keep your skirts clean it meant don't get involved in questionable things as believers this is this is how we keep on starts clean don't get involved in questionable things a man others will be involved you might be tempted to be involved or someone might even try to involve you but stay clear of it all by steering a course away from it now God is going to reward those who follow this advice a man they are going to be clothed and white even as he is clothed in white Peter James and John saw him on Mount transit Transfiguration and it's close where it's white it's like that is how the Saints are going to be clothed their garments will be shining exceedingly white and the only ones get that exceedingly white garment are those that overcome you're gonna have to overcome something a man you know fashion is something that people have to overcome a man fashion is something that people have to overcome glory to God it's very easy to look like the world and act like the world but as believers we got to overcome that amen that's not our example hallelujah some some some some model on Instagram is not our example praise God the scriptures are example a man glory to God so I just believe somebody gonna have big the prison garments changed we notice here in second Kings 25 has stated that the release of jaya can occurred on the twenty seven twenty seventh day of the 12th month but in Jeremiah is stated that he was lifted up on the 25th day of the 12th month now I hate to be the one to bring it out but that is somewhat of a discrepancy and we have many people that are turning away from the message today because they find these little things and they feel like they can't trust it anymore and and I and I hate to say if we apply that same principle to Scripture somebody's faith might be shut by the two scriptures I read tonight but I want to a man just take you back a little bit theologian state that is possible that the or that the order for him to be released actually occurred on the 25th but the actual release may occurred on the 27th now they say that that's that's possible that's just something that they concluded and I what I like to call speculation as no one really knows why those dates are different but they speculated this so since the theologians can speculate I figured I could as well and man and I believe the dates are different because God does not want us to approach him through knowledge but God wants to accept everything that wants us to accept everything by faith hallelujah what does it matter about the date the fact of the matter is that his hat was lifted up the fact of the matter is that he was set on the throne above the other Kings the fact of the matter is is that his prison karma sinks the fact of the matter is that he received unmerited I'm being served grace that's the facts halu so don't get caught up in a little itty-bitty things that don't mean anything that's just a devil trying to a make it you focus on something so small hallelujah amen but look at the facts the fact is the man was deliver and did not deserve it hallelujah that's that's that that man takes me I was delivered and didn't I deserve it I was set free and did not deserve it somebody else took my place on the cross I deserve to be there but he took my place that's what I want to keep my eye on look at this statement made here from Matthew Henry just in his commentary Jahi can fell from a thrown into a prison think about that he was a man that fell from a throne into a prison but here and his advant in this scripture he's advanced to a throne of state now when it says that he was raised to the throne and his throne set higher than the other kings it was a throne of state not a throne of power right because the king of Babylon Eve Ameritech was the one of the throne of power but he was wrong a race to us a throne of state says as before the robes were changed to prison garments so now they were converted back to rose again glory though the night of affliction be very long he was Devon years though the night of affliction be very long yet we must not despair I don't know how long you've been waiting on God to do something for you I want to tell you tonight don't despair the day may dawn at last July a chemist 37 years of prisoner in confinement and contempt since he was 18 years old let those whose afflictions have been lifted lifted out be encouraged a man encouraged themselves with this instance with this scripture the vision will add the end speak comfortably and therefore wait for it Alleluia God can make his people find favor in the eyes of their oppressors like that God can make his people find favor in the eyes of their oppressors and turn their hearts to to pity them God know how to change things and turn things around and this man that again I never saw and script to where he actually repented of his deeds I never saw that I mean Jeremiah prophesied against him and and one of the other things that happened in the Book of Jeremiah this man when he went to when he went into captivity there was a man by the name of Hananiah that rose up and prophesied that in two years the hyenas coming back and jeremiah said amen when the church said amen and after church it got Hananiah to decided say thus saith the lord because you lied in your prophecy and you and you gave them a false prophecy you won't live another year and he died within a year but Jahi can Amen he went on into he never came back after two years but in 37 years his hand was lifted up now he didn't come back to Jerusalem but where he where he was he was no longer eating prison food he was eating the King's food he was no longer sitting in the prison cell he was sitting at the Kings table and this is a man that I don't see in Scripture ever repented that's why I called it Christmas grace and if the Hika can't treat it like that what do you think you'll do for us his bride that's been washed in blood Oh church glory to God I certainly thank God for this grease a man a man a man let's just look at two other little statements here from the Prophet why little Bethlehem and then the last that I'll read would be sirs we would see Jesus he says poor people Joseph and Mary both real poor you hear they was in this little stable how humble God makes itself then we try to make ourselves something great can't you see how God humbles himself and takes the things that's not that he might bring to pass his great promises how that little Jehovah laying in a manger wrapped and the cloth taken off of the back of a yoke the neck of a yoke where ox had been and wrapped the Prince of Peace in it my who are we then what do we deserve if God can humble himself like that oughtn't we to be able to humble ourselves to become his servant if he did things like that can't we forget our great dignities and things of this of this world and pass from that and humble ourselves before him this Christmas show him our appreciation of the of that birth and that humility by humbling our own selves and receiving his word no matter what the tradition says it's his word that counts that's what he'll take his word and that only and I just challenges a man just to reflect on how ho my Lord and Savior came and my you know you just imagined brother Branham said they were poor Mary and Joseph both poor God that owns the entire world a god that Amen that made it all and what he chooses do is come to a poor father a poor mother rather can barely take care of whatever they got but come to these poor people say I'm gonna be born here got some people that couldn't I mean they they they they were looking for and couldn't get any room in the end but decided we'll go to a stable and then in a manger and then we'll have hay and we'll have all of this and then this is the way I'm gonna choose to be born the King of Kings the Lord of lords come with such humility church is time for us to kind of start reflecting in this Lord if you would that humble when you came don't let us I mean can you imagine even Mary if I could just ask some y'all sisters put yourself in Mary's place if you were carrying Christ how would you act if you would have one chosen like Mary was chosen how would you act would you be round telling everybody guess what I'm carrying Jehovah when we think about this thing's church it puts things back into perspective our God was so humble so humble and like brother Branham say he gave us a wrap package that many people just refuse to unwrap but what we need to do is go back and look at it grace was given to us when Jesus came don't reject that grace sir as we would see Jesus the Prophet says God bless you just scroll down a little bit there says God bless you not exactly a Merry Christmas but God's blessings of Christmas be upon you may the Christ of Calvary hide you in himself and blanket you and so wrap you and enshrouds you in his word till his word will be made flesh in you is my prayer I want to pray amen at this moment for us we thank God for His grace Lord Jesus just a little thought to share with the Saints tonight as we've come out to worship you well we look back in Scripture and see this manager hyah cannon king of Judah Lord who it walked away from you the entire nation of Israel or were God turning from you at that time and God it reminds me of many of us today Lord that are not doing the things that you're asking us to do we've turned from you we've forgotten about you God the Lord if we just take a few moments just to get you back and view again just to see Lord how precious how special it was that day that you came and believed someone said there's been thousands of boys Lord who have lived on this earth and become kings but there was only one king who came and became a boy that he might identify with mankind to be able to redeem them God how grateful that you would humble yourself to be born the way that you were born to live the way that you live to die the way that you died sometimes we think Lord we think a little bit too much of ourselves we thank you for your blessings but God help us always to remain humble in your presence we wouldn't have none of these things if it had not been for you God we'd have nothing if it had not been for you Jesus so lord help us to always keep you in first place we thank you Lord for this this group of Saints Lord that were pressed away out here tonight and Lord just just a worship and I pray that you would give each one a very special blessed see God as your prophet said not necessarily wishing everybody a Merry Christmas but the blessings of Christmas would be upon each and every one and may the Christ of Calvary hide himself in all of our hearts that you might express yourself to the world again let us be the stars that would bring others to a living Christ in Jesus name we pray amen amen praise the lord praise the lord come all ye faithful joyful and triumphant o come o come
