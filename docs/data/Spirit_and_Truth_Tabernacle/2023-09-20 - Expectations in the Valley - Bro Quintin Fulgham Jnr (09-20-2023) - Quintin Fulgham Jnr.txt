uh brother Troy our precious brother about uh just coming to church um a lot of times you know um we think church is a is just a place of enjoyment and excitement which is definitely true um but I was I came across a quote when I was kind of dealing with stuff and uh and the prophet that said you know you know David said it was a joy to come into the house of the Lord whether things were good whether things were bad indifference in the church and all that and he said it was a joy to come into the presence of the Lord and it just struck My Soul at that point where I was like I'm not coming to church just to be excited you know we're coming to church to hear from God we're coming to church the communion with God you know a lot of times you know we uh hear the stories of people that got healed uh during the time when the prophet was on Earth not knowing they may have to they may have had to wait it uh lots of services and order for that healing to come through right so and they still pressed on right just to hear the word of God and I believe God sees that and honors it and it's and it's it's something that touches him to kind of you know see us when we're struggling and still trust in him right I believe it brings joy to his heart because it's out of our own choice that we uh we still serve and love him all right so um we're gonna say a prayer and then we're gonna get right into the reading okay Heavenly Father Lord God we come before you Lord bow down O Lord another Wednesday service O Lord God a sacrifice Before You O Lord God Lord in ourselves O Lord God we may be weak O Lord God and worn out from from the battles of the Lord God as the as the days come on O Lord the age we see just gets worse and worse and it can be hard to combat the spirits in this time O Lord God and Lord we know Lord God that it's that all things work for good O Lord God and that you have to plan for us oh Lord God and you allow us to go through these bad times or tough times that we may call valleys oh Lord Jesus Christ but Lord It's a purpose oh Lord God behind it it's a purpose behind everything we deal with every struggle that we have oh Lord every every Temptation that comes across the soul lord God every mistake we make O Lord God we may fall sometimes oh Lord the prophet says we sin all we we sin all all the time all day we don't mean to do it oh Lord God but we're weak O Lord God but you allow these things things that happen O Lord Jesus Christ O Lord to show O Lord God that you're the perfect one O Lord God and and that you're looking O Lord God to help strengthen us oh Lord God oh Lord we thank You O Lord Jesus Christ the lord for it's that seed of life that you place in us before the foundation of the world oh Lord Jesus Christ no matter how much we struggle O Lord Jesus Christ what we go through we realize that that seed O Lord God is a direct Part of You O Lord God so whenever we're going through our problems and our trials oh Lord God and we feel shaken or we feel upset little God we know that it's already touched You O Lord God and you don't like to be shaken our Lord God you don't like to be upset oh Lord God you don't like when things are not going smoothly your lord God so you have to respond to it oh Lord God and that's because we were before you we were in you before the foundation of the war of the Lord God Lord help get ourselves out the way of the Lord God that you may give a word O Lord to us O Lord God that may help us overcome O Lord God oh oh Lord God we know that in the overcoming O Lord God there's a blessing on the other side oh Lord God we ask that you touch everything O Lord God touch all the sound tech O Lord God all the people that may be listening in oh Lord God we ask oh Lord God that you would prepare the hearts O Lord to receive the seed of Victory O Lord Jesus Christ and the water with praise O Lord God and we ask it in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen so I'll get started right into the message uh God bless you all um this message is a um God kind of I'm kind of one of the preachers where I kind of preach about what I'm going through uh the prophet actually said that he said you know uh you kind of uh the best I guess some of the best message that you can have is things that you've already experienced and that when you hold on to the word of God and get the victory well then you can give it to somebody else and it really means something when you're preaching about it so the title of this message is uh expectations uh in the valley uh so um and it's actually a little series on expectations I want to do so this first one is uh in the valley uh so we're going to go to um we're going to turn to our Bibles to Psalm 23 and we're actually going to read verses uh one through four to get a foundation uh on the topic so just wait a little bit I can start reading why she pulls it up as everyone else got there though yeah all right so it says here the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me alive down in Green Pastures he leads me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in Paths of righteousness for his name's sake yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me and yeah I mean you may take your seats all right um and I love this Bible verse because uh we see in these verses especially in all in verse two David says he maketh me lie down in Green Pastures and he leads Me In the Still Waters and then when we fast forward in the verse it sees that he's walking through the the Valley of the shadow of death and one of the key things about this is that God is with him in those Green Pastures and in those times in the valley where there is uh Evil all about him all right so that actually gives a a um and places emphasis to the believer that we're trusting God in the ups and downs and that we're not just trusting on our own selves to get ourselves out of positional out of a situation or put ourselves into good situations right um and so in the topic of in the valley um valleys are very very interesting places right um and these are places where our faith muscles Flex the most right A lot of times we feel like we're uh we have a lot of good faith when things are going good but that's not or your your faith is being flexed and being tested right it's in The Valleys when your face muscles get flexed and tested when you when you're not even uh you're not even aware of it right so this is the place where you really get to see the uh the uh the uh see the power of God being manifested in your life in a different kind of way right and so the valley is a collection of experiences that are necessary uh for the Christian walk right so the tests and trials that we face it shapes our character um I remember I was um went to the men's meeting last year and this brother uh came up and he was teaching and he said that sometimes when you get sick God just don't heal you right then and there he says he's trying to build some character out of you right so you go through those sick times and I remember I had I had gotten sick on a trip while I had a cruise and I went to Mexico and I came back and I got a stomach bug and it was I've never expect experienced anything like that before and I was on my bathroom floor just hurting right just hurting just calling on God now I know God could have delivered me within a second and that's what makes it even more challenging because we know that God has the power to do things like that but it's trusting him even when he hasn't answered us or responded to us and God's looking to see how are you going to act in that situation right so God is actually looking at you right what why you're why you're expecting your healing while you're expecting your deliverance God's looking to see how are you going to act when I don't say anything so I remember during that time all I could do was just praise God I could just bless his name and it has to come from a place that's not your own flesh it has to come from a place where God has placed something inside of you that regardless of what I'm going through I'm going to praise God I'm going to worship God I don't care how I feel I'm going to trust in him right and then when I got out of that situation and I got better there was such a joy that was such a joy there there was such an accomplishment I felt like man I really trust State God through this no matter what I went through I didn't blame them I didn't get upset because he didn't uh touch me right then and there and he saw me going through but even even though I was going through all that stuff I still had a praise on the inside inside of my soul and I could thank God and so when I got over it it felt like there was if it felt like I accomplished something and I kind of I kind of like to type that to like uh kids getting presents like sometimes you know a killer asked they're paying for something for Christmas time and sometimes they'll put her on the list because back in the day we used to um write all what we want for our uh what the presence that we want for our parents and we give them the list and you're expecting to get those things back and sometimes your parents will actually get the thing that you want the most they'll actually hide it right they'll put it behind the other tree they'll put it behind the tree and they'll put all the other stuff in the front and when you go through and open that stuff and you see that you didn't get the thing that you want most they seen how you want to react and a lot of times some kids get upset that you'll see it in their face crying and wailing and stuff because they didn't get what they want and then the parent still gave it to them but then you have the kids that you know they're appreciative they see all the gifts and they get all the they open up all the gifts they see that they didn't get what they wanted and they still thankful and then God gives it to them so and I love that situation because God is a good father and he still gives gifts no matter how you no matter how you respond to it but we want to be like the ones that are like Lord Lord whether whether it's going good whether I got what I want or not or not I still want to thank you I still want to I still want to bust you because there's there's a greater satisfaction that comes with that and that's the satisfaction I felt when I got healed when he didn't heal me when I was struggling there my stomach was hurting eating humor right there in a second but I still praise him and when I got over it there was a great satisfaction but I trusted God through it all right so it's in those Valley experiences that God that are our faith muscles really get stretched right and God is looking to see how we are going to respond right so and whenever you leave the valley there's always a promotion on the other end right right there's always a promotion on the other end right and this is the difficult part in life when you're going through vials when you're struggling with stuff uh sickness in your body and family situations or uh job situations uh relationships relationships with parents to the parents to the kids the kids to the parents right it's it's it's it's it's it's there can be such a difficulty and it's not easy to get around it right and and that's the problem with man because man we love the easy way out of stuff man loves to take the easy way out uh in order to get a victory right and that's why we struggle during these times because we're expecting the easy Victory we're expecting to go through something without having to have a struggle in order to get our blessing on the other side right so we're going to pull up um I have a quote here from the uh from the prophet um getting to the Spirit uh it's going to be paragraph 28 so we're going to read what the prophet has say about it so he called them Hilltop experiences but Hilltop Mountain Top experiences they're the same thing um so we're going to read read and read what the prophet had to say about this oh I think that may be the wrong year uh wait is that the wrong year 28 yeah I'll go ahead and just read it yep so he says here you know everybody wants a Hilltop experience and they never want to take the valley everybody in the Pentecostal Church too every night if you're not shouting dancing jumping up and down speaking in tongues and running all over the floor or another you don't have any kind of meaning well you know it's all right to be on the Mountaintop that's good but let me tell you your fruits will freeze up there at the night and when the cold spell comes you'll lose all your fruit that's what happens now we put too much on mountaintop experiences of dancing and shaking and jumping around instead of instead of all night prayer meetings see the thing with all night prayer meetings you don't feel like doing it right it's something you don't feel like doing it's something that is not exciting it's something that is not you know when you're when you're in church and you're praising God you're Clapping Your Hands and tapping your feet Everything feels good right but these all night prayer meetings don't feel good because you want to sleep right you want to sleep you may not know what to say but these things as the prophet says instead of all night uh prayer meetings down in the valley of decision these are where your your faith takes root into something so that regardless of how you're feeling regardless of what you're going through you stood on a decision and you're gonna need that when the enemy tries to come to take away uh your blessings right so he continues to say well you have to come down there and meet God and really pour out your life until something takes place he said we have let the we've grown fruits up here right which is good to have the fruits but the freeze kills them those fruits are represent uh the seeds of blessings that God puts inside of your life right he doesn't want you to lose them right because a lot of times you know you have that's why a lot of times parents they don't just give their kids anything and you know and as parents you know when you when you're when your parents when you're uh when your uh your mom or dad tells you to brush your teeth every day it tells you to make up your bed tells you to take out the trash the building up character it's a value to you because you don't feel like doing it but they see in the future that you're going to have a home you're going to have a family you're going to have a wife you may God May bless you oh financially you may have a mansion right and he's giving you the skills necessary in order to keep that thing right he's giving you the skills in order to keep that thing right so he says that's right every time it comes a little cool spell you've got nothing to rest upon when the emotion uh dies down then all the shouts gone and it will go emotions will go emotions come and go and you can't control them in later will figure out where why is that so right the noise ceases and then where you're at the Temptation comes along and then you can't take it right then you can't take it so I like how the prophet uh kind of describes us these Hilltop and Mountaintop experiences and how he puts uh he says that it's good to go through the Mountaintop experiences but he puts an emphasis on those Valley experiences the the routes that we don't want to go right and so and as we could kind of type it uh because it's the spiritual types the natural and we could we could type it physically to a New Year's resolution you know every single year the New Year comes along and people make resolutions or they make words of what they want to accomplish in the year you know some people want to better finances some people want to work out for Better Health some people want to be better in school and all that kind of stuff and so let's say we have a person a and and this person wants to be wants to work out and uh be healthier right make healthy choices right and so now this person is uh Gone on social media hey it's a new year I'm ready to start working out and everything's good and it feels so there's so much excitement and stuff inside of that and and they'll go to the sports store and buy the most expensive clothes they'll go online and order the uh um uh exercise equipment and all that they'll spend all kinds of money right on these things because there's an excitement and they want to do that and then they go out there and let's say they take one lap and they get tired and they say well okay let me stop let me if this is a little tough right it's a little tough let me look let me maybe just kind of ease through that and that's the way man is when a man wants to put themselves through their own Valley experience it's always easy and manageable it's always easy and manageable but the point is nothing gets done afterwards because they end up buying that exercise equipment and all of a sudden it's just sitting in the garage all right they end up buying all this all those expensive workout clothes and don't never touch them again right and it's because they haven't based their choice off of a a a valley a valley decision that I'm going to work out regardless of how I feel regardless if I feel tired regardless if I if if it hurts I'm going to go out and work out it's based off of an emotion right it's based off it's based off of the feeling and that feeling will go away right that feeling will go away right but give that person a seasoned trainer somebody that's trained people and seen them go through all of that somebody that's seen people go through their ups and downs somebody that has seen someone uh try to give up but uh but push them but but was able to motivate them and push them through right then that person now has some encouragement that person now has someone that will hold them accountable outside of themselves right and that's what the holy spirit is for us because we can't do it ourselves we can't worship God ourselves that's why when Peter Well Peter and and his heart and his heart uh when uh Jesus Jesus Christ has said Peter you're going to deny me Peter in this heart said no I'm not I'm not going to deny you I love you too much you're my best friend and it was good intentions but when the trial came and it came to a point where Peter could take a stand for Christ he denied him because there wasn't nothing on the inside right that could help him to stand through the time that no matter what everyone else was talking about because he heard what people were saying right no matter he was going through there was nothing on the inside to Anchor him down and say no no no I'll stand for Christ right and so that's why we need something we need a trainer we need someone that has gone through which is why God doesn't give us any excuses because he seen Daniel in the Lion's Den afraid and and still trusting him right and was able to come and close the uh the mouth of Alliance he seen those three Hebrew children right regardless of what of what the uh the nation has said they weren't going to bow down and that's why God doesn't give us an excuse now because he's already seen his children succeed and he knows that we can do the same exact thing right he knows we can do the same exact thing he has confidence that we can do the same exact thing so he's not going to let us have an easy way out when we need to uh in order to uh get our blessing and I would like to kind of also type it because um I used to play football and um one of the big things about playing football was wearing the jersey that used to be a real real big thing where you would like to wear the Jersey on on game day well um you'll walk around the school so everyone can see the colors that you're wearing it was it was it was a team Pride that was in that but before the season started there was something called pre-season conditioning and that was during the summer time and now is the time when coach was whipping to get you in shape for the season and before you got the jersey and now he'd have you out there just we'd be running in the hot sun and be I mean I've never I've never drank water so fast uh because of what they put us through right and that's a time where if you ain't never seen Roman cry go to a preseason a football preseason for the middle schoolers or high schoolers I'm telling you know you you see them big boys out there just coaching I can't run no more coach I'm tired coach I'm tired and Coach is like nope give me one more lap nope give me one more lap right and because he sees something inside of him and he's trying to push him he's trying to push him into Valley because because uh no one's forcing him to go out there and every single morning with his body more in the bed and my body was sore on the bed we had to make the conscious decision you know what I'm going to come out here and do it again right coaches are forcing you so I had it was in this time of a valley had to we had a decision that uh came up inside of our hearts that we were going uh uh to keep going on because we trusted in what the coach said and that he was going to make us better and then after the season was over after all the complaining and thinking about giving up when a coach gave us our Jersey we can now wear that jersey with pride knowing that we'd gone through right we've gone through and uh we've gone through we trusted the coach we've gone through the valley and now we we're in a condition we're in this we're in a spot where now the coach can use us right now we can get on the field and Coach can use it he can say all right I want you to run this route all right I want you I want you to block I want you to do this and we can see the success in our team right because we've gone through the valley right when we when we hoist up the trophy a lot of people says man you guys are good but what they don't see is that it started in the valley yeah right it started in the valley it didn't just happen they didn't see what we wanted to give up they didn't see when we had an attitude with our coach because of what he was saying but we where we died out to ourselves and said no I'm going to listen to the coach even though I don't feel like it people don't see that they just see the success but the victory started in the valley right so the valley the valley wasn't made for a time of enjoyment right but it was made for a time to prepare you to experience enjoyment once you've gone through it right so Valley is um and I and I like to say this at a valley isn't a time for you to say that uh your uh a time for happiness or excitement and I said this before I don't believe Christians are happy all the time I believe we have joy right I believe we do have joy but we're not happy all the time right see the world expects and that's and that word expect which is in the title of the message and I want to tie these two things together is your ex your expectations can hurt you will harm you see the world expects to be happy all the time right they expect to have happiness and in order to have happiness you have to have something happening you got to have something happening right which is why they engage in stuff they'll drink and after drinking they'll go partying and then when they finish partying they'll go home and they'll binge watch Netflix and then uh the next day they'll go to a sporting event right they're always trying to preoccupy themselves with stuff to keep themselves happy all the time right and that's the carnal mind that's the carnal way but you see when you're in a walk with God sometimes you put you on a path where you won't be happy he put you on the path where you won't feel good you won't feel good at all right and he's trying to bring something out she's trying to bring something out of you right so the carnal mind rejects that but the Christian trusts God that hey even though I'm not happy I don't feel good something's going to come out of this thing right and regardless of it I'm just happy that Lord you're with me I'm happy that you're just speaking with me praise God so expectations they tie hand in hand with faith because it's a strong belief already definition and expectations are a strong belief of something and expectations are a driving force that mankind mankind uses to achieve certain purposes and things right so because man expects food to be ready in instance we created the microwave right we control physics and the laws of fixes to create a microwave so that we could be able to get food right now when we wanted it right a man expects to get to a destination as fast as they can right so we uh we we try to control the situation and environment and the physics and we created cars and trains and airplanes in order for us to get to a destination because we expect to get there uh as fast as possible so expectations are not wrong they're they're naturally a part of us right that God put them inside of us we come into the world expecting things right and just to kind of uh uh kind of show this example um I like to talk about my little sister Zoe back there uh because we um we took the youth on a little trip to the uh Zoo uh the Palm Beach Zoo and we went into this little store where you have all like the little gifts and stuff like that and man you just saw you could tell as soon as though we saw everybody else buying stuff and all the other youth getting treats and all those things and things like that all of a sudden now she's expecting something and she don't know what the word expectation means and I remember that she started crying because she was expecting to receive something too right and so I think uh since adoption got her a lollipop or something and then she stopped crying because her expectations was met right and that's and that's how God and and that's how God likened us because because the prophet said you have to expect from God and we're God's children and when we need something from God we cry right we cry so when you're reading your Bible and you're seeing God bless these people and bless these people and heal these people who are going to different meetings and you're seeing God healed this one you're saying God bless this one and delivered this one you can cry to God and say what about me I'm your child too and God will respond right so it's an ex-patient expectation that God has placed in us but on the same token uh back to Zoe again um you know she's a uh uh I I I love her attitude about things and stuff so uh on the other end of it was always good mood right after service and she's laughing and she's running around and wanting you to chase her and all those things right she's expecting you to play with her right she has an expectation right now that she wants to be out she wants to be out running around doing whatever she wants to do but as soon as daddy picks her up and puts her in a car seat all of a sudden her her her facial face changes all right her face changes because she's expecting to play but you know Daddy's expecting to go so now you have conflicting expectations right you have conflicting expectations and that's where we have to be careful as children of God right because sometimes uh dad god daddy he wants to go somewhere else and we may want to sit around and have fun and all those things and God wants to put us through a valley and all of a sudden now we're having conflicting expectations we have to then yield ourselves to what God wants right and so um Zoe eventually she'll after all crying and stuff like that she'll be okay and it's the same way with us God will let us just sit up there and cry and pouting all that stuff he says I know you're going to go through right so um it's natural for us to have these expectations it's natural for us to expect things in a situations because we all want stuff to be good it's it's the gene that God made us when in the beginning In The Garden of Adam he didn't have any problems right he didn't have any struggles or nothing like that when God cursed the ground and told Adam you're going to sweat Adam didn't know what sweating was I can imagine him like when God came and said yep Adam you're going to sweat and and Adam in his mind's like what is sweat what does that mean right because he never had to struggle for nothing he never had to struggle right so and he expected that every single time he walked in the garden everything was going to be good so it's okay as human beings for us to expect things to go good but now that we're in this uh phase of time God uses valleys to mold character in us in our current state right so I'm going to read this article that I found online uh so Pastor said that if um if it helps the human race you can use it so I'm taking the page from this book so we have this uh this uh believer uh he may I don't know if he's a message believer or not but um he has this blog and we're going to read some of this blog that he wrote and he says your Mountaintop experience or the valley what grows you the most right and so we're going to read some articles out here about talking about the Mountaintop and the in the valley it says both the Mountaintop experience and the valley are important for your spiritual growth the Mountaintop experience is one with extreme felt presence of God I feel God I know God is with me Everything feels good right the valley is the place where our faith is tested with trials and tribulations because of its purpose in our lives right so the Mountaintop experience is something Christians seek after that's what we want that's naturally what we want we don't want to go into a valley right that's the prophet that said when it happens they become excited and zealous for God it is on the Mountaintop we receive revelation God gives us Revelation right God gives us a word before we have to go through the trials and we can see that type of Moses when Moses was on the Mountaintop God said your deliverer God said you're going to go deliver and he ain't faced nothing yet right so he was on the Mountaintop where he received Revelation right and it is where we experience the tangible felt presence of God uh uh uh Moses felt God when when Moses went up to the burning bush to uh to question what it was uh God told him to take his shoes off for you you're standing on Holy Ground so he felt the presence of God he felt the fear of God he felt God near him right but then in the valley when he was standing before the sea that presence wasn't there anymore right that presence wasn't there anymore and then he started to cry and God had to remind them why Christ speak right so this off this often The Mountaintop this often propels us into a greater service for the kingdom and he made a comedy comment he said have you have you ever had the devil create doubt about you about you having an extremely intimate and Powerful experience with God's presence during your Mountaintop experience he starts whispering in you that it's just a fake experience you're just working it up with your emotions right now you're starting to descend into the valley right because now you're starting to question things right so it's so as as a um with these mountaintops and these Valley experiences one of the things that we have to expect uh in this life of having ups and downs is that we can't control our Hilltop experiences and we can't control our Valley experiences we can't control it we can't control when they happen and we can't control how long they last even though that's that's that's automatically uh the default thoughts that we have in our head is okay now I want to be successful or or or now I I and I want to be successful and I want it to last for this long right because if we have the choice and God would go through his economy our mountaintops would outweigh the valleys but we need the valleys most right so we can't control our experiences and we have to expect that first right and we're going to prove it by the scriptures right and we're also going to show how Valley experiences and Hilltop experiences Are Spiritual first and we love that they're spiritual first because it shows that God is leading and God is in control that should give us confidence right that should give us confidence so we're going to turn to job one and we're going to read verses one through five please right so it says there was a man in the land of us whose name was job and that man was perfect and upright and one that feared God in a shoot evil and they were born into him seven sons and three daughters his substance also was seven thousand sheep and three thousand camels and 500 yoke of oxen and 500 she asks in a very great household so job is at a time right now where he is just blessed I mean seven thousand sheep maybe could equate to 20 Porsches and uh 3 000 camels uh five houses or whatever but job is at a point where he's uh experiencing the Mountaintop right it says a very great household and it says so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the East right and this is the Bible confessing that and it says here his sons went that went and feasted in their houses everyone his day and sent and called for their sisters to eat and and to drink with them and if so was in the day they're fishing they were gone about the job sitting Sanctified and Rosa Brothers morning offered burnt offerings according to the number of of them all for job said it may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts thus the job did just thus dear Joel continuing so job is at a time where he's on a Mountaintop where not only is he being blessed but he's caring about this the the the the the the the spiritual life of his kids right he's he cares about the spiritual life his kids he's making sacrifices him he's only he's on a Mountaintop right now and everything is going good everything is is feeling good you know it's uh uh um church is good right he's having a great time in church he's a righteous man that went to church right so we want to show we're going to go down here to verse um we're going to go down here to verse 8. we're going to show how this experience this Mountaintop experience that job is going through uh it wasn't of his own doing right so in verse 8 Job chapter 1 verse say the reason the Lord said to Satan has thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and upright man one that fear of God and issue of evil the Satan answer the Lord and said do if job fear God from not so so Satan tried to throw a challenge to God to say he's only serving you because you're doing these things right and it goes on to say has not Thou made a hedge and that Q I like that word hedge because we can use that to represent job's mountain mountain experience which is a hedge about him right because the enemy goes on to confess and about his house and about all that he have on every side thou has blessed and this is the enemy recognizing God has blessed job thou has blessed thy Work of his hands and his substances increased that means he is continually just getting richer he's continually getting better and Amy recognizes that this guy's on the mountain and that's the only reason that he's serving you that's the only reason that he loves you is because he's on the mountain right that's the only reason that he's blessing to blessing you but as soon as you take him off that mountain he ain't going to serve you no more he ain't going to believe in you no more right so another problem that we Face uh is when we um is when God is trying to bring us into the valley and we expect our Hilltop experiences to be there with us in the valley and that can create issues right that can create conflicts because we're expecting a good we're expecting those good experiences down here in the valley and God wants to God wants to take us through a different route right so when job was going through it's about going through his uh Valley because because as you read as you read further on down there you're going to see the enemy took everything from him right as job was going through his Valley he couldn't take his riches he couldn't take his family the enemy I'd take him out right on the Mountaintop uh we could see job's wife was so good to him she cooked she cleaned they went on dates right she was such a sweet wife but fast forward in the valley when he needed a shoulder to lean on when he needed someone to uh to say hey come down and praise me as I'm going through this thing she told him to curse God right right so she he couldn't he couldn't you sometimes you can't expect even your closest loved ones to be with you as you're going through a valley even though it may be a natural feeling for you right uh um the Bible says that he have friends right and not just friends these were church friends these were people that went to church with them and the Bible and if you read it it says they went to go mourn with him and help help him and comfort him and and uh um these were friends that job allowed to come over his house and they ate a bottle of food right they sat on his couch uh job gave them the best Hospitality to job when they were sick he prayed for them God confessed that job was the most righteous man in the land so these are things that a righteous man does but fast forward when he was in the valley when he needed just a few words of encouragement to say job you know what God's going to be with you God's going to help you from this they said he was secretly sinning now can you imagine this man right uh uh lost all his kids lost all his riches his wife is now tell him to curse God and now his friends who you expect uh his friends in Christ right his friends in Christ where he needs the Lord of encouragement from them right say you're you're secretly sending like you're doing something wrong and he knew his heart he wasn't doing anything wrong right right so a lot of times people expect to bring the though that happiness and those fielded emotions and and the reasoning of a situation uh uh down into the valley but God usually and a lot of times God takes a lot of that stuff away God takes a lot of those things away and now but when you try to take those Hilltop experiences down into the valley it creates a struggle inside you and now you're struggling whether you can trust in God or not because you put trust in other things than in him solely right so and and the reason why uh uh these things happened uh we're gonna go back to job uh chapter go back to verse 12 and chapter one we're going to see the reason why these things happen where job couldn't lean on his wife or Joe couldn't trust him his friends or a job couldn't trust him his riches and stuff so verse 12 says that and the Lord said unto Satan behold and this was after uh uh Satan challenged God that if hey if you take away everything with him I'll get him to curse you and the Lord said unto Satan behold all that he hath is in thy power so this is God given Satan uh the ability to go and take everything that he has right uh uh um you can you can anoint his wife you can you can anoint his friends you can take away his riches take away so now job is coming out of that Valley that hedge that was about him which was a which was a valley experience God has opened up that hedge job didn't open up he didn't want to go down that route Joe didn't want to go down the route but now God has opened up this hedge and now he's allowing job to kind of go down into this Valley uh and experience these things right and it wasn't of his own doing and it's and that's why a lot of times when we're going through uh um when you're going through a struggle God hasn't changed right God has not changed God will give the enemy power over your health God will give you the enemy power over your family sometimes you wonder why is my family acting the way that they do right God has allowed Satan to go and and we maybe we're all Christians we're all saved but that don't but that's not that's not a reason why the enemy still can't use people to try to affect you right because when Jesus was going through his time where he was going through a great valley right and he had to die on the cross and Peter said I won't let them kill you God looked at Peterson Satan get thee behind me right as he was going through his Valley what he needed was he needed Peter and them to help him so and so much that when he went to pray in the Garden of Gethsemane that he that when he was praying during that time he needed them to pray with him and they would sleep right so he couldn't depend upon them so this was Jesus Jesus about the greatest battle that anyone has ever gone through you know he couldn't depend upon he couldn't depend upon his friends right he couldn't depend upon how he felt about the situation because he said father not my will so when we're going through when we're going through sickness you know when we're going through uh struggles with the family marriage struggles our friendships are or any kind of hard time right and sometimes and I've heard the prophet saying we've all felt this before sometimes you don't even feel saved right your salvation isn't Based On A Feeling right it wasn't a feeling that brought Christ to uh to the Cross right and the cross represents not only our salvation but our healing forgiveness is sin sometimes you know you feel like you're not forgiven sometimes you feel why God hasn't forgiven you but it wasn't a feeling that pinned Christ to the Cross right it was love that did it it was love that did it in trust in his word where God is how he felt about the situation and we have to be the exact same way when we're going through our Valley when we're going through our struggle we're going through our sickness we got to say no he was wounded uh for our transgression transgressions by Stripes were healed that's all we're looking at because God will give the enemy power over your emotions and take it away take those feelings away from you and you can't get them back and a lot of times we struggle to do that and you see a lot of people in life struggle to do that so they'll do drugs they'll find a enjoyment and other things to try to get emotions those emotions back but God was allowed the enemy power over everything that you got and what God is wanting to do is for you to trust in his word alone because that brings about Victory right that brings about the victory so uh so the beauty in these expectations is that we can we can we can change the expectations when we're down in the valley to say you know what Lord I'm going to trust you Lord no matter how I'm feeling Lord no matter what the situation looks like the doctor said that it's over right the doctor said and and that's why you can't use reason in education right because the doctor will give you every single you don't even know what he says he says your blood blood levels your O2 or 3b5 or and the protein 95 is in in the negative you know I don't even know what that means right but he's telling you that it's done it's over right and it sounds good I know it sounds good right it sounds almost true but God in that situation God is wanting you to lean on his word even more regardless of what you're feeling of how of what you're doing because God will allow the enemy to take away your old Health God allow the enemy to uh uh uh to put you on your deathbed right got around to put you on your deathbed right but he but he's what he's wanting you to do is just to stand on his word right to know that even regardless of it regardless of that you're down there in the valley God what are you trying to get out of this situation right and that's and that's what we fail to ask because we're always looking to be on top of the mountain but instead of asking God what are you trying to get out of this situation right because a lot of times a lot of times you know we say we love our kids right you say we love our kids and all of a sudden they're gone they've gone Wayward right and it's like God why is all this thing why has all this happening I thought you loved your kids because that because when your kids are Wayward and it causes you to go out the way and to pray for them to do things that has causing great stress on you it's a different kind of love you're showing for your kids that God's trying to bring out of you right God's trying to bring that out of you he doesn't want you just to love your kids when everything is good right because that's not true love right so God allow your kids to go Wayward uh go wild and I mean out in the world and doing whatever they want because he wants to bring out a different kind of love inside of you right and so God will allow all these things to happen uh uh um in the valley right so it's uh it's important for us it's important for us um in closing it's important for us to uh make sure our expectations are lined up with God right and the key in doing that is focusing on what does God want out of this situation that's why we yield ourselves right and a lot of times when we say oh Lord we sing it oh Lord I yield myself oh Lord I sacrifice myself but what if God wants you to go through a great trial what if that yielding means God wants you to give up your health right because the thing about it is job loved his health he said the thing I feared most Came Upon me which was the cancer God allowed to Amy to take something that was precious to him that was dear to him right and so we have to ask ourselves uh um God what are you wanting to get out of this situation God what are you wanting to pull outside of me what are you wanting to pull uh to bring outside of me while I'm in this Valley oh Lord that could give you glory right so it's and and it's not always going to be easy it's not always going to feel good it's not always going to it's there's not always sometimes we want to praise we want unhindered praise which is not reasonable we want to be able to praise God without hearing doubt we want to be able to praise God without without feeling like it's not doing nothing but there are times where God wants you to praise regardless of it regardless of it he wants you to we want you to worship Him regardless of it and God loves that praise even though we may not think he does you know we may not think he hears it right and so it's it's it's it's it's it's it's important for us to stand on to stand on that word uh which which involves us just yielding to him yielding to his will and that's why he says these things that's why Bible says uh uh you know you're not we're not trying to come down on Earth and build our own kingdom and do our own things Lord what do you want right when you yield yourself to his will that helps you when you go through the valley because a lot of times people go through the valley and God's going to bring you through if you're a son or daughter of God God will bring you through a valley and not just one he'll bring you through multiple valleys he'll bring you through multiple values and it's important that you yield yourself and you yield your will to him because it makes the experience better it makes the experience better or else you're going to be struggling you're going to be battling right and God wants to have God wants to give you a satisfaction on the other side that when I went through this thing I trusted in God I stood on his word I believed in him and he brought me through it and that satisfaction is the greatest thing that you can ever have right that satisfaction is the greatest thing that we could ever have all right so we're gonna um we're gonna pray um but yeah we got to it's it's it's a and that's why it's a continual it's a continual status it's a continual sacrificing to God which is why God wants us to read our Bibles every day God wants us to come to church right we're not just coming to church just to sit sit down and uh uh and put on a Persona because a lot of times you see that people you see people put on a church Persona you see people put on some kind of a a church look to be a church person and that's not what we're coming to church for that's not what we're doing this for we're trying to die out to ourselves because we don't know where God could bring us because we can't control whether we're going to be on the mountain we can't control where we're going to be on the valley and we want to make sure that we're open we want to make sure that you know it's there's no there's not a more there's not more of a struggle when we're going through the valley because we have an expectation inside of our head of how things should be which just makes the situation seem worse than it was but that and that's why I love it in Psalms David said he make it me lie down in Green Pastures David's yielded his good times to God David has yielded his good times to God David Azure at the Times where hey Lord if if if if you want me to have a good season you're going to lead me there then he also says yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil right so now he's yielding he's yielding his guidance in the valley to God it says if you brought me here I'm not going to fear what's going on I'm just going to trust you you're going to you're going you're going to be with me it says dial rod and I staff Will Comfort me that means I'm going to have comfort in this thing see David has surrendered himself surrendered his mouth on tops in his Valley to God so that his experiences end up being a blessing all right amen um let us pray um Lord Jesus we thank You O Lord God for uh speaking to us O Lord God we thank You O Lord God for your wisdom O Lord God and your your grace and your knowledge O Lord God of your mercy O Lord God because there's people O Lord God out in the world right now that are trying to find that satisfaction everybody in the world goes through ups and downs whether you're a Christian or not a Christian or Lord God it's how you design man you design man to go through these episodes go through these ups and downs to experience these different attributes that are inside you that can be expressed inside of us as well Lord God so we thank You O Lord God that we may not be in a big church oh Lord God Lord but you've come down and spoke to us oh Lord God let these words be seeds that are planted within our souls O Lord God and take root Lord God so that when we're going through our valleys when we're going through our tough times and there's fear on all this fear everywhere Lord God on every side oh Lord God and the enemy is trying to make us doubt oh Lord God we can hang on to your word and your word Lord Jesus Christ Lord you're looking for a church that is without spot or wrinkle oh Lord God you're not you didn't say he was coming for a denomination you said you were coming for a word Briar Lord God that's resting on your word and your word alone oh Lord Jesus Christ and that's going to help take us through the valley oh Lord Jesus Christ we thank you for the mountaintops O Lord God but we know O Lord God those aren't made to last O Lord Jesus Christ because the great Mountaintop experience that we're looking for is when one day cross over the Jordan of the Lord God into our Eternal home oh Lord God where we don't have to worry or struggle about anything else O Lord God we're not trying to bring that down here on Earth our Lord Jesus Christ so Lord help us oh Lord God as we go through the valleys help us oh Lord God to trust in you help us oh Lord God to surrender ourselves O Lord God and to stand on your word and your word alone lord it's hard to do it Lord Jesus Christ and you know it yourself because you came into a body oh Lord God and when it was time for you to give up your will Lord it wasn't any a decision for you to do that when you saw what was going to happen oh Lord God Lord but you still were able to have the victory O Lord God so we're looking for You O Lord God to come down and in our lives O Lord God and give us that decision O Lord God to stand on your word alone or to bring us through the valley oh Lord God some people are sick Oh Lord God some people are dealing with health issues that they dealt for years oh Lord God lord you just said we can't control how long we stay in the Valley of the Lord Jesus Christ we can't control how long we're sickle Lord God it's not up to us oh Lord God but what we can do oh Lord God is still praise you for who you are Lord Jesus Christ because you're a Healer oh Lord Jesus Christ oh Lord the blood wasn't shed in vain oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord give us the endurance O Lord the spiritual endurance of the Lord to go through our trials oh Lord God give us this spiritual endurance when we're praying for our loved ones our way our wayward kids oh Lord God you never gave us a timeline when they would come back oh Lord Jesus Christ the lord gave us a promise that they would come so Lord while we're in our waiting O Lord God lord anchor us down our Lord Jesus Christ anchor us down O Lord God to stand on your word O Lord God lord we're not trusting in our emotion the enemy is overtaking them oh Lord God we're not trusting in our reasoning we've tried to to battle with him in the Mind Games he's too smarter than us oh Lord Jesus Christ so we just want to stand on your word alone O Lord Jesus Christ we surrender all of our mental faculties we surrender all of our emotions oh Lord we surrender all the excitement we surrendered the expectations O Lord God To You O Lord God said you can use us O Lord God what are you trying to show Lord God what what the Bible said the prophet said that the book that acts is still being written O Lord God what Bible verses are you wanting to write in our life oh Lord Jesus Christ oh Lord show us oh Lord God give us that give us that give us that of that energy O Lord that spiritual endurance O Lord God to press through the Lord God so that when we get on the other side Lord God when we say thank you Lord God we can say without knowing that we didn't have an attitude O Lord God knowing that we didn't we didn't question You O Lord God and there's a satisfaction knowing that when all we could do was stand alone we stood we still still in the word oh Lord God grant it to us father O Lord just as we just as um it just as Zoe was in that was in that shop when she saw everyone else getting getting something oh Lord God she cried to get it too Lord we're crying because we see in the Bible you've stood with people O Lord God you you gave you've given job the strength to endure his value Lord endure his test O Lord now we're crying oh Lord we need that same endurance now Lord Jesus Christ we're your children oh Lord God you called us here Lord God we didn't bring us we didn't bring ourselves here oh Lord God oh Lord we just want to thank you and praise you regardless oh Lord God for you and dear are worthy O Lord to be king of the Lord God we thank you and we just want to say we love you in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen [Applause] God bless you brother amen praise the Lord hey man we really appreciate brother Quentin Junior forgetting himself how to win allowed the Lord to use him just a wonderful message uh expectation in the valley I believe right expectations in the valley you know is that right yeah expectations in the valley I I was I was just thinking as I was sitting back there and it kind of remind me of the story that the prophet told about when president um Lincoln Abraham Lincoln the freed the slaves and he was saying how some of the more fit slaves are run up to the top of the mountain because he said at Sunrise you'll be free so there was ones that went all the way up to the top of the mountain and they were the first ones to see the sun begin to rise and so as they begin to see the sun rise they will reach back look back and tell the one belong that we're free because the sun is rising and then that want to reach a look back behind them until the next one down there were free because they were listening to him that the sun is rising so by Brother Quentin tonight I said even though you might be in the valley he sent a word amen to terrible acquaintance you're still free amen because the sun is Right amen you may be in the valley but the sun is risen you're still free you might be in the valley of decision in the valley of confusion but one thing about the valley the Bible tells us that he is a lily in the valley amen and he's a bright and a Morning Star so when you're in the valley he's there when you're on the mountain top he's there another thing about the valley he's uh he's talking about David how he said I walk through the valley of Shadow one day David said I look to the Hills from which cometh my help my help coming from the Lord so when you're in the valley you might be down there but you only got one thing to do look to the heels amen because your help is coming amen he didn't leave you there by yourself amen I know what you're going through or you might uh things in your body or it might be confusion or like he said that things on the job or whatever he valid experiences we have to go through amen as a part of the Christian experience amen but we know that our God is able to deliver us amen even in the valley we see songs of praise to him amen I praise him in the valley I praise him in the good times I praise him in the bad times why because he is still God even in the valley amen about to just appreciate brother Quinn I say thank you so much for uh uh getting yourself out of the way and allowing God to use you amen just a wonderful message we're not going to be
