sister bernice i won't sign for it [Applause] but they were trying to send something my way but i ain't signing for it i suggest you know just what inspiration you know we know brother branham taught us that and just a really really nice inspiration that she grabbed and and and brought that to us so we thank god for that amen and uh just just so just just love the lord um i don't think i need to announce anything so i'm gonna go right into the word of the lord amen on today amen um oh i did need to announce one thing and that is i want to officially welcome brother quinton jr amen to our fellowship he was waiting on a particular thing and i don't want to steal his thunder but amen i let him tell it uh but uh but the lord has done that thing amen and and he is officially a part of a man of the fellowship i know joy was here praise the lord god bless you brother joey my another drama in the house amen amen praise god uh just one quick scripture amen um isaiah chapter nine i i was been thinking about this particular sermon it's a sermon that i have preached uh and i went back to look i realized it was eight years ago that i preached this and so a lot of y'all when they one went around when i preached it so let's be fresh for some of y'all uh but for the others it'll be somewhat of a refresher uh during this christmas season uh but uh nonetheless i believe the lord will bless us a man in our journey amen on today isaiah 9 and verse 6 who says for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace amen the lord at a blessing to the reading of his word let's just pray father we thank you for your word and thank you for your truth that endure to all generations and father we pray that you will just get the glory out of the thought that's being presented your word is eternal how you gave it to us in one season god you give it to us again in another season uh for we you have purpose uh for it every time you do we pray father that you would just uh take control over this portion of service thank you for your anointing that has been here through the song service and lord just through the specials everything that's been done has been bringing you glory so now let the word do the same so in jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you can be seated amen this morning uh we want to just use for our topic today for unto us a child is born man for unto us a child is born amen and like i said i i ministered on this some years ago and i'm sure to go different today but nonetheless we want to just enjoy the presence of the lord amen i want to just start amen by reading uh a couple of quotes uh from uh first sermon would be sirs we would see jesus amen sirs we would see jesus and um and as i'm as i'm reading this my wife did bring it to my attention and i just realized it again this morning uh i use a older version of the software to actually form my sermons and uh and when they're pulling up the quotes amen on the screen it is a newer version of the software so i think they have changed some of the words or just went back and edited and tried to make it as clear as possible in the new version so uh i might worries that i might read may not be on the screen but it's okay we still read the same thing and eventually i will get synchronized with what they have on the screen so just bear with us amen as we go sirs we would see jesus um the prophet says what what's the matter he's got lost again and he's talking about christ amen and and and especially he preached his sermon on new year's i'm sorry christmas eve in in 1961 uh this was his christmas sermon that he was bringing and uh he was just talking about how christ is lost again uh in the christmas season and and we all know that uh my they have completely kicked jesus out now it was never his birthday in the first place right we understand that it was never his birthday in the first place uh but it wasn't a time where people had to acknowledge uh what it was all about right when they were celebrating him they were celebrating his his birth and everything but now santa claus has taken his place and and so many other things have taken his place uh but uh but we want to you know just we want to keep the focus on christ amen at least that's what i want to do i want to keep it about jesus amen for unto us a child is born amen it says well what's the matter he's he got lost again people's lost him that's right but he he's been lost again in the big crowds the crowds of creeds uh you remember one time he got lost to his parents he's lost again he got lost go down these streets like it's been the last few days look at the mad crowds pushing and shoving and drinking and cursing and damning jingle bells jingle bells christ is lost he ain't lost the people's lost him where did they find him where they lost him amen where they lost him at that's where we'll find him but he's lost in their creeds and in the crowds praise the name of the lord you know uh you know and as i'm gonna go on in this quote a little bit but uh things just continue to change brother branham you know talking here in 1961 just look at the crowds traffic get unbelievable you know this time of year it's it's just and people do some crazy things you know out there on the road you know and it's like my god we all you know what what is this you know and uh and and it's really really uh unfortunate that that people just get so much in debt at a time like this at this time of year it's really not supposed to be that way amen that that's that's it my god i i i i you know it's just it's a it's a shame what it has become but uh but you know the other thing that i realized is that things continue to shift um some actually the the the the streets are more loaded with amazon trucks amen and ups trucks praise the lord amen and now anybody will deliver at your house they they i mean they they can't hire enough people to get the packages out anybody show up at your house dress like anything with a box in their hand you can't i mean if it was up to you you would never invite that person over to your house but because you ordered something online praise the lord and you want it by a certain time glory to god amen amazon got some elves out there amen they bringing all kind of stuff to the house but you know it's just it's unbelievable what what is going on in our world and the way things have have just shifted and changed you know uh just to satisfy people trying to get a particular package by a particular day hallelujah it keeps a lot of people in business i can tell you that much uh but he says here he says um uh he's lost in their crees and in the crowds he's lost christ is lost in the commercial crowd the commercial crowd saying we got to celebrate christmas a lady said the other day standing there when wife and i were standing there and i says i i brought uh my dad a quarter whiskey other one said i'm going to get i tell you what i'm going to i'm going to get dad i'm going to get him some cards and some chips now brother brandon i'm just standing there listening to this conversation i can't believe what christmas has been deduced to yeah all right and it says uh uh uh we'll since i'm gonna get him some some cars and some chips we'll play strip poker to celebrate christmas now this is what somebody's sending on by their daddy to play strip poker prophet hearing this and he's like what in the world is this all about jesus has been lost they lost him right he said it goes on to say this uh it says other said i got a curtain of cigarettes for mom what'd you get her oh oh god he's lost they lost him in christmas they lost him in easter bunny rabbit or a new hat not the resurrection not the birth of christ they lost him in their creeds when they made three gods out of him chopped them into pieces and made an idol instead of knowing who he is i and my father are one you lost him amen amen this morning i want to say we're not lost we know exactly what this is all about and and this is why i read the scripture for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace and he said he said they lost them in amongst creeds they mean they lost amongst dogma they lost him amen even in some of their teachings they they fail to realize that when when god was sending jesus to the earth it wasn't just sending his son but god himself became the son so that he could die for our sins see unto us a child was born and there was a purpose for that child coming amen amen amen let's go on a little further here amen uh i want to read from the message the deity of jesus christ glory hallelujah hallelujah he says this no room for him people around here saying that they are of christ they're churches of christ they go to and what happened last night open up their christmas presents let's see about daddy in there i was under the christmas tree of a mini man last night set a big box of beer somewhere no room for jesus i want you to keep jesus amen the reason for the season no room for jesus all for beer open up mama's present a deck of cards no room for christ the cards that's right instead of a little bible or something to the children it's a little g-man book or a little something like that no room for jesus instead of going to church they go to shows dances everything and call themselves christians brother when the deity of god by the holy ghost comes into the human heart it calls out everything that christ hasn't created you know that's the truth amen it's the truth anyhow it says god christ the hope of glory in you not in a cradle in you that was one time god was back in the beginning then he come into moses he he come in the children of israel he come in the cradle but now they're worshiping him way back like some prehistoric something when christ is in you glory to god here he is today the son of god moving up his great church is moving i say amen to that amen we're not looking at christ in the cradle but we're looking at christ in one another all right let me go a little further here amen glory to god we're going to turn a corner uh i love to always try to keep uh our focus on jesus amen when it comes to the season and i'm not telling you don't go out and buy gifts brother branham did it he bought gifts for his uh for his family amen and there's nothing wrong with that just don't get out of control with it amen don't don't get out of control with it and make sure you treat all the kids equally now praise the lord don't get one some a big extravagant something other than got pencils and then you're wondering why you got a problem in your house right as parents you got to treat all your kids the same that's the way god treats us he treats us all the same i mean when a parent gives one child a little bit more favoritism than the other that's going to be a problem in that house amen hallelujah so make sure you keep them all on the same level no matter how you i might feel a little bit better about not don't show it don't show it amen not amongst the others you'll have problems in your house when you do that glory to god amen hallelujah somebody don't know why i got so quiet there but amen but god is good you know just just keep it all within balance church that's that's the main thing i think i think if we don't have balance with what we got then it's useless to us right that chair that you're sitting in got balance and what what it balances is those four legs if there was only three legs on that chair you wouldn't sit in it it wouldn't it wouldn't it wouldn't do any good for you to have a chair like that right i mean you got to have balance in everything that you do glory to god and i believe the prophet certainly brought balance when it came to this holiday he said christmas is here to stay and one of the things they told us not to say don't deprive your children even though we know the truth of these things don't deprive your children of it that's what he said all right i'm not here to you know to go through that i'm here to talk about jesus for unto us a child is born hallelujah glory to god hey and if you always if y'all's to be honest with me we've been so dogmatic and so legalistic uh with christmas that we lost some of our family it's the truth in it how we didn't have to be that way but we some of sometimes we did things just purely out of fear somebody gonna preach it and the person that preaching did not have a balance on it it's the truth so we try to keep a balance on these things amen church all right all right all right now now um here i'm going back to this message um sirs we would see jesus and um as we read this scripture from us a child is born and oh my i forgot to set my timer uh i'll i'll try not to be here too long i i really will uh but just let's just let's let's let's let's enjoy ourselves the bible says for unto us a child is born untouchable son has given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace brother branham says in his quotes lest he says isaiah said his name should be called in the same chapter he said his name shall be called it says the 55th chapter of isaiah now we just read it out of isaiah 9. so we know that was not correct what he said it's a uh he says his name would be called a wonderful counsellor of the prince of peace the mighty god the everlasting father amen says wish i had time i ought to i like to take a text on each one of them and i wish i had time i like to just take a text and what he's saying he says he would love to take a text on on um wonderful all right amen or just take a text on counselor hallelujah and then just come and work with the mighty god boy this would be some preaching i i wish he would have took time and took a text once he would he would take a text on the everlasting father glory to god and then he would preach on the prince of peace he would just take all these and and and you know just just kind of work with him but today we're going to try to use a catch a couple of them by by the grace of god if we can but he says let's just strike the thought wonderful for a minute it says oh isaiah said he was wonderful amen let's think of some things that he said that made him wonderful amen tell me what uh what pharisee could have said that tell me what high priest could have said that with with god backing it up see uh if it don't um i'm sorry i missed some sense one what made him wonderful when he when he uh when he said this i and my father are one he said that made him wonderful when he said i and my father are one and and i like that because that very statement in itself glory to god it proves the theology of isaiah because isaiah said for unto us a child is born glory to god he says unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god look at this part the everlasting father how can a child that is born be the everlasting father but when this child steps up on the earth and he looks the pharisees and sadducees in the eye and he says i and my father are one brother that is wonderful [Applause] proving the theology of isaiah glory to god amen let's go on a little further man he says uh wonderful tell me what pharisee could have said that tell me what high priest could have said that with god backing it up see said if i don't do the works now don't believe anything i say but if i preach this then it shows that god sent me to do it said now he said i am my father one not i my father are three no jesus said now the creed says i and my father are three but the bible said that jesus said i and my father are one that's wonderful glory to god see how see how god made flesh hallelujah not some second or third or fourth person but god himself jesus said so argue with him not with me amen he says i'm just saying what he said i am my father one it's not me that doeth the works it's my father he dwells in me if you don't believe me believe the word because he's in the word and the word was made flesh and i am in in the beginning was the word the same gospel writer john said in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us that makes him and god the same person if god is the word and he is the word i and my father are one then oh that's wonderful yes sir so many things we could say on that wonderful things he said as i looked at this word wonderful it means astonishing miraculous uh extraordinary as in magnifice magnificence amen this is what uh the word wonderful means and you know there's things that he said but there's also things that he did that would make him wonderful amen and and one of the uh the very first things that that that was recorded in scripture of him doing amen was when he showed up to a wedding hallelujah as a guest to a wedding amen it's good to have jesus at your wedding glory to god and here he comes as a guest to the wedding just like all the other guests he has turned in his rsvp if i can if i can put it that way he's let them know that he would be there and he gets there to to the wedding and you know and you can tell this was uh one of those marriages where maybe uh they had spent all their money trying to get a dress amen and maybe trying to secure a venue they don't spend all the money until amen when they when they get here amen and and they're just looking good in front of everybody's eyes but when the wine begins to run out hallelujah somebody this is when they are exposed and because back in those days when you when you when you serve your guests amen uh you give them the best one at the beginning hoping that they wouldn't want no more wine a little bit later and then you give them the worst wine at the end hallelujah but at this wedding glory to god they began to run out of wine and it was it was a desperate situation and jesus mother happened to be there mary happened to be there and she said now uh she said nothing out now jesus they got a problem uh well what's the problem he said they don't run out of wine so they ain't got nothing to do with me say now uh i'm coming to you because i know you can do something about it now the reason i say this the first recorded amen uh a miracle in the scripture i believe mary saw some things in the house come on somebody i believe mary experienced some things in her own house that she knew amen that she could go to jesus and get this problem resolved no other guest at that wedding would be able to solve this problem he she knew this would be an embarrassment to the family this would be a man just shame on the friend could you do something about it jesus and when she when he finally maybe just gave a little look she said now whatever he tell you to do just go do it whatever you tell you to do just go do it say now take me some pots and just fill them up with water now maybe these people thinking to themselves why would i just go get pots and fill them up what look don't question jesus whatever he tells you to do just do that went and got the pucks and filled him up with water and as he as he he prayed over it and blessed it he said that wine was better than the wine at the original how did he say y'all done save the best wine for last i can tell you right now the parents amen that were not embarrassed at that that child's wedding would look to jesus and say this man is wonderful this man is astonishing this man is miraculous this man is extraordinary hallelujah glory to god i think amen uh brother branham even brought it and as i don't i won't read the entire quote but if you kept reading in that brother brandon start talking about how he was on his way a man into a city one day and and as he's uh going to the city just happened to be passing through the city of name and as he's passing through uh at the time he's walking by here comes a a mother that just had a funeral burying her son her only son amen uh and as she as she's buried him and tears are flowing down her her her cheeks and you know she's just uh my what am i gonna do and and just what happened they pat they they crack they pass crossed at the right time and when jesus saw the buyer going by the bible say all he did was just touch the buyer and before you knew it the boy that was in the buyer set up glory to god amen it's time for some of our loved ones to sit up glory they've been amen amen and and i mean they they experience spiritual death it's time for them to sit up but we need jesus to give them a touch hallelujah when this man when this man set up and began to talk and they took him back home to eat and glory to god i can imagine that mother looking at her son eating when she's supposed to be burying him but now she's looking at him eat at the table that mama say this man jesus he's wonderful he's wonderful i reminded of him going to a man his friend's house and intentionally he did not go at a particular time uh but they sent for him to say lazarus is ill lazarus is ill and he never went to pray for lazarus but he finally got word that lazarus was dead glory to god and when he got word that lazarus was dead amen he uh he told the disciples saying now uh our friend lazarus he sleepeth and we're gonna go wake him and some of the disciples say now if he's sleeping just let him sleep let him get some good rest say no i y'all don't get it yet i i'ma put it in your terms so you understand lazarus is dead but don't forget what i said i say let's go wake him hallelujah amen so here they come a man along the way to to visit uh mary and martha and and and lazarus and and when they get there you know the the sisters are just kind of in an uproar and and that they're like oh if you were to come if you'd only come a little earlier you know i don't believe my brother would have died it would say now now look i am the resurrection and i am the life and he that believeth on me although he were dead yet shall he live hallelujah say now if you just if you only believe you're gonna see a miracle today say all right all right all right i believe i believe and she said even now you know i believe that whatever you ask god i love that statement i know my brother's in the grave i know i know the situation's against me amen i know i got a river that's uncrossable holy but even now praise god if you would just ask god i believe he'll give it to you go get your sister tell her to come on and come to the grave jesus there crying amen in the midst with him just showing that he can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities and here here he is crying amen going along uh with them to the grave where they say where you laid them where you where you laid them and i said okay we're going to show you where we laid them and when they got there glory to god to where they laid at me saying now y'all roll the stone away oh come on somebody amen now now this is this is something you know when you really look at this amen he had to tell these sisters all these other men standing by glory to god he didn't ask for nobody to help him say y'all roll the stone away glory god sometimes you got to get involved in rolling things away glory to god sometimes the things that we speak actually roll the stone over but it's today it's our apologies that role is thrown away glory to god somebody he told him sisters rolled a stone away and when he said they say no no no now lord by this time he stinks say i now did not tell you if you just if you only believe you'll see a miracle and there they stood amen at the grave of lies with the stone rose away and he yelled amen screamed out lazarus come forth lazarus come out of the grave after being gone four days glory to god and i can imagine them sisters look at their brother and he told them to take them grey clothes off of them because he ain't walking around like that no more and when they saw their brother glory to god they could look at jesus man he's wonderful [Applause] oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to god i'm i'm reminded amen of uh of another passage in scripture there was a priest a man in his and his wife they had a 12 year old child and this this young lady uh was uh a sickened to death and they knew that that girl was going to a premature grief and uh so so the mother you know told the father look i know you're a priest and you're part of the you know the counsel and all this say but but the counselor can't help us but there's a man that we know can help us and he's living in the land his name is jesus so you need to find out where he is and go to him and bring him to this house and and the husband told him josh said all right i'm gonna get it done i'm gonna go find jesus and he left out that morning to go find jesus and he run into a city and there was jesus he come and got his attention saying lord i need you to come to my house i got a daughter that is sick and she's only a young young young child and you know and i just want you to pray for him maybe maybe god will hear your prayers she'll be here he says i'll come and i'll go with you and as jesus was on the way to jairus house glory to god the bible tells us of another woman a man that noticed the big crowd that was gathering and my mind just began to think on this woman how many times she might have gone to different services and got a prayer line and couldn't get into the prayer line how many times a man she she might have heard that he was in this city and just missed him she'd come the day after he left how many times has happened to her and she finally got after 12 years of amen of battling with this blood condition she heard once again that jesus was jesus was in town she said this time i'm not gonna miss him say i know i'm stuck here inside my house glory to god i'm not supposed to go out and touch nobody but and even the law said that he cannot come and touch me but the law did not say that i could not go and touch him so she had something in her heart she says i'm gonna go and just touch the hem of his car man she say i'm not gonna take no for an answer i know he's on the way to jail's house but i need him to do something wonderful for me praise god she said if i could just touch the hem of his garment i don't need him to say a word to me i don't need him to look me in the eye just let me touch the hem of his garment and i know i'll be made whole she reached out and touched him he stopped and stopped the process and said who touched me and they say now wait a minute now all these people touching you jesus said no no no somebody touched me a little different the way she just touched i mean i need to find out who it is and as he looked through the crowd he spotted the woman say woman what was it what was what was going on so you touched me and said your faith done made you whole so that's all i i knew that once i touched you that i was gonna this condition was gonna dry up right then that lady could look there and look at everybody and say look i'm gonna tell y'all something he's wonderful he's wonderful glory to god he's wonderful amen this you know there's so many things that we can look at in scripture and we can see why isaiah would get so inspired they call them wonderful counselor mighty god everlasting father prince of peace amen i was just thinking on this you know when when we look at just that word counselor it's to advise amen consult give counsel it's to devise a plan or to plan it it's to have a purpose right uh oftentimes when when a person is giving counsel they got to have a purpose in what they're doing hallelujah uh uh if i'm giving counsel i'm trying to help the person get to the next level right the counselors not to try to bring people closer to you oh hallelujah hey hallelujah you know you know uh uh in the bible we had uh uh uh david's son uh absalom absalom would stand in the gates and he would tell the people i wish that y'all would come see me and not bother my daddy with all that it says i wish that y'all come to me absent had something amen an ulterior motive as to why he wanted the people to come see him absalom wanted to become the king hallelujah right so sometimes you got to watch people like that amen why are they not sending them to the to the pastor why they trying to take on that themselves everybody's not supposed to be giving counsel glory to god you got to know when to stop talking certain situations say no that need to go to the pastor you don't need to share no more with me take that straight to the pastor hallelujah amen god got an order of how he do things we got to watch the absaloms that'll rise up in the midst glory to god absalom wanted to give out counsel amen amen he had an evil spirit that was on them and you know i i thought about this and let me just go ahead and and give you this scripture counsel is something amen it's it's it's it has a purpose it has a plan amen behind it uh psalms 107 verse 11 let's just read this scripture psalms 107 and verse 11 amen glory as i looked at that word counseling just kind of looked at some other scriptures that that would be related to it amen i found this one i thought i would give it to you oh hallelujah hallelujah amen here in psalms 107 11 it says because they rebel amen against the words of god and contempt which means to spurn the council of the most high all right now when we when you look at a man the context of this this scripture is talking about the children of israel amen and and uh they were given divine instruction by god through a prophet they were supposed to leave egypt and go into the promised land amen but as they were on the way to the promised land glory to god they begin to complain they begin to murmur along the way glory to god and i'm going to tell you that still happens to people today amen they're on their way to a promise god is getting ready to manifest something in their life but it as they're on the way they begin to murmur they begin to complain glory to god amen they lose sight of the promise amen they take they they kind of put their eyes on the problems rather than keeping their eyes on the promise glory to god amen and so so when they started to to complain and murmur amen the bible tells us they begin to rebel against the words of god and they spurn the council of the most high and because they did this they ended up walking through the wilderness for 40 years sometimes you can delay your promise from coming to pass your your murmuring your complaining can delay your promise from coming to pass that's why brother branham say the right mental attitude towards any divine promise will bring it to pass hallelujah god gave them counsel god gave them a plan god gave them advice all they had to do was follow that here you know i want to pick up another amen scripture here in second kings chapter 6 verse 8 let's read this one this amen is dealing with counsel glory amen now i want to tell you that this our lord and savior was a was a counselor before he became flesh amen and we're going back in scripture and picking them up he was a counselor glory hallelujah amen let me uh get over in second kings chapter 6 verse 8 but all you have to do is follow his counsel amen second kings chapter 6 and verse 8. look at this glory hallelujah all right it says uh then the king of syria ward against israel and took counsel with his servants saying in such and such a place shall be my camp so so now this this king of syria is actually taking counsel with his servants he's sitting there devising a plan devising a strategy of what he's going to do to israel he is actually amen uh uh uh as he's talking it over with his his servants this is counsel that he's receiving glory to god hallelujah and now goes on says and the man of god said unto the king of israel saying beware that thou pass not such a place for this of the syrians are come down now now i want you to notice something the man of god is receiving his instruction from a higher council glory to god somebody amen i mean he's receiving his instruction from the council love glory to god so so as as he's getting his counsel now he's giving that to the king of israel and all the kingdom of israel needs to do is just follow godly counsel hallelujah hallelujah watch this you can avoid a lot of trouble if you would just follow godly counsel hey amen amen amen glory to god look at this look at this amen hallelujah my god my god amen it says uh verse 10 says and the king of israel sent to the place which the man of god told him and warned him of and saved himself self there not once nor twice that means he kept listening to counsel from the prophet amen and every time he listened it spared his life hallelujah let me keep going amen says therefore the heart of the king of syria was so troubled for this thing and he called his servants and said unto them will you not show me which of us is for the king of israel and one of his servants said none my lord o king but elisha the prophet that is in israel telleth the king of israel the words that thou speakest in thy bed chamber where is elisha the prophet getting it from he's getting it from the counselor glory to god amen it says and he said go and and spy where he is that i may send and fetch him and it was told him saying behold he is in dothan therefore uh send he did the horses and chariots and a great host and they came by night look at this they trying to sneak up on the prophet glory they came by night now didn't they realize if god was revealing to this man the secrets that was in his bed chamber then god would also reveal when this man was coming glory hallelujah this the prophet elijah which is a type of you and i was receiving counsel from heaven look at this church amen they came by night and compassed the city about and when the servant of the man of god was risen early and going forth behold a host can pass the city both with horses and cherries and his servants sent him alas my master how shall we do glory to god he says and he answered fear not for they glory hallelujah for they that be with us are more than they that be with them now that statement must have shocked amen his his uh his followers there it's like now they that be with us out of these eyes i can see this great army but what are you looking at prophet that you can make a statement like that look at this look at this he said elijah prayed and said lord i pray thee open amen his eyes that he may see and the lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw him behold the mountain was full of horses and chairs of fire round about elisha let's keep going he says and when they come down to him elisha prayed unto the lord and says might this people i pray thee with blindness and he smote them with blindness according to the word of elisha glory and elijah said unto them this is not the way neither is this the city follow me and i will bring you to the man whom you seek but but he led them to samaria let's keep going he says uh and it came to pass when they were come into samaria that elijah said lord open the eyes of these men that they may see and the lord opened their eyes and they saw him behold they were in the midst of samaria my and the king of israel said elisha when he saw them my father shall i smite them shall i smack them i like this because he's asking for counsel glory to god shall i smite them shall i spank them and he answered thou shall not smite them with us out smite those whom thou has taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow set bread and water before them that they may be that they may eat and drink and go to their master and he prepared great provision for them and where they had eaten and drunk and he sent them away and they went to their masses so the bands of syria came no more into the land of israel it was good that this man could follow the king himself could follow godly counsel elisha got his counsel from the council uh and he gave that amen to to the king and the king was able glory to god to follow the council and save not only himself but his entire army his whole city because he followed godly counsel this this this this this jesus that was given to us amen he's always been a counselor even when he came to earth there he was placed in in a situation where the pharisees thought they had him again they found this woman that they said we have taken her in the act of adultery we caught in the very act now they got to think about the words that they're using we caught her in the act of adultery she can't do this by herself but they come with her and say moses law tells us the stone of the death now you can you can you can see somebody tried to set this lady up maybe maybe she had something on somebody and maybe they wanted to try to kill according to the law amen a misrepresentation of the law glory to god they say he say say not say jesus the the law tells us that we suppose i mean moses says toner when we catch him like this what do you say he sat down and began to write in the sand hallelujah ignoring every accusation i want to tell you jesus has ignored every accusation that's been brought against you glory hallelujah every accusation he ignores it that's been brought against you they just began to write in the sand and he as he wrote in the sand he stood up and said now uh he that's without seeing let him cast the first stone what a counselor what a counselor and say the men had stones in their hands and and when they heard them speak those words one by one they began to drop their stones and they left us standing there by himself in the presence of the lord jesus and he speaks a word to say he said he said woman where are your accusers just say ain't got no lord he says well neither do i accuse you glory glory say go and sin no more now don't you get caught in this situation again because it might be a different response the next time but go and sin no more that woman could sit there say this man is a real counselor what a counselor what a counselor oh glory to god all right let's pick up something here oh thank you jesus amen here i'm going back to sirs we would see jesus and brother branham just kind of brings this it says what did he do what uh what was he that isaiah said he'd be wonderful when he got calling him all those names he could counsel a prince of peace mighty god everlasting father all this he said he's just wonderful he couldn't he can he couldn't say nothing else he was just so caught up he said he just wonderful wonderful words now we're going to talk about wonderful works for a minute what works did he do that that uh that that was wonderful one day there was a funeral procession coming from there a widow with only son dead laying on a bar sniffing out corpse and bomb going down to the grave to be buried he had traveled all the way from nazareth his feet are sore dusty tired weary he had that he heard that crying he looked coming down the road there come a little widow wailing her boy her only son laid on that stretch of dead worked out i worked out there that he passed by where jesus was in death and life can't come together you know one's got to go he said stop the buyer walked over and touched the board and life that was in the board that had been gone maybe two days returned back i can see just the shroud begin to move glory see the people begin to look and a man that was dead raised up on his feet walked over and put his arms around his mother perhaps that's the works of god wonderful wasn't it it sure was since i can see jairus a little priest been a nice man he believed jesus but had to keep it still on account of his associate so many secret believers today like that they're afraid to get uh to get put out of their church cowards it says god can't use that god wants a man that can stand there if it takes death seal it don't fear him who destroys the body but him that destroys the body and sends the soul to hell jairus i see him going uh to the home of of of this minister walked in and where he where where uh a little only child of 12 years old a little girl stiff dead laid out on the couch her little lifeless body lay there her little pale hands her nails had turned white her lips was drawn down a fever had killed her or something her little eyes were set and closed and something was laying over them perhaps her little hair had been combed with roses he says and things laying around her and the mother and father screaming the neighbor screaming his only child was going i see him walking to that room amen and he looked around and seen them all and they went to laughing at him he put them out of the room glory to god that's wonderful see one man can take control of the whole crowd why didn't they say something they were scared to say something why don't they condemn the word today they're scared to say it that's all and i just love that statement one man take control of the whole cloud brother brandon will walk out into a meeting and he say i take every spirit that is against the spirit of god underneath the control of the holy ghost one man one man can take control of the whole crowd hallelujah the reason he can do this because of what was dwelling inside that man it was it was almighty god he says walked into the room took that little cohen spoke in an unknown language out yonder somewhere and the spirit of that child come back and she lived again wonderful works yes it was it was wonderful prove that he was wonderful oh glory to his name you know um we we i want to amen uh bring amen maybe next week just a little bit talking about that peace there's been something that's been in my spirit we know peace is a person as none other than the person of the lord jesus christ he is he is called the prince of peace believe brother brother quaker mentioned in his prayer earlier how you know he stepped out there on that boat when he was sleeping and every devil in hell said we're going to kill him we're going to kill him today we got him on the boat in the middle of nowhere we got we got him and he's there sleeping and the devil's scheming while you sleeping you understand the devil scheming while you're sleeping and sometimes you wake up in the middle of a storm and all you were doing was that sleeping but you got to remember you still a son of god and you're still a daughter when you wake up you are son of god and the daughter of god and when jesus woke up shook the sleep off i can imagine he might have been snoring on the back of the boat and the disciples maybe somebody said don't wake him up he had to sleep like this a long time let him let him sleep now we about to die we got to get them up right now and i could see one of cypress go shake him say master carrots down not that we perish how is it that you can't even feel none of what what's going on out here we about to die and we only going on the other side because you told us to go jumped up out of his sleep and shook it off and went to the front of the boat and put his foot out there glory to god spoke words that the disciples never heard before they never seen nothing like this this man a man with his foot on the on the edge of a podium man praise god a man takes control of the situation speaks to the wind and waves peace be still glory you have that same authority dwelling inside of you that same power is dwelling inside you the prince of priests the prince of peace is not in a cradle the prince of peace is not in the pope but the prince of peace is living inside of you hallelujah glory to god i can see him speak to it and just turn around and go back to sleep where the disciples look to say what matter man is this even the winds and the seas open that's that's what we call the prince of peace but i love this amen a couple things that i want to bring isaiah uh gave him all these descriptions one of the scriptures there in isaiah 96 says for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given the government shall be upon his shoulder his name shall be called wonderful counsel the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace and i mentioned earlier and i want to just bring it back again and i'm going to uh a quote out of the revelation of jesus christ how can a child be an everlasting father i'm going to tell you this is a really good scripture if you got a a a a loved one a friend that is really stuck on three gods father son the holy ghost just ask them the question how can this child a child because everybody goes to the scripture and talk about christmas this is one of the favorite scriptures that everybody go to how can this child be the everlasting father i mean have them explain it to you i mean you believe in father son holy ghost but how can this child be the everlasting father not not a sec a second person or a third person but no this child isaiah told us that this child was the everlasting father here in the messenger of revelation of jesus christ brother branham says the great i am the almighty god has come as spirit to fill his true church he has a right and i just love this statement he has a right to move anywhere he wants to so you know sometimes you get people that don't i don't want nothing to do with your god i don't want nothing to do with this now i want nothing to do i i i i i you know i i ain't got nothing to do with it i just need you to know that god has a right to move anywhere he wants if you're going to breathe his good air he got a right to move anytime and anywhere he wants to glory to god and look at what the prophet says he has a right to move anywhere he wants to and upon anybody he wants to someone's got testimonies we can say now i wasn't thinking about the lord i i ain't want nothing to do with the lord but all of a sudden i felt something just moving on me pulling me see god got a right amen to move anywhere he wants to upon anybody he wants to since we don't make any holy men among us but the whole congregation of the lord is holy because of the presence of the holy spirit it is he the holy spirit that is holy not the congregation of itself now that is the revelation jesus christ is god hallelujah this is why we can say he's the everlasting father prince of peace you know isaiah isaiah didn't have a bad doctrine it was spot on jehovah of the old testament is jesus of the new no matter how hard you try you can't prove there are three gods but it also takes a revelation by the holy spirit to make you understand that truth that he is one it takes a revelation to see that jehovah the old testament is the jesus of the new satan crept into the church and blinded the people to this truth and when they were blinded to it it wasn't long until the church of rome stopped baptizing the name of the lord jesus christ so as i admit um i admit it takes a real revelation from the holy ghost to see the truth about the godhead these days when we're in the midst of the perverting of so much scripture but the prevailing overcoming church is built on revelation so we can expect god to reveal his truth to us however you actually don't need a revelation on water baptism it is right there standing staring you in the face would it be possible for one minute for the apostles to be led astray from a direct command of the lord to baptize the name of the father and the son and the holy ghost and then find them and willful disobedience they knew what the name was and there is not one uh there is not one place in scripture where they baptized any other way then in the name of the lord jesus christ common sense would tell you that the book of acts is a church in action and if they baptize that way then that is the way to baptize now if you think that is strong what do you think it is anyone who was not baptized in the name lord jesus had to be baptized over again here brother branham's clearly just telling us you know this this one that's called everlasting father this was god in the flesh amen the word became flesh unto us this son was given god was becoming flesh amen in in this child it was not god just sending a son but it was god becoming the son so he could die for our sins the other thing that isaiah says and i'll bring this in and i want to bring this to a close my god it says that uh for unto us a child is born unto us the son is given it says in the government shall be upon his shoulder oh glory to god glory to god let me just read one little quote and then i'll save us a little time and i'll give a little description this is going to come out of questions and answers the government government going to be upon his shoulder the government this this child can you imagine that and and you know i didn't i didn't see it until now i'm just i'm gonna look at we can look at this we had a a king in the bible by the name of josiah he was only eight years old eight years old and he he becomes the king amen of the entire nation of israel uh do we realize that eight-year-old boy had the government upon his shoulder the decisions that he made amen whatever he said was the law glory to god but i'm gonna tell you even in and with a child that young it's hard for him to understand what he needed but what he did have was some counselors he had good godly counselors around him that helped him to make the right decision glory to god let's look at this questions and answers part one brother branham says this jesus said down there when he was casting out devils not getting off this question now not not now just for a moment but jesus said when he was casting out devils he said who do your sons cast them out by if i with the thing of god cast out devils who does your sons cast them up by if you got a better policy show us see if i with the thing of god a man just think the thing of god their god above christ christ above the church there's god the father says certain certain thing then god the son moves his hand and the shadow follows it if i with the thing of god cast out devils who does your sons cast them out by amen look i want you to notice oh no matter how great a disease or how much affliction the devil could put on you jesus takes his finger to move it i love that amen no matter what the devil put on you jesus can take his finger and move it right on off glory to god just a finger my hallelujah amen oh my look at them big strong shoulders and arms and muscles just his finger moves every disease and cast out devils what a little thing the devil is i want to say that again what a little thing the devil is because jesus can move him with a finger he just takes his finger and moves him away then if i with the thing of god now let me show you some love some love of god but when a sheep was lost he didn't use his finger he laid him upon his shoulders and he took his whole being hands sheep around his shoulder the strongest most powerful part of a man is across shoulders and back you know that for all of his arms and muscles and muscles move out and he and he's taking the whole sheep put him upon his shoulder and here he comes not with his finger to cast out a little devil but here he comes with this all of his muscles of his leg all the muscles of his arm moving through the wilderness packing a lost sheep on his shoulder oh my if i with the thing of god cast out devils who does your son cast him out by oh hallelujah my brother bran i'm saying the devil is so little that jesus can just cast him out with a finger but when it comes to dealing with his children his sheep he puts those sheep on his shoulder the government shall be upon his shoulder and and here's what you need to understand about that as brother branham takes it a little further and he tells us a man that in the eastern civilization they would uh uh they have their weddings and and everything and and i remember you know when i was there in in uh in israel we went to visit and just so happened the hotel we were standing they were doing a wedding and you know they had everything all set up and and i would i you know i was not an invited guest so i had to become a spy hide behind a tree just to try to look at this wedding what in the world what they getting ready to do cause this is a little different and i see the the the the bride all dressed up and you can tell with the veil and everything this is brown she's sitting over there in the corner kind of in a garden and uh and all of her tenants are around her and and everything and and i see the groom you know to be he comes and uh comes into the garden and walks to where the bride is amen and everybody kind of steps out of the way he walks up and he lifts the veil and he looks at her and says yes this is her they put the veil back down he goes to the altar and he waits for her to come now there's a reason why that man had to look look up look look at look underneath that veil before he went to the altar because in his history amen one somebody got tricked one time thought he was marrying amen rachel got leah right so you better look underneath that veil and make sure that's the one yes this is the one and it goes down there to the alternate stand and he just rocking i just see him just rocking good god almighty like what is he doing and he's just waiting for her to come and finally she comes with her entourage on down to the altar and they perform the ceremony and brother branham saying those eastern cultures hallelujah it's a government being upon his shoulder in those eastern cultures what would happen is and this is why it's important we don't you know we don't sometimes we allow too much um of this new stuff get into wedding celebrations and we miss what it's really all about right i mean i i'll just be honest i'm one that i i believe in seeing wedding vows amen you can make up your own vows if you want to but we're going to do that plus these wedding vows right because sometimes they miss things in the wedding vows it sounds real cute right but you're missing some of the main points hallelujah on and obey and and and and and you know and sickness and in hell right and rich or poor you you when you make that vow before before god and before this congregation people are holding you to it the reason you are invited to the wedding is so that you can hold the couple that is getting married you can hold them accountable i was at your wedding i heard you make the vow what you talking about you quitting and giving up and divorcing no i was at your wedding i heard you make the vow come on somebody that's why you there you're not there just to get no cake or nothing a free plate no you there to hold that couple accountable but here you know you know the the young man that's getting married this groom needs to understand the responsibility and you know i was listening to a preacher a guy my old boss sent me something to say this preacher uh was going on he had this couple up in the church and i guess he was getting ready to get married he had the the the the the groom here and the bride here and the bride father and the mother and he told that he told grooming saying now now i say my god that ain't number the truth he say he said say the father can tell you uh my name got her through college my name got her her first car my name did this and my name did that when she was under my name she i mean these are all the things that she accomplished under my name that's what she got under my name but when when but when when we give it to you glory to god at the altar there's a way the responsibility is about to shift the government is now to be on your shoulders and you got to understand if my name did that then i'm expecting your name to carry her a little bit further take it further than what my name took her don't take her down but take her up because the government is now on your shoulders it's not my responsibility anymore [Music] when i had it i did what i was supposed to do with my name but not a government it's on your shoulders and brother branham saying say what happens is that that that bride she takes a veil she moves it you know from one show to the other shoulder on the groom it shows that there was a transfer of headship from the father to now this this young man the government is now on his shoulders say i wanna i need you to understand that that we are that that that young lady becomes that young man's responsibility we got it mixed up here some kind of way the the we feel like the the the young man get married and and and he becomes a young lady's responsibility but no no that young lady becomes the young man's responsibility hallelujah amen a brother should never feel satisfied being mr mom amen never god never intended for it to be that way amen is the truth any high glory to god but a man should never feel comfortable doing that glory to god you got to change something in your life but you're supposed to take care of your family she becomes your responsibility amen church glory to god glory to god amen hallelujah but but this is what this is what this when it says that uh here in isaiah the government should be upon his shoulder i i got this here if uh you can pull up that philadelphia church age quote um i'll i'll leave it i won't i won't worry brother branham just makes the statement it says when the bride is committed to the groom she takes off her veil and places it over the groom's shoulder signifying that not only is she under his dominion that she has transferred her rights to him she's under his dominion and she has transferred her rights to him that he is the head but also that he bears the responsibility and care that he and he alone no one else no other man no other power has any right and responsibility oh my i just love that i love that and and like i said don't get this mixed up nowadays amen and relationships don't get this mixed up we don't we don't we don't uh sometimes society just kind of push things that it's okay for the man to be like this okay for the i mean yeah he should be involved he should be involved but he can never be a mama he can never be a mama and don't try to make him a mama he wasn't built to be a mama but don't try to make them don't let society do that and sisters y'all not built to be daddy god didn't make you to be daddy i mean just because you work and pay bills and so that don't make you daddy right i mean you know sometimes it's because we live way above our means that's why we have to do some of these things amen glory to god glory to god but but the government is on the shoulders of that groom that bridegroom when he comes he has it when when that when that that that veil is transferred the government is now on his shoulders he needs to feel that responsibility you need to feel it oh hallelujah thank god he's wonderful he's a counselor he's a mighty god everlasting father prince of peace is all that and more amen we thank god this child has been given to us for unto us a child is born unto us the son is given the government shall be upon his shoulder his name shall be called wonderful counsel the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace god
