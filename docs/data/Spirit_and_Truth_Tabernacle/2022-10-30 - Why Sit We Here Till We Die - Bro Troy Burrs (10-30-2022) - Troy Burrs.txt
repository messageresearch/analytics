for our pastor amen God is good to us amen speaking with sister Lydia before and I wanted her to come and give a testimony if you will come at this time sister [Music] [Music] [Music] God bless you all to I'm just trying to get my bearing so I don't cry I want to thank God this morning for who he is God is truly truly amazing he's an awesome awesome father there's not words enough to describe who God is last year in November I had a fall and what I thought was just a simple fall I was going to sit and what I thought was a simple fall turned out to be very very bad I was in so much pain that I could hardly walk at times I mean I was trying to do everything that I had to do still but it was not easy it was very very very difficult the pain got so bad it was really really bad that I could hardly walk at times there are days actually that I could not walk so I had been to the doctor um they did a series of tests they did MRIs more than one CT scans whatever and so they sent me to do treatment because they discovered that I due to the fall that I had three or more herniated discs in my back two of which are the major discs they said and one was a bulging disc there was a lot of inflammation as far as I understand and so it was really hard to tell you how bad it was can't describe it and I mean I would be crying out to God brother jaram and I would be praying I didn't tell it we didn't tell it to anybody really actually at First a very few people knew about it except Pastor Jack your brothers and sister are candy sisters brother Stanley knew about it we didn't really tell it to anybody I told him I said sometimes when you're going through stuff you just want people to stand in faith with you you don't want everybody to know sometimes it's not good to do a whole lot of talking you know you have to limit what you say you know I believe that because sometimes the enemy could take things and and I don't you know so I said okay he said um we know that Pastor Jack and your brothers have been praying thank you so much God bless you all sister Erica and his sisters brother Stanley thank you my husband stood with me the ideas I would try to do stuff I would be in the kitchen trying to cook and I could hardly move I'd be leaning over the kitchen sink and screaming with pain and if he had to cook his way of cooking his I'll just buy food that's my way of cooking so I would try to sit in the vehicle if I had to come out of the vehicle I couldn't get out on my own I needed help to sit in the vehicle I needed help to go up the stairs I needed help everything I had to do I needed help but we I didn't give up on God I kept trusting God and saying Lord why is this happening I don't understand but then I said you know what Lord you created this body so because you created this body you are able to fix this body or we've been treating twice a week by the doctor every week every week sometimes I really did not even want to go you know and it got to the point where the doctor said this is so bad you'll never get better not even God could help you when he said that he hurt my mouth and healed brother John I'm smart and I was like never I said God is more than able I have experienced them before and you'll do what I get he said no no but let me retry I said no God is able so my husband had to give him a long letter lecture I thought he was going to preach to the doctor that morning you know and you know what is amazing after that that same doctor two weeks after called us and he said would you keep my in-law in prayer she's very ill the same Doctor Who said not even God can help you called us for prayer I was like wow he said okay we need to send you to this surgeon no surgery I said Lord I don't want to do any surgery because three years ago when I had this surgery it was a really bad experience I stopped reading and I'm alive today because of difficult because of the goodness of God so I said I don't want to do that alone that is not an option for me and I keep talking to God in my heart praying the Lord will bring songs that comfort me and stuff like that anyways we went to the sir General he said this is just for a consultation the first visit said okay when I when we got there she was a she was ready to put needles into my spine I said no so she looked at me she was not too happy I said I'm not doing that I'm not prepared to do that today he tried to convince us you know that we should do it you know it is going to help so brother Jaya Master well then what are the benefits of doing that she said well she went like um he said how long does that last does that take the pain away she said there's no guarantee people have died from it people were paralyzed from it he said would that touch bone when you go in that deep into her spine she said well there's no guarantee it would not and I'm just listening to her and I'm saying Lord I'm not doing that she got to be crazy I'm not doing this in my mind okay and I'm having a conversation with going in my mind I was like I'm not doing this Lord so she said let's schedule another appointment for next week you'll do it next week I said I'll think about it when I left there I said Lord is this something you want me to do I said if it is Lord it is very scary but if it's something you want to take me to I'll do it if it is not I'm not doing it we went back the next week she was ready to do the same thing this one was a little different where they go further into your spine said let's see the procedure room so I look at the procedure room no problem he said he was not going to look at it then she brought in other people to convince us that we should do this I said I'm still not doing this today she looked at me like you must be crazy I was like no I I'm still not prepared so brother John said listen okay we'll talk to the surgeon since they insisted we'll talk to the surgeon let's hear what he have to say and so we'll decide from there well of course they did not want us to see the surgeon write her because she insisted that I do a series of injections into my spine about three different types each going further into your spine but of course she said it would only last for one day so we said met with the surgeon and I totally Lord that morning and I was really nervous I said Lord I don't want to do this I don't want to go there today I wish I did not have to go there today I said do you have any Christian doctors out there I said I have not seen one yet with this whole situation a better time said we go in we're going to listen to what you have to say of course he asks us questions and the first doctor she had someone from her staff with these surgeons standing in the back maybe just to hear what you have to say or whatever but I want to say thank God because I know everybody's been praying and when he had that last parameter with the brothers he came and he said he said we you know God did it that I believe God did it I said okay he said you should have heard how they cried out for you every day from that point he would be asking and I know these sisters were praying are you in pain no are you in pain in the next thing no I even did I was like you need to stop asking me if I'm in pain but till then to know I want to see God is good I stand heal completely heal in the name of Jesus [Applause] all the glory the under the praise be unto God when we met with that surgeon the doctor actually did not even take the MRI discs and look at them I said don't you want to see them she said no no that won't be necessary I have the report I have people to look at so we were confused by that we said well but you could look at this you know decision said can I see the disc we gave it to him when he came in they said he's a tough man from what I understood he was the nicest nicest man I said he have to know Jesus the way he presented himself the way he spoke and he was like did you do any of the injections I said no he went like so the guy was standing back maybe he didn't want the other guy from the doctors or first doctor's office to see that was his hint to me not to do that he said oh and brother jerem asked him did you see this he said yes he said you know what you're going to live there's no need for surgery I don't see any need for surgery yet I don't know this that I had was the same report they gave in people but I guess it was not corresponding anymore whatever God did All To His glory but I want to say this to also the Lord reminded me of a dream that he gave me I know with all the prayer going up I heard in my dream you will see a miracle and I want to thank God [Applause] God bless you um I'm so happy to be here thank you brother Jack for having us and his brothers I mean you all just amazed and I we love you all thank you so much every time you call my wife and it's just amazing historical and different ones you all know who you are and well I'm so grateful every time we come through those doors or we meet any one of you all on the outside they love you show to her you know uh coming through that they smile I look at all these sisters who look at her and with this smile and it's so welcoming and it's so beautiful to see that people can treat my wife like that you know and I appreciate that so much you know as a husband just like the Lord Jesus when we heard he heard somebody you know and when my wife heard I heard and I appreciate these sisters on a Tuesday night you can't get a hold of her when she has the time she's in that room locked up with Jesus she says I want to invite you all on the night when Jesus says prayer trying to make it if you can and this is the first time I'm standing in front of you all here but I'm the one to think nothing for no one to feel but I'm telling you the blessing that I received from these brothers these brothers and them I mean they could pray that that's all I get said because I was kind of skeptical going on it but being there you know what brother Solomon said on that prayer brother Jack and all of us was praying brother Branham said it but brother Solomon said it before the doctor gonna put an injection on your wife's body should be healed and those are the exact thing that happened there was the doctor gave up painkillers she have not take one no no think about them look at the God we serve from surgery to not taking up painkiller that is the God we serve and and we just I just love him you know when Brian said that uh the most powerful thing you have on Earth see it's not an atomic bomb it's a Believer who is in direct contact with God think about that we don't have to take a phone and calls we could just think it and God know it and that's how much you love us you know that's how much he words can't say my wife already take all the time but um but but I love her I want to tell you all that you're about a good wife hold on prayer yes and God blessed me with that beautiful wife I mean I I can ask you not I don't deserve her foreign if you sing every Sunday I will try to be every Sunday to say you could oh my God every time you sing beat here or reference my wife has come home jumping and and she just love your singing and that we love you all we appreciate your God bless you sorry I won't take too much time I just forgot this part and I just wanted to share it you know what did that first surgeon had said she said we'll put your under and then we'll wake you up during the procedure and we're gonna stick she showed me the size of the needle it was very intimidating we're gonna put this into your spine and we're gonna wake you up and test the pain level then we're going to put your back under and wake you back up again and do the same thing in three different places and whichever one has the most pain then we'll do the final surgery and they would remove the two major discs in my back and maybe fabricate something but I want to thank what I never had to do that foreign [Applause] [Music] praise the Lord amen God bless you both amen sometimes we we just want the Lord to increase our faith when we're in we're in trouble and you know you're looking to hear the voice of God turn it down just a little bit you're looking to hear the voice of God and all of a sudden Satan to say something like your God can't do this and what he failed to realize is something is stirred up in you your faith get muscles in you my God can do anything you talking about my dad praise the Lord so sometimes when you're going through looking to hear from God Satan's gonna say something you just take that This Means War praise the Lord amen uh I just asked brother Jack if you can come on at this time my brother [Music] praise the Lord man uh certainly appreciate the testimony from Sister Olivia

enter into the time of prayer and I want to say that this this whole prayer thing started with uh a burden that my my wife had in her heart and um she mentioned it to me and you know and and she would want just invite the sisters to get together and just pray about things and I want to say that's been over eight nine years ago and uh she she asked me just to uh you know could they get together and

other Tuesday night we took the sisters do first and third Brothers do second and fourth but we get in there and we just pray about different things and God is God has certainly been answering our prayer so we're grateful for that this Friday is First Friday of the month and uh typically first Friday month we always have a tape that we encourage uh everybody to listen to a man whether in your home or wherever but take Friday and try to listen to the tape and it's a hidden life in Christ this is the date 55 uh I guess it's 0 11 there must be something missing there on that date uh but uh it's hidden life in Chrysler to be in November of 55. all right uh don't forget your the time is changing this Saturday and we go back one hour we fall back so we will be looking forward to that also our upcoming meetings we have have um December 2nd through 4th Sarasota brother Stephen will be ministering I'm sorry at his church I forget who the brother Craig Brewer I believe is the minister but

service and uh just we come from a mighty long way come from a long way we're still here still doing the same thing we always been doing amen happy body happy about it that's just such a timely thing there uh this morning just ties right into the message that the Lord just kind of laid on my heart and uh believe it or not just this morning I just thought about calling my other sister just wanted to invite her to church just come on out the church not knowing that Gina was going to be here so uh God is good God is good brother Jack and Brother Willie and I was went away last week a couple

serve we better go ahead and get a scripture because I feel him coming real quickly here uh I want to just get this scripture out of the way if we turn in our Bibles and I look you know we don't have a whole lot of room here so I'm gonna try not to disrupt things y'all pray for me uh Second Kings the seventh chapter we'll be starting at the first verse now I have been going back and forth with the title of this message and I had I was speaking to my wife a couple nights ago and I I had it then I lost it and I asked her said did you remember what I said she said no I don't remember I said okay I will just go back to what I had all alone but it was just this morning I prayed I said well Lord I'ma just leave it open you give it to me at the last minute and he just did okay amen we're going to read uh from this first verse of uh Second Kings the seventh chapter then Elijah said hear ye the word of the Lord thus saith the Lord tomorrow about this time shall a measure a fine flower be sold and a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel in the gate of Samaria then it then a lord whose hand then a lord on Whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God and said behold if the Lord would make Windows in heaven might this thing be and he said behold Thou shalt see it with thine eyes but shalt not eat thereof and there were four lepers men at the entering of the gate and they said one to another why sit we here until we die and I want to move on down to the eighth verse and then the lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp they went into the tent and did eat and drink and carry this for silver gold and Raymond and went and hit it and came again and entered into another tent and carried dents also and went and hit it may the Lord at it blessing to the reading of his words you may be seated uh for a while amen um I want to read another quote here in the message the end time C sign is going to be uh paragraph 44. uh now speaking six hours on that subject and tonight going back again to the same end time seed sign now all wise people if he's all right in his head he's always trying to find out what's ahead of him all of us want to know that what's the next move shall I make where do I go from here it's like a man crossing a stream he steps on a rock and he looks around to see where his next step shall be for he doesn't he just can't just jump anywhere and if he does he'll drown himself he must Swatch where he go after I cross this then where all of us are that way that's been The Cry of the human race down Through the Ages where from here I'd like to title this message as I say why sit ye here until we die and as an inspiration where do we go from here amen let us by our heads most gracious Heavenly Father Lord I pray dear father day uh you have placed this message in my heart you have ordained this day this very time lord it's it's hard to kind of Choke back the emotions O Lord seeing that it's so late in the hour Lord and uh Lord and the world is just falling apart Lord we ask you O Father God to speak to the hearts of the people Lord those that are present here in the building those that are online Lord hide me behind the cross so father God that only you are seen Lord speak to the hearts of the people we commit this service into your hand we bind the enemy everything that he might try to do in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen I want to amen begin amen this thought uh received the scripture here of uh where the the king amen uh he learned an answer that there was a a a a a a famine amen that caused uh trouble in the land and we find that a lot of times in the scripture when God want to get people to move a man he he allows a famine to take place amen and the mess in in the scripture there in Amos I think it's Amos for he said in this day that there is a famine there'll be a famine not for bread not for water but a famine for the word of God amen so uh to those that are hungry there should be a search amen for food in this hour amen we want to uh if you go with me to Luke the 15th chapter and unless uh take our message starting from near we'll see it kind of tie together here man Amen in Luke 15 11 says here Ace certain man had two sons and the younger of them said to his father give me the portion of goods that falleth to me and he divided unto them his living and not many days after the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with riotous living and when he had spent all their a rose here we go a mighty famine in the land and he began to be in want and he went and joined himself to a citizen of another country and he sent him into the fields to feed with the swine now let's let's let's just hold right there we see this this story of popular story called The Prodigal Son now it's called The Prodigal Son but it's a story about two sons I I I'm on a uh uh bring to you today to show you a man that that that that that that there is a revelation in that the first son and the same son is the same son Stay With Me I want to show you here Let's uh I don't want to get ahead of myself I want you to take let's go back to job the first chapter and and we're gonna we're gonna work with this a little bit so bear with me I I I want to build a bridge so that you can get to where I'm at amen now there was a day when the sons of God came to the to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came or Saint came also among them and this lord said unto Satan which cometh Style then Satan answered the Lord and said from going to and from the earth and and from walking up and down it and the Lord said unto Satan has thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in Earth a perfect and an upright man and one that fears God and assures evil then Satan answered and he said doeth job fear God not fear not has Thou made a hedge about him and about his house and about all that he has on every side thou has blessed the work of his hands and his substance in increase in land so we know the story amen uh God gave him he said he can go home but his soul belongs to me amen uh now we see here we're going to go back to Genesis and we see that in job here I'm sorry in job here he was talking about his sons that went to the presence of the Lord and here in in in in in in in in in in Luke Jesus was talking about amen this man that had two sons speaking about the one song that wanted all of his inheritance and uh uh wanted to go his own way now let's go we see in Genesis God amen came down and uh he desired to have a son but before amen he can do that he had to prepare a place uh there's a message here the prophet said I don't I hope I don't make myself sacrilegious by calling God Papa but I want to say in that way so you'll understand it Papa wanted some children now I'm gonna tie this thing down so y'all don't think I just done lost my mind so what he did he said let there be angels and there came around him he said oh that's fine they worshiped him then he was God but you have to understand he just he he he would want it to be worshiped as God but he had attributes that he wanted to display amen he wanted to be a savior he wanted to be a Healer but he had no one to save and he had no one to heal to display his glory to reveal who he who he really is on the inside you find when a man amen has uh children has a wife he wants to be their hero yeah he wants to show a man that I got you nothing to worry about I'm going to take care of everything you don't have to worry amen I got you now we see that remember he was Elohim the self-existing one nothing but him the first thing came around was the angels and the angels could do no more than worship but they couldn't be lost they couldn't be sick they were Immortal beings so he couldn't display all of his healing power and attributes so we know the story there in Genesis where they came long and God created this beautiful kingdom amen he created this beautiful place there amen for his children amen I want to get to a place here where I can bring you right up and show you what I'm talking about here now he he he he he he built the kingdom amen so what happened is amen they begin we see that through uh the serpent amen through Eve uh uh there was a fallen away amen we know the story they they sinned against God amen and and and and and and and and uh some things happen amen so they they lost their inheritance so this directly coincides a man with Luke uh uh when the the son who had it all who had everything there in the garden this son asked to say give me my portion amen that I may go when riotous living so we see here in Genesis that you know he didn't ask for it but the same thing happened amen so it started out Amen in a place there he had nothing to worry about Papa God had everything under control amen he had his inheritance but he wanted to he didn't want to but circumstances God already knew a man that that this would happen yeah now he had lost where he once was now what I want to get you to understand is that son that prodigal son is you and I because we lost our inheritance but we see that that that that that that that God Amen had already had a plan to redeem us back into the kingdom back to our inheritance so we see this Prodigal Son amen being you and I amen now now stay with me now we're we're we're here also in Genesis where the son that was a fallen away amen but God never stopped loving his son amen he had already made a way for him to come back home God had already made a way because you see you have to understand that in the see before God created all of that there was a thought in his mind and the thought became word and then the thought the word became a manifestation so the thought that he had in his mind amen was you and I oh the thought that he had in his mind amen was his great family of God he had a desire amen not only to be worshiped but he had a desire for his attributes to be displayed and his children and his children now no doubt this uh prodigal son his father had the same desires to see his attributes and and his things passed on to his son but this younger son uh uh he had other ideas just like children have today sometimes you you you you just can't uh you try to tell them things and and they want to go their own way I want to experience it for myself so we see Adam and Eve begin to experience some things for themselves they uh Adam had to work by the sweat of his brow Eve had to suffer in childbirth amen and the Earth uh was cursed no more amen did we have the ease of planting there was thorns and thistles and and and and and and the Earth began to to to it wasn't what it was I should let me say that all because of sin so this young Rue not say young rule I'm sorry this Prodigal Son when and he began to go his way uh I want to tie job and say man that is born of a woman is born of a few days and it's full of trouble now we go back here amen we look at this Prodigal Son we see that he gathered and he went on a far Journey the Bible says and he wasted his substance on righteous Living God had given him certain gifts talents that he was supposed to use a man for the kingdom of God but he went away and he began to waste these gifts amen and do these type of things amen for the world and we see that he joined himself to a citizen of another country and begin to feed on the swine you see you can get to a point where you won't listen and you get off the word and you begin to feed on things on on unfamiliar Foods now what happens then is you get sick you you you you you you you you get things uh certain diseases began to creep into the body from a poor diet one of those things is is is is a spiritual amnesia spiritual Amnesia begins to to creep in first the body begins to break down and then the Mind follows you begin to forget who you are amen you think you're one of them but you're a citizen of another kingdom we see here that this prodigal son had gotten to a place where he forgot who he was all that his mother and his father had put into him amen he just pushed it to the side I'm not going to say he forgot it because let me tell you something you have to fight over it to do everything that you want to do but that voice in the back of your head doesn't go anywhere the train up a child the way he should go and in the end he will not depart so many of us even now I started out talking about our children they're just like this Prodigal Son but I want to tell you something about this Prodigal Son there came a famine there came a problem and he found himself into a point where he was out there feeding with the swine now you have to understand this this was a Jewish fellow yeah all right [Music] they wasn't supposed to have nothing to do with no oink oink nothing to do with no Pig and he out there not only is he taking care of pig he out there eating with the pig how far will the devil take you when you walk away from his word foreign but the story ain't over you got he got down so low but something happened [Music] it says there that uh uh he fed with this wine and he would feign have filled his belly with husk that the swine didn't eat that no man gave unto him he had lost all his money lost all his friends lost all his prestige and you know what I say to that glory to God Got Away of running you back home [Music] I don't care how far you go I don't care how I grown You Think You Are God got a way of running you back home now I want to bring out something here The Father didn't go chasing him the mother didn't go running him and saying son would you please come back to the Lord would you please come back home you've grown enough to do what you want to do you grown enough to go out there you're gonna have to be grown enough to get back amen amen you see I'm not going to get in God's way because you have to make that Journey all right the farther you go in sin and and debauchery and riots is living that much further you're going to have to come back you went out there into the world and he went over mountains and in valleys and crossed rivers and all kind of things and found himself in another country now when you come to yourself and you begin to say Lord why am I even out here you're gonna have to come back over that mountain you're going to have to come back through that same Valley you're going to have to come back through that River to get back to golf [Music] I'm not coming to help you you went out there you get back [Music] amen now we want to bring out some things here we see that this product this prodigal son amen something happened and he came to himself he began to remember all of the lessons that he taught that he was taught in Sunday School things begin to come back you see because amen he there was something placed on the inside of him amen that told him that who he was he might have tried to ignore it he might have tried to press it down but let me tell you something when you get to a point and you're sick yeah that's right sister you get sick and tired of being sick and tired you begin to say I want to go home my father amen God's service living better than this when you get tired of the devil amen whipping you amen you begin to go back to your roots you begin to start searching Lord I didn't start like this I wasn't raised this way why am I out here I don't have to be living this way well I need to make my way back home thank you well let me tell you something let me tell you something that devil ain't gonna make it easy especially after how far you win you begin to think in your mind oh I did this person this way oh I did that person that way I talked about uh the church I said all kind of stuff on Facebook y'all don't hear me I've done all kind of things oh Lord how am I gonna have to go back and have to face those people how am I gonna go back and face the wrongs that I committed but you got to make your way back home you got to lay aside every sin and weight you got to lay it aside something has to happen on the inside of you amen that give you that I'm just saying I don't care what I have to go through I'm going back home but let me tell you something you can make it why amen because you're not on your own amen because there was something placed down in you amen from the for the foundation of the world Amen that is pulling you back home amen you think that that that that you're making a decision no I feel the pull you begin to feel the pull and no matter how hard it is no matter how far you've come amen no doubt his father and mother was back home praying amen and every time he lay down and close his eyes those prayers going forth amen and he began to feel the pool yeah I got to make it back home Hallelujah now this is the same thing amen when Adam and Eve fell in the garden amen we see that that that that the children of God Amen had lost their inheritance they had lost their place amen and they began to live to to waste their inheritance on riotous living I know yeah let me calm down and get back to these notes I want you to understand here that all scripture has compound meaning the prophet said that it has compound meaning and it runs in Cycles this is the way I can tie this story in Luke all the way back to Genesis because it runs in Cycles the cycle of time swings back every so often he says history repeats itself and scripture repeats itself down Through the Ages and I want I'll go from a literal standpoint to a spiritual standpoint amen bear with me now we see here that uh there was a promise amen that Drew nine and God raised up a man by the name of Moses and notice a very real type was given to us to the promised land Christ now we have a promise cause our promise is a spiritual rest I want you to keep in mind that uh that prodigal son at the time he had found no rest but he was tired of being sick and tired and he wanted some rest and he wanted peace in his life and he began to remember I had rest and peace back home amen so this young prodigal son uh our for the sake of dramatization I'll name her Israel name him Israel so God had to send the deliverer amen by the name of Moses down to a a free Israel from bondage amen and uh uh uh now we see that Israel down through the land they came amen through bondage and delivered and they began to make their Journey Back Home amen and they uh went through the desert and God brought them through a Red Sea amen only to find themselves at another place where do we go from here Where Do We Go From Here you see down through your life you may come over different hurdles and on your way back to God Amen that's what's called the the the seed and the wheat but there's a husk around it you had your time you come through certain things amen you you you were one time in denomination and you will at one time amen you was in this and at one time you may have been in that but you get to a point in everybody's life you have the question where do I go from here [Music] I see these children of Israel they would come to a place they seen the great Miracles God had brought them from a mighty long way but I'm telling you they get to that point there and they say well Moses Where Do We Go From Here both and sages follow me as I follow him Now The Story Goes On that they find themselves at a place it took him a while to get there they wandered in the desert wandered and wandered amen and they found them Place had a decision barnia and that was a place of decision they had journeyed from a long way and they found themselves in a place where they now we have to make a decision and no doubt amen it was a very hard decision now I'm comparing to this Prodigal Son this prodigal son had to make a decision why should be here until I die he had to rise up amen and begin to start movement he had to go back let me read something here let me read something here this prodigal son he said I will rise and go to my father see he made a decision there come a time in your life where you got to make a decision you can't sit there and continue in your sins all you would die in your sins why seek ye here until we die there come a place where you have to make a stand you have to stand for something or you'll fall for anything amen so this prodigal son he said I'm going and I will say to my father I have sinned against heaven and I have and before thee so we see that that son said to his father he had a repentant heart he came and he began in his mind he said Lord Lord I'm sorry I got myself in this condition I'm out here and I'm breaking all of the rules and I'm breaking the laws and I have disappointed heaven and my father but Lord God I'm going home I'm going home I have sinned against heaven and before thee and I am no more worthy to be called son make me one of the highest servants you see what happened he don't got spiritual Amnesia see because you can never be a servant because you was born a son he had lost his identity he didn't even know who he was anymore he didn't know who he was anymore make me one of thy hired servants and he began he says I'm no more worthy amen that was a Godless sorrow amen you see first before you come back amen first there has to be a Godless sorry you have to be Godless sorry for your sins amen and then you just got down to your knees amen come to the altar find somebody a man of God and say I want to turn my life around amen we see that this Rich I'm sorry this Prodigal Son amen he had been converted but see because converted means that you're going to make a 180. he turned around and he began to making steps to find his way back home but before he made a move he repented before God he said Lord I'm sorry Lord I sinned against heaven and I've sinned against you Lord God help me get back home help me get back home and that's all he had to say now the journey is going to be difficult but you said the magic word Lord I'm sorry Lord forgive me and help me get back home so they come to a place here Israel and conditioner amen and they they they had to go over now I wanna bring something out here amen and did you notice Moses the great miracle worker that brought down Israel down through the land and brought them up to the promised land but did not Place their inheritance he did not give them their inheritance he led them up to the land but Joshua divided the land to the people is that right and Christ brought the church to the place where their possession was made and he gave them just the Jordan to cross but the holy spirit is one who sets the church in order Joshua today puts the church in its order giving each one gifts places position he is the voice of God through the inner man that Christ has saved the Holy Spirit now do you get that much now we're getting over into the book of Ephesians now he's positionally placing the church belonging now Joshua placed them in the natural land now the holy spirit is placing the church positionally in the land spiritually Hallelujah I I I have to draw the comparison so that you will understand amen that the story is still vital today it's still relevant right now amen we we we we want to get back the prodigal son is trying to get back Amen to home amen but he has squandered away all his inheritance and I want you to notice that when Adam and Eve fell in the garden they lost their inheritance amen but we're going Amen to a place amen where we can get our inheritance back amen now stay with me now we see this Prodigal Son he repented but that wasn't it amen he made his way making his way back home but before he got home his father ran out to meet him the let's read a little bit he says I will rise and I'll go to my father and we'll say unto him Heaven present him I've sinned against heaven and before thee and I'm no more worried that just because son make me as one of the high servants and he rose and came to his father but when he was yet a great way off his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck oh my all you have to do is make a decision repent before God and begin making your way back home amen God will carry you the rest of the way before he got all the way home his father ran out to meet him amen and hugged him on his neck kissed him and let him know that I'm not mad at you the father didn't say hey son where's my money he wasn't worried about the money he said my son who was once dead is now alive kill the fattest cow servants bring me out a ring amen and a row now first we have to remind him because my son's sick he's got amnesia I'm gonna put this ring on his finger and every time he look at this ring he knows I'm the son of almighty God I am not a servant amen I belong to my father that ring signifies his identification not not only he put him on a road he's saying you're dressing like the world son I gotta take that off of you I gotta put you on the right of time I got a sanctifier so you're set aside for service I can't have you going in like this because you was once a son always a son you are leader before the people [Music] so I gotta clean you up I gotta clean you up now he put him on the road put some shoes on his feet made him looks hot like something hey man begin to change them now see he's repented and then along the way now he's been sanctified he's been cleaned up and he's ready to do the father's bidding now I but I got to do nice feed you I gotta feed you from the bleeding bloody lamb see you've been out there eating that old swine and you're you're messed up in your mind you don't mean to eat from Heart Diet let me let me let me slow down here cause see the other son kind of told a little more of the story the other side said he out dealt with them harlots John that's where I just lived no other son described it say he out there now you know what he doing you know what he done out there with them Harleys and see the prophet told us that those harlots amen was those denominational churches amen because that Catholic is the great and they are the Harless you left the word and you went feeding all denominational food you went laying with those harlots found yourself joined up in another country and I forgot who you are amen so I said I'll bring you the fatted calf I got to feed you the bleeding bloody word of God to build up your strength you've been on a long journey you've been through a lot but I gotta get you to a point now amen where you can handle some things right now your mind ain't right yet spiritually you're sick you can't handle nothing but just steal my son you got the ring on your finger the robe on your clothes but sit here under this word for a while I gotta feed you this bleeding bloody lamb so we see amen it's the same thing for us today we've drifted so far from God all have seen and come short we were all the Prodigal Son and we had to come back home the same place and I remember I'm talking about a spiritual location back then the examples and The Parables is a natural but put on your spiritual thinking you had to make your way back home now I asked the question where do we go from here now that question is relevant to everybody in the building you may uh be like The Prodigal Son amen eating the swine with the swine you may not understand who you are you may be lost and sick and tired of being sick and tired but you stand up and say well where do I go from here do I sit here until I die hey man so you have to make a decision this morning hey man some of us have we come from a mighty long way amen we we've been uh we've come through the nomination and and things of that nature and and and and it was good it was good we enjoyed ourselves but God has brought us a little closer we probably joined up there I'm telling my own testimony to another denomination amen a church that was just a little bit more down in the business amen back in the first church that we belonged to it was all about playing and everything else I didn't know God from from from from nothing but we went to church sung in the choir and that was about it I love him but I tell you he I used to tease him all the time say uncle I love you but you can't preach your way out of a wet paper bag but you know what he has gotten better food with him if you want to he thought he got better and I appreciate him you know why because he started me out the right way even when I went her straight he would call me and say guess where I'm going this morning I say well the church and then he would say where you going I say Ark I love you but I'm not coming to your church [Music] can't eat that but I love you not I don't think I don't love you and I'm praying for you Lord have mercy so we go on in this prodigal son amen he had to be fed amen he had to come back home and now we we we we switch to the other side the other son amen let's let's take it a little further here let's continue to read amen and he arose and the son said unto him father I've sinned against Steve in the sight of God and no more worthy to be son but the father said unto him bring the best robe and a ring on his hand shoes on the streets and bring the calf and kill it and let us eat and be married for this son was dead and now alive he was lost and is not found and they begin to be merry amen now the Elder son was in the field and has came and Drew Nye into the house he heard music and dancing and he called one of his servants and asked these servants and and asked the what these things meant and he said unto that he said unto him thy brother is come and my father has killed the fatted calf because he has received him safe and sound and we see that this older son got angry and would not go go into the celebration yeah not a father come amen but let's hold on right there we see the story here of the two sons one went off and wasted his inheritance on riotous living but he came back he came to himself he made the Journey Back Home he came through repent he repented sanctification and now to be placed in that land to receive the inheritance is a type of the Holy Ghost amen so he was justified sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost so when you justify it's just as you've never done it in the first place just as you've never done it in the first place so now we go to the second son he said I've been here all along I didn't do nothing but where do I go from here now I want to mind you that I'm saying the first son is the second son because his sins were forgiven he is back where he was he never done it in the first place however where do we go from here he began to get a little bit beside himself well I'm somebody I've I've been here all along and this person did this and this person did that and the scripture tell us that he was angry and would not go in hey son you got some Journey in to do yourself the journey is not over amen the journey is not over amen we'll read here amen I wanna let's see here amen amen we see in the message amen adoption the prophet was saying how amen go to uh adoption two I believe is paragraph 54. my mama amen now we'll we'll go on bear with me I'm just gonna gonna just let it run here we see that a lot of times we we we come back home and and and and and and and and we're coming to church now the Battle Is Not Over we see amen that the children of Israel they crossed over amen and they had to fight for every Instagram amen that they were to possess Ed amen but they were in their land that God had gave them for an inheritance amen and I want you to know at this morning you are in that land for your inheritance now let me put it this way someone in that land and some are not because we are all at different points of the journey and the question is where do we go from here that is an individual question to each and every one of us this morning where do I go from here because I still have a long way to go amen you brought me from a mighty long way but I still in the journey I want you to understand that we're gonna fight amen until we get out of this flesh body we're going to continue to fight amen until we leave here amen so once we'll get to that point amen God and we received the Holy Ghost he gives us a tutor Amen in Ephesians he gives us a tutor because now we have to overcome some other things amen but especially depending on how far you went out into that world Amen you could have been like the prodigal son and never went out into the world I'm talking about that second one that stayed home you still got to overcome you know so don't get high and mighty on yourself and get to thanking you somebody popping your collar and going on you still got work to do don't stay stay humble because God I'm still a prodigal son amen because of the fall in the beginning amen I'm I'm still in sinful flesh amen so I'm still on the journey amen is still taking off things of the world that might have attached itself to me it might be jealousy it might be envy it might be bitterness it might be gossiping it might be uh uh uh come on but I'm saved Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost but you gotta be still pull off the world you gotta lay aside everywhere as you get closer Amen to that to God you continue to pull off Lord I'm naked before you there's nothing else holy Lord you take over lord use me amen you begin to Rejoice with your brother I don't care what he did I don't care what he been through you let go that terrible attitude of yours you need a refilling you need to come back to the altar you need to repent that terrible attitude know what you got a long way to go hey man the church is supposed to be a safe haven God is doing the judging amen you're just supposed to amen uh display his attributes amen he wanted a flesh body to display his attributes so now you've come back from a mighty Long Way amen he got you in a place now where you're cleaned up and set aside for service now your job is to display amen because the the work is not over amen the job is not done amen now you have to go to work for the kingdom but it's not in your way amen you have to display his attributes so you have to continue to die continue to shed you amen and we the devil is hey you want to talk about somebody in the church you should fall down your knee anytime the devil put on your mind to say something negative about one of your brothers or sisters you should stop and pray for them cause it's hard to talk about somebody that you're praying for it yeah [Music] now listen we dividing up the inheritance we are in the land but we still gotta fight but I want you to go home and go in your bathroom and look in that square picture frame and see who the enemy is [Music] you have to die to yourself you have to die to your ways and a lot of times hey man the man of God is God you don't you realize God uses me and feel it you know how hard it is to find a man filled with the Holy Ghost that has the hand of God on his life to preach the gospel to you I challenge you to find 10 in Florida I challenge you hello whatever and when God uses the man of God and speak directly into your situation you toot your nose up did you hear what he said we are not children anymore we're not playing Church this is real we're in the land and it's those kind of things yeah Aiken go and get those Babylonian garments setting that wedge and hide it in your heart against your brother and sister and stop the church from moving and God is going to hold you responsible amen amen we praying every week crying out to God children need Faith people's sake need healing and you stuck on yourself Talking against the man of God and he did this and won't do that and this that and the other [Music] I'm just your deacon you shooting your own self in the foot you right you I've been that's the problem right brother you know we ain't playing Church the same thing he did I just read it he gave Joshua type of the Holy Spirit to place in position living place in the land but we want to get all over at our place I do it this way I wouldn't want to do it that way I don't think you should have did it like that I didn't did it like that you wouldn't have done nothing I'm chill quarterback [Music] sit back you're not even in the heat of the fire that's right you're not even feeling no pressure you know the quarterback he get down there and he hiked the ball and and this the quarterback usually is not a really big guy man he's probably a couple 200 pounds or so and you got this 350 pound guy bench press Buicks eat metal and run a full flat coming at you one on this side one on that side and he had to make a decision to get the ball to the person that need to get the ball to you sit back and say I wouldn't have done it like that and they got no pressure [Music] no pressure knowing that if he makes the wrong decision somebody gonna get hurt you know if you got that that guy going across the middle and you make the decision to put him that safety sitting back there ready to clean his clock and you set that man up like that that's why oh have mercy you need to a pastor I'm sorry y'all God placed in the church positionally placed and it's not every day you got that you find a man of God amen you realize how hard that is to find that is yielded to the Holy Spirit that is praying that has the compassion he has all of the tools because God placed it in them and and and and and and and and and and tooted it up tooted it up and we sit back and we say well what would he do well he was still under the total he may not be there anymore you pray for him [Music] the other ministers I'm a new preacher [Music] and I didn't realize

still a son and you pray for them lift one another I'm talking about that second son see these are the things he needed to understand [Music] he needed to pull off something so that second son is really the first sign still on the chair and I say we where do we go from here where are we at we've come from a mighty long way but where do we go from here amen I want you to go to oh my I think it's a Luke 12. go to Luke 12. hey man are we getting ready to bring it to a close my God Luke 12 Jesus 27th verse Luke 12-27 first amen he said consider the lilies how they grow they toil not they spin and yet I say unto you that Solomon in all his glory was not a raid like quantity see that Lily had to press its way it was a seed down in the muck and in the Murray down amen in the pits of despair down amen at the bottom of putrid polluted disgusting Lake but it was still a lily but it had to go down and be buried and it had to rot it had to shed its old skin it had to shed its old husk but the journey wasn't over it had to push its way it had to push its way up through all of the slime amen through all of the filth amen it had to continue to put I don't care how hard it got he said consider the Lily and how it grow it pushes its way up it pushes us with you excuse me one minute that Lily push his way through the miracle and I say to you this morning keep pressing up with little
