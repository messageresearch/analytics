[58:36] no better place to be than here in the

[58:47] musicians appreciate you all on today a
[58:50] man just appreciate the Lord Jesus this
[58:55] wonderful Easter weekend Lord and Savior
[59:06] for his great sacrifice man he did their
[59:14] Calvary the Lord did that thing we're so
[59:27] grateful and then for him praise the
[59:31] Lord
[59:32] you all would just turn with me amen in
[59:35] your Bibles to Luke 24 so good to see
[59:38] everybody in the house of Lord amen
[59:41] that's more than Luke 24
[59:59] Luke 24 and I'll just read a man first
[1:00:06] twelve verses here this scripture speaks
[1:00:12] of the resurrection and we we just want
[1:00:17] to try to talk a little bit about that
[1:00:20] on today certainly it's a common thing
[1:00:23] for people to talk about the
[1:00:25] resurrection on Easter and sometimes I'm
[1:00:28] not a traditionalist but sometimes I
[1:00:31] like to try to you know do the best I
[1:00:33] can to get into the channel a man
[1:00:36] because I know folk come to church they
[1:00:37] want to get it Easter sermon but you can
[1:00:41] never talk enough about what our Lord
[1:00:45] did a man I mean if we came every Sunday
[1:00:49] and heard that it to be an to be
[1:00:51] glorious a man so we certainly thank him
[1:00:54] for that but let's let's read here in
[1:00:58] Luke 24 it says now upon the first day
[1:01:01] of the week very early in the morning
[1:01:05] that came unto the sepulchre bringing
[1:01:10] the spices which they had prepared and
[1:01:13] certain others with them and they found
[1:01:16] the stone rolled away from the sepulchre
[1:01:20] and they entered in and found not the
[1:01:23] body of the Lord Jesus that that
[1:01:27] scripture means a little bit more to me
[1:01:29] because I saw I went inside and he's not
[1:01:33] there and I'm grateful for that since
[1:01:36] they the internet and found not the body
[1:01:38] of the Lord Jesus and it came to pass as
[1:01:40] they were much perplexed thereabout
[1:01:43] behold two men stood by them in shining
[1:01:47] garments a man loved the scripture that
[1:01:50] proves that angels were men some of them
[1:01:54] were men some also had wings a cherubim
[1:01:57] Seraphim and all that but says then as
[1:01:59] they were afraid and and bowed down
[1:02:02] their faces to the earth they said unto
[1:02:04] them why seek ye the living among the
[1:02:08] dead
[1:02:09] he is not here but it's risen remember
[1:02:15] how he's speakin to you when he was yet
[1:02:17] in Galilee sing the Son of Man must be
[1:02:21] delivered into the hands of sinful men
[1:02:23] and be crucified and the third day rise
[1:02:28] again and they remembered his words
[1:02:32] return from the sepulchre and told all
[1:02:36] these things unto the eleven and to all
[1:02:38] the rest and it was Mary Magdalene and
[1:02:42] Joanna and Mary the mother of James and
[1:02:46] and other women that were with them
[1:02:49] which told these things unto the
[1:02:52] Apostles and their words seemed to them
[1:02:57] as idle tales and they believed them not
[1:03:01] then arose Peter and ran unto the
[1:03:04] sepulchre and stooping down he beheld
[1:03:07] the linen linen clothes lay by
[1:03:10] themselves and departed wandering and
[1:03:12] himself at that which was come to pass
[1:03:16] the Lord a blessing to the reading of
[1:03:19] his word let's just bow and a brief word
[1:03:21] of Prayer God we are grateful for
[1:03:26] Calvary we realized that had it not been
[1:03:30] for this great event we wouldn't be
[1:03:35] where we are today so we were grateful
[1:03:39] that we have the opportunity to stop and
[1:03:40] just reflect on what occurred there and
[1:03:44] as we would just enter into the word of
[1:03:48] the Lord we pray that the Holy Spirit
[1:03:50] would just help us to Lord just to
[1:03:53] capture this the essence of this and may
[1:03:57] we God just feel your spirit thank you
[1:04:00] for every person that's come into the
[1:04:02] house of Lord maybe there are others
[1:04:03] that would continue to come in as they
[1:04:05] come got me to stall here in a very very
[1:04:09] special way but you get all the glory
[1:04:12] all the honor and all the praise we take
[1:04:13] every spirit that is against the Spirit
[1:04:15] of God underneath the control of the
[1:04:17] Holy Ghost sin Jesus name we pray
[1:04:21] man you can be seated a man in the
[1:04:24] presence of the Lord a man we want to
[1:04:29] just take for our title today the third
[1:04:34] day a man the third day
[1:04:38] praise the Lord a man if you just just
[1:04:45] join me on this journey
[1:04:47] amen most of y'all that uh that for me
[1:04:51] with Christianity and you already know
[1:04:53] what happened on the third day you
[1:04:57] already know what happened and but it's
[1:05:01] a story that we can never get enough a
[1:05:04] man it's the greatest story that has
[1:05:08] ever been told and it still impacted
[1:05:11] lives as people a man of what occurred
[1:05:14] that third day I want to start by
[1:05:18] reading out of a sermon it is the rising
[1:05:21] of the Sun a man and let's just start
[1:05:27] here as the first light was ever given
[1:05:32] and the earth was God's spoken word a
[1:05:37] man the first light that ever struck the
[1:05:40] earth was God's spoken word he said let
[1:05:45] there be light and there was light
[1:05:49] that turned darkness into light and in
[1:05:53] order to bring forth a creation of joy
[1:05:56] and life upon the earth then the Spirit
[1:06:00] of God as it moved with love and
[1:06:03] compassion at that great day the first
[1:06:08] day of the dawn of creation upon the
[1:06:11] earth the Sun rose and swept across it's
[1:06:15] raised and dried up the waters from the
[1:06:18] earth and made an atmosphere above and
[1:06:20] and for its first time it was to bring
[1:06:24] joy and life to the earth by a seed that
[1:06:28] was a great hour now we're gonna go
[1:06:31] further in this a man and
[1:06:33] when God was there at creation there in
[1:06:36] Genesis 1
[1:06:37] they're very certain days unknown the
[1:06:39] second day of the third day a couple
[1:06:42] other days he would do something and
[1:06:44] then he would say that it was good right
[1:06:48] he make the comment you see him say it
[1:06:51] was good but I noticed as I went back
[1:06:54] and just began to read something on the
[1:06:57] sixth day when he made man I didn't see
[1:07:03] him say it was good and I wonder why God
[1:07:13] would not say on the day that man was
[1:07:16] created now there's a there's a couple
[1:07:18] reasons that you know I could I could
[1:07:20] give you a man 1 I would say to you that
[1:07:26] he didn't have to say it was good
[1:07:29] because man was made in His image right
[1:07:35] but another reason I could say that he
[1:07:38] didn't say it was good because he knew
[1:07:41] it was just getting started
[1:07:43] hallelujah there were some things get
[1:07:46] ready to happen a man and the things
[1:07:49] that were getting ready to happen are
[1:07:52] the things that created a need for a
[1:07:57] third day alright I hope y'all stay with
[1:08:02] me
[1:08:02] amen let's let's keep reading here
[1:08:04] alright
[1:08:06] and he says see here the the first the
[1:08:13] first day of the dawn of creation upon
[1:08:15] the earth the Sun rose has swept across
[1:08:16] it's raised and dried up the waters from
[1:08:18] the earth and made an atmosphere above
[1:08:20] and for its first time it was to bring
[1:08:24] joy and life to the earth by a sea that
[1:08:26] was a great hour but oh it was nothing
[1:08:30] it wasn't nothing that sunrise like the
[1:08:34] sunrise on that Easter morning this time
[1:08:38] with the Sun leaping into the skies it
[1:08:41] brought forth a greater sunrise than
[1:08:45] ever because it came
[1:08:47] greater news with this sunrise than it
[1:08:50] did with the sunrise at the beginning
[1:08:53] hallelujah and let me tell you something
[1:08:55] you haven't really experienced a sunrise
[1:08:59] until you've had the s o n arrives in
[1:09:03] your life glory to God say this sunrise
[1:09:08] brought a news that he is risen he is
[1:09:10] quicken from the dead as he promised
[1:09:13] he's risen from the dead the first time
[1:09:15] the Sun rose in Genesis it was bringing
[1:09:18] a message that there will be life upon
[1:09:22] the earth mortal life but this time when
[1:09:25] the Sun rose there was a dual Sun rising
[1:09:30] another sunrise in s o n rising it was
[1:09:35] not only s un rising it was the s o n
[1:09:38] had risen to bring eternal life to all
[1:09:41] God's promised seed that by
[1:09:43] foreknowledge he had seen laying upon
[1:09:46] the earth it says no more could the
[1:09:50] Botany life life live back there at the
[1:09:53] beginning without the S UN to bring it
[1:09:55] to life no more then today when the sons
[1:09:59] of God is upon the earth it takes the S
[1:10:02] o in light to bring them to life amen to
[1:10:07] eternal life and and that's what we're
[1:10:09] praying and hoping for that God would
[1:10:12] allow the Esso and light to shine today
[1:10:15] amen because Easter is not a tradition a
[1:10:19] man Easter goes beyond that a man Easter
[1:10:24] is something that we all should
[1:10:25] experience personally hallelujah we
[1:10:29] talked about on Friday night having your
[1:10:30] personal Calvary but I mean you also
[1:10:33] need to have your personal resurrection
[1:10:36] glory to God amen that's that's what
[1:10:39] Easter is all about he says so so when
[1:10:41] when sons of God was upon the earth that
[1:10:43] takes the S Oh in light to bring them to
[1:10:46] eternal life his chosen ones that he
[1:10:49] knew before the foundation of the world
[1:10:50] he had chosen them in himself before the
[1:10:53] foundation of world and on Easter
[1:10:55] morning
[1:10:55] then in this dirt somewhere laid our
[1:10:58] bodies at that time for we are the dust
[1:11:00] of your
[1:11:00] earth and in heaven there was a book of
[1:11:02] memory and his attributes was in was in
[1:11:06] him knowing that because this son of God
[1:11:09] raised he would also raise to life every
[1:11:13] son that was foreordained to this great
[1:11:16] time he knew it would be and what what a
[1:11:20] more glorious sunrise that was than it
[1:11:24] was at the beginning at time when it
[1:11:27] first dawn now he goes he goes on into
[1:11:30] some other statements but we'll leave it
[1:11:31] right there
[1:11:32] a man we are looking for what we
[1:11:35] grateful for the first son Amen that
[1:11:38] rose to bring mortal life unto the earth
[1:11:40] but a man it was the Easter sunrise the
[1:11:43] third day that brought amen the son of
[1:11:46] God out of the grave and that is what
[1:11:48] gives us eternal life amen that's that's
[1:11:52] the greatest life that you could ever
[1:11:54] have and we found out on where I'm
[1:11:57] Friday night a man that sons of God a
[1:12:00] man have the ability to impart that
[1:12:05] eternal life a man I trust today that
[1:12:09] somebody will receive an impartation of
[1:12:12] eternal life we we don't want to just
[1:12:15] approach this out of tradition we're
[1:12:16] trying to give you something a man
[1:12:19] something that transcends the life that
[1:12:21] you're living right now a man something
[1:12:24] that gives you hope even after you leave
[1:12:26] this life a man we want to impart
[1:12:29] eternal life and we can give it to you
[1:12:33] through the gospel the good news of the
[1:12:36] gospel can give you eternal life if you
[1:12:40] could believe it and receive it
[1:12:43] hallelujah alright let me go on to a
[1:12:46] another quote here I'm going to go to
[1:12:49] Hebrews chapter 4 praise the Lord just
[1:12:52] bear with me on today a man now he says
[1:12:57] now now watch
[1:13:04] Lord he says now watch that was the
[1:13:08] third rest now and and and what he's
[1:13:10] referring to here is that in in Hebrews
[1:13:14] chapter 4 there were three rests that
[1:13:16] were were offered that God gave the
[1:13:20] first rest was where God rested on the
[1:13:23] seventh day after he had done all his
[1:13:25] creation and everything on the seventh
[1:13:27] day the Bible say that God arrested the
[1:13:30] second rest was when he gave Israel
[1:13:33] their Ten Commandments one of the
[1:13:36] commandments was to honor the Sabbath
[1:13:39] day and to keep it holy right they were
[1:13:42] supposed to rest a man on the Sabbath
[1:13:45] day I know we don't do that anymore
[1:13:47] a man but you know it used to be time
[1:13:49] businesses was closed on on that day you
[1:13:52] know and everything but it was a we
[1:13:55] rested praise the Lord
[1:13:57] we honored that particular day but but
[1:14:00] here you know that the third rest was
[1:14:02] the rest that we would find a man in
[1:14:05] Christ all right and you know we were we
[1:14:09] were we were invited that if we were we
[1:14:12] were and we were heavy laden then we
[1:14:13] were supposed to come and bring our
[1:14:15] burdens to the Lord and say that's where
[1:14:17] we would find rest a man you can't go to
[1:14:21] the car I mean the psychiatrist and fine
[1:14:23] rest you go to complain about your
[1:14:26] problems are they talking about the
[1:14:28] problems and you find that are you two
[1:14:30] psychiatrists I've a dystonic a
[1:14:32] psychiatrist right say say say you can't
[1:14:34] find rest in another person you can only
[1:14:37] find rest you can only find rest in the
[1:14:43] Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah the woman
[1:14:46] at the well was trying to find rest and
[1:14:48] she was going from man to me she could
[1:14:50] not find rest that way she can only find
[1:14:54] rest when she came in contact with the
[1:14:57] Lord Jesus Christ amen listen so uh and
[1:15:01] we're invited you know as believers to
[1:15:04] labor to enter into his rest amen the
[1:15:08] rest that only Christ can give so now as
[1:15:10] we as we read this as now watch that was
[1:15:12] that was a third rest he give the first
[1:15:15] God received it from
[1:15:18] work second Israel received it in the
[1:15:20] law third the church received it as part
[1:15:23] of God three is the number of life
[1:15:27] that's a statement I want you all to
[1:15:29] catch three is the number of life how
[1:15:34] many knows that says every time you see
[1:15:36] three it's life
[1:15:39] notice when God created the earth on the
[1:15:42] third day was life how many knows that
[1:15:45] the third day there came life on the
[1:15:47] third day of creation he also says the
[1:15:50] Trinity the Father was above the people
[1:15:51] in a pillar of fire the son was a man
[1:15:54] who talked to the people and got them
[1:15:56] ready the Holy Ghost was the third step
[1:15:58] which was the Holy Ghost God in the
[1:16:02] people life right so he says the rest of
[1:16:05] God the rest of Israel the rest of the
[1:16:07] church the Sabbath keepers so he says
[1:16:09] three is life now I wanted to just kind
[1:16:13] of focus on that a man just a little bit
[1:16:16] because maybe let me just read one more
[1:16:19] quote here out of the deity of Jesus
[1:16:21] Christ we're going to kind of get into
[1:16:23] that three just a little bit so three is
[1:16:26] life three is life it says now Jesus
[1:16:30] comes three times he came the first time
[1:16:33] to redeem his church he comes the second
[1:16:37] time to receive his church and if I
[1:16:40] could just be honest with you that's the
[1:16:42] time we live in him right now hey man
[1:16:44] it's good to look back to what happened
[1:16:47] 2,000 years ago but we also better keep
[1:16:49] our eyes on what's happening right now
[1:16:52] hey man so amen everybody celebrate
[1:16:55] Easter and they're going back 2,000
[1:16:56] years ago but they they fail to
[1:16:58] recognize what God is doing now he came
[1:17:02] the first time to redeem a man his
[1:17:05] church right but he he comes the second
[1:17:08] time to receive his church and if I get
[1:17:11] this if he came the first time you ought
[1:17:13] to you ought to be assured that he's
[1:17:15] coming the second time right he comes
[1:17:17] the third time with his church
[1:17:20] everything in the Bible travels in
[1:17:22] Trinities threes but all in one Christ
[1:17:26] remember the first time to redeem his
[1:17:28] church the second time to receive
[1:17:31] Church the third time with this church
[1:17:33] as king and queen Amen let's just go a
[1:17:40] little further I'll stop there on that
[1:17:42] statement so we're talking three three
[1:17:45] is life 3 when we look here at this this
[1:17:49] three there were three rests eight men
[1:17:52] spoken of in the Hebrews forward we just
[1:17:54] mentioned about God rested on the
[1:17:55] seventh day Israel resting on this also
[1:17:59] I mean God resting at the time of
[1:18:01] creation on the seventh day Israel
[1:18:03] honoring the seventh day of the week a
[1:18:05] man as a Sabbath rest and Christ himself
[1:18:08] became a rest for us every weary soul
[1:18:11] had the opportunity to enter into Christ
[1:18:14] and receive rest amen
[1:18:16] another three was the coming of Christ
[1:18:19] to redeem his church to receive his
[1:18:21] church in the third time is with his
[1:18:23] church glory to God and in Jesus
[1:18:26] ministry there was three raisings of the
[1:18:29] date a man he rose gyruss his daughter
[1:18:32] he rolls the son of the widow of nain
[1:18:34] and he also brought to life Lazarus
[1:18:37] there was three raisins of the day amen
[1:18:40] also when we when we talk about our Lord
[1:18:42] and Savior Jesus Christ operates in
[1:18:44] three offices Amen father Amen God above
[1:18:48] us amen
[1:18:49] the Sun God with us amen but the Holy
[1:18:53] Ghost is God in us amen and and the
[1:18:58] other thing that that separates a man
[1:19:01] Christianity from any other religion is
[1:19:03] also done in three and that we speak up
[1:19:06] today's the death the burial and the
[1:19:09] resurrection of our Lord and Savior
[1:19:11] Jesus Christ amen but the Prophet told
[1:19:14] us that amen
[1:19:15] Genesis kind of speaks of this and I
[1:19:18] want to just kind of read that if we can
[1:19:20] I'm going to go to Genesis 1 and verse 9
[1:19:23] through 13 here let's just read that it
[1:19:25] says three is the number of life now
[1:19:28] let's look at this this is the third day
[1:19:29] of creation and it says this and God
[1:19:32] said let the waters under the heaven be
[1:19:35] gathered together unto one place and let
[1:19:38] the dry land appear and it was so he
[1:19:42] says then God called the dry land earth
[1:19:45] and the gathering together the waters
[1:19:47] called he seas and God saw that it was
[1:19:52] good and God said let the earth bring
[1:19:56] forth grass now this is where life is
[1:19:59] kind of entering in the herb yielding
[1:20:01] seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit
[1:20:03] after his kind whose seed is in itself
[1:20:06] upon the earth and it was so now what
[1:20:09] when you when you look at that the seed
[1:20:11] been in itself this was already a mat or
[1:20:13] tree right a man it's already bearing
[1:20:17] okay so so here God God says up God said
[1:20:21] let the earth bring forth grass the herb
[1:20:23] yielding seed and the fruit tree
[1:20:24] yielding fruit after skon whose seed is
[1:20:27] in itself upon the earth and it was so
[1:20:28] and the earth brought forth grass the
[1:20:31] herb and herb yielding seed after his
[1:20:33] calm and the tree yielding fruit whose
[1:20:35] seed was in itself after Scott and God
[1:20:37] saw that it was good and the evening and
[1:20:40] the morning were the third day now here
[1:20:44] we see that life when the Prophet
[1:20:46] actually told us that life a man three
[1:20:49] is the number of life so here on the
[1:20:51] third day this is our first a man sign
[1:20:54] of life that's happening on earth now
[1:20:57] this happens before the S UN is created
[1:21:00] and before the moon is created that did
[1:21:02] not come until the fourth day hallelujah
[1:21:05] Amen I mean I won't go into all of that
[1:21:07] but the first time when God said let
[1:21:09] there be light that was the s o n light
[1:21:11] that was being created but the S you in
[1:21:14] like they're not coming to the fourth
[1:21:16] day but God had put these things in
[1:21:18] place life had begun on the third day
[1:21:21] because three is life three is life now
[1:21:26] I was looking at something here you know
[1:21:30] there was a statement that the prophet
[1:21:32] made I won't read this I'll just tell
[1:21:33] you where it is but you don't have to
[1:21:35] pull this up he says he was talking
[1:21:37] about Elizabeth a man and her giving
[1:21:41] birth to the law to John the Baptist you
[1:21:45] know and when Mary came to just just
[1:21:48] sing greetings a man to Elizabeth he
[1:21:50] went when she came Elizabeth was at a
[1:21:54] place where she had a baby a man she was
[1:21:56] pregnant with John
[1:21:58] but the baby was was not moving she
[1:22:01] thought the baby was dead and the
[1:22:03] probably made a statement saying he says
[1:22:04] now anyone knows that that's altogether
[1:22:07] out of the ordinary because two or three
[1:22:11] months and life is filled in two or
[1:22:14] three months life this felt but this had
[1:22:17] been six months with no sign of life now
[1:22:20] that baby was dead six months with no
[1:22:23] life a man and she said she was worried
[1:22:26] about it now six months there was no
[1:22:29] life hallelujah hey man I want to tell
[1:22:32] you that some of us been going a lot
[1:22:33] longer than six months with no life a
[1:22:37] man you you might be living and
[1:22:40] breathing and all those other things but
[1:22:42] you don't really start living until you
[1:22:44] know Jesus Christ right but but here it
[1:22:50] was six months and and when you and we
[1:22:52] got this you know we're talking about
[1:22:54] these three today because when you got
[1:22:56] six months you got two threes just three
[1:22:58] times two is six right three plus three
[1:23:00] is six right so you got two threes here
[1:23:03] and here here in the six months when I
[1:23:06] went when Mary approaches Elizabethton
[1:23:09] and she begins to say well you know I'm
[1:23:11] also pregnant too
[1:23:12] it's an angel came down and told me that
[1:23:15] I was gonna be her son and I should call
[1:23:17] his name Jesus now you know as soon as
[1:23:20] she spoke the word Jesus a baby that had
[1:23:27] been dead for six months received life
[1:23:34] and I wish it was the same if I could
[1:23:37] just say Jesus and see people receive
[1:23:40] life Oh hallelujah somebody right but
[1:23:49] you know you know it's the three
[1:23:50] represents three three years life three
[1:23:53] is life so you know another thing that I
[1:23:55] found as he was just kind of talking
[1:23:57] about that you know it says usually it
[1:24:01] says two or three months life is felt I
[1:24:03] say two or three months life especially
[1:24:05] let me go back and look at this a little
[1:24:06] bit a little bit deeper and I began to
[1:24:08] just kind of study that when a
[1:24:11] lady becomes pregnant you know she goes
[1:24:14] through three trimesters she goes
[1:24:21] through three trimesters in her
[1:24:22] pregnancy before she brings forth life
[1:24:27] right
[1:24:28] amen and now not only you know not only
[1:24:30] does she go through three trimesters
[1:24:33] amen but when she if it's a natural
[1:24:36] birth then she goes through three stages
[1:24:41] of labor so it's three trimesters and
[1:24:46] then three stages of labor once you get
[1:24:49] there come on somebody right see the
[1:24:53] early labor to the three centimeters
[1:24:56] dilated is the longest and the toughest
[1:24:59] phase hallelujah
[1:25:03] see maybe when he went to the cross
[1:25:07] there was the toughest phase but on the
[1:25:12] third day brother everybody's crying
[1:25:18] turn to smile the third day brought nice
[1:25:26] see in in three stages of labor if it's
[1:25:30] a natural birth early labor the three
[1:25:33] centimeters dilated is the longest in
[1:25:35] the toughest phase and then the second
[1:25:38] phase is from three centimeters to seven
[1:25:40] centimeters dilated a man that's the
[1:25:42] second phase of the stage of labor all
[1:25:46] right but the last stage a man of labor
[1:25:49] is wish it when the woman goes from
[1:25:52] seven centimeters to fully dilated a man
[1:25:55] which is a ten centimeters now I'm gonna
[1:25:57] tell you when she get there you better
[1:26:00] make sure if you want to see the baby
[1:26:02] boy you better be there then because
[1:26:05] once she hit ten centimeters things
[1:26:08] begin to change in the room I can hear
[1:26:11] somebody in the end in the mother's ears
[1:26:13] and say stop not before she get that
[1:26:15] each other
[1:26:16] now be careful don't do this because
[1:26:18] she's trying to get rid of this she
[1:26:22] trying to let this go she tried
[1:26:24] I mean am i there yet and they temp
[1:26:30] don't push now don't push because you
[1:26:32] might hurt something I don't do that
[1:26:34] just wait you got I mean the process has
[1:26:36] started
[1:26:37] it may seem a little difficult but God
[1:26:40] is working sometimes she's in that stage
[1:26:43] for hours but we suggest the fully
[1:26:47] darling if they not push now push
[1:26:54] hallelujah amen and the church is fully
[1:26:57] darling it's time to push you know I
[1:27:02] pushed me push means pray until
[1:27:07] something happens
[1:27:09] come on church push push push
[1:27:22] [Music]
[1:27:29] she's about to bring forth life and I
[1:27:33] believe that the church spiritually
[1:27:35] today is about to bring forth life we've
[1:27:40] been praying we've been waiting
[1:27:43] we've been fasting we looking for life
[1:27:50] somebody to have an encounter with Jesus
[1:27:54] Christ Oh
[1:27:57] Easter just won't be one day a year but
[1:28:01] Easter becomes your life this 3 a man
[1:28:10] we're staying with this 3 hallelujah
[1:28:15] because 3 a man is the number of life
[1:28:19] and I just kind of went through the
[1:28:22] scriptures and I found a number of
[1:28:23] threes all over the place and I couldn't
[1:28:26] bring them all so I just brought some
[1:28:29] and found out that and I don't know why
[1:28:32] it took three days for Mary and Joseph
[1:28:35] to find Jesus
[1:28:39] but for some reason he was they had long
[1:28:42] they'd gone and they left him for three
[1:28:44] days and oftentimes we leave the Lord
[1:28:48] come on
[1:28:49] we walk away and we leave him and we go
[1:28:53] through a certain time period sometimes
[1:28:55] it's three days sometimes it's three
[1:28:57] years sometimes it's three months amen
[1:29:00] but we go through maybe something
[1:29:02] happened and we go through and we leave
[1:29:03] the Lord but I'm gonna tell you if you
[1:29:05] leave them you know where to find them
[1:29:15] ain't no sense in going looking nowhere
[1:29:18] else you gonna find him right where you
[1:29:22] left him so the quicker you can get back
[1:29:29] there the quicker you can get some life
[1:29:34] you know Jesus first miracle that he
[1:29:39] ever performed was turning the water
[1:29:42] into wine and the good thing that I
[1:29:46] found here scriptures that that occurred
[1:29:48] on the third day because it said there
[1:29:53] in John 2 and 1 it says the third day
[1:29:59] there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee
[1:30:01] and the mother of Jesus was there can we
[1:30:05] just go ahead and read that John two and
[1:30:08] one and a man let's just just this look
[1:30:11] at this hallelujah I said and the third
[1:30:15] day there was a marriage in Cana of
[1:30:17] Galilee and and the mother of Jesus was
[1:30:21] there go on to verse 2 and both Jesus
[1:30:26] was called and his disciples to the
[1:30:29] marriage and when they wanted wine the
[1:30:32] mother jesus saith unto him they have no
[1:30:36] wine now
[1:30:37] you know evidently Mary had seen Jesus
[1:30:41] do a couple of things
[1:30:46] you know and she wouldn't just go to him
[1:30:49] like that
[1:30:50] right she will just run up to him like
[1:30:52] that
[1:30:52] if if something he Emmy he hadn't done
[1:30:55] something before I don't know what he
[1:30:57] did around the house I have no idea what
[1:31:04] this household would have been like
[1:31:08] maybe maybe maybe one day mama
[1:31:11] I mean maybe one day daddy don't have
[1:31:13] enough money to bring no no food home
[1:31:16] come on somebody and Marius may be
[1:31:19] baking the last cake and I and she like
[1:31:23] what I don't know what we don't do
[1:31:24] tomorrow Joseph I have no idea what's
[1:31:27] going to happen in this house tomorrow
[1:31:28] these kids need to eat and and Joseph we
[1:31:32] going through right now and all of a
[1:31:34] sudden Jesus say sit down mama sit down
[1:31:36] sit down sit down
[1:31:39] I mean everybody sit down we got this
[1:31:41] thing under control and they sit down
[1:31:43] and he say a prayer before you know it
[1:31:44] depletes our fool
[1:31:45] maybe maybe things like that happened in
[1:31:48] the house so she had confidence that if
[1:31:53] Jesus is that the party if Jesus is
[1:31:59] involved then everything will be all
[1:32:03] right
[1:32:08] look at it look at it see the reason
[1:32:12] things ain't no right cuz you ain't got
[1:32:13] Jesus involved yet that's why you keep
[1:32:16] struggling you ain't got Jesus involved
[1:32:19] yet when you get him involved that
[1:32:22] problem will be over he can settle it
[1:32:26] all right now come on
[1:32:33] it says he says and Jesus said unto her
[1:32:35] now now now notice the scripture Jesus a
[1:32:38] woman what have I to do with the man
[1:32:40] hours not yet come I remember said that
[1:32:43] he lost they lost him in three days and
[1:32:45] they found right where they left him
[1:32:46] well you know when they got back to him
[1:32:48] they made us marry me to come and say
[1:32:50] your father and I
[1:32:51] have been looking for you and Jesus had
[1:32:55] to correct his own mama because he Mary
[1:32:58] was not his mother
[1:32:59] she was the incubator that God selected
[1:33:04] or elected to bring forth amongst his
[1:33:06] own self but God don't have no mama
[1:33:08] God don't have no daddy God is God right
[1:33:14] so so he had he had that he had to put a
[1:33:15] stretch they say now did not you know
[1:33:17] I'd be about my father's business at 12
[1:33:20] years old he was correcting her oh my
[1:33:23] god don't get it twisted we're gonna go
[1:33:35] through this thing but you're not who
[1:33:37] you you know who you claiming to be in
[1:33:39] front of these people now if you go back
[1:33:45] and read the scripture you see that
[1:33:46] later on
[1:33:47] here to say that he was just he was he
[1:33:49] began to be obedient you know to
[1:33:52] everything that there was acting to do
[1:33:55] and say hey that he grew in I got it I
[1:33:59] can't I can't read all this young Luke -
[1:34:02] y'all go find it in Luke - Luke 2 verse
[1:34:04] 45 and on from there y'all find it but
[1:34:06] he grew he grew in wisdom grew in
[1:34:08] knowledge grew in strength and I'm like
[1:34:10] Jesus growing yeah he should have did
[1:34:12] that's what the Bible say I'm staying
[1:34:14] here with John - ok but here here so so
[1:34:18] first four said Jesus said in her woman
[1:34:21] what have I to do with thee my towers
[1:34:23] not yet come he had to call a woman
[1:34:24] because she was not his mother
[1:34:26] right his mother says aren't unto the
[1:34:29] server now you can imagine how did that
[1:34:31] how did her how does John write this do
[1:34:34] I write that I mean I know he was but
[1:34:36] she she carried him but you know how he
[1:34:38] write his mother his mother said unto
[1:34:40] the service whatsoever he saith unto you
[1:34:43] doing and there was set there six
[1:34:47] waterpots of stone divided that you got
[1:34:51] three all right there 3 times 2 is 6 3
[1:34:54] plus 3 6 here we go some more threes so
[1:34:56] there was set there six waterpots of
[1:34:58] stone after the manner of purifying of
[1:35:00] the Jews containing two or three firkins
[1:35:02] apiece jesus said to him
[1:35:06] the water pots with water and they
[1:35:08] filled him up to the brim and he said
[1:35:10] unto them draw out now and bearing to
[1:35:13] the governor of the feast and they bear
[1:35:14] it and when the rule of the feast had
[1:35:16] tasted the water that was made wine and
[1:35:19] knew not whence it was but the service
[1:35:21] which drew the water knew the governor
[1:35:23] of the feast called the bridegroom and
[1:35:25] said unto him every man at the beginning
[1:35:27] does set forth good drink I mean good
[1:35:30] wine and when men have well drunk then
[1:35:33] that which is worse but thou has kept
[1:35:36] the good wine until now this beginning
[1:35:40] of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee
[1:35:42] and manifested forth his glory and his
[1:35:45] disciples believed on him so his first
[1:35:48] miracle happened on the third day where
[1:35:51] he turned water into wine and when he
[1:35:53] turned water into wine he completely
[1:35:55] bypassed the process of how wine was
[1:35:59] supposed to be developed compete
[1:36:01] completely bypassed the process
[1:36:04] hallelujah God has a way of just went
[1:36:06] when he told the disciples to me to
[1:36:09] bring the fish that they caught and he
[1:36:11] made fish on the bank he bypassed the
[1:36:13] process of catching fish scale and fish
[1:36:16] and cooking fish bypassed the process
[1:36:19] and some things in your life got gonna
[1:36:22] bypass the process to get you right
[1:36:25] where he wants you to be
[1:36:34] oh yeah he can bypass a process bless it
[1:36:39] be his holy name
[1:36:41] all that happened on the third day can
[1:36:44] we go a little further I was looking at
[1:36:48] esta 4 and 16 zester was in a situation
[1:36:56] where she was called to be the queen
[1:36:59] after Vashti had denied king hasser is
[1:37:04] some things she was denied she was
[1:37:07] rejected a sheep sheep that she denied
[1:37:08] him then she got rejected they got a new
[1:37:10] queen and Esther was that Queen and
[1:37:13] they're coming time esta got a little
[1:37:15] secure there in the kingdom she was so
[1:37:17] happy to be the new queen and Wow before
[1:37:20] she before she went in her uncle
[1:37:22] Mordecai told her now don't tell them
[1:37:24] that you Jewish don't don't don't don't
[1:37:26] say anything about it just let him go
[1:37:27] right on but there come a time where you
[1:37:29] have to reveal it and they got to a spot
[1:37:31] where they put out a word that because
[1:37:33] the more to kind of stand because more I
[1:37:36] mean they wanted to kill all the Jews
[1:37:37] because of one man Mordecai stand
[1:37:41] because he would not bow to Haman Haman
[1:37:43] come up with a law that we're gonna kill
[1:37:45] all these Jews we're gonna get rid of
[1:37:47] them all and I ain't so so Mordecai went
[1:37:50] until he got word I said not now it's
[1:37:52] time for you to step up and tell them
[1:37:54] who you are now it's time to declare you
[1:37:57] know who you are because we're gonna
[1:37:58] lose our lives if you don't go in before
[1:38:01] the king and say something right so now
[1:38:03] here and I exit I mean and and what were
[1:38:06] esther said to him right now I can't go
[1:38:08] before the king because if I go before
[1:38:10] the king and he does not bid me to come
[1:38:13] with his golden scepter then I'm gonna
[1:38:15] die so here in Esther 4:16 s just
[1:38:20] finally convinced say I got to do
[1:38:22] something for my people I got to reveal
[1:38:24] something to the king
[1:38:25] so and that's the full 16 she say go and
[1:38:28] gather all I'll gather together all the
[1:38:31] Jews that are present in Shushan and
[1:38:33] fast ye for me everybody had to be
[1:38:37] involved in the fast
[1:38:43] this was what we call a global fast
[1:38:46] where everybody got involved if you
[1:38:51] wanted your life spared then you got
[1:38:54] involved in this fast go gather together
[1:38:59] all the Jews that are present in Shushan
[1:39:01] and fast she for me and neither eat nor
[1:39:04] drink three days looking night or day I
[1:39:09] also and my maintance will fast likewise
[1:39:12] and so will I go in unto the king which
[1:39:15] is not according to the law if I perish
[1:39:19] I perish but all this happened after
[1:39:25] three days with three day fast now now
[1:39:29] you know I'm gonna let you go and read
[1:39:30] the rest of that you go to the next
[1:39:32] chapter you find some things that it was
[1:39:34] after three days of fasting that Esther
[1:39:37] put on her royal apparel she got her
[1:39:40] best dress and said she stood this was
[1:39:43] after the fasting right she stood and
[1:39:45] went with winning the inner court of the
[1:39:47] king's house and she knew that anybody
[1:39:50] coming into that Kings Court not being
[1:39:52] called it was a sure death but she got
[1:39:56] dressed her best she wanted to make sure
[1:39:58] the King noticed her baby recognized
[1:40:01] that now if you're gonna kill me you
[1:40:02] gonna kill me at my best you're gonna
[1:40:06] take me out you're gonna take me out of
[1:40:07] my best a man you remember this dress
[1:40:10] you bought for me right I mean I can
[1:40:13] imagine is - did that right and she she
[1:40:17] winning she did stood there gracefully
[1:40:19] right just waiting just to see what
[1:40:23] would happen but all this happened after
[1:40:25] a three-day fast
[1:40:27] hallelujah so when she stood there amen
[1:40:30] all of a sudden the king took the golden
[1:40:32] scepter and he stretched it forth
[1:40:34] towards Esther and that meant that her
[1:40:37] life would be spared and she would not
[1:40:39] die because three Ripper is for life
[1:40:44] right so so so God spared not only her
[1:40:48] life but God also spared that lock the
[1:40:51] lives of all the Jews because of that
[1:40:54] that occurred because three was the
[1:40:56] number of life in lighted by fast the
[1:41:05] Daniel fast Daniel one time was praying
[1:41:11] about something he couldn't get an
[1:41:13] answer and it took 21 days for Daniel to
[1:41:18] get his answer 21 days is how many
[1:41:23] threes seven threes right and here God
[1:41:28] would give Daniel his visitation after
[1:41:32] his fasts and and again 21 days
[1:41:35] represents seven threes guess what
[1:41:37] church we are also under expectation for
[1:41:41] a visitation and I'm expecting God to
[1:41:45] visit us today he's already started he's
[1:41:48] already started but you know what I know
[1:41:50] there's some things on this cross and
[1:41:54] some things on the cross that's been
[1:41:56] there for four years and every time God
[1:41:58] responds and answers one of those
[1:41:59] requests we take it down off the cross
[1:42:01] I'm believing that today gonna be that
[1:42:03] day glory to God hey man
[1:42:11] let me let me give you another one
[1:42:13] Joshua 1 and 11 Joshua 1 and 11 now you
[1:42:20] go back and read Joshua it's a very very
[1:42:22] powerful book a very encouraging book a
[1:42:24] man especially chapter 1 after you told
[1:42:28] Joshua Moses my servant is dead but now
[1:42:30] you got to rise up and you got to take
[1:42:32] the people into the Promised Land and
[1:42:33] say that's that's your responsibility
[1:42:35] take him into the land and then divide
[1:42:37] the land amongst him he had a greater
[1:42:39] responsibility than Moses did right but
[1:42:41] here here here Joshua a man did
[1:42:44] something amongst the people in Joshua
[1:42:46] 1:11 he says pass through the hosts it
[1:42:49] says and command the people saying
[1:42:51] prepare you vittles for within three
[1:42:56] days ye shall pass over this Jordan
[1:42:59] Jordan represented a death amen
[1:43:02] you're going to pass over this Jordan to
[1:43:04] go in and to possess the land which the
[1:43:07] Lord your
[1:43:08] God give you to possess it now they were
[1:43:11] supposed to get this in three days now
[1:43:13] just line up Joshua three for me verse
[1:43:15] one don't don't pull it up yet but just
[1:43:17] line it up I just want to say this here
[1:43:19] here they are a man at a place where
[1:43:22] they have been wandering in the
[1:43:23] wilderness for forty years but here
[1:43:26] Joshua rises up a man by faith and he
[1:43:29] says within three days we're going into
[1:43:32] the place that God has promised us amen
[1:43:34] no longer wandering but we're actually
[1:43:37] getting ready to go in and possess this
[1:43:39] land that God told us that we're
[1:43:41] supposed to have forty years ago a man
[1:43:43] now here's what I want to say I believe
[1:43:46] there comes a time where the promise
[1:43:51] that God has given you has to become a
[1:43:54] manifestation it has to move from
[1:43:58] promise to being a manifestation no
[1:44:00] longer you just quoting it but now you
[1:44:02] got to live it
[1:44:04] hallelujah amen Abraham had a promise of
[1:44:08] a baby for 25 years but one day when
[1:44:11] Isaac was born it became a manifestation
[1:44:14] listen Noah had a promise that it would
[1:44:16] rain for 120 years but one day amen the
[1:44:20] promise was manifested in North life the
[1:44:23] children of Israel Warner for 40 years
[1:44:25] in the wilderness
[1:44:26] after leaving Egypt but one day the Amen
[1:44:30] God gave them the promise of entering
[1:44:32] into the promised land
[1:44:34] see the wilderness was not the promise
[1:44:36] it was simply part of the process but
[1:44:39] God promised the land flowing milk and
[1:44:41] honey and that's when Josh was stood up
[1:44:43] and said within three days this promise
[1:44:46] going to be made manifest now here in
[1:44:48] Joshua 3 verse 1 through 5 look at what
[1:44:51] happens here and if I'm not mistaken
[1:44:53] when they decided to go into the
[1:44:57] Promised Land it was the month of April
[1:45:05] if I'm not mistaken the month of April
[1:45:08] it was a really bad time because the
[1:45:10] waters were overflowing and I'm gonna
[1:45:12] tell you something you might be in a
[1:45:13] situation where problems are just
[1:45:15] overflowing situation and circumstance
[1:45:18] and all kind of things that are
[1:45:19] happening you just don't know what to do
[1:45:21] about
[1:45:21] this is the time when your promise is
[1:45:22] about to be be made manifest you've been
[1:45:25] believing God for your family receive
[1:45:27] him
[1:45:31] Joshua 3 verse 1 through 5 look at this
[1:45:34] and Joshua rose early in the morning and
[1:45:36] they removed from shittim and came to
[1:45:38] Jordan he and all the children of Israel
[1:45:40] and lodged there before they passed over
[1:45:42] and it came to pass after three days
[1:45:44] that the officers went through the hosts
[1:45:47] a man and they commanded the people
[1:45:50] saying when he see the Ark of the
[1:45:51] Covenant of the Lord your God and the
[1:45:54] priests the Levites bearing it then ye
[1:45:56] shall remove from your place and go
[1:45:58] after it
[1:45:58] yet there shall be space between you and
[1:46:01] it about two thousand cubits by measure
[1:46:04] come not near into it that you may know
[1:46:06] the way by which he must go for ye have
[1:46:10] not passed this way heretofore and
[1:46:12] Joshua said unto the people sanctify
[1:46:15] yourselves for tomorrow the Lord will do
[1:46:18] wonders among you somebody should have
[1:46:21] said a man today I'm under expectation I
[1:46:25] mean I'm looking I'm you know see this
[1:46:26] thing moved from just being a promise
[1:46:28] right let's move to a manifestation time
[1:46:31] and and we've been holding on for
[1:46:33] certain things in church i'ma tell you
[1:46:34] if there was ever time for you to get
[1:46:36] desperate about what God promised you
[1:46:38] that time is right now that time is
[1:46:42] right now if you've been holding on for
[1:46:45] family members you ought to be pushing
[1:46:46] praying until something happens don't
[1:46:49] let go until something happens glory to
[1:46:52] God you want to change it change it on
[1:46:54] your knees glory to God hallelujah
[1:46:59] a man church did this is a time for us
[1:47:03] to receive what God has promised us I
[1:47:05] got another scripture that I want to
[1:47:07] read to you here because this is another
[1:47:10] thing about a three a man that was in
[1:47:12] the scripture and I just love how the
[1:47:14] Holy Spirit just kind of put these
[1:47:15] things they don't go into the to the
[1:47:17] promised land so after three days here
[1:47:20] Esther doesn't go before the King until
[1:47:22] after three days of fasting right I mean
[1:47:24] all these threes are just sitting there
[1:47:26] Scripture I got some more for you I got
[1:47:28] some worse it's coming but but when you
[1:47:30] start looking at this it was all
[1:47:31] speaking of Calvary that third day
[1:47:34] hallelujah
[1:47:35] amen now I want you to just kind of
[1:47:37] catch this with me don't let it go
[1:47:39] overhead I'm going to a book that you
[1:47:41] probably haven't read in a long time
[1:47:43] hosea chapter 6 and I'm gonna start
[1:47:50] reading from verse 1 and 2 hosea the
[1:47:55] reason i make the statement that this is
[1:47:57] a time where we ought to be more
[1:47:58] desperate than we've ever been because
[1:48:01] god made israel a promise and that
[1:48:04] promise is coming into manifestation now
[1:48:07] right before our very eyes and notice
[1:48:10] what he says here in hosea 6 verse 1 and
[1:48:13] 2 says come and let us return unto the
[1:48:16] Lord for he hath torn and he will heal
[1:48:19] us he has smitten and he will bind us up
[1:48:22] after two days will he revive us in the
[1:48:27] third day he will raise us up and we
[1:48:30] shall live in his sight because the
[1:48:34] third day brings life right so in the
[1:48:37] third day Israel is going to receive
[1:48:39] life so ever since they rejected Christ
[1:48:42] and put him on the cross that gave
[1:48:45] opportunity to us Gentiles but there's a
[1:48:47] promise in scripture that in the third
[1:48:50] day they will receive life stay with me
[1:48:57] Hosea 14 and verse four through five now
[1:49:01] as we as we're getting that I want I
[1:49:03] want to just I want to I want to ask a
[1:49:05] question here to the Lord put in my
[1:49:06] heart what if this was our last Easter
[1:49:10] celebration before Jesus returned the
[1:49:15] second time what if this was the last
[1:49:19] one right and and and and if it's not
[1:49:22] the last one I need to put this in your
[1:49:24] spirit one day you will go to church for
[1:49:30] your last Easter service how are you how
[1:49:36] would you approach it if you knew this
[1:49:39] was your last Easter service oh it's too
[1:49:44] traditional
[1:49:45] it's just way too traditional but how
[1:49:47] would you approach it if you knew one
[1:49:49] day it was going to be the last then I
[1:49:51] just read to you a promise in Scripture
[1:49:53] that is turning from the Gentiles going
[1:49:56] back to the Jews well look at this in
[1:50:02] Hosea 14 verse 4 and 5 this is what he
[1:50:06] when he promises the Jews he says I will
[1:50:07] heal their backsliding
[1:50:09] I will love them freely for my angers
[1:50:12] turned away from him
[1:50:13] it says I will be as do unto Israel he
[1:50:18] shall grow as the lily and cast forth
[1:50:21] his roots as Lebanon now I'm just
[1:50:23] beginning to think about that so if this
[1:50:25] if it's possible that we could enter
[1:50:26] into our last Easter that one day we're
[1:50:29] gonna hear our final Easter sermon and
[1:50:31] I'm not talk about because you you die
[1:50:33] no living people gonna hear they last
[1:50:36] Easter sermon glory to God right and
[1:50:39] Saints because there's a rapture that's
[1:50:41] ahead of us now if he promised to heal
[1:50:43] the backsliding of Israel and we know
[1:50:47] that this is a season where he's turning
[1:50:48] amen back to the Jews we realized that
[1:50:51] that is the hour that we're living in he
[1:50:53] said now I just thought to myself before
[1:50:55] God can heal Israel's backsliding if
[1:50:58] this is the end time then God got to
[1:51:02] heal my loved ones backsliding and he
[1:51:07] promised it to Israel and I'm gonna
[1:51:09] write that same promise for my own loved
[1:51:12] ones if he's gonna heal their backslider
[1:51:15] before he calls Israel he has to call us
[1:51:18] out so I'm expecting him to heal my
[1:51:22] loved ones backslide he told me the
[1:51:27] promise is unto me my children those
[1:51:30] that are far off as many as the lord my
[1:51:32] god shall call so i'm holding them to
[1:51:35] his promise can i just read to y'all
[1:51:37] just a little bit here out of
[1:51:38] recognizing your day in its message
[1:51:40] amen and then i'll slip on down to a few
[1:51:43] more threes recognizing your day in its
[1:51:45] message it says oh how thankful how no
[1:51:53] wonder we are so grateful i feel that
[1:51:56] we're not grateful enough for the things
[1:51:57] that god is making known to us
[1:51:59] naked and the vision said showed me she
[1:52:02] was naked and didn't know it and blinded
[1:52:04] as Israel was blinded so that the
[1:52:06] Gentiles could come in now the Gentiles
[1:52:09] are blinded so the bride can be taken
[1:52:11] out and Israel can receive the Feast of
[1:52:14] the trumpets just perfectly he says
[1:52:17] after two days he will revive us or give
[1:52:20] us a revival bringing us together the
[1:52:22] Jews speaking on these trumpets now he
[1:52:24] says and we shall live in his sight or
[1:52:26] have eternal life
[1:52:27] see we'll be in his sight the Bible said
[1:52:30] here in Hosea it says we shall live in
[1:52:34] his sight life have life in his sight
[1:52:37] that's his own life eternal life have
[1:52:40] life in his sight she that lives in
[1:52:43] pleasure is dead while she lives see so
[1:52:45] we promised that Israel again would have
[1:52:47] life in his sight she's been dead to the
[1:52:50] facts and to the Pentecostal feast note
[1:52:53] now notice carefully then after two days
[1:52:56] now that didn't mean to 24-hour days coz
[1:52:59] that I said that happened way back
[1:53:01] yonder many hundreds of years ago see it
[1:53:04] meant two days with the Lord after two
[1:53:06] thousand years now you know how long
[1:53:09] it's been since that time it's been 2700
[1:53:12] years since that cousin hosea here in BC
[1:53:15] 780 Amen 1964 see it's been something
[1:53:19] over 2700 years ago he said after two
[1:53:23] days in the third day he will revive us
[1:53:26] again and give us life in his sight
[1:53:28] there's your trumpets coming in that's
[1:53:30] the hour that we're living in the day
[1:53:32] that we're living now they have been
[1:53:34] scattered blinded gathered and far and
[1:53:37] far into the third day you see it they
[1:53:40] were scattered from Palestine throughout
[1:53:41] the world they were blinded to reject
[1:53:43] the Messiah and now they have been
[1:53:46] gathered in their homeland ready for the
[1:53:47] trumpets to recognize the atonement now
[1:53:49] when we talk about the trumpets there
[1:53:51] was a promise inscription and and and
[1:53:54] threatened alone and said the Lord
[1:53:55] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:53:57] shout our came to the Trump of God the
[1:54:00] dead in Christ shall rise first now
[1:54:01] that's a scripture that pertains to the
[1:54:03] rapture but the same Trump that is
[1:54:04] calling the bride out is the same Trump
[1:54:07] that's calling Israel back watch that
[1:54:10] that shows you how close we are now
[1:54:13] we just keep reading here amen in this
[1:54:17] he says that's the Bible said no yes and
[1:54:21] the Bible said when they receive it and
[1:54:23] find him with the nail scars after the
[1:54:26] church is taken they say where did you
[1:54:28] get these scars he said in the house of
[1:54:30] my friends and and he said they would
[1:54:33] separate each family and with cry and
[1:54:34] weep for days like a family that lost
[1:54:36] their only son
[1:54:37] remember the pieces of the trumpet was
[1:54:39] to do that to weep mourn for the kill
[1:54:41] sacrifice they had rejected it Israel is
[1:54:44] going to receive that amen but before
[1:54:46] they receive it the Gentiles must get
[1:54:48] out of the way that's why I'm telling
[1:54:50] you it meant one day you gonna enter
[1:54:52] into your final and last Easter service
[1:54:55] glory to God don't don't let it be
[1:54:57] traditional a man have a relationship
[1:54:59] with the Lord Jesus because it's time to
[1:55:00] get out of here he goes on and say
[1:55:02] they're there in their land they were
[1:55:04] scattered blinded and now gather and it
[1:55:07] was all under that sixth seal there are
[1:55:09] seven trumpets sound it together them
[1:55:11] together the sixth trumpet the seventh
[1:55:14] is that great trumpet and as we had last
[1:55:16] Sunday the sixth trumpet sounded under
[1:55:18] the sixth seal amen just like our sixth
[1:55:21] seal open everything at the same time
[1:55:23] only there's all sounded at once where
[1:55:25] we've been 2,000 years in the
[1:55:27] Pentecostal feast now it goes on this is
[1:55:28] the last paragraph I want to get to you
[1:55:30] now 2,700 years since that time he said
[1:55:33] in the third day we'll be gathered again
[1:55:37] after two days in the third day we'll be
[1:55:40] gathered again and receive life in his
[1:55:43] sight see three is life right so here
[1:55:46] here
[1:55:46] they'll be gathered in the third day
[1:55:48] they'll receive life in a sight in a
[1:55:50] sight do you see the promise the hour
[1:55:52] perfectly wrote on the wall we see where
[1:55:55] we are living now in the homeland
[1:55:57] waiting for the feast of the trumpets
[1:55:59] the recognizing of the atonement and to
[1:56:01] wait for the coming to mourn for their
[1:56:03] rejection or the first time that they
[1:56:05] rejected it they're in the homeland for
[1:56:07] that waiting everything is positioned in
[1:56:10] place as a minister of the gospel I
[1:56:12] can't see one thing left but the going
[1:56:15] of the bride and the bride has to be
[1:56:18] taken away before they can recognize
[1:56:20] what's happened they were bound scatter
[1:56:23] I mean they were scattered blinded and
[1:56:25] now gathered what
[1:56:26] left the bride-to-be taken out of the
[1:56:28] way waiting for the going of the bride
[1:56:31] so the prophets of revelation 11 can
[1:56:33] call them to the Feast of Trumpets to
[1:56:35] make them to recognize what they have
[1:56:37] done this is a promised scripture that
[1:56:40] God sitteth on the init within three
[1:56:42] days on the third day he was gonna call
[1:56:44] Israel back now you all some of y'all
[1:56:47] are already aware this others may not be
[1:56:49] so let me just kind of mention it last
[1:56:52] December amen
[1:56:54] president Trump did something that no
[1:56:56] other president had done before him and
[1:57:00] a lot of them had made the promise but
[1:57:02] they never did it and and no matter you
[1:57:05] know what your feelings are regarding
[1:57:07] President Trump can I just Lord help me
[1:57:09] you know no matter what your feelings
[1:57:11] are because they you know they bring up
[1:57:12] a lot of stuff about the man and some of
[1:57:14] it is really true but no matter what
[1:57:17] your feelings are that man did something
[1:57:20] that nobody else had done that man
[1:57:23] decided he say we moving our embassy
[1:57:25] from Tel Aviv and we're gonna put it in
[1:57:28] Jerusalem because we are standing with
[1:57:30] Israel to identify Jerusalem as their
[1:57:34] capital city that was a very significant
[1:57:37] move according to Bible history that's a
[1:57:40] very significant move and we were the
[1:57:42] first country to do that right everybody
[1:57:45] else was a little afraid because they
[1:57:46] knew that there was a lot of a lot of
[1:57:48] tension there a man with the Muslims and
[1:57:51] everything else but he said I don't and
[1:57:53] he said he said it's always been that
[1:57:55] way and it always will be it's always
[1:57:57] been Jerusalem and he ain't take it back
[1:58:00] no matter what threats came the man let
[1:58:03] us stay just like he wrote it but at
[1:58:06] that significant y'all right those are
[1:58:08] significant things that are happening
[1:58:10] this year a man represents seventy years
[1:58:12] that Israel is a nation
[1:58:14] you know since they regained their their
[1:58:17] their their independence and everything
[1:58:19] this year represents seventy years that
[1:58:21] they did that all it is significant
[1:58:23] signs letting us know that we are closer
[1:58:25] to the coming of the Lord than we ever
[1:58:26] been start looking at it as a past tense
[1:58:30] event because there's another event on
[1:58:33] the horizon and that is the second
[1:58:35] coming of the Lord Jesus one day we're
[1:58:38] going to experience our last East
[1:58:43] hallelujah amen get your Easter eggs
[1:58:48] won't mean nothing in and what that got
[1:58:52] to do at East anyway who went looking
[1:58:55] for eggs when Jesus rose and and they
[1:59:00] had no things no money
[1:59:01] egg back then but now you know you got
[1:59:03] kids running around looking for the
[1:59:04] money egg come on come on church they
[1:59:09] ain't got nothing to do it no Easter no
[1:59:10] bunny rabbit nothing none of that got
[1:59:13] nothing to do with my Lord and Savior
[1:59:15] rising Amen I'm not giving Easter to a
[1:59:18] bunny
[1:59:18] I refuse can we go and look at another
[1:59:23] three Genesis 22
[1:59:34] verse two says now take and he said now
[1:59:39] he said take now thy son not only son
[1:59:43] Isaac whom thou lovest and get them to
[1:59:47] the land of Moriah and offer him there
[1:59:50] for a burnt offering upon one of the
[1:59:52] mountains which I will tell the earth
[1:59:54] now he was supposed to go to Moriah and
[1:59:57] for those of you that don't know Moriah
[1:59:59] happens to be Jerusalem and let's just
[2:00:06] go on a little further say Abraham rose
[2:00:08] up early in the morning and saddled his
[2:00:10] ass and took two of his young men with
[2:00:13] him and Isaac his son and laid the wood
[2:00:16] for the burnt offering and rose up and
[2:00:18] went unto the place of which God had
[2:00:21] told him verse 4 says then o the third
[2:00:26] day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw
[2:00:31] the place afar off I wonder why I ever
[2:00:34] ahem can see this place on the first day
[2:00:36] I wonder why Abraham couldn't see the
[2:00:40] place on the second day maybe he was
[2:00:41] getting a little discouraged that he
[2:00:43] couldn't find this place where God
[2:00:45] wanted him to go and offer his son Isaac
[2:00:47] but on the third day Abraham saw the
[2:00:50] place where far off
[2:00:52] now-now-now Jessica love brother Moriah
[2:00:55] was Jerusalem but the mountain that
[2:00:58] Abraham was trolled to on the third day
[2:01:00] was the exact mountain where Jesus
[2:01:03] Christ gave His life but Abraham found
[2:01:10] the mountain on the third day why would
[2:01:16] God allow him to find it on the third
[2:01:18] day because he knew that on the third
[2:01:20] day at that same Mountain life would
[2:01:23] change for everybody you said I won't
[2:01:32] read it all but it's in a message my
[2:01:34] Redeemer liveth brother branham said
[2:01:37] that was a fourth sight of the
[2:01:40] resurrection when Abraham saw that
[2:01:42] mountain on the third day he saw the
[2:01:44] place afar off where he was supposed to
[2:01:46] offer
[2:01:47] and when he went up there you remember
[2:01:49] the story he went up Danny offered he
[2:01:51] was offering his son Isaac beginning
[2:01:53] access dad said daddy I see the wood and
[2:01:56] Isaac is the one care in the wood
[2:01:58] Isaac is carrying the wood up the
[2:02:00] mountain said daddy I see the wood I
[2:02:03] feel the wood I feel he said but daddy
[2:02:07] where is the sacrifice and Abraham gives
[2:02:11] these great words he says the Lord will
[2:02:14] provide himself not for himself but the
[2:02:19] Lord will provide himself a sacrifice
[2:02:22] and he was even it was again speaking of
[2:02:24] the resurrection because Abraham bound
[2:02:27] Isaac there only on that altar and my he
[2:02:30] went to take that knife and and and and
[2:02:32] Isaac was willing to lay himself down on
[2:02:36] that altar right and and Abraham had the
[2:02:39] faith that if God gave me this boy he
[2:02:42] already done reason from the dead
[2:02:43] because my wife was not able to have to
[2:02:46] have have children but by by God giving
[2:02:48] me this for if he take him from it God
[2:02:50] gonna raise him up again he had that
[2:02:52] kind of faith he said took that knife of
[2:02:57] humor to come down on Isaac he heard the
[2:02:59] voice Lord call twice out of heaven
[2:03:01] Abraham Abraham stay your hand and when
[2:03:04] he stayed his hand saying I looked
[2:03:05] behind you there was a ram caught in the
[2:03:07] bush a ram is not supposed to live on
[2:03:09] the mountain like that there was no
[2:03:11] water up there for them to live offer
[2:03:12] but here the RAM that was in the bush
[2:03:14] God created the RAM and put it there
[2:03:17] notice around being a male lamb
[2:03:20] representing the Lord Jesus Christ the
[2:03:23] same mountain that Abraham offered Isaac
[2:03:26] was the same mountain and I don't notice
[2:03:29] that the RAM took Isaac's place on that
[2:03:34] mountain somebody took your place
[2:03:39] and he saw this place on the third day
[2:03:45] you see Easter is what separates
[2:03:50] Christianity from any other religion
[2:03:55] Easter is where Jesus proved what he
[2:04:00] spoke there are some things that Jesus
[2:04:04] spoke and I just want to I want to I
[2:04:06] want to just hit this if I can I want
[2:04:11] John 2:19
[2:04:15] glory to God these are things that he
[2:04:17] promised while he was here on the earth
[2:04:22] go Rick glory and East is where is where
[2:04:26] he proved these things he spoke this out
[2:04:28] of his own mouth John 2:19 says jesus
[2:04:30] answered and said to him destroy this
[2:04:32] temple and in three days I will raise it
[2:04:37] up then said the Jews for in six years
[2:04:40] was this temple in building and wilt
[2:04:42] thou rear it up in three days but he
[2:04:45] spake of the temple of his body
[2:04:48] hallelujah when he was speaking to tell
[2:04:50] him in three days I raise it up he's
[2:04:51] talking about his own body also here in
[2:04:54] mark 8 verse 31 Amen this is after he
[2:04:57] has this conversation with the disciples
[2:05:00] about who do men say I am after he had
[2:05:03] that conversation dinner he began to
[2:05:04] talk to them about his death glory to
[2:05:07] God in mark 8 31 it says and he began to
[2:05:10] teach them that the Son of man must
[2:05:11] suffer many things and be rejected of
[2:05:14] the elders and the chief priests and
[2:05:15] scribes and be killed and after three
[2:05:18] days rise again he also says this in
[2:05:24] Matthew 12 Oh glory to God verse 40 and
[2:05:29] 40 of verse 40 and 41 he says this for
[2:05:35] his Jonas or Jonah was three days and
[2:05:38] three nights in the whales belly so
[2:05:41] shall the Son of Man be three days and
[2:05:44] three nights in the heart of the earth
[2:05:46] the men of Nineveh shall rise in
[2:05:49] judgment with his general
[2:05:51] with this generation and shall condemn
[2:05:53] it because they repented at the
[2:05:55] preaching of Jonas of Jonah and the
[2:05:58] whole are greater than Jonah is here now
[2:06:02] there was a statement that that the
[2:06:04] Prophet made again I won't take all the
[2:06:06] time to read it but he says now I'll
[2:06:09] read just making a way this is how to
[2:06:10] make it away he says it's about about
[2:06:12] that statement on Jonah it says that's
[2:06:14] the reason Jonah had the faith he did he
[2:06:18] went he had seaweeds wrapped around his
[2:06:20] neck standing in vomit in the belly of
[2:06:23] the well way down in the deep of the
[2:06:25] ocean on a stormy sea he said they're
[2:06:27] lying Vanity's but once more will I look
[2:06:31] to your holy temple God God did
[2:06:33] something he made a way of escape for
[2:06:36] Jonah what he did nobody knows
[2:06:39] that's God's own secret but no matter
[2:06:42] whether it was impossible God can alter
[2:06:46] circumstances oh I don't know what
[2:06:50] you're going through it may seem
[2:06:51] impossible to you this morning but God
[2:06:54] can alter circumstances he can make the
[2:06:58] impossible become a probable and not
[2:07:01] only probable they can make it a reality
[2:07:04] when when man take out at his word
[2:07:06] accept the provided way that God
[2:07:08] provided for the man since God did
[2:07:11] something he might have put a oxygen
[2:07:14] tent down there I don't know what he did
[2:07:18] in the belly of that whale but he kept
[2:07:19] Jonah in there for three days and nights
[2:07:21] as a type that Christ would lay without
[2:07:25] oxygen in the belly of the earth and on
[2:07:28] the third day he will come out again was
[2:07:31] a type he made a way of escape he always
[2:07:34] will I'll tell you what he kept he kept
[2:07:37] Jonah live somehow for three days in the
[2:07:41] belly of a whale and so glad that on the
[2:07:44] third day our Lord and Savior that went
[2:07:48] into that ground a man on Good Friday
[2:07:51] went into the heart of the earth and you
[2:07:53] know there was a lot of things happen
[2:07:55] why he was there you know it just didn't
[2:07:58] stop when he went into the heart of
[2:07:59] earth he actually went on down into hell
[2:08:01] and he preached to the souls that were
[2:08:02] imprisoned that dinners
[2:08:04] the Word of God a man for their day he
[2:08:06] went there and then he also went into
[2:08:08] paradise and he loosed some Saints from
[2:08:09] there I mean there was a lot happening
[2:08:11] within them three days but finally on
[2:08:13] that third day on that third day he rose
[2:08:16] from the grave and he's still alive
[2:08:20] today he is he's the one that was dead a
[2:08:24] man but he is alive forevermore he's
[2:08:28] living and he's alive forevermore no I
[2:08:30] mean this is this is this is our Lord
[2:08:32] that's why we celebrate Easter I'm so
[2:08:37] glad that I serve a risen Savior as I
[2:08:41] make my way back over here to Luke 24
[2:08:44] you see it under you got to understand
[2:08:46] as they were as they were on their way
[2:08:49] to Emmaus you know what had happened
[2:08:53] they had they got a little discouraged
[2:08:59] we were reading there a man in the
[2:09:01] scripture and and you know they had
[2:09:04] actually heard because you know here
[2:09:07] they are the women have gone down to the
[2:09:13] tomb and they were going bearing their
[2:09:14] spices but you know when they got there
[2:09:16] they saw the stone was rolled away and
[2:09:18] as the stone was rolled away they heard
[2:09:21] the two angels speak to them and say you
[2:09:23] know hey the Son of Man must be
[2:09:25] delivered into the hands of sinful men
[2:09:27] and be crucified on the third day rise
[2:09:28] again they remembered his words it said
[2:09:31] it's that set now I said why are you
[2:09:32] looking for the living among the dead
[2:09:33] he's not here but he is risen so here
[2:09:37] that these women they went running back
[2:09:38] to the disciples to tell them what they
[2:09:40] had seen and the disciples had a problem
[2:09:43] receiving this the Bible said they
[2:09:45] looked at as idle tales a man it's just
[2:09:48] a story that's been told but when Peter
[2:09:50] got up and ran down there and and and
[2:09:53] told them I mean he actually saw it saw
[2:09:56] it himself he began to ponder on what
[2:09:58] had happened here what what there's
[2:10:00] somebody coming still his body weight
[2:10:01] what happened where is Jesus we're here
[2:10:04] you know they're all in a discouraged
[2:10:06] state and these two brothers one by the
[2:10:09] name of clear puss and a man and his
[2:10:11] friend they're on the way to Emmaus and
[2:10:13] they're a little discouraged because you
[2:10:15] know they had different thoughts about
[2:10:17] Jesus they were thinking that he was
[2:10:19] going to come and establish the natural
[2:10:21] kingdom here on the earth they were
[2:10:23] tired of what the Romans were doing they
[2:10:25] were looking for change and they're
[2:10:26] expecting Jesus to make the change the
[2:10:30] problem is they missed a change because
[2:10:32] he did make a change but here you know
[2:10:35] that they're dead there look concerned
[2:10:36] and they will discourage and you know
[2:10:39] and because of their discouragement
[2:10:40] discouragement leads you to do things
[2:10:42] that you normally wouldn't do
[2:10:44] right but discouragement Carles them to
[2:10:47] kind of leave where they were and they
[2:10:49] begin to head back to me and I but the
[2:10:52] good thing is as they were on the way to
[2:10:54] Emmaus the good thing they did is they
[2:10:56] begin to talk about Jesus hallelujah and
[2:10:59] if you get discouraged just begin to
[2:11:02] talk about the Lord and and what I want
[2:11:04] to also encourage him to do sometimes
[2:11:05] think about what he's already done and
[2:11:08] begin to talk about the things that he's
[2:11:10] already done because if he's already
[2:11:11] done it then he can do it again so they
[2:11:15] begin to talk about the Lord and you
[2:11:17] know and while they were talking about
[2:11:19] Jesus you know they happen to walk by a
[2:11:22] certain bush and uh and before you nor
[2:11:25] the man jumps from around the bush and
[2:11:28] he says what's all talking about and
[2:11:30] they say you know are you strange in
[2:11:33] these parts you haven't heard what
[2:11:35] happens say you know know what what's
[2:11:37] happened and in and he say they say we
[2:11:40] talk about Jesus of Nazareth he was a
[2:11:42] man I mean well approved of God and and
[2:11:44] we expected certain things from this man
[2:11:46] but we just it's hard to believe that
[2:11:49] he's dead it's hard to believe that that
[2:11:52] he lost his life to weight and he lost
[2:11:54] his life I mean this was a man that did
[2:11:56] so much he could he could heal the sick
[2:11:59] he could give the blind that there that
[2:12:00] the blinded eyes sight he can raise the
[2:12:03] dead this man I mean he did a number of
[2:12:06] things how can he die the way he died
[2:12:08] and when he died he didn't say nothing
[2:12:11] he was there in front of Pilate he had
[2:12:13] an opportunity to say somebody didn't
[2:12:15] say nothing he said we just can't we
[2:12:17] came to understand so so you know the
[2:12:19] Prophet tells us that these men were on
[2:12:21] their way back to their old
[2:12:22] denominational Church the church they
[2:12:25] got kicked out of 90 on the way back but
[2:12:27] as Jesus just began to talk to him he
[2:12:29] began to you know beginning
[2:12:31] some questions and say now oh let me
[2:12:36] pick this up here let me pick this up
[2:12:38] this is I'm in Luke 24 verse 19
[2:12:46] hallelujah and said unto them what
[2:12:51] things and they said unto Him concerning
[2:12:56] Jesus of Nazareth which which was a
[2:12:57] prophet mighty in deed and word before
[2:13:01] God and all the people and look look he
[2:13:04] says it and and and how the chief
[2:13:06] priests and our rulers delivering him to
[2:13:08] be condemned to death and have crucified
[2:13:10] Him it says but we trusted that it had
[2:13:14] been he which should have redeemed
[2:13:15] Israel and beside all this today is the
[2:13:17] the third day since these things were
[2:13:21] done now here they are on the third day
[2:13:24] talking to Jesus and not recognizing
[2:13:28] that it was Jesus and now if you go on
[2:13:32] and you reading that you'll find out
[2:13:33] that Jesus as he just begin to keep
[2:13:35] talking to him it kept talking to him he
[2:13:38] finally got to a point which it called
[2:13:40] him safe fools and slow of heart and the
[2:13:41] reason that they were fools of slow
[2:13:43] heart because they failed to believe
[2:13:45] everything the prophets had said
[2:13:47] concerning the Lord Jesus and they say
[2:13:49] he say and he just began to walk them
[2:13:51] through Scripture say now then the Bible
[2:13:53] say this and then the scripture say this
[2:13:54] and then the scriptures say that he said
[2:13:56] say but the problem was when the prophet
[2:13:58] s saying it was just too unusual it was
[2:14:01] too phenomenal it was something that
[2:14:02] they had never heard before so how could
[2:14:05] this man raised from the dead how could
[2:14:07] he I mean how could he say things like
[2:14:08] destroy this temple our razor I've never
[2:14:11] seen anybody do anything like that right
[2:14:13] he said they'd say this was all this was
[2:14:15] absolutely impossible but there they
[2:14:17] were talking to him on the third day the
[2:14:24] six-hour
[2:14:25] sermon that they heard this day and and
[2:14:30] as he was opening Scripture and just
[2:14:33] breaking you know the word and that's
[2:14:34] why I tell you I've been telling this on
[2:14:36] harping on this if you're gonna
[2:14:37] understand crashing you have to
[2:14:38] understand it from the Word of God you
[2:14:40] got to read your Bible if you want to
[2:14:41] know what he what he has done and what
[2:14:43] he is doing right now
[2:14:45] your Bible because that's where he
[2:14:47] promised it but here on the third day
[2:14:49] they're just they're just still moping
[2:14:51] alone they don't heard a six-hour sermon
[2:14:53] and Jesus just breaking scripture after
[2:14:55] Scripture down just just take it them
[2:14:57] right through everything
[2:14:58] this happened didn't that happen and
[2:15:00] then didn't they do this to him and the
[2:15:01] Bible said this and didn't they do that
[2:15:03] to Jesus and they just they just be
[2:15:05] going on amen that's the number of the
[2:15:06] truth but they finally get to the end of
[2:15:08] the day and they get to their their
[2:15:11] destination and they do something there
[2:15:13] you know and the destination say say
[2:15:15] Jesus was acting as if he's going to
[2:15:18] keep walking but they said no no no no
[2:15:20] no no don't go any further and where you
[2:15:22] all come in with us in 12 here tonight
[2:15:25] all he was waiting for was the
[2:15:28] invitation and I'm gonna tell you
[2:15:31] something a man you might be going
[2:15:32] through a lot of stuff and you're like
[2:15:34] but what Jesus is waiting for is an
[2:15:37] invitation for you to allow him to come
[2:15:39] in when you allowed him to come in he'll
[2:15:43] change your situation God can change any
[2:15:46] circumstance Oh
[2:15:52] any circumstance even if you were even
[2:15:56] if you had a if the judges pronounced
[2:16:00] the sentence on you to go go to go down
[2:16:02] for some time God can change it don't
[2:16:07] limit my God he's just waiting on the
[2:16:10] invitation and don't tell me what he
[2:16:12] can't do
[2:16:13] he can do it he can't the only thing he
[2:16:16] can't do his spell he was waiting on the
[2:16:21] invitation I mean these brothers finally
[2:16:24] invited Jesus in and they've been
[2:16:26] walking with him all day talking to him
[2:16:29] all day and when they finally invited
[2:16:31] him in there I lived on that third day
[2:16:34] of the resurrection they began to start
[2:16:36] eating and they began to break bread and
[2:16:38] they say you know man all that word
[2:16:40] you've been talking about we know you
[2:16:42] can pray why don't you pray over the
[2:16:45] meal and Jesus begin to pray over the
[2:16:49] meal and the Bible says that he broke
[2:16:51] bread and see there was nobody that
[2:16:55] could break brans the way geez
[2:16:59] broke bread see these brothers have seen
[2:17:03] the five thousand each they seen four
[2:17:07] thousand eat after Jesus broke bread
[2:17:10] right so so so just two of them he broke
[2:17:14] bread the same way he had done amongst
[2:17:17] the five thousand and amongst the four
[2:17:19] thousand and as soon as he broke bread
[2:17:21] the Bible City eyes came open no longer
[2:17:26] a man wasn't a man a discouragement but
[2:17:30] they had incidents in life something had
[2:17:32] happened to these boys that here the Sun
[2:17:36] was down it took them all day to get to
[2:17:38] the city
[2:17:39] but before you knew it they got like
[2:17:40] foot it and they took off running to go
[2:17:43] back into Jerusalem to tell them that
[2:17:46] the Lord was risen and when you come in
[2:17:48] contact with the Lord Jesus Christ and
[2:17:52] he does something for you in a no longer
[2:17:55] be a story in a no longer be a tradition
[2:18:02] but it becomes your life
[2:18:04] and you want to tell everybody that he
[2:18:08] is risen and all of that happened on the
[2:18:12] third day a lot of things happen on the
[2:18:18] third day they say sometimes three is a
[2:18:22] it's a charm and where people get that
[2:18:25] three is a charm from is because they
[2:18:27] look at these things in scripture of all
[2:18:29] these trees that happened on the third
[2:18:31] day what the Lord did on the third day
[2:18:33] on the third day so much as promised
[2:18:37] about this third day when God initiative
[2:18:39] initially established the third day and
[2:18:41] he put vegetation everything he said it
[2:18:43] was good it was the only day that he
[2:18:46] said it was good twice you know because
[2:18:48] he said it was good twice on that day
[2:18:50] you know what a Jewish tradition is that
[2:18:52] they try to get married on the third day
[2:18:54] they don't wait to weekend they want to
[2:18:58] get married on the third day so if I
[2:19:00] mean for them traditional I mean Sabbath
[2:19:04] would be Saturday for them so they
[2:19:06] looking for Sunday Monday Tuesday
[2:19:07] Tuesday a lot of weddings happen in
[2:19:09] Jerusalem or Israel because it's a third
[2:19:11] day miss that
[2:19:12] time when God said it was good twice and
[2:19:16] why would God established that way back
[2:19:19] in the beginning it was good on the
[2:19:21] third day he said it twice because he
[2:19:24] knew he would rise on the third day
[2:19:29] that's when life began on the third day
[2:19:33] and resurrection eternal life began for
[2:19:36] mankind on the third day I don't know
[2:19:42] what there you own but you better get to
[2:19:44] the third day and you better get there
[2:19:47] fast cuz we ain't got much time
[2:19:52] happy used to everybody god bless you
[2:20:02] let's have a word of Prayer father
[2:20:15] we're grateful for your living we're
[2:20:22] grateful for your your dying but we're
[2:20:27] even more grateful for your resurrection
[2:20:32] the scripture tells us that if there
[2:20:34] were no resurrection then B we would be
[2:20:39] without hope you know because of that
[2:20:43] third day because of the the grandness
[2:20:45] of it death has lost its sting the grave
[2:20:50] has lost its victory think of loved ones
[2:20:57] that have set next to us here and the
[2:21:01] church listen to the gospel we go to
[2:21:03] church with them and all grow up in
[2:21:06] church together and share together there
[2:21:09] come a time where you call a loved one's
[2:21:11] home but God the peace that we have is
[2:21:17] that our loved ones died in you and in
[2:21:22] dying in you we know that they'll rise
[2:21:25] again to the newness of life the
[2:21:32] question now belongs to us are we ready
[2:21:36] got to have our own personal calories to
[2:21:40] die to ourselves to dr. I foster dr. our
[2:21:43] ideas to die to our ways and allow you
[2:21:47] to come alive inside of us Lord my
[2:21:53] prayers today let somebody experience a
[2:21:57] true third day a resurrection where you
[2:22:02] can look upon them and say oh yes it is
[2:22:05] good the same way you did there at the
[2:22:08] beginning reminded of your prophet
[2:22:11] talking about the young lady that went
[2:22:13] to the altar once and she wanted to pray
[2:22:17] she has some things she was dealing with
[2:22:19] addictions that she was battling and she
[2:22:22] prayed and and she cried some tears and
[2:22:25] she did all of that but then she got
[2:22:26] right back up from y'all
[2:22:27] she said okay I'm ready to go and profit
[2:22:29] looked at and say oh no sister you ain't
[2:22:31] got it yet you ain't got it yet no no no
[2:22:35] that's not it you haven't you have not
[2:22:37] reached God yet and she got back on her
[2:22:41] knee that she kept praying and Lord
[2:22:44] finally something happened to her in
[2:22:45] that prayer meeting that he could he
[2:22:48] could say oh now you got it and and he
[2:22:50] knew that no matter what storms that she
[2:22:52] faced from that day forward she'd be
[2:22:56] okay God some of us need that type of
[2:22:58] experience with you we've tried to do
[2:23:02] things and it hasn't worked out but it's
[2:23:04] only because we have not come to a place
[2:23:06] of complete surrender my prayer is that
[2:23:09] somebody would take this moment this
[2:23:11] time to invite you in as clearpass and
[2:23:15] his friend did they they took time to
[2:23:17] invite you in and once you've got behind
[2:23:19] closed doors God you did something that
[2:23:23] only they could recognize
[2:23:28] Lord Jesus
[2:23:31] we know you're living we want to
[2:23:34] experience you once more
[2:23:37] we want to experience your life we want
[2:23:41] to experience your peace we want to
[2:23:44] experience your hope and you're the only
[2:23:46] one that can offer it to us so deal with
