[43:28] amen thank y'all um we're we we'll go
[43:31] into the word of the Lord for tonight uh
[43:35] I um just
[43:38] um had in my heart just a little
[43:40] something that I wanted to share uh with
[43:42] our young people and one of the things
[43:44] that
[43:46] um uh I want to just say is you know the
[43:50] the Lord certainly has given us uh
[43:53] opportunities to go different places and
[43:55] and preach
[43:57] um to young people and um my uh my
[44:01] thought is that um uh we thank God for
[44:05] that but we also thank God for preaching
[44:07] to the young people at
[44:09] home amen because uh you all are are
[44:13] very very important to me and it's very
[44:15] easy you know for me to uh we got so I I
[44:19] I hate to say it like this but we we
[44:21] have a number of ministers in the church
[44:23] now we used to didn't have nobody but me
[44:26] and uh now we have a number of ministers
[44:28] in the church um and and it's very easy
[44:30] for me just to kind of pull away and
[44:32] just let somebody else kind of take it
[44:35] uh which I enjoy doing it but every once
[44:37] in a while the Lord will inspire me to
[44:39] say something to the young people and uh
[44:41] and I want to do that amen by the grace
[44:43] of God tonight uh so I'm going to just
[44:46] read a scripture uh and um then we will
[44:51] um just just take it from there I want
[44:54] to turn to Hebrews chapter 11 and verse
[45:06] 23 Hebrews 11 uh verse 23 uh reads as
[45:11] follows says by
[45:13] faith
[45:16] Moses uh when he was born was hid three
[45:19] months of his parents because they saw
[45:23] he was a proper child and they were not
[45:26] afraid of the king's
[45:28] commandment by faith Moses when he was
[45:31] come to
[45:33] years refused to be called the son of
[45:36] Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to
[45:40] suffer Affliction with the people of God
[45:43] than to enjoy the pleasure of sin for a
[45:46] season uh verse 26 says esteeming the
[45:51] reproach of Christ greater riches than
[45:54] the treasures in Egypt
[45:56] for he had respect unto the recompense
[45:58] of the reward by faith he forsook Egypt
[46:04] not fearing the Wrath of the king for he
[46:06] endured as seeing him who is invisible
[46:11] amen let's just bow in a word of prayer
[46:13] father we thank you for uh the
[46:15] opportunity to read the scripture Lord
[46:18] and we pray that the Holy Ghost will
[46:20] come and uh make it relevant for where
[46:23] we are right now speak to every heart
[46:25] that as present those that are uh joined
[46:28] online may they receive Lord tonight as
[46:31] well and those that would listen to the
[46:34] uh recording later may they receive as
[46:36] well father from the word is our prayer
[46:38] it's in Jesus name we ask it amen amen
[46:42] you can be seated uh in the presence of
[46:44] the Lord we want to just take amen our
[46:48] title tonight
[46:50] esteeming the reproach of Christ amen
[46:54] esteeming the reproach of Christ and
[46:58] just a little statement here in this um
[47:02] first quote that I want to read out of
[47:04] why are we not a
[47:06] denomination it's a statement that
[47:08] brother brandham makes there and um and
[47:11] and this is really an encouragement to
[47:13] the parents I want to thank the parents
[47:15] for a couple things one is bringing your
[47:18] children to youth service amen and then
[47:22] there are other parents that might not
[47:23] have kids here but you still come and
[47:25] support support amen Our Youth and it
[47:28] makes a big difference amen and um you
[47:31] know the I guess the little uh subtopic
[47:35] that I'm kind of talking uh tonight is
[47:37] on choices and you know when I was
[47:40] coming up we as a young man and and in
[47:43] in church uh for our young people when I
[47:45] was coming up we had uh a choice to make
[47:47] on Friday night uh our pastor
[47:50] established services on Wednesday night
[47:53] Friday night uh Sunday morning and then
[47:55] we we also had Sunday night service amen
[47:58] we had four four Services a week but
[48:00] Friday night was always a little
[48:02] challenge especially when I became a
[48:03] teenager because uh we had to either go
[48:07] to church the choice was either go to
[48:09] church or go to a football game or a
[48:13] basketball game amen whatever sport they
[48:16] were doing at school at the time we have
[48:18] the choice to try to choose which one
[48:20] that we were going to go to and uh I
[48:22] lived in a house where uh my parents
[48:25] made made it a little easy for us to
[48:26] make that choice amen it was uh we knew
[48:29] it was going to church and uh you know
[48:31] and we got to a point where actually uh
[48:35] we it didn't bother us that we were not
[48:36] going to the football game anymore amen
[48:40] I I used to be a football player and and
[48:42] it didn't bother me I didn't play
[48:43] football anymore I was I was okay I was
[48:46] satisfied serving the lord amen I I
[48:49] reached a point in my life where that
[48:51] was I realized that was what I was born
[48:53] to do is to serve the Lord so amen I
[48:56] want to encourage you young people you
[48:57] know the next generation is coming up
[48:59] and y'all have to come to the same same
[49:01] same spot where you realize that serving
[49:03] the lord is everything sir amen it means
[49:06] more than anything this life could ever
[49:08] bring anything you can accomplish if you
[49:10] don't have Christ in the midst of it
[49:12] then it really don't mean much amen so
[49:15] you know we want to encourage you to
[49:16] esteem the reproach of Christ esteem the
[49:19] reproach of Christ this statement here
[49:21] out of the message why are we not a
[49:23] denomination brother brandom is um is is
[49:26] talking to a brother it says it's
[49:27] certainly good brother Jeff to get to
[49:29] shake uh your hand back here and also to
[49:33] hear your boy sing that song and you
[49:35] play I kind of like that the Father and
[49:37] Son don't you like that bring up a child
[49:40] in the way that it should go that's
[49:41] right Mr Gunther uh you know that's
[49:45] what's right both of you look at this
[49:47] statement says bring up a child in the
[49:49] way that it should go now this is
[49:52] important parents have to this is a
[49:54] parents uh responsibility to bring up
[49:57] the child in the way that it should go
[50:01] amen if my parents would have been
[50:02] taking me to the football game rather
[50:04] than taking me to church what are they
[50:06] actually bringing me up in hello right I
[50:09] mean the parents got to be one to make
[50:11] the decision first they got to make the
[50:12] choice which is more important for that
[50:14] child right so my parents didn't take me
[50:17] to the game they brought me to church
[50:19] right bring up a child in the way that
[50:21] he that it should go and when he gets
[50:24] old look at this it'll not depart and
[50:28] that's true there may be some times that
[50:33] he may depart from
[50:36] it amen and and and some of some of some
[50:39] of the older parents here that got uh
[50:41] young adults we see there there may be a
[50:43] time that our children may depart from
[50:45] it but we know what we did when we were
[50:46] younger and when our children was
[50:48] younger we brought them up in the ways
[50:50] of God so there may be there may come
[50:52] times where they may depart from it but
[50:55] it won't depart from him I'm so happy
[50:58] about that when we bring y'all into
[51:00] environments like this I mean you may
[51:02] depart from it someday but this will not
[51:04] depart from you you going to remember
[51:07] these
[51:08] moments that's right and it's it's up to
[51:11] us as parents that create these type of
[51:12] moments for you to remember I love it
[51:15] when we get together in my family we
[51:16] just start talking about
[51:18] church things we did in church remember
[51:21] went to this service we went we went to
[51:22] that and remember brother so and so did
[51:24] this and sister so so did remember I
[51:26] mean that's all we talk about it's it
[51:28] keeps the presence of God around the
[51:29] house Hallelujah bring them up in the
[51:33] way that they should go now they might
[51:35] depart but it won't depart from them and
[51:37] at some point in time that thing will
[51:39] wrestle them and bring them right back
[51:40] to where they need to be
[51:42] Hallelujah brother random said at early
[51:45] training whatever he's been brought up
[51:47] to do it'll certainly stay with him oh
[51:51] my all right all right uh on on
[51:53] Wednesday night brother Quinton Jr did a
[51:55] wonderful job speaking to us
[51:57] expectations and Perfection and uh he
[52:00] made a statement there and you know uh
[52:02] while he was Ministry says
[52:05] weaknesses um the the weakness that we
[52:07] have is the ability to make
[52:10] choices H uh the the weakness that that
[52:13] that's inside all of us is that ability
[52:16] to actually make a choice you actually
[52:17] might think that's a strength but it's a
[52:20] weakness and the reason it's a weakness
[52:22] is because Satan can use that against
[52:24] you Yes actually making the wrong choice
[52:28] and Satan can use that against you
[52:30] making the wrong choice can actually be
[52:33] set you for
[52:35] years it can mess up your life or delay
[52:38] certain things in your life when you
[52:39] make the wrong choice right but he he
[52:41] also made the statement says when we
[52:43] make our choice for God it becomes a
[52:49] strength choice no longer becomes a
[52:51] weakness because we got God in front of
[52:53] us amen and now that Choice becomes a
[52:56] strength now I want to just read a a
[52:58] quote it' be somewhat lengthy here but I
[53:00] think it'll be a blessing to us brother
[53:01] brandom says something to a side of the
[53:03] sermon the choosing of a bride I will
[53:06] read and then I may inject a little bit
[53:07] here and there as we go along and the
[53:09] young people stay with me tonight we're
[53:11] talking about esteeming the reproach of
[53:13] Christ it's a choice to esteem the
[53:16] reproach of Christ Moses made that
[53:18] choice now look at this he says in many
[53:21] things of life we are given a choice the
[53:24] way of life
[53:26] itself uh is a choice if we have a right
[53:30] to make our own way choose our own way
[53:36] uh that we want to live education is a
[53:40] choice we can choose whether we're going
[53:42] to be educated or whether we're not
[53:45] going to be educated now you know I I've
[53:48] I've I I get the opportunity to uh to
[53:50] work with young people I've worked with
[53:51] them for a number of years and given
[53:53] advice to different ones and you you
[53:55] know and when it comes to education one
[53:56] of the things I like to say especially
[53:58] you you young people living right here
[54:01] in Florida this is one of the most
[54:03] expensive places that you could ever
[54:06] live in the
[54:07] world Florida south Florida right is one
[54:11] of the most expensive places that you
[54:12] could ever live and and often times amen
[54:15] you got to understand that the education
[54:18] is is is is when you when you go get the
[54:20] education what that is it's putting you
[54:21] in position to compete with other people
[54:25] that are going for the same job that
[54:26] you're going for and and when people are
[54:29] going through their resumees you you
[54:31] fill out an application they fill out an
[54:33] application and when they when they when
[54:35] they go through the application they
[54:36] look to see what level of Education
[54:38] different people have and then they
[54:39] start weeding them out well this one got
[54:42] a bachelor okay they going to go the yes
[54:44] P this one don't have a bachelor they go
[54:46] to no power this one got this degree
[54:48] they go in the yes pile this one got
[54:50] this that go in the no pile I was a boss
[54:52] I had to do it that way you have to
[54:54] justify why you making that decision why
[54:56] to hire certain person so sometimes
[54:58] education is what's used to put you in a
[55:00] position so you can compete with other
[55:03] people hallelujah glory to God now I
[55:07] understand School may not be for
[55:09] everybody it may not be but if school is
[55:11] not for you get a trade that's right
[55:14] right but you got to do something to
[55:16] make
[55:16] money right you got to do something to
[55:19] take care of your family right so so
[55:21] School may not be for everybody but you
[55:23] got to find what's right for you and do
[55:25] it to the best of your
[55:27] ability all right all right he goes on
[55:31] to say this he says that choice that we
[55:33] have right and wrong is a choice every
[55:37] man every woman boy and girl has to
[55:39] choose whether they're going to try to
[55:42] live right or not live right now brother
[55:45] brandom's son his his his his son Billy
[55:48] Paul just went home to be with the Lord
[55:49] but Billy Paul was a teenager at one
[55:52] time and uh and when he was a teenager
[55:55] he was really getting into some rough
[55:56] things he was getting his daddy was the
[56:01] prophet and yet he find himself getting
[56:03] into things and that I give the parents
[56:05] a little little encouragement right I
[56:08] mean yes your child can go through
[56:11] brother Billy Paul went through I mean
[56:13] he was lying to his daddy about smoking
[56:15] I believe right he's lying lying to him
[56:18] about smoking and his daddy is a
[56:21] prophet and when his daddy son you've
[56:23] been smoking no that son I saw you I saw
[56:28] you out there smoking right I mean so so
[56:31] so no no sist him trying to uh lie about
[56:34] it but but brother brother brother
[56:35] Brandon when he say say Billy I see you
[56:37] doing this I see you doing that now
[56:38] brother brother brandom could not save
[56:41] his son that's right brother Brandon
[56:43] could only pray for his son brother
[56:45] Brandon could do nothing but try to
[56:46] teach his son and one day he told his
[56:48] son stretch your arms out like this yes
[56:50] yes yes it says when he stretch said now
[56:53] look look to look look to to the left he
[56:55] said if you go left you're leaving God
[56:58] you go right you're going the right way
[57:00] you're going towards God he said the
[57:02] further you go left is the further you
[57:05] got to come
[57:09] back right so so you don't want to you
[57:12] when you stretch out like that watch how
[57:14] far you go in this direction because
[57:16] it's going to take that much more to
[57:19] come back in this
[57:22] direction so while you're standing there
[57:24] at the crossroads of life always try to
[57:26] make the right choice make the choice
[57:27] that's going to lead you in the right
[57:30] direction Goden he says this every man
[57:34] woman boy and girl has to choose whether
[57:36] they're going to try to live right or
[57:38] not live right esteem and the reproach
[57:40] of Christ esteem and the reproach he
[57:43] says um it's a choice choice is a great
[57:46] thing your Eternal destination is a
[57:49] choice I like that your Eternal dation
[57:51] you got you have to choose whether
[57:53] you're going to serve God or not serve
[57:55] God it's not just because Mama serves
[57:58] God or daddy serves God you have to
[57:59] choose whether you're going to serve God
[58:01] or not serve God it's your choice it's
[58:04] your choice
[58:06] look he says um your Eternal destination
[58:10] is a choice and maybe tonight some of
[58:12] you will make that choice of where
[58:14] you'll spend eternity before this
[58:16] service Ends Tonight there will be one
[58:19] that if you turn God
[58:21] down
[58:23] uh many times there'll be one time that
[58:27] you'll turn them down the last
[58:29] time and when brother Brandon makes that
[58:31] statement my mind goes to this young
[58:33] lady that sat in
[58:35] church she was a Deacon's daughter and
[58:39] um and as she sat in
[58:40] church um brother Brandon was making an
[58:43] altar call and he says you know I just
[58:44] feel like somebody need to come and make
[58:47] their uh make a uh just repent and and
[58:50] make things right with God you know and
[58:52] I he like I I don't want to go further
[58:54] in the service I just think somebody
[58:55] need to come and and he just kept saying
[58:57] kept saying they say sister I think God
[58:59] is dealing with you to come and the the
[59:01] young lady say um I'm not going up there
[59:04] to the altar I'm not doing that you know
[59:06] and and and said have you to know I'm a
[59:08] Deacon's daughter you don't you don't
[59:09] embarrass me like that in front of
[59:11] everybody don't do that to me so she
[59:13] didn't come to the altar well a year
[59:14] later brother Brandon goes through that
[59:16] same city and he's um and he's walking
[59:19] down the street and guess who's on the
[59:20] street that same young lady this time
[59:22] she's not in church this time time she
[59:25] actually walking down the street with a
[59:26] bottle in her hand drinking liquor my
[59:29] God and and and her her she was so bad

[59:48] came that night but I didn't want to
[59:49] come I was too embarrassed to come say
[59:51] you want something to drink preach here
[59:53] this young lady that was telling the
[59:55] prophet not to call up that now she's so
[59:57] bad off she's offering the prophet
[1:00:00] something to
[1:00:01] drink but brother brandom said don't you

[1:00:05] anything like that she's like she's like
[1:00:06] well preacher I need to tell you

[1:00:11] uh and now that I didn't uh you know I'm
[1:00:14] so bad off my heart is so cold towards
[1:00:17] God see she made the wrong choice she's
[1:00:20] way out here now it's hard for her to
[1:00:22] come back and she got that way and left
[1:00:24] Le than a
[1:00:26] year she became that hard in less than a
[1:00:31] year well here she uh she said my heart
[1:00:34] is so hard towards God God that I could
[1:00:36] see my own Mother's Soul frying in hell
[1:00:40] like a pancake and I would laugh at that
[1:00:44] brother brandom say sis you shouldn't be
[1:00:46] you know you you you you you shouldn't
[1:00:48] be like that she could not find a way to
[1:00:52] repent to make her make her way back to
[1:00:54] this this path that she should have been
[1:00:55] going on she made the wrong choice One
[1:00:58] Night in church it changed her Eternal
[1:01:06] destination one time you'll turn God
[1:01:09] down many times but there'll be one time
[1:01:11] that you turn them down for the last
[1:01:12] time there there's a there's a line
[1:01:14] between mercy and judgment and it's a
[1:01:16] dangerous thing for man or woman boy or
[1:01:19] girl to step across that line for
[1:01:21] there's no return when you step across
[1:01:24] that deadline so tonight it might be the
[1:01:26] same it might be it might be the time
[1:01:28] that many will make their decision where
[1:01:31] they'll spend the endless eternity let's

[1:04:16] Christian you have a choice of the
[1:04:17] church here here in America so far that
[1:04:19] you can go to that is your own American
[1:04:21] privilege to choose any church you want
[1:04:23] to belong to that's that is a choice you
[1:04:25] don't have to go to any of them if you
[1:04:27] don't want to it's a choice but if you

[1:04:42] that's what our democracy is every man
[1:04:44] can choose for himself freedom of
[1:04:46] religion and that is a great thing God
[1:04:48] help us to keep it as long as we can now
[1:04:50] watch this you have a you also have a
[1:04:52] choice as to whether uh when you choose
[1:04:54] this church you can choose whether you

[1:04:57] choose a church that will guide you to
[1:05:00] your Eternal
[1:05:03] destination here is the criteria amen
[1:05:06] for when you're choosing a church it's
[1:05:07] not whether they let you do this or that
[1:05:11] amen will this church help you get to
[1:05:13] your Eternal destination yes sir I
[1:05:17] remember brother Mike when he first came
[1:05:18] to this church years ago he says Pastor
[1:05:20] don't teach me how to sin I know how to
[1:05:24] do that already right says I want a
[1:05:27] church that's going to tell me what's
[1:05:28] wrong and tell me what's right because
[1:05:30] I'm trying to make it to Heaven see you
[1:05:32] need a church that's going to help you
[1:05:34] get to your Eternal destination are they
[1:05:37] preaching the word amen amen amen if
[1:05:41] they're not preaching the word you
[1:05:42] better run for your life amen all right
[1:05:46] all right you can choose a church that
[1:05:48] has a certain Creed that you might think
[1:05:51] that Creed is just what you want or the
[1:05:53] other church has their Creed and then
[1:05:56] there then there is the word of God you
[1:05:58] have a choice of you have to make your
[1:06:00] choice there's an unwritten law Among Us
[1:06:02] of choosen I believe it was Elijah one
[1:06:04] time upon Mount Carmel after the
[1:06:06] showdown in a great hour of Crisis that
[1:06:09] we're just about to come to right now
[1:06:10] perhaps it may be to you or I tonight
[1:06:13] that we make a choice like the mount
[1:06:15] carel experience frankly I think it's
[1:06:17] going on worldwide now but there will
[1:06:19] soon come a time where that you have to
[1:06:22] make a choice and I'm not carel the
[1:06:24] choice was given to children of Israel
[1:06:26] choose ye this day uh uh uh I mean uh if
[1:06:29] God if God is God serve him but if baale
[1:06:32] be God serve him right and they had to
[1:06:35] come they had to make a choice that
[1:06:36] which God they were going to follow and
[1:06:39] and and and Eli just say the god that
[1:06:40] answered by fire just let him be God and
[1:06:43] they actually accepted they accepted
[1:06:47] amen his his his um challenge they
[1:06:50] accepted it the god that answer about
[1:06:51] fire kid that's going to be the god well
[1:06:54] God answer by fire and I don't think the
[1:06:56] hell to their word they let go of that
[1:06:59] God later on we all got to make a choice
[1:07:02] as to whether we're going to follow or
[1:07:04] not follow there's some things that you
[1:07:06] can't choose one is you can't choose
[1:07:08] your
[1:07:09] family you can't choose your family you
[1:07:13] were born into a particular family God
[1:07:15] or orchestrated and ordained that and
[1:07:17] ain't no sense you getting mad at God
[1:07:19] about what family you was born
[1:07:21] into God knows what where where where
[1:07:24] where the place you can't choose your
[1:07:25] family you can't choose your
[1:07:30] height nothing you can do to get taller
[1:07:32] than what you are amen amen sisters
[1:07:36] might try to wear heels to get up there
[1:07:38] but once you take your heels off you're
[1:07:39] going right back to the same height that
[1:07:41] you were you can't choose your height
[1:07:44] you can't choose your height can't
[1:07:46] choose how many hairs you're going to
[1:07:47] have in your
[1:07:50] head and God knows every number of hairs
[1:07:52] that you got in your head and see you
[1:07:54] can't choose it you can't choose your
[1:07:57] genetic
[1:07:58] makeup amen you are who you are yes sir
[1:08:03] you can't choose it God God actually
[1:08:05] planned it for you to be that way you
[1:08:08] can't say I wish I was I would no no no
[1:08:10] no no no no you you I wish you were
[1:08:13] satisfied with who God made
[1:08:17] you some of the things that you can
[1:08:19] choose you can choose your
[1:08:22] friends you can choose who you're going
[1:08:24] to hang with and who you're not going to
[1:08:25] hang with right you can choose your
[1:08:28] church like brother Rand said you can
[1:08:30] choose your spouse who you're going to
[1:08:31] get married to you can choose to lie or
[1:08:34] not to
[1:08:35] lie yes sir it's a
[1:08:38] choice uh you can choose to uh you can
[1:08:41] choose to say yes or no to trouble and
[1:08:44] you see trouble when it's coming you
[1:08:46] have a you have a choice where you can
[1:08:47] say yes to that or no to that yes sir
[1:08:50] you can choose to serve God or not serve
[1:08:52] him you can choose to follow God or not
[1:08:55] follow him these are choices that you
[1:08:58] can make here we read a scripture and I
[1:09:00] want you to notice something we read in
[1:09:03] Hebrews chapter 11 uh we'll go back and
[1:09:06] and read uh this again Hebrews 11 and I
[1:09:10] want you to notice a couple things there
[1:09:12] there's choices been made all through
[1:09:13] this scripture verse 23 says by faith
[1:09:16] Moses when he was born was hid 3 months
[1:09:19] of his parents now the Bible say by
[1:09:21] faith Moses but we realize it was and
[1:09:24] Moses making the choice to be hidden it
[1:09:27] was his parents that made the choice of
[1:09:29] what to do with Moses in order to hide
[1:09:31] him from pharaoh who want to kill all
[1:09:33] the children right so you got to have
[1:09:36] parents that'll help you make the right
[1:09:38] choice right by faith Moses when he was
[1:09:41] born was hid three months of his parents
[1:09:44] because they saw he was a proper child
[1:09:47] and they were they were they were not
[1:09:49] afraid of the king's commandments so it
[1:09:51] was moses' parents that decided to put
[1:09:54] him in the Nile River and send him down
[1:09:56] the river not knowing what was going to
[1:09:58] happen with their decision watch this
[1:10:00] watch this by faith
[1:10:03] Moses when he was come to years this is
[1:10:06] a choice that he made I like this when
[1:10:09] he from when he when when he come to
[1:10:11] years refused to be called the son of
[1:10:13] Pharaoh's daughter so now uh just in
[1:10:15] between those two verses there's a lot
[1:10:17] that happened in Moses life right one of
[1:10:20] the things that happens is that when his
[1:10:21] parents release him into the River
[1:10:24] somehow God orchestrated that that
[1:10:27] basket would end up right in Pharaoh's
[1:10:29] Court Pharaoh's daughter got hold his
[1:10:32] basket and took Moses as her own child
[1:10:35] went looking for a a a a nurse to raise
[1:10:38] his child and hired Moses's mother as
[1:10:40] the nurse to raise the child in
[1:10:43] Pharaoh's heart I house I like this that
[1:10:45] Pharaoh I mean Moses mama got paid to
[1:10:48] raise her own child that's
[1:10:52] right God know how to do things she made
[1:10:56] the right
[1:10:57] choice as she's raising Moses and
[1:11:00] teaching him the things of God she has
[1:11:02] this ability to seow certain seeds in
[1:11:05] Moses as he's coming up and she's
[1:11:07] telling him what his true identity is
[1:11:10] that he's not a son of pharaoh but I'm
[1:11:13] your real mother right and and and your
[1:11:15] father's amram but but you we had to we
[1:11:18] had to do this because of the Edict of
[1:11:19] the king that they were going to kill
[1:11:20] all the B this is why we had to do this
[1:11:22] but Moses God is in control it's okay
[1:11:24] well here Moses gets to a point of life
[1:11:26] and he's raised as Pharaoh's son Moses
[1:11:29] is next in line to become the next
[1:11:32] Pharaoh he he has he has everything that
[1:11:35] the world can offer him it is in his
[1:11:37] hands but Moses makes a choice sir by
[1:11:41] faith of
[1:11:42] Moses when he come to
[1:11:46] years maybe as a
[1:11:48] teenager he
[1:11:50] refuses to be called the son of a
[1:11:53] Pharaoh's
[1:11:54] daughter Moses makes this Choice I'm I'm
[1:11:57] not Pharaoh's da I mean I'm not I'm not
[1:12:01] you're this is you're not the mom but
[1:12:04] this is my mother over here I am a
[1:12:06] Hebrew I'm not an Egyptian I'm a Hebrew
[1:12:10] and as as young people you got to come
[1:12:12] to a spot where you realize I'm
[1:12:14] not in this world all right I'm not I'm
[1:12:19] I'm not I'm not like them I'm a
[1:12:22] Christian
[1:12:24] and it's not my mama's a Christian or my
[1:12:26] dad's no I'm a Christian right and the
[1:12:29] reason I don't do this I don't do that
[1:12:31] is because I'm a Christian not because
[1:12:35] my mama said don't do it and my daddy
[1:12:37] said don't do it and my pastor said
[1:12:39] don't no I'm a Christian that's why I
[1:12:41] don't do these things you have to you
[1:12:44] have to esteem the reproach of
[1:12:46] Christ look at this the next verse amen
[1:12:50] verse 25 says choosing rather
[1:12:54] to suffer Affliction with the people of
[1:12:56] God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin
[1:12:58] for a season and I think I I I mentioned
[1:13:01] this early when you come to Christ
[1:13:02] actually things get harder not
[1:13:04] easier but you have to make the choice
[1:13:07] that I'm going to follow Jesus amen no
[1:13:10] matter what it looks like no matter what
[1:13:11] it feels like no matter what comes
[1:13:13] against me I'm still going to follow
[1:13:14] Jesus sir and sometimes God allows you
[1:13:17] to go through certain things in your
[1:13:18] life because all of us think that it's
[1:13:20] supposed to be a flower bed of ease as
[1:13:22] Christians that's not true if Jesus had
[1:13:25] to go to a cross what you think we going
[1:13:26] to have to go
[1:13:30] through verse 20 26 I'm sorry uh yeah
[1:13:34] yeah verse
[1:13:36] 26 notice the the verse here EST
[1:13:40] steeming the reproach of Christ greater
[1:13:43] riches than the treasures in
[1:13:45] Egypt for you have respect to the
[1:13:48] recompense of the reward and just bear
[1:13:51] with me just for a moment here two
[1:13:53] esteem is to respect or to
[1:13:56] admire I want you to get this to admire
[1:14:00] the reproach of Christ I I you know
[1:14:03] young people sometimes we admire the
[1:14:05] wrong things we admire other kids that
[1:14:09] are in the world and some of the things
[1:14:11] that they're getting and and some of the
[1:14:12] things they're we admire that we admire
[1:14:16] that young lady that's getting all that
[1:14:18] attention or that young boy getting all
[1:14:19] that attention we admire that but we
[1:14:21] admire the wrong things we're supposed
[1:14:23] to admire the sufferings of Christ yes
[1:14:27] sir the reproach of Christ we're
[1:14:29] supposed to admire that yes sir look at
[1:14:32] this reproach is is
[1:14:36] scoffs for the sake of Christ or that
[1:14:38] means to be picked on to be picked at
[1:14:42] not accepted by the world sometimes not
[1:14:45] accepted by your friends and sometimes
[1:14:48] not even accepted by your
[1:14:51] family Moses chose to be not accepted by
[1:14:56] everybody else in order to be accepted
[1:14:59] by Christ yes sir and young people you
[1:15:02] have to choose to to be not accepted by
[1:15:04] others in order to be accepted by Christ
[1:15:07] that's true amen we esteem the reproach
[1:15:10] of Christ watch the words here
[1:15:14] though the Bible says esteeming the
[1:15:16] reproach of Christ and here's the the
[1:15:18] the the thing about this Christ was not
[1:15:21] even born at the time Moses was
[1:15:26] born Moses was on the earth well before
[1:15:29] Jesus Christ ever came to the Earth
[1:15:31] right but yet the scripture says that he
[1:15:34] esteemed the reproach of Christ in Moses
[1:15:37] day when he was making his choice when
[1:15:41] he chose not to follow the ways of Egypt
[1:15:43] that I'm I'm not Pharaoh's uh daughter's
[1:15:46] son I am I'm amram and yosh's son I am a
[1:15:50] child of God I'm an Israelite I'm not an
[1:15:53] Egyptian when Moses made that choice he
[1:15:55] was saying he was he was esteeming the
[1:15:57] reproach of Christ even though Christ
[1:15:59] had not been born at that
[1:16:02] time the reason that he can the the
[1:16:04] Bible can say this because Jesus Christ
[1:16:06] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:16:08] and every choice that was being made in
[1:16:10] the Old Testament by different followers
[1:16:14] they were esteeming the reproach of
[1:16:16] Christ and let me tell you something
[1:16:18] when we make a choice to follow Christ
[1:16:20] in this day we're also doing the same
[1:16:22] thing mes mes did we esteem the reproach
[1:16:26] of Christ I'm not talking about serving
[1:16:29] God because your mama served God or your
[1:16:31] daddy served God or your pastor serve
[1:16:33] God I'm talking about you having your
[1:16:34] own personal relationship with
[1:16:39] God and it don't matter how old you
[1:16:44] are how young you are you can have a
[1:16:47] personal
[1:16:48] relationship with God
[1:16:50] am amen
[1:16:54] here we look at uh just a few examples
[1:16:58] in scriptures and you know it wasn't
[1:17:00] just Moses
[1:17:02] here I like I like this brother random
[1:17:05] just made a statement way back in Moses
[1:17:07] time it was still Christ that scripture
[1:17:08] it was still Christ that's why the bible
[1:17:10] say that but uh Adam and Eve when they
[1:17:14] made a choice to eat from the the Tree
[1:17:16] of Life they had the choice to either
[1:17:18] eat from the Tree of Life or the tree of
[1:17:20] knowledge good and evil God told them
[1:17:21] not to eat from that tree but they had
[1:17:22] the choice
[1:17:23] and uh if they M if they ate from that
[1:17:25] tree of knowledge good and evil then it
[1:17:26] would bring death into you know and and
[1:17:29] and and we're all experiencing that now
[1:17:31] but uh when they had the ability to eat
[1:17:34] from the Tree of Life that was actually
[1:17:36] eating from
[1:17:38] Christ they had the ability to eat from
[1:17:41] Christ and always have I mean just you
[1:17:44] talk about having life and life more
[1:17:45] abundantly it's only when you serve God
[1:17:47] that you get that type of
[1:17:51] life I've seen many many in my day that
[1:17:54] have uh left the Lord and and they
[1:17:57] thought they was doing good on their own
[1:17:59] for a good while it seemed like they was
[1:18:00] going very well but you talk I'm going
[1:18:02] tell you something that the scripture
[1:18:03] says the way of a
[1:18:08] transgressor is hard somebody going
[1:18:11] against the word of God life will it may
[1:18:13] seem like it's going good but somewhere
[1:18:16] that scripture going to catch up with
[1:18:18] you it might take years but that
[1:18:20] scripture going to catch up with you and
[1:18:22] and the way of transgressor going to
[1:18:23] become really really hard you're going
[1:18:25] to be trying to figure out what is going
[1:18:26] on is right there in the word you
[1:18:28] transgressing against God's word now
[1:18:30] life has to be hard for you can't make
[1:18:32] ends
[1:18:33] meet
[1:18:35] amen look Adam and Eve had to make a
[1:18:39] choice Abraham when he chose to to leave
[1:18:42] the land of ER and dwell in the plains
[1:18:44] of mam he made a choice and that choice
[1:18:48] was for Christ you see we can say that
[1:18:51] because lot had to make a Cho choice at
[1:18:53] that time too and lot made a choice
[1:18:55] where he like I ain't dwelling here in
[1:18:57] the plains of mam I want to go down here
[1:18:59] to the city of Sodom I want to go to
[1:19:01] gamorra and lot looked at the lights of
[1:19:03] the city he thought oh man this is so
[1:19:05] great but did not realize the impact it
[1:19:08] would have on his family later
[1:19:11] on young people the choices that you're
[1:19:13] making right now are going to have
[1:19:14] impact on your family later on you seow
[1:19:18] seeds for what's going to come up after
[1:19:20] you oh yes sir that's right
[1:19:23] and now now when lot went down there and
[1:19:25] and I don't know the Bible does not tell
[1:19:27] us this we don't know whether lot had
[1:19:29] children when he went down into Sodom we
[1:19:32] don't know that but what we do I mean
[1:19:34] him and his wife went down there that's
[1:19:35] all that we probably got but but we
[1:19:37] don't know about him having children
[1:19:38] maybe the children were born in Sodom
[1:19:40] and they were born in a certain
[1:19:42] condition they were B born in a certain
[1:19:45] situation and when the children been
[1:19:47] born like that in that situation it
[1:19:49] impacted them they had some real
[1:19:51] problems yes sir and in their
[1:19:54] house but it was because a daddy made
[1:19:57] the wrong
[1:20:00] choice it affected his wife his wife was
[1:20:02] so bad you know brother brandom actually
[1:20:04] said that lot had grandchildren that
[1:20:07] died in
[1:20:08] Sodom Lord and I was trying to figure
[1:20:10] out how do he have
[1:20:11] grandchildren where where you know and
[1:20:14] and and and but when you go back you
[1:20:15] read the scripture because we know that
[1:20:16] the the angel got lied out and his and
[1:20:18] his two daughters came out and um uh but
[1:20:21] the wife she actually turned and looked
[1:20:23] back and when she turned and looked back
[1:20:24] she turned into salt right so how did
[1:20:27] how did he have grandchildren well the
[1:20:28] Bible actually say the angel went down
[1:20:30] there and uh uh to lot to try to get lot
[1:20:33] out and it says do you have here
[1:20:36] Sons and Daughters now why would the
[1:20:39] angel ask about
[1:20:41] Sons if he only knew he had daughters
[1:20:45] but the angel asked do you have sons and
[1:20:48] do you have daughters so lot has some
[1:20:50] sons that didn't come out
[1:20:54] oh they made the wrong
[1:20:59] choice you see it's all about esteeming
[1:21:02] the reproach of Christ you know what you
[1:21:04] might be picked at you might be picked
[1:21:06] on but that's actually a blessing when
[1:21:09] that happens to you that that actually
[1:21:12] you know according to the scrip this
[1:21:14] definition I just read you you know
[1:21:16] we're supposed to admire
[1:21:18] that not be ashamed of it we're oh I got
[1:21:21] picked on for being a Christian
[1:21:22] Christian Glory that's right amen I mean
[1:21:27] you so you should C you you know what
[1:21:29] happened to me today they picked on me

[1:21:33] Christian yes sir that's something you
[1:21:35] should get excited about brother you
[1:21:38] know not picked on you because you did
[1:21:39] something crazy but picked on you for
[1:21:42] being I'm a Christian they see me as a
[1:21:45] Christian you're supposed to admire that
[1:21:48] yes sir when you look back in scripture
[1:21:51] I mean the fellas in the new test that
[1:21:52] was in jail Paul Silas Peter all them
[1:21:55] went to jail for being
[1:21:58] Christians you in good company when
[1:22:00] people picking at you when you're
[1:22:02] esteeming the reproach of Christ Joshua

[1:22:07] day whom you'll serve they he was
[1:22:08] esteeming the reproach of Christ when
[1:22:11] Elijah challenged the children of Israel
[1:22:13] to remain just to stop uh being halted
[1:22:16] between two opinions uh choose between
[1:22:19] God and baale when he he was he was
[1:22:22] being he was esteemed for the reproach
[1:22:23] of Christ
[1:22:25] Ruth when she chose to go with
[1:22:29] Naomi Ruth was esteeming the reproach of
[1:22:34] Christ I love Ruth's decision Ruth was
[1:22:38] Ruth was come along with another

[1:24:58] had given my heart to the Lord
[1:25:00] Jesus and um I remember going to church
[1:25:03] one night and we watched a film called
[1:25:04] The Burning hell and they were just
[1:25:07] showing what hell was going to be like

[1:33:35] reproach of
[1:33:40] Christ brother random was in a meeting

[1:33:46] time this brother was so inspired by
[1:33:49] what brother random preached that night
[1:33:50] and he said I just got to go and
[1:33:52] compliment
[1:33:54] him and when he went to shake brother
[1:33:56] brandom's head say and said that could
[1:33:58] have been like the 23rd chapter of the
[1:34:00] Book of
[1:34:01] Revelation now it's only 22 chapters
[1:34:03] there but he was just trying to make a
[1:34:05] compliment and when he open his mouth to
[1:34:08] make this compliment all of a sudden the
[1:34:10] man took off in unknown
[1:34:13] tongues when he did there was three L
[1:34:16] three people there lady and think two
[1:34:18] other men and they come say that's not

[1:34:31] what he said all three of them came back
[1:34:33] together and gave brother random the
[1:34:35] note of what the man said without
[1:34:37] talking to each other it was exact on
[1:34:40] all three
[1:34:42] occasions and this what was said to
[1:34:44] brother

[1:35:44] have to ordain a woman preaching say I
[1:35:45] can't do that that's against the word of
[1:35:47] God and he had to make a choice to stand
[1:35:49] for the word or go with the p has to say
[1:35:52] he had to make a choice he left and God
[1:35:54] said because you made that choice yes it
[1:35:56] was hard you had to leave a lot of
[1:35:58] friends you had to forsake a lot of
[1:35:59] people but you esteem the reproach of

[1:40:10] forward uh turn with me to Deuteronomy
[1:40:19] 30
[1:40:31] [Music]
[1:40:33] um I'll just start at verse 11
[1:40:39] here children of Israel also had to make
[1:40:41] a
[1:40:42] choice it says
[1:40:46] this it is not in heaven that thou
[1:40:48] should us say who should go up for us to
[1:40:52] heaven
[1:41:00] and Deuteronomy 30 and verse
[1:41:07] 11 I'm sorry I was at verse 12 all right
[1:41:10] for this commandment which I command
[1:41:12] thee this day it is not hidden from thee
[1:41:15] neither is it far from neither is it far
[1:41:18] off it is not in heaven
[1:41:21] that thou should us say who shall go up
[1:41:23] for us to heaven and bring it unto us
[1:41:26] that we may hear it and do
[1:41:28] it neither is it beyond the sea that
[1:41:31] thou should us say who shall go over the
[1:41:33] sea for us and bring it unto us that we
[1:41:35] may hear it and do
[1:41:37] it but the
[1:41:39] word is very nigh unto thee in thy mouth
[1:41:43] and in thy heart that thou mayest do
[1:41:47] it see I have set before thee this day
[1:41:50] life in good death and
[1:41:53] evil and that I command thee this day to
[1:41:56] love the Lord thy
[1:41:58] God to walk in his
[1:42:00] ways and to keep his Commandments and
[1:42:03] his statutes and his judgments that thou
[1:42:07] mayest live and multiply and the Lord
[1:42:09] thy God shall bless thee in the land
[1:42:11] whether thou goest to possess
[1:42:14] it but if thine
[1:42:18] heart turn away
[1:42:21] so that thou will not hear but shall be
[1:42:23] drawn away in worship of gods and serve
[1:42:26] them I denounce unto you this
[1:42:30] day that ye shall surely
[1:42:32] perish and that you shall not prolong
[1:42:35] your days upon the land whether thou
[1:42:37] passest over Jordan to go to possess
[1:42:41] it verse 19 is a very important verse I
[1:42:44] call Heaven and Earth to
[1:42:47] record this day against you
[1:42:52] that I have set before you life and
[1:42:55] death blessing and
[1:42:59] cursing
[1:43:00] therefore choose
[1:43:03] life that both thou and thy seed may
[1:43:08] live that thou mayest love the Lord thy
[1:43:11] God that thou mayest obey his voice that
[1:43:15] thou mayest cleave unto him for he is
[1:43:18] thy life and the length of thy days that
[1:43:22] thou mayest dwell in the land which the
[1:43:25] Lord swear unto thy fathers to Abraham
[1:43:29] to Isaac to Jacob to give them
