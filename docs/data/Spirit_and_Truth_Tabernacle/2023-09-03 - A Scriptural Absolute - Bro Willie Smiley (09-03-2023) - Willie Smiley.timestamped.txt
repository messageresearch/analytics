[49:37] on on a washboard or something but we
[49:41] happy to be Amos chapter three this
[49:43] morning uh let's remember the other part

[50:03] for it and man it's good to see uh have
[50:06] brother kwaku back with us hey man
[50:10] um this morning amen we thank the Lord
[50:13] for just taking him overseas and and
[50:15] bringing him uh back uh to us I'm always
[50:20] encouraged when I look back then I see
[50:22] him in the back when the pastor's not
[50:25] here you know you have to kind of look
[50:27] to the ministers sometimes to give you a
[50:30] little strength and courage
[50:33] amen so uh we appreciate him just got a
[50:37] wonderful spirit and we just like to say
[50:39] how much we appreciate
[50:41] um brother Quinton Junior's message I
[50:44] might just kind of tie some stuff in uh
[50:47] this morning
[50:49] I call Brother Troy on Friday and I said
[50:53] man that young man I tell you what I'm
[50:55] really appreciating the the young core
[50:58] Ministers of the church and and their uh
[51:02] Outlook and their input and the things
[51:05] that they see in scripture and and uh
[51:09] just their dedication I appreciate that
[51:12] um
[51:13] for myself as somebody that's been
[51:16] around for a good little minute I'm
[51:19] always encouraged to hear them preach I
[51:22] ain't know I ain't always here when they
[51:24] preach so though I hope they don't get
[51:27] you know discouraged but uh I live an
[51:30] hour and a half and things happen my job
[51:32] is not like everybody else's job
[51:35] sometimes I have to spend time on the
[51:38] job in order to be able to make it
[51:40] because them bills don't stop
[51:42] somebody out to know what I'm telling
[51:44] mine every month they keep on rolling
[51:47] rolling rolling rolling
[51:50] amen so but I do get a chance we thank
[51:54] God for um for social media that uh uh I
[51:59] and one way is I can't stand social
[52:01] media but on the other hand I thank God
[52:04] for the internet so I'll be able to tune
[52:06] in and fellowship okay let's let's kind
[52:10] of get into it Amos chapter three
[52:13] uh verse 3 it says can two walk together
[52:16] except they be agreed
[52:19] will a lion roar in the forest when he
[52:21] has no prey will a young lion cry out of
[52:25] his den if he have taken nothing can a
[52:30] bird fall in a snare upon the Earth
[52:32] where no gen is for him shall uh one
[52:37] take up a snare from the earth and have
[52:40] taken nothing and at All Shall a trumpet
[52:43] be blown in the city and the people be
[52:47] Not Afraid shall there be evil in a city
[52:50] and the Lord have not done it
[52:54] surely the Lord God will do nothing but
[52:57] he Reveals His Secrets unto his servants
[53:00] the prophets
[53:02] amen
[53:04] um let us look at Luke chapter 4.
[53:10] before we have our seats
[53:16] yeah I'll pray for me this morning
[53:21] I'm normally comfortable but this
[53:23] morning I feel a little bit
[53:26] jittery
[53:27] uh
[53:29] it says uh and there was delivered unto
[53:34] him the book of the prophet isaiahs and
[53:37] when he had opened the book he found a
[53:39] place where it was written the spirit of
[53:41] the Lord is upon me
[53:42] because he has anointed me to preach the
[53:44] gospel to the poor he has sent me to
[53:47] heal the brokenhearted to preach
[53:49] Deliverance to the captives to recover
[53:51] the sight to the Blind and to set and
[53:55] Liberty them that are bruised and to
[53:57] preach to acceptable yeah the Lord and
[54:00] he closed the book and he gave it again
[54:02] to the minister
[54:04] and sat down in the eyes of all of them
[54:08] that were fast where in the synagogue
[54:11] were fasting on him and he began to say
[54:14] unto them this day this scriptures
[54:16] fulfilled uh in your ears let's just buy
[54:20] his this morning Grace's father we just
[54:23] thank you and we praise you o God this
[54:25] morning for allowing us this opportunity
[54:27] to be here and uh we just trust that we
[54:30] could move the human Spirit to one side
[54:33] so that the Holy Spirit can speak to his
[54:36] people this morning
[54:38] just anoint us Lord as as just uh
[54:42] speakers and hearers of the word of God
[54:44] this morning may you Quicken something
[54:47] in the hearts of your people we want to
[54:49] just remember the Saints that's in
[54:51] Indiana uh this weekend and the Brethren
[54:55] and we just thank you for all the things
[54:57] this morning in Jesus name amen amen may
[55:00] be seated
[55:02] um this morning we like to just use it
[55:04] we appreciate our visitor also and uh
[55:07] good to see uh uh sister wisdom with us
[55:10] uh this morning
[55:12] um we we just like to uh use it as a
[55:16] topic this morning a scriptural absolute
[55:19] and uh y'all just give me a minute or
[55:22] two to just kind of draw a little
[55:24] background from uh where where we we
[55:28] kind of uh wanted to preach this a
[55:30] couple of weeks ago but uh we preached
[55:33] something else and uh so we're here this
[55:35] morning and uh you know brother brother
[55:37] Jack brother Jack made a statement a few
[55:40] weeks ago maybe about a month ago and uh
[55:43] he was just talking about the younger
[55:46] generation and coming up and and uh
[55:49] wanting to try to make sure that they're
[55:51] established in the word of God
[55:54] and uh when I heard that just you know
[55:57] my wheels always gets to turn in and I
[55:59] get inspired I just try to by the grace
[56:02] of God you know uh try to follow the
[56:06] inspiration and the leading of the Holy
[56:08] Spirit
[56:10] I'm never here to just try to show y'all
[56:12] how much I know about the Bible uh it's
[56:15] it's I'm not in a preaching contest or
[56:18] anything of that nature I would prefer
[56:21] to just kind of sit in the back and
[56:23] listen but you know uh when when the
[56:26] pastor called on you you just kind of
[56:28] come up and just try to be a feeling but
[56:32] but I'm I'm always I'm always trying to
[56:35] be spiritual and and watching the the
[56:39] the leading of the holy spirit because
[56:42] the the Bible says that sons are led by
[56:45] the spirit
[56:47] is that right the sons of God are led by
[56:50] the spirit of God and so you know uh
[56:54] brother Browner makes a statement he
[56:56] talks about getting getting in the
[56:58] spirit and see if you don't come to
[57:01] church in the spirit you you're going to
[57:04] miss the the leading of the spirit of
[57:07] God for the church
[57:09] and I don't know about you you know I I
[57:11] always want to be in tune a pastor like
[57:15] I say and y'all know that for some years
[57:17] and I'm I was always just trying to find
[57:19] out Lord you know I might have my
[57:22] thoughts and my ideas and my
[57:24] perspectives and things of that nature
[57:26] but but what's beneficial Amen to to the
[57:31] people that that you got here for me to
[57:34] Shepherd and so I'm not the shepherd but
[57:38] as as one of the ministers with like we
[57:41] say we're not here to show off knowledge
[57:42] because we haven't opened book The
[57:45] Mighty Angel descended with the book
[57:48] open we we understand that that we we
[57:52] have we have a lot of things that can
[57:55] make us seem like we're smart
[57:58] come on church but but what what good is
[58:02] all of that
[58:04] what good is all of that if if the
[58:07] people are wayward
[58:08] if the people are unstable if the Young
[58:11] Generation is unstable they don't know
[58:14] who they are they don't know where they
[58:16] stand well I'm coming to church because
[58:17] my mama bring me
[58:20] you know and and and and we've seen this
[58:24] over the years and we do things and and
[58:26] and you you could see that in the way
[58:29] that people approach things in the way
[58:31] that we come to church
[58:34] right and and right and an attitude
[58:37] towards things it's a real indication
[58:41] that people are not a Man stable
[58:47] and and I think according to the book of
[58:49] Ephesians God gives us a five-fold
[58:52] Ministry for the perfecting of the
[58:55] church
[58:57] so that we're not tossed to and fro with
[59:00] every wind and Doctrine
[59:02] right see God's objective for the
[59:06] fivefold ministry is that we are stable
[59:12] right that that we're stable and the
[59:15] messages that that I preached are things
[59:18] that are being said to Quicken us and to
[59:22] Anchor us uh in the things of God
[59:25] glory to God
[59:27] amen and like I say you know uh we had
[59:31] the opportunity to Shepherd and it's
[59:35] it's troubling for a servant to preach a
[59:39] hundred messages a year
[59:42] and then you still realize
[59:46] they're not getting it come on somebody
[59:48] they saying amen but they're not getting
[59:50] it
[59:51] glory to God see when when you get it it
[59:55] it's the thing that transform Our Lives
[59:59] it changes us we we gonna preach this
[1:00:02] morning I'm starting to feel good right
[1:00:07] um now let's let's look at this word
[1:00:09] absolute
[1:00:11] uh it in the dictionary Webster
[1:00:15] according to Webster and if we read any
[1:00:18] quotes it'll be coming from the absolute
[1:00:20] 1962.
[1:00:22] um
[1:00:24] this is this is verse 59 if they want to
[1:00:27] pull it up
[1:00:29] but he says uh according to Webster this
[1:00:32] is what it means it's it's perfect in
[1:00:35] itself
[1:00:37] right it's Unlimited in his power
[1:00:41] it's primarily an ultimate an
[1:00:45] ultimate is a final
[1:00:48] concluding uh uh
[1:00:52] I've got this road back uh bad terminal
[1:00:55] in
[1:00:57] I guess that's right glory to God y'all
[1:01:00] help me right and and I was thinking
[1:01:03] about this and and just thinking about
[1:01:06] just and you know as as uh
[1:01:09] a student of scripture
[1:01:12] you know a lot of times I take things
[1:01:14] and and I Ponder them and I meditate on
[1:01:18] them and and I'm not perfect
[1:01:21] but the word is come on somebody I'm not
[1:01:24] perfect you're not perfect and that's
[1:01:26] not where when we're we we are we up let
[1:01:30] me rephrase that
[1:01:31] I'm gonna take that back I am perfect
[1:01:35] Hallelujah but not in a way that people
[1:01:37] see perfection
[1:01:39] I'm perfect by being in Jesus Christ can
[1:01:42] we say Amen
[1:01:43] right but out but outside of that and
[1:01:47] just my you know everyday Walk of Life
[1:01:50] and living I know that I do things
[1:01:53] that's that I probably should be on such
[1:01:57] a a level now where uh some of the
[1:02:01] things that I do like we used to say
[1:02:03] things I used to do I don't do nothing
[1:02:06] but that's not the case
[1:02:08] because sometimes we we constantly do
[1:02:12] things and and I know it takes it takes
[1:02:14] God to bring us to this place of growth
[1:02:18] and maturity
[1:02:20] but we we all should be at a at a spot
[1:02:24] where some of the things that we're
[1:02:26] doing we shouldn't be doing now I'm not
[1:02:29] here to dis-christianize us right I'm
[1:02:33] just here to step up to you with the
[1:02:34] word of God
[1:02:36] right and preach Christ to us
[1:02:39] but but you know pondering these
[1:02:42] different things and just looking at my
[1:02:44] own self from a personal standpoint uh
[1:02:48] we we all have to have something that's
[1:02:53] in our life that's that's final
[1:02:57] that that speaks of finality
[1:03:02] an absolute because if we don't we're
[1:03:06] going to be we're going to be
[1:03:07] wishy-washy we're going to be coming to
[1:03:09] a building
[1:03:10] and going out of a building and coming
[1:03:13] into a building and going out of
[1:03:14] building and then we're gonna come three
[1:03:17] weeks and miss a hundred weeks
[1:03:21] come on
[1:03:23] and and the reason we and the reason why
[1:03:26] we do that is because
[1:03:28] uh we don't really have an amen
[1:03:32] we don't we don't have something that
[1:03:35] speaks of uh finality
[1:03:38] this this is final right I you know when
[1:03:42] we think about brother Jack as our
[1:03:43] pastor you know we we gotta have an amen
[1:03:48] come on when when we when we think about
[1:03:52] the things that that the ministry is
[1:03:55] trying to relate that's got to be an
[1:03:58] amen to it
[1:04:00] all right because if if if there's one
[1:04:05] uh little bit of of Speck of doubt
[1:04:09] you're gonna you're gonna have a lot of
[1:04:11] struggle
[1:04:12] you're gonna have a lot of you're gonna
[1:04:14] have a lot of struggle with it right
[1:04:16] with because when when certain
[1:04:18] terminology and certain things are said
[1:04:20] you're gonna draw back
[1:04:23] come on church instead instead of Amen
[1:04:26] in it and see this is not about
[1:04:28] personalities this is this is not about
[1:04:30] who's preaching
[1:04:32] if Little Brother Joseph was preaching
[1:04:35] right it's not about your favorite
[1:04:37] preachers and your favorite uh people
[1:04:40] and that's nonsense to me I've been
[1:04:42] around too long for that we've seen a
[1:04:44] lot of that right amen uh God God God
[1:04:48] God has a five-fold Ministry and and
[1:04:52] everybody has has their has their
[1:04:55] portion and their approach in the way
[1:04:58] that they look at things and and and
[1:05:00] everybody you know when I started seeing
[1:05:03] people trying to act like other people I
[1:05:05] was like bro you gotta grow up you guys
[1:05:08] just kind of find out who you are as an
[1:05:11] individual right
[1:05:12] but but you know we know that brother
[1:05:14] Jack his uh God has called them and
[1:05:17] ordained them and we see the fruits
[1:05:20] we we see the fruits amen of his labors
[1:05:23] and things of that nature so we can we
[1:05:26] can you know from a scriptural
[1:05:29] standpoint have uh uh uh absolute
[1:05:35] come on Church
[1:05:37] now I know brother what brother Quakers
[1:05:39] say but I ain't that kind of preacher so
[1:05:40] I'm gonna pull y'all if y'all ain't
[1:05:42] coming with me
[1:05:44] come on
[1:05:46] I'm still old school life if you ain't
[1:05:49] with me I'm gonna pull you along
[1:05:51] you'll get it later we'll trust that God
[1:05:54] or but but we we gotta have something in
[1:05:57] our life
[1:06:00] finality
[1:06:02] no matter where you're going you're
[1:06:04] going to the church over there you're
[1:06:06] going to the church up the street
[1:06:08] wherever you're going
[1:06:10] as an individual the thought behind the
[1:06:16] preaching has got to be to you and amen
[1:06:21] you got to speak speak of finality but
[1:06:25] I'm gonna say something here if if it's
[1:06:28] not if it's not speaking of Christ
[1:06:31] you guys are wrong you because you can't
[1:06:33] you can't amen anything outside of
[1:06:36] Christ no matter no matter how good it
[1:06:40] sounds right you know and and I'm I'm
[1:06:43] one I look at different things and you
[1:06:46] know sometimes I I be on uh the podcast
[1:06:49] and this is the day of podcasts
[1:06:52] everybody and their Grandmama got a
[1:06:55] podcast
[1:06:56] and and everybody and everybody has
[1:07:00] something to say
[1:07:02] so-called
[1:07:03] and and that makes it so deceptive
[1:07:09] right
[1:07:10] because everybody has something to say
[1:07:14] and here's the problem I have with a lot
[1:07:17] of things when I sit there and and I
[1:07:20] analyze it I realize that a lot of
[1:07:23] things that's being said are merely
[1:07:27] secular and for secular people and it
[1:07:30] might be good and it might not be good
[1:07:34] right
[1:07:35] but but but everything in the word of
[1:07:37] God is good
[1:07:39] everything in the word of God is yea and
[1:07:42] amen
[1:07:43] is that right I miss a lot of these
[1:07:46] things you know uh
[1:07:49] and like would say we we got some some
[1:07:51] guys that's out there there's ministers
[1:07:53] they're saying some good things and like
[1:07:55] brother Jack read a quote uh the other
[1:07:58] week and I thought and I was good if
[1:08:00] it's if it's if it's scriptural and
[1:08:04] it'll help us
[1:08:05] you know you just have to say Amen to it
[1:08:08] but but a lot of things I listen to and
[1:08:11] I listen to a lot of conversations and
[1:08:14] different things and how how you realize
[1:08:17] a lot of things are not scriptural
[1:08:21] right I'm Gonna Keep labor on on that a
[1:08:26] lot of things are not scriptural
[1:08:28] and if if they're not scriptural you'll
[1:08:32] never have an amen in your life
[1:08:36] right and see this is this is the reason
[1:08:39] why
[1:08:41] um um
[1:08:42] we we appreciate according to scripture
[1:08:47] the sovereignty of God and I read your
[1:08:50] description Amos chapter 3 for a purpose
[1:08:53] uh God says listen because see you in
[1:08:57] studying scripture
[1:08:59] you gotta be able to follow God
[1:09:04] come on Church you got to be able to
[1:09:07] follow patterns
[1:09:09] right because if you can't follow the
[1:09:12] patterns you'll never understand your
[1:09:14] Bible
[1:09:15] come on
[1:09:16] and I appreciate God sending us amen uh
[1:09:20] brother Branham uh in this this evening
[1:09:24] time
[1:09:25] with a with a a Ministry to show us how
[1:09:30] to look at the Bible
[1:09:32] not how to look at personalities not to
[1:09:35] point to this and that but how to
[1:09:38] approach scripture and study scripture
[1:09:42] and see the word unfolding
[1:09:48] right
[1:09:48] constantly slowly
[1:09:51] unfolding right go back to Christ the
[1:09:55] mystery of God reveal he have he was
[1:09:57] trying to help us to see how the
[1:10:00] scripture has been
[1:10:03] slowly unfolding down to this time
[1:10:08] we can see in this hour that we living
[1:10:11] in because of the this ministry
[1:10:16] how the scripture has been unfolding
[1:10:20] prophetically
[1:10:22] hey man right because he says I'm not
[1:10:26] going to do nothing except I reveal it
[1:10:30] to my servants the prophets first
[1:10:34] God anoints a man
[1:10:37] right and that man is only the
[1:10:41] mouthpiece of God that's it
[1:10:44] that's it he speaks for God one time God
[1:10:49] God brought the people uh uh uh up and
[1:10:55] and in the days of Moses and God stopped
[1:10:59] thundering down from heaven they were
[1:11:02] like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
[1:11:04] whoa whoa nope nope we don't want God to
[1:11:06] speak to us like that
[1:11:08] that was that was just too much for the
[1:11:11] people is that right y'all know the
[1:11:13] story
[1:11:14] God God wanted to talk to the people man
[1:11:16] we don't want to hear from God
[1:11:18] you know and it's weird because you
[1:11:20] always hit folk talking about you know
[1:11:23] how much they hearing from God God ain't
[1:11:26] just talking all the time like we think
[1:11:27] he talking
[1:11:29] I'm giving a word and this and it's like
[1:11:31] man scripturally come on now God don't
[1:11:34] God is not speaking like that
[1:11:37] right amen God God catches a man
[1:11:41] and anoints that man and that man speaks
[1:11:45] a prophetic word amen uh uh from God
[1:11:51] and and sometimes it might take
[1:11:54] generations for that word to be a man
[1:11:59] fulfilled but if it's God
[1:12:05] if it's God it's going to be fulfilled
[1:12:10] Isaiah listen Jesus Jesus came on this
[1:12:15] scene based upon the scriptures and the
[1:12:18] scriptures alone
[1:12:20] right
[1:12:22] amen Isaiah in the spirit was quickened
[1:12:26] Behold a virgin shall conceive
[1:12:29] and and that that word went out from the
[1:12:33] prophet's lips and it took so many
[1:12:37] generations now y'all smart people with
[1:12:39] good memories y'all know how many
[1:12:40] generations it took I can't remember
[1:12:43] today
[1:12:44] but eventually in the season in time
[1:12:49] amen uh uh
[1:12:52] God had his appointed person
[1:12:55] predestinated
[1:12:58] right
[1:12:59] predestinated to fulfill
[1:13:03] and regardless of what people's thoughts
[1:13:05] in regardless of what people's feelings
[1:13:07] was about it
[1:13:09] right amen that scripture had to be
[1:13:12] fulfilled
[1:13:14] right right and so when that went out
[1:13:16] one day here come this this young lady
[1:13:20] that was a spoused to a man named Mary
[1:13:25] she was it could have been Susie
[1:13:29] right it could have been Jane but God
[1:13:33] had predestinated
[1:13:35] Mary before the foundations of the world
[1:13:40] amen she was God's choice
[1:13:44] predestinated by God to fulfill that
[1:13:50] scriptural prophecy she was the
[1:13:53] manifestation of God's word
[1:13:58] just like genesis will let that be went
[1:14:02] out let there be light light was the
[1:14:06] very manifestation of the spoken word of
[1:14:08] God and Mary was the very manifestation
[1:14:13] of the spoken word of not not a man but
[1:14:17] of God
[1:14:20] right
[1:14:22] and see
[1:14:23] watch watch what watch what the angel
[1:14:26] had to do for Mary
[1:14:29] in order in order to stabilize her
[1:14:34] and anchor her
[1:14:36] right
[1:14:38] amen he had to work with her
[1:14:41] because because
[1:14:42] you know when he first came and said
[1:14:44] well you know you highly favored
[1:14:46] amongst women and all that that was hard
[1:14:49] for her to to kind of conceive right go
[1:14:54] back to the scripture and read it it
[1:14:56] that was a little that was a little
[1:14:57] difficult for her because she probably
[1:14:59] you know looking at herself like
[1:15:03] just a simple person and how could this
[1:15:06] be and and you know but but the the prop
[1:15:11] that the the angel worked with her watch
[1:15:15] this
[1:15:16] right
[1:15:18] in Scripture
[1:15:21] having to point her back to scripture
[1:15:25] right now this is what I'm talking about
[1:15:27] this morning it's it's important for us
[1:15:30] right see he had to make sure that she
[1:15:35] was tired of something
[1:15:38] not just some emotions a sensation or
[1:15:42] something of that next and I love that
[1:15:43] but she had to be tied to this scripture
[1:15:49] right be because once she conceived in
[1:15:55] in her womb amen this this uh this this
[1:16:01] this
[1:16:02] egg and blood right and and you know
[1:16:07] bringing this bringing this to her
[1:16:09] husband and your husband know what I'm
[1:16:10] talking about
[1:16:13] you know because if you walk on the
[1:16:15] United day now ain't one but one
[1:16:18] scripture in the Bible
[1:16:21] that was spoken right I guess you could
[1:16:24] we could look at that a little bit
[1:16:26] prophetically too I guess but but you
[1:16:29] know you'll have a hard time you will
[1:16:31] struggle with that right and and I can
[1:16:34] imagine because even Joseph was mindful
[1:16:37] to put her away
[1:16:39] and then then you know uh
[1:16:43] the angel had to speak to Joseph right
[1:16:46] and then then not not not only that
[1:16:51] you know
[1:16:52] Mary having to walk around
[1:16:55] uh nine months and and people knowing
[1:16:59] they hadn't had the ceremony so without
[1:17:02] the ceremony
[1:17:04] how could you know what I'm saying
[1:17:06] because that's order the things
[1:17:11] come on there's protocol that's and
[1:17:14] people that's boundaries
[1:17:17] right and we don't like it
[1:17:21] right right amen we we want to do what
[1:17:23] we want to do
[1:17:25] you know it's like scripture in this
[1:17:28] hour where you know uh uh and and this
[1:17:32] prophetically and naturally where women
[1:17:34] want to take the man name and do
[1:17:36] whatever they want to do
[1:17:39] I'll go I want to go I'll do what I want
[1:17:42] to do I that don't work like that what a
[1:17:44] what about protocol
[1:17:46] what what about what about boundaries
[1:17:49] see amen no that's that's an order
[1:17:53] there's things that's been been set up
[1:17:55] from Genesis
[1:17:58] right y'all don't mind if I deal with
[1:18:00] this for one second I feel something
[1:18:02] from from Genesis right after the fall
[1:18:07] God God brought a second Covenant in but
[1:18:11] then God also bought order
[1:18:14] right God put the man in the headship
[1:18:16] position
[1:18:18] right right glory to God and it don't it
[1:18:22] don't make the man uh a tyrant or
[1:18:25] anything of that nature but but you know
[1:18:28] God just don't want us out here right
[1:18:32] God want a stable God wants us anchored
[1:18:35] amen all right and see this this is the
[1:18:39] thing that I watch I I just watch uh
[1:18:43] attitudes and motives objectives and I
[1:18:46] watched everything based upon scripture
[1:18:49] and you can tell me what you want to
[1:18:51] tell me and I probably won't even argue
[1:18:53] with you about it but if we if we really
[1:18:56] get down to where the rubber meets the
[1:18:59] road at and and these things are not
[1:19:02] lining up with scripture and we say that
[1:19:05] we've been tied to Christ then I kind of
[1:19:09] start having a problem
[1:19:11] I may not argue with folks about nothing
[1:19:15] right but in my mind and in my heart
[1:19:19] I'll be looking at it like you can say
[1:19:21] what you want to say
[1:19:23] right amen uh uh your actions and this
[1:19:28] goes for me too now your actions and and
[1:19:32] your motives and your objectives and
[1:19:34] everything is not passing through a
[1:19:36] thinking of man's filter
[1:19:38] I'm not sure what you're calling uh your
[1:19:41] amen or what's final but your actions
[1:19:45] and everything else is speaking of
[1:19:47] something that's just not speaking of
[1:19:48] scripture
[1:19:50] right you you don't because you don't
[1:19:52] see a scriptural manifestation of things
[1:19:55] or it'll take me a year to really preach
[1:19:58] what I'm talking about
[1:19:59] come on Church
[1:20:01] come on Church see our attitudes and our
[1:20:05] thoughts and things of that nature and
[1:20:08] and just for the young people let's
[1:20:09] let's touch this a second this for a
[1:20:12] younger generation that that really do
[1:20:15] not have let's call it what it is really
[1:20:17] do not have an absolute
[1:20:19] right
[1:20:21] and You Gotta Have It it's it's it's uh
[1:20:25] brother Quake who was preaching the last
[1:20:28] time he was up and he was talking about
[1:20:30] the new birth and it's and it's got to
[1:20:32] be something that's personal
[1:20:35] right personal to you
[1:20:38] come on Amen amen glory to God it well
[1:20:41] my mama got the Holy Ghost and my daddy
[1:20:43] got the Holy Ghost and my uncle got the
[1:20:45] Holy Ghost I ain't got nothing to do
[1:20:46] with you though
[1:20:48] see uh we used to say I got just enough
[1:20:52] oil
[1:20:54] I feel like it just enough see
[1:20:58] my oil won't do you no good because I
[1:21:01] got just enough for myself
[1:21:04] and see God God God don't have no
[1:21:07] grandchildren
[1:21:09] right so so you can't come in like that
[1:21:12] and then we try to use we try to use the
[1:21:15] quote now I'm gonna be touching a little
[1:21:17] bit right here you know all that that he
[1:21:20] ever loved
[1:21:22] yeah
[1:21:24] and get the Holy Ghost that's right
[1:21:26] brother he could love you
[1:21:28] but but but God cannot change the
[1:21:31] scripture
[1:21:33] come on
[1:21:34] that's touchy but
[1:21:37] y'all know I ain't scared
[1:21:40] it's touchy right because because
[1:21:44] scripture cannot be broken for nobody
[1:21:50] right
[1:21:51] because when God set this thing in
[1:21:55] motion who could could God look to for
[1:22:00] the kind of knowledge and understanding
[1:22:02] that was needed to give us hope in this
[1:22:07] life
[1:22:07] to give us stability in this life to to
[1:22:11] bring us back to this place of uh
[1:22:15] Eternal Bliss there was no body there
[1:22:19] was no knowledge I mean the greatest
[1:22:23] uh intellectuals that ever lived didn't
[1:22:27] know the plan
[1:22:29] even Even Adam Even Adam didn't know the
[1:22:34] plan of God
[1:22:35] he did not know what it was going to
[1:22:38] take to bring themselves back into a
[1:22:42] fellowship and Harmony and Oneness with
[1:22:45] God after it was broken amen at his best
[1:22:49] attempt at at kind of sawing a fig Leaf
[1:22:53] around he realized oh this is not
[1:22:55] working
[1:22:56] and see
[1:22:59] um we're we're not trying to preach
[1:23:01] religion
[1:23:02] because religion is the same thing that
[1:23:05] Adam did is made a covering
[1:23:09] but really it's it don't work we're
[1:23:12] preaching Redemption we're preaching
[1:23:16] Christianity
[1:23:18] and I got notes but I I'm feeling good
[1:23:22] right we're preaching Christianity we're
[1:23:25] not preaching religion
[1:23:27] we're not preaching tradition see the
[1:23:31] sin of man Ministry came just like Jesus
[1:23:35] watch the parallels
[1:23:38] when Jesus Christ coming according to
[1:23:41] scripture through the wound of aversion
[1:23:44] with a Ministry according to scripture
[1:23:48] he preached and taught down tradition
[1:23:53] he told him he said listen because of
[1:23:56] your tradition
[1:24:01] because of all of this stuff it makes
[1:24:04] the word of God of not a fact
[1:24:08] see Jesus realized just how far from
[1:24:14] truth which was uh brother Trevor
[1:24:16] preached truth come on preach with me
[1:24:19] somebody
[1:24:19] how far away from truth that the people
[1:24:24] had drifted and a lot of what they had
[1:24:27] when when Jesus came on the scene with a
[1:24:31] lot of tradition mixed
[1:24:35] and all they had was a hybrid religion
[1:24:41] right they had a hybrid religion and a
[1:24:46] hybrid religion it's a it's a better
[1:24:50] looking something but it ain't got no
[1:24:53] life in it
[1:24:54] come on come on go back to spoken word
[1:24:57] it's the Original Seed see and so we
[1:25:02] needed
[1:25:04] somebody to come on the scene right and
[1:25:08] this is why I appreciate I appreciate
[1:25:10] the ministry
[1:25:13] right and the sovereignty of God watch
[1:25:16] this now y'all keep following my my
[1:25:18] thought right
[1:25:20] the sovereignty of God before the
[1:25:22] foundation of the word world
[1:25:25] God's choice
[1:25:28] right to fulfill
[1:25:31] uh Matthew 17.
[1:25:35] right
[1:25:36] to fulfill Matthew 17 I think I got that
[1:25:39] right
[1:25:41] huh
[1:25:43] because that the the disciples asked
[1:25:47] Jesus I'm gonna show you something here
[1:25:49] scripturally from from Matthew 17 show
[1:25:52] show you that people miss the unfolding
[1:25:56] of the word of God all the time
[1:25:59] right right
[1:26:01] people do the disciples were looking for
[1:26:07] something
[1:26:08] right and that's something amen had come
[1:26:12] and gone
[1:26:13] and they were still looking for it
[1:26:17] right they couldn't grasp it they
[1:26:21] couldn't see it
[1:26:23] right you got to thank God blessing in
[1:26:25] your eyes
[1:26:26] blessed in your ears come on glory to
[1:26:30] God to be able to see how God by
[1:26:36] scripture
[1:26:38] uh uh predestinates
[1:26:42] and unfold scripture right under the
[1:26:46] nose of the intellectual
[1:26:49] right
[1:26:51] glory to God because even when Jesus was
[1:26:53] on the scene and he had gathered a group
[1:26:57] calling them out of traditions that was
[1:27:01] predestinated before the foundation of
[1:27:03] the world Amen and he said you know what
[1:27:06] father I thank you
[1:27:08] I thank you that you heard the
[1:27:11] revelation of the word of God from the
[1:27:13] eyes of the wise and prudence
[1:27:17] and revealed it to babes
[1:27:20] right such as we'll learn
[1:27:23] glory to God see this this
[1:27:26] unfolding is is and you can be smart
[1:27:30] that's not what I'm saying but in being
[1:27:33] smart you gotta learn how to be humble
[1:27:38] and I say something you cannot approach
[1:27:41] the gospel
[1:27:43] from from an intellectual perspective
[1:27:46] you'll miss everything that God is is
[1:27:48] doing and has done amen
[1:27:50] amen is that right amen
[1:27:52] Jesus when he was on this scene
[1:27:55] uh he he his disciples like well wait a
[1:27:59] minute wait a minute you got to thank
[1:28:02] God that something quick and they're
[1:28:04] like it's something that we missing
[1:28:07] it's it's an event that we're missing
[1:28:10] right
[1:28:13] Elias must first come
[1:28:16] I could imagine Jesus perk up a little
[1:28:19] bit
[1:28:20] like wow y'all finally trying to see
[1:28:23] something right
[1:28:27] but he had to help him to see now y'all
[1:28:30] go back when you get home and read it in
[1:28:32] Matthew 17.
[1:28:33] he had to help him to see he's already
[1:28:37] come
[1:28:39] and y'all did what what with him
[1:28:41] whatever uh you wanted to do
[1:28:45] right but also in the same breath
[1:28:49] he was talking about another coming of
[1:28:53] Elijah because you know there's five
[1:28:55] comments
[1:28:56] right another coming Amen to restore
[1:29:02] turn the hearts
[1:29:04] right and see you know if if you look at
[1:29:08] if you look at John the Baptist's
[1:29:10] ministry right
[1:29:12] glory to God his ministry was a
[1:29:17] introductory Ministry according to
[1:29:19] Isaiah 40 and 3's prophecy
[1:29:22] a Ministry to introduce Christ
[1:29:29] right a Ministry to introduce Christ
[1:29:33] glory to God is that right
[1:29:35] see when you go back to Saint John
[1:29:37] chapter 1 when when when John was on the
[1:29:41] back on the scene and we know he had a
[1:29:44] six-month Ministry
[1:29:47] um
[1:29:49] the religious men
[1:29:52] religious people
[1:29:54] right
[1:29:56] they they approached John about his
[1:29:59] ministry because they couldn't
[1:30:00] understand it
[1:30:03] that's right right they couldn't
[1:30:05] understand it but John had a scriptural
[1:30:09] Ministry
[1:30:11] see God don't do nothing outside of the
[1:30:14] Bible
[1:30:16] come on cherish well God is doing a new
[1:30:19] thing
[1:30:20] you better show me show it to me in the
[1:30:22] Bible now
[1:30:23] I don't really want it
[1:30:25] come on Church come on church I know we
[1:30:28] ain't got a church full but that's the
[1:30:30] truth
[1:30:31] God does not leave his word
[1:30:34] and so when they came to John amen uh
[1:30:39] they were trying to find out well who
[1:30:41] are you
[1:30:42] and what like what are you doing
[1:30:45] right
[1:30:46] see and here's here's the thing just
[1:30:50] like with Mary the the scrutiny
[1:30:55] right and the things that you have to
[1:30:58] endure
[1:30:59] when when you're standing for scriptural
[1:31:04] truth
[1:31:06] come on
[1:31:07] see could you could y'all imagine being
[1:31:10] married I'll back up a second then I
[1:31:12] come back right be living in an hour and
[1:31:17] and watching people turn their nose up
[1:31:20] at you
[1:31:23] realizing that people wheels are turning
[1:31:27] right realizing that people are not uh
[1:31:31] with you in your testimony
[1:31:34] glory to God but yet and still you still
[1:31:38] gotta walk
[1:31:41] come on you still gotta walk and the
[1:31:44] only way that you can do it is because
[1:31:47] you're tied to an absolute
[1:31:51] you have a scriptural absolute
[1:31:54] you know right at the end of it said she
[1:31:57] told him she said build unto me
[1:31:59] according to the right amen under me
[1:32:02] according to your work
[1:32:05] right see it was the word that anchored
[1:32:09] her it was the word that carried up
[1:32:12] through all of the scrutiny in and all
[1:32:15] of what she had to go through and all
[1:32:19] the talking and no doubt even after
[1:32:21] Jesus came on and said y'all mothers
[1:32:23] know what I'm talking about folk talking
[1:32:25] about your baby and all that
[1:32:28] you know how we get we get funny about
[1:32:30] our children I'm real funny about mine
[1:32:33] right
[1:32:34] glory to God daily Dave they don't
[1:32:37] understand they daddy but they ain't got
[1:32:39] to I understand who I am
[1:32:41] folk may not understand me but I
[1:32:43] understand who I am it don't matter what
[1:32:45] your people's feelings are and what
[1:32:47] people think when that don't bother me
[1:32:49] you're entitled to your thoughts and
[1:32:51] your feelings but that don't bother me
[1:32:52] but I know I know who I am I have uh uh
[1:32:56] uh amen
[1:32:57] in my spirit I have an amen when it
[1:33:00] comes down to my children
[1:33:02] right and and and why why I do and why I
[1:33:07] have done
[1:33:13] either either we believe the Bible
[1:33:15] although we don't believe the Bible come
[1:33:18] on church and see when when you standing
[1:33:21] for the word of God you're gonna you're
[1:33:23] gonna be scrutinized how many people
[1:33:25] been scrutinized
[1:33:26] we all going over here and y'all believe
[1:33:29] in this and y'all under y'all letting
[1:33:31] brother Jack deceive y'all
[1:33:33] no I could see scripturally by by
[1:33:37] Revelation and inspiration of God
[1:33:41] well God has quickened right that
[1:33:45] something in me has an amen
[1:33:48] right brother Quakers say the a manner
[1:33:51] is in here if you're born again
[1:33:53] right because because me and the world
[1:33:57] are the same
[1:33:59] right
[1:34:00] and and and and here's the thing right
[1:34:03] brother Brown preached a message right
[1:34:06] uh uh the false anointed ones at the end
[1:34:09] time
[1:34:10] right and and taking the scripture to
[1:34:14] show us that people will be anointed
[1:34:18] with the genuine
[1:34:21] Holy Ghost anointed and still be false
[1:34:25] teachers of the word
[1:34:28] huh that ain't far fetched
[1:34:32] look at look at look at Balaam
[1:34:35] Balaam was anointed
[1:34:38] right
[1:34:39] caiaphasis was anointed
[1:34:43] right Balaam was anointed and balak knew
[1:34:46] that he was anointed and and he went to
[1:34:50] him right glory to God because whatever
[1:34:52] he said came to pass
[1:34:55] come on
[1:34:57] man right that's right glory to God
[1:35:00] but then he went to God and better I
[1:35:03] said wait a minute man come on we try to
[1:35:05] we try to build you up we won't give you
[1:35:06] a bigger Ministry give you a bigger
[1:35:09] following and everything like that well
[1:35:12] when in praying God says God says no
[1:35:14] don't do that now do my people bailac
[1:35:18] had you know what watch this watch the
[1:35:21] spirit the spirits don't die balak had
[1:35:24] took a man bailiff and showed him the
[1:35:27] hind parts of the church
[1:35:30] what he did he showed him all of the bad
[1:35:33] parts
[1:35:35] right all of the mistakes when you see
[1:35:39] that that's the wrong Spirit on a person
[1:35:44] come on let me come on over here let me
[1:35:45] let me come on over here let me show you
[1:35:47] this that's the wrong it's the it's the
[1:35:49] same Spirit Spirits do not die
[1:35:53] right glory to God
[1:35:57] hey
[1:35:58] glory and Bala came and said boy look at
[1:36:01] here I can't curse what you know if God
[1:36:04] don't put it in my mouth I can't do it
[1:36:06] he couldn't curse God's children God let
[1:36:09] him go and all he did was spoke a
[1:36:11] blessing on him right because you can't
[1:36:14] curse what God ain't cursed
[1:36:17] is that right if God is blessed a person
[1:36:19] that person is blessed I don't care what
[1:36:21] you say what you think about it is that
[1:36:24] right
[1:36:25] Oh Glory to God but you know we we've
[1:36:28] appreciate it because you know we're
[1:36:30] living in an hour where where there's so
[1:36:34] much access to information but all
[1:36:39] information and good information
[1:36:43] right
[1:36:44] and see and see
[1:36:46] when when I see this age that I'm living
[1:36:49] in
[1:36:51] and and and I go back to the thing that
[1:36:55] I've heard over the years right I I be
[1:36:59] like amen
[1:37:02] right I have an absolute
[1:37:05] come on
[1:37:06] I have an absolute I I realize
[1:37:10] um I realized something I've been
[1:37:13] pondering this all week I have a lot of
[1:37:15] thoughts so y'all forgive me I I I I I I
[1:37:17] I'll read the quote if y'all need me to
[1:37:20] but if not can I preach
[1:37:23] just like to preach sometime right you
[1:37:26] know all week you know I was I was
[1:37:29] thinking about I was thinking about the
[1:37:31] ministry of the son of man
[1:37:33] and uh just his testimony of of not
[1:37:38] having a lot of education and things of
[1:37:41] that nature and that kind of lines up
[1:37:43] with scripture because in the book of
[1:37:45] Acts those brother and they weren't very
[1:37:48] schooled right but you had to take note
[1:37:51] that they've been with God Amen is that
[1:37:53] right
[1:37:54] glory to God and I was thinking
[1:37:57] either
[1:37:59] brother Brandon was the biggest deceiver
[1:38:02] of the world has ever known
[1:38:05] or that that was God inspiring
[1:38:11] amen the thought
[1:38:14] and the perspective that we have come on
[1:38:17] y'all still with me
[1:38:19] either either see we got a attribute it
[1:38:24] to the intelligence
[1:38:27] of a man
[1:38:29] which I'm smart enough to realize
[1:38:33] it don't work like that
[1:38:35] it cannot be the intelligence of a man
[1:38:39] because a lot of times we miss God a
[1:38:42] million miles
[1:38:45] amen by simplicity
[1:38:48] right we we jump over the top of God
[1:38:53] because of the way that God unfolds and
[1:38:57] reveals himself
[1:38:59] is that right so then we when we look at
[1:39:03] a Ministry you you realize it couldn't
[1:39:07] be a man
[1:39:09] to to be able to identify himself
[1:39:14] in Scripture
[1:39:17] right
[1:39:18] even when you look back at John the
[1:39:21] Baptist it took something that was
[1:39:24] greater
[1:39:25] than John the Baptist to place him in
[1:39:29] his ministry in scripture and show him
[1:39:33] what he should be doing in his ministry
[1:39:36] that was far beyond a man right
[1:39:42] see
[1:39:43] the prophets know that his ministry was
[1:39:47] so great
[1:39:49] and being at the line that he came up of
[1:39:53] the priesthood God sent him out amen uh
[1:39:57] to the wilderness
[1:39:59] right and when he come back he wasn't
[1:40:03] some smart
[1:40:05] skilled verse man right talking proper
[1:40:12] he's just calling you a bunch of Snakes
[1:40:14] in the Grass
[1:40:16] that's right
[1:40:17] you're watching Devils you bought your
[1:40:19] Snakes in the Grass wait a minute wait a
[1:40:20] minute wait a minute see if he had a
[1:40:23] stayed in that that that lineage in that
[1:40:25] line he would have some sort of big you
[1:40:29] know how y'all smart folk are
[1:40:31] I ain't that smart but I'm not dumb
[1:40:33] either but you know he would have come
[1:40:37] with some word it's like hold on a
[1:40:39] minute let me go Google what that means
[1:40:42] you know
[1:40:44] but he come he come and identifying the
[1:40:48] characteristics of people by nature and
[1:40:52] what he saw the craftiness right of of a
[1:40:56] snake
[1:40:57] and he's seeing that kind of spirit
[1:41:00] being identified see even even when
[1:41:03] Jesus was on the scene Jesus could look
[1:41:07] back because they wanted he they wanted
[1:41:10] to take Jesus life in the book of Saint
[1:41:12] John and Jesus said you know what you
[1:41:15] are your father the devil
[1:41:17] right and they was probably sitting
[1:41:19] there dumbfounded
[1:41:21] right but see Jesus
[1:41:24] he was the absolute amen he was the
[1:41:29] author he was the finish of the faith
[1:41:33] he he was the one that you know from the
[1:41:36] very beginning that could identify
[1:41:39] from from from
[1:41:42] Glory
[1:41:43] this Spirit right
[1:41:47] y'all with me because brother Trevor
[1:41:48] just preached on the serpent sea so can
[1:41:50] I preach
[1:41:52] see he could identify the spirit
[1:41:57] after you know the one Heaven Satan was
[1:42:01] kicked down to earth
[1:42:03] into eating right
[1:42:07] and and and and found a vessel
[1:42:10] that he could blend with
[1:42:14] right and and bring forth his agenda
[1:42:18] reproduce
[1:42:21] Sons after his own kind amen Y'all Gonna
[1:42:25] Make Me preach the serpency but I ain't
[1:42:26] coming to do that right but it's the
[1:42:29] truth
[1:42:30] huh
[1:42:31] the only the only thing that could do
[1:42:34] that watch the serpent
[1:42:36] see in in Mass Humanity's understanding
[1:42:40] now they put him on his belly but he
[1:42:42] wasn't on his belly back in Genesis
[1:42:44] before the fall
[1:42:46] he was a reptile he was upright he was
[1:42:49] close to Adam
[1:42:51] right he had a place for a soul come on
[1:42:55] he could he could reason he could talk
[1:42:59] huh he wasn't some slithering right that
[1:43:04] that his that snake that never would
[1:43:07] have blended with with right Humanity it
[1:43:11] was so close to humanity that his secret
[1:43:16] blend
[1:43:17] and Satan could reproduce after his kind
[1:43:21] yes sir amen glory to God and then Jesus
[1:43:26] following the characteristics
[1:43:30] right this is why the prophet could
[1:43:32] preach uh identification and and and you
[1:43:39] know uh
[1:43:42] identified by its characteristics right
[1:43:45] see that's characteristics that we
[1:43:49] manifest as sons of God Amen
[1:43:51] and Daughters of God and then there's
[1:43:53] other characteristics that's there too
[1:43:56] come on
[1:43:59] glory to God glory to God see
[1:44:02] Satan has characteristics
[1:44:05] see Jesus knew that the characteristics
[1:44:09] of God would not want to kill him
[1:44:14] right glory to God see Jesus was able to
[1:44:19] follow the characteristics all the way
[1:44:21] from Genesis right when Cain slew his
[1:44:26] brother and hit him in in the dirt
[1:44:30] right
[1:44:32] where did jealousy come from
[1:44:37] God
[1:44:41] jealousy come from amen uh Lucifer
[1:44:45] because Lucy was for was jealous of of
[1:44:49] Michael and his kingdom
[1:44:52] and he deceived the third part of the
[1:44:55] Angel right and took him to the size of
[1:44:59] the north and tried to build a bigger
[1:45:01] better looking Kingdom
[1:45:04] right wrong amen Micah had no reason to
[1:45:09] be jealousy is that right
[1:45:11] amen of Lucifer
[1:45:14] glory to God the Creator had no reason
[1:45:18] to be jealous
[1:45:20] jealousy never come from God if you got
[1:45:23] a jealousy Spirit on you that don't come
[1:45:25] from God
[1:45:27] I come from the Devil
[1:45:29] glory glory to God
[1:45:32] amen amen see and so Jesus could watch
[1:45:35] that when when Cain when Cain you know
[1:45:39] they were offering up uh the different
[1:45:42] sacrifices and everything and and and
[1:45:45] you know Cain can't put a lot of work
[1:45:48] you know not a lot of work he put a lot
[1:45:50] of work the whole time was you should
[1:45:53] say put a lot of work into you know
[1:45:55] tilling the soil and bringing forth this
[1:45:58] fruits to the field and everything and
[1:46:00] all of the efforts he put forth and he
[1:46:03] brought that to God
[1:46:04] said boy look at what I've done oh
[1:46:08] what by look at what I've done God
[1:46:10] looked at it say
[1:46:12] well
[1:46:13] that's not going to be accepted
[1:46:17] y'all know I can imagine giving him to
[1:46:20] give him that side side like huh
[1:46:24] y'all know what I'm talking about when
[1:46:25] you hear something that ain't quite
[1:46:26] right you'll be like huh
[1:46:31] okay you don't ask me when there's
[1:46:34] something wrong like huh
[1:46:36] okay whatever but I'm not going for that
[1:46:40] and then Abel Abel comes out amen by
[1:46:45] inspiration
[1:46:46] dragging a lamb
[1:46:49] right dragging a lamb and then
[1:46:52] putting them on the Altar and then
[1:46:58] ain't no good way to say it just hacking
[1:47:01] it
[1:47:02] I know he ain't had no uh Sharp
[1:47:05] you know knives to cut him just oh
[1:47:11] see we won't we want religion beautiful
[1:47:15] non-offensive don't hurt my feelings
[1:47:20] right man will you ever seen that in the
[1:47:23] Bible
[1:47:24] a non-offensive god
[1:47:27] he only he you know blessed is meat is
[1:47:30] not offended
[1:47:32] how could how could you even be offended
[1:47:34] in God
[1:47:36] see
[1:47:37] but he he hacks it and and God said
[1:47:40] that's it
[1:47:42] right see here's the thing and we don't
[1:47:46] want to come to grips with this because
[1:47:48] of our reasoning
[1:47:50] right that that there's a way that
[1:47:52] seeming right unto a man right
[1:47:57] there's things that God accept and
[1:47:59] there's things that God ain't gonna
[1:48:00] accept
[1:48:01] see in the minds of people in today's
[1:48:04] society and that's why I liked it uh my
[1:48:08] brother Quinn's in his message on
[1:48:09] pronouns and stuff we we got all of this
[1:48:13] stuff that Humanity wants us to accept
[1:48:19] see but then you know God anoints a
[1:48:23] young man and takes him in the scripture
[1:48:26] back to the original
[1:48:29] right and shows him that that the
[1:48:34] pronouns are there but you gotta keep
[1:48:36] them in line with the scripture
[1:48:40] right
[1:48:42] you got to keep things in line so and
[1:48:45] and see 30 years ago I wouldn't have had
[1:48:48] to preach on pronouns
[1:48:50] come on Church
[1:48:53] I could preachers to the team she come
[1:48:55] up with me
[1:48:56] right oh and sister Shonda some of them
[1:48:59] see we was we was the young people back
[1:49:01] then
[1:49:03] now I'm at retirement age thank you
[1:49:05] Jesus came retired but you know I'm
[1:49:08] getting there I remember when we were in
[1:49:10] our 20s
[1:49:12] I was 25 and they were
[1:49:16] 2019 and 18 and all of that but we're
[1:49:20] still here
[1:49:21] right but we we we wouldn't have been
[1:49:25] confused about this
[1:49:27] gender identity
[1:49:30] I'm I'm identified no your girl if you
[1:49:34] got girl parts
[1:49:35] you're a boy if you got good parts and
[1:49:37] God don't make no mistakes all it is you
[1:49:40] got a spirit on you that's all that is
[1:49:42] that's all that is
[1:49:45] somewhere I can't grasp it I don't fully
[1:49:49] understanding but I realize if you come
[1:49:52] with male parts you're male God didn't
[1:49:55] make no mistakes just somewhere a little
[1:49:59] something got on you
[1:50:01] right come on come on
[1:50:05] some kind of spirit got on you and
[1:50:08] eventually you just manifesting that
[1:50:10] Spirit nobody was able to get that thing
[1:50:13] up off you but you can't be you can't be
[1:50:17] oh
[1:50:19] uh he her she they you can't be all of
[1:50:23] that you can only be a woman or a man
[1:50:27] come on y'all know what I'm talking
[1:50:29] about we we we
[1:50:32] didn't have that problem
[1:50:34] right and then it's a real struggle that
[1:50:37] they're fighting for these things
[1:50:40] right glory to God and and see here's
[1:50:44] the thing Satan has Unleashed
[1:50:49] [Applause]
[1:50:55] all these things upon the Earth this one
[1:51:00] the sovereignty of God we needed
[1:51:03] somebody to come on to see and inform us
[1:51:07] before these things actually took place
[1:51:12] amen
[1:51:13] and see some of the things that
[1:51:16] we couldn't quite grasp now we look at
[1:51:21] and say Amen thank you Jesus
[1:51:26] right amen Satan's Eden
[1:51:30] the goddess evil age to identify
[1:51:35] right right scriptially
[1:51:39] amen that we could travel a serpent
[1:51:43] grape silly
[1:51:45] so that we can have an absolute in this
[1:51:48] age that we living in see when we look
[1:51:52] at his ministry
[1:51:54] God had to take him back to Malachi 4.
[1:51:58] right and show him here's your
[1:52:03] scripture that you'll manifest
[1:52:08] right
[1:52:10] Amen on the Earth
[1:52:12] this will be your scripture this will be
[1:52:15] what you stand on right and this you'll
[1:52:20] take this and this will be your approach
[1:52:22] to the Bible
[1:52:24] especially
[1:52:26] your ministry would be to turn the
[1:52:30] hearts of the people
[1:52:32] right according to Malachi 4 turn the
[1:52:37] people
[1:52:38] back to God back to the word back the
[1:52:42] scripture back the Pentecost that's why
[1:52:46] he could preach all of that right
[1:52:49] because he identified himself
[1:52:52] amen with Malachi 4 and now the second
[1:52:58] part of what Jesus said in Matthew 17
[1:53:01] right he was he go come and and and
[1:53:06] and he'll turn things back is that right
[1:53:09] see
[1:53:11] this is the time where uh
[1:53:15] you got so much tradition
[1:53:18] so many things that so contrary to Bible
[1:53:23] that that we we need it
[1:53:28] right we needed the correct
[1:53:32] interpretation
[1:53:34] right of scripture see if you build in
[1:53:39] something you gotta build it according
[1:53:40] to the blueprint amen come on
[1:53:44] if you don't could you imagine what
[1:53:48] you're gonna have
[1:53:50] right
[1:53:51] when you get to the end of that thing
[1:53:53] now I'm in construction now you'd be
[1:53:55] like great day hi in the world am I
[1:53:59] gonna make this work you not
[1:54:01] you're not gonna make that work
[1:54:04] because because you decided to do
[1:54:05] something in your own now you're not
[1:54:07] gonna be able to fit that you're gonna
[1:54:09] have to tear that thing right back down
[1:54:10] to the foundation
[1:54:12] right
[1:54:14] and see I take for instance you know
[1:54:16] what as a young man I probably was
[1:54:18] baptized by at least three times
[1:54:21] I was baptized in the Baptist Church and
[1:54:24] and titles
[1:54:26] a father-son and the Holy Ghost I was
[1:54:30] baptized twice like that once in New
[1:54:31] Jersey and once in in uh Riviera Beach
[1:54:34] and it wasn't until I came to the word
[1:54:39] that I was baptized correctly you say
[1:54:42] baptism don't matter
[1:54:44] that ain't what giant talked because
[1:54:47] because when John the Baptist uh
[1:54:50] when Paul came on the scene the the
[1:54:53] people the people had been baptized
[1:54:56] under John's baptism right
[1:55:00] and and they didn't even know nothing
[1:55:02] about no Holy Ghost
[1:55:05] right glory to God and so when when when
[1:55:09] Paul came first the first thing Paul
[1:55:12] asked him how was you baptized
[1:55:16] do you got the Holy Ghost well bad we'll
[1:55:19] do it about the Holy Ghost that one
[1:55:20] preached
[1:55:21] well then how was your baptized unto
[1:55:24] John's baptism
[1:55:25] see
[1:55:28] Paul commanded them to be
[1:55:31] rebaptized not entitles
[1:55:34] but in the name
[1:55:36] right not one in no titles it was in the
[1:55:40] name of the Lord Jesus Christ right
[1:55:44] and when they did they received the Holy
[1:55:47] Ghost
[1:55:48] is that right come on Church come on
[1:55:51] Church
[1:55:52] people I think people are afraid of of
[1:55:55] Truth and I know a lot of ministers are
[1:55:57] afraid of a meal ticket
[1:56:01] right yes Jesus did say go ye therefore
[1:56:06] Matthew 28 19 and baptize
[1:56:09] right in the name right
[1:56:12] hey
[1:56:13] but then when when Peter and them at the
[1:56:17] day of Pentecost which was the start of
[1:56:21] the New Testament Church
[1:56:23] and Peter them were the ones that Jesus
[1:56:25] was talking to
[1:56:27] that he gave the initial commission to
[1:56:29] right
[1:56:31] when they received the Holy Ghost and
[1:56:34] and they they came out and and Peter was
[1:56:38] preaching and and he had his Amen Corner
[1:56:42] right first and foremost
[1:56:45] if Peter was saying something that was
[1:56:48] contrary to scripture Revelation the
[1:56:51] Brethren that was with him when they was
[1:56:53] given the commission would have stopped
[1:56:56] and first and foremost come on he
[1:56:59] wouldn't had no witness he wouldn't have
[1:57:01] had no Amen Corner no preachs no preach
[1:57:05] be to preach
[1:57:07] come on preach with me somebody
[1:57:09] uh y'all know what I'm talking about
[1:57:11] because if somebody come up in here and
[1:57:13] they say something contrary to what you
[1:57:16] know y'all know to be true
[1:57:21] be like oh
[1:57:24] well I know it's been times boy back in
[1:57:26] the days of barbecue Tabernacle boy well
[1:57:30] I really folks come up in there with
[1:57:32] that stuff just get real quiet
[1:57:34] I'd be like oh you're not gonna pass
[1:57:36] that one over on them they've been
[1:57:38] taught a little bit better than that
[1:57:40] right glory to God Amen
[1:57:45] you know so so they they amended because
[1:57:50] they knew that it was quickened he had a
[1:57:53] revelation of what Jesus was talking
[1:57:57] about not titles but names
[1:58:02] see I I got titles
[1:58:05] right I'm a grandfather now thank you
[1:58:08] Jesus
[1:58:10] huh I'm a father I'm a uh those are my
[1:58:13] titles but those are not my names
[1:58:17] right my name is Willie Arrow smiley
[1:58:21] right that's my name I can't go put on
[1:58:24] my check
[1:58:26] Daddy
[1:58:28] not unless that's my literal name on my
[1:58:31] birth certificate and and and driver's
[1:58:35] license and I'd have to be looking at my
[1:58:37] mother like I don't know what y'all was
[1:58:41] on when y'all was thinking about me
[1:58:43] Daddy
[1:58:45] huh now that could be a nickname
[1:58:49] daddy boy or something like that but
[1:58:51] real name no but they had a revelation
[1:58:54] right amen and then so here's the thing
[1:59:02] the son of man Ministry
[1:59:05] was to tie up the Loose Ends do it do
[1:59:10] away with the unscriptural
[1:59:13] uh traditions and things that are not
[1:59:19] truth
[1:59:20] right
[1:59:22] because see if if you build something
[1:59:25] right that's not according to the
[1:59:28] blueprint what you got
[1:59:31] come on see so so we need it in the
[1:59:37] evening time because
[1:59:39] uh uh God was restoring spiritual Eve
[1:59:45] right
[1:59:46] bringing her back to the original word
[1:59:49] we needed a word church I'm gonna go in
[1:59:52] a second we needed a word church
[1:59:56] and the only way that we could produce
[1:59:59] this we had got to get back to Sea
[2:00:04] right
[2:00:07] we had got that we we had to get back so
[2:00:11] that we'll understand what his coming
[2:00:15] Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 Revelation 10 7
[2:00:21] what this ministry because God could not
[2:00:24] do anything outside of his prophet
[2:00:28] right
[2:00:30] but what showing us if you study if you
[2:00:34] study his ministry he was just trying to
[2:00:36] show us in the early stages
[2:00:39] uh uh scripturally why he's here
[2:00:45] and and and
[2:00:46] by this scripture this is my Ministry
[2:00:51] come on
[2:00:52] bodies I'm not just out here doing
[2:00:54] something by these scriptures
[2:00:58] constantly elude pointing back to these
[2:01:02] scriptures
[2:01:03] right
[2:01:04] because if he could get you to see his
[2:01:08] ministry
[2:01:10] according to scripture
[2:01:13] and you can understand why he's here and
[2:01:18] what he's doing he knows you won't have
[2:01:22] no problem when he starts to break down
[2:01:27] the word
[2:01:29] do away with tradition straighten up
[2:01:33] water baptism straighten up the godhead
[2:01:36] you won't have no problem because you'll
[2:01:40] understand scripturally why he's healed
[2:01:44] why he's here and what is Ministry
[2:01:48] entails right his ministry was going to
[2:01:52] take us back to the book of Acts
[2:01:55] right back to the Bible back the
[2:01:58] Pentecost that's why I could say
[2:02:00] earnestly contend for the faith in order
[2:02:03] to do that you gotta go back to the
[2:02:05] beginning
[2:02:06] back to the original thoughts and plans
[2:02:09] of God right see by being a prophet he
[2:02:14] could go all the way back to Genesis
[2:02:17] come on and see the first and perfect
[2:02:20] acts then when he gets to the New
[2:02:23] Testament Amen to Booker acts he can go
[2:02:27] back to the first and perfect acts the
[2:02:30] first and perfect teachings amen right
[2:02:33] amen glory to God realizing that in this
[2:02:36] age when when everything has been turned
[2:02:40] loose he realizes that you know what uh
[2:02:44] uh the people has has been turned back
[2:02:48] to the original and tied right there
[2:02:54] make it make a knot and I'm tired there
[2:02:57] that when the storms of life get the
[2:03:00] Raging and everything is coming against
[2:03:03] us and we're being tossed but we're
[2:03:06] tired
[2:03:08] oh y'all don't talk to me we're being
[2:03:11] tossed
[2:03:13] greatest battle ever being photos in our
[2:03:15] mind but we tied
[2:03:18] [Music]
[2:03:19] huh glory to God young people your mind
[2:03:25] that's why you got a cast down reasoning
[2:03:28] cast down Imagine It cast down things is
[2:03:32] that right
[2:03:33] be tied to Christ be tied to the word
[2:03:37] want to know more about the word because
[2:03:39] the word shows you who you are exactly
[2:03:43] right brother amen when everything is
[2:03:45] going on in school and and everybody's
[2:03:48] doing their thing I was 15 a long time
[2:03:50] ago

[2:04:30] happening

[2:04:35] thing it's a struggle and and there's
[2:04:39] something deep in you like I'm doing

[2:13:39] truth

[2:14:10] of God but he all right he ain't all

[2:14:48] always going to be transparent
[2:14:51] amen he'll tell you about the things of
[2:14:54] his past and the Lord brought him
[2:14:56] through that for us
[2:14:58] he brought brother Smiley through those
[2:15:01] things to keep our young people from
[2:15:02] going that way
[2:15:03] all these Servants of God what they go
[2:15:06] through in their lives is for us we want
[2:15:10] to talk about predestination
[2:15:12] and you look at what brother Jack he'll
[2:15:15] get up and preach I went through this I
[2:15:17] went through this I went through this
[2:15:19] brother Quentin brother Quaker brother
[2:15:22] Troy brother smiling I went through this
[2:15:25] God made allowed them to go through that
[2:15:27] so that they can bring and get to our
[2:15:29] level to help us to come up higher
[2:15:33] so that we don't have the same pitfalls
[2:15:36] so when a man of God stands up here and
[2:15:38] brings a truth to you like that you have
[2:15:40] to sit back and look at your life
[2:15:42] re-evaluate your life and say okay this
[2:15:46] right here will not be a stunning Stone
[2:15:48] but a stepping stone I want to draw
[2:15:50] closer to my Lord look at the man of God
[2:15:52] and where he is now I know where I've
[2:15:55] been where the Lord brought me from and
[2:15:57] I can Rejoice with my brother amen let's
[2:15:59] give our God another hand clap of Christ
[2:16:03] man he said some mighty good things and
[2:16:06] I was just thinking of
[2:16:08] when he was talking about his mother
[2:16:11] and I see all young people sometimes and
[2:16:13] you just pray for them
[2:16:15] it's hard to be alone
[2:16:18] it's very hard to be alone
[2:16:20] and I was thinking back to Genesis when
[2:16:22] God kept saying it was good it was good
[2:16:25] I created this it was good it was good
[2:16:27] and Satan's sitting back watching
[2:16:29] everything is good
[2:16:30] then God said it's not good
[2:16:33] for man to be alone
[2:16:35] Satan said that's where I get in right
[2:16:37] there it's not good so when people are
[2:16:41] alone Satan always comes and that's when
[2:16:43] he tried to attack he'll make you think
[2:16:45] bad things about yourself when you are
[2:16:47] alone when you're with other believers
[2:16:49] you feel powerful but when you get alone
[2:16:51] that's when the enemy comes amen so pray
[2:16:54] for one another always amen let's stand
[2:16:57] to our feet let's sing this little song
[2:17:03] I need you Lord
