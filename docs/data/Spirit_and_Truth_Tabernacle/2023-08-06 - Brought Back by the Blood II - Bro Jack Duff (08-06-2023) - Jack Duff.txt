give a little testimony about the trip over to uh over to Dubai it's a beautiful place [Music] but it's a heat that's hellish that's the closest I want to get to Hell feeling the heat like that you will pay a price and I'm feeling that in my body right now you know we were out on the desert I guess it was like 118 during the day in 99 at night you know you're doing all that sweating got back in the car and uh the uh God he had the air right on me I just got sick and been fighting that devil since but we had a nice trip over to Dubai when we got got ready to go through immigration they stopped shalom on her passport they put a m for male instead of female on there and over in an Arab country they don't play that you come over there with that foolishness you spending 18 years in jail they'll stop you at the gate so they were sending Shalom back to what they call desk one so Naomi went back with Shalom to that's one actually we all went back to desk one and as we got back there we were sitting and waiting and then I told Naomi I'm gonna go ahead and get the luggage she told me to take Josiah and her that's what that's with me so we went out side of immigration once you go outside of immigration you cannot come back in so we went on the other side of immigration and uh first thing I know to do is pray so I began to speak to the Lord about these situations you know right in the airport Arab country but I bow my head and I pray then I text Brother Jack because I know once I talk to my Lord he's given me a Shepherd so I'm going to contact Brother Jack and let brother Jack know what's going on over here and I don't remember if it was me or brother Jack put it in the group with the brothers now I know when the brothers begin to pray things begin to change we go to war every other Tuesday night and we know that the sisters go to war every other Tuesday night so I know things begin to happen so I was sitting on a luggage and I sat there and I said my wife and daughter would come through those Gates so I sat there about 30 minutes just watching the gates with expectation waiting on my my wife and my daughter to come through the gates but he is an on-time God he may not come when you want him but he'll be on time so I stood up and I went to the gate Naomi uh she called me and she said look they getting ready to send me and Shalom back so they took us back to departure and they're getting ready to send us back I said how what are you going to do when you get back I have the keys with me you'll be stuck at the airport so I went to uh the man at the uh where they they scanned you coming out I said look they're getting ready to send my wife and my daughter back because of a mistake on the on the passport and um I need to get her the keys so he called somebody and two gentlemen came out they told my children to stay and they took me to the back when they took me to the back they said what is actually going on so I expressed to them what was going on and Naomi sent me a text she said look I just tried to get a hold of a consulate in Miami they sent me over to the Embassy I spoke to somebody in the embassy they said that they cannot do the paperwork that we need until Monday morning but they're going to send us back so I expressed this to the gentleman they said who did she talk to I said uh she talked to somebody at the embassy he said hold on the other gentleman he pulled me aside he said stand next to me so I stood next to him while the other guy got on the phone he started talking to whoever was on the phone he started pacing up and down for about 10 minutes the guy part of me he came and stood next to me and the other guy got on the phone he said stand right here next to him so he went on he started talking he came back he said things are in place we're waiting on the embassy to make their move so you stand right here I said My Two children are still on the other side and my wife and my daughter they're down here in departure he said just stand here we'll get your children so they went and got Josiah and Hadassah and brought to them to where I was and after that it was just a waiting game so as we waited after about almost an hour we see Naomi and Shalom coming then it's Naomi Shalom would come and then the other two gentlemen they came back from some big meeting over there and when they came back from the meeting they said come up to the front so they called me up to the front I had to become a guarantee for Shalom and then they sent me around paid this little fee come back they stamped my passport took my passport gave me a printout of my passport stamped it and stabbed shalom's a letter and they said wherever you go you use this for your passport but we need you to come back Monday to pick up your passport so we did everything else we actually got back to the hotel about three in the morning then the wedding was supposed to start at 10 started a little late [Music] five hours five hours we we had a church service first then we had a wedding so the next morning I sort of overslept so we went later that evening the guy told me you have to come back in the morning you can't come here at this time so brother Jack had given me some instructions take somebody with you that can make calls for you and take a brother from from the church well I didn't find a brother from the church to go with me so me and my wife we actually we went back up to immigration when we get to immigration we sat there for a while and then they told me your wife must stay here you have to come to the bank so they gave me instructions on where to go so I went back to the back and here I am in the office with the head people of immigration so as I'm talking to the people in Immigration I said I'm here to pick up my passports this was the instruction that was giving me said sir you cannot pick up your passport you have to make um you have to make an uh an appointment with the consulate here so he said you make the call from right here so I kept trying to call trying to call I couldn't get through he said you go to the website make an appointment because you can go no further until you make an appointment so I went online and I kept trying to put it and he said he asked me when we were leaving I said Thursday morning they don't have an appointment I won't have an appointment with them until Monday morning he said stand right here he walked out he went down the hall he came back and he had he got the top man in immigration and he began to speak with the top man and the man asked me what was the situation and I told him when we were in the United States we found out that there was a mistake on my daughter's passport so we went to get a new passport for her and they said even if we even if we expedited this passport she would not get it back in time but what you need to do is take her birth certificate so we did what we were told I said she was born a girl she's a girl now I said um I brought up her birth certificate they said it don't matter what the birth certificate says it's what the passport says but the the gentleman that was over everything he said let him through [Music] [Applause] and when he said let him through there it was a big weight that that came off my shoulder you know I had been meditating on on a quote that brother Brandon was talking to the people he said you know sometimes God just want to prove to his children he has muscles he said every man every father feels that way sometimes they'll go around the children they just Flex a little bit he said I like to do that with my girls flexing they say daddy you have such big muscles he said God loves to do that sometimes he allows situation to rise just to flex his muscles and show who he really is so when I was standing there and I made my declaration my wife and my daughter will be coming through here it was right after I said I'm a Son of God I don't care where I am I'm a Son of God and if I'm a Son of God I'm not going to get frustrated with what's going on I'm just going to speak and wait for it to come to pass my wife and my daughter came walking through them doors it may have been around three three o'clock in the morning but they came walking through he is an on-time God hallelujah [Music] [Applause] praise the Lord and I'm just going to keep it short like that I got ready to

I'll certainly bring you uh an update but keep the keep our church in prayer amen we we we plan on moving out of here amen God is good God is good all right all right Ephesians chapter 2. Ephesians chapter 2. and uh we will read just verse 13 through 16. amen Journey continues with brought back by the blood amen the Bible says but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off mate are mate 9 by the blood of Christ for he is our peace who have made both one and hath broken down the middle wall a petition between us having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of Commandments contained in ordinances for to make in himself of Twain one new man so making peace and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross having slain an enmity thereby let's bow our heads in a word of prayer father we thank you for all that you have done in this service thus far and as we have gathered in this place uh Lords because we want to all closer to you we pray that you would take control of the word now not only has this been preached but also as it is being received father we pray the Holy Ghost would help us to see what it is that you want us to see in your word today and got me you get all the glory all the honor and all uh the praise we take every spirit that is against the spirit of God underneath the control of the Holy Ghost even right now it's in Jesus name we pray amen and amen God bless you you can be seated praise the Lord amen we started a little journey a couple weeks ago on this sermon brought back by the blood amen and uh I kind of left you uh in limbo on on a statement and hopefully today we'll get there to be able to kind of help clear it up but um we could never uh talk enough about what the blood of Jesus has done for us amen uh if we ever got a true understanding of the power of the blood amen and and um I I know for myself uh God had to give me a revelation of it just through a little vision and uh and what happened to me I was in prayer one time and I sincerely just wanted to get on my knees and just pray and seek the Lord I had that desire and as I'm praying it just seems like uh Satan just stopped bombarding my mind with everything that I did wrong uh every every wicked and evil thing I did Satan would just bring it back you did this you did that you did this you think God gonna hear your prayer after you did that I'm like my goodness he just had me in a spot where I felt like ain't no sense in me praying and uh you know and when I got to that spot God just kind of opened up my uh my mind a little bit he just gave me a little vision I got a glimpse of the blood and when I just saw the blood I realized there was nothing against me because I have been washed in the blood right and and when I when I realized that my I got a breakthrough in my prayer and uh and the devil was finished at that moment and I'm gonna tell you not only in that prayer but every prayer after that the devil was done in my life there was nothing oh come on somebody the Bible said there is there is therefore now no [Applause] there is therefore now no condemnation right so when I when I really and only the blood could put me in a position where there is no condemnation together brother you talk about the devil finish and when you get a true Revelation what the blood of Christ has done for you I don't care what your past is the blood makes you a new creature the blood makes you a new creation come on somebody the blood wipes away your past we read a quote on on the last time brother random say it's like it's like Clorox and having a man just a little drop of ink and they say you take that drop of ink and then you just drop it in the Clorox it says it was the ink I mean you get ink on your shirt you in trouble you get ink on your dress you in trouble that ink stain will stay there but if you put ink and Clorox he said that the ink disintegrates in the chloride he say that ink actually becomes the Clorox the Clorox is just that strong that it changes the chemistry of the ink come on somebody and he said that's the same way it is with the blood of the Lord Jesus it changes the chemistry of things it changes the way we think about things it changes the way we approach things the blood changes everything so I was reading this quote out of condemnation by representation because this is where my thought actually came from a man and you know this is a to me a very powerful sermon uh that brother Brandon preaches there's a lot of things in there that he says uh but but but uh he's just bringing out a lot you know there and uh and when he made this statement about the blood inside the sermon it just really blessed my heart condemnation by representation he says this Jesus died that he might breathe back oh my I love that that he might breathe back oh Hallelujah only the blood can do that he says only through the chemistry of the blood of Jesus Christ can breed back again a person that won't vary one word from what God Said now now this is important Jesus died so he might breathe back bring us back to this spot we won't vary from not one word that God says he says uh Eve showed her weakness amen the church showed what what she did she said well maybe you're right maybe God won't hold me responsible because uh we'll say what difference does it make as long as I'm baptized what difference does it make as long as says oh that shows you need another breathing when you're compromising with the word you need another breeding he says that shows that something's got to come back to you to bring you to a faith that what God Said not one jot or one Tittle shall pass from God's word till all is fulfilled let every man's word be a lie and his be true Christ came that he might breathe back by the Holy Spirit it says oh brother as we sit together now in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus the Holy Spirit breathing upon us like we are now breathing back I just love these words breeding back taking away the rubbish of theology amen and that that's so important to me the blood the blood is what brought you out of denomination can I say this The Blood also keeps you out of denomination the blood brought you out of the world Amen the blood keeps you from the things of the world a man breathing back taking away the rubbish of theology taking away the rubbish Of The World man-made doctrines having forms of godliness deny the power that thereof breed it back into an unadulterated faith in God Amen he says uh Jesus that same say oh I know it is written but you know it said thou shall eat Jesus said and it's also written it's also yes it's written in that that he'll do this and you shall term these it says if you are the Son of God you can perform a miracle here before me and turn these songs into bread let me see you do it he'd be minding Satan see the shrewdness of God there it's written man should not live by bread alone see him right with the word he he defeated Satan every time right on the word he stayed with the word and if he came to breed us back to Sons and Daughters of God like he was at the beginning how can we get away from the word then how can we ever get anywhere till we get back to the word the Holy Ghost came to breed us back now you know I went through some things there when you talk about breeding uh they have this thing they call it uh selective breeding and this is where they bring certain animals together try to make stronger and better faster bigger better animals when they do selective breeding come on somebody and you know and and they're on to something there right because when brother Branham uses the term breeding back it's the word that came amen and connected with us and through the connection word God is breathing back Sons and Daughters of God and he said only the blood can bring us back to that position the very thing that Adam lost in the beginning the blood takes us back to it you know before seeing it was perfect Fellowship in the garden no headaches no no no no no no hospital visits amen didn't have to worry about anything it was just a perfect condition that that Adam and Eve walked in before sin came into the god the blood takes us back into that condition hallelujah hallelujah that's why we ought to thank God for this for the for the blood you can have peace right now in the midst of whatever you're going through he is your peace amen amen this this this this this this uh when we talk about the blood I just want to make the statement since the beginning of time God has required blood to satisfy the dead of sin now you know um as I was thinking on this you know just a little bit more you know they was telling me well I read a little something about you know uh uh sharks when they when they smell blood that that shark if he smells blood then he he's on the attack right he's looking for something to attack when he smells blood but but it just kind of it just um a thought kind of crossed my say hi to shark's mind because of sin because of the fall of Man how the shark operates like that but God when he sees blood it actually stops him from attacking come on somebody it it's a total different thing in the mind of God it stops a man God from acts it stops to destroy an angel from coming into the land when God sees blood oh Hallelujah it stops uh uh I mean even brother Brandon when he had the experience of of seeing the the blood of Christ as a bumper for his sins he say those black spots that were leaving the Earth amen says if they were to come into the presence of God he would have been done for just one spot make it into the presence of God he would have been done for but because the blood was there as a cover the blood was there as a bumper it was his protection not only his protection but it's our protection since the beginning of time God has required blood to satisfy the dead of sin amen and and I want to you know just kind of take us back on this journey through the Garden of Eden because we realize that Adam and Eve fail Adam fell willfully so what happened there in the Garden of Eden he did this willfully Eve was tricked she was deceived by amen the serpent who was anointed by the devil glory to God they committed this adulterous act there in the Garden of Eden amen that was the problem it was adultery in the Garden of Eden amen and when that adulterous act took place glory to God Adam and Eve recognized that they were out of fellowship with God and when it was time for church that night God would come down every evening Amen in the cooler the evening he would have fellowship and a church service be set up and my what a wonderful service they would have but this one day God shows up for church and his congregation is not there something happened to his congregation now they ought to know that God knows exactly where they are let me tell you something you can't hide from God and you can't run from God God got a way of tracking you down he left certain situations occur amen and then he brings you back into his presence amen it's the love of God Amen so so here Adam and Eve they're they're running amen from God and in the Garden of Eden and God just began to ask a question Adam Adam Where Art Thou now he he didn't have to ask that question like God didn't know where they was but he needed Adam to kind of own up to his mistake own up to what you've done and even when he began to ask Adam question he never really owned up to it the one the woman you gave me did this he put the blame on God the woman you gave me caused me to do no no no no no she she was she was uh I mean she was so beautiful to you Adam right you called a woman you you even gave a name and everything she was so beautiful to you Adam you knew you said now you're gonna blame it on God for giving you this woman no no no no no well e what you what what happened in the god well the serpent that you come on now this y'all can't keep passing the buck like this own up to what you've done and when they came to church they came dressed a little different they they had a fig Leaf tied around them and God God said now where where uh where you get this understanding from why are you dressed like that coming to church well uh we uh we found out that we were naked a word they never used before a word they never expressed before but this is new vocabulary we are naked how did you discover that you were naked brother Branham said see they had a holy Veil that they couldn't recognize that they were naked but now today there is an Unholy Veil and then then the land of seeing churches they don't realize they are naked spiritually naked good God almighty but it said he says look here he say he says uh Adam what is this what's going on it's like well you know that all this happened and and say look that that fig leaf that you got that ain't gonna do it that ain't gonna do it that ain't gonna get it fixed now this did not surprise God when anytime anything go wrong God is not surprised I need you to understand God God is not in in a tizzy trying to figure out what he gonna do God already knew what he was gonna do it was only a man a part of his great plan so there was a statement that was made here and I want to read it out of Genesis 3 and 21. glory to God God was requiring blood all the way from Genesis amen and and and and after God realized that their their their their their fig Leafs weren't going to do it this is what the Bible say unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothe them so so here we have god making a man coats of skins and he's giving them closer you're gonna need this in order to to get yourself you know if you want to be appropriate now and coming to church you're going to need this hello somebody I mean when you want to come to church you got to come come under the blood the covering of the blood if you ever want to come into the presence of God you're gonna have to come under the covering of the blood Hallelujah and he's telling them he said he said now you're gonna you're gonna we're gonna need these coaster skins now now this is this is important to me because the prophet tells us amen first of all we got two prophets talking let me put it this way the prophet Moses tells us that God gave them a man coats of skins that's what the prophet Moses tells us come on somebody but then the prophet William Branham goes a little deeper than what Moses said and let me tell you they're going to the same mind of God and bringing these things forward to us and God's Prophet told us that what these coasts of skin that's all the Bible said close to skin what skin can so a prophet tells us today that God used a lamb took a lamb took the skin off the lamb bleeding bloody skin of the Lamb wrapped it on Adam and when they're going to church they can feel the blood hitting their legs they can feel the blood dropping on their feet hey you ought to feel the blood this morning you are the field of blood every day the bleeding blood of Jesus he says it was a lamb that God took and he took the skin off the lamb and it gave it to Adam and Eve come on somebody glory to God and I like to say it like this if you can leave the prophet Moses can talk about coats of skins and Moses was not in Eden if you can believe Moses then you can also believe William praying him because he had the same prophetic office to tell us what happened there in needing why would it be a lamb why would God take a lamb because God knew that there was a lamb sling before the foundation of the world and there was a lamb that was going to be slain at Calvary so God slew a lamb in the Garden of Eden amen it was just amen a type of what he was gonna do at Calvary he wrapped Adam and Eve in Blood and he's rap you and me in blood we've been brought back praise God by the blood Adam could come to church because of the blood he could come to church because of the blood you are here today [Music] [Applause] because of blood [Applause] you can come here dude and have that blood Adam I want you to come to church but you can't come in a fig Leaf like that you're gonna need this wrap yourself in this atom and come on back let's have some church in the book of Exodus God talked about blood they were getting ready to take an exodus they were leaving Egypt they were leaving the things of the world come on somebody amen but before they left there were certain plays that dropped amen and and the last plague was the plague of death and and the way God set up is then I look now uh this play gonna come now y'all seen all the other ones and and I mean rain uh you saw frogs you saw uh uh lice you saw you saw all kind of stuff right he says now now you saw me turn you turn turn The Ward into blood you saw it he said you know what I mean business now here's the last one this is going to be the plague of death now here's what's going to take somebody gonna have to take some blood and put it on the on the top of the door and on the sides of the door say it now when this when the angel the death angel passes through the land the house that has the blood on it is a house that would be spared Hallelujah glory to God let's pick it up here in Exodus 12 verse 5 through 7. the house that has the blood is the house that's going to be spared if you don't have blood the firstborn son is good as dead from the house of pharaoh to the to to every house that was in Goshen this is the one plague that everybody was impacted by some of the other plagues it was only in Egypt Goshen was was free but when it came to blood everybody had to apply whether he was in Egypt or in Goshen you better make sure you have blood Exodus 12 Hallelujah it says your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year so you just couldn't go off of God anything it had to be your best right your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year you shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats he says and ye shall keep it until the 14th day of the same month and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening don't not in the morning but you kill this lamb in the evening and when you kill an evening and they shall take the blood and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the house wearing you they sell wearing they shall eat it so so here they had a commandment before they were going to leave Egypt before The Exodus was to occur they had to take the blood from the lamb and put it on the top of the door and on the sides of the door and I don't care if you just freshly painted your house last week I just went out to Home Depot and I got fresh paint and then the profit gonna come up with this put blood on my door with this fresh paint job look I mean I don't care God didn't care what you had just done to your house you better have blood and sometimes you know Daddy can get a little attitude with the prophet you know what I mean Daddy can get mad at the prophet private said this Prophet said that Prophet said this Prophet said that but see look look the firstborn of the household was the one that's gonna die so I can see the boy going to his daddy that I know you got problems with the prophet but daddy this ain't gonna affect you my question is do you love me I'm your first born son do you love me well if you love me whether you got a problem with a prophet or not because this thing happened the prophet saying it that thing happened the prophet said please please happen Prophet said water turned to blood and turn the blood I don't seen everything the prophet said come to pass nah nah he said put blood up there where the lamb at that we're gonna slay the Slam in the evening everything the prophet said we gonna do it [Music] save that lamb put that blood up on the door say okay now I can rest in peace I can go in here and lay down because I know I've done exactly what the prophet said and when the death angel came through the land the houses that did not have that blood applied you heard screams coming all through the homes Pharaoh's home there and loud screaming coming from there his his firstborn son is gone the heir to his throne is gone because they did not apply blood see God God always wanted this Blood to be applied even today even today I want to read this this this quote out of the message token uh God God wants the blood to be applied even today we must have the blood hallelujah look at what the prophet says here in the sermon in the token it says now if you get that in Genesis 4 10 then in Hebrews 12 24 start reading in Hebrews 12 24 the blood of Jesus speaketh better things than that see Abel he was a righteous man he died he died innocent because he was in the way he was in the way standing for the real Revelation he had he spoke it cried out the Justice blood of Abel cried out against Cain amen because Cain slayed his brother all because of a blood sacrifice amen Abel cried out against Cain amen but the blood of Jesus Christ not only cried out it redeemed amen it speaketh better things it makes you Sons and Daughters it hides you the blood of Jesus it hides you from the wrath of God oh my my I just I just I I you know uh um when when Moses was getting ready to go back down into Egypt to take uh to to to go back and bring Deliverance to the children of Israel the angel Lord came seeking for Moses and and I mean a prophet the angel came to kill the prophet that had just been ordained to go down to Egypt and as a as an angel coming to kill the prophet uh the wife realized that Moses forgot to do something Moses was supposed to take his boys and circumcised them boys and even got to do it so the wife found a rock come on somebody I found himself a couple rocks and she circumcised her own boys and then took the skin threw it at her I had a husband's feet said brother Bram said what a wife what a woman that Moses chose for a wife took the skin and threw it down at her husband feet and then she made this sense you're a bloody man to me see it was blood God was requiring blood right but uh but it stopped the Angel God from destroying Moses amen now look let's let's go on here he says you see the blood he says the blood is what eyes hides you from the wrath of God right it says the blood of Abel could not hide Cain but the blood of Jesus came amen so Cain come out today if you've been a persecuted against the word and say the days of Miracles past this thing is all nonsense the thing is crying out the blood of Jesus Christ uh cries out but there's forgiveness in this if you'll just accept it wish we could stay a little while on that blood speaketh better things and it goes on says believe for safety amen then apply Hallelujah believe for uh here's here's what you want to believe for you want your own safety you believe for your safety then apply the token for the whole family you say how can I do that claim it if it worked on you then you and the word becomes one amen amen see it works for both of you so mamas and daughters apply the token towards your families amen he said this applied to your loved ones like Rahab did she applied the token to her father she applied it to her mother she applied it to her brothers and sisters and and got them all in you apply say Lord I'm going after my son I'm going after my daughter I claim her amen Satan you turn her loose I don't care what they involved in Satan you turn her loose you turn him loose I claim them they are my children my God my God why my my daughter had gave birth to our granddaughter this week and now she had a natural birth and you know they were just telling us all the little things that happened in the room as she going through this process of giving birth my son-in-law said she just started doing strange things he said she tried to say you know she got to lay down and give birth to this baby because she trying to stand up and he said no you can't stand up right now the baby is coming out right now you you can't stand up you got the you got to keep pushing and you know and a woman going through all kind of things in her body and want to tell everybody get out of here don't you know don't talk to me right now y'all sisters know what I'm talking about some of y'all don't game natural breath you know exactly what she was going through and look look you know I went through all that to give give birth to that child the devil you gonna let the devil you say did you give birth to this child did you have them pains that I had where you gonna lose my child and Let It Go foreign children you can't let the devil just have them like that applied a blood my God I claim her Satan you turn her loose I'm coming after her that now that's a powerful statement not Lord would you please go up no I'm coming after her because I have a right to come after this is my personal property I'm coming after her look at this I apply I apply my token the Holy Spirit oh holy spirit that lives within me catch my daughter oh holy spirit that lives in me catch my son catch my mama catch my daddy oh holy spirit that lives in me [Applause] he said catch my daughter there I'm going to her now with your anointing upon me he will do it amen I believe that God has always required blood I was looking a man at this uh scripture and yeah I think I'll bring it in now um John 1. and the next quote I'll go to is out of uh invisible Union of the bride of Christ but John 1 just a few verses here Bible says in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God see then we don't have three three different gods in the beginning was the word the word was with God amen and the Word was God amen the same word he says uh the same was in the beginning with God so what we got to understand is that when um when when God dwelt Alone just just just the self-existing one amen uh in order for him to be identified with the human race he had to come in a form that would allow people to be able to see him like we can't see the wind we can see the effects of it especially when it hurricane season we see we see the damage from wind but you can't see when you can feel it but you can't see it but God wants to be in a position where he can be seen identified by people that's God that's God right and um you know so so God had to take on a form in order to be able to be identified in that form that he took on was what we call Logos or light Pillar of Fire so when we talk about the word was with God Amen the word is actually the logos or the pillar Fire or the light hello somebody right the same pillar fire that we see on brother Brandon's pictures that was what God was talking about here in this scripture amen we can identify the presence of God right he says the beginning was what was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God so even when God God being a spirit takes on the form of light is still God and I like the way brother Quaker put it just God condescending God stepping down you know I I'll never forget that sermon brother Quaker preached but he you know he's telling us that you know you can't go and just take your cell phone and plug it into the FPL power plant where all the energy at you you walk out there in that energy field if you want to you will not come back so they have to step it down they take it from there and send it into transforms you can't go touch that Transformer it's too much power in there he says so they have to step it down from the transplant and run wires into your house right and then when they get into your house they got to break a box on that and they break it all down to get into a socket but it's all coming from one big great power source but God had to step it down so it would be effective for you even in the word God had to step down his Revelation so it'll be effective for you oh my God Amen it take time to catch up to God and there was a quote in the church Ace book that brother Randall say even the things that we do know it's infinite testimal that means it's this small everything you know compared to what God knows you know this much infinite decimal makes a Smith Fox feel really really small In God's Presence we should we should feel small now let me go on in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God now watch this all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made and him was life and the life was the light of men now let me just move to verse 14. glory to God because it it tells us that God's stepping things down now all right he says and the word that logos that light that was in the beginning the word was made flesh all right and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the Glorious of the of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth so what happened this logos it was still God it wasn't a different God it was the same God that was just changing his form so man could identify but that same body I mean that same logos took on a body of Flesh and that was the Flesh of the Lord Jesus Christ that that that that that logos became flesh in order to die for your flesh now there's a statement that brother Brandon makes it I just want to bring in here in The Invisible Union of the bride of Christ and I just I just like it I like the way he describes this he says what is sin is unbelief he says unbelief in what I need to underline these things unbelief in what unbelief in the word that's sin all these other things are attributes of sin smoking drinking uh partying and all this other those are attributes of sin but it's unbelief in the word that's what sin is Hallelujah be careful in that right I believe in in what the word unbelief in God which is the which is the word pure unadulterated oh Hallelujah leaving soon for the skies amen standing ready says think your garments wash by the water of the bleeding word look at what he say the word when I when I just got a I got a glimpse of this the word become blood I just want to kind of do you see it dripping when you carrying it do you do you feel it just dripping the blood coming out the word because this is Christ in written form you got to see the blood coming out of the word the blood the word became blood for you the believing bloody word young people y'all getting ready to go back to school yeah you're gonna have to hold your testimony you're going to be walking with the bleeding bloody words every step you take come on as you're walking through the school they can see there's a trail following you in college there's a trail following you you and you don't realize it you are carrying if you carry in the word y'all ain't with me yet you actually carrying the Bloods and you can't conceal this because when it's bleeding it's dripping the sun say it's tripping with blood is tripping with blood this Holy Ghost Gospel is tripping and you can't stop it from dripping and you you say well I ain't gonna carry my Bible to the to to to to to school I ain't gonna carry my Bible it's okay you come to this church the word is coming inside of you anyway and can I tell you something you dripping [Music] you dripping with blood the word become blood the word bled for you and you are washed in the bleeding word the word bleeding the life of God in the word and the Word was bled for you that you might be washed from the filth of these prostitutes and be cleaned and Sanctified by the watching of the water of the word and makes your mind and heart stayed on God and on his word all right I'm going back to something I read the last time watch this Christ is the mystery of God revealed oh I thank God for this I'm happy to be dripping with blood amen I'm making bloody Footprints everywhere I go bloody bloody amen Hallelujah notice making it known there's just so much here we could just keep on going notice the tree of Christ the body in the garden make it now making this mystery known to this broad tree watch Redeemed by Christ the second Adam you believe he was going back home to Eden with his Fallen wife redeem back home again that's Christ in the church today taking his wife back see the threefold mystery now of God I mean God manifested in Christ Christ manifesting the church all together bring back the original Adam and Eve again man and woman which are one made out of the same blood and Same Spirit and everything else look at this the church is the blood of Christ by the spirit because the life is in the blood now that's a powerful statement you I I earlier amen I said the ink when it's dropped into the Clorox brother random said the ink becomes the Clorox and when you have been washed in the blood of Jesus do you realize you become the blood don't let that be too heavy for you you're dripping with blood you have become the blood that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost that baptizes us into his body that recognizes only his body his flesh his word denomination won't ever touch that look at that that's why we had to be breathe back from denomination because denomination will never touch that right it's a revelation she knows it so that Eve know it but she failed but this one knows it and won't fall she's ordained Hallelujah she's ordained to not fall she won't fall man that's just a powerful statement there's a song that's saying he won't fail he won't fail Hallelujah [Music] he won't fail he won't fail he won't fail oh how he won't leave you yeah she won't fail she won't fail oh Hallelujah she won't fail I'm talking about you I don't care what you got she won't fail she won't fail [Music] cause he won't leave you so she can't fail you got to know who you are the church is the blood of Christ by the spirit because the life is in the blood that's the baptism the holy ghost that baptizes us into his body that recognizes only his body his flesh his word denomination won't ever touch that it's a revelation she knows it so did Eve know it but she failed but this one knows it and won't fall she's ordained hallelu is she ordained she's ordained not to fall she won't fail she's predestinated to it blesses the man who God will not impute sin you ministers know what I'm speaking of a couple dozen you sitting here see blessed is the man who God will not impute sin David now you know brother Brandon makes that statement the church is the blood of Christ by the spirit and as I was telling you the last time I was preaching oftentimes if you just study brother Branham in his ministry oftentimes you'll see that God will just kind of Quicken little thoughts to him and he'll jot those thoughts down and he'll just take that thought and then he'll just preach it right and and oftentimes now he made that statement but you now what scripture is he referring to when he say the church is the blood of Christ by the spirit he don't actually give you a scripture quotation to go to but the Holy Ghost allowed him to say that now let me just take a little further this is why the importance of having the fifo ministry right because a teacher would come and take that thought what the prophet just said get into the same channel or the pastor or the offenders will come again into that same thought and go back hey wait a minute that connects here so I got a little scripture because you know I'ma just be honest you know years ago the Lord had told me this has been over 20 years the Lord had told me it says uh and I was a faithful uh Sports Page reader of the newspaper he hasn't even got an accident one time I hit a lady in the back because I was reading the sports page hit I think she had a nice Mercedes I done ran right into oh Lord ma'am I'm so sorry I'm reading the sports page now people read their cell phones while they driving hello you got to be careful with this type of stuff the devil's just setting you up for something really really bad amen I I get caught myself sir I say Lord please forgive me God put that thing away put in your trunk if you have to put in your trunk amen you can't get to it and then I know you got your phone connected to it and you're trying to answer the phone no don't do none of that just let it go they can wait amen hello Hallelujah somebody amen I know that's good preaching anytime you get quiet like that you know you into something but um I was there and I was very you know faithful and reading my newspaper and then one day I was going down to pick up my newspaper outside when I reached down to pick it up uh I got it to go back inside I Heard a Voice say if you read your Bible's Faith because you read that newspaper you'll be much further up the road not stop I said now okay first thing I know the devil will not encourage me to read my Bible so I know that was not the voice of the devil but that was the voice of God speaking directly to me if you read your Bible as faithful as you read that newspaper can I say this if you read Joe Bob as faithful as you get on Instagram as papers you get on Facebook as Faith as you get on tick tock you'll be much further up the road so that day I I say well you know what I ain't even know what day of the week and what day of the month or what day of the year well I started right there and getting myself a Bible reading plan and I start reading the Bible through every year and I've been doing it since that time and let me tell you something since that time every time I go through the Bible I always find something that I ain't seen before but but by doing that I can look at a quote like this from the prophet and not get offended by what he just said I can see a connection in the Bible because I've read the Bible when he says that the church is the blood by the spirit let me just read the scripture out of Leviticus 14. the church is the blood of Christ by the spirit because the life is in the blood and I don't know if we get that because we thank God for the blood but do you realize when you get washed in the blood you become the blood you're bleeding you you've everywhere you go it's just the blood is coming out of you but this type of blood you don't need to pay a visit to the hospital this blood will bring Salvation to your loved ones it'll bring healing to the sick it'll bring Deliverance to the bound this the type of blood you can apply and and cause the devil to turn your children loose come on somebody here Leviticus 14 verse 1. and the Lord speaking to Moses saying this shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing he shall be brought unto the priests and the priest shall go forth out of the camp and the priest shall look and behold if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive and clean and Cedar Wood and Scarlet and hissing and the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an Earthen vessel over running water so one bird has to die in an Earthen vessel Christ had to not just be logos form but he had to take on a body of Flesh so that he can die as an Earthen vessel when Christ was coming Christ was coming to get a bride two birds connected one one one one bird has to die come on somebody but let's watch what happens here amen uh verse 5 says this and the priesthood command that one of the birds be killed in an Earthen vessel over Running World ask for the living bird he shall take it and the Cedarwood and the Scarlet that Scarlet should remind you of rehab because she put a Scarlet thread out her window that was her token come on somebody right amen it says a scarlet and and the hyssop and shall dip them so the living blood has to be dipped the dip dipped them and the living bird in the blood so the living bird has to be dipped in the blood of the Dead one come on somebody amen the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water and he shall sprinkle upon that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times and shall and shall pronounce him clean and shall let the living bird loose into the open field when you're going to school you're going into the open field when you go to work you're going into the open of field when you're going to business you're going into the open field but before you went into an open field guess what happened you got dip [Music] you got dipped in the blood of the Dead mate and now when you go into the open field you're just carrying the blood and every time you flap Them Wings the blood is [Music] dripping dripping dripping you become the blunt you're the blood of a dead mate you're carrying the blood marriage of the Lamb brother random makes this statement but did you ever notice what the real church is supposed to do in the Old Testament when they had the sacrifice to kill one bird and put the blood upon the other the dead mate and it flew across the Earth spreading the blood of the Dead mate when the church becomes the real bride of Jesus Christ she'll carry the blood of Jesus with her oh Lord Jesus let us get that God because you know there's many in church that many preaching sermons about the blood today they preaching Oh The Blood did this the blood the blood pulled me out of denomination the blood pulled me out of the world the blood that same blood that they preaching about it keep me out of it and the other thing I come to find out that I didn't find out in dominant denomination because I was washed I became is that too hard because I was washed now I'm carrying what I was washed in when the church becomes a real bride of Jesus Christ she'll carry the blood of Jesus Christ with her sprinkling it upon the ground calling holy holy holy unto the Lord her atmosphere her every bit of her will be of God her whole makeup will be of God you can't expect nothing else let me give you one

today you feeling all right you feel all right Get on Up come right on into the house and if you feel that sick we'll lay hands on here pray for you all right here we go uh Christ is the mystery of God reveal brother random makes a statement here and I'll end it right here he proves his resurrection life then as he vindicates himself she the bride is an independent from all others she's an independent woman a great Speck of bird that's different from all others you remember the Bible on that The Great Speckled Bird what we just read in Leviticus seven I mean Leviticus 14. it says uh the great speckle bird she had his name she had his life how did they speckle the bird they were both white and they were poor they pulled the head off of one bird and drained the blood out upon the other bird and the other bird was speckled with the red blood and it flopped its wings like this and the blood cried holy holy holy as it bathed the ground so Christ the dead mate put his blood his blood from his life into US carrying his blood crying holy holy holy unto the Lord it's an odd looking bird sure it is but she the bride is identified by him and she's independent from all others keep thee only unto her as long as you both live keep thee only to him the word no adultery not one sign of denomination see we've been brought back by the blood the breeding is to breeders out of denomination back to the super Church come on right he says he says um uh keep keep thee only to him the word no adultery not one sign of denomination not one sign of creed no adultery at all the word in him alone on Christ the solid rock I stand on other grounds is sinking Sands said Eddie uh says that's in Christ the word he was the word he is the word and the church becomes the word by him making her part of him he is the word the church becomes the word by him by what Christ did we become the word a man making a part of him and that's the word again personally identified by him his property alone amen she is Redeemed by him redeemed through him redeemed for him and for him alone that's right that's what the devil is howling about howling about that is being revealed the devil don't want you to know who you are but because I was washed in the blood I became blood let's pray father we're grateful for the word we're grateful that you sent us a prophet Lord to share your mind with us and oh God we would never know these things but as he reaches into the mind of God as we said Moses had the ability to reach into the mind of God and to write the entire book of Genesis he was not there he was not there but yet he wrote all the contents of it and he brought it to us we believe it and Lord you allowed your Prophet today to go back and just even Lord just give a little bit more clarity to what Moses saw and what Moses presented to us and we believe that as well God even helping us see that by the spirit we are the blood only through what Christ did just like we're able to take it right back to scripture in Leviticus 14 and and see the prophet even showing the types there we thank you Lord of what you've called us to and let us not be ashamed when we go back to work we go to school wherever we go let us not be ashamed Lord to carry this Blood it is a privilege Lord to carry the blood of Jesus so many God that would love to be in this place but you chose us give us strength Lord
