[9:03] your day-to-day life what can you do
[9:06] amen god just gonna ask the question
[9:08] sometimes what did you do
[9:10] in that time instead of crying out to me
[9:16] you don't want to rebuke like jesus said
[9:18] oh yeah of little faith
[9:21] how long will i suffer
[9:24] i believe
[9:26] i'm gonna give you a little testimony
[9:27] y'all can be seated for just a second
[9:32] earlier um
[9:36] you know we've been praying
[9:37] about moving this way
[9:40] we've been praying hard about it and we
[9:42] we believe god
[9:45] so we had a little trouble
[9:47] air conditioning it was right about the
[9:48] time we were getting ready to go on
[9:50] vacation and
[9:51] we had to get the children school
[9:53] clothes and all this and we were
[9:55] prepared had everything set aside for
[9:57] that
[9:58] then we had an issue with our air
[10:00] conditioner and it wasn't
[10:02] cool in the house so we call the
[10:04] air-conditioned man out and
[10:06] it's like mr johnson uh
[10:09] usually this air condition they last
[10:11] about 11 years
[10:13] said uh
[10:14] your house was built 15 years ago so
[10:18] this should have been gone a long time
[10:19] ago
[10:21] he said so what we're going to have to
[10:23] do because with the issue that we were
[10:25] having it was not only cool in the house
[10:28] but while we were away i don't know what
[10:30] state we're in shalom she called and
[10:32] said mama there's water on the floor
[10:35] so when the man came out he said that
[10:38] there's a pan that catches the water and
[10:40] it goes and drains to the outside of the
[10:42] house he said well that's an old pan
[10:44] it's on the inside
[10:46] so when we would wake up in the morning
[10:49] the entire floor was wet
[10:53] so uh i said okay we gonna have to deal
[10:55] with this
[10:57] so
[10:58] brother caleb duran came by
[11:01] and he got to preaching
[11:03] and he started testifying of
[11:06] of god what god was doing with him with
[11:08] the waves and everything with the plane
[11:11] and all of this
[11:13] so that sunday night when i fell asleep
[11:17] um
[11:18] well actually when i woke up
[11:21] this thought kept running in my mind oh
[11:23] yeah of little faith
[11:25] how long will i suffer you
[11:27] so i kept thinking on this i kept
[11:29] thinking on this and i started praying
[11:31] what are we going to do about this air
[11:32] conditioning this man said it's going to
[11:34] be a lot of money because the inside
[11:36] unit and the outside unit has to be
[11:38] fixed
[11:40] so
[11:41] that thought kept hitting me i got up
[11:42] there my devotion i prayed
[11:44] and when i finished praying
[11:46] it hit me and it was just strong oh you
[11:48] have little faith
[11:50] so i went to that air-conditioned
[11:51] thermostat and i said you're gonna run
[11:54] like you did before
[11:57] you gonna run like when
[11:59] you were first put in here
[12:04] so the next morning i got up see if it
[12:07] came back down to 74 once he hit 74 and
[12:09] shuts off
[12:12] 75 it was struggling i said you're gonna
[12:15] obey
[12:16] a few days went by
[12:19] it continued to do that
[12:21] so
[12:22] one night it was on my heart heavy lord
[12:25] do you want us
[12:27] why why is it such a block for us to
[12:29] move to west palm beach
[12:32] if you want us to move to west palm
[12:33] beach i want to lay a fleece before you
[12:36] i'm gonna put a towel in where this
[12:38] where this thing is completely soaked
[12:41] i want it completely dry and the floor
[12:43] to be completely dry if you want us to
[12:45] stay here in palm bay
[12:48] you make the floor wet and make that
[12:49] tower completely wet
[12:52] so the next morning i got up
[12:55] floors dry so i went in where the towel
[12:57] was
[12:58] and the towel was a little damp on the
[13:00] bottom
[13:01] but we never had a problem with the leak
[13:03] since and the air conditioner has been
[13:04] running so i said lord
[13:08] lord
[13:09] that's
[13:10] i put a fleece down but i don't have the
[13:12] answer
[13:14] i said the towel needed to be completely
[13:16] dry but it's damp
[13:20] so i kept thinking on that
[13:22] and i kept thinking on it i thought kept
[13:23] coming it's not time
[13:26] but the air conditioning is running like
[13:28] i don't know why
[13:35] so that that was actually how i ended up
[13:37] getting sick it wasn't
[13:39] fighting corona nothing i got and i cut
[13:41] the grass i came in sweating and
[13:43] everything
[13:44] and it just really hit me that air was
[13:46] so cold
[13:50] [Applause]
[13:53] amen
[13:55] but greater is he that's within us
[13:58] than he that's in the world
[14:00] when brother caleb came he actually
[14:02] challenged my faith
[14:04] that was a challenge because i sat there
[14:06] i'm like brother
[14:08] you saying some things yeah
[14:11] but i believe it
[14:12] i believe you did that brother and i
[14:14] believe god can do that
[14:16] so when i was fighting with that even in
[14:18] my sleep i'm still wrestling with that
[14:21] then oh ye of little faith yeah how long
[14:24] will i suffer you
[14:26] so you don't want that rebuke you want
[14:28] to get up and do what god tell you to do
[14:30] amen you can stand to your feet god
[14:32] bless you

[38:41] whole heart in the assembly
[38:44] of the upright and in the congregation
[38:48] the works of the lord are great
[38:50] sought out of all them that have
[38:52] pleasure therein
[38:54] his work is honorable and and gracious
[38:57] and
[38:58] glorious in his righteousness and do it
[39:01] forever
[39:02] he has made his wonderful works to be
[39:05] remembered
[39:07] the lord is gracious and full of
[39:09] compassion
[39:10] he has given meaning to them that fear
[39:13] him he will ever be
[39:16] mindful of his covenant
[39:18] he has showed his people the power of
[39:21] his works
[39:22] that he may give them the heritage of
[39:25] the heathen
[39:27] the works
[39:29] of his hands are verity and judgment
[39:33] all his commandments are sure
[39:35] they stand fast forever
[39:38] and ever
[39:39] and are done in truth and upright
[39:41] rightness he sent redemption unto his
[39:44] people
[39:46] he has commanded his covenant forever

[39:53] is the beginning of wisdom a good
[39:56] understanding have all they that do his
[39:59] commandments
[40:01] his praises is endures forever
[40:04] now let's
[40:06] before you be seated let's move down to
[40:08] psalms 112 because they
[40:10] kind of go together i'm probably not
[40:13] going to get
[40:14] done but uh we'll we'll get started and
[40:16] maybe see how the lord leads us the next
[40:19] time we have the opportunity to minister
[40:21] but
[40:22] he says praise ye the lord
[40:25] blessed is a man that feareth the lord
[40:27] that delight is greatly in his
[40:29] commandments his seed shall be mighty
[40:32] upon the earth
[40:33] the generation of the
[40:36] upright shall be blessed
[40:38] i'll just stop right there may the lord
[40:40] add a blessing to the reading of his
[40:41] word this morning will be seated
[40:44] um we we want to use as a title this
[40:47] morning the generation of the upright
[40:50] it's been a this has been a scripture
[40:52] that i was i've kind of just
[40:55] uh been toiling over for some months now
[40:58] i was talking to brother jack about it
[41:00] he was like doc preach it he always
[41:02] encouraged me like that man gone and but
[41:04] uh i just had had the inspiration to
[41:07] really uh uh
[41:10] just uh approach it and i think any
[41:12] minister knows that you know god can
[41:15] give you something but everything's got
[41:16] to be at the right time
[41:18] you know brother solomon was saying that
[41:20] god told him it ain't the right time you
[41:23] know one thing i'm i'm convinced about
[41:25] when when it's the right time things
[41:26] have just happened
[41:28] organically you don't have to force it
[41:31] you don't have to you don't have to do
[41:33] anything
[41:34] amen uh uh uh it'll it'll just
[41:38] everything will just work out all the
[41:40] dominoes are just fall in your favor
[41:44] amen i believe that it's things that you
[41:47] know that we i still have before the
[41:49] lord but i i realized i can't make
[41:52] anything happen
[41:55] you know one of the things you you begin
[41:58] to learn as a christian is to just uh
[42:01] get out get out the way and let the holy
[42:04] ghost do the winning
[42:06] uh that's a song i'm not sure if sister
[42:08] burns wrote that or sister lewis just
[42:11] sister louis just get yourself out of
[42:13] the way
[42:14] that's our biggest problem we we we
[42:16] think we bigger than god and we can god
[42:19] don't need our little bitty help
[42:21] anytime we get in the way we just mess
[42:24] stuff up
[42:26] but um um this morning i want to uh look
[42:30] at this scripture
[42:31] um i i want to maybe just y'all give me
[42:34] a few minutes this morning and i kind of
[42:36] have to
[42:37] approach things a certain way
[42:40] and and kind of build because that's i'm
[42:42] built different than brother jack and
[42:44] brother kwaku he be different than me
[42:47] and and all the races that brother
[42:49] jerry's a little different than me i
[42:50] just
[42:51] you know as as i'm looking at scripture
[42:53] and i'm writing and scribbling down
[42:55] little things that god that god given me
[42:58] uh as i'm as i'm studying and looking at
[43:01] the scripture and uh i over just over
[43:04] the years i i learned to approach
[43:07] scripture and study in just a certain
[43:09] way and and uh
[43:12] i'm i'm always looking for patterns
[43:16] right because like the scriptures say
[43:18] i'm god and i don't change
[43:20] uh so so in studying i'm all the time
[43:24] i'm looking for patterns i'm i'm looking
[43:26] for for certain things in the scripture
[43:30] amen to identify myself with because i
[43:33] want to find myself in the scripture
[43:36] right amen and and as as i'm looking at
[43:39] the things of god i want to make sure
[43:42] amen certain things are identified
[43:46] certain certain things are are there
[43:49] right it ain't you know so much just
[43:51] coming to church but you know and
[43:53] studying the bible that's good but it's
[43:56] it's things that uh we we want to
[43:59] know and grow and and begin to uh uh
[44:03] understand and it's like knowing who we
[44:06] are
[44:08] that that's a big thing sometimes we
[44:09] don't think about it like that but just
[44:12] knowing who we are in the natural and
[44:14] the spiritual we struggle when we don't
[44:18] right we we struggle in the natural when
[44:22] we don't know who we are we struggle in
[44:23] the spiritual when we don't know who we
[44:25] are
[44:26] is that right amen but but once we begin
[44:29] to
[44:30] understand and it's just all growth it's
[44:32] all maturity uh that that's the thing
[44:36] that begins to settle us
[44:38] bring us to a place where we could take
[44:40] a deep breath
[44:41] and say it's gonna be all right
[44:44] is it right amen and and then also
[44:47] knowing knowing what we are part of
[44:52] right you because you know we're living
[44:54] in an age now where where young men and
[44:56] young women too they they getting gangs
[44:59] and different things it's because they
[45:01] don't know you know their family
[45:04] pedigree
[45:05] and and and who they are and and what
[45:08] they you know
[45:10] all these things entail right and even a
[45:13] lot of times they get into something
[45:14] they don't really know what they're part
[45:16] of
[45:18] we we go we go and we join we join
[45:21] sororities and we we get involved in a
[45:23] whole lot of stuff
[45:25] and and really don't know what we're
[45:27] part of
[45:28] we we only know about about you know
[45:31] what they tell us but at the core a lot
[45:34] of these things are demonic
[45:37] satanic satanic influences
[45:41] as you as you you you get to the top of
[45:44] the food chain you start realizing but
[45:46] it ain't what i thought it was
[45:49] like
[45:51] so so if if i'm a part of something if
[45:54] i'm if i'm a part of you know uh uh uh a
[45:57] gathering an assembly i want to know you
[46:01] know what i'm a part of
[46:03] right i want i want to know what i'm
[46:06] saying amen too
[46:08] glory to god well i'm in the well if i'm
[46:11] in the message i want to know why i'm in
[46:13] the message and why this thing is so
[46:16] important to me
[46:18] and and why what's the benefit package
[46:22] right come on
[46:24] i'm starting to feel good
[46:27] why am i part of this
[46:29] why am i why do i want to be identified
[46:32] with this how is this thing going to
[46:34] work for me
[46:36] why are they why are they saying
[46:38] this that and the other
[46:40] why are they believing in a prophet why
[46:43] are they believing this and why they
[46:44] saying it's a message church and all
[46:46] those different types of things and how
[46:49] how can i how can i make this stuff a
[46:52] man run through the scripture that
[46:55] they're talking about
[46:58] well praise god i'm starting to feel him
[47:01] yeah right don't don't just come in just
[47:04] to sit here what'd you say well i'm at
[47:06] the church and brother john yeah brother
[47:08] jack's a great man i thank god for
[47:11] brother jack
[47:12] you know i often i often sit back and i
[47:15] think about him
[47:16] and i say you know but i enjoy him
[47:18] because he's got such a good handle on
[47:20] things
[47:21] just a real good perspective on things
[47:24] but that's just not good enough
[47:26] for me as an individual
[47:28] i want to know what i'm a part of
[47:32] and and i want to see this thing make
[47:34] sense
[47:35] and the things and the things that the
[47:38] prophet of god ministered on i want to
[47:40] see it in the scripture
[47:42] right i want to see a dovetail through
[47:44] the scripture and i want to i want to
[47:47] make sure it makes sense according to
[47:49] the scripture
[47:51] right come on not my opinions not my
[47:53] feelings not my emotions none of that
[47:55] right but but i want to see myself amen
[47:59] in the scriptures i want to be able to
[48:01] see amen what i am believing based upon
[48:04] the word of god i'm still going
[48:06] somewhere i'm just kind of you know
[48:09] i got a few notes that i scribbled right
[48:12] amen
[48:13] and and this is important for we got
[48:16] young young young people growing up in
[48:18] the church just don't grow up in the
[48:20] church
[48:21] [Music]
[48:23] just don't sit on a pool
[48:25] know why you're here well my mama
[48:27] brought me here
[48:30] my dad yeah i took my children to church
[48:32] too
[48:33] i took them the meetings i took them all
[48:35] over the place that wasn't good enough
[48:39] right because at the end of the day
[48:42] i'm still believing god for him i'll
[48:43] leave that alone
[48:45] right
[48:46] but but that but that's not a good
[48:48] enough singing is not good enough all
[48:50] these things are rolling on the floor
[48:52] and crying that's all these things ain't
[48:54] good enough you got to know by
[48:56] understanding what you're a part of and
[48:59] why
[49:00] because that's you that's becomes your
[49:02] anchor
[49:04] when when when the enemy comes in like a
[49:06] flood that raises the standard up for
[49:09] you
[49:10] that solidifies everything for you
[49:13] i'm there because of this i'm there
[49:15] because of this this scripture says this
[49:18] this scripture over here ties with this
[49:20] scripture titled description times with
[49:23] this scripture times with that statement
[49:25] titled this scripture and that's why
[49:29] i'm here
[49:31] right glory to god not a feeling not
[49:33] emotion not gifts and all of that no
[49:36] because i see myself in the scripture
[49:40] i see the ministry i see the pastorial
[49:43] ministry i see the deacon ministry i see
[49:46] every ministry based upon the scripture
[49:52] see
[49:53] amen
[49:55] glory to god
[49:56] what we are part of what's promising
[50:00] right
[50:01] and what's important in the scripture to
[50:03] god
[50:06] right we got to understand you know
[50:09] because because you know we we get
[50:11] especially in the the generation that
[50:13] we're in you know we we go on folk on a
[50:16] lot of feelings and and all of that and
[50:18] that stuff just bothers me sometimes
[50:21] right it's not about you know uh our
[50:25] feelings and i think and i thought yo
[50:29] how could we place our thoughts into
[50:31] this thing
[50:32] that's where we where we run into
[50:34] problems we went into
[50:36] trouble and we start our struggle well i
[50:38] thought no find the word on the thing
[50:42] base your feelings on the word base your
[50:45] decisions on the word
[50:47] right glory to god because your feelings
[50:49] your emotions and all these things can
[50:51] deceive you is that right then that was
[50:54] still like a roaring lion seeking who he
[50:56] may devour i ain't even got to the
[50:58] scripture yet but i'm coming
[51:01] right glory to god amen no no no
[51:05] because everything ain't pleasing to god
[51:08] we we live in an age of inclusions and
[51:11] we got all kind of filth we got all kind
[51:13] of nonsense and all of that kind of
[51:16] stuff and you know and and the church
[51:18] this i get so sick and tired of that
[51:21] nonsense
[51:23] it's like this either you're going to be
[51:24] a part of it you're going to believe it
[51:26] or you're not
[51:29] right see this this word is for the
[51:32] redeemed it's for the believer
[51:36] right and it might just not have no no
[51:38] place for our opinions and our feelings
[51:41] and things of that nature
[51:43] right glory to god amen see
[51:46] that those are the things that you know
[51:49] i look i'm looking at even when i
[51:51] approach the gospel i don't care about
[51:54] people feeling i don't care about what
[51:55] you think about me and none of that
[51:58] is is that right amen i just want to
[52:00] know who i am what's going to be
[52:02] pleasing in the guard and if if it's
[52:04] pleasing to god i'm gonna be all right
[52:10] all right now let's let's kind of
[52:12] dig some more y'all all right this
[52:14] morning

[52:21] he gives me i just jot these little
[52:23] things down and just tell them to help
[52:25] me say it

[52:29] you and looking hard and trying to stare
[52:31] you down well i ain't even intimidated
[52:33] by that
[52:36] sometimes people must think that you
[52:38] know they ain't intimidating
[52:41] i've dealt with tougher people than
[52:42] y'all
[52:46] so i'm not intimidated by stairs

[52:51] just kind of get on board and ride with
[52:53] me for a few minutes i'm gonna be out of

[56:24] right remember what's what's important

[56:39] praise mixed with a lot of
[56:41] stuff
[56:44] come on now we going somewhere
[56:46] you can't praise god like that god is

[57:16] through a thinking man's filter
[57:19] right
[57:20] thank god we got a filter
[57:23] thank god we we had a man that that that
[57:26] was able by a gift by scriptural calling
[57:30] was able to go up and get the mind of
[57:32] god and bring it back down and say this
[57:35] what pleases god
[57:38] right this this what pleases god that
[57:41] other stuff don't please god
[57:45] right
[57:46] and and and you know and we all humans
[57:49] we all make mistakes we all still moving
[57:51] up i got my little struggles too
[57:55] but but i don't want i don't want my
[57:57] struggles
[57:58] to be
[58:00] uh the thing that you know i always look
[58:02] to where god you know y'all gotta say i
[58:04] know but but that's transforming power
[58:07] in the word of god
[58:09] god
[58:10] at some point god like you got to get
[58:12] there though bro
[58:14] you got to get that sus well you know
[58:16] now your family this you could you proud
[58:18] of another family
[58:20] how many how many got the holy ghost
[58:22] don't raise your hand well you don't
[58:24] done it anyway
[58:27] see
[58:28] right then we're part of a a whole
[58:30] nother family
[58:32] you know i'm i'm part of a smiley family
[58:35] and uh
[58:37] that kind of rough folk
[58:40] right
[58:41] that that's that's the old man though
[58:44] i realized amen i've been married to the
[58:47] revealed word
[58:49] i'm from another kingdom
[58:52] and and and i realized man that there's
[58:55] a fight the smiley versus the baptism by
[58:58] the holy ghost the nation the character
[59:00] of god i'm and i'm fighting i'm in a
[59:02] real war i don't know about y'all
[59:05] because that thing we want to try to
[59:07] take over
[59:08] and i'll be saying no i can't let you
[59:10] take over i can't let you i can't let
[59:13] you drive the car
[59:15] because you ain't got no seats
[59:18] i'm better off as long as the holy ghost
[59:21] is in control
[59:22] of the vehicle oh glory to god
[59:26] make me feel like being in the old
[59:28] church with wooden flows
[59:31] huh hey man you don't want smiley to
[59:33] take over
[59:35] my grandma used to tell you boy i will
[59:37] cut you quicker than i could spit
[59:40] you don't want that to take over
[59:43] cut you quick as i could spit that mean
[59:46] before she could uh papa
[59:51] y'all know what i'm talking about
[59:53] you look back you know brother talked
[59:55] about his family his island was so bad
[59:58] till people would see him coming
[1:00:01] because he was a branham they crossed
[1:00:03] the street that's a bad family
[1:00:05] y'all know what i'm talking about
[1:00:07] you know and here in west palm beach
[1:00:08] they used to be a family they still
[1:00:11] around somewhere to parcel man those
[1:00:13] people were scary
[1:00:16] that's no joke dumb people scary y'all
[1:00:19] some of y'all know what i'm talking
[1:00:20] about
[1:00:23] oh glory to god
[1:00:24] but but okay so
[1:00:27] he says i will praise the lord with my
[1:00:29] whole heart
[1:00:31] now in the assembly of the upright
[1:00:35] right then that word assembly is it
[1:00:38] means a small group you know a small
[1:00:40] gathering something that's intimate or
[1:00:43] something of that nature
[1:00:45] but uh i want to dwell on the upright
[1:00:50] because i thought it's being a part of
[1:00:52] the generation of the upright
[1:00:56] right because you know folk want to be a
[1:00:58] part of
[1:00:59] this generation we're the generation of
[1:01:01] this and we're the generation of that uh
[1:01:04] okay you can have that
[1:01:06] i guess i was a baby boomer or something
[1:01:08] one of them but but
[1:01:10] i want to be identified with that
[1:01:13] i i want to know because see this is my
[1:01:15] identification
[1:01:18] right this is the thing that we we hold
[1:01:20] on to
[1:01:22] and you you want to see things as they
[1:01:26] move through the scripture
[1:01:29] right
[1:01:30] and and so
[1:01:31] um
[1:01:34] when we think about upright the
[1:01:36] definition is of a person or
[1:01:40] are their behaviors strictly honorable
[1:01:43] or honest
[1:01:45] right and and also i was just kind of
[1:01:49] you know
[1:01:50] meditating and so we i started thinking
[1:01:53] about something
[1:01:55] you know genesis is the seed chapter of
[1:01:57] the bible
[1:01:59] and and every seed that's been sown was
[1:02:02] sown in genesis that's the prophet he
[1:02:04] makes that statement right
[1:02:07] amen and and so
[1:02:10] you can you can find a man uh patterns
[1:02:15] and i and i like to do this i always
[1:02:17] kind of go back and just kind of move it
[1:02:20] forward
[1:02:21] because if he's god
[1:02:24] he cannot change
[1:02:26] he can't stop something here and get
[1:02:28] over here and it's something different
[1:02:31] he can't start in the old testament
[1:02:34] with with a certain uh uh a character or
[1:02:38] a certain makeup
[1:02:40] and then get over to the new testament
[1:02:42] and it's something different
[1:02:45] see that's how we think but that's not
[1:02:47] the truth
[1:02:49] right
[1:02:50] glory to god see i i was
[1:02:53] maybe uh
[1:02:55] somebody they can pull this up for me
[1:02:57] i'll give me a second
[1:02:59] uh
[1:03:00] it's in the 70 weeks of daniel
[1:03:03] uh uh verse 66. here brother branham
[1:03:07] he's he's talking about he's talking
[1:03:09] about um
[1:03:11] uh time in the scriptures and different
[1:03:14] things like that and how they used to
[1:03:16] tell time by the stars and all that
[1:03:19] uh but i want to bring out a point if
[1:03:22] y'all got it
[1:03:24] it's dangerous 70 weeks
[1:03:26] it's 1961.
[1:03:29] we started their product catch up he
[1:03:30] says now this i can only say
[1:03:33] as myself speaking i believe that back
[1:03:36] before
[1:03:37] the uh uh and brother branham let's keep
[1:03:40] in mind something brother branham taught
[1:03:42] in
[1:03:43] shadows and types
[1:03:45] right
[1:03:46] and and
[1:03:48] we we we are tight with the earth
[1:03:51] right because we we was informed
[1:03:54] void and all of that and darkness cover
[1:03:57] the face of the deep you go back to
[1:03:59] spoken word the original see some of
[1:04:01] those things and you study how you catch
[1:04:02] it
[1:04:03] all right but i just want to i want to
[1:04:05] bring out just just one point from here
[1:04:08] it says and i believe that back before
[1:04:10] the anteluvian destruction
[1:04:14] back in the days back in the days of job
[1:04:16] and so forth that they kept the time by
[1:04:19] the stars
[1:04:20] and he says and when we understand
[1:04:23] or are back before that time watch this
[1:04:26] now
[1:04:27] because because i believe that we're
[1:04:29] typed here
[1:04:30] he says uh uh uh uh
[1:04:35] back uh boy back before
[1:04:38] that time that the world stood upright
[1:04:42] right the world stood up right i believe
[1:04:46] the first the first
[1:04:48] uh uh uh family the first church stood
[1:04:52] up right
[1:04:55] ain't nothing deep y'all don't have to
[1:04:57] worry about oh my god now it's just
[1:04:58] something real simple just something
[1:05:00] that that i was looking at and i thought
[1:05:02] my that's all right
[1:05:04] amen
[1:05:05] it stood it stood upright and i'm saying
[1:05:08] this because the principles of god don't
[1:05:11] change
[1:05:13] right he said the world stood upright
[1:05:16] adam's even the serpent stood upright
[1:05:20] come on
[1:05:22] the serpent stood upright
[1:05:26] it was the judgment that put him on his
[1:05:30] belly but he amen
[1:05:32] he could he was so close to man he
[1:05:35] didn't have a soul
[1:05:37] he had a place for a soul but he didn't
[1:05:39] have a soul
[1:05:41] he could communicate he could reason he
[1:05:44] could do all he could talk
[1:05:46] come on now
[1:05:48] well that's close
[1:05:52] thank god for revelation
[1:05:55] right
[1:05:56] but he says that the world stood upright
[1:05:59] and then watch this in the sin of man
[1:06:03] right
[1:06:04] the overthrow of the world
[1:06:07] and it tilted
[1:06:10] right
[1:06:11] and it's not in its its right position
[1:06:16] right
[1:06:17] because of sin
[1:06:20] we weren't in our right position either
[1:06:22] because of the way we came thank god for
[1:06:25] being redeemed
[1:06:28] come on the blood the blood the blood
[1:06:30] the blood the blood
[1:06:32] come on
[1:06:34] come on amen it stood us up right
[1:06:39] right because sin sin has you tilted see
[1:06:42] the overthrow of the world and it tilts
[1:06:44] tilted
[1:06:46] and the floods came therefore we have
[1:06:48] the great ice glaciers and so forth and
[1:06:51] all the tops and and of the bottoms it's
[1:06:54] full of ice we know that and the earth
[1:06:57] does not set straight up it soaked it
[1:07:01] set
[1:07:02] tilted
[1:07:04] that shook it from
[1:07:06] out from where the moon and the stars
[1:07:08] were they was looking at and it
[1:07:10] misplaced then he says you could not
[1:07:13] keep time by it anymore because it's
[1:07:16] it's setting lopsided
[1:07:18] set and tilted back
[1:07:20] therefore it would not hit the stars at
[1:07:23] the same time because it's out of cater
[1:07:25] to them stars you understand i believe
[1:07:27] that's what it is
[1:07:30] it's a whole lot of tilted folk
[1:07:34] right
[1:07:36] but you can be tilted i want to be
[1:07:39] upright
[1:07:41] because that's the thought of god
[1:07:44] right
[1:07:45] amen the the first family
[1:07:48] right the first
[1:07:50] earth in the earth
[1:07:52] because this is the earth
[1:07:54] y'all ought to preach with me
[1:07:56] come on
[1:07:57] this is the earth
[1:08:00] everything in the mind of god stood
[1:08:02] upright
[1:08:04] that's why redemption has been so
[1:08:06] important
[1:08:07] understand that i am redeemed
[1:08:11] what redemption does when we all
[1:08:13] lopsided and and all of that it pulls us
[1:08:17] straight
[1:08:20] it pulls us straight up because because
[1:08:22] that that that just meets in in the mind
[1:08:26] of god
[1:08:27] the intentions of god
[1:08:30] thank god god knew what would take place
[1:08:33] but thank god god is bigger
[1:08:36] he's bigger
[1:08:38] tasha cobb sang a song that talks about
[1:08:40] being bigger
[1:08:42] he's bigger
[1:08:44] he's big enough no matter no matter how
[1:08:47] tilted we are
[1:08:49] how we leaning how lopsided we are he
[1:08:52] can still pull us up right
[1:08:56] come on
[1:08:57] i'm a living witness
[1:09:01] right i'm a living witness
[1:09:03] right
[1:09:04] oh glory to god
[1:09:06] see
[1:09:07] brother browner makes another statement
[1:09:09] he's just touching on this uh
[1:09:12] scripture here
[1:09:14] uh
[1:09:17] he says
[1:09:19] the lord uh the lord is gracious and
[1:09:22] full of compassion he says
[1:09:24] first in the mind of the psalmist was
[1:09:26] god's
[1:09:27] uh great
[1:09:29] oh no i think i jumped ahead of myself i
[1:09:32] ain't gonna read that but let's get back
[1:09:33] on the scripture y'all still with me
[1:09:36] right
[1:09:36] just being being
[1:09:38] being
[1:09:39] in the generation that's that's up right
[1:09:43] right
[1:09:44] amen
[1:09:45] okay so he says i i will praise the lord
[1:09:48] with my whole heart in the assembly of
[1:09:50] the upright
[1:09:51] and in the congregation now now now
[1:09:54] this next verse is to me is is really
[1:09:57] powerful
[1:09:59] because because a lot of times you know
[1:10:02] i don't i don't think that
[1:10:04] um we we really sit back and really
[1:10:08] ponder how great the work of god is
[1:10:11] has been and is is that right we we we
[1:10:15] just kind of go through day to day
[1:10:18] and and and not realize man
[1:10:21] how important god is
[1:10:24] right
[1:10:25] how important it is being a part of god
[1:10:28] being married to god is
[1:10:30] right we
[1:10:32] i'm guilty
[1:10:33] we take we take christianity
[1:10:37] right for granted a lot of times
[1:10:40] come on
[1:10:41] i'm a living witness i'm gonna put
[1:10:43] myself in there sometimes i take for
[1:10:46] granted
[1:10:47] the great work of god
[1:10:51] and what this great work
[1:10:54] is
[1:10:56] and what god has been doing in me
[1:10:58] through me and for me
[1:11:01] because i'm gonna tell you something
[1:11:02] mama sap saying the song never would
[1:11:04] have made it i wouldn't be here today if
[1:11:08] it wasn't for the great work of god
[1:11:13] i'm telling you
[1:11:14] i wouldn't i wouldn't be here today
[1:11:18] right
[1:11:19] but god
[1:11:22] do it's the work of god it's not the
[1:11:25] work of smiling
[1:11:28] it's the work of god
[1:11:30] because you know we all go through so
[1:11:32] much in the flesh and in our mind you
[1:11:34] know like cynthia says yeah that stuff
[1:11:35] going on in mind we all she ain't by
[1:11:37] herself
[1:11:39] come on
[1:11:41] we like oh yes nelly praise the lord she
[1:11:44] had that we all got we all got our
[1:11:46] struggles
[1:11:47] we brother brother adam lets us know
[1:11:49] that
[1:11:50] even even the apostle paul when he was
[1:11:53] converted he said boy when i would do
[1:11:55] good evil is always presence
[1:11:58] the things that i i said i wasn't gonna
[1:12:00] do
[1:12:02] lord have mercy even even the prophet of
[1:12:05] god he makes his name he say god
[1:12:08] directly tells some things to do
[1:12:12] and he do the opposite
[1:12:13] wow
[1:12:15] that's something that no having this
[1:12:17] kind of relationship that he had with
[1:12:19] god
[1:12:21] where angel would come and you still
[1:12:23] would do something different i remember
[1:12:25] the time that the problem of god tells
[1:12:26] the story about being over in africa and
[1:12:28] and he had a direct word from god
[1:12:32] don't follow these guys over here
[1:12:35] go this way
[1:12:38] don't go that way go this direction
[1:12:42] he let him see that's why i'll let
[1:12:44] people influence me
[1:12:45] i love you but i ain't gonna let you
[1:12:47] lead me
[1:12:48] come on all feelings and emotions you
[1:12:52] and your feelings and emotion go the way
[1:12:53] you want to go but i'm gonna go the way
[1:12:55] that god has lead me by the word
[1:12:57] i'm going the way that i can see by the
[1:12:59] word
[1:13:00] come on all the feeling and all that you
[1:13:02] know i ain't mad at you you know
[1:13:06] nothing like that i ain't gonna fight
[1:13:07] with you if you if you're saying that i
[1:13:10] feel like to do this i feel let it go
[1:13:12] this way i feel let it go that by all
[1:13:14] means don't let me stop you
[1:13:19] wear your mask
[1:13:20] and don't let nobody tell you nothing
[1:13:22] different
[1:13:24] wear your mask
[1:13:26] i'm not right with it i don't got used
[1:13:28] to it
[1:13:29] i remember when back when it first
[1:13:31] started out like
[1:13:33] [Music]
[1:13:36] i had to get it took some getting
[1:13:38] because you know you weren't used to it
[1:13:39] i've been saved for 30 something years

[1:13:43] church and seeing people's eyes covered
[1:13:45] up looking like ninjas and all that kind
[1:13:47] of stuff

[1:14:01] oblique in a sup like that
[1:14:03] you know
[1:14:05] since a human god got a sense of humor
[1:14:10] amen but it says the works of the lord
[1:14:12] are great

[1:14:16] of all them that have pleasure therein
[1:14:20] right
[1:14:22] and see
[1:14:23] i'm gonna stop here for a second i got a
[1:14:25] quote somewhere in here with the prophet
[1:14:26] of god talking about god right the same
[1:14:29] scripture
[1:14:31] god's god's got to be
[1:14:35] upright also
[1:14:38] if if
[1:14:39] if
[1:14:40] this is a requirement
[1:14:42] right
[1:14:44] god can't be anything less than what
[1:14:46] he's requiring of us
[1:14:48] if we can't trust him
[1:14:50] if we can't have confidence in it if if
[1:14:53] he's partial and all of that but we got
[1:14:56] problems we might
[1:14:59] burn this like they burned the flag
[1:15:01] come on
[1:15:03] come on
[1:15:04] this is the only thing that i can really
[1:15:06] clearly have confidence in
[1:15:10] right
[1:15:11] people try men smart men try to bring
[1:15:14] uh color and and
[1:15:17] this and that into it this bible ain't
[1:15:20] got no where man wrote it it's like come
[1:15:23] on did you really read the scripture it
[1:15:24] said men wrote as they were inspired of
[1:15:27] the holy ghost

[1:15:31] their own abraham wouldn't have talked
[1:15:33] about lying
[1:15:38] it's stuff in here that y'all know what
[1:15:40] i'm talking about
[1:15:41] y'all you know we we do things we ain't
[1:15:43] gonna tell nobody and write that in the
[1:15:45] book

[1:16:08] his wife to lie
[1:16:10] right

[1:16:14] the scene

[1:16:18] upright
[1:16:20] the king was upright
[1:16:22] come on he says you know what i know the
[1:16:25] integrity of your heart
[1:16:27] and beca but god's good though

[1:34:53] don't even take this word for granted i
[1:34:56] don't take where i am for granted that's
[1:34:58] why i ain't never moving

[1:35:54] than the struggle i'd rather struggle
[1:35:56] right here where i am
[1:35:58] then then to venture out and try
[1:36:00] something else that i ain't sure that's
[1:36:02] gonna work this has worked for me
[1:36:08] this
[1:36:09] message i'm gonna just say it just like
[1:36:11] this
[1:36:12] this message
[1:36:14] this revealing has worked for me
[1:36:19] thus far
[1:36:22] i ain't going nowhere church
[1:36:25] why because
[1:36:27] you know and i don't have no bible
[1:36:29] training you know sometimes you go and
[1:36:31] you preach and ministers actually well
[1:36:33] what school you went to doc

[1:36:41] doc
[1:36:42] that doc what school you went to boy
[1:36:46] neology
[1:36:50] i i took the book
[1:36:52] i took those little books out of the
[1:36:54] hand at the seventh angel and i started
[1:36:56] eating them
[1:36:58] it was bitter
[1:37:00] it was better
[1:37:02] i remember the first time man i i
[1:37:04] listened to marriage and divorce i had
[1:37:06] to cut it off several times
[1:37:10] i it was bitter
[1:37:12] it it was a bitter pill of sweet to
[1:37:14] swallow
[1:37:15] it were rough man it was rough i was
[1:37:17] like man i could a man say something
[1:37:20] like that
[1:37:23] but you had to catch it in between the
[1:37:26] line
[1:37:28] it was a godly sister versus
[1:37:31] ungodly
[1:37:33] see and it's it's the it's the righteous
[1:37:36] the upright verses to tilt it
[1:37:43] come on now
[1:37:45] it's the it's the upright seat the
[1:37:47] upright versus the wicket
[1:37:50] see this this is a wicked evil and
[1:37:53] adulterous generation
[1:37:56] see here's your identification oh you're
[1:37:59] part of the generation of the upright
