[2:46] this journey to go half way we're gonna
[2:49] start the journey just to go to go to
[2:52] the river and stop a man we're going all
[2:54] the way over amen and to attain possess
[2:58] all of the Hittites in the Levites and
[3:01] all of the things that God has for say
[3:04] man amen let us grab our Bibles we're
[3:10] gonna go straight to the word won't be
[3:12] before you too long
[3:17] spoke to the pastor he sends his
[3:21] greetings sums your prayers he's gonna
[3:24] be preaching tonight and I believe he
[3:28] said tomorrow night it's going around a
[3:31] half hour week on this and then they'll
[3:33] be back on Friday so just keep them in
[3:36] your prayers a man as he's doing the
[3:39] work of the Lord up there in Ohio
[3:44] Michigan in that region of the area a
[3:47] man how many love the Lord
[3:50] a man we're gonna just continue reading
[3:53] here in the book of Hebrews the eleventh
[3:56] chapter they in the book of Hebrews the
[4:01] eleventh chapter Amen we gonna take up
[4:07] there from the 24th verse
[4:17] a man we see here the 24 verse by faith
[4:25] Moses when he come to years refused to
[4:32] be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter
[4:34] choosing rather to suffer the
[4:38] afflictions with the people of God than
[4:41] to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[4:44] season esteeming the reproach of Christ
[4:47] greater than riches and treasures of
[4:52] Egypt for he had respect unto the
[4:56] recompense of the reward by faith he
[5:00] forsook Egypt not fearing the wrath of
[5:05] the King for he endured as seeing him
[5:12] who is invisible a man I'm gonna read
[5:17] that again
[5:18] he forced Sir and we know Egypt there
[5:24] was a type of bondage of the world a man
[5:29] there was three Exodus going on there
[5:32] and at that time he was calling a church
[5:38] out of a people then he was calling a
[5:42] bride out of a church a man so we see
[5:47] that Egypt represented the world amen
[5:54] and once we were they were called out he
[5:57] sent the deliverer a man Moses there to
[6:00] bring the people out because he had
[6:03] heard the cries and also he was the
[6:07] Prophet Abraham was saying that the
[6:11] people his people would dwell in bondage
[6:14] for 400 years and then he would bring
[6:17] them out by a strong hand and it was
[6:19] time for that prophecy to be fulfilled
[6:22] amen so we see that he forsook Egypt
[6:28] fearing not fearing the wrath of the
[6:31] King not fearing the world or not
[6:34] fearing the world politics or not
[6:37] fearing what man might say he forsook
[6:41] Egypt a man not fearing the king and he
[6:45] endured as seeing him who was invisible
[6:52] a man and we know that a prophet is a
[6:55] seer so he was seeing him who was
[7:01] invisible a man let us pray
[7:04] most gracious Heavenly Father we thank
[7:06] you Lord God for Lord God this wonderful
[7:10] wonderful time Oh father God that you've

[8:15] their faith Lord God Lord God to where
[8:18] they can believe that something is said

[8:42] way Lord God we ask you to Lord God to
[8:44] just take full complete control of
[8:46] father God in Jesus precious name I pray
[8:49] amen
[8:50] man you may be seated a man I'm gonna a
[8:54] member the help of the Holy Spirit
[8:57] attempt to suggest um to bring forth and
[9:02] this little thought here and it's not
[9:06] really a title or anything we're just to
[9:08] treating it like a Bible study any
[9:10] managers continue in this uh this book
[9:13] Hill and speaking on Moses in the face
[9:16] and things that that that Moses had and
[9:20] how and then sort of just bring that
[9:23] into the day and basically to show how
[9:28] important how important faith is you
[9:32] know you know faces of Revelation and
[9:35] maybe we had a prophet in this hour that
[9:37] came in and and he and he told that he
[9:39] said it's a revelation you can't have
[9:41] faith in something Amen that you that
[9:43] you that you don't have any clue of a
[9:46] man if you if you've never driven a car
[9:49] before if you if you've never done it
[9:52] before your first time get behind the
[9:54] wheel it's a little bit difficult to
[9:57] have complete faith in that vehicle any
[10:01] man you have to you know push the will
[10:03] the gas pedal just a little bit gingerly
[10:06] a man you got the tester steering wheel
[10:09] a little bit you know what I mean you
[10:11] have you you you move cautiously but
[10:14] seeing the things of God it has to be
[10:17] faith come to a level and we're going to
[10:19] get over some of that we're gonna go
[10:20] over some of that some of those things
[10:23] amen
[10:25] glory to God let's turn to your Bibles
[10:29] there and Exodus the 23rd we'll start
[10:31] there and then we're just gonna break
[10:33] some things open here and amen
[10:40] hope it'll be a blessing to you
[10:43] a man Exodus the 23rd chapter and he has
[10:51] it
[10:51] third verse a man and behold I send an
[11:01] angel before thee to keep thee in the
[11:05] way and to bring thee to the place which
[11:09] I have prepared beware of him and obey
[11:14] his voice provoke him not for he will
[11:17] not pardon your transgressions
[11:21] my name is in him a man he says my name
[11:27] is in him
[11:29] but if thou will indeed obey his voice
[11:32] and do all that I speak then I will be
[11:38] an enemy to thine enemies and an
[11:40] adversary to thine adversaries for my
[11:44] angels shall go before thee amen and we
[11:48] see here that God is speaking to his
[11:51] servant Moses and during that time you
[11:55] know the children of Israel had was went
[11:59] into Egypt playing man through the
[12:02] blessings of Joseph and they sort of
[12:05] just got in there and got to look
[12:06] complacent amen and they got in and then
[12:09] and and and in the scriptures say that
[12:12] there arose a pharaoh that knew not
[12:14] Joseph and began a man to you with the
[12:17] retired masters
[12:19] Amen now put the children in bondage now
[12:23] it was a la Mona just say that it was a
[12:25] subtle bondage they came in to Egypt as
[12:29] friends and they came in as well this is
[12:33] a good thing but slowly what happened is
[12:36] they got comfortable and and sort of the
[12:39] old example of the frog in the pot amen
[12:44] the water wasn't hot when the Frog got
[12:46] in but he gradually turned it up and so
[12:49] that's the same thing that happened
[12:51] there needs you they got complacent and
[12:54] they got comfortable but see it was
[12:55] still an Egyptian land and they were
[12:57] still strangers in
[13:00] so what happened was the Pharaoh he
[13:02] decided say wait a minute now
[13:04] I can I can these people commodities
[13:08] amen and just like the world see us
[13:11] today they see us as a they what they
[13:14] call it as human resource they manage
[13:17] this country a man was built on the
[13:19] backs of slave labor amen and that's why
[13:22] the country is probably wonder it is one
[13:25] of the richest countries because they
[13:27] had through that time and they came up a
[13:31] man through that time on free labor
[13:33] while everyone else was treating their
[13:36] people well and paying their people in
[13:38] and doing them right Amen this country
[13:41] came up on the backs of slaves delayed
[13:45] the railroads and roads and cotton
[13:47] fields and they made plenty of money
[13:49] selling all kind of things with free
[13:51] labor see so this is the same thing the
[13:56] same spirit was they back then that
[13:58] Pharaoh saw an opportunity say well we
[14:01] got these people down here and we can
[14:04] use them a man to make us wealthy it's
[14:09] the same thing that's going on today but
[14:11] see God heard the cry of his people know
[14:19] there was a man now by the name of
[14:22] Abraham who solved the the things that
[14:26] the children of Israel was going through
[14:29] and he would come in and he would pray
[14:32] say Lord deliver the people and today we
[14:37] see the same thing see that the thing
[14:39] that the people are going through these
[14:41] are God's children and God's people and
[14:44] we see that there that the backs of the
[14:48] taskmaster it is on them trying to Amen
[14:52] to make them a conforming to this world
[14:56] image it's the same thing that's going
[14:59] on the day my brothers and sisters amen
[15:02] so we see
[15:06] thank you brother now he says here it is
[15:11] my home believe
[15:12] that you know give us a call without
[15:16] repentance every time God wants to do
[15:26] something he has the right man on the
[15:31] scene at the right time there's a time
[15:35] he says that a brick mason anybody can
[15:38] leave blocks but it takes a Master Mason
[15:42] to turn the corner so anytime God is
[15:46] getting ready to to make a move or to do
[15:49] something he has to have a man there a
[15:52] man that has the ability a man to to to
[15:57] to to uh give it's not that he has any
[16:01] special ability he's just a chosen
[16:04] vessel amen and Moses just happened to
[16:07] be a chosen vessel from birth or the
[16:09] Prophet said that he had a peculiar
[16:11] birth amen and it had a lot to do with
[16:14] it his mother and his father they're
[16:16] praying amen and at the age of 40 God
[16:21] finally called Abraham to his call
[16:25] he called Abraham and he said I he
[16:29] realized that he started to feel
[16:33] something on the inside he began to look
[16:36] at those people and he and he felt
[16:39] something for him what was that that was
[16:42] the heart of God a man dealing with
[16:45] Moses a man he was the Prophet said that
[16:48] he looked through the same window that
[16:49] Pharaoh was looking through Pharaoh saw
[16:53] commodity jump moves I saw God's people
[16:57] okay he saw a commodity Moses all God's
[17:03] people
[17:04] amen and that's how we should be today
[17:06] we look at men and women that are
[17:09] trapped in the system of this world
[17:12] trapped in bondage of sorts of things
[17:18] trapped in a denominational system
[17:22] in a religious system trapped in in in
[17:26] in all kinds of things that this world
[17:28] is offering one day we should have a
[17:30] compassion for these people that say to
[17:34] say kids is something I can do for you
[17:37] because we were there at one time I know
[17:41] I was there at one time
[17:43] amen and we should have that sort of
[17:45] heart the same heart that God had for
[17:48] the people amen and when he's seen at
[17:51] the time the people was going he need
[17:54] this and he was born a peculiar child
[17:58] and then he became at the age of about
[18:01] 40 years old a man that God called him
[18:04] to his purpose a man but the people
[18:07] misunderstood Moses he said the people
[18:10] misunderstood Moses this is not an I get
[18:12] this close the hardest thing the hardest
[18:17] thing for God has ever had to deal with
[18:22] is to with people is to get one mortal
[18:29] to believe another but say that again
[18:34] the hardest thing that God ever had to
[18:38] deal with was to get one mortal to
[18:42] believe another that's the hardest thing
[18:46] ever has been done to get one mortar to
[18:49] believe well they believe Jesus was the
[18:53] son he said they believed that he was
[18:56] the son of God they believed in God but
[19:01] he said him being a man making himself
[19:06] equal with God they were like I came by
[19:08] that I came by that imagine at that time
[19:13] when went when Jesus was on the scene
[19:19] amen and this man here had the
[19:23] opportunity you standing right there in
[19:25] front of God manifested in flesh God
[19:30] manifested the fullness of the Godhead
[19:33] bodily standing there in front of you in
[19:35] a fleshly flaw and all you can come up
[19:39] with is you being a man thinking you
[19:44] equal with God now that same person he
[19:49] said those things and then there was
[19:51] another lady who who who had seen the
[19:54] things that he had done and her face was
[19:58] so ignited she said I know if I can just
[20:01] touch to him of his garment I'll be made
[20:03] whole she and he said beard under you
[20:07] according to your faith be it unto you
[20:10] according to your faith a man now he
[20:18] said being a poor peasant a man born in
[20:22] a manger with a background like he had
[20:24] from a family raised up one garment and
[20:29] he lived away he did not even a place to
[20:33] lay his head said foxes have dens and
[20:36] birds have nests but the Son of man has
[20:38] no place to lay his head how he could
[20:40] that man be the Son of God how could
[20:45] that be he claimed to be but he was he
[20:49] was the son of God now they believed it
[20:54] but it was too late for them their
[20:59] destination had been sealed away those
[21:03] who rejected him now they came to the
[21:06] belief but it was too late their
[21:08] destination had been sealed away amen
[21:11] now when the angel came to the servant
[21:16] if you get this he says now when the
[21:20] angel came to your servant here he said
[21:25] if you get the people to believe now
[21:31] that's a hard thing to do if you can
[21:34] ever get the people to believe how many
[21:38] believers are God all you have to do is
[21:42] believe Christ you believe the
[21:46] he goes now now now now that's not the
[21:49] question that he's trying to get to you
[21:51] tonight
[21:52] I'm glad you believe in Christ I'm glad
[21:55] you believe in the Holy Ghost that makes
[21:59] you a Christian amen that makes you a
[22:04] Christian but that is not what I'm
[22:10] trying to get you to you now I get to
[22:15] that when you make the altar call
[22:18] you must believe them first he's talking
[22:22] about believe in Christ believing the
[22:24] Holy Ghost if you're not in connection
[22:28] with them
[22:28] you'll never know this but as much as
[22:32] you believe in them
[22:35] you still got to believe that I'm
[22:40] telling you the truth of what I'm saying
[22:45] is the truth now this is the prophets
[22:47] object so see we can parallel the
[22:50] Prophet to Moses that was up there was a
[22:52] pillar of fire that attracted Moses on
[22:55] the mountain and told Moses to go back I
[22:58] have heard the cry of the people in need
[23:00] you go back and deliver the people go
[23:03] back with a message Moses say I'm not an
[23:06] eloquent speaker I can't deliver these
[23:08] people on my own how can I do this he
[23:10] said Moses what is that you have in your
[23:12] hand he said I had this is a stick
[23:14] he'd say throw down the stick he threw
[23:16] down a stick it turned into a serpent he
[23:19] said that'll be one sign and then he
[23:21] told him he said the others the voice of
[23:24] the other side he's gone he gave Moses
[23:26] two signs he said if they don't believe
[23:29] the first one that they'll believe the
[23:31] second a man he said just go and I'll be
[23:35] with you
[23:36] so it wasn't Moses delivering the people
[23:40] he was just a vessel that God was using
[23:44] it was compelling it was Christ all
[23:47] alone because Moses Moses by faith we
[23:51] seen that net in Hebrews say by faith he
[23:54] believed in seeing him who
[23:56] invisible Moses had a revelation of who
[24:00] he was talking to of who was leading him
[24:04] so the people had to believe Moses he
[24:08] said if you could get the people to
[24:10] believe you amen and the people had to
[24:13] understand that God was not going to
[24:18] come down and reveal in the pillar of
[24:19] fire to all him he was going to have one
[24:22] man in his hand one man in his hand and
[24:25] they had to believe that one man a man
[24:28] and that's the same thing today a man
[24:32] God sent a prophet like it unto Moses a
[24:35] man so he said he said the Christians if
[24:39] you have you can get you to
[24:41] believe now what I'm trying to get you
[24:45] to to get you to make the altar call you
[24:48] must believe then the Holy Ghost first
[24:50] you must believe in Christ first but
[24:52] much as you believe in them you still
[24:55] have to believe that I'm telling you the
[24:57] truth of what is the truth amen
[25:03] now when the people began to cry out God
[25:07] do this for us send us to deliver send
[25:12] us that he saved as thousands of people
[25:14] dying yearly of cancer yearly of all of
[25:18] these different things he said God heard
[25:20] the cries of the people and if he heard
[25:23] the cries of the people we were here
[25:25] just last night we meet here every other
[25:27] Tuesday the sisters meet here every
[25:29] other Tuesday for prayer me.we you don't
[25:31] think God hear the cries of the people
[25:33] he hears the cries of the people amen
[25:36] and if you have to believe and have
[25:39] faith that God hears the cries of people
[25:40] and he is willing he wants to answer the
[25:43] prayers amen but it's all it's up to our
[25:46] faith a man we're gonna get into her to
[25:49] see how that faith he says it's like a
[25:51] guitar it's like a string on an
[25:52] instrument sometime that face has to
[25:55] come up here and your faith may be down
[25:57] here but it has to be tuned up and he
[25:59] says whenever that faith gets up to that
[26:01] level there's no devil that can stay
[26:04] keep you in bondage I don't care what
[26:08] I don't care what it is amen now he says
[26:16] now God gave him two signs and he said
[26:21] you're going to perform this sign that
[26:24] we're casting a serpent down or a snake
[26:26] or the rod down and he said you if they
[26:32] won't believe that one didn't L believed
[26:35] the other one they'll believe the fray
[26:37] don't believe the first sign they'll
[26:39] believe the second one God delivered his
[26:41] people out of bondage back there from
[26:44] under the Egyptians so he can deliver
[26:46] the people under the bondage of sickness
[26:48] because he did that for a purpose
[26:51] now the signs what was the signs for the
[26:57] sign that he gave he did the same thing
[26:59] to the Prophet in this thing it was not
[27:01] the signs don't heal you
[27:03] it is to anoint your faith to believe
[27:07] that the same God a man that did it back
[27:11] then
[27:11] the same God is here today to do the
[27:15] same very exact same thing when you get
[27:18] the baptism of the Holy Ghost he says
[27:20] that is the earnest of your salvation is
[27:22] that right in other words it is the
[27:24] downpayment and it'll make you feel like
[27:27] like if you don't if the down payment or
[27:29] make you feel a man like this what about
[27:33] when we received the full benefit it'll
[27:36] be glorious a man he said that we see
[27:40] the healing healing is just a down

[28:19] talking in
[28:21] but I'm saying today you'll see you'll
[28:24] see coming to this platform and we've
[28:26] seen already where he field cancer he's
[28:30] healed all sorts of things a man and
[28:34] it's gonna be other things a man that
[28:37] that happened right here you'll see
[28:39] blind eyes come open a man you'll see

[28:56] taken care of you'll see tuberculosis
[28:59] being healed you'll see this in our
[29:01] midst and you have to have that faith to
[29:06] believe if it's any doubt and what makes
[29:10] that guy be that you don't believe the
[29:11] hour that you're living in that the what
[29:14] like what causes you're the daddy that
[29:15] you don't have the revelation of a who
[29:18] you are be who he is and his desire to
[29:21] bring these things to pass and you don't
[29:24] have a revelation of the Audi but that
[29:26] we're living in this is the time this is
[29:30] the time for the manifestations of the
[29:33] sons and daughters of God right now is
[29:36] the time
[29:37] you know if once you can you can get to
[29:40] that like that evidence in that black
[29:43] faith see the scripture said by faith
[29:45] that he did these things
[29:48] amen by faith it has to be according to
[29:53] our faith and what's going to elevate
[29:55] our faith the revelation of the gospel
[29:57] the unfolding of Jesus Christ into our
[30:00] heart the unfolding of the gospel the
[30:02] unveiling of the truth amen you can't
[30:05] even worship unless you're worshipping
[30:09] in truth there are so many there's so
[30:14] many out there in the world today that
[30:16] are worshiping worshiping sincerely
[30:21] worshiping and feeling and anointing but
[30:25] worshiping in error you cannot worship
[30:29] in error if
[30:31] even worshipping God or your worshipping
[30:35] a graven image or your worshipping a
[30:40] graven image there is no middle of the
[30:44] road it's either your worshipping God or
[30:48] your worshipping the devil by accident
[30:53] thinking you're worshiping God Cain and
[30:58] Abel both brought their fruits
[31:01] they both worship team brought his fruit
[31:06] basket God did not even accept it did
[31:12] not accept his worship Abel brought a
[31:20] bloody lamb that was slain with a sharp
[31:25] rod
[31:26] he told him if you will go back and
[31:29] worship like your brother I will accept
[31:32] your sacrifice and he couldn't do it he
[31:36] couldn't do it so you bring that up to
[31:39] the day there's so many worshiping
[31:43] worshiping in error and not worshiping
[31:47] who they think they're worshipping why
[31:50] because they had a problem or they have
[31:55] a problem accepting or believing what a
[31:59] man say there's been so many times I've
[32:04] been in this message and I've tried many
[32:07] at times to talk to people we need a lot
[32:10] of times see but you know what it's not
[32:12] even putting the profit picture up
[32:13] because they confuses people hello look
[32:16] ya'll worship in a man no we're not
[32:19] worshiping the man you see that pillar
[32:21] of fire over his head that's the same
[32:24] color fire Amen that not Palo Alto the
[32:27] same full of fire that Moses followed
[32:30] who was it God Almighty that's who we're
[32:34] worshiping we're just not worshipping in
[32:37] error we are right in line with the
[32:42] scripture
[32:44] right in line with the scripture that's
[32:47] how a man we can be called out of
[32:50] bondage why because we believe amen are
[32:54] the words of this prophet and we walked
[32:57] out of those denominational systems that
[33:00] were held us bound and he meant to tell
[33:02] us the days of miracles are past and
[33:05] told us that all of these isms and
[33:08] schisms and things that was just not in
[33:11] the Bible I'm able to believe that God
[33:19] invited that man amen according to
[33:23] Malachi 4 according to revelation 10 7 a
[33:28] man according to st. Luke 17 and 30 a
[33:32] man you'll see here we're at one point
[33:36] the prophet of God was talking he said I
[33:39] used to be ashamed to say these things
[33:41] but there arose even in him a boldness
[33:44] to say the things that had happened to
[33:47] him he said that uh that angel had came
[33:51] to me the same way the angel came to
[33:55] Moses and gave him two signs gave him a
[34:00] sign in his hand he said it was a
[34:02] vibration that was the only way that he
[34:05] could describe it that he was able to
[34:07] put his hands on the people and he could
[34:09] tell what their sickness was he can tell
[34:13] if they had or whatever was he said now
[34:16] it came up with some haptic learning
[34:18] because he said that he had a problem
[34:21] sometimes the finally sometime women's
[34:24] sicknesses and different things like
[34:25] that they meant the other one that he
[34:28] would be able to discern the thoughts
[34:29] and the intents of your heart he'll be
[34:32] able to look into your life and go back
[34:34] and see what's going on in your life and
[34:37] tell you who you are where you come from
[34:39] what you did
[34:41] tonight they made me say not those
[34:44] things don't heal you but what they do
[34:49] do is get your faith to a level that you
[34:52] know that you wouldn't a presence of
[34:54] Almighty God amen
[35:01] well to get you in the presence of
[35:04] Almighty God and let me tell you
[35:05] something my brother's sister that was
[35:07] to get your faith up for a healing but
[35:09] healing is a minor the healing is a
[35:15] minor a man we are Moses brought the
[35:21] children of Israel out of Egypt they
[35:24] came across the wilderness they made
[35:27] they seen all kind of signs and wonders
[35:29] they seemed the Red Sea open up they
[35:32] made that same stick amen that Moses
[35:35] hair was the stuff the stick of judgment
[35:37] he took that stick and he raised it over
[35:40] the Red Sea and God looked through the
[35:43] pillar of fire angry eyes and that see
[35:45] pull back so that the people to God to
[35:47] walk across on dry land the people
[35:49] walked across old dry land and he killed
[35:53] renew the easier tried to follow him and
[35:55] then they all tried that same wilderness
[35:59] journey they wit not all to the rock and
[36:02] he had water come out of a rock because
[36:04] the people had a need that same journey
[36:08] he took that same stick he made it put a
[36:11] sling on it because the people were sick
[36:14] for the hill and other people say look
[36:15] on this what was it it was a type of the
[36:18] cross it was a type of judgment your
[36:21] sins already on the cross it was a
[36:24] revelation
[36:25] amen of what was to come amen
[36:29] and some of those people still only wish
[36:33] only went to signification and it was
[36:36] only to any man that had enough faith to
[36:39] like my brother was talking about Sunday
[36:41] cross over that Jordan they had to fade
[36:44] that he brought us through this
[36:46] he brought us through the Red Sea he
[36:48] brought us through this wilderness he
[36:50] delivered
[36:50] from the hands of this enemy that we are
[36:53] more than able to go over and take the
[36:56] land to face the Hittites to face the
[36:59] lead life
[36:59] what are these examples of demonic
[37:02] spirits a men that try to control us and
[37:05] keep us from what the full manifestation
[37:07] of being the sons of God and then once
[37:11] you get the Holy Ghost he said you
[37:12] didn't say that you never stopped
[37:14] fighting hey man you're still gonna have
[37:16] to fight you're still gonna have to
[37:19] battle you're gonna have to battle
[37:20] sickness you're gonna have to about a
[37:22] financial issue you're gonna have to
[37:24] battle all sorts of thing but it's
[37:27] bringing you to perfection it's bringing
[37:29] you to a place that you're going to
[37:31] conquer you're gonna continue to conquer
[37:33] you're gonna continue to conquer and the
[37:35] Bible say that your border will expand
[37:38] he said it won't happen fast but you're
[37:41] gonna stay right there and you're gonna
[37:43] continue to conquer until you have
[37:46] already conquered everything he said
[37:48] you're more than a conqueror because
[37:52] he's already conquered it for you all
[37:56] you have to do is accept it all you have
[37:59] to do is accept it
[38:01] amen he says here at one time I was
[38:08] afraid to make this statement but here's
[38:11] what it is friends that I can't get you
[38:14] to those things those diseases are told
[38:17] it's perfect the secrets of their heart
[38:20] if they don't believe the first one I
[38:23] can't get them on the first one and then
[38:26] they'll come on the second one it goes
[38:29] right back and begin to dig up their
[38:33] lives and tell them now what that got to
[38:39] do he says now give me your undivided
[38:41] attention for a few minutes friends it
[38:44] he said that doesn't heal anybody that
[38:48] only brings a person's faith up when
[38:51] that person here he might come and tell
[38:54] me he's got faith but I know his words I
[38:58] know his word for it but when you're
[39:03] under
[39:03] that anointing as it is right now
[39:07] he can can't come and deceive that I
[39:11] know when he's got faith or not he might
[39:16] think he has faced faith there's the
[39:19] thing that the people think they have
[39:21] faith when they haven't got faith isn't
[39:25] that right but when there's when they
[39:27] weigh down here and saying they got
[39:30] faith he said it isn't up here
[39:33] it's like tuning a string on an
[39:37] instrument when it comes and comes and
[39:40] coincides with this up here the thing is
[39:44] ready any demon that got that person
[39:47] bound has got to turn loose when that
[39:51] type of faith comes when that type of
[39:55] faith comes amen we we have to my
[40:01] brothers and sisters get back to in the
[40:05] Garden of Eden Adam and Eve didn't worry
[40:09] about nothing they didn't worry about
[40:13] anything because they had there was a
[40:15] certain faith there I think that was a
[40:18] certain kasi there was no sin they
[40:20] didn't know sin Sam brought unbelief
[40:22] that's what's in it was unbelief
[40:25] there was no faith there I'll give you
[40:27] an example deficient ELO's through the
[40:35] scientific mind and see that's just it
[40:38] the world through education they all
[40:42] they have because they don't do not
[40:44] believe in the supernatural they don't
[40:47] believe in a miracle working God they
[40:49] lean on education and science to science
[40:52] well as five loaves of bread and two
[40:55] fish
[40:55] so maybe you can feed seven people so
[40:59] well if you cut the fish in half that
[41:02] make for half and five loaves of bread
[41:04] so if you take the bread and cut it in
[41:07] half then that gonna divide the bread up
[41:11] and you can go a little further now if
[41:13] you take them and fire them have that
[41:14] made Gordon good I see science device
[41:17] to feed a multitude but God multiplies
[41:23] the God multiplies so that is the faith
[41:28] a man that we have to get back to we
[41:32] have to get see our thinking is is is
[41:34] scientific who it being and the
[41:37] scientific thinking that there has to be
[41:39] something here for something to happen
[41:41] and no but we have to get back to even
[41:44] thinking that God said it that settles
[41:50] it it's going to be
[41:52] he said these signs shall follow them
[41:55] that believe it's gonna be
[41:58] he said I'm healed a man that's what it
[42:03] is I like my brother brother brother
[42:06] brother and if I have to believe all the
[42:09] way to the grave all the way to the
[42:11] grave lies arrested in the grave three
[42:14] days and it still came out still came
[42:20] out I'm gonna continue to believe in
[42:22] half faith amen so we have to understand
[42:27] my brothers and sisters now he says the
[42:32] people has as far as it comes to healing
[42:36] it is your faith in God your pastor
[42:40] can't anoint you with all in your own
[42:44] church and have faith in God it'll bring
[42:48] the same result just because the Prophet
[42:55] is no longer here that same vilified
[42:59] that same vilifies here that same pill
[43:04] of fire amen
[43:06] the word Amen what did he come to do is
[43:10] the opening of the word he came to tie
[43:13] up all of those loose ends so that we
[43:15] can have a perfect faith because we
[43:17] couldn't have a perfect faith without a
[43:19] perfect word we couldn't have a perfect
[43:23] faith but we have now a perfect word a
[43:28] man that was opened up about
[43:30] by your profit a twentieth century
[43:32] profit a man we were talking about Moses
[43:35] and we saw the things that Moses did he
[43:38] brought like I said there were three
[43:39] Exodus he brought her people out of a
[43:41] church out of her people and then a
[43:44] bride out of a church a man and that's
[43:48] what's happening he's calling a caller
[43:51] people out of a Gentile bride amen a
[43:55] Gentile out of a church and then out of
[43:57] that church he called us out of lady of
[44:01] seal into the bride age what's that
[44:04] crossing over Jordan into this fair land
[44:07] a man were weakened how our faith has to
[44:10] match a man and that that where we are
[44:13] if we say we're in a varieties if we're
[44:16] say we're in the full manifestation a
[44:19] man of God let's like it unless hold to
[44:22] that let's let our faith rise amen
[44:25] because I believe my brothers and
[44:27] sisters that we're living at a time
[44:29] where now is the time to have that faith
[44:33] if you believe that that a rapture is
[44:37] round the corner if you believe that the
[44:39] rapture is at him our faith must match
[44:44] that belief our faith must match that
[44:49] belief no matter what we're going
[44:51] through no matter what the situation
[44:54] might be we have God as God has heard
[44:58] the cry of his people he's heard the
[45:02] cries the people that he has sent the
[45:03] deliverer the deliverer came and brought
[45:07] us into this marvelous light now let's
[45:09] continue to walk in the light of that
[45:12] word walking little in that light like
[45:15] Enoch did until we walk into that life
[45:18] and we walked right into the changing of
[45:20] his body we walked right into a garment
[45:24] change now is the time my brothers and
[45:27] sisters now is the time to have the full
[45:30] faith amen
[45:32] not just the faithful a financial
[45:38] blessing or the faithful or these are
[45:40] but a faith for a change
[45:42] about mortal bodies now I don't know if
[45:47] that sounds far-fetched but it's not but
[45:50] that's what it's gonna take by the open
[45:53] and a full revelation of this gospel
[45:56] that's where he promised the foolish
[45:58] that a manifestation an angel an angel
[46:03] came to Mary and said Mary you've been
[46:07] highly favored of the Lord and what he
[46:11] did was he planted a blood gene in the
[46:16] womb of Mary amen and and when one day
[46:20] and she she went through the tribe
[46:24] masters and and and through nine months
[46:26] of of caring a menace child a man that
[46:30] one day that was a manifestation there
[46:34] was a manifestation of a Christ right
[46:38] there standing before the bride you've
[46:44] been found highly favored and in your
[46:47] womb has been placed amen the Word of
[46:51] God
[46:52] a sea and that sea hey man has been
[46:56] watered it's been growing amen
[46:59] they have the faith amen to produce amen
[47:03] the full Christ again in this hour not
[47:06] saying that people think a minute that
[47:09] you're gonna walk the streets amen and
[47:12] you're gonna just be no that's not it
[47:14] but you have a faith you walk because
[47:17] you walk circumspectly you don't walk to
[47:20] the order of this world you don't walk
[47:22] to scientific thinking you walk to a
[47:24] supernatural God you want you to believe
[47:27] for this word that one day that soon
[47:30] your body is going to be changed from
[47:31] immortal to mortal to immortality and
[47:35] the healing is just a downpayment my
[47:38] brothers and sister to bring your faith
[47:41] to a level to believe nothing is
