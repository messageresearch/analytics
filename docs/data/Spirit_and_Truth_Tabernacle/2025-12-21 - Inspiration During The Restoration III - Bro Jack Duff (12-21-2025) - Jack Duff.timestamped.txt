[5:16] the wise men coming to see our savior
[5:20] to come and and bow down before the king
[5:24] to worship a king that was a baby,
[5:28] somebody that didn't have more wisdom
[5:30] than you at the time, somebody that
[5:32] couldn't protect himself, but you bow
[5:35] down and worship him because of his
[5:36] position. You knew that he was the king.
[5:40] He's the savior. So how much more should
[5:43] we worship the one that has risen from
[5:46] the grave? It paid the price that we
[5:48] could not pay. Let's sing this slow song
[5:51] together. Oh come all ye faithful,

[7:04] Let us
[7:10] Oh come let us
[7:15] adore
[7:17] him. Oh come let us
[7:23] adore

[19:52] seeds lie in the ground in the darkness
[19:55] where the struggles and the warfare
[19:57] really take place and warfare takes
[19:59] place on your knees.
[20:01] He'll open. He'll show you amongst

[29:30] situation. And Father, you alone are the

[30:40] to help your people, Lord, to draw
[30:42] closer to you. And Father, we pray,
[30:44] Almighty God, over the giving, Lord
[30:46] Jesus. You have blessed us each one to

[30:50] grateful, Lord. We're grateful for your
[30:51] love and your your provision, Father. We

[31:14] unto to us. Good measure, pressed down,
[31:17] shaken together, running over with men
[31:19] given to our bosom, Lord Jesus, in order

[46:34] Appreciate y'all musicians. God bless
[46:36] you. Amen.
[46:38] Amen.
[46:41] Amen.
[46:43] Um, I won't I won't take too much your
[46:45] time. You can grab your Bibles. I'll
[46:47] just make a few quick uh announcements.
[46:50] Um, I heard the prayer requests for uh
[46:53] Sister Boyd and I wanted to just u
[46:55] mention I sent the brothers a text.
[46:58] Sister Boyd is um I'm going to say she's
[47:02] one of the uh she is a she's evidence of
[47:08] the restoration.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; All right. when this season that God has
[47:13] brought us through our restore, sayith
[47:14] the Lord, Sister Boyd, we used to
[47:17] fellowship um back together years ago
[47:20] and and um so during this season, God
[47:23] has been bringing her right back and and
[47:26] um uh the enemy's attacking her her
[47:28] household. Uh she has a son, his name is
[47:32] Quincy, and uh she text me and said,
[47:35] "Quincy actually has to have a surgery
[47:37] this week." And you know, that's not
[47:38] easy right before Christmas. And you
[47:41] know, and um I mean, I hate to say it
[47:44] like this, but sometimes people can go
[47:46] to the hospital and get more sick,
[47:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[47:51] &gt;&gt; Uh so um I'm, you know, I'm I'm actually
[47:55] headed right out of town. Soon as I
[47:58] leave the pull pit today, I'll greet you
[48:00] all and then I'll be jumping on a plane
[48:02] this afternoon headed to Ghana uh for
[48:05] some meetings. And I pray that you all
[48:07] pray for me. But I always really make my
[48:10] arrangements like this because I like
[48:13] being in church. And not only do I like
[48:16] being in church, I like being in church
[48:18] with y'all.
[48:23] There's nothing I like better than when
[48:25] God's children get together. It feels so
[48:29] good
[48:30] &gt;&gt; just being here again. But, uh, I asked
[48:33] the brothers, I put something out there,
[48:34] brothers, if you all wouldn't mind if
[48:36] you all would, um, if just a couple of
[48:39] you would go and just encourage Brother
[48:42] Quincy. Uh, Brother Quincy knows about
[48:44] this message. Uh, Brother Quincy, uh,
[48:48] was a really, really good singer back in
[48:51] the days. Uh, you know, and and but, uh,
[48:55] I believe he's also a part of the
[48:57] restoration.
[48:58] And so if since I can't go, if I can
[49:01] just get a few brothers to be an
[49:02] extension of Spirit and Truth Tabernacle
[49:05] and go and just pray over that brother
[49:08] either before his surgery or after his
[49:10] surgery. Let's just show him that we
[49:12] care about him. We love him. We're
[49:14] concerned. He's in Bethesda West. No,
[49:18] I'm sorry. Bethesda Memorial Hospital. I
[49:20] don't know if that's West or East, but I
[49:22] gave you all the contact information for
[49:24] sister board. can text her and just get
[49:26] the exact, you know, details. But just a
[49:28] few brothers, if y'all don't mind, uh,
[49:31] taking care of that, uh, for Spirit and
[49:33] Truth Tabernacle. Amen. Not not for
[49:36] brother Jack, but for Spirit and Truth
[49:38] Tabernacle. I would really appreciate
[49:40] it. Amen. We we thank God. Uh, all
[49:44] right. Um, I think that's all I need to
[49:47] mention. Brother Stanley, so good to see
[49:49] you. God bless you. Amen.
[49:53] And Cesaly
[49:55] is in the house. God bless you. She's
[49:58] one of the daughters of the house.
[50:00] Sister Michelle's oldest girl. Amen. She
[50:04] uh has moved away. Praise God. But we
[50:07] wait for the day for you to return.
[50:09] Amen. Amen. The porch light is always
[50:14] on.
[50:15] Praise God. All right. All right. All
[50:17] right. Let's Yes.
[50:20] Sister Gwena, where at? Well, praise. Oh
[50:25] my God bless you, Sister Gwenna. Good to
[50:29] have you. God,
[50:31] she come to see the granny's. Amen. Good
[50:35] to have. And and we we saw um uh her son
[50:39] Joey. Amen. On on on Friday night, he
[50:41] didn't want to sing no special. So uh
[50:44] but we thank God for Joey. Good to see
[50:46] you, brother. God bless you. Amen. Let
[50:48] us uh turn in our Bibles. Amen. Um to uh
[50:53] a passage here in Jeremiah,
[50:56] which is where we have been. And you all
[50:58] are fully aware of um the the location
[51:02] for the New Year's Eve service. They
[51:05] should have had that on. We announced
[51:07] that. Okay. Uh so we'll be looking
[51:10] forward to seeing everybody uh there. I
[51:14] I I I just when I heard that they were
[51:16] going to use their sanctuary, I'm like,
[51:18] "No, we got to have a New Year service.
[51:20] We got to." So, we we found this
[51:23] location and um um we'll have the
[51:27] building to oursel and I think it's just
[51:29] going to be a real blessing. Amen. So,
[51:32] we we we looking forward to it. All
[51:34] right. Um Jeremiah 29, I I'm going to
[51:39] start at verse 10 today.
[51:42] Um and we'll try to move a little faster
[51:45] into this thought. Uh it says here, "For
[51:49] thus sayeth the Lord that after 70 years
[51:52] be accomplished at Babylon, I will visit
[51:56] you and perform my good word toward you
[52:00] and causing you to return to this place.
[52:03] For I know the thoughts that I think
[52:04] toward you, sayeth the Lord, thoughts of
[52:08] peace and not of evil, to give you an
[52:12] expected end. And as I mentioned, this
[52:14] scripture is one of those life verses
[52:17] for Christians. I mean, it it it you
[52:20] know, anytime you're going through any
[52:22] trial, you you you have to be reminded
[52:26] that God knows the thoughts he has for
[52:28] you. No matter how hard that trial might
[52:31] be, God knows the thoughts he has for
[52:34] you. And the another scripture says that
[52:36] my thoughts
[52:38] are not like your thoughts
[52:41] and and my ways are so much higher than
[52:43] your ways. Sometimes we we can't
[52:46] comprehend and understand how God does
[52:48] the things that he does. But we have to
[52:51] resolve
[52:53] within ourselves that he is God
[52:57] &gt;&gt; and he's worthy
[52:59] &gt;&gt; in the good times
[53:01] &gt;&gt; and he's still worthy
[53:03] &gt;&gt; in the bad times.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; David said, "I will
[53:14] bless the Lord
[53:17] &gt;&gt; at all times."
[53:19] And David said his praise.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; His praise. His praise shall continually
[53:34] &gt;&gt; be in my mouth.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; And then he invited you to do something.
[53:38] Said, "Oh,
[53:41] magnify
[53:43] &gt;&gt; the Lord with me. Let us exalt his name
[53:46] together.
[53:50] Please let me read this scripture.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Sometime know, you know, when you when
[53:57] you've been a Christian for a long time,
[53:59] you done read the Bible and you got, you
[54:00] know, some of this just in you. When you
[54:02] going through certain things, this what
[54:04] come up about you.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; It just come rising up at you.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Boy, I praise him in the good times. I
[54:12] praise him in the bad time.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm going to praise him.
[54:20] Hallelujah.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; But but this verse 11, it says, "For I
[54:24] know the thoughts that I think toward
[54:26] you, sayeth the Lord, thoughts of peace
[54:28] and not of evil, to give you an expected
[54:31] end. Then shall you call upon me, and ye
[54:36] shall go and pray unto me, and I
[54:40] that's a promise.
[54:42] God going to hear your prayer."
[54:44] And and I'm tell probably some of the
[54:46] greatest words that a believer can hear
[54:48] is I heard your prayer.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; That mean the answer is is present.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; If I heard your prayer, the answer is
[54:59] present.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; You done touched the heart of God. I
[55:03] heard your prayer. Now, thus sayith the
[55:05] Lord this and thus sayith the Lord that.
[55:07] I that's that's what that's what we long
[55:09] to hear. He says, I I I I then shall you
[55:12] call upon me. ye shall go and pray unto
[55:14] me and uh and I will hearken unto you
[55:17] and ye shall seek me and find me when ye
[55:21] shall search for me with all your heart.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; And I will be found of you, sayaeth the
[55:27] Lord, and I will turn away your
[55:30] captivity. That's restoration.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; I will turn away your captivity and I
[55:34] will gather you from all the nations.
[55:37] That's restoration,
[55:39] right? Uh and it says uh and from all
[55:41] the places whether I have driven you
[55:43] sayeth the Lord and I will bring you
[55:45] again into the place where I caused you
[55:48] to be carried away captive. Restorations
[55:51] all over this says because ye have said
[55:55] the Lord hath raised us up prophets in
[55:59] Babylon. I I just like that. Let's pray.
[56:02] Father, we thank you for the word. Thank
[56:05] you for every promise that you have made
[56:07] to us because your promises are yay and
[56:11] amen.
[56:13] Uh we thank you, Father, for the saints
[56:15] that have gathered here on this blessed
[56:17] day. We trust, oh God, that you would
[56:21] minister to every heart and to every
[56:22] need. Thank you for the worship that has
[56:24] happened thus far, the specials, the the
[56:27] uh the encouraging words through a poem.
[56:30] God, we just appreciate everything
[56:32] that's happened. And now we come where
[56:33] we must hear the word of God. We pray
[56:36] father that the word would be applicable
[56:39] uh to where we are right now in our
[56:42] journey. We give you all the glory. We
[56:44] give you all the honor. We give you all
[56:45] the praise. It's in Jesus name we pray.
[56:48] Amen. Amen. God bless you. Can be
[56:50] seated. Um our journey continues. Amen.
[56:54] In the subject of inspiration during the
[56:58] restoration.
[56:59] uh uh you know, as we've been working
[57:02] with this for the past couple um sermons
[57:05] that I preached, we um um we
[57:09] highlighted, you know, just verse uh 11
[57:12] there in Jeremiah 29 and just, you know,
[57:14] what um uh a Google search would produce
[57:19] as far as uh when you, you know, you
[57:22] when you want to look at, okay, what are
[57:24] some of the devotions that are around
[57:26] this? And you know, they talked about
[57:28] being able to trust in God's timing,
[57:30] enduring through suffering and and being
[57:32] able to surrender control. All of that
[57:34] is in that verse. But the the higher uh
[57:38] view of this verse, if I could say,
[57:40] amen. Uh this verse was written at a
[57:43] time uh that Israel was in exile and
[57:48] they went into exile because of uh just
[57:52] some of the things that they allowed to
[57:54] happen, how they got themselves away
[57:55] from God. Uh so they ended up where God
[57:58] allowed them. I mean the land was
[58:00] blessed. God gave them this promised
[58:02] land. It was blessed and and and somehow
[58:04] they just just allowed themselves to to
[58:07] drift away from God. And uh when they
[58:10] when they drifted away from God, then
[58:13] God drifted away from them and he
[58:15] allowed the Babylonians to come in and
[58:18] take over their land. Carried them away
[58:21] into bapti captivity. Carried them away
[58:23] from I mean a land so far away from
[58:25] where they were. Many of them died
[58:27] there. But there were many great things
[58:28] that still happened in Babylon.
[58:30] Hallelujah. God can still move in
[58:34] Babylon.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; One of the things that God did in
[58:38] Babylon is that there were there was a
[58:41] man that decided that no matter what cuz
[58:45] he had a promise in the scripture that
[58:47] if he would just pray,
[58:49] &gt;&gt; right, that God would actually hear his
[58:51] prayer no matter where he was. So he
[58:53] would turn his face. He found out what
[58:55] direction he was in. And he turned his
[58:58] face towards the temple and he be to
[59:00] pray.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And uh and and and and one
[59:03] day, I mean, I don't know why the people
[59:05] so upset about him praying. Amen. But
[59:09] they got so upset about Daniel praying
[59:12] that they came up with a scheme that if
[59:15] anybody pray in the name of any other
[59:18] god outside of the name of the king at
[59:20] that time, he said they have to go into
[59:22] this lion's den. And the king thought
[59:24] that was a great thing, you know. So he
[59:26] signed the the the the the you know the
[59:28] little uh order, executive order, if I
[59:32] can put it that way. The king sign an
[59:35] executive order and uh and the king
[59:38] forgot. Hallelujah. Maybe the king had
[59:41] an ego problem.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; But the king forgot,
[59:46] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. Amen. that when they signed
[59:49] this order, there was one man that he
[59:51] loved that was going to be impacted. And
[59:53] as soon as it was signed, they went
[59:55] looking and scheming said, "Okay, we got
[59:58] it signed." So, now we're going to see
[59:59] if Daniel prayed. Daniel heard that the
[1:00:02] thing had been sign. And Daniel went to
[1:00:04] his house and and what we understand is
[1:00:06] that Daniel didn't shut the windows, but
[1:00:08] Daniel opened up the windows.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. I if if you want to
[1:00:13] see me pray, I'm going to be at the same
[1:00:15] place at the same time every day.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And Daniel went right back
[1:00:21] to that his prayer closet and he began
[1:00:23] to pray. Them boy them boys said, "We
[1:00:24] got him now." And they went down and
[1:00:26] told the king, say, "Look, we got him."
[1:00:28] He was praying in in the name of his
[1:00:30] God, and now it's time to put him in the
[1:00:32] lion's den. Well, in Babylon, Daniel
[1:00:35] went into that lion's den. But in
[1:00:37] Babylon, Daniel also came out
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; of the lion's den. God can move
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; in Babylon.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; The Hebrew boys were thrown in the fiery
[1:00:50] furnace down in Babylon.
[1:00:54] You know, and and I I don't know if I
[1:00:55] have time to get into some of these
[1:00:57] things because there were prophecies
[1:00:59] that Daniel actually spoke of the end
[1:01:01] time that happened down in Babylon.
[1:01:05] Hallelujah. Lord, I I would love to get
[1:01:07] into all that, but we'll we'll have to
[1:01:09] just go as far as we can today. We um we
[1:01:12] we read the scripture there where
[1:01:14] Jeremiah said in verse 15, "Because you
[1:01:16] said, the Lord have raised us up
[1:01:18] prophets in Babylon." Daniel was a
[1:01:22] prophet in Babylon. Ezra, the book of
[1:01:27] Ezra in the Bible, that was a prophet in
[1:01:30] Babylon. Nehemiah comes out of Babylon.
[1:01:35] Uh, Haggi, right, comes out of Babylon.
[1:01:39] Zachchariah comes out of Babylon. We're
[1:01:42] gonna hopefully hit a little bit of that
[1:01:44] today. And another one that I thought
[1:01:46] was very important was Malachi.
[1:01:50] We talked about that on last week. Amen.
[1:01:53] And we stopped at chapter 3 in Malachi
[1:01:56] because that's where God uh instructs us
[1:01:59] of how he wants us to handle our
[1:02:02] finances.
[1:02:04] It comes from a prophetic word that was
[1:02:06] released in the ex the post exile period
[1:02:09] when them coming out of Babylon. You got
[1:02:11] to understand when when I when I when I
[1:02:13] thought about that, you know, why would
[1:02:15] God actually put that scripture there
[1:02:17] when they're coming out because 70 years
[1:02:20] had got away and I can imagine the
[1:02:22] people got away from their tithing and
[1:02:24] offering.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; I mean, where were where were they going
[1:02:28] to take the tithing to,
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; right? I mean, there was no temple to go
[1:02:31] to, you know? I mean they were in they
[1:02:33] were in complete captivity. Can I can I
[1:02:35] put it this way? They were even in
[1:02:37] captivity in their finances.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; Right. So So God had to raise up a
[1:02:44] prophet and and the reason that God uses
[1:02:46] a prophet a prophets Amen. Uh uh primary
[1:02:50] responsibility is to bring you back to
[1:02:52] the word.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; So God raises the prophet Malachi and he
[1:02:56] says look I I challenge you to to prove
[1:03:00] God. bring your tithes and offerings to
[1:03:02] the storehouse. And he said, "Prove me
[1:03:05] now and and see when I open up the
[1:03:07] windows and pour you out blessings where
[1:03:10] you have room not enough to receive." He
[1:03:12] say, "I will rebuke the devourer for
[1:03:15] your sake if you would just
[1:03:19] just give me 10% of your income.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; You can keep the other 90%."
[1:03:26] I'm the outside of your offering now,
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; but you can keep the rest of it, but
[1:03:30] just just give me that and see what I
[1:03:32] just blessed like you never imagined.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; And and look here, I'm a witness that
[1:03:38] God still does this. This this ain't
[1:03:40] just something that happened in the post
[1:03:42] exileic period. This still happens
[1:03:44] today.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; And and his blessings are still
[1:03:47] overtaking us today.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; Your my blessings are far too many to
[1:03:51] number.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:54] But but but we we we we we we went there
[1:03:57] to Malachi. Amen. Chapter 3 on last
[1:04:00] week. But but but but you know, I'm a
[1:04:02] I'm a message believer.
[1:04:05] And uh and I and I love I love the
[1:04:08] message of the hour. I'm going just be
[1:04:09] honest with you. I love I love that God
[1:04:12] has allowed me to see Amen. some of the
[1:04:14] things that I see. I I'm glad that he
[1:04:16] opened up my understanding to the word
[1:04:18] of God. I I I love being a message
[1:04:21] believer. Amen.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. Amen. And and let me
[1:04:26] just let me just just drop this off real
[1:04:28] quick. Uh when we first started the
[1:04:30] church, Amen. Uh years ago, my wife had
[1:04:33] a friend of hers, her grandmother was a
[1:04:35] old Pentecostal. And she watched how
[1:04:38] things have changed in the Pentecostal
[1:04:40] church. And she told she said she told
[1:04:42] her her her her granddaughter, she said,
[1:04:44] "Tell tell Jack that whatever he start
[1:04:47] out preaching don't change."
[1:04:50] That was old old old time say she said
[1:04:53] whatever you start out preaching don't
[1:04:54] change she could say that because she
[1:04:56] saw the changes in the church. So so
[1:04:58] when she said that I took courage not
[1:05:00] and and I'm still preaching the same
[1:05:03] thing today that I was preaching back
[1:05:05] then
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; and God has blessed the preaching.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we we thank God for lives
[1:05:10] have been changed because of the
[1:05:12] preaching. So we thank God for that. But
[1:05:14] being a message believer, I can't stop
[1:05:17] at the tithes and offering in Malachi 3.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; There is more to the book of Malachi
[1:05:23] that we must discuss.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Let us let us look at it. Amen.
[1:05:34] This morning, praise God. Let me let me
[1:05:37] let me let me So be before before I I
[1:05:41] uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's look at this.
[1:05:43] Let's Oh my before I before I hit
[1:05:45] Malachi, I'm going to I'm going to hit
[1:05:47] Malachi 4, but there was a a scripture
[1:05:49] Zechariah being a prophet uh also during
[1:05:53] this time and I I want to read something
[1:05:55] out of Zechariah and I want to read out
[1:05:56] out of out of Malachi. Uh let I tell you
[1:06:00] what, let's just go to Malachi. Let's
[1:06:01] read it. Malachi 4. Now
[1:06:05] again, post exileic scriptures.
[1:06:08] This is scriptures that are coming after
[1:06:11] um they have um
[1:06:14] they have they're coming back from
[1:06:16] bondage after 70 years. This is a time
[1:06:19] of restoration. And Malachi comes on the
[1:06:23] scene at this time and he he begins to
[1:06:25] prophesy. But Malachi's prophecy
[1:06:29] actually was a prophecy for our day.
[1:06:33] Now look at him in Malachi 4 verse one
[1:06:36] says, "Behold, the day cometh." And I
[1:06:40] just love this. This is the the uh the
[1:06:43] way that the Bible's written. This is
[1:06:44] the last book in the Old Testament
[1:06:47] because the Bible actually has, you
[1:06:49] know, the Old Testament, New Testament.
[1:06:51] This is the last book in the Old
[1:06:53] Testament and the last chapter in the
[1:06:56] Old Testament and the last verse in the
[1:06:59] Old Testament that speaks to our day.
[1:07:04] Malachi speaking of us.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Look at this now. He says, "For behold
[1:07:09] the day cometh that shall burn as an
[1:07:12] oven, and all the proud, yay, and all
[1:07:15] that do wickedly shall be stubble, and
[1:07:18] the day come and and the day that cometh
[1:07:20] shall burn them up, sayeth the Lord of
[1:07:21] hosts, that it shall leave them neither
[1:07:24] root nor branch. Evil's going to be done
[1:07:26] away with at some point in time."
[1:07:27] Hallelujah. says, "But unto you that
[1:07:31] fear my name, shall the son of
[1:07:34] righteousness rise with healing in his
[1:07:37] wings, and ye shall go forth and grow up
[1:07:40] as calves of the stall. And ye shall
[1:07:43] tread down the wicked, for they shall be
[1:07:46] ashes under the souls of your feet, in
[1:07:49] the day that I shall do this, saith the
[1:07:51] Lord of hosts." Now look at this.
[1:07:54] Remember ye the law of Moses, my
[1:07:56] servant, which I commanded unto him in
[1:07:58] Horeb, for all Israel, with the statutes
[1:08:00] and judgments. In verse 5, behold, I
[1:08:05] will send you Elijah. This is Malachi
[1:08:11] prophesying about an Elijah to come. Now
[1:08:14] look, he says, "Behold, I will send you
[1:08:17] Elijah the prophet." Glory to God.
[1:08:21] before the coming of the great and
[1:08:23] dreadful day of the Lord. Now, now let's
[1:08:25] let's let's just let's process this. All
[1:08:27] right, the next verse says this. And he
[1:08:30] shall turn the heart of the fathers to
[1:08:32] the children and the heart of the
[1:08:35] children to the fathers, lest thou come
[1:08:37] and smite the earth with a curse. Now go
[1:08:40] back to the the verse five. Elijah is to
[1:08:43] come before the great and terrible day
[1:08:46] of the Lord, which is a day of judgment.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; Oh my God. My God. And see this that
[1:08:52] that's why it connects over to Daniel 70
[1:08:54] weeks and all of that, but I don't have
[1:08:56] time to tie those things together today.
[1:08:58] But uh but but but we realize that uh
[1:09:01] Daniel when he prophesied, he said
[1:09:02] there'll be 70 weeks determined to the
[1:09:04] people. So there's a time uh that that
[1:09:07] God's going to end this whole thing up.
[1:09:09] And let me tell you, by the time Jesus
[1:09:11] started his ministry, 69 of the 70 weeks
[1:09:15] had already been completed. Hallelujah.
[1:09:18] It was Jesus that got cut off in the
[1:09:21] midst of the week, which was the last
[1:09:24] week that God promised Daniel before
[1:09:26] this thing comes to an end. Jesus
[1:09:29] ministry lasted three and a half years,
[1:09:31] which was the the middle of the last of
[1:09:34] the 70 weeks for Daniel that was
[1:09:37] prophesied in the scripture. Hallelujah.
[1:09:39] But but before all before God, amen,
[1:09:41] would bring destruction on the earth,
[1:09:43] what he says is that I'm going to send
[1:09:45] you Elijah the prophet before the coming
[1:09:48] of the great and dreadful day. Now,
[1:09:51] there are people that would say that
[1:09:53] this is John the Baptist, but John the
[1:09:55] Baptist did not come at the time of the
[1:09:58] great and dreadful day.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was a great day, but not a
[1:10:03] dreadful day. John the Baptist
[1:10:05] prophesied and his ministry happened,
[1:10:07] Amen. at the coming of a redeemer.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; That's not a dreadful day. Amen. That
[1:10:12] was a that was a big change for mankind.
[1:10:15] Had not had not Jesus come and did what
[1:10:17] he did, we'd all be in trouble.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, so this was not John the
[1:10:22] Baptist ministry. That's why when you
[1:10:24] look at verse six, it's very important
[1:10:26] that you catch it. Amen. There is two
[1:10:29] ministries spoken here in verse six.
[1:10:31] Now, both of them will have the
[1:10:33] ministry, Amen. or the spirit of Elijah.
[1:10:37] Hallelujah. But there's two different
[1:10:38] things happening. The first thing
[1:10:40] happening in verse six, he will turn the
[1:10:42] hearts of the fathers to the children.
[1:10:45] Now, that actually was John the Baptist
[1:10:48] ministry right there. Hallelujah. He
[1:10:52] turned the heart of the fathers to the
[1:10:54] children. But the the second part and
[1:10:56] John the Baptist did have the spirit of
[1:10:58] Elijah on him. But the second part is
[1:11:01] for our day. The and Amen. the heart of
[1:11:05] the children to their fathers, lest I
[1:11:07] come and smite the earth with a curse.
[1:11:08] That is us. What does it mean to have
[1:11:10] your heart turned back to the Amen to to
[1:11:13] the heart of to the fathers? That simply
[1:11:15] means that our hearts will now turn
[1:11:17] right back to the word of God.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; And what is what what am I saying here?
[1:11:24] Because when you go to church today,
[1:11:26] you'll see people that do things that's
[1:11:28] not actually in the word of God anymore.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:33] Let let me just let me be, you know, I
[1:11:35] use this example all the time. Anytime
[1:11:37] you see somebody, especially a woman uh
[1:11:40] today that calls herself a bishop,
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; that's out of the word of God. How do
[1:11:45] you know that? Because the Bible say
[1:11:46] that the bishop is supposed to be
[1:11:49] husband.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; Husband.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Husband is a is a masculine thing,
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; right? I mean, only the man is the
[1:11:59] husband in a relationship.
[1:12:02] Oh my.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; I know we trying to reverse these roles.
[1:12:08] I don't care how much he taking care of
[1:12:10] the kids and she going out to work. His
[1:12:12] title is still husband.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; It's supposed to be
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; husband. And there's responsibilities
[1:12:20] that go with the husband.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; My God. But the scripture actually say
[1:12:25] that the bishop is supposed to be
[1:12:26] husband of one wife. A woman cannot be
[1:12:30] husband.
[1:12:34] Unless it's a lesbian relationship,
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Am I preaching yet?
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; A woman can't be husband unless it's a
[1:12:45] lesbian relationship. And spiritually,
[1:12:47] the church has gotten off into a
[1:12:49] spiritually lesbian relationship when
[1:12:51] they leave the word of God. All right.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; So when we say turn our hearts back to
[1:12:57] Amen the the the what the father said.
[1:13:00] We're going back to what was written in
[1:13:01] the scripture. No. Paul is not a woman
[1:13:04] hater.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Not at all.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; We don't believe that. Ain't nobody
[1:13:07] going to sell us on that. These things
[1:13:09] were written for a purpose. God has a
[1:13:11] God has God has a reason. And let me
[1:13:13] tell you something. God know the
[1:13:14] thoughts that he have for you.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; They're not thoughts of bondage. They're
[1:13:19] actually thoughts of freedom. Yes,
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; we talk about being free in the word of
[1:13:22] God.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Everything we do, we can
[1:13:26] point it back to the word of God. Why
[1:13:28] y'all dress the way y'all dress? Let me
[1:13:30] show Let me read it to you out the
[1:13:31] Bible.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Why y'all act the way y'all act? Let me
[1:13:34] read it to you out the Bible. That's
[1:13:36] turning your heart back to the word, not
[1:13:38] turning our heart towards popular
[1:13:39] opinion.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; No, our hearts are turned back to what
[1:13:44] the word of God says. And and and I
[1:13:47] don't do things just because brother
[1:13:49] Brandham said it. What brother Brandham
[1:13:51] said is what I see in scripture. And
[1:13:53] what he said was to actually get me back
[1:13:55] to looking at scripture.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; So here we got Amen. Um Malachi
[1:14:06] prophesying about our day. Now Zechariah
[1:14:13] also prophesies about our day. And and
[1:14:16] we're going to try to bring these two
[1:14:17] things together. what we just read out
[1:14:19] of Malachi and then we want to pick
[1:14:20] something up over in Zechariah chapter
[1:14:23] 4. Let's read let's read Zechariah 4.
[1:14:27] Actually, give me give me uh let me just
[1:14:30] read a quote here for you and then I
[1:14:31] I'll go to Zechariah 4. This is coming
[1:14:33] out of images of Christ.
[1:14:36] Praise the Lord. Oh my I love I love
[1:14:38] this message. I love I love the word,
[1:14:40] you know. Um, I I was just as I was
[1:14:43] looking at my notes here, my mind went
[1:14:46] down memory lane. And when we started
[1:14:48] off the beginning of the year with this
[1:14:50] this theme of overflow and I will
[1:14:52] restore, say the Lord, get back in step.
[1:14:55] When we start off the beginning of the
[1:14:56] year, uh, I took you all on a journey
[1:14:58] where I showed you multiple scriptures
[1:15:02] where God actually uh, was prophesying
[1:15:05] about brother Brandham's ministry. Look,
[1:15:06] we not we not following other brother
[1:15:08] Brandon because, you know, we ain't got
[1:15:11] nobody else to follow. No, we're
[1:15:13] following we're following Christ through
[1:15:15] the word.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; I mean, wait a minute. Okay. I mean,
[1:15:19] look look if if if if if they didn't
[1:15:22] receive John the Baptist because John
[1:15:24] was the actual one fulfilling turning
[1:15:26] the heart of the the the foster
[1:15:28] children, we we need to know who doing
[1:15:29] this.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; I mean, here here Malachi speak about
[1:15:32] it. Well, who's the one that's doing
[1:15:34] this? Right? Because this ain't just
[1:15:36] this ain't, you know, we not we're not
[1:15:38] just going to church just we going to
[1:15:39] church. We we we want to be in truth,
[1:15:42] right? So So if God say he going to do
[1:15:44] something, we want to know how this
[1:15:45] thing be fulfilled. So back in that day
[1:15:47] when John the Baptist came on the scene,
[1:15:49] he never really even identified himself
[1:15:50] as the one fulfilling it. They had to be
[1:15:52] able to read between the lines. And
[1:15:55] Jesus eventually told them, you know,
[1:15:57] he's already come and gone. But he say
[1:15:59] there will be another one that's going
[1:16:01] to come and restore all things.
[1:16:03] That was this whole restoration because
[1:16:05] brother Brandham's ministry was to
[1:16:06] restore the truth back to the people.
[1:16:09] All right, let's let's let's let's look
[1:16:11] at this. Let's look at this. In images
[1:16:13] of Christ, it says that's the only way
[1:16:15] we know God is to follow the leading of
[1:16:17] the Holy Spirit. It says that's
[1:16:20] oldfashioned. It's God's program. It's
[1:16:22] always been God's program. It's always
[1:16:23] will will be God's program. Not by
[1:16:25] power, not by might, but by my spirit,
[1:16:29] saith the Lord. And and and I want to I
[1:16:32] want to uh uh just kind of mention
[1:16:34] something because um and and and and and
[1:16:38] in the message
[1:16:40] because we're following this truth. I
[1:16:42] can just tell you right now, you won't
[1:16:44] have a lot of members
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; in a message church unless you're
[1:16:48] overseas. Here in the states, because of
[1:16:51] the condition of the states, you won't
[1:16:53] have a lot of members in the message
[1:16:54] church because this is uh most people do
[1:16:57] not want to walk this tight.
[1:17:02] I'm just being honest. Most people do
[1:17:04] not want to come in line with the
[1:17:06] scripture like that. They they they just
[1:17:08] want enough church.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Huh? To say I went. But to actually uh
[1:17:14] surrender to that word and let that
[1:17:17] change you from the inside out, they
[1:17:19] don't want all that, man.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But that's what makes you
[1:17:24] like Jesus.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Hey, and look, look, let me tell you
[1:17:27] something. Jesus didn't go partway to a
[1:17:29] cross. He went all the way to the cross.
[1:17:31] Had nails in both hands and in his feet.
[1:17:35] Jesus died on that cross.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; This was no half job. This was this was
[1:17:41] a full job. Not only did he die, but he
[1:17:44] rose again.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; He had to do the complete work.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; And then he said, "We got to take up our
[1:17:50] cross and we got to follow."
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Taking up your cross mean I got to
[1:17:56] give up some things of the world.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; I got to give that up. Yes, you do.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; I got to give this up. I got to give
[1:18:04] that up. I got I got a sacrifice. And
[1:18:05] look, your sacrifice ain't nothing near
[1:18:07] his sacrifice.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; All right, church.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; But most of the time, you're going to
[1:18:15] find small groups gathering because
[1:18:19] people don't want to walk in the
[1:18:20] fullness of the word. But I can tell you
[1:18:22] this much. I can go anywhere in the
[1:18:23] world if I know that somebody they they
[1:18:26] just reach out to me say, "Yeah,
[1:18:27] brother. We we we we looking for someone
[1:18:29] to come and preach. We believe this
[1:18:30] message." And all I just got to talk to
[1:18:32] them just for a little bit. I can tell
[1:18:33] what they believe. And if I know that
[1:18:36] they got that that sold out uh uh uh
[1:18:39] commitment to God, it's very easy for me
[1:18:41] to go and just fellowship with them,
[1:18:44] brother, like I like I like I like I've
[1:18:46] always known them.
[1:18:48] You can go, we can go anywhere in the
[1:18:50] world and fellowship with people that
[1:18:52] that's that's on this because look, if
[1:18:54] you accept this and you walk in it, I
[1:18:56] know you got a you got a tight life.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; You got a tight life.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; I can trust a tight life.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; All right, let me let me let me go on.
[1:19:07] I'm trying to get there. Um, it's not by
[1:19:11] power, nor by might, but by my spirit,
[1:19:13] sayith the Lord. That's where it comes.
[1:19:16] And and let's look at this statement.
[1:19:17] Long long fellow once said this. The way
[1:19:20] to succeed is to find a worthy cause
[1:19:23] that's being talked about. A worthy
[1:19:26] cause that's being talked about and then
[1:19:28] hold on to it.
[1:19:30] Uh should something that's been talked
[1:19:32] about turned down by science is worthy,
[1:19:35] then hold on to it. Now, now before I go
[1:19:37] further, just scroll that back down. Uh
[1:19:39] I don't want to go ahead of them. Um, I
[1:19:43] I I I started thinking, well, what is a
[1:19:44] worthy cause? That's something that we
[1:19:46] should hold on to.
[1:19:48] And he gonna come and say something here
[1:19:50] about the gospel, but then it just hit
[1:19:51] me. This message is a worthy cause that
[1:19:55] we should hold on to. Something that's
[1:19:57] talked about. How do we know it's talked
[1:20:00] about? All you got to do is go on the
[1:20:02] internet and you just do a search with
[1:20:04] Google,
[1:20:05] put in William Brandham's name, and
[1:20:07] watch how much negative stuff will come
[1:20:08] out. And here's my my thing. I I I I I
[1:20:12] realize that what comes on Google, you
[1:20:14] don't even know whether it's true or
[1:20:15] not.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Somebody else put that out there. So,
[1:20:19] you don't know whether that's true or
[1:20:20] not. They'll tell you it's a cult. It's
[1:20:22] a this is that. No, no, no. For me, I
[1:20:24] just read it in Malachi chapter 4 that
[1:20:27] God was going to send Elijah. And I'm
[1:20:29] saying William Brandom is the
[1:20:31] fulfillment of the second part of that.
[1:20:33] I say John the Baptist is the
[1:20:35] fulfillment of the first part of that.
[1:20:37] And if you don't agree with that, just
[1:20:38] tell me who he is.
[1:20:41] and let us work through it together
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; because I'm looking for truth
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; and if this is this then what we need to
[1:20:51] do is get deeper into it.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And let it just change us.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; So
[1:20:59] this message is a worthy cause that we
[1:21:01] should hold on to. No, despite what
[1:21:03] anybody says, this is something that we
[1:21:06] should hold on to. Now look at what he
[1:21:08] says in his next paragraph. He says, "Do
[1:21:10] you know in 1872
[1:21:12] the Medical Association of the United
[1:21:14] States turned down bathtubs.
[1:21:19] They said they are absolutely
[1:21:23] unsanitary
[1:21:25] and said they will scatter diseases."
[1:21:28] Bathtubs. Now, now, now, so in 1872,
[1:21:32] your parents were probably telling you
[1:21:33] to stay away from bathtubs. They
[1:21:36] probably had washed stuff. Now they talk
[1:21:37] they say a bathtub unsanitary. Now in my
[1:21:41] mama them day. Hallelujah. Uh some of
[1:21:44] y'all go back go when they might have
[1:21:46] had to uh or maybe their parents when
[1:21:49] they might have had to share.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; See y'all y'all heard y'all heard my my
[1:21:56] mother-in-law.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Huh? They they they go back to them days
[1:21:59] where Yeah. You talk about unsanitary.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; They had to share bath water. And and
[1:22:07] and and and sometimes you wanted to be
[1:22:09] the first one to get in the water.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; And you had a big family,
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; brother. They had to have some real salt
[1:22:22] back there.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; But by
[1:22:28] By the time you got in the water, the
[1:22:30] water was so dirty.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; And you talk about that that's a bathtub
[1:22:36] is unsanitary. No. What we did before
[1:22:39] bathtubs
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; was unsanitary.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Now, back in those days, because they
[1:22:44] probably believe what medical medical
[1:22:46] science was saying, don't get a bathtub.
[1:22:48] Don't get a bathtub. People probably
[1:22:49] avoid it. Now, we force you into I get
[1:22:52] in that bathtub, boy. Get in there and
[1:22:53] take a bath.
[1:22:57] things change over time.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; It says baptis, they finally come to it.
[1:23:03] Then he goes and says in this
[1:23:04] oldfashioned gospel that we're talking
[1:23:06] about, washed in the blood of the lamb,
[1:23:08] it may seem oldfashioned, but they'll
[1:23:10] have to come to it sooner or later. It's
[1:23:13] a worthy cause. Hold on to it with all
[1:23:16] you've got. It's a blood wash blood
[1:23:19] washed away. A blood washed away. It
[1:23:21] cleans a man up. not going out there
[1:23:24] drinking and smoking and riding around
[1:23:26] and calling themselves Christians. There
[1:23:28] it is, young people. Keep that one.
[1:23:29] There's a quote you can highlight and
[1:23:31] you can put in your uh uh on your table
[1:23:35] app so somebody asks you about drinking.
[1:23:37] Brother Brandham told us,
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. Says not going out there
[1:23:42] drinking, smoking, and riding around and
[1:23:44] calling themselves Christians.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Says because they belong to a
[1:23:50] church. It's that clean, unadulterated
[1:23:54] Holy Spirit in a human life that
[1:23:56] reflects Jesus Christ, the son of God.
[1:23:59] That's why people today reject the new
[1:24:01] birth. Oh, they got what they call the
[1:24:04] new birth. Now, when he say they got
[1:24:05] what they call a new birth, some people
[1:24:07] got it in their intellect.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; But when it come, it'll change the way
[1:24:11] you live.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Let me go on. He says, he says, I went
[1:24:15] up shaking hands with the pastor, but
[1:24:17] that's not a birth of reason. They won't
[1:24:20] accept it. That's why they go to uh go
[1:24:22] to join churches because they can come
[1:24:24] in some intellectual way. God said
[1:24:26] except a man be born again, he cannot
[1:24:29] even see the kingdom of God. No matter
[1:24:30] how intellectual you may be or how good
[1:24:33] a Christian you claim to be, you got to
[1:24:35] be born again.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let us go on here. I want to
[1:24:42] catch this. Zechariah 4. Malachi 4
[1:24:45] connects to Zechariah 4 here.
[1:24:49] Zachchariah is one of the prophets that
[1:24:51] raised up uh during this time of the
[1:24:54] post exilelic period. Again, some
[1:24:56] inspiration during this um this
[1:25:00] restoration. These are just some of the
[1:25:03] different prophets that that that that
[1:25:04] that we have we've been able to to
[1:25:07] catch. Zechariah 4
[1:25:10] says this, "And the angel
[1:25:14] talked with me uh uh talk with me, came
[1:25:17] again and walked
[1:25:19] and wake me as a man that is waken out
[1:25:22] of his sleep and said unto me, what
[1:25:24] seeest thou?" And I said, I have looked,
[1:25:27] behold, a candlestick of all gold with a
[1:25:30] bowl upon the top of it, and his seven
[1:25:33] lamps there upon, and seven pipes to the
[1:25:37] seven lamps which are upon the the top
[1:25:39] thereof, and two olive trees by it, one
[1:25:43] upon the right side of the bowl, and the
[1:25:45] other upon the left side thereof.
[1:25:48] Now, you know, when the prophets are
[1:25:50] prophesying, it seems all symbolic.
[1:25:54] Let me let me let me just drop this off.
[1:25:56] So, what you're reading here,
[1:25:58] Zachchariah is is is prophesying about
[1:26:00] something and it's symbolic. We we want
[1:26:02] to what what are these two olive trees?
[1:26:05] What's these two bowls? What's what's
[1:26:07] the one on the left side, the one on the
[1:26:08] right side? And if a prophet could write
[1:26:11] it, wouldn't it be sensible to believe
[1:26:15] that a prophet would also interpret it?
[1:26:22] So we don't have to sit here and wander
[1:26:24] around and let me let me also go go see
[1:26:27] we don't have to stumble around with
[1:26:29] theologians trying to interpret it.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. We can go straight to a prophet
[1:26:33] and get the interpretation of it. This
[1:26:36] is why we go back and say brother
[1:26:38] Brandham said because a prophet is
[1:26:41] bringing the interpretation of what I'm
[1:26:43] reading in the scripture. Now we have
[1:26:45] what we call clarity.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; And that's what we want. We want
[1:26:52] clarity. We don't want to stumble around
[1:26:53] in the darkness. We want to be able to
[1:26:55] see clearly.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Let me just keep reading. Then I'll tell
[1:26:59] you what the prophet said about it.
[1:27:02] Watch this now. He says this. The two
[1:27:04] olive trees by it. One upon the right
[1:27:08] hand of the bowl and the other upon the
[1:27:09] left side thereof. So I answered and
[1:27:12] spake to the angel that talketh me,
[1:27:15] saying, "What are these, my Lord?"
[1:27:18] And the angel that talked with me
[1:27:20] answered and said unto me, "Knowest thou
[1:27:21] not what these be?" And I said, "No, my
[1:27:25] lord."
[1:27:27] Then he answered and spake unto me,
[1:27:29] saying, "This is the word of the Lord
[1:27:31] unto Zerubbabel."
[1:27:34] Now, now, now Zerubbabel,
[1:27:36] uh, if we were to, you know, we read
[1:27:39] about him last week, and that he was,
[1:27:41] his name, and and I'll read it again in
[1:27:42] a second. His name was found in Ezra
[1:27:45] chapter 5 verse one uh verse one and
[1:27:48] two. Zerubbabel was one of these guys
[1:27:50] that was a part of this post exile. So,
[1:27:52] so look at what he says now. He says um
[1:27:55] then he answered and said speak unto me
[1:27:57] saying this is what this is the word of
[1:27:58] the Lord unto Zerubbabel saying not by
[1:28:01] might
[1:28:03] nor by power but by my spirit sayith the
[1:28:06] Lord of hosts. Now here's another life
[1:28:08] verse for believers. when you really
[1:28:11] going through something, I'm talking
[1:28:13] about uh maybe a financial crisis and
[1:28:17] you really need God to make a way. This
[1:28:19] is one of them scriptures that we come
[1:28:20] back to like Lord, you said not by might
[1:28:24] nor by power. I'm not just depending on
[1:28:27] my job. I thank you for my job, but I'm
[1:28:29] not just dependent on my job.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; I need something beyond my job.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And and sometimes, you know,
[1:28:37] you you can't even just depend on a
[1:28:39] group of people,
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; right? I mean, like like when Gideon
[1:28:44] went down to fight in this battle, he
[1:28:46] had 300 going up against thousands.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; It was not by might nor by power, but by
[1:28:53] the spirit of the Lord that things get
[1:28:55] done. That way, God get all the glory.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:00] Sometimes you find yourself in a
[1:29:02] situation that you need a not by might,
[1:29:03] not by power, but by my spirit. You
[1:29:06] know, cuz when the spirit of God move,
[1:29:08] it does supernatural things. This this
[1:29:10] what I'm talking about. God, God, send
[1:29:13] me a Cyrus. And and and and cuz cuz cuz
[1:29:16] what I I mean, I was just sitting there
[1:29:18] thinking, I heard brother Solomon
[1:29:19] mention that earlier, but you know,
[1:29:21] Cyrus actually came during the
[1:29:23] restoration.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; That's when Cyrus showed up. It was
[1:29:29] during the restoration. I'm carrying
[1:29:31] this inspiration right on to next year.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; I'm still in the restoration cuz I'm
[1:29:38] looking for a Cyrus.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Now, now, now I'm going to tell you,
[1:29:42] there's going to be some seasons where
[1:29:45] God going to send you a Cyrus and
[1:29:47] there's going to be some seasons where
[1:29:49] God going to make you a Cyrus.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; But I will welcome both seasons.
[1:29:56] right now. Send me Osiris doing the
[1:30:00] restoration. I'm looking for my Cyrus.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Oh my God.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Look at this. Now look at this. It says
[1:30:13] um verse 7, who art thou, oh great
[1:30:15] mountain
[1:30:19] before Zerubbabel?
[1:30:21] Thou shalt become a plain.
[1:30:24] And and I don't want to just leave it at
[1:30:26] Zerubbabel. What What mountain is
[1:30:28] standing before us?
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Huh? You I'm I'm speaking to the
[1:30:33] mountain.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Mountain you shall become a plain.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; That mean it's going to be easy for me
[1:30:41] to walk across this.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; When you walk in a mountain, it's a
[1:30:45] struggle. But no, when it becomes a
[1:30:47] plane, it's easy to walk across.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; The the mountain will become a plane. I
[1:30:53] don't care what your mountain is. The
[1:30:56] mountain be getting ready to be
[1:30:57] flattened,
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; become flat land,
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Florida land. Praise God.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Woo.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Who art thou, oh great mountain, before
[1:31:10] Zerubbabel? Thou shalt become a plain,
[1:31:13] and he shall bring forth a headstone
[1:31:15] thereof, which shoutings, crying, grace,
[1:31:18] grace unto it. There's so much in here
[1:31:21] and I can't get it all today, but it's a
[1:31:23] lot in here, y'all. It says, "Moreover,
[1:31:26] the word of the Lord came unto me,
[1:31:28] saying, the hands
[1:31:30] of Zerubbabel
[1:31:32] have laid the foundation
[1:31:35] of this house. His hands shall also
[1:31:40] finish it." Let me just pause there for
[1:31:44] a second. Go back to Ezra chapter 5,
[1:31:47] verse one and two.
[1:31:55] So he has to lay the foundation and also
[1:31:59] finish the building.
[1:32:01] Now watch this verse uh verse Ezra 5
[1:32:04] because he was one of the prophets
[1:32:06] during this post-exic period says then
[1:32:08] the then the then the then the prophets
[1:32:10] Haggi
[1:32:12] the prophet and Zachchariah the son of
[1:32:14] Ido prophesied unto the Jews that were
[1:32:18] in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of
[1:32:21] the God of Israel even unto them. Then
[1:32:24] rose up Zerubbabel
[1:32:27] the son of Shelatiel and Jesua the son
[1:32:30] of Joedc and began to build the house.
[1:32:34] Now we just read how Zerubbabel
[1:32:37] was also uh uh he laid the foundation.
[1:32:41] And here we see Ezra tell us that
[1:32:44] Zerubbabel be to build the house of God
[1:32:47] which is at Jerusalem. And and and with
[1:32:50] them were the prophets of God helping
[1:32:52] them. And I just I love that. I love
[1:32:54] that. I I like seeing leaders that are
[1:32:57] involved.
[1:33:00] It's important. You know, Brother Random
[1:33:02] talked about two different types of
[1:33:03] leadership. He talked about um you know
[1:33:07] the the the the the the fire captains
[1:33:10] and one fire captain they had a fire
[1:33:12] blazing out of control and he put a big
[1:33:15] cigar in his mouth and he got there and
[1:33:17] he's telling the boys, you know, squirt
[1:33:19] a little water there and squirt a little
[1:33:22] water here and squirt a little water
[1:33:23] there. He just got a cigar that's
[1:33:25] puffing telling them where to squirt the
[1:33:26] water. He about to start another fire
[1:33:28] with that cigar, right? But squirt a
[1:33:32] little water here and squirt a little
[1:33:33] water there and the fire just burning
[1:33:35] out of control. It says, "But then there
[1:33:37] come another fireman." And it say
[1:33:39] another uh and and he's at this this
[1:33:41] this fire chief is not on the ground
[1:33:44] talking about squirt a little water
[1:33:45] here. He's at the top of the ladder.
[1:33:48] Amen. At the front of the ladder going
[1:33:50] into the fire and say, "Come on, boys.
[1:33:54] Let's put this fire out." He not on the
[1:33:56] ground. The man is in the fire. And God
[1:33:59] want leaders that'll get in the fire
[1:34:01] with the people.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Brother, I don't want to be a leader
[1:34:05] that's telling people just squirt water
[1:34:07] here and squirt water there. I want to
[1:34:08] be in the fire.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; I want to be involved with the people.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's two different types of
[1:34:17] leadership,
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; right? But but here we see in scripture
[1:34:20] in Ezra, man, these guys these guys are
[1:34:22] prophets, but they're here laying the
[1:34:25] foundation. And so we pick it up in
[1:34:26] Zechariah. And Zechariah says in verse
[1:34:29] 9, "The hands of Zerubbabel have laid
[1:34:33] the foundation."
[1:34:36] Amen. Of this house, his hands shall
[1:34:39] also finish it. Look at this. And thou
[1:34:43] shalt know that the Lord of hosts have
[1:34:47] sent me unto you. I I'm I'm I'm I'mma
[1:34:49] just I'mma just inject my own self in
[1:34:52] here.
[1:34:54] you know, was underneath um
[1:34:58] um
[1:34:59] Lord, I I was just recently talking to a
[1:35:02] brother and it just it just it just
[1:35:05] blessed me when I I'm I'm I'm getting
[1:35:07] off, but I I'll get back to it. It
[1:35:08] blessed me. I was talking to brother uh
[1:35:10] Tim when I went to visit him in
[1:35:12] Louisiana and um I was looking at how
[1:35:15] the Lord had just blessed their their
[1:35:16] their their church and and where they've
[1:35:19] come from and just what God has given
[1:35:20] them. G I think about 40 acres of
[1:35:22] property. They got a nice huge
[1:35:25] sanctuary. They got a gymnasium. And the
[1:35:29] reason that the gymnasium is on the
[1:35:30] property because brother Tim was uh on a
[1:35:34] uh he was called into court. Uh he had
[1:35:38] to be on the jury and there was a case
[1:35:41] was against a young lady that was going
[1:35:44] around to all the local gymnasiums and
[1:35:46] sweeping the getting all these little
[1:35:47] boys out the gymnasium, 12, 13, 14 year
[1:35:50] old boys. Oh yeah, I'll help you get a a
[1:35:52] scholarship and I'll help you do this
[1:35:54] and getting these boys to her house and
[1:35:56] then she is taking advantage of these
[1:35:58] boys when they get to her house. Well,
[1:36:00] they brought her up on charges for that.
[1:36:02] So, Brother Jim said, you know, our boys
[1:36:05] are going to those gyms. We need to have
[1:36:07] a gymnasium here that they ain't got to
[1:36:09] worry about stuff like that. So, on the
[1:36:11] 40 acres, they built a gymnasium. They
[1:36:13] built uh a a big fellowship hall. They
[1:36:17] built, you know, uh, if you want to do a
[1:36:19] outdoor fellowship, they put a big
[1:36:20] pavilion out there to do a fellowship. I
[1:36:22] mean, they just just property and things
[1:36:25] everywhere. He say, "Brother, everything
[1:36:26] been paid for by cash."
[1:36:31] I I I I I
[1:36:33] say, "Brother, I say, and brother Tim is
[1:36:35] in his 70s." I I say, "Brother, does it
[1:36:38] ever ever do you ever wonder why God
[1:36:41] would allow you to get all this now?
[1:36:45] I mean, your best years are, you know,
[1:36:48] back there, right? And and and he says,
[1:36:51] "Sit down, brother Jack. I need to tell
[1:36:52] you something." I said, "Okay." He said,
[1:36:55] he he says, "Brother, that's a good
[1:36:56] question." He says, "But here's the
[1:36:57] thing. The way all this started, it
[1:37:00] wasn't even me. It's the way God
[1:37:02] orchestrated all this to get all this
[1:37:03] started and everything that that
[1:37:05] happened. Even when my wife died, people
[1:37:07] gave me so much money that I could not
[1:37:09] use the money for myself. So, I put it
[1:37:11] back in the property."
[1:37:13] It says, "And what God showed me is that
[1:37:14] I'm not doing this for me. I'm doing
[1:37:16] this for the next generation."
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; And all I'm saying is that you know
[1:37:22] what? God has allowed me to pastor this
[1:37:23] church and allowed us to be able to save
[1:37:25] a little money. And that that money to
[1:37:27] me is going to be the foundation of
[1:37:30] where we getting ready to go.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; But I don't believe God going to take me
[1:37:34] nowhere until it is finished. So Rubel
[1:37:38] was a part of the foundation and a part
[1:37:40] of the finishing. I'm claiming the same
[1:37:42] thing for me.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Now, some of y'all need to catch all
[1:37:51] that.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; I'm the one gave money towards that
[1:37:55] building fund. I'm going to be part of
[1:37:57] the foundation.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; I'm going to see it built. I ain't going
[1:38:01] nowhere until it's built and I'm going
[1:38:04] to be part of the finishing.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; You got to claim your own. You got to
[1:38:08] claim it yourself.
[1:38:12] The the verse N say the hands of Zub
[1:38:15] Zerubbabel have laid the foundation
[1:38:18] of this house. His hands also shall
[1:38:22] finish it.
[1:38:24] And thou shalt know that the Lord of
[1:38:26] hosts hath sent me unto you. For who
[1:38:29] hath despised the day of small things? I
[1:38:32] told y'all there is a lot in here. I
[1:38:34] can't I can't preach all this. Who hath
[1:38:37] despised the day of small things, spirit
[1:38:40] and truth.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; God saw you
[1:38:47] when you started
[1:38:50] in Lantana in the living room. And some
[1:38:53] of y'all come to the living room.
[1:38:55] Hallelujah. Boy, I can I can Lord, I'm
[1:38:59] trying to
[1:39:01] Lord have mercy. Jesus.
[1:39:04] Boy, I can't I can't
[1:39:10] Just forget about it.
[1:39:20] Some of y'all started in the living room
[1:39:21] in Lantana,
[1:39:26] my wife and three daughters.
[1:39:29] And um there we were in our living room
[1:39:32] having service for roughly a year. And I
[1:39:34] remember um I got up one one morning I I
[1:39:39] was speaking to the family and I and I
[1:39:41] told them I I I just it was a prophecy.
[1:39:44] I said, "Don't y'all be surprised if
[1:39:46] people start joining us?"
[1:39:48] And roughly three weeks later,
[1:39:51] uh I got a call from my mother-in-law.
[1:39:54] She was that morning she was preparing
[1:39:57] to go to church and she said, "Are y'all
[1:39:58] having church?" I said, "Yes, ma'am, we
[1:40:01] are." She said, "Can I come?
[1:40:04] I said, "Yes, ma'am. The church is open
[1:40:06] for you to come." And um and she she
[1:40:09] just she come she said, "I'll be right
[1:40:12] there." She come rushing down there from
[1:40:14] from Jock Road to get the Lantana. And
[1:40:17] she got there. But on the day that she
[1:40:19] came, uh Sister Dixon had already told
[1:40:23] me that she was going to make Spirit and
[1:40:24] Truth Tab Tabernacle her her church
[1:40:27] home. And we were meeting in our house.
[1:40:30] Sister Dixon is the first member of
[1:40:32] Spirit and Truth Tabernacle, right? But
[1:40:35] when she comes, she had her son, Brother
[1:40:37] Roy, bring her to church that day. And I
[1:40:40] set up chairs in the living room. We
[1:40:42] already used to have them already set
[1:40:44] up. Set up chairs in the living room.
[1:40:45] And we got three visitors on the first
[1:40:48] time we ever had visitors. Three. Why
[1:40:51] would God send three on the first time?
[1:40:56] Three is a number of perfection. I had
[1:40:59] three daughters
[1:41:03] and these three visitors that showed up
[1:41:05] which but what what would would have
[1:41:07] caused it to be seven of us. Well, is
[1:41:10] that right? Three daughters. No, eight
[1:41:13] of us. Eight of us, which eight eight is
[1:41:14] the number of a new beginning. Okay. So,
[1:41:18] some of you all when we say despise is
[1:41:20] not a day of small things. We started in
[1:41:23] that living room and then my
[1:41:25] mother-in-law uh one day she's driving
[1:41:27] down Lakeworth Road and she said, "You
[1:41:29] know, there's a building over here for
[1:41:30] rent." I say, "Uh,
[1:41:34] that I I said, "Okay, we'll go take a
[1:41:36] look at it." And um we went now the the
[1:41:39] you got to understand my living room is
[1:41:42] free.
[1:41:46] You get that?
[1:41:48] Are we clear on that? My My living room
[1:41:50] is free. So for me to take a step of
[1:41:54] faith and go out somewhere else right
[1:41:56] where I got to pay
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; that that's faith.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; So we she said there's a building over
[1:42:03] here you know a plaza over here y'all
[1:42:05] can probably put a church said well
[1:42:06] we'll come take a look at it and I
[1:42:08] walked in I looked at that plaza I say
[1:42:09] ain't nothing we can do here. My wife
[1:42:11] said no we can do this we can do that we
[1:42:13] can she's a visionary when it come to
[1:42:15] things like that. So anytime I look at
[1:42:16] property, I always take my wife because
[1:42:18] she got a vision for stuff like that.
[1:42:20] And she tell me, she said, "You got to
[1:42:22] look in this. You got to look look in
[1:42:23] here and see nothing in this room and
[1:42:25] then what you can do with the room." I
[1:42:27] can't see nothing.
[1:42:33] God got to have a helpmate there to help
[1:42:35] you, right? So So I thank God for my
[1:42:38] precious wife, right? So she like a
[1:42:42] visionary and things like that. Oh yeah,
[1:42:43] I can do. And so she's starting. That's
[1:42:45] why if you if you went to that church,
[1:42:46] we used to have that that that crown
[1:42:48] molding or whatever it was. Not not
[1:42:49] crown. It was uh uh what do they call
[1:42:51] that thing? Chair chair chair rail. My
[1:42:54] wife want to come up with that. I'mma
[1:42:55] paint this color down here and I'm going
[1:42:56] to put this color. I mean it was looking
[1:42:58] nice and we was in there working on that
[1:43:01] building.
[1:43:03] While we working on the building, Sister
[1:43:05] Michelle called Sister Cobb say, "I need
[1:43:07] to bring you some work. I need to do
[1:43:09] this." She said, "Well, I'm out here in
[1:43:10] in in in Lake Worth doing this and doing
[1:43:13] that." Sister says sister Michelle said,
[1:43:16] "Y'all y'all got a building?"
[1:43:19] She said, "Yeah, we got we got we got a
[1:43:20] building. We're working on it and we we
[1:43:22] we getting ready to start meeting in
[1:43:24] here." And um she said, "Okay, I'm
[1:43:26] coming to bring bring the bring bring
[1:43:28] the bring bring the paperwork." Sister
[1:43:29] Michelle walked into that place.
[1:43:33] She saw the chair sit up and she just
[1:43:35] she just sat down and just let some
[1:43:37] words out of her mouth. She said, "I can
[1:43:39] see myself
[1:43:41] sitting right here."
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; She had Let me tell you something.
[1:43:47] Before you can make a a a a transition,
[1:43:51] you got to see yourself already.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; She said, "I can see myself right here."
[1:43:57] And from that day to this day,
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; with all her trials that she done went
[1:44:02] through, where she sitting at?
[1:44:08] And look, I'm I'm talking about the day.
[1:44:10] I'm talking about despised not the days
[1:44:11] of small things.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; See, some of some of these saints are
[1:44:15] what I call ride or die saints.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; Been been been with us for a long time.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; I remember her daughter uh Somaya when
[1:44:29] she would go to church,
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Somaya could not stop crying. But when
[1:44:35] she came into Spirit and Truth
[1:44:36] Tabernacle, you didn't see that no more.
[1:44:39] Now, some of that she grew up out of,
[1:44:41] but but she was still at the time she
[1:44:43] was doing all that crime, she was still
[1:44:44] in transition.
[1:44:47] I remember I remember I remember I
[1:44:49] remember going to Sister Tina house one
[1:44:50] time during during all this. I got so
[1:44:53] many testimonies, but I remember going
[1:44:54] to Sister Tina house and and uh and and
[1:44:56] and Shereice and Chenise and and Somaya
[1:45:00] and Cesley, all of them. They was with
[1:45:01] Mama and all us at Sister Tina House was
[1:45:03] something. Chenise looked at me and she
[1:45:05] just she just looked,
[1:45:07] "Are you the preacher in the church?"
[1:45:12] And I say, "Yes, I'm the preacher in the
[1:45:14] church." And Chenise, I'm still the
[1:45:17] preacher in the church.
[1:45:22] But I remember I remember I remember
[1:45:25] because at the time before Sister
[1:45:26] Michelle and Sister Tina made their
[1:45:28] decision to come and be a part of Spirit
[1:45:30] and Truth Tabernacle. I remember um uh
[1:45:33] we were going to some meetings in
[1:45:35] Georgia.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And and and I had a car that
[1:45:39] uh I I said y'all could take my car, you
[1:45:41] know, and and and and ride it up there.
[1:45:42] Y'all ain't got to rent no car. So they
[1:45:44] jumped in my car. Sister Michelle,
[1:45:45] Sister Tina, they jumped in the car and
[1:45:47] they they drove on up the road. But when
[1:45:48] they got in the car, all of a sudden
[1:45:50] there was a song on the radio and they
[1:45:52] thought I set them up, but I ain't set
[1:45:54] them up. It just happened to be that
[1:45:55] way. The song simply said this. It
[1:45:58] wasn't easy,
[1:46:02] but it was worth it. Let me tell you
[1:46:03] something. It's not easy to make a
[1:46:05] decision to come, but it's going to be
[1:46:07] worth it.
[1:46:10] Hallelujah.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; It wasn't easy for for some of y'all to
[1:46:14] make that decision.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; But over these years, it's been worth
[1:46:17] it.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; It wasn't easy for me to make the
[1:46:20] decision to step out into ministry, but
[1:46:22] I can I thank God
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; for coming to that decision. It's been
[1:46:28] worth it, y'all.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; I'm out here. Y'all got me way out here.
[1:46:42] Just this week, I was sharing with some
[1:46:47] some um some guys I play golf with
[1:46:52] and um
[1:46:54] telling them about, you know, just my
[1:46:57] calling into ministry.
[1:47:02] I had
[1:47:04] roughly seven different things happen to
[1:47:06] me in my life that that um helped me,
[1:47:11] you know, see that it was it was the
[1:47:13] hand of the Lord that was that was
[1:47:14] pulling me in this direction for
[1:47:15] ministry to start the church.
[1:47:18] One of those was uh I was one day I got
[1:47:21] off work early from work and I don't
[1:47:23] know know why but we were living right
[1:47:26] down the street in u the pines um
[1:47:32] it's a little development there for um
[1:47:34] town homes and the way that the pines
[1:47:36] are set up you have like a town home
[1:47:39] here a group of town homes there group
[1:47:41] of town homes here and a group of town
[1:47:42] homes here and then in the center center
[1:47:44] of it all is where you have the parking
[1:47:48] So, we lived back on this side and then
[1:47:50] there was an older lady lived up on this
[1:47:52] side and I happened to get home early
[1:47:54] this day and and as I was getting out of
[1:47:56] my car, I'm parking over here on my side
[1:47:58] and I get out get out of my car and that
[1:48:00] old lady she used to see me all the time
[1:48:01] and I just wave at him and say hi. But
[1:48:03] she she she says, "Young man, young man,
[1:48:05] that day she saw me, young man, young
[1:48:07] man." I say I said, "Yes, ma'am." I took
[1:48:09] off running over there to see you need
[1:48:11] anything. She said, "Young man, are you
[1:48:13] a minister?"
[1:48:14] I said, "No, ma'am, but I am a
[1:48:17] Christian." She looked at me. She said,
[1:48:25] "Wal in the house and left me standing
[1:48:28] there."
[1:48:32] Now, what would you do if somebody did
[1:48:34] you like that?
[1:48:37] Lord, why would you do me? I mean, what
[1:48:39] what is going on here? I don't even know
[1:48:42] the lady's name. She could barely speak
[1:48:44] English, but she asked me that question
[1:48:47] and and I I'll see her one day on the
[1:48:48] other side. Ma'am, I surrender to my
[1:48:50] calling. Thank you for ask answer asking
[1:48:52] that
[1:48:56] another uh situation. I'm only going to
[1:48:58] give you a couple, but it's it's seven
[1:49:00] that I could give you. Why God do seven
[1:49:05] completion? I'mma give you another one.
[1:49:09] I went to
[1:49:11] get my master's degree
[1:49:14] and my very first class and get my
[1:49:15] master's degree.
[1:49:18] Um
[1:49:19] the teacher that God gave me was a
[1:49:21] retired Lutheran minister and now he's
[1:49:24] teaching in college.
[1:49:27] So,
[1:49:28] you know, when he said that he was a
[1:49:30] retired Lutheran minister, I'm like,
[1:49:31] well, wow, this is really strange. uh my
[1:49:34] first my first uh class in in uh and get
[1:49:38] my master's degree. I got a a preacher
[1:49:40] that's my teacher. I said this is
[1:49:43] strange. So I and you know just let it
[1:49:46] go. So we had a three-week class. It was
[1:49:48] an introductory class and uh and I had
[1:49:51] to everybody had to present on a little
[1:49:54] subject you know uh he wanted to he
[1:49:56] wanted you at the end of three weeks you
[1:49:58] take five minutes and present you know
[1:50:00] before the people before the class. So,
[1:50:02] uh, you know, we had a little subject we
[1:50:04] had to talk about. So, we were finishing
[1:50:06] up a certain part of the class, getting
[1:50:08] ready to go to lunch. He says, "Do y'all
[1:50:09] want to do y'all presentations now or
[1:50:11] y'all want to do them later?" And I was
[1:50:12] so nervous. I'm like, "No, we got to do
[1:50:14] let's do it later. Let's do it later
[1:50:16] after lunch." And the rest of the class
[1:50:18] said, "No, we want to do it now." So,
[1:50:21] the majority won and we all had to do
[1:50:23] our presentations then. Everybody get
[1:50:26] up, do their presentations.
[1:50:28] Well, at the end of the presentation, he
[1:50:31] says, "Well,
[1:50:32] uh, if you'd like, I can give you all
[1:50:35] some feedback now, or I can do it after
[1:50:37] lunch." I say, "After lunch, after
[1:50:39] lunch, please. After lunch. I I don't
[1:50:41] want to hear this criticism coming my
[1:50:43] way cuz I know I just did terrible." He
[1:50:45] said, "So, the rest of the class said,
[1:50:46] "No, we want our criticism or feedback."
[1:50:48] Now, I said, "Oh, Lord, majority don't
[1:50:51] want again."
[1:50:54] He say so and so you did this and so and
[1:50:56] so you did that and so and so if you you
[1:50:58] know you you did this and you did that
[1:51:00] and and he say and Jack I say oh Lord
[1:51:04] here it come. He said Jack you are a
[1:51:08] natural
[1:51:09] information just flow out of your lips.
[1:51:14] I said what
[1:51:16] they said yeah you just seem like you
[1:51:18] was made for this.
[1:51:20] That's man as nervous as I was.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; He says, "Yeah." And I went to lunch.
[1:51:28] It's still kind of with a mind battle. I
[1:51:29] was expecting this man to kind of rake
[1:51:31] me over the coals, but he's encouraging
[1:51:33] me. And I'm like, "Wow, this is this is
[1:51:35] this this I don't I don't I don't see
[1:51:38] this." Well, in that same class that
[1:51:40] day,
[1:51:43] we're sitting there after lunch and
[1:51:46] there is a a gentleman. He was a ret he
[1:51:49] was a a captain in the Marines. His name
[1:51:53] was William Carr.
[1:51:55] And he says uh and I'm talking the same
[1:51:57] day, same class.
[1:52:00] William says, "Jack,"
[1:52:03] I said, "Yes." He say, "Anybody ever
[1:52:06] tell you that you sound like a
[1:52:07] reverend?"
[1:52:11] I say, "Uh, come on, man." I said, "We
[1:52:14] here talking about business, you know."
[1:52:16] So, so, so another young lady was
[1:52:18] sitting there and she heard him say
[1:52:20] that. She said, "Yeah, when you up there
[1:52:22] talking, I ain't know whether to say
[1:52:24] amen or what."
[1:52:31] I say, I said, "Come on, y'all say." All
[1:52:33] right. Thank y'all. Appreciate that. I
[1:52:35] thought it was over.
[1:52:39] Um,
[1:52:40] William say Jack say, "Yeah, yeah, yeah,
[1:52:43] yeah, yeah. What's going on?
[1:52:46] He said, "How old are you?"
[1:52:49] I'm 33.
[1:52:52] Okay,
[1:52:54] Jack.
[1:52:59] There's three questions now. Three
[1:53:02] questions. Three times he calls my name
[1:53:05] now. And I ain't catch this till now.
[1:53:09] How many times did God call Samuel's
[1:53:10] name?
[1:53:14] Right. So this time he asked me his last
[1:53:17] question to me.
[1:53:19] How old was Jesus
[1:53:22] when he died?
[1:53:27] And I knew the answer to that question.
[1:53:29] Jesus had died at 33.
[1:53:33] Now he didn't have to say no more. I can
[1:53:36] read between the lines of what God is
[1:53:38] trying to tell me through this man. It
[1:53:41] was at that point in time that I had to
[1:53:43] die to my own thoughts. I had to die to
[1:53:47] whatever I was feeling and I had to
[1:53:50] surrender to what God wanted from me.
[1:53:57] That's how spirit and truth
[1:53:59] got started.
[1:54:02] And from that day to here, no, we not
[1:54:04] despising their small things. And we
[1:54:06] done moved from we moved from the living
[1:54:08] room to Green Acres on Lakeworth Road.
[1:54:13] Then we moved to Robuck Road. Yeah.
[1:54:16] Y'all know I don't even forgot all that.
[1:54:19] Then we moved to a school for four
[1:54:21] years. And now we back in Green Acres.
[1:54:26] Hallelujah.
[1:54:27] We must be close to something. We must
[1:54:29] be getting ready to strike a main spring
[1:54:32] somewhere here in Green Acres.
[1:54:41] Hallelujah, somebody.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; So, so, so, so I I I don't I don't I
[1:54:50] don't I don't despise the day of small
[1:54:52] things. I'm telling you, God has been
[1:54:55] good. And I can walk many of you all
[1:54:57] through your own testimonies of how you
[1:54:59] got here.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; Everybody got a testimony. And your
[1:55:03] testimony was not brother Jack called me
[1:55:06] and he uh he encouraged me. There's only
[1:55:09] one person in this church that I can say
[1:55:14] I pro uh procelitated.
[1:55:17] No, not my wife.
[1:55:20] God actually showed her
[1:55:22] God showed her dreams before we even got
[1:55:24] started.
[1:55:27] Oh Lord, I can take y'all back. I'm
[1:55:29] telling you, I can tell you God showed
[1:55:30] her dreams of of of she kept going to
[1:55:33] the closet and changing clothes. Kept
[1:55:35] going to the closet, changing clothes.
[1:55:36] And we didn't have we didn't we didn't
[1:55:37] know what what what what this meant. We
[1:55:39] just happened to look up something and
[1:55:40] say, "Well, you know, when you see that
[1:55:42] happening in your dreams, that mean God
[1:55:43] getting ready to change something in
[1:55:44] your life and that was changing us to
[1:55:47] ministry and we had to surrender to
[1:55:49] ministry, right?" And and she she I
[1:55:51] remember God giving her those dreams and
[1:55:52] and and she knew at that time because of
[1:55:54] all the changes that was going on around
[1:55:56] us, she knew that we had to make a make
[1:55:58] a change. She's like, she's like, "What
[1:55:59] we going to do? What we going to do?" I
[1:56:00] said, "We're going to start a church."
[1:56:02] She said, "What we going to name the
[1:56:03] church?" We said, "We going." I said,
[1:56:04] "The name of the church is Spirit and
[1:56:06] Truth Tabernacle." God had given me the
[1:56:08] name of the church two years before I
[1:56:10] even told my wife. I didn't tell nobody.
[1:56:13] I was still faithfully going to church
[1:56:15] and serving in my capacity as song
[1:56:17] leader and whatever else, whatever else
[1:56:19] before I did anything. Look, I didn't
[1:56:22] This ain't no overnight thing.
[1:56:27] This ain't overnight. This is This ain't
[1:56:30] something that rose up. Somebody had
[1:56:31] some idea and just jumped out there. No.
[1:56:33] No. That ain't that. That's not what
[1:56:34] this is. I had to struggle
[1:56:38] because when you struggle through
[1:56:39] something, you know what it does? It
[1:56:40] produces character.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; So, I thank God for the journey.
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; But there's only one person that I
[1:56:49] prolighted.
[1:56:52] Quinton Jr.
[1:56:55] I actually went to him. We were we were
[1:56:58] in we were in um London visiting brother
[1:57:04] Gwena.
[1:57:06] Sister Gwenna happened to be here today.
[1:57:07] But we were in London. I told him and
[1:57:09] his sister, "Y'all ought to pray about
[1:57:11] coming to West Palm Beach."
[1:57:13] I'm still working on Sarah, but
[1:57:19] but Brother Quinton was there in in
[1:57:20] Georgia and he and he prayed about it
[1:57:22] and he's here and he has been a blessing
[1:57:28] ever since he's been here.
[1:57:32] But other than that, I ain't proited
[1:57:34] nobody. And and I and I also tell my
[1:57:37] tell the church, don't you procelite
[1:57:38] nobody. Let people come to their own
[1:57:41] decision. let them pray about it and
[1:57:44] decide what they want to do and let God
[1:57:46] bless them. I all I know is that it it
[1:57:48] wasn't easy,
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; but it's been worth it.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm way way away from my notes, and
[1:57:56] ain't no sense of me trying to go back
[1:57:58] cuz I I I I I I I
[1:58:01] know what I wanted to say, and it'll
[1:58:03] take me a little time. So, that means
[1:58:04] I'm going to have to keep going. I'll
[1:58:06] pick it up somewhere along the line.
[1:58:09] Now, let me just mention this. We are
[1:58:11] we're we're we're changing a little bit
[1:58:13] next year.
[1:58:15] Um
[1:58:17] we've been on this journey of I will
[1:58:18] restore sayith the Lord and restoration
[1:58:20] is something that you can just never
[1:58:22] stop preaching. It it it keeps unfolding
[1:58:25] to me. It keeps unfolding. So you you
[1:58:27] probably still going to hear some
[1:58:28] sermons about restoration next year. I'm
[1:58:30] going tell you that. But the Lord has
[1:58:33] already laid on my heart to uh with a
[1:58:37] different inspiration. I'm telling you
[1:58:38] ahead of time. Usually I would save it
[1:58:40] for the first of the year. Uh but I'll
[1:58:43] go ahead and release it now as the least
[1:58:44] the inspiration you'll know because um
[1:58:47] it's connected to a lot of things. But
[1:58:49] the inspiration that God has given me
[1:58:51] for next year is um preparation
[1:58:55] for a manifestation.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; Preparation for a manifestation.
[1:59:03] Amen. Now, I'll just leave it there
[1:59:05] because there's going to be so much tied
[1:59:06] to that. Lord, let me get out of here.
[1:59:10] Um,
[1:59:11] I'll just finish reading Zechariah.
[1:59:13] That'll be the last thing I do, okay?
[1:59:14] Because I didn't finish it. But
[1:59:18] the hands of the Rubel have laid, verse
[1:59:20] 9, have laid the foundation of this
[1:59:23] house. His hand shall also finish it.
[1:59:26] And thou shalt know that the Lord of
[1:59:28] hosts hath sent me unto you. For who
[1:59:31] have despised
[1:59:34] the day of small things? I'm telling
[1:59:36] y'all, I'm I'mma just tell y'all, Spirit
[1:59:39] and Truth Tabernacle, I appreciate you
[1:59:42] all. I love you all. I thank God for you
[1:59:46] all.
[1:59:48] Some of y'all was willing to
[1:59:51] jump
[1:59:53] on the wagon while we pushing it up the
[1:59:57] hill.
[2:00:01] But there's going to come a time that
[2:00:03] that wagon
[2:00:05] is going to go
[2:00:07] down the hill
[2:00:10] and it's when you going downhill ain't
[2:00:12] no pushing no more.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; It it's that's that's when it becomes a
[2:00:16] plane, sis. It's you're going down the
[2:00:18] hill and you know what happened when
[2:00:19] when things go down the hill? A lot of
[2:00:21] folk
[2:00:23] want to jump on.
[2:00:25] But I want to thank you for jumping on
[2:00:27] while we were pushing it
[2:00:29] up the hill.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; And if you don't believe it's going to
[2:00:34] go downhill, watch
[2:00:36] and see.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:41] Thank you for not despising the days of
[2:00:44] small things. Thank you for coming to
[2:00:45] the house when we was in the house.
[2:00:48] Thank you for coming to the storefront
[2:00:51] on Lakew Worth Road. Thank you for
[2:00:54] coming to Robuck Road.
[2:00:56] Thank you for going to a school.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; Thank you for coming to a shared
[2:01:02] facility.
[2:01:05] You have not despised the days of small
[2:01:09] things. Thank you so much.
[2:01:12] See, this is why you can you can you can
[2:01:15] you can work with people and serve
[2:01:16] people that have that type of heart that
[2:01:18] are that are that'll join you like that.
[2:01:20] That's how it's so easy to be united as
[2:01:23] as one.
[2:01:25] Thank you. That's all I can say is thank
[2:01:26] you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I
[2:01:28] appreciate you all. I love you all.
[2:01:30] Thank you
[2:01:33] who have despised the day of small
[2:01:35] things
[2:01:37] for they shall
[2:01:41] rejoice
[2:01:43] and shall see the appointment in the
[2:01:45] hand of Zerubbabel
[2:01:47] with those seven.
[2:01:49] They are the eyes of the Lord which run
[2:01:51] to and fro throughout the whole earth.
[2:01:55] Then answered I and said unto him, What
[2:01:57] are these two olive trees upon the right
[2:01:59] side of the candlestick and upon the
[2:02:00] left side thereof? And I answered again
[2:02:02] and said unto him, What be these two
[2:02:04] olive breaches uh which which through
[2:02:07] the two golden pipes empty the golden
[2:02:09] oil out of themselves?
[2:02:12] And he answered and said,
[2:02:14] "Knowest thou not what these be?" And I
[2:02:16] said, "No, my lord." Then said he, "The
[2:02:19] are these are the two anointed ones that
[2:02:21] stand by the Lord of the whole earth."
[2:02:24] Brother Random, you know, goes on to
[2:02:26] tell us, and I said a prophet would have
[2:02:28] to tell you what these things mean, but
[2:02:29] and I don't have time to read it all.
[2:02:30] I'm going just let it go, but I'll tell
[2:02:32] you this. Brother Random said, "Those
[2:02:33] two olive trees was the Old Testament
[2:02:37] and the New Testament." And uh he he he
[2:02:40] made a a a statement about um the way
[2:02:45] that that oil was was just um
[2:02:49] poured in. You know, it was a it was a
[2:02:52] candlestick that they were talking about
[2:02:54] there. And uh and the candlestick had
[2:02:56] the light at the top of it. It says,
[2:02:58] "But what happened the you never had to
[2:03:00] necessarily light the the the lamp on
[2:03:02] the top. You just pour oil into it and
[2:03:04] then the oil went up through the wicks
[2:03:07] and that's what brought the light." And
[2:03:08] the way that you kept the light burning
[2:03:10] is that you just kept pouring oil in. If
[2:03:14] you want to keep your lights burning,
[2:03:16] keep your fire burning bright and clear.
[2:03:20] Huh? Something like that. If you want to
[2:03:22] keep that fire burning out of control,
[2:03:24] we got to keep putting the oil inside
[2:03:26] the lamp.
[2:03:28] And the oil represent
[2:03:30] the Holy Ghost.
[2:03:33] Once you get the Holy Ghost, things
[2:03:35] change from the inside
[2:03:38] out.
[2:03:40] Church, God bless you. I'm done for the
[2:03:43] day. I have to just stop right there.
[2:03:49] You get up here sometime and you got
[2:03:51] your plan,
[2:03:52] but God be having another plan. Um, God
[2:03:57] knows all things. Let's pray. I had the
[2:03:59] musicians come. Amen. and um we'll
[2:04:02] prepare to just turn the service back
[2:04:04] over to brother Solomon. Father, we
[2:04:05] thank you, Lord Jesus, for
[2:04:11] just your word. And God, uh just this
[2:04:14] little trip down memory lane
[2:04:17] as I was reading the scripture, I I
[2:04:19] didn't see that didn't come to me like
[2:04:21] that.
[2:04:23] But Lord, you get here in the pull pit
[2:04:25] and and um you you begin to just take us
[2:04:27] on a journey. And and I just thank you,
[2:04:30] Father, for the journey. I thank you for
[2:04:34] every
[2:04:36] saint, every family, every person, God,
[2:04:40] that has been a part of this journey
[2:04:42] with us.
[2:04:44] My I appreciate them. I love them. I I
[2:04:49] care for them all.
[2:04:51] I'm grateful, Lord, that you have
[2:04:53] assigned us all together to work
[2:04:55] together for the cause of Christ. And I
[2:04:59] pray, Father, that you would just
[2:05:00] continue to anoint us. And and Lord, you
[2:05:02] you told us here in the word that we did
[2:05:04] not despise the day of small beginnings.
[2:05:08] You told us that we would rejoice.
[2:05:11] So, I'm looking for that, God, that uh
[2:05:14] you you you've seen our journey. You've
[2:05:16] seen where we've where we've come from.
[2:05:18] You also know where we're going. Why?
[2:05:20] Because you said in your word, I know
[2:05:24] the thoughts
[2:05:26] that I have towards you. I know these
[2:05:29] plans. I I already know that you might
[2:05:31] not know it, but I know it. God, all you
[2:05:34] ask us to do is just keep walking by
[2:05:36] faith and not by sight. And Lord, as we
[2:05:39] press,
[2:05:41] God, you'll bring us right to where we
[2:05:43] need to be.
[2:05:45] So, Father, I just pray your blessings
[2:05:47] upon uh each family. I pray your
[2:05:51] blessings upon each person. Bless them
[2:05:54] during this holiday season. May you keep
[2:05:56] us, Lord. Bless our families as we
[2:05:58] gather together with uh loved ones.
[2:06:01] Thank you for the different ones that
[2:06:02] have come, Father. And we got many that
[2:06:04] are traveling, Lord. Sister Tina being
[2:06:07] away there. And we know that uh Sister
[2:06:10] Rachel is reaching that point, Father,
[2:06:12] where patience will come. We ask that
[2:06:15] you watch over Sister Rachel. God, um,
[2:06:19] Brother Steven, you know how important
[2:06:21] this is to them. We just thank you for
[2:06:23] bringing it this far in the in the
[2:06:25] pregnancy and and we believe, Lord, that
[2:06:27] it will it will come to a conclusion
[2:06:30] and, Father, patience will be on the
[2:06:33] other side. So, Father, we pray, Lord,
[2:06:35] that you would just look upon her and as
[2:06:37] me and my wife, daughter, uh, Brother

[2:06:55] especially brother Quincy as he's
[2:06:57] preparing for surgery. God, I pray that
[2:06:59] you would look upon him and that you
[2:07:01] would touch him. And Lord, even may this
[2:07:03] be a time that restoration would come to
[2:07:06] him as well. Lord, we uh we trust, oh

[2:11:31] Hallelujah.
[2:11:35] Hallelujah.
[2:11:37] Let's bow our heads.
[2:11:39] Almighty God, Father, we thank you for
[2:11:42] your truth.
[2:11:44] We thank you, Lord Jesus, that you
[2:11:47] changed our pastor sermon, Lord, just to
[2:11:49] remind us not to despise the days of
[2:11:52] small things. We can all look back in
[2:11:55] our lives, Lord, and saw how you brought
[2:11:57] us from there to where we are. how you
[2:12:00] changed the course of our lives, Lord,
[2:12:02] when we were going the wrong way,
[2:12:04] Father. How you brought us to this
[2:12:06] faith, Lord Jesus. Father, we want to
[2:12:09] tell you thank you, Lord. Thank you for
[2:12:12] loving us so much, Lord God, that as you
[2:12:15] were making preparations for us. You
[2:12:17] were preparing a pastor, Lord Jesus,
[2:12:20] that will feed us, Lord. You you brought
[2:12:22] them through different trials and tests,
[2:12:24] Lord, to be the right kind of pastor
[2:12:27] that we need. And father, we're grateful
[2:12:29] for that. We're we're so grateful for
[2:12:31] the balance, Lord Jesus. And it's hard
[2:12:34] for people to stay balanced. We've seen
[2:12:36] it throughout the message where people
[2:12:38] would go off on a limb and Lord, so many
[2:12:40] would go into fanaticism, Lord, but to
[2:12:42] to remain balanced, Lord Jesus. We're so
[2:12:45] grateful for that. And Father, we're
[2:12:47] grateful, Lord, for this place that
[2:12:49] you've given us to worship in. And Lord,
[2:12:51] I know it's not our home, Lord Jesus.
[2:12:53] was just seeing a few weeks ago when
[2:12:55] brother Quu was preaching. Lord, how he
[2:12:58] had to skip over these notes and these
[2:13:00] scriptures and these quotes. Lord, we
[2:13:02] need the time, Lord, to worship you,
[2:13:04] Lord, the way that you deserve to be
[2:13:06] worshiped. Lord, we don't want to just
[2:13:09] sing one song at the end, Lord God. We
[2:13:11] want to water, Lord, the word that we've
[2:13:13] heard, Lord, that it may bring forth
[2:13:16] much fruit. So, Father, we know, Lord
[2:13:19] God, that you have a place for us to
[2:13:21] worship and we're looking for that time.
[2:13:24] But until that time comes, Lord, we want
[2:13:26] to remain faithful, Lord Jesus. Standing
[2:13:28] at our post of duty, Lord, pushing this
[2:13:31] thing up the hill, Lord Jesus. Lord, for
[2:13:33] there's coming a time, Lord, when the
[2:13:35] momentum is going to carry us, Lord
[2:13:37] Jesus. So, Father, we pray, Lord God,
[2:13:39] again, for our pastor. Give him the
[2:13:41] strength that he needs, Lord, that he he
[2:13:44] gave out this morning. But give him the
[2:13:46] strength, Lord, Lord, to go and be all
[2:13:49] that you would have him to need be in
[2:13:50] Ghana. Lord, be with the saints, each
[2:13:52] one. Bless your people, Lord, as we
[2:13:55] prepare to leave this place. Lord, bring
[2:13:57] us all back at the appointed time. Lord,
[2:13:59] we'll be careful to give you the praise,
[2:14:01] the honor, and glory. It's in Jesus
[2:14:03] Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. God
[2:14:07] bless you saints. Our brothers to come
[2:14:09] at this time and dismiss you.
[2:14:16] The Lord has done. I will never
[2:14:23] go back
[2:14:25] anymore.
[2:14:29] When I
[2:14:31] when I remember
