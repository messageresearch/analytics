that's special praise the lord we're going to ask our pastor to come because songs just rolling through my mind we got to hear the word praise the lord amen i certainly appreciate all the all the worship uh the presence of the lord is here and uh i'm happy to be in fellowship this morning just a couple things uh that we want to get done before um we get into the word of the lord uh let me just get the announcements really quick uh we got a birthday coming up on tuesday brother smiley celebrating another year we thank the lord for blessing them man to see another year god bless you brother smiling amen and uh sisters we will have the virtual prayer that'll be done on this tuesday night at 7 30 p.m so if you have not been linked in and you'd like to get linked in just see sister erica uh as i mentioned before even if you say well i don't really like to pray out loud sometimes good just to hear other people pray you can get blessed just by listening to other people praying and then eventually you get to the point where i want to pray too all right so just just just stay connected amen prayer is our most powerful weapon that we have and uh don't let the devil steal that weapon from you praise the lord so uh so prayer has been keeping this church you know just thinking um you know for this last couple of weeks we decided to have uh this two weeks of prayer and um and as of this morning it would have been our 14th prayer right and uh and i think there's something special about that that 14 because uh we know that you know the children of israel they walked around the walls of jericho uh it would have been they marched what six times and then on the on the seventh day seven times that was the 13 there and walls came down this morning we got to this 14th prayer there was an anointing in this place good god almighty and and i and i and i felt that anointing just kind of coming into the song service and and i was sitting there in the corner i'd say man i'd love to get a little piece of that one bro and i but i didn't want to you know i didn't want to you know i know as pastor i could have just walked up i just waiting for brother saw him just give me a little something bro just when he handed yes god's got a blessing with my name on it man i see you know you know sometimes nowadays they got technology that allows you to know that mail is coming to your house before you even get it you know it's coming they send you an email they tell you it's coming praise god and sometimes you can look to see where it's coming from brother i got i got an update i got an alert praised god amen mail is coming to me god's got a blessing with my name on it i ain't gotta wait till i get it before i shout i can shout now glory to god [Music] god's got a healing with your name on him god got a deliverance with your name on it god's got a church in school with your name on it [Music] my god oh jesus oh i feel good i feel good i feel good i'm gonna try to get the preacher out here real soon [Music] oh my god my god [Music] amen um so if you all please just get connected stay connected in prayer this is a very very important season for us uh virtual service as i mentioned we've been mentioning for the past week those that are streaming online after today the stream will go offline and we will pick it back up september 1st um a few weeks from now to be a wednesday night we'll have the stream again going on september 1st so just keep that in mind amen um also our giving we have multiple ways that you can give you can give through cash app you can give through paypal or you can just mail an offering in so those i forgot to say this last night those that are in the house of the lord and you want to give there is a wooden box wooden box on the table there you can just put your offering in that wooden box as you enter or as you exit amen so keep that in mind but those that i want to give through paypal just use a for giving to a friend or family member and use the email address of giving at john423.org if you want to use cash app just use dollar sign spirit and truth t and we will be able to receive it from there if you want to just mail something in the address has changed for you to mail your offerings in it's a new address spirit and truth tabernacle p.o box 222462 west palm beach florida three three four two two so keep that in mind and uh for some reason i think it's something else that i'm supposed to say oh um fellowship to to this afternoon after service we'll be going there to brother troy and sister tonya's home the home that the lord has blessed him with and brother troy celebrated her birthday on yesterday we thank god for giving him another year and then a precious deacon and so after service day they have invited the church to come over for some fellowship and we're looking forward to that amen after service but they did ask that we would carpool and that we would um that would just kind of save too many cars being there so if you can just kind of join up with somebody to ride over there we won't have to overload their neighbors with all of our cars so if you could do that that would be greatly greatly appreciated immediately following the service today amen i don't need to just meet with the church and also i just want to we want to do a couple things but one of the important things i want to do is uh is we're going to take a church picture amen a church photo uh so we're gonna have everybody come up and get all lined up and brother solomon just naomi they'll get us all set up and we're gonna do a a nice church picture so please stick around please be in place amen so we're not looking for everybody but we want to do that following the service today amen let's pray over our giving and um we'll go forward father we thank you for this time that we have to be able to give and trust that you would use it for the furtherance of your kingdom thank you for meeting every need of this church and thank you for meeting the needs of your people thank you for doing the exceedingly abundant above all we can ask a thing thank you for your anointedness in this place today and trust oh god that you would just get the glory out of the word that would come forth to our hearts uh we accept you and use your servant once more shall use them last night be glorified and magnified in jesus name

number of years um and um you know we just we just we just go back and just just say just some precious moments precious memories um you know brother caleb was the one before when we i was telling him this on yesterday i said um when it came to the other church that we were at in green acres because green acres is the place to be and we were there worshiping and you know just a few of us just a few of us i want to say 30 maybe something like that and um our rent was about eighteen hundred dollars a month with them thirty people and so i knew that this space had become available driven by here like man it's a bus that used to be outside and where are you at they're not there i said that place is available so i said we'd come and start entertaining you know just talking with the uh the landlord and they wanted 3 500 a month for it and i was saying from 18 to 35 i'm getting a double with 30 people i said lord i don't know about this it's just going to be tough i don't know god i don't want to put the people at pressure i don't want to come and ask for an extra offering lock the doors you can't go out till we get the money you know what i'm saying hold the people hostage i didn't want to do that so i was just really praying and seeking the lord and just really not sure which way to go so brother brother caleb coming he preaching on the inspiration he said brother jack the lord said you leaned in in a particular direction says go he'll be with you and uh he says go forward in that direction he'll be with you and i just broke down crying i say lord i'm gonna take you at your word and 13 years ago we entered into a lease for this place and god met that 3 500 a month for 30 13 years 13 years and we're not a big group of people i mean you all have been faithful in your giving and i am so appreciative of it very very appreciative of it so uh the lord used him at that time and and uh and i just remember it so it's been i want to say eight years because eight is a good number but it's been eight years i believe since brother caleb has been here and uh and we're excited to have him i know the lord would use him he used him last night to speak to us and i believe today he'll speak to us again let's stand to our feet let's welcome our precious brother to the pulpit amen on this morning lord i want to love you more than i ever have before every hand lifted every

psychic convention next door at the same time that we were having service and i thought i wonder what kind of vibrations they're feeling right now and i started going like that and you could tell things got real quiet over there i said everybody put up your hands and just in faith just push it back and they were doing like that and i don't know what happened but they ended their little session early and i think that our our faith kind of interfered with their little signal so it was kind of funny you know but it started off as a joke and i said no seriously i wonder what they can feel right now we we know where our power comes from amen amen amen we don't got to work it up it just flows is that right it just flows amen in tucson i've been accused of being a cheerleader or a mic boy and working people up and i go you know when it's in you you ain't got to work nobody up you know just because i say say amen i said i guess i guess you take all the pages of the psalms out where david says praise the lord praise the lord praise the lord praise the lord praise the lord if you don't like me saying say amen say amen well you know what i tell them say amen i won't have to ask you [Applause] right come to church awake and i won't have to ask you to say amen right come in here and praise the lord and the tongue leader won't have to tell you come on somebody praise the lord come on somebody praise the lord he shouldn't have to ask you that anyway you should be here praising god you should walk in praising god and you should walk out praising god you should be in your car praising god you should drive down here praising god i flew down here praising god come on amen god bless you i was telling brother jack i said as a testimony i said you know last year in 2020 and if you don't mind i'm just warming up and uh last year in 2020 we had the uh second driest monsoon season uh in arizona history and you might say well it's arizona what do you expect well we expect rain at least once in a while and we got during the monsoon season it rained one time and it wasn't even significant and so we were it's the west is still in drought uh people think because it rains they're not in drought anymore but water levels is what tells you if you're in drought and it's a lot of little things that were going on and i told the church it's not going to get any better um and it that was 2020 and then uh but in january the lord had put on my heart i i usually uh what we call uh what i call make uh uh beginning of the year uh prophetic statements whatever the lord shows me i concentrate myself the day before new year's and then on new year's i let the lord show me what we're going to expect and then i'll get up in the church and i'll tell everybody we're going to see this this this this and i'm not saying that to brag on myself but if my name was brother branham you all would have no problem with me saying any of this right right i mean i could show you a tape where he said god showed me god told me god said god said if you got a problem with me saying god said then you don't know the same god i know because the bible said tell them i said tell them i said tell them i said tell them i said right all through the scriptures come on to the man prophesied tell them thus say the lord i said i said i said i said huh all right so anyhow well now we got that settled uh in 2020 when when this pandemic thing started the lord had given me some some words of uh prophecy see how we do that the lord gave me a little thought we we backpedal even after we just talk about it god told me to say these things now and so i i got up on january the 5th and i told the church the lord told me personally not to leave the country he told me not to get on a plane i don't know about the rest of you but y'all do what you want he said don't get on the plane don't leave the country i see the borders closed and i don't know why this is before this all happened now brother jesse i got a witness this morning amen i think your wife ducked out before i could say anything and uh and anyhow and and so they said uh and i said uh i saw i see people dying in record numbers and i don't know why i said i'm telling you to be careful uh uh watch yourselves and whatever you get involved in i see the mexican border closed the canadian border closed and the people are sitting there this is january the 5th now go back in your history none of this had happened yet and i sat there and i said now this is does say at the lord we're going to see it happen here here here here here and here and that's in the meantime hold tight i know it's not a great one uh we want to hear good things and the lord said prosperity and you're going to get more money matter of fact come drop your money down here and i'll step all over it and and you all will be you know and i'm like the only guy who gets prosperous is you the person stepping all over it you know what i would have done i had to put my money down as soon as he stepped and i said thank you brother it's blessed now that's that brother a reverend dollar that's his name why are you going to trust any preacher last name dollar i'm just saying was that his first name his last name dollar bill is that what it is reverend dollar bill never mind never mind first name's benjamin or something like this i don't know anyhow he was stepping all over the money you know come on up here i'll step right here to be blessed i said he didn't say nothing about leaving it there i was watching as i go there those people are ignorant i just said step on it and take it back i might have grabbed a few more he's right i got i put down a 50 and look what i got i could have you know i could have prophesied something like that but i'd be saying something that wasn't right you know and and i i get a reputation of being a doomsday uh doomsday profit total thing because i'm always saying things that are bad and i go no that's the only thing you all listen to i've said things that are good too but you all don't listen but they don't want to listen anyhow so we watched those things unfold within months within weeks we saw it unfold and then the uh one morning i was uh preaching i stopped in the middle of it i said the olympics are canceled that's that and i just kept on going well i had what they call fact checkers in the church they started looking it up and they're like it's not canceled yet but two days later they got canceled and uh they weren't doing it to doubt me they were doing it to say well did he get you know just want to make sure no one could accuse me of having it i saw it on the news or whatever i said i didn't see nothing i was in the middle of preaching i see the olympics are cancelled all right let's go on and i just kept on preaching two days later it was done i'm telling you to tell you this that we watch these things progress and god has blessed me that way i don't know why he chooses to do that i'm not trying to be somebody but brother jesus said these things that i do shall you do in my name so you cast out devils etc etc brother branham said that over and over and over again to vindicate his own ministry and i'm going to just tell you jesus said greater things shall you do in my name and and i'm just saying if we're not that people then tell me where they are i mean people pentecostal people got no no problem listening to these vague prophecies they get up there and say i see uh something with a something with a arizona alaska and arc uh uh arkansas are gonna be blessed how anybody can say that th this this city's going to be blessed how anybody can say that but give me something that's specific and the bride has thus said the lord and she keeps quiet is that right so we watched as things progress and i and i told the church that we were going to have it was going to be dry and it sure was and and then at the beginning of 2021 i got up and told the church this is going to be the wettest monsoon we've seen in a long time and then a few days later they started predicting that it was going to be just as dry as last year and i actually told the church like well that confuses me because that's not what the lord told me so we went to praying and i kept getting these thoughts there will not be no rain or dew from heaven till i call for it and i got confused i said are you telling me to call for it are you going to call for it what are you saying so it wasn't so we all got collected on this and so here's the thing we're not going to pray for rain we're going to speak rain now you all get brother stephen go ahead brother stephen told me last night he said it rains here all the time sister erica said we get eight inches in a day and i'm like well well lottie dottie you i'm from the desert now all right i'm from the desert and so we actually have to put some faith towards our reign and then i got funny and i said you keep it up and i'll take that reign from you right now i think i heard what i'm gonna say please do you know you don't want that man you know what you see how fast everything just dries up so uh we all got together on it and i said okay here's what we're going to do from this day on we're all going to begin to say it's going to rain today it's going to rain today we did that for 14 days straight all right i heard you 14 days straight and on the 14th day it rained and then it rained again and it rained again and it rained again and now they're saying it's not going to stop we don't even know where this came from [Music] i want to go down and say you're welcome you're welcome if they knew that there was a portion of bride in tucson that could call for rain data called me up in 2020. now that's not bragging brother but do you have the right to do that we have that right to do it we're at the end time and if you can't call for rain i'm sorry for you if you can't stop it i'm sorry for you but we have the power in tucson and arizona to bring it to stop it to dry it how much do you want amen so july went down in history as the wettest july in arizona history and we we just come to church all puffed up you know man because we know that god hurt us and so brother jesse decides to bring it up a notch and he says well if we can call for rain i said here we go i'm just asking pastor i mean i don't want to see anything out of turn i said go ahead what do you want to do he said well if we can call for rain why can't we make the lord come back look how quiet y'all got wait a minute now hold on a minute now see that that's what i understand why did i get an amen out of that huh all right why can't we ask not ask why can't we speak for the lord to come back so we have now begun to say every morning when we wake up today is the day of the lord's return so your body begins to change you're welcome when you're when your arthritis is not so rightist anymore you're welcome [Applause] the bride knows who she is brother smiley when you wake up and you got to just put a little brush to that fade all of a sudden you're welcome my brother hears you amen when all of a sudden you're like uh brother caleb said i was young but man i i need to go to the store my clothes are too big and i'm why am i standing so straight you're welcome because somebody is going to believe this word somewhere you know now now i don't got to get no credit and i don't want any god gets all the glory i hope we all understand that but however somebody is going to believe god's word somebody is going to quit talking about what the prophet did [Music] someone is going to quit bragging on brother branham they've got to stop bragging on brother branham and start to glorify the god that was in brother branham and realize that that same god is inside of you [Music] [Applause] amen [Applause] and then someone's going to get the idea hey i can do that same thing too what do you think brother brown would do if he came back right now so now caleb sit down now that's not no you think he'd be coming come on man come on that's right that's right why because we got quote after quote we said only believe you pray you ask you say it don't look at me now you preachers you go out you go out you go out you ministers i got confidence in them you go find one of these pastors you these holy men brother branham was saying that now we're being told not to listen to preachers i'd love to be a fly on the wall when that conversation takes place when his daddy you know what i'm saying when his dad comes back in the resurrection and says come here i need to talk to you when did i ever say to tell people not to listen to pastors or preachers look there's going to be some answers now but i believe there's still grace during that hour it'll be all right everybody calm down i'm not preaching against nobody i want to say listen it's time for us to be manifested sons and daughters of god this is the hour amen so that being said it's been raining at home and i'm kind of sad that i'm missing it but i'm glad to know when i go back it'll still be raining and uh we've heard only a few people complaining you know on the street and i just turn around and say can you politely shut up you know we don't need any more negativity you got too much too many people talking now i'm going to try and show you something here we didn't ask for it we did not pray for it we spoke it all right my younger brother works in concrete business and he called me up and i said hello and he goes hey and i go yes sir he goes can you all can stop that praying now god heard you all right because i can't work when you're praying i said we're talking about i was praying for rain all the time i got to work and i laughed and i said well i'd be glad to help you but we didn't pray and he goes what do you mean i said we didn't pray he goes well what'd you do i said we spoke it and god heard it and it brought it to pass and he goes whatever you did stop it he was he was joking you know but but it's nice to know that they know where it came from god gets all the glory i hope you understand what i'm saying see say if it had been you would you be brave enough to talk about it this is going to go all over the world everybody talking about this guy thinks he can call for rain well then you try it you don't think i can why don't you try it and then when god does tell me what happens i i'm just saying we got on the plane and we're on our way down and because of this tropical storm that was coming in and i was looking over and i could see the thunder and the lightning and so forth and and i hardly ever hear this announcement but they made this announcement buckle up we hear that uh please don't get up cabin crew stay seated we've heard that but then they made the statement we are expecting extreme turbulence if the oxygen mask falls do not use them it's just a turbulence i said well i don't hear that all the time that kind of makes you a little nervous the little old lady next to me in the middle she just grabbed the the rails like that and i i guess i didn't mean to say it you know quiet or loud i just turn around i go there'll be no turbulence and she looked at me and i just sat back and for the next 30 minutes smooth flying all the way down all the way down it and i i like how that just got kicked up right when i said that they're following the anointing they don't even know it bless your hearts you're cheering us on i love it i feel like i'm in a marching band like onward christian soldiers right we ain't gonna say none and uh anyway uh i had asked the lord for a sign that showed me that he was with me on this trip and then i in my heart i said was that my sign he said do you need another one i said no that'll do but the little lady next to him she goes now i don't know how you did that but that's a pretty good trick i said all i did was speak it and she goes okay and the brother i said i i'll say was spoke it and i prayed because i didn't think she'd understand that so i said i spoke it i prayed and the guy next to her goes well you prayed pretty good because he answered you and the person in the front goes i know that's right so i apparently i had an audience and they wanted to make sure that whatever i said was going to be followed through and they'd follow through now now i can push my luck if you want to say it or the grace with if you want can i say another one i went to the ocean the other day and enjoyed that and all these waves were coming at me coming at me and i just you go try it if you watching if you don't believe it you don't believe it but don't make fun of it this huge wave was coming in like this and and they were standing there with a baby like that i said no no no that way and it got calm and it went and i just smiled and said i'm gonna do that again and i looked over at uh brother jesse it's kind of i don't know what he was doing with his shoes or something his sister doss looked to me and i go did you see that shirt yeah i saw watch this and i went like this and it just did i do it did it do it and the water immediately dissipated and then i went that's right and when i turned my back poof oh man i said well i wasn't watching that time now brother i'm i'm we're joking around but this is serious stuff i did it about four or five more times just to see if like is this me am i losing my mind or did this really happen no i'm like okay i'm not gonna say nothing this time i got hit pretty good i said all right so i stood back and here he comes again i said stop and he just went i said all right so listen either you're going to believe it or you're not right i i've had enough to hear with it now we we are we are gentile bride people now i'm getting all warmed up see we are gentile thank you my brother god bless you uh uh we are gentile bride and we are a people that are supposed to have the spoken word do we have it or not amen let's stand and read the scripture then now we're ready you're gonna end those look at how look at that let's hurry up before they start up again give me uh genesis chapter 22 verse 15 through 18. and you know this very well but you're going to see the point this morning by god's grace now that ocean thing that actually caught my attention because i'm sitting there going there is no way that that water needs to stop not with all that weight behind it who am i and i actually turned around i told the brother and his wife i said who am i that god would do that who am i and i said and i even stood back in in my own they went on to have fun with their baby and everything i just stood back and i was watching the ocean like i said now look how small i am i said why would god allow that with all that weight behind the atlantic ocean what or the gulf where we had atlantic i said why would he allow that i said no there's got to be something greater in here that we don't understand how many understand is that amen all right let's get down to it 22 verse 18 and the bi uh verse 15 and the angel of the lord called unto abraham out of heaven the second time i love it and he said by myself i have sworn have i sworn saith the lord for because thou has done this thing and has not withheld my uh thy son thine only son 18 he says that in blessing oh 17 sorry that in blessing i will bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as a sand which is a which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies and in thy seat shall i all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou has obeyed my voice amen let's pray father we love you ask you to bless us uh this service lord bless this spiritual food we're about to partake of would you be a a part of every aspect lord you know that if it might sound like bragging lord i hope you understand that i'm bragging on you not on me i by myself could not stop a wave i by myself cannot call for rain i by myself could never say that turbulence would not strike but the anointing that is inside my life the the spirit that is inside my heart that which i yield to you o god are the ability you are the only one without you i am nothing and i know that i believe that lord so this morning as you have showed me over and over how nothing i am now bring to something that is inside my heart and serve the somebodies that are in this room lord and online may they all be blessed and may they all grow in faith not have faith in brother caleb but have faith with the god in the god that is in them and may they realize that they can speak the word too in jesus christ's name amen amen amen god bless you may be seated a very interesting portion of course i assume that all of you know your bible so i don't go back and read the history and all that i assume you all know exactly what he's talking about is that right i want you to understand here that this is not the first time that abraham was told he was going to be told he was going to bless be blessed this is not the first time nor the second time this is the third time when he tells him i need to talk to you and he tells him this he'd already promised him that he would bless him come on somebody help me now he'd already promised abraham that he would bless him he already said he was going to multiply a seed he already said look up until see the stars etc etc this is before he said that before he ever had a son in the first place right and then he has ishmael and he tells him yet again i'm going to bless you and then he comes along and he sees sarah and abraham and he talks to them he tells them then i'm gonna bless you but why is he the wording is different he says because you have done this thing now i don't make no sense sort of let me explain something uh we all believe that it's an unconditional covenant i set you up i hope you know that i believe in it too brother branham called it unconditionally we all believe that right but the thing that gets me is if it was unconditional then why did he just say because you did this because to me brother that sounds conditional now look i'm not taking away from what brother branham said i'm going to break it down so that you you you message scholars that are looking at me like i don't know about this here we go here's a guy going against brother branham i'm not he's right it is an unconditional promise the unconditional part was that he made the promise without abraham even asking for it right but in order for him to obtain this unconditional word he had to meet a certain condition look for abraham to even know anything more he said i need you to get out of that city you're dwelling in and i need you to go to a place which i will show you i need you to leave your family i need you to leave your father and what did abraham do abraham brought along lot that was not the conditions that god had told them to do something amen are you watching this now but i thought it was unconditional well it is but at the same time it's not all right you know what i want to do is try to explain uh uh and if you'll just bear with me hey don't don't get all judged on me now just relax all right and watch what's gonna unfold here because i want to take away this delusional nonsense this state of mind we've got last night i told you we need to be rewired because somehow we got programmed and i'm sorry if you're not receiving the update you need to restart your mind turn it off power it down and then power back up and then hit refresh maybe you need to clean out the usb port i don't know maybe you need to go update your your carrier i don't care what it is but what you need to do is hit refresh and get quiet you're about to receive an update on something you already knew but now we're going to put it to work your phone has all these apps on them but they don't do no good if you don't update them and then they don't do no good if you don't use them right i didn't know i had an app on my phone they could do that like last night i didn't have an app on my phone that could tell me how to do an elliptical but for whatever reason i put in my pocket and said you better believe that's true i thought sister rachel was talking to me i don't know and i appreciated the singing this morning and when you all got to that song i went come on i had to come out of the office and sit there and listen to that singing that angelic singing more than enough i want to come and go more than he knows right you got to know i could hit that note huh pay attention i'll shock you some more but i want to get rid of this delusion that all we have to do is sit here and do nothing and god will do everything that is a lie spun from the pits of hell it is not true and our young people are coming to the water they don't even accept christ i don't know about here but in most messes churches they get in a dry center and come out a wet center the bible says that we have to verbally express with our mouth that jesus christ is our lord and savior and get in the water be baptized in the lord jesus christ and receive the holy ghost but we've got to quit telling him all you got to do is do it and then the lord will do the rest that's just not true it's not true it's a lie that i'll tell you the truth i've been guilty as a preacher saying it right any preachers want to help me with an amen thank you thank you that ain't admitting guilt brother but it kind of was we've all done it we all were taught we looked at that unconditional and we ran with it right we ran with it all we have to do is believe all we have to do is believe well look uh let's get down to business there scholars um to get a blessing from god oops wrong one here it is to get a blessing from god you have to believe well that's a condition it don't just happen you first have to believe brother branham said do you believe do you believe do you have faith half the jesus says where's your faith where's the condition have faith now can i keep going you want me to you want me to be quiet all of this is genesis 18 was before sodom after sodom et cetera had been told all through these scriptures here that he was going to receive a promise but he hadn't gotten it he got ishmael that wasn't it and then here he said now because you he got the promise of isaac and then he says now because you have done this thing here yes now watch how many of you know well let's just do this all right let's do this i'm gonna go uh let's go to matthew chapter six now a lot of bible reading today and i hope that's all right i gave a lot of quotes last night so today we're gonna read the bible i hope that's okay matthew 6 and 14 and 15. i want to just point out some things here and i want you to just watch the trail of jesus here and how he does things so we're going to go uh matthew and fourth first chapter 6 and then 14. uh let me see how i have this written here so here we go here he goes here look at what he says here i want you to follow this word for what's the next word nice and loud ah okay for if you forgive man their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you now wait a minute hang on brother jack now now hold on a minute here you mean to be forgiven i've got to forgive well that don't sound unconditional brother come on i want you to help me now with this don't get funny i want to hear amen's or something help me o lord or something 15 says but if you forgive not men their trespasses watch neither will your father forgive your trespasses wait wait wait wait wait wait now i thought god's grace brother smiley helped me brother troy i thought god's grace was unconditional it is because god's grace is there without even asking for it god placed it there but in order for you to obtain god's grace you're going to have to forgive people or you will not be forgiven look this is not my words this is not these are not my ideas this is the this is jesus christ said if you don't forgive my father won't forgive you but if you forgive my father is duty bound to forgive you wow oh we're going to follow the if trail all right look at uh chapter 16 same book chapter 16 verse 24. i hope you like this because see this is what happened we got rewired and then all of a sudden these scriptures popped out like i'd never read them before but in order for you to do this you got to get rewired your mind has to change you can't you can't keep seeing it through the same glasses you had on before you need to change your prescription yeah i got a lot of little antidotes right now don't i 16 uh verse 24 i believe yep then jesus said if any man look if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me now look he didn't say just follow he said if any man want to follow me then let him deny himself so you mean you can't ride the jesus train without first denying jack duff [Applause] right you can't ride the jesus train if you don't deny brother troy brother troy has got to deny brother troy's mind and indulges in his own thoughts and inhibitions he has got to follow jesus if i want to follow jesus i've got to deny my own idea of what jesus is [Music] right if i'm going to jump on the message train then i've got to deny myself in my idea of what the message is and follow after jesus christ if you don't know jesus you'll never know the message because the message will never make sense to somebody who does not know who jesus christ is [Music] amen you can quote it you can speak it you can have all this knowledge you can tear me up you can be a scholar and that's perfectly fine but if you don't know jesus you're a tingling brass and a sounding symbol and that's it come on somebody help me now all right let's go to uh 1720. now i'm just going to follow it so y'all just have fun with us and jesus said because of your unbelief same book matthew 17 20. because of your unbelief he said for barely i say unto you if now i thought everybody had faith like a mustard seed apparently not because if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed now now do we think it means that small i don't know what it means a grain of mustard a mustard seed is the only seed that will not integrate with any other seed an orange and an apple they'll mix and they'll get this perverted looking tree but a mustard seed won't do it so if you have faith that will not mix will not co-mingle with any other idea i got faith in buddhism i got faith in muslim and i got a little bit of christianity i put them all together hey what do you got a mess i throw in a little brother branham and they don't even know who i'm talking about well that's interesting you mean to tell me the seventh church is messenger you're getting credit for it odd odd odd okay anyway we're not here to talk about that if you have faith as a greater muscle seed you shall say unto this mountain and remove history yawn to place and it shall remove and nothing will be impossible to who to who a little louder saints oh you mean so if you have faith as a muscle scene you can tell that wave go that way and it will you can say there'll be no turbulence and there won't be that's right you can say there'll be rain today and rain will fall you can say it'll be a dry season and it will you can ask god to come in the midst of you and do marvelous things and he will come on all right waking up all right here we go all right are you ready now let's go to 19 same book 17. i'm just gonna leave them things off they bother me i don't need them anyway i'm getting younger that's what's happening i'm getting younger and they're blurring my vision same book matthew 19 17. let's go here we'll say and he said unto them why call now this is the rich young ruler i love it the red jungle that comes up with his arrogant self and he says why close me thou good he said there is none good but one that is god but if if doubt will enter into life keep the commandments now he goes on to say a little more sassy things and the lord gives him an answer in 21 verse 21 ah jesus said to him if thou wilt be perfect how many wants to be perfect he told this to the rich young ruler if you want to be perfect if you want to be perfect go and sell all that thou hast and give to the poor and they also have treasure in heaven and come and follow me now look that's not to everybody okay he was talking to the rich young ruler and contacted his spirit and when he found out what his problem was he's a good man but he's got greed in his heart and he said look you're doing great everything you're like 99.9 but if you want to be spotless sell all that you have and follow me now that ain't for everybody so when i jesus said sell oh i sell all i had but that wasn't your problem see all right now let's go on to mark chapter nine go to mark chapter nine verse 23 i like the beat of that one i'm enjoying it you know poor little brother i was out there and he went like this to his door and i almost walked so that's the wrong door sorry about that i couldn't believe i said that's the wrong door little fella looked all disappointed i saw i'm going in this one so i wonder if they were looking at us like how come y'all are so nicely dressed why we believe in never mind all right all right you got to love them look pray for them we don't know what's going on here there's a reason why these people are all here because they're being they're living off the anointing of what's going on in spirit and truth true story that's why they won't move you think they're not if you can hear them they can hear us come on [Applause] they're just writing the anointing of a real believer it is something that's why these churches won't leave this place it's not a competition like there's something here we've been in other places and we could never get anywhere with god but we get here something's going on it ain't you friend it's here mark chapter 9 verse 23 sorry about that jesus said unto him if thou canst believe if you can't believe all things are possible to them who believes if you can't believe so what does that tell me not everybody can right not everybody can but if you can't believe all things are possible if you can't believe i'm gonna keep following go luke go to luke chapter 14. glory to god you're gonna you're gonna like where this ends up because i'm trying to give you i'm trying to empower you this morning no i am empowering you this morning luke 14 26. do i want that one caleb no well let's go ahead and read it it says if any man come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters yea in his own life also he cannot be my disciple now look this is getting down serious stuff brother jack because we think all we have to do is go to church sing a few songs pay a little bit of dues and walk out and brother duff is our pastor and we believe the message and everything's all right but jesus is laying it out on the line now i'm not telling you to go and hate everybody what he means is put me first or you cannot be my disciple put me before your hobbies put me before your house put me before your payments put me before your job put me before your wife's happiness before your children's happiness put me first or you cannot even follow me [Music] now you know that scripture don't seem so harsh before my mind got rewired when i got into the greatest battle of her thoughts series that we did at church and we really haven't left it yet have we brother we were just kind of spinning around that because we're seeing the change but when i got into that and i hear over and over again when i was dealing with the sinus pain that night one of the nights i was dealing with it i was sitting like man what is going on and i put on a greatness battle i just pressed play wherever i left off and the first thing out of brother brandon's mouth was it's in your mind it doesn't hurt it's in your mind i went all right i went to sleep we've got to understand that if you're going to follow jesus you've got to put it in your mind and down in your heart and my brother said last night what is between your heart and your mind i go uh the fight and he goes no your mouth the struggle is to say the right things your heart knows what to speak but your mind thinks it knows better you've got to tell your mind just shut up and listen to what the heart because out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks come on come on hey i thank you brother troy but you gave it to me now you want me to take you in i'll do it that i was like that's a missing piece of the puzzle right i needed that i wait till i get back home i came to bring you something i'm going to take something back amen let's go to john chapter 4 we start to move here praise the lord john chapter 4 well john you gonna have uh brother troy you're gonna have food at this place all right i i knew better to ask you my brother said i need to come out to tucson i said come on guys i'll go when it's cold i go when's that but you can speak the word we'll have snow this year look at this woman at the well uh uh john chapter 4 verse 10. what did he say to her he says if uh chapter 4 verse 10 he said uh he said if thou knew the gift that of god and who it is that sits si uh say until they give me a drink you'd be asking me for water but because she didn't know but see when she when he said that he sparked her her spiritual thinking if you knew suddenly her eyes were open and y'all ever seen the chosen y'all watch that you see that that's my favorite the first season is my favorite and that last one oh man if i could just can i just talk about it for a little bit can i just talk about it for a little bit don't tell me you have not ever been a smart aleck with god and to listen to that lady i never even thought of that and she goes oh what because geo water is better than samaritan water did you hear her she was being a smart silly lady i'm trying to be polite but he knew her trouble and he goes you're right i forgot to say please and he's trying with her and he's trying with her and she's like ah you shouldn't be talking to me and he goes but i'd still like that drink of water please and he's being so patient and when he was about to lose her attention i love it he goes your first husband was named this your second husband this your second one you left because you didn't feel like you deserved them and you remember on your wedding night his skin smelled like oranges this is intimate detail he said his skin smell like oranges because he worked in the groves and every time you go to the market you think of him and you miss him and you still feel guilty for leaving him she dropped the water she goes why are you doing this she goes he goes your third husband was named this and i'm like sitting there going listen we have seen that before amen now the bible don't say he did that but i got no problem believing that he did because brother branham used that over and over and over and over and over and i'm telling you if you knew the gift of god that was in front of you i don't mean me but i mean the holy spirit you could say what you want and it would be done for you come on if if thou canst believe he said all things are possible yeah she took off running come see in the hand i saw i loved it if we go to service the anointing drops down don't nobody see come see brother jack no they don't do that no i'm not saying that either they're not saying nothing they keep it amongst themselves we keep well that was a good service brother okay well then bring somebody with you she didn't hesitate to spread the word she took off left a water pop behind and the bible specifically mentions she left her water pot and ran does anybody know why i taught you this years ago you know right because of who she was what time of the day she could go there must be some change in her because she don't care about that water part no more she left her past behind and she said come see a man who knows all things the problem with all of us is we're picking up the water pot as we walk out of church we lay it down on the altar but then we pick it up and walk out with it we come down here and we break the alabaster box and then we glue it back together and walk out with it like it's some kind of hidden treasure we've got to remember once you laid on the altar you'll leave it there and walk away [Applause] you don't pick it up you leave it there hallelujah if you've ever been forgiven then you're forgiven don't pick it up no more if you can forgive you'll be forgiven if you don't you won't but if you believe today you can walk out of here send free hallelujah go away do you love him what happened to the overcomers in the room huh we're waiting for something to happen we should have been overcomers before we walked in the place i come to preach to overcomers i come to preach the victorious i come to preach to the conquerors i come to preach to the bride i didn't come to preach you defeated i came to preach to the people who are undefeated hallelujah seven he says if any man thirst if but you've got to be thirsty let's go to john chapter eight do you love him he's good god is good all the time and all the time 8 19 hallelujah it's time to get off our little ash heap sitting around feeling sorry for ourselves all the time it's time for us to quit now you know what it's time for us to quit being the friends of job too ella fat and elephant and whatever their names were still there for seven days just looking at them what kind of friends are those i got friends like that sinus infection everything like that they just stood and i wondered what he did not my people at church i thought my pastors i mentioned to pastor who would certainly be in prayer certainly be in prayer brother i'm asking you for prayer right now i didn't say certainly being prayer don't give me that uh that what he called that that that typical answer don't give me that just oh i'll be praying if the lord willing if you say the lord willing you don't want to be around me that's fine lord willing as an excuse man don't tell me that if you don't want to have coffee don't tell me lord will it just tell me you don't want to [Music] you want to have some fellowship oh the lord willing we'll pray about it pray about it we're like god's going to tell you not to don't you fellowship with caleb he's your brother but stay away from him i know parents like that that ain't right come on encourage your brother man i need some prayer well i'll certainly be i'll i'll pray for you well brother kelly be there yeah i thought she was gonna start praying oh you mean now what kind of a pastor all right when brother jack told me i said brother jackie said how the saints pray for me he said i will i knew he would i knew he would i didn't have to challenge you i knew he would have said thank you brother jack i know that and i i actually told the church y'all don't pray for me to be healed yet then i went huh i said no i said don't pray for me to be healed what i want you to do is pray and ask god what i need to learn from this well that went on for about a week and when i came back in all messed up the saints were like no we love you brother we know what you said but we're not going to listen to you we're going to pray for god to heal you and they all went to war i said well that's kind of what i think the lord wanted them to learn there's a time to fight and there's a time to fly but this is the time to fight brother we're not leaving no more are you with me can you say amen john chapter 8 verse 19 we're just going to follow this trail of if here if all right i'm going to just read the bold print if you don't mind it's in red he said you neither know me you neither know me nor my father i love this if you had known me you should have known my father also you see this is what i'm trying to get at it you don't know you might well you don't know the message and you don't even know who brother branham was because if you knew the message and knew who brother branham was you'd know who jesus christ was see just because you know knowledge man that don't mean you know him that's why you've got to know who jesus is and and like people like well brother can you believe it's two different people no i don't believe it's two different people but there's definitely two different anointings here because jesus is not talking like in the third person me and my he said me and my father are one but he also he also made the difference of he is the son and the spirit father was someplace else but also in his heart how many understands that i'm not talking two gods we're just talking two different offices right right now right now i'm an evangelist but i'm a pastor back in tucson and when i talked to my little girl i'm not talking to her as a pastor i'm talking truman's daddy i miss you daddies i miss you too my name is like i miss you too my dad dad now i'm daddy all of a sudden right now on the phone with the misses and the misses like how are you doing and it's a whole different ball game now because now i'm saying hello i love you miss you how are you doing my i'm not saying how you doing i'm talking i'm trying i'm not talking to a child i'm talking to you an adult and if my dad calls me how you doing son i'm alright dad how are you doing i call him papa are you doing pop i'm all right now i'm a son all of a sudden but go call me the son caleb where is he at go call me the pastor caleb where is he at tell me how i can be all these things and still have one name i'm a pastor right now i'm an evangelist right i'm a dad i'm a husband i'm a friend i'm a friend and i all right i'm a brother uh i'm a confidant i'm a counselor but my name is caleb do you understand so when he's talking about him and his father don't get confused it's all the same but right now he's the son talking about his dad if you'd have known me you'd have known him if you'd have known the caleb pastor you'll know the caleb evangelist if you ever knew my name you know exactly what i am and if you ever meet jesus you'll know every part about him jehovah jireh of the old testament it's jesus christ of the new testament do you believe it say amen and when i call on jesus i get jehovah jireh too when i call on jesus i get to hold shalom jehovah nishi jehovah rapha when i call on jesus i get all the receptive names when i call on jesus i get the father the son and the holy ghost boy when i call on jesus i get a friend when i call on jesus i get a over when i call on jesus i get a daddy when i call on jesus i get everything that i have need of glory hallelujah i'm not getting old i'm getting better all right [Laughter] where was i oh yeah 19. i read it and then in verse 20 it says this these words spake jesus in the treasury we'll skip over that verse 21 i go my way i go my way and you shall seek me and shall die in your sins whether i go you cannot come that sounds sad verse 22 then he said the jews will they will they kill himself he said to them whether i go you cannot come i'm still reading here now 24 23 and he said unto them you are from beneath i am from above and you want us to be nice christians this don't sound very nice you guys got to quit acting like you're stepping on your grandmother's toes and just step on them i was telling brother jack last night i don't care who they are get out of their way if you're not a christian get out of my way you understand what i'm saying why are you yielding the right-of-way to an unbeliever every blessing in this world belongs to you the sun rises and sets because you're here the tribulation is not hit full force because you're here you're going to find out that you're in the squeeze you're going to get there and go that was it oh i know you're all expecting to starve to death huh well if that's the squeeze then africa and ethiopia have been in the squeeze for hundreds of years india they don't know what did they squeeze the daylights out of and then you were expecting something like that look what's going to be squeezed is this whatever you are is going to be squeezed till there's nothing left but that word seed in your heart to have the ability i don't got to worry about money i don't need a bailout i don't need a stimulus all i have is a spoken word what i have need of i speak it and it comes right where i have to need it [Music] it's squeezing every last part of caleb durant out and showing me what the real caleb duran is the real caleb neuron is a son of god i am a king and i am a priest and i am heir to the father and enter the throne i just need to speak the positive not the negative i speak in faith and if my faith is weak then lord raise up my faith i believe help thou the unbelief that is in my life notice what i said there i didn't say lord i believe helped out my unbelief i'm not going to claim my unbelief you claim unbelief i'm not doing it lord i believe help the unbelief that's in my life to become the believing power of the manifested son and daughter of god allow me to believe so i can speak the word and follow after it when it takes place glory hallelujah do you love him 24 says this i said therefore unto you that you shall die in your sins for if you believe not that i am he you shall die in your sins amen so if you don't believe that he's who he is you're dying listen man listen jesus is saying the ifs not me oh brother caleb you're putting the you know you're putting the claws on that contract brother i didn't put the claws on the contract jesus did there's an if clause you don't just come here get wet in the water and then come out and think everything's hunky-dory it don't work like that there is something for you to do now i know what you're thinking well i thought it was in my works it's not but it is what works works of your faith in the holy spirit he said if you believe then show me your works is that what he said oh that's not my words just by faith alone okay but your faith will produce the works of the holy ghost how are we getting stuck on that people get message people get stuck all the time well it's not anything you can do really if it's nothing you can do then why is your hair dragging the floor why is your skirt dragging the floor and while you all walking around like you the most on the happiest people in the face of the earth you're trying to work your way into heaven don't look in the eye just come in there and plus press play you know brother brown says raise your hand you see everybody do like this i'm like what is with that spirit man is there any joy in that tape because when i hear the tape i get a whole different reaction can you imagine listen greatest baller fought and sit there going now that's a good tape i guess i'll tell my church about it now now it's in 1960 what was that tape brother what are you what are you trying to be anymore yeah what happened to the injured individuality of believers in the body my finger don't act like my lung my lung don't try to be my foot my ear doesn't try to be the nose they all got their parts and if you're quiet then be quiet but i'm loud and i'd like to be loud amen i like to have my worship heard i like my praise to be heard i like to lift my voice i like to run and gather for i enjoy praising god i am a praise warrior i'm on the front line you can sit in the back and you can be quiet but i'm a praise warrior and i'm on the front line running up and down the aisle because i want to serve and worship and praise god with everything that's in me hallelujah do you believe say amen [Applause] come on come on praise him come on praise him come on praise him come on come on come on come on [Applause] [Music] hey come on [Applause] people don't want to praise them because they don't even know what they're praising you may be seated god bless you they don't want to praise them because they don't know what they're praising they don't praise them because they don't have no reason to praise them when i was over at the brown tabernacle i stayed there for about a year i had to get out of tucson for a while and all kinds of different ideas and i saw i'll go to jeffersonville and i'll listen to tapes and i'll get the doctrine down right until i found out the brothers in the back played certain tapes to go along with what they were thinking but i didn't know that till the end so it didn't matter i heard the message uh statue of perfect man was screaming my head off i heard a little phrase in there where brother brown said because god said so god said so god said so in about towards the end of time i went godzilla and everybody turned around looked at me i thought all the wood bits were going to crack i i didn't know you weren't allowed to say amen in that little wooden place i mean if you listen to the tapes somebody's saying hey man you can hear somebody saying hey man i turn around look something like oh there wasn't me that was the tape huh i thought it was all right to believe god i didn't know no different i still don't know no difference all i know is that when i hear something prickly here and it gets me excited i praise him i dance i shout i have a good time because serving god is a wonderful thing to do you ask me why why i'm happy i'll just tell you why because my sins are gone oh okay that's the reason people don't want to praise god brother stephen because they ain't never been forgiven for anything but see the bible tells me where much is where much is given much is required is that right so when i gave to the world i had to come back and give back to god and when i know you don't know but i know all the things i've done and all the things that god little match to he said where is the evidence case dismissed case dismissed case dismissed i'm saved by grace yes amen amen you know that song i was guilty come on case dismissed saved by grace well they ain't got nobody to praise because they ain't never been forgiven i know what i was for i know what i was going into i know what i'm guilty of but jesus christ little maps burn that evidence and i ain't got no evidence of it the devil still did point his finger and god said you better quit you better get that finger out of his face come on do you love him your case is dismissed and you got no reason to praise god your case is dismissed you got no reason to say amen your sin is saved by grace there's nothing against you it's in the sea of god's forgiveness and you can't squeeze out on amen how many has been forgiven say amen how many knows you've been bought by the blood shouty man that's what i'm talking about yes sir is right tell me to be quiet i don't even know how i got on there don't tell me to be quiet you're the wrong church telling me to be quiet [Applause] i remember i went down to uh when i was in tucson and we got started and and i was being kind of a little extra and uh you know not you don't believe it i know and the mr says to me she says to me you know why you're like that don't you and i said why it's just because you're in your own church and i turn around and go that's right and i ain't got to apologize to nobody for the way i act if they don't like it they can go find another or there's 14 more to choose from if you don't like none of them you can start one that's what everybody does anyway i couldn't find one that fit so i'm going to start my own i can't convert nobody because i ain't been converted so i'm gonna go steal some i said it i'm not taking it back either i didn't steal any brother green gave them to me and the 20 i had already got converted a little missionary room that i was using on the south side of tucson i picked them up all by myself with god's help i didn't get them from no church they came to me come on and then brother green gave permission and every time there was a funeral i got a few more that's not my fault that's not me that's not that's god's doing you get these guys they can't stand a church and they'll go start a church and they got started bleeding out and what we call back at two so i don't know if you have these they're called tumbleweeds anybody ever heard of that a tumbleweed is a weed that grows and dries and then it breaks and it rolls over wherever the wind takes them and while they're going they're spreading seeds everywhere seeds of discrepancy seas of hate seeds of bitterness seeds of this seeds of woe is me they get a few people and all they got is a hangry church and all they can preach about us against somebody else and when you're sitting there tearing somebody else down your own testimony is being torn down the bible says you hold a man or you hold a man in reproach or in in condemnation or whatever your own testimony is finished off how many understand is that hold a man in contempt and you'll lose your own reputation that's the verse right let me just say this we've all heard this before but tearing me down is not going to build you up tearing you down will not build them up [Applause] well it got too loud in here for y'all maybe they're listening praise the lord all right let's move on quickly i got a few more to go uh is that all right brother jack are we out of time okay all right i heard it i heard it so let's go john chapter you better stop it john chapter 10 go john chapter 10 verse 9 10 9 praise the lord i am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture you hear that if i just want to keep reading the ifs right here let's go to 38 that same chapter 38. no let's do something else let's go 34. it is not written in your law uh i said you are god's amen is it not written in your law that you were gods 35 if you called them gods who unto whom the word of god came and the scripture cannot be broken say ye of him whom the father had sanctified and sent unto the world thou blaspheme is because i said i am the son of god if i do not the works of my father believe me not but if i do though you believe not me believe the works i thought you said it wasn't my works it isn't but it is if jesus is in you he'll do the works for you you don't got to believe i'm a christian and if you don't that's fine but believe the works that you see done that you may know and believe that the father is in me ah and i in him you see it where are we at now what verse is that but if i okay we did okay we just about to read it all right now let's go to 11 uh let's go to 11 verse 40. just going to keep on that you already know jesus said on earth said i not unto thee if thou would believe thou should see the glory of god now he's talking to martha see he said if i said if if you can believe look the whole idea behind lazarus coming from the dead was somebody had to believe amen good he had to kick the disciples out because of their unbelief to raise up that little girl he didn't do that on his own but here he said did not tell you if you'd believe you'd see the glory of god so right then that must have sparked your faith and she began to believe and she saw the glory of god lazarus come forth are you catching it now glory i'm trying to get to a point here and i want to get it down quickly uh there's something in here ah i'm going to go ahead and skip ahead a little bit because i want to get something else let's go to john chapter 15 and i want you to hear this clearly 15 and verse 6 i believe all right here we go let's start with five praise the lord and we're going to just read through my brother uh through 14 okay sister who's got the computer you sister all right my sister i am the vine no we're gonna go five i am the vine you are the branches he that uh abideth in me now watch these conditions brother jack watch these conditions he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth for much fruit for without me you can do oh hold it right there so wait in order for me to do something in order for me to call the rain stop the rain stop the wave i even brought it a couple times just to see what would happen and then i think somebody said well that's easy i said is it then do that and it just i mean i wish y'all could have been there i want everybody to go to the ocean sometime soon and i want you to try it don't get swept off now it's not as hard as you think all right it's not something you can control it's just simply just giving over to god say lord you do it but then he turns around tells you no you do it no you do it right he told brother branham i'm waiting to see what you're going to do you speak to the storm oh you mean brother branham could talk to the storm but we can't he said what are you crying to me for moses you speak [Music] why are you crying to me you speak moses took his rod and stretched over that sea and he said then brother ran said then god came up behind him looked at that sea with angry eyes and the sea went all right all right we'll get out of the way and somehow dried off the place now next verse if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if watch this here's the condition if you abide in me there's more now and my words abide in you come on somebody you shall ask what you will and it might happen are you sure that's not a misprint it could happen if a couple of you get together and speak prosperity and so forth no and the word shall in the greek means guarantee i feel some faith come on come on come on so he says if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and i guarantee it will be done [Music] what other guarantee do you need when god says i'll guarantee it for you next verse glory to god it gets a little hectic here hearing is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples now in other words you have to bear fruit if you're not bearing fruit you're not even a disciple guys if god thank you that how'd you say it it has to show if it's not showing something is wrong if i pay for a broadway production and i sit in the chair there better be a show [Music] so sorry ladies and gentlemen i hope you enjoyed it i enjoyed what the curtain never moved nobody gave a bow nobody got flowers i paid for a show i believe god i want a show [Applause] come on [Music] not a show i want him to show up i believe him he's got to show up hallelujah i believe him i abide in him his words are by me he's got to show up that's his word if you can't get nowhere with praying i want you to pray like this lord i abide in you your words abide in me now i need you to show up i feel his presence on that don't you i feel an anointing flying on that brother jack huh i need you to show up [Music] right now right now i need you to show up right now [Applause] right now right now right now hallelujah carry on verse 9 as the father had loved me look at these why why why doesn't anybody want to go to church when you got verses like this that after listening to the greatest ballard fought and getting my update then i suddenly understand how the program works i i love it i've been preaching on how many years maybe almost 20. i've been all over the country in some parts of the world and i've been a pastor now going on set we're going to be eight years december the 7th and we're enjoying it and we're enjoying the blessing of god in the last two years like all of a sudden there's stuff being written there that was never there before oh that never happens to y'all tell me we don't say brother jack i found this scripture you found it was it lost or do you mean you found your bible you ain't read in a while i'll leave that alone all right i found this verse you found a verse where was it was it misplaced well apparently because i didn't even know it was here anyway as the father had loved me i knew this was here but as a father loved me so have i loved you so have i loved you continue in my love if you keep my commandments you shall abide in my love oh it's getting it's getting heavier in here now look brother jack look at this do you understand you got to keep his commandments now well i thought we were done with the law who said that now i'm not talking about the levitical and the you know sabbath and all this there are 10 laws that we need to keep and on top of that he added to right love your neighbor as yourself and love the lord your god with all your heart and all that soul etc right so it's not many things we got to do it's just 12. it's just 12. but look here i'm going to keep reading if you keep my commandments you shall abide in my love even as i have kept my father's commandments and abide in his love now jesus is not telling you to do something that he doesn't do himself amen that's right carry on please these things have i spoken unto you that that my joy might remain in you oh there goes the answer to why i'm so depressed those other friends you know why you're depressed because you're not abiding in christ and you're not his words you're not keeping his commandments and you're not abiding in his love therefore his love is not abiding in you and that's why you have no joy oh brother joe i just brother jack i just feel like if i could just sing a few more specials my joy would come back that's not going to happen that's right because that's not where your joy is but when i play the piano i feel so good that's wonderful play the piano at your house and get some but right here if you want his joy you've got to have these things that were spoken to you said that his joy might remain in you might remain and that your joy might be full how many ones are joyful i just showed you my joy was full how'd i run in here all right let's get going maybe this is my commandment that you love one another as i have loved you carry on love with no man than this that that a man laid down his life for his friends you are my friends oh oh oh oh brother jack uh oh oh you are my friends you are my friends the bible says let's not ignore it now but you are my friends brother jack pastor the bible says he's my friend and he's my friend how come he don't show up huh because my friends in the world are better friends than people in the church huh my friends in the world they don't judge me then why are you dressing like them and they ain't dressing like you why not why not huh if your friends don't judge you then why are you dressing like them and them not like you why are you drinking like them and they ain't drinking your wine why are you drinking their liquor and you're not they're not drinking your wine why are you smoking without smoking they're over here on fire like you're supposed to be on fire my friends don't judge me if god was my friend he said he's my friend yeah yeah but there's a condition to being his friend you are my friends if i want loud loud you're my friends you're my friends you do whatsoever i command you what kind of a friend what kind of a friend is this you know we sing those songs i have found a friend in jesus he's everything to me yeah i wonder if jesus would say that about you or me could he say i have found a friend in caleb drawn he's everything to me he does everything i command him and even more he goes wherever i send him he never complains not once he's my friend and i will bless him all his life could jesus sing a song like that about me am i really his friend let's get serious now am i i want you to say in your own way am i his friend don't say you are be careful with that because your only his friend if you do whatsoever he commands you i don't know what kind of friendship is this but i'm going to ask you something how many of us command jesus to do whatever we want all the time jesus i need you to do this i got to have you do this i gotta have this oh by the way forgive me for that i'm not saying i'm sorry they got what they asked for they got what they deserved but i need you to come on the scene and show up for me well you want him to do whatever he could you command him but you can't do what he commands you think about it you better believe it that hurts my heart to be honest with you i i've asked the church back home and said am i really his friend am i i'm not looking for sympathy guys i'm not looking for you know how how are you doing buddy you thought you just walk in here you ain't changed a bit man look at you i love you i love you i'm going to talk to you a few minutes after search i got something i got to say with you all right you are my friends if you do whatsoever i command you you can't even claim to be a friend of jesus you can't even say you are if you don't do what he tells you now i know we all of a sudden got real sober in here didn't we but this is gospel now i told you we're going to follow that if trail all the way through what verse is that says 14 okay what did i say we're going to read 2 what was that it yeah no there's two more no wait yeah you're right you're right so that's a bit of me abiding him so his love that we say leave that up for a minute so we can meditate on that marinate it his love that we said is unconditional it turns out it has conditions but here's the thing and let me just explain this this is what brother brandon was saying and i'm not trying to reword it but look we're talking about our understanding and how we all got excited over something and there's all kind of people believing the message and thinking all they got to do is believe god sent a prophet and everything's all right i'm telling you that's just not true that's just not true the unconditional part john 3 16 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son right that whosoever will etc the unconditional part is let's put that up john 3 16. let's do uh john 3 15. because john 3 16 is not the first time he said it by the way john 3 15 says that who that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life 16. for god to love the world comma that he gave his only begotten son comma so let me just show you unconditional gospel of the world unconditional that he gave but now here's the condition to get his unconditional promise yes that whosoever believed in him wait wait wait so to get god's love the world and his only begotten son you've got to believe in him believe in him no not just believe it's not just it's that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life now we all want to indulge in this that's unconditional no this is the unconditional this is a conditional conditional unconditional condition but this right here is the condition you have to believe in him if you don't believe in him you cannot obtain cannot obtain his unconditional promise so now we get it now it's not unconditional is it it is and it isn't you can title this his unconditional condition there are or you could tell the mess i call it back home if like i told these people in phoenix i'm gonna preach a message called this they're like if just bear with me i'll give you a couple old testament examples and then we'll finish up y'all know the story about naaman in second kings chapter five you know got to put it up he came over there with leprosy look discernment is not something that's new that went all to the scriptures and here he come and he said he sent his servant and he goes out and his servant the servant of the prophet meets the servant of naaman and the name and gets mad because the prophet don't come out to see him well you sent your servant and then you want him to come out himself so he sent a servant you didn't show him respect so whatever and he says uh for you to dip in the river jordan seven times now i got another lesson on that but i won't bring that one today but let's just talk about that for a minute and then he gets upset i'm with this i'm a great man i'm of that i'm of this i'm with that well it turns out that leprosy was not actually his problem i mean the man stinks the man stinks his thumb probably fell off he's probably all wrapped up got his arm around nose is probably missing faith look this is leprosy if you have time to show your picture what leprosy looks like it ain't pretty you stink your flesh is running and you're in pain and you're talking about i'm not getting in that water well apparently brother leprosy is not really your problem you mean to tell me you've fallen apart and you stink and you're too proud to get in muddy water i mean seriously how much worse could it get get your three or four toes you got left and put them in there but he makes the statement i'm not doing this i'm not getting in there there's got to be cleaner water someplace man if the water was dirty back then can you imagine what he would say now we're getting in that santa cruz ain't even water in that thing but then the servant said this verse 13. if he had asked you to do some great thing you'd have done it if so then what did they do oh yeah well i can do this and he gets in there seven times you know the store and he's healed but see there's another one like this elisha was following elijah and he was told your master is going to die i know the prophet said what are you doing don't you know he's going he said i know it mind your business elijah turn around and say elisha what do you want from me he said i want a double portion of your spirit he said you've asked me a hard thing but come on everybody say it if you see me go you shall have what you've asked for this is not a new concept there has always been from abraham to jesus christ has always been if clauses in the promises of god it's not one-sided like we think it's not how we just got to believe and sit here and do nothing and god will fix everything son daughter you have got some things to do yes sir that's right god is not going to clean up your mess without you first repenting of that mess and when i say repent i don't mean just talk to god about it i mean go to whoever you offended or whatever you got to do you got to repent and if that means pay your fines to the court you got to go pay your fines of the court they're not just going to go away i've got a cousin who got out of prison and he was supposed to you know parole and all this and he was doing good for about six months next you know he just dodged him moving from place to place changed his phone number every two weeks thought they weren't gonna catch up to him got a real good job and they caught him at the door and i told him it's not just gonna go away man this is the government they're not going to play with their money they don't care about you being in the prison they don't even want you to they want you to pay the money they know you can't pay if you're sitting there they want you to give them their money well i don't want to pay him well they're going to pay him somehow now he's going to pay there is a condition if you want your license back you want your rights back if you want your respective uh uh you know stats in the community back if you want to be all this you there's a wait you've got to do some things to clean it up if you want the pastor to recognize there's a gift in your life you don't just come in here here i am to save the day you come in you pay your dues if you want to preach there's lots of people to preach to go preach that's what i was told when i said i had a call in my life the brother said well go preach oh when do you want me i didn't say here i just said go preach i was young inexperienced and i didn't like that answer i knew the call was there but then i went down the gospel rescue mission and i told my testimony then i went over to jail and i witnessed over there then i found some guys that i used to hang out with and i told them over there and all of a sudden i started to build that rapport and i understood oh i'm getting experience with people i get it then one day i was asked would you like to say a few things like up send a testimony and then people recognize hey there's a gift there but then i didn't get all puffed up and stayed down in the altar stay close to god and prayed and prayed and i you know there's guys not in our churches i know not we're not but you know we know of people that that that they got to give their life but they don't read their bible and they don't they don't uh hear the message done like that and they get up they start talking and if the first two times it might work but the third or fourth it was like we heard this before man when you gonna study right brother caleb what are you gonna study and you find out you've got to study to show yourself approved even paul said if you if you want to be a speaker you desire a good thing but study to show yourself approved there's all these if clauses and this morning let's have the musicians praise god if you want god to meet you on a certain thing you know you've got a condition to meet i don't know your condition and i don't know what the clause is and i don't know what the issues that you're going through but you know there is something you have got to make right with god if you know that just raise up your hand see look that's all over the room we're not playing games anymore when i got through this lesson of the greatest battle ever fought i realized brother jack that my own enemy was right here i don't mind telling you preaching pastoring you don't matter your enemy is always right here you're in god is ever present and your enemy is ever present your enemy doesn't want you to believe god he doesn't want you to know that all things are possible if you can believe amen so he does his best to get you to not believe god past minotaur gentle savior can we play that [Music] how many loves the lord with all your heart we have a good time this morning you still love him you still love me i'm not playing games anymore this is me at home too i'm not playing anymore i decided that i don't want to get old looking for the coming of the lord we've seen a lot of people come and go brother green is now gone [Music] but his grandson and his great grandson are in your presence that's a double portion i thought it was interesting that you made that statement this morning because he don't like anybody knowing that that's who his grandfather was but you notice how he got up here he said no disrespect but his testimony got nothing to do with me he wasn't just i don't mean you know what i'm saying why is he telling you that he said because i might be his grandson but i'm his son we're not he knows he's not getting in on brother green's hotel and i i don't mean to say it mean like this but there's places that he was going to go and they were just kind of jumping over him because of who he was when he got to my church i walked him outside looked up at him i go i'm not better than you i am you and i go if you come around here you're going to understand that i've been to the same garbage you've been through and i don't put up with any garbage if you're going to get right get right and i'll help you now we've had some ups and downs and i don't mean with each other but we've seen him go through some stuff can i tell that story about the yeah are you sure so when he first came around he got pulled over for driving barely over the limit y'all understand what i'm saying he called me from jail but i was asleep so he had to stay there for a little while and then when he got out i went and picked him up i had to go get his car but it was still it was still in jail so i took him out to eat i didn't say a word brother jack did i say anything to you we get there and i took him to red lobster i said get whatever you want all right the orders was big emily said seafood is good for that headache you're experiencing right now and and so we get our food that's well i told you isn't it he wasn't

bless you it's been my honor and privilege to be back with you in this place and if the lord tarries i'll see you again but if he doesn't i'll see you in the morning that's a promise i have enough faith to know that if i go down i'll come up again god bless you [Applause] [Music] praise the lord how many appreciate the word of the lord on today amen [Applause] [Music] you can be seated just for a moment just need a little bit more here in the monitor um brother caleb was telling me a little bit about this sermon before he came and knew that uh if the lord would lead him to go in this direction that it would be a blessing amen for the church he hid a particular verse there in john chapter seven [Music] if you abide in me and my words abide in you you can ask what you will and you know we that that whole um i'll say john 15 or that right yeah john 15 john 15. that whole john 15 was one of the things that actually got this ministry started um just a little testimony we were uh i was reading my bible and i don't just bear with me y'all give me just a little a few few minutes just a few minutes but you know um years ago i was very faithful to reading the newspaper and especially the sports page i always enjoyed uh picking that up and reading it before i go to work just i didn't watch tv but i just read the sports so i can see how to talk to the guys when i got to work that's the way i was and um you know the one day i went downstairs and pick up that newspaper run back upstairs to read it and then you know i heard the spirit of lord tell me one morning and say if you read your bible as faith as you read that newspaper you'd be much fun up the road [Music] i said now i don't believe that's the devil talking to me to tell me to read my bible that that's the voice of god so uh that day i started a bible reading plan and and and i've been reading the bible every year since that time uh i can't even be honest i can't tell you exactly how many times i've read the bible through and through but i will tell you it's been over uh 20 years that i've been doing this and so i love the word of god but one day i was reading my bible and i came across john 15 and when i read that the it was talking about you know how tree would be fruitful but sometimes the tree had to be cut had to be pruned in order to bring forth more fruit and i say lord what is that you know and as i was meditating i knew that was the lord actually dealing with me and calling me into the ministry just by reading that scripture and said lord and i was a song leader at the time and i just didn't really know what how am i going to do this what's gonna happen so i didn't tell anybody i just held on to it and went to a convention there in um in uh penn harris and uh brother musgrove came out and preached the message fruit much fruit more fruit and he preached from a man of john 15. i said lord this is you speaking and if there was nobody else in that convention that was going to get something from god i knew god was talking directly to me so i just began to just have a conversation in the chair with the lord i'm just praying lord i know you're talking to me what you want me to hear i said i believe you're calling me to start a church but i don't know what to name the church and there that moment god says spirit and truth tabernacle [Music] say okay lord i hold on to that and i didn't say anything to my wife i just held it and then go and announce it to my pastor i went back and faithfully served in the church for at least two more years before i said anything [Music] and god allowed some certain circumstances to happen as these circumstances were happening they were unwanted circumstances but what god did was he was just making it so i wouldn't be comfortable and he wanted to push me out and and i launched out a man by faith and we started in our home and my wife my three daughters and for a year we were there fellowshipping like that and and i thought i lost my mind but uh my daughter was just telling me the other day and she said uh just thinking back you know my daughter rebecca said i was just thinking mac um had not these two people been obedient to the call of god where would we all be right now instead of think about what you and and mom having to stand by your side and just just look at what what what it's done for us and i say well you know i never thought about it like that i know this is nothing but all god i just give them all the glory and all the honor and all the praise and you know i was just thanking god something about the bible reading the bible that just give you your your comfort give you your your peace brother caleb um i didn't tell you this you're a good friend of mine but i didn't tell you i wanted you to just come and just let the lord use you and and he did he certainly did use you while you were here but today is and for those that are online i told you i would just mention this but today is the last service that we're having in this building this building um we got a letter a couple weeks ago from our landlord and they they gave us an option said we have somebody that wants to rent your space but they want to pay market rent we're going to give you the option to pay market rent or you have to leave by the 15th and what market rent for us in this space is is 6 000 a month that's market rent so i talked it up with the brothers and we made a decision we're going to take option b we're going to leave on the 15th and um and we're going to trust the lord as to where he's going to take us to praise the lord all we know is that this is our season for a new church and for a new school that that's all i know right now if if i'm owning if i'm owning i don't have a problem paying 6 000 a month but if i'm renting i can't do that i can't make you rich i can't do that right so it's just you know just and as we shared with the church it's just where we at we're not being kicked out it's a decision that we made and we're walking by faith now you know in all honesty if i was to be honest with you we could have paid the six thousand we'd have been locked in for three years paying six thousand i don't feel that's the will of god for us to do that in rent ownership one thing rent something else so we we made the decision that we will close up this service and pack up our things and we'll go on brother jack where y'all going just walk by faith and knock myself [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so this is why i was telling everybody uh that our stream will actually go offline for two weeks there is something that we're working on and i will share that with the church amen after service that i'll share with you uh just a temporary thing that we have and that one says temporary because our permanent is when we purchase that's that's that's permanent that's permanent [Applause] um so you know just anyone that desired to join us you know and and service like uh just no call first so we can tell you where we're at you come join us but we won't be here anymore our time has come to an end and that this is what i thought was so um uh perfect i don't want to call it ironic but brother caleb was the one that spoke before we came he was the one that said lord lee you lean in a certain direction go in that direction god gonna be with you god proved to be with us 13 years 13 years and he's still with us right now it's god behind us leaving i'm going to tell you i am not giving the devil no glory god is behind us leaving [Music] this is this is what we call the tinder hannah jehovah and when they left egypt they had to get out in a hurry you ain't got time to pack up nothing you ain't got time to make no lunch back get out right now but i'm going to tell you this if they would if they would have held to the faith they would have been in the promised land in 40 days rather than 40 years so we're not gonna complain we're gonna praise we're gonna worship hold on a second i know i know now y'all wound up hold on a second [Music] that's my friend if i would have told him ahead of time it would have been a different story but i got he started talking about that testimony last night about how they got the building and he didn't even know what he was doing he didn't have no idea what was going on church was eating it up but uh i got to say this i said i'm encouraged by the word of god this morning we came to prayer and right after prayer i got this text from sister keisha so good to see you sister keisha i appreciate you [Applause] brother caleb was accessed last night about we read the bible together as a church we got a bible app and we read the bible together there's something about if we all stay in one accord we will see and and hear the voice of god from from from us reading together i just wonder if anybody got a chance to read the devotion for today anybody got a chance okay couple people [Music] this devotion that was wrote for today i wrote it three years ago three years ago but it happened to come up today and maybe what i want to do rather than read the devotion let me read the scripture that goes with it and brother caleb i'll give you a second here but um hey guy chapter two [Music] um yeah hey guys chapter two let's read verse seven this just so happened to be our reading for this day [Music] and i will shake all nations and the desire of all nations shall come and i will fill this house with glory saith the lord of hosts the silver is mine and the gold is mine said the lord of hosts the glory of this latter house shall be greater [Music] than other former [Music] saith the lord of hosts amen uh and in this place will i give peace saith the lord of hosts now you know when i read that and three years ago after i read that i i wrote a devotion you know over those scriptures and devotion that i wrote i said the glory of the latter house is promised to be greater than the former house the children of israel experienced that but god's promises can be applied in all generations and this is my final statement i said therefore i am under expectation and i am claiming this for our first church building the glory of owning will be greater than renting [Music] [Applause] [Music] so when the devil think he already he got you cornered in he don't realize prophecy has already gone forth before you got to that spot hallelujah if you abide in me and my words abide in you you can ask what you will and it shall be done it's not a maybe it's not a might but it shall god promised it i say the glory of ownership is going to be greater than the glory of renting [Music] sister keisha sent me that and i was just so encouraged i hadn't got to my bible reading for the day yet and when i looked and saw the date and i said this is god god knew that that scripture would be on this day knowing that it was our last day here you tell me god ain't already ordered our steps we're going to walk by faith and not by sight i'm encouraged i am really encouraged hallelujah brother caleb come share what you had in your heart of all i think it's an honor that i get to be here on the last service and this place and when i kept saying that if i never get to come back here i kept thinking there's something funny about that statement but i'm gonna tell you what i the lord told me what it was when i said they're feeding off your anointing because i heard him say and when they're gone there'll be no more anointing here so you and then that scripture what did it say i will shake all nations can we put that back up because that just right there on the money when i say i will shake all nations and and the desire of all nations shall come and i will fill this house with glory when this house moves all nations around here will shake up and you know what i'm talking about when you're living off of anointing that's not your own you're gonna find out you needed something that that other person had i just wanted to say that the lord told me that and i was about to say something to you and i said no shut up that's not my time because you had to say it so don't you just love it how are you going to get up here and talk about speaking the word and different things and think god's not going to talk to you the difference is he gives you thus say of the lord or you keep quiet he didn't tell me to say nothing so i didn't so when he brought it out i said man i knew it and i got all excited you're right i got wound up late but i'm proud of you i'm proud of you and i'm proud of all of you and i'm proud to be an association with the spirit of truth tabernacle you remember that amazing grace tabernacle's praying for you and i can't wait to share the story because it's the same story i too went to a meeting in tucson and brother muskrat spoke and that was the final what he said was the final straw i said i've got to go that's why i was like what and two years later [Music] i started my church and something happened that made it very uncomfortable and the lord told me get out of my way so i got to do what i got to do here and i made the announcement and i was on my way and the rest is history same thing so i'm going to go back and tell brother david i'm going to call brother moses you know two churches that you may not approve of cut that out god started because god used you brother to encourage two misfits to black sheep to people that nobody wanted to get out and do something because god wants people to do what he commands them you are my friend if you do what i command you [Applause] [Music] hallelujah this has been uh that's it that's it it was already written the prophecy was there see when you're meditating on the word and you're thinking well god just kind of inspire you and at the moment you're not you're not even aware what you're doing but here you know the exact day i wrote this and on the exact day that we reach here god gives us that scripture and gives those words of inspiration so i i and and like i said the glory of ownership gonna be better than written so we're not looking to continue to rent we're looking to own that's where that's where our that's where our faith is the lord's already been providing and making ways we just need god to open up the door and last night you were talking and lord y'all just y'all bear with me uh [Music] uh but as as uh brother caleb was just sharing how um there was a man that he was he needed to get the property from that man didn't want nothing to do with it that man just didn't want to do nothing just this week i had a meeting with a pastor that we want to try to buy as church and and and and you know we just i had sat down and took him to lunch and you know tried to just do whatever i could but we had a really really good conversation and and um and you know in the conversation you know he was saying that i'm not really sure if we want to sell and say for group y'all styles are gonna be gonna cost a lot of money i say well you know little as much when god is in it and i say if uh you know just just put some numbers down and let's see where things go from there you know and uh you know and then he um told me about this experience that he went to church and he preached and when he got there to the church it was a a predominantly black congregation and he goes into the church and uh and he says um he read the scripture the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man a veil of much so he heard the church rise up kind of the way that y'all doing here rise up read it again brother he ain't know what to do with that so you see just read it again and as he reads the factual fervent prayer of a righteous man i fell as much and i'm sitting here listening to him so you don't realize we've been in days of prayer we've been praying before i even start to meet with you we have been praying eight days straight and you tell it you're speaking it out of your own mouth the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much i mean you don't you say you don't want to sell but god will give you a dream god will give you a vision god will shake you somehow sell the church to that group right there i'm under expectation i i came here to church thinking that he might walk in here today and say pastor god told me to give you the church that's kind of the kind of faith i got [Music] don't even know where the church at but i'm led by the spirit i'm under i'm under look we that we've been preaching about the the junctions and at the junctions we're supposed to expect a supernatural [Music] every junction you have to expect supernatural so this is our junction the seven junction is our junction and we're expecting god to do something supernatural amen if it was natural we could do it but if it's supernatural he's got to do it hallelujah well god well god so um i want to just have a word of prayer and and um i'll need to meet with the church and and um you know just kind of give you all just an update [Music] and um and then we'll we'll you know we'll we'll be we'll be moving on from there but um i did want to say for brothers we're gonna need uh your your help here just to kind of get things packed up and and i want to um thank the lord just a couple of people that that that i need to thank god for brother uh josue and brother quentin brother jeffrey um uh you know brother jose and brother clinton been working in the background doing a lot of the business things getting it getting it done it's just it feels good that pastor ain't got to be running around doing all of that but god got brothers that is anointed to do what they're doing and i was telling brothers way about you know packing up and getting and you

ways in your open doors that we can't see that you'll provide my prayers that you would keep us all united we know the enemy would love to get in the midst of something like this but keep us all united binding together may love lord keep us bound together and father we just asked that you would just continue to bless all that we set our hands to do thank you for all the scriptures that were given the people the saints were praying and god just saw just looking at all of that and just hearing your voice through the word even to get down to this point this very day three years ago you had us write something that the glory of ownership will be greater than the glory of renting we wrote it by faith and here we are ready to walk out and possess the land that you have before us we know god that you promised in your word that you were gonna plant us in the land where we would never be plucked up again and we're under expectation that you will do what you said you would do we're gonna abide in you because you told us if you bother me my words about you that you can ask what you will and god we're sending the word to go before us open up the doors amen open up the way father for us
