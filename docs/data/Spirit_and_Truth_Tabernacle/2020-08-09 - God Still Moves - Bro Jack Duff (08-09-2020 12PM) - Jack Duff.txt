that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit and his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper amen this is the word of the lord we read that over our precious sister's business and amen believe that whatever she has set her hands to do it will prosper let's just pray father we come before your presence underneath the anointing of this song god you told us that you would supply all of our needs according to your riches in glory you'll give your angels charge over us and you'll keep us lord in all of our ways you told us that whatever we do god with our hands that it shall prosper lord so we pray over this business that you have given our precious sister god we committed back to you today we asked lord that you would send the customers that you would meet not only the needs of a business lord but as she's going and contacting different people lord let her be lord like a beacon of light like a lighthouse that goes into the midst of darkness and offers hope to so many god may you bless her as she blesses others lord god we ask that you would get all the glory that you would get all the honor out of this business and father we just commit it now to you thank you for giving it to her but we give it back to you oh god and we place it upon your word knowing father oh god that the leaf would not wither and whatever she does it will prosper wherever the business expands it will prosper every idea that you give her it will prosper father we commit it now into your capable hands knowing father that you'll supply every need according to your riches in glory you are jehovah jireh you are our provider and we thank you lord for what you've done it's in jesus name that we pray amen amen amen amen praise the lord glory he will give his angels charge of you jehovah jair carey for me for me for me jehovah's ira careth for me let's give the lord a hand of praise oh blessed be the name of the lord thank you jesus amen you can be seated in the presence of the lord uh she's got a couple announcements and now i heard sister tina did you have a song that they called you last service did you have one for this service oh he made a mistake okay all right all right no problem uh let me give you the announcements um we want to wish a happy birthday to sister uh dershna a man uh she's celebrating her birthday on the 12th on wednesday the 12th so we wish her happy birthday uh also brother troy be celebrating her birthday on friday august 14th so we wish him also a happy birthday uh this morning he was asked to go and minister in okeechobee um was supposed to be there last week but because of the storm they had canceled the service but he went out this morning and we're very grateful that the lord is using him a man out there in okeechobee uh so celebrate he'll be celebrating a birthday on this friday and we certainly uh wish him a happy birthday also we'll continue to do what we have been doing with our wednesday night services and and i tell you um i want to make sure church that we remain uh engaged and focused uh it's so easy uh to kind of start letting other things get into our calendar especially on wednesday nights say man well we're not coming to the house lord but i want to encourage you just please block out all the distractions and and just stay focused on receiving the word of god amen even though you're not might not be coming to the house of the lord but it'll be important don't let anything get into your your your calendar uh like that and it's just just important to stay focused amen especially in this season so but we'll continue amen to do this as we um as we navigate through this these times that we've never walked through before but we believe god has been bringing us through and and he'll continue to bring us through amen so just keep that in mind uh also um sunday services will continue to have our 9 a.m and 12 p.m service and amen we uh uh thank god for uh the lord just meeting us at uh at these different times uh this this thursday we'll be starting our outreach new outreach opportunity that god has given us in um it's a the actual the name of the place uh is called twin lakes amen the name of the the little development that we'll be going in it's called twin lakes right off skis road and we'll be doing a outreach a pantry that has been given to us a church as a church and i and i want to just mention to all the ones that will be involved there there's a lot of food that's involved in here but you know we have to go with a really really good reputation amongst them they don't want to see us come and take from them they want us giving to them and and i want to just encourage everyone that gets involved please don't take anything unless they actually specifically say but they're watching us they're watching us so we got to be very very careful with how we go out and conduct ourselves we have to build trust and uh you know let's let's do it with excellence amen we're going to operate with excellence when we go out there and uh but i'm thinking this is just an opportunity for the church we we give food physically but ultimately we're trying to get food spiritually and we want to be able to invite people to come to this church and you know where they can hear the word of god and and things of that nature so that is our hope that's that's our desire we know everybody that comes through the line might not come to church but god is looking for that one seed amen so we want to do everything we can to be ready to welcome them here to the house of the lord so keep that in mind uh also uh so thursday the 13th four o'clock is the time that we'll meet there uh if you desire to help out please let us know uh i access the tina just to kind of spearhead this and and primary reason the sister team had already been working in this way with uh feeding the homeless a man she was taking food out to the park there in um uh lake worth and you know had been doing it faithfully nobody knew that she was out there doing it but uh but we knew and i said you know what somebody with a heart like that would be a perfect person just kind of spearhead something like this so i'm asking her just kind of lead it up and and uh and i believe that it'll just be a blessing we just want to kind of come alongside her and just work with her and help her a man to be successful in this as she's representing the church you know in this in this endeavor so uh please uh if you if you desire to join uh just be if you can't make it every thirds but maybe you say first thirst i can be there a second thursdays i can be there third thursday or fourth thursday if you have a thursday in your on your mind that you think you can make it you can commit to it let us know we can put a little plan together as we'll know who to expect and when to expect them a man uh they're volunteering for this so god bless you amen on that our services will be starting this weekend uh brother nathan from uh indiana will be coming down and ministering we've been talking for some time about him coming and doing another prayer line and uh when this pandemic kind of struck i just didn't know how we'd be able to do it i was really thinking about canceling the services and and uh the lord just kind of put in my spirit no let's just go forward with it and let's make it a virtual prayer line so what'll happen amen it'll be kind of a um what what i call a hybrid uh those that are here in the house of god if you got a very specific request that you need and you want to go through the prayer line whatever it is we we're going to allow you to do that but those that are not able to make it to the house of god those that might be joining online because of the social distancing we want you to submit your requests online we have our app amen if you've downloaded our church app uh the new app the new church

got a request from someone just saying that you know they're asking god to touch their body they had a stroke and now they want god to reverse that stroke i said we believe in god with them amen these are the requests that we're we're we're trusting god's going to do something mighty i mean he's a he's he's he's a he's a he's a present tense god and he still moves amen even today so uh but we we want to want to pray brother brother nathan has come here and and um i remember a couple years ago he prayed for sister tanya she couldn't move her shoulder and uh she went home that night after they prayed and there she began to move her shoulder and do things that she couldn't do before so about a year later she remembered his prayer and we went there to indiana and she said i remember him praying for him before now i got this cancer that i'm dealing with and i want to be prayed for again so uh she went on and got got in the prayer line and he got she got prayed for and about two days later she went to the doctor supposed to have the thing removed but before she could get to the doctor's office god had already taken the cancer off of her head amen god proved that he's the same yesterday today and forever so uh we believe god is gonna move him sister tony was telling me yes i should say that was three years ago that god did that and i remember when brother nathan came multiple testimonies and i know it's not brother nathan but it's god hearing his prayer amen and i and i believe that as we come together underneath this anointing god's gonna do some things and i'm just trusting those that are not able to join us that god's gonna meet them right where they are so just we actually please submit your request online we want to pray for it as if you were sitting

um what god getting ready to do on next week amen amen i i got confidence that god gonna do something special and i just prayed it will all come under expectation uh i wanted to um i'll read a scripture but i want to just take a title amen um to this uh this this afternoon service god still moves amen god still moves and um if in in all actuality this would be like testimonies during covet 19 part two uh amen but uh but you know god has been doing some great things and and i just wanted to just take some time to share uh some of this with you and i pray that it'll be an encouragement to your heart but i want to read a man of scripture uh uh before we just kind of break into some of these testimonies let's just turn in our bibles to matthew chapter 8 amen glory to god matthew chapter 8 and we'll start reading at verse 5. all right matthew chapter 8 um reading here verse 5 it says wait a minute i'm sorry i i turned to the wrong script to myself i got i got mark 8 matthew eight amen all right it says and when jesus was entered into capernaum that came unto him a centurion beseeching him i'm saying lord my servant lies at home sick of the palsy grievously tormented amen this man was at home praise the lord and and this is the scripture that the lord gave me for um this prayer line amen um what what is going on in the scripture says my servant uh lieth at home sick of the policy grievously tormented and jesus said unto him i will come and heal him the centurion answered and said lord i am not worthy that thou should has come under my roof but speak the word only amen hallelujah amen speak the word uh only and my servant shall be healed for i am a man under authority having soldiers under me and i say to this man go when he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it when jesus heard it he marveled and said to them that father verily i say unto you i have not found so great faith no not in israel this was what we call gentile faith and i say unto you that many shall come from the east and west and shall sit down with abraham and isaac and jacob and the kingdom of heaven but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth and jesus said unto the centurion go thy way and as thou has believed so be it done unto thee and his servant was healed in the self-same hour amen the lord had a blessing to the reading of his word amen let's just bow in a quick word of prayer father we thank you for uh your word as we have read it uh we trust god that you would just make it clear to us for the season in which we're living speak to our hearts god be glorified and magnified with the thought that's being shared prepare us lord for what you're about to do lord in our midst uh you have moved for many years you have demonstrated and showed yourself lord so strong uh in our midst but god we ask that you move once more and we pray father that uh through your word today that we'll catch a glimpse lord of what you're trying to do in this season it's in jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you can be seated in the presence of the lord man praise the lord so uh again our title here is god still moves and man god still moves i want to just uh open up with a little uh quote here from make the valley full of ditches and man make the valley full of ditches it's a little testimony that the prophet is sharing a man about a particular lady by the name of miss weber and it says a lady in my church uh brother biller miss weber she was dying with tb hallelujah we're trying to reach people that might feel like they're maybe the doctor has given up on them telling there's no hope for the situation that they got uh i i'm here to tell you that the doctor is doing the best that he can a man the doctor has gone to school and his knowledge has limited a man to only so much when it comes to working with the body and working with patients and we appreciate the doctors we thank god for them but they're human beings just like us and there are sometimes we face situations that amen it goes beyond the doctors amen abilities glory to god and we need a god that can come on the scene and change things around so if you're in a situation where the doctors have given up on you i don't care what it is amen if they've given up on you god is able to turn that thing around we say he still moves amen we say he still heals we say he still delivers and and we're not just saying that we've seen it with our own eyes amen and and hallelujah we're not limited to somebody being able to come here and pass through a prayer line we got something even greater amen than somebody touching you with their hands amen we got the spoken word of god amen and if we just speak the word only we can see somebody made whole hallelujah glory to god i believe that so look at this amen now this woman uh that that i'm reading about she was never touched in a prayer line i mean not not when she got healed maybe she had been prayed for before and i believe the quote is going to show she had been prayed for before and she was she was hoping that maybe he just prayed for me one more time hallelujah watch this now watch this testimony says uh miss webber she was dying with tb she was in us in the sanatorium at the last stages they sent her home to die and said there's nothing could be done for her miss grace webb in jeffersonville she lived just beyond the tabernacle and she got five she got five or six little children so the angel of the lord come to me that night and said go tell miss webber tell tell mr webber rather to get things ready for he's gonna be left with those children on his hands for his wife's going now the angel is telling brother branham the man's wife is about to leave what a what a statement now i want you to get this because as you read this you must see in scripture hezekiah was told the same thing by prophet isaiah he said say get your i mean you're going to be you might as well get your house in order you're going to be dying hezekiah turned his face to the wall and began to pray say god i did this now he didn't he wasn't saying god i will do this he said god i have done this i walked up right before you i did this i did that i'm not ready to die and and and then then all of a sudden the prophet turns and goes back to hezekiah the king and says god heard your prayer amen god heard your prayer and he's given you 15 more years i want to tell you god has heard your prayer amen god is here to respond to whatever your needs are glory god has watch your fasting god has seen these things god is ready to do what only god can do look at this amen it says uh says uh uh she lived just beyond the time so an angel lord came uh come to me the night and said go tell miss webber tell mr webber rather to get things ready for he's going to be left with those children on his hand for his wife's going well i went and told mr webber i uh i told his little girl little gene rose it says which is a nurse now she was a little bitty fella then she's a young lady now it's been seven years ago or more i said now genie your mother's going to die she can't live but a little while longer and two days after that or three days there were some ladies from the government depot there where she worked come in she's say uh grace miss webber said if i could only have brother bill to pray for me once more hallelujah she said i sing when my cousin opal was healed with that cancer and the doctor just gave her till morning till it her faith was still holding on even though the angel of the lord has pronounced through the prophet that she gonna die amen if that was a sure death that was certainly a sure death but this lady's faith is still holding on maybe everybody else around her her husband is preparing for her death her daughter is preparing for her death everybody around her is preparing for her death but she's staying on the inside if he could just pray i know the angel of the lord told you that i was gonna die but still if you can just pray for me one more time brother branham i've seen what god did before i know he's able to do the same thing for me if he did it for my cousin why can't he do it for me hallelujah says i seen when my cousin opal was healed with that cancer the doctor just gave her till morning to live and her daughter's a nurse also said the girls from out of that government where she worked with her said there ain't nothing to that guy so now she said she's saying i wish brother brandon could come and then they start saying ain't nothing to brother branham they start talking about them amen i know you've been in conversations where people begin to talk about the prophets ain't nothing to him he's off he's this he's that amen everybody got something to say but look at this now amen it says uh uh uh there ain't nothing to that guy said he isn't nothing but a hypocrite so that's all that a religion is it's just a bunch of fake fanaticism and so miss webber said what you gonna say when they start talking like that what's your response to that right so miss weber said look i'm a dying and i know that but i just won't stand still for that she said i know better than that she said i live right here around this city around the man all the time i seen him from a child growed up she said i know said you can call it fake if you want to she said but i but i've seen him so much and seeing god heal the people she said i know the man's life and i know it's the truth that was a testimony you got to have a testimony in the midst of all the criticism everybody else said it so you can she can say that because she's seen it with own eyes i'm not telling you what i heard i'm telling you what i experienced look at this so and it happened the prophet says and it happened to be the angel the lord heard that the angel heard a conversation the angel lord heard that and that very night sitting on the side of my chair in the room after i got up went and got a drink of water about 3 o'clock in the morning and sitting on a chair i seen him come walking through the door the angel he said tomorrow sunday and they're going to pick miss webber up bring her down she'll be sitting on the right side right hand side far back in the tabernacle say i heard her and tell her i heard her what she said let me tell you something the angel can hear negative and the angel can hear positive if you'll speak positive you'll please the angel glory to god hallelujah amen even this week say something positive even this week think something positive god will hear that god will send his age on the scene praise god the prophet never went to her house the angel was there we might not be able to come to your house but god can come there god can make the difference god will make the difference look at this hallelujah he says he says uh uh uh uh say they're gonna pick up pick up miss webber bring her down she'll be sitting on the right hand side fall back in the tab and i can say i heard her tell her i heard her what she said tell her thus saith the lord she'll live and not die and the very reason that this lady is living is because of her attitude towards god's prophets glory to god her attitude towards the word of god maybe people say the days of miracle has passed we say the days of miracles is still here god still moves what's your attitude amen in the midst of all this look at this glory glory it says uh uh she'll live and not die see there you are you can go down and see her if you like been uh like two been about seven years ago all right says uh see his presence was there when she was taken up for what was right see his presence was there and he found her so he come and told me what she had said what she said to these women said and he had respect to her because she had respect unto what was representing god glory prophet not here miss webinar here but we here and if you have respect to what's representing god i believe god will here amen your prayer i really believe that it says so god will do the same thing for you not to respect to me but to respect to him to christ the one who died for your healing if you just give respect to him and his word god will do the work for you amen that's right now when you when you when you when you look at that uh brother branham never went to pray for her again that she desired for him to say you know if you just pray for me one more time after hearing um uh you're gonna die thus says the lord lady you're gonna die if your family need to get themselves in order your husband needs to get in order the kids need to get ready they're gonna lose mama thus saith the lord and she knew that that prophet didn't make mistakes but she said if you just pray for me just one more time because i seen my cousin get well i watched god heal my cousin they had gave her up and she only had one more day to live one more night but she made it through the night perfectly amen perfectly whole he said she said if if god can do that for my cousin i believe he can do the same thing for me she held on to her faith no matter what she hurt oh what faith what faith church right and and god needs people to have that same type of faith if you want to see god do something amen you got to have your faith elevated glory to god hallelujah glory glory glory amen look at this uh this this is quoting the message why hallelujah glory and this message white says i don't care what it is if you say to the mountain be moved and maybe if you got to go over the mountain for a purpose now i say well somebody would say oh i'm a great man of faith i i moved that mountain it will never move it's not going to happen like that it's got to be the right motive it says but if there's something over the mountain that you've got to get over there for to do the will of god and you can't get over it under it around it yet something in your heart is telling you to go you speak the word don't you doubt glory and maybe when you speak the word only one little grain of sand will fall but it's on its road the next day a spoonful may drop the next amen uh the next day a teacup full you will never notice it but if you'll just hold steady hallelujah after you prayed for we want to tell you something hold steady hold standing to what god promised you he was wounded for your transgressions he was bruised for your iniquities the chastisement of your peace is upon him and with his stripes you are healed oh steady he's the lord our god that healeth all of our diseases hold steady don't give up on the word of god no matter how you feel no matter what you think no matter what the doctor's report says hold steady to what god said in his word hallelujah whose report will you believe we believe the report of the lord it says the next day a spoonful may drop the next dead teacup full you will notice it say you you will never notice it but if you were just hold steady knowing that it's being done after a while the whole thing will fall in so that's the way it is by divine healing when you see the working of the holy spirit the word laid on and the holy spirit anointing that word and proving it that he is there in our midst to vindicate himself and to give you the promise then you then you accept your healing i like that word amen accept your healing i was looking at that so to accept something requires action amen it's not something mentally you say i accept my healing no it's amen it's something that requires action hallelujah glory glory glory glory you know uh last year uh brother nathan king and uh and he prayed every year we've seen some some something happen with this ministry you know we can we can go back and and and sometimes you know we we we we forget hallelujah but last year he came and remember he prayed for uh brother joe underwood amen and and uh sister rebecca they weren't able to have children for a number of years and he prayed for him and after prayer just a simple prayer hallelujah now a man brother joe is sending pictures and sister rebecca sending pictures of the baby that god gave them after prayer hallelujah glory to god we saw god do that here amen church we should not be doubting anything we ain't got to wait to feel nothing god is moving in services like this so i'm on the expectation that god getting to do something else so mighty glory to god the testimony is going to continue to come pour in amen so to accept it it requires action if uh if you needed a ride amen uh to go somewhere you didn't have a vehicle or transportation to get there and i was to offer you a ride in order for you to accept the ride you got to get in the car hey man you can't be standing on the outside talk about uh yeah i accept it brother jack yes i'd like to go with you i've offered you the opportunity to get in the car but you ain't getting in you ain't done nothing with the opportunity you must get in the car put on your seat belt and let's go for a ride that shows that you have accepted it amen if you've been if somebody purchased you a gift accept it by taking it saying thank you and then opening the gift it requires action amen you have to receive it and you have to do something with it as you pass through that prayer line accept your healing tell god thank you lord i thank you for healing me i thank you for changing my situation i thank you for this hallelujah as you accept it you'll see god manifest himself you all remember the testimony of john ryan john ryan accepted his healing he accepted and didn't even know what he accepted he got up to went across the prayer line and and it says uh you know brother branham said brother you're healed you know you healed and uh uh do you believe it said yes i believe it they say all right brother just go on and just just keep thanking god so uh john ryan went on and they realized man my eyes ain't came open yet you said i was here but my eyes and came open and said i'm going back to the prayer line so he got up in the prayer line he said sir you told me that i was healed and and that uh this and that he said yeah yeah you said you believed it he said i do believe it you say well well something missing here there's a gap uh you said i was healed i said i believe but what's the gap here he said well what you need to do is go start thanking god every day for for healing you just say praise the lord for healing me i mean just keep thank god so in between the gap of god's promise and and the gap of your belief is your praise oh come on somebody amen in between the gap of the promise amen in the gap of your belief is your praise you got to keep praising god no matter how you feel no matter what the situation is you gotta still give god the praise john ryan said extra extra read all about it buying stripes i'm healed day after day after day extra extra read all about it buying stripes i'm here went for weeks just confessing the word of god got to the barber shop and the bob obama said now john you making a man uh you're making the gospel look really bad you're giving a really bad testimony by telling everybody that you healed and you know you're still as blind as you was he said he said no extra extra read all about it buying stripes i'm healed jumped up went running out of the barbershop baba amen god got all of his goods running behind him saying man what you doing you're going to get hit by a cop he said no i told you by stripes i'm healing brother i am healed i can see it came because of his praise glory to god to accept something it's gonna require some action so no matter what the trial can continue to declare your position on the word of god amen amen amen let me give you this quote who is god amen paragraph e35 and who is god keep confessing the word of god no matter what it is and when the inspiration the holy spirit is here to inspire you remember god will make your body come into your confession glory to god if you say you're a drunkard and want to want to drink don't worry you'll soon be one so if you're thinking negative amen it'll bring that negative thought to pass but if you're thinking positive it's going to bring that positive thought to past if you say you're a sinner and want to sin you'll be right into it if you say you're a christian believe it all alone god will bring your your testimony your testimony will bring you right into it if you believe in healing and believe that god has healed you confess it and god will make your body i love that statement god will make your body that that mean you don't even have to do it the only thing god wants you to do is just keep confessing and as you keep confessing god will make your body obey your confession oh hallelujah glory glory glory thank you jesus amen glory i command my hands to praise the lord i command my feet to praise the lord i command my mouth you're gonna praise god i command my body praise the lord i command my spirit brother i'm taking control over the situation amen i'm gonna speak it out of my mouth whether i feel it or don't feel it i'm saying it because god said it and god will make my body come in line with my confession praise god hallelujah glory to god amen god still moves he's the same yesterday that day and forever glory to god thank you jesus hallelujah glory glory he says god will make your body obey your confession for he's the high priest of your confession sitting at the right hand of the father now with his own blood to make intercessions for any confession upon anything that he died for hallelujah and he died to rid sin and sickness is a result of sin he was wounded for our transgressions with the stripes we are healed remember that have faith don't waver stand on it stand on it god is good it's a testimony that i heard this is something i believe that happened uh just some a little time some time ago a couple years ago but yet i thought it would be very uh helpful to us um it's a brother by the name of barry johnson from calgary canada and uh he was at a meeting and uh i believe he says about brother kelly's meeting last february a year says good morning brother god bless you i was really encouraged with your service this week what's in our hand so brother preach the message what's that in your hand we hear that song here what's that in your hand and that song has been anointed every time a sister michelle saying what's that in your hand right because whatever you got in your hand god say i can use it but you got to be willing to lose it take the little you have god will make it grand amen right so he said i appreciate the sermon you preached what's in your in in our hand prayer he said prayers in our hand says not sure if i have expressed to you what happened the last time we saw you in saskatchewan at brother kelly's he's uh this is a a testimony he sent it to brother darrell ward amen lord we pray for brother daryl him and his wife and children have been suffering from covet but we rebuke covet right now in the name of jesus in the midst of your servant amen we rebuke it in jesus name we we send the word to tennessee for brother daryl and all the other saints that are suffering we send the word to them in the name of jesus amen the fever is broken in jesus name amen amen amen hallelujah glory to god it says um um you had prayer for my my three-year-old son who had a condition of having some kind of lung issue that caused pneumonia every year of his life from a baby says now this year of all the years this year of covet the pandemic because you know this everybody with underlying conditions amen you got to be careful because covet can get you and kobe can get anybody right but but the ones with underlying conditions they really put you on the fear amen but you don't have to be that way god that god god has not given you the spirit of fear right he says now this year of all the years there was no sickness at all came through our house over the winter of all the years he said no sickness at all no i mean where this this young boy has his lung issue did not experience it this year so a year where he would have been amen what we would call uh a high risk amen god took the risk out of it all together glory to god no issue at all during this year there was no sickness that at all came through our house over the winter since you prayed christopher had had no issue god is good god still moves god still moves amen i got a another little uh uh testimony here i want to share and god just help us i got so much in my heart that i want to give you uh this was coming from brother sean martin amen uh he says uh and this is something that happened years ago he says i remember when my daughter ann was born without a hip socket 15 years ago see the doctor told us that she would need surgery right away in order for her to ever walk but said that in spite of the surgery she would always walk with a limp hallelujah says uh he's scheduled for us to see a specialist my wife was to take her to see the specialist on a thursday uh and and and so the wednesday night before our church prayed for her brother wayne and i were on the road at that time in texas and we were praying as well when the specialist came in the room to check on her he had the original x-ray that showed there was no hip socket but as he began to probe on her hip he thought something seemed unusual and so he brought in another doctor and after probing around he too seemed puzzled so they decided to do their own x-ray and what they saw was that god had created a hip socket glory god still moves say ann is 15 years old and walks normal with absolutely no problem whatsoever there is absolutely nothing too hard for our lords i'm talking about what god did 15 years ago the girl is still walking around the doctor saying you're gonna have a limp if you do walk hallelujah but god say no that's not the way i made her body she's not gonna have no lips she's gonna be perfectly made whole see the doctor's only going by what he can see but god can go beyond what the doctor can see stinging amen this other testimony comes to my mind uh brother tim pruitt is he said he had a grandson that that uh had not walked a man uh by the time he turned one years old he still wasn't walking wasn't talking or anything like that and um and and and some kind of way uh they they the family uh his daughter ended up at his house for for a little season while they was building the house and one morning the mama wasn't feeling well his brother tim's uh uh wife wasn't feeling well and and said usually she get up when he get up but just not this morning she didn't get up so you know i think they kind of uh start looking around and trying to figure out what's going on and and uh brother tim uh his daughter came and said i think you better come check on mama because something right something writing with mama so uh the mama started talking about this this really bad headache that she was having and just a lot a lot of pain and everything so they kind of then they took it to the doctor found out she had some high blood pressure and and all these other things that was contributing but she's just really having a lot of problems so um you know there at the time uh brother tim said you know what uh we're gonna have a service on a wednesday night he's saying this wednesday night i feel like gonna be a deliverance service they had a guest speaker i believe brother wayne lawson was coming to preach he said we're gonna we're gonna have a deliverance service and he said he say uh uh he'll say i know y'all because the very day that he was supposed to have a service wife start feeling bad again and so he took it back to the doctor and the doctor prescribed something else and say you know what i don't know say something right he said but i'm gonna tell y'all what say ain't nobody's staying at home with mama tonight he said nobody's staying at home with mama tonight he said i said we're gonna have church and it's gonna be a deliberate service i spoke that by faith so we're not staying home we taking mom in the church he said they took people on cots to brother brown's meetings we're gonna take mama with pillars and everything to the house of the lord he said he popped up in the office amen and had to sit there and just get comfortable and had a prayer line after the brother preaching after they had the prayer line just waiting for the anointing to come hallelujah and when anointed came he went and called his wife at the office said we're going to pray for you right now she began to worship and praise god and hadn't she didn't have to take another blood pressure pill after that service glory and not only that because the anointing was so strong the anointing produced a man walking capabilities with a grandson god but god touched him as well see when god delivers god delivers he said that same prayer line a sister come and stood in the gap for her brother that had backslid and they say uh the boy was walking had to walk away from the lord and not serving the lord just out doing all kinds of things say after they prayed the girl stood in line after the prayer said the boy got in his car they don't say the holy spirit went to where he was see you ain't got to be here the word will come after you amen speak the word only and the word will come after you and make the difference say the word guidance came to the church broke down in tears just crying repenting and been in the church ever since that time we talk about what god's doing right now god still moves [Applause] god still moves before i go further and amen some of these other testimonies that i want to share uh this story came to me this week in in in our bible reading in second kings 19. i want to just read this uh really quick but it's a story of this this great general by the name of rabsheka uh who went from assyria uh he went there to israel to just kind of tell them look we're coming to take over this place he was coming on behalf of the king said we're coming to take over now if y'all want to come out and serve us it'll be peaceful but uh if if if you're not going to just drop your arms and come on out of service it's going to be some trouble and he would just kind of tell them you know just different things just to try to instill fear in the people of israel and uh he was just giving all kind of threats and and some of the leaders of israel approached this rap sheka and said please just speak to us in the syrian language we understand don't don't keep saying that in front of all the people uh but the man said i i know i i came here to talk to him in their language because i want them to understand how serious this is he refused to speak in the syrian language he's beginning to speak more boldly about the plans of taking over israel he told uh he told the people saying now y'all better not listen to hezekiah king i know he's probably trying to encourage all a man to uh to believe in god and and do all these things say but you better not listen to him you better be listening to me but hezekiah already told the people glory to god no matter what this man say don't respond whoo can i can i uh can i tell you no matter what your doctor say don't respond come on somebody amen no matter what the reports say don't respond praise the name of the lord i don't care how negative it is don't respond hallelujah if they say this running your family don't respond to that praise god amen you ought to tell them say well i'm in a higher family than this i come from a different bloodline than this i come from god and i'm going back to god hallelujah glory to god so he said don't don't give him no response now just let him say whatever you're going to say but don't respond so rabb shekhar told the people don't trust in god uh uh uh he said just make an agreement with us and and come on out to the king the king of assyria everything would be right and then he made the steam say he says he asked them i boast we say he says what have the gods of hammond the gods of our path the god of severe sephiroth the gods of henna the gods of iva or samaria been able to do and delivering their people from us what what did the god of those cities do and i noticed that this was six cities that he called out amen he called the hammeth our path uh henna iva and samaria but now you're dealing with the seventh glory to god you're dealing with israel nah hallelujah you're dealing with gods amen complete number here you can't touch this group now hallelujah i don't care what the rest of them amen whatever their testimony was maybe somebody got the same condition that you have and maybe amen maybe they didn't make it through that does not mean that does not mean that you won't make it through hallelujah sometime the devil liked to boast like that i took this one out i took that one out but they weren't serving the god that i'm serving they weren't standing on the same promise that i'm standing on hallelujah rabsheka returned to syria and when he got they found that they were warring against libna amen and and and not only a warrant against libna but uh also he heard that the king of ethiopia is about to come against him now here's what what happened a man when they when when when he left i want to pick this up in second kings 19 verse 1 through seven hallelujah let's just read this really quick says it came to pass when king hezekiah heard it that he ran his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of lord is there a better place to go amen when you get bad news go to the house of god because things can change there in the house of god it says it went into the house lord and it said eliakim which was over the household and shebna described and the elders of the priests covet with sackcloth to isaiah the prophet the son of amos amen so i mean i need a word from the lord so i'm going to a vindicated prophet to get this word from the lord it says and they said unto him thus saith hezekiah this day is a day of trouble and of rebuke and blasphemy for the children are come to the birth and there is not uh and there is not strength to bring forth it may be the lord that god will hear all the words of raph sheikha whom the king of assyria's master have sent to reproach the living god and will reprove the words which the lord thy god hath heard where wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that are left so they want isaiah to pray so the servants of king hezekiah came to isaiah and isaiah said unto them thus shall ye say to your master thus saith the lord be not afraid can i tell you that amen today i don't care what the report is be not afraid glory be not afraid of the words which i has heard and which the servants of the kingdom of assyria hath blasphemed me i like this statement behold i will send a blast upon him and he shall hear a rumor and shall return to his own land and i will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land now you know after ra after this was prophesied rabb shekhar went and he heard about the battle uh there with assyria uh fighting libna and then he heard ethiopia was coming and even in the mid cities two uh great countries coming against him he still sent a second letter to hezekiah saying we're coming over there to take over but god had already given a promise through a prophet that you ain't coming back here i like this you know uh when when hezekiah got the second letter he went right back and prayed again and god heard his prayer and isaiah told him uh uh he told him a couple of things that i'd love to just repeat to you he said one when he says i'm gonna turn back he said i will turn thee back by the way which thou came and so however that devil came he may come in one way but he gonna flee seven ways diabetes man come one way but it'll flee seven ways high blood pressure may have come one way but it'll flee seven ways cancer may have come one way better to flee seven ways it says i will turn thee back by the way which thou came is and the other promise they say i'm gonna defend this city so they say it's hello you ain't gotta worry about it i'm gonna take care of this battle for you god say i'm gonna defend this city i'm gonna defend your body i'm gonna make your body come in line with your confession god gonna do this god gonna do this see rab sheck as i was reading this this week he just kind of reminded me of cancer so sometimes you know and this is why the prophet was told by the angels say if you can just get the people to believe not even cancer would stand before your prayer and i had a quote but i don't have time to read it all but you know you'll find it in god revealing himself to his people brother branham said when the angel told him that the very first case he went out to pray for was a woman with cancer a nurse that had cancer he's saying god heal that lady of cancer she still she was still living at that time so so god i mean god god specifically called the name cancer you know a lot of people today that's what they fighting cancer cancer and sometimes when you get it especially when they tell you oh you got four states you got four immediately when you're in four stages that mean you're on your deathbed you don't have much longer to live but you know we got brother nathan coming next week and his mama had four stage cancer oh can i just testify just a little bit amen remember his his his his his uh is his uh he went to tell his family that you know mama got uh fourth stage cancer and you know just just pray for we believe god gonna touch her and you know and she's gonna be all right and and uh and and his young son said uh uh he says uh mom and daddy after we finished could i talk to you and uh and say uh yeah phillips say phillip actually can i talk to you so brother nathan said yeah you can you can talk to me what what's going on he says uh yeah i don't want to say this in front of him say but uh but daddy i was in my room and i heard a voice and i thought it was your voice calling me so i come running to the office looking for you and you want nowhere to be found so i went back to my went back to my my room and as i was walking back back to my room i heard a voice say uh uh uh me mama has cancer but she gonna be healed and say at the same time brother nathan mentioned that there was a young girl in church wondering does god speak to kids and philip had just heard the voice of the lord say mama gonna be healed say yeah yeah don't worry she got this cancer but but uh but but but she's gonna be healed well on july 24th amen uh brother nathan's brother posted something on on facebook it says mom had ct and bone scans yesterday we just got the test results the lump in her breasts that was three centimeters has shrunk to 1.4 centimeters lori the cancer that was in her lungs in her abdomen in her lymph nodes and bones is gone all right god honored amen what he spoke to that little boy phillip and said the cancer is gone if you can get the people to believe not even cancer he said the lesions on the bones has left scarring but that is normal she still has fluid in her lungs from an aphid but hopefully we can work on that now that the cancer amen now that the cancer is so much better say thank you for your prayers amen and keep praying god is good i want to tell you god is still moving when i heard that testimony said we got to have this prayer line god want to heal somebody maybe somebody might be watching they might be dealing with cancer the doctor is giving you a death sentence but we're telling you god still moves put in your prayer requests we want to pray for you amen i got another one here glory glory glory this is rather lengthy but just bear with me sister karen pruitt brother tim pruitt's wife she was dealing with uh a situation where she had a little spot on her brain and uh they thought they fixed this a couple years ago but somehow through this covet thing it reappeared it reappeared and they couldn't figure out what was going on so she was going in and out of the hospital and and one of the days uh she ended up going to the hospital they said they had to uh uh they said they had to do emergency surgery they could not figure out how this thing came back to the same spot emergency surgery and the doctor was pretty much telling brother uh brother uh tim that your wife is gonna be a vegetable if you come out of this hey man she's gonna be a vegetable uh he said oh my say i what am i supposed to do i don't i never you know not even expecting nothing like this to happen but brother tim would just kind of give us different reports hallelujah on uh on the 26th she went in uh june 26th she went in for surgery and uh emergency surgery on the 27th they said good morning i called the nurse today and karen is still sedated and in in uh nicu she's in stable condition she's not opening her eyes uh as of yet but she will she will respond to verbal commands like thumbs up wiggle your toes etc she does seem slow to respond on her left side but still can do it it it won't be by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord but this mountain shall be removed we believe and we shall see miracles he says uh though thanks for all your prayers the battle is the lord's is too big for me so i'm allowing him to fight and supporting him with my praise and encouragement i told you in between his promise and in between your belief it's got to be your praise hallelujah glory to god so uh that was on the 27th on the 29th he says i'm here at the hospital now it says today is a red letter day and we are celebrating today physical therapy was here and set her up on the side of the bed she raised her arms and legs she told them her name the year and where she was at we are rejoicing she just had surgery a couple days ago brain surgery look at this now uh on on the third of july he gives another report and this is his son amen i believe that gives this report said today was a better visit than yesterday i was greeted by the nicu nurse and was told she was awake karen was more or was more alert and stayed awake or rested with us this is brother tim i mean uh writing this it said rested with her eyes closed for two and a half hours i stayed by a side she was able to give the nurse thumbs up with both hands and wiggled each of her toes she talked more today but still really only answers questions she told me her date of birth how long we have been married her eyes were open more wider for example i showed a picture of baby brook and she said that's my brookie and then blew two kisses looking out in the hall there was three nurses standing talking and she asked who they were so she's beginning to be conscious of her surroundings on monday they would put in a stomach feeding tube which will remove the irritating nose feeding tube plans are being made to move her to a nursing care facility for rehab this will probably not take place until monday don't be surprised though to hear that she has been moved to a regular room in the next day or two today marks a week that she's been in nicu hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory now i want to just uh just kind of uh go uh because what was happening while they were waiting on her to be evaluated they needed her to just be able to swallow at a certain time if she could swallow then she wouldn't have to go through certain things god touched her body the lady was able to swallow now i i didn't bring everything but i can take it as much on the 18th of of uh of july uh he wrote uh brother tim wrote again say mike wahl mike walls pastor mike walls writes that he brought his wife home this evening she was battling something but he brought her home from the hospital says thank you so much for the prayers i'm looking forward to the time when i bring my wife home it says today karen and her sister sat in a dining type area down the hall putting a 300 piece puzzle together hey man how's that for someone who's supposed to be a vegetable and on the 21st of july brother tim went to the hospital and got his wife out and bro drove her home and they got the video out there on facebook where they had a live feed of mama coming home and you can see a lady that's supposed to be in a vegetable when she saw the outpouring of love from the saints amen might not be able to walk might not be able to talk but when she saw the outpouring of love from the saints people wait for her to come home she stood in her driveway shouting [Applause] hey i i am here to tell you god still moves that was last month that god did that he is the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah glory to god amen i'm under expectation i i i want to give you just a couple more here amen uh this brother joseph hammett another pastor says uh he says uh my mom was diagnosed the same week brother ron found out about his sickness she was eaten up with cancer medically there was no hope for her cancer in the stomach lymph nodes and all female organs i was moved by the holy spirit to pray for her just last week she went back to the doctor for a checkup and the doctors declared her cancer free no trace of it ever being in her body the doctors are stunned god miraculously healed her completely [Applause] brother branham was told by the angel if you can get the people to believe not even cancer will stand in your way i want to give you just a couple more testimonies this one is coming from brother donny reagan he has a daughter by the name of erica and erica is 40 years old has two sets of twins twin girls said oldest jet the oldest set just turned 14 the youngest set are 12. they found a tumor erica's liver and the doctor said that it said it didn't start there it began somewhere else so they're going to do more tests and he also recommended a second opinion from doctors in nashville on how to treat it we need a miracle from god she had a pet scan done today she would know the results on wednesday they decided to tell their daughters this evening so we have cried lots of tears but we know our god reigns and he loves to manifest himself in such situations i'm going to mention it this weekend to the church so feel free to share it with your churches we certainly need we need and appreciate the prayers of the saints he comes back around a few weeks later with another testimony with another uh uh uh uh post it says praise our wonderful lord jesus erica's bone scan brain scan stomach and colon are all clear glory i say god still moves a man says she would have a lung biopsy on monday and another in-depth pet scan next friday doctor said his anxiety level is it uh was down from her first visit so the doctor got anxiety if the doctor got anxiety we really in trouble right i need somebody to be calm hallelujah he says uh uh uh it says his anxiety levels down from her first visit he and the doctor nashville both agree it's it's a slow to an intermediate growing tumor and feels it can be treated without full body chemo it says he will know more after the second pet scan friday she will get results of a of a lung biopsy uh and that scan on the 12th of august doctor said that he will make the plan of treatment after that so hallelujah since that's coming on the 12th amen of august that's this week can we send the word to erica hello hey man before the doctor's hands touch our body we're looking but it's everything to be clear hallelujah if we just speak the word only god's servants will be made whole we're expecting erica to be made whole after we send the word of god he was wounded for your transgressions bruised for your iniquities chastisement of your pieces upon him with his stripes we declare erica is healed [Applause] glory to god glory to god glory to god she'll get the results of a lung biopsy in that scan on the 12th of august doctor said that he would make the plan of treatment after that we want to thank everybody who's prayed for erica we're asking for great things and many of them we're not we're not we are not telling jesus how to heal her but we're asking for a tumor to be gone if that would be pleasing to the lord erica is already very small and frail and we are concerned uh for her nutrition and energy level god is mighty in battle once again thanks for all your prayers we love we love uh we we love our family the family of god another one here brother uh mike wall he's another pastor amen there uh i believe it was uh july 17th his wife sister annette uh went to surgery uh about a three hour surgery said doctor says it looks like cancer is in just one spot pray for a successful operation that they can get all the cancer cells now remember brother donna said we're not telling god how to do it some people may have to go through surgery but it's still going to take god to watch over the doctor's hands and the surgery amen we're not telling you how to do it we know what god can do glory glory glory glory let me just try to finish this it says it says pray for successful operation that they can get all the cancer just talk to the doctor surgery went well he said it looks good to the eye that he got it got it all follow-up visit in a couple weeks uh to see if they need to do any other follow-up treatments to make sure it's all gone wants to make sure there there are no micro cells hidden or in the bloodstream now that's what they told sister tanya after she was here that you know it's maybe some microscopic stuff there so we need to go go ahead and do it my dad had told me this before he passed he says uh jack a singer wants to sing he says a preacher wants to preach hallelujah glory to god a chiropractor would want to crack you understand amen he said but a surgeon want to cut he said so if i go to a surgeon i already know what they're going to advise me that's how they get paid because they want to cut glory to god amen we got to understand these things that's just the way it is and so but sometimes you get in situations where it says it's got to be done now don't worry god will be with you god will be right there with you he says uh brother branham even told that that one man said the only help you got is that country doctor that's the only help you got donnie morton's amen that's the only help you got is the country doctor go see the country doctor hallelujah glory to god so sometimes god uses that we're not we're not against that glory all right so look but we just do we do know that there's a limit sometime to mankind that's why we serve we trust god for everything he can bypass processes amen it says uh uh want to make sure the microcells are hidden or in the bloodstream she is in recovery now thanks for all your prayers looking for a complete deliverance amen and on 7 18 july 18th he brought his wife home she went in on the 17th on the 18th he brought her home on the 25th of july last month he says good news the doctor called my wife indoors he did not see any more cancer anywhere else in her body he said it was a slow growing kind he doesn't see any need for treatments thank you so much for praying for her god of miracles is moving god bless you [Applause] i say god still moves you got time for one more testimony this was a sister that was battling cancer her name was sister jan sister jan hall her husband's brother gary hall brother sherman davis from uh uh virginia galax virginia called me to tell me about this this week and uh he says uh brother jack we've been praying for this sister for for a good while for some years and uh you know just praying that god would touch us say back in february our king brother sherman came down here in february and i think he came to one one of the services that we had and then he left here and went up to brother keith brown's meetings up there and he saw brother gary hall and his wife sister janice just keep praying for us brothers brother sherman they live in south carolina so they just keep praying for us you know we just believe in god he says so a a few weeks ago maybe i think might have been last week or so said um what happened is that the sister sister jan uh felt that she had been touched by god and she went to the doctor uh to be to to have a case reviewed and the doctor's report showed that she had been completely healed she had cancer all this time but the doctor report showed that she had been completely healed and she had a supernatural experience one night while she was sleeping she had a supernatural experience while she was sleeping and said now after that supernatural experience she said i think something that happened i think i was healed and the doctor's report showed that was here but the supernatural experience was captured on the camera the security camera that's in their bedroom while the lady was sleeping snowflakes was falling on her and the camera picked it up while the snowflakes are falling god was bringing the healing captured by the camera i am telling you god still moves [Music] that's why we have in this prayer line that's why we're doing what we're doing because god still moves we rebuke the spirit of fear god has not given us a spirit of fear but a love power and a sound mind somebody gonna be healed somebody gonna be delivered somebody gonna be set free you got to approach it with the right attitude watch god do what god says he will do i'm reading you testimonies from a week ago or two weeks ago last month god is still moving see this is why jesus uses this statement here in scripture amen as we read it there in in matthew 8 uh you know this this man that centurion it says uh uh when you read the whole story over in the book of luke it reads a little differently in luke but just kind of putting both of the stories together luke chapter seven you'll read it there but putting both of the stories together the man say you know i maybe he's thinking to himself adam did some things to the jewish people that i i'm not too proud of i had to do it because it was my job it says you know i did these things i'm not too proud i don't think this man would ever come to my house and say right here i got a servant one of the jewish servants that's here in my house man i love this man i really care for this man and and i don't want to see him die in the condition that he dying in he said he maybe start talking around house do y'all think that y'all can get jesus to come pray for him i mean i took him to the best doctors they can't do anything but do you think jesus could do something for my servant here he said i i mean i i send you a man with an entourage please go get jesus from me please just try to get him to come to my house and and uh and just pray for my servant i i don't want this for me i want this for my servant because i love him so much i want to see him made whole please go get jesus i don't think he'll take notice of me if i showed up but i believe he'll he'll have a special place in his heart for you because you're one of his people they say we'll go they went out to to go get jesus and as they go they say jesus this man is a good man this centurion's a good man he doesn't took cabbage he don't did this he done did that and you know he even helped build some of the you know provide money to help build some of the buildings that we got our temples and everything this man is a good man he said well uh i'll come and i'll go so maybe the man is at home thinking i don't know what's gonna happen my servant gonna die i just don't wanna see him die like this and it sees this big group of people coming because wherever jesus go it's going to be a big group following amen big group following that because they know something getting ready to happen so he said he said i'll go and heal him and and i noticed that he wasn't just coming to see him he was coming to heal him glory to god amen i don't want you just joining just to see what's going on i want you to expect your healing glory so the man said he said he said he said uh jesus is coming to his house and he got up and he saw this big this big group he said now i feel so bad about jesus coming to my house i just don't think that this is going to be proper i don't i just i know he i he oh i just just i could see him having all kind of mind battles he had to come up with a plan so he approaches the lord jesus he runs out and meets the crowd before they get to us i said jesus i'm not worthy that you should come underneath my roof i'm not worthy i i realize i'm not worthy i i i don't deserve you coming underneath my rope my roof but but but jesus i want to tell you something it says i'm a man of authority he says i tell this one to come and he cometh i tell that one to go and he goeth i tell this one to do that and he do with it it says he says if you could just speak the word only because i recognize you have the same authority demons have to power at your name hallelujah devils have to bow at your name how if you speak the word i believe my servant will be made whole jesus looked and said i knock at that seed jesus just kind of hold his mouth open because the bible said he was marveling he said now i ain't seen this kind of faith nowhere in israel it says but this is the kind of faith that we're looking for he says man go find it the way that you believe it and then that self-same hour when that man spoke that he found his servant made whole jesus performed a virtual prayer line that man was made whole i want to tell you that same god still lives today and we're going to do this virtual prayer line expecting god to bring healing to his people let's just read a couple quotes one coming from the message new ministry and then i'll go back to who is god amen the other quote there this new ministry says the american people has been taught a jewish custom of laying on of hands that's not a gentile custom that says the jews remember jair said come lay your hands on my girl and she'll live but the gentiles said i'm not worthy that you come under my roof just speak the word and my servant will live that's the difference the ministry has not been my ministry to lay hands on the sick it's been to make by a divine gift to bring presents the lord jesus christ in presence by discernment of spirit which is called in the bible a gift of knowledge and in doing so makes him manifested before the people and then they receive him as the healer healer that settles it amen so so so this this this approach is true gentile faith speak the word only even though you don't have to come and touch them lay hands on them but speak the word only they'll be made whole brother troy was recently sharing with me say i was telling about just what was in my heart to share today and he said please share testimony about my mom and uh and see so say you know we prayed for them church they was suffering from covet cecil had to go to the hospital and and they were just telling him that they might have to send him home with oxygen uh they didn't know what was going to happen to him and and and and my belt she was at home suffering with the covet my my sister was suffering just just just went through the house just didn't know what was going on he says all of a sudden god touched my bed and she's feeling a hundred percent better say god touched cease so he came out the hospital without oxygen without oxygen god turned the whole thing around brother troy say i know it was nothing nothing less than the prayers of the saints that did that god still moves god still moves i mean i'm gonna tell you you ain't going nowhere until god is finished with you hallelujah amen and what god trying to do is get this word to people amen he's trying to get him to in tune with his word before he calls him home god want to make sure that you're ready to go glory to god so we're we rebuking covert from anybody anybody come and come near us we're rebuking it in the name of jesus not just covet anything else that's attacking your body we rebuking it this last uh quote here amen who is god thank you jesus amen let me just make sure all right uh he says in this roman italian whatever uh he was he said lord i'm not worthy that you come under my roof and neither neither thought i worthy to come to face you in other words i sent you a church to meet you and to ask this question but i have faith i know that you're a man under authority but i'm under authority and you don't have to come down to my house to put your hands on my servant you don't have to come here and say any prayer hallelujah you don't have to come here and say any prayer notice now be sure to get this he said i'm a man under authority also and if i say to this man you go do it he will do it and if i say this man you come here he will come i'm under authority and them who are under me has to obey me and he knew that that was the son of god and that every sickness and every demon was under him and all he had to do is just speak the word glory to god not pray just speak the word that's all and it would be dumb because every demon would have to obey him do you believe that tonight every demon will obey god it has to and look at this everything obeys god and if and it'll obey you yeah everything obeys god and it'll obey you if you have faith if you say to this mountain be thou removing and don't doubt in your heart you can have what you say church i'm here to tell you god still moves god richly bless you amen
