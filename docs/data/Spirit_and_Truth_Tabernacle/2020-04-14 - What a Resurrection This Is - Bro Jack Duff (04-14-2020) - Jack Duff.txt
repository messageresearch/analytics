TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] praise the Lord to a stand this morning get our Bibles we'll open the service the reading of the word of God I wish everyone a Happy Easter on today so good to be in the house of the Lord man I want to read from the book of Song chapter 22 this particular passage is David prophesying over our Lord and Savior in some of the things that he went through as we were reading through this this morning I want you to just kind of picture in your mind some of the things that the Lord went through during this Easter season as I was just reflecting missed I thought about what we're going through now with this coronavirus it can't even compare to what our Lord and Savior went through when he faced Calvary and the reason that we even stand in the house of God today is because of what he overcame he overcame death hell and the grave and we're so grateful for his tremendous sacrifice so here in Psalms 22 starting at verse 1 says my God my God why hast thou forsaken me why art thou so far from helping me and from the words of my Rory oh my god I cry in the daytime but thou here is not and in the night season and I'm not silent but thou art holy o thou that inhabits the praises of Israel our fathers trusted in thee they trusted and thou didst deliver them they cried unto thee and were delivered they trusted in the end were not confounded but I am a worm and no man a reproach of man and despise are the people all day that seeming laughed me to scorn they shoot out the lip they shake the head saying he trusted from the Lord that he would deliver him let him deliver him seeing he delighted in him and this is exactly what took place at the cross but our key that took me out of the womb now this make me hope when I was a pun my mother's breasts I was cast upon thee from the womb thou art my god from my mother's belly be not far from me for thou the trouble is near for there is none to help many Bulls have compassed me strong Bulls of Bashan have beset me round they gaped upon me with their mouths as a ravening and a roaring lion and poured out like water and all my bones are out of joint heart is like wax it is melted in the midst of my bowels my strength is dried up like a potsherd and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws and thou has brought me into the dust of death but dogs have compassed me this simply of the wicked have inclosed me they pierced my hands and my feet I may tell all my bones that they look and stare upon they parked my garments among them and cast lots of on my vesture says but be not far be not thou far from me O Lord o my strength haste thee to help me amen the Lord and a blessing to the reading of his word let's just bow in a word of Prayer father we here privileged to be able to come into the house of the Lord and to reflect on this moment this time Lord of history where you came from glory to bring to us redemption story God you didn't just send your son to the earth but you became the son and you

birthday on Saturday we want to wish our sister happy birthday thank God for let me see another year god is good don't forget a man this we just kind of go forward in this season we will continue just a periscope the services on Wednesday night extra Lord we were having some issues they were periscope and sometimes it was going in and out so we decided to actually start also broadcasting the services on YouTube I'm sorry Facebook Facebook we started a church Facebook a page so we can also stream through there and the Lord blessed us with some new equipment on yesterday and and actually have a camera that is live streaming through both sources it goes through Facebook as well as it goes through periscope so we have that in place and we thank for that and just trying to make sure everyone has a wonderful experience so Wednesday nights we'll be doing that we thank God for this past Wednesday brother Troy came and spoke about the secret place of the Most High we had a wonderful wonderful time Magnusson joy joy the word of the Lord for my precious brother and so we'll continue to do Wednesday night streaming amen so just keep that in mind also know no Friday night services until they meant things are lifted and as far as our Sunday services will continue to do 9 a.m. and 12 p.m. and I believe everyone has accepted one or the other services and with dis managing things accordingly what we are trying to do is do our best to stay within the guidelines a man that's been given to us I heard that some churches they completely well know the governor took a ban off it but we still want to be careful in this season so we're trying to just keep it where we can keep everybody six feet apart and one thing I don't want the devil to do is is take a testimony out of Spirit of Truth that something broke out spirit of truth tabernacle that it be that would be a lying devil and so we want to make sure that we're doing everything we can to keep everybody out of harm's way but we still want to worship the Lord the scripture says give Brenda diseases what it seizes but also written unto God what is God's and he deserves our glory he deserves our worship he deserves our praise so just keep those things in mind a man as we go forward continue to pray for each other that God would just continue to protect us and keep us during this time a man you know he is moving in the midst of all this on over the on Friday I had an opportunity to baptize a precious young lady and then in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and and I was a man praise the Lord I was just so elated to have the opportunity I was telling her this is a perfect day to be baptized because it's the same day that you know we celebrated him going to cross and being buried in a grave and baptism is symbolic of that that experience of going to the grave but raising into the newness of life and you know we just think for her and our children just keep her in prayer the devil fights people after they've been baptized and you know but we know that if they're seized of God and there is nothing that devil can do to stop them from coming forth a man so a keeper in prayer continue to keep a man those that are on the front line in prayer we we have saints that work there in the hospitals and and they are in contact with some some some different various situations and their lives amen are are in danger every time they go out to work but these are people that can't live in a state of fear they have a job to do and they rise up to the responsibility we thank God for that but pray that God will protect them and keep them amen as they're out there on the front lines and now we're just trusting God that you know we will see the little a man that in itself is a miracle that God can keep you amen in the midst of all these sick people amen that's that's that's that's the scripture that no plague will come now my dwelling Amen a thousand may fall at my side and ten thousand at but no plague on come nigh my dwelling Amen cover ourselves in the Word of God amen praise the Lord so we won't necessarily pass the offering bucket Amen but what we will do is when you want to give Amen either as you're coming into service or as you're exiting we have a box there on the table and you can just put it inside a man the box that we have on the table but at this time a man will just have a word of Prayer not access to Tina if she would come and just blessed this Amen but let's just bound a word of Prayer and then father we thank you for how good you have proven to be to us in this season and in this time we thank you for your divine protection and thank you for the miracles that are happening Lord every day thank you for watching over those that are on the front line and God remember our precious sister Liz and sister Tammy this is a time you Lord sufficient era God so many Lord that are on the front line that need you to watch over them we just pray that you continue to do that Lord you've done it thus far we know you'll continue to do it reacts God that you would just continue to meet the needs of the saints that you would bless them in ways that go beyond their expectations that you moving mighty mighty ways show that you are God even in the midst of this tremendous time well we just prayed it bless a man the rest of the servicemen you get all the glory all the honor and all the praise this in Jesus name we pray amen one other thing I needed to make mention of I was told that on tomorrow the governor is requesting that everybody wear mass amen as they are when you go out of public they are requesting that everybody wear mass and and I must say I'm grateful for the governor that gives us this opportunity to be able to do what we are doing but we want to try to follow that so you know please you know if you're going out in public you have to wear a mask that means even when you come in the church you smell the way of mass that's what they're telling us to do so a man and you know we just want to follow a man as they or get guiding us and leading us through this so less less less less render unto Caesar what is Caesar's god bless you god

just appreciate the Lord also good to see brother Marcus god bless you a man have you brother this woman raising little praise the Lord well we want to read a scripture for our thought today and trust the Lord just bless us we want to read two scriptures so everyone's standing that can stand I didn't hear the there was a testimony I was giving this morning and I believe I heard them say brother Gerald and I believe it was brother Gerald Gondor ok brother Daryl has come here and preached before he had a tremendous testimony of going into some country and getting a car that somebody stolen from and I mean a tremendous testimony but was he impacted by Kovan he just had something else that he was going through but he was in ICU okay so brother Gerald but they're in England he was in ICU recently and the Lord brought him out and he was in church this morning giving his testimony of how God brought him out so we're seeing God's healing power I still manifested in this hour right so we thank God for watching over our precious brother amen let's read a couple scriptures Matthew 27 and then also Romans 8 but Matthew 27 a man and we'll start reading at verse 50 says Jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up the ghost and behold the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks rent and the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which slept arose praise the Lord and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many a man let's also just read from Romans 8 and just one one verse here at Romans eight a man and just only read verse 11 if we can but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you amen the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his words let's just bow in a brief word of Prayer father we thank you for the ability to read the word God we trust that the Holy Ghost would now come and help us to understand what it is that we have rent this day God make it live for the time of which we are standing and we just take every spirit that's against the Spirit of God underneath the control of the Holy Ghost may you be glorified and magnified and exalted through your word Jesus name we pray amen amen praise the Lord God bless you I want to just use for a title today what a resurrection this is a man what a resurrection this is a man just going back you know we will start with a quote here to go tell my disciples but Easter a man is a very special time of year for Christians a man and however for true Christians Easter is not a one day event or one weekend event Easter is something that occurs every day in the Christians life a man is something that they celebrate every day you know one of the things you know a lot of people in especially here in the US they they're what we call c-e-o Christians a man CEO Christians and what that means is that they go to church at Christmas and Easter only hallelujah a man CEO Christians but we don't want to be that way right and in Christianity we want to we want to celebrate the resurrection every day the story or a man the songs that we sing about the blood of Jesus Christ they never get old a man they never get old they always have meaning when we think about the blood that was shed that allows us to be able to come together to worship a man in spirit and in truth so we thank God for this so let's let's just start a man with a little quote here I to go tell my disciples and then I want to we'll just kind of move forward in this thought what a resurrection this is a man it says then when alone came Jesus they done to him what they said they would when he was born in Bethlehem he came in by the way of a stable door went out through capital punishment hallelujah amen while he was here on earth he never made a 50-mile journey in his life he never went anywhere around Palestine yet the message of his gospel has traveled to every crack and corner of the world he says he never wrote a book in his life yet the book was written of him has outsold every book in all ages the Bible and yet in there he never went to college in his life and yet there's been more colleges erected in his honor than any other thing that has been upon the face of the earth or any other name or any other man and he never went very far he lived a humble low life he was made fun of scarf laughed at now you know we look at this man Jesus that never went a man more than 50 miles from the place that he was born and yet so much as his life has impacted every place in this world when people hear the story of Jesus it does something hallelujah amen I uh you know the the precious young sister that we had a chance to baptize I was just getting her background she said I come from a Hindu background I say well my praise the Lord to see how amen the story of Christ and not just it's not just a story we know that He is risen the way that we know that he is risen it's because he lives inside of us glory to God i'ma get ahead of myself and I'm gonna just say something amen you know his resurrection produce many resurrections Lorre to God amen many resurrections came from one resurrection that I myself have experienced a resurrection amen I was dead in sin and trespasses but because I came in contact with Jesus I have been resurrected glory to God and I can say this morning what a resurrection this is hallelujah amen when you can see yourself in what the Lord Jesus has done for you individually you can say for yourself what a resurrection this is we're not gonna put it past tips we're not putting in two thousand years ago he is still resurrecting today look at this in the message in his the rising of the Sun it says now as the world today in a memorial in a memorial service or at least in the United States and the side of the earth is this morning and the churches of throughout is celebrating a memorial of the greatest triumphs that man ever had glory he says I think I saved you when he died or as an infant when he was born he could not have been here less being coming into the earth and when he died certainly he atoned for our sin but yet there's been many fine little babies born and there's been many man who has suffered and died for real cause but there never was one that could raise his self up again until this thing glory to God this was the Lord Jesus that raised himself up again you say you know you destroy this body and in three days I'll raise it up again you destroy this and in three days I'll do that and there was many people come and made all kind of claims but he didn't just make a claim he manifested what he talked about and that's why Christianity is different from any other religion Amen Jesus is different from any other leader he's the only one that could prophesy and say what was going to happen and being manifesting glory to God amen even our our purpose for going to church on Sunday a menace in its action honor of his resurrection because he resurrected on the day after the Sabbath hallelujah amen it says he resurrected on the day after the Sabbath we celebrate his resurrection every time we come together glory took on amen I wanna I wanna let me just maybe just keep reading on that no no no I want to go to another little quote here this is probably on the end of my um on the end of my notes back there but uh he atoned for our sins I want to go to this message living dying buried arising coming home five seats if that ain't nothing if that ain't enough to be happy about I don't know what its gonna take for us to get happy I'm already got here the tone for everything look at what the Prophet says here he says in this message living dying berry rising coming he says but oh that Easter rising he justified freely forever he's quoting a song glory to God living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away rising he justified freely forever one day he's coming back o glorious day and I'm under expectation for that look he says rise and he justified freely for you have a living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away for the men say that was alright says but rising he justified it was it was enough to start shouting on the living he loved me it was enough to start shouting Oh dying he saved me it was enough to give praise him buried he carried my sins far away the Prophet said all right glory to God he says but rising he justified amen what was that raising up it was God's receipt that the bills been paid rise and he justified freely forever oh what a savior rising what had God done a man can suffer a man can die a man can be buried but Easter was the greatest of them all for it was God's endorsement my law has been met my requirement has a husband has been I've been met by him he rose him up from the dead raising he justified freely forever blessed be his holy name I was I was rejoicing when I read this quote you know I love brother Branham using this type it says what was that raising or that resurrection it was it was showing that it was it was God's receipt that the bills been paid God's receipt that the bill has been paid now you know I just begin to ponder that a little bit in and I begin to think about you know how some of the sisters a man may get a gift for their birthday or some event a man and maybe somebody else buys them a gift maybe Bhama some clothing or something like that but typically a man when the sister receives this she also is given the receipt hallelujah a man of what she just got and the reason that another sister might give it a receipt you say now I thought this might be your size but just in case a man you need to get a different size or a different color or whatever you want to do I'm giving you the receipt blessed be the name of the Lord the sister which he goes back to the store she can go back with a confidence she can put the receipt in her purse and just carry the garment back into the store and when she walks inside the store maybe the first person look at him say now now look we don't take that back we're not taking that back no no no no no no no are you gonna take this back how do I ain't showed you what I got in my purse but you gonna take this back do you have a comfort tip when you're standing there talking to a cart when you can show them your receipt rather when you pull out the receipt sister when you pull out the receipt the argument is over you have proven to them that this garment was purchased here amen so I'm here to get another sighs I'm gonna exchange it for what I like if I want a different color I'm gonna get a different color if I want a different size I'm gonna get a different size whatever I won't I'm gonna get because I have the receipt and I'm here to tell you this morning it's time to take the receipt of the Resurrection suet to the devil tell the devil I'm here to exchange I'm giving you back depression I'm giving you back heartache I'm giving you back pain I'm giving you back sickness [Applause] Elin I'm leaving here with my deliverance I'm leaving here with my Easter glory to God hallelujah amen that's what the resurrection was all about initial paid receipt and when you got a receipt you can stand with confidence glory to God you're gonna get what you went in there for hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory glory glory amen let's go back here to a little statement that the Prophet makes in I just want to read this scripture revelation 1:18 revelation 1:18 he says I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am Alive for evermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death if Jesus is the one with the keys the devil can't do nothing unless he has permission hey man you understand that the devil can't do anything unless he has permission even amen he don't have keys his own house glory to God Jesus says I have the keys of hell and of death that's why when we recognize this we don't have to fear anything Jesus is in control even in death Jesus is in control look at this now brother Branham makes a statement here in this message in US the rising of the Sun it says I'm at paragraph 50 a man in this sermon he says now notice now as the gloom cover the earth and the seeds could not live without the SU into rice and gloom and cover the earth and now the S Oh n was risen and all gloom was vanished by this light as it spread across the nations to the people that he is not here but he is risen what a statement says he approved his words he had proved it to he proved it B to be true for he for he had now conquered death hell and the grave but before Jesus came everybody feared Amen death everybody fear the great even Joe back quest like what happens after man dies he says I see that when a flower dies it'll come back up when a tree goes through its winter sees him it'll come back up hallelujah amen he says but what happens to a man when a man dies what happens to him and you know this is why you know I remember you know last year when we preached for Easter I brought a quote with brother Branham said Joe was the first one to see at Easter when Joe was discouraged at a situation of wonder what was going to happen God elevated Joe and John began to look and say I've known my Redeemer liveth a man and I shall see him in the last day he said no the skin works destroy of this flesh yet in this flesh I shall see God and not another window saw that he was looking at Easter for the first time hallelujah hallelujah glory to God it encouraged him when he got a glimpse of Easter it will encourage you when you get a glimpse of Easter amen look at what the Prophet goes on to say here glory glory they made for he had proved it B to be true for yet conquered now he had now come to death hell and the grave I will notice this the Trinity of the devil death hail and grief brother branham called it the Trinity of the devil he said for Satan is the author of death he is the possessor of hail and also the grain and that was the Trinity of Satan because our being caused by one thing that was death then you go at the grave and being a sinner you go to hell so we try to be trying to curb that process we don't want you if you had to die don't die a sinner amen die in Christ glory to God because we have a promise that your bones would be wicked hallelujah at his coming if you die in Christ everybody might have to die someday now I think we're living in a day where what some people are not going to taste death some people gonna actually catch a rapture and I believe we're living in the time we agree we can expect that to happen any day now just as the scripture promised that Jesus was coming the first time and he came the scripture also promises that he's coming again and he will come and I want you to know when he comes it will come at a time of pressure glory to God it'll come at a time when we a man we it might be worse than what it is right now but that's the time we can expect Christ to come hallelujah hallelujah look at this he : says the Trinity of the devil death hell and the grave a man the Satan's off the death he's the possessor of hell and also the grain and that was the Trinity of Satan me cup being caused by one thing that was death death you go ahead at the grave being a sinner you go to hell all the very one thing the Trinity of Satan which was death that had held man in captivity all these years now look at this because he it's just beautiful the way the Prophet brings this and this is why I appreciate a prophet he brings out things that we probably never look at in Scripture he brings out little thoughts that we never even considered now I'm preaching to you what a resurrection this is I didn't make that up I actually got that from the Prophet and I'm going to show you the quote where he says a little bit later but what a resurrection this is when he brought that statement he was trying to get him to see don't keep it 2000 years ago amen but we got to see ourselves right now do you realize the reason you hear in church the reason that you're sitting here in shirt is that you yourself have experience right a resurrection brother/sister that devil had you going places you should not have been going that there were had to in places where he was trying to kill you he tried to stop you from getting to where you are right now but whether resurrection this years oh not a resurrection that was but what a resurrection he sees glory tuck ah let me go further amen and this he says but now the trip now the true Trinity of God being one manifest in Christ that's Father Son and Holy Ghost being one that's the true Trinity of God he says but now the true treated God being one manifested Christ who was like Jesus said I come that you might have life and had that more abundantly says the true Trinity of God being one man one manifest in Christ who was life and hat broke the seals and conquered the enemy and rose up the one through a living God I am he that was dead and I'm alive forevermore and had the keys of death and Hell God and one made man and dwelt among us and conquered every enemy and had proved that the Trinity of Satan was conquered and that the Trinity of God was made known cause and not now we're here just a beautiful statement here here when death hell and grave is conquered because of a resurrection that brother branham say it defeated the Trinity of Satan but it also a man expressed the Trinity of God hallelujah and the Trinity of God was wrapped up in one man our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he is the father he is the son he is the Holy Ghost so the Trinity of God defeated the Trinity of Satan hallelujah that's why we celebrate Easter glory to God look at this he goes on the city and she says and prove that the Trinity of Satan was conquer and that the Trinity of God was made known because only God alone had power to bring life again he was that Emmanuel God had been manifested in the flesh no wonder he could claim their Matthew 27th chapter all power in heaven and earth is given into my hand and I send you to be my witnesses all the world he had conquered both death hell and the grave not only did he do that and come out try up with all the power in heaven and earth all that was the father and and all that was the Holy Ghost and all that they ever was was in him all powers in heaven and in earth is given unto me everything else is powerless he accompanied that statement everything else is powerless even this virus how when it comes to the Lord Jesus claim no power say brother Jack what if you are what have you got sick and you died good for me the other saying good for me I as a Christian I do not lose in the ocean because they couldn't get a grave to put me in I still will not lose hallelujah this earth the key so we don't have anything to fear he's conquered everything Oh blessed be the name look look I can tell you right now God is on the other side of this there's still tribulation left to be done amen that's still a white throne judgment that has to happen according to scripture that's still a millennium rain that has to happen there's a new heaven or God is already beyond this thinking beyond glory to God don't limit ourselves here we not stopping here touch this is not the e will hear wars and rules of war jesus said but that's not the Oh glory their God amen and some of those Wars might be biological wars according to the prophets message amen biological warfare you know biological warfare something that they create right that's what it is amen is something that man can actually create brother branham already told us this but I'm so glad that I'm dwelling in the secret place and you know the tour brought us a plane everybody can't claim that scripture you know secret place do you know what the secret place was in the days of race you could just be anywhere in the city Amen I'm dwelling in the secret place no you not you're the only place that secret because we have had the secret is the place where the Scarlet thread is hanging out the window everybody criticized rehab why would she be hanging this out of her window I mean no I mean the value of the property in the neighborhood is going down because rehab has this garnet thread hanging out the window but rehab had a secret that window army begin to come in the only place in the whole city that was not gonna be destroyed it's the place where the Scarlet thread so you better make sure that you're dwelling in the secret place of the Most High God that secret place being baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost that's how you get into the secret place if you've never repented acts God amen to forgive your sins this is a good time to do that if you've never been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ this is a good time to do it amen I know I know if you want to come with a mask our baptizing a mask hey man but we want to get people ready how do we want to get you into the secret place glory to God hallelujah let me just keep reading by the grace of God a man look at this he makes a statement here in the message I am the resurrection and the life says Oh Christianity is based upon the resurrection he says the that's our hopes now let's find out why the Creator has so set it in order if we did not even have a Bible look at this now if we didn't even have a Bible we would still know that Christianity was right over all the other religions if I didn't have a Bible I would know Christianity Christianity is right now notice what Christianity is based upon the first statement that was in that in that says Christianity is based upon resurrection now he goes on he says now resurrection is not replacement but resurrection resurrection is bringing up the same thing that went down but this morning standing here where I'm standing I can say I have experienced a resurrection and I can say this - what a resurrection this is says now resurrection is not replacement resurrection is bringing the same thing up that went down if I should drop the Bible from the stand on the floor and catch some another Bible and replace it that's replacement since what resurrection is bringing the same Bible up that went down that's what resurrection means to be raised up so resurrection means to be raised up can I ask the question has anybody in here been raised up brother Branham section she come to church say I want to thank the Lord that I'm not where I want to be I'm not where I ought to be but I sure thank God that I'm not what I used to be the reason I can say you used to be because oh I see in my own life that God has resurrected me I don't care if nobody else don't see it I don't know where God has brought me from hallelujah that's why I can claim well a resurrection this is some personal testimony Church look at this look at this he made a statement if I didn't even have a Bible we didn't even have a Bible we would still know that Christian is right not just you know thought about this and and I want to just kind of go a little further amen just just reminding us of some things the resurrection is demonstrated in nature I've talked about Joe a little early let me go back and just kind of talk about that a little bit more Joe could actually look and see that winner-winner when a tree died say that tree came back the next year you know the Sun the Sun amen every day it rises in the morning it sets in the evening hallelujah that the night comes in and the moon is shining glory to God you don't see the Sun anymore it it brings its the greatest light source that we have the Sun amen but at night time the Sun is missing we don't have it anymore but but but the good thing about is that if we can just make it through the night we will see the same Sun that we saw yesterday will rise again the next day as a cycle amen and it's in what I would call a resurrection cycle if you didn't have a Bible you can't just look at nature and see that God is in nature Christianity is based upon this principle of resurrection Oh glory to God now I was just thinking to myself there's some mourners that you wake up you know the Sun rose but because of storm clouds you can't see the Sun hallelujah glory to God what I call that is a temporarily block of your view of seeing the SU in amen but even though you have a temporarily a temporary block a man from actually seeing the SU in that does not mean that the SU in did not rise you might have a temporary a may your view may be hindered temporarily but it does not mean that the SU is did not rise and some of us temporary where the temporary block from the enemy allow us to see that the s om has also risen glory to God but your temporary trouble Amen in your temporary mindset does not stop the fact that the s in has risen and one day that base top will shine inside your heart if we didn't have a bar but we were still no Christianity was right when that tree loses it leaves in the fall the SAP begin to drop down in the roots during the winter and that tree may look dead in the winter time but it's this time of year spring time the same time we celebrate Easter it's the spring time that that the tree begins to live again and that the same tree that looked dead in the winter now begins to show forth a man leaves and blossoming and just doing all kind of things it showed that the tree still had life as long as a person didn't cut that tree down it had a it had an intelligence God was a men still dealing with that tree in a show that I still have like I don't care where a person might be right now if they have come from God they will go back to God there will be a resurrection there will be an Easter in the spring and fall here it's going through the process of dying in the winter you don't even see it anymore you don't see it now you know what God is not planting a new flower for the spring but what happened amen before the winter something happened in the flower there was a seed in the flower that went back into the earth hallelujah and since it was a seed from the flower that makes it the same flower it's the resurrection of the same flower and in a gulp of that process year after year after year so before you went through your Amen your winter season and like something dropped and that's why in springtime it comes back up it just has to get in the right position for the SU in to strike it and then it begins to live again that's why you're living again why the resurrection this is look at this the resurrection of our Lord Jesus produces many resurrections we look there in in Matthew 27 I read that for you earlier in Matthew 27 Matthew 27 verse 52 says and the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which slept arose now when did this happen verse 53 and came out of the grace after his resurrection so many of the people that were sleeping actually got up after his resurrection all right Laurie to God so here's one resurrection produce many resurrections glory to God his one resurrection changed many people's situations here's one resurrection is still change in our situation glory to God now let me just Oh glory glory glory glory glory let me uh let me let me I'm just Coast you a little bit I read before I read this one when we talk about this resurrection it's a raising up I can't help but go back to the story of Peter and Peter denied him just like the other disciples denied him they all left him at this time that the soldiers would come in to take him away and Judas sold them out with this this kiss where he betrayed the Lord Jesus and and Jesus told Peter said now and you know he was telling what was getting ready to happen proper sign to them and I appealing like no I'm not gonna leave you I'm gonna be right there everybody else may do it but I'll be right there and and Jesus say you know what before the cop actually crow twice you're gonna be done denied me three times people say oh not me he said okay all right right no I'm not even argue it already I'm telling you what the vision sing hallelujah he'd say but i'ma meet you in Galilee I'm gonna meet you Galilee too now now I can imagine Peter a man going through and and hear you denied the Lord three times and then the crowing I've just let Jesus down and I can see their eyes just catching each other and Jesus pretty much totally did not tell you what you're gonna do and being like I can't believe it took off running didn't know what to do just just in a manic state of conviction condemnation all over him but but he had also said Peter I'm gonna meet you in Galilee I know you're gonna deny me I know you're gonna do this under you don't do that but I must still meet you in Galilee I'm still gonna meet you so I'll Peter you know after you went through I listened and the news came that that Jesus had risen they went he told me it's on the total ad say go tell my disciples and Peter that I will meet them in Galilee let me Peter I don't care how discourage you up Peter I don't care I've defeated you up Peter I don't care how you've given up on yourself I'm gonna meet you still in Galilee and God used that same pinna to be the spokesman on the day of Pentecost his spirit glory to God and some of us see the resurrection of our spirit even at a time like this we need to experience a resurrection God is still in control glory hallelujah Peter had a resurrection of his spirit I think about the brothers on the road to Emmaus they were a little discouraged as they were going back to Emmaus and they were man they were so down Trotman and as they went they were sitting there talking about the events that occurred the Bible say a stranger came from behind the bush began to walk with them we need that same stranger to walk with us and as Jesus began to talk say now what would things happen what's also sad about what's going on they say are you a stranger around here you don't know what them happening and in in the city like what what things what things are happening and as they began to say you know you know we were expecting this Jesus to do it to do this thing to do that and they don't crucified him and he's dead and say we don't know what to do and as as they were sitting so the skirts they were on the way back to their old churches they were only way back to their old situations they want all the way back to a man all circumstance they will only wait back to something that felt comfortable glory to God but uh but by Jesus beginning the camera break open the scripture any say now this man Jesus that you talk about in the Bible say this and then the Bible say that and then the Holy Scriptures say this then the Word of God say that didn't it and then they say oh my yes that's exactly what the Word of God said didn't that man fulfill these scriptures they say oh yeah that's exactly what happened as they begin Oh hallelujah as they begin to fellowship around the word it brought encouragement I want to encourage you to do something in this season give people the Word of God don't give them nothing else give people the word give them the scripture if you want to see people get encouraged can't them the scripture but actually begin to share the scripture with with us as you share with us as he broke open his word to us they say they got to the city and Jesus acted as if he was going to keep going on the journey [Music] they step into a restaurant saying the waitress brought some food he's saying when the waitress brought food food he's saying he's saying Jesus bless the bread and he broke the bread right there in the restaurant now this is just a quote that I bet you know brother branham you know you say he's broke the bread right down the restaurant he said when the umbrella saw him break bread Oh hallelujah I wish they could have caught it a little earlier amen they could catch it when he was breaking the spiritual bread of scripture revealing the Word of God - but they caught it when he broke natural bread and they say only Jesus could break bread the way it has been broken and when they recognized that it was Jesus he disappeared but you know what they're in their discouragement also disappeared what we need is the Lord Jesus to break bread again with us and watch this courage disappear what we need is the resurrection in our spirits I don't care what you're going through God can give you a resurrection in your spirit this resurrection produced many other resurrections you experienced a resurrection when you're baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the Bible tells us in Romans 6 verse three and four three through five it says know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ Romans 6 verse 3 baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father even so we also should walk in the newness of life for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection and I always like to read the scripture with people that have been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because it shows us that when we're baptized just like Jesus went into the heart of the earth for three days a man we might go into the water for three seconds but just like Jesus rose a man from that death amen when we rise out of the water Jesus rose and it changed life for everybody glory to God but when we rise from that water our life is changed forever hallelujah baptism is symbolic a man of a resurrection a man you can experience a resurrection in your spirit when you're baptized in the name of Jesus glory amen you can and and I want to mention this Oh glory glory glory Ephesians 2:1 he feeds us to one it says and you have he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins now to be quickened is actually to be made alive a man and what happened with Christ when he was in the grave he was quickened now I got a quote here now and I will I won't I might not have time to read it but I'll just tell you what it is the probably said when Jesus went to the grave you realize a man that got up from the grave glory to God nobody racism it was the Spirit of God that quicken him and calls him to Rozzie do you realize a man with that power he could arose in one minute of his death he could arose in one second of his death he could arose in one hour of his death he could have risen in one day of his death but the reason he did is because the Word of God said that he had to stay there for three days he was bound by his own word hey man he had the power to get up glory to God but he did not break the word that was said he had to stay there for three days but he had the whole truth to the Word of God so after that third day brother the devil was in trouble lost the key says Houston there the whole world has been turned upside down glory to God when Jesus rose again now I want to tell you this a man that was a powerful powerful resurrection but as we read in the scripture you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sin now if you were honest with yourself we all have sinned and come short of the glory of God but the reason we're sitting here right now is because we have received a resurrection and I'm here to say what a resurrection this is when brother branham was i said i said his his his death produced many resurrection me even in our own lives we've been resurrected from sin if you've ever been sick in your body and you've been healed by the power god he was resurrected for them from illness we've been resurrected if some of us had the opportunity to go through denominations do you know by coming out of the denominational system and coming here to the message do you know do you know you experienced a resurrection you were dead in denominations but because you came out oh I don't know if we get the same voice that called Lazarus of a grief is the same voice that called us out of the grave the denominator if you were in a bar dying and you heard the voice of God you know people go to the bottom they talk about God they supposed to be out there talking about something else they end up talking about God and something strike him on the heart I shouldn't be doing this I shouldn't be out here this club you are experiencing a resurrection and that that's why you can say what a resurrection see when your eyes come up into it not what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is make it president Jesus made it present it's when he got there to the grave of Lazarus he told Martha I am the resurrection and the life he made it present it not not he gonna rise getting latter day I don't talk about right now he's gonna rise because I am the resurrection he made a president and he is still the resurrection the resurrection is a person the person of the Lord Jesus and if he has done anything for you anything you can't say what a resurrection this is let me go a little further if you came out of denominational Church you had a resurrection now I'ma tell you that statement and this me is where brother Branham gave us discount and I'm gonna read this quote for you so you can see where I got it from it is the Raja of the Sun look at what the promises he says as Christ was the first one to raise paragraph 94 says this Christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth although typed in many places he was the first fruits of those that's left in the bride coming of Christ I love this coming out of the church there'll have to be a sheaf waved again in the last days oh my waving of the sheath says what was the sheet what was the sheaf the first one that comes to me to mature the first one that proved it was a week that proved it was a she you know talked about in Israel's history they would plant their crops and they plant wheat and in the first they watching the crop oh I mean crops you know you got it if you are a farmer depending on your crops you would be great for your pram for Raymond and Israel it doesn't rain like it rains here you know they have a certain season they have to get written they got to get so much rain for that season it has to carry them through the year they got vets that they build and and whales that they built to try to capture all the water that comes during that season and if it doesn't rain they gonna have a drought so they pray for rain they danced for rain kids come out of the school and start shopping and dancing and jumping and glorifying God when it rains they're happy to have rain so so you know when they're doing this a man over there in Israel you know they're watching for the crops in and this man is growing weaning and what he's doing is looking for the first sheet that comes to mat or the first one that comes to to be grain he says when he fired was the first one he picks it up and he just weaves it and what that is a wave offering the God and it's saying that God I thank you for this but there's gonna be more that come forth to maturity amen my crop is going to it's gonna make it we're gonna live we gonna sell this and my family's gonna be all right because I got the first witness customer to it now glory it ought to give you it would give the farmer encouragement when he sees the first one waved now we know Jesus Christ was the first one way that came up from the dead and if he rose we're going to rise amen since he rose we're already rising hallelujah we're already experiencing resurrections since he rose because many of the things arose after his resurrection and many of us have risen from our dead denominations from our dead a man stands in and talks in our character we have risen from that and we come alive in Christ Jesus the Lord Jesus and what he did for the rabbits even bringing it forward to him because he being a manifested son of God was the first one to come to maturity in our day and he was way before the people and what we saw in his ministry is what we expect to see in the bride the rock coming of Christ can I go a little further with that waving of the sheet what was a sheath the first one that come to maturity the first one that proved it was wheat that proved it was a sheaf it says I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waved over the people and the first time there will come forth for the bride age that's the age you live in here right the bride age for a resurrection out of dark denomination ISM see that you have been resurrected out of dark denominationalism the same voice that said Lazarus come forth is the same voice we heard when we were in denomination and it called you by your name come forth that's why brother Branham gave us the tight of the mother Eagle flying over me when the mother Eagle come flying over that little baby you can have no idea what that was but he can identify with the screen we didn't know nothing about this God sent the Prophet God did this we don't know but we could identify with the screaming just by hearing revelations about what happened in the garden of evil God being one when we heard these revelations the Bible begin to click then because we couldn't accept all the other stuff that they were teaching we heard the screen of the mother Eagle we identify with it we had a resurrection amen he says and the first time they would come forth Oh glory for the bride age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power and being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders that he did back there look at this because I live he live also look at what he say speaking to his wife so that scripture because I live he live also is not for everybody brother Branham says he's speaking to his wife is his wife sitting here this morning amen he's speaking to his wife because I live ye live oh look at this Amen look at this he says speaking to his wife what a resurrection that that was and what a resurrection this is so he's taking us back there to look at you know what happened some 2000 years ago but we coming out of dark denominationalism we coming out of the things of the world we coming out of discouragement we coming out of sickness we coming out of the virus but when a resurrection he says he says what a resurrection that that was and what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made made alive in Christ Jesus by God's Quinten power he was waved to them the word which he was was way back to them on the day of Pentecost the word made manifest now and as I say is to be waved again in the last day now for instance he said and that's just just one statement that he makes but I was blessed by that because I was thinking that what a resurrection this is he made it present tense the Prophet brought the story of Easter and put us in it we are a part of that resurrection the same way he came out the grave we came out of the grave and denomination you're experiencing you came out of the grave of the world the devil tried to bury you the devil tried to kill you some of y'all were dead dead in sins and trespasses we all were there Laurita God but he has quickened us the same way he was quickened from the dead we had been quick it's a little last statement I think I want to read here this is out of the message feet says when you got to use faith in God to make it work so you got your own resurrection inside can you imagine brother branham coming to your church notice the paragraph number in that one before he opens his Bible he walks up into the pool and the fret he don't say god bless you good morning friends nothing just walks out see see this way when you come to church you better be ready to say a man because something would go right over your head and you won't even know the first statement that he walks out him says when you've got to use faith in God to make it worse he so you got your own resurrection inside of you know you know you're gonna sit there thank you what did he just say the resurrection is wet you got your own resurrection inside oh no you're not waiting on a resurrection you already got your own resurrection I'm sorry and this is why I've been telling you've been experiencing it all along that's why you can look that there was a lot of resurrection this is you got your own resurrection inside of you look at this he says your resurrection lays inside of you in your spirit Oh glory to God since now you know when Jesus died on the cross his soul descended into hell and preached to the souls that were in prison that repented not in that repented not in long-suffering in the days of North his body went into the grave but before he thought he committed his spirit into the hands of God it reminds me of that flower that seed that drops in the earth before anything happens there's a seat that drops in the earth and when that when springtime comes that flower has to come and resurrection is not replacement resurrection is the same thing that went down must come back up look at it he says so you see his spirit went to God his soul went to hell his body went to the grave now that spirit that was in him was a spirit of God and that spirit and sundry times and divers manners time knowing that the prophets to bring the message to the people in the last days through Christ and now these days here through the gospel says now when we receive Christ into our hearts since that's theirs all that we have need of theirs eternal life now Christ could not come back until three days was so filled because the spirit was behind the screen like a bar like this that it could not cross over that bar because it was a spoken word of God that he was delayed in the grave for three days and three nights now he could not come back until that three days and nights was up then when three days and nights was up his spirit was loosed it went directly to his soul and his soul came back and picked up the body and fulfilled what he said I have power to lay my life down I have power to take it up again Jesus made that made that comment I have power to lay down my life I have power to pick it up again no you can always put this two thousand years ago what Jesus said but you know your resurrection lays inside of you and the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead if it wasn't you it will quicken your mortal bodies it'll make you come alive you know what you can't even even if you tried to stop it you can't Oh if you come from God you will go back to God a man turns watch this watch this thickness now each one of you the same power that you say I know man take my life but I'll lay it down he says he says I have power to lay it down to have powered reason brother Branham says and I need y'all to get this these are his first comments in the sermon faith have you realized he made comments like this is really taking us beyond faith glory glory glory he says now each one you have power the same way because you are sons and daughters of God and the very spirit that is in you this morning the Holy Spirit that's in you this morning that same Holy Spirit will raise you up look at this so you have power to raise yourself back up a Christian being defeated a Christian being down a Christian being out no somebody pray for me somebody somehow to do this no no no it's time to change that you pray for yourself hallelujah exercise the power and the authority that has been given to you look here you ain't got to wait till you feel this you just need to know this that you have power already in you you know there certain people can go around the city everybody get in line the police are going to execute what disentis is singing you made hallelujah do you even and if they got that type of confidence in what the governor sees we ought to have confidence in what the Word of God says if God spoke and I'm a son of God and I'm a daughter of God I can have what I what I'm asking God for the same power that Jesus had in him say I'm gonna eat he says I have power to lay my life down power to take it up again brother Ram him say that same power is in you not just in you but you have power you have power to raise yourself can I put it in these words you have power to create your resurrection you want to know why because resurrection power is already inside you what the resurrection when you die your soul we're going to not also to go alright right in the Friends of God man your spirit will go to God but you cannot come back remember the Bible said silver an altar crying Lord how long how long they could not return it to the scriptures for field and like Christ could not return to the scriptures you know brother Branham goes on later on he just begins to explain about those dimensions six dimension and even brother went into that dimension Paul be judge the same way I have to be just yet Paul gonna be judge the same way he said well I preached the same thing he said that millions millions that yelled out for the brand up say I saw you there he was talking to his church I got a chance to hear it and since he said it I absolutely believed he saw me there and he say he say he said Jesus was in the seventh dimension he say and one day he'll come to you glory to God one day he'll come to you it says but right now we just go to the sixth dimension when we die that's why I say if if the took me out if I baptized somebody they had the virus and didn't I got it y'all let everybody know that tizen somebody in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ tell him I said it on don't think I'll die baptizing somebody in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah right because one soul is worth ten thousand worlds whatever happens quote the Word of God to the devil and watch God come with an anointing on his word God will quicken the word God will anoint the word the Spirit will come on the word and watch God to feel what he said if he did it in Jesus he'll do it in you your resurrection is in you what a resurrection Father in the name of Jesus how grateful we are for the word of the Lord's prophet God is bringing things to our attention God things that we wouldn't hear in the average church as I was just listening to this sermon Lord on it is the rising of the Sun just thinking how the Prophet said he was just he woke up that morning five o'clock or so in the morning listening to the birds singing and I just really didn't know which way to go with his thought he just didn't know what to do but Oh God a little girl walked in with a car and said daddy and me and daddy won to give you this Easter card and in the car that talked about the rise of the Sun so the Prophet drew an inspiration from that and Lord with him going out to that pulpit and sharing thoughts like this helps us to see Lord that father we are experiencing resurrections even right now this is not an event that occurred just two thousand years ago but it's still happening even today I believe somebody can experience a resurrection well maybe somebody's watching at home Missy I've never heard it that way before but I want to have the resurrection in my life god I created to it do a mighty work in their view you said any word that he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life as the word is being heard let the word transform hearts bring the people to a place of true repentance God that they would desire to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins you promise according to your word that they would receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's the place of safety God that's what we want to buy and there's a way to get there we have to come here when we can't make up our own way to get to heaven we must come the way to to gibbeted repent be baptized then you'll be feeling the Holy Ghost god I pray that hearts would be pricked I pray that lives would be changed I pray that people would experience a modern day resurrection and they'd be quickened from sins and trespasses and made alive in Christ Jesus we give you the glory we give you the honor we give you the praise in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that we pray amen amen hey man please the Lord [Applause] haebang I just feel in my spirit just to do a little something here and I'm just gonna ask everyone just wherever you are just bow your heads man maybe there is someone that has watched this online or or even a man if you here in the sanctuary within the sound of my voice I just want to if you feel like the Lord has spoken to your heart
