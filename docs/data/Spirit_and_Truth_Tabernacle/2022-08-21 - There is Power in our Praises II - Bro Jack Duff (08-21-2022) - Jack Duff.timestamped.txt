[55:51] amen
[55:52] he's a mighty god he's an awesome god
[55:56] and he's an old time god
[55:59] amen we worship him i was listening to a
[56:02] little sermon this week and
[56:05] brother branham they were in a uh
[56:08] they were in a kiwanis club or something
[56:10] like that and it says it's good to be in
[56:12] the house of the lord
[56:14] and uh and and they said well you might
[56:16] not call this the house of lord because
[56:18] this is kiwanis club he said but
[56:19] anywhere the church is gathered
[56:23] it becomes the house of the lord
[56:27] so if we were gathering in your house it
[56:30] would still be the house of the law
[56:34] so it's good to be in the house of the
[56:35] lord
[56:37] amen we thank god for all things i

[57:21] it's just a much better
[57:24] uh much better it's i would say like
[57:27] this is it's more appealing to the eye
[57:30] uh than having all those words behind
[57:32] you and what in the world are they
[57:33] writing on that book
[57:35] it ain't all bored you know and we just
[57:37] here we we pilgrims just passing through
[57:41] and uh you know that's just part of our
[57:43] journey amen is part of our story but uh
[57:46] but we know god is not finished with his
[57:49] book yet
[57:50] amen so we're just gonna enjoy this
[57:52] chapter amen that the lord has us in
[57:55] right now so we thank god for all things
[57:57] appreciate the specials amen that have
[57:59] gone forth this morning
[58:01] [Music]
[58:02] praise the lord
[58:04] amen and encouragement from our deacon
[58:06] amen we certainly thank god
[58:08] amen for
[58:10] the tender hannah jehovah just leading
[58:12] his people
[58:14] praise the lord so let's uh let's get
[58:15] our bibles and i i will
[58:18] just go into the scripture thank you
[58:19] musicians certainly certainly appreciate
[58:21] you all
[58:23] um
[58:25] we will
[58:26] go back to
[58:28] um
[58:29] scripture that we read last week and and
[58:32] there was particular
[58:34] part that i was trying to get to but uh
[58:36] i like it when the holy ghost come
[58:39] and just take over
[58:41] uh the service that that that's what we
[58:44] want him to do is just have his way
[58:46] uh in our midst and uh this morning we
[58:49] will just again just
[58:51] keep
[58:52] uh plugging away and see where the lord
[58:54] would take us
[58:55] uh but uh acts 16
[58:59] is uh where we are
[59:02] bringing our thought from
[59:04] and uh verse six through
[59:07] nine
[59:08] is um
[59:14] actually i think it should be six
[59:15] through
[59:16] eleven i'll read
[59:19] um
[59:21] since this now when they had gone
[59:23] throughout
[59:25] phrygia
[59:26] and the region of galatia
[59:28] and were forbidden of the holy ghost to
[59:30] preach the word in asia
[59:33] um
[59:35] after they were come to myself they are
[59:38] saved to go into
[59:41] bethenny
[59:43] but the spirit
[59:45] suffered them not
[59:47] and i think this is very very important
[59:50] we need to
[59:51] we need to know
[59:53] what god is leading us to do and what
[59:54] he's not leading us to do
[59:57] sometimes we lead ourselves
[1:00:00] and then we expect god
[1:00:02] to back it up
[1:00:04] amen uh
[1:00:07] you have to question who is the leader
[1:00:10] is it you a god
[1:00:12] amen uh uh we we follow him as he leads
[1:00:15] us and uh here we see paul just
[1:00:19] trying to go in one direction and god is
[1:00:21] blocking it and you know but he he he
[1:00:24] he's sensitive enough to realize this
[1:00:26] ain't the will of the lord so you have
[1:00:28] to stop sometime
[1:00:30] glory to god
[1:00:32] amen and first verse 9 says
[1:00:35] and a vision
[1:00:37] appeared to paul
[1:00:40] in the night there stood a man of
[1:00:43] macedonia and prayed him saying
[1:00:47] come over into macedonia
[1:00:50] and help us
[1:00:52] and after he had seen the vision
[1:00:55] immediately we endeavored to go into
[1:00:58] macedonia
[1:01:00] assuredly gathering
[1:01:02] that the lord had called us for to
[1:01:04] preach the gospel unto them
[1:01:07] therefore loosing from trois
[1:01:10] we came with a straight course to
[1:01:13] samathra shia
[1:01:15] and the next day to neapolis amen we'll
[1:01:19] leave our reading there let's just bow
[1:01:21] in a brief word of prayer
[1:01:23] lord jesus we
[1:01:25] uh thank you for the privilege to read
[1:01:28] the word
[1:01:29] but we know the holy ghost
[1:01:31] is uh trying to get something to our
[1:01:34] attention so lord help us to hear what
[1:01:36] the spirit
[1:01:37] is speaking
[1:01:38] thank you for each one that have
[1:01:40] gathered here in this place today to
[1:01:43] uh to worship you thank you for the the
[1:01:46] wonderful song service amen and uh the
[1:01:49] the specials that have gone forth the
[1:01:51] word of encouragement lord jesus and how

[1:02:03] we praise you because you're good and
[1:02:05] you're god
[1:02:07] amen and and uh and lord there's nothing
[1:02:09] that catches you by surprise so
[1:02:12] uh we uh we have learned to
[1:02:15] acknowledge that all things
[1:02:18] work together uh for the good to them
[1:02:21] that love god
[1:02:23] and to them who are the call according
[1:02:26] to his purpose so let your will and your
[1:02:29] purpose be done uh in us and we pray
[1:02:32] that you take control of this portion of
[1:02:34] the service be glorified be magnified be
[1:02:36] exalted uh here in jesus name we pray
[1:02:40] amen amen god bless you you can be
[1:02:43] seated
[1:02:59] praise the lord
[1:03:01] we are going back to our
[1:03:04] subject of there is power
[1:03:07] in
[1:03:08] our praises
[1:03:10] amen there there is power in our praises
[1:03:14] um
[1:03:17] we were
[1:03:21] bringing
[1:03:22] you know
[1:03:23] um last week just this definition
[1:03:27] that i i pulled out of the
[1:03:29] just some bible software that i have
[1:03:32] called aluminum
[1:03:33] and i was just looking up the definition
[1:03:35] of the word praise
[1:03:37] and they were
[1:03:39] they they had a question what is praise
[1:03:42] what is praise
[1:03:43] and um one of the things that said
[1:03:45] praise is giving thanks to god for who
[1:03:48] he is
[1:03:49] amen giving thanks to god for for who he
[1:03:53] is he he's a provider he's a waymaker
[1:03:57] he's he's my health
[1:04:00] he's my strength
[1:04:02] right he's my encouragement
[1:04:05] amen i mean he he he he promised never
[1:04:08] leave me no forsake me so he's
[1:04:10] uh he's uh jehovah jireh my provider my
[1:04:14] protector
[1:04:16] some of y'all almost got an accident
[1:04:18] this week but god protected you
[1:04:20] it shows you who he is
[1:04:23] hey man i don't know if you've ever been
[1:04:24] that close to an accident where you
[1:04:26] couldn't pray
[1:04:28] anybody been that close but they just
[1:04:29] couldn't pray
[1:04:31] but uh there's only one thing you can do
[1:04:37] you can just say jesus
[1:04:39] and and the good thing about he is an
[1:04:41] ever-present help
[1:04:44] in the time of trouble
[1:04:46] right no no matter what you're going
[1:04:47] through you're just jesus
[1:04:50] and it and for some reason there's a
[1:04:52] peace that comes over you
[1:04:55] right i mean there's things just the
[1:04:57] atmosphere changes when you just call
[1:04:59] his name
[1:05:00] hallelujah
[1:05:02] i thank god we serve a god that is not
[1:05:04] dead
[1:05:06] he's still alive and he's still moving
[1:05:08] in the midst of his people so we praise
[1:05:11] god we give thanks to god for who he is
[1:05:15] hey and i like the word who he is not
[1:05:18] who he was
[1:05:19] because if that's what he was then
[1:05:22] that's what he also still is
[1:05:25] amen
[1:05:26] amen uh they said praise is a spiritual
[1:05:30] offering
[1:05:31] and uh oftentimes you don't feel like
[1:05:33] giving god praise sometimes you get so
[1:05:37] wore down by life you just don't feel
[1:05:39] like opening your mouth to give praise
[1:05:40] but praise is a spiritual offering
[1:05:44] amen we have to learn to give god praise
[1:05:46] in the midst of whatever we're going
[1:05:48] through
[1:05:49] amen another thing they say here's
[1:05:51] praise is focusing our heart on god
[1:05:55] amen and this is where we got uh caught
[1:05:57] up here because uh they talked about the
[1:05:59] last five psalms of
[1:06:01] of of psalms um the book of psalms and
[1:06:05] uh psalms 146 through 50 just feel with
[1:06:09] praise that each praise i mean each
[1:06:11] chapter began and ends with praise the
[1:06:13] lord and they show us where
[1:06:16] why
[1:06:17] and how to praise god
[1:06:20] amen what does praise do they have this
[1:06:23] question what does praise do first
[1:06:25] praise takes our mind
[1:06:28] off our problems
[1:06:30] amen praise takes our mind off our
[1:06:33] shortcomings
[1:06:35] amen and praise focuses them on god
[1:06:38] amen is that praise leads us from
[1:06:41] individual meditation to corporate
[1:06:43] worship
[1:06:44] glory to god and and what i what i found
[1:06:47] out about that is when when you begin to
[1:06:49] praise especially when it goes when it
[1:06:51] enters uh corporate worship because most
[1:06:53] most people just um that you know it god
[1:06:57] just began to deal with it was like a a
[1:06:59] slow boiler
[1:07:00] and uh and they just begin to think
[1:07:02] about this then they begin to think
[1:07:03] about that let me think about how god
[1:07:06] did god did this and how god did that
[1:07:08] and next time i just thank you lord
[1:07:10] hallelujah
[1:07:12] glory to god you know and you just start
[1:07:14] hearing all these things and you know
[1:07:16] and and some some people now they used
[1:07:18] to get quicken
[1:07:20] [Applause]
[1:07:22] some people you hey you know them got
[1:07:24] quick and they don't thought about
[1:07:26] something that the lord did for them and
[1:07:28] they got quickened and next thing you
[1:07:30] know they begin to worship and and when
[1:07:32] you hear them bubbling up over on this
[1:07:34] side somebody else on that side begin to
[1:07:36] get it get contagious and the whole
[1:07:39] congregation just began to praise god
[1:07:42] [Applause]
[1:07:43] it leads us from individual meditation
[1:07:46] to corporate worship
[1:07:48] praise causes us to consider and
[1:07:51] appreciate god's character
[1:07:54] and another thing it says praise lifts
[1:07:56] our perspective from earthly to the
[1:07:58] heavenly
[1:08:00] thank god
[1:08:02] praise is my weapon
[1:08:06] hallelujah hallelujah another thing they
[1:08:09] say about praise praise is thanking god
[1:08:11] for his many gracious gifts
[1:08:15] and and i love this one they said
[1:08:17] david's praise focus on god's glorious
[1:08:20] deeds
[1:08:22] it is easy to complain about life
[1:08:25] but david's list gives us plenty for
[1:08:28] which to to praise god he forgives our
[1:08:31] sins
[1:08:33] all right david said he heals our
[1:08:36] diseases
[1:08:38] that's something to praise him for he
[1:08:40] redeems us from death
[1:08:43] he crowns us with love and compassion
[1:08:46] he satisfies our desires
[1:08:48] and he gives righteousness and justice
[1:08:52] see we we receive all these without
[1:08:54] deserving any of them
[1:08:56] that's why we praise them so so no
[1:08:58] matter how difficult your life's journey
[1:09:01] you can always count your blessings
[1:09:05] and i love this they said counter
[1:09:06] blessings pass
[1:09:09] count your blessings present
[1:09:13] come on somebody hey
[1:09:15] i'ma praise him for what he did for me
[1:09:17] yesterday
[1:09:19] but i'ma praise him also for what he do
[1:09:21] for me right now
[1:09:23] but i got faith and my faith has
[1:09:26] long-ranged vision
[1:09:28] glory to god and i'm and i can already
[1:09:31] see
[1:09:32] what he's getting ready to do for me
[1:09:34] right now
[1:09:35] amen so i praise him for my future
[1:09:42] they say when you feel as though you
[1:09:43] have nothing for which to praise god
[1:09:46] just read david's list in the book of
[1:09:48] psalms you'll find plenty to give god
[1:09:50] praise for
[1:09:51] amen another thing they said here this
[1:09:53] last one said praise is thanking god for
[1:09:55] our salvation
[1:09:58] thanking god for our salvation and and i
[1:10:00] love they say when when someone gives
[1:10:02] you a gift
[1:10:05] uh do you say
[1:10:07] that's very nice
[1:10:09] now how much do i oh yeah
[1:10:12] i thought they gave you a gift
[1:10:14] and do you say that's very nice
[1:10:17] how much do i owe you
[1:10:19] now if i'm giving you a gift
[1:10:21] and i heard you tell me
[1:10:23] that's very nice
[1:10:25] brother jack how much do i owe you
[1:10:27] i'ma look at you strange
[1:10:30] right don't don't don't say that's very
[1:10:32] nice how much do i owe you the proper
[1:10:35] or the appropriate
[1:10:37] response
[1:10:38] when somebody gives you a gift you
[1:10:41] simply say two words
[1:10:46] thank you
[1:10:48] amen that's all you say is thank you
[1:10:51] that's the response when you're getting
[1:10:52] a gift and amen it said yet how often
[1:10:55] christians even after they had been
[1:10:57] given a gift of salvation
[1:10:59] feel obligated to try to work their way
[1:11:01] to god
[1:11:03] amen because our salvation and even our
[1:11:05] faith are gifts
[1:11:07] right we should respond with gratitude
[1:11:10] with praise and with joy
[1:11:13] so when praise is a thing it's thanking
[1:11:15] god for our salvation sometimes i
[1:11:18] remember one time i was at work and and
[1:11:21] i just got to thinking that i was saved
[1:11:25] i got the thing about i was saved oh
[1:11:27] they don't talk like that no more i'm
[1:11:29] i'm saved
[1:11:32] i'm saved
[1:11:33] right and and i got to think about man
[1:11:36] the lord saved me
[1:11:39] like the song said this morning he could
[1:11:41] have let me drown
[1:11:42] but instead he took me in
[1:11:45] and and and there's no goodness of my
[1:11:47] own but he saved me
[1:11:49] out of all the people out there that he
[1:11:51] could have saved he chose me and i'm
[1:11:54] saved
[1:11:57] i'm not the same person i used to be on
[1:11:59] i'm saved
[1:12:01] hallelujah i confess my sins to god and
[1:12:04] now i'm saved
[1:12:06] right and i was just beginning to think
[1:12:08] of my salvation and and before you know
[1:12:10] it i was up and moving around my office
[1:12:13] and uh and and and and it just uh it
[1:12:16] just it just it just got a hold of my i
[1:12:18] got something just i i had a little
[1:12:21] revival in there by myself
[1:12:24] saved
[1:12:26] by his power divine
[1:12:30] saved come on somebody i got new life
[1:12:34] sublime
[1:12:37] life now is sweet
[1:12:40] my joy is complete
[1:12:43] you know what i'm saying
[1:12:48] i got i'm saved
[1:12:50] [Applause]
[1:12:52] i got the feeling real i said i'm saved
[1:12:58] man i was in the office by myself just
[1:13:01] thank you for salvation
[1:13:07] i'm saved
[1:13:08] thank god
[1:13:10] we got so much to be grateful for
[1:13:14] amen so much to to be thankful for they
[1:13:17] were um they were they were they were
[1:13:19] you know there this power
[1:13:22] in our praise and i just remember as i
[1:13:24] was just going through that little
[1:13:25] moment and thinking about my salvation
[1:13:27] uh i don't know what i was going through
[1:13:29] but whatever i was going through it was
[1:13:31] over
[1:13:32] by the time i start releasing that
[1:13:34] praise
[1:13:35] and i'm telling you
[1:13:37] your praise can change
[1:13:40] amen it can change an atmosphere
[1:13:43] and you don't need nobody else to praise
[1:13:45] them just you doing it alone it'll
[1:13:47] change your atmosphere
[1:13:49] when you're riding down the street
[1:13:51] sometimes you got to turn the radio off
[1:13:54] in order to give god the praise
[1:13:57] i'm trying i'm sorry i heard what you
[1:13:59] said but i'm gonna have i've gotta stop
[1:14:01] right now and i'm gonna have to give god
[1:14:02] this praise
[1:14:03] praise changes atmospheres
[1:14:06] praise changes my my my outlook
[1:14:09] um i get encouragement when i praise
[1:14:13] all right church let's look at something
[1:14:16] you know uh
[1:14:17] they they they hit that song a little
[1:14:19] earlier and i was just um
[1:14:22] i had it in my notes to come back and
[1:14:24] and and get this because i had to go
[1:14:26] back last week and look at last week's
[1:14:27] sunday i mean sermon and um and i i was
[1:14:30] talking uh how we were just coming back
[1:14:33] from the um the uh the night of worship
[1:14:37] there in michigan and they got to sing
[1:14:39] in that song and i can't even think of
[1:14:41] it but
[1:14:42] yeah i'm going to see a victory the
[1:14:44] battle belongs to the lord and and they
[1:14:47] they got to sing an ad and i say lord i
[1:14:49] just want a little piece of it not and i
[1:14:51] got me a little piece and uh and i made
[1:14:53] this comment maybe the reason we haven't
[1:14:56] seen victory is because we still
[1:14:59] fighting
[1:15:00] but when we let go and let god
[1:15:02] fight the battle then we'll see victory
[1:15:06] right and i just began to think up think
[1:15:08] on those scriptures and i want to go and
[1:15:09] just read just where we get that thought
[1:15:12] from out of second chronicles 20 uh
[1:15:14] verse 15 through uh 25 if we can just
[1:15:16] catch that
[1:15:17] uh my god i wanna i wanna just say this
[1:15:21] ii chronicles said the battle was the
[1:15:23] lord's
[1:15:25] but i want to say this praise was the
[1:15:27] strategy
[1:15:28] used to enter the battleground
[1:15:32] i'ma say that again the battle was the
[1:15:34] lord's
[1:15:35] but praise was the strategy to enter the
[1:15:38] battleground
[1:15:41] [Laughter]
[1:15:43] when you leave here this i mean today
[1:15:45] you're going you're going you're going
[1:15:46] to a battleground and just understand
[1:15:48] the battle is not yours
[1:15:50] the battle is the lord's but praise is
[1:15:52] the strategy
[1:15:54] amen to enter to the battleground
[1:15:57] all right
[1:15:58] not to complain
[1:16:00] don't enter the battleground with
[1:16:01] complaints
[1:16:03] amen don't don't do that but enter the
[1:16:05] battleground with praise
[1:16:07] and watch what god does let's pick it up
[1:16:09] in second chronicles chapter 20 amen
[1:16:11] verse 15 it says and he said
[1:16:14] hearken ye
[1:16:15] all judah and ye inhabitants of
[1:16:17] jerusalem and thou king jehoshaphat thus

[1:16:28] nor dismayed
[1:16:31] by reason of this great multitude
[1:16:34] for the battle is not yours but gods
[1:16:39] and if god be for us and who can be
[1:16:41] against us
[1:16:42] amen tomorrow

[1:18:04] go to verse 18. that they can't go into
[1:18:07] battle dismate
[1:18:10] you can't go into battle with a defeated
[1:18:12] attitude
[1:18:14] you got to already see yourself as
[1:18:16] victorious
[1:18:18] you already you got to see yourself as
[1:18:20] the winner
[1:18:21] especially if god is with you
[1:18:24] hallelujah glory to god
[1:18:26] says in jehoshaphat bowed his head with
[1:18:28] his face to the ground and all judah and
[1:18:32] the inhabitants of jerusalem fell before
[1:18:34] the lord worshiping the lord here it is
[1:18:37] and the levites of the children of the
[1:18:40] korathites and of the children of the
[1:18:42] korah heights stood up
[1:18:44] amen to praise the lord god of israel
[1:18:47] with a loud voice on high i like that
[1:18:51] they didn't give god this soft praise
[1:18:54] god knows my heart god wants you to open
[1:18:56] your mouth
[1:18:59] if i brought you a gift
[1:19:02] amen don't just take it from me
[1:19:04] and then say well you know my heart nah
[1:19:08] if it's in your heart let it come out
[1:19:10] your mouth
[1:19:11] thank you
[1:19:13] come on somebody and man god want to
[1:19:15] hear your praise sometime
[1:19:18] hey god wants you to brag about him
[1:19:20] sometime god wants you to talk about him
[1:19:22] sometime
[1:19:24] oh hallelujah
[1:19:26] and we know the devil don't like it when
[1:19:27] we talk about jesus
[1:19:29] i mean since the time he got up and
[1:19:31] sharing a powerful testimony of what god
[1:19:33] did for her and here come the devil with
[1:19:34] an attack say you can't stop her
[1:19:38] you can't stop none of us you just make
[1:19:41] the testimony greater with every trial
[1:19:47] stood up to praise the lord god of
[1:19:49] israel with a loud voice on how look at
[1:19:51] it and they rose early in the morning
[1:19:54] and went forth into the wilderness of
[1:19:56] tekoa see when you know god is with you
[1:19:58] you can get up early in the morning like
[1:20:00] that and as they went forth john joshua
[1:20:02] stood and said hear me
[1:20:04] o judah and you inhabitants of jerusalem
[1:20:08] look at this believe
[1:20:10] in the lord your god
[1:20:13] so shall ye be established
[1:20:18] hallelujah
[1:20:19] so shall you be established if you
[1:20:21] believe in the lord your god
[1:20:24] but if you want to prosper
[1:20:27] believe his prophets
[1:20:30] so shall you prosper
[1:20:34] now it was a prophet that came to them
[1:20:36] came to them to encourage them that you
[1:20:38] ain't got to fight in this battle the
[1:20:40] battle is not yours it is the lord's it
[1:20:42] was the prophet that gave them that
[1:20:44] encouragement don't be dismayed
[1:20:47] so so so joshua the king said now
[1:20:49] believe in his prophets
[1:20:52] you'll prosper
[1:20:54] all right let's keep going on and when
[1:20:56] he had consulted with the people
[1:20:59] this is the strategy right here he
[1:21:01] appointed singers unto the lord
[1:21:04] and that should praise the beauty of
[1:21:06] holiness
[1:21:07] as they went out before the army and to
[1:21:10] say praise the lord for his mercy
[1:21:13] endureth forever
[1:21:15] now i i like i like the way this is uh
[1:21:18] uh written you know even in in our in
[1:21:20] our natural army
[1:21:22] uh they have uh uh certain things that
[1:21:25] they sing
[1:21:26] you know as they're going out you know
[1:21:28] even as they're doing their drills and
[1:21:29] things like that they have certain songs
[1:21:30] that they sing you know you hear them
[1:21:32] you laugh left left right left
[1:21:35] i mean all of that stuff means something
[1:21:38] and when it comes to battle sometimes
[1:21:40] they have certain songs and there's an
[1:21:42] encouragement that these guys get just
[1:21:44] from you know just from being part of
[1:21:46] the army and some of the songs they say
[1:21:48] it's an encouragement it just kind of
[1:21:49] uplifts them
[1:21:51] hallelujah amen so before they even go
[1:21:53] into battle they have been anointed by a
[1:21:56] song i think i was watching uh some
[1:21:59] video
[1:22:00] on social media and they had they had
[1:22:02] all these guys in the army just standing
[1:22:04] there in a cafeteria just praising the
[1:22:06] lord singing songs of work and i don't
[1:22:08] know it just did something to me to see
[1:22:11] all these men and the women also in
[1:22:13] their um in their uniforms but they
[1:22:16] realize before they go out to battle
[1:22:17] they need to give god some praise
[1:22:24] this was not part of my notes let me
[1:22:26] just see something here really quick
[1:22:29] oh my my my my
[1:22:32] it's something about just following amen
[1:22:34] uh
[1:22:35] uh
[1:22:37] yeah um
[1:22:39] there was a i
[1:22:40] i was um
[1:22:42] i was uh um at the hospital visiting my
[1:22:45] biological father right before he passed
[1:22:48] and there was a a a chaplain that came
[1:22:50] walking through
[1:22:51] the um
[1:22:53] the hospital and he just you know
[1:22:54] praying for different people and you
[1:22:56] know we got to talking and he gave me
[1:22:58] this little card
[1:22:59] and on the card he uh he stuck
[1:23:02] uh he said this psalms 91. he said just
[1:23:04] put this in your wallet i said okay
[1:23:05] thank you i appreciate that and i knew
[1:23:07] what what psalms 91 was
[1:23:09] and he told me a story
[1:23:11] amen about this let's let's let's let's
[1:23:13] read psalms 91 and i'll tell you the
[1:23:14] story this one in my notes but god knows
[1:23:17] amen uh psalms 91 says this
[1:23:20] uh he that dwelleth
[1:23:23] in the secret place of the most high
[1:23:26] shall abide under the shadow of the
[1:23:27] almighty
[1:23:28] i will say of the lord he is my refuge
[1:23:32] and my fortress
[1:23:34] my god
[1:23:36] and him will i trust
[1:23:38] surely he shall deliver thee from the
[1:23:40] snare of the fowler and from the
[1:23:42] northern pestilence he shall covet thee
[1:23:45] with his feathers and on this wing shall
[1:23:47] thou trust his truth shall be thy shield
[1:23:49] and buckler
[1:23:51] amen thou shalt not be afraid for the
[1:23:53] terror by night nor for the arrow that
[1:23:55] flies by day
[1:23:56] nor for the pestilence that walketh in
[1:23:58] darkness nor for the destruction that
[1:24:00] wastes at that noon name a thousand
[1:24:03] shall fall at thy side and ten thousand
[1:24:06] at their right hand but it shall not
[1:24:09] come nigh thee
[1:24:11] glory to god
[1:24:13] only with thine eyes shall thou behold
[1:24:15] and see the reward of the wicked because
[1:24:17] thou has made the lord which is my
[1:24:19] refuge even the most high thy habitation
[1:24:22] there shall no evil befall thee
[1:24:25] neither shall any plague come nigh thy
[1:24:28] dwelling for he shall give his angels
[1:24:31] charge over thee to keep thee in all thy
[1:24:35] ways i'ma stop right there but as he was
[1:24:37] telling me he gave me this little
[1:24:38] scripture to put him out and my wallet
[1:24:40] says there was a um a military leader i
[1:24:43] think maybe a captain or something like
[1:24:44] that and one of the uh uh i think of the
[1:24:46] army and uh they were in a war zone
[1:24:50] and he told his uh he told his troops he
[1:24:52] says look uh i'm gonna be at such and
[1:24:54] such spot every morning and when i come
[1:24:57] there uh i'm gonna read psalm 91 and
[1:24:59] then we're just gonna disperse and go
[1:25:01] back go about our ways he says now i am
[1:25:03] not making anybody come to that spot he
[1:25:07] says but if you want to come it's up to
[1:25:09] you if you want to come to the spot i'm
[1:25:11] telling you what i'm doing i'm going to
[1:25:12] just read psalm 91 and we're going to
[1:25:13] disperse so every day he would go there
[1:25:16] and read and and just so happened all
[1:25:18] his troops decided we're going to come
[1:25:21] praise god and they would go there and
[1:25:22] they read in the war zone psalm 91.
[1:25:26] every day psalm 91 and every day that
[1:25:28] they would go and read nobody was lost
[1:25:31] to a battle no i mean their their their
[1:25:33] position was not attacked anything it
[1:25:35] was protected because they would read
[1:25:37] psalm 91 amen and one day uh they this
[1:25:41] group this troop uh and that captain
[1:25:43] they got transferred to another area and
[1:25:45] another group came in
[1:25:46] and when the next route came in that
[1:25:49] area got attacked
[1:25:51] right away now what do you think was
[1:25:53] keeping them right
[1:25:56] amen that man read that to his troops
[1:25:59] every day and god surrounded just that
[1:26:01] one little area and if god would do that
[1:26:04] for somebody in the army what will he do
[1:26:06] for you hallelujah
[1:26:09] glory to god we got we got to know that
[1:26:11] he cares
[1:26:13] amen amen let me go back over here to uh
[1:26:16] ii chronicles i didn't finish that amen
[1:26:19] second chronicles chapter 20. amen here
[1:26:22] believe his prophets and you'll prosper
[1:26:25] all right believe his prophets and
[1:26:27] you're prospering you can believe in the
[1:26:28] lord your god and it will establish it
[1:26:30] but believe his prophets you will
[1:26:32] prosper
[1:26:34] all right let's go on let's go on so
[1:26:36] here uh verse 20 says and they arose
[1:26:38] early in the morning went forth unto the
[1:26:40] witness of decor and as they went forth
[1:26:42] jehoshaphat uh um jehoshaphat stood and
[1:26:45] said hear me o judah and the inhabitants
[1:26:47] of jerusalem believe in the lord your
[1:26:49] god you shall be so shall you be
[1:26:50] established believe his prophet so so
[1:26:52] shall you prosper and when he had
[1:26:54] consulted with the people he appointed
[1:26:57] singers unto the lord and that should
[1:27:00] praise the beauty of holiness and as
[1:27:02] they went out before the army and to say
[1:27:05] praise the lord for his mercy and doeth
[1:27:07] forever when they begin to sing i like
[1:27:10] that when they begin to sing and to
[1:27:13] praise because sometimes you can sing
[1:27:16] without praising
[1:27:19] glory to god sometimes you that's
[1:27:21] singing because everybody else singing
[1:27:23] but when that thing become part of you
[1:27:26] and it's your own personal testimony you
[1:27:29] sing a little different
[1:27:31] hallelujah when they began to sing into
[1:27:33] praise
[1:27:34] the lord set ambushments against the
[1:27:37] children of armban
[1:27:39] moab and mount seir which would come
[1:27:42] which would come against judah and they
[1:27:45] were smitten
[1:27:47] i like this for the children of oman and
[1:27:49] moab stood up against the inhabitants of
[1:27:51] mount seir
[1:27:52] utterly the slave to slay and destroy
[1:27:55] them and when they had made an end of
[1:27:56] the inhabitants of seer everyone helped
[1:27:59] to destroy another this is why they need
[1:28:01] to fight in the battle because this army
[1:28:03] or these great armies are going to fight
[1:28:04] each other and kill each other and the
[1:28:06] children of israel didn't have nothing
[1:28:07] to worry about
[1:28:09] but i'm going to tell you what god did
[1:28:11] for the children israel after they after
[1:28:12] their enemies wiped each other out
[1:28:16] did they get me after their enemies
[1:28:19] wiped each other out here you go to
[1:28:21] children of israel standing right there
[1:28:22] to
[1:28:23] to get a gift
[1:28:27] let's just read it
[1:28:29] amen and and when judah came toward the
[1:28:32] watchtower
[1:28:33] in the wilderness they looked into the
[1:28:36] multitude and behold there were dead
[1:28:37] bodies falling to the earth and none
[1:28:40] escaped
[1:28:41] and when jehoshaphat and his people came
[1:28:44] to take away the spoil
[1:28:47] of them they found among them in
[1:28:50] abundance both riches with the dead
[1:28:53] bodies and precious jews which they
[1:28:56] stripped off for themselves more than
[1:28:59] they could carry away and they were
[1:29:02] three days
[1:29:06] in gathering of the spoil it was so much
[1:29:11] now they was afraid to go to battle at
[1:29:12] one time but god god allowed a prophet
[1:29:15] to rise up in their midst and say this
[1:29:18] battle is not yours but it's the lord's
[1:29:21] and i'm gonna take that fear from you
[1:29:23] and let you know god is with you in the
[1:29:25] midst of what you're facing
[1:29:27] praise god and all you got to do is just
[1:29:29] show up you ain't got to fight now there
[1:29:31] was a reason god wanted them to show up
[1:29:34] because if they didn't show up they
[1:29:36] would not be able to partake of the
[1:29:38] spoils
[1:29:39] you ain't got to fight but you'll be
[1:29:41] blessed just by showing up
[1:29:44] and before you show up give god some
[1:29:47] praise
[1:29:49] [Applause]
[1:29:52] him a song and give him praise
[1:29:55] and watch him change the situation
[1:30:02] i love it
[1:30:03] let's look at a little quote here from
[1:30:05] mary's belief
[1:30:06] you know uh brother quinton was telling
[1:30:08] me that
[1:30:09] the gentleman that that arranges for us
[1:30:11] to be able to get the room here in the
[1:30:12] school
[1:30:14] uh he's been working with us for about a
[1:30:15] whole year
[1:30:17] and he said he he texts brother clinton
[1:30:19] says you know what
[1:30:21] i forgot to tell them to turn that ac on
[1:30:24] in that room that y'all in
[1:30:27] and uh brother brother quinn say i think
[1:30:28] it's okay right now but i see these
[1:30:30] bodies
[1:30:32] uh we getting a little fans but i say
[1:30:34] it's okay the man said you know i was
[1:30:36] praying that everything would be okay
[1:30:37] for y'all
[1:30:39] huh
[1:30:42] what
[1:30:43] the the school administrator
[1:30:45] say you praying i told brother clinton i
[1:30:47] said you know i'm going to tell you
[1:30:48] something
[1:30:49] sometimes god has to put the bride in
[1:30:52] certain positions
[1:30:55] in order to give eternal life
[1:30:59] to others
[1:31:00] that will never come and hear this
[1:31:02] gospel
[1:31:04] but because they did something nice
[1:31:06] for the bride
[1:31:08] that gives them a place to eternal life
[1:31:10] and i'm gonna tell you i'm gonna be
[1:31:11] looking for this man
[1:31:13] on the other side ain't going to be
[1:31:16] wonder how did you get here what's your
[1:31:18] testimony all i did was sign a lease for
[1:31:21] a church
[1:31:28] amen all right let's look at this
[1:31:31] this this this this quote just to kind
[1:31:33] of line it up
[1:31:34] we are looking at the story of mary
[1:31:37] a man and um and before
[1:31:40] uh uh she gave birth to the lord jesus
[1:31:44] um
[1:31:45] she was testifying
[1:31:46] of her pregnancy before she felt
[1:31:49] anything
[1:31:50] now i just want you to watch this and
[1:31:52] and we might kind of slip back to the
[1:31:53] scripture in a second but uh but here
[1:31:56] you know god's prophet says mary
[1:31:59] she didn't wait till she was positive
[1:32:03] she didn't wait until until she seen
[1:32:06] some physical sign
[1:32:08] if if i look for a physical sign
[1:32:11] what i'm uh what i'm led for tonight i
[1:32:13] look for every seat in here to be taken
[1:32:15] up
[1:32:16] all right when the place is only about
[1:32:18] two-thirds full but that doesn't matter
[1:32:21] we don't have to have an overflowing
[1:32:24] crowd
[1:32:25] there was a hundred and twenty in the
[1:32:27] upper room but they were all in the hand
[1:32:30] of god god started a revival with them
[1:32:32] 120 completely surrendered into his
[1:32:35] hands that never ended
[1:32:38] a fire that cannot be put out
[1:32:40] what could god do here tonight with
[1:32:42] these hundred in his hands is just
[1:32:44] getting ready believe him holding his
[1:32:46] promise before him
[1:32:48] now you know i i want to i want to say
[1:32:50] this because you know i i'm gonna stop
[1:32:53] just for a second and say how i
[1:32:55] appreciate you all
[1:32:58] i just want to say i appreciate spirit
[1:32:59] and truth tabernacle
[1:33:01] um you know oftentimes you are you find
[1:33:04] that that people
[1:33:06] don't want to necessarily go to church
[1:33:08] in a plaza
[1:33:10] people don't want to go to a church in a
[1:33:12] school
[1:33:14] but if you get a building people just
[1:33:16] come from everywhere and want to be a
[1:33:18] part of church i want to thank god for
[1:33:20] y'all saints that help us push the wagon
[1:33:23] up the hill
[1:33:28] oh you're not just going to get on when
[1:33:30] we're rolling down
[1:33:32] but you help push the wagon up the hill
[1:33:33] that's why you know i appreciate what
[1:33:35] our deacon was saying we're going we're
[1:33:36] going to rejoice together
[1:33:38] but this is all part of all of our
[1:33:40] testimony so i thank god for you that
[1:33:43] you don't i mean that you i know
[1:33:45] what i feel like this is more than just
[1:33:47] an assembling of people together amen
[1:33:50] this is like like brother solomon said
[1:33:52] this in this prayer this is the dressing
[1:33:54] of the bride
[1:33:56] right amen we come because we get the
[1:33:58] words
[1:33:59] amen we come because we get we get fed
[1:34:02] we come because god do something for us
[1:34:04] spiritually and we're not just gathering
[1:34:06] just to be gathering amen
[1:34:08] sometimes i have to remember about my
[1:34:11] lord
[1:34:12] right i have to be reminded when my lord
[1:34:14] came to this earth
[1:34:16] he came in a stable
[1:34:19] i'm talking about the creator of the
[1:34:20] earth
[1:34:21] he came in a stable
[1:34:23] right so so so here he is uh as the
[1:34:26] creator and a humble surrounding like
[1:34:28] that don't forget the day of small
[1:34:30] beginnings
[1:34:34] so i had to just stop and say i thank
[1:34:35] y'all i appreciate your faithfulness
[1:34:38] i really really thank god for you we
[1:34:40] gonna rejoice together you ain't gotta
[1:34:42] you ain't just you just wait and see we
[1:34:44] gonna rejoice together hallelujah
[1:34:47] [Applause]
[1:34:52] oh my so much more i can say but i'ma
[1:34:55] i'ma cut it go back to this quote says
[1:34:58] mary
[1:34:59] now mary could have waited till she had
[1:35:01] some kind of sign
[1:35:02] that she was going to be mother
[1:35:05] says and you can wait after the meeting
[1:35:07] after meeting's over until you feel that
[1:35:10] you could move your crippled leg just a
[1:35:12] little better or you could hear a little
[1:35:14] better out of that death or the kansas
[1:35:16] scene to be that it wasn't bothering you
[1:35:18] so much that's not taking god at his
[1:35:21] word
[1:35:22] look at this to take god
[1:35:25] at his word
[1:35:26] is to hear his word
[1:35:30] anybody heard his word yet today
[1:35:33] no no you just don't stop at hearing his
[1:35:35] word the next part
[1:35:37] accept it
[1:35:39] that's god speaking directly to me and
[1:35:42] once you accepted it the next part
[1:35:45] start rejoicing with it
[1:35:50] hear the word accept it and then start
[1:35:53] rejoicing with it
[1:35:55] this is what mary began to do right she
[1:35:57] heard from the angel amen she accepted
[1:36:00] what the angels she said be it unto me
[1:36:03] according to thy word
[1:36:05] and then she began to rejoice with that
[1:36:07] word we're going to read it we're going
[1:36:08] to read it in a second i'm just i'm
[1:36:10] gonna just i i feel just to read it let
[1:36:12] me just keep reading this quote here
[1:36:13] says we could see 500 rush to the altar
[1:36:17] tonight which would be good which would
[1:36:19] be a good sign that the revival is going
[1:36:22] to break
[1:36:23] we don't have to have 500 at the altar
[1:36:26] we just have to take god's word for it
[1:36:28] and start rejoicing
[1:36:31] something will
[1:36:33] happen
[1:36:34] listen that brings the word to life as
[1:36:38] we water it
[1:36:40] with praises
[1:36:42] if you want your promise to live
[1:36:46] you're gonna have to start warning your
[1:36:48] promise
[1:36:49] with your praises
[1:36:52] it ain't gonna be good enough for me to
[1:36:54] praise god for the promise that he gave
[1:36:56] you
[1:36:56] but you got to start warning your own
[1:36:59] promise with your praises
[1:37:02] just this week i was
[1:37:04] um i was i was you know at the at the
[1:37:07] house and you know we kind of it just
[1:37:09] seems like uh uh the grass dying and and
[1:37:12] and and the trees kind of uh uh drying
[1:37:15] up and everything and you know i just
[1:37:17] noticed that hey something wrong my
[1:37:18] sprinkler system ain't getting the water
[1:37:19] that it should be getting you can take
[1:37:21] that down for me i said let me get out
[1:37:23] here and try to fix this thing let me
[1:37:25] try to get this thing fixed so then what
[1:37:26] i what i did i looked at a couple trees
[1:37:28] in the front of the front of my house
[1:37:30] and said we got to get this thing we got
[1:37:31] to get this thing going so i say um
[1:37:34] i said let me get some water and i saw
[1:37:36] my the leaves on the tree just just they
[1:37:38] when when they die when they live and
[1:37:40] they perk up
[1:37:41] but when they die they droop down and
[1:37:44] you got to catch them in that droopy
[1:37:45] stage
[1:37:46] oh come on somebody you got to catch
[1:37:48] them in that droopy stage because if you
[1:37:50] don't catch them then they'll fall off
[1:37:52] praise god but but as i saw him in the
[1:37:54] drupal stage let me i said let me just
[1:37:56] take some water and just start giving it
[1:37:57] to these giving it right here to this
[1:37:59] area not wait for the sprinklers i'll
[1:38:00] just i'll do it manually and i start
[1:38:02] putting water in certain areas and just
[1:38:04] just i say okay let me set it here let
[1:38:06] me set it there let me set it here i
[1:38:07] went back out the next morning
[1:38:09] and i was looking as the sun was
[1:38:10] striking that leaf that leaf that was
[1:38:12] drooping
[1:38:14] come on somebody
[1:38:15] all of a sudden was perked up
[1:38:18] and looked very very healthy
[1:38:20] and and the weight of the tree went from
[1:38:22] drooping to healthy is because i simply
[1:38:24] gave it water
[1:38:27] do you feel a little droopy
[1:38:30] in your spirit do you feel a little
[1:38:32] droopy
[1:38:33] but the best way to get from droopiness
[1:38:36] amen to being alive again is start
[1:38:39] giving god his praise
[1:38:46] let's read this out of uh
[1:38:47] out of uh luke 1 luke 1 verse 35
[1:38:53] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:38:56] hey there's power in our praise

[1:39:04] we're not waiting
[1:39:06] a man to see some manifestation before
[1:39:08] we give god the praise
[1:39:10] we're going to take him at his word
[1:39:12] we're going to accept it and we're going
[1:39:14] to start rejoicing with what we got
[1:39:17] hallelujah hallelujah i'm rejoicing
[1:39:20] about the 40-day prophecy
[1:39:23] amen i accepted and i'm rejoicing
[1:39:26] hallelujah hallelujah glory to god here
[1:39:29] in luke 1
[1:39:30] 35 what were that 40 day prophecy that
[1:39:32] we're going to see something
[1:39:33] supernatural
[1:39:35] within 40 days
[1:39:36] and we've already started seeing it
[1:39:39] but i'm expecting more
[1:39:41] i heard the man that was eating
[1:39:42] watermelon says got to be more where
[1:39:44] that come from
[1:39:45] amen all right all right come on let's
[1:39:47] let's let's read this says and the angel
[1:39:49] answered and said unto her the holy
[1:39:51] ghost shall come upon thee and the power
[1:39:54] of the highest shall overshadow thee
[1:39:56] therefore also that holy thing which
[1:39:59] shall be born of thee shall be called
[1:40:00] the son of god
[1:40:02] amen and behold thy cousin elizabeth
[1:40:06] she hath also conceived a son in her old
[1:40:08] age and i was listening to a quote
[1:40:09] brother branham said elizabeth was about
[1:40:11] 70 years old
[1:40:14] can you imagine that
[1:40:16] 70 years old
[1:40:17] and not not now some of my sisters
[1:40:19] that's that's that doesn't hit 70
[1:40:20] already they saying to themselves ain't
[1:40:23] no way
[1:40:25] i'll be carrying a baby at 70. but i'ma
[1:40:28] tell you something if you was elizabeth
[1:40:31] and you had not ever had a baby and you
[1:40:34] realize the
[1:40:36] uh uh the uh the stigma that was
[1:40:39] associated with a woman that never had a
[1:40:41] child it meant something to them to have
[1:40:44] a baby
[1:40:45] now it means something to people to have
[1:40:47] cats and dogs
[1:40:49] but it meant something to them to have a
[1:40:51] baby
[1:40:52] right and if you would if you would have
[1:40:53] been in her shoes and never had a baby
[1:40:56] and and now all of a sudden at 70 it's a
[1:40:59] miracle for you to just even be able to
[1:41:01] bear
[1:41:02] to be able to carry a child at 70.

[1:41:43] was called baron
[1:41:47] she's not gonna bear that reproach
[1:41:49] anymore
[1:41:50] six months she's been pregnant and you
[1:41:52] know you can imagine mary has no idea
[1:41:54] that her cousin's pregnant and she's
[1:41:55] been pregnant for six months
[1:41:58] elizabeth is probably hiding
[1:42:00] hallelujah not letting anybody know what
[1:42:03] is going on about maybe she i i i can't
[1:42:06] know if i don't even know if i can trust
[1:42:07] what the aim does i haven't lost too
[1:42:09] many babies before and at this age to
[1:42:11] have a baby
[1:42:13] six months she's pregnant
[1:42:15] imagine get yourself on the scene and
[1:42:16] see what's going on look at this uh it
[1:42:18] says who has who has called or who was
[1:42:21] called barren
[1:42:23] a for with god
[1:42:26] nothing shall be impossible
[1:42:30] and mary said behold the handmaid of
[1:42:32] lord being unto me according to the word
[1:42:34] and the angel departed her right when
[1:42:36] she said that that's when the pregnancy
[1:42:38] took place in mary when she accepted the
[1:42:41] words the pregnancy happened right then
[1:42:45] now let's go a little further because
[1:42:46] she didn't just stop and just accepting
[1:42:48] the word she heard the word she accept
[1:42:50] the word but then she began to rejoice
[1:42:53] now look at what happened with mary
[1:42:54] after the angel departed look at the
[1:42:56] next verse and mary arose
[1:42:59] in those days and went into the hill
[1:43:02] country
[1:43:03] how she how did she go yo
[1:43:07] how did she go she wasn't just kind of
[1:43:09] uh trying you know i get there when i
[1:43:11] get there
[1:43:12] no no no she went with hates
[1:43:15] she was in a hurry i mean she had just
[1:43:17] had a visitation from the angel and and
[1:43:20] she wants to go and tell elizabeth
[1:43:22] exactly what she heard now look at what
[1:43:23] this says she went with haste went into
[1:43:25] the hill country with haste into a city
[1:43:28] of judah
[1:43:29] and entered into the house of zacharias
[1:43:32] and saluted elizabeth
[1:43:35] amen
[1:43:36] and it came to pass
[1:43:39] that when elizabeth heard the salutation
[1:43:41] of mary
[1:43:42] the babe leaped in her womb and
[1:43:45] elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost
[1:43:48] now now we got to get ourselves on the
[1:43:50] scene and we got to read in between the
[1:43:51] lines what just happened here
[1:43:53] here come me
[1:43:55] here comes mary in haste
[1:43:58] i can see her knocking on the door hey
[1:44:00] hey hey y'all home
[1:44:02] and and now imagine elizabeth is in her
[1:44:05] 70s mary is about 18 years old good god
[1:44:08] of mine they don't really have much in
[1:44:10] common they probably wouldn't be uh
[1:44:13] a pen pass to one another glory to god
[1:44:16] but they that but what brought this
[1:44:18] thing in common is when the supernatural
[1:44:21] begin to happen in mary
[1:44:23] and mary understood that the
[1:44:25] supernatural was also happening in
[1:44:27] elizabeth so here come mary and knowing
[1:44:30] that elizabeth is six months pregnant i
[1:44:32] gotta get there and just greet her
[1:44:34] and as the salutations this is a
[1:44:36] greeting and and maybe they just talk
[1:44:38] and say i ain't singing so long and you
[1:44:40] know this happened that's happening and
[1:44:42] this been happening and that been
[1:44:44] happening they say you say uh me and
[1:44:46] joseph we're gonna get married we're
[1:44:47] engaged to get married but you know what
[1:44:49] elizabeth uh i'm pregnant she said oh
[1:44:51] y'all already got medicine no i didn't
[1:44:53] get married yet
[1:44:55] what you mean you didn't get married yet
[1:44:57] so i said no not not yet but but you
[1:44:59] know uh i am pregnant same like now you
[1:45:01] know what that mean mary you know he
[1:45:03] might leave you he might just no no no
[1:45:05] he gonna stay with me i'm pregnant and
[1:45:07] he said well i said i don't know i don't
[1:45:09] get it mary said but you know the same
[1:45:10] angel that told me that i was gonna have
[1:45:12] this baby glory to god it's the same
[1:45:15] angel that told me that you're six
[1:45:17] months pregnant
[1:45:20] how you know that mary the angel told me
[1:45:22] that it said i'm gonna tell you another
[1:45:23] thing the angel told me the angel told
[1:45:25] me what i should name my baby well what
[1:45:27] his name gonna be mary you ready for it
[1:45:30] elizabeth yes i'm ready for his name
[1:45:32] gonna be jesus
[1:45:33] and elizabeth felt something
[1:45:37] my god she felt something he said
[1:45:40] what you say his name gonna be
[1:45:43] jesus
[1:45:47] and things begin to move in the inside
[1:45:49] of your lips she said the baby that i've
[1:45:51] been pregnant with have not moved for
[1:45:53] six months but when you just came and
[1:45:56] gave his name
[1:45:58] hallelujah just at his name dead things
[1:46:02] will live
[1:46:04] [Music]
[1:46:07] situations change when we call his name
[1:46:10] when we praise his name
[1:46:16] she said she said she said oh my
[1:46:18] so and here we pick it up in the
[1:46:20] scripture
[1:46:21] uh
[1:46:22] verse 41 that came to pass that when
[1:46:24] elizabeth heard the salutation marriage
[1:46:25] that the babe leaped in the womb and
[1:46:27] elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost
[1:46:29] and she spoke out with a loud voice
[1:46:36] i don't know where we get the quiet
[1:46:37] voice from can you can somebody just
[1:46:39] show me that in scripture where where
[1:46:42] are we supposed to praise god with the
[1:46:43] quiet voice
[1:46:44] the mouse voice
[1:46:46] it seemed like every time god do
[1:46:48] something for somebody in scripture they
[1:46:50] lift it up loud
[1:46:55] look the bible says uh and she spake
[1:46:58] with a loud voice
[1:47:00] and said blessed art thou
[1:47:03] among women and blessed is the fruit of
[1:47:05] thy womb
[1:47:06] and whence is and whence is this to me
[1:47:10] that the mother of my lord should come
[1:47:11] to me
[1:47:13] look at it
[1:47:14] she says forth low for low as soon as
[1:47:17] the voice of thy salutation sounded
[1:47:20] in mine ears the babe leaped in my womb
[1:47:24] for joy
[1:47:27] and i like this verse right here because
[1:47:29] this is your promise
[1:47:31] and when you when you hear your promise
[1:47:34] accept it and start rejoicing with it
[1:47:38] here it is
[1:47:40] blessed is she
[1:47:43] that believed
[1:47:45] blessed is she
[1:47:47] that believed
[1:47:49] for there shall be a performance
[1:47:53] of those things which which were told
[1:47:55] her from the lord
[1:47:58] amen that is your promise for today
[1:48:02] and what that actually means when it
[1:48:04] says there shall be a performance that
[1:48:06] says it shall be a manifestation in your
[1:48:10] life
[1:48:14] i accept it
[1:48:16] and i'm going to start rejoicing in that
[1:48:19] because god told me
[1:48:21] there shall be a performance
[1:48:23] oh yeah there's going to be a
[1:48:24] performance of this 40-day prophecy
[1:48:28] hey there's going to be a performance
[1:48:30] i'm going to see my family come back in
[1:48:33] it's going to be a performance of every
[1:48:34] promise god made me my body will
[1:48:37] experience healing there shall be a
[1:48:39] performance of those things that god
[1:48:41] promised me
[1:48:44] accept it start rejoicing with it
[1:48:49] can we slip back now and and pick up
[1:48:52] our scripture
[1:48:54] oh my my my my my
[1:48:57] we were reading over here in acts
[1:49:00] 16
[1:49:03] and um
[1:49:04] as we were just picking this up see
[1:49:05] there's power in your praise church you
[1:49:07] got to understand that amen there there
[1:49:10] is there's some some serious power in
[1:49:12] your praise
[1:49:14] your praise is what changes things
[1:49:17] your praise is what does it mean all
[1:49:19] right you know uh just before we get
[1:49:22] back to our scripture just a a quick um
[1:49:25] testimony you all remember
[1:49:26] uh brother branham prayed for john ryan
[1:49:30] and a man was blind um and and here you
[1:49:33] know uh he went through the prayer line
[1:49:34] got prayed for and he says now he says
[1:49:36] preacher i thought you said i was healed
[1:49:38] he says yeah i said you was healed i
[1:49:40] thought you said you believe
[1:49:41] he said i i do believe
[1:49:44] he says well you know uh it says but i
[1:49:46] i'm hearing this person got healed and
[1:49:48] things happening right away and this
[1:49:50] person that but for me i'm still blind
[1:49:52] what should i do he says what you need
[1:49:53] to do you know to just start thanking
[1:49:55] god for your healing
[1:49:58] so just just just find a way to start
[1:50:00] thanking god for your healing he says
[1:50:01] well okay all right that's what i do
[1:50:03] so he uh he was a newspaper salesman and
[1:50:06] he would sell his newspaper and actually
[1:50:08] before before he was before he did the
[1:50:10] newspaper he would stand up in church
[1:50:13] say excuse me i'm sorry to interrupt the
[1:50:15] service but i want to thank god for my
[1:50:17] healing
[1:50:20] sit back down come back the next night
[1:50:22] hey i'm sorry again interrupt the
[1:50:23] service but i want to thank god for my
[1:50:25] healing
[1:50:27] and he just praise the lord i thank god
[1:50:29] for my healing
[1:50:30] and so so so uh he's selling newspapers
[1:50:33] and as he's at that and it seemed like
[1:50:35] he started in church but then he took
[1:50:37] what was in church out to the streets
[1:50:40] and he had a newspaper to say he says uh
[1:50:42] extra extra read all about it thank god
[1:50:45] for my healing
[1:50:47] you know always add that to it extra
[1:50:49] extra read all about it thank god for my
[1:50:51] healing and he went on weeks and weeks
[1:50:54] like this and and one day he's sitting
[1:50:56] in the chair of the barber hallelujah
[1:50:58] and the bible say now look you're going
[1:51:00] to bring shame on the gospel with you
[1:51:02] always talk about thank god for your
[1:51:03] healing you know you're still blindish i
[1:51:05] don't know what he says i understand
[1:51:07] that but i'm still thanking god for my
[1:51:08] healing he said well you need to stop
[1:51:10] doing that say no thank god for my
[1:51:12] healing i'm gonna let you take it out of
[1:51:13] me and nobody else i'm gonna sell my
[1:51:15] papers and i'm gonna keep thanking god
[1:51:17] for my healing and he said right there
[1:51:19] one more time to the bible thank god for
[1:51:20] my healing hey
[1:51:22] come running out the barber chair
[1:51:25] hear the barber running behind him with
[1:51:27] all the tools and saying you're gonna
[1:51:28] get hit by a car say no i'm gonna get
[1:51:30] hit by nothing i can see the car i can
[1:51:32] see this i can see that i thank god for
[1:51:35] my healing
[1:51:38] and what brought the healing to john
[1:51:39] ryan was when he began to water the
[1:51:41] promise
[1:51:43] with his praise
[1:51:46] there is power
[1:51:49] in your praise
[1:51:53] here we look at this this story
[1:51:57] with uh
[1:51:59] with paul
[1:52:00] and silas
[1:52:02] um
[1:52:06] they are uh in a situation where they're
[1:52:08] trying to go in a particular direction
[1:52:10] and god's blocking it
[1:52:12] then they try to go somewhere else and
[1:52:13] then god just blocks that
[1:52:15] and everything they were trying to do in
[1:52:17] their own god would block
[1:52:19] anytime you try to do it on your own i
[1:52:21] pray god will block it
[1:52:23] you realize you need him
[1:52:25] oh hallelujah and let me tell you
[1:52:27] another thing before i get there
[1:52:29] sometimes you can offer god a premature
[1:52:32] praise
[1:52:37] brother jack what you mean well brother
[1:52:39] branham
[1:52:40] asked the lord for three squirrels one
[1:52:41] time
[1:52:44] he was very specific about them
[1:52:45] squirrels he wanted three squirrels
[1:52:48] and god said uh okay to say where they
[1:52:50] gonna be and you can have it this gonna
[1:52:51] do this just gonna do that shot the
[1:52:53] squirrel got it
[1:52:54] next world where you want that one to be
[1:52:56] this one do this shot the squirrel got
[1:52:58] it and then uh he offered god
[1:53:00] a premature praise lord i thank you for
[1:53:03] my two squirrels and lord i appreciate
[1:53:05] it god i'll go home and tell the
[1:53:07] testimony god said no don't go nowhere
[1:53:10] how many did you ask for
[1:53:13] say you asked for three that's what
[1:53:14] you're gonna get
[1:53:16] and here's the thing i'm gonna tell you
[1:53:17] what get us this is the problem right
[1:53:19] here for all of us everybody including
[1:53:21] this when we have to wait
[1:53:24] on the lord
[1:53:27] you start getting all kind of ideas
[1:53:28] while you're waiting but i'm gonna tell
[1:53:30] you what you're supposed to do while
[1:53:31] you're waiting
[1:53:33] wait in praise
[1:53:35] that's all you do while you're waiting
[1:53:37] just praise god and wait
[1:53:39] because there shall be a performance of
[1:53:41] those things that he promised you
[1:53:44] don't give god a premature praise
[1:53:46] [Music]
[1:53:52] all
[1:53:52] right amen
[1:53:54] here paul and silas
[1:53:57] um are on the way you know trying to
[1:53:59] find these different places that they
[1:54:01] want to go and god just blocking
[1:54:02] everything they do no no don't do that
[1:54:04] don't do that and here paul ends up
[1:54:06] having a a vision in the night and this
[1:54:10] vision comes and says hey
[1:54:11] uh
[1:54:12] there's a man standing in macedonia
[1:54:16] uh that's saying in paul send apollo
[1:54:18] vision come help us we need help over
[1:54:20] here in macedonia so there paul got a a
[1:54:22] a sense of comfort in his heart that
[1:54:24] this is the direction that i should go i
[1:54:27] should be headed towards macedonia so
[1:54:29] immediately when god showed it to him he
[1:54:30] got an action
[1:54:32] and as he's on his way to
[1:54:34] uh macedonia goes through different
[1:54:36] places and and and and here's the the
[1:54:39] the thing about it you can be doing the
[1:54:40] will of god
[1:54:42] but still get attacked by the enemy
[1:54:44] right and while paul was there i believe
[1:54:46] he came in contact with um
[1:54:49] um
[1:54:50] a couple different people but there was
[1:54:52] a you know and i'm trying to find her
[1:54:54] name right now
[1:54:55] uh
[1:54:56] oh god i think i want to say it's not
[1:54:59] tabitha something else i cannot think of
[1:55:00] her name right now uh but but
[1:55:05] lydia lydia was her name so here paul
[1:55:07] comes in contact with lydia and lydia's
[1:55:09] receiving him receiving them in the
[1:55:10] house but here's the thing no matter how
[1:55:13] blessed lydia's house is
[1:55:15] glory to god
[1:55:16] paul realizes in the vision there is a
[1:55:18] man
[1:55:20] in macedonia that's saying come help us
[1:55:22] now paul is there in the city uh he's
[1:55:25] working with lydia lydia has accepted
[1:55:27] them into her home and then uh there's
[1:55:29] another young lady that's kind of got a
[1:55:32] spirit on a of you know witchcraft
[1:55:34] pretty much and and these men are men
[1:55:36] and the great the most high god these
[1:55:38] men and paul just you know doing
[1:55:39] whatever uh to kind of get this this
[1:55:41] late to get this spirit off this lady
[1:55:42] and when the spirit came off the girl
[1:55:44] uh her
[1:55:46] her
[1:55:47] employer
[1:55:49] was upset with paul so you don't mess
[1:55:52] with my money
[1:55:54] the lady was delivered
[1:55:56] but but this was his way to get money so
[1:55:59] you don't miss my money so paul and
[1:56:01] silas ends up in jail because somebody
[1:56:04] got delivered
[1:56:12] let's read their story
[1:56:14] but here's a there's a good part about
[1:56:16] it
[1:56:17] the man that was in macedonia
[1:56:20] was a man that was in jail
[1:56:22] and the only way paul could get to the
[1:56:24] man is by getting this girl delivered
[1:56:29] he would have never been nowhere near
[1:56:31] the man
[1:56:32] had he not brought deliverance to this
[1:56:34] girl
[1:56:35] i mean sometimes we look at things that
[1:56:37] happen in our life and we just assume
[1:56:40] that this is the devil
[1:56:42] but sometimes god is orchestrating a
[1:56:44] plan
[1:56:45] and in the midst of all the
[1:56:47] orchestration i'm telling you one thing
[1:56:49] you can look back and see how god has
[1:56:51] orchestrated certain things in your life
[1:56:54] certain people he had placed in your
[1:56:56] life oh good god
[1:56:57] certain business partners that he put in
[1:56:59] your life certain decisions you have to
[1:57:01] come you can look back and now in the
[1:57:04] past and give god praise for putting the
[1:57:07] people in your life
[1:57:11] i thank god he put some men in my life
[1:57:14] that would that would be that would be
[1:57:16] strong enough
[1:57:18] strong enough mentally to fire a pastor
[1:57:26] look
[1:57:27] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:57:28] whisperer told us it take a certain kind
[1:57:30] of man
[1:57:31] for a certain kind of job
[1:57:35] you got to have certain qualities
[1:57:36] because some people like no i just
[1:57:37] respect pastors too much i'm gonna just
[1:57:39] deal with no no no no he had to make
[1:57:41] these guys a certain way that they would
[1:57:44] put a pastor out of work
[1:57:48] and i'm gonna tell you i look back and i
[1:57:50] say lord i thank you
[1:57:53] because had they not done what they did
[1:57:55] i wouldn't be where i'm at right now
[1:58:00] amen
[1:58:02] and when when i think about these things
[1:58:04] you know it just it just things just all
[1:58:07] all kind of thoughts go through my head
[1:58:09] when i when i was working
[1:58:11] and i would get an invitation to go
[1:58:13] somewhere somebody invite me to come
[1:58:15] come speak it was always
[1:58:17] no
[1:58:19] and i had a good reason
[1:58:21] i got to work
[1:58:23] i can't get off no time on my job
[1:58:26] but but but when god delivers me from
[1:58:28] the job
[1:58:30] and then he presents the same
[1:58:31] opportunity to me
[1:58:33] nah
[1:58:34] i got to say lord help me
[1:58:37] where do you want me to go
[1:58:39] because you know what i realized it was
[1:58:40] you that did this back here so now

[2:00:08] always had it
[2:00:13] i'm just realizing it
[2:00:15] god got this
[2:00:19] thank god for the people he put in my
[2:00:20] life that
[2:00:21] that allowed me to go through certain
[2:00:23] trials if they didn't have that type of
[2:00:25] disposition
[2:00:26] it wouldn't have pushed me to where i
[2:00:27] need to be right now
[2:00:33] let me let me try to read this
[2:00:35] let me try to read this hey you got to
[2:00:37] learn how to praise god
[2:00:41] here so
[2:00:43] paul would have never met this man
[2:00:46] had he not gone through the trial of
[2:00:49] casting out this demon out of that girl
[2:00:51] and because the man's money was the her
[2:00:53] employer's money was was all uh messed
[2:00:56] up because the girl is free and not
[2:00:58] seeing under that spirit anymore he said
[2:01:00] paul and sausage i got to go to jail
[2:01:02] beat him did all kinds of things and
[2:01:04] threw these guys in jail now let's pick
[2:01:06] it up
[2:01:07] amen here in um
[2:01:12] acts 16 verse 25.
[2:01:19] actually you know what maybe maybe start
[2:01:20] back a little bit
[2:01:23] 16 acts 16 16. and it came to pass as we
[2:01:26] went to prayer
[2:01:28] certain damsel possessed with the spirit
[2:01:29] of divination
[2:01:31] met us which brought uh brought
[2:01:33] her masters much gained by sue saying
[2:01:37] same followed paul and and us in christ
[2:01:40] saying these men are the servants of the
[2:01:41] most high god which
[2:01:43] showings us the way of salvation
[2:01:45] and this did see many days but paul
[2:01:47] being grieved turned and said to the
[2:01:50] spirit i command thee in the name of
[2:01:52] jesus christ to come out of her
[2:01:55] and he came out the same hour
[2:01:58] and when a master saw that the hope of
[2:02:00] their gains was gone they called paul
[2:02:03] and silas and drew them into the
[2:02:04] marketplace unto the rulers
[2:02:07] and brought them to the magistrates
[2:02:08] saying these men being jews do
[2:02:10] exceedingly trouble our city
[2:02:13] and teach customs which are not lawful
[2:02:15] for us to receive neither to observe
[2:02:17] being romans
[2:02:19] and the multitudes rose up together
[2:02:20] against them and the magistrates ran off
[2:02:22] their clothes and commanded to beat them
[2:02:24] and when they had laid many stripes upon
[2:02:27] them they cast them into prison charging
[2:02:29] the jailer jailer to keep them safely
[2:02:33] who having received such a charge
[2:02:36] thrust them into the inner prison
[2:02:39] and made their feet fast
[2:02:42] in stocks now i want you to kind of get
[2:02:44] a picture in your head here what this
[2:02:46] means to have your feet fast in stocks
[2:02:49] they would actually um
[2:02:52] take your feet and put shackles you know
[2:02:54] on them
[2:02:55] and also take your hands and put
[2:02:57] shackles on them and then they'd also
[2:02:59] take your neck and put a shackle around
[2:03:01] your neck and brother branham said what
[2:03:02] they would do is they would they would
[2:03:04] have just a drip of water
[2:03:06] that would hit you right on the top of
[2:03:07] the head
[2:03:08] just drip
[2:03:11] and at first it don't mean nothing i i
[2:03:14] got that but when it keep happening over
[2:03:16] and over again it just began to drive
[2:03:18] you crazy
[2:03:21] so they really they really put them in
[2:03:23] some real uh uh uh i mean a really
[2:03:25] really hard position while they're there
[2:03:27] in prison
[2:03:28] now let's let's let's keep reading
[2:03:30] amen verse um
[2:03:33] 24 who having received such a charge
[2:03:35] thrust them into the inner prison
[2:03:37] and made their feet fast in stocks
[2:03:41] i like this
[2:03:43] now remember in the vision
[2:03:45] this man came to paul
[2:03:48] at night
[2:03:50] we read that earlier
[2:03:52] when when paul saw the man in macedonia
[2:03:55] he had a vision
[2:03:56] at night
[2:03:57] now look at this
[2:03:59] verse 25 and at midnight
[2:04:03] paul and silas
[2:04:05] prayed
[2:04:07] now they didn't stop there and
[2:04:11] sing praises
[2:04:13] unto god
[2:04:14] and you can just imagine as a singing
[2:04:17] you know brother brother brother brother
[2:04:18] brother brother branham said now he put
[2:04:20] it in today's terms i know that they
[2:04:22] didn't they didn't do that back then but
[2:04:23] he was saying maybe you know they got
[2:04:25] the singing uh just a couple songs maybe
[2:04:28] there is power
[2:04:31] power wonder working power
[2:04:34] in the blood
[2:04:36] of the lamb i'ma tell you some of y'all
[2:04:39] be in concert at home
[2:04:41] y'all get one of those songs just go to
[2:04:42] work y'all get in concert mode
[2:04:45] there is power power
[2:04:47] wonder work and power and you don't be
[2:04:49] needing nobody to help you in the
[2:04:52] precious blood of the lamb
[2:04:56] good god almighty
[2:04:58] then he said then he said maybe they got
[2:04:59] into oh how i love jesus
[2:05:03] i'm talking about i'm hearing my stocks
[2:05:05] i got water dripping on my head but i'm
[2:05:07] saying oh
[2:05:09] how i love jesus
[2:05:12] oh
[2:05:13] how i love jesus good god almighty
[2:05:17] because he
[2:05:21] and i could see the prisons like what in
[2:05:23] the world
[2:05:25] oh
[2:05:26] god
[2:05:27] how i love cheese and i'm going to tell
[2:05:29] you i see
[2:05:31] my friend my good friend and i said why
[2:05:33] y'all put that o and everything
[2:05:35] that's just a expression
[2:05:37] from the heart my brother
[2:05:39] you got you got to understand that
[2:05:42] he said y'all and he said y'all even put
[2:05:43] the words on the screen just
[2:05:47] yeah and you better hit every one of
[2:05:49] them too
[2:05:52] that's an expression from the heart my
[2:05:54] brother
[2:05:56] oh
[2:05:58] yes sir
[2:06:00] why that why you think they put oh how i
[2:06:02] love jesus
[2:06:04] oh
[2:06:06] how i love jesus they thought about it
[2:06:09] because he first loved me
[2:06:17] to me
[2:06:19] he is so wonderful
[2:06:23] i said to me
[2:06:25] he is so wonderful
[2:06:28] to me
[2:06:29] he is so wonderful
[2:06:33] because he first loved me
[2:06:37] oh good god almighty so they got down
[2:06:40] there just began to sing some of them
[2:06:42] songs
[2:06:43] the other prisoners heard them
[2:06:46] and as they were listening to paul and
[2:06:47] silas just just two of them i told you
[2:06:49] just just that one of us and i like
[2:06:52] that's why i like psalms 34 so you
[2:06:53] magnify the lord
[2:06:55] with me
[2:06:56] let us exalt his name together all right
[2:06:59] so he said i can do it by myself
[2:07:01] and and i can drive devils out with my
[2:07:03] praise by myself i've done it i've done
[2:07:06] it before amen but i'ma tell you it's
[2:07:08] just something when we do this thing
[2:07:10] together
[2:07:13] it'd get contagious in the house
[2:07:15] but here paul and silas are just
[2:07:17] worshiping the lord they're praying and
[2:07:19] they're doing this at midnight singing
[2:07:21] praises unto god
[2:07:23] amen and the bible says and the
[2:07:24] prisoners heard them
[2:07:26] glory to god
[2:07:28] there's power in our praise
[2:07:30] and suddenly
[2:07:33] there was a great earthquake
[2:07:36] so that the foundations of the prison
[2:07:38] were shaken and immediately all the
[2:07:42] doors were open and everyone's bands
[2:07:45] were loose
[2:07:46] now here brother random tells us what
[2:07:48] happened here with this prison because
[2:07:49] you got to understand the prison cells
[2:07:52] are attached to the foundation amen and
[2:07:54] to the walls so what god has to do is
[2:07:57] disrupt the foundation
[2:07:59] come on somebody and by disrupting the
[2:08:01] foundation it causes the walls to fall
[2:08:06] right and and not only did god cause the
[2:08:09] walls to fall amen god was so perfect
[2:08:11] that even when the walls and i don't
[2:08:13] know what they were attached to with
[2:08:14] these stocks but god caused the stocks
[2:08:16] to be broken
[2:08:18] and all this came from somebody praising
[2:08:22] hallelujah the starks can be broken in
[2:08:25] the lives of your children in the lives
[2:08:27] of your love if you would just learn to
[2:08:29] give god praise stop fussing with them
[2:08:32] start arguing with them and start giving
[2:08:34] god praise for his promise being
[2:08:36] fulfilled in their life watch the stocks
[2:08:39] get broken
[2:08:42] brother branham say the wolves actually
[2:08:43] fell away from them
[2:08:46] rather than on them the walls actually
[2:08:48] fell away from them
[2:08:51] i'm going to tell you something about
[2:08:52] god
[2:08:53] he's perfect
[2:08:57] he's considering every detail
[2:09:01] and can you imagine
[2:09:03] you imagine this let's just keep reading
[2:09:05] the story because
[2:09:06] uh after this earthquake something
[2:09:08] happened
[2:09:09] verse 27 tells us
[2:09:12] the keeper of the prison
[2:09:14] awaken out of his sleep
[2:09:18] seeing the prison doors open
[2:09:21] he just every prisoner's door is open
[2:09:24] i'ma say that again
[2:09:27] every
[2:09:29] prisoner's door
[2:09:31] is open
[2:09:35] all you got to do is walk out
[2:09:37] [Music]
[2:09:39] every prisoner's door is open
[2:09:47] look at it
[2:09:49] um
[2:09:51] keep in the prison awaking out of his
[2:09:53] sleep and seeing the prison doors open
[2:09:55] he drew out his sword
[2:09:58] and would have killed himself
[2:10:00] supposing that the prisoners had been
[2:10:02] fled
[2:10:04] but paul cried with a loud voice saying
[2:10:08] do thyself no harm
[2:10:10] for we are all
[2:10:12] here
[2:10:16] i'm gonna tell you what happened that
[2:10:17] prison became a church
[2:10:21] because wherever the saints are gathered
[2:10:24] is church
[2:10:27] paul crabbe live was do thou seven harm
[2:10:29] for we all here then he called for light
[2:10:33] and sprang in
[2:10:34] and came trembling and fell down before
[2:10:38] paul and silas
[2:10:40] and brought them out and said sirs
[2:10:44] what must i do
[2:10:48] to be saved
[2:10:50] so you need to start thanking god
[2:10:53] for salvation
[2:10:57] what do i what do what what must i do to
[2:11:00] be saved
[2:11:04] and this salvation they talk about some
[2:11:05] something totally different what just
[2:11:06] happened to these prisoners they were
[2:11:08] they were they were saved from a prison
[2:11:10] sentence but this man wanted eternal
[2:11:12] salvation right he said and they said
[2:11:15] believe
[2:11:17] on the lord jesus christ
[2:11:20] thou shalt be saved
[2:11:22] and
[2:11:23] the house
[2:11:26] there's so much in this y'all
[2:11:28] you know and here here's it here's what
[2:11:30] the prophet tells us about this you know
[2:11:33] uh first first thing i want to say the
[2:11:35] man that paul said believe
[2:11:37] on the lord jesus christ
[2:11:40] now i read the scripture earlier about
[2:11:42] believe on the lord your god so shall
[2:11:43] you be established believe his prophets
[2:11:45] and so shall you prosper right but here
[2:11:48] amen paul is actually telling him to say
[2:11:50] believe on the lord jesus christ when
[2:11:51] we're trying to introduce people to this
[2:11:53] message
[2:11:54] always give them to jesus first
[2:11:59] don't try to give them too much of the
[2:12:00] message
[2:12:01] get them to jesus because i tell you
[2:12:03] what they're they'll if you give them
[2:12:05] enough jesus
[2:12:07] they'll get more thirsty
[2:12:09] and they want to know i mean i heard
[2:12:10] other people talk about jesus but you
[2:12:12] saying something a little different
[2:12:13] about them
[2:12:15] hallelujah then you can introduce them
[2:12:17] to a prophet that expressed this jesus
[2:12:19] to us
[2:12:23] believe
[2:12:25] on the lord jesus christ
[2:12:28] and thou shalt be saved and look at this
[2:12:31] and thy house here's another nugget
[2:12:34] brother branham tells us he says
[2:12:37] the same faith
[2:12:39] that you apply to your own salvation and
[2:12:42] you know what
[2:12:44] ain't when you saved
[2:12:46] ain't nobody can tell you you're not
[2:12:48] saved
[2:12:51] amen i don't care what anybody say well
[2:12:53] i saw you no you didn't see me doing
[2:12:54] nothing no you didn't uh-uh i'm saved
[2:12:58] i don't do that well i thought maybe
[2:13:00] that maybe somebody looked like you
[2:13:02] maybe it was but it wasn't me
[2:13:07] you don't care what they say i'm saved
[2:13:09] i'm saved and here's the thing when you
[2:13:10] got confidence in your own salvation
[2:13:14] no matter what your children doing
[2:13:16] no matter what your husband doing no
[2:13:18] matter what your wife doing no matter
[2:13:21] what any your brother don't know that
[2:13:24] you and your house should be safe so the
[2:13:26] same thing that you apply to yourself
[2:13:29] apply that to your family
[2:13:33] [Applause]
[2:13:35] hey
[2:13:36] god is loosing prisoners
[2:13:39] right now
[2:13:42] you might go home and find somebody
[2:13:44] loose
[2:13:48] [Applause]
[2:13:54] one brother came to church one time and
[2:13:56] and and he was just had a burden for his
[2:13:58] family while he was in church he had a
[2:14:00] burden for his family and and brother
[2:14:01] branham standing there preaching
[2:14:04] looked up and said brother dalton i give
[2:14:06] you your children in the name of the
[2:14:07] lord jesus christ
[2:14:09] say what
[2:14:10] yeah the prophecy i give you your
[2:14:12] children in the name of the lord jesus
[2:14:14] christ it's going to be a performance of
[2:14:16] those things
[2:14:17] brother dawson just began to worship and
[2:14:19] praise god when he got home his kids was
[2:14:21] waiting for him
[2:14:23] daddy daddy i want to be saved at it i
[2:14:26] want to get saved daddy what what must i
[2:14:28] do to get saved at it i mean he saw
[2:14:30] immediate change in his children just
[2:14:33] like that
[2:14:35] y'all better start thinking off for the
[2:14:37] little things
[2:14:38] [Applause]
[2:14:42] my wife was telling me just a little
[2:14:44] thing
[2:14:45] so she was just went to the car my
[2:14:47] daughter and just to put my grandson in
[2:14:49] the car my daughter turned on the car
[2:14:51] you know get the ac running and my wife
[2:14:53] noticed some music playing in the
[2:14:54] background
[2:14:56] christian music
[2:14:58] i say hey i'ma start praising god for
[2:15:00] that
[2:15:01] because sometimes you have the right
[2:15:02] song at the right time
[2:15:04] it'll change atmospheres
[2:15:08] you'll feel a shift taking place
[2:15:10] i said i'ma praise god just for that
[2:15:15] i said my grandson listening to
[2:15:18] uh good gospel songs my daughter
[2:15:20] listening to the good gospel hey just
[2:15:22] keep that atmosphere god can do
[2:15:24] something in the right atmosphere
[2:15:27] the same faith i believe for myself and
[2:15:30] being saved i'm applauded to my family
[2:15:32] look at this
[2:15:33] believe on the lord jesus christ and
[2:15:36] thou shalt
[2:15:38] be saved and thy house
[2:15:41] and they speak unto him the word of the
[2:15:43] lord
[2:15:44] and the all that were in his house and
[2:15:47] he took them the same hour of the night
[2:15:49] and washed the stripes
[2:15:52] and was baptized he and all his
[2:15:54] straightway now this man went from
[2:15:57] almost killing himself
[2:15:59] to getting eternal life
[2:16:01] and this is this is the beautiful part
[2:16:03] because you know they they would have
[2:16:04] told them exactly what it's told in acts
[2:16:06] 2. if you want if you want to get closer
[2:16:09] to christ repent
[2:16:11] be baptized in the name of lord jesus
[2:16:13] christ you shall receive the gift of the
[2:16:15] holy ghost and here's the good thing
[2:16:16] about it the promise
[2:16:19] is unto you
[2:16:21] and to your children
[2:16:22] those that are far off
[2:16:24] as many as the lord our god shall call
[2:16:28] what a promise
[2:16:32] verse 34 says this and when he had
[2:16:34] brought them into his house he said meet
[2:16:36] before them
[2:16:39] and rejoice
[2:16:42] believing in god with all his house
[2:16:44] now what was that rejoice that you think
[2:16:46] he did
[2:16:48] that was that loud praise
[2:16:51] coming out of his mouth
[2:16:53] now i mean you should be in the prison
[2:16:55] watching the prisoners
[2:16:57] but you know what i i'm just i just i
[2:16:59] just i just believe god did it in such a
[2:17:01] way that not only that prison got shook
[2:17:03] i think that whole city got shot
[2:17:05] because as a soldier you know if you if
[2:17:07] you lose a prisoner like that you know
[2:17:09] you lose your life that's why he was
[2:17:10] given to take his life but i believe
[2:17:11] that whole city probably got shook and
