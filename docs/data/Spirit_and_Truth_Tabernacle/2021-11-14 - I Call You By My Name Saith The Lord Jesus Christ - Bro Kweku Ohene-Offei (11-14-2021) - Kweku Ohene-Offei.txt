be the name of the lord amen our lord is good so we want to speak this morning on the name of jesus amen i call you by my name says the lord jesus christ and it's coming from a theme that lord gave it to me when i went to africa i know you by your name amen your name and his name is one name the name of the lord jesus christ amen the name of brother solomon is his name sister naomi is mr mrs johnson if i'm right amen so we have the same name before the foundation of the world we had only one name on earth we've got different names it's also part of our earthly manifestation but the true name that we have is the name of the lord jesus christ amen that name is that is common to all of us we are here because of that name we are not here because we are we belong to a certain society we are not here because we live in the same neighborhood maybe we might live in the same place but we are here because of the name of the lord jesus christ glory be to the lord let's um thank you musician the lord bless you you are our cherubims you bring the inspiration to us so let's let's give them a a a clap let's if you can be on our feet and pick our bibles and do some reading of the word of the lord let's read from let's first read from colossians chapter 3 verse 17. the book of colossians chapter 3 verse 17 is a very simple one scripture it says and whatsoever you did you do in word or indeed do all in the name of the lord jesus christ giving thanks to god and the father by him amen whatsoever you do in word or indeed do all in the name of the lord giving thanks to the father to god and the father by him amen we shall take our seat as we read other scriptures glory be to the lord let's go to um if we can let's go to let's go to our efficiency ephesians chapter 3 and we will try to read verse 11 to 19 ephesians 3 11 to 19. glory to the lord according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him wherefore i desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you which is your glory 14 for this course i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ of whom the whole family in heaven and in an earth is named of whom the whole family in heaven and in earth is named amen there's one name that pertained to earth first we said that there's one name that pertained to us that is a common name jesus christ that is on the earthly dimension but then we go we go to the celestial dimension it's one name that is the name of the lord jesus christ that pertain to the theophanies on the other side amen adapted into the angels that is the name of the lord jesus christ verse 16 said that he will grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that christ may dwell dwell in your hearts by faith that he being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all sins what is their breath and length and death and height and to know the love of christ which passes knowledge that he may be filled with all the fullness of god amen our whole journey on earth here before the foundation of the world we were in christ and we are in christ and we forever and eternally be in christ before the foundation of the world we were in place that we didn't know about length and breadth and depth and height what is the length and breadth and depth and height that is the measurement that we go through in the sixth i mentioned there's nothing like birthday 20 years old there's not like 50th anniversary it doesn't exist there's nothing like i'm 100 years old you're always a tenner a man you don't grow old you don't grow young you are who you are amen but then we have to drop that glory and come here and measure height and breath and length and so on and so forth to measure death because in the celestial world death does not exist it's not a phenomenon you can find in heaven amen and it's right here but here we have death in the celestial world there's nothing like sickness there's not like grief and sorrow and crying it does not exist in the celestial dimension so we have to leave that glory behind and then come here and measure sickness height pains sorrow goodness life joy peace and so on and so forth amen because we wanted to learn all those attributes were in us as eternal attribute but we wanted to manifest them here in earth glory be to the lord jesus christ blessed be the name let's go to another scripture i want to see and try and do all the scripture reading before i start let's go to isaiah chapter 45 verse 1 to 7 isaiah 45 1-7 he said but now that says the lord god that created thee oh jacob and he that formed thee o israel so his name was jacob and his name was chained to israel amen it's a fear not for i have redeemed thee i have called thee by thy name thou art mine and thy name is jesus jehovah verse two said when thou passes through the waters i will be with you and through the rivers they shall not overcome thee when thou walkers through the fire thou shall not be burned neither shall neither shall the flame kindle upon thee what is the water jacob mother pass through waters but waters are you passing through the waters are not waters are people and people carry spirits amen sometimes when you go to the woods areas by yourself you don't encounter spirits but you go to the city center you go to down downtown or your workplace then you begin to encounter spirits amen demons because people trees don't carry spirits no microphone doesn't carry spirits the sun doesn't carry spirits they are the way the lord created them amen but human beings carry spirits and when you enter encounter human beings you either encounter the spirit of the lord or the spirit of the of the devil amen so when you encounter you go through that you pass through the waters when you pass through the midst of people whatever you do your home your marriage your children your job your schooling whatever and the spirit that you encounter or even in yourself the lord said that he will you pass through those rivers and you come back on harm he's not going to drown you in other words the trials and afflictions of life if the lord has changed your name from jacob to israel then you are an overcomer amen if the lord has changed your name from kwaku to jesus christ then you have overcome amen your greatest my greatest enemy is not the person you want to shoot at me is myself so if the holy ghost overcomes me and i don't have any enemy i don't have any trouble whatever i pass through the demos the holy ghost is the one who overcomes amen that's why you should be named after the name of the lord jesus christ that is the only name that can help you to overcome your trials and tribulation without the name of the lord your name will not overcome nothing amen do not trump name couldn't overcome amen he wanted the second term but he couldn't amen was the name putin's name couldn't overcome nothing no name on earth can overcome nothing uh hitler's name couldn't overcome he was overcome amen by the name of jesus christ stands tall and to supreme it overcomes every condition every situation every life form every demon every catastrophe the name of jesus christ can overcome it for you amen that's why you have to get this name personally in your life by revelation of jesus christ personally to you amen by the holy ghost baptism baptism in the name of water is not enough it is a sign that the lord is doing something in your life or the lord has done something in your life but you have to be born by the holy spirit the name of the lord jesus christ has to be inscribed upon the tables of your heart and transform you and kill the old person and destroy the new name so that they destroy the old name so that the new name jesus christ will be born in your heart amen god bless you so let's go ahead and read i think we go to we go to chapter verse 2 isaiah 45 verse 2 let's read verse 3 for i am the lord thy god the holy one of israel thy savior i give i give egypt for for thy ransom ethiopia and siba for thee since that was precious in my sight thou has been honorable and i have loved thee therefore i will give men for thee and people for their life fear not for i am with you i will bring thy seed from the east and gather thee from the west i will say to the north give up and to the south keep not back bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the ends of the of the earth even everyone that is called by my name for i have created him for my glory i form him yea i have made him amen your papa and your mama didn't make you the lord jesus christ made you your dad and your mom were the instrument through which you came to this earth the lord chose them but they didn't make you the one who made you is the lord jesus christ he formed you he put your substance in his book of life amen and that is what the lord sees he doesn't see the negative here but it sees your life that was wrote on the lamps written on the lamb's book of life the name of the lord jesus christ that is the name that he sees amen glory hallelujah to the lord let's go to one more scripture micah chapter 6 verse 4. i want to try as much as possible to do the bible reading then we go to what the lord has for us amen in the old old testament they used to read a scroll and they just close this and just bless the name of the lord for the reading of the lord is a blessing just in reading the word of the lord so mike 6 the book of micah chapter 6 verse 4 for i brought thee out of the land of egypt and redeemed thee out of the house of of servants and i sent before thee moses aaron and miriam amen the lord was talking to israel that he brought them out of egypt that was the natural egypt and redeemed them from being being oppressed and he sent leaders who are the leaders moses who is moses moses was god himself because god said that whenever you see a prophet you see the lord jesus christ amen and when the lord called moses he said i've made you what god unto the people and i've made your brother aaron and who's aaron the prophet and who is miriam she's the prophet as the church amen so those were the three leaders the lord sent to israel the church the prophet and god almighty so moses aaron and miriam is a type of christ the prophet and a church amen remember what miriam did when the victory was one the people cross over miriam took what tambourine and she began to praise the name of the lord leading the women amen so that women have got leadership in them too amen it's not that it's not a puppet that makes you a leader it's what the lord has put in you it's what the lord has inscribed in you that brings the leadership of the holy ghost in your life amen so don't worry about the pulpit amen but worry about christ the puppet on your heart your prayer amen your your your dedication to the lord your consecration unto the word of the lord that has the leadership of christ that manifests the leadership of the holy ghost in your life amen it's not a pulpit that preaches it's not it's not a computer that preaches but it's the christ in brother brother but uh smiley amen christ in brother but a troy christian brother solomon christ in my brothers and sisters amen that is the leadership so the lord has brought thee out of egypt and he has redeemed you so that you can understand the height the breath and the length amen glory let's take another reading uh revelation chapter 3 verse 11 and 12. revelation 3 11 and 12 and we trust the lord will speak to us the lord blessed by the jack for last week between here and there the lord will say something amen between here and there the lord will meet you at your condition between here and there you meet the name of jesus christ between your breath and your death the name of the lord jesus christ we review to you amen between here and there the lord will will meet you there amen meet you here i'll meet you there glory hallelujah amen glory hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord so revelation 3 11 and 12 revelation 3 11 and 12. behold i come quickly hold fast hold that fast which thou hast that no man take thy crown him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out and i will write upon him i write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god which is new jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my god and i will write upon him my new name glory hallelujah to the lord the lord will write his name upon you blessed be the name of the lord amen so let's see what is the name i think at the last time i preached we define a name a name is an attribute a name is identification a name is actually a nature amen that's why jesus christ changed certain people's name in the bible he changed a soul's name to what to paul he changed uh it wasn't in peter before he was called peter it was called simon barjona bajona means son of jonah just like taking your your father's family name so salmon by jonah was changed what peter the rock peter the revelation because the lord was going to do something in his life peter was going to receive a new name a new nature that would turn him from being the old fisherman who used to kiss to be a fisher of men a man who's still funny when it's passing through the street even in shadow we heal the sick people amen glory hallelujah when you receive a new name the supernatural automatically follows your life it's just part of your life amen when you receive jesus christ you don't have to work it out you don't have to fake it you don't have to feign it it's just your natural self and that is who you are amen you are a name and the name is what jesus christ you are a nature of the living christ and that nature is supernatural that nature has got creative power in him that nature can bring things into existence and create things remove things out of existence amen that nature can speak cancer out of existence and that nature can bring healing into existence glory hallelujah what do you need this morning whatever you need it's in you already amen whatever you need at this hour that is new already and your faith brings it out amen the waters of life brings it out the word of god brings it out amen there's nothing that you need that is outside you so brother i don't have money the money is outside me it's in you already your faith has to bring if you want million or billion your faith will bring credit money into crea into existence amen in israel prophet i've got two principal features prophet of create can create things into existence and can speak things out of existence amen and so the same spirit of christ is in you and you can speak things into creation you can split the positives into creation and speak the negative out of your life glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be the name of the lord so let's see where did i get to okay isaiah 45 i think we've done read that one already so the lord is calling his children from the north from the south from the east nothing can hold a child of god the lord can let you go through certain things to lend a contrast to lend a breath of sin if you want to sin you can go to the deepest of hell you can do whatever you want to do you can smoke till cancer will take over your lungs and on your death bed if the lord called you by the name jesus christ death will not take you until he transformed your life amen there was a man i think in the days of the prophet but abraham he was a smoker and nobody wanted to baptize him for some reason this one was a smoker but he wanted to be baptized in the in the name of the lord jesus christ and all the preachers they were holier than now so nobody baptized this man he was moving from preacher to preacher nobody would like to baptize he said go quit smoking i'm not going to baptize you so he came to what abraham said but abraham nobody want to baptize me i i want to be baptized in the name of the lord but i smoke and ram said what has smoking got to do with baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ get get the person that is drowning from the water before you take the water out of his lungs but if you try to take the water once it's under embedded in water more water is going to be there so we just get him out of the water the rest will be taken care of amen so [Applause] so but abraham arranged to baptize him and he baptized him once he was a smoker and after he was baptized he was still smoking anyways i think his son-in-law i think if i'm right but brother who's uh father-in-law so he was sick at the hospital and he couldn't do what he smoking so he said but i would to go buy him cigarette and he met with the brahms and always how how are things that i'm going to buy cigarette for papa i think his name is papa you know he can't do with smoking it's okay take i think he gave him ten dollars or something tick and go buy himself a ram you don't made it you are kidding he said no i'm not gonna put the money in your pocket and take this money and go buy him his cigarette because when i was surprised he thought he was yes no you i'm not kidding so he gave it to him he went to buy a cigarette for him he went back to the hospital and said how come you came you came so early he said i met brother bill on the street and he gave him money to buy you your cigarettes and the man didn't smoke anymore he just didn't smoke anymore so let the lord have his way amen the lord knows how to work it better than you and i let the pillow fire have his way in the people amen he can do it better than what you can do if you try to do it you're going to create a caricature you're going to create a hypocrite you're going to create an actor you act perfectly like a saint but when he's away from you is there is the devil in chief amen but when the lord does said when the lord transformed the heart the lord has done it amen it's done and it's forever amen don't even try to do it to yourself but just commit it to him and he'll take care of every situation whatever you have in your life whatever you want to overcome whatever spirit you want to overcome the overcomer is in you and is that jesus christ in your heart and let him take control and everything will be situated glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be the name of the lord amen one time there was a man called we know him simon barjona would you know him as peter amen even when the lord called him jesus christ gave him power gave him authority to cast him on but he wasn't so converted his name had been changed from salmon by jonah to peter the rock the revelation he had a revelation but by jack said he has to have the faith you may have a faith to do healing you may have faith to do miracles but you have to have the faith what is the faith that is christ in you amen peter wasn't there yet the day of pentecost hasn't come yet so peter was still peter he was so uh someone by jonah but one day the lord changed him when the day of pentecost came and peter was born again the old person died out and another person christ jesus took over him amen and let's see what the lord some few things the lord did in his life this is the man who denied the lord how many times three times but at the day of pentecost peter was the one who declared that the lord has opened a new day a brand new day amen the pr the prophecies of the prophets were being fulfilled the prophecy of moses joel asia adam and all the prophets they were being fulfilled in jesus christ and peter was a prophet of that day because the word of the lord comes to the prophet amen let's read a little message from what is attraction on the mountain 65-0725 e 65-0725e paragraph 87 another attraction on a mount was the day of pentacles when all of them was up there in a religious feast thought they had got rid of other fanatics they hadn't heard from them for 10 days all of a sudden like a beehive they broke out of the of the top of the building out into the streets screaming and carrying on 88. so what is this what minute this all of these are men drunk all all are all these men drunk 1889 watch and a prophet stood among them as the order of a prophet should be and said ye men of israel and you that dwell in judea in jerusalem let this be known unto you and he came to my weights these are not drunk like you think they are but this is that which was spoken of of the lord through joel the prophet it shall come to pass in the last days i'll pour i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh that was the attraction amen now peter when peter received the name of the lord jesus christ he wasn't the same old peter anymore he has been transformed amen heaven was living in him all the power of jesus christ was now laying peter amen and as a prophet he declared what the old prophet wrote about that what was going on is not being drunk it wasn't alcohol but it's jesus christ of nazareth who is revealing himself in the form of another ministry called the holy spirit ministry amen glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be the name of the lord now let's go to um i think we read from first kings chapter 2. and that's one of the scriptures i will stand on this morning first kings chapter two we want to look at the three pools of elisha and you find it compared to the three pools that you and i go through first kings chapter two let's read from verse one it says and it came to pass when the lord would take up elijah into heaven by a whirlwind that elijah went with elijah from gilgal gilgal and let's look at the meaning of girga let's see let's finish reading so take note of that verse two and elijah said unto elijah terry here in other words root for me here i pray thee for the lord has sent me to bethel so take cognizance of battle as well we look at the meaning of bethel and elisha said unto him as the lord leaveth and as i so liveth i will not leave thee so they went down to bethel verse 3 and the sons of the prophet that were at bethel came forth to elijah and said unto him knowest doubt that the lord would take away thy master from the head today and he said ye i know i know it hold thy peace verse 4 and elijah said unto him elisha tarry here i pray thee for the lord has sent me to jericho and we find the meaning of jericho and he said as the lord leaveth and as thy soul leaveth i'll not leave thee so they came to jericho and the sons of the prophet that where a jericho came to elisha and said unto him notice that that the lord knoweth thou that the lord will take away thy master from thy head today and he said yea i know it hold your peace you know the sounds of the prophet the trotters of life they will divide you from your route what are some of the distractions in your life things that distract you from the life the lord has laid before you you have to know what distracted from the from the path of righteousness and tell them to hold their peace amen let him just let him just chip in jesus one time preach and after preaching was going somewhere and the devil created a storm you know the devil can can use the nature he cannot create but he can also has god power he's been giving power over nature just like you a son of god has got power over nature so the devil created a storm on the on the sea on the river and he wanted to drown the son of god but the devil didn't know who he was playing he was playing with he could play with peter and and john and and martha because they were not baptized with the holy ghost yet they didn't have the name of jesus christ yet though they were cussing demons in the name but the name was not inscribed on their heart so he could scare them to death but when the master of circumstances rose up he told the storm peace be still and the storm obeyed him amen and you've got the same power in you as a daughter of god as a son of god that whatever storms whatever destruction sickness whatever it might be sin unbelief you've got the same authority from heaven from the almighty to speak to the situation and the situation will obey you amen glory hallelujah to the lord let's keep reading and let's see uh we go to verse verse five and the sons of the prophet okay we got verse six and elijah said unto him tarry here i pray thee for the lord has sent me to jordan and he said as as the lord leaveth and as i so leave it i will not leave thee and the two went on and 50 men of the sons of the prophet now 50 and stood far off and they two stood by jordan and elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smoothed their waters and they were divided heather and thither so that the two went over on dry ground elijah was training elijah how to use the supernatural how to use the word to divide situation amen verse nine and it came to pass one it came to pass when they were gone over that elijah said unto elisha ask what i shall do for thee before i be taken away from thee and elisha said i pray thee let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me and he went from thence to mount camel oh sorry verse 10 and he said thou has asked a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when i when i'm taking from thee it shall come to pass it shall it shall be unto you but if not it shall not be verse 11 and it came to pass as they still went on and talked that behold there appeared a child of fire and horses of fire and parted them both asanda and elijah went up by whirlwind into heaven and elisha saw it and he cried my father my father the chariot of israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and ran them into two pieces and he took up also the mantle of elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of jordan now what does he mean when elijah took his rope and ran him into two pieces denying himself amen you can ascribe to christ and ascribe to the the the cosmos world you can't ascribe to christ and ascribe to jesus christ to the devil amen you you either go with satan and his kingdom or you go with christ and his kingdom and if you want to go with christ and his kingdom then you should be ready to deny yourself to do what elisha was a type of a wife of a bride of christ did in order to marry to the son of man in order to get a double portion he has to let his own name go he has to let his fame go he has to take off his own robe because his robe was all tattered rope it that he didn't have any power he didn't have the supernatural but the robe of elijah which is the rook of jesus christ had a supernatural in it amen so elijah rip his own cloth and put on elijah's mantle which is a type of the word of the lord deny yourself and take all the word of the lord into your heart and to bring situations that you want in your life amen glory hallelujah to the lord and if you read on if you read on elijah began to do miracles he used the same clothes when he was coming back remember jordan was waiting for him he got to jordan what did he do he took on elijah elijah's mantle on him and hid the waters and the waters opened for him the same word that did for jesus christ jesus of nazareth that calmed the storm yours might not be yours might not be a natural storm yours might be a storm of life trials sickness persecution family children husband wife whatever you are going through you've got the same power you've got the same authority to speak to hit the waters and the waters will obey you amen because the elements of earth are subject unto their creator the waters the earth the fire and the air all the four elements the principal element that control the earth is subject unto the son of god and so if the son of god is in you you are become the son of god amen you have become the lord jesus christ in manifestation and when you speak your word is as good as the lord jesus christ speaking glory to the lord you know there's a time for everything there's a time to follow and it's a time to lead and we do all of them in different situations amen there's a time you all you have to do is to follow and there's a time the lord will bring you from the ray to lead amen and it doesn't let you go by yourself he's in you during the leadership there's a song we sing we all sing it i have decided to follow jesus i have decided to follow jesus i have decided to follow jesus no turning back no turning back the cross before me in the world behind me the cross before me in the world behind me the cross before me in the world behind me no turning back no turning back so if you are following jesus christ what are you following him for that's my question do you just want to follow jesus christ and follow him all your life and just follow him and follow him and follow him nothing happening to you no communication with him who want to marry a husband and after your gorgeous wedding the husband said he doesn't talk to you you don't talk to him and sit in one corner of the house and he sit on another corner of the house and stay at each other go to work and come back and you don't even greet you just come and go to his room and you go to your room is it a relationship is it a marriage the natural types are spiritual the lord doesn't want a relationship that we don't talk to each other he wants to talk to you and he wants you to talk to him amen he wants you to be him amen that's why when you marry uh you marry a woman you put you give your name to the woman because your life is for the woman you are living for for her and the lord is living for who for you and that's why he's put his name in your heart amen and so you follow it's good to follow but there's a time you have to what get what you are following for you don't just follow jesus christ and follow and follow and follow you have to receive what you are following elijah has a motive and a reason for following elijah glory hallelujah who called elijah to begin with you don't have time to go to the scriptures but elijah called elisha when elijah elijah was a farmer with his people they were plowing and he was playing on the 12th uh horse what is the horse car or whatever you call it bullock behold elijah appeared and he said follow me and elijah follow him and elijah had a purpose for calling elisha because elijah knew he was he was going to be taken away by a whirlwind to the sixth dimension and there should be a prophet on the land to help the people to lead the people and elijah elijah was the one ordained but then elijah elijah has to go through training he has to forsake his air his career and then follow elijah and learn the things about elijah learned how elijah conducted himself he saw one thing about elijah with this mantle that this mantle could do supernatural just like the road of moses amen the lord can take anything in your life things that are not regarded things that are of no substance and the lord can use it mighty to overcome things amen the lord didn't use ak-47 he didn't use a a nuclear weapon but he used a little slingshot catapult in the hand of what david to kill goliath amen the lord doesn't need a big faith just your little faith that you have in him if you nurture that fit with love with confidence that fit can overcome everything glory hallelujah so elijah was following elijah sorry elisha was following elijah to get a double portion of what elijah's anointing so elijah said the lord has called me i need to go to bethel so wait for me he said no i'm not going to tell you i'm going to go with you and that's pretty simple it was upon ruth when a naomi who was a prophetess and ruth the young the new church the young prophetess ruth said naomi said i'm going to you know where i am now there's nothing i can do for you my son is dead my husband is dead so go back home and look for another husband and say no i am going with you wherever you go i'll go with you your people will be my people where you die i'm going to die your what your food will be my food your god will be my god amen and a ruth had what she was looking for she wasn't just following an army but she was fooling army for a purpose for the lord of naomi amen so elijah elisha was following elijah for a divine purpose to get a double portion and let's look at the meaning of those cds let's see what they mean blessed be the name of the lord gilgal means circle of stones rolling away whirlwind chaff and stubble gilgam means stone where you circle where you make your decision thought that good through your mind you have to make a decision that's the beginning of the journey and bethel means house of l l means elohim christ house of god so when you make your decision where do you go you go to the house of god to receive the word the bread of life then jericho means fragrance city of palm trees but it's the lowest part of jordan jericho is the lowest part of israel when you go so low close to jordan you hit jericho so before you start the gen you get what you want you have to go solo you have to bow your knees to the lord you have to deny yourself so that the lord he will lift you up the bible said humble yourself when you humble yourself you'll be lifted but when you lift up yourself you're going to be abused amen so you start with humility you have to go to the lowest part and deny yourself and give your heart to the lord jesus christ and when you do that the lord will lift you up and give you double portion and jodha means descending flowing down freedom that comes after a long season of adversity or waiting watering place garden of god source of fertility amen when you deny yourself and you go to the house of the lord and you humble yourself the lord will give you the double portion and let's see how it applied to elijah and you see how it applies to our lives when elisha had a double portion had the mantle of elijah when he was coming back now after getting the fragrance getting the word you have to manifest the christ in you after following elijah and getting the mantle of elijah now you have to manifest you have to descend to the people amen to your family you have to apply the token upon your children you have to apply to your church you have to apply to your family you have to apply it to your neighbors you have to apply to whatever you can apply to even to your doctor and your cats amen if your dog is sick yes if your your dog needs divine healing the dog can get the vihealing if your cat in divinely the cat can get it if your children need divine healing it's for you if you need it it's for you so whatever you have let the word descend from your heart and be a manifestation don't keep the faith and store it here but let it be a blessing to people glory hallelujah to the lord just like elijah when he received the anointing of elijah he went back he tried it on jordan he said let if the god of elijah is alive then let this water apart and the water part and he walked through the on plain ground just as he saw elijah doing amen and whatever you read in the scriptures the promises and the blessings of the lord is not only for the people of oh no it's not only for william abraham it's for you it's for us those blessings are yours amen and just let your faith go into display why do we have certain difficulties in your life why does the lord allow adversities in our lives is it because he doesn't love you no because he loves you and he's put those powers in your heart and they want those powers to be manifest manifested a man just like a man and his wife the other if the man has trained his wife there are certain times when the children do something but the man doesn't talk the wife can discipline the kiss just like as the man would like to do amen christ has put his life in us he has put the word of god in us he's actually living in us and when there's any problem just name it the holy ghost in you should go into play should go into action to fix the problem amen so the lord the lord allows adversities in our lives so that the power of god will be made known in action in real time amen the lord is not a god of history he did something in the past but he's not living in history he's now in the present tense he's a god of what reality is the same yesterday today and forever according to hebrews 13 8. so whenever situation arises the same holy ghost that feels a certain similar situation or same in the past the same christ can do for you amen so there's a time to follow and there's a time to lead and i think we as a body of christ we becoming too much of a followers instead of a time that we should the lord is expecting to especially to see fruits in our life we are still crying as babies and all that we want to do is follow and follow and be carried on the shoulders of the lord but it's a time that the following kids can follow amen but the body of christ has come to a point where we can lead by the holy spirit glory hallelujah amen there was a time peter couldn't cast him on a certain lady brought a child that had leprosy had a epilepsy and peter and the apostles couldn't do they couldn't help it they chanted they couldn't do it and jesus taught them that this thing should be done by heart by prayer and fasten when you fast and the body comes under the holy spirit the lord can do much better and he was teaching them now the same peter when the holy ghost was full of the holy ghost it wasn't peter even trying to heal people will lay up sick people on the streets per adventure the shadow of peter can fall upon the people in the world they will rise amen we have to go to a point people want to just touch you just like i'm touching my brother i know the anointing of the lord is on him touching him i'll be blessed amen there should be a time in your life and it is now amen that people can see christ in you they can look at you directly and see that jesus christ is in your heart amen people can see and just that attraction of the holy ghost in you and they could see that sister naomi has got christ in here amen they could see sister rebecca has got christ in here they could see uh sister jeremy has got christ in here and without even asking you they can tap the anointing they can tap into your anointing amen when you prayed up when you let the mantle of elijah rest on you what is the mantle of elijah it wasn't elijah as a human being no it was what the holy spirit the people of fire in elijah glory hallelujah and when you let the pillar fight a simple fire in your life and you let him take over your life and display you see miracles miracles become everyday life it's not once in a while amen the lord will want to speak to us the lord wants to commune with you just like a husband and a wife want to commune with each other and so we have to avail ourselves to the lord for communication amen how do we come what are some of the ways to come in with the lord prayer reading the word singing consecrating yourself fasting amen and taking other other people's burden and pray for them prayer journal write things in your journal and pray about amen and believe that is done not only your problem there should be a time that your problem is even put it behind because you know your problem is fixed already you don't have to worry about your problem because when you let give example i have this handkerchief here right i give it to brother joseph can wash but i give it to my brother to watch it for me and the brother said oh my hands are dirty i'm looking for soap and water to wash my hands so i'm not going to wash your handkee for you because my hands are dirty but then if you accept to watch my handkerchief i'm going to give him water and soap and as he's watching is my handkerchief his sons have been what are being watched when you attend to the things of the lord the lord takes takes care of your problem without even asking because you are the masterpiece is using when you pray for others the lord fixes your problem without much prayer for your own needs amen it's like the person on the front of the captain in front of the battle he's being guarded people i mean bodyguards him president right president of god security details because he's the president the job that he does he's got thousands maybe hundreds of security details if the president job i don't want to come to west palm people will come here earlier two three days a week to come and look at the grounds to come and spy to see maybe somebody want to shoot him somebody want to do this and then before he arrives there will be security details fully armed if you mess up they will shoot you to death because of his office amen and the lord has given you greater than joe biden is here you are greater than joe biden you are greater than kamara harris the lord has given you an office it's not a political office that after four years you have to run again after eight years your end is your time is up this attempt doesn't end the lord himself gave you that time that you are the ambassador the president of earth amen not just united states you can fix situations in other places amen you can stand here in the united states and pray and things will happen in south america things will happen in africa things will happen in europe without stepping to europe amen that is the power you have amen that is when you accept the leadership of the holy ghost in your heart glory hallelujah to the lord there's a time to follow and there's a time to lead between here and there something has to happen amen there was a time elijah all elijah has elijah's to follow elijah wherever he goes he follows and elijah was taken away from him the pillar of fire what is the pill of fire not a physical fire it's the celestial dimensions his angels theophanies he was just caught up in that dimension broke his earthly body and there was no prophet on the land but always always in need of of the ministry amen we need a fifo ministry the pastor evangelist teaches a prophet and and what what else apostles we need a knife for gifts amen tongues interpretation of tongues healing words of wisdom and all the gift of god dissement amen we need it in the church and it's in the people amen who is the pill of fire the pill of fire is you one time joshua was fighting the lost battle and he saw a man with a sword and he said who is this man because joshua was commissioned by the lord almighty there was a time he had to follow moses but then there was a time joshua has to take the leadership the lord himself commissioned joshua and he saw a man and he said who are you are you for so are you against us and said joshua i am the captain of the lord of hosts who is the captain of israel it was joshua and with this man said that i am the captain of israel it was joshua joshua talking to joshua with you funny talking to joshua the flesh amen and when you're in the lost battle it's not difficult it's nothing strange that the lord will let you through funny come out of you and you'll talk to your too funny amen because the supernatural is part of your life it's a regular part of your life amen so there's a time to follow and there's a time to lead and it's a time for us to what to take the leadership mantle and match on and defeat every enemy in our lives every enemy on the road just kick him out amen and that's what elisha did elijah tried the mantle of elijah if the word that you receive could heal you if the word could transform you can they transform your family can they transform your wife and your husband can it transform your children can they transform your grandchildren can you transform your brothers and sisters can they transform your job situation can it transform your marriage can it transform your financial situation it has a power to do everything amen what do you need whatever you need speak it whatever you need do it in the name of jesus christ and you see christ be manifested in your life glory hallelujah it's time for us to lead we have done is it's time that we have yes good to sing i've decided to follow jesus christ if this is the first time glory hallelujah come to the altar come and cry take the name of jesus christ with you by some of us the lord has brought us so far and the lord is looking for dividend in our lives the lord is looking for profit the lord runs a business when we run business we look for profit is that right and the lord also want a profit what is the profit he wants you to avail yourself to the leadership and the holy ghost will work through you you want the the the the business that's eternal life business the healing business transfer the blessing on to others amen if you can't receive fit for your headache how are you going to pray for somebody who have got cancer if you can hardly receive faith for a little headache that each headache you have to call by the jack you have to cover that smiley you have to cover that troy for each headache when are you going to have faith to pray for cancer amen there should be a ton of yes you might be going through a headache migraine but you should in your the healing start from here the lord put everything that you need from your heart you have to believe that yes i'm going through a headache i'm going through migraine uh all the medicine didn't help me all the pharmacy didn't help me the doctors couldn't help me but i've got faith in me amen i have jesus christ in me i have another person in me that is beyond a migraine that when i speak is not me speaking is the lord jesus christ speaking you migraine is a demon it's a spirit you migraine this is not your dwelling please your dwelling please doesn't belong to my mind this is the mind of christ you curse the migraine it doesn't matter how long but between the time that you spoke and there here and there the migraine will leave you glory hallelujah if you need to overcome situations in your life you need the holy ghost baptism maybe you prayed but you don't see the holy ghost in your life you have cried but you don't really seek god in your life you want the lord to speak to you but you don't feel the lord in your life believe from your heart that lord i didn't promise myself i didn't call myself into your kingdom you come into this kingdom you ordain me here i was in you i was you you were me and so this promise is what you made for me and so in your name i received my blessing in your name i received the holy ghost baptism in your name i receive the power to overcome every trials and temptation and i stand as a daughter of god i stand as a son of god and i'm matching victory to overcome every demon amen is a time to lead the time to follow is behind us amen is the time to take the leadership mantle like elisha did and match on and open the red sea and open a river jordan and speak and create things in life amen it's not the time to cry no more the crying time is over it was good to cry yes cry bring some relief it's good but don't cry don't be a crime baby all the time don't be a crime baby that we want god to wipe your tears all the time you know the lord is tired of wiping out our tears the lord wants us to be men and women amen the lord wants us to stand as a son of god to be like joshua say who are you and the lord has to declare his identity he said i'm you joshua i'm the captain of the host i'm you i'm the one leading the army amen because joshua knew he knew his commission joshua didn't cry compare i compared the ministry of joshua and moses moses did a lot of crying and joshua learned from me that no moses was too much like a crying baby he used to cry too much i think i don't have to pay this attribute i'll put it behind me i'm not going to be a crime baby no more i'm not going to be like moses so when joshua was on the line no joshua didn't do crying because he has learned he has followed moses and now he has able to overcome some of the problems of moses amen moses was moses was taken from from water right so crime was part of his ministry but joshua wasn't taken from a river so joshua was born on a land his commission is what to divide the land for their people and if you've got 12 tribes with men and women and you're going to divide lands for husbands and wife and children and you the leader you are crying baby when are you going to divide the land for the people you won't be able to do that job so most uh joshua learned from moses that i'm not going to be a crime baby i'm going to be a man as the lord has ordained me i pick my mantle my commission and i stand as a son of god and defeat every amalekite every jebusite every canaanite and divide the land for the people of the living god amen so as a daughter of god amen you are prophetess the same christ that was in elijah is in you the same christ in william abraham is in you the same christ in jesus is in you and when you speak heaven follows you when you speak heaven says amen when you said let it be heaven says it is already done amen so your lord is not to cry all the time wipe your tears and speak and move forward amen [Applause] as you go through jesus you're going to have battles like joshua because you want to possess the land a malachite jebusite canaanites and all the heights and kites are on the land already and they are not going to hand over the land to that this your promised land take it no it doesn't come that way you're going to do what fight you're going to what battle you're going to take sword and kill kill every enemy and you know the greater the enemy is you when you kill this enemy first all the other enemies are already taken care of glory hallelujah one time uh elisha i think on his seven gehazi yes he had an enemy the enemy was himself too emotional he jumped up all the time one time he saw a armies of a i think philistines around the master's house he quickly went to wick the master elisha master wake up we are done look at the armies of philistine all around us we are surrounded what did elijah do he didn't panic is the lord opened his eyes and when the lord opened his eyes what did he see chariot of fire of fire angels of the lord host of heaven few funnies celestial bodies all around them and then elijah sorry gehazi stop running around his spirit was calm down you need to calm yourself down don't let situation detect to you yes situation will come so fierce so wild so severe so strong that it loses beyond your human self but be like david amen when david came before goliath he didn't panic because he know that it's not him he's not that 18 year old boy during the battle but he had a pill of fire in him so he said i come before you i come to you against you you kiss me look at goliath giant tall but it was cursing david in the name of his idols he was invoking his deity and david was wise enough not to invoke david he didn't even invoke his experience he had to invoke his experience before saul to let so know that he's called what a lion and a bear as a testimony but when he became before the situation he invoked the name of the lord jesus christ jehovah and said the lord of israel whom you defile he's the one who is going to kill you for me amen and right away the pillow of fire took over the nail of the lord took over the hands of david he began to well with what his slingshot that is his faith that is your prayer that is the prophecy that is the way that you speak and when he was speaking he was charging himself the pillar of fire was just in control and the first link shot the first shot j-e-s-u-e jehovah amen faith greece killed just right street into the forehead of goliath and he fell prostrate on the floor amen whatever situation you have it might be as big as goliath it's already fully postured before you you have to believe in yourself christ in you amen the hope of expression of glory christ is in you and christ want to manifest himself in your life and you give all your heart to him don't be afraid second the lord intentionally allows great circumstances big circumstances in family finance all of a sudden the man has lost his job maybe the man is a breadwinner the wife is a housewife what do they do are you going to start being a crime baby if your husband becomes a cry baby what should the wife and the children do they should cry mourn and complain and yell but you have to know that the lord if the lord yes allow your boss to kick you out with no reason don't look at you you have a better boss you have a better seat manager ceo he's the lord jesus christ and so just go to him and speak from your heart there's a song i remember one of the old songs he said when you come bef when you come before the river i don't remember how to sing it so well said you'll be your friend and guide when you come before the jordan river remember the lord jesus christ will be your friend and guide so you don't have to you don't have to fret your heart you don't have to let your faith sink in because you've lost your job just not the lord you give me this job and if i've lost it then you have another job for me maybe you want me to be a business person start my own business amen and you walk by faith and you see the hand of the lord in your life amen don't worry about we will children worry doesn't solve problems faith and talking solve the problem so you keep on applying your faith keep on applying their talking keep on believing that they are saved keep on believing that they are changed amen because you have got a creative spirit in you and when you create in your heart what you create you might not see it physically but it's working in their hearts and in the the laws on time as brother jackson between here and there something will happen amen between here and there the pillow fire will transform them between her and there the lord will change your marriage between here and there the lord will take whatever problem temper impatience anger all those are demons and if you have it the holy ghost has got the power to take off take care for you amen some people cannot keep jab because what they are not they are not they are impatient they have temper they have certain spirits and so they can't keep good relationships they are not even happy with their own self it's the devil that puts that spread upon human beings by we're son of god you're a daughter of god temper is not my promise no anger is not my promise fighting physically is not my promise amen my promise is what the holy spirit my promise is victory my promise is patience love faith kindness forgiving forbearing one another that is my promise and your promise and so you take the mantle of elijah and you speak what is if your problem is elijah had problems with the water overflowing and elisha has to pass through your problem might not be a river jordan overflowing by your jordan might be a situation in your life that it needs to be what taken away take be done away with it could be a character that is not a cut of jesus christ it could be a nature that runs through your ancestry it could be drunkenness that you inherited from your ancestry your grandfather was drinking your dad was drinking your ankles are drinking and that's what is on you but the power of christ is in you to overcome drunkenness to overcome alcohol to overcome drugs to overcome stealing to become robbery to overcome impatience to overcome whatever demon that is troubling you because you the name of i call you by my name says the lord amen he didn't call it by your family name he called you by the name of jesus christ and the name of jesus christ has got the power to overcome every situation glory hallelujah let's read this quote for me six four zero two zero nine count down countdown 64-0209 the paragraph i'm not really sure he said now look at here on the day of pentecost the holy spirit the holy ghost separated itself and tongues of fire set upon each one tons of fires upon what each one not only on but smiley not only on sister dixon but each one of us not only on on the adults but each one their children amen not only on that and mom but what each one not only on the musician but what each one has to get a portion of the pill of fire glory hallelujah amen is that a a portion of the holy ghost suddenly upon each okay the gripple of fire separated so it's one pill of fire separated and each one received a portion of that holy spirit so now the prophet is telling the pillar of fire is what the holy spirit so if you have the holy spirit what do you have in your heart the pill of fire this is someone on his own if you have the pillow fire which burns demons what should you be afraid of why do you panic in life why do you fret your heart because of an adverse situation well if you put one if you put one tank on off if you put one tank of fire and two tanks of fire together you got what twice the strength that you had in one if i put my little lake of fire and brother solomon's lake of fire we got a double portion if we agree and touch on a situation his tongue of fire and my tangle fire can accomplish situations in our life because it's coming from what one tongue of fire the lord jesus christ so we need to what put our strength together there's strength in unity amen burying each other's burden helping each other spiritually physically whatever you can prayers and fasting take the problem on yourself don't think it's not my problem it's not my son it's not my daughter but take it it's your daughter who is sick take it to your son who's gone wayward and write in your book and say lord this is my son too it's my daughter too i'm going to stand him for for my son's daughter i'm going to standing for my brother's daughter or sister or wife or husband and i'm going to pray till i see the situation fixed i'm going to call the positive into creation we are tired of the negatives we want to see the positive and when you take the tongue of fire and a tongue of fire agree and to put situation together and pray watch what happens amen glory hallelujah yes i remember it was elijah used elijah for example innovation took two sticks and put them together a man when you put two uh one and one together you get two when you put two and two together get what four multiply the strength and becomes a rippling effect amen so when you put our gift together i i don't know i don't even know the names of the keys but sister rebecca can sit down and function here for me amen i'm not as tall as brother brother but i'm smiling so if there's something on top i can just contact a smiley he will just grab it to me and give it give it to goku take it so maybe my faith may not be like his faith but when we are working together where i'm not i can't reach he will reach and bring it out for me amen it's a body ministry a man it's just one body but different parts amen i might not be able to run as fast as maybe but you can run faster and get the object for me it's a one-body system one body working together we are not we are not different we are not divided we are one body amen we are we've got one one name what is the name jesus christ we came from one place where the sixth dimension we are here for one motive what is the motive the kingdom of god we are running one race what is the race the holy ghost baptism we are crossing through one river what is our river river jordan the rest see in us you've got the rest in you i've got the rest in me that's what we are battling against amen we are fighting the blast system amen we are fighting principalities and forces of darkness but when we put our powers together our authority together our strength together we multiply and overcome quickly rather than sitting at the corner and battling all by yourself or me sitting at the corner and battling up by myself so there's nothing wrong if i tell you my problem or you tell me your problem because a common problem anyways amen glory hallelujah to the lord the lord is a great healer he's a great emancipator he's the one who does everything for us but he needs your flesh you need your heart you need your spirits he needs your consecration he need your your sacrifice he needs you to be on your knees not just maybe you don't need a prayer but your brother and sister need prayers you don't have any situation going going on it doesn't mean everybody's at ease like you so you just cut out a prayer you know you might not even know what someone is going going through but just throw prayers around threw them in west palm beach threw them on jack's ministry threw them on brother smiley brother brother troy threw them on by the jerry threw them on the ministers amen threw them in other countries pray for the children of god in others at other places amen and when you do that you see the kingdom of god you might have your foot will never step the soils of that country by your prayers and your love and your revelation can do things at that country amen during the cover people were dying in different countries who are going through problems you might not be able to go there to go pray for them but you can pray you can pray online and the lord will do things in in the lives of those people so the lord wants us to bind together as one body of of christ and we take leadership positions because in the time of moses is that a lost son who moses aaron and miriam as leaders the sisters of god leadership too they have got a lot of gifts in them that we need in the house of the lord amen and unveiled those gifts for the working of the lord whatever the gift may be singing the sisters were singing wonderfully today glory hallelujah some do different things amen even in business you might know of a business that can help your sister why don't you tell your sister why don't you share with your sister that's israel that's why the jews prosper amen the business among themselves and as a body of christ we have to do the same thing amen bless each other amen the talent that you have help your brother maybe your sister doesn't know that business but you know you know the nitty gritties of that business you can sit in there and teach him this how to do this and do that and do that it can be stocks maybe you know how to buy stocks you can teach your brother how to how it works that when you buy this stock this is a good stock don't buy this one this is a waste of money put your money here it's going to triple in two days it's going to quadruple here and your brother will also be rich your sister will be rich amen don't be the only golden pebble on the beach you want a lot a lot of pebbles uh uh beautiful pebbles on the beach don't be the only one amen so whatever you can help your brother your sister avail it to them because he or she is christ like you glory hallelujah to the lord amen whatever your knowledge the lord has given you that knowledge whatever how to raise children maybe somebody doesn't know he's a beginner or she's a beginner but you've got experience in raising children you are grand grandma you you've got your great grandmom and you can share experience with some of the young family sisters coming up you can maybe you know how to someone doesn't even know how to change diaper you can teach them how to change diaper it's a blessing anyways amen when i was when i was in a which i think in a garden whatever i don't remember first great i didn't know how to write eight it's so easy to write it right but i didn't know how to write it so i remember my scripture taught me that just write one zero and put another zero on top say wow that's so easy that's how i started i was struggling i was all over the all over the place trying to write eight so you to you it might be easy right you can close your eyes and write it it might be easy to race case might be easy to train girls it's easy for you to train boys maybe you had all boys you know how the boys are you know but you know how the boys are very naughty you know hard-headed they don't hear but you can share your experience with some of these girl boys that this is this how it works do this do they do that so it might be something simple for you but it could be a great blessing to your brother or your sister so whatever you have share with somebody and if you don't have nothing there's one thing that you have christ and a prayer you can share prayers with your brothers and sisters if you don't have nothing at all brother i don't have nothing to share with nobody but a quick i want to share but i don't have nothing i don't have money i don't have any gifts you've got one gift pray amen and when you pray things happen glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be the name of the lord jesus christ oh my god our lord is good the lord is good amen he's in you and he's in me and he's happy when we are happy the lord is happy when he's happy he's proud of us when we are overcoming because the kingdom he's defeated when we are defeated because we are not different from him look at something when something was defeated and it looks like everything is over but samson spoke say lord i don't want even to leave but i know one thing something knew his predestination he was born to what overcome to defeat the jebusite and a malachite in the philistines say lord i don't want i want to come to come home i want to be in this dimension but give me one last victory let me overcome this kill these enemies did the lord listen to him yes the pillar fire came around his hair was growing they didn't know he had seven locks before then what were the seven logs the seven church ages but his last ministry he didn't even have time for somebody to plead his mother wasn't there to play their hair his sisters were in order to play the hair for him the hair grew as one billboard what type of what eternity eighth the eighth day the seven changes are over the last prophet of the seventies are over now jesus

jesus christ amen who do we see now i want us to go who do we see now let us make it a little louder who do we see now amen and what is jesus christ a man in us that's what we see now and if jesus
