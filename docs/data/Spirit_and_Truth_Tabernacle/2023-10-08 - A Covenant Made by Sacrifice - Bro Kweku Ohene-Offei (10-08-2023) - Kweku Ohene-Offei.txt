certainly appreciate it you can use the address at the bottom of the screen those that are in the house of the Lord we do have a box in the back if you desire to use that or you can use one of these other methods for your your giving amen uh before we pray over the offering um I wanted to just read a a scripture uh let's see here Psalms 122 Psalms 122 we'll read this amen and you don't have to stand just remain seated amen um you all have been keeping up with some of the news and I'm I'm not one that really follows too much of the news but yesterday I was being bombarded with videos and and and little messages and everything about what's happening in Israel and uh you know there was there's a tremendous attack there uh Rockets being fired everywhere and Israel is under attack and uh many of the um uh I would say some of the Arab Nations uh and and and if I can just go back all the way to Genesis these are the children of ishmail uh coming against the promised son Isaac and uh and it's always been a war always been problems amen from the day that Isaac was born has been problems and uh they uh both claim Abraham as their father and which they which they can lay claims on that right but it goes deeper than a uh a a a natural uh blood lineage it's a spiritual blood lineage amen that matters most and and and if I could and when I say spiritual I'm talking about even deeper than just Israel being the children of God uh brother brother uh um uh Simba came in close prayer last week and he says you know Lord we know Israel is your natural uh people but we are the spiritual Israel so every promise that was given to Natural Israel also is given to us as spiritual Israel blessed be the name of the Lord and we realize we have that but still natural Israel is still something that God is very concerned with and uh and and and I'll just tell you with uh you know I know that uh Netanyahu has made a comment he says y'all going to pay greatly uh for what y'all just did and uh and I believe the man and the reason I believe him because it's not just Israel fighting but God fights for Israel let me tell you another thing God fights for you yes sir Hallelujah somebody amen so so uh the one thing about it and no matter what they say on the news often times the news reporters are not looking at prophecy and when we're looking at prophecy it brings a peace and a calm because we know that there are certain things that must be done in Israel it's got to happen in Israel right uh the scripture there in Revelation uh 11 I believe it is it talks about uh the witnesses that's got to come forth right so we know that that Moses and Elijah has to come back to Israel you can't wipe Israel out you can't wipe them out if if there's a prophecy that two prophets going come up and and and and really they going to be so mad at the prophets because of the word that they speak my God the bodies be laying in the streets for three days they they think they got them finally got rid of Moses and Elijah and after three days he they come back to life again God is in control come on somebody yes sir amen whatever you going through this morning I'm here to let you know God is in [Music] control Hallelujah so just uh we we we know that there's promises that are left there to be fulfilled amen so we have peace that God's going to take care of everything we want to pray for the families that are suffering lost you know at this time uh but Israel as a nation there's still some more prophecy left for them amen so somehow some way I I don't know how but God going to be their protection and and I heard that they trying to call in all the Arab Nations they want uh everybody to come I don't care how many of them join forces you can't fight God your army is too too too small to fight God and y'all and y'all will see some miraculous things happen because God God's word cannot fail I'm telling you amen praise the Lord you know even this war with Ukraine that there was some Miracles one person had a huge Bomb by from this to that drop in the back of the yard and did not go off didn't go off big old bomb they just took pictures of it and put it on social media that's the hand of [Music] God so we going to hear some we're going to hear some Miracles come out of this and and and whether the US get involved or not they don't need the US they got [Music] God they got God we got God too let's read here out of Psalm 122 it says this I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord says our our foot our feet shall stand within thy gate oh Jerusalem Jerusalem is build it as a city that is compact together whe whether the tribes go up the tribes of the Lord unto the testimony of Israel to give thanks unto the name of the Lord for there are set Thrones of judgment the Thrones of the House of David set Thrones amen and here we have been given instruction pray for the Peace of Jerusalem listen this look at look at this they shall prosper that love thee peace be within thy walls and prosperity within thy palaces for my brethren and Compass companion sake I will now say peace be within thee we speak that over Israel this morning peace be with in thee because of the house of the Lord Our God I will seek thy good let's pray amen for Israel and what they're going through at this moment we trust the Lord to make a way for them amen in this midst of War father we come according to the word of the lord we speak peace within the land of Israel we know Lord that they are under attack and there are some families that are suffering loss some have been captured taken away from their loved ones and God we pray for their Divine protection we pray that you would watch over them we pray that you would keep them and Lord the leaders of that land have to respond to the attack so we pray that you would guide them that you would direct them Lord and father we realize that uh there's still scripture that is left to be fulfilled there in that in that land so God we know that uh your word will come to pass we know that there's nothing that can stop it but Lord there are people that are impacted that affected by uh what is going on so we pray for the people Lord Jesus we ask that you would intervene that you would be their comfort and Lord as a nation they have been a people that have suffered for a number of years so so many just have come against them just because of who they are and they don't realize uh they're coming against God they're not just coming against Israel they're coming against God because those those are your chosen people so father we uh we we we pray as the scriptures tell told us to do we pray for peace in Israel God let this war come to an end let the people return back to their homes those that are in bondage let them be set free God and Father we ask that you would move by your spirit we know and we expect God that there will be some testimonies that will come out of this situation it's always happened throughout history it's always great testimonies when you begin to fight on behalf of your people and Lord we know that you're not just fighting on behalf of natural Israel but you fight on behalf of spiritual Israel who we are and God we just pray that you bring deliverance and amen peace into our lives as well whatever the people stand in need of that you would meet each one at the point of their need father we also pray that you bless the giving at is as it's given this morning that you would God just give back to your people 100f thank you for all that you are doing in our midst we give you all the glory we we give you all the honor we give you all the praise it's in jesus' name we pray amen amen amen let's give the Lord a hand of Praise glory to God Amen well this

that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice and I'll repeat Psalm 50 verse Psalm 50:5 gather my Saints together unto me those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice the Lord add blessing to the reading of his word you may take your seed amen so let's just break H the the title a little bit covenant made by sacrifice this is where I pick this I've read his Psalms and and and probably many years the Lord showed me it just inspired my heart but I never thought I was going to preach a sermon on it right and Rec recently when Jack asked me to preach it be to bubble on my heart Covenant by sacrifice and I look at this scripture and became to I mean open up more things more things to me yes sir that God called some people who have made a covenant with the Lord amen by their own sacrifice to gather the people of the Lord right so it's going to be about a little bit about the ministry and talk about Ministry is not only 5old Ministry it's not only the prophet the apostles the teachers the Masters and and the evangelists but every son and daughter of God who have been called is a minister of the Lord being a brother or a sister you are a minister unto the Lord Jesus Christ if you can find your ministry if you can be silenced for the Lord to reveal to you what your ministry is amen Ministry is not just about preaching the gospel being behind pulpit and I mean making slide and preaching there are more people who can do presentation in the world more motivational speakers in the world than those of us here but we are talking about the business of the almighty God that spells and defines Eternal Destiny of his sons and daughters amen so now Covenant is in basic language just an agreement that you make with somebody or a contract that you make among parties among two or three people or companies or parties to fulfill something and under this Covenant it comes with certain requirement that each party has to fulfilled or a certain party has to fulfill to the other party to bring to make the Covenant keep the Covenant going amen and what is a sacrifice I think we understand sacrifice sacrifice is just something that is your right giving it to somebody to accomplish something that is to sacrifice something for you that something that pertains to you you can listen I can sacrifice my for brother Mark it's mine but out of love or out for a purpose for a need I give it to my brother so now this covenant made by sacrifice is God's men and women sacrificing thems number one their hearts their mind their gift yeah Talent right substances family amen to fulfill the purpose of God Amen so he said Gather my sins unto me those that have made Covenant with me by sacrifice yeah now the five-fold ministry we're going to look at certain sacrifices the fivefold ministry what is the purpose of this sacrifice let's go to I think the next two slides let's go to the exactly now God made this his ministers a flame of fire and the purpose of this sacrifice is to perfect the body of Christ and when I read that I thought it was funny how can imperfect people perfect other imperfect people right brother how can this be preachers as imperfect as you can think of how can they they can't even perfect themselves how are they going to perfect other people right am because you can't give what you don't have you can't give it to somebody if I have this handkerchief I can give it to brother brother Troy but if I don't have and I promise but a try I'm going to give you a handkerchief I don't have nothing to give with so this ministering is not about the ministers right but it's not about them themselves it's not about their strength and their capabilities it's not about their own Perfection but it's about somebody's Perfection through them to perfect others amen and we can go through the Bible that the great men and women the Lord used they had flaws and mistakes and Wrongs as you can imagine amen yes sir it's not about their qualification they didn't qualify to begin with but somebody who is greater than them called them and he gave them his Perfection and his qualification to do the job amen Glory Hallelujah to the Lord let's look at our Father Abraham the father of Faith Glory he's a great father of Faith he did wonderful things but he had a lot of wrongs as you can imagine exactly right he agreed with his wife right to to because of fear of death yeah to sacrifice his wife yeah so that he could live right and his wife Sarah agreed with him 100% they made that Covenant that's right and it looks like they rehear hey Sarah let we going to this is life and death but then the Lord has changed him from being 90 and and 100 to 18 and 25 so they were young and handsome and when Abraham is walking by he could see that the people the young men are looking at Sarah right and Abraham realized that no Sarah if they got to know you and my wife they're going to kill me wow so you are my sister this what we going to be and of course you are my sister because they were half sisters the same father only different mothers so we going to keep that part and let's rehearse it so Abraham said you know what stop calling me sweetheart just calling me brother Abe and I call you Sister Sarah just to make sure because you're going to end up I mean calling me sweetheart honey and they're going to know that oh he's your wife so let's rehearse it so brother brother Abe Sister Sarah and let's say Sarah came up with an idea say you know what Abram I remember H when you were young you know uh I I'm even going to tell the people that we are here we are immigrants we are here to make some money to send it to our parents we've got elderly parents back in our country wow out of the Chan so I'm going to I'm going to say that oh we want to this this weekend paycheck we're going to put it together send it to Dad and Mom they are old so we're going to make everything look fine and everything looked fine but it wasn't fine but God is gracious Abraham wasn't perfect but the Perfection of God prevented the king ABC from committing a adultery with Mrs Abraham right because God always keep his Covenant Glory Hallelujah to the Lord that's right but they were still perfect people right Abraham was father of faith right and it was when the Lord was building a covenant of of unconditional Covenant Abraham was the first Foundation that's exactly right look at the look look at this building the Four Corners Abraham was fifth on one corner right and the Bible said that without faith no one can please the Lord amen but Abraham was not perfect that's right and let's look at his Sarah his wife Sarah Sarah sacrificed his her own husband for her maid just to try to help God to fulfill a scripture wow wow look at the fla that she had but God and that's what we are having now we having the sons of ishma and Sons of Isaac fighting up to this day right because of Sarah's imperfection but even through the imperfection of Sarah the Lord brought the promised son just the same that's right Isaac came to the SE just the same amen and even the greatest promised son the Lord Jesus Christ in you and I is manifesting just the same let's look at Jacob Jacob's wives H Leah Rachel I don't remember the two two other other wives but the MS yeah now when Jacob serve his father-in-law got his wives and now they parted because they had this agreement the wife stole their father's Idols that's right brother these are women that we name our children after brother did he steal money did he steal gold but they s idols and hit them on the hores backs and and and and and what is the name Laban he realized his idols were not there so he sent his men to chase Jacob cuz there was Riff between him and Jacob strong tension and conflict and when they got to where they are say hey your D Idols you think you guys have park it with you and guess what they said they said they had it hidden somewhere they said you know we are going through our ministration and we cannot go off from get off from the the horses right so they stole idols and to lie on top of it that's right but we call them Holy Women of God great women of God they are awesome we even name our daughters after them so that they can have their character these are the people that steal idols and tell lie on top of it how perfect they were brother that that is how God allowed them to how low is stop so that the Perfection of God could manifest in their imperfection a child of God is a child of God no matter where you go you can go to the deepest of hell even hell you see heaven in your hell Glory Hallelujah to the Lord Samson Samson filled the Lord miserably he sold out his Covenant at being being a levite and what is the what is the Covenant help me out nazare thank you for the sake of his flesh for women for theila but even in the last minute when he was at the at the awful end the Lord remembered him when he prayed the lowest e is said Lord his eyes were plugged he was a joker he was made to crack jokes to entertain the Philistines that he was ordained to defeat and to kill but even in his lowest a he prayed to the Lord said Lord I don't want to leave but once more let kill his enemies his hair was gone the seven LS that was the Covenant was gone the seven Church seven Church Ages were gone The Messengers were no longer there you couldn't see the the seven Messengers from Paul to Braham but it doesn't mean God is dead right God was still alive and God moved into the igh day the E day where there were no locks there was nothing that you could see but it was just the plain intelligence of God coming into manifestation and the Lord did the the unthinkable the Bible said he killed more enemies than all the enemies that he killed in his lifetime even in your lowest end even if you can't pray with your lips if you can bubble something in your heart the father that livs in your heart still hears you amen when you think you feel the Lord you f yourself you fill the church you have committed the UN unforgivable sin yes sir you just cry onto the Lord you realize it's not fire away from you he rescue you amen Glory Hallelujah to the Lord I don't know if I'm going to be able to follow this let's go when I was when I was I was thinking I didn't I didn't want to do Powerpoints this time I I just wanted to go just the unction of the Lord and I struggled not to do PowerPoint but I ended up doing PowerPoints all right because sometime it helps to bring certain things out slows you down and then you have to prove what you say so that amen so you don't get people in confusion anyway so let's go to uh let's read one of the scripture God made his ministers a flame of fire Hebrews 1 7 and8 all right let's if you can bring my slides Hebrews 1:7 and8 and of the angels He said who make who maketh his Angel spirits and his ministers a flame of fire now this ministers with full of weaknesses the Lord made them a flame of fire a consuming fire he put something in them not their human flesh and the mistakes but something the Lord did before the foundation of the world and those gifts are not just skills that you learn is something God predestinated in you Glory Hallelujah those gifts are not something that is taught to you by your pastor by the ministers but something the Lord put in you before the foundation of the world am and because the Lord put that thing in you the Lord jealously guides and gu that gift he guides you and gu those gift until becomes manifestation so that it's for you to gather his people to bring Glory unto his name to make imperfect people perfect because he makes you perfect by his Perfection and through that he sends you to go out and made the people perfect and it comes with a lot of sacrifices but then verse 8 but unto the son he said thy Throne oh God is forever and ever a skor of righteousness is the skor of thy kingdom now the son is the one who put the flaming fire into his ministers to be able to burn and destroy the enemy just like Samson was ordained to destroy the enemies of God we are not supposed to kill people in the physical but we are supposed to kill the demon Satan who is living in the heart of people Amen to free the people from the things of the world let's go to the next slide now ministers is for Perfection of the Saints Ephesians 4:10 to13 he that descended is the same also that ascended up for far above all Heavens that he might fill all things 11 and he gave some Apostles some Prophet some evangelist some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ so we all come in the unity of faith of the faith of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man onto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ so the ministry is to perfect the body of Christ whereas they themselves are not perfect that's right where they have their own problems that's right and I'm going to enumerate some of the things that ministers go through that you might not see if you not close to them the family may know people close to them may know but you might not see but the Lord has buil them and ordained them in a way that they can put their problem aside they could be sick but they could put their sickness aside and pray for you to be healed I had I had a minister friend that he said I had a certain disease and my daughter has the same thing when my daughter comes I pray for her instantly she's healed but for my own I'll pray and cry and fast and pray and cry and fast to the Lord will do it wow because the gift is for other people and it's God his gift for you wow but because of the training he allow you to go through certain things to bring the attribute out of you so he can allow the sickness to be on you for a Time whereas you can pray for people instantly they are getting healed right there are certain times that people ask me to pray for them I didn't even pray and they tell me thank you brother for your prayers it's already done so I was going to check the text message and pray and it's already the Lord has already done for them because of the gift in you your thought before even you prayed the thought of God in your heart the flame of fire that's the situation before you even prayed I had a testimony in Texas where a brother called me said brother I have a testimony for you I said sure my wife was sick and we didn't have insurance so we couldn't go to hospital it got serious and we're wondering what we could do because if you go to the H you go to you go to see the doctor and you don't have insurance they're going to write you and send you some bills you cannot imagine yeah so my wife said that after a couple of days she was she just couldn't feel fine but she had a dream and in a dream you were praying for her and I said said if brother was praying for you praise God the Lord has heal you already he said brother that was it the sickness was gone wow but I wasn't physically pray for me I didn't even know his wife was sick but I do pray for them when I go to the W to pray because the Lord has given you a life form to help the people of God your flesh could be sitting here but the gift in you could be somewhere doing something somewhere because a portion of omnipotent is in you my sister a portion is in you my brother so your flesh could be weak but the the flaming fire in you could be working in even another continent that is the Perfection the Lord has made you regardless of your imperfection In the Flesh and if you can look out to that flaming fire the Perfection of God your flesh will succumb to the Perfection of Jesus Christ Glory to the Lord Almighty amen amen the Lord is good let's go to uh the next slide 1 Kings 1911-13 and I'm going to I'm going to hear I'll stand up on this scripture for a while how to the to the extent that the men of God sacrific for the ministry this was Elijah he was being chased by Jezebel so Elijah had to run away this is a powerful prophet of God who spoke and dotin he could speak fire into existence but then there was a time that he was his life was in the line and he has to go to the cave to run away for his life and he got to extend that he said Lord I'm not even better than my fathers I'm not better than the prophet of old why don't you take my life I want to just come home but the Lord said no it's not time yet son there's more work for you to do so verse verse 7 he said and the angel of the Lord came again the second time and touch him and said arise and eat because the journey is too great for thee and he arose and did eat and drank and drink and went in the strength of that meat 40 days and 40 nights unto harb the Mount of God and he came thither unto a cave loded there and behold the word of the Lord came to him and he said unto him what doest thou here Elijah and he said I've have been very jealous for the Lord the Lord God of hosts for the children of Israel have forsaken th thy Covenant thrown down thy altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and I even I only am left and they seek my life to take it away 11 and he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the Lord and behold now this is the Lord coming to pass by and the Lord passed by and a greet and strong wind rent the mountains and break in pieces the racks before the Lord but the Lord was not in the wind and after the wind and earthquake but the Lord was not in the earthquake and after the earthquake a fire but the Lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice and it was so when Elijah heard it he r wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entring in of the cave and behold there came a voice unto him and said what thou what doest thou here now there were four element of the earth there were wind there were fire and there was earthquake but those elements do not bring Perfection your flesh your spirit your own soul doesn't bring Perfection What bring Perfection is the fourth element right the spoken word of God the voice of God is what make your purpose on this life [Music] defined you can have everything on this planet without Christ in you you have not even begun your life you might own businesses you might have multibillion dollar companies but with that Christ on the inside you don't even know why you are here so Elijah was made in such a way that he has to hear the voice of God before he could act right and God made his ministers and remember when I say ministers not only five-fold ministers all his sons and daughters that you have to hear the voice of God in your heart before you take any step or action you have to have the conviction of the Holy Ghost in your heart to be a to be able to execute What the Lord Has ordained you to execute amen so Elijah didn't depend on the for three elements the fire the mountain the shakings the earthquake but when the voice came the voice was the Capstone the voice was the ultimate the voice was the control tower and if you can pray and hear the words of God before we take actions you will not be defeated that's why we need to pray and consult the Lord consult the word before you take action so that when you take action You Know that heaven and earth is behind your action glory to the Lord glory to the Lord hallelujah yes let me give you my testimony here okay let's go to the next slide we had a ministers meeting in Cancun August 23rd 2023 I just had my graduation May the 12th of this year and I graduate from pharmacy school doctor of pharmacy program and uh right after graduation there was a email that there was a job looking for you don't even have to register you don't have to be a registered pharmacist there was a job in from one alomi looking for two intern two we call it Pharmacy graduate and I was the only one from from from Texas I'm a t Texan resident so there was a job in a Austin Texas and this a six-digit uh uh job yes sir and you don't have to you don't have to be registered you don't have to write your board exams just be ready to to go to Texas and I was going to preach in in Cancun Mexico now there were things of God that you don't you don't take decisions hly you don't take random decision because of manitary inment that's right but your decision is based on the still Small Voice so this email keep poing even my professors know that I'm the only one from Texas before graduation you had a meeting they do have meetings with the student to see what are the best Prospect and things for you because when get job it put the school in good shape so cuz they take thousands of dollars from you so they want to make sure that you got a job to pay your give it back Uncle Sam is waiting for you if I should give a testimony not a testimony but you know we are in a society where it's everything is driven by money I wasn't I'll come back to this but let me give say this in person I was in one of the hospital doing my rotation and and the doctors were communicating with the doctors and said even these days we don't go to where our our passion and our talents are because you got to pay your student loan he said most doctors are going to cardio cardio instead of going said I really love to be a family doctor another one said I want to be a pediatrician wow but it hasn't PID that much family doctor doesn't give you much money but if you go to heart diseases diabetes so they've already gone to school for 8 years he's done intern for four three years and he's going to do H what do you call a fellowship another 3 to 4 years and you expect him to come and take peanuts no he has to take money because after that cause your loan will be about th000 sorry $1 million between 500 to 1 million so now instead of doing what they they were is in their heart to do to be a family doctor you has to go and specialize in diabetes or in in heart diseases to be able to get some dead president and you know the dead president the dollar bill the Lincoln and the Washington so that's what the capital capitalist American that's to it you know that's a it's the money money industry Big farma Medicine everything even doctors are going on strike and healthcare workare because the people at the top are getting their money but the nurses and the doctors are they work them like horses but they don't get enough so they strike they're going on strike H for GM and business are workers are going on strike because of money you know cuz the societ is run on money but now it comes to God and God's Sons and Daughters of course we need the money to preach the gospel your clothes were bought by money right you have to go from here go to restaurant and pay money to to feed your family but you don't put money first right in the Pyramid of life we put Christ first amen amen family saken amen and then money and whatever job third at the base but in society we sweet things around manifest is not is gone God is not in the picture so Things Fall Apart Nothing is holding in our society but we the Sons and Daughters of God we don't take decision just because of mandatary incitement incitement but we take decision based on the word of God so this email keep popping up for Texas and they want two pharmacist not registered and I'm really really connected in Texas I've lived there longest in the US about 6 seven years I've Got Friends even my high school friends I've got a lot of Believers and this is just pack your bag and luggages and go and just start making money where's brother hos where is he he's not here I think he's taking the baby but used to tease me and sister Amanda when we were going to school he said but qu and my wife they are professional student that's what they do so M andu they just love to St that's what they do s about school you know so Pap that was the time for me to make money but in the things of the Lord you put God first you see listen to The Still Small Voice where God is leading you if the Lord is leading you praise God but you have to hear that anchor where the Lord is leading you you have that still Small Voice that resonate in your heart before you take action that's right there was a king called I think Hezekiah and King Ahab they were all together we going for a war and 400 Prophet prophesied that King oh King Ahab go you're going to be victorious they even show the spirit of of the Lord came on them anointing came on them and they show how Hezekiah was going to win the victory but then something didn't resonate in the heart of Hezekiah how Ahab was going to win said is there no other Prophet is there no any other Prophet because he wanted to have that sh the Lord he wanted to hear that still Small Voice he wanted to be con convinced and when you get convinced you get concerned because if you are not convinced you become robotic right robot don't don't have to be convinced they have been programmed to pack this tool and put it here but we are not robot of men and women we are not robot to money but we are robot to Jesus Christ he's the one who has ordained our lives so we had this meeting and I'll probably pause here and give some more more testim not testimony surrounding this meeting let's go to the next one these are the meetings H we had the ministers about 40 of them from different part of Mexico some came from drove from 40 40 hours all way to come for this meeting some came with a youth the youth were playing drums they were they were singing singing group about 20 30 people and they are not well to do here but the purpose of God there's something in their heart the love of Christ in their heart and I realize the train they you different they just get them to get involved in the things of God I saw young sister teenagers playing drums in two of the cities and a young boy about let me see about 8 years old he's got this it's like a metal with a com metalic comb and they were playing my brother you you just see the anointing of the Lord and one brother said my daughters they are into music so they high school they have a program where they specialize in music they don't partake in other things of of of high school they just stay with things that they can use it in the house of the Lord and so if you you the young people can give your heart to the Lord God will use you you don't have to be 20 years old to begin your life with the Lord if you are not too young for the devil to use you you are not too young for God to use you say William Braham if you want to be baptized tell your pastor to baptize you if you see something a gift in you tell your parents tell your minister tell your pastor so that that gift could be used and harnessed to the glory of the Lord don't give your voice to singing rock and roll don't give your body to singing to dancing music that that that will bring SP of Hell on you but rather give your heart to the Lord Jesus Christ seek for the Holy Ghost baptism am know your purpose we need to teach the children the fear of the Lord that is the most important thing the children when they begin to learn the fear of the Lord they begin to learn cause and effect if you do this this is the result if you don't do this this is the result they make wise decision so we need to teach children how to fear the lord what the fear of the Lord It's the love of God not that God is going to kill you you have to run away but the fear of the Lord is you loving the Lord in your own little way that you purpose in your heart that God put me here on this purpose on this Earth for a purpose and I'm here to find out though I don't know my purpose on this Earth but I want to find out what God made me for you don't remember how when you were in your mother's womb you didn't remember when you were in your daddy's laings but somewhere you remember that you begin to grow you realize your environment you look at the atmosphere begin to get cognizance with your family but God has got Eternal purpose in for your life that you have to recognize from by Prayer by the word Yeah by through the ministry to know what God God has ordained your life for and when you know what God has put your life here on this for you already want the victory cuz nothing in this world will be able to take you away from that purpose but if you don't have nothing to live for the word will give you something to live for pop music rap music rock and roll lesbianism gays and different things and all the programs of the world technology will consume your life and at the when you are when when it's about for you time for you to live this world you look back and you see that your life was wasted your life was a trash because you didn't fulfill the purpose you were here for so while you've been blessed to be in a church to have parents who are who are Christians Holy Ghost fill men and women to have ministers that pre the word of God to you take advantage and make sure that you know what you are here for because when you are here in this atmosphere even if you are not a Christian the Holy Ghost will blow around you you can wear long skirt to the to the to the ground you can have decent hair cut as a young boy you can wear cover yourself but when you are outside the church that's when the battle begins when you're outside home that's where the battle begins when you are home even if you don't have the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost of your parents covers you their Covenant and their token covers you right so it's easy for you to have that atmosphere but your heart is not converted and then when you get outside then he that is in you you're going to show that oh all along you didn't you were not even a Christian you just assumed dressed like a Christian sing Christian songs was in a Christian church had a holy ghost for pastor had ministers and deacons you are you just conformed to religion religion is means an actor to be to be a preacher I need to wear suit so you can wear suit like brother Jack brother Solon brother brother brother Joseph brother Troy but that doesn't make you a Holy Ghost full brother you can wear long skirts night de dress like your parents but without the Christ on the inside without the New Birth when you get to Atmosphere you're going to put on earrings you're going to you're going to dress put on pants to be able to work go and work and get money right if you are by yourself maybe you rent a house you need to pay your rent and all the work people they wear pant what are you going to do they wear a pair of trousers but you know as a daughter of God that is not your clothing that's right are you going to agree with them for them to like you or you going to stand as a weirdo they're going to call you a weirdo why do you wear long skits to to work this is work put on your pants they're going to ask you questions to your face come on brother that's right come on they're going to challenge you that's right why don't you wear pants right you can wear your SK to church this is not Church in America about 90 probably 9% of women wear pens right that's the that's the norm so why do you why don't you just put on your your your your jeans and look nice know look easy easy work easy and work easy that's where the test begins that's where you going to prove what is in you that's where you're going to start a hypocrite now Pastor is not there dad and mom are not there so you put in earrings you put in all kinds of chains the brothers yeah you put on pants you put on different things that doesn't pertain to your character that's right begin to have a boyfriend when you are not married you begin to move out of your parents home moving with your boyfriend if you moveing with your boyfriend on that terms you're going to get a broken heart and either come back home or get stranded but if you mooving with the Lord Jesus Christ in your heart and wait on him the Lord Jesus Christ will give you your husband or your [Applause] wife thank you brother Jack so make sure you moveing with the Lord first how do you moveing with the Lord in your heart yes he doesn't need bu this building he doesn't need a mansion he doesn't need your rented home he doesn't need your mortgage house but he want your home which is your heart so moveing with the Lord let the Lord take anchor in your heart be filled with the Holy Spirit you have to ask yourself a question I've been going to church with my parents for years do I put your name there quu or whoever you are put your name there do I have Christ on the inside of me that's right am that's it yes sir you have to ask yourself I repeat do I yes but Troy but Jack sister abigil brother Joseph brother Mark every one of us do I qu have Christ on the inside sir if tomorrow or today uhhuh I should die on the job right the job that has enslaved you if you died on the Jil you get a heart attack and die do I have do I have Christ to sport me to where I'm [Applause] going if hurricane comes and you don't survive the hurricane are you ready to leave this earth come on man because no matter no matter how long you live you still going to leave this earth one way or the other so this place is on your Eternal home or let put it in this in a better way this mold of flesh and blood is not for Eternal but it's for temporal purpose to serve the purpose of God and you have to pray and wait on the Lord and move in with the Lord that the Lord himself will show you his purpose for your life and then your life begins from there Glory Hallelujah so I had to decline a job that will pay for everything for me even looking for two positions I could have accepted the job and even look for another friend because they want alomi but for the things of God's sck you have to move when the Lord moves you don't move when the Lord doesn't move because if you move without the Lord you are going on your own you have to wait yes you're going to lose money it's going to affect you it's going to affect your economy you're going to feel the pinch in your body it doesn't mean the gospel is not cheap sacrifice it will affect your reputation it will affect your finances Jesus it will affect your family it will affect your dignity it affect your prestige it will affect you in all angles of life but that's the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ it is the greatest things you can ever have even if it cost you your life it cost people their Liv sometimes ago women have died freely for the Gospel of Jesus Christ in times of Paul they gave their life they didn't denounce Christ amen they were given options to live you either accept that pope of now we call them Pope the emperor of Rome the vi of Rome has got the power to forgive sin if you don't accept it You' got Lions ready to pounce on you they're going to cut you the rap women take their the baby in the womb the fs and ask the husband whether you repent from being a Christian if you don't repent they can cut your hair your head they didn't deny Jesus Christ that was a time Sensation that they live in with us we can preach everywhere they're going to they're not going to put you in jail God is asking us to live for him to give all of our heart to him to make sacrifices as the ministers it caused them as your pastor maybe his family will know the effect of the ministry on him because if it doesn't cost you then it's not a it's not a real sacrifice that's right one time Abraham's wife died his precious wife they marri when they were teenagers Sarah and Abraham maybe 28 and 18 or whatever and they grew for a long time you know they had each other's back even when they were telling lies so Abraham and Sarah really love each other regardless of the tri they went through and so Sarah died and and they were in a Strange Land the king said Abraham you've been blessed you have been a blessing to us whatever place you want just take it and Bar your your your wife Abraham said no I want I will pay for whatever they used to pay in shekels coins and gold and and Silvers and things like that I want something that will cost me I don't want to have a place for for bury my wife which doesn't cost me I'll pay for it sir and that is a sacrifice sir because he love he love Sarah they had each other's back you know they plan to tell a lie to defend Abraham and when sah made the wrong choice give he made to Abraham Abraham supported Sarah they had their each other's back through thick and thin even in their mistake Glory Hallelujah said The Minister's Wife your husband is wrong or one is yes you just stay with him heart is back amen you had your ministers by your pastors back amen that's right you had your parents back that's right you have your children's back right a mother would never forsake her children a mother knew that her son St he rob a bank but a mother that my my son is innocent he's always been a good boy the police don't just don't just they just don't like him but deep within him he know that his son he started stealing coins when he was young he know that the sons did what he did by a mother's heart no way he's the best son that is the love of God remember Auntie Jima in is Alabama the lady that made his son was flirting with women and she had a disease but he said he's my sweetheart sthe he's my love he's my honey he just love him just the same she plac a token on on on on his son regardless of her backsliding and that's what if a mother can do to to a daughter or a son how much more the almighty [Applause] God regardless of how far you gone he doesn't call you a servant he calls you my daughter he calls you my son he call you my beloved he call you my predestinated my elected lady he call you my chosen look at David how he disappointed God he had all the women right that's their Covenant in the Old Testament they could practice polygamy said they actually have only one true wife the rest are concubines legal concubines David had 500 and he still went for BBA he filed wul but the Lord still had his back he said David is a man after my own heart how the Lord's choice is not based on condition his love is unconditional love no matter how far you stoop he still calls you my daughter nothing can't break the Covenant of God you break your Covenant and fail him but he will never break his Covenant because he knew you before the foundation of the world and if you are not part of the billions and the trillions in eternity is not full the Lord is not it doesn't click it doesn't the Lord is not at peace a Shepherd is not at peace right when one sheep is lost isra isn't the president right now prime minister a family has been kidnapped I don't know how many but of all the I don't know the population of Israel right now maybe million plus they still not at peace because a couple of family let's say 10 20 30 have been kidnapped they want to have that person back America wasn't wasn't at peace when a young Soldier went to North Korea they have to have have a deal with what's the name Kim J to bring him back of all the how many 300 and something million people in America just one citizen us has to pay money there was one lady who was kidna kidnapping Haiti she was a nurse American married to a Asian man she was doing a missionary teaching and she was kidnapped right they didn't want to encourage the the kidnappers so they didn't specify but they could they paid maybe Millions of Dall list for as a ransom to just get one American citizen back to the usow that is how the love of a country if politicians can do that to their citizens how much more the almighty God Glory Hallelujah yeah it's difficult to follow the PowerPoint let's let's try just the same let's go to the next slide I just want to just throw this PowerPoint behind and just move but let's look at Abraham and I'm just giving you a foot for thought was he a triplet let's find out from the Bible let's read Genesis chapter 11 verse let's say verse 20 to 20 27 and let's see verse 20 said and Ru lived two 2 and 30 years and begat serug and Ru lived after he begat Ser 27 years and begat sons and daughters so the first born they tell the age that they were let's say brother Troy live 27 years and had his first born and then because they didn't mention all the names of the children the rest of them he live 200 years and then he begat many sons and daughters so now they started naming the generation of Abraham and then they got to said say Ser suuk live 30 years and begat nah and ser live after he begat N 200 years and beg sons and daughters and the 24 and N be live 9 and 20 years which is 29 years and beg Tera Tera is Abraham's father right and N lived after he beg Tera and 119 years and beg Sons and Daughters 26 I want you to take a notice of this and Tera lived 70 years and beat Abraham nah and Har and I'll show you about why this scripture open my eyes to why Abraham was so connected to lot even though lot not didn't disappoint him took his blessings and Abraham suffered but there's something about in the heart of Abraham concerning Lord CU Lord was his brother who passed away triplet they were triplet n lived H sorry Tara lived 70 years and the the firstborn there were three of them Abraham Abraham PR the Lord changed his name to Abraham he was called Abraham and the Lord added ham which is God's Own Name to him Abraham nah and Haram born when the father was the same year there were not three women no only one woman Abraham was a triplet sir and now and now these are the generations of Terror and Abraham now this are the Gen of Tera Tera begat Abraham n and haran and Haram be called lot if you read further wow Haram passed away and that was his brother's son so Abraham took him remember he took his father they traveled and his father passed and then Abraham Sarah and then lot and we know the ri raft that were between Lord's servant and Abraham's servant and Abraham because of love he said you are my son you are my nephew his father his brother had died one of the triplet died so Abraham took him as as a son and said whatever you want you choose first yeah and he looked with his eyes and saw where there were Wells and rivers and and and and grass for his c c cattles and and sheep and things like that and Abraham had to suffer consequences for the love for the Covenant Abraham forsook his Blessing and now lot was in trouble he live in Sodom and Gomorrah where he live happened to be Sodom and gomorra full of lesbianism gay and whatever whatever view just like we have in in in this modern world and then there was a time that Lord was in trouble he was kidnapped ab and Abraham if it were you and I what are you going to do you're going to well he's going pay for a price for what he did to me you're going to take a cup of tea and drink and call your wife you remember Lord what he did toah look at what is happened to me I've heard he's been kidnapped let him pay the price of what he did to me but not Abraham the bloodline this is his brother who passed away son and Abraham could not I mean see his nephew being killed so Abraham who wasn't a soldier he took weapons that he had took his servant armed himself and they were kidna they kidna lot I think seven other kings or so Abraham went and fought and killed those enemies and rescued lot and and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah and brought them back and the Bible said that madc who was Christ Jesus before he became flesh Saed Abraham with wine and and and he serve Abraham with wine is that right yes for what he did there are certain choices that not everything that you do God is going to anoint you amen God is going to put in your heart so strongly yeah yeah but you going to make a sacrifice for the Lord am a sacrifice of your character to the Lord as a Young Brother as a young sister coming up all the school friends are doing what they do some of them break their virginity when they are 12 years old and they are proud of it their parents are proud of it certain parents allow their children at the age of 12 to go and live with their boyfriend that is how the society is you have you can have a choice to do that if you want to choose to but you can make a choice for the Lord Jesus Christ that you are a vessel created for the image of God you under God's covenant and you don't allow nobody to touch you until the Lord himself give you gives you your husband or your wife am you can make that choice for the Lord amen just like Abraham it cost him money to bury his wife let's look at Moses Moses was next to being a the Pharaoh that's we have a proverb in my country that when they they selling power you can sell your even your mom and by the power and when you get the power you can redeem your mother Park and then get all the power so Abraham could have made a choice he was next in line to become a pharaoh so it was easy for abrah to become a pharaoh pardon sorry thank you Moses becoming a pharaoh and pardon all Israel they didn't they didn't even need pardon he could free them that's the right way to use right from the bondage of being slaves and burden without being paid and then sign a decree you know sign a document a law so that this are free they've work all years he could have make Aeron his older brother his secretary of state you could have made Joshua and calb senators and governors and promote Israel because he's the Pharaoh Pharaoh is the supreme leader of of of of Egypt what he says nobody can debate his word right brother if he says that's it it's like that says the Lord that says Pharaoh wow that was easy way to abrah sorry Moses could have gone but Abraham was in the higher oracles the temples the pyramid they had pyramids in those time and looking at this people that building const building houses and being whipped and something in him yeah said I want to connect with this people yeah instead of becoming a pharaoh yeah Moses was a doctor he was a lawyer they didn't specialize they didn't break into part you learn all become Paul was a lawyer doctor he knew the medicine in Egypt but Moses sacrificed being a pharaoh to become one of them that God there still Small Voice could use him you're going to make some sacrifices if you want to hear that small voice if you want the Lord to walk closely with you you're going to sacrifice a chunk of your life your time your world to serve the Lord glory to the Lord because you have a Divine assignment here on this Earth let me give a testimony here about our precious sister Wason who is in glory and I believe she's listening now he had brother brother brother brother Smiley as a pastor yes he had brother Jack as a pastor was full of the Holy Ghost one day I think I don't remember the title of the sermon that I preach but I preached a sermon and out of it I read Psalm not Psalm Proverbs 9 1:3 I think it's one of my slides if you can help me let's go to that slice and I read it and I'll tell the impact what the Lord used the 5old ministry for Glory Hallelujah to the Lord Psalm 9 vers1 to3 right he said wisdom has builded her house she had heed out her Seven Pillars she had killed her Beast she had mangled her wine she had furnish her table she had set forth her maing she cried upon the highest places of the city who so is simple let him turn hether as as for him that wanted understanding she said to him come eat of my bread and drink of the wine which I have mangled for see the foolish and leave and go in the way of understanding verse one that's where that's the testimony I'm going to wisdom hath builded her house she had heun out her seven pill so I pre that seron went my I'm not sure whether it was the same day or the next week sister won shook my hand said brother quu you know how she talks I said brother thank you for the word You Preach you know I've read Proverbs 1 wisdom has built a house for years and years and I've tried to understand never understand wisdom is Is Not a Human Being how can wisdom build a house and I tried to I just wanted that understanding understand it but she couldn't wrap her head said brother when you preach and said the wisdom is the wife of Christ the Queen of Heaven Miss Jesus Christ the woman the lady in the church age who received material from the hand of The Messengers and B her character buil her house and invited her Maids her household that whosoever come and eat from my table he said brother thank you for the seron it wasn't I don't remember how many weeks I don't think it was more than a month and sister Wason went to be with the Lord and I always remember that testimony she share with me you don't know what you when you sacrifice your life for the Gospel of Jesus Christ to perfect his sins wasting had the Holy Ghost full of the Holy Ghost but that understanding she wanted and she had read this Proverbs over and over and over but she couldn't piece them together how can wisdom wisdom is something we imagine our mind how can wisdom build a house but wisdom is M Jesus Christ who received the word from the hands of the Lord just like Esther just like Ruth just like Mary and that's the church and the church buil a house just like the wise woman the virtuous woman who build a house feed their children and the husband is proud of of of of her the same thing you God is proud of you when the Lord can throw a challenge to the devil have you seen my servant have you seen my daughters you can put whatever sickness on them that will not move them you can do whatever you can do to my children you can destroy the economy they'll still be serving the lord amen amen you can take their jobs they will still serve the Lord amen you can take their business they'll still be singing and shouting Praises unto me that's amen and that is what the Lord does the wisdom amen hallelujah glory to our Lord am and in the Lord training is is his ministers he took them through some military training just like in the military when you become a soldier no matter your job skill they call it military occupation skills no matter whatever you do you can be an it if you go to basic training you're going to be trained to to go to war first number one yes sir if you are washer you do laundry you a cook in the military number one you have to learn how to fight like Israel every at the age of 18 everybody supposed to learn because they've got enemies all around and so in the military before you even learn your trade it medicine whatever to practice you got to take a gun and fight and they train you in a way that you you going to get a psych of being a soldier now some of the training means you're going to split your life into being a civilian and being a soldier they train you to be bipolar on quotes how to switch from being a civilian and to be in military mode cuz when there's a war there's an earthquake you have to go and rescue people you have to be ragged you have to be a thick skin to be able to do that so in the training sometime they they allow soldiers to dress nicely in they call AC their uniform with your Beret and everything and then they take you to the woods and in the woods they have got pools that is mdy dead Waters and you're going to wait in the waters because you might be rescuing people you are not going to standing in your in your uniform you're going to care about your uniform you don't even care about your life about 25 27 building they're going to give you a rope and you're going to be on this rope and come down so that if you afraid of height they'll take it they'll name it out of you so that you won't be afraid of hide they'll take you to a gas chamber your lungs oh my goodness train your lungs to get used to gases you feel like you are bringing your lungs is coming out you be coffin is not a word to train your heart that if somebody's Capt somebody's caught in a gas chamber you can just wait into it and go and rescue that person out of gas chamber wow like firefighters they are human beings they could be burn but they they training you have to get a psych of a firefighter you can go through the fires and rescue a mother a children from the house and you don't even care if he's going to if you end up losing your life because you have an allegiance to the nation as a fira as a soldier to defend and to save the people of the nation that is the natural in the natural the natural type of spiritual they train you to be ragged to fight you have to learn how to shoot short range and long range sometime they take you to the woods for 3 Days take you out of civilization don't think about cell phone don't think about computers they will lift you with a helicopter go in the woods they create a worse scenario wow and you fight you we not going to eat a a warm meal no we have a meal called M meals ready to eat and that meal has been reped for I don't know how many years it's been there it's been they' saving it and storing it for what whatever and then that's what you're going to eat and you're going to be comfortable with it don't worry you you're not going to think about drinking soup no you just eat M meals ready to eat Amen in the in in in the woods and you stay in the wood for 3 days you have to how to take shower within 5 minutes and sometime rce with 3 minutes because in the war time you are not going to think about taking shower so you're going to train all this you're going to drill all those into you and you able to switch to be a s quickly if there's any problem you call your family there's war even you don't have to tell your family some of the mission you just tell them that you are you are being deploying you to wherever going to wherever the mission is between you and your and your commander this and you go as a soldier and you put your life on the line to defend your nation someone you have never even met before he becomes your enemy wow you're going to fight somebody in another country you don't even know him do you think people in Russia and Ukraine they know each other no but they are standing for their Nations they are fighting to vend their Nation if if natural person natural Nation can groom people to defend to stand to put their life sacrifice their life to save their Nation how much more we the Sons and Daughters of God God is also trained before you become a minister God put you through certain ragged training like the eagle just to make you put you bring you to where he want you to be the status that you can work and then he can release you brother Jack go pre the gospel even when you don't want to preach brother TR brother Mark go pre the gospel so he take he turn you through thick and thin things that you don't even understand why am I going through this right from your childhood God is molding you to be a leader in the house of God a mother who is a leader in the house taking care of the children and he take you through certain training he give you the right parents or even not parents and you go through different things in life to M you to the exact character the Lord want you just like he did Sarah H sorry Esther Esther lost both parents when she was just a child so that she could learn not to depend on parents she learned and mod how to pray because she was going to be a queen first lady that's the easy part first ladies get all the fans and all the celebrities that's not a part but she was going to be a savior to Israel am and being a savior she wasn't going to fight with weapons but she's going to go on her knees and pray am to God Of Heaven am that things that were not normal you can't go to the king without being asked to go to the King right it can cost your life but through through prayer and and the word of the Lord and the Holy Ghost H Esther could go before the king when she was not being she's not being called to appear before the king so the Lord take you through different scenarios you might not understand your life you might not understand why you've been given a boss who suppresses you you might not understand why you've given parent that are very strict God is molding you for a purpose amen I had a brother friend who's a minister he's actually a pastor when he was in college he said bro my mom buys everything for me even my underwears he said my mom doesn't let me go shopping he said my sister can do their own sh but not me wow because the mother a Pentecostal mother saw a gift in his son a Methodist and he didn't want him to anything to to mess himself with women and things like that so the mom was protected of him when he was even in college when he was a preacher until the right time that the Lord allow him so there are certain things you you won't understand why your parents treat you the way they treat you if youve got Godly Parents because they see something in you you don't see that's right you just a young young kid right a child right all you know is being a child but the Lord the parents have seen something in you that's right that they know God is going to use this my daughter and we need to keep our eyes on her they don't allow you to mingle with certain friends they don't allow you to go out in certain times they keep you in the house most of the time do CH wash and do certain things because you're going to be a mother you're going to be a Minister's Wife you're going to be a warrior in the house of the Lord you're going to be a prayer Warrior to pray to bring Jehovah God into existence oh my Glory Hallelujah I remember one of the the trip we went to Cancun I'm just summarizing in Cancun we had three days of services we had ministers meeting from night to 2 we break to each L lunch and snacks and then 6:30 normal service about 300 to 400 people in attendance from different states a minister from Colombia and his family One Pastor from uh Belgium and the brother flew from Brussels to to Mexico City no no sorry to Istanbul Turkey I think 14 hours and then from Mexico City from istanb to Mexico City about 10 or another 14 hours 12 hours then from Mexico City to Canon and the brother was allergic to Pork and he didn't know that the food that were eating there was Pok the people the the sisters also didn't know so he had Park and was having this thring headache so he had to miss two of he was just in the room he couldn't in the hotel he couldn't even go for the two of the meeting so we arranged that H after service I'll come quickly and then I'll go and buy we go and buy pizza or something for him because he couldn't he couldn't even eat so and I didn't know I was going to preach I know I was going to preach one of the days but the pastor didn't tell me so when I go there we're just having fellowship and their are songs it will lift you to the to Eternity they start the songs and worship and the brother said you going to bring the word I said have my my laptop and and things at at the hotel he said don't worry I said okay let me go and pray in certain Warfare you don't you don't need a PowerPoint and slice sometime you don't even need a Bible you need God am so okay let me go to the restroom and consult my boss and see what my boss ISS so so I went to PR okay no problem you go so quickly the Lord led me to Esther chapter 5 I just pick and it just the Lord does the way the Lord leads he put something in you and he just the Lord did wonderful I don't have time to go through all them so I was right after service I was supposed to come to the the driver the brother will pick me to the hotel to go and buy food for the brother so after that they don't release you you they fellowship with you give you contact number to come and visit different cities and things like that and the brother was on my mind I got to go and get food for my brother so right after we finished I left the temp the auditorium and I saw an elderly woman sitting I think she's in the 80s sitting in a wheelchair with her children and and other people and I just felt moved to go to her and I went said brother before you speak we want to tell you something we wanted to see you but we know ministers are around you and we just pray that Lord if it's your will for brotheru to come and speak with us we just want to take pictures with him and share some testimony and said our mother is I think 82 8 something we want you to pray for her and the two daughters one has lost the husband and one of the son one of the family member was also in a wheelchair and I know I have this brother I have to it was almost 11 I have to go quickly to the hotel but the Lord will put something in your heart prayers of a saint just like Abraham's plane was grounded just to make room for Auntie Jima the Lord just in my heart right from the temp from the auditorium just went to the elderly fellowship with them pray for them and then continue and to buy pizza for my brother you never know what people sacrifice for the gospel I remember before the trip I preach here on August the 20th Sunday normally when I preach I don't give too much sleep to my eyes so I preach and the next day morning I was going to travel so I went back home and just did some sleeping slept good for a couple hours when I woke up everything things were turning like very good things were spinning around me hm what's going on here I just prayed and normally what it happens if you drop your blood pressure so certain medication we give it to elderly people we tell them not to rise up slowly from your bed sit down on your bed take your time and Rise slowly because if you rise quickly your pressure will drop and you can faint so I was thinking did I drop my blood pressure I don't take medication so what's going on here so I just drove to Bellington just to make sure everything is good everything was good the next morning when I woke up my stomach oh my goodness terrible so wow I don't want to be a casual 37,000 ft in the air I don't want to give that problem to the to the pilot and people I'm not going today so I'm going to change my flight to tomorrow Tuesday and then it's too early I wait when they around maybe 10:00 I'll let the pastor know that today I couldn't make it cuz it looks like I'm breaking my immune system my body is reacting pushing back on me I changed my ticket from Monday to Tuesday next day everything went through when I finished it came back to Monday I said what's going on here I changed it again went through the process check out and check in and so came back to Monday on the the 21st third time I said hm what's going on here I went to pray I said Lord if you want me to go I'm feeling horrible I can't be on a go on flight in this situation cuz my whole body is like shutting down I prayed and the Lord made I could go for the I could go and take the flight and go God bless you brother Quinton he gave me a ride and I went preach everything I didn't have any problem with the stomach but then very good things were spinning and I remember one one of the trip to we preach in canc we fin the meetings went to another city called chetumal chetumal we preach I preach in the morning Sunday and I was having runny nose so bad so one one the pastor from Colombia he got a he bring me a toilet papers tissue papers to clean my know and preaching in the right in the Pulpit preach for I don't know 45 minutes and give 15 testimonies and pray for the sick a brother with postrate cancer pray for him a sister death in one year pray for her pray for I think three other major situation pray for about 10 people whil me myself my nose was runny nose they bring tissue paper to me clean up and then keep preaching keep going and the pastor asked me to he want testimonies so I had 15 testimonies line up what the Lord did in my little Ministry for for the church Preach and then Sing sang One song and finished so the night we're going to preach in another country called bis they call it bisi bis was a country that was a small country close to Mexico colonized by the British so they speak English they speak Creo I think Asian language they speak Spanish of course and they speak another language from Africa mixed with other languages so one brother who speak English was going to go with them so the pastor from K said brother brotheru I think you are not feeling well so he wasn't going to go because his wife and the children didn't have passport so he had to stay behind they had another translator for for the pastor from Brussels so I said brother you pray for me he prayed and the brother the brother from brazel want me to be with him so I said he's not going to feel comfortable going to another country you know without you without me so you just pray for me he prayed and went to bise crossed the border to another country so the pastor tells me he preach in his church and then cross the border 1 hour to go and preach in another country every Sunday and comes back and he's got another mission in in in the city Co toor City close to Cancun so we went to B preach and there it doesn't matter how if you preach even if it's midnight you still have to eat so they invited us to a home eat Fellowship for like an hour before they let us lose to come back to Mexico and cross the border about 2: a.m. in the night cross the border back to chetumal and then the mission was more or less completed and went to rest when I came back to me the long so short I came back I be to have this uh vericle and I pray Lord I just when I sleep and I wake up on the right side things were spinning everything spinning so I was in the house most of the time and I prayed to the Lord this is so uncomfortable I can't function don't the only thing is I could drive without having that experience and I went to buy certain medication it even made it worse so I said Lord i' I'm Healed I don't even care about the symptoms amen I pronounce my healing so I just went on and one day I woke up and I fell in my spirit I'm healed amen and that was it amen there was choices that you make for the gospel that has got Eternal rewards and I want to go quickly let's come to the slide the choice that but Abraham made yes in his ministry yes an eternal reward so I want to read something quickly let's come back to I just go through let me see I'll just keep through them and you can read them right so now this was brother Braham one brother is called brother Victor Leo Leo French Victor Leo went to a Israel Jerusalem right and then he went to happened to be in the tomb where Jesus was laid he took one of the stones or something like that he made a rck and he made a klings as a gift soor for B Braham and there was a red stripe like the cross in it and he just when he was there baham came on his mind and said why is it so hard for Abraham certain Ministry is hard for for the people because of the nature of the ministry because you are delivering Gathering people the devil is not going to give them to that okay take take this because he's using the Sons and Daughters of God for his purpose so you have it's a fight and the enemy will fight you so that you won't be able to deliver the people he want to rule the people so this brother made this cing for brother Braham and there was a a prophecy on brother Braham this is what I want to read okay married and divorce 65 paragraph 48 then Danny what he does for har he makes little Stones he walk out of to where the cross had been put where they said the cross set in the Rock no one was there so he broke off a little piece of rack and put it in his pocket for a souvenir come home and made a pair of celings out of it and strangely when he made them they look to be blasting and right through each of them in continuity runs straight narrow path right through both of them now that might be just someone else might not notice it but to me it's complimentary to the things that I believe I believe that everything has a meaning right and I believe most of you the same thing sometime I'll be there and I I look at the clock is 111 yeah 11 is number of stand as a true disciple of God certain little things God vindicate to you a daughter of God that you are his daughter he's in your life you don't have to be afraid so let let's let's go to the next slide so there was a prophecy okay let's go let's go I skip some of them go to the next slide okay I'll read this one he said look at the brother was giv a comment said God bless you Abraham he said I hope this doesn't sound sacr relgious but to my way of see that message could be 23rd chapter of Revelation and when he said that he started speaking in tongues and I was say that Abraham's message all of them is 23rd chapter there should be 23rd chapter of Revelation it's part of the word of God but it was only written in symbols and revealed at the right time so the brother spoke in Tong when he hadn't okay let's go forward okay a boy who had never ever heard of such thing a bapti by denomination he turned white and he look at me he didn't know what to do let me see how many was there at that time there were three Witnesses I'm just skipping the 133 and and and there was a great French woman sitting down there she said she raised up and said why said why that don't need any interpretation that was purely French the boy said I don't know one word of French and she wrote down what he said let's go to next one let's go to the next slide please right I standing in the Gap you know and then there was a man sitting on the corner he said that's correct I've got wrot it down said in French way back a blond okay let me skip them he said he was The Interpreter for the UN for French and this man was over here was Victor Leo of the an anv church out there and he wrote it down and I've got a interpretation of it next slide please is said listen to this if I can read I so the man was testifying I Victor Leu I'm a full blooded Frenchman born again Christian F of the Holy Ghost my address is 809 North King Road Los Angeles 46 I attended B bethl Temple Pastor an Vic Pastor a true translation that I Proclaim of Prophecy said over Abraham given by Danny Henry in French Fe February the 11 1961 at the four gospel businessman's breakfast a true translation of the prophecy let's go further now it's going to say what it said now here is what it said because th because thou H has chosen the Narrow Path this was God speaking FR sorry speaking through Victor Leu concerning B Braham so now this is what he said because thou has chosen the Narrow Path the harder way thou has chosen in your thou has walked in your own choosing now I can see that Moses had to make his choice to see thou has picked the precise and correct way correct decision and it is my way underlined my way the Holy Spirit speaking back because of this momentous decision a huge portion of Heaven awaits you await thee what a glorious decision now listen what a glorious decision thou Hast made this in itself is that which will make and come to pass the tremendous Victor in the love divine so baham made a choice God didn't choose for him he made a choice to serve the Lord in that capacity am he was given a bill of I think he was given a an envelope of th $1 million he needed money but the men of God and women of God if things that don't resonate here the them what them right it doesn't click it doesn't Flash the red light no he didn't accept it they wanted to buy him a jet plane to fly in it he said no cuz the people that I deal with they are po people with cancer breast canc cancer tumor on their faces if I come so in so way up here I won't be able to connect with them so I have to be in a certain way to resonate with them that's why the Lord Jesus CHR the king of glory came all the way down to become a human being to resonate with you and I so brah was a very one of the I'll look at two examples in my life the Lord Jesus Christ himself and William Braham I look at their sincerity sometime you don't have to see a person even they writing what they said you can go into their life form and see their nature never spoke evil about or Robert and Billy Graham there was a time somebody was say Abraham you are so easy to reach out to H we can invite you even if for Home Services but brother Ora and brother Billy bil Billy Billy Graham and Ora Robert you have to have certain numbers certain amount of money certain offering certain maybe 5,000 people to be able to invite them I said no brother you don't understand but AA has got a worldwide program it's got television is God employees to pay for he has to pay for these people so if if you at home 50 people he's going to lose he runs University and TV program radio program with he had a small office and a taiter and that's it so with him is more on the supernatural side that is that's why brother oral and brother Billy Graham cannot attend to 50 people but for me the Lord made me that way that even if you invite me for Home Service two people 10 people he'll be able to come and pray for you come and have fellowship with you and God made you who you are I'm not saying money is bad no we need money God will bless you what are you doing for for for your business because we need money to run the gospel and I can tell you my testimony I have to deep into my pocket buy my ticket go preach I don't go preach to people that that was brother take this one for Ticket No I preach and even sometime have to the dollars that is left give it to to some of the Brethren to help them in certain things that they do and that's what the Lord has called you for amen amen and somebody to the Lord has called him for sponsorship people sponsor him that is Ministry even some of the denomination churches not all of them are fake some of them are sincere so the Lord made the way he made him to connect with the people and the Lord has made you the way you are he made brother Jack brother Troy brother Smiley and all the ministers here our sister to be able to connect with the people of God and the choices that you make there's a blessing not only on the other side by In This Side of Heaven am that will be for you and your family and even your descendants unborn amen because you took the momental decision the precise way which is the Lord's way and that's where God is happy with it let's let's go I'm just about to go finish let's read the next slide quickly the same sermon standing the Gap he said now I read 138 now in the love divine Divine love how can that can that be divine love if it isn't the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is divine love I don't have to say nothing about it you know it and this the scripture I talk about sister won the Lord bless you and your family shall we be on our feet so in serving the lord everybody is going to make a choice you're going to make certain decisions especially the young people you are the Most Blessed Most Blessed because you are in the in the time that you can make the right decision now you don't have to go through certain mistakes amen right in one of my the trip one of the Cities I met a sister and the sister Fellowship has singing and the way she conducted herself was different and so after the service the pastor gave a testimony about this sister she sink and you could see the anointing is way different and how she conduct herself seven Ministries and the Pastor said this sister was a lesbian for a very long time she was I think about 52 up to 55 but most of her time she was a lesbian she's coming from Catholic origin she didn't have anything but one day I preached I had I think evangelism in town and she heard the message and the voice she gave her her to the Lord and you could see the the love for God that she has and the service she even bought a h what the name some fruits for me and the pastor from Brussels that I have some here the way she serve because her sins that were many has been forgiven and so her love for the Lord it just like Mary Magdalene who nobody people wrote her off but when he met Jesus he forgive all of his sins am and when Jesus was was crucified she was the one that took ointment cuz she didn't want the the body of his Lord to get in her mind she thought it was going to rat and they had medicine and Bing fluid but because of what the Lord has done for her the service of Mary Magdalene was way different What the Lord Has Done For You what has the Lord done for you and what can we render we cannot pay him back but the simple thing to give your heart to the Lord Amen to dress in a way that will portray the glory of the Lord amen God is not asking you to die physically but let the old man die and let Christ live in your heart so that you will show his glory and he will bless you shall we pray Our Father we thank you this day we bless you for what you've given to us father all the glory to your name help us to sacrifice as you sacrificed for us the Covenant that Lord you made

body and um I want to just encourage the church that when we uh announce someone from our church is leaving to go somewhere uh if we would really really uh take that person in prayer you just don't realize how the enemy attacks uh when you're trying to do something for the Lord is it's not always just um uh fun and games but uh there are things that you go through in your body and um and you know it's one thing being being sick here in the US it's a whole another thing being sick in a third world country and uh you can't get to hospitals you know I remember just even being in in in um uh Alaska I I thought that was the us but when I got up there it's Villages and uh when I got off the plane and looked around said oh no Walmart no McDonald's no no Burger King no KFC nothing no hospital nothing you know I mean and if you want to go to the hospital you had to catch a flight when when the plane was available catch a flight an hour to get to the hospital by that time you could be gone and they offered me fresh well I said no no no no I can't have none of that if you want me to preach I can't eat that right and I mean you just go through things out there you just don't know and you you know I mean last time I went just even to Romania I I forgot they brushing my teeth and I um got a little that water to wash my mouth out in the sink if y'all don't know nothing about it just you don't want to know about it things happen right and you stuck here and like you got to preach and people expecting you to preach and your body doing something different we need your prayers we need your prayers this is this this was just a wonderful sermon I believe uh all of us were fed here today amen by the word of God and and this was just I mean I I I I thank God every situation was spoke to here today even even down to you know him not taking that job I think we just heard on the tape on Friday night that everything that is presented to you is not of God even though you might succeed in it don't mean success don't mean it's of God it don't mean it's of God the Rich Young Ruler succeeded but it was not of God right so you got to be very very care is this really a decision that's going to bring glory and honor to God cuz my life is in his hands amen amen if it don't bring honor to God just let it go we used to have a song that we used to sing years ago only what you do Christ amen for Christ will last only what you do for him will be counted in the end on only what you do for Christ will last let's pray father we thank you for your word that has come to our hearts here today Lord we've been touched and amen just uh our hearts have been spoken to I believe every every heart in here we can draw closer to you through the word that we've heard Lord I I know your servant um God he he just spoke what was in his heart heart and in doing so he ministered to many needs here today uh God not just those that are here but many even that are listening online I I think of conversations that I've had this this past week Lord and how this brother just walked right into those conversations God I know that it's you amen speaking to us so we ask that you would just bless amen our brother re re renew him and God may we leave here meditating and thinking on the things we have heard Lord uh it's not by accident it's not by chance that that this would come forth to us so Lord help us to hear your voice and be sensitive to the voice of God Amen to the spirit of God that would speak to us and let us find ourselves uh in alignment and in obedience with the word of God we want you to get the glory we want you to get the honor we want you to get the praise out of everything we do and we realize sometimes we have to make some tremendous sacrifices but oh God in the midst of that we we'll never forsake forsake houses we never forsake uh families we never forsake uh jobs we never forsake any of these things and not be rewarded by you later so Lord help us to realize you're in control sometimes you put these things before us to see what decision we'll make you just want to see what we'll do you did that with the children of Israel you wanted to see what they were going to do so you led them down a certain path just to see what they would do oh God and when they made the right choice then you honored it father we want to make the right choice we we want to we want to bring honor and glory to you you father that's our desire be glorified in US ask that you watch over the Saints as they leave this place but not your presence may you keep us Lord until we
