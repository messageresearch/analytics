[46:27] we want to speak on a little topic
[46:30] believe from your heart the supernatural
[46:34] Glory Hallelujah to the Lord we just
[46:37] have a couple of uh scriptures two
[46:40] scriptures one is from Mark chapter 11
[46:43] verse 22 to 24.
[46:46] we want to
[46:49] thank the lord we have a visitor with us
[46:51] I think it's sister Mylene
[46:55] Mala God bless sister Mila you welcome
[46:58] the Lord be with you amen
[47:01] amen
[47:03] God bless you
[47:05] so Mark chapter 11 verse 22-24
[47:10] Mark 11 22-24
[47:13] and Jesus answering said unto them have
[47:15] faith in God
[47:17] for verily I say unto you that
[47:19] whatsoever was River whosoever shall say
[47:23] unto this mountain be thou removed and
[47:25] be thou cast into the sea and shall not
[47:28] doubt in his heart but shall believe
[47:30] that those things which he said shall
[47:33] come to pass he shall have whatsoever he
[47:36] said
[47:36] therefore I say unto you that what
[47:39] things so ever you desire when he pray
[47:42] believe that you receive them and ye
[47:46] shall receive them
[47:49] let's repeat that 24 therefore I say
[47:52] unto you what things so ever ye desire
[47:57] When you pray believe that ye receive
[48:01] them and ye shall receive them amen
[48:06] Glory Hallelujah to the Lord
[48:08] let's see let's go to John 11 22-25
[48:13] if there's anything on your heart
[48:16] before you pray believe that you will
[48:19] receive them and when you pray in your
[48:22] prayers you've already received them and
[48:24] ye shall receive them amen
[48:27] John 11 22-25
[48:30] this was a conversation that was going
[48:32] on between Martha and the Lord Jesus
[48:34] Christ when his brother Lazarus passed
[48:37] away he was dead
[48:39] the life went out of him
[48:41] and 22 said but I know that even now
[48:44] whatsoever thou will ask of God God will
[48:48] give it to thee
[48:50] then said unto her that Jesus said unto
[48:52] her thy brother shall arise thy brother
[48:56] shall rise again Martha said unto him I
[49:00] know that he shall rise again in the
[49:02] resurrection at the last day now Martha
[49:05] want her brother to rise and it's before
[49:08] the author of life
[49:10] the one who put a breath into his
[49:12] brother Lazarus and he said your brother
[49:14] shall rise but then the mother is
[49:16] postponing her blessing to put it at the
[49:19] last day in the future but the Lord is
[49:21] so kind and good and beautiful he's the
[49:23] god of I am is the present the God is
[49:27] the one who is who is amen he said Jesus
[49:31] said unto her I am the resurrection and
[49:34] the life he that believeth in me though
[49:37] he were dead yet shall he live amen we
[49:41] shall take our seat God bless you
[49:44] glory to the Lord
[49:47] I am that I am is here
[49:49] and when you pray believe
[49:51] and when you believe you shall receive
[49:54] amen it doesn't matter what
[49:57] try and take your eyes off
[49:59] the issue and concentrate on Jesus
[50:02] Christ in you amen first of all you have
[50:05] to have him in you
[50:07] it's not enough being in the church
[50:10] it's not enough being in Christendom
[50:12] but then if Christ is not the inside
[50:15] your mind will be scattering all around
[50:18] looking at circumstances but not a cry
[50:21] because you don't have him here but when
[50:23] you have Christ at the center of your
[50:25] life
[50:26] then you have to hone in on the Christ
[50:28] in you he's the center of existence of
[50:31] all things amen Glory Hallelujah to the
[50:34] Lord so now believe from your heart the
[50:36] supernatural let's go to I want to look
[50:39] at the seed
[50:40] I'm going to look at new birth and I
[50:42] want to hone in on the children
[50:44] for the sake of time and they're sitting
[50:46] arrangement I wish I have all the
[50:47] children with in front of me but God
[50:49] willing someday will have it so I want
[50:51] you the children to just listen to this
[50:53] message
[50:54] is directly from my heart to you from
[50:56] the Lord to you amen the Lord has
[50:58] blessing for you the children
[51:00] you are the future of tomorrow
[51:03] and God is preparing you for something
[51:05] beyond your thinking amen and I don't
[51:09] know if it's a prophecy but I believe
[51:11] maybe between five years and 10 years
[51:14] but the jack is going to have
[51:16] a bunch of preachers here who is going
[51:18] to send some of them out to preach
[51:19] Minister somewhere else amen a lot of
[51:23] young beautiful preachers men and women
[51:26] of God that God is going to use amen the
[51:29] Lord bless you our brother Jerry brother
[51:31] Quentin Jr and the little ones that have
[51:34] got a gift seed in them brother brother
[51:36] Joseph and brother Xander and brother
[51:38] Xavier and many men and young sisters
[51:41] and young Brothers the Lord bless you
[51:43] all sister hadashes sister Abigail
[51:46] sister Shalom and every one of you I
[51:48] don't know all of your names but the
[51:50] Lord knows your name amen Glory
[51:52] Hallelujah the Lord bless you but then
[51:55] we want to see how this seed that the
[51:57] Lord planted before the foundation of
[51:58] the world will come out of you and
[52:01] manifest the way the Lord wants it so
[52:03] let's look at what is a seed I was just
[52:05] looking at the dictionary what is a seed
[52:08] now the seed of a plant looking at from
[52:10] the plant direction we have a lot of
[52:12] seed human beings are seed but we just
[52:14] want to focus on Plants he said the city
[52:16] is a unit a unit of reproduction in
[52:18] flowering plants capable of developing
[52:20] into another such plant so a seed
[52:25] of banana or bring for banana
[52:28] a seed of I have some seed I want to use
[52:30] illustration if you don't mind amen
[52:34] Glory Hallelujah of God what is this
[52:37] avocado
[52:39] or Spanish called awakati
[52:41] now this is a seed
[52:44] and I tried to get a couple of leaves of
[52:46] the same seed
[52:48] some this is where the Green Seed uh
[52:51] sorry Green Leaf
[52:54] and we have the dried leaves here
[52:57] and then we have the fruits
[53:03] the fruit of
[53:04] avocado itself amen
[53:07] let me try and squeeze them here here we
[53:09] go
[53:11] God bless you
[53:13] thank you maybe it's meant to be
[53:15] it's going to be part of the
[53:17] illustration so now he said they said
[53:19] it's a unit of reproduction in plants
[53:22] which is capable of developing into
[53:24] another search plan so if you plant this
[53:26] sea which is what avocado or avocate or
[53:30] pear
[53:31] is going to bring for the same thing
[53:33] amen
[53:35] and you are a seed I may see it
[53:37] the Lord planted you as Christ
[53:41] and you have to comfort as what as
[53:43] Christ
[53:44] but then before you come for this seed
[53:46] you have to go through cycle
[53:49] and bring forth flowers
[53:51] bring forth tree Twigs leaves and then
[53:55] pray for another search fruits sorry
[53:58] seed with fruits on it amen this is the
[54:02] fruit is what we eat of course we can
[54:04] use a seed for medicine and different
[54:07] things
[54:08] but then I want to just focus on the
[54:11] seed now where is the life of this seed
[54:13] coming from
[54:15] there's a life form in this seed
[54:18] and this life form is coming from the
[54:20] sixth dimension
[54:22] when he said this is dimension don't be
[54:24] scared it's just the mind of God
[54:27] is Christ it's another problem another
[54:30] sphere
[54:31] which is right here physically speaking
[54:34] but it's of another dimension that this
[54:38] eyes cannot detect
[54:40] it is meant for the heart to detect that
[54:43] dimension
[54:44] it means for you who has got Christ in
[54:46] you to see Christ in you amen so there's
[54:50] a life that the Lord spoke in Genesis
[54:52] that every seed should bring forth
[54:54] according to its kind the Genesis 1. so
[54:57] that that life before this
[55:00] seed fell on this ground and developed
[55:03] that life existed
[55:05] as an avocado seed or a avocado plant
[55:10] now that life on the other side the
[55:13] sixth Dimension has to reflect here in
[55:16] Earth the first second dimension
[55:18] First Dimension is just the space we're
[55:20] living in second dimension is matter if
[55:23] anything you can touch human body the
[55:26] computer whatever you can touch you can
[55:27] see a second dimension Third Dimension
[55:30] is time the dimension the realm that we
[55:33] are living in fourth dimension is
[55:34] communication science Internet TV
[55:37] computer microphone mobile phone all of
[55:41] them constitute the four dimension the
[55:44] First Dimension is a contrast which is
[55:46] hell
[55:47] Satan Lucifer demons cancer
[55:51] death
[55:53] crying suffering pain they have to come
[55:57] forth as a contrast so that they says
[55:59] that men should be manifested the sixth
[56:02] Dimension is Christ
[56:04] Jesus heaven
[56:06] eternity
[56:08] and peace and joy the word they feel
[56:11] funny the logos
[56:13] eternal life
[56:14] the seventh Dimension is Elohim the mind
[56:17] of Jesus Christ amen now this Dimension
[56:21] God had in mind
[56:22] to express everything was in him
[56:25] but he wanted to bring forth avocado
[56:28] seed as a tree as a fruit knowing that
[56:32] some of his children would love to enjoy
[56:33] these fruits some may use it for even
[56:36] the hair
[56:37] some will use it for
[56:39] boil the seed and their leaves for
[56:41] medicine so before the foundation of the
[56:43] world the lord spoke Let There Be
[56:46] avocado seed avocado tree
[56:50] and there was nothing in existence it
[56:53] was all in him
[56:54] but because it is the spoken word of the
[56:56] Almighty
[56:58] creation has to happen
[57:00] to bring the life the avocados tree that
[57:03] was there translated from the sixth
[57:06] Dimension into the first second and
[57:08] third dimension in Earth to grow in
[57:10] Earth in Florida or wherever it's come
[57:13] from so that you can enjoy this seed
[57:16] amen
[57:18] now there's a lot that governs
[57:20] reproduction
[57:22] the law is the spoken word of God what
[57:25] God spoke into existence is what is
[57:27] going to come to pass amen now let's go
[57:31] back now come to the human life god
[57:33] let's look at the second definition
[57:35] that's which I wrote myself seed
[57:38] Eternal thought of God capable of being
[57:41] transformed into Supernatural person
[57:43] that is a Christian
[57:45] a Christian is not somebody who believe
[57:47] that Jesus Christ died and resurrected
[57:50] that is on the nominal side by the
[57:53] Christian is a seed
[57:56] that has been transformed
[57:58] transferred transplanted
[58:01] from the mind of God
[58:03] and planted on Earth
[58:05] as a child to grow and now to manifest
[58:09] our life so a Christian is the one who
[58:12] has got Christ on the inside of him or
[58:15] her Glory Hallelujah to the Lord
[58:18] in a world we have religion as a
[58:20] Christian that's not what I'm talking
[58:21] about I want to hone on Christian a
[58:25] person with Jesus Christ Living on the
[58:27] inside of him or a person who has been
[58:30] transformed into Christ amen that when
[58:34] you are walking people see Christ in you
[58:36] when you are walking people see almighty
[58:39] God manifesting from your heart Glory
[58:42] Hallelujah the third definition is what
[58:44] I made up reproductive unit of eternal
[58:46] life which is seed reproductive unit of
[58:49] eternal life Sons and Daughters of
[58:51] Elohim as it was in the days of
[58:53] Pentecost
[58:54] Peter wasn't manifested as eternal life
[58:56] when he was cutting people's ears no
[58:58] when was casting people around no
[59:01] the seed was there but they said how
[59:04] they manifested
[59:05] by the day of Pentecost
[59:08] the seed was quickened the seat had to
[59:11] die first number one
[59:14] and then it has to remarry to eternal
[59:16] life
[59:17] amen so now let's look at how this seed
[59:20] it has to go to the ground it does
[59:23] everything about it has to rat
[59:25] everything in it even the gem has to rat
[59:28] but there's the spoken word of God that
[59:31] is spoke before the foundation of the
[59:32] world that governs the life of this seed
[59:34] and when everything is rotted then the
[59:37] life which is the mouth and the mind of
[59:39] Elohim will come out and manifest amen
[59:43] now let's look at how children grow
[59:47] if you get the best scientific machine
[59:50] the best security officer and what's the
[59:53] name I always forget the name
[59:55] Alia put Alia to watch how Alia is
[59:58] growing she's looking at me why did you
[1:00:00] mention my name
[1:00:02] Alia is growing if you get the best
[1:00:05] microscope telescopes the best whoever
[1:00:09] whatever eyes you have to watch how
[1:00:12] she's growing you never detect you can
[1:00:15] change Security offices 24 7 watch them
[1:00:18] maybe in about five weeks you're gonna
[1:00:20] see her height is increase
[1:00:22] she's getting some weight but how it
[1:00:25] increase you never know amen because
[1:00:28] it's something the Lord keep to himself
[1:00:30] amen how you sleep and wake up
[1:00:34] you know you go to sleep but in the
[1:00:36] course of your sleep you don't know what
[1:00:38] happened it's a mystery which belongs to
[1:00:41] the almighty amen even when you are on
[1:00:44] your bed the Lord is working on you he's
[1:00:47] healing you he's transforming you he's
[1:00:50] changing your character without you
[1:00:52] physically second dimensionally seeing
[1:00:54] because that life operate from the sixth
[1:00:57] Dimension Glory Hallelujah
[1:01:00] let's go go to the next slide
[1:01:02] let's look at the seed
[1:01:04] read a couple of quotations that the
[1:01:07] prophet talk about the seed we come back
[1:01:08] to it
[1:01:09] God The God Who is reaching mess in 1965
[1:01:12] 0119
[1:01:15] paragraph 40 and said we was we were
[1:01:18] speaking
[1:01:19] the other night on how the seed Must Die
[1:01:23] this seed has to die
[1:01:26] completely I have a kind of dried one
[1:01:28] here I think I have
[1:01:31] yes this has begun dying
[1:01:34] now it has to die and everything around
[1:01:36] the gym of Life must not only die but
[1:01:38] rats
[1:01:40] if it doesn't rot it cannot leave
[1:01:43] and rat is completely done away with
[1:01:47] it's finished and until we get into the
[1:01:49] into the place that our own ideas and
[1:01:52] our own thinking is completely gone and
[1:01:55] is rotted away from us
[1:01:57] then the gem of Life can begin to leave
[1:01:59] amen
[1:02:01] 41 now we might I might inject just a
[1:02:04] little bit of Doctrine here if you don't
[1:02:06] believe it that's all right it's that's
[1:02:08] okay I don't believe I do believe I
[1:02:11] believe that a man when he's born in
[1:02:13] this life in this world
[1:02:15] that when you are a little baby born
[1:02:17] into the world you could not be here
[1:02:19] without being the full knowledge of God
[1:02:21] because he's infinite and he knows all
[1:02:24] things
[1:02:25] and when that little baby is born into
[1:02:27] the world there's something in that baby
[1:02:29] if he is ever going to have life there's
[1:02:33] a lot of something in there
[1:02:34] in that child then
[1:02:36] that he comes to sooner or later that
[1:02:40] little seed is in him amen he's talking
[1:02:44] about the seed of eternal life it's not
[1:02:46] a lot of child and sooner or later he or
[1:02:49] she's going to manifest it 42 now if
[1:02:52] you've got eternal life tonight
[1:02:54] if you have eternal life then we always
[1:02:57] win
[1:02:58] and I want this one to I want to lock it
[1:03:01] in in your heart
[1:03:03] if you got eternal life tonight
[1:03:06] if we have eternal life
[1:03:08] then we always win because there's only
[1:03:11] one form of eternal life we was we
[1:03:14] always were
[1:03:15] and the reason we wear because we were
[1:03:18] part of God
[1:03:19] Elohim and God is the only thing that is
[1:03:22] eternal
[1:03:23] so if you have eternal life
[1:03:25] then always
[1:03:27] eternally before you came out of your
[1:03:29] mother's womb before you were spam in
[1:03:31] your father's loins you existed as
[1:03:35] whoever you are not in flesh of Earth
[1:03:39] but in the celestial Dimension as a
[1:03:42] human being around the age of 18.
[1:03:45] amen
[1:03:47] glory to the Lord
[1:03:53] amen and that's where your eternal
[1:03:56] security lives so if you existed in the
[1:03:58] mind of God
[1:03:59] the man of God is not a thought of man
[1:04:01] or an architect who planning his mind
[1:04:04] have a blueprint on a book
[1:04:07] to build a house
[1:04:09] the thought of God is real
[1:04:11] so if you say Brother Joseph
[1:04:13] was a Son of God before the foundation
[1:04:15] of the world
[1:04:16] brother Keepers that Keepers who are
[1:04:17] sons and others of God before the
[1:04:18] foundation of the world they existed as
[1:04:20] brother Keepers and sister Keepers and
[1:04:22] Brother Joseph
[1:04:23] amen
[1:04:25] but not in human flesh
[1:04:28] would notice this Blood
[1:04:30] he was a Celestial body and the blood
[1:04:33] was the Holy Spirit possitting in him in
[1:04:36] that dimension
[1:04:37] but the Lord wanted to form Brother
[1:04:39] Joseph
[1:04:40] to manifest Christ in this dimension
[1:04:44] he wanted to manifest sister Keepers to
[1:04:47] manifest Jesus Christ in this dimension
[1:04:50] so he put him in a family mother father
[1:04:53] and then they got together and brought
[1:04:55] his life as a baby
[1:04:57] and that life was with him
[1:05:00] oblivious of that
[1:05:02] you see yourself as a little child a
[1:05:04] daughter playing with dolls and babies
[1:05:06] and different things but it's a gem of
[1:05:08] life that was planted in you before the
[1:05:12] foundation of the world
[1:05:13] and that gem has to
[1:05:15] Quicken
[1:05:16] and before that gym has to Quicken
[1:05:18] there's another life as a contrast that
[1:05:21] is also in you
[1:05:22] and our life that is what you came
[1:05:24] through your parents through the sex
[1:05:26] birth
[1:05:27] and those two lives are contradictory
[1:05:29] Christ and Antichrist
[1:05:33] Christ is eternal life
[1:05:35] Satan
[1:05:37] is temporal it's a contrast
[1:05:40] is the opposite is death a sickness is
[1:05:45] hell it's torment is suffering pain and
[1:05:48] crying
[1:05:49] by Christ allow that so that he can
[1:05:52] bring joy peace love salvation
[1:05:56] Redemption so that we can look at the
[1:05:58] two and appreciate this one amen when
[1:06:03] you've seen death before when people die
[1:06:06] what do we do we cry we mourn we have
[1:06:09] pains in our hearts but when a baby is
[1:06:11] born we have joy the whole family and
[1:06:14] friends are happy we give gifts because
[1:06:17] there's life
[1:06:19] on the other side of the even more
[1:06:21] glorious side when a son or a daughter
[1:06:24] of God is Born Into the kingdom of
[1:06:25] heaven
[1:06:26] there's Greater Joy in heaven amen
[1:06:30] because that life is eternal amen the
[1:06:33] baby no matter how beautiful how
[1:06:35] gorgeous the baby will grow and die one
[1:06:37] someday
[1:06:38] but in life eternal is it tender it
[1:06:41] doesn't have a beginner doesn't have an
[1:06:42] end
[1:06:43] Glory let's go to the next slide
[1:06:47] the seed has to rot as we Illustrated
[1:06:50] and bring forth life again the message
[1:06:53] Paradox 65
[1:06:55] one zero zero one one seven products 101
[1:06:58] how the seat falls into the ground and
[1:07:00] it rots and it brings forth life again
[1:07:02] looks like if it was ever going to bring
[1:07:05] forth life it would be when it's in it
[1:07:07] it isn't it is in its perfect shape
[1:07:10] if life was ever in it then why wouldn't
[1:07:13] it just come forth put it in the ground
[1:07:16] the Life Spring forth why does all that
[1:07:19] is around our life all that is around
[1:07:21] that gem that no man can find how is it
[1:07:25] that everything material around the gem
[1:07:27] has to die so it can bring forth a new
[1:07:30] life but everything around it must also
[1:07:33] die and rat before it can bring for
[1:07:35] their life so it is with an individual
[1:07:37] as long as there's any human injection
[1:07:39] human ideas then gas Gem of Life the
[1:07:43] Holy Spirit cannot work you cannot be
[1:07:46] healed as long as there's just a
[1:07:48] fraction somewhere a fraction of doubt
[1:07:51] in your mind then you're gonna hinder
[1:07:53] your healing but if it doesn't matter no
[1:07:56] matter what the daughters have said that
[1:07:58] your cancer is terminal cancer stage
[1:08:00] four your family should get your
[1:08:02] graveyard and use the money to buy your
[1:08:04] casket and prepare for a nice funeral
[1:08:07] if you can look Beyond
[1:08:10] and look at Christ now Lord I have
[1:08:13] something to do on Earth
[1:08:15] my brother my sister my friend hasn't
[1:08:18] finished his or her life but your enemy
[1:08:21] and my enemy the devil want to terminate
[1:08:23] is life
[1:08:24] but Lord I speak life into my brother
[1:08:27] I speak life into my sister I speak
[1:08:30] cancer out of existence and I create
[1:08:33] life
[1:08:34] in my brother in my uncle in my aunt
[1:08:37] the Lord will bring them out because the
[1:08:40] Lord is life amen and creation is in
[1:08:43] your heart
[1:08:44] creation is in your mouth you are a
[1:08:46] daughter of god sister Nelly amen you're
[1:08:49] a daughter of God my precious sisters
[1:08:51] amen and when you speak that life you
[1:08:54] don't have to worry about circumstances
[1:08:56] you don't have to worry whether the
[1:08:58] situation is even more worse when you
[1:09:00] prayed the Lord has already heard your
[1:09:02] prayer Glory Hallelujah to the Lord
[1:09:06] about three days ago a family in
[1:09:09] Colombia sent me a message one sister
[1:09:11] her mom had cancer when I went there the
[1:09:14] last time
[1:09:14] I saw the tumor rather
[1:09:17] and the tumor was there and it was the
[1:09:19] Lord by his grace was good to her she
[1:09:21] was healed but the devil will come back
[1:09:23] again now the devil was eating the whole
[1:09:25] arm
[1:09:26] off the pictures were graphic when she
[1:09:29] sent it to me
[1:09:30] and at the same time her grandbaby that
[1:09:33] was born
[1:09:34] has some hard disease she was in ICU
[1:09:36] less than six months another baby's gone
[1:09:40] back to ICU on critical condition
[1:09:42] at the same time her husband has lost
[1:09:44] her job he doesn't have a job
[1:09:46] and with one sister three crisis looming
[1:09:49] around her
[1:09:51] but I love her faith he said hermano
[1:09:53] brother pray for me and I believe that
[1:09:55] the Lord is going to use this situation
[1:09:57] to glorify his name
[1:09:59] so Friday when I left work
[1:10:01] I came to home and directly went into
[1:10:03] prayers and I prayed and sent praise to
[1:10:05] her and I did the same thing she called
[1:10:07] me yesterday to pray for her daughter
[1:10:09] because the daughter is only one with a
[1:10:11] in the hospital in the ICU and said
[1:10:14] brother me and my daughter have
[1:10:15] testified in the hospital the mothers
[1:10:17] that the Lord is going to bring glory to
[1:10:19] his name and I know my grandbaby she's
[1:10:22] called Milagro gabin melako Miracle
[1:10:25] Gabriela Milagro Gabi he said Milagro
[1:10:28] Gabi who live amen because the daughter
[1:10:30] said
[1:10:31] the chance of living is very
[1:10:34] very slim
[1:10:36] but faith is overcomer
[1:10:39] so this morning no yesterday she sent
[1:10:41] another message brother he said when you
[1:10:42] pray for my daughter and my grandbaby
[1:10:44] the daughters were surprised
[1:10:47] he said there's a daughter that I
[1:10:48] ministered to
[1:10:49] he didn't believe that Lazarus
[1:10:51] Resurrected
[1:10:53] but he rather believed that Lazarus was
[1:10:54] directed into
[1:10:55] eternal life but not in this life
[1:10:57] there's no way somebody can die and come
[1:10:59] back to life
[1:11:00] and he's the daughter that gave my
[1:11:02] grandbaby a slim chance to live and she
[1:11:05] said oh for some reason
[1:11:07] things have turned around
[1:11:09] and she has gone so better
[1:11:11] and she's doing so great
[1:11:14] the Lord will shut the mouth of the
[1:11:16] unbeliever
[1:11:17] if you can start and believe
[1:11:19] amen
[1:11:24] life is in you amen
[1:11:26] I don't know where I got you
[1:11:28] I think I have 10 102 same thing I think
[1:11:31] I read okay let's see so it is as long
[1:11:34] as you have got okay I read it's got to
[1:11:36] it's got all the human elements all the
[1:11:39] scientific ideas all the days of Miracle
[1:11:41] is past so called all that he has not
[1:11:44] only that but Rod then from there grows
[1:11:47] the gem of life
[1:11:48] onto a new life that's the only way it
[1:11:51] can grow 103. that's the reason we don't
[1:11:53] get what we ask for we try to take with
[1:11:57] us so much of our own ideas
[1:11:59] and some of our own ideas will be some
[1:12:01] of the ideas that doctors told you
[1:12:03] you swallow it into your heart
[1:12:06] and when you swallow the life the death
[1:12:09] will germinate in you
[1:12:11] but when you swallow life into you life
[1:12:14] will germinate into you from you amen
[1:12:18] Glory Hallelujah what do you want to
[1:12:20] choose to gem to swallow
[1:12:23] do you want to swallow death or life
[1:12:26] you choose to swallow life amen because
[1:12:29] you are life itself
[1:12:31] Glory now let's go to bringing from the
[1:12:34] seed and the plant and come back to
[1:12:36] human beings amen
[1:12:38] come out to eternal life
[1:12:40] sometimes there's a saying that
[1:12:43] we raise our children in the church
[1:12:45] they grow
[1:12:46] and then they go to the world and live
[1:12:49] that they live live like the devil
[1:12:51] and then they come back broken
[1:12:55] why does it has to happen that way
[1:12:57] why will a son and a daughter that you
[1:12:59] raised and committed to the Lord Jesus
[1:13:01] Christ
[1:13:02] sit in the church as a young child
[1:13:04] then he or she gets to a certain age
[1:13:07] he or she decide that no the church is
[1:13:09] not for him Christ is not for him
[1:13:10] there's better better life out there go
[1:13:13] and live like the devil or go and live
[1:13:15] just as devil and then when he or she is
[1:13:18] broken turn to pieces now when he want
[1:13:21] to find Christ
[1:13:23] what can we do to prevent that
[1:13:26] let's look at the center of the issue
[1:13:28] amen so the children this is my message
[1:13:31] for you some of you want to become
[1:13:32] pastors
[1:13:34] Brother Joseph Alexander and uh some of
[1:13:37] you I remember your dream and I pray for
[1:13:40] you amen
[1:13:42] Brother Joseph want to be a pastor if I
[1:13:43] remember the name of his church is going
[1:13:45] to be holy ghost Tabernacle is that
[1:13:47] right but Alexander want to be a pastor
[1:13:49] and uh but uh Xavier want to be a deacon
[1:13:52] and he's just a
[1:13:54] you need to learn a little bit more
[1:13:56] about a Troy so they already identified
[1:13:59] their Ministries amen
[1:14:01] and we have to pray for them amen and
[1:14:04] our young sisters
[1:14:05] because the devil is not going to watch
[1:14:07] them
[1:14:08] grow just like that the Lord is going to
[1:14:10] contrast everything they said
[1:14:12] but the Lord has given us grace and
[1:14:14] mercy that when they have the Holy Ghost
[1:14:16] baptism that will be the solution to
[1:14:19] keep them out of the world to keep them
[1:14:21] in Christ and to keep Christ in them
[1:14:24] amen recently brother Jose and I went to
[1:14:27] minister somewhere Homestead right
[1:14:29] and they were fellowshipping with in a
[1:14:32] passenger side with a young man 18 year
[1:14:34] old
[1:14:35] is a very nice young man
[1:14:37] even in the in the house of the Lord
[1:14:39] he's a song leader something like that
[1:14:42] very nice young man you could see the
[1:14:44] Lord is with him so in the conversation
[1:14:46] I asked him brother
[1:14:47] are you born again do you have the new
[1:14:49] birth
[1:14:50] and begin to search through his mind
[1:14:53] he said
[1:14:54] I'm not sure and we're going to search
[1:14:56] it so I was just watching him he went to
[1:14:58] his heart he said no brother I don't
[1:15:00] have the Holy Ghost baptism
[1:15:02] say you need it
[1:15:04] that wouldn't make the difference you
[1:15:07] could be in the church
[1:15:08] and then everything is going good
[1:15:12] and a girl from high school
[1:15:14] or a boyfriend on the street or a
[1:15:16] neighbor will come and tell you I love
[1:15:18] you just one word
[1:15:20] and you begin to process it
[1:15:23] wow this handsome boy tells me he loves
[1:15:25] me this handsome lady tells me she loves
[1:15:27] me
[1:15:28] I don't remember the last time even my
[1:15:30] own dad tells me told me he loved me my
[1:15:32] mom I don't even she doesn't even know
[1:15:34] about love I don't even know wow
[1:15:37] and this boy tells you let's go to
[1:15:39] restaurant
[1:15:40] you go to the restaurant let's go to
[1:15:42] movie show you go and watch the movie
[1:15:44] together
[1:15:45] instead of praying now you go and watch
[1:15:47] a movie with with your boyfriend or
[1:15:49] girlfriend
[1:15:50] and the devil is moving you step by step
[1:15:53] you think it's innocent you are still in
[1:15:55] your innocency nothing has happened you
[1:15:58] just go watch a movie everything's okay
[1:15:59] you go to restaurant together all is
[1:16:01] well you go and watch a basketball

[1:16:12] out you go to him and invites you you
[1:16:15] know to his home you go to his home
[1:16:17] nothing happened the first day he's been
[1:16:19] nice with you but then he's moving
[1:16:21] closer
[1:16:22] he tried to touch you in a certain way
[1:16:24] and then one day before you realize your
[1:16:26] innocency is out
[1:16:28] he's gone through the window
[1:16:30] and then you've seen something that oh
[1:16:33] my then you keep on in that area
[1:16:35] and he misses your life you can't have
[1:16:38] your innocency back anymore
[1:16:40] God can forgive you you'll be redeemed
[1:16:43] you are a son and daughter of God but
[1:16:45] this guy has robbed you of your
[1:16:47] innocency
[1:16:48] but your parents did everything they
[1:16:50] could to raise you in church
[1:16:52] but you chose to jump the fence and go
[1:16:55] and see out there and a wolf a strong
[1:16:58] wolf at you up but what can we do to
[1:17:02] prevent our young Brothers our children
[1:17:04] being eaten up by wolves in the world
[1:17:07] and of course there's wolves amen demons
[1:17:11] tormenting spirit
[1:17:13] that will torment you if you let them be
[1:17:15] but if you are in Christ crisis in you
[1:17:18] they're under your foot under your feet
[1:17:20] you don't even worry about them amen
[1:17:22] they fear you you don't fear them
[1:17:25] if Christ is in you you don't fear
[1:17:27] demons no
[1:17:29] when you are working not you but the
[1:17:31] Christ in you dispel those demons amen
[1:17:35] and that's why we need Christ on the
[1:17:37] inside of us
[1:17:39] not on the outside not only in the
[1:17:42] pastor not only in the deacons not in my
[1:17:45] mother but as a son that said it's me
[1:17:48] it's me oh Lord I'm in need of prayer

[1:18:10] there's a time it's not your father your
[1:18:11] father has got his experience your
[1:18:13] pastor has his experience your ministers
[1:18:15] have the experience but you need your
[1:18:18] experience
[1:18:20] glory to the Lord let's go to the next
[1:18:22] uh slide
[1:18:27] now let's go to the center of the Holy
[1:18:29] Ghost baptism
[1:18:31] you're a human being
[1:18:33] can I use brother okay who is right but
[1:18:36] just want to write can I use you

[1:18:40] Brother Joseph he's getting so tall
[1:18:43] it's going so quick but Joseph is a
[1:18:45] human being
[1:18:47] it's made up of three parts three
[1:18:49] components make Brother Joseph
[1:18:51] is there flesh predictions Joseph that
[1:18:53] we see
[1:18:54] but then on the inside that you don't
[1:18:56] speak speaking to the microphone God
[1:18:58] bless you God bless you thank you amen
[1:19:00] now there's another part of him that is
[1:19:03] speaking it comes out of the flesh that
[1:19:06] is a spirit realm move your hand
[1:19:09] walk a little bit two steps
[1:19:11] now the movement the steps
[1:19:13] you see the flesh their foot their feet
[1:19:15] but they say being the spirit on the
[1:19:18] inside of Brother Joseph
[1:19:19] that was making those four steps they've
[1:19:22] been on the inside of Joseph that was
[1:19:24] that was the one who said God bless you
[1:19:27] you may take your cigar bless you now on
[1:19:29] the oh I'm not done one one minute now
[1:19:32] there's a third aspect of Brother Joseph
[1:19:35] that is on the inside of the inside that
[1:19:38] you don't see a speck of him
[1:19:40] he's the one who controls the show
[1:19:43] you see the flesh
[1:19:44] you see brother Joseph moving
[1:19:47] you you can sense his spirit because you
[1:19:49] can hear his voice again God bless you
[1:19:51] God bless you now there's a being who
[1:19:54] controls
[1:19:56] the spirit
[1:19:57] and the flesh
[1:19:59] and that being is called the soul God
[1:20:03] bless you
[1:20:04] now the soul is the center of every
[1:20:07] activity
[1:20:08] let them divert a little bit a bit you
[1:20:11] know there's a war between Ukraine and
[1:20:13] Russia
[1:20:14] that war started in the mind of only one
[1:20:16] person
[1:20:18] Vladimir Putin
[1:20:21] Spirit a dimension
[1:20:24] from the underworld from hell
[1:20:27] move in his mind
[1:20:29] that they wanted to take over Ukraine
[1:20:33] of course the West is part of it United
[1:20:36] States Europe uh whatever
[1:20:39] they are part of it NATO
[1:20:42] but then a spirit move into his mind
[1:20:45] and he sent warships around Ukraine
[1:20:48] the question putting what are you doing
[1:20:50] he said I'm just going to have military
[1:20:52] drill military exercise
[1:20:54] and different presidents leaders try to
[1:20:58] work with him let's sit down macron
[1:21:01] Biden all of them talk to him that hey
[1:21:05] this war is going to affect the whole
[1:21:06] world let's have a let's have a deal
[1:21:10] but as a spirit I remember one time
[1:21:12] after my roommate we said you are
[1:21:14] tormenting me he said macron was
[1:21:16] tormenting him with too much talk
[1:21:18] because he was going to do what he was
[1:21:19] going to do
[1:21:21] your talk is not going to change an iota
[1:21:23] of his mind
[1:21:25] he was ready to war where did that
[1:21:27] Spirit come from
[1:21:28] he came from hell
[1:21:30] it came from the mind of Satan and
[1:21:33] injected into only one person
[1:21:35] and send Ukraine and even his own people
[1:21:39] Russian mothers are sending their
[1:21:40] children away because he wanted to
[1:21:42] recruit 300 1 000 people and people are
[1:21:44] fleeing not only Ukraine but Russia as
[1:21:46] well the economy is what is flipped
[1:21:49] upside down
[1:21:51] the war started with one person
[1:21:54] the same thing the Holy Ghost can start
[1:21:57] in just one mind
[1:21:59] amen this church started in the mind of
[1:22:02] one person
[1:22:03] God injected their mind in brother Jack
[1:22:05] daf
[1:22:06] to start a church
[1:22:09] and out of the one mind we have said in
[1:22:11] true Tabernacle is that right
[1:22:14] eternal life started in a man of one
[1:22:15] person the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:22:17] out of one mind millions billions and
[1:22:21] trillions of God's sons and others over
[1:22:23] the generations were safe it started in
[1:22:26] a mind of Jesus Christ who gave his life
[1:22:28] unto mankind amen
[1:22:31] so now let's see they saw the control
[1:22:33] tower
[1:22:34] the soul is the motive or the nature of
[1:22:37] the spirit
[1:22:38] there were questions in 1959
[1:22:41] June 28th
[1:22:43] what is the difference between the Body
[1:22:45] Soul and Spirit also body spread and
[1:22:48] soul
[1:22:49] Ram said the body is the flesh that you
[1:22:52] look at
[1:22:53] that must rot
[1:22:55] it was born by sexual desire of father
[1:22:58] and mother it must rot it's not good
[1:23:01] and not always not acceptable by God
[1:23:03] you can't take this flesh the sixth
[1:23:05] Dimension no matter how much you can
[1:23:07] beautify this flesh give all the cream
[1:23:10] do the plastic surgery do face lift
[1:23:14] and you saw that whatever you tell me
[1:23:17] all the clothes that you want to wear
[1:23:18] you can wear sheepskin you can wear
[1:23:21] leopard skin you can wear elephant skin
[1:23:24] you can wear nylon you can wear cotton
[1:23:27] you can wear whatever you want you can
[1:23:30] wear polyester this body one day is
[1:23:33] going to drop
[1:23:35] to the Earth because he came from the
[1:23:37] earth and he's going to go back to the
[1:23:39] Earth
[1:23:40] but there's another body
[1:23:43] that didn't come from the Earth
[1:23:45] that came from the sixth dimension
[1:23:47] that is eternal that has no beginning
[1:23:50] that has no end
[1:23:52] that is a theophany
[1:23:54] Christ in flesh
[1:23:56] the wet body
[1:23:58] the logos
[1:24:00] that has no beginning that when this
[1:24:02] flesh drops he'll be right walking on
[1:24:05] and manifesting Through Time and
[1:24:08] Eternity that is the word body we want
[1:24:10] to talk about amen
[1:24:13] now he said this might as well therefore
[1:24:15] in the new birth
[1:24:16] in the resurrection subram is linking
[1:24:19] the new birth to the resurrection
[1:24:21] when you got a new birth you have
[1:24:23] Resurrected
[1:24:24] when Christ comes to you with the
[1:24:26] resurrection is Jesus Christ when you
[1:24:28] have him you have already resurrected
[1:24:30] you are not afraid of death you are not
[1:24:33] afraid of sickness because you are the
[1:24:35] resurrected Jesus Christ working on two
[1:24:37] on two feet amen therefore you are
[1:24:40] brought forth when you are brought forth
[1:24:42] again in a new body
[1:24:45] it will be God's creative power
[1:24:47] that will speak like he did to Adam and
[1:24:51] you come forth job said I have a desire
[1:24:54] he will speak and I'll answer see now
[1:24:57] the body is what you look at
[1:25:00] the spirit is what controls you your
[1:25:02] spirit is what controls you
[1:25:05] the body is holding the microphone but
[1:25:07] what really helps the body to hold the
[1:25:09] microphone is the human Spirit on the
[1:25:11] inside
[1:25:12] but then their boss
[1:25:14] is the soul and that's why we were
[1:25:16] trying to go to
[1:25:18] now your soul is the motive of that
[1:25:20] spirit
[1:25:22] or the nature of that spirit
[1:25:26] the soul that's in it that's who shall
[1:25:30] die
[1:25:31] you are born in the world with a sinful
[1:25:33] soul
[1:25:34] that is the nature of your spirit is
[1:25:36] sinful you long for the things of the
[1:25:39] world
[1:25:41] so that is the soul that God is working
[1:25:43] on
[1:25:43] they saw that our fathers and our mother
[1:25:45] Brothers fought
[1:25:46] that was to the sixth birth that was a
[1:25:49] civilization of Lucifer that wasn't from
[1:25:52] the Eternal man of God that came from
[1:25:54] the permissive will of God so that God
[1:25:57] will be a savior but that is not Eternal
[1:25:59] Mind Of God so it can never come back to
[1:26:02] the presence of God you can leave 990.
[1:26:06] Methuselah is it 9 69 somewhere Adam 930
[1:26:10] you're still gonna drop this flesh
[1:26:13] even Jesus Christ
[1:26:14] if he wasn't crucified at the age of 33
[1:26:17] and a half and he lived a natural life
[1:26:19] he would have grown and died someday
[1:26:22] because the order that
[1:26:25] eternity put this flesh is to live up to
[1:26:28] a certain time and die so that the other
[1:26:31] side of life will be manifested amen
[1:26:34] Glory Hallelujah to the Lord
[1:26:36] so then the Holy Ghost comes down and
[1:26:39] baptizes you and changes the nature of
[1:26:42] that spirit
[1:26:43] the Holy Ghost is a consuming fire
[1:26:46] it consumes the old nature the old soul
[1:26:49] that was the permissive person
[1:26:53] take like a drunkard someone who drinks
[1:26:56] and smokes to Tobacco womanizer manager
[1:27:01] who who does that
[1:27:03] you got the police will arrest you
[1:27:05] arrest the flesh for committing a crime
[1:27:08] but the real criminal is hiding on the
[1:27:11] inside that is the soul
[1:27:14] that want to rape children
[1:27:16] that is the soul that I want to murder
[1:27:18] innocent people because his nature is to
[1:27:21] murder
[1:27:22] the scriptures that the Satan came to
[1:27:24] what to steal to kill and to destroy
[1:27:28] and Jesus Christ came to do what came to
[1:27:31] give life and give it abundantly
[1:27:34] so any nature will bring forth its kind
[1:27:38] amen so now is that the nature that is
[1:27:41] then the Holy Ghost comes down and
[1:27:43] baptizes you and changes the nature of
[1:27:45] that Spirit then the nature that is left
[1:27:46] on you is of heaven then you profess
[1:27:49] that you are a pilgrim and a stranger
[1:27:51] then you are born again from above from
[1:27:54] Heaven you are from above you are a
[1:27:57] candidate of Heaven you're a new
[1:27:58] creature in Christ Jesus with the same
[1:28:01] body The Same Spirit
[1:28:03] only it's change
[1:28:06] your body doesn't
[1:28:07] it's rearranged
[1:28:09] the atoms are rearranged but Lord
[1:28:11] doesn't crush the body and create
[1:28:13] another brother Joseph
[1:28:15] but then God rearranged their body
[1:28:18] God cleansed the spirit
[1:28:20] but the soul is what changes is consumed
[1:28:22] out of you and the soul of God eternal
[1:28:25] life is now living in you and your
[1:28:28] thinking is not like before your
[1:28:31] thinking is Christ on the inside he
[1:28:33] talks you from your heart you if you've
[1:28:36] got the Holy Ghost you can identify God
[1:28:38] speak on the inside
[1:28:39] literal voice like somebody speaking I
[1:28:42] don't want to go into testimonies all of
[1:28:44] you know better but I keep us know what
[1:28:45] I'm talking about all of you the
[1:28:47] experience you know God will say this
[1:28:48] situation he will rise from the inside
[1:28:50] and speak to your mind that my daughter
[1:28:53] my son I'm in control be not afraid
[1:28:55] you're gonna be healed your sons and
[1:28:58] your other situation be you'll be okay
[1:28:59] amen because there's a being that is on
[1:29:02] the inside and he's the one we are
[1:29:04] talking about amen and when that be the
[1:29:07] Eternal person takes over everything
[1:29:08] changes Glory Hallelujah to the Lord he
[1:29:12] said that is your you are a nature of
[1:29:14] the hospital this change from
[1:29:15] unrighteousness to righteousness that is
[1:29:17] soul body and spirit let's go to the
[1:29:19] next one
[1:29:21] Glory Hallelujah to the Lord still on
[1:29:24] the soul
[1:29:26] blessed be the name of the Lord Souls
[1:29:28] that are in prison
[1:29:33] Souls that are in prison 63 1 1 10 11.
[1:29:37] sorry 1 1 10 and
[1:29:41] paragraph 35.
[1:29:43] Abraham is still explaining Souls so now
[1:29:45] this Soul imprisoned this now this
[1:29:48] Source him now in prison Souls that are
[1:29:50] now in prison 36 now the soul of a man
[1:29:53] is not a body of a man

[1:29:57] is dust potassium calcium Cosmic light
[1:30:01] sodium ion and water view that is not
[1:30:05] what is talking about the soul is
[1:30:07] another nature
[1:30:08] now the soul of a man is not the body of
[1:30:10] a man is the soul see and the soul is
[1:30:13] something that is the nature of the
[1:30:14] spirit
[1:30:16] and then when the nature of a man when
[1:30:18] he said we are dead the scripture
[1:30:20] plainly tells us that we are dead and
[1:30:22] our lives are hit in God through Christ
[1:30:25] still there by the Holy Spirit what is
[1:30:28] the Death part the old soul the soul
[1:30:31] that you came through your mother's
[1:30:32] birth that Soul has to die they sold
[1:30:36] that Senate it shall die amen and that
[1:30:39] scripture was from Ezekiel
[1:30:41] and Paul used the same scripture in
[1:30:43] Romans chapter 6 talking about the old
[1:30:45] husband and the new husband The Old Man
[1:30:48] and the new man who is the old man
[1:30:51] it's not an old man walking with a king
[1:30:53] no he's talking about Satan he came
[1:30:55] first through the sex birth then the new
[1:30:58] man is Christ Jesus the pillar of fire

[1:31:24] just like a husband wants to communicate
[1:31:26] with a wife
[1:31:27] sometimes when you get by yourself you
[1:31:29] see that Dimension as if somebody
[1:31:31] walking with you

[1:32:25] it was the nature of your spirit die
[1:32:27] that is to see the nature which is the
[1:32:30] soul

[1:32:32] is the death to the old soul and life to
[1:32:36] Christ in you amen
[1:32:40] why do we sit in church for many years
[1:32:44] without being born again
[1:32:47] and then we found out that we're not
[1:32:50] what we profess to be
[1:32:52] when you are here
[1:32:54] when you're under your parents when you
[1:32:56] are with someone with the Holy Ghost
[1:32:57] baptism
[1:32:58] because there's Christ on him
[1:33:00] her atmosphere his atmosphere will
[1:33:03] create an atmosphere which will not
[1:33:05] permit the also to act
[1:33:07] so as long as you come to church even if

[1:33:14] as long as you stay under your parents
[1:33:16] who have got the Holy Ghost baptism even

[1:34:30] you've never dressed improperly before
[1:34:32] your friends
[1:34:35] someone told me that selling women when
[1:34:36] they are starting to wear pants they
[1:34:39] struggle in their conscience
[1:34:40] because not part of them they struggle
[1:34:42] they want to wear their jeans they have
[1:34:44] to try and beat their conscience before
[1:34:46] finally they can sleep on their jeans
[1:34:48] because she was raised where she's used
[1:34:50] to wearing dresses covering herself but
[1:34:53] now she want to wear jeans
[1:34:55] for whatever reason
[1:34:57] weapons which belongs to men
[1:34:59] she has to kill a conscience to do that
[1:35:02] the first time you had sex with someone
[1:35:04] who's not your wife you have to kill
[1:35:06] your conscience because you know God
[1:35:08] didn't create you that way amen he
[1:35:10] created you to be a holy man and a holy
[1:35:12] woman amen until he gives your husband
[1:35:14] and your wife but then you have to beat
[1:35:16] your own conscience
[1:35:17] and do what God has nothing for you to
[1:35:19] do
[1:35:20] amen but if you can stay under the word
[1:35:23] of the Lord
[1:35:24] if you can subject yourself to the Holy
[1:35:26] Ghost to consume the old person the
[1:35:29] pillow fight will consume the old man
[1:35:31] and the purify himself will live in you
[1:35:34] and the life that will leave is no
[1:35:35] longer you but it's him that is living
[1:35:37] in you let men or the handsome men let

[1:36:03] Christ is on the inside
[1:36:04] but if Christ is not on the inside
[1:36:07] you're gonna succumb to that pressure
[1:36:10] amen Glory Hallelujah to the Lord
[1:36:14] he said now anything that begin has to
[1:36:16] end so there's only one way that you
[1:36:18] have to have eternal life is to have a
[1:36:20] life that never did begin
[1:36:22] and then your life did begin when you
[1:36:25] were born
[1:36:25] here on Earth
[1:36:27] but when God breathed the breath of life
[1:36:29] into your nostrils you became a living
[1:36:31] Soul then you begin amen now this
[1:36:35] natural life has a beginning
[1:36:37] but as eternal life which doesn't didn't
[1:36:40] begin
[1:36:41] that life is what is calling you my son
[1:36:44] my daughter
[1:36:46] this is not where you belong to
[1:36:48] you don't belong to fornication no
[1:36:51] you don't belong to drinking
[1:36:54] you don't belong to all this agendas of
[1:36:56] the world
[1:36:57] but you belong to Jesus Christ
[1:37:00] amen Glory Hallelujah
[1:37:04] I think invested same quotation have I
[1:37:08] I think I've done read this one so that
[1:37:11] I'm in prison let me go forward and see
[1:37:12] what I have the soul is the center of
[1:37:15] the new birth let me go back I don't
[1:37:17] know if I missed something
[1:37:22] I don't think I've read this one let's
[1:37:23] see the nature that was in you okay
[1:37:25] let's read this one uh yeah
[1:37:29] that nature that was in You by Nature
[1:37:31] was of the world
[1:37:33] that is the nature that you came through
[1:37:34] sex path
[1:37:36] you were actually an animal that's
[1:37:38] exactly right anyone knows that you were
[1:37:40] mammal
[1:37:41] how many knows that we are mammal we are
[1:37:44] warm-blooded animal but that's what we
[1:37:46] wear by our Earthly creation
[1:37:49] but you see what made us different from
[1:37:51] the other mammals that God put a soul
[1:37:53] upon you upon us now the other mamas
[1:37:56] don't have to wear clothes
[1:37:58] no other animals has to wear clothes to
[1:38:00] hide their shame his shame but us we are
[1:38:02] only ones that does because we have a
[1:38:05] soul
[1:38:05] but see God in the beginning knew what a
[1:38:08] man would be like and he created the
[1:38:10] Earth and brought up all kinds of
[1:38:12] animals from from the very lowest to the
[1:38:14] highest and the highest animal came
[1:38:16] forth was man
[1:38:19] 38 and then the first man was made he
[1:38:22] was a spirit man in the image of God
[1:38:24] which God is a spirit Saint John for now
[1:38:28] he's a spirit and then I worship Him
[1:38:30] worship Him in spirit and in truth
[1:38:33] and then and thy word is the truth now
[1:38:36] we worship Him in truth and in spirit he
[1:38:38] is a spirit being and so are you amen
[1:38:42] let's go to the next quote
[1:38:44] the soul is the center of the of the new
[1:38:46] birth
[1:38:49] the same code it's about God the soul is
[1:38:52] seeing that the soul is what God is
[1:38:53] working on see
[1:38:55] if you can only get a nature that Spirit
[1:38:58] to agree with him
[1:39:00] then the nature dies in other words the
[1:39:02] soul dies the nature and the love of the
[1:39:04] world dies
[1:39:05] and the things of the world is dead see
[1:39:08] because if you love the world
[1:39:10] which is the cosmos the things of the
[1:39:12] world and the love of God is not in you
[1:39:14] see and a man must be born again so this
[1:39:18] Nature has to die
[1:39:21] and the nature of God
[1:39:23] comes and lives in you
[1:39:26] and God is the only thing there is that
[1:39:30] never did begin or never can end 45 so
[1:39:34] therefore
[1:39:35] I love this part so much yes that's the
[1:39:38] way the marriage part comes in
[1:39:40] all is about death they also die the old
[1:39:44] nature die the love of the world dies
[1:39:46] but now there's going to be a wedding
[1:39:48] ceremony now
[1:39:49] partnership between a man and a woman to
[1:39:51] marry so verse 45 said now therefore he
[1:39:54] has partnership you see
[1:39:56] and thinking this man Earthly
[1:40:00] and this eternal spirit and put it
[1:40:02] together
[1:40:03] because he reflected himself back in
[1:40:05] that that he became a man when he became
[1:40:07] Christ Jesus he was God see God was in
[1:40:10] Christ that's he leaving him reconciling
[1:40:13] the world to himself and through that
[1:40:15] perfect man each one of us imperfect
[1:40:18] that believe in God and has accepted
[1:40:21] that becomes the Perfection of him amen
[1:40:25] now through the new birth
[1:40:29] through their marriage with the King
[1:40:31] or your imperfection
[1:40:33] has been stripped away and it became the
[1:40:35] Perfection of God himself
[1:40:37] amen remember the The Prostitute at
[1:40:40] Jericho what is the name
[1:40:42] rehab rehab with all her imperfections
[1:40:46] when he was married to a general a
[1:40:48] captain in the army of Joshua all her
[1:40:51] prostitution
[1:40:52] all her imperfections
[1:40:54] we're done away with we're annihilated
[1:40:57] and discarded and then she was now
[1:40:59] partnership joined to a new husband
[1:41:02] who was of Israel
[1:41:04] now greater than Joshua is here
[1:41:06] when you receive the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:41:09] you're gonna go through a divorce
[1:41:10] Supernatural divorce not just divorce
[1:41:13] but consumption amen the fire of God who
[1:41:16] consumed the old man the old soul the
[1:41:19] old nature the love of the world all the
[1:41:22] cases in you and then in Christ Jesus
[1:41:24] will be married to your flesh and it's a
[1:41:27] man from above
[1:41:29] peace of Heaven why do we say holy ghost
[1:41:31] ghost means spirit
[1:41:34] holy means is a Holy Spirit
[1:41:37] holy Christ
[1:41:38] holy husband and holy husband should
[1:41:41] have a wife who is Holy
[1:41:43] and your imperfection he will strip your
[1:41:45] imperfection from you transform you
[1:41:47] completely and make you a brand new

[1:42:27] you've not been born again and you
[1:42:29] desire then young preachers the young
[1:42:31] sisters if you want to receive your

[1:42:36] it to you
[1:42:37] and I want you to be on your heart that
[1:42:41] I need to be born again
[1:42:43] amen because without the new birth you
[1:42:47] might have all the talk but you can't
[1:42:49] walk the walk
[1:42:51] the new board is what will work that
[1:42:52] work for you
[1:42:54] a lot of people have certain ambitions
[1:42:57] ambition to serve the Lord
[1:42:59] and you can love the Lord in your flesh
[1:43:02] you can love in your spirit but if the
[1:43:04] old man is there he's going to love he
[1:43:06] doesn't know what he's talking about she
[1:43:08] doesn't know when the right time comes

[1:44:06] it's only hidden it's only sugar coated
[1:44:10] it's like sometimes when they give sugar
[1:44:12] coated medicine to children because
[1:44:13] children don't like the bitter and sour
[1:44:15] State sour taste so they are sugar a lot
[1:44:17] of sugar but the medicine is hiding on
[1:44:20] the inside and they don't taste in their
[1:44:22] mouth but when it drops into their
[1:44:24] system they begin to work

[1:49:52] 01 M token 882 paragraph and now how
[1:49:56] could they be I like the way around
[1:49:58] paraphrases with a question how could
[1:50:00] they be a more perfect sacrifice than
[1:50:01] God himself becoming the atonement
[1:50:03] himself
[1:50:05] when God was made flesh in his own
[1:50:07] creative blood that only way that a life
[1:50:09] of God can come back 83 because all of
[1:50:12] us were born by sex
[1:50:14] and therefore the life that in there is
[1:50:16] of the world it's all the world is not
[1:50:19] talking about the moon and the star it's
[1:50:21] of Satan the cosmos the world order and
[1:50:24] that life will not stand is the LIE is
[1:50:26] the thing is the thing that is already
[1:50:28] judged and condemned you can't Patch It
[1:50:30] Up there's no way to patch it up there's
[1:50:33] no way to smooth it out there's no way
[1:50:35] to make it better it's got to die
[1:50:39] that's the only requirement there is
[1:50:41] it's got to die they also the old nature
[1:50:46] of the spirit has to what die
[1:50:49] and Christ has World Born Into You and I
[1:50:53] want the young people to keep this verse
[1:50:55] in your notebooks that my old man my old
[1:50:59] woman in me has to die
[1:51:02] and the only one that can kill it is the
[1:51:05] Holy Ghost Christ himself and so your
[1:51:07] prayers should change Lord I need the
[1:51:10] Holy Ghost baptism Brother Joseph
[1:51:17] and all of you amen and all of us amen
[1:51:20] we need to we need to die that Christ
[1:51:23] can live on in US
[1:51:25] Glory
[1:51:26] he said there's only there's no way
[1:51:28] better he's got to die this that's the
[1:51:30] only requirement there is is God to die
[1:51:32] 84 and the substitute
[1:51:35] a life of Jesus Christ has to come into
[1:51:38] you which is the Holy Ghost God's
[1:51:41] talking that you have accepted the blood
[1:51:44] of his son Jesus Christ amen that is
[1:51:48] what God is waiting on you
[1:51:51] will you accept this talking
[1:51:53] amen and I want all the young people
[1:51:56] amen I want every one of you
[1:51:59] to declare that you live for the Lord
[1:52:01] amen sister Linda
[1:52:04] hi
[1:52:08] all my life
[1:52:13] I
[1:52:15] am Sister Abigail
[1:52:33] all my life
[1:52:45] but by faith we cover all the young
[1:52:47] people even those who are not born those
[1:52:49] who are in the womb amen
[1:52:51] there's a supernatural God who does
[1:52:53] Supernatural things there's nothing that
[1:52:56] is difficult for the Lord and as young
[1:52:59] people I want you to keep this day in
[1:53:00] your heart
[1:53:01] this message was just for you
[1:53:04] it's a blessing to everybody else but
[1:53:06] it's just for you the young people
[1:53:08] that I begin to ask yourself
[1:53:10] am I Born Again sister happy girls
[1:53:13] traditionalinda
[1:53:15] you begin to ask yourself
[1:53:20] ask yourself what is the Holy Ghost
[1:53:22] baptism
[1:53:23] how can I be born again
[1:53:25] you begin to talk to your parents
[1:53:27] talk to your pastor
[1:53:29] there was a time that Mary and Joseph
[1:53:31] were with Jesus they went for a feast
[1:53:34] and when they were returning
[1:53:36] they were not they thought they assumed
[1:53:38] because they were people they used to go
[1:53:39] by carriage and horses and family
[1:53:42] clients walking around maybe hundreds of
[1:53:44] people so they assumed that the young
[1:53:47] Jesus was with them
[1:53:48] but they went I don't know how many my
[1:53:50] this journey and the three days
[1:53:53] they realized that where is Jesus
[1:53:56] Jesus where's Jesus he wasn't there and
[1:54:00] after what walk three days journey back
[1:54:02] to get Jesus and sometimes you can grow
[1:54:05] in the church going and coming even
[1:54:07] having positions in the church
[1:54:09] being a preacher doesn't make you a holy
[1:54:11] ghost for son I can preach and soul be
[1:54:14] damned I can preach and still be devoid
[1:54:16] of the Holy Ghost
[1:54:19] but you have to come to a realization
[1:54:23] that one day
[1:54:26] an old man can die
[1:54:28] old woman can die
[1:54:29] a child can die a movie it can die this
[1:54:33] life that you have just like the life of
[1:54:35] the avocado
[1:54:37] came from somewhere
[1:54:39] this physical avocado the leaf is a
[1:54:41] representation
[1:54:43] this avocado has got the green plant
[1:54:45] green leaf
[1:54:47] but one day
[1:54:49] is going to weather
[1:54:51] and die
[1:54:53] it might also die when it's Young
[1:54:55] and when you're done where are you going
[1:54:56] to
[1:54:57] what account are you going to give to
[1:54:58] the Lord
[1:55:00] everything that you did is going to be
[1:55:02] recorded
[1:55:04] when you get a certain age let's say
[1:55:06] like Alexander Brother Joseph God put a
[1:55:08] record on you if you're going to tell
[1:55:10] lies
[1:55:11] it's rather recorded it's on your
[1:55:14] conscience
[1:55:15] and when you die without the Holy Ghost
[1:55:17] God will show you that video clip
[1:55:25] that he gave you the chance
[1:55:27] to give your life to him
[1:55:29] he sent a preacher to preach to you he
[1:55:31] sends someone to pass a track to you
[1:55:33] he gave you a mother who is a Godly
[1:55:35] mother to teach you the word he gave you
[1:55:38] a Godly pastor he raised a church for
