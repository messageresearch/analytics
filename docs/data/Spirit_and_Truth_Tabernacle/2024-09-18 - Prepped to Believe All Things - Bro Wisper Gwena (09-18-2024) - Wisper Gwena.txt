you in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen as brother Jack said I came in on Monday and uh just passing through amen so thought it'll be good to come thank you sir and uh just greet you amen and as preachers we only have one way to greet and that is to stand behind the pulpit amen and then uh we greet you amen praise the Lord um I know we don't have too much time so we just going to get straight into the word Mark chapter 10 um hope we going to do this in time Mark chap 10: 27 the scripture says and Jesus looking upon them saith with men it is impossible but not with God for With God all things it are possible I like that and then in the Book of Luke chapter 1 starting from verse 36 it says and behold thy cousin Elizabeth sheath conceived a son in a old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called baren for with God nothing shall be impossible and Mary said behold the handmade of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word and the angel departed from her may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word we may be seated amen as we pray again father we thank you for the word we have read now your word we ask that you can give the unction in Jesus Christ's name amen amen I want to take um a title and I want to speak on prep to believe all things amen I trust that it will make some sense now that word prep comes from preparation when you go through a preparation process then we say you have been prepped all right isn't it yes sir and the inspiration comes from this quotation which is in the message preparation the prophet of God says you believe is the preparation time yes sir how many believe it's the preparation time it says notice it says don't notice don't notice your Edge don't notice the circumstances Faith Knows No ede Limit or circumstances Faith knows one thing God said so and that settles it where is our sister that plays the piano let us bow our heads a minute the great physician sister something come on my um heart then then the prophet says he begins to pray our heavenly father I thank thee tonight because we are leaving in the hour of preparation amen we are leaving when you are preparing the people to believe all things we believe that's the message of the day right the preparation time amen Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and you are calling a people have give them the Holy Ghost and now you're trying to call out of that group of sons to adopt them amen amen now that's quite a striking statement yes sir we are leaving when you are preparing the people to believe all things amen we believe that's the message of the day the preparation time when I heard that listening to that seron it struck me glory and the prophet says here we are leaving at that time where we are being prepared to believe all things amen amen and that's the message of our day the preparation time amen Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen so it means that the message that we have in this day it is a message of preparation amen amen and it is preparing in us to believe all things amen sir Al as I say that's striking yes sir because you would think that the message of the hour is there to prepare us for the coming of the Lord all right and that's what will be palatable with us if we hear that the message is preparing us for the coming of the Lord it works right but when you say we are being prepared to believe all things and that's the message of the hour amen now that's striking amen we we know yes we are waiting for the second coming of the Lord amen and uh we we would be prepared for the coming of the Lord but in this quotation he's not talking just about that but he's saying that we are being prepared to believe all things yes sir now why are we being prepared to believe all things I believe the reason is because when it comes to this day there is a special requirement that God is looking for in a Believer he says in the Book of Luke chapter 18 nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth amen so we're not just being called to believe Jesus Christ we're not just being called for salvation we're not just being called you know to receive Christ and receive the Holy Ghost but they supposed to be a particular faith that comes in the end time Believers that is different from the ones that paor and them went through Glory why is it so because in our day we are required to have a rapturing Faith right amen that's right never before has there been a call for a Rapture right amen 1 Corinthians chapter 15 Paul speaking he says behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed now that was a scripture that was not for their day that was a scripture that is for our day Hallelujah in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed and as I say this is a requirement that was there only for this age it is only for the end time believer down Through the Ages amen all they were required to do was to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ to believe on the resurrection to get themselves ready amen receive the Holy Ghost yes but they were all going by the way of death all right so they never had a requirement for a rapturing faith but now when it comes to this age we are required to have a rapturing faith and I want to believe that that rapturing faith it takes a believing in all things amen think about it that down Through the Ages people have struggled to believe even in the resurrection in the days of Paul you hear Paul saying that if some say that there is no Resurrection then we are found Liars so they were struggling with just the issue of Resurrection exactly right let alone with the issue of a Rapture right now in this day amen we are supposed to believe all things even unto the requirement of a Rapture yes amen we are not only just supposed to die come on but in a moment in the twinkling of an eye we supposed to be changed what a faith that is required in this day a faith that is able Amen to get this mortality to be consumed in immortality Hallelujah in a moment in a twinkling of an eye we shall be changed yes what a requirement of a faith that is now God knowing that we have such a challenge then God it's his duty to prepare us amen he then sends us a message of preparation and that preparation is for us to believe all things you see when God a man is demanding something that looks impossible then it is his duty to prepare the people and we can find that that is the pattern of God down through the Bible wherever God has something that looks impossible he just doesn't demand The Impossible but he prepares the people to be able to attain that impossibility that's why he says in the Book of Amos chapter 3 surely the Lord God will do nothing but he reveal his Secrets unto his servants the prophets he just doesn't come but he prepares the people that's a preparatory message is that right we also find it in Malachi chapter 3 behold I send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me why was John the Baptist coming he was coming with a preparatory message to prep the people for the first coming of the Lord Jesus Christ so we can find that this is God's pattern whenever he's about to do something he prepares the people amen now that brings me to the story of Mary that I read here and I find that story quite amazing all right because in there I find a preparation and that is where my inspiration is centered on tonight Hallelujah and somebody say so where is this preparation in the story of Mary you see the story of Mary and the story of Zachariah it is quite an amazing story in the Bible all right we find in the Book of Luke chapter 1 the Bible says but the angel said unto him this was speaking to Zacharias fear not Zacharias for thy prayer is heard and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name John and Zachariah said unto the angel whereby shall I know this for I an old man and my wife well stricken in years all right now I want you to watch the scripture here he says fear not Zacharias for thy prayer is heard Amen in other words Zachariah was praying for a child they had been waiting for a child now they were old and well stricken in age amen but they were waiting for a child they were preparing they were praying for a child down through their marriage life they were expecting to have a child is that right that was their prayer right there and then the angel comes and he says Zachariah said unto and and he says Zacharias and Zachariah said unto the angel whereby shall I know this oh my so now the angel has said you are going to have this child and then Zachariah says how shall I know this seeing I'm now an old man and my wife is well stricken in Edge then we jump to verse 20 and verse 20 says and behold Thou shalt be dumb and not able to speak until the day that these things shall be be shall be performed because thou believest not my words which shall be fulfilled in their season yes L that's quite amazing right there here is a man that was praying about this baby and the angel comes and he says your prayer has been heard the answer has now been has now been dispatched and right there Zariah then ask a question how shall I know these things wow wow and then Gabriel says because you have doubted my word we shall zip your mouth you will not be able to speak why because he should have sensed that there is a doubt that is behind this man he was asking a question but the question that was being asked was actually a question that was in doubt that's right amen and the angel say to Gabriel because of your doubt we don't want you to go preaching your doubt to your wife and Elizabeth will end up doubting what she's supposed to conceive so to stop that we're going to zip your mouth otherwise you preach the wrong things yes yes and you cause unbelief in the Family Faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word but unbelief also comes by hearing hearing the wrong type of a Preacher so God says we're not going to allow you to go preach the wrong things here and his mouth was zipped that's right but let's turn over and go to to to to to Mary's situation and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a seity of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin exposed to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and behold verse number 31 and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus verse 34 then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man now I want you to look at this too Zachariah asks a question and he told you shall be dumb Mary asks a question and instead of being told you shall be dumb the question is answered but both of them are asking a question God help us here Zachariah had been praying about this right but Mary was not praying about this that's right that's right I believe she was just living a holy life yes but Zachariah a man who was praying about this it shows that Zachariah was actually praying in doubt so you can be praying for something but yet you are praying in doubt that you're not even ready to receive the answer when it comes and when the answer then is delivered Zachariah begins to doubt the very answer and God's word is a deser of the thoughts and the intents of the heart and that is what was pronounced on Zechariah because of that doubt then God says your mouth shall be zipped but Mary asks a question and the question is not being asked in doubt amen amen amen God sees that this is a question that is being asked out of a genuine heart that is looking for clarity amen and then Gabriel gives the clarity vers ver number 35 and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God Amen so an answer is given praise be to God and when the answer is given it is not only an answer but it is giv true Clarity unto Mary now I want you to watch with Mary what was being requested to do had never been done before exactly right never before had a virgin conceived that's right never before a man was a child born out of a virion right amen so because God is asking for something that has never been done he asking for the impossibility it is God's duty to prepare Mary Glory even in accordance to Amos chapter 3:7 God has to prepare that's right but when it comes to Zechariah Zechariah there were scriptural precedents of his case right there had been old people that had received children in the old days there was an Abraham and a Sarah they received a child in their old age there were people that were Barren that had received children there was a Rebecca there was a Rachel there was a Hana many other people that were in the olden days that had received children so with zachariah's case it was there in the Bible that's right but when it comes to case never before had it ever happened that somebody amen would be required to have a child when she's a virgin are you following me and because of that God had a duty to prepare Mary amen because it's a situation impossible so now we've got to get into the preparation how is Mary going to be prepared it's in the conversation praise God let's take it to verse 36 all right now verse 36 then says and behold thy cousin Elizabeth yes she had also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with ha who was called baren all right for with God nothing shall be impossible and Mary said behold the handmade of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word and the angel departed from her right there I see a preparation and somebody says where is the preparation Preacher Man can we dissect the verse here yes sir yes sir look at what the scripture says the scripture says and behold thy cousin Elizabeth so the person that had a miracle that had been done was not just a sister but this was a sister who was a cousin to Mary so in other words when God wanted somebody Amen to to to conceive and bring forth this John it could not be any ordinary sister that was in Israel it not could be anyone that was not connected with Mary it had to be somebody that was a cousin of Mary yes so the situation of Elizabeth was a family story right everyone in the family they knew of the situation of Elizabeth they knew that this couple's Zachariah and Elizabeth who were priests in the temple who were living a faithful life who had done all they could but yet they had not had a child they' been praying about this and now they were old and well stricken in age and somehow in the family they should have written off that case but Zachariah continued to pray amen even in his old age though he was now doubting his own prayer but somehow it should have become a talk of the village It Should Have Become a talk of the family until everyone was talking about the case of Zachariah and Elizabeth to say how can an old man continue to believe in this how can this sister continue to believe this the situation was was well known within the family now God chooses somebody that is known within the family and that is the person and the candidate that God chooses to bring forth a John and then now the angel comes to Mary and says the Holy Ghost shall overshadow you situation impossible but before you begin to doubt let me prepare you and how am I going to prepare you let me tell you the news of what has happened already let me give you the testimony of sister Elizabeth and he says your cousin Elizabeth who was called Baron who the family has talked about that very one right now she has deed they were trying to hide the pregnant they did not want it known within the family but the angel came and disclosed the secret and he say something has happened in the house of Zachariah Hallelujah Mary should have been startled right there and Mary should have been saying what you mean Elizabeth my cousin the wife of Zachariah and Gabriel should have said that very one you mean to tell me that she is conceived yes is actually conceived now what you are saying to me is also an impossible situation but if God can do it for Elizabeth Hallelujah if God can do it for Elizabeth then the very same God he can do it for me as well and immediately the faith of Mary was boosted from zero and it hit 100% Mary was prad on the spot and watched the very next word that came out of the mouth of Mary Mary then said be it unto me according to Thy word I'm ready to believe it if it can happen to Elizabeth it can happen to me as well if the god of the impossibility can visit Zachariah oh Hallelujah he can surely visit me as well so Beed unto me according to Thy word hallelujah are you hearing this church are you hearing this church so let me say right here that Elizabeth was kept by God baren as an instrument to prepare [Applause] Mary oh did you hear what I said I said Elizabeth was kept Barren by God hallelujah so that she could be the vessel through which Mary would be prepared down Through the Ages they were praying a God was just in silent seeming as though he's not hearing the prayer because God knew I'm keeping Elizabeth to prepare a Mary Oh Glory to God in the eyes let me say God can allow you to go through a situation so that it can prepare you for something greater God can allow you to go through a situation so that he can prepare your sister's testimony so he can prepare a Brother's testimony are you hearing this church Mary Hallelujah God used Elizabeth to prepare Mary so that Mary would have the faith to be able to receive that which was supposed to come your way glory to God in the highest Hallelujah so Mary was prepared through the situation of Elizabeth but I look at Zachariah Zachariah God never gave him an on an ons spot preparation why because I believe that God wanted Zachariah to be prepared through the scriptures and the the me the messages that were being preached that's right that's right there was too much evidence that was behind if Zechariah was a student of the Bible you should have believed the word but with Mary this had never happened and because it had never happened Mary had to receive something that was special amen amen amen so God had to prepare Mary because her situation was impossible but not only that I also believe that Mary was special amen like I said Zachariah was praying about his situation right but Mary was not even praying that's exactly right she was just going on living a holy life doing what she's supposed to do every day she wasn't even thinking about the promise amen until maybe the very last days glory to God praise the Lord because the prophet of God says as they were walking with Joseph that's when they started to talk about it and they started referring to the scripture of Isaiah and he says if you want something to happen then begin to talk about it Hallelujah so they were now talking about it at the appointed time but you see over their life Mary never expected I believe that she was the chosen virgin Amen brother that's right there was nothing that was pointing to her that's right but what is it a am man that God God to come to Mary it was predestination she was the one that was predestinated of God to be able to bring that child am oh glory be to God and why was Mary the chosen one because she was favored amen of the Lord amen nothing else that we can talk about she was favored of the Lord until the scripture says and the angel came in unto him and say hail Mary Thou Art highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women that's right there was no any other answer it was predestination it was the favor of God and because Mary was favored of God praise the Lord in the highest God could not allow Mary to fail with Zachariah God could allow Zachariah to fail but not with Mary Mary was special Mary was predestinated Mary had the favor of God and because she was she was predestinated and at the favor of God it was God's responsibility to make sure that Mary does not fail and somebody says but why it is just because of favor and you know there is something about favor favor ain't Fair it ain't Fair but praise God I'm on the side of the favor praise God you are the favored Hallelujah others might cry foul others might say it's not fair it's not fair okay it is not fair but praise God I have the favor of God hallelujah so Mary was favored but brother Mary he begins to tell me of Another Woman She's a type of another woman that is the bride of Jesus Christ in this day I'm looking at here tonight and I want to say Hail Bride of Jesus Thou Art favored among all women oh Hail Bride of Jesus Christ Thou Art highly favored oh do you believe it tonight do you believe it tonight the favor of God is with you why are you here tonight the Holy Ghost LED you here because God had a message for you and the message for you to tonight is you are the favor of the Lord favor ain't fair and because you are the favor of the Lord then God sends a message to prepare you to believe all things you are predestinated not to fail it is God's responsibility to make sure that you will not fail and I'm here to announce to you that this bride will not fail this bride is going to make it into the rapture whether the devil likes it or he does not like it but we're going to make it into the Rapture because it's not even our own making it is God's choosing can you say Amen we going to make it into the Rapture for with God the scripture says with God nothing shall be impossible I'm on Luke 137 Hallelujah for with God nothing shall be impossible amen how many believe it tonight glory to God in the highest brother when Mary heard these words that with God nothing shall be impossible as a student of the word scriptures should have started to run through Mary's mind connecting one verse to another and Mary should have started to think of another character Abraham and Sarah and he says with Abraham and Sarah God waited amen until there were 75 and 65 years to give them the promise and then after giving them the promise God then had to wait again for another 24 years before he came to visit them amen and then 25 years for them to receive the child but the scripture says amen is anything too hard for the Lord Mary should have started thinking about all these things to say if God could come to Father Abraham father Abraham he had to receive a preparation right think about a church God had called him to do the impossible yes to receive a child at an old age that's right 99 years when they were well stricken in age yes you know there are others that don't believe that these people's bodies were turned into young young children but if you think about it the scripture actually says they were well stricken in age that's right that's right amen that's right so what happened there should have been a change of a body somewhere praise God in the high God Amen he had to take that Father Abraham through that period And when God took Father Abraham through that period what why was God taking him through all that I believe it was because God was training Abraham to believe all things let me say tonight that the things that you go through in your life life it is maybe that God is training you to believe all things am amen got to have some rapturing Faith before the Rapture comes you see if you're going to do something amen there's got to be a preparation before you get to that which you are supposed to do Hallelujah there's a training period that everyone has to go through think of these Olympia we've just come out of the Olympics isn't it yes sir they take years and years preparing in 4 years amen they've just come back now they are starting to prepare for the next Olympics in 4 years every day they are training and think about these guys that Run 100 m they train four years for an event that is less than 10 seconds that's right I reminds me of the Bride of Jesus Christ God is preparing us all these years for an event that will happen in a moment in the twinkling of an eye Oh Glory to God but we got to be prepared for that event so it's worth all the training it's worth all the suffering it's worth everything that we got to go through Hallelujah because when we shall make it into the Rapture it shall all be well for these Olympians amen when they put on the gold medal and is hanging on their necks they say it was worth it I feel I can do it again but brother they are doing it to obtain a medal of this Earth but you and I we are doing it to step into the Rapture to get into eternal life is it not worth coming to church on a Wednesday is it not worth coming to church every Sunday is it not worth listening to tape after tape is it not worth praying every day of the hour why it's a preparatory me message we need it Church Hallelujah so Abraham amen he had to go through this training and God came and he said is anything too hard for the Lord so now when God had prepared Abraham Hallelujah he now came to a place where he realized that all things amen are possible with God Mark chapter 10 tells me Jesus looking upon them say with man it is impossible but not with God for With God all things are possible and that's exactly the same words that he said to Father Abraham amen with with is anything too hard for the Lord and then in Mark 10 it says With God all things are possible God hallelujah amen the prophet of God says you believe is the preparation time don't you notice your he says don't notice don't notice your age don't notice the circumstances Faith knows no age limit or circumstances amen you know time is always our greatest problem I've been waiting for this I've been waiting for this I've been praying for this I've been praying for this wait they that wait upon the Lord hallu they shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as Eagles Abraham had to wait for 25 years but after waiting for 25 years brother the journey was sweet when it now came to the victory time prise God it is always when you get to your victory that is where you now realize the sweetness of what you have had to go through with Abraham amen after that remember now he's walking in a new body as a young man looking at a beautiful young woman 90 years old but looking like 21 now you talk about somebody that can believe all things there's just no way for Abraham after the body change to doubt anything that's right that's right that's right it's impossible because if he looks at Sarah and he thinks about what Sarah was two years ago and is looking at the miracle of God just that Miracle alone it is good enough to say if God demands anything of me I'm ready to accept it he can do it praise God hallelujah that's why when he was now going to sacrifice Isaac when God said to him go take your son Isaac your only son and go and sacrifice he didn't have a problem with it why did he not have a problem with it because he knew that God can do anything he had been preed to to believe all things amen so Abraham is asked by the young man he says to the young man as is now going up the mountain he says abide ye here with the US I and the Lord will go Y and worship and come again to you how do you know you're coming back I've been preped to believe all things my God is able to do anything oh glory to God in the highest brother when God has prepared you when God has taken you through certain situations you get to a place where you know that I can believe all things it says if God says slay your son he that gave me that son in my old age is more than able to resurrect that son if he ask me to take him and sacrifice him I know he can replace the son in an instant so though I can kill him but before I leave the mountain he would have resurrected him and I'll take him with me how do you know it is going to happen With God all things are possible or I don't know whom I'm preaching to tonight you might be going through a situation that looks impossible but you are being trained to believe in the impossibilities that all things are possible when you go through that trial Oh Glory you will now have a faith muscle that can face anything in your life with Abraham he was well prepared Hallelujah Genesis chapter 22 and Isaac SP unto Abraham his father and he says my father and he says here am I my son and he said behold the fire and the hood but where is the lamp for a bent offering and Abraham said my son God will provide himself a lamb for a band offering when you getting these words from Father Abraham I've been prepared to believe all things God can provide he will provide himself a sacrifice Hallelujah I don't know whom I'm preaching to tonight but I want to say that same Jehovah gy he's still here he can provide anything whatever your hearts desire it is not too deep for God to be a not to be able to touch it it is within his reach can you say Amen somebody hallelujah hallelujah God is more than able the prophet of God says it was a real Ram that then God Abraham saw caught in that Thicket where did it come from Jehovah gy had provided that Ram God spoke it into existence in one minute and it went out of existence in another minute for God is able to do anything that he desires to do I believe that our God is able to do anything praise God hallelujah conscious of our time we got to jump some things here but let me come to our day you see down through the Bible we see that there were certain things that were happening God preparing a people now we have read this quotation where the prophet of God says we are leaving when you are preparing the people to believe all things yes yes we believe that's the message of the day the preparation time Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever so this message is about a preparation yes sir and that's why this message came packed with the supernatural that's exactly right Hallelujah why did it have such a supernatural element so that we when we begin to hear that message remember Mary was prepared when she heard the miracle that happened to Elizabeth now with everything that we have heard in the message amen Faith cometh by hearing Romans chapter 10 hearing by the word and as we are hearing that word it is preparing us hallelujah to be able to believe all things and let me say God is not a respector of persons if he has done it for somebody he can do it for you as well Hallelujah what God has done before he can repeat the same thing amen so the things that you hear they are supposed to prepare you they are supposed Amen to push your faith to say if God has done it in the past where is that God glory that is like Gideon isn't it Gideon amen he had been hearing the word the word was preached to Gideon according to the Book of Judges chapter 6 one until amen when Gideon was now threshing we amen by when he was threshing Wheat by a wine press the angel came to him and when the angel came to him he says Thou Mighty Men of hell and Gideon started to ask and he says if God be with us then where Behold The Miracles that our fathers told us of Amen we have heard through the preaching of the word but where is that God is he a god of History he's got to be a living God Amen oh glory be to God he says where is that God of the Miracles brother when we hear what we hear on tap we must get to a place where we ask where is the god of brother Bram where is the god of the message of the hour I just don't want to believe in a message I want to see the effects of that message I don't want to believe in a God that ended in the spoken word I want the spoken word to become flesh in my day I want to see that very same God yes sir I don't want to leave on a second-handed Rob I want my own testimony we are living in a day where we have been prepared to believe all things yes the testimonies that come with this message they are just too much that's right brother I think of the testimony of geata bed reading for 9 years until she was reduced to just almost a skeleton on now but when she was in that state she came across some on William Branham and she said I want this man to pray for me amen and she had such a desire until the mother said she had gone hysterical and they said it is because of that man but praise be to God when when faith is reaching out there is a God that is ready to answer GL until the prophet in a vision he saw a lamb bleeding M Town M Town and then he knew I'm supposed to go to M toown when he went there then God led him to the house of Joi Cara he says God is going to heal Joi Cara says it's a situation impossible but God had visited that family the mother of joik was yet an unbeliever that's right he says that man is an impostor he's the one that has got my daughter to be in the situation that she is in I don't want to see that man but when she was in that state God knew that this woman must be predestinated for the miracle because when she was in that state then she saw a vision that's right God preparing her and what was the vision it was of brother Bram coming walking by Hallelujah and no sooner than the vision it ended then brother Bram walks past am exactly the man that she had seen and he steps into the building praise for little joat and little joat Rises up out of that bird Hallelujah and the prophet says there is no way I would have said to her rise up knowing that your legs were this thin there was no way that those legs could carry a body but brother when God visits it does not matter what the condition is it does not matter what the state is Joi rose up and she went outside and started blessing the grass that's the message of the hour I think of brother oh who the doctor had says he's going to jump overboard in 3 days but when the vision came to the prophet the prophet of God says that man is going to leave and he called s there and he says hey that man that you said is going to jump over go board in three days he's going to leave glory and the doctor man says I would love to see that one how can it be he cannot leave without a lever wow and we can't replace the lever yeah and the prophet of God says you shall see it and he shall come and testify one day when the prophet was preaching then he says you see I was speaking about brother Hall and I see him somewhere at the back there do you want to testify brother Hall and he rises up from the back and he says Hey doctor the man that you said you want to see can you see him made the back there that's the god of the message of the hour [Applause] can you say Amen we know the story when he went to Finland that boy that had been mashed and dead and the prophet of God says if this boy is not willing up in three in five minutes then run me out of this place as a false prophet he went and he laid his hands on that boy and the boy came back to life on the spot that's the message of the hour why is it ped with the supernatural it is so that you and I can believe in the Supernatural so that you and I can believe in the impossibilities Oh Glory to God but whilst he was in Finland there was a case of another girl I like to read this one come on as we are winding up to close here I like to read this one and I want you to read your name into this quotation this little girl am man she was an orphan and the prophet of God says and I found out she was a little orful a little war often her father and mother was killed in the Russian war and looking at her I said oh sweetheart God bless your little heart I said you are healed but she couldn't understand what I was saying I know God would respect Faith like that I said you are healed honey and then them soldiers kept pushing me on you see the prophet was walking to go to the pulpit and as he was walking because it was city blocks amen blocked with people so he couldn't get right next to where he was supposed to be so he had to walk through these passages and then come through the L's toilets the doors were closed but as he was passing through then this little girl with her crashes then walks out of the room and comes to brother Branham and then brother Branham says I couldn't just help it I had to attend to that little girl and he says I love little children and then when he spoke to that girl he said little girl you are healed that's right amen but then she couldn't understand what the prophet was saying and remember she one leg that was shorter than the other so she was putting on a breast and then brother Branham went right straight to the pull pit left that girl but he had a burden in his heart to say I wish that girl could realize then the prayer line was going on and brother Bram was now getting tired but before he completely went out then something took place and the girl walked through and then brother Branham say to The Interpreter I want you to repeat these words after me just speak speak as I am speaking now let me read from here and he says by God's Great Providence I heard noise she was the next one to be on the platform I looked there and I tell you I never had such a feeling and here she come she was still crying I said sister Isaacson come near I said CAU my words repeat my words and I said God bless you honey you are the little girl that was out in the h a while ago when I come in I said Jesus Christ has already healed you sweet heart praise God I want to speak to somebody in here as I read your name into this quotation he says to this little girl little girl Jesus Christ has already healed you sweetheart yeah yeah so she was there still walking with their cres but yet already healed amen glory to God she was still in that state but yet God had already healed it and it was a damn case amen I wonder who this is tonight I want to say you are already healed sitting where you are sitting you have already received your heart's desire sitting where you are sitting you just have to come to a place where you recognize that God has already done it you can't believe this message and remain the same something is got to happen but I'm here to tell you your hour has arrived your hour for the manifestation of what you have believed is now arrived so brother Bram says to the little girl when you go over there you sit down and have someone take off those brasses off and you put your hand on your little hip when they move this shoe and breast off you let let your hand sleep just about the same distance that your leg is short and then let me see you God now I want you to think about this the prophet of God says to this little girl she's got one leg which is shorter than the other it says go sit down there and when you sit down this is what I want you to do I want you to put your hand on your Hep and I want you to move your hand with the same distance that the leg is short as they remove the breast you move your hand you push the mirle oh let me speak to somebody in here and say as you are sitting where you are sitting you move your hand you push your Miracle you have already been healed God has already done it in your life but as you are sitting there move it with the same distance I don't know what it was but you move it with the same distance you move it with the same miracle that you require if if it is a job move it with the salary that you require if it is a home move it with the right type that you require whatever your heart's desire is move it with exactly the same amount and you will walk out of this place with something that you desire do you

praise God can be seated amen tonight um I I I'm um I don't know if uh brother gwon was told what we were teaching on on uh Wednesday nights was he told was he informed of anything on Wednesday nights well y'all know the Holy Ghost Ed uh his vant brought him from across the seas and and pick up on Wednesday night and our topic has been barrenness right and and come right here and and start preaching about uh Mary and and and Elizabeth and you know all all I know is that this was God and you know I was I was I was thinking to myself because when we were in um uh London for Easter there was a special prayer line uh for those that were Barren and and then also those that had children uh that were just going through you know different uh like I told you that there's a a demon that has been released on the children today uh autism is a demon I'm I'm every land Every Nation I I hear different people going through this so uh I I I um there was a special prayer line for for you know those uh for that and uh I saw different ones that got got into the prayer line and I was just thinking as I was coming into church tonight I said you know what and the ones that I know that are going through personally uh I'm I'm ready to tell the testimony amen amen right I'm ready to tell the testimony just just like the angel told Mary your your cousin your cousin she was called Baron but right now she is pregnant and been 6 months pregnant and like he said they might have been trying to hide it right because that you know according to scripture John wasn't even moving so there was a little concerned about this and and and and imagine cuz if um now John's not moving and imagine with the doubt that Zachariah had right with the doubt that he had how would he have responded right when his baby wasn't moving come on cuz God had to shut his mouth so he couldn't even talk couldn't say nothing and he probably got tired of writing everything down oh yeah right but but but when when when um Mary comes there and all this hiding right um uh but but when Mary comes there and and begins to tell Elizabeth now look I know cuz the angel told me that you pregnant well I wasn't trying to tell nobody that say well but but I'm also going to have a child wait a minute you and Joseph married no we're not married what you mean y'all not married how you going to have a baby and not be married married you know this is not good news he said well but the angel told me the same angel that told me about you told me I was going to have a child so what's the name of what's the name of the child the name going to be Jesus Elizabeth Elizabeth say say that name again Jesus John begin to move inside the womb and and and there was resurrection power in the name of Jesus Hallelujah and I just I just love that God's God is using God used Elizabeth's situation the barness for years the praying for years God used that to be Mary's encouragement see when you start thinking about things like that and and I as when brother brother GW said I I began to think I'm going through this for you you can you can somebody I'm going through this for you that's right praise God Jesus went through the cross for us right but I'm going through this for you oh my you begin to give God praise in the midst of whatever you're going through this was this was this was right on time I I'm I'm looking for testimonies I I can't wait for the testimonies even the word going through the line just going through the ether waves and we'll see we'll hear the testimonies people weren't even here at the church to hear it but they heard it online on the stream and was blessed by it oh my that's the power of the word that that is the power of the word he was telling the testimony of the of the little boy that was healed there Amen in Finland you know and there was two Miracles that took place uh there and and one of them God didn't show the prophet he showed them the boy that was that was going to get hit by my car and be raised again but there was another boy that got HD also and the mother was uh they were calling brother Brown like uh you prayed for the other boy pray for our boy too I said God didn't show me that other boy he didn't show me that so I I don't know what to say and uh and while he was there you know uh in the hotel room uh he had a vision and he saw uh I think like two flowers or something one was standing up and one was leaning down and uh and then and and it was the boy that the flower that leaning down was the boy that was dying the other boy was living again so uh god um uh there was some candy that was given to him and and and the prophet uh began to eat the candy and he said it was so bitter the the candy was so bitter that he spit the candy out and uh and the angel told him say you better eat that candy if you want the other boy to live sometimes you have to go through some things for somebody else and brother brandom got that candy down and next thing you know that flower popped back up he called him Mama said your boy GNA live praise God oh we're prep to believe all things man this is this was powerful this was powerful oh we thank God let me uh let
