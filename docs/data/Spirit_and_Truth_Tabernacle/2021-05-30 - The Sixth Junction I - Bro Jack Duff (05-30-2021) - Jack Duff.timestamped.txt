[22:32] amen you know if we continue to do that
[22:35] boy i'll tell you what
[22:36] don't be surprised now don't be
[22:39] surprised
[22:40] there used to be time when we used to

[22:46] i said that to say all this let's not
[22:49] let this get
[22:50] get common to us
[22:53] amen don't let it get common
[22:56] i feel good now go ahead sister
[23:00] i don't want no preacher
[23:02] [Music]
[23:04] god bless you all um
[23:08] at first i didn't want to give this
[23:10] testimony because
[23:12] it's a little personal and i think that
[23:14] that's just the devil trying to
[23:16] hide a testimony so i'm going to give it
[23:20] about three months ago um i noticed that
[23:24] there was
[23:24] um a lump in one of my breasts
[23:27] and um that was startling for me but i
[23:31] thought okay well maybe i pulled a
[23:33] muscle or something
[23:34] because that's happened before i'll pull
[23:37] something and it'll leave like a lump
[23:38] until it heals you know
[23:41] but a month and a half went by and it
[23:44] wasn't going away it was getting bigger
[23:46] and i was starting to hurt
[23:49] so i said okay i'll give it a little
[23:51] more time
[23:52] um another month went by and it was
[23:55] still growing and
[23:57] hurting more so
[24:00] the wednesday service when we had the
[24:02] prayer line
[24:03] that so many testimonies have come from
[24:06] i went for prayer
[24:07] for that and
[24:11] i was just holding on to my faith that
[24:12] god was going to move and heal me
[24:15] and the lump was not going away and it
[24:18] was still hurting
[24:20] so i decided to go to the doctor i had
[24:23] them do tests they did
[24:24] two tests they did a mammogram and then
[24:26] they did an ultrasound
[24:28] and on both of the tests they couldn't
[24:30] see anything so the
[24:32] the the ultrasound the lady with the
[24:35] ultrasound wand
[24:36] she said i can feel it um the
[24:39] the wand is going over the lump but i
[24:42] don't see anything on the ultrasound so
[24:44] we're all just sitting there
[24:46] utterly confused
[24:49] and they said well since it's hurting
[24:52] the next step would be for you to get a
[24:56] a biopsy so we're going to schedule you
[24:58] with the surgeon and that didn't
[25:00] sit right with me that was not okay with
[25:03] me
[25:03] um so i called my husband and i was like
[25:08] um you know i wonder why
[25:11] god is letting this go on for so long
[25:13] you know we've prayed over it and
[25:15] you know i know he can heal me so you
[25:17] know what's he doing and
[25:19] um i remember after i hung up with him i
[25:22] had to run some
[25:23] errands and i hadn't eaten that day so i
[25:24] went and got some food
[25:26] and i decided to sit in my car and eat
[25:28] because the place was packed
[25:30] and i remember
[25:33] my husband had said sometimes he'll turn
[25:35] on the lifeline radio
[25:38] on the the message app and
[25:41] he'll hear god speak to him sometimes
[25:44] through that
[25:44] so i turned on the lifeline radio as i
[25:47] was sitting in the car and i couldn't
[25:48] believe what started coming through
[25:53] the first thing i heard when i turned it
[25:55] on was
[25:56] this quote it says you be the judge
[26:00] your mind is the jury every jury
[26:03] has to make up its mind i'm closing the
[26:05] court
[26:06] you be the judge your mind is the jury
[26:08] and your actions
[26:10] from here after this afternoon when we
[26:12] lay hands on the sick
[26:14] that'll spell what your verdict was
[26:17] the way you act after you're prayed for
[26:20] that'll tell what your intellectual mind
[26:22] has made up what the jury of your mind
[26:25] has made up
[26:26] that'll tell just exactly your action
[26:28] from here after
[26:30] and then that was that was a
[26:32] confirmation for me not to have
[26:34] the biopsy and then i sat there
[26:37] just eating and then i heard um
[26:41] it was brother branham's voice but it
[26:42] was god speaking to me
[26:44] and it said a little lady sitting right
[26:46] here
[26:47] looking right at me i don't know you i'm
[26:50] not gonna cry
[26:52] i'm sorry it was just so personal to me
[26:55] because it was
[26:56] very terrifying for me it says uh you're
[27:00] a stranger to me
[27:01] you don't know me sitting right here uh
[27:05] looking right at me yes you you don't
[27:07] know me but you're suffering aren't you
[27:10] you kind of was a little worried about
[27:12] something
[27:13] it's a lump that's in your breast
[27:17] if that's right raise up your hand now
[27:19] you say
[27:20] you see you've seen a lump there is no
[27:23] lump
[27:23] shows so
[27:26] i see it i feel it i i can feel it there
[27:30] i can feel the pain
[27:31] but there's nothing showing anywhere on
[27:34] any of the tests
[27:36] so i'm just holding to
[27:40] um my testimony that god
[27:43] has healed me completely and the day
[27:46] that that lump
[27:47] goes away and i don't feel the pain
[27:49] anymore i will be right here
[27:51] saying amen thank you jesus because i
[27:54] knew you already healed me
[28:02] i hope this song is a blessing a
[28:04] blessing for you
[28:19] [Music]
[28:30] it's a blessing when i see
[28:33] the dark clouds partying
[28:39] when the rain is gone and sun
[28:42] is breaking through
[28:48] i anticipate when life will just be
[28:53] normal
[28:57] just to close my weary eyes and rest in
[29:02] you
[29:06] my heart can rest so easy when there's
[29:11] blue skies
[29:15] when the wind is gone and rain
[29:18] is not inside
[29:22] [Music]
[29:24] how i long to hang my sword above the
[29:28] mantle
[29:33] away from harm and distant
[29:36] from the fire
[29:41] but i wouldn't know your peace without
[29:45] the
[29:46] hard times
[29:50] or be thankful for relief without the
[29:54] pain
[29:59] i wouldn't love the light if it
[30:02] were not for darkness
[30:08] or appreciate the sun
[30:11] without the rain
[30:16] how could i understand forgiveness
[30:20] without failure
[30:25] or feel the warmth of love without
[30:28] the bitter cold
[30:33] how could i hold your healing hands
[30:37] without affliction
[30:42] and be blessed to see your mercies all
[30:48] unfold
[30:50] sure it's a blessing
[30:53] to be safe secure and warm
[30:59] but lord i wanna thank you
[31:03] for the storm
[31:04] [Music]
[31:07] [Applause]
[31:10] [Music]
[31:13] imagine as peter said
[31:16] in prison
[31:20] he may have paced the floors with chains
[31:24] around
[31:24] his feet
[31:27] [Music]
[31:28] and in his mind the devil taunted
[31:32] as he whispered
[31:37] the battles lost and this
[31:40] is your defeat
[31:44] [Music]
[31:45] and then his mind went back to that
[31:48] night in the tempest
[31:54] when the master spoke and winds and sees
[31:58] obey
[32:00] [Music]
[32:02] and he remembered that storm coming
[32:06] all around him
[32:10] and he could rest in that dark prison
[32:14] unafraid
[32:18] and say
[32:23] i wouldn't know your peace without the
[32:27] hard times
[32:31] or be thankful for relief
[32:34] without the pain
[32:39] i wouldn't love the light if it
[32:43] were not for darkness
[32:48] or appreciate the sun
[32:51] without the rain

[41:04] wednesday nights
[41:06] bible study pastor was talking about the
[41:11] tender hand of jehovah
[41:14] and i began to just meditate on what
[41:16] that meant
[41:18] the tender hannah jehovah
[41:21] and um of course
[41:24] sister birds was speaking on yesterday
[41:28] and
[41:29] just kind of thinking of the past and
[41:32] how we got to this point
[41:37] there was a hunger and a thirst for
[41:39] something real
[41:41] we were nothing against my baptist
[41:45] brothers and sisters but it just
[41:49] it was a deep that was calling and we
[41:53] were children
[41:55] but they were our parents and they were
[41:58] our
[42:00] our leaders at the time
[42:04] and god placed that hunger in them that
[42:06] there's got to be something more
[42:10] and the tender hand of jehovah
[42:13] sort of moved him from one place to
[42:16] another
[42:18] and just this morning brother jack and i
[42:21] was fellowshipping on how
[42:23] the courage for brother west go to go
[42:26] off and come back with this strange
[42:28] message that we've never heard

[56:33] and we just appreciate amen them and
[56:35] and i have a a precious friend of mine
[56:37] that's with us
[56:38] a man for this weekend and she moved to
[56:41] tennessee
[56:42] before she left to go to tennessee her
[56:45] final
[56:45] um visit to church was here a man a
[56:49] spirit of truth tabernacle and
[56:51] and uh when she was she was been there
[56:53] for a little over a year and
[56:54] and the lord is blessed to come back and
[56:56] visit uh this time i should say the lord
[56:58] i just put in my spirit
[57:00] two churches to visit when i came
[57:02] supposed to go to church that i
[57:03] came from and then i was supposed to go
[57:05] to your church so she here and my
[57:08] precious friend
[57:09] joyce tucci amen is in the house
[57:13] uh a dear sister
[57:16] in christ uh we we met on the job and
[57:20] and um you can tell it was a friendship
[57:23] from
[57:24] eternity uh because even since we've
[57:27] left that job
[57:28] we've stayed in contact every time
[57:31] you know the lord opens up a door for me
[57:33] to go somewhere if i don't call and tell
[57:36] her where i'm going
[57:37] she reprimands me amen and the reason
[57:40] she reprimands me is because she say
[57:42] i want to pray for you i want to be
[57:45] covering you in prayer especially when
[57:47] you're away and and she always she
[57:49] always asks this one question is your
[57:50] wife going with you
[57:52] i like that now there's a reason she
[57:54] asks that
[57:55] right because she knows that there's
[57:57] temptations out there
[57:59] glory to god the devil y'all think it'd
[58:00] just be some vacation no the devil's
[58:02] waiting to trip somebody up
[58:05] right so we have we have to have to stay
[58:07] on guard all the time
[58:09] every hotel you're going to you got to
[58:10] stay on guard there's spirits there
[58:13] waiting to attack a minister the devil
[58:16] has somebody checking the hotel the very
[58:18] day you check in
[58:20] and they watching and spotting ain't
[58:22] nobody with them
[58:24] right they watch that type of stuff the
[58:26] devil try to set you up
[58:28] so i like to have my wife with me i i
[58:31] like to have that or go with another
[58:32] brother or something you know that that
[58:34] keep the devil at baby
[58:36] not no brother looking for no trouble
[58:43] amen but you know holiness is still
[58:47] right
[58:49] glory to god so i just i thank god and i
[58:52] just

[59:41] hour of the day
[59:42] but this is that which was spoken by the
[59:44] prophet joel and it shall come to pass

[1:00:49] uh in the midst of the junction
[1:00:52] y'all understand that that's why sister
[1:00:53] amanda had to give her testimony
[1:00:56] and and and they told me that we when we
[1:00:58] had that wednesday night service about a
[1:01:00] month or so ago and all those
[1:01:02] testimonies that came forth and we had
[1:01:03] everybody testify but
[1:01:05] nobody could hear what you were saying
[1:01:07] on the other line so i might have to set
[1:01:09] up another service just for testimonies
[1:01:12] right so uh let's just share what god is
[1:01:14] doing
[1:01:15] amen make known as deeds among men
[1:01:18] he's still moving in the midst of a
[1:01:20] pandemic he's still god in the midst of
[1:01:22] a pandemic
[1:01:24] glory to god all right so uh here verse
[1:01:27] 18 says no my servants and all my
[1:01:29] handmaids i will pour out
[1:01:30] pour out in those days of my spirit and
[1:01:33] they
[1:01:34] shall prophesy glory to god i i love it

[1:04:04] titled
[1:04:04] uh the sixth junction and i will uh
[1:04:08] probably preach this in a two-part
[1:04:11] series
[1:04:12] um and um you know we'll just see where
[1:04:15] the lord just kind of takes
[1:04:17] us from there but i um
[1:04:20] want to just maybe
[1:04:23] uh take us back amen to
[1:04:26] some of the quotes that we've been
[1:04:28] reading amen when it comes to
[1:04:30] uh this junction amen
[1:04:35] praise the lord and out of the the first
[1:04:38] quote i want to read is at a junction of
[1:04:39] time
[1:04:41] and this paragraph e-4
[1:04:44] uh we'll read from there praise god
[1:04:48] it says my subject this morning
[1:04:51] uh if we should call it such will be
[1:04:54] the message to the church is the
[1:04:57] junction
[1:04:58] of time the junction of time and always
[1:05:01] in days gone by the dispensations has
[1:05:05] always come
[1:05:06] to their end and we hit a junction
[1:05:11] and and you know i'm using uh very
[1:05:14] um um how would i say
[1:05:17] spiritual terms when we talk about a
[1:05:19] dispensation coming to an
[1:05:21] end uh but uh as we're going through
[1:05:24] this i want you to
[1:05:25] kind of look at your own life as we
[1:05:27] started this journey
[1:05:28] uh through this this this subject um
[1:05:31] there are there are things that
[1:05:33] um that we could see in our own lives
[1:05:35] where we hit a junction
[1:05:37] right we hit a junction uh um
[1:05:40] a junction is is very simple you know i
[1:05:43] don't want to go and make this too deep
[1:05:45] but it's very simple
[1:05:46] when you leave the parking lot and you
[1:05:49] get to the stop light
[1:05:51] or when you get to a stop sign right
[1:05:54] uh any anything like that that is
[1:05:57] considered a
[1:05:58] junction glory to god
[1:06:01] uh you can't leave the parking lot and
[1:06:05] just
[1:06:05] roll out into traffic especially if it's
[1:06:08] coming in that direction
[1:06:09] it won't be a if you ignore the junction
[1:06:13] you end up in an accident
[1:06:16] oh my right if you ignore junctions you
[1:06:20] end up in an accident
[1:06:21] and spiritually you can actually be
[1:06:24] going
[1:06:25] a man uh to a junction you can be at a
[1:06:28] junction
[1:06:29] in your life and and a junction if it's
[1:06:32] a stop sign you know what it means to do
[1:06:37] it's just that simple stop right don't
[1:06:41] go
[1:06:41] any further than this because there's
[1:06:44] there there's a potential for a great
[1:06:46] accident
[1:06:47] if you go further than this and
[1:06:49] spiritually people have not been able to
[1:06:51] stop
[1:06:52] glory to god amen we're not i mean there
[1:06:55] are people
[1:06:56] listening on the line and it's one thing
[1:06:58] to listen on the line that you're not
[1:07:00] doing anything great by just listening
[1:07:03] praise god amen but if you're not
[1:07:05] obeying the word of god
[1:07:06] if you're not coming in line with the
[1:07:08] word of god the holy spirit is telling
[1:07:10] you
[1:07:11] stop stop your sinning
[1:07:14] stop this and stop that get back in line
[1:07:17] with the word of god
[1:07:19] hallelujah you're at a junction
[1:07:22] see so it says see there's there's
[1:07:24] there's uh always in the days gone by
[1:07:26] the dispensations has always come to
[1:07:28] their end we hit a junction
[1:07:30] says there's junctions on the highways
[1:07:33] they
[1:07:34] junction on the roads that we travel in
[1:07:36] this world
[1:07:37] they junction on this grand old highway
[1:07:39] that we travel to glory
[1:07:42] so so on your spiritual journey you're
[1:07:44] going to have to come to junctions
[1:07:46] and let me let me let me make it clear
[1:07:48] the decision
[1:07:49] that you make at the junction is
[1:07:52] extremely critical
[1:07:54] if you make the wrong decision at the
[1:07:56] junction you can find yourself somewhere
[1:07:59] where you never thought you would be
[1:08:00] glory to god
[1:08:03] you know sometimes when you're choosing
[1:08:04] a church you're at a
[1:08:06] junction and if you choose the wrong
[1:08:08] church you can end up worse sheep
[1:08:11] praise god than you were amen before
[1:08:14] that choice
[1:08:15] so it's very important that you
[1:08:16] understand spiritually we're all here in
[1:08:19] this spot
[1:08:19] we're at a junction we've got to make
[1:08:21] decisions
[1:08:23] eternal decisions at the junction it
[1:08:26] says in
[1:08:26] and always it takes the miraculous to
[1:08:29] speak of an
[1:08:30] omnipotence omnipotence is the all
[1:08:33] powerful and it takes the miraculous to
[1:08:34] vindicate the omnipotence
[1:08:36] and only the miraculous can do that
[1:08:39] teach another word is a very fine
[1:08:42] thing and it comes faith comes by
[1:08:45] hearing and hearing the word
[1:08:47] but it always takes the miraculous to
[1:08:50] vindicate that the omnipotence still
[1:08:53] lives and reigns
[1:08:54] we must oh
[1:08:58] hallelujah i've been reading it
[1:09:01] amen and not just reading it because now
[1:09:03] uh what i've been reading we are now
[1:09:05] experiencing
[1:09:07] we must have the miraculous amen
[1:09:10] i believe there's another statement the
[1:09:12] prophet makes that no church can thrive
[1:09:15] until the supernatural is made known in
[1:09:18] the midst of the people
[1:09:19] something that they can talk to and
[1:09:22] something that'll talk back to them
[1:09:24] i believe the uh almighty god has been
[1:09:27] talking
[1:09:27] back to us with his supernatural
[1:09:30] presence being in our midst
[1:09:31] healing after healing glory to god lives
[1:09:35] being changed
[1:09:36] supernaturally oh y'all don't get it yet
[1:09:39] but you will see i mean super i i'ma
[1:09:42] tell you just
[1:09:43] one soul coming into the kingdom
[1:09:47] causes heaven to rejoice
[1:09:51] now you understand that i never saw
[1:09:53] brother so-and-so go to the altar
[1:09:55] i never saw sister so-and-so go to the
[1:09:57] altar i want to say something about
[1:09:59] altar calls
[1:10:00] jesus never had one
[1:10:05] but lies were changed right and and what
[1:10:07] what has happened
[1:10:08] and what i found in church is that we
[1:10:10] have too many people want to see
[1:10:12] who's at the altar glory to god but what
[1:10:16] i want to see is do they have an altar
[1:10:18] in their heart
[1:10:19] that god has done something where you
[1:10:20] can take it down amen god has done
[1:10:22] something with that person in their
[1:10:24] heart
[1:10:25] and you see their lives being
[1:10:26] transformed
[1:10:28] right before your very eyes that is a
[1:10:30] miracle
[1:10:31] happening at the junction
[1:10:35] oh i thank god for this i thank god i
[1:10:37] thank god i thank god
[1:10:39] hallelujah i was you know listening
[1:10:41] recently and probably just talk about
[1:10:43] how
[1:10:43] you know it's okay to do the altar call
[1:10:45] but just know it wasn't in the bible
[1:10:47] there's a lot of things the church do
[1:10:49] that's not in the bible
[1:10:50] it's not there a lot and we've accepted
[1:10:53] it
[1:10:54] but it's not there that don't mean that
[1:10:55] i'll never have another altar call i
[1:10:57] but the article is not for you to see
[1:10:59] who's coming to the altar
[1:11:02] praise the lord it's for god to do
[1:11:05] something in a person's life
[1:11:07] and as i see god just transforming lives
[1:11:09] i just begin to thank him for what i see
[1:11:11] him doing in our midst
[1:11:13] oh glory to god hey amen amen
[1:11:17] some of the most powerful things that
[1:11:19] happen on the earth happen
[1:11:20] in quietness when the sun rises do you
[1:11:25] hear it
[1:11:27] right you don't hear the sunrise but
[1:11:29] when it rises
[1:11:30] there's no light like sunlight
[1:11:34] none whatsoever happens in quietness
[1:11:35] when the moon rises
[1:11:37] you don't hear it right it's a powerful
[1:11:40] act but
[1:11:40] if that moon wasn't there and it wasn't
[1:11:42] in the position it was in
[1:11:44] then the sea would actually embark
[1:11:47] upon the land but when the moon rise in
[1:11:50] quietness
[1:11:50] it it steadies the sea it stops the sea
[1:11:54] from coming too far into land
[1:11:56] it says boundaries the moon stops to see
[1:12:01] some of the most powerful things happen
[1:12:03] in quietness
[1:12:06] all right here in this message hear ye
[1:12:09] him let me just uh
[1:12:10] bring this one as well um and
[1:12:13] um it says here every junction of time
[1:12:18] god sends forth uh prophets uh then
[1:12:22] angels and gives a warning it says like
[1:12:25] him before the ant of the living
[1:12:26] destruction before
[1:12:27] every other time god always sends
[1:12:29] warnings first
[1:12:31] he could not put punishment on the earth
[1:12:32] without and be
[1:12:34] and be just without first sending
[1:12:36] warning i wanted to stop it right there
[1:12:38] amen so so at a junction especially a
[1:12:41] spiritual and as we're talking about
[1:12:43] these seven junctions and today we're
[1:12:44] focusing on the six a man junction every
[1:12:47] junction god
[1:12:48] sends forth prophets and angels and
[1:12:50] gives a warning so
[1:12:52] every junction we should expect prophets
[1:12:54] we should expect
[1:12:55] a man uh angels we and and and the
[1:12:58] reason a prophet comes he's giving a
[1:12:59] warning to the people
[1:13:01] now brother branham and his um uh
[1:13:03] teaching us
[1:13:04] on this message the the junctions of
[1:13:06] time
[1:13:07] uh he um uh he laid out
[1:13:11] there were seven different junctions
[1:13:13] that he saw according to scripture
[1:13:16] seven major events that happened in
[1:13:18] scripture
[1:13:19] uh that has shaped where we are right
[1:13:23] now
[1:13:24] right it shaped seven different things
[1:13:27] and and we're focusing on those seven
[1:13:29] major uh events that happened now there
[1:13:31] was a lot of other things happen
[1:13:32] in the bible but seven things that he
[1:13:35] saw that that would be considered a
[1:13:36] junction
[1:13:37] and uh and the first one that he listed
[1:13:39] was noah and the ark
[1:13:41] hallelujah that's something that shifted
[1:13:43] uh what what happened in those days the
[1:13:45] sons of god
[1:13:47] uh went after the daughters of men
[1:13:49] hallelujah i i can stay right there for
[1:13:51] a little bit
[1:13:52] the sons of god going after people that
[1:13:55] are not christians
[1:13:57] can i put it that way the sons of god
[1:13:59] having their attention on some some some
[1:14:02] young lady that is not in the church
[1:14:04] glory to god hallelujah and sometimes
[1:14:07] you have the daughters of men
[1:14:08] tricking the sons of god it's the truth
[1:14:12] anyhow
[1:14:13] it's a spirit come upon them women and
[1:14:15] if the sons of god not
[1:14:16] not careful they'll be tricked by one of
[1:14:19] these women
[1:14:20] and they find themselves married oh it's
[1:14:23] the truth anyhow
[1:14:24] married to a problem
[1:14:28] that they can't get out it gonna take
[1:14:29] the grace of god to carry you through
[1:14:32] and since this is this is the bed that
[1:14:34] you decided to lay in you're gonna have
[1:14:35] to lay in it
[1:14:38] it's the bed you made you got to lay in
[1:14:39] it but but the sons of god residents
[1:14:42] i mean like like like like uh uh uh uh
[1:14:45] sampson his parents told say why don't
[1:14:46] you get one of these sisters here from
[1:14:48] the church
[1:14:49] but he just had to have delilah
[1:14:52] he had to have i got to have a mom and
[1:14:55] dad you don't understand i got to have
[1:14:57] the life
[1:14:57] and it wasn't i mean the parents knew
[1:14:59] this boy every time you go down in the
[1:15:01] philip and
[1:15:02] amongst the philistines these women get
[1:15:05] you in trouble
[1:15:06] they are not interested in your beauty
[1:15:08] they not interested in your strength
[1:15:10] they only interested in killing you and
[1:15:13] they will they will do any they will
[1:15:15] agree to anything to get at your life
[1:15:19] hallelujah think about this we only hear
[1:15:22] about delilah but before delilah there
[1:15:23] was another woman in sampson's life
[1:15:26] come on somebody and that woman said how
[1:15:28] come you won't give me the riddle samson
[1:15:31] you know he said i mean you say you love
[1:15:33] me seven days been waiting on the real
[1:15:35] side i ain't even told my parents to
[1:15:36] riddle why would i tell you to real
[1:15:38] say i thought you loved me sampson
[1:15:40] sampson gave up the riddle that lady
[1:15:42] went and told everybody and
[1:15:44] they come out and told her and he said
[1:15:45] i'ma say it just like the bible now
[1:15:47] he said you wouldn't know my riddle if
[1:15:50] you didn't mess with my heifer
[1:15:54] is that the bible that is thus says the
[1:15:57] lord out of the scripture
[1:15:59] you got to understand what people are
[1:16:01] doing they are spirits in
[1:16:03] in philistine in the land of the
[1:16:04] philistines they they're set up there to
[1:16:07] kill you
[1:16:08] samson praise the lord
[1:16:12] glory to god but the reason that the
[1:16:14] sons of god go after these sorts of men
[1:16:16] y'all ain't gonna i'm i'm not gonna get
[1:16:17] verified i feel like i'm not going to
[1:16:19] get very far
[1:16:20] but the reason these sons of god go
[1:16:22] after the daughters of men they're not
[1:16:23] willing to wait on the lord
[1:16:26] they want to beat god to the punch it's
[1:16:29] the truth anyhow
[1:16:31] right and the same spirits that was in
[1:16:34] north day has returned again today
[1:16:38] hallelujah you get yourself all tied up
[1:16:41] with the daughter of man
[1:16:43] that's your problem now hallelujah and
[1:16:46] some good precious sisters and i'm gonna
[1:16:48] tell y'all brothers you ain't got to be
[1:16:49] looking nowhere we got good sisters
[1:16:51] right here in this church
[1:16:55] ones that you know faithful to the lord
[1:16:58] been taught right
[1:16:59] praise the lord keeping themselves not
[1:17:02] out there getting involved with
[1:17:03] everything they can
[1:17:05] hallelujah amen back i mean you know
[1:17:08] look
[1:17:08] uh in the bible days uh when mary was
[1:17:11] was approached by gabriel
[1:17:13] they was only looking for what one type
[1:17:14] of woman
[1:17:17] it's the truth any high because the
[1:17:19] bible promised a virgin would conceive
[1:17:22] so if she had been touched by somebody
[1:17:24] she wanted god she was not a part of
[1:17:26] that promise
[1:17:27] mary had to keep herself glory to god we
[1:17:30] have young ladies have to keep
[1:17:31] themselves
[1:17:32] young men that have to keep themselves
[1:17:34] come on somebody
[1:17:37] hallelujah yeah we still believe in
[1:17:40] keeping yourself
[1:17:40] living holy we believe in that
[1:17:44] glory to god all right all right but the
[1:17:46] sons of god went after the daughters of
[1:17:48] men that was a problem
[1:17:49] at the first junction it's a problem
[1:17:51] today but we know that there was a
[1:17:53] tremendous
[1:17:54] miracle of the animals coming to the ark
[1:17:56] and usually you would think
[1:17:58] that when those people saw the animals
[1:17:59] coming to the ark that should have been
[1:18:00] some sign
[1:18:02] that something is going on right i mean
[1:18:04] animals walking through their backyards
[1:18:07] on the way to the ark i saw i saw two
[1:18:09] yesterday i saw two of these uh
[1:18:12] last week i thought i just keep seeing
[1:18:14] two by two by two what is going on
[1:18:16] and they they end up over here at lord's
[1:18:18] ark
[1:18:19] hallelujah people knew something was
[1:18:21] happening oh
[1:18:23] jesus sometimes god can do something
[1:18:25] supernatural
[1:18:26] and people know god is in the midst but
[1:18:28] they're not able to shake themselves
[1:18:30] from that lifestyle
[1:18:33] what was that just last year we had the
[1:18:36] the tones go forth and then
[1:18:37] interpretation right there behind it
[1:18:40] right supernatural right here in the
[1:18:42] church people knew that was god
[1:18:44] and then walked right out of here and
[1:18:46] kept on sinning
[1:18:48] this is the days of noah
[1:18:51] no conviction no more
[1:18:54] it's the truth anyhow people don't have
[1:18:56] conviction anymore
[1:18:58] glory to god hallelujah
[1:19:01] all right amen and you know hear the
[1:19:04] sons of god going after the daughters of
[1:19:05] men but wait they saw the miracle of the
[1:19:07] animals coming to the ark that should
[1:19:09] have been enough to shake them when the
[1:19:10] rain came it was all over
[1:19:12] hallelujah another junction was moses
[1:19:15] with the children of israel
[1:19:17] moses was the prophet noah was the
[1:19:18] prophet in this day
[1:19:20] moses was the prophet in this second
[1:19:22] junction that brother branham brings to
[1:19:23] us
[1:19:24] and it says that you know we can see the
[1:19:25] miracles of the plagues falling in egypt
[1:19:27] glory the last plague of death we can
[1:19:30] see all of that and god anointed moses
[1:19:33] to call for each and every one of these
[1:19:34] plagues
[1:19:35] and the the miracle crossing the red sea
[1:19:39] and i love the the the the scripture
[1:19:42] amen that moses
[1:19:43] under inspiration spoke it said
[1:19:46] egyptians
[1:19:47] hallelujah a son of god our daughter god
[1:19:50] needs to hear that this morning
[1:19:52] the egyptians that you have seen today
[1:19:57] you will see them no more forever
[1:20:02] what a word coming out of that prophet's
[1:20:04] mouth
[1:20:05] because these egyptians are the ones
[1:20:07] that wreak havoc
[1:20:08] in their lives these are the egyptians
[1:20:10] are the ones that had them in bondage
[1:20:12] for a number of years
[1:20:13] maybe some of their their parents died
[1:20:15] at the hands
[1:20:16] of these egyptians but when they got a
[1:20:18] promise of thus saith the lord
[1:20:20] from a prophet that the egyptians that
[1:20:22] you see today
[1:20:23] you will see them no more forever
[1:20:26] hallelujah they didn't know how god was
[1:20:27] going to fulfill that promise
[1:20:29] through moses lips but what god did was
[1:20:32] allow them to pass through on dry ground
[1:20:34] and as those egyptians come through
[1:20:36] thinking that god was making a way for
[1:20:38] them hallelujah it was their burial
[1:20:40] place
[1:20:41] they walked through that red sea glory
[1:20:44] to god and
[1:20:45] the red sea drowned them as the children
[1:20:47] of israel come out of the red sea
[1:20:48] amen so so so here here it is uh a god
[1:20:51] god made a way for the children of
[1:20:53] israel but god destroyed
[1:20:55] their enemy some of us need our enemies
[1:20:58] destroyed glory to god because when
[1:21:01] they're destroyed you can't go call them
[1:21:03] no more
[1:21:05] glory to god now sometimes we want
[1:21:08] physical destruction i'm not saying that
[1:21:10] but sometimes god needs to destroy your
[1:21:12] emotional attachment
[1:21:16] all right all right glory to god
[1:21:20] he can do it my friend amen sometime my
[1:21:23] argument come up in a relationship and
[1:21:25] and and and it reaches breaking point we
[1:21:28] can't take no more and you're trying to
[1:21:29] fix it patch it put it all back together
[1:21:32] god did that for a reason to get you out
[1:21:34] of that mess
[1:21:36] and don't go trying to recreate the mess
[1:21:39] all right let me go on abraham and lot
[1:21:42] was the third junction
[1:21:44] abraham uh was the prophet because the
[1:21:46] word
[1:21:47] came to the prophet god came and visited
[1:21:49] abraham
[1:21:50] at his tent and uh and and the great
[1:21:53] miracle
[1:21:54] that happened there in abraham's day was
[1:21:55] the body change
[1:21:57] glory they received the promised son and
[1:22:00] and
[1:22:01] and abraham had to go through a lot of
[1:22:03] changes himself
[1:22:04] a lot of things where it looked like he
[1:22:06] was just doubting like crazy in the
[1:22:08] midst of it
[1:22:09] but but when when paul wrote about him
[1:22:11] he says uh he staggered not at the
[1:22:13] promises of god through unbelief
[1:22:15] hallelujah that's what god thinks about
[1:22:17] you don't don't listen to what the devil
[1:22:19] got to say about you
[1:22:20] but listen to what god thinks about you
[1:22:22] he's staggering not at the promise of
[1:22:24] god through unbelief he was strong
[1:22:26] in faith giving praises to god
[1:22:28] hallelujah
[1:22:29] so there in uh and abraham and lots day
[1:22:32] another miracle was locked coming out of
[1:22:34] sodom
[1:22:35] oh i thank god for that we got loved
[1:22:38] ones in sodom conditions today
[1:22:42] but you know what just like lot they
[1:22:44] have been exposed to the truth
[1:22:47] oh let me talk to you just a little bit
[1:22:49] they had been exposed to the truth so
[1:22:51] when it was time for destruction
[1:22:53] god went down to sodom and got
[1:22:56] lot in his family out of there
[1:22:59] hallelujah i got
[1:23:01] confidence in my god that he would do
[1:23:04] the same thing today
[1:23:06] because i got lovers that might be
[1:23:09] living in gomorrah
[1:23:10] sodom and gomorrah type conditions but
[1:23:12] they have been exposed to the truth
[1:23:16] and i got confidence that god would go
[1:23:17] and get them out supernaturally
[1:23:21] gotta bring them out
[1:23:24] hallelujah and they won't be like lost
[1:23:26] wife looking back in their hearts
[1:23:29] because somebody out there actually
[1:23:30] looking for a way out they don't know
[1:23:31] how they enter something they don't know
[1:23:33] how to get out
[1:23:34] supernaturally god can bring them out
[1:23:37] all right abraham and lot the third
[1:23:39] junction the fourth junction the prophet
[1:23:41] brought was elijah and the 450 prophets
[1:23:43] of baal
[1:23:44] uh elijah was the prophet at that
[1:23:46] junction the miracle
[1:23:48] uh a lot there was eight miracles in
[1:23:51] elijah's ministry and
[1:23:52] one of the greatest miracles that took
[1:23:54] place is when the fire fell
[1:23:56] uh when he said you know let's stop
[1:23:59] let's stop um uh uh being confused about
[1:24:03] who we're gonna serve
[1:24:04] choose you to stay who you're gonna
[1:24:05] serve you say say look the god didn't
[1:24:07] answer by fire let him be god
[1:24:09] and when god set down fire on the
[1:24:11] sacrifice prove that he was still
[1:24:13] jehovah god
[1:24:14] uh uh god god uh the supernaturals made
[1:24:18] known there in elijah's ministry the
[1:24:21] supernaturals may know
[1:24:22] god proven himself at that junction
[1:24:24] glory to god they destroyed those 450
[1:24:27] prophets of baal elijah himself
[1:24:28] destroyed them all amen
[1:24:30] uh he didn't need no help he took took
[1:24:32] care of himself glory to god
[1:24:34] but here here we see that the fourth
[1:24:36] junction but the fifth junction is when
[1:24:38] jesus came to the earth
[1:24:41] and i love this amen because we we know
[1:24:44] that
[1:24:44] there were a couple prophets on the
[1:24:46] scene when jesus came to the earth
[1:24:48] first there was a prophet to introduce
[1:24:50] jesus now jesus himself
[1:24:53] was the prophet of all prophets
[1:24:56] right but john the baptist was a prophet
[1:24:58] there to introduce
[1:24:59] jesus at his first coming i need you to
[1:25:02] understand something glory to god
[1:25:04] if he had a prophet to introduce him
[1:25:08] at his first coming his ways does not
[1:25:11] change
[1:25:12] then at his second coming he will also
[1:25:14] have
[1:25:15] a prophet not prophets prophet
[1:25:19] to introduce the second coming
[1:25:22] all right now and there's scripture for
[1:25:24] that i don't know if i have a chance to
[1:25:26] get to it all today but there's
[1:25:27] scripture for that but here we know
[1:25:29] uh john the baptist is on the scene and
[1:25:31] and uh jesus also being the prophet of
[1:25:33] all prophets being introduced by john
[1:25:35] the baptist
[1:25:36] i'll talk to you all about the 39
[1:25:38] miracles of jesus i didn't i didn't have
[1:25:40] time to go through all of them but
[1:25:42] in scripture they recorded 39 different
[1:25:44] miracles
[1:25:45] uh that that that was there and and we
[1:25:47] focused a lot of attention
[1:25:49] on some of the miracles that happened in
[1:25:51] capernaum
[1:25:52] glory to god the nobleman's son
[1:25:55] according to john four
[1:25:56] uh the nobleman's son uh was healed the
[1:25:59] man approached him say
[1:26:00] you know would you come and heal my son
[1:26:02] he's at the point of dying
[1:26:04] and would you come and he said you know
[1:26:05] look uh and unless you see signs and
[1:26:08] wonders you won't even believe
[1:26:09] he said sir i don't have time to argue
[1:26:11] with you about all that my son is dying
[1:26:13] air come down now please he said i'll
[1:26:17] tell you what
[1:26:18] you know go find your son hill based on
[1:26:20] your faith you're gonna find yourself
[1:26:21] healed just go
[1:26:22] and you'll see so the man left there and
[1:26:25] as he left jesus presence he was on his
[1:26:27] way home
[1:26:28] uh the next day somebody approached him
[1:26:30] and said hey
[1:26:31] your son has made men's your son is
[1:26:33] healed say he said oh yeah
[1:26:35] uh he was rejoicing but now what time
[1:26:38] did he start making men's
[1:26:40] and uh and i love this because when they
[1:26:42] told him the time the man went back and
[1:26:44] kept him said that's the same time
[1:26:46] that jesus told me to go home that i
[1:26:49] would find my son healed
[1:26:51] but the scripture said this way it
[1:26:53] wasn't just the time that jesus told him
[1:26:56] it was a time that jesus told them and
[1:26:59] the time that he believed
[1:27:02] the hallelujah we already know what he
[1:27:04] done said in this word but when are you
[1:27:06] gonna apply your face
[1:27:08] to what he said in his word that's when
[1:27:10] you will see
[1:27:12] your miracle not just when he said it
[1:27:16] but when he believed what he said
[1:27:19] that was the second miracle glory to god
[1:27:21] that the scripture recorded in jesus
[1:27:23] ministry the first being him turning the
[1:27:25] water
[1:27:26] into wine we focused a man on capernaum
[1:27:29] because it was also a capernaum
[1:27:31] that according to mark 1 glory glory
[1:27:34] there was a man that went to church with
[1:27:37] some unclean spirits
[1:27:39] and we brought this out that the man
[1:27:40] noticed where he went with his unclean
[1:27:42] spirits this man hung around
[1:27:44] church with unclean spirits
[1:27:48] and it was only when he came in contact
[1:27:50] with christ
[1:27:51] that these spirits amen had to lose this
[1:27:54] man and let him go
[1:27:55] and what i want you to see is that there
[1:27:57] are people that come to
[1:27:58] church hallelujah there's people that
[1:28:02] might even listen
[1:28:02] online but they still have unclean
[1:28:06] spirits so the holy ghost is trying to
[1:28:10] shine light in that area to get the
[1:28:12] person free from those unclean spirits
[1:28:15] spirits told you he said now we know who
[1:28:17] you are why are you coming to do this
[1:28:18] and come to us
[1:28:19] jesus say uh just pretty much hush stop
[1:28:22] talking
[1:28:22] and leave the man did not have the right
[1:28:26] to stay in that man after they come in
[1:28:28] contact with jesus
[1:28:29] i want to tell somebody the devil don't
[1:28:31] got a right to keep you in the condition
[1:28:33] that you're in
[1:28:34] the devil don't have a right but we're
[1:28:37] going to get rid of them unclean spirits
[1:28:40] glory glory glory there's still power in
[1:28:42] the word of god
[1:28:44] we also uh talked about there in
[1:28:46] capernaum there was a man
[1:28:48] uh who was uh in uh bondage he could not
[1:28:51] uh pick himself up and could not walk
[1:28:54] could not do anything but
[1:28:55] he heard that jesus was in town and and
[1:28:58] after all these different miracles was
[1:28:59] happening in capernaum
[1:29:01] you can imagine people's faith would
[1:29:03] begin to grow
[1:29:04] and this man had four friends that came
[1:29:06] and said you know what
[1:29:07] jesus is in town we're gonna take you to
[1:29:10] the service tonight the man was so
[1:29:12] excited
[1:29:13] i don't know how long he had been in his
[1:29:14] condition but the man was so excited he
[1:29:16] said i
[1:29:16] got to go to church it says now i can't
[1:29:18] get up and get myself dressed
[1:29:20] and go there but if y'all don't mind
[1:29:22] take me to where jesus is
[1:29:24] and those boys got grabbed the corner of
[1:29:26] the mat and each one carrying a corner
[1:29:29] four brothers brought them to the
[1:29:31] service and when they got there
[1:29:32] it was jam-packed my god it was standing
[1:29:36] room only
[1:29:36] and the man couldn't stand up he said he
[1:29:39] can't see me like this
[1:29:41] he can't do nothing for he don't even
[1:29:42] know i'm outside he said i got an idea
[1:29:46] glory to god say what's the idea my
[1:29:48] brother say take me up to the roof
[1:29:51] glory to god he said say what you gonna
[1:29:53] do to get up i'll tell you when we get
[1:29:54] there but just
[1:29:55] get me up to the roof they had to carry
[1:29:58] him up the stairs
[1:29:59] maybe try to squeeze between some people
[1:30:02] he said don't just stop at the stairs
[1:30:04] not take me to the roof
[1:30:06] hallelujah and when they got him to the
[1:30:08] roof he's saying now what next he's
[1:30:10] saying now
[1:30:11] uncover the roof take the stroll off the
[1:30:14] roof
[1:30:14] tear the roof off and then drop me down
[1:30:17] inside of his presence
[1:30:22] and when jesus looked up and saw the man
[1:30:24] coming down
[1:30:26] say what kind of faith is this it
[1:30:29] interrupted the service
[1:30:31] it changed the whole dynamics of
[1:30:33] everything that was going on
[1:30:34] jesus said what is this and then he
[1:30:38] shook everybody when he say your sins be
[1:30:40] forgiven
[1:30:43] [Music]
[1:30:44] this man said my sins i came here for
[1:30:47] healing
[1:30:48] know your sins be forgiven
[1:30:52] he had to say that for a reason because
[1:30:55] those religious leaders was there and
[1:30:56] they say now what kind of man is this
[1:30:59] only god can forgive sins why would he
[1:31:02] say something like that that your sins
[1:31:04] are forgiven
[1:31:05] and then jesus waited for them to to get
[1:31:08] that thought out
[1:31:09] hallelujah they didn't even have to
[1:31:11] stand in their mouth if they were
[1:31:12] thinking that he picked up the thought
[1:31:15] said he said he said i know what you
[1:31:17] think you want to know who can forgive
[1:31:19] sins only god can do it he's saying now
[1:31:20] would it be easier for the son of man to
[1:31:23] say your sons be
[1:31:24] your sins be forgiven or to say rise up
[1:31:26] and walk
[1:31:27] it say so that you know the son of man
[1:31:29] is here
[1:31:31] i say to you man rise up and walk
[1:31:35] and right there they begin to understand
[1:31:37] there was a dual atonement
[1:31:39] that was in christ the dual atonement
[1:31:42] of calvary was inside of christ he was
[1:31:45] not only wounded for our transgressions
[1:31:47] bruce weinick was the chastising of our
[1:31:49] pieces upon him with his christ with him
[1:31:51] but also at calvary we received our
[1:31:53] salvation
[1:31:56] he had to show this was in him in
[1:31:59] capernaum
[1:32:01] glory to god uh another thing is jesus
[1:32:04] was on his way
[1:32:05] there to capernaum again one day and
[1:32:07] there was a man that said look
[1:32:09] i'm not worthy that you come underneath
[1:32:12] my roof
[1:32:13] but if you would just speak the word
[1:32:15] only i know my servant will be made
[1:32:17] whole
[1:32:18] this centurion knew the power that was
[1:32:20] in
[1:32:21] omnipotence and what he was really
[1:32:23] saying is i speak
[1:32:24] omnipotence speak to my situation
[1:32:28] speak to my circumstance speak to my
[1:32:30] condition
[1:32:31] speak omnipotence jesus spoke to that
[1:32:35] spoke to the situation he found his
[1:32:37] servant healed
[1:32:39] at the very time that jesus spoke other
[1:32:41] thing i found about capernaum i didn't
[1:32:43] bring this to you but i was just as i
[1:32:45] was doing some research
[1:32:46] capernaum is where they needed taxes to
[1:32:49] be paid
[1:32:51] and jesus told peter go fishing and he
[1:32:54] would find a fish with
[1:32:55] some money in his mouth you wonder how
[1:32:58] did he hook the fish
[1:33:00] if the fish had money in his mouth
[1:33:03] fish really couldn't bite but it was a
[1:33:06] predestinated fish now i'm gonna tell
[1:33:08] you when we used to go fishing
[1:33:10] we used to have this what we call it the
[1:33:12] shiners or the sheds where they would
[1:33:14] run
[1:33:15] they don't bite but we get them
[1:33:18] we had a special hook with three prongs
[1:33:20] on it and we would drop that hook
[1:33:22] underneath
[1:33:23] amen the sheds and as they would run
[1:33:25] across our line we just
[1:33:26] jerk up and we would hook them in their
[1:33:28] stomachs
[1:33:30] glory to god they didn't have to bite we
[1:33:31] still get them hooked and i don't know
[1:33:33] how
[1:33:34] what peter's strategy was when he went
[1:33:36] fishing maybe he's out there just
[1:33:37] just jerking and all of a sudden he got
[1:33:39] something i got a bite
[1:33:41] no you can't have a bite if he got a
[1:33:43] coin in his mouth
[1:33:45] but you do got the fish that god
[1:33:47] predestinated
[1:33:48] for you to have because there was only
[1:33:50] one in there
[1:33:51] that thought he could swallow a coin
[1:33:58] and that one was there set for peter to
[1:34:01] pay taxes
[1:34:02] and you're sitting around wondering how
[1:34:04] you gonna pay taxes
[1:34:05] go fishing glory to god
[1:34:11] go fishing get that tax problem off your
[1:34:15] mind god go make a way out of nowhere
[1:34:22] there in capernaum they learned they
[1:34:23] paid taxes so many miracles but i i
[1:34:25] brought this point to you and i want to
[1:34:27] read it out of scripture matthew 11
[1:34:29] verse 23. because this also was in
[1:34:33] capernaum
[1:34:36] some of the miracles in the fifth
[1:34:37] junction
[1:34:40] here in matthew 11 23 it says and thou
[1:34:42] capernaum
[1:34:44] which are exalted unto heaven shall be
[1:34:47] brought down to hell
[1:34:49] for if the mighty works which have been
[1:34:52] done
[1:34:53] in thee have been done in sodom it would
[1:34:56] have remained
[1:34:57] until this day just keep that scripture
[1:35:00] there for a second i'd like to
[1:35:01] just refer back to an incident that i
[1:35:03] had you know i said that
[1:35:05] god is going to have a if he had a
[1:35:09] prophet at his first coming
[1:35:11] he's also going to have a prophet at his
[1:35:13] second coming one that
[1:35:15] with the specific uh ministry to
[1:35:18] introduce
[1:35:18] christ to the people john the baptist
[1:35:21] had that ministry
[1:35:22] glory to god and here the second coming
[1:35:24] we believe william branham has that had
[1:35:26] that ministry that god gave to introduce
[1:35:28] christ
[1:35:29] back to the back back back to his people
[1:35:31] now um
[1:35:34] you know different ones a few years ago
[1:35:36] began to pull away from the message
[1:35:38] because brother branham had prophesied
[1:35:39] in in los angeles it says uh
[1:35:43] um uh uh thou city of angels
[1:35:47] you're gonna be brought down just like
[1:35:49] capernaum
[1:35:51] it says repent los angeles and he was
[1:35:54] preaching the message to choose another
[1:35:55] bride
[1:35:56] and at the end of the sermon he he goes
[1:35:58] goes into this prophecy
[1:35:59] and he says shark shall be i mean wait
[1:36:01] no he didn't say it he say uh he says
[1:36:03] repent los angeles say
[1:36:04] you know you're going to be brought down
[1:36:06] into the sea just like capernaum
[1:36:08] so this one brother you know he
[1:36:09] approached me and it says the couple
[1:36:11] brothers they approached it now
[1:36:12] you know brother branham gave this
[1:36:13] prophecy but you know capernaum never
[1:36:15] went under the sea
[1:36:16] never i say you sure about that he said
[1:36:19] we couldn't find it
[1:36:20] never said okay give me a second or so
[1:36:23] give me just a just a day or so and i'll
[1:36:25] get back with you
[1:36:26] and i went and i found this scripture
[1:36:28] and thou capernaum which are exalted
[1:36:29] unto heaven shall be brought down to
[1:36:31] hell
[1:36:32] for if the mighty works which have been
[1:36:34] done in thee have had been done in sodom
[1:36:36] it would have remained until this day i
[1:36:37] say brother you say that capernaum never
[1:36:39] went under
[1:36:41] check this scripture and see if it's
[1:36:43] been fulfilled yet
[1:36:46] he went and checked that i say okay
[1:36:48] you're right
[1:36:49] because if he would have told me that
[1:36:52] that scripture was not fulfilled
[1:36:54] then he would have been telling me jesus
[1:36:57] is a liar
[1:37:00] that's what you would have been saying
[1:37:02] because you're kind you're trying to
[1:37:03] call his prophet a liar now you've gone
[1:37:05] another
[1:37:06] level now you're saying jesus is a liar
[1:37:09] and i want you to see you got a spirit
[1:37:10] on you if you're calling jesus a liar
[1:37:13] hallelujah somebody right so so i say
[1:37:16] now check it when he checked it he oh
[1:37:18] yeah i found it
[1:37:19] you're exactly right capernaum did fall
[1:37:20] i said well now if you gotta accept that
[1:37:23] then you gotta accept what the prophet
[1:37:24] said he said thou city
[1:37:26] of angels you'll be just like capernaum
[1:37:30] now recently an article came out
[1:37:33] it's a fox news article that says that
[1:37:36] there are
[1:37:36] sharks multiplying in great numbers on
[1:37:40] the coastline
[1:37:41] of california it's just all in the news
[1:37:44] sharks are multiplied they say it's
[1:37:46] happening so fast
[1:37:48] why you think they're there
[1:37:51] why are you thinking the sharks there
[1:37:54] glory to god
[1:37:57] in noah's day and those day animals were
[1:38:00] brought to an ark
[1:38:02] and in this day sharks why why they not
[1:38:04] multiplying on the coast of florida
[1:38:06] why california because there's a
[1:38:10] prophecy
[1:38:10] waiting for los angeles that it will go
[1:38:14] under a prophet said it he said thus
[1:38:17] saith the lord
[1:38:18] that same prophet told us 87
[1:38:21] years ago
[1:38:24] 87 years ago he said i see a great woman
[1:38:29] rising in power in the united states she
[1:38:32] will either be
[1:38:33] president or vice president a prophet
[1:38:37] spoken 87
[1:38:38] years ago and when this when this
[1:38:41] happened people had no idea
[1:38:43] prophecy was actually being fulfilled
[1:38:46] and i need to let you know some your
[1:38:47] vote cannot stop a prophecy
[1:38:52] you're standing on the street corners
[1:38:54] with signs in your hand ain't gonna stop
[1:38:56] prophecy
[1:38:59] no matter how upset you get when god has
[1:39:01] spoke something it's got to come to pass
[1:39:03] and you don't realize everything was
[1:39:05] just being set up
[1:39:07] just being set up set up set up
[1:39:09] hallelujah god was a great chess player
[1:39:12] moving this and moving that and making
[1:39:14] this making the whole nation upset
[1:39:16] not just this nation nations people
[1:39:18] ain't got nothing to do with the us
[1:39:20] they mad about everything going on in
[1:39:23] the nation
[1:39:24] hallelujah god moving those chest pla on
[1:39:27] those chest pieces
[1:39:28] the tender hand of jehovah making his
[1:39:30] word come to pass
[1:39:32] and the people don't realize they are in
[1:39:33] the end time spirit
[1:39:35] i'm going further in this all right
[1:39:39] this next junction with here at that six
[1:39:41] junction
[1:39:42] brother branham say martin luther and
[1:39:44] john wesley
[1:39:46] was the junction and the last junction
[1:39:48] of seventh we will get to is the second
[1:39:50] coming of christ
[1:39:51] but today i want to deal with this this
[1:39:53] six junction
[1:39:54] now um i want to
[1:39:58] uh say something here
[1:40:03] martin luther and john wesley
[1:40:07] the prophet calls them reformers because
[1:40:09] they could not take the church back to
[1:40:11] the full word
[1:40:13] however we're going to discover
[1:40:16] that they're also identified as prophets
[1:40:20] because of the role they played in the
[1:40:21] full restoration of the church
[1:40:24] right and uh these were stars in the
[1:40:26] hands of jesus according to revelation
[1:40:28] 1.
[1:40:30] um uh i want to read here out of
[1:40:32] revelation 5.
[1:40:34] if yeah i think i got that uh revelation
[1:40:37] five
[1:40:38] uh i wanna show you that they're also um
[1:40:43] there's seven eyes on the lamb
[1:40:46] on the horns of the lamb and an
[1:40:49] eye is a seer glory to god so they had
[1:40:53] to be able to see
[1:40:54] something amen martin luther john wesley
[1:40:57] had to be able to see something uh and i
[1:41:00] will pick him up
[1:41:01] here in a little bit this is church
[1:41:03] history that we're getting into right
[1:41:04] now
[1:41:05] uh but this was a junction in church
[1:41:09] and christendom let me put it that way
[1:41:11] this was this was very something it was
[1:41:12] something very significant
[1:41:14] to get us to where we are right now if
[1:41:16] these things had not
[1:41:18] have happened we wouldn't be where we
[1:41:19] are right now like like brother troy was
[1:41:21] saying earlier
[1:41:22] you know when brother brother brother
[1:41:23] wesko went to new york and
[1:41:25] and heard this message uh it's no way
[1:41:28] that any of us would be here right now
[1:41:31] had he not done what he did i thank god
[1:41:34] he had a thirst in him
[1:41:36] him and sister wesker had a thirst to go
[1:41:38] find something greater
[1:41:40] and they found it and it has changed my
[1:41:44] life
[1:41:46] glory to god i'm grateful for amen my
[1:41:48] father in the gospel
[1:41:50] hallelujah thank god for him
[1:41:53] amen he went through much criticism
[1:41:56] [Applause]
[1:41:58] i mean people still don't understand but
[1:41:59] my life has been impacted by that
[1:42:01] decision
[1:42:02] because he brought truth back here glory
[1:42:05] to god and think
[1:42:06] think about the domino effect right but
[1:42:09] by by that impact of my life god was
[1:42:11] then later
[1:42:12] on in my life able to call me to the
[1:42:14] pastoral role
[1:42:15] and then through through this role i'm
[1:42:17] able to pack other people's lives
[1:42:19] it's a domino effect now now that you
[1:42:21] being impacted you got to go and pack
[1:42:23] somebody else's life
[1:42:25] glory to god here in in revelation 5
[1:42:28] uh verse verse 5 and 6
[1:42:32] says this glory glory glory glory
[1:42:36] says in one of the elders saith unto me
[1:42:38] weep not behold the lion of the tribe of
[1:42:40] judah
[1:42:40] the root of david hath prevailed to open
[1:42:43] the book and to loose the seven seals
[1:42:45] thereof
[1:42:45] and i beheld him low in the midst of the
[1:42:48] throne and of the four beasts and in the
[1:42:49] midst of the elder stood a
[1:42:51] lamb as it had been slain now
[1:42:54] brother branham tells us clearly this
[1:42:56] was not a physical lamb
[1:42:58] amen i noticed notice the the the way
[1:43:01] it's described the way john john
[1:43:02] describes a lamb
[1:43:03] as it had been slain this was christ
[1:43:05] right as i've been saying
[1:43:07] having seven horns a horns
[1:43:10] is the lamb's protection glory to god
[1:43:14] the horns
[1:43:15] are the lamb's protection and i was
[1:43:17] teaching on this this week amen
[1:43:19] and what we find out is that the horns
[1:43:21] represent the churches in the church
[1:43:23] ages
[1:43:24] we are the lamb's protection not only
[1:43:27] does the lamb protect us but we protect
[1:43:29] him
[1:43:30] because we choose to live this word in
[1:43:32] this dark
[1:43:33] hour the horns right so so here say
[1:43:37] the seven i uh uh having having seven
[1:43:39] horns and
[1:43:40] seven eyes now each horn had an eye
[1:43:43] and what an eye there is therefore is to
[1:43:46] see
[1:43:47] glory to god it's a prophetic anointing
[1:43:50] that comes upon somebody
[1:43:52] so that they can see the word and
[1:43:53] present it to the people glory to god
[1:43:56] that prophetic anointing came upon
[1:43:58] luther
[1:43:59] when he said the just shall live by
[1:44:02] faith
[1:44:03] that prophetic anointed allowed him to
[1:44:05] see certain things that was wrong in the
[1:44:06] catholic church
[1:44:08] luther says no way amen y'all can keep
[1:44:10] charging people to go to heaven
[1:44:12] there's no such thing as as purgatory
[1:44:15] and none of this
[1:44:15] he'd say these things are not in
[1:44:17] scripture luther start first declaring
[1:44:19] it from his pulpit
[1:44:21] he start preaching it but it wasn't
[1:44:22] enough in his church to just share it
[1:44:25] in his church he needed to impact the
[1:44:27] world with this
[1:44:28] so he sat down and he wrote himself 95
[1:44:31] thesis
[1:44:32] and i love this because on october 31st
[1:44:36] in the 1500s luther went to the catholic
[1:44:39] church door
[1:44:40] with his letter in his hand signed by
[1:44:42] him 95 theses coming against the
[1:44:44] catholic church and all their
[1:44:46] false teachings he came against it
[1:44:48] praise god
[1:44:49] never to the catholic church towards say
[1:44:50] on this i stand
[1:44:54] you know luther didn't realize what he
[1:44:57] might have been doing at that time but
[1:44:58] god had anointed him get put that spirit
[1:45:01] on him to do
[1:45:02] that and it began to set the set of
[1:45:04] change and i'm going to show you
[1:45:05] something in the scripture here in a
[1:45:06] second
[1:45:06] let me just finish reading this uh the
[1:45:09] seven horns seven eyes which are the
[1:45:10] seven spirits of god sent forth unto all
[1:45:12] the earth
[1:45:13] the seven eyes are the seven spirits
[1:45:15] what happened is god
[1:45:16] according to revelation 1 chose seven
[1:45:20] men to come at seven different times in
[1:45:23] history
[1:45:23] to impact this world
[1:45:27] hallelujah the first one that came was
[1:45:29] paul right here on this chart
[1:45:31] the next one was iranians the next one
[1:45:33] was martin we got the years that they
[1:45:35] came
[1:45:36] right uh uh columba he came and then we
[1:45:39] see
[1:45:39] luther wesley branham
[1:45:43] hallelujah i want to show you that this
[1:45:45] was this this
[1:45:46] we're not a church just sitting here
[1:45:48] just to be here
[1:45:49] we're here we come back to the fullness
[1:45:51] of the word
[1:45:52] we're not just an alternative to some
[1:45:54] denomination i was listening to a
[1:45:56] brother
[1:45:57] break this down he say there are 45 000
[1:46:00] different denominations underneath the
[1:46:02] name christianity
[1:46:04] how you know which one is right 45
[1:46:08] 000 and everybody say they believe
[1:46:10] christ god
[1:46:12] never intended for his word to get in
[1:46:14] that condition
[1:46:16] somebody went off somewhere this is why
[1:46:18] god had to send a prophet
[1:46:20] to bring us back to truth look at this
[1:46:24] so so here we see luther wesley and
[1:46:26] branham these were seven stars in the
[1:46:28] seven hands of jesus y'all just let me
[1:46:30] just teach for a little bit
[1:46:31] but these are seven stars that were in
[1:46:33] the hand their ministries were
[1:46:35] sent here by jesus they were anointed
[1:46:40] by jesus to do the things that they did
[1:46:43] they had the supernatural following
[1:46:45] their ministries but the supernatural
[1:46:47] was
[1:46:47] only to get the people's attention
[1:46:51] once god got their attention through the
[1:46:53] set but supernatural
[1:46:54] then god could share his word
[1:46:59] perfect word hallelujah
[1:47:03] you know and and i don't have time to
[1:47:05] get all this day but i'm gonna get a
[1:47:06] little bit of
[1:47:07] in wesley's day the bible talks about it
[1:47:09] call it the open
[1:47:10] door the age of the open door
[1:47:14] what was open the revelation of baptism
[1:47:17] in the name of the lord jesus christ was
[1:47:19] being restored to the church
[1:47:21] that's been lost over the day over the
[1:47:23] years churches today still
[1:47:25] battle oh we might as well talk about it
[1:47:29] churches battle on which way to baptize
[1:47:32] jesus said baptized in the name of the
[1:47:35] father
[1:47:36] and of the son and of the holy ghost
[1:47:38] that's exactly
[1:47:39] what jesus said but ten days
[1:47:42] after jesus said it hallelujah i don't
[1:47:45] know if peter was that far off
[1:47:48] peter goes ten days late and says be
[1:47:51] baptized in the name
[1:47:53] of the lord jesus christ and the church
[1:47:56] is still
[1:47:56] trying to figure this one out they say
[1:47:58] peter was wrong
[1:48:00] and god let him put it in the scripture
[1:48:05] peter was wrong and locked god let him
[1:48:07] put it in the scripture and then when we
[1:48:09] look at scripture we find
[1:48:10] nobody ever baptized
[1:48:14] in the name of the father and of the son
[1:48:16] and of the holy ghost but in the book of
[1:48:18] acts
[1:48:19] everybody baptized in the name of the
[1:48:20] lord jesus christ
[1:48:22] now nobody pick up your bible and
[1:48:26] show me where one person was ever
[1:48:28] baptized that way
[1:48:30] in the name of the father son and holy
[1:48:32] ghost
[1:48:34] even though jesus said it nobody ever
[1:48:36] did it
[1:48:37] what happened here why would peter 10
[1:48:40] days after jesus say it
[1:48:41] going baptized in the name of the father
[1:48:43] son the holy ghost now i need you to
[1:48:44] understand i mean in the name of the
[1:48:46] lord jesus christ i need to understand
[1:48:47] this teaching got away from the church
[1:48:50] this teaching is still away from the
[1:48:52] church
[1:48:52] oh glory to god hallelujah but in this
[1:48:55] hour
[1:48:55] the open door of the revelation came
[1:48:58] back into the church
[1:48:59] now what happened with peter let's just
[1:49:01] finish this up
[1:49:02] peter understood something by revelation
[1:49:05] he said he said now jesus told us
[1:49:07] baptized in the name of the father
[1:49:09] and of the son and of the holy ghost but
[1:49:12] i'm telling these people you baptize the
[1:49:14] name of the lord jesus christ
[1:49:15] peter understood the name of the son
[1:49:20] i'm sharing that with you first peter
[1:49:22] understood the name of the son he walked
[1:49:24] with him
[1:49:24] he slept with him he talked with him
[1:49:27] amen
[1:49:28] he he cast out devils with them he did
[1:49:30] all
[1:49:31] he knew who the son was he said the son
[1:49:33] is the lord jesus christ
[1:49:35] it said now if the son is the lord jesus
[1:49:37] if the name of the son
[1:49:40] oh i hope you get that the name of the
[1:49:43] son not just in amen the name of the son
[1:49:46] is the lord jesus christ so they say
[1:49:47] well i also know who the name of the
[1:49:49] father is
[1:49:49] because he told me when we seen him
[1:49:52] we've seen the father
[1:49:53] so the name of the father is lord jesus
[1:49:56] christ the name of the son
[1:49:58] is lord jesus christ the name of the
[1:50:00] spirit that was in jesus christ said
[1:50:02] when i go away i'm going to send you the
[1:50:03] comforter
[1:50:04] my spirit that's the spirit of the lord
[1:50:07] jesus christ
[1:50:10] peter said i know his name now not just
[1:50:12] not just titles we're not baptizing in
[1:50:14] titles
[1:50:15] i'm baptizing in the name and you had to
[1:50:17] catch the revelation of his name
[1:50:20] his name is lord jesus christ
[1:50:24] why is it that we cast out devils
[1:50:28] in his name but can't be baptized in it
[1:50:32] i'm talking about when you're really
[1:50:34] going through in the name of jesus you
[1:50:36] are not using in the name of the father
[1:50:38] in the name of the son in the name of
[1:50:40] you are not saying things like that
[1:50:42] you say in the name of jesus
[1:50:47] there's power in his name so you see
[1:50:50] look
[1:50:50] look look we got to understand those
[1:50:52] titles were just that's all they were
[1:50:54] peter caught the revelation of what it
[1:50:56] was like like me i'm
[1:50:58] i'm a father my mama's sitting here i'm
[1:51:01] a son
[1:51:03] my brother's sitting here i'm a brother
[1:51:05] i'm a brother-in-law
[1:51:07] right uh uh uh i mean i'm a pastor
[1:51:12] glory to god all those are titles if you
[1:51:14] go down somewhere and say
[1:51:15] my pastor sent me well who is your
[1:51:17] pastor
[1:51:18] that's the quest who's your pat my
[1:51:20] pastor there's a lot of pastors in the
[1:51:22] past in the plaza
[1:51:25] which one you gonna have to give the
[1:51:28] people
[1:51:29] oh hallelujah give them the name
[1:51:32] if you want something to get done you
[1:51:34] better call the name
[1:51:36] you can't use the title to get nothing
[1:51:38] done but you got to use the name
[1:51:41] and if we want to see something done by
[1:51:44] god we got to use his name
[1:51:46] his name is lord jesus christ
[1:51:51] that's why peter did that that's why
[1:51:55] peter said that
[1:51:56] and the church got away from using the
[1:51:59] name for years but in the
[1:52:00] in in in wesley's day the philadelphia
[1:52:03] and church age i'm
[1:52:03] gonna get to that maybe next week but in
[1:52:05] the philadelphia church that name began
[1:52:07] to be restored
[1:52:09] and i'm gonna tell you right now i'm
[1:52:11] gonna i'm just be honest with you
[1:52:12] i've only found churches that baptize
[1:52:16] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:52:18] those only church is really able to hold
[1:52:20] to a holiness standard
[1:52:25] there there there there there's some um
[1:52:29] some some apostolics that baptize the
[1:52:32] name of the lord jesus christ and they
[1:52:34] hold to a holiness standard
[1:52:35] now there's some other apostolics that
[1:52:37] ain't ain't doing that
[1:52:40] amen glory to god they're not holding to
[1:52:42] a whole understanding but it's usually
[1:52:43] people that's baptized
[1:52:45] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:52:46] they still got that there's a whole
[1:52:47] there's something connected there
[1:52:50] right something connected and i need you
[1:52:52] to understand that that revelation was
[1:52:54] restored
[1:52:56] and now when we baptize and and i want
[1:52:59] to encourage if you have not been
[1:53:00] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[1:53:02] christ
[1:53:02] i want to encourage you to do that we'll
[1:53:05] baptize you right away if you want to
[1:53:06] get baptized we'll baptize you right
[1:53:08] away
[1:53:09] the scripture tells you that peter gave
[1:53:10] him on on the day of pentecost he says
[1:53:12] repent that's the first thing repent
[1:53:14] tell god you're sorry for every sin that
[1:53:15] you ever committed
[1:53:16] you have a personal talk with your god
[1:53:19] lord i repent i'm sorry
[1:53:21] ask him to come into your heart and and
[1:53:22] make a difference in your life
[1:53:24] right lord i'm sorry for the sins that
[1:53:26] i've committed and i can't do this on my
[1:53:27] own
[1:53:28] i need you to come into my heart and
[1:53:30] make a difference
[1:53:31] and then he says be baptized in the name
[1:53:33] of the lord jesus christ
[1:53:35] and then after you've done what god told
[1:53:37] you to say then you shall be
[1:53:38] filled with the gift of the holy ghost
[1:53:41] and not only that not only it won't just
[1:53:43] stop with you if you get things right
[1:53:46] he said his promise is unto you and to
[1:53:48] your children
[1:53:50] those that are far off as many as the
[1:53:51] lord our god shall call
[1:53:53] your children will be covered if you
[1:53:55] would get right
[1:53:59] all right let me read a little bit
[1:54:03] junction of time paragraph e46 and i
[1:54:06] want to come to a couple other
[1:54:07] scriptures here in a second
[1:54:09] this is important so important what
[1:54:12] happened here
[1:54:13] amen and uh in the ministries of
[1:54:15] lutheran the ministries of
[1:54:16] wesley so important to christendom it
[1:54:19] sets us up for where we are right now do
[1:54:21] you realize before luther nailed the 95
[1:54:23] thesis
[1:54:24] you were either catholic or you were
[1:54:26] dead
[1:54:29] if you if you did not if you did not
[1:54:31] follow catholicism they would kill you
[1:54:35] but luther protested that's how he
[1:54:38] became protestants
[1:54:39] because he protested what the catholic
[1:54:41] church was teaching
[1:54:42] knowledge that he protested but he lived
[1:54:44] through the protests
[1:54:46] hallelujah anybody there was many others
[1:54:48] rose up during that time protests and a
[1:54:50] lot of them lost their lives but there
[1:54:51] was an anointing on luther
[1:54:53] he was a star in the hands of jesus for
[1:54:56] the fifth church age
[1:54:58] all right look at this this this quote
[1:55:00] says what happened signs and wonders
[1:55:02] took place
[1:55:04] what happened the moon began to cry the
[1:55:07] sun closed its eyes and began to weep
[1:55:08] and it went
[1:55:09] in such distress until it had
[1:55:11] convulsions and turned like dripping
[1:55:13] blood
[1:55:14] sure it did when it seen the creator of
[1:55:16] heaven and earth refused by the earth
[1:55:18] and so much sin
[1:55:19] he couldn't get into heaven and dying as
[1:55:22] a mediator between god and man stand
[1:55:23] between heavens and earth the sun
[1:55:25] the sun couldn't stand it said i will
[1:55:28] not shine no more
[1:55:30] the stars i can't look at this
[1:55:34] here nature is having a problem with our
[1:55:36] savior being on the cross
[1:55:38] it says the earth said i can't stand it
[1:55:41] and it had a nervous prostration and
[1:55:43] belch forth rocks out of the earth
[1:55:45] the the the miraculous took place so
[1:55:47] he's talking about an earthquake that
[1:55:48] took place at the time jesus
[1:55:50] you know was dying since then miraculous
[1:55:51] took place it was the end of the road
[1:55:54] sin had rained until the cross
[1:55:58] i thank god for that sin had rain until
[1:56:02] the cross this was a junction
[1:56:03] right but sin was paid for there oh my
[1:56:06] the earth
[1:56:07] shook so hard till it throw rocks out of
[1:56:10] its ground
[1:56:11] and hung it into the heels amen even
[1:56:14] shook so hard to the dead
[1:56:16] rose out of the grave talk about a
[1:56:18] nervous prostration
[1:56:20] and the sun began to have convulsions
[1:56:22] and went out
[1:56:23] miraculous took place hallelujah
[1:56:26] always does at the junction look
[1:56:30] what taken place with uh with that and
[1:56:33] that was the
[1:56:34] that was only preparing for this think
[1:56:36] about all of that now
[1:56:38] think about everything we just talked
[1:56:39] about at jesus death that was only
[1:56:41] preparing
[1:56:42] for this he says uh they went
[1:56:45] out into the dark ages now now now just
[1:56:48] just
[1:56:48] you know follow with me on this on this
[1:56:50] little chart here that i have to my
[1:56:52] right
[1:56:53] praise god paul uh in his day it was a
[1:56:56] lot of light
[1:56:56] the gospel showing that it was a lot of
[1:56:58] light the truth of the gospel going
[1:57:00] forth
[1:57:00] and they were walking and that just a
[1:57:02] little sliver of darkness
[1:57:03] first age paul was the first messenger
[1:57:05] then an iranians comes then you can see
[1:57:07] a little bit more darkness coming in
[1:57:09] false teachings
[1:57:10] right a little bit more darkness they
[1:57:11] have they're still walking in a little
[1:57:13] light but a little bit more darkness
[1:57:14] then you get the pergamus where martin
[1:57:16] is
[1:57:16] there's even some more darkness comes in
[1:57:19] right
[1:57:19] and just a little light when you get to
[1:57:21] columbus the fourth church age
[1:57:23] that actually was what was considered
[1:57:25] the dark ages notice it's
[1:57:27] very very dark in columbus just a little
[1:57:30] bit of light there
[1:57:31] that was even in history it's called the
[1:57:33] dark ages
[1:57:34] hallelujah but after at 1500 years of
[1:57:37] darkness now here comes
[1:57:39] luther and he begins to add a little bit
[1:57:40] more light the just shall live by faith
[1:57:43] and all this this stuff that y'all
[1:57:44] teaching catholic church is wrong
[1:57:46] it's against the word of god he said i'm
[1:57:49] going back to
[1:57:49] the just shall live by faith not by all
[1:57:51] these things that y'all got people doing
[1:57:53] in church
[1:57:54] hallelujah a little bit of light began
[1:57:56] to come back when luther came on the
[1:57:58] scene
[1:57:58] i want to tell you right then
[1:57:59] restoration of what was lost from the
[1:58:02] days of paul
[1:58:03] the restoration began to come back in
[1:58:05] now luther couldn't take us all the way
[1:58:07] back
[1:58:08] hallelujah was still baptized in the
[1:58:09] name of father son and holy ghost
[1:58:11] right he didn't have the full truth but
[1:58:13] then wesley comes along
[1:58:14] and that revelation of baptizing the
[1:58:16] name of the lord jesus christ is coming
[1:58:18] back into the church
[1:58:19] and they're fighting to keep that
[1:58:20] revelation and then finally we get to
[1:58:23] this
[1:58:23] age the latest in age now this is a very
[1:58:26] dark age
[1:58:27] brother brandon when he first drew this
[1:58:28] i want to tell you i'm not just
[1:58:30] teaching that and just putting that on
[1:58:31] the wall just to have something i want
[1:58:33] to tell you an experience
[1:58:35] brother branham taught this at his
[1:58:37] church
[1:58:38] taught drew up the chart like this on a
[1:58:40] white board
[1:58:42] a blackboard and uh and and taught it to
[1:58:44] his church
[1:58:45] at the end of the service when he
[1:58:48] finished
[1:58:49] talking about this agenda when not when
[1:58:51] he talked about it
[1:58:52] he did not put branham in the name up
[1:58:55] there the way i put
[1:58:56] brother devin is the one built this
[1:58:58] brother devon put branham
[1:58:59] he put malachi 4 i believe is what he
[1:59:03] put there just malachi
[1:59:04] because that's where the promise of this
[1:59:06] come but but we understand my
[1:59:07] revelations brother branham
[1:59:08] when he when he drew this out of this
[1:59:10] church do you realize at the end of him
[1:59:12] teaching this
[1:59:13] the angel of god came into the church to
[1:59:17] the back wall of the church
[1:59:18] and drew the whole thing on the back
[1:59:21] wall
[1:59:22] supernaturally now let me ask you
[1:59:25] wouldn't you want to know something
[1:59:26] about if god vindicating that way when
[1:59:28] you want to know what was in that book
[1:59:32] how many other books is the angel
[1:59:33] writing on the back wall of a church
[1:59:36] that's why we quote the church ages
[1:59:37] around here god supernaturally
[1:59:39] vindicated that this was truth
[1:59:42] now let me keep reading
[1:59:45] they went out into the dark ages 1500
[1:59:47] years
[1:59:48] wish we had time but we're pressed i
[1:59:50] want to get
[1:59:51] out at 12 and uh says coming through
[1:59:54] there in the darkness
[1:59:55] wish we had time to go into into the
[1:59:57] time what happened in the time of wesley
[1:59:59] and luther
[2:00:00] that sixth time that there was a change
[2:00:03] come
[2:00:04] when the church was liberated from
[2:00:06] darkness
[2:00:08] and and was brought into the marvelous
[2:00:10] light of the gospel
[2:00:11] again we need the church god got people
[2:00:15] in church bound but the church needs to
[2:00:20] be
[2:00:20] liberated so that they can see the truth
[2:00:23] of the word of god
[2:00:25] oh it takes more than just a spirit side
[2:00:29] you want to worship both in spirit and
[2:00:32] in truth
[2:00:33] you got to have a revelation of why you
[2:00:35] worship see at the beginning
[2:00:37] abel had a revelation of why he
[2:00:39] worshipped cain did not have that
[2:00:41] revelation
[2:00:42] even though it was given the cain he
[2:00:44] still didn't have it
[2:00:45] look at this let me keep going signs and
[2:00:47] wonders
[2:00:48] oh god how i know men stood and divine
[2:00:51] healing and signs and wonders took place
[2:00:53] is between the sacrifice and the second
[2:00:55] coming and look what taken place then
[2:00:57] when john wesley preached the gospel he
[2:00:59] was kicked out of churches and things
[2:01:01] and people until people fell in the
[2:01:03] floor and they poured water in their
[2:01:04] face
[2:01:05] and john wesley's day the holy ghost
[2:01:07] began to slay people in the spirit
[2:01:09] john wesley's teaching go to methodist
[2:01:12] church today
[2:01:16] there is no slain in the spirit there's
[2:01:19] none of that
[2:01:20] but this happened in john what the holy
[2:01:22] ghost began to come back into the church
[2:01:24] a restoration began to happen until we
[2:01:27] got to pentecost and
[2:01:28] and a sousa street and what happened at
[2:01:30] asusa street what a
[2:01:32] wonderful wonderful restoration of the
[2:01:34] gifts of the spirit back in the church
[2:01:36] but you know they couldn't even keep it
[2:01:37] right
[2:01:39] they they got their division happening
[2:01:42] at
[2:01:42] souza street the the you had you had the
[2:01:45] church of god weren't going in one
[2:01:46] direction
[2:01:47] and um the assemblies of god
[2:01:51] church of god went one way as simply as
[2:01:53] god went the other way
[2:01:54] it's the truth anyhow divided
[2:01:58] on a line a racial line
[2:02:03] and the holy ghost don't divide on
[2:02:05] racial lines
[2:02:06] it's the truth anyhow oh my
[2:02:10] my my my my i thank god to come back to
[2:02:14] the truth
[2:02:15] i i i i i i i i i've said it before and
[2:02:18] i'll say it again this is not an
[2:02:19] ethnic church
[2:02:23] i go to a black church no you don't
[2:02:26] you go to god's church this this this
[2:02:30] church has come back to the truth
[2:02:32] god don't look at our colors like that
[2:02:34] we look at colors like that
[2:02:36] and i'm gonna tell you even kids put
[2:02:38] them on a playground
[2:02:40] little children put them on a playground
[2:02:42] together
[2:02:43] they don't look at any of that that
[2:02:46] stuff is taught to people
[2:02:49] but the holy ghost got to get that out
[2:02:51] of you
[2:02:52] praise god we recognize god and each
[2:02:58] other

[2:05:36] holding up a sign with you
[2:05:38] with your name and you know to go to
[2:05:39] that person but this one they had they
[2:05:41] had my name
[2:05:43] you understand i'm identified with the
[2:05:46] truth
[2:05:47] i seen my name when john saw his name
[2:05:51] everything in heaven heard him shouting
[2:05:54] and
[2:05:54] screaming when we see our name when the
[2:05:57] truth has been made known to
[2:05:59] us hallelujah

[2:06:07] world
[2:06:09] anywhere in the world i can go like that
[2:06:12] thank god for this truth that he's
[2:06:14] restored luther was the beginning of
[2:06:17] that let me just read a little bit about
[2:06:19] him and
[2:06:19] and i'll i'll bring this to a close
[2:06:21] today um
[2:06:24] oh my i had a scripture that i wanted to
[2:06:26] read but i first let me just tell you
[2:06:28] this the first three ages
[2:06:30] ephesus smyrna pergamos
[2:06:33] and also thiatera the four first four
[2:06:36] ages
[2:06:36] was the open door to the false vine that
[2:06:38] means open door to false revelation
[2:06:41] but in the last three ages luther wesley
[2:06:44] and william branham
[2:06:45] that was the open door to the truth
[2:06:47] being restored
[2:06:48] right and so what what happened in
[2:06:50] luther's ministry was actually the
[2:06:52] beginning
[2:06:53] of truth coming back to the church now
[2:06:57] i'll i'll have to save that scripture
[2:06:59] for next week i won't worry about it now
[2:07:02] let's read revelation 3 1-6 i'll show
[2:07:05] you where this
[2:07:05] is all of this is in in the bible i'm
[2:07:09] not just making this up
[2:07:11] but this is luther's day the church of
[2:07:13] sardis
[2:07:14] luther was the angel or the messenger
[2:07:17] to the church of sardis
[2:07:21] sorry this means aim that relax
[2:07:24] right oh no no no no no no that's
[2:07:27] ephesus
[2:07:28] i think england sardis was um
[2:07:31] oh my forget now but i know it talked
[2:07:34] about uh people that were in slavery
[2:07:37] and uh they were coming out they were
[2:07:39] coming out of that that slave slave type
[2:07:41] condition i forget i'll get that for you
[2:07:43] but uh but here
[2:07:44] it says and unto the angel of the church
[2:07:46] and sardis right
[2:07:48] this is writing to luther these things
[2:07:51] saith
[2:07:52] he that have the seven spirits of god
[2:07:55] it was the same it was the same spirit
[2:07:57] manifested seven different times upon
[2:07:58] seven different men
[2:08:00] seven angels to the seven churches seven
[2:08:02] messengers all those sevens
[2:08:04] uh makes makes it a complete work from
[2:08:06] god
[2:08:07] and the seven stars and i know thy works
[2:08:10] that thou
[2:08:10] has a name that thou livest in our dead
[2:08:12] now why do they have a name that they
[2:08:14] live but we're dead
[2:08:16] the name that they live is that they
[2:08:18] broke away from catholicism
[2:08:20] and then the lutheran now luther did not
[2:08:22] start the lutheran church
[2:08:24] it was the people that came after luther
[2:08:26] that started the lutheran church
[2:08:27] but he broke away he had an anointing to
[2:08:29] break away from catholicism
[2:08:31] when they went back into denomination
[2:08:33] that's when they died again
[2:08:36] you understand and when we go back into
[2:08:38] denominational thinking that's where we
[2:08:40] die
[2:08:41] once god sets us free from
[2:08:42] denominational thinking we want to stay
[2:08:44] free
[2:08:45] hallelujah glory to god look at this he
[2:08:48] says
[2:08:48] i know thy works that thou hast the name
[2:08:50] thou livest and are dead
[2:08:52] be watchful and strengthen the things
[2:08:54] which remain
[2:08:56] that are ready to die for i have not
[2:08:59] found our works perfect
[2:09:01] before god you got to be you got to be
[2:09:04] on your feet watch watch
[2:09:05] the devil always got something trying to
[2:09:07] trick you with so be watchful
[2:09:09] and strengthen the things that remain i
[2:09:11] if i can just get that to
[2:09:12] somebody there's something that still
[2:09:14] remains strengthen that
[2:09:17] then you come out of that condition that
[2:09:18] you're in it says remember therefore
[2:09:21] how that has received and hurt and hold
[2:09:24] fast
[2:09:25] brother brother brother brother troy
[2:09:27] told us that a few weeks ago hold fast
[2:09:29] right it says hold fast and repent if
[2:09:31] therefore thou shalt not watch i will
[2:09:33] come on thee as a thief
[2:09:34] and thou shalt not know that hour i will
[2:09:37] come upon thee
[2:09:38] thou hast a few names even in sardis
[2:09:41] which have not defiled their garments
[2:09:43] and they shall walk with me in white for
[2:09:46] they are worthy now those few names are
[2:09:48] people that decide to live right live
[2:09:50] holy
[2:09:51] don't get your garment spotted by the
[2:09:54] things of the world
[2:09:55] amen he says he that overcometh the same
[2:09:58] shall be clothed in white raiment and i
[2:10:00] will not blot out his name
[2:10:01] out of the book of life i will confess
[2:10:03] his name before my father and before his
[2:10:05] angels
[2:10:05] he the hath and they let him hear with
[2:10:07] the spirit saith unto the churches and i
[2:10:08] want you to notice that
[2:10:10] the sp in this in this passage of
[2:10:12] scripture revelation two and three it
[2:10:13] always ended
[2:10:15] he the half an ear let him hear with the
[2:10:16] spirit saith unto the churches god was
[2:10:18] speaking
[2:10:19] to the true church and to the false
[2:10:21] church
[2:10:22] they're both churches it started in the
[2:10:24] garden of eden
[2:10:25] abel had a true church cain had a false
[2:10:28] church
[2:10:28] and once you recognize i'm gonna tell
[2:10:30] you how easy it is for you to recognize
[2:10:32] me in the false church
[2:10:33] if it's a denomination out of the 45 000
[2:10:38] false why
[2:10:41] why why because they won't accept the
[2:10:43] fullness of the word of god
[2:10:45] and that's why jesus said in the last
[2:10:47] church age it says i stand at the door
[2:10:50] and knock i need you to get this it
[2:10:52] wasn't just an invitation
[2:10:54] to come into your heart personally jesus
[2:10:56] is trying to say

[2:11:02] y'all i don't know if we get it jesus
[2:11:05] has been kicked out of his own the
[2:11:08] church that he died for

[2:12:44] some people say boy didn't he preach
[2:12:50] that's what you call preaching
[2:12:59] it's a shame where the church is today
[2:13:02] thank god we've come out let me read
[2:13:05] just these last few quotes and i'll end
[2:13:06] it here i'm in the sardisian age
[2:13:10] oh my reason age it's recorded
[2:13:14] of dr martin luther and soros history
[2:13:16] volume 3 page 406 that he was a prophet
[2:13:19] evangelist speaker in tongues
[2:13:21] interpreter and one person endowed with
[2:13:23] all
[2:13:24] nine nine gifts of the spirit luther
[2:13:28] endowed with all nine gifts of spirit
[2:13:30] there was a time that luth was preaching
[2:13:31] in the catholic church and he said i
[2:13:33] wasn't even
[2:13:33] saved i wasn't even a christian but
[2:13:36] standing behind a pulpit preacher
[2:13:38] now i want to tell you something there's
[2:13:39] many preachers standing behind the
[2:13:41] pulpit right now
[2:13:42] not even saved
[2:13:46] but luther recognized it and he came to
[2:13:48] sense with it
[2:13:49] he came to grips with it we need some
[2:13:51] other folk to come to grips with it
[2:13:52] says what stirred his heart by the holy
[2:13:56] ghost and which was
[2:13:57] the little green shoot that signified
[2:13:59] that truth was coming back to the church
[2:14:01] as it was known at pentecost
[2:14:03] was the doctrine of justification
[2:14:04] salvation by grace apart from works
[2:14:07] i recognize that dr luther did not
[2:14:10] believe only and preach only
[2:14:11] justification
[2:14:12] but that was his major theme as indeed
[2:14:15] it had to be
[2:14:16] for that is the basic doctrine of the
[2:14:18] truth of the word and what that is
[2:14:20] the just shall live by faith and brother
[2:14:22] branham using the title of justification
[2:14:24] you need to understand if you have sin
[2:14:27] if you have walked away from the blood
[2:14:31] once you repent there is nothing
[2:14:35] against you when you repent
[2:14:40] when you repent you know what
[2:14:41] justification is is just as
[2:14:43] if you never did it
[2:14:49] once you repent preach only
[2:14:52] justification but that was his major
[2:14:53] theme is indeed it had to be for that as
[2:14:55] a basic doctrine and truth of the word
[2:14:56] he will be forever known as the
[2:14:58] instrument in the hand of god
[2:15:00] who revived revived this truth he was
[2:15:02] the fifth messenger and his message was
[2:15:04] the just shall live by faith
[2:15:06] surely we admit that he knew and did
[2:15:08] teach
[2:15:09] that we were we are to go from faith to
[2:15:11] faith his marvelous understanding of
[2:15:13] sovereignty election
[2:15:14] predestination and other truths show him
[2:15:16] to be a great man
[2:15:17] in the word yet i say again as to
[2:15:19] historians god used him to bring the
[2:15:21] people
[2:15:21] god's standard against works the just
[2:15:24] shall live
[2:15:25] by faith says now as i mentioned already
[2:15:28] this age has been called
[2:15:29] by historians the period of reformation
[2:15:31] that is exactly right
[2:15:33] that is what it was it had to be that
[2:15:35] that for
[2:15:36] that for martin luther was a reformer
[2:15:37] not a prophet now i know the history
[2:15:40] books call him a prophet but it doesn't
[2:15:41] mean
[2:15:42] that the history books is right but
[2:15:44] there's no record of
[2:15:45] martin luther qualified as a true
[2:15:47] prophet of god in the grand scriptural
[2:15:50] sense amen of that word he was a fine
[2:15:53] teacher
[2:15:54] with some of the manifestations of the
[2:15:56] spirit in his life and we praise god for
[2:15:58] that
[2:15:58] so he was not able to lead the church
[2:16:00] back to the whole truth as would a man
[2:16:02] like apostle paul
[2:16:03] who was both apostle and prophet
[2:16:07] now he had non-spiritual gifts
[2:16:08] manifested in his life you can tell the
[2:16:10] supernatural was with
[2:16:12] luther uh i don't know too many people
[2:16:15] today that got
[2:16:16] all nine spiritual gifts manifesting in
[2:16:19] their life
[2:16:20] all nine this had to be some some man of
[2:16:23] god
[2:16:24] he was a real man of god god used his
[2:16:27] life he was a star in the hand of jesus
[2:16:29] god used his life
[2:16:30] in order to bring truth back to us it
[2:16:32] was the open door for truth to come back
[2:16:34] luther was a part of that process so we
[2:16:37] don't discredit that we thank god for it
[2:16:39] this is why the prophet said he was a
[2:16:40] part of the sixth junction
[2:16:42] luther and wesley so part one i just
[2:16:44] want to just talk
[2:16:45] i talked a little bit about luther next
[2:16:47] time i want to talk about
[2:16:49] wesley they were both a part of this
[2:16:52] junction
[2:16:53] can i just maybe leave you with a
[2:16:55] scripture
[2:16:56] oh my let me just let me let me see here
[2:17:00] i'm gonna leave this scripture with you
[2:17:02] and i won't i won't explain it i'll
[2:17:04] explain it next week
[2:17:06] but here in revelation um
[2:17:10] oh my let me see here
[2:17:18] revelation 14 verse 6
[2:17:22] to 12.
[2:17:25] their ministries the ministry of luther
[2:17:28] the ministry of wesley the ministry of
[2:17:31] william branham found right here in the
[2:17:32] book of revelation
[2:17:34] chapter 14. verse 6 says and i saw
[2:17:36] another angel fly in the midst of heaven
[2:17:39] having the everlasting gospel to preach
[2:17:42] uh luther was this angel with the
[2:17:44] everlasting gospel to preach
[2:17:46] says preach unto them that dwell on the
[2:17:48] earth and to every nation in kindred and
[2:17:51] tongue
[2:17:51] and people saying with a loud voice fear
[2:17:54] god and give glory to him for the hour
[2:17:56] of his judgment is come and worship him
[2:17:58] that made heaven and earth and the sea
[2:18:00] and the foundation and the fountains of
[2:18:02] the water brother branham clearly tells
[2:18:04] us
[2:18:04] that this was the message of
[2:18:06] justification that luther brought
[2:18:09] if if it takes a profit to write the
[2:18:12] scripture
[2:18:14] it will also take a profit to interpret
[2:18:18] the scripture
[2:18:22] a prophet told us exactly what that
[2:18:24] verse meant and where people are looking
[2:18:26] for these things to be fulfilled
[2:18:28] i'm here to tell you it's already come
[2:18:30] already happen
[2:18:32] and we're living in it right now
[2:18:36] god bless you god bless you we'll leave
[2:18:38] it right there and i'll pick it up
[2:18:40] on next week amen let's pray
[2:18:44] father lord just taken time to go
[2:18:48] through these junctions
[2:18:51] very important for us to understand why
[2:18:53] we are where we are
[2:18:56] we're not here uh by happenstance
[2:19:00] our journeys through the various
[2:19:02] churches that we've gone through
[2:19:04] in this church there are some that were
[2:19:06] catholic some that were methodists some
[2:19:07] that were baptists
[2:19:08] even brother troy made the statement
[2:19:10] earlier we're not we're not
[2:19:12] faulting people for that we were there
[2:19:14] we were there but when you open up our
[2:19:16] understanding the truth
[2:19:18] god we can't go back to those things
[2:19:20] again we're going to walk in the
[2:19:22] fullness of the word of god as it has
[2:19:24] been brought to us
[2:19:25] help us to see this this journey we can
[2:19:28] see how you have moved in
[2:19:30] generations past god we can see
[2:19:33] in scripture these are things that were
[2:19:35] uh not not there
[2:19:37] just because but lord you prophesied
[2:19:39] that they would be there and and we see
[2:19:40] it manifested we can look back
[2:19:42] and see how it was all manifested god
[2:19:44] but help us to catch now where we
[2:19:46] are that's where these junctions are
[2:19:48] leading us to is going to show us where
[2:19:50] we are
[2:19:50] even right now god we got to make
[2:19:53] decisions
[2:19:55] we got to make choices they're hard
[2:19:57] choices they're difficult choices i
[2:19:59] think about somebody like ruth who had
[2:20:00] to make a very very
[2:20:02] difficult choice she was brought to a
[2:20:04] junction in her life
[2:20:06] but she chose to go with a mother-in-law
[2:20:09] your god will be my god
[2:20:12] your people will be my people where you
[2:20:14] die i will die
[2:20:16] she chose that and and then realized
[2:20:19] that through her
[2:20:20] choice she would be a part of the
[2:20:23] lineage
[2:20:25] of the lord jesus christ
[2:20:29] it's not a mistake that we make these
[2:20:31] choices
[2:20:32] but i pray lord if there's any here
[2:20:34] that's heard the word and
[2:20:35] maybe they realize that lord they need
[2:20:37] to come to a place of true
[2:20:38] and sincere repentance i pray god right
[2:20:41] there in their heart
[2:20:42] that they would make a man a decision to
[2:20:45] want to serve you that they begin to
[2:20:46] talk to you in
[2:20:48] in a way father that only you can hear
[2:20:51] and understand
[2:20:53] lord may they know that once they have
[2:20:55] truly repented of their sins
[2:20:58] god not to man but to you once they've
[2:21:00] truly repented
[2:21:02] god they stand justified just
[2:21:05] as if they never did it

[2:23:38] the scripture did not our hearts burn
[2:23:40] within us
[2:23:41] as he talked with us about a way
[2:23:44] amen i tell you what we we serve a real
[2:23:47] wonderful god this morning
[2:23:49] you know just one thing uh and and we're
[2:23:52] gonna
[2:23:52] let us uh get out of here let's remember
[2:23:56] our combined service at six o'clock in
[2:23:59] boynton beach
[2:24:00] and uh you know one thing we we
[2:24:03] when you get down to that junction you
[2:24:06] don't you don't want to
[2:24:07] ignore those things i thought that was a
[2:24:09] real profound statement
[2:24:11] hey man when you get there you you come
[2:24:13] to a place where you got to make choices
[2:24:16] you got to make
[2:24:17] not any choice you got to make sure
[2:24:20] you're making the right
[2:24:22] choice the right decisions
[2:24:25] when you get down to that spot is that
[2:24:27] right but it's
[2:24:28] not something that you can ignore
[2:24:31] it's something that i feel is important
[2:24:33] so we appreciate the lord
[2:24:35] we appreciate the pastor this morning
[2:24:38] hey
[2:24:38] manny man what a what a what a sermon

[2:24:46] we take for granted right
[2:24:49] we we take for granted a lot of times
[2:24:51] the things that
[2:24:53] uh we hear like it's just some
[2:24:56] everyday something but it's not
[2:25:00] it's not when he was talking about water
[2:25:02] baptism
[2:25:04] and and the correct understanding i i
[2:25:07] remember
[2:25:08] i always get myself in trouble i
[2:25:10] remember at a family function one time
[2:25:13] and uh we we got quite a few uh older
[2:25:16] uncles that's uh
[2:25:18] uh well pastors and preachers and things
[2:25:21] of that nature we got into a discussion
[2:25:24] it got heated it really got heated
[2:25:27] because i was trying to share with them
[2:25:30] the true understanding of water baptism
[2:25:33] one was pentecostal and one was baptist
[2:25:36] and
[2:25:37] so i kind of got labeled as being the
[2:25:39] bad guy

[2:26:01] and i thank god
[2:26:03] that we understand the truth because i
