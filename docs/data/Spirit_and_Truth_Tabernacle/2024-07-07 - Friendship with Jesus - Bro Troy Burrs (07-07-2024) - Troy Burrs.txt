Go [Music] free take us higher in you Lord deeper in your love and commit everything oh Father God into your capable hands in Jesus name we pray church say amen amen thank you to our musicians give our musicians a [Music] hand amen faithful amen thinking about Josiah see how God is just moving them from one instrument to another say watch it son that's how it start God elevating you see if you be faithful over a few things he'll make you rule over many so suffer not the little children I can remember back many I guess it wasn't that many years ago we ourselves was just little uh worker bees in the church and we still work of bees in the church but God has just gave us more responsibility a greater responsibility just elevated us and moved us from one position to the next amen so I think it was brother Quake who was hitting last week how uh let your children get involved how he was saying how he go over to I think it was Mexico he was talking about how the children was helping and serving and and and things of that nature don't let your children get involved amen you'll be glad you did cuz they'll learn learn how to be a servant for the Lord to the bride yes sir to God's people amen you love the Lord this morning amen amen try not to hold you I want to take a quick scripture reading amen if you take us to 2 Chronicles 20th chapter the 7th verse say Amen when you have it amen second chronicles 20th chapter the 7th verse it reads on this wise are not thou Our God who did this drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy People Israel and gavest it to thy seed of Abraham thy friend forever may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated amen I want to uh title this message this morning friendship with Jesus and like my brother Willie always do so often give it a context friendship with one another amen we see here that Abraham amen was a a friend to God and as uh the faith Seed of Abraham this is also God's intentions for us because friendship is a big part of relationship God wants to establish with us especially in these uncertain times the Bible says in James the 2 chapter the 23rd verse the scripture was fulfilled and the scripture was fulfilled which saith Abraham believe God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of God am amen you see there's nothing like having a friend to comfort you in the time of trouble a lot of people in this life feel or they think that they can get through without having friends confidence someone that you can depend on thank you Jesus that when things when the load gets heavy you may need a shoulder to Crown yes sir a a a listening ear nonjudgmental yes one that you can talk to that you can feel confident it's not going to go blab your business sir unless they're on their knees m mentioning you before our God that's a true friend yes sir a true friend will tell you when you're wrong yes sir uh give you constructive criticism build you up when you're weak yes be there for you yes when you need a friend Hallelujah there's nothing like a friend to comfort you when you're going through in married life all relationships start as friends we get bogged down in the in in the legal matrimony you know uh uh where finances and legal rights and things of that nature becoming involved in the process but when you look at it it's just a good friendship but as a couple your relationship ship together as friends can change this is why it's so important to first be friends together with your wife or with your husband yes before you get into marriage you need to be able to find compatibl come on and friendship yes and be able to get along yes and then you need to remain best friends throughout your marriage see a lot of times when we have maral problems it's not really a maral problem it's a friendship problem you forgot how to be friends see the pressure of life and situations and bills and things of that nature come and sometime get in the way of the Simplicity of just friendship yeah man go to the park all right and shoot some basketball together all right my wife and I you probably wouldn't believe it that we used to go out and play a little tennis we hit the ball back and forth I have to run and get it cuz she done hit it way over there I'm here but it was fostering friendship yes yes sir sometime we get together just the two of us and we go sit out by the lake yes put a rod in the water yeah I have to bait the hook cast the line she'll pull in the fish now she can hook him now but she ain't getting them off but sitting there on the side of the bank when the fish ain't biting that's the best time yes that's right oh we just talking right friendship it starts with friendship and and and and and as Believers of this message we claim that we have legally married wife to the Lord by the union of his word of this hour yet we can be legally married to Christ then we also need to be best friends with him amen can I take my time this morning take time amen and we need to maintain and cultivate that ongoing friendship in our Rel relationship with him as the years of married life roll on my Lord now I'm speaking in both situ you have to cultivate your friendship don't take it for granted Lord true so the subject applies to both natural marriages and also to our Mar relationship with the Lord amen you have to cultivate that friendship with the Lord Simplicity marriage sometimes it it it binds you legally and before God but it all starts with simple friendship I long to be in the presence of my friends it just comes natural soon as we get into the pr one number oh we just start giggling and talking it's comfortable there's no strain there right there's a trust there's a concern yes sir there's there's there's a bond that happens that's the truth when two friends come together right amen what's going on man this happen and that happened yes man I'm going through this man let me tell you about this what man you kidding me what oh he say man I'm man I'm this going on and that going on and see what happens when a true friend come and tell you some things like that your heart gets heavy right yes sir you join in in the burdens yes that's exactly right what can I do to help man how can I lift the heavy load how what can I do I see you going through something I see you hurting cuz sometime the only thing that can do is offer a word of comfort if it's finances you need man I I I what you need I got you then how do you think about that friendship with God when you go down on your knees and you Lord you see what I'm going through man what you need oh how can I lift that burden Lord I know you're a friend better than any friend yes yes sir we read here in the scripture where Abraham uhhuh needed a friend yes sir and your friend like no other you'll be there every time yes yes amen God has designed men for friendship see he was Elohim all alone no companion amen desired a wife amen but understand that that whole relationship starts with friend friend ship yes sir amen amen Jesus when he was on Earth he had friends I want us to focus this morning on the relationship of friendship as a close Association to two walking together as close Fellowship as companions see CU When you have that you have one can chase a thousand but two can chase 10,000 we all need friends yes sir you can't fight this battle by yourself amen there are too many the Bible says from the river Euphrates was loosed 10,000,000 demons yes you can only fight a thousand you going to need some help am you going to need somebody let me put it this way you going need somebody's to help when the devil unleash his attack on you amen TR brother amen you can fight off the first thousand and then you get weak oh my yeah you going to need somebody to come say I got your back right yeah yes sir brother I'm praying for you yes Lord what can I do let's go pick him up yes the military has a say no man Left Behind am right brother but what about God's Army no man no woman left behind right friendship friendship you can depend on one another amen John the 15th chapter the 12th verse says this is my commandment that ye love one another as I have loved you greater love has no man than this that he lay down his life for his [Music] friends ye are my friends if you do if you do whatsoever I command you amen henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what the Lord doeth but I called I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my father I have made known unto you amen the theme that that we have been working with is restoration we see how Quinton Jr has stepped into the restoration of the gifts yes sir and uh there has to be there will be a restoration of all things amen there will be right so restoration or restoring the gifts restoring the love in the church the local assembly restoring amen those uh that walked away from the gospel re restoring True Fellowship uhhuh res there will be a total and complete restoration Lord in 1953 August 30th the prophet preached a message why I a Holy Roller and in that message Mage there uh if you can around paragraph 59 I'm a little bit prior to that it says I looked and I passed an Old Forest where it used to be a great towering ponds but a burnover had come years ago and burnt it all down and it was just a big bunch of it looked like spooky great big old white trees the moon shining down against them and them just parched white and they came a wind blowing down through the mountains and all them trees was doing making the most wonderful sound of who ooh and I thought oh my what a spooky place then the scripture come to mind what the Palmer worm left the caterpillar had eaten what the caterpillar left the Locust had eaten but that was his church I thought truly Lord after the Reformation back Yonder what the Methodist Catholics left the fundamentalists eaten what the fundamentalists left the Presbyterians have eaten what the Presbyterians left the Baptists have eaten what the Baptists left the nazarenes have eaten until they eat the thing down but I will restore say say the Lord hallelujah God's going to have a church I will restore sayith the Lord he says I stood and wondered and he God sending that wind down and all of those big old trees was doing going woo woo I thought that's exactly like that Mighty rushing wind that came down from heaven at the day of Pentecost when it strikes them big old churches like that he says around Chicago man referencing them to Old burnt trees with no life in them right they had been eaten down amen by denominationalism to where there was no leaves right amen and we're reminded that the leaves are what the fellowship yes sir true amen all of the all of the love was burnt out there was no life there so I thought just exactly he says the mighty Russian wind that come down at the day of Pentecost when it strikes some old churches like that around Chicago and the only thing I can here is mourn and cry and say the days of Miracles have passed see the gifts were gone they didn't even believe in the gifts anymore so that they got to a point they believe that that that day was over paragraph 6 it say fundamental they are trees yes sir they once uh they was once a tree the Methodist the Baptist the Presbyterian the moodies and all the rest they've got great big towering spires but they say the days of Miracles have passed because the Palmer worm has eaten all the blessings out of the church till their no more Hallelujah there's no more praise to God hallelujah there's no more Divine Healing there's no more speaking with tongues they've carried it away tongues is dead see the devil took the gifts right out of the church amen but I will restore sayth the Lord amen hallelujah amen I stood and I looked there come a wind again and instead of bending to it they say whoa see and when the winds began to blow all these trees began that wind began to hit Amen Let me say something before I go on and what happened that wind blow and they stand against it I remember one service and I was standing in the service and it was a very powerful service going on and I felt the Holy Spirit wanted to have its way and I began to look out over the people and I the wind was blowing and the different ones would stiffen up I'm not I'm not going to let go I'm not going to yield to the presence see that became a time I remember myself can I tell my own testimony amen I remember myself when I stood rigid the the presence of the Lord was so near it was like that Mighty rushing wind and I'm standing there tightening up my Lord and the devil speaking in my ear don't praise resist see he says if you resist the devil he'll flee right but if you resist God he'll leave you alone too amen Lord have mercy see cuz when God is knocking at the door of your heart let him in am amen so I stood rigid I'm not going to let go I'm a I'm a G I'm hard no I can't let go oh my but as he began to continue to knock on the doors of my heart I lift one hand oh God amen amen and the devil started to lose his grip yes sir then I lift the other hand see when you lift both hands to him come on it's an act of surrenderance that's right Lord I I I I Surrender amen and and to that's not it I didn't get free when I just lifted my hands my God I had to open my mouth Hallelujah yes sir brother I open my mouth and after a while I just let go I say I wanted to say Lord but what came out was ah Hallelujah I didn't know what to say I just scream ah and the tears begin to flow God the devil had lost his grip yes sir and the Lord begin to pour in and pour in and pour in and I begin to weep and guess what my friends came and they begin to praise with me Hallelujah and we begin to praise together and we jumped and we weeped and we leaped and we praised God and till all of the Devils were free I left there that night felt free in Jesus name praise the Lord hallelujah amen hallelujah everything felt new right I was they I can't even explain it they call it a Persian I felt light the burdens that I walked in with I didn't have anymore Lord the sun shined a little bit brighter Hallelujah the wind smelt a little bit sweeter I'm just hugging everybody Hallelujah hugging everybody I had been changed hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus amen and I see it and I feel it so many times amongst us and we tightened up oh God let go Amen Let Go God is trying to he's knocking at the door but you have to let him in amen amen that's

fights with their own brothers and sisters yeah we fighting the backyard but I bet tell you what you better not touch him that's right you better not touch him m i can touch him sometime I have to touch him but you better not touch him remember one time we was in school we were going to jack was taking uh computer excuse me your pastor brother Jack I don't even know how to do it no more got so many titles we was he was doing computer classes I was doing Electronics we were at the same school I'm in there taking a test I'm the I'm the last one in there everybody the time laugh when in there struggling I see him at the door laughing I finally F came out he said man somebody out here man talking about they gonna meet me in the parking lot I said okay where he at and I guess I scared him a

he gone you f to you what I dare you to touch him see but we argue fuss this that and the other but you know what better not bother him no sir better not bother remember one time brother Willie was up there in the property he heard all that aing and fussing he said what in the world going on down there and me and Jack going back and forth by something yeah know you two brothers in the church right after the church now yeah no you all right let's go home sleep in the same room it's all right he said what he had to say said what I had to say now let's go home go to bed ain't no love lost no sir Ain't No Love L we making each other back we sharing each other that's it yes sir amen we played on the same baseball team coach had enough wisdom he put me at Short Stop and Jack at second base I go again at second base cuz they the the short stop and the second basement got to feed off each other M man we had got so good at turning double plays we'll let you get on first base so we can turn that double play why cuz we live together and we practice together all the time sir so we had it down to a sance they hit that ball to me Jack know right where to go I even just take my time and bounce it up a little bit man running his hardest think he going to get to that base I flip it over to him and he catch it put it on second base and beam that thing to first base bpop ah two outs you say don't

cover and we got it covered today Hallelujah Lord praise the Lord we still got it covered Hallelujah see but that's the relationship we have with one another as we grow in God Amen as we grow together now see it's a growing process sometime we make mistakes every if a child has a as a child you expect them to make mistakes along the way am it's a growth process let go the bitterness amen Amen Let It Go let it I'm sure you can look back and say some of those mistakes you made Let It Go press on to the mark of the High Calling amen amen Don't Look Back press on press forward that's it amen let's move on here Zechariah 13 I think I just read that six and one shall say unto him what are those wounds in thine hands then he answer those which I received those which I was wounded in the house of my friends Christ at his second coming amen during the Old Testament he was God the Father who suffered rejection but during the New Testament he came as a flesh man so not only his heart was able to be wounded but they was able to wound his flesh see his scars in his head from when they pressed the reef the spear in the s side the nail in his feet they wounded where amongst his own people amen so do we think we're any better than him no did he hold any bitterness he say father forgive him for they know not what they do and he loves them all he Lov them anyhow amen so whether there's bitterness there's a lack of forgiveness it's because of the lack of love of God because love beareth all things love endureth all things love is kind when it has not been kind to love is kind when it has not been kind to amen amen John 1335 says by this shall men know that ye are my disciples when ye have love one for another amen and it's easy to love people that are kind towards you right true almost anyone can do that but it's a real test of that love of God in your heart when a person is not kind to you and you continue to be kind to them amen amen amen when a person has been mean to you but you still be kind to them amen God has divined a purpose for every trial and every struggle in our life amen it's all for a purpose it's all for our development yes yes so think these fiery STS not strange that we go through yes you have to overcome them I guarantee you well you say well I've been hurt here you go somewhere else guess what I promise you why because we've all born anybody that has been born in sin come through a woman has what we call a human nature yes sir yes sir and that human nature amen has uh uh all kind of things that come with it that make you hurt people right true brother that's why we have to be born again and take on another nature but you still trapped in this Pet house and every now and then you going to hurt some you that is you sticky you sticky and you going to rub somebody the wrong way or somebody going to rub you the wrong way but when love projects Grace takes over amen amen amen there's where a victory is yes sir there's where the victory is at in your home there's where the victory is at in the church amen there's where the victory is at in your life see you going to I don't care how long you been married you oh the h 100y r the moon everything good keep on keep on Amen keep on Amen where you get them w in the house of my friends amen amen I think it was doing the Bible study Amen brother Jack put up a quote not a scripture there and I don't remember all of it but it was talking about how sometime you have to you have to uh rebuke or uh uh correct but in the end of that it says and be patient there's the key yes sir love him pray for him and be patient am good wait on God Amen it's not going to happen in your time right it's going to happen in God's time see he has the they they may be have to go through something that they have to go through true be patient he was patient oh Lord he waited on me Lord yes and then when I got to a certain place and was able to let go relationships begin to change friendships begin to

message sometimes we don't realize that how much we need one another we carry a lot of burdens simply because we don't pay attention we don't pay attention to our brother and sister sometimes they're struggling they're hurting and we're not s sensitive one way to be more sensitive is to pray you can't help but love somebody you're praying for and sometimes I I think we're not praying enough am just earlier this week in my devotions just thinking on David and watching his life and and seeing him growing as a shepherd and then become a musician and a singer and then becoming a a captain over thousands and hundreds being in the Army and later becoming King in a different hat it made me think of brother Troy and I was like my god brother Troy is just like [Music] David you'll see him on the drums you'll see him on the base you'll see him as a deacon you'll watch him preach something's going on in church brother Troy is there and I just got to praying for brother Troy I didn't know he had the thing in his mind Lord what would you have me do but we see what the Lord had for him we call him the the ram in the bush because he always steps in when there's a need brother Troy steps in it's not because he just wants to do it but it's because he loves you [Music] and I don't think we should act in a way where his love is not in vain if he gets up here and he pours out his heart and and wants you to have the love of God in your heart for one another let's make that happen pray for one another talk to one another find out what's what the need is that somebody has and meet that need
