scripture says in Joel 1 uh verse4 it says that which the palmerworm hath left the Locust eaten and that which the Locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten and that that which the cankerworm hath left ha the caterpillar eaten amen uh and we have to go to uh chapter 2 because chapter one leaves us in a really really uh rough spot these worms have come the same insect in four different stages and it just eats up everything and uh you as I mentioned the last time you have to see uh Beyond uh chapter 1 and verse 4 and your own life amen no matter how bad it may look because God gives you a promise amen over in chapter 2 verse 25 it says and I will restore to you the years that the Locust hath eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that have dealt wondrously with you my people shall never be ashamed amen I'll stop reading there but I'll I'll have you just hold your place in the Bible because I want to keep reading here in a second but let's have a word of prayer and I'll let you be seated father we come in the precious name of Jesus we thank you for uh the service thus far and all that you have done uh certainly feel your presence thank you for the singers that sang and the musicians that played the song leader that led us in worship the congregation that has entered in God we know that you have uh uh assembled us together with purpose and uh with uh with a plan no one is here by accident but each one was predestinated before the foundational world to be here and uh God we ask that you would Minister to every heart to every need bring healing to those that need it bring Deliverance to those that need it bring Salvation to those that need it father God uh bring uh a filling of the Holy Ghost to those that need it refilling of the Holy Ghost to those that need it father whatever the need is here may you meet it amen according uh to uh to your lord your great uh uh provision and we ask Lord that you would just take control of everything thought God every thought received and every thought thought presented may you have control and may you get all the glory and all the honor and every spirit that is against the spirit of God we take underneath control of the Holy Spirit even right now so in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you you can be seated amen um we continue our journey uh through this inspiration that the Lord has given us for this year of uh get back in Step amen and um the the quote that I shared with the church uh early in the year of where we got that from was brother random talking about the uh bride he had a vision of the Bride she come in uh View and uh and when he saw you know the alphab Bri walk um he was just impressed by what he was looking at and then after he saw the alpab bride uh walking and she was merching to the beat of the Gospel uh this was uh what the what the walking she was walking according to the word amen had herself lined up with the word and you know it's you realize now um it is your individual responsibility to align yourself s with the word of God it's not the pastor's job he preaches the word the other ministers come and preach the word but you have to accept the word and then you have to align yourself with that uh the scripture actually says uh his wife hath made herself ready right so this is something that you have to do and um and and in doing that you're going to have to say no to some things in the world hello somebody and and and and preparing yourself you got to say yes to the word of God and no to the things of the world and uh and it's and it's a personal walk with Christ but brother random said he saw this this first group and they were you know they were just marching uh to own with Christian Soldiers M marching on to war with the cross of Jesus going on before and he was um impressed but after that he saw another group come and he says that the way that they were dressed uh he really couldn't even um he couldn't even state it you know in the Pulpit he just couldn't tell you how bad this was and and marching to the beat of rock and roll amen this is this is what he told us and and as brother brandham looked at this group you know he begin to cry he begin to worry he begin to be concerned and he he began to talk to the Lord he says Lord is this all with all the preaching that we've done and gone seven times across the world around the world with the gospel and says this all that we could produce for you he was so disappointed in what he saw in the church because the second group was not the bride but this group was the church the question is this morning which group do you want to be a part of which one do you want to identify yourself with do you want to be bride or do you want to be Church well the bride dresses a certain way the bride carries herself a certain way the bride looks a certain way and not just on the outside the bride looks like that on the inside because what's on the inside will reflect itself on the outside hallelujah amen notice the the the the the church was religious the church had you know music that they were marched to but it was the wrong music right and uh and even you know brother Bram looked at it's just it just really really discouraged him so you know then he said you know uh the angel said but the bride is going to come back in view again and this was the Omega bride and as uh as he saw this bride coming uh he was a little bit more encouraged but you know as he was looking at this bride he noticed a little something amen this bride began to get out of step and brother brandham said he was about to say something to this bride but before he could say something somehow she shuffled her feet and she got back in step with the word Hallelujah and what I what I believe is happening here amen from uh from from that Vision literally I believe the the bride is aligning herself with the word of God again oh hallelujah amen so this get back in Step has come back uh uh we just been uh taking this but the inspiration underneath all of that was I will restore saith the Lord amen and this is God's job to do the restoration it's not anybody else's job it's not my job it's not your job it it wasn't even the prophet's job amen but it was God's job to do the restoration and I'm telling you God is doing a great work and he's doing a good work in our midst this restoration goes amen uh very very deep from from from from you know um when we look at it I mentioned to you all at the beginning the theologians when they look at Joel 1:4 they look at Joel 225 the theologians say we don't know what this really means we we're not really sure you know what this is all about and and for theologians to give us that type of definition and then people would go to the pull pit and preach these scriptures and say we we don't really know what this all about well um um I I don't want to be uh let's see I got to use the right word I don't want to be too bold but I think it is uh it comes to a point where we begin to recognize who we are according to scriptures so if I can just say it like this and hopefully y'all won't be offended if the theologians amen don't know uh what this actually means I a I would ask the theologians to come and just take a picture of this group of people and then you can say this is the group that is the restoration oh Hallelujah and and and as I said before when when when when they went looking for uh the Revival there in in in in England amen the wells rev the Welsh Revival they asked the police officer sir can you tell me where is the Welsh Revival if there was anybody that should have knew how to get around the city it should have been that police officer come on somebody and they thought they were looking for an address praise God but the police officer had a revelation that the Welsh revivor is not found at an address if you're looking for the wealth Revival you have found it for I am the weal Revival amen it becomes personal sir and if somebody looking for the restoration they don't have to look any further look at you because you are part of the restoration that scripture was written about you our restore sayith the Lord that's written about you let's pick up amen a little bit more here I want to just uh mentioned there's so many things that's being restored uh health is being restored finances are being restored wward children are being restored hello somebody amen um um the other thing that we find that's being restored justification came back into the church hello somebody sanctification was restored back in the church praise the Lord Brother brandom Al also told us that four life messages he said he said he said the gifts of the Spirit were restored back into the church hello and the final thing that came was the word glory to God that was restored back into the church so you know as we just been working ourselves through this we've talked about you know uh these these these other um the first three which would be justification sanctification as I mentioned and and I want to be a part of a church that has justification in it I want to be a part of a church that has sanctification in it I want to be a part of a church that has the gifts of the Spirit in it and I want to be a part of a church that has the word in it I want all that God had to be in the church am that's what I want praise God so so here you know we we've been talking about this you know and and I want to just kind of keep reading in the scripture because um um this is the promise of the restoration and um and and and I could just tell you we we we we have experienc we are experiencing it and we will continue to experience it praise God CU he's not a one hit wonder he has a promise in his word and all we got to do is stay stay with that promise and we ain't got to manufacture nothing we ain't got to make up nothing just keep staying with the word now here you know the rest of the scripture in Joel 2 let me read that and then I I I'll move on to some something else um verse 25 says and I will restore to you the years that the Locust hath eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you so God knew that these things would be happening in the church and and a lot of this uh from the days of Jesus all the way to now when you go through the seven Church ages the church just completely left the word they left the word God had to send a prophet to bring us back to the word and he's already done that amen he's already done that right so so so here um uh the great Army which I sent among you it says and ye shall eat plenty praise God watch it now it says um and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed now uh I like this part that he's dealt wondrously with us amen amen he has certainly he's done that and the verse 27 say ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel could I could I do this can I say it like this that I am in the midst of spirit and Truth Tabernacle and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed and notice verse 28 it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and notice what's going to happen now your sons and your daughters shall prophesy amen glory to God your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see Visions Hallelujah now let me just um I want to I want to highlight that for a few minutes but let me finish reading and I'll come back to that just for a few minutes also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit amen and I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the Great and the terrible day of the Lord come and it shall come to pass praise God that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord notice what the Bible says they shall be delivered sir amen for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be Deliverance as the Lord have said and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call now you know as uh we were here a few weeks ago the the Lord just did some mighty things wonderful things in our midst um the like the scripture say he would do wonderously with us and God came down and and dealt wondrously with his church especially with us going through through this this this this this Series this year uh which we watch God come and manifest himself right here in our midst amen amen amen uh and and if you notice there in verse 28 it said a couple things would happen it said that um he would pour out his Spirit upon All Flesh it said that your sons and your daughters shall prophesy right and um and then it also said your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see Visions glory to God let me just give you a really quick um uh quote brother Solomon sent this to me this week and and I thought it'd be very very uh helpful for us this is out of the sermon brother brandom preaches what Visions are Amen brother brandom actually telling us what Visions are now I want to just kind of testify just for a few minutes before I I preach there but it says in this in the sermon what Visions are it says but a vision is God by a word of knowledge dropping to the person to foresee or forsee something tell something that has been or something that will be now now now now what they're supposed to do is tell something that has been praise God or something that will be it says a vision a vision now according amen uh to what we just read here in Joel 2 that the um the uh uh the the the sons and daughters would prophesy the old men would dream dreams and the young men would see Visions now in uh the two weeks ago in our church three of those things manifested right here in front of us old men dream dreams I knew amen before I even came to church brother brother um uh Quinton Jr had come on that Wednesday night before we come on that Sunday he come on that Wednesday night and he was preaching about you know the gifts and he got to talking about dreams specifically and uh and I completely forgot but that morning uh I had a dream that uh and he said now you got to share it with people so it can be judged so I said oh my so I shared it with a couple people of the dream that the lord gave me and and I just didn't think too much of it right but you know kind of saw what was in the dream and and all of us kind of talked about it like okay we'll just let that be but as we come to the service on Sunday amen the scripture said that the uh uh Sons and Daughters would prophesy the tongues went forth in Prophecy amen a daughter of God released tongues and that was going forth in Prophecy and notice what the scripture says after that it says that your young man hello somebody would see visions and and and and what was told to me is that uh we as as the prophecy went forth and it was all done in decency and in order it was at the end of the service while we were worshiping this is I mean the word is already gone forth the other thing I want you to catch that that that it said there in the scripture in in in verse 32 it says uh those it says uhu uh whosoever shall call the name of the Lord shall be delivered there was Souls that came to the altar on that Sunday and they were not interrupted while they were at the altar God was dealing with his people I'm talking about backsliders coming back to God and I know how the devil like to fight backsliders but I'm here to tell the devil you are a liar God made a promise I will restore says the Lord and there is nothing the devil can do to stop the restoration Hallelujah amen if God made a promise it's got to come to pass in somebody's life has got to be manifested true so we watch Souls come and and and and after the souls come and went back to their seat and and the Lord just dealing with people then the tongues went forth and as we sat here we just waited on the Lord you know we we we we waited because we know that when you know brother bam had told us and I read it he said he told the sister said now sister she spoken tongues before he preached the word word he say sister I know it was on you it was on me too he says but it was just the wrong time he says but if he'll come back on you after the word has been preached he says I guarantee that there will be an interpretation to those tongues so we knew we had a guarantee because we had it lined up just right so you know I come out and I just begin to pray that's all I knew how to do is just pray and I said Lord um you told us through your Prophet that there's a guarantee that there would be an interpretation cuz everything is done just right I said Lord uh I say Lord we thank you Lord we thank you Lord we thank you something like that and you know I forget everything that I said you have to go back and look at the at the but I said something three times and then I said something else three times and then I said I bind the spirit of fear in the name of Jesus and and and one of the young men here in our church he said uh he heard a voice telling him what the interpretation was and he was sitting there praying Lord send the interpretation Lord send the interpretation and then he started praying Lord I don't think you giv me the interpretation no not me Lord but send it to somebody else Lord not me Lord and say he heard a voice and then before you know it amen it went from a voice to a vision and he actually saw the words he saw the word so he just read what he saw and he and he said that to the people and why did he have to do it that way because Joel said your young men will see Visions it happened right here yes sir well I just read the quote that brother Solomon gave me a vision is God by a word of knowledge and I notice that word of knowledge is actually one of the gifts one of the non-spiritual gifts a Vision amen is God by word of knowledge dropping to the person Amen to foresee or forsee something or tell something that has been or something that will be so it can be either one now yes sir we're not limiting God so the interpretation Amen on uh uh October 20th 2024 after the tongues went forth the interpretation was and this is what our brother saw he just read it he read it from a vision have not I told you that's something that has been have not I told you that I am the Lord that speaketh I will do what I said I am the Lord that speaketh unto thee have not I spoken to you Hallelujah says I am the Lord that speaketh unto thee hearken unto my voice and I will speak unto thee so here we have you know the Lord telling us what he's got what he I've given you my promise it's right here I've been reading it all year long I've been reading it the entire year have not I spoken to you and and here's the thing he said he say hearken unto me he says hearken and I will speak that mean God ain't done yet TR am Hallelujah if we would align ourselves with the word of God we'll see God manifest himself I I told you church that I believe justification supposed to be in the church I believe sanctification because these are part of the restoration the gifts of the Spirit are supposed to be in the church I just believe Pentecost got it wrong but I believe Pentecost should see the right way to do it here amen we don't run from gifts we accept them because they're according to the scripture Amen Let me uh catch a quote now former and latter rain brother brandom gives us something Foreman L rain is the sermon that he is preaching amen and and just from the title um I didn't read verse 23 of Joel 2 but this is where you see this promise be glad then you children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he has given you the former reign moderately and he will cause to come down for you the the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month so this is a promise from almighty god brother brandom picks up this scripture and preaches a sermon for a sermon former and latter Reign he says this says watch the ministry of the Holy Ghost watch it today when it comes back it says the church has gradually been coming down the First Reformation was Luther we had a great big WI Place amen justification by faith the church was shook then come along Wesley the second Big Revival he says it shook it down to sanctification the church become in a minority greatly in the minority then after that come Pentecost the restoration of the gifts it shook it down now to just a little thing like a pyramid coming up but right at the end time before or the Capstone can come to the pyramid he says what about it what is it says then the church is really in the minority as it was in the days of Noah so will it be in the coming of the son of man where eight Souls were saved by water now it goes and says now the coming of the son of man what is it the church come from justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Spirit and now I like this now so it come from justification said that was was part of the restoration process the four life Messengers it says it come from justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Spirit and now Hallelujah now both former and latter rain come in amen amen after justification after sanctification after the gifts of the Spirit now both former and latter rign this is what we're under under expectation for he says and as close approaching as my hand is a shadow it becomes closer darker darker darker and it becomes hand and Shadow is the same amen he goes on he says the church and all of its spiritual gifts and lights and so forth and the great signs that he's given to the church to look at there's the world out there the Fig Tree putting forth his buds there's earthquakes and darus places all these other things are handwriting on the wall to the world but you see these signs appearing The Works that I do shall you do also a little while in the world seeth me no more but ye shall see me amen for I'll be with you praise God even in you to the end of the world God's promise amen these sign Great Signs appearing what is it the spirit in the church is becoming so close like Jesus till the church and the spirit will unite together and the resurrection will come hallelujah amen brother brand says Morning Light so you stars in the morning put your alarm back on rise up and wash your face amen get the night out of your eyes and shine forth the approaching of the Son of God long healing line should be gone long [Music] ago y'all didn't hear it but long healing lines should be gone long go why why why because people catching Faith yes sir that's it and they you can be healed right in your seat without even hands being laid on you you can be healed it's it's up to you to get that type of Faith you know you know in the Bible amen uh there were times where they they they didn't even pray for people all they did was walk up to them and just touch them you know what the Bible says said lay hands on the sick and they will recover it didn't actually say lay hands and pray it just says lay hands right amen we coming to that type of Amen a faith in the church where we realize my my my my something just happened that brother just all he did was touch me and something happened that sister all she did was touch me and something happened that's where we going back to church I mean in Peter's Shadow come on yes sir huh I mean people were heal like look I I don't he probably ain't going to have a chance to touch me I but let me just sit here on the street and I got got to sit on the right side of the street because I need to sit on the side where the shadow is passing by those those people have faith that if the man shadow went by oh Lord have mercy and this wasn't even Jesus Shadow this was Peter Shadow but it was Jesus that was inside of Peter yes sir they recognize Jesus was in Peter do they recognize that Jesus is in us that's it oh my the same Jesus that walked the shores of Galilee he is in his pride today come on church he says this a healing line should have been gone long ago the Miracles and performance of God has got so much greater than that in this day until that's a back thing because we got a former and latter rain together amen beautiful the the formal L rain brings so much Church it it it brings healing it brings Deliverance it it it brings restoration it the gifts of the Spirit it brings anything that you read in the Bible that the the early church had it bring all of that back my God my God he says um he says until that's a back thing because we got a formal letter ring together it's the hour do you believe it and he says let's bow our heads so he goes into prayer as he's closing the sermon there but I want to uh kind of keep going here in the in the message God keeps his word there is there's something about this form and latter ring that's promised according according to uh Joel 2:23 this is the season and the scripture actually it says ask you rain in the season of rain and I'm telling you this is the season so this time to start asking God for rain ask him for it glory to God don't be afraid to ask God for rain whatever situation in your life that you need some rain on ask God for rain and do y'all know we living in a time that if your faith was not ele ated enough to ask God for rain that brother brandham said amen your brother or your sister would be in such a place that if you needed it they could give it to you right what he said my brother I give you rain my sister I give you rain exactly right oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I give you your children I give you your spouse huh I give you your health Hallelujah come on church amen I give it to you my my faith says that I can give it to you hey Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have brother I give it to [Applause] you that's what they had at Pentecost glory to God that's what has returned to to the church amen and and I ain't saying it's coming I'm telling you it's here sir here brother brandom tells us in the message God keeps his word it says now the only thing that the Pentecostal he says I mean the real Pentecostal now now now now because here's the problem a lot of people have not been able to properly separate um the Pentecostal denomination from what really happened in the Bible when when brother Rand said a real Pentecost he going back to acts that that's Pentecostal but the Pentecostal denomination that's not I mean they were part of the restoration but they W in the finish of it they weren the Complete because they went into denomination that let you know something was wrong with it soon as they went to denomination something went wrong and many of us come out of that Hallelujah we thank God for the experience that we had back there I mean it was real y'all it was it was real I I had a grandma that was real she didn't play games with this amen they they live right and and you didn't go to church any kind of way glory to God they would pick up that sin in your life and once they pick it up they would take you to the Altar and pray you through hello somebody sisters gather around you hands on you they going to pray you through make sure that devil get off you they will not allow you to leave church to stay where you came you walked in there you was you was done for bottom line you w go I don't care how much you want to go back out and keep living that life not in theend not in the the original churches now nowadays it's it's it's it's I'll just say nonsense amen amen amen but uh but here the prophet is telling us these things now now he says but the real Pentecostal message the real one now the real Pentecostal message is nothing but a restoration of the same thing that went into the ground that's been packed that means it's been carried hallelujah it's been carried through Lutheran it's been carried through Methodist it's been carried through Baptist it's been carried through Presbyterian and I say even through the Pentecostal organization it's been carried yes sir yes sir oh there was life in it now it had to be carried through that if you came out of the Methodist or the Catholic or the Baptist or whatever Church you come out of to this message it was carrying you it was all part of the process don't let me just finish reading the quotes let me finish reading the quote he he says something here that that that that I think would just help us just a little bit watch it watch he says this he says it's the same thing that went into the ground that's been packed through the Lutheran Methodist Baptist Presbyterian now just comes to an ear watch it now now it says as bad as I hate to make this statement there has been some fungus growing on it and eup Farmers know what that is is something that imitates the ear now that's what we're wanting to cut out cut at tonight because if you don't pull it off your corn it'll cause the whole patch to go bad my God my God my God my God now now I want you to understand something about when brother V talk about the the ear um so when you look at corn you have this this shuck on the outside and that's protecting the ear on the inside Hallelujah right that's what protects the ear he said but there's fungus growing on that outside and if we if we let that fungus stay there it's going to mess up everything so he said but we got to address that fungus get that fungus out of there because we want real corn yes sir Amen brother when you got a good batch of corn sweet corn ain't nothing like it you can I mean some boil it some roast it some fry it some eat it raw butter my God it ain't nothing like a real good corn right some of I mean you go to the fair they take it all off of you and put it in a cup my God is some of the best eating you ever had but but but but here you know brother brand trying to trying to share you know just tell us how this process is going because when you were in your denomination chur is you were in the shook now now let me help you understand you need the shook to protect the corn on the inside but I can't eat shuck I needed the shook but I can't eat shook that's not why when I go pull that corn I'm pulling a shuck off so I can get down to the real corn Hallelujah and I don't think none of y'all eat corn cob do y'all that's inside the corn that's a little cob inside the corn I hope y'all ain't doing that right but but it it but you can tell when you done ate the corn because you look at the cob the cob look a little different let me uh let me go on let me go on let me go on he says so that is one thing I wish to make clear that the people of all denominational churches as they have come up through great times yes they did I the scripture actually said we read it here you can leave the quote there but the the the scripture said that the rain would come down moderately so they had great times right he says this he says it's it's it it's been the maturing glory to God we thank God for the great times but now it's been the maturing and now the church is in the seed and it's got to bring forth the same thing that went into the ground the the Shu won't reproduce itself but brother the corn kernel it'll reproduce itself Oh My My My unless you take that corn of Wheat and go on the ground and die and rot say then then it'll bring forth it'll bring forth more right and this what we're looking for he he says this he says um it's um it says now the church is in the seed and it's go it's got to bring forth the same thing that went into the ground so it's just a fully mature church that we're living in can I just I want to make it clear of what I'm saying and why I'm reading this when we saw how God manifested himself in our midst of couple weeks ago that showed that the church had come to a place of full maturity the gifts knew how to conduct themselves yes sir and and and and let let me let me let me help you to understand there was an anointing from the song servant in that service from the song service for there was a an anointing where easily tongues could have went forth but it took control self-control even from when at the end of the service where you know uh the the Altera been made there was still a great anointing even during the preaching a great anointing but it took self-control yes sir and when we M when we're fully matured we got the self-control then we can see God manifest himself the way that he wants to man now it's up to God to do these things we don't we don't come in here and try to make something happen okay let's try to do the same thing we did two weeks AG no no no no no no that's not what I'm talking about I am saying that I am saying that we're not afraid of God if he want to do that now now now let me also help you help you understand something else every city that the prophet went to the supernatural showed up yes sir all right yes sir brother brandom could be in Jeffersonville the supernatural show up he can go to videlia Illinois the supernatural showed up he can go all the way down to deran South Africa the supernatural showed up he can come here to West Palm Beach the supernatural showed up wherever the prophet went the supernatural was following him praise the Lord so so if if he had the supernatural everywhere he went why why should we expect less exactly right so every time I come I expect God to do something something even I told y'all even when we go to the New Jerusalem uh the the the trees are going to be planted along the the the the River of Life and as those trees are planted say they will bear fruit every month praise God so God planted a tree at Pentecost and why can't that tree bear every month sir all right just just laying it out there all right he says so it's just a fully matur church that we're living in and one part cannot say thus to the other part for they live good in their day and they were the corn patch in God's sight so we do not wish to the prophet says we do not wish to belittle anyone what is he saying what is he say I'm not belittling my experience in my Methodist Church I'm not belittling my experience in my Pentecostal church I'm not belittling my experience in my Baptist Church I'm not belittling my experience in my Catholic church amen don't let anybody belittle your experience in those places that's that was just part of your journey amen amen amen oh I come to find out something that the steps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord so every step that I took God wanted me to take can I go a little further I'm not even belit my experience in some of the message churches that I've been a part of some of the message experiences that I had so I mean some of the stuff that we done went through it would cause some people to go right back out into the world but something got a hold of me something keep holding me that I knew that this message was right maybe the people weren't right but the message is Right amen and it was enough to hold me to keep me no matter what people were saying and doing glory to God so I'm not belittling any of my experiences I thank God for it all but we're just coming to a place of maturity you know even when you're going through life and your place and you're coming to maturity there's little things you got to go through in life in order to get there that's what helps you come to maturity when you endure some of those trials now here uh Mark Mark 4 28- 29 let's just read that really quick glory to God I I have um told you a lot of lot of hay on the fork and I know I can't get it all off but I I I come to realize that even though you know I preaching to you know the congregation that's here there's so many different people watching our this this our service that uh I have to make sure that they they're getting what we're trying to say right the church has has come to a place of maturity if if if if anybody been a part of church you you've seen the change in church and how it's not what it used to be I'm talking about denominational churches it is not what it you you know that there's been a complete change a big drop off big drop off like I remember when I was a little girl church was like this they don't have that no more none of those things in place anymore and and and it's because the the the Palmer worm the cankerworm the Locust the caterpillar C and ate the life out of the church but the restoration happened because there was a little life left in the root of the tree oh my God we're experiencing that restoration we're living it right now this is this is what this is all about and I'm going to I'm going to show in scripture I'm going to show in scripture how all of this kind of ties in just give me a little chance to get there and I might not get it all today but I get to some of it amen Mark 4: 28-29 brother Brandon was you know in this previous quote was talking about amen the uh it it's coming to an ear and I just want to throw the scripture there with it Mark 4:28 through 29 for the Earth bringeth forth fruit of herself first the blade then the ear and after that the full corn in the ear the full corn in the ear he says but when the when the fruit is brought forth immediately he putteth in the sickle because the Harvest is come and see we this and I'm setting you up for another quote this is the season of the Harvest amall uh last time I I I spoke uh and I'm my next quote I'm going to Exposition exposition of seven Church ages but last time I spoke I read the quotes to you all of brother brandom's prophecy we are this this room that we're sitting in is a room where people come to vote and this week there would be a lot of folk that would go in and out of this room and voting not even knowing what they're doing we have the benefit of having a prophet that told us things that would happen before the coming of the Lord so let me just let me make it very clear it don't matter to me which way the election go I'm looking at the prophecy and and what I see in the prophecy what I read to you all he said that there would either be a woman vice president or president well there is a current woman vice president and that tells me that the prophecy in my book has already been fulfilled if she happens to become president the prophecy has already been fulfilled but the last Vision said praise God don't stop at the sixth Vision the last Vision said there would be debris all over the land of America sir now I don't know about you but my expectation is that I won't be here to see debris yes amen you looking for debris not me I can just tell you that if all these other things have come to pass this also will come to pass now now brother Jack where are you placing yourself I'm placing myself in the same place as actually Abraham but praise God Abraham had a nephew by the name of lot and Before Destruction could strike Sodom and gomorah Abraham's prayer pull lot out yes sir amen so before uh uh God rained down fire and brimstone I mean before that hit Sodom gomor and destroyed the city debris lot was called out now if if he could call lot out and he wasn't even a True Believer hello somebody if he can call lot out I believe he's going to call his bride out before the breis all over the land of America sir keep your eyes on Prophecy yes sir yes sir that's all I can tell you keep your eyes on Prophecy that that's that's my salvation is in in Christ a ain't nothing that nobody can do for the US that's going to cause it to come back the way it used to be unless they un unless they go back to uh uh Chronicles 7 If my people which are called by my name well let let's let's let's quote it all now pull it up pull it up so the people can read it is that 2 Chronicles 7:14 or I think it's 2 Chronicles 7 or 1 Chronicle 7 let's just read it so we we make sure that we we know this this is because that's the part that people miss right so here it is if my people yes which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face first of all first of all we get and need to ask this question who is his people amen because the nominal Church think they are his people but they not if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray seek my face and here's the other one that that need to happen this one they forget and turn from their Wicked Ways that's the only way America going to get great again then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their [Music] land right your confidence cannot be in any of these parties is you can't put it in any of the parties none of them Christians not one amen not one praise the Lord hello Church uh I ain't telling people not to vote you can do whatever you want to do that's that's totally up to you and I ain't telling you who to vote for that's totally up to you but I am telling you this watch prophecy don't get so caught up in all this that you forget prophecy amen we are not of this world we in it but we not of it hello somebody Oh Glory all right let me um let me read Exposition 7 Church AG just brother brandom says something here this this this what I'm following I'm following a prophet now now now and as I I'm going I'm kind of moving into this fourth stage why was Pentecost not the complete restoration yes they had to give yes we thank God for it and I believe they should be in the church but that was not the end of it that was not the end of it and this is why this is why we're can say Pentecost was not the complete restoration but I can tell you you are sir you are the complete restoration now watch what what the prophet says here in the message exp exposition of the seven Church ages and as coming out of the section A resum of the age he says but what about the true seed it will happen just as we have said the people of God are being made ready by the word of Truth now we're being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger to this age now I I I just need to make sure people understand look I know some some people say I don't understand when brother Jack say brother brandham said it just seemed like seemed like he quote brother brandom more than he quote Jesus that's not what's really going on that's what the devil trying to show you that's right that's not what the devil showing but the only way you're going to be made ready for Jesus Second Coming Hallelujah I'm going to have to tell you what the prophet said now if if if if I was living or you were living in the days of Joshua I'm I kind of ahead of myself right now but if you were if we were living in the days of Joshua a great prophet has just left the scene and Joshua and I'll read it maybe later on I won't read it now but Joshua gets a commission and his commission is for him to say what Moses said it say this book of the law uh it shall not depart out of your mouth and now here's the other thing about if you would take this book of the law it says you would have good success hello somebody so so Joshua Amen in order to to to to take the book of law he would have to stand before the especially after the death of a great prophet the prophet Moses Joshua in order to give the respect of the people hello somebody cuz they knew they Prophet but in order to get the respect of the people Joshua would have to stand before the people and say Moses said he was quoting a Vindicated [Music] [Applause] Prophet you don't want people just coming up here with their thoughts and their ideas and and what you think about it has God Vindicated your thoughts Hallelujah don't give us that give us Vindicated thoughts if you would just take time to listen to the brother Brandon we listen to the tape on on uh on Friday night my God when he preaching about experiences I mean and he he say he says he he says thank God for his unspeakable gift that's the scripture he he read thank God for his unspeakable gift but he says there's some unspeakable things yes sir it's hard for me to even share these things because they unspeakable a man stopping a storm in in Colorado and it's and and then then and I had to I'm taking the quote and I'm putting in my sermon the The Great I Am he he said he he said he says he was there in that storm and he heard the voice of Lord says I am the one praise God that call for them squirrels I am the one that spoke to the storm Amen in in my day on a boat I am yes sir and I am was trying to say I'm here dwelling inside of you now turn and you speak to that storm hallelujah oh my God you speak to it don't run from it stop running from your trial stop running from your situation turn and speak to it sun shine for four days storm went away backed up and just went away a man spoke to a storm sir he says he he he he he spoke to his wife situation she had that that that that tomb and that grew to a grapefruit size yes sir and before the doctor's hand could touch her body he spoke from a distance and God brought healing to his wife's body that same God is living today amen my my my my my I'm running out of time let me try to get to this at least this quote I and I do I have maybe one or two scriptures that I I just need to mention here in this quote but what about the true SE they will happen just as we've said the people of God are being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger to this age in her will be the fullness of in her in her will be the fullness of Pentecost it's going to be here church and ain't nothing anybody can do to stop it you can't preach this out of the church when the prophet preached in amen hallelujah now we know about fanaticism we realize that but we not talk about finessing we talk about a fully mature Church praise God it says in her will be the fullness of Pentecost for the spirit for the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning the spirit going to do it yes sir and look at what he said that is thus saith the Lord amen amen it says it is thus sayith the Lord for that is what Joel 223 through 26 says and he's reading the verse now be glad then ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he have given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floor shall be full of Wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil stimulation of Revelation says in our rest to you the years that the Locust ha eaten the korm the caterpillar and the pal my great Army which I sent among you and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that have dealt wondrously with you and my people should never be ashamed now it says God is going to restore the Lutheran age did not restore the church praise God it started a Reformation the Wesleyan age did not restore the Pentecostal age age which which released the gifts but it did not restore Hallelujah but God has to restore for he cannot deny his word this is not the resurrection of the church it is the restoration amen it says God will take the church right back to Pentecost of the beginning what we see in the book of Acts we will see in the church today yes sir but this group won't be like the Corinthians that's why we had to go back and read Corinthians cuz Paul said now now when when tongues come in Among Us he says uh two or at Mo at most three yes sir that mean you can't get it out of order and have four five six seven people going off with tongues no you hear two people don't went off and you the third one the fourth one may be feeling the spirit like oh I feel it I feel it self-control yes sir hopefully you feel that too cuz you're going to need it we going we this going to be according to scripture amen hello amen all right that's what Paul that's why Paul had to get the Corinthians back in line two or at most three yes sir amen see Pentecost is just they they way out there I they 15 20 305 everybody in the church they're going to make speaking tongues no do all have the gift of tongues Paul asked the question do all have it no we all don't have it do all have interpret everybody might not hear a voice and then see a vision everybody might not have that but I know that in every church God has people with the gifts I know that much and all we got to do is get them aligned properly and encourage people in the proper way like brother Seth told us don't don't don't don't don't criticize it rally around it rally around it amen let let's let's let's let's let's let's let's go on he says this the Lutheran AG did not restore the church it started Reformation the westling age did not restore the Pentecostal age did not restore but God has to restore for he cannot deny his word this is not the resurrection of the church it is the restoration God will take the church right back to Pentecost of the beginning now notice in verse 25 it says it tells why we need restoration this is why we need it he says the Locust the cankerworm caterpillar and Palmer worm have eaten all but the root and a small bit of the stem now we are told that all these insects are all one and the same in different stages that is right they are the Antichrist Spirit manifested where is it man where where do we see that in Christ spirit is manifested in organization denomination and Doctrine Through the Ages this why you can't take me back to organization the Antichrist spirit is there I don't care how religious they are I don't care how big they are and and and and I worked for one of the big ones I remember walking down the hall one day and and I was so I was so discouraged I was telling my I was calling my wife I was ready to quit and she was just like honey just bear just hold on just hold on she just encouraging me I'm like I I can't take this no more I just can't take it and and they had this woman preacher coming and and a big woman preacher big one you know and uh and and and and I'm on staff and and they when they when they when they had her coming they looked out in the audience because they hadn't announced it they thought people just show up because they heard about it but ain't nobody come so they looked at the front row and church and it was empty they got nervous oh Lord she G to walk out here and see an empty church so they put out a AP be on everybody in the staff we want all staff members if you work for such and such you better be on the front row of the [Music] church now for everybody else they like oh yes I'm going to the front I looked at I said me I got to sit on the front row something they gonna get me on camera when this go around the world and and somebody see it I didn't think I didn't think to think this much I didn't I didn't think it all the way through not come to me if you would have saw me on camera what you looking at what you feeding on if you would have saw me on camera but I remember walking through the halls of that building building one day and and the Lord told me he spoke to my spirit he said you work for church natural and you work for church spiritual that's all he told me now I could put two and two together I knew what church natural was that's just organization that I'm working for I had a job taking care of my family praise God but one day Church natural forced me out because I wouldn't I wouldn't stop working for church spiritual and they told me they sat me down at the table my boss and his boss sat on one side and I sat on the other side when I saw that arrangement I said uhoh this ain't going to be a good conversation we began to talk and they said is your church ready for you to go full-time in Ministry so how many people in the church I began to tell them and I I said look I'm going just be honest I don't know if my church ready for me to go full-time in Ministry they just kept talking they kept talking they ask again is your church ready for you to go full-time in Ministry cuz you're not really you know thinking about coming on to be with us and that's what we were hoping for that you would come on and be with I said I tell you what I'mma Be honest with you I said it before and I'm going say it again I don't think I don't know if my church ready for me to go full-time in Ministry I don't know I said but my God is ready for me to go full-time in Ministry amen amen yes sir I said give me a date and it'll be my last day and they just came up with a random number September 16th or something like that and that was um 2016 well it's 2024 yes sir and God has still been good Hallelujah [Applause] brother random says this the Antichrist Spirit they are the Antichrist Spirit manifest in organization denomination false Doctrine Through the Ages and the poor little root and stalk is going to be restored watch it now God isn't going to plant a new church but it's going to bring his original planting back to original seed and look at what it says he is doing it as stated in verse 23 by the teaching or former rain next will come Harvest rain amen or rapturing faith so former rain and latter rain coming together and brother brandham called that latter ring he had a harvest rain he said also Rapture in faith that's why I'm not looking for debris I'm looking for a quick change of the body and we shall be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye try to twinkle your eye faster than that we'll be gone it says thus at this very moment we are in the complete fulfillment of Matthew 24:24 in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very leg and who is that shall attempt to deceive the very leg who is it while the spirit of antichrist and the false anointed ones of the LA of this last day these false ones have already come in jesus' name claiming that they have been anointed of God for the last day they are false Messiahs anointed ones they claim that they are prophets but are they one with a word now this is very important I I I got to drop you know because you got a lot of people rising up and they I've seen people get offended that we we quote brother Brandon they they want acknowledgement that they're prophets too I'm a prophet too I seen something too we ain't quoting you you ain't Vindicated you ain't Vindicated you God might use you here and there that's fine but we not quoting you we're going to quote God's Vindicated Prophet right and uh and and they get offended by that and and and they don't realize that even in the days of Jeremiah there's a whole bunch of prophets yes there's a lot of them right one guy come up Jeremiah Don't prophesied something and he want to he want to come behind J no oh ain't going to be no bondage ain't going to be and with this right here this see this instrument I got see this see this right here see what I got boom I break it and it's GNA be broken in two years Jeremiah heard that fell say that and like I done prophesy they going into bondage and you here with this great um theatrical uh yoke that you done broke and trying to say that the and you done lie to the people but but Jeremiah didn't even correct them in front of everybody you know what Jeremiah said after that man gave that false prophecy Jeremiah and the Bible said it Jeremiah said amen I can just see it Jeremiah amen glory amen but after church you went in there and prophesied that lie you going to die without seeing it and within a year that man was dead sir now which prophet was right Lord y'all just don't get me it's all what kind of prophecies going on about the election prophecies yes sir Church world just just just just enamored by it one one of my friends just to calling me just giving me all these prophets I said God sent us a prophet and I know what he said I only trust what he said now look I'mma tell you what he said then already come to pass for me that that's just me but but but if if something else happen happened in this election that just mean a triple fulfillment of the prophecy you know what he said because he said that um uh the the first fulfillment of he says that a woman would win the popular vote Hillary Clinton won the popular vote the the first time that that she lost to uh to Trump she won the popular vote that was a fulfillment of the of the prophecy well then it come back we get a vice president and now my my daughter sent me the little clip sent to my wife my wife sent to me there was about an hour or two of Joe Biden's term that he had to go on inury and KLA Harris was President for about two hours another fulfillment of the prophecy I don't need no more I don't need no more I'm I'm I'm done with it debris but I ain't looking for it there's a Rapture here somewhere between here and there is a Rapture and that's what I'm looking for that's what I got my eyes on a changing of the body yes sir I'm I'm I'm coming home uh these false ones have already come in jesus' name claiming that they have been anointed of God for the last day they are false Messiah anointed ones they claim that they are prophets but they are are they one with a word never it says they have added to it or taken from it no one denies that the spirit of God uh spirit of God manifesting in gifts is upon them now I'm going to tell you something that add into it and take it from it sometimes these new translations of the scripture be careful with them I only use the translations that the prophet used amen I I don't use these these other transl especially I used to somebody bought me um the um amplifier I stopped using it and the only reason I stopped using is because when I you you can go to the front of your Bible and see how that Bible was created the Amplified Bible was created by a very smart woman they they said man she studied she studied she studied so theologians got behind her supported her and said let her write the Bible based on how she studyed now if a woman can't preach how can a woman write the Bible hello church so I don't quote from that amen and and if you talk about well I need something just just a little more my term so I can read I we had a prophet with a seventh grade education and if he ain't speaking on your level just say what the prophet said all right I'm going further I I got to I got to go I'm leaving I on my time I say 5 minutes I got to say something before I get get get get out of here let me let me let me read this um claiming that they uh have been anointed of God for the last day they are the false messiah's anointed ones that claim that they are the prophets but are are they one with word never they have added to it or taken from it no one denies that the spirit of God manifested in gifts is upon them but like balum they all have their programs make their appeal for money exercise gifts but deny the word or bypass it for fear that a controversy might diminish their chances for greater gain we not denying this word that's the fourth stage of the restoration yet they preach salvation and deliverance through the power of God just like Judas with a Ministry imparted by Christ what you got a Judas had a Ministry that was given to him by Jesus and Jesus knew that he wouldn't handle the ministry right you better make sure you following the church that's on the word yes sir but because they are wrong the wrong seed consequently they would have a wrong Spirit motivating them religious oh my look at this now they outshine the elect in effort and Zeal but in but is it is laid the sin not of Christ watch now for it looks for big crowds big programs and startling signs amongst them they preach the second coming of Christ but watch this but deny the Advent of the Prophet messenger now now let me just give you because I've read this quote many times but I never stopped to look up the word Advent you know what Advent means the arrival of a notable person thing or event so they deny the arrival of God's prophet not only have they denied their arrival if you can't accept that he came you certainly you know ain't going to see that he came left and now all you ain't going to see nothing right but we telling you he's come he's gone and and he was promised to come according to scriptures now I can say what I want to see now let me finish this right that they preached the second coming of Christ but Deni the Advent of the Prophet messenger though in power and in signs and in true Revelation he eclipses them all ah yes the this false spirit that in the last days is so close to the real can be distinguished only by its deviation from the word and whenever it is caught in being anti- it falls back on one argument we have already shown to be false they only have one argument and this is the argument we get results don't we and since we get results we have to be of God well the church minority will actually say m i don't care care what results you get it don't mean it's of God if it deviates from the word it is not from God it is Antichrist I'mma just say this last thing and and here's here's what I'm GNA do I'mma say it and then I'm I'mma leave you in a spot where if you want to hear the rest of it you either got to come back or you got to tune in they deny the Advent of the Prophet messenger according to scripture God told us that he was going to send Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of the Lord just pull that up really quick Malachi 4:5 and6 the very last verse of scripture in the Old Testament God prophesies right here that behold I will send you who is you me I will send and if you want to put yourself there then God was talking to you behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and ter and Dreadful day of the Lord It also says in verse six and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and SM Mite the Earth with a curse very last two verses of the Old Testament God promised that he was going to do this now I have 10 other scriptures that I need to read but I don't have time today that actually identifies that brother Brandon was promised according to scripture to come 10 more 10 and I'm going to take my time and read them all for you but on this one that I just read I need you to understand something my time was getting ready to go off so let me just stop it real quick and I'm I'm I'm coming home I need to see now I said behold I send you Elijah the prophet that was verse five here's the other thing that you need to understand do you realize that the spirit of Elijah was promised to be used five times sir five times in the Bible God was using the spirit Elijah it came in Elijah and I and I I I I'm going read it I ain't got time today I promise you I'll read it it came in Elijah you read his story in First Kings 17 and and there's a very a very uh specific spot in First Kings 18 verse 36-37 that you read in those verses uh Elijah's Ministry was a restoration Ministry Hallelujah so so at first time the spirit of Elijah come comes it comes in Elijah himself where he had a a little Protegé that was following him by the name of Elisha how did how did he even get the name Elisha brother brandom say notice the J and the Sha the he and the she cuz Elijah represent Christ Elisha represents the bride and Elisha told Elijah that hey I know you getting ready to go he see he say say now I'm leaving but but you can ask me of something before I go what do you want before I go so now I got a request now this ain't nothing that never been asked before but I'm going to ask it since you say iing ass I'mma ask something big hallu I want something great I don't want no money I don't want no cattle but I want a double portion of your spirit he he say now you don't ask a big thing Elisha but nevertheless if you see me when I go you can have a double portion of my spirit and brother when them chairs of fire come down and they separate Elijah from Elisha carrying Elish Elijah away Elisha say oh my father my father he threw that Ro back down yes sir Elisha grab the Rob my God WRA it around himself and walk down to the same Jordan River he says where is the Lord God of Elijah I'm talking about immediate results you asked me a question where I am I'm right here and soon as the waterers part he walked and and walked across on dry land and then it was the the the the the prophets the school of the Prophet say uh the spirit of elishah is with uh Elisha that spirit is with him he's Anointed with that they they could tell that was the second time it came the third time and I I'll read I promise you I'm just quoting it now but I'll read it for you you got to tune in and you got to come the third time the spirit of Elijah was promised was in John the Baptist according to Malachi 3 as well as according to Malachi 4 what I just read John the Baptist ministry was a part of that the fourth one was in William Mary and brandham if I can call Elijah's name and I can call Elisha's name and you don't get offended hello and I can call John the Baptist name and you don't get offended don't you get offended when I say William Mary and Brandon that's right brother because all this is in the scripture hello and see we living in this forthcoming of Elijah which is under the ministry of William Brandon William Mariam Brandon which was a restoration Ministry yes sir and the last time that Elijah himself comes is as one of the two witnesses according to Revelation 11 five times God uses that Spirit on this Earth yes sir five times it's in your Bible So when you say why y'all be quoting the prophet because I got to do it the same way Joshua did it yes sir and and notice what in Joshua 1 says Moses my servant is dead you know what William Mary and brandom is dead but what he said is still living because what he said was what God Said and it was Vindicated by almighty God from City to City town to Town Country to Country Vindicated sir seven times around the world Vindicated so I'm going to keep quoting it just that's the way Joshua quoted Moses and you know what Joshua took the people into the promised land sir and the Holy Ghost has taken us into a Promised Land [Applause] Hallelujah I'm watching all the signs of the time I'm watching everything happening all around me but I'm watching these prophecies and they've been fulfilled one you know even uh they said in scripture when Jesus went to the Cross how many scriptures will fulfilled in a matter of hours yes sir hours things that you thought would man that was gon to take no no and within hours all these scriptures was fulfilled that's the same thing happen in our day you see all I thought the prophet said yeah he did and all this is just lined up just like that I'm I got my eyes on Christ nothing else nothing else but Christ I can't take no more of this world I I really can't I I'm tired I'm tired I I I do know this if one party get in if one party make it in the homosexual gender get to go it's it's enough already but I will tell you this though it's a scripture that refers to brother Brandon's coming St Luke 17 as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the coming of the son of man however you need to watch everything that happened in the days of lot yes homosexuality was off the off the charts it was so bad God had to destroy debris yes sir yes sir but but lot was out when that was when that happened amen church I'm closing I'm I'm leaving I'm promise you I'm leaving but you know what before before the place was destroyed God sent a prophet well actually I was let me put it this different way because he had a prophet on the earth you know you know who the prophet was at the time of lot Abraham but let so let me put it this way the word of the Lord came to the prophet yes sir the word of the Lord came to the prophet God said shall I hide from Abraham the things that I'm about to do and he began to tell him and and when Abraham realized that Sodom and gomorra is about to be be destroyed he said oh my goodness I got a nephew down there now Abraham never specifically prayed for lot but in a roundabout way he says per Adventure there be 50 would you destroy no Abraham I give you a promise I won't destroy if I can find 50 righteous now don't get upset with me Lord what if it's lacking 10 and it's only 40 of them down there would you still destroy Abraham I give you another promise if it's 40 righteous I won't destroy uh I know I've asked you this before musicians y'all come on I got to leave what if it's only 30 uh Abraham I give you a third promise if it's lacking lacking another 10 I I won't destroy it h h Lord what what what what if it's uh what if it's uh what if what about 25 if it's 25 I won't destroy it 20 if it's 20 I won't destroy one more question I know you're tired of me praying but God and and and and see God knew what he was really trying to say when he got got numbers all the way down he's said what if it's 10 cuz he said now I know lot and his wife is two he got kids he got grandkids what if it's 10 righteous if it's 10 I won't destroy all right God went down there and couldn't even find 10 but he sent the two investigating angels of judgment to go in before he came in come on y'all I I let me get out of here cuz I I feel I feel like preaching some more but when I come back to it we'll we'll get into all that but but all I'm saying is that when he when he got there there was a a the the word of the Lord came to the prophet and the prophet had an opportunity to pray to try to change some things but God knew no no I ain't going to even find 10 but what I will do you didn't even ask me for this Abraham but what I will do I'll go knock on lot's door and I'll tell him and what his family tell him and his family what's getting ready to happen and I'll invite them to come out not only invite him to come out I will force them out you got some loved ones in some really bad situations but God has a way of forcing them out God will force them out you just leave it in God's hands he'll create some situations he'll create some circumstances and he'll force them [Music] out and if lot the make believer can get that type of attention from God that's why I can say I ain't looking for debris prophecy will be manifest but not while hopefully not while I'm here I'm not even looking to be here while while California go down I'm looking to be caught up maybe while it's going down and they'll be so caught up on California that they'll fail to realize that all these people missing it'll be a sudden secret going away will you be ready sir I want to pray um and I want to invite brother Raphael to come before he has his surgery we want to lay hands on him we want to pray over him uh if there's any here that would need special prayer we would invite you to come as well uh you can come and be prayed for as well just stand right there my brother um they're going to anoint you with oil according to the scripture and we're going to pray oh our
