going to read this the first verse reads the lord is my shepherd i shall not want and as smoking norfolk read that he said if you notice here that's not you don't want more of god he said you won't have one of anything because he's the god of no lack you won't lack anything and i thought that was i thought that was good the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the steel waters he restored my soul he leadeth me in the path paths of righteousness for his name's sake yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest the table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointes my head with oil my cup runneth over

trying to just streamline some things so that just come and just go right into the word of god and uh i think i believe it's working out just fine amen that way so uh i wanna we're picking up from last week hey man uh make ready for the countdown and i'm i'm reading from revelation 19 uh verses 6 through 9. praise the lord amen amen we're reading here um verse 6 says and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters praise god and as the voice of mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent reigneth um let us be glad and rejoice and uh give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife have made herself ready amen i like that uh and to her was granted that she should be arrayed and fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints uh and he said the enemy write blessed are they which are called unto the merits up of the lamb and saith unto me these are the true sayings of god amen the lord is a blessing to the reading of his word let's just bow a man and a word of prayer before we would uh embark upon our thought for the day god we are grateful to be in the house of the lord so good to be here in the presence of god to feel your spirit just moving in the midst of the people we are here with an expectation of lord of visitation from heaven and we know that the dynamics to the church is a refilling of the holy ghost so god are we come with our cups empty amen looking for you to feel it and that god we would leave here changed by the power of the holy ghost if there is any discourage may it be encouraged if there is any uh god that need to be corrected may they be corrected uh lord whatever the need here is today if there is some sick may they be healed uh god and uh just what whatever uh if there's some that feel defeated may they leave here knowing they have victory and we just trust lord jesus that you would get all the glory and all the honor and all the praise from our gathering together and uh thank you for all that you are doing in our midst thank you for your mighty mighty presence you are an awesome god amen a great god you are our god and we love you and we praise you and we thank you it's in the mighty name of the lord jesus christ that we pray amen amen god bless you you can be seated in his presence praise the lord as we uh just continue our journey uh here in uh this sermon make ready for the countdown uh i wanted to just start us off today from the sermon christ is the mystery of god reveal amen uh just a rather long quote here that i want to just uh open up uh but let's just start there and um just let the lord carry us uh the prophet makes the statement in this sermon says uh then we can see that the marriage supper is at hand amen the marriage supper is at hand now i believe that statement is going to connect with something else that we'll say a little bit later amen uh but since then we can see that the marriage supper is at hand uh now if i never see you again remember the marriage supper is at hand right it's at hand uh and then the kingdom according to the promise is ready to be issued in the great millennium the taking up of the church glory to god amen the taking up of the church and the destroying of the wicked amen and the world under the sixth seal to be purified by volcanic to take all the corruption and sin of the world and to mold her out again and bring forth a bright new millennium for the age that is to come amen so those volcanoes started erupting there's a purpose for that there's a cleansing getting ready to take place amen this this this earth actually has got to become a new earth amen and when we talk about a new heaven and new earth we're talking about new atmospheres glory to god amen uh uh uh satan is also even in the atmosphere you know when we talk with some some of these uh hurricanes and great storms and stuff that come out of nowhere man-made storms hallelujah some wicked man has created this because satan is a part of the atmosphere glory to god but we're going to a place where there be no more hurricanes praise god i won't need category 5 windows there come on somebody i ain't boarding up no house over there amen i'm going back to a perfect condition again glory to god amen so the prophet says it says now when we see all these uh great threefold revelation and i love this the way he brought it because when we talk about christ as the mystery of god reveal he brought out this point that there were three things that was in god's mind first thing he wanted to reveal himself to his people amen secondly he wanted to have the preeminence in in his people and thirdly he wanted to return the people back to eating conditions again glory to god that's god's plan amen reveal himself to his people have the preeminence in the people and then take the people back to eating conditions again everything that adam lost is supposed to come back to the sons of god let me just stop and say this there i mean what other generation are we expecting to come on the earth to go back into that place amen the generation that is hearing it preached is a generation that's going back into that place that adam lost praise god amen i believe that said when we see all these great uh threefold revelation god in christ christ in the church the kingdom coming adam and eve redeemed back to the garden of eden in the representation of christ and his pride and the kingdom is going to be restored according to his promise praise be to god now by the revelation of the threefold mystery the secret and by the personal vindicated word by his original handship let's keep going in this he says but i'm talking about the headship of christ hallelujah amen notice being personally identified by the original headship we have the answer to the devil's question glory hallelujah amen glory we have the answer to the devil's question says he christ is risen and has paid the price and raising up the head or the body amen he says raising up the body do you realize as we hear revelation after revelation the body has been raised glory to god coming into her place and the he say the devil can't stand it you want to know why you fighting why are you going through this and why are you going through that the devil can't stand you but you ought to have similar feelings towards the devil he can't stand me and i can't stand him glory to god hallelujah amen we're going to fight until he's cast into the lake of fire amen the devil can't stand it that's the reason these economical kingdoms are setting up that's the reason they're all coming into what they're doing now the devil that's the reason he's howling the way he is his wickedness his scheme has been uncovered by the risen resurrected christ in the headship over his body glory i like that god i mean the word is taking its place amen we uh as we were talking last week amen we're not that kind of woman amen satan has got to recognize that he just can't present anything to us and expect us to fall to it we're not that kind of woman you can't talk to me like that satan you can't handle me like that satan i'm not that kind of woman praise god amen says you think i'm beside myself i'm not we got the answer we got the devil's answer not me that liveth but christ the word living in me is not my idea it's his power not my idea it's his word he promised it here it is he said it would be here and here it is we got his answer you are the answer god manifested in you is the answer glory to god christ has risen and has paid the price for our redemption what god in christ manifested he gave that flesh that that and the blood that in the blood might come the life and the flesh be redeemed and now this is a statement that i i want to get to here it says god in this redeemed flesh manifest his word for the day as he did in that day and it's time just for us to recognize who we are right it's one thing to a man to look at all the bible characters and and we can see god in their life amen and uh uh you know just man just the great prophets that god used uh throughout the throughout the ages amen even even down to this day where we can see god through the testimony that we've heard how god was just manifested even through brother branham glory to god but brother branham's not here anymore amen but that same god is the same yesterday today in february i remember a quote here just uh uh take that down just for a second for me i remember amen uh a statement that the prophet made he was uh praying for you know he was hesitating on praying for this this man and uh the man that got crushed by a car some kind of way got hit by a car and and uh and brother branham was just sitting there talking to his wife and they say you know um if jesus was here he said jesus go down and pray for that man and i got i got a perfect faith that if jesus prayed for that man even though he'd been crushed by a car that man was going to get up from that condition it didn't matter how bad it looked if jesus was on the scene that man situation was going to change he's saying now i know jesus not he said but if jesus gave me a vision he says then i would uh step into that vision right because i would know that you know i could go down and pray for him and say but you know the reason i just won't go ahead of a vision because i got dirty hands amen i got unclean hands and say i just don't feel right about praying for you know that brother with these unclean hands he said he said but if he gave me a vision i would just go down there and pray for him and i would know by position that the man was gonna rise from that condition and as he set pondering this thing amen and then struck him a revelation struggle said now if he gave you a vision you would be using them dirty hands and if you didn't have a vision you still using the same dirty hands hallelujah with the same dirty hands without a vision he went and prayed anyway and when he prayed the man came to his feet hallelujah we need to recognize that god is dwelling in this redeemed flesh hallelujah i say god is dwelling in your redeemed flesh your flesh has been washed by the blood god is dwelling in your flesh hallelujah look at this it says uh christ has risen has paid the price of our redemption what god in christ manifested he gave that flesh that and blood that in the blood might come the life and the flesh be redeemed that god in this redeemed flesh could manifest his word for for the day as he did in that day woo says you see it oh my when when can i stop notice it and then congregation yelling go on that's good when the church church church church just they want more more more more more i told y'all a few weeks ago we we're not trying to serve fast food here glory to god we want a seven course meal that we can give the people of god and when i mean you know back in the in the old testament i believe is the book of nehemiah as one of them they stayed in church for and worshiped for a great portion of the day almost the entire day nobody looking at their watch trying to go home just happy to be in the presence of god glory to god we got to come back to today's like that he goes on to say this says them then we stand justified hallelujah amen then we stand justified in the presence of god as a drop of ink dropping into a tuple of bleach you'll never find the strain of the ink no more it went somewhere amen it'll never come back again hallelujah and when man is truly redeemed that predestinated seed that sees it and accepts it his sins are demolished and i i don't know about you but i know he was talking to me amen i can tell my tell the devil my sins are demolished glory is gone amen it's separated i mean i'm not connected to that no more it's separated it's dropped into the ink of the blood of jesus christ and it'll never and it's never to be remembered god forgets it [Music] glory to god i'm so glad about that amen that's why he can say what sin what's him you the devil bringing this and bringing that know what sin praise god that's as far as the east is from the west it was gone the very minute you confess hallelujah god forgets it and he stands as a son and daughter of god and the prince of god amen and amen now we are sons of god not we will be we are now we are redeemed oh i thank god for that amen this god is dwelling in this redeemed flesh hallelujah hallelujah now this uh uh thought out of sudden secret going away of the church the prophet makes this statement and remember now we are uh the the the the marriage of supper is at hand it's at hand glory to god the marriage sup is at hand he makes that statement to us so uh here the sudden secret going away uh of the church he says this some people some people say well i'll well i go to church on sunday morning i listen to our pastor which is a fine preacher that's good it says i appreciate that in you or or the america the world whoever it is but it takes more than a good message from the pulpit it takes your life it takes you to get ready it takes more a man than just a good sermon from the pulpit i'm a para e28 28 it says it takes um uh uh uh it takes it takes your life it takes you to get ready glory amen in revelations 19th chapter and the seventh verse the bible said that speaking of the bride of christ and that that's that's it now when you say let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready speaking of you now right it says uh uh old glory says uh she has made herself ready glory amen she has made herself ready amen she made herself ready and you as a member of this bride you got to make yourself ready i i i i like this now you know it's not me making you ready right but but you got to make yourself ready and i brought out you know the little quote last week of how you know um brother branham say people always say well lord if you would take this from me and god if you would take that from me and god if i if you could just do this where he said he said no he said that's up to you he said you got power to do it glory to god and what it is according to hebrews 12 and 1 you have to lay aside every weight and every sin that besets you that's not god take it from you god delivered me from this now this is he said you show your respect to god by just laying it down by you giving it up by you actually overcoming something then you have a real testimony when you get to the other side of what you overcame you know his spirits that we face in the day that they had never had to face in the bible days hallelujah everything that hell has has been emptied out on the earth so you don't realize it but you actually walking in hell every day hallelujah i'ma tell you now when it comes to like like in sports one of the greatest victories that a team can have is when they actually go to their opponent's stadium and they beat the opponent in their own stadium my god with their own pants that's one of the greatest victories that you could ever have and here we are in satan's eden come on somebody but we will not be defeated in satan's eden everything that was in hell has been released on the earth that's why you see what you see today amen it's the manifestation of hell demons walking around in people's bodies right the demon possession everywhere glory to god and the people think they in their right mind demon possession amen at the highest level government i'm just telling you the truth some of the things come out of people's mouth demon possession praise god amen you go to your job your boss is demon possessed co-workers demon possessed you fighting devils all day long you go to school the children are demon possessed and you trying to hold a testimony in the midst of this god got to give you strength hallelujah we lay aside every sin and every weight that so easily besets us when we're laying aside the sins and weights we're making ourselves ready right this is this is why you know say let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of lamb has come and his wife have made herself ready i mean these are things that that we have to do ourselves i was just sharing on last week uh how uh a woman when she uh when she gets a proposal to get married uh she has to start making ready right she has to she starts to start uh doing some things to to make preparation for this this this great day that's coming a date has been set hallelujah and and as that date has been set there are certain things that need to be done glory before uh her wedding day comes amen uh you know she um she go through things that the guests will

glory glory amen uh uh i was i was just looking at this even before uh she uh even before she has a courtship she making herself ready glory to god somebody glory before her courtship amen she's already talking about her wedding colors what is she doing making herself ready she she has an expectation that my day is coming she buy herself a hope chest and she start putting things inside the chest what is she doing she's making herself ready praise god somebody amen she's making arrangements uh with flowers and amen photographers and hey man she got all kinds of things that she's doing

can go through all that but if she don't have us if she don't have a dress prepared and if a dress is what we call a hot mess then she's in trouble all the other preparation meant nothing that dress has got to be on point all right somebody and any in in the natural if uh if a if a woman a man preparing for a wedding of a dress has got to be on point spiritually the bride must be on point when it comes to her dress yeah god's concerned about how you dress a man amen he wants you to be holy not sexy both words end with a y and they four letter words but as believers we want to be holy not sexy hey man it's a truth in it everybody thinks sex sells amen they don't sell sex sex produces spirits amen so we got to be careful in all these things all right all right all right all right amen glory to god i'm an old-fashioned fella i'm telling you amen amen i'm i'm very old-fashioned but i'ma i'ma just stay out of it glory to god if y'all come to my uh teaching on courtship versus dating you know where i stand on a lot of stuff amen i believe the bible no touching to you married that's what i believe amen hallelujah don't you touch no the bible says better not to touch that's what the bible says that the bible all right all right let me go on here uh i'm i'm moving here and the spoken word is the original seed now um this amen uh is paragraph 389 i want to just read here so we're talking about this making ready for the countdown now you know when when that young lady has been proposed to and she has those the date set and she's making all the preparations remember now she's actually making ready for a countdown the countdown is the day that she's supposed to get married so she start doing everything she can before that now you can't you can't you can't you can't wait till the day of marriage to try to pick out what the the bridesmaid's going to wear you can't do that hey man if you had a a um a seamstress that was working on the dresses you can't get him the dresses the night before and expect your wedding to turn out night you you got to do some things they got to make preparation well in advance praise the lord glory to god hey man you you trying to make sure that uh certain people that's got to pay for certain things that they got the money to do what they need to do you you got a lot of preparation to do now all right otherwise you're going to be paying for it out your pocket you're going to buy your dress and they dress come on somebody amen and if that's the case you need to start making preparations save some money now all right all right now this is uh coming out of spoken word original see amen paragraph 389 says now watch remember god's law of reproduction now remember after it's kind that's right the seat of christ the word must come through his body ha ha ha he says are you getting tired says all right just a minute now let's just hold quiet and pray i want to get this in real good i want this to grind down the seed of christ must m-u-s-t must come through his body not through a denomination i love that you're not gonna find this type of preaching in denominations and i want to go a little further amen with this statement the seed is passing through the body somebody has to believe this amen and as they believe it they're sharing it with you lord of god and then it quickens something inside of you and you share with others and the seed is passing through the body come on somebody right hey man that that's how that's how another life is reproduced when the seed passes through the body you're not just coming in contact with people just to come in contact with people god has purpose because the seed has to pass through your body your redeemed flesh the seed has to pass through that to get to the next amen uh son of god a daughter of god out there glory to god amen now now you know even when we're studying this message like you'll see me i'm quoting a prophet you can just pull that down just for a second i'm quoting the prophet now i have i have other sources that i can go to hallelujah i got i got i got all kind of bible dictionaries i got all kind of things like that that i can go to and i can i can go to the greek lexicon come on somebody amen i can go to the emphatic diaglot i can use all types of sources in order to try to bring you truth amen i can tell you scofield said right amen but but when i'm using things like that you got to understand that i'm using a theological standpoint so we say the word is not coming through denomination it's not coming through amen the seed is not passing through a through life theological mindset hallelujah somebody stay with me lord of god amen when we where even when you pick up different bibles different manufacturers of the bible they get behind different theologians and have them put those scriptures together hallelujah you know there was uh the what's the name of the bible uh oh lord help me jesus uh not not y'all call out some of them names amplified thank you very much uh amplify if you actually look at the amplified bible because people got that and say i'm just trying to understand it a little bit better i'm just trying to understand it so i pull out an amplifier and a brother bought me that amplified and i was like oh yeah okay this is making a lot more sense god don't want his word just to make sense it's got to be revealed so one day i was reading the very front before genesis when you read in the front of the bible see who wrote this bible how did they get inspired to put this bible together come to find out it was a learned woman that had gone to school for a number of years and if this this company got behind her said she's a very smart woman we're going to support her and putting scripture together i said no no no that ain't the way bible's supposed to be written right bob it don't come through knowledge hallelujah even even even in reading your bible you got to be careful because theologians sometimes can be right and sometimes they can be wrong so i'm not following the thought of a theologian but when i quote a prophet come on doing things according to the word you want to not you i mean you want to know why because you're trying to learn scripture i get that you're trying to understand nothing wrong with that but the amen the scripture says amen the lord our god will do nothing praise god amos three and seven god will do nothing until he reveal his secrets to his servants the prophets god ain't revealing it to theologians god reveals it to a prophet come on somebody amen and then deuteronomy 29 say the secret things belong to our god but once they are revealed praise god once it's come through a prophet then it belongs to us and to our children so i don't i choose not to focus on the theologian i choose to focus on what a vindicated prophet said that's why i quote you a prophet hallelujah glory to god now let's go on a little further amen amen praise god so here he says this now that the seed must m-u-s-t must come through his body not through a denomination but through a born-again seed of the word must come through now remember what is it christ's seed how does my seed come through the body how does the apple tree seed come how does the apple tree seed come how's another apple tree uh grown it's through the seed that is already in the body already in the body of the apple you have to take it out of the body put it in the ground committed to the earth and a new tree comes forth hallelujah glory he said he says how does the apple tree seed come through the body amen a seed is through the body and the church is the body of christ that's right hallelujah of the bible church this birth produces that's the new birth himself and body amen this birth produces himself and body the same yesterday the damn family you believe it amen these are not denominational hybrids all right let's go it says now this is those that's in the orbit waiting for the countdown oh hallelujah i'ma say that again this is those that's in the orbit waiting for the countdown you know what i mean fixing to take a rocket glory these are not denominational hybrids not standing in here can i say that again i don't know if we all get who we talking to and who we talking bought glory to god this is those that's in the orbit waiting for the countdown glory you know what i mean fixing to take a rocket glory these are not denominational hybrids not standing in here they're not no sir it's to see oh hallelujah so yeah let you i'm finished with that one let me let me get over here if i can you know i i i mentioned and i'm gonna mention a couple of things here if you true seed you can't get away from this because the scriptures say my sheep know my voice and a stranger they won't follow if you true seeds you can't get away from it amen but if you're not true seeds you'll find yourself right back somewhere else that god brought you out of not only brought you out of god told you to leave i'm talking about thus saith the lord out of the bible i'm not talking about just some somebody walking up to your prophecy i'm talking about revelation 18 4. come out of her my people that is thus saith the lord be not partakers of her whatever she doing don't be a partake of that that's thus says the lord speaking to his people we heard thus say the lord we came out and see we're not denominational hybrids we came from denomination but we're not denominational hybrids and we don't even bring our denominational thinking into this we have to doubt our old thinking we got to doubt our old way of seeing things glory to god that was the whole purpose of god sending a prophet to restore the truth because it got lost over the years it got lost now we're in we're in this orbit waiting for the countdown oh lord i want to there are some things that i want to share here oh my yes let's just go go into this right now i was uh you know just trying to study the astronauts and just some of the things that you know uh that they do and maybe some things they have to do to prepare um you know just to just to get ready and as i was studying i i ran across this man a man he's a astronaut from canada his name is commander chris hadfield my and uh and he was just talking about his experience of of leaving uh the earth and going into you know going to the the space station and everything like that and and it was talking about you know how he when he when you wake up that morning there's a there's a a day that's been set for them to leave there's a day set that they get into the capsule amen there's a day established for that so he said when you wake up on that morning uh you know you you say he say we get into that capsule and we're not getting in with our fingers crossed praise god to say we're not getting in hoping come on somebody amen i i didn't come to this message hoping it was right brother i ain't got my fingers crossed in here amen i know that this is the saith the lord right he said we don't get in with our fingers crossed he says when you wake up that morning you realize either amen in a few hours i was you're gonna be floating effortlessly and gloriously in space amen oh you're going to be facing death one or the other hallelujah and he and he choose to believe that i'm going to be floating effortlessly effortlessly effortlessly and gloriously amen in a heavenly place amen and i'm not gonna face death i'm gonna accomplish my assignment my god and the man say you know you know when that when they realize that that that yes they i mean we had uh shuttles that have blown up and and people have lost their lives but it did not stop other astronauts from pursuing amen trying to go further hallelujah the same way it should be with the bride of christ just because you had a hiccup it shouldn't stop you amen if you got a hurdle jump it praise god just jump in and keep on running praise god hallelujah he said he said you know the thing of it is that uh uh rather than focus on that i could die when i get in this thing i could die he said the more we know the less we fear can i tell you church the more you know the less you'll fear amen the more you get into the word of god the less you fear the more you quote scripture the less you fear the more you know the less you fear says on the day of the launch they report their amen to kennedy space center and amen and they go to the suit up room come on somebody and they say when he goes to the suit up room he realizes that in this same room there were some other astronauts that went before him and accomplished great things he said john glenn came into this room two times praise god and one time at the age of 77 john glenn is going around amen going up into space amen there's another he know alan shepard has come into this room amen and and he was the first to go into outer space as an american and they say neil armstrong and both all uh aldrin have come into the room and they've had to suit up and say these were the first two men to walk on the moon but they had to stand in this room first praise god before they went up they had to suit up glory to god i say before they went up they had to suit up you got to make yourself ready you say sally ride stood here she was the first woman to go into outer space says mae jemison the first african-american woman to go he said also uh ellen ochoa she was the first amen hispanic woman to go into outer space say all of them had to come into this room and get suited up you say you thought about them and let me just kind of break into this just for a moment because see we're preparing for a rapture can i just let me just uh break in uh with with two two little thoughts here give me um pergament church age paragraph 176. amen glory hallelujah thank you jesus amen now i read this uh from spoken words original seed part two last week but i'm reading this this week from pergamum church he says how can any messenger sent from god see this is the angel telling the prophet pick up his pen and write and we're we're catching ourselves in the midst of amen this vision amen that that was written down we're stepping into this vision this year says how can any messenger sent from god believe only a part of the word and and deny some of it say the true prophet of god in this last they will proclaim the whole word he wants something to declare nothing the true prophet of god see we got prophet nowadays it's only going to tell you part of it amen just to keep getting your money but this prophet he didn't care if it hurt your flesh or what he gonna declare the whole council of god amen so he says uh proclaim the whole word uh denominations will hate him his words may be as harsh as john the baptist who called them vipers but the predestinated will hear and be ready for the rapture see the production again they in the orbit all right say the predestination will hear and be ready for the rapture now and uh and spoken words originally see he says they will make ready for the countdown but it says here say their products that they will hear it and be made ready for the rapture the royal seed of abraham with the faith that's abraham will hold to the word with him for their predestinated together now let me just uh just share something here really quick glory they get in they have to go to the suit up room and they they start looking at all these things about all these other uh astronauts that had to come into the same room and got dressed before they left here now i thought about you know if they have to go in amen and just meditate on others that have a man had to suit up before they left i said let's let's meditate a little bit this morning on some others that have that have suited up and left here in rapture hallelujah the prophet told us that there were three raptures in the old testament come on somebody amen he says enoch was raptured enoch lived for 365 years and one day he took a walk with god and he never showed up home again and i want to walk with god like that one day church hallelujah that i'll never come back no more i'll walk my way right into the presence of god it says enoch was raptured elijah was raptured praise god amen he said not only he says in jesus being the keystone between the old testament and the new testament jesus experienced the rapture now let's read this out of the rapture amen paragraph 166 hallelujah they they suit up and they have to look at all them different astronauts i'm i'm shooting up this morning praise god and i'm looking at all the others that have already gone on before me i know that there's a rapture awaiting me amen are catching away amen here in the message the rapture he says uh now if you want to read in matthew 18 16. paragraph 166 it says uh there is three that bear record and i think i might have not wrote this down 65 okay you got it all right three that bear record uh see you and and first john 5 7 and so forth said three always is the wit uh always a witness is that right uh it's a verification something that's right three witnesses bear and the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established now notice we've had three witnesses three is a witness now we have we have already had three raptures in the old testament did you know that as a witness now watch enoch was one elijah was the other one and jesus was the other one jesus being the keystone now he bear record see he was the keystone between the old and new testament because he had to die but he had to first die and then rapture he died come to life and walked around here with us and then was raptured because he was the keystone that tied the two together amen after his resurrection and rapture look after he did that and prove that the old testament there we all know enoch was translated we know elijah was taken up by a whirlwind that's right in a charity fight and jesus died buried rose up and lived here on earth and then was raptured up the keystone there is three to bear record is that right i thank god for a prophet that brought us this now he said it was three in the old testament there's also three in the new testament come on somebody now let me go on here and bring this three in the new testament now three raptures in the new testament let's read this out of matthew 27 verse through 50-53 glory hallelujah thank you jesus this uh wedding supper is at hand hey man amen and and his wife his pride is making herself ready glory to god now i got to before i leave here today i want to show you how she makes ready for the countdown i need i need you to understand how she does that lord help us all right just let me read this really quick matthew 27 verse 50. this is representing the first group in the new testament that was raptured it says jesus when he had cried again with the loud voice yielded up the ghosts and behold the veil of the temple was rent and twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks ripped and the graves were open and many bodies of the saints which slept arose many bodies of the saints which left a rose so there was a great resurrection hallelujah amen and look at this there uh verse 53 and came out of the graves glory i like this amen uh here here the devil might think he got some of y'all in a grief but when you hear the resurrection voice of the lord jesus christ amen you gonna come up out of your grave praise his holy name i'm prophesying to somebody you're coming up out of your grave amen it says it came out of the grave after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many this amen represented the first group that was raptured because they got taken up into heaven glory to god amen say this is the first group a man of the new testament that was raptured the second group is found in 1st thessalonians 4 16-18 can we read about them hallelujah amen and i might as well let you know ahead of time this is you you got to find yourself in the scripture oh thank you lord jesus i just want to read this first thessalonians amen chapter 4 verse 16 through 18. look at this for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we be uh ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words oh glory to god not now he said that the marriage supper was at hand and i also want to tell you this the rapture is at hand and and how can i say that because there was three things connected to this rapture there was a shout out come on somebody there was a voice and there was a trump of god what is the shop see i'll tell you you got to go back to a prophet to get an understanding of these things what is the shout the shout is the message going forth when you hearing the message that god sent a prophet to turn your heart back to the word that is to shout and you are hearing that this morning praise god you're in it right now and don't even realize it glory to god what is this voice it's the resurrection of the sleeping bride brother random say when jesus went down there to lazarus graves amen it was a voice of resurrection that called lazarus he told he told his sister to say i am the resurrection in the life you say he that believeth on me though he worried that yes shall he live and he says they were they didn't realize the resurrection was a person oh i'mma say it again they didn't realize the resurrection was a person and that person is standing here right now [Music] and the same he says brother branham say had let had had jesus not called lazarus by name he said everything that was in the grave would have come out amen he had to call him by name because that's that kept everything else there kept everything else in place lazarus come forth lazarus came out and they had to unwrap him out of them grave clothes let's send him back to do what he used to do praise god somebody need to be unwrapped glory glory take off them grave clothes let them come out and do something for the lord amen and what was that trump it was a call to the feast and he said he said what that call to the feast is is calling us to the marriage supper of the lamb oh hallelujah when the jews got amen at the feast of of trumpets they always got called by trump is by blowing up trumpets amen and you know i was just looking at that leviticus 23 24 i won't read it that's the feast of the trumpets where they blow the trumpets and that that that that actually occurred on the first day of the seventh month in the jewish calendar and uh the seventh month on the jewish calendar is called the montiry glory to god and i was just i was just moved by this because the month history on the jewish calendar actually equates to the month september or october on our calendar and god has this message going forth at this time we are in it right now glory to god we're not waiting for something to come we are here now that's why the bride must make herself ready the last rapture of the old of the new testament is revelation 11. verse 11 through 12. this is the two witnesses of revelation amen and we have identified it not just us but the prophet identified the two witnesses as moses and elijah now there's some that believe it was enoch amen as one of the witnesses but noah's moses and elijah now how can you tell we're not going to just we're not going we're not going to debate with theologians but i'm going to tell you how you can tell look at the ministries of revelation 11 the ministries identify the character all you got to do is go back and read it look at the ministries and now that sets you free three rap three raptures in the old testament three raptures in the new testament all right let's go on here i'm talking about this um this gentleman by the name of chris hatfield so there are some other things that happen amen uh as they as they get to the the uh uh that day they wake up and they say you know we're gonna get it we're we're this is the day that we step into the shuttle and as we step into the shuttle then we have um uh we we realize that either we gone we gon we gonna have something glorious take place or this gonna be the last day of our life he said but they choose not to fear amen because they they they they practice and they've done so much that they just choose to kind of let fear just go right on pastor they think about the task that's at hand my they say the more you know the less you fear the more you know the less you fear glory i like this amen uh i want to i i i forgot to make this little note but i'm gonna just tell you a little something about chris hatfield uh while he was in space amen he actually you know he talked about he took some pictures in there they said he blew up on uh maybe instagram or one of the social media because all the pictures that he was sending back from space says just a very glorious sight that the man was looking at he said you turn one side and you see the earth is like wow i'm just a little speck on that little planet i mean that big old planet there he said then i look on the other side i just see all blackness and darkness but there's so many other worlds down in that that other that other area he said he said just amazing you stand there you look at he said one day he uh working on the space station he had to take a space walk had to go out and work on some of the equipment out there and while he was out there in space it says he had a certain certain uh uh something that was on his glasses and and somehow a man this stuff that was on the glass has got inside of his eye and while he's there on space his eye just shut closed the left eye just shuts close and he'd say i can't even see out of this eye he says that i don't know what i'm going to do he says but we practice this see the more you know come on i want you to imagine the man is standing on the space shuttle i've taken a space walk stand he said holding on just by one hand and he's going blind he says he said my eye just shut he says uh you know nothing that i could do about his savior and then it just began to tear up because of you know just being contaminated it says but because there's no gravity the tear began to rather than flow down and just begin to become a big ball of water behind my glass and hey i got my spacesuit on i can't touch my eye i can't do nothing but the more you know the less you feel it says he says uh it says before you know it that that water that's that's kind of forming in my eye and not dropping because there's no gravity he said what happened it began to break the bridge of my nose and then it got over into the other eye and now i'm totally blind on a space walk what am i gonna tell houston cause we really got a problem we really got a problem but houston can't do nothing for me he said he said crying ain't gonna do nothing for me worrying ain't gonna do nothing for me but the more i know the less i fear he says he says what i did he said i remember some of my training it says me and my partner we trained say what if one of us became uh incapacitated out here what would happen how would we how would we do say so we kept going through exercises he says he said when we when we when we went through hours and hours of exercise we prepared for failure we practiced failure he said because the more we know the less we fear and it says he says as as we as we practice these things and now here we are in a situation that we don't really know what to do so he said my my partner finally made it over to me and i told him what was going on so they decided to do a little something that was able to clear up his glasses and when they got him cleared up he says uh you say the water got absorbed out he said now i can see again he says but if i were to panic at that moment i might not be here telling the story say can you imagine being in space going blind it says but the more i knew less i feel he said he said whatever you do don't fear can i tell you that church right now whatever you do don't fear glory to god he says when they got ready to ride a man into the space shuttle to get him special that morning the van takes them out there to the space shuttle and it says uh they have to ride the elevator up to the top of the space shuttle to get in it says when they get in they have to go in one at a time and you realize the way they have to go in they have to crawl in glory to god they have to crawl and they got to go on their knees and you want to know how you're going to make it praise god somebody you gonna have to get on your knees that's how they got into this orbit that's how they got themselves prepared they had to be prepared mentally they had to be prepared physically they had to be prepared emotionally and that's the same way you got to prepare yourself the bride must make herself ready i love this i love this this little uh i want to just kind of uh inject something here oh my my my my my my uh he made this statement it says once when that when they when they crawl in say they close the hatch to the space shuttle they just they get ready for the countdown they get ready for the countdown he says he says they have a saying amongst the astronauts he says there is no problem so bad that you can make it worse i want to say that again there is no problem so bad that you can make it worse you just think about that no problem so bad that you can make worse and when he went blind he thought about what he said i'm not going to panic because i will make it worse he talked about how they reset their levels of fear he says uh through training they just keep resetting their levels of fear see the more you know the less you fear and they say now if someone say he say if you if you feared spider webs he says what you need to do is a study about spiders to see which ones are poisonous and which ones aren't he says from canada they got they got about 79 or 80 different spiders they but only one of them is poisonous and they say you got certain markings on your body so you already know what this thing looked like the others that you see are not poisonous he says so if you want to reset your level of fear he says when you see a spider web check to see what type of spider is it because it's only one you're looking for that poisons if it's not that one the rest of them not poisons he said if he said if you see a spider web walk through it you say you see another one walk through it you say you see a third walk through it he said what happens as you keep walking through it you reset your level of fear and what we need to do as a church reset the level of fear priests god amen reset your level of fear you'll go further than what you ever thought you could go you'll do things that you never thought you could do your faith would go to another level hallelujah well as i thought about this man and sitting there in outer space on a spacewalk and going blind he had the right mental attitude and can i tell you something the right mental attitude in your life will bring every divine promise to pass all right let me try to bring this to a close i wanna just i gotta i gotta share something here amen this is uh i'm going to the message countdown i believe amen uh yes this is uh countdown this is a paragraph 103 countdown 620909 m just stay with me here i just want to read this we'll bring it to close with this all right oh bless it be the name lord he says you know when john glenn sat there that morning they was listening to the countdown ten nine eight seven six five four three two one zero see see and and and now he's uh he's got to a spot where it says it's three minutes till midnight going to take off they don't know what it is three minutes until we have the zero hour it says now notice the real believer is in christ no condemnation to them that's in christ preach the word stay right with the word i don't care what the denominations say they're going to believe it they'll stand right there because it's the word the denominationals kick up a big fuss and x communicate them run them out say they're crazy everything like that but they stay right with that word as long as god promised it they stay there because they're astronauts they believe the words and there's no way to get rid of them they're going to they're going to leave you anyhow so you just let them alone a while he says but they're they're in there sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus listening to the countdown the church ages and so forth that's that's the countdown listen to the countdown the church changes and so forth glory makes you feel good don't it listen to the countdown what's the countdown all these things was promised here is where it happened all these things was promised here is where it's happening glory where our promise is here's where it happened the achievement that he promised today here it is right among us what are they doing listening to the countdown when i look at malachi 4 and c has been fulfilled i'm listening to the countdown amen when i look at revelation 10 7 and see that it has been fulfilled i am listening to the countdown when i look at matthew chapter 17 verse 10 through 13 when when jesus said elias truly shall first come and restore all things i am listening to the countdown i want you to understand the people that are listening to the countdown are the people that are inside the orbit it has a greater effect on them that's inside the orbit everybody else outside just gonna lift their hands and happy that they got lift off but it's the people inside and where we are we are inside glory to god amen he says what are they doing they're listening to the countdown how far has it come when i i'm telling when i look at revelation 3 verse 14 through 22 i'm listening to the countdown these are scriptures that i'm quoting to you when i talk about god's sinner prophet these things were in the bible promised to occur and now that i see that it's already been fulfilled i'm listening to the countdown look at this he says how far has it come all the way from luther the countdown justification sanctification 10 9 8 7 6 five four two go up it says what are they doing waiting for the take off the zero hour the reason we are here we in the orbit waiting for the take off look it says amen now look at that see how that that that it changed colors on you right there because brother branham does something after he preached it he when he preached he just let it go like that he was done i don't know what i don't know what the church was doing but he was done with the sermon but he said brother branham eight hours later recorded this additional ending portion he changed the ending of the sermon eight hours later not under the inspiration of what was happening in the pulpit but this inspirational message was still on him so eight hours later he inserted here in as paragraph 106 through 111 he explains this during this evening sermon in his presence paragraphs four through five so he talks about now you got to go back and listen to in his presence to see why he put that in there now let's see what he did the countdown was ten nine eight seven six five four three two one zero blast off but the prophet changes something let's keep reading now he says uh this great orbiting that the church is getting ready to do amen and the great time of the countdown i'd like to explain to you what i think the countdown is now i think we just been through it uh in the church here and no and now you notice that when the natural astronaut is getting ready to leave the earth there's a countdown starting from 10 back to zero now i haven't tried to break this message down and give it a spiritual application as as i as it would take too much time this morning but i want to try to explain this to you that 10 is a number of worldliness last week we came against worldliness come on somebody we're making ready for the countdown 10 is the number of worldliness man but seven is the number of god's perfection six days he made the heavens and earth and the seventh he rested six thousand years the world is to labor against sin or the church labor against sin and the seventh is the millennium the sabbath it says seven is god's perfect number and now he has given us the correct countdown oh jesus and his countdown is not ten but seven hallelujah that's how i know i'm in the orbit church i know where i'm standing do you realize to be an astronaut you got to apply and everybody's application is not accepted i want to tell you that many a call oh hallelujah praise god amen amen but few i chose them and i'm so glad i can say i'm one of them amen he says but but seven amen uh he has given us the correct countdown his countdown is not 10 but seven we just uh went through it i've been through it in seven church ages now we find out oh in revelation the first countdown was the first age i i i he he just i'm just have to read it i oh lord have mercy i feel so good i feel real good the first age the second countdown the second age see what is he saying he said the first age was paul and ephesus the second was irenaeus a messenger to smyrna glory to god this is revelation two and three now explaining that scripture for us martin went to pergamos praise god columba was the messenger to the age of thy terror luther was the messenger to sardis amen wesley was semester into philadelphia william branham was the messenger amen to leia you see these things already fulfilled by scripture so you already know what the countdown is and our number is not 10 our number seven ten is worldliness amen but seven is perfection let's go on it says uh first countdown was the first age the second count down the second age and on to the seventh countdown and here visible before us as the pictures draw that we have this countdown the first number counted was ephesus the second number counted was smyrna then pergamos third tier fifth was sardis six was philadelphia seventh was laid to see in the last church age and then then it's the it's the zero time hallelujah you know even when they hit zero time things have to pull away in order to allow the ship to go up things have to pull away come on somebody in order for you to go up you're gonna have to have some stuff pulled away and when god is actually delivering you from something don't go try to get it back [Music] that argument was for a purpose amen that argument was for a purpose god allowed that to happen so it can pull away oh jesus let me go on hallelujah glory to god amen he says this uh fifth wissard six was philadelphia and seventh was the laity in the last church then is zero time for the church to leave after the church ages have served their term now we know the authoritarian age has come and gone and ephesians age has come and gone the philadelphian age has come and gone and we are in the seventh church age at the end of it the leaders in age and that is the countdown that is the countdown church i'll tell you what when we can see these things according to scripture we know exactly where we're standing and this is why the scripture tells us as the bribe we have to make ourselves ready because we know it's not much longer it's not much longer we are at zero time and let me tell you when you have zero time you not coming to the shuttle that's not when you come get in the van and try to come to the shuttle or you show up to the suit up room you don't show up then you better already be suited up you better be prayed up you better be ready you gotta and notice this you gotta make yourself ready you know the suit that probably fit one of the men wouldn't fit one of the women she had to have a different suit amen one customized for her praise the lord so you better you we got to make ready church this is the most important thing i can tell you today make ready for this countdown amen god bless you god bless you glory let's pray church oh hallelujah father i just thank you for your word the angel uh told the prophet pick up his pen and write and as he wrote he wrote about the bride the word and the bribe and it just wrote these things and god how it was put in there that we'd be making ready predestinated even though the the words of the prophet would be rejected by denominations many coming against them many say that he was uh the supernatural was good but his doctrine was wrong they're coming against the truth they don't understand it goes against their common thinking it goes against the things that they've been taught and father this is why they they miss it they miss it because they can't die to those things but lord you've helped us to be able to see right in the scripture how you have manifested yourself the same way that we can believe moses lord was the prophet to the children of israel my god the same week we can believe paul was used as the messenger to the first church oh oh glory amen and uh father and see how he wrote two-thirds of the new testament god he was the messenger that you used to the new testament church he was the first one that you called out we can believe those things we also are able to go further and believe that you sent william branham to restore us oh god back to the truth that has been lost throughout the ages god luther came with a message to tell the catholic church that they were wrong he stood up against it put his 95 thesis on the door and and stood against it and god there was when we heard those things just in our history lessons we knew there was something about this man coming to find out he was a messenger god john wesley comes along and he realizes uh luther had the justification to just should live by faith oh buddy they did not have sanctification they were still living in sin and and john wesley said no it's going to take more than that we got to have a sanctified life hallelujah oh god he just began to carry the church a little further amen through the message that he preached but then god the pentecostals came along after after john wesley with the methodist and the pentecostals wanting to see a restoration of the gifts god they saw it amen it manifests itself the power of god so strong even on the susan street god that amen they thought fire that the building was on fire but come to come to find out it's just the fire that was in the building inside the people making it look like that they saw the restoration of gifts but lord when they organized and denominated that's when you left it and you kept moving forward god now you have some people on the earth that god they they believe in justification they believe in sanctification they believe in the gifts but they also believe in the restored word that has come amen to them god we are those people and we are in the orbit thank you god that you've called us to this place thank you god that you let us hear your word thank you that we get an opportunity to worship you in spirit and in truth and that's not just uh the name of a church but that is a place in christ thank you that you've chosen us to worship like that father and i pray lord that as the word continues to pour out lord that we will all draw closer to
