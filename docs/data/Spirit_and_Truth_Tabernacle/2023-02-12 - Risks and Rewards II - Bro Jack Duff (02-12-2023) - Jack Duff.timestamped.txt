[42:45] there we had a number of people that
[42:48] were watching service on last week
[42:50] online and they saw that we had cut the
[42:53] service a little short and they heard me
[42:56] announce on the on the stream that I
[42:59] need to meet with the church and and I
[43:01] just wanted to share that
[43:03] we had a local church meeting and I just
[43:06] wanted to share with our local church
[43:07] before it kind of got out online but you
[43:11] all many that have been online and I
[43:13] want to say this specifically to the
[43:15] people that have joined us online many
[43:17] have been praying with us on this
[43:20] journey to find a building you have
[43:23] watched us go from place to place from
[43:25] room to room you watched it and some of
[43:29] it I see y'all in a new place I see over
[43:31] here I see well we we they were asking
[43:34] me y'all got y'all church yesterday not
[43:36] yet but I I am happy to announce amen
[43:39] today that the Lord has blessed us to
[43:41] put a contract on a church amen praise
[43:45] the Lord glory to God
[43:49] amen uh so paperwork has been signed we
[43:54] have a closing date set for April and as
[43:58] I mentioned to the church there are a
[44:00] few hurdles that need to be jumped and
[44:03] uh and we are praying through all those
[44:04] hurdles thank you all uh I mean some
[44:07] people uh joined us last week on our
[44:09] three-day fast uh and uh and we're
[44:12] grateful for all the the uh prayerful
[44:15] support that we have been getting please
[44:18] continue to keep us in prayer as we go
[44:20] through this journey and uh the other
[44:22] thing that I'm going to ask for those
[44:24] that are joining us online I know that
[44:26] this may not be your home Church uh but
[44:29] we would ask that if you would like to
[44:31] contribute towards amen our uh uh
[44:35] purchasing of this property we would
[44:37] certainly welcome him and I wanted to
[44:39] share a quick testimony with you I was
[44:42] um
[44:43] this spirit and Truth is is where I
[44:46] attend church but I used to work for
[44:47] another local church here in the area
[44:50] and uh and I remember they were uh going
[44:54] through they were building a new campus
[44:56] and they were getting ready to go into
[44:58] that new campus and they asked all the
[45:00] staff people if they would just make a
[45:02] special offering towards that now I did
[45:06] not attend that church and I didn't
[45:08] really need to give them anything
[45:09] because I was not a part of their church
[45:11] but I said you know what wait a minute
[45:14] um these people have helped me
[45:17] right they put food on my table and and
[45:20] I know this ministry has been a help to
[45:22] many out there so this is why I'm asking
[45:24] this and you you'll find that I probably
[45:26] won't access ever again we only get to
[45:29] me I feel like we're only gonna have one
[45:30] time to buy a church like this uh if God
[45:33] got something in our future that's fine
[45:35] but but where we are now you know I'm
[45:36] just saying if we've been a help to you
[45:38] then just consider this but I said those
[45:40] people were help to me and um and I went
[45:42] home
[45:44] and uh and I just began to talk to my
[45:46] wife about uh how can we what can you
[45:49] know I would like to just give something
[45:50] to this church and and I was in a really
[45:53] really tight spot at the moment uh my
[45:56] house was uh they were threatening to
[45:59] take my house away because I hadn't made
[46:01] payments I was out of work and I
[46:03] couldn't make payments I was out of work
[46:04] for probably a good six or seven months
[46:06] and um and so you know I was just in a
[46:09] really really Jam there and they were
[46:11] threatening to come take my house away
[46:13] and served me with papers and all this
[46:15] and and here this church asked me to
[46:18] give at a time where it's really tight
[46:20] for me
[46:22] well I talked it over with my wife we
[46:25] prayed about it and we we actually made
[46:28] a fifteen hundred dollar pledge to that
[46:31] church it was it was a lot for us to
[46:33] give but we made a fifteen hundred
[46:35] dollar pledge to that church
[46:37] and I walked in uh one day and I just
[46:40] walked up and said here I just give the
[46:42] money you know for it you know you all
[46:45] asked for for people to give I'm giving
[46:47] fifteen hundred dollars towards it and
[46:50] uh just put it in um put an envelope and
[46:51] send it on off and just left it in God's
[46:53] hands after we gave that fifteen hundred
[46:57] dollars
[46:59] um I mean maybe a few weeks before they
[47:01] threatened to come take our house then I
[47:03] got a telephone call saying hey we want
[47:04] to work things out with you so you can
[47:06] keep your house but it was after I gave
[47:10] see what what released a blessing for me
[47:13] is when I gave
[47:16] come on somebody
[47:17] and I want to just share that because
[47:19] you know maybe maybe there might be some
[47:21] blessings that's been held up and and
[47:23] our giving is what releases it right so
[47:26] I'm I'm gonna ask it as we are on this
[47:29] journey you know April is when we're
[47:30] looking at closing and uh and we we you
[47:34] know we can we can never be short we can
[47:37] never have enough money I could say it
[47:39] like that for something like this and
[47:40] what I what I want to ask those that are
[47:42] joining us online uh this is not for the
[47:44] local church the local churches has
[47:46] already kind of contributed and they
[47:48] also going to continue to contribute
[47:49] they've made pledges you know and and
[47:51] those that are here locally if we ask
[47:53] you to just make your pledge today put
[47:55] your little
[47:57] um note inside the offering box as to
[48:00] what would you be able to give based on
[48:01] the amount we told you on last week what
[48:04] would you be able to give just put that
[48:05] in the offering box today just you know
[48:07] what your commitment is and I will go
[48:09] from there but we're asking those that
[48:10] are online
[48:12] if you would consider just pledging 500
[48:15] towards what we're doing just those that
[48:18] are online if you would consider
[48:19] pledging five hundred dollars now some
[48:21] might say that's too much for me to give
[48:23] whatever you can just just be a blessing
[48:25] to Spirit and Truth Tabernacle and if
[48:27] somebody said well that's too little I
[48:29] want to give more we welcome that to God
[48:30] bless you amen we welcome it too but
[48:33] we're just saying if you would just
[48:34] would you consider giving 500 towards us
[48:37] and you can do that multiple ways right
[48:40] from your chair right from you sitting
[48:42] at right now you can stop on the side of
[48:44] the road if you listen and stop stop
[48:47] and pull up your cash app and go to

[49:00] of God I got an opportunity and all not
[49:02] often you have opportunities like this
[49:04] and and sometimes you know here's what I
[49:06] learned that we have not because we ask
[49:08] not amen so sometimes people don't know
[49:11] what other people's needs are so I'm
[49:13] letting you know yes we do have a need
[49:15] we are we're we have a contract on a

[50:44] I'm gonna see a victory
[50:46] amen and I love that The Battle Belongs
[50:49] to the Lord it's not even our battle and
[50:52] you know one of the brothers has
[50:53] recently said he said you know he was
[50:54] thinking about you know some of this I
[50:56] mean and I'll just you know people
[50:58] people see and uh
[51:01] um this is a a very uh ex I don't say uh
[51:06] Florida West Palm Beach specifically
[51:09] it's very expensive place to live
[51:12] and um it's very hard for us to get
[51:15] property at a very cheap price
[51:19] it's hard the the basic house nowadays
[51:24] would cost four hundred thousand dollars
[51:27] now you can imagine what a church would
[51:28] cost for us this is a three million
[51:31] dollar deal three million dollars
[51:33] it's not easy right but you know what if
[51:36] God presented it to us and you open up
[51:38] this door then God gonna make a way for
[51:40] us
[51:42] it's just three million dollars
[51:45] so it's not not something like but our
[51:48] names is on the contract
[51:50] of a three million and when you look
[51:52] around you look at this this
[51:53] congregation like well that little
[51:55] congregation taking on all that old
[51:57] brother Jack man wait wait you forgot
[51:59] something
[52:00] you forgot something a little isn't much
[52:07] you didn't you didn't catch it yet you
[52:09] didn't see it you didn't hear it little
[52:11] is much
[52:15] when God is in it
[52:18] so we're not we're not we're not
[52:19] concerned about these things we know God
[52:21] is in control and and so every song you
[52:23] heard this morning it was it was it was
[52:25] directed just to encourage and uplift
[52:27] your faith we we we we we've taken a
[52:30] step of faith and we know God is in it
[52:32] we know God is in it praise the Lord so
[52:35] whatever you can do we certainly would
[52:37] appreciate if you want to just write a
[52:38] check for three million dollars we will

[56:49] and Jesus said unto them verily I see
[56:53] unto you
[56:54] that we ye which have followed me
[56:58] in the Regeneration when the son of man
[57:00] shall sit in the Throne of his glory ye
[57:03] also shall sit upon twelve Thrones
[57:05] judging the 12 tribes of Israel
[57:09] and everyone that have forsaken houses
[57:12] or brethren
[57:14] or sisters or father
[57:18] or mother
[57:19] or wife
[57:21] or children
[57:22] or lands
[57:25] for my name's sake
[57:27] shall receive a hundredfold
[57:29] and shall inherit everlasting life
[57:33] verse 30 says but many that are first
[57:36] shall be last and the last shall be
[57:39] first amen let's pray father we thank
[57:43] you for the word of the Lord
[57:47] we thank you God that we can read but
[57:52] God we need to be able to apply what we
[57:55] read to where we are
[57:57] so may the Holy Spirit come now and take
[58:00] control of
[58:02] these thoughts that you have given us
[58:05] today and Lord may you just direct it to
[58:07] the hearts of the people those that are
[58:10] present those that are online God
[58:12] directed and father may you just get all
[58:14] the glory and all the honor from our
[58:17] gathering here today it's in Jesus name
[58:19] we pray amen amen God bless you can be
[58:22] seated praise the lord we continue our
[58:26] journey here with risk a man uh and
[58:31] reward we started that on last week and
[58:34] and and and I wanted to just kind of
[58:37] move forward with this
[58:39] um
[58:41] the the word risk it means to expose
[58:47] someone or something valued to Danger
[58:51] harm or loss the word risk is to expose
[58:54] it to Danger harm or loss uh the word
[58:58] reward
[58:59] is a thing that's given in recognition
[59:03] for one's service their effort or
[59:06] achievement right it's it's what you
[59:08] receive in recognition of what you've
[59:11] done uh that's the reward now this term
[59:15] risk and reward is really a it's a
[59:18] business term but when we're talking
[59:20] about Christianity uh we need to
[59:24] understand that we're not taking risks
[59:27] amen what we are doing is stepping out
[59:31] on faith because the Bible tells us
[59:35] without faith it is
[59:38] impossible to please God Amen you you
[59:42] cannot please God if you're not willing
[59:45] to take a step of Faith blessed be the
[59:48] name of the Lord right so so here you
[59:50] know
[59:51] um uh even when I just kind of sort it
[59:54] through uh the message amen I was just
[59:57] looking for where where maybe brother
[59:58] Brandon might have used this word risk
[1:00:00] and there's very little uh quotes where
[1:00:04] he might have used this word rich but I
[1:00:06] did find one that I wanted to share with
[1:00:08] you Amen on today brother Branham talks
[1:00:11] about him taking a particular risk this
[1:00:13] is found in the sermon the power of God
[1:00:16] hallelujah it's found in the sermon the
[1:00:19] power of God and he makes a statement
[1:00:22] here he says here not long ago
[1:00:25] standing in a hospital with a young
[1:00:28] fellow about six seven years ago maybe a
[1:00:32] little better a young man dying with
[1:00:36] black diphtheria okay and he says the
[1:00:39] old dad called me to go pray for the
[1:00:41] baby or the boy rather he was about 15
[1:00:44] years old and the boy was dying and the
[1:00:47] doctor he wouldn't let me go in he said
[1:00:49] you can't go in you got children of your
[1:00:52] own amen glory to God the man is telling
[1:00:56] the prophet you can't go in you got
[1:00:59] children of your own but brother Brandon
[1:01:01] makes a statement but I'll take the
[1:01:04] risks glory to God I like that I'll take
[1:01:08] the risk now goes on and says uh he says
[1:01:10] but you'll take diphtheria to your
[1:01:12] children it's what the doctors tell them
[1:01:14] says he says if I got faith enough
[1:01:17] to go into the diphtheria I got faith
[1:01:21] enough that God won't let my children
[1:01:24] take it
[1:01:26] Hallelujah amen he said you can't do it
[1:01:29] the man was was Catholic by faith I said
[1:01:32] now if I was a priest standing here and
[1:01:36] was going to give the last rights to
[1:01:37] that boy would you let pretty much would
[1:01:39] you let me in he says oh he said that's
[1:01:42] different he said I said no it isn't
[1:01:44] this is just as sacred to us as the last
[1:01:47] rights would be to you and what he's
[1:01:49] saying is just as sacred to us to have
[1:01:52] somebody come and lay hands on the sick
[1:01:54] knowing that God made a promise that
[1:01:57] they will recover no matter what the
[1:01:59] situation is no matter what the
[1:02:01] condition is they will recover
[1:02:04] Hallelujah he said he says uh he says uh
[1:02:07] uh no it isn't it that is it's just uh
[1:02:09] just scared scared to us he says just a
[1:02:12] secret to us that's the last rice would
[1:02:14] be to you well I I out talked him so he
[1:02:17] went up and dressed me up over in white
[1:02:19] and put a big thing over face I couldn't
[1:02:22] hardly see where I was going here I come
[1:02:25] through there with a a gown Dragon way
[1:02:27] behind me you have never known me then I
[1:02:31] walked through there it was all right
[1:02:32] there was there was one way of getting
[1:02:34] they said there was one way of getting
[1:02:36] there and that's following the rules I
[1:02:40] like that how the prophets say that you
[1:02:42] know now now understand he knew that if
[1:02:45] God would give him the ability to walk
[1:02:46] in and pray for that boy he felt that he
[1:02:48] had enough faith that the boy would get
[1:02:50] well not only that I got enough faith
[1:02:52] that I will not con contract the disease
[1:02:54] and I also got faith that I won't take
[1:02:56] it back home to my children
[1:02:57] Hallelujah now he was saying he probably
[1:02:59] said I don't need this soup but he said
[1:03:01] if that's the only way I can get in
[1:03:03] I'mma just follow the rules some of us
[1:03:05] need to stop sometimes and just follow
[1:03:07] the rules
[1:03:08] all right amen stop complaining and
[1:03:11] fussing and fight with people just
[1:03:13] follow the rules you still don't get the
[1:03:15] job done but follow the rules
[1:03:18] look look at what he says here now it
[1:03:21] says um uh uh there was there was one
[1:03:24] way of getting there that's following
[1:03:26] the rules always play the game square
[1:03:28] and you'll win so I went down through
[1:03:31] there and the mother and father went
[1:03:33] along they're laid the board dying being
[1:03:35] unconscious two days I went around I
[1:03:37] tried to talk to him he wouldn't talk so
[1:03:39] I knelt down looked at the father he
[1:03:41] looked at me the tears was in his eyes I
[1:03:44] laid my hands upon the boy I said dear
[1:03:47] heavenly father you said I am the
[1:03:50] resurrection in life you was the one who
[1:03:53] promised us these things and it's and
[1:03:56] and the father and this father of this
[1:03:57] child has called me here to pray
[1:03:59] believing that you sent me to pray for
[1:04:01] the sin and this uh father prayed with
[1:04:04] all my heart the prayer faith that that
[1:04:06] that would touch your garment and with
[1:04:09] unfailing and unfailing Faith as far as
[1:04:11] I know in my heart I believe for this
[1:04:14] young man to recover I said I asked this
[1:04:17] and Jesus Jesus name amen and brother
[1:04:21] random say he raised up now brother Ram
[1:04:23] say pretty much I prayed and I just
[1:04:25] raised up right he says oh Father looked
[1:04:27] over to the mother and said oh mother
[1:04:30] isn't it wonderful now they haven't seen
[1:04:33] anything they haven't felt anything they
[1:04:36] haven't heard anything but just the word
[1:04:38] of prayer that was offered and the
[1:04:40] father began to testify he says oh
[1:04:43] mother looked over to the uh the 000
[1:04:45] father looked over to another said oh
[1:04:47] mother isn't it wonderful the boy is
[1:04:50] just as gone as he ever was he said oh
[1:04:52] I'm so happy it says in the little nurse
[1:04:55] standing there weeping she turned around
[1:04:57] she said sir I don't understand said do
[1:05:00] you know your boy is a dying he said no
[1:05:02] ma'am I don't see he says where you well
[1:05:05] now you see said he said my boy is not
[1:05:07] dying my boy is going to live
[1:05:10] Hallelujah say God promised it say well
[1:05:14] look it's good to have faith she said
[1:05:17] look at this now but said I tell you she
[1:05:20] said some kind of a cardiogram or Emma
[1:05:23] what they was doing some kind of machine
[1:05:24] they put on his heart and said when it
[1:05:27] ever goes down like that it's never been
[1:05:30] known in all medical history for it to
[1:05:32] ever come back again said the boy can't
[1:05:35] live over about uh three to four hours
[1:05:37] and that old man I will never forget he
[1:05:40] put his hand upon the shoulder that
[1:05:42] little young lady probably in her late
[1:05:44] teens he said sister dear she said
[1:05:46] you're looking to that machine
[1:05:51] that's all you got to look to amen but
[1:05:54] I'm looking at a Divine promise
[1:05:57] Hallelujah I'm not looking at my bank
[1:05:59] account and I'm looking at a Divine
[1:06:02] promise come on somebody I'm not looking
[1:06:05] at what I'm limited to look at I'm
[1:06:07] looking at a Divine promise
[1:06:11] Hallelujah no matter what the doctors
[1:06:13] have said look to God's to find promises
[1:06:18] says I'm looking at a Divine promise
[1:06:21] amen the next morning the boy took his
[1:06:24] breakfast and he's married and got
[1:06:26] children I got a child now see the woman
[1:06:29] all she knew was to do just but look at
[1:06:32] me what the machine said but this old
[1:06:35] man looked Faith Pierce beyond that
[1:06:38] that's why I was saying we got a sixth
[1:06:40] sense here church amen we got something
[1:06:42] that other people do not have we can see
[1:06:45] things that other people can't see
[1:06:48] so we're not just taking a risk we
[1:06:50] stepping out on faith we use in the
[1:06:53] sense that God gave us
[1:06:56] somebody say uh brother Jack that don't
[1:06:58] make no sense according right you're
[1:06:59] right because you limited to your five
[1:07:01] senses
[1:07:02] but when you got a sixth sense and only
[1:07:04] Christians have this when you have that
[1:07:07] then then it does make sense
[1:07:10] look at this let's go on he says this
[1:07:13] uh but this old man Faith Pierce beyond
[1:07:15] that and he saw God was able to do the
[1:07:17] exceeding I love this I had to just read
[1:07:20] it to you he saw God was able to do the
[1:07:22] exceedingly abundantly The God Who had
[1:07:25] promised never to fail uh to fail us or
[1:07:29] leave us or forsake us depends on what
[1:07:32] you're looking at the Christian looks at
[1:07:35] things they don't see
[1:07:37] because they walk by faith is that right
[1:07:41] we believe it because the Bible said so
[1:07:43] they believe it you said I believe you
[1:07:48] said
[1:07:49] glory to God is done
[1:07:51] amen that's how we believe is because
[1:07:54] God said so Faith tested
[1:07:58] Faith Trot it proves out a hundred
[1:08:02] percent God's Amber God is under
[1:08:05] obligation to answer
[1:08:08] that faith
[1:08:10] man I tell you when he told Peter to
[1:08:12] come out down the water he was under
[1:08:13] obligation to make sure competed in sync
[1:08:16] you want to know why Peter can't sing
[1:08:18] because I told you to come
[1:08:21] I'm the one told you to come
[1:08:24] so you can't sink
[1:08:26] hey man you can't fail on my word
[1:08:29] you understand that church we cannot
[1:08:31] fail when we're standing on the word of
[1:08:34] God
[1:08:35] amen we might not see this and we might
[1:08:37] not see that it ain't got nothing to do
[1:08:39] but we do see a promise
[1:08:42] I'm the Lord thy God and I supply all
[1:08:45] your needs and you know it's according
[1:08:47] to I love this it's not according to
[1:08:49] Wells Fargo it's not according to PNC
[1:08:53] it's not according to the credit union
[1:08:55] amen but it's according to my riches in
[1:08:58] glory
[1:09:02] that's the God we serve
[1:09:05] risk and reward
[1:09:07] this is something that we we're kind of
[1:09:10] face in in everyday life
[1:09:12] uh I was just as I was meditating on
[1:09:14] this thought you know just a little
[1:09:16] thing came to me even if someone had to
[1:09:18] decide on a surgery
[1:09:20] whether to to to to to to take the
[1:09:22] doctor's advice on on having surgery
[1:09:25] amen are not having surgery you take a
[1:09:28] risk either way
[1:09:31] you know because there's not one doctor
[1:09:33] that'll tell you it's a 100 chance
[1:09:36] they can always say something like it's
[1:09:38] 50 50. oh it might be 40 60. amen they
[1:09:42] they they don't have anything that's
[1:09:44] guaranteed but we do have something
[1:09:47] that's guaranteed this is the word of
[1:09:49] God it's guaranteed we can rest we can
[1:09:52] rest our weight on the Promises of God
[1:09:55] Hallelujah whatever God spoke to us we
[1:09:58] can rest on that
[1:10:01] but even if you decide say whether I
[1:10:03] take surgery or not take some it's a
[1:10:05] risk
[1:10:06] amen and and I'm gonna tell you
[1:10:09] sometimes the only way if you're facing
[1:10:11] a surgery the only way you can get peace
[1:10:13] is not by what the doctor says it's by
[1:10:16] what God speaks to you
[1:10:18] when God speaks to your heart it gives
[1:10:21] you peace and when you have peace you're
[1:10:23] no longer at risk
[1:10:27] when you have peace you're no longer at
[1:10:30] risk you're now at rest
[1:10:34] when God speaks to you he takes you from
[1:10:38] amen this this this feeling of rich but
[1:10:40] now he gives you peace and and now you
[1:10:42] have rest that you know God's gonna
[1:10:45] bring you through no matter what
[1:10:47] it's not the doctor that's doing the
[1:10:49] surgery anyway it's God Amen anointing
[1:10:52] the doctor
[1:10:54] Hallelujah
[1:10:56] glory to God I was also thinking if
[1:10:59] infidelity ever occurs in a in a
[1:11:01] marriage and confessions have to be made
[1:11:04] uh there's a great risk sometimes in
[1:11:07] sharing the information that needs to be
[1:11:09] shared there's a great risk because you
[1:11:11] don't know if your spouse Gonna Leave
[1:11:13] You don't know what they're going to do
[1:11:15] after you share but I can take as much
[1:11:17] the reward and this is spiritual
[1:11:19] liberation
[1:11:21] amen and not only spiritual Liberation
[1:11:24] but it's it's the miracle of
[1:11:26] experiencing emotional healing
[1:11:29] hallelujah amen so sometimes we all are
[1:11:32] faced with things where we have to take
[1:11:34] a risk but but but but remember this now
[1:11:36] when you when you when you're walking by
[1:11:38] faith you actually go beyond just risks
[1:11:42] amen you're standing on the word of God
[1:11:44] I was I was just again meditating and it
[1:11:48] came to my attention
[1:11:50] the widows of Zarephath
[1:11:54] um you know when we talk about risk
[1:11:56] versus reward this woman if we just use
[1:11:59] that term risk amen she was willing to
[1:12:02] risk some water
[1:12:04] come on somebody amen when the prophet
[1:12:07] approached her and says um you know give
[1:12:09] me a little drink fetch me some water
[1:12:12] and give me something to drink you know
[1:12:14] when that lady heard that this old man
[1:12:16] she didn't know he was a prophet she
[1:12:19] didn't know nothing all she knew is that
[1:12:20] this man made me need something because
[1:12:22] we are in a drought condition we're in a
[1:12:24] family condition and don't realize the
[1:12:27] reason that they're in this famine
[1:12:28] condition the man that caused the famine
[1:12:31] is standing at her front gate
[1:12:34] the man that caused the Trap the man
[1:12:36] said it won't be no rain until I call
[1:12:38] for it that man is standing at her front
[1:12:41] gate
[1:12:42] she don't realize who's there but but
[1:12:45] she's she's looking at this old man
[1:12:47] maybe with whiskers on and this man says
[1:12:49] you know just just give me some water
[1:12:51] Hallelujah God has sent him that because
[1:12:53] the brook had dried up and he said just
[1:12:55] give me some water and she took off
[1:12:57] running to go get water for the prophets
[1:12:59] my God but as she's on the way she heard
[1:13:03] the prophet say something
[1:13:04] it said and I bake me a cake
[1:13:07] as well and bring that to me with that
[1:13:09] water and at that point in time I think
[1:13:12] she had reached the limit she couldn't
[1:13:14] take no more she said now I heard you
[1:13:17] say water and I had no problem with that
[1:13:19] but but cake
[1:13:21] take I'm sorry now I only got just
[1:13:24] enough meal here Amen to bake a cake for
[1:13:27] me and my son say I'm gonna let him eat
[1:13:29] as much as he can and I'm gonna eat and
[1:13:31] that's gonna be the last of it we gonna
[1:13:33] die after that
[1:13:35] he said he say now now I understand that
[1:13:37] this is your last and I like this God
[1:13:39] loves to move when when we're in spots
[1:13:42] like that we're down to our last praise
[1:13:45] God this is all I've got but this is
[1:13:48] what I'm gonna give
[1:13:51] he say he said just just I understand
[1:13:53] that the dire situation that you said
[1:13:55] but what I'm gonna ask you to do is bake
[1:13:58] me a cake first oh hallelujah amen bake
[1:14:03] me a cake first and say I guarantee if
[1:14:07] you would bake me a cake first he says
[1:14:10] your Barrel will not go empty and your
[1:14:13] Crews will not run dry
[1:14:16] and he used those famous words and every
[1:14:19] believer a man loves to hear coming out
[1:14:22] of the mouth of God he said God said the
[1:14:25] Lord
[1:14:28] when that lady heard thus saying the
[1:14:30] Lord she went and got that cake prepared
[1:14:32] and gave it to the prophet
[1:14:34] and now I don't know how God did it but
[1:14:37] all I do know is that every time she
[1:14:39] went back to that Barrel there was just
[1:14:42] enough on the inside for her to make
[1:14:44] another cake every time she went to that
[1:14:47] cruise of all there was enough on the
[1:14:49] inside to make another cake and every
[1:14:51] day she went back there was more there
[1:14:54] God will not leave you empty please God
[1:14:58] I said he won't leave you empty amen
[1:15:01] it's gonna be more where that came from
[1:15:03] but be willing to pick God a cake verse
[1:15:11] she had to take the risks
[1:15:14] she had to step out on faith before she
[1:15:17] saw God move on her behalf she had to
[1:15:20] step out on faith
[1:15:22] that's what I was just sharing when we
[1:15:23] gave that fifteen hundred dollars I had
[1:15:25] to take a step of Faith first
[1:15:27] and when I made when I took that step of
[1:15:29] faith I saw God blessed in ways that
[1:15:31] that go be I mean yes they they
[1:15:34] threatened to come take the house but
[1:15:36] I'm still living there
[1:15:38] I'm still living there
[1:15:40] and here's what here's what here's

[1:16:07] my way all I do is take the devil back
[1:16:09] to the promise I didn't make the promise

[1:16:15] don't have to keep the promise

[1:16:32] told me if I brought my tires in my
[1:16:34] offering he said to me I will reputed
[1:16:39] devour for your sakes and then he said
[1:16:43] I'll open up the winners of heaven and
[1:16:45] pour you out blessings when you have
[1:16:48] room not enough to receive brother I
[1:16:51] stood on the promise since I stood on my
[1:16:54] promise and God did exactly what he
[1:16:57] promised me
[1:17:00] hey take a step of Faith this is not a
[1:17:04] risk this is a step of faith

[1:17:27] faith
[1:17:30] and if he bids you come

[1:17:57] glory to God oh blessed be the name of
[1:18:01] the Lord
[1:18:02] hey man that Widow of seraphap took a
[1:18:05] step of Faith after after she heard thus
[1:18:07] said the Lord and her reward was that
[1:18:09] her Barrel did not go empty in her Crews
[1:18:12] did not fail
[1:18:14] we were reading amen I told you this
[1:18:17] whole uh thought came to me as I was
[1:18:20] reading through uh some devotions amen a
[1:18:23] cousin of mine brought this devotional
[1:18:25] book for me for Christmas and and I'm
[1:18:27] grateful for it amen and as I was
[1:18:30] reading it I told you in January 4th
[1:18:31] January 14th they had a devotion on
[1:18:34] there it says when God asked you to
[1:18:37] follow him
[1:18:38] he often doesn't give all the
[1:18:40] information about what risk
[1:18:44] about what is happening right away he
[1:18:47] says when you step out in faith he he
[1:18:50] gives guidance as you go
[1:18:53] Moses risks his life by approaching
[1:18:55] pharaoh and leading the Israelite side
[1:18:57] of Israel Israelite side of captivity
[1:18:59] Mary risk her marriage her reputation
[1:19:02] and her future by becoming the mother of
[1:19:04] Jesus and I want to say this by yielding
[1:19:07] to the prophecy of a virgin shall
[1:19:08] conceive following God's will is not
[1:19:11] without risk the only thing more risky
[1:19:15] than trusting God is not trusting him
[1:19:21] as I've thought about that there's a
[1:19:23] little a quote that came to me that I
[1:19:25] want to read to you out of the message
[1:19:26] the mighty conqueror
[1:19:28] brother Branham makes this statement in
[1:19:31] this sermon he says
[1:19:33] but as they went along the road that
[1:19:35] morning I can just see them oh my the
[1:19:38] greatest blow that ever happened to them
[1:19:41] here they was on the road
[1:19:43] that left their Church
[1:19:45] excommunicated for following him
[1:19:48] they thought surely he would do
[1:19:52] something
[1:19:53] uh Triumph there at the grave
[1:19:56] then they were taken from the church
[1:19:58] they couldn't return to church anymore
[1:20:00] and they would be branded mock that
[1:20:03] laugh that made fun of and that's the
[1:20:06] way a man does when he really sets out
[1:20:08] for Christ he has to cut every Shoreline
[1:20:11] to walk alone with Christ him alone and
[1:20:15] men and women of this world who have
[1:20:17] ever amounted to anything are men and
[1:20:19] women who have predominantly taken
[1:20:21] Christ for their Savior and stood alone
[1:20:23] in their decision amen it'll be the same
[1:20:27] way with every man here this morning or
[1:20:30] every woman boy a girl if you ever wish
[1:20:32] to amount to anything go forward with
[1:20:35] God don't trust your church don't trust
[1:20:38] your preacher your Rabbi your priest but
[1:20:41] stand alone in Christ Jesus it's the
[1:20:43] only way you can do it
[1:20:46] now when I read that amen I I can I can
[1:20:49] look around this this audience and I
[1:20:52] know there's many people that had to
[1:20:53] take a step of Faith like that
[1:20:55] hey when when they first told people I'm
[1:20:58] going to be a part of spirit and Truth
[1:21:00] Tabernacle or maybe you didn't tell them
[1:21:01] you they just found out that you was
[1:21:03] here hello somebody
[1:21:06] amen because it was risky it was a brand
[1:21:09] new ministry but 21 years later we still
[1:21:12] standing
[1:21:15] it was risky
[1:21:16] hey I mean CeCe Winans just to sing a
[1:21:20] song it wasn't easy
[1:21:22] but it was worth it
[1:21:24] glory to God you know and I was just
[1:21:26] sitting back there listening to the song
[1:21:28] service and you know I'm saying we might
[1:21:30] be in a school but we still know how to
[1:21:32] praise him
[1:21:34] and I'm gonna tell you the environment
[1:21:36] or the atmosphere that it's created
[1:21:38] right here in this place is greater than
[1:21:40] some atmospheres where people have their
[1:21:42] own building
[1:21:44] so it's not the building that makes us
[1:21:46] it's what God has done in our heart that
[1:21:49] makes us
[1:21:50] glory to God Amen will praise Him Amen

[1:23:18] Glory Glory Glory Glory
[1:23:21] my God my God my car
[1:23:27] amen Church
[1:23:31] many many took a risk
[1:23:34] many took a risk some of us left some
[1:23:37] very comfortable situations
[1:23:39] but took a risk we stepped out on faith
[1:23:43] I remember a comment that my mama made
[1:23:45] me made to me years ago and and it just
[1:23:48] blessed my heart I hold on to it it's
[1:23:50] very dear to me
[1:23:51] when Mama first started coming here as a
[1:23:54] fellowship you know she uh she she made
[1:23:56] a statement she said I I I said that I
[1:24:00] think I need to go help the ministry
[1:24:02] I need to go there and I need to help
[1:24:04] the ministry and I appreciate that but
[1:24:06] she said she said but when I got here I
[1:24:08] realized that I wasn't helping the
[1:24:09] ministry
[1:24:11] the ministry is helping me
[1:24:16] and if the ministry can't help you
[1:24:20] if the ministry has not helped you and
[1:24:22] it can't help you you might be in the
[1:24:23] wrong place
[1:24:25] and it's not just my Ministry at all
[1:24:27] these ministers that come up here they
[1:24:30] should be able to help you
[1:24:33] know another thing that I just I like to
[1:24:36] say this you need to know this uh so so
[1:24:38] I'm a preacher that wants to minister to
[1:24:40] the whole person
[1:24:44] we want to minister to your whole being

[1:25:04] and your family we want to talk about
[1:25:06] that we want to minister to the whole
[1:25:08] person
[1:25:12] it was a risk but there's been a great
[1:25:15] reward and and I I'm talking about I can
[1:25:18] praise God before before my blessing
[1:25:22] I can praise him because I know it's
[1:25:24] been a great can I say it like this if
[1:25:26] God
[1:25:27] don't do no more than what he already
[1:25:30] done
[1:25:31] he's done enough to deserve my praise
[1:25:35] [Applause]
[1:25:40] and you know that I put the word if God
[1:25:42] because I don't believe I believe God
[1:25:44] got so much more I believe that
[1:25:47] I believe he got the exceeding
[1:25:50] the abundant
[1:25:52] above all we can ask or even
[1:25:56] even think
[1:25:59] amen
[1:26:01] oh my I'm trying to get back here I
[1:26:03] wrote in my Bible I put it here you know
[1:26:05] brother Jacinda had come and preached
[1:26:07] and he challenged all of us you know
[1:26:09] write some things down that you want
[1:26:10] from God and put it inside your Bible
[1:26:12] and I took it and I stuck it inside the
[1:26:14] Bible and I left it there and it's been
[1:26:16] there for a while and uh there are
[1:26:17] certain things that I put there
[1:26:18] sometimes I have to go back and add
[1:26:20] things to the list but I keep it on the
[1:26:22] word and uh and one of the things I
[1:26:24] asked God for is not just for church and
[1:26:26] school but I asked him for a church debt
[1:26:29] free
[1:26:32] I asked God for debt free
[1:26:36] now I don't know how we're gonna get
[1:26:38] there
[1:26:39] to debt-free I don't know what God's
[1:26:41] plan is
[1:26:42] but I do know this it's gonna be debt
[1:26:44] free
[1:26:54] David risks his life
[1:26:59] and facing Goliath
[1:27:02] uh and I just love this because David he
[1:27:06] just couldn't stand to see this
[1:27:08] uncircumcised Philistine uh stand and
[1:27:12] defy the armies of the Living God
[1:27:14] now David was um you know watching over
[1:27:17] his father's sheep and just so happened
[1:27:19] this particular day his daddy said I
[1:27:21] need you to take some food down there to
[1:27:22] your brothers they're in the battle and
[1:27:24] and I want you to take some food down
[1:27:26] there to him and uh and as David is
[1:27:28] approaching he's seeing all the soldiers
[1:27:30] take for cover
[1:27:32] everybody running and David just
[1:27:34] beginning to wonder like well why is
[1:27:36] everybody running what's going on daddy
[1:27:38] say I was in battle but y'all ain't in
[1:27:40] battle y'all out here running
[1:27:41] what's going on and David also look up
[1:27:43] and they see this big giant of a man
[1:27:46] come out and issue a challenge say now
[1:27:48] look we don't have to have all this
[1:27:50] Bloodshed just send one man out here and
[1:27:53] if you get if you bring one man if I
[1:27:55] kill him then you all serve us but if he
[1:27:58] killed me then we'll serve y'all that'll
[1:28:01] be that'll be the contract that'll be
[1:28:02] the deal and David looked at the
[1:28:04] spelling me sorry about it running from
[1:28:06] him and he's like well what's the reward
[1:28:08] for somebody that would face this guy he
[1:28:10] said well you know you're getting
[1:28:11] married the King's Daughter this will
[1:28:13] happen now I'm saying well I really I'm
[1:28:15] not really uh interested in all the
[1:28:16] rewards but I am interested in not
[1:28:18] seeing amen the the name of my God
[1:28:21] defied
[1:28:24] it says now uh uh who do I need to talk
[1:28:26] to to go out here so everybody take off
[1:28:28] from his brother said learn what you're
[1:28:30] so naughty get out of here go back home
[1:28:31] to Dad you you're not even a warrior
[1:28:33] don't cut my hand don't don't don't act
[1:28:35] like you can do nothing about this
[1:28:37] so I I'm just kind of I'm kind of tired
[1:28:39] of this guy you know doing this and
[1:28:41] David started talking amongst the camp
[1:28:43] and next thing one of these guys are
[1:28:44] hearing David talk they're like wait a
[1:28:46] minute this guy talking different than
[1:28:47] everybody else and he's not running he's
[1:28:49] not afraid of him say no I ain't afraid
[1:28:51] you know what fellas i i i i i i a bear
[1:28:55] come up one time and got one of my
[1:28:56] daddy's sheep I went out after that bear
[1:28:58] because a bear sometimes can be just as
[1:29:00] tall as a Goliath
[1:29:03] so not only that there was a lion come
[1:29:05] up one time and got one of my daddy's
[1:29:07] sheep and you know I went out after that
[1:29:08] after that after that line he said and
[1:29:10] you know what I defeated both the bear
[1:29:12] and the lion and I think I can take this
[1:29:14] guy out
[1:29:16] they say wait wait wait maybe we need to
[1:29:18] get you in touch with Saul
[1:29:20] David goes and they introduce him to
[1:29:22] Saul and Saul said well are we here that
[1:29:24] you're talking that you want to go out
[1:29:26] here and face Goliath now you realize
[1:29:27] this is a great rich young man you could
[1:29:30] lose your life out here he says he says
[1:29:32] I'll tell you what I'll tell you what I
[1:29:33] got some armor that I want to give you
[1:29:36] why don't you put this armor and you go
[1:29:37] out there he says look
[1:29:39] I ain't tried none of this stuff that
[1:29:41] you're giving me he says but what I do
[1:29:43] know is that God delivered me from a
[1:29:45] bear and what I do know is God delivered
[1:29:48] me from a lion not just me but me and
[1:29:50] the Sheep I can I can go off my past
[1:29:54] experiences I know what God has already
[1:29:57] done and if he did it before praise God
[1:30:01] he will do it again
[1:30:05] now David can have this type of
[1:30:08] confidence
[1:30:09] and another another word that people use
[1:30:11] nowadays is God for dance
[1:30:14] he can have this type of God for dance
[1:30:17] because he knew what God had already
[1:30:19] done for the other thing David knew is
[1:30:21] that he was already the pre-anointed
[1:30:24] king so there was nothing that could
[1:30:27] happen that painted on the battlefield
[1:30:29] until he became king
[1:30:33] he was willing to take a step of faith
[1:30:36] he said I'll go face this Goliath and
[1:30:38] David said I'm not taking your your arm
[1:30:40] I'm not taking your spear but I'm taking
[1:30:42] a rock five rocks and a sling that's all
[1:30:45] I need Hallelujah it look it look look
[1:30:48] look look ridiculous how you gonna go
[1:30:51] face a giant praise cop amen when I when
[1:30:54] I start thinking about this I was
[1:30:56] preaching to myself at home
[1:30:57] amen and I can see Goliath coming out to
[1:31:01] the battlefield Goliath got his sword
[1:31:03] Goliath got a another man carrying his
[1:31:07] shield because I've got all this armor
[1:31:10] on Goliath got his helmet on praise God
[1:31:12] maybe he got shields on his arms you got
[1:31:15] to look at him he got his knees covered
[1:31:17] everything on Goliath is Covenant David
[1:31:19] got five rocks Amen in a sling there was
[1:31:23] only one spot
[1:31:26] and all this Army that Goliath had there
[1:31:29] was only one spot that was available for
[1:31:32] a direct blow praise His holy name and
[1:31:35] that was right in the center of the
[1:31:37] forehead the forehead is where you
[1:31:39] holding your Revelation praise His holy
[1:31:42] name
[1:31:42] it's where God gives you peace he gives
[1:31:45] you Revelation right there
[1:31:48] David took that sling and said look you
[1:31:51] coming and Define the armies of the
[1:31:53] Living God but I come to you in the name
[1:31:55] of the Lord God Goliath say I'm gonna
[1:31:58] feed your your flesh to the fouls he
[1:32:00] said we don't see whose flesh you feed
[1:32:03] praise God he picked up that rock began
[1:32:06] to sling it
[1:32:08] Glory he released one rock one
[1:32:11] Revelation one rock he stood on he threw
[1:32:15] that rock and hit him right in the
[1:32:17] center of the head knocked the giant
[1:32:19] down
[1:32:20] he didn't need the other four rocks one
[1:32:22] rock would do it all
[1:32:27] down goes Goliath
[1:32:30] but the map the battle wasn't over yet
[1:32:33] David went over and took his own sword
[1:32:37] you came with just what I told you who
[1:32:39] who gonna be fed to and these birds
[1:32:41] gonna have a lot to eat today
[1:32:43] took his sword and chopped his head off
[1:32:46] but he was willing to risk his life
[1:32:50] it brought encouragement it brought
[1:32:52] strength to the others when they saw
[1:32:54] what David did they knew that they could
[1:32:56] do the same thing
[1:32:58] somebody's got to be willing to risk
[1:33:00] something somebody's got to be willing
[1:33:02] to take a step of faith
[1:33:03] brother random makes this statement and
[1:33:05] works his faith Express
[1:33:08] David with a separate sling
[1:33:11] expressed the whole Israelite Army the
[1:33:14] faith that he had in their God
[1:33:17] now there was Goliath on the other side
[1:33:19] and he stood out there and made his
[1:33:22] boasts many times bigger than David
[1:33:24] he had fingers 14 inches long and he was
[1:33:28] a mammoth big fella the Philistine Giant
[1:33:31] and here was David the smallest one he
[1:33:33] was even too little to be in the army a
[1:33:36] man too much of a runt they couldn't use
[1:33:39] him so his brothers was out there in the
[1:33:41] Army and then Goliath was making his
[1:33:43] boasts but David now remember it was
[1:33:46] revealed to David he thought here's the
[1:33:48] armies of the Living God standing in
[1:33:50] their own land and there's a boasting
[1:33:52] uncircumcised Philistine out there we'll
[1:33:55] call him cancer tonight we'll call him
[1:33:58] paralytic that's that uncircumcised
[1:34:00] philistine praise God we'll call them
[1:34:03] stroke he's a liar praise God and
[1:34:07] everything must be reversed
[1:34:10] in the name of Jesus it says why David
[1:34:13] was no kind of a match for him not with
[1:34:16] any kind of a weapon he was no match
[1:34:19] that man's shoulder was probably 10 12
[1:34:22] foot across he was probably standing 14
[1:34:24] 15 foot high a spear like a Weaver's
[1:34:27] needed probably 20 foot low the blade on
[1:34:30] it maybe four foot across
[1:34:33] and Little David standing there with a
[1:34:36] little piece of leather goat skin or
[1:34:37] sheepskin with two pieces of string tied
[1:34:40] to it uh he says but it was revealed to
[1:34:43] him Revelation struck him amen he said
[1:34:46] the god that took me out of the palms of
[1:34:49] the bear that took me out of the poison
[1:34:51] lion how much more will he deliver that
[1:34:55] uncircumcised Philistine in my hand
[1:34:58] amen we got to remember what God has
[1:35:00] already brought us from
[1:35:02] If He Did It Before He will do it again
[1:35:06] he's the same yesterday the day and
[1:35:09] forever
[1:35:11] the next uh uh uh
[1:35:14] devotion on January 15th it said no
[1:35:18] great things happen without some risks
[1:35:21] nor risked his reputation by believing
[1:35:23] that God would flood the Earth
[1:35:25] as he said he would Abraham left his
[1:35:28] home and Country to go where God sent
[1:35:30] him
[1:35:31] those who walk close to God have
[1:35:33] evidence based on their past experiences
[1:35:36] that God is real and active in the lives
[1:35:40] of those who love him and look at this
[1:35:42] this statement God loves to accomplish
[1:35:45] The Impossible in the lives of his
[1:35:49] people
[1:35:50] that was in my devotion God loves to
[1:35:53] accomplish
[1:35:54] The Impossible
[1:35:58] move the immovable
[1:36:01] break the unbreakable come on Church
[1:36:05] he'll do the impossible he lost
[1:36:07] accomplished The Impossible in the lives
[1:36:10] of his people
[1:36:11] they said take him up on it
[1:36:13] and I thought about this scripture amen
[1:36:16] uh second chronicles 16 starting at
[1:36:19] verse 7.
[1:36:21] amen God loves accomplished The
[1:36:23] Impossible in the lives of people amen
[1:36:25] second chronicles 16 verse 7 let's start
[1:36:28] there the Bible says this and at that
[1:36:31] time
[1:36:32] Hannah and I The Seer came to ASA king
[1:36:36] of Judah this is the prophet coming to
[1:36:38] the king and said to him because thou
[1:36:41] has relied on the king of Syria
[1:36:44] oh my and not relied on the Lord thy God
[1:36:49] therefore is the host of the king of
[1:36:51] fear escaped out of our hand so when
[1:36:53] they were getting ready to go to battle
[1:36:54] what he did was go out and hire amen
[1:36:57] another Army to try to come and help
[1:36:59] them out and he was relying on the
[1:37:01] strength of this other Army amen we got
[1:37:03] to learn to rely on the strength of God
[1:37:07] we all do our part but God is up to God
[1:37:10] to do everything
[1:37:12] you know what whatever you give God got
[1:37:14] to give it to you to be able to give
[1:37:17] it's God that got to bring it all
[1:37:19] together
[1:37:20] hallelujah hallelujah he said that the
[1:37:22] the king of Syria escaped out of her
[1:37:24] hand were not the Ethiopians he reminded
[1:37:27] him of some things that God had already
[1:37:29] brought him through were not the
[1:37:30] Ethiopians and the lubens are a huge
[1:37:33] hosts with very many cherished and
[1:37:35] Horsemen yet because thou this rely on
[1:37:38] on the Lord he delivered them into thine
[1:37:42] hand watch this watch this this one of
[1:37:44] my favorite verses for the eyes
[1:37:47] of the Lord
[1:37:49] run
[1:37:50] come on hear me walking running
[1:37:54] for the eyes of the Lord run to and fro
[1:37:58] throughout the whole Earth
[1:38:00] to show himself strong in the behalf of
[1:38:03] them whose heart is perfect toward him
[1:38:07] oh I like that
[1:38:09] here and there are some fools and
[1:38:10] therefore from his foot Thou shalt have
[1:38:12] wars I like that the eyes of the Lord
[1:38:15] run to and fro throughout the whole
[1:38:19] earth to show himself strong in the
[1:38:23] behalf of Demo's heart is perfect for
[1:38:25] him that means god is looking for
[1:38:27] something to get involved with
[1:38:31] do you have a situation
[1:38:33] do you have a circumstance
[1:38:36] God is looking he's running here and
[1:38:39] he's running there looking for somewhere
[1:38:43] to get involved in something because
[1:38:45] when he gets involved it only brings him
[1:38:48] more Glory
[1:38:53] and when I read scriptures like that
[1:38:55] there's an old song that comes to mind
[1:38:59] somebody needs a lord
[1:39:03] come by here hey somebody needs you Lord
[1:39:08] I'm talking about in West Palm Beach
[1:39:10] come by here hey somebody needs your
[1:39:14] love at Spirit and Truth Tabernacle come
[1:39:17] by here
[1:39:21] oh
[1:39:25] [Music]
[1:39:28] the Bible says that you run to and fro
[1:39:32] throughout the whole earth are we on the
[1:39:35] Earth
[1:39:35] do we have a need where God is coming to
[1:39:39] get involved
[1:39:42] and when he shows up the miraculous
[1:39:44] things begin to happen
[1:39:51] see I told you I'm standing on the words
[1:39:53] and when I'm standing the word the devil
[1:39:55] ain't got a chance then
[1:39:57] because I know I'm standing on Solid
[1:39:59] Ground
[1:40:03] oh how I thank God
[1:40:08] the next one January 16th the devotion
[1:40:10] said
[1:40:12] used to be ready to risk resources
[1:40:15] what was the woman the Widow of
[1:40:17] Zarephath willing to risk her resources
[1:40:21] all I got is just a little I mean the
[1:40:24] water was no problem I I I you know I
[1:40:27] give some water but my my last cake
[1:40:30] my last one
[1:40:33] you should you should ask God
[1:40:37] thus saith the Lord if you will bake me
[1:40:41] a cake first
[1:40:43] Earth
[1:40:44] you won't die
[1:40:46] yes son now he didn't tell them that but
[1:40:50] he knew this that if she if if he and
[1:40:52] she were able to eat it would sustain
[1:40:55] them and they wouldn't die you don't
[1:40:57] even have to think about death no more
[1:40:58] sister
[1:41:00] praise God if you just bake me a cake
[1:41:02] first
[1:41:04] she was willing to risk her resources
[1:41:09] the
[1:41:10] devotion said you should be ready to
[1:41:13] risk resources
[1:41:14] reputation
[1:41:17] and even some relationships
[1:41:20] in order to be faithful to God
[1:41:23] Joshua and Caleb unlike the other spies
[1:41:27] were willing to risk everything because
[1:41:29] they trusted God's promises more than
[1:41:32] their human fears can I just Camp there
[1:41:34] just for a little bit
[1:41:36] everybody going I mean it's 12 of us
[1:41:39] chosen to go and just spell uh spout the
[1:41:42] land
[1:41:43] and y'all heard brother Quinton talk
[1:41:46] about that last week it's a few spies
[1:41:47] went in
[1:41:49] you got to understand there's a lot
[1:41:51] being said in that statement
[1:41:53] because if they spies from us
[1:41:58] then they're still part of us
[1:42:03] I don't know I hope you get that
[1:42:06] if if you left us then you're still part
[1:42:09] of us
[1:42:10] look this word ain't gonna let you go I
[1:42:12] don't care where you go this word will
[1:42:14] not release you
[1:42:18] so somewhere down the line we'll see him
[1:42:21] again
[1:42:23] but here the spies run off into the land
[1:42:26] and and and just to be selected as a spy
[1:42:29] was a great honor
[1:42:31] but here they go into the land and and
[1:42:33] they partaking of eating of the grapes
[1:42:35] they they see it flowing with milk and
[1:42:38] honey they they I mean they're carrying
[1:42:40] the grapes on their shoulders the two
[1:42:41] men got to care Oh cluster by themselves
[1:42:44] it's just it's just it's just Rich it's
[1:42:47] abundant I mean they see Otis they
[1:42:49] partake in of it
[1:42:52] but when they got back to the camp they
[1:42:55] share all the good news and at the end
[1:42:58] of sharing all the good news they put a
[1:42:59] butt
[1:43:02] but
[1:43:04] there are giants in the land
[1:43:07] and uh we look like
[1:43:11] grasshoppers amen compared to these
[1:43:14] these guys here we we probably better
[1:43:16] not go up and do that and Joshua and
[1:43:18] Caleb my God had a different spirit
[1:43:22] Joshua and Caleb said nah nah nah wait a
[1:43:24] minute God made us a promise he told us
[1:43:28] that we were going to have a promised
[1:43:29] land did not he bring us out of Egypt
[1:43:31] didn't I tell him open up the Red Sea
[1:43:35] did not y'all see Pharaoh's Army
[1:43:37] drowning it why are we scared now
[1:43:39] if God made the promise he's going to
[1:43:41] cast all the way through
[1:43:46] the Bible say they steal the people
[1:43:49] because they took him back to the word
[1:43:51] they still to be and the people stopped
[1:43:52] picked up Stones ready to try to crush
[1:43:54] the testimony
[1:43:56] but I'll tell you what if God is for you
[1:43:58] who can be against you
[1:44:00] and because of the people's unbelief it
[1:44:03] stop them
[1:44:05] from actually experiencing the promised
[1:44:07] land but Joshua and Caleb because of
[1:44:09] their holy following the Lord
[1:44:12] they went in and got they promised
[1:44:15] amen yesterday I was picking up some
[1:44:17] groceries amen my wife had you know and
[1:44:20] I'm I'm reaching out there and I had a
[1:44:22] smoothie in one hand and groceries in
[1:44:23] the other hand
[1:44:24] and Marshall you got all that I said
[1:44:25] yeah yeah I got it I got it I got it and
[1:44:28] she said she say uh you she'll say yeah
[1:44:30] I got I say I'm just as strong now as I
[1:44:33] was the first day I crossed Jordan
[1:44:37] she said all right Caleb
[1:44:42] but you gotta know who you are you got
[1:44:44] to know the promise that God Made You
[1:44:46] and Caleb knew that God made him a
[1:44:48] promise and and and even even God gave
[1:44:51] him not just the promise of of of of the
[1:44:53] land but he also got an extra promise
[1:44:55] that he was going to get he brung
[1:44:56] because he believed
[1:44:59] that take that land
[1:45:01] I'm gonna tell you something if you just
[1:45:02] take a a step of faith God might have a
[1:45:05] little extra for you
[1:45:07] that that you don't know about and it
[1:45:09] was at 45 years later
[1:45:11] when Caleb said you're not now look I'm
[1:45:14] just as strong as I was when when I when
[1:45:16] we crossed Jordan and you know and I
[1:45:18] knew we was going to get this land I I
[1:45:19] told him that 45 years ago but I ain't
[1:45:22] just satisfied just being in the land
[1:45:25] give me
[1:45:27] this mountain
[1:45:29] not just any mountain this mountain and
[1:45:32] Hebron was a very special Mountain
[1:45:35] but give me this mountain
[1:45:37] my God he got everything that he wanted
[1:45:40] and more because he was willing
[1:45:43] to take a step of faith
[1:45:48] in this message
[1:45:49] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:45:51] and forever
[1:45:53] brother random makes this uh statement
[1:45:55] oh and I forgot to read the rest of that
[1:45:58] um God already promised his rights to
[1:46:00] land all they had to do was take it God
[1:46:02] has made many promises and worked for
[1:46:03] his people will you take the risk of
[1:46:05] moving ahead and claiming them or will
[1:46:08] you lose heart and Mr blessing God has
[1:46:10] in store for you
[1:46:11] hearing the message Jesus Christ the
[1:46:13] same yesterday today and forever brother
[1:46:15] Brandon makes a statement look I want to
[1:46:17] say something to you
[1:46:18] there were some lepers
[1:46:21] at the gate one time at Samaria
[1:46:24] when it was besieged by the syrians
[1:46:27] they said why do we sit here till we die
[1:46:31] they were starving to death
[1:46:33] they was eating one another's children
[1:46:36] right in the city uh they they said if
[1:46:40] we sat here
[1:46:42] we die if we go in the city
[1:46:46] we die so if the only hope that we have
[1:46:49] is go down to the Samaritans if they
[1:46:53] save us we live
[1:46:55] but if they kill us
[1:46:57] we die whatever we're whatever we're
[1:47:01] going to die anyhow
[1:47:03] right so let's take a chance a risk
[1:47:06] let's take a chance on going down
[1:47:09] do you know the story a man amen and if
[1:47:13] you don't know the story let me just
[1:47:14] explain it to you when these boys took
[1:47:18] the took the risk to go down into amen
[1:47:20] the camp of the syrians amen they do say
[1:47:22] if we go back in the city they're gonna
[1:47:24] kill us we sit out here we're going to
[1:47:25] die if we go down there to the enemies
[1:47:27] Camp they might kill us wherever we go
[1:47:29] we might die so we might as well just
[1:47:31] try to take a chance and go down here to
[1:47:33] the camp of the enemy
[1:47:34] they got up four boys just began to walk
[1:47:37] glory to God towards the camp of the
[1:47:40] enemy and as they begin to step forward
[1:47:44] God got inside of their steps
[1:47:47] and it sounded like a great Army was
[1:47:49] coming rather than four men coming the
[1:47:52] Army sounds so great that the series got
[1:47:55] up from there they say they don't hire
[1:47:57] people against us and we got to get out
[1:47:58] of here right now they left all this
[1:48:01] stuff
[1:48:05] God had extra blessing for they left all
[1:48:08] these stuff they left their money they
[1:48:12] let their food they love their jewelry
[1:48:15] they love everything because God got in
[1:48:18] the steps of somebody that was willing
[1:48:20] to take a step of faith
[1:48:24] and in one day's time
[1:48:27] Israel went from being in famine to
[1:48:30] being in an abundance
[1:48:35] well that should tell you that it don't
[1:48:37] take God long to move
[1:48:39] one day's time we can go from famine to
[1:48:42] abundance but we have to First Take A
[1:48:47] oh yeah
[1:48:49] [Applause]
[1:48:53] God bless them they got so much they
[1:48:55] were sitting there eating and hiding
[1:48:57] eating and hiding like then they said
[1:48:58] look we done we done
[1:48:59] we're doing wrong we're doing wrong
[1:49:02] we gotta go tell somebody that this
[1:49:04] stuff is here we gotta go tell them and
[1:49:06] they went back into the City and the
[1:49:07] city they said now we can't believe that
[1:49:09] we can't believe it and the prophet of
[1:49:10] death spoke like the day before what was
[1:49:12] going to happen and after and one guy
[1:49:14] said if that happened you know I don't
[1:49:16] know it's prophecy I'll tell you what
[1:49:17] since you doubt it
[1:49:19] since you doubt it
[1:49:21] but you're going to hear about it but
[1:49:22] you won't be able to partake of it
[1:49:27] and when they come to the port and he
[1:49:29] went telling everybody that man got
[1:49:31] trampled in the streets and was not able
[1:49:33] to he died in the streets but it's
[1:49:36] because he failed to believe and not
[1:49:38] just believe let me tell you let me go a
[1:49:39] little further be careful what you say
[1:49:44] don't say the wrong thing
[1:49:46] don't say the wrong thing
[1:49:48] and well I'm just speaking the truth
[1:49:51] who's truth
[1:49:53] whose truth are you speaking because
[1:49:55] what you're saying is not my truth
[1:49:58] it might be doubt that you're releasing
[1:50:00] so just be careful what you say
[1:50:02] Hallelujah but that man said the wrong
[1:50:05] thing and he ended up dying in the
[1:50:06] streets and and they went down there and
[1:50:09] they realized man all this stuff to
[1:50:11] armies are left us and we're sitting up
[1:50:12] here with no no this and know that no
[1:50:14] all we had to do is take a step of faith

[1:53:07] this is Florida praise God this is West
[1:53:10] Palm Beach this where you placed us
[1:53:14] but you're looking for something we got
[1:53:16] something for you
[1:53:20] there's only one hope left for you
[1:53:22] that's in Jesus Christ take it believe
[1:53:24] it hold on to it say if God God of you
[1:53:26] others can I can too and you're my God
[1:53:29] the same as you were theirs
[1:53:33] I thank God for this
[1:53:35] there's many a man in Scripture
[1:53:42] that we could go back to and just look
[1:53:44] at and and some and and and and what I
[1:53:47] was I would call a uh a negative
[1:53:50] comparison
[1:53:52] one of those is Eve she took a risk
[1:53:56] Eve wrists by eating from the the tree
[1:53:59] of knowledge Good and Evil
[1:54:02] rather than eating from the Tree of Life
[1:54:03] she ate from the knowledge from the Tree
[1:54:05] of knowledge Good and Evil and It
[1:54:08] produced a reward God told him that the
[1:54:10] day that they did that it they would die
[1:54:12] and the producer what she got was the
[1:54:15] multiplication of sorrow in her
[1:54:17] conception she would bring forth
[1:54:19] children through Labor and she also lost
[1:54:22] the the ability of being co-equal with
[1:54:24] her husband
[1:54:26] Eve lost a lot when she when she doubted
[1:54:29] the word of God after after the fall
[1:54:31] after the fall her husband was supposed
[1:54:34] to be ruler over her
[1:54:36] Eve lost that ability to be co-equal
[1:54:38] after the fall she took a risk she was
[1:54:42] rewarded with negative things if you
[1:54:45] take the wrong risk you'll get rewarded
[1:54:47] with negative things
[1:54:49] another a man that we can look at
[1:54:53] um here
[1:54:54] my so many others let me just kind of uh
[1:54:58] throw this one Samson took a risk
[1:55:01] by sharing his secrets of his strength
[1:55:04] with Delilah
[1:55:05] thinking that she was just playing
[1:55:08] when when she was you know Samson the
[1:55:11] Philistines are pumped thee and now now
[1:55:14] he looked around he saw them Philistines
[1:55:16] there but he kept going back and laying
[1:55:18] in her lap
[1:55:20] he took a risk every time he went down
[1:55:23] to Delilah's house he was taking a risk
[1:55:26] just to get married to Amen to try to
[1:55:30] get married to a man of philistine that
[1:55:33] was a big risk any Young Brother young
[1:55:36] sister that might think about marriage
[1:55:38] somebody that's not a Christian you're
[1:55:40] taking a great risk
[1:55:42] and you'll be rewarded
[1:55:46] you'll be rewarded for it too let me
[1:55:48] tell you and it won't be a reward that
[1:55:50] you will enjoy
[1:55:52] don't take that type of risk wait for
[1:55:55] God to send you somebody
[1:55:58] let me tell you something you you live
[1:56:00] better single without having somebody
[1:56:02] like that
[1:56:04] but don't take the risks
[1:56:07] Samson kept taking a risk going down
[1:56:09] here to this lady house going down and
[1:56:11] see Samson tell me what the stream where
[1:56:13] your strength is oh it's here and it's
[1:56:14] there uh Samson the Philistines upon you
[1:56:17] look around and bust out of it and they
[1:56:18] said these guys will never get me well
[1:56:21] he kept going kept going finally Samson
[1:56:24] and she just threw the tears on him
[1:56:27] Samson you didn't lie to me I thought
[1:56:30] you loved me since I can't believe you
[1:56:32] make me look you make me so embarrassed
[1:56:34] in front of my own people
[1:56:36] you just dissing you that and I thought
[1:56:38] you loved me you wanted me to be your
[1:56:40] wife how can you treat me like this
[1:56:41] finally some I mean it just it just kept
[1:56:44] bringing them lower and Lord say you
[1:56:46] know what here it is the secret is if
[1:56:49] you cut my hair
[1:56:51] if you take if you take a man say that I
[1:56:54] had a covenant with God but if you take
[1:56:56] that Covenant away take my hair then
[1:56:58] I'll be just like any other man
[1:57:01] here's why he's laying down sleeping she
[1:57:04] gets the Clippers out cuts his hair
[1:57:06] and then she tapped some Samson
[1:57:09] Phyllis finds her opinion he jump up
[1:57:11] like he always did but this time
[1:57:14] no strength
[1:57:16] his God that left him
[1:57:20] took him and put him in bondage and man
[1:57:24] they treated him so bad took his eyes
[1:57:26] out
[1:57:27] they were so so I mean they say we
[1:57:29] finally got this fella you know I mean
[1:57:31] he he done killed my dad and he killed
[1:57:34] your daddy too he did yeah he get my
[1:57:35] uncle he get he done did so much we
[1:57:37] gonna take care of this guy right now
[1:57:39] and they're coming they had they had
[1:57:40] they made sport the Bible said he made
[1:57:42] sport they had a banquet around this guy
[1:57:44] Samson being led by a little boy can't
[1:57:47] see anymore
[1:57:48] anybody can do whatever they want to do
[1:57:50] to him he can't do nothing
[1:57:52] but in that condition
[1:57:55] had one thing that he could do
[1:57:58] and if you're a young man a young woman
[1:58:00] find yourself in the same condition as
[1:58:02] Samson there is one thing that you can
[1:58:05] do
[1:58:06] and here's the thing the thing that you
[1:58:08] do proves that God never left you
[1:58:12] even in all your failures and all your
[1:58:15] mistakes he never left you Samson say
[1:58:18] Lord I know I did wrong I did this wrong
[1:58:21] and I did he began to repent before God
[1:58:23] he said God I did all this and I know I
[1:58:25] was born I was placed on this Earth to
[1:58:28] destroy Philistines and look at what
[1:58:30] they're doing to me
[1:58:31] God I don't deserve to live I failed you
[1:58:34] God
[1:58:35] but I got one prayer one one prayer once
[1:58:38] more Lord
[1:58:41] if you would allow the script to come
[1:58:43] back in God I I promise I'll die with
[1:58:46] these Philistines
[1:58:49] and there's Samson say say total that
[1:58:51] lead me to the pillars where where this
[1:58:53] building is is built on leave me to the
[1:58:55] building it went running there and say
[1:58:56] well look at look at them what is he
[1:58:57] doing over that them pillars what what
[1:58:59] exception everybody laughing at him but
[1:59:01] they didn't know why he was praying that
[1:59:02] prayer say that the brother man will say
[1:59:04] the shock her hair begin to grow back
[1:59:07] and as he leaned against the pillars his
[1:59:09] once more Lord he pushed them pillars
[1:59:11] and they wonder where did the strength
[1:59:13] come from it came from a prayer
[1:59:16] God showed up again right after prayer
[1:59:20] and God is quick about it
[1:59:23] Sam's are beginning to push them pillars
[1:59:25] the next thing on here come the building
[1:59:26] down and more Philistines died at
[1:59:30] Samson's death
[1:59:31] then died during his lifetime are you
[1:59:34] willing to die to relationships
[1:59:37] are you willing to die to friendships
[1:59:39] are you willing to Die the things that's
[1:59:41] hindering you from walking closer to God
[1:59:46] be willing to risk it all
[1:59:48] just like these disciples they thought
[1:59:50] that you know what we don't risk it all
[1:59:52] and what have we got look not only not
[1:59:54] only when you risk it all Jesus told say
[1:59:56] y'all don't even realize what y'all done
[1:59:59] you know when when judgment come y'all
[2:00:02] fellas are going to get the opportunity
[2:00:04] to judge Nations
[2:00:07] not only that they say anybody anybody
[2:00:10] ever that forsakes houses good God you
[2:00:14] forsake brethren you forsake sisters use
[2:00:17] forsake father you forsake mother you
[2:00:18] forsake wife you forsake you anybody's
[2:00:21] ever done anything like that gonna
[2:00:23] receive of me a hundredfold and you're
[2:00:26] gonna inherit
[2:00:28] eternal life
[2:00:29] you never lose
[2:00:32] when you place your trust
[2:00:34] in Jesus
[2:00:37] it's never a risk
[2:00:39] it's never a risk when we talking about
[2:00:41] Jesus
[2:00:43] I'ma tell you it's a sure
[2:00:45] Foundation
[2:00:49] took a risk when they put Moses out in
[2:00:52] the in the now
[2:00:53] but they were rewarded she was able to
[2:00:56] raise her own baby in the house of
[2:00:59] pharaoh and got paid for raising her own
[2:01:02] baby
[2:01:05] that step of Faith paid off
[2:01:13] if we were to read earlier in that
[2:01:14] chapter and I'm trying to bring this
[2:01:16] home in Matthew
[2:01:18] um
[2:01:19] 19 were reading it was a story the Rich
[2:01:21] Young Ruler
[2:01:23] that it come to the Lord Jesus
[2:01:26] and he was not willing to risk
[2:01:29] his riches
[2:01:31] Jesus say if you want to you know sell
[2:01:32] everything you got and come follow me he
[2:01:34] was not willing to risk it
[2:01:36] now here's the thing and when you
[2:01:38] brother Branham showed us this clearly
[2:01:40] when you look at his story in the Book
[2:01:41] of Luke you know after he turned Jesus
[2:01:43] down you know what he got richer
[2:01:45] he was building barns for his riches he
[2:01:48] didn't even have enough to put he didn't
[2:01:50] have enough room to put all this stuff
[2:01:52] he got richer after he rejected Jesus
[2:01:56] but here's the other thing that happened
[2:01:57] to him one day this same fella
[2:02:00] while he's sitting there counting all
[2:02:02] his money didn't realize that his soul
[2:02:04] would be required of him
[2:02:05] and he ended up the Bible say lifted his
[2:02:07] eyes in hell
[2:02:10] an unfortunate thing that while he was
[2:02:12] in hell
[2:02:14] he was he he saw he saw Abraham and he
[2:02:17] says you know Father Abraham could you
[2:02:19] send my uh my somebody to my brothers
[2:02:22] and tell him not to come to this place
[2:02:23] they say no no he got the prophets up
[2:02:24] there if they don't want to hear the
[2:02:26] prophets they ain't going to hear nobody
[2:02:27] from he said no no no they were they
[2:02:29] were listening to somebody that's raised
[2:02:31] from the dead no they won't
[2:02:33] and here's the problem that young man
[2:02:35] when he walked away from Jesus was
[2:02:37] walking away from a calling that was in
[2:02:39] his life
[2:02:40] he risked his calling
[2:02:42] he risked a lot of things he left a lot
[2:02:45] of that and he took that calling to hell
[2:02:51] how many young men are using that
[2:02:54] calling for the things of the world
[2:02:55] rather than for God
[2:02:58] don't take your call into hell
[2:03:01] that young man risked his calling Jesus
[2:03:05] knew why he told him come follow me look
[2:03:07] you're never losing following me he said
[2:03:09] I just can't give up all my daddy's
[2:03:11] riches and my mamas I can't do that he's
[2:03:14] and he turned and walked away
[2:03:16] he risked it all
[2:03:18] he lost his life
[2:03:22] brother Branham
[2:03:24] makes a statement and a message
[2:03:26] Investments and I just want to again
[2:03:28] bring it to close there's this when we
[2:03:31] talk about risk and reward we're
[2:03:33] speaking from an investment perspective
[2:03:36] and what it means it's the possible
[2:03:38] profit that a particular activity may
[2:03:40] make in relation to the risk involved in
[2:03:43] doing it and let me just kind of put it
[2:03:45] like this
[2:03:47] I was telling my daughter it's not many
[2:03:49] things when it comes in your lifetime it
[2:03:51] doesn't happen often that you get an
[2:03:53] opportunity to be a part of either
[2:03:55] purchasing a church or Building a Church
[2:03:58] and in my lifetime it's only happened
[2:04:00] this is the second time it's happened
[2:04:02] for me and the first time amen it
[2:04:04] happened we were building a church and
[2:04:06] and it was great risk on a lot of
[2:04:09] people's part in order to get that
[2:04:11] church bit but I can look back now every
[2:04:13] time I walk through them Church doors I
[2:04:15] can look back at us doing the bricks us
[2:04:17] doing the roof up doing all the work
[2:04:19] that we did on that property and every
[2:04:21] person that has come through them doors
[2:04:23] that has been blessed all the meetings
[2:04:25] that I've had in that building we were
[2:04:27] part of that
[2:04:30] can I tell you some some of y'all y'all
[2:04:32] you are sowing seeds for your loved ones
[2:04:35] some of your loved ones won't come here
[2:04:37] to this school
[2:04:38] but you watch and see what happens when
[2:04:40] you get over there
[2:04:43] you have to be willing to take the risks
[2:04:47] there's a risk and a reward
[2:04:50] hearing the message Investments brother
[2:04:51] Brandon makes this statement
[2:04:56] these get rich overnight
[2:04:59] doesn't
[2:05:01] um the these get rich overnight doesn't
[2:05:03] it's a good businessman want fool with
[2:05:05] it if you got anything you want to
[2:05:08] invest in get some identified business
[2:05:11] something that's been proven it keeps
[2:05:13] this promise it pays off
[2:05:16] and here's another thing don't keep your
[2:05:19] money
[2:05:24] don't keep your money
[2:05:27] in your pocket now here's the thing
[2:05:29] here's what God what I what I see God
[2:05:31] say in that statement God know you got
[2:05:33] it
[2:05:35] yeah right don't keep it in your pocket
[2:05:39] hello somebody
[2:05:41] don't keep your money in your pocket
[2:05:43] you'll never get anything
[2:05:45] somebody will steal from you
[2:05:49] after a while Yay see you don't want to
[2:05:52] do that Jesus taught the same thing when
[2:05:55] you got a talent don't hide it
[2:05:58] you got to put it to use and when you
[2:06:01] put it to use it grows see there that
[2:06:03] this when you make an investment you're
[2:06:05] getting interest it grows right your
[2:06:08] investment growth don't you got to put
[2:06:09] it to use growing now I may be talking
[2:06:12] the Presbyterian Methodist Baptist in
[2:06:14] these breakfasts and whatever more you
[2:06:16] never know who is setting it for you see
[2:06:18] so remember if you got some Investments
[2:06:22] something to invest in invested in
[2:06:24] something that's good something that's
[2:06:27] real something that's been proven
[2:06:30] that'll pay off some good reliable
[2:06:33] identified firm that has been proven to
[2:06:36] pay off and ain't nothing greater than
[2:06:38] the kingdom of God I'm telling that
[2:06:39] right now has been proven to pay off in
[2:06:42] the past it's got a name behind it you
[2:06:45] men know that even if you have to take
[2:06:48] it slower coming up your Dividends are
[2:06:51] smaller yet I'd rather know all my money
[2:06:54] I was drawing two percent and and sure
[2:06:57] to get it then drawing 50 and never get
[2:07:00] it promise fifty percent see you want to
[2:07:03] stay with the firm or the business
[2:07:05] that's got a background has got a name
[2:07:08] behind it something that's going to pay
[2:07:10] off and some something that's right I
[2:07:13] said now this young fellow that we're
[2:07:16] speaking about this young businessman
[2:07:17] the Rich Young Ruler says why he was
[2:07:20] given the opportunity to make an
[2:07:22] investment in one of the greatest
[2:07:24] businesses that he could invest that
[2:07:26] could invest in he was given the
[2:07:28] opportunity to follow Jesus Christ and
[2:07:32] what a ridiculous thing that he did what
[2:07:34] a rational thing this young fellow given
[2:07:38] this type of an opportunity to invest
[2:07:40] his soul and his money and whatever he
[2:07:43] had in the kingdom of God and he turned
[2:07:46] it down
[2:07:47] flatly we look at him this morning as
[2:07:50] this young businessman as a very poor
[2:07:53] businessman but you couldn't have told
[2:07:55] him that Jesus couldn't tell him any
[2:07:58] better this young man
[2:08:00] failed to take the right risk that risk
[2:08:04] would sell everything you got
[2:08:06] come follow me
[2:08:07] he says no I can't do it he walked away
[2:08:09] he got richer but his end result his
[2:08:13] great reward was that in hell he lifted
[2:08:16] up his eyes
[2:08:18] God we don't want to be like that the
[2:08:20] best investment that you'll ever make is
[2:08:22] giving your heart to Jesus
[2:08:26] and yeah you're going to risk some
[2:08:27] things you're going to risk some
[2:08:28] friendships
[2:08:29] you're going to risk some relationships
[2:08:31] you're going to risk you know a lot of
[2:08:34] things out there in the world at your
[2:08:35] risk but there's a great reward that
[2:08:36] great reward is eternal life
[2:08:41] greater than anything else that you can
[2:08:43] do is give your heart to Jesus sell out
[2:08:45] with everything you got God I'm gonna
[2:08:47] follow you
[2:08:48] I'm gonna serve you
[2:08:50] I did it a long time ago
[2:08:53] and I'm telling right now it has paid
[2:08:55] off for me I have never regretted the
[2:08:58] day that I start serving the lord
[2:09:01] I've never regretted it
[2:09:03] and I think we got many people here
[2:09:04] today that feel the same never regret it
[2:09:06] when they gave God the entire heart
[2:09:09] everything
[2:09:10] not just part of me but all of me
[2:09:14] risk
[2:09:16] rewards God bless you
[2:09:20] foreign
[2:09:25] let's have a word of prayer now turn the
[2:09:28] service back over to brother Troy
[2:09:31] father

[2:10:03] been in the
[2:10:04] the the the the
[2:10:05] lap of Delilah
[2:10:09] but God I pray uh today that they would
[2:10:11] hear the voice calling to them they can
