gwenna a man from London praise the Lord appreciate them man they they were passing through for the meetings and a man and brother Guinta told us because it's you know it's kind of a running thing that happens here told brother gwenlyn said you know oftentimes when I get invited to to go to London and you know if I tell my family say we'd be there was an invitation come to go to London to preach the gospel and if I tell the family were let's pray about it typically what the family said well you pray and we'll pack they've already put it in their head that they go in you know that London that's just one of the favorite cities they men to go to so now things have been reversed so when brother whispers invited to come to West Palm Beach sister go in and was saying you pray and our pack and she got a reason to come a man we thank God to have a part of them here in spirit and truth Tabernacle the sister Ruth a man we certainly certainly thank God for them so I trust that this

and I need something that all poses whispering otherwise I'll start whispering so if you can just give me a bit of some power in especially in just the monitors I like to hear myself other preachers don't like to hear themselves but if I don't I'll strain my voice and once we find our level if we can just try and keep it at that same level amen god bless you so good to be here together with you a man won't appreciate brother Jack for the invitation I was actually meant to have gone back to to UK this last week but when you know brother Jack contacted me and say to me that he would want me to a minister I thought well I can't get away with this one this time so I had to change my travel plans and waited for this week so I could come here this Sunday a man I've been in West Palm Beach for quite a few times but it's actually my first time to come in Minister here we've been here before not on aged service day but just coming around to see the place but this is the first time that I'm actually ministering in in this place and appreciate the Lord for that a my brother Jack and the family have been with us for quite a few times in London so I thought that I or the church this one a man but as he said you know because of other reasons I mean this this is the beginning of many other man so it's it's warm Church to me man so if I preach like I'm at home just bear with me because I'm at home if I take my time like I'm at home just bear with me because I'm at home I don't quite believe you know in in short sermons I would do my best but I have a real struggle you know that is ahead of me here I'm trying to just bring something that we've been sharing one back home and I'm trying to consolidate three services into one and it's not the easiest of tasks so I better stop talking and get straight to the word so I can save my time shall we stand for the reading of the word a man but you know I was thinking as well that I had a wait for a week for this day so let me take my time yeah brother branham you'd say no I just preached a lot the short service for four hours I promise I'm not gonna be that long Romans chapter 9 if I just gonna be sure that this thing is working okay good praise the Lord amen that's good amen Romans chapter 9 a bit of length the scripture reading so just try and run through this and not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one even by our Father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the elder shall serve the young as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated for he saith to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I'll have compassion on whom I have compassion so then it is not of him that willeth know of him that runneth but of God that show what missing they would say then unto me why does he find fault for who had resisted his will nay but all men who art thou that repliest against God I like this no arguments with God shall the thing formed say to him that formed it why his doll for wires thou made me thus watch boys talking about affirmation have not the porter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour and another unto dishonour what if God willing to show his rod to make his power known endured with much long-suffering the vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction and that he might make known the riches of his glory in the vessels of Mercy which he had afore prepared unto glory and then in the book of revelations chapter 5 and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on that throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven no in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David had prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth and he came and he took the book out of the right hand of him that set upon the throne shall we bow our heads father we thank you for the reading of the word Lord we've come to that part that sacred part father that part that no man can do it takes you and you alone Lord we are worthy we unable we are feeble but furthered our strong thou are able law therefore we commit the service into your lovely precious hands and we ask you Father that you can take over all things from henceforth Lord I confess my inability but lord father we know we can do all things through Christ that strengthens us but I pray that you can take over from here forth may we together sit in them heavenly places in Christ Jesus will be careful in order to give you the honor and the glory and the praise for you this effort Lord our hallelujah Lord father belongs to You Father begin the spot with us in Jesus Christ's name Amen and amen praise the Lord we may be seated praise the Lord amen if I would take a title I want to speak on vessels of mercy and of special may see a man vessels of Mercy and of special may see there's a teacher in me that likes to teach so I always like to come from an angle where I give you know something more into the word how many love the word how many love the word how many love the word praise the Lord so can we get into the word man just bear with me as we you know just scroll through the scriptures and the quotations now we start from Romans chapter 9 Paul here he's bringing something that stumbles many people and he is bringing the concept of election yeah Paul says yeah that the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand now this stumbles a lot of people and they think to themselves you know when they've not yet done any good or evil they've not even been born but God is saying I hate another and I love another what type of a God is this and it stumbles many people to say but how can God work in this fashion but the Prophet comes along and he explains it to us and he says predestination is a hard word among a congregation of people because predestination really foreknowledge is a better word and predestination looks back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks to destiny and God being infinite in the beginning knew the end from the beginning therefore he knew what what people would do so he could foretell what would take place for he knew what would be so the Prophet says let's let's lighten this a little bit let's not make it too hard predestination is a bit of a strong word let's just dilute it man so that people can get to understand the way God looks at things so remember this is a diluted version a man trying to ease it for those people that can easily stumble so he says that predestination is a hard word but let's look at it from a perspective of full knowledge he goes on and it says before is or Jacob Amen hey the one was born God could say is so I have hated and Jacob I have loved because he foreknew what they could be so the reason why God could say this is because he knew I had of time he knew I had of their coming on earth what they would be praising the Lord he never met east so the way he was he wasn't willing that Esau would be that way but Esau by choice God knew who take that way so that's how he knows us today he knows your hearts you might be able to fool your neighbor you might be able to fool your pasta but you never be able to fool God because he knows your heart and how important this is to Christians but you must know that God knows your heart you might fool your posture you might fool the Deacons but you can never fool God so be honest with God hallelujah stay an honest believer this message is for the honest in hearts hallelujah so God knows us in and out and because he knows us like that he because of that for knowledge could predestinate so predestination is speaks of the omniscience of God amen God that knows all things and on the basis that he knows all things he could speak like Paul says in Romans 9 that the purpose of God according to election might stand Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated because of his full knowledge are you with me and the Prophet says predestination looks back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks onto destiny right predestination looks back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks onto destiny and what he is talking about here is what Paul says in Romans 8 remember we read means nine so the profit takes us back to Romans 8 and Romans 8 says for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate so predestination is out of foreknowledge are you with me and that's what Paul says in Romans chapter 8 to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he justified and whom he justified them he also glorified so what is the plan here there is a four knowledge and the four knowledge leads to a calling why because there is a predestinated seed hallelujah when he calls he justifies but when he justifies he doesn't stop there he's gonna finish what he started he's gonna go refine so he's not doing a pot job he's doing a full-time job I'm so glad that my god will finish where it starts my salvation is not even in my hands your salvation is not even in your hands when God starts with you we will finish that which he starts a man praise be to God so draws that he did foreknow are the ones that he predestinated so predestination is looking back to for knowledge but foreknowledge is looking to destiny now you with me so predestination hallelujah it looks back to for knowledge but that foreknowledge it is looking to destiny are you with me but I want you to watch these are vessels at creation the right at creation hallelujah God is predestinated at that point but the predestination so this is not about when you are born this is not about when you have done something wrong this is not about a little way in your life this is right at creation before where the children were even born God being an omniscient God before knows all things and because of the foreknowledge he looks to destiny you came from God you are going back to God you at creation he can predestinate [Music] hallelujah and God is not the one that is making people to then make these choices he is only saying I know what choice they are going to make and on that basis I predestinate but let me go a step further and say that God does this in order to give every person an eco opportunity I mean that's why he said even to Cain yeah why on the road and why is thy countenance fallen if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted so everyone is given an equal opportunity to choose right or to choose wrong if you choose right you'll be accepted even if you are King but yet God knows that there is nothing in Cain that is able to make that decision but he gives them an equal opportunity and the same thing we find in Judas the Bible say that he quotes the twelve yeah and one of them he says is a devil but here an opportunity the same opportunity that Peter had the same opportunity that John James had is the same opportunity that Judas had if I not chosen twelve and one of you is a devil but I have chosen all of you and inspect of Judas Iscariot he knew exactly he suffered long with this man but though he knew that this man even if I give him an equal opportunity you will still choose but it on that basis God predestinate are you with me so this is what Paul is talking about when he starts in Romans chapter 9 he's pointing back to go to Romans chapter 8 which is the predestination by foreknowledge but then Paul does not stop there Paul goes a little deeper are you with me and in verse 19 he says that would say then why God he had find for four who had resisted his will then Paul says neighbor o man who art thou that repliest against God shall the thing formed say to him that formed it why hast thou made me thus if not the portal power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour and another unto dishonour so here Paul says now he introduces a concept of formation shall the thing formed are you with me so we find that there is a step when God comes to formation and information we are seeing that there are two types of vessels that are to be formed verse 22 and if God willing to show his rod and to make his power known endured with much long-suffering the vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy are you with me so we find now that when it comes to a stage of formation there are other vessels that are to be introduced in this vessels are vessels of Wrath and then there are vessels of Nancy but this is not happening at creation this is happening information and information vessels are made different are you with me so poor at this stage is not just looking at the the result of the phone knowledge but poor is also looking at the purpose of the formation so there is a purpose here and the purpose is at the origin when the vessel is formed one is made a vessel of Honor and another is made a vessel of dishonor one is made a vessel of loss and another is made a vessel of mercy and the difference is coming a man at this formation stage are you with me but when is this formation stage I love the depth of the word of God the man because when God created man it was in Genesis 1 and Genesis 1 is not a formation Genesis 1:27 is a creation so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them the Genesis 1:27 man is a created man this is not a formed man are you following me so far and this created man was created in the image of God in the likeness of God therefore the origin of this man is God is DNA of God his blood is the blood of God everything about him is about God because he's made in the image of God in the likeness of God he's all God and nothing else and when he created them male and female created he them and he called their name Adam hallelujah this is at creation have you ever wondered he never gave them a sermon he called their name Adam not Adam so in song have you ever wondered why a man if you read the genealogies in the Bible God never gives these children's names you hear this who was the son of so-and-so who was the son of so-and-so who was the son of millenia who was the son of cainan who was the son of eNOS who was the son of Seth who was the son of Adam who was the son of God no senem what was their senem Oh God their same hymn was where they came from it was speaking about an origin so their same name was God [Music] and that's why the bible says call no man father for you everyone that is in heaven he's our Father so our tree senem is God I came from God I'm going back to God I can't wait for a day when I will not be caught Greiner oh praise be to God but I'll be called God but the hour is here what you shall be caught by a true senem are you with me Adam came from God his origin was gone therefore his destiny was already sealed and it was God let me say there was no amount of sinning that could change his destiny with me could ever change the destiny of Adam because the destiny of Adam is not on the basis of what he shall do but the destiny of ayodhya is on the basis of where he came from why because God can never denies on DNA he can never deny his own blood so draw Adam sinned but when Adam sinned God to rush down Adam Adam Adam Adam why are you hiding have you done something wrong yes the woman that you gave me but God says Oh quick like come on dress in this slim scheme and what was the mystery behind that lambskin it was the shedding of blood why an atom that had seen but God could not allow him any manner [Music] because he was he was he came from God and immediately he said I'm sorry until David wondered and he says what is man that thou art mindful of him and the son of man that thou visitest see him for thou has made him a little lower than angels and is crowned him with glory and honor that made him to have dominion over the works of the head what is man the lower than angels but you suffered him not to be lost forever you came for his Redemption because he came from God he's going back to God that's at creation are you with me only one type of a vessel mad it's called a vessel of mercy no matter what happens to that vessel there is redemption for it but now Paul says shall the thing formed he's not talking of creation he's talking of formation and the question then is when was men formed and thus Genesis 2:7 and the Lord God formed man out of the dust of the ground so Genesis 1:27 was the creation but Genesis 2:7 was a formation now you with me and it is this formation stage all glory to God that God now introduces two different types of vessels one is a vessel unto honor and another is a vessel unto dishonour it is at formation stage are you with me now you with me so Genesis 1:27 hallelujah at creation there is only one type of with less so that is formed is a vessel of mercy but when it comes to Genesis 2:7 then now we are at formation stage and we are introduced in another vessel which is a vessel of Wrath but can the porter or can the thing formed say to the porter why have you made me thus so there is one water but that porter is molding vessels of mercy and vessels of Wrath and is making them to purpose but though he is the porter but he doesn't use his own instrumentality to make the vessels of Wrath he uses the instrumentality of the serpent but who is the porter the porter is God but the instrumentality is the instrumentality of the serpent and that is why if could say I have got an immense from the Lord and when brother Branham explains it he says where does life come from life only comes from one source that is from God and that's why she could say I've gotten a man from the Lord but though the instrumentality was the instrumentality of the serpent in this formation stage vessels are made to propose their vessels of mercy and the vessels of Wrath now because vessels are made two different types we can understand the Bible we can now understand Genesis six why we end up with two lineages of people and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them that the sons of God saw that the daughters of men now we have two races the sons of God and the daughters of men where are they coming from they are coming at formation stage we now have to linear this now we can understand that how that Judas was formed as a son of perdition because it's a vessel of rod and why does God need vessels of water they are formed for a purpose he needs a dirty man for a dirty job [Music] Oh glory glory I'm reminded of the Bible that there was a time in heaven when they God wanted somebody to go and deceive ah and God looked everywhere in heaven and he says you can go and deceive ah ha ha and there was no found any one angel came about and he says oh I'm going to this God says you're too righteous sit down another angel comes along he says I'll do this is your two lashes sit down until they come in spirit from the piece away and the spirit came before God and he says go and deceive and he says how are you gonna do it he says I'll become if lying spirit and God says go you can succeed you I a vessel of rods you are created for this purpose you can go but could not do it are you with me so God when he now creates he creates only vessels of Mercy but when it comes to formation he allows other vessels to come in are you following me but in all this the Bible tells us nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his and God's focus is always on those that are his these are DNA of his DNA these are blood of his blood these came from God and they are going back to God these are vessels of mercy when something goes wrong in their life God steps in these are vessels of medicine when something goes wrong in their life God's Pepsi like when something went wrong in the life of our Dharma God stepped in are you following me the destiny is already sealed and it is sealed because of the origin where they came from it defines where they are going God cannot allow nothing to interfere with that not even God can even stop death hallelujah until a vessel of Messi's redeemed or somebody says what do you know what you are talking about yes I know what I'm talking about the thief on the cross the main was a robber the man was dying as a robot the man had never seen his tape of the door of the church he was nothing but a few tamanna and he was dying but God predestinated that man because he came from God and God knew that I'm gonna be on the cross together with that man and he shall say the right words and when he says the right word he will change his destiny [Music] was that judge him and said he's gonna have capital punishment he's going to be crucified they'd said we killed a sinner but a mystery unfolded on the cross in a private conversation remember this was not being held by all the others this was a conversation that was between the three of them that we on the cross many that shall die and you think but on the deathbed law changes their destiny until the Prophet says there shall be many surprises in heaven because it's a disgrace to the Shepherd if a sheep does not come home it's not a disgrace to the ship is a disgrace to the Shepherd it's the responsibility of the Shepherd Oh glory of God we need to is to apply the token when we apply the token it's God's responsibility to bring them back in can you say Amen children can go the way they go but when you apply the token is God's responsible error to bring them back in and he will bring them back in Oh glory God can even stop deaths in order to redeem a predestinate succeed even when Satan confuses them you know in this world of confusion where people are being confused because of this teaching and because of that teaching if it's a vessel of mercy it will always be a vessel of mercy God will do something I don't care what the devil tries to do but God will do something because it's his own people it is his own DNA it is his own blood he will do something about it are you with me Church or glory to God what is it that God can do he can use other means even if the gospel fails can you say what do you mean preacher man I'll tell you what I mean that when the gospel seems to have failed God still has other means are you with me the prophecies a glass of water [Applause] and I believe God says for the sake of that glass of water you shall kameena is a vessel or message that God hallelujah cannot let go praise God in the highest are you following me God can use other means what other means love the Prophet was told all that you ever laughed I have given them to you and all that ever loved you I have given them to you so if you ever loved the Prophet he God has already given you change are you with me God can use other means praise the Lord in the why because these are vessels of Mercy praise be to God I love this hey man can I proceed [Music] Janina the Bible says here and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mass God has an agenda and the agenda is that he might hallelujah make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy so information that might look the same they might talk the same they might walk the same until people say you are the same but behind what appears there is an origin there is a predestination and there is a vessel of Mercy or a vessel of Wrath they walk the same they look the same they are living in the same world you might actually be working in the same place with somebody but when God looks at the two vessels God says this one is a vessel of messy but this one is a vessel of broth and they walk like they are the same but in a certain point God is gonna show that there is a difference because God knows who are he and at the appointed time God is gonna show the difference just like it was in Exodus chapter 11 and they shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt such as there was none like it now it shall be like it anymore but against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog movies tongue against men or beasts that he may know how the Lord put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel now the children of Israel had lived in Egypt for some time they've been treated as slaves in Egypt for some time it looked like there were no bodies but God knew that these are vessels of mercy and because there were vessels of medicine God had an appointed time when he said first time I shall begin to show that I don't put a difference between an Egyptian and in Israel let me say there is an hour where God will show that he puts a difference between a vessel of Mercy and a vessel of Wrath and I look like you are the same it might look like your destinies are the same but there is a time that comes up that God says I will show that this is a vessel of mercy yes things might go wrong for a little while but there is an hour when God will say I'm changing things I'm beginning to show that this is a vessel of mercy yes you might have suffered for a little while but there is coming an hour where God will begin to show that you are a vessel Masey God is a label on it and it says endow with care it is fragile do you know when you transport vessels a man they will put a label on it if it is a glass vessel they will say fragile didn't know it care don't just throw around and know it care God has good on his own children vessels of mercy this one is fragile because God put limits on what the devil can do in your life God puts limits on how far the devil can take you in your life yes you might allow you to suffer for a little while but there is a limit that God has placed but when that limit is reached God says enough is enough I'll not allow my daughter to remain in that situation because she is a vessel of Mercy I'm coming to redeem her my son to remain in that situation he is a vessel of message may I speak to somebody this afternoon to say yes you might have waited out but the limit is about getting rich [Applause] your life [Applause] for me to speak I believe in spiritual food that comes in is to season I believe in a God that knows our desire I believe in a God that announces his next program from the poopies when I come to church I'm coming to hear an update of my situation from glory and when the preacher say something that's what heaven is saying to me that's the way you must take Church your season is arrived your seasonal freedom always be like this [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] you are somebody [Applause] we are nullify all the ordinances we are nullify all the plots of the wicked devil and we are saying mercy let me rewrite your life [Music] why because we are a vessel of mercy yes sir with a vessel of mercy there is an hour of remembrance it might look like you have forgotten it might look like you are neglected but if you are a vessel of mercy there is an hour of remembrance Motech I was neglected mother Kali was forgotten but they come a day when the King sada bring the book of the chronicles what has been done unto this man and I believe this morning God is saying bring the book of the chronicles God is saying bring the book of the chronicles what has been done unto the sister she's been faithful she's been holding on receive your blessing receive your blessing in the name of Jesus receive your blessing in the name of Jesus receive your blessing in the name of Jesus [Applause] [Music] [Applause] praise God praise God praise God praise God vessels of Missi you are alright yes sir [Applause] [Music] [Applause] is the Lamb of God can we take it further let's take it further a man let's take it further praise the Lord as I come to vessels or special messy as if it's not enough to be a vessel of messy God also makes you a vessel of specialness when God created to create the vessels of Mercy but when God formed deformed vessels of Wrath and vessels of Mercy but at the same time I take it further and say that predestination he also then predestinate a people to an age a man because the prophecies here uija parts the son of God an attribute of God you know the very age you were coming he predestinated you to that age to take that place and no one else can take it oh that makes me shout God predestinated you to this age take that place and no one can take your place and no one can take you away from your place you are going nowhere god predestinated you to this edge to take that place and no one can take it [Music] praise be to God he goes on in these days now watch the wisdom of God knowing that would be unbelievers and how the majority will be unbelievers he by foreknowledge predestinated a seed for every age that would believe it now if you notice that for each age right on with this word everything right on time nothing hinders God so God predestinated the seed for every age and God has allotted a word for that age and nothing whoever in the God amen so in predestination God allocates a people to an age he allocates a word to that age and he says in John chapter 10 my ship who hear my voice and in every age there are vessels of Mercy are you with me and when when when when when they come in their age mercy has to find them no matter where they are no matter how low they are sunk no matter how deep in sin they are but God knows he's on nevertheless the foundation of God's ten sure the Lord knoweth them that are his the devil might've hoodwink them and put them somewhere but the Aged message who fished them out and nothing hinders God not even their own unbelief [Applause] not even their own desire I think of the time when brother Billy Paul left the message and he started backsliding and he went into all sortsa his father called him and he said Billy Paul , he said but your head against the wall stretch your hand out and he says you I had a crossroad in your life and he says you are standing right here in the middle this side list to the right Road but this side leads to the wrong road and when you take this wrong side you shall have to pay for it but he says but before you get to the end here God is gonna turn you back why because I applied the talkin [Applause] hallelujah he say go the way you want but before you get to the end here God is gonna turn you back because I apply the toggle when you have applied the tokens you can rest God will restore God will restore in his season he will just like he did with brother Billy Paul he's still the same God God so Massey has to go and pick them up amen and God is a program in each age that caters for those vessels of mercy and that brings me to vessels of special mercy we have read in the book of Revelation chapter 5 and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and as I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals there are and no man in heaven or in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open the book and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders a man and one of the elders saith unto me we'd not behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David had prevailed to open the book and to loose the seals and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth and he came and he took the book out of the right hand of him that set upon the throne now according to the program of God the hour has arrived a great event is gonna take place the program of God cannot be hindered it is unstoppable the seals must now be opened the hour has arrived there is a proclamation that goes in heaven who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals and there was no man that was found worthy and the Bible says that John began to weep but when John was weeping then the elder came along and he said we've not John because the of the tribe of Judah has prevailed hallelujah so John is looking around he's now wandering but where is this lion of the tribe of Judah he's the one that has prevailed here and John is waiting to see a lion that has prevailed to open the book but what happens John does not see a lion a mystery unfolds in the midst of the throne let me read the quotation fest and the chemin of the elder standing in the midst of the four beasts and all the great hosts of heaven say don't weep John oh my don't be brokenhearted John don't weep for the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root and offspring of David he has prevailed and when he looked around to see where the lion was he saw a lamb strange look for a lion and see I like that look for a lion and you see but I want you to watch ways this lamb coming from a few moments ago John is looking and he sees no laugh are you with me hallelujah the prophet of God says here John hadn't noticed the lamb before you know hear it hadn't been mentioned before no way had it been mentioned John didn't seat all over the heavens as he was looking but hear it come forth so John when he was taken up in Revelation chapter 4 he was shown everything in heaven then he says I saw one sit on the throne and then the Bible talks about the four living creatures the Bible talks about the twenty-four elders the Bible talks about the see like crystal glass the Bible described everything around the throne and there was no lamp but the Bible says from the midst of the throne the very same place where God was sitting from the midst of the throne rose the lamp what happened on that day God in Martha he changed his form those way he changed his form to become a lamb he just changed his form again and he's showed what he had done and he became the bleeding Lamb of God and he went and he took the book a man from him that was sitting on the throne but was the the prophet of God says remember he had been on his mediatorial work back here so he had a mission behind the scenes and down through the ages he has been on that mission so he rises from that mission Oh glory the prophecies wait till we get over here but one hour take that half one half also retake that half hour that is silent the sanctuary is smoking there's no more intercession the sacrifice is left it's a judgement seat there's no blood on it normal for the blood covered lamp is walked away so the throne is changing and when is the throne changing it is at the hour of the breaking of the seals the lamb is ready to change laws from being a lot from being a lamp to becoming a liar and the prophecies remember in the Old Testament as long as the blood was off the message it was judgment but as as the blood was on that there was mercy [Music] but when the lamp walked away that did it but the elder was right he was a lion see the outer called him said lion because he had been a lab on the intercessor a bloody lamb but now he's coming forth as a lion his days of intercession is over [Music] mercy is over he says so here come the lamb his intercessory days is over the Mediterranean a stats when the angels coming to stand you wait till we get in the seals and time shall be no more that half hour of silence watch what takes place in that half hour silent on that Seventh Seal so when it comes to the time of the seventh seal the throne is changing am i reading the prophet when we get to the seals hallelujah to the seventh seal the lamb walks away and when the lamb walks away mercy enhance and indeed when you follow the breach message it gives the impression that when the seals are opened Missy is normal and if you get that impression you are not alone because even when the Prophet preached the message even those that were listening to him they came to the conclusion that when the seals are opened Missy shall be normal until they came in the ask brother Branham a question brother Branham will you interpret after he says who the dispensation of grace be over after you open the seven seals why because of the way that he had put things the breach message until they ask questions and answers on the seals will the dispensation of grace be over after you open the seals and the Prophet gives an answer praise God I hope not no no friends don't get that in your mind you just go right on dig the potatoes and God would search and right on if it takes place in the morning you'll be found doing just exactly what you're supposed to be doing don't see when you do that you twist the very thing away from the purpose that it is intended for you get a little peculiar salt and when you get your own ideas about it don't take your own idea just when you sit and listen to things like that say thank you lord I'm just going to walk a little closer to you see I'm going to don't quit work and say and sell out everything keep on digging your potatoes keep on planting your potatoes keep going to university don't stop keep doing what you need to do he's coming tomorrow if you need to buy a brand new car buy a brand new car he's coming tomorrow [Applause] [Music] brother branham some say Messi is over and no one can be saved now is this true I'm glad I got this one this is brother bran we watch and pray we watch and pray in prayer line and it seems some are still finding Messi now that's the first question is God - is messy over don't never think that just keep right on doing everything you can until you are taken away if I know Jesus was coming this afternoon I'll be doing just the thing I'm doing right now just continuing right now mercy is always open oh let's spend God oh that's not enough praise but you just think that mercy is always open when the world is discounted you when even the church world had discounted you and they save you you are gone thank you Lord for mercy see open thank you Lord for mercy still open so don't count yourself out count yourself in by the mercies of God by the blood of Jesus Christ mercy is still open worry and what did he do now he's been back here interceding until his blood has atoned for every person and the lamb now knows was written in the book amen he's been back here interceding until his blood is atoned for every person and the lamb knows what's written in the book so he won't finish until the last one comes in so he not from the foundation of the world need their names were in there so he has stood back here and done me and done mid-year to work like until May mediatorial word to everyone that's been put in the book has been redeemed and it's finished and now he walks out so he does not walk out until the last one is in so God has got the names of those that are in the Lamb's Book of Life and because he's looking at the names of them that I in the book of life he's taking she's in she's not yet Ian hold fire she's not yet in hold the Ross Oh glory stay on the Mediterra I'll stay here until the last one comes in Oh glory to God until the last one comes that's when he we walk out so Massey could not have ended this is 1963 when the Prophet was now preaching the seals he is now saying wait until we get to that half hour silent the lamp walks away what I'm saying praise God because of these answers Mel C still open he couldn't have walked away 1963 because I was not yet manifested you are not yet so messy could not go until you were in all praise be to God God had to wait and hold everything waiting for you oh that's a point praising for you hold everything waiting for me why because I'm a vessel of mercy I'm a rapture candidate things could not go ahead until we had come in but watch why were the people saying what they were saying because of the statements the Prophet had made in the breach message and the Prophet says and now where I think you get it is about the finishing of the seven church edges and the seven seals being used the seven seals is manifested what takes place what has to place the seventh church age we are at the end of the seven th church age when I say the end that doesn't mean it's this very hour this very minute so the profit is now starting to explain he goes on and he says you remember the Bible said making the times of the Lord Jesus Paul said for this time is at hand do you realize how long how long that was in God's time that was yesterday my time is been 2,000 years the time is at the end what God calls at hand is not what we call attend just keep on believing keep praying keep on God still god man see open just keep flowing into it as fast as you can or tell your neighbor flow into that messy as fast as you can don't put some breaks flow into it don't hold yourself flow into it don't wait flow into it as fast as you can God will do the stopping when it's time to stop praise be to God but he says now I think where you get it is when when I was talking about the finishing of the seven churches and the seven seals being loosed but then he dropped something here he says when I say the end that doesn't mean it's this very hour this very minute so the profit is starting to clarify something here amen but yet we know that according to what he has already said in the bridge message he said his intercessory days is over the military all days that's when the angels going to stand you wait till we get in the seals so in the time of the seals he has to walk off from the Mediterra days are you with me and that half hour silence watch what takes place in that half hour silent on that seven ceil right so see you something must happen Oh God the lamb is going to leave the intercessory wrong he's still going to change from a lamb to a lion and when does he go when does he do that in the seventh seal you wait till we get in the seals that's half our silence but yet you said when I say the end it does not mean this very hour this very minute how does this work preacher he says here we must remember that this seventh seal is the end of time of all things so the seventh seal is the end of all time of all things he says revelations 10th chapter and one two seven first time runs out the angel say time will be normal at the end of this seventh seal so when does time run out when does time run out at the end of this seventh seal so if the seventh seal has an end it means the seventh seal is a beginning now follow me now when does time run out time runs out at the end of the seventh seal if the seventh view has an end the seventh seal must have a beginning because you can't end something that never began are you with me can I get into it a little bit so we have heard a dispensation of mercy the lamb was doing his mediatorial work and there was blood on the mercy seat and that's been down through the seven th ages but this has also been a period where the sued book where the book was sealed but this coming an hour which is the time of the Seventh Seal and in the time of the Seventh Seal mercy runs out he changes to become a lion and that's what he says in the breach message are you following me so far are you following me so far so that happens when it comes now to the seventh seal time glory regard but I want you to watch something that happens we now also understand a man that in the seventh seal time it is divided the beginning of the seventh seal and the end of the seven see are you with me and time runs out we're at the end of the seventh seal not at the beginning of the seventh seal it runs out at the end of the seventh seal now what is this seventh seal that we might be able to break what is happening here glory to God in the highest the prophet of God says hallelujah Macey is still open so there is a time when Macey runs out but there is a time which is at the beginning of the seventh year mercy is still open but yet we are in the seventh seal somebody say what are you talking about preacher man what is this seven till the prophecy I heard the revelation that revealed is in a three-fold manner so the Seventh Seal is not a single event the seventh seal is in a three-fold manner and that's where many people get confused you hear all the seven theory has been revealed the seven seal has not been revealed what is the truth of it I had a revelation that revealed so the seventh seal is revealed because I had a revelation that revealed but what was the revelation that is in a three-fold mana now what is this threefold manner Paul gives us this threefold manner and he gives the threefold manner in Festus alone in chapter four for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds are you following me so far the Lord himself shall descend with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the Prophet says Jesus does all three of them as he is descending he does all three of them as he is descending and this is in the appearing of the Lord it is not yet the coming of the Lord Jesus is the one that is descending but as he is descending us he descends with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God what is the shout the shout is the message hallelujah it is the message that calls the bride what is the voice of the Archangel the voice of the Archangel it is that very same voice that goes to call a resurrection it is the same voice that went to the grave of Lazarus ah that when Lazarus was dead he so was somewhere he was gone for four days in no man had ever been known to resurrect after such a time when corruption it's eighteen God had to wait hallelujah until corruption subpoena when he arrived at the grave of Lazarus and then he screamed with a loud voice Lazarus come forth and a man that was dead he sprang back to life that was the voice of the Archangel it is the same voice that we find in Matthew chapter 27 but when he was dying on the cross he cried with a loud voice and the graves were opened and the Saints of all was seen walking on the streets it's the voice of the Archangel so the voice of the Archangel it is what will bring the resurrection of the Dead Saints those that sleep in the Lord and the Trump of God it is what gathers the bride for the marriage fists it is what caused the living Saints with the resurrected Saints and together we shall meet him in the air and we go to be with the Lord for the marriage supper that is the Trump of God are you with me but mercy is still open in this entire period when he is descending let me correct it not in this entire period in the time of the seventh seal but we want to break it down and find way messy ends and we're messy is still open let me get back to my diagram so messy is still open but this period of the seventh seal is divided into the beginning of the seven seal in the end of the seventh seal are you with me so far oh I love this message with all my heart but we also understand that the seventh seal it is the coming of the Lord which is fastest along in scepter 4:16 are you with me it is the coming of the Lord but that coming of the Lord it is divided hallelujah into a shout and it is then divided into the voice of the Archangel but the first thing that we find is that there is a shout and I'm saying the shout is in the period when the mess is still open and this period is divided and at this division here that is where now the voice of the Archangel will sound it is right at this point and we know at this point this point here is 40 days before the rapture is the voice of the Archangel it will bring a resurrection of all the sleeping Saints and then those that are dead we will see them walking in the streets but at that time let him that is filled to be filthy still nobody will be saved then so you can't wait to see the Saints of old for you to say the hour has arrived because at that time Macie has ended and then the last part is the Trump of God and when does the Trump of God happen it is now the coming of the Lord Himself when we meet him in the air Jesus does all three as he is descending are you with me so the dispensation of the shout it is the discipline of where mercy is the open hallelujah it is happening in that shout why because there is a vessels of Mercy that must be called at that time and these are the ones that I'm saying these are candidates of special Messi God has predestinated them for this age are you with me God has predestinated them for this age who can give me 5 minutes 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 praise God [Applause] [Music] special vessels of mercy and the prophet of God amen in this he says when them seals a throat open they see their name and they and the Holy Spirit speaks to that they come who is coming vessels of special mercy yes they've been vessels of mercy but there are no vessels of specialness and they are coming with the call hallelujah of the voice of the seventh seal opening and when the seals are opened they see their names these are the Eagles of God when the Eagle cries out when they recognize are not a chicken I had been in a chicken coop but this is not my destiny I came from God and going back to God and Boone for a certain power unborn for a certain season and he holds them in this age oh and when they hear their voices when they hear the sounding of the seals it is the voice of their call and when they hear that voice they come in nothing can stop them you're coming to the message was unstoppable though the devil might have fought it but it was unstoppable you did not come here by accident God called you here and because you came here by the design of God you shall make it I said you shall make it I said you shall make it in fact we have already made the grace of God will see you through praise be to God you are born for such an hour such as this is also special mess but why am i calling them vessels of special mercy because there is a message but God is always allocated messages for a specific age but why are this special because there's something special that happens in their time are you with me we have understood from the Prophet that when the seals are opened the lamb Rises amen to become a lion right and when does it take place he says at the seventh seal are you with me but yet we also understand from Revelation chapter 5 the Lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed and yet when John looks he sees but the announcement has already been made who he has prevailed is the Lion of the tribe of Judah but when John looks he sees a lamb so putting these two verses together he is therefore a lion and a lamb at the same time because he says the lion has prevailed but when John looks he sees a lamb so he is therefore a lion and a lamb at the same time never before has he been like this he has been a land all along and the profit in the breech message he says he has done the Kinsmen work of redemption but he had not as yet claimed for his claim he had not as yet code for his claim now he comes on the scene to claim his right watch what takes place all my for which is a slave for which he was late for his becoming a kinsman redeemer two men to die in his place to redeem him but the elder was right when he said a lion see the elder called him a liar because he had been a lamb and intercessor a bloody land but now he's coming forth as a lion and the elder is right hallelujah but now we understand that yet Messi still open so he becomes both at the same time his boss hallelujah a lion and the lamb at the same time and never before has he been bought at the same time he has been a lamb here but in this period he becomes a why does he become a lion at the same time why because they are still vessels of Mercy the shout is calling vessels of massive but at this time he also has to claim his Redemption claims now when you come to claim something you don't come with you military of a lamb because the lamb is humble lamb lamb sacrifices a lamb you can do anything you want but if you want to claim you gotta become alive or glory of God he's coming for his Redemption rise and when he comes for the redemption rise he's gotta put on the face of a liar but when you wanting mercy he can't put the face of a liar he was the face of a lap so when I believe like a vessel of Mercy is the need of mercy he changes and he becomes the flam and he says come on my child let's talk it over or they say I'm condemned he says come on they still blood on the mast you say let's settle your issue and the child of Mercy sells but Lord the devil has done this then he changes his face [Applause] and then he puts on the he comes in behind you but why does he become blood because he understands mistakes can be made we shall always make mistakes and if we make a mistake thank God there is blood thank God there is blood don't stay in your mistake don't stay down rise up a few mercy on the mercy seat but you that wants a Redemption cleaner go with your face a manner and your chest stuck out and say I got the Lion of the tribe of Judah hallelujah why does he become both because he still has to serve and the prophet of God says Redemption is in two parts it's a source of power he's got to save you physically but he's gotta save you feel spiritually so the save you spiritually in [Music] [Applause] and it says she was healed because it was our to claim the healing of the the Lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed not he shall prevail he has already overcome let me say to you your problem was already overcome your situation was already overcome the victory was already pronounced all you gotta do is open your eyes to see what God has already done for you Joan was weeping but the Prophet says his weeping did not last just but for a minute they stood one of the elders say don't weep John oh my he's crying didn't last just for a minute what stop the crying of Jonah when he heard the message the Lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed and Joan hallelujah he stopped crying oh I like this just when he had the revelation of what had happened John stop crying let me say this afternoon when you have a revelation of what God has already done you can stop crying you don't need to wait for the manifestation of the thing that we are praying for when you have a revelation of what God has done you can stop crying I said you can stop crying because the Lion of the tribe of Judah has already prevailed you can stop crying right now in the church you can stop crying you can begin to praise God though you are still sick that God has already paid for it the devil is only lying you are coming out of that situation you are coming out of that sick bad you are coming out of that position by forcing by order you can start to praise God even whilst you are in church knowing that I got bills that are no pain knowing that I got a situation back Harmer but you can start thinking God by a revelation knowing the Lion of the tribe of Judah has already prevailed oh who understands what I'm talking about you can start thinking God right now so what he has already done oh my pocket is still empty you can start raising God right now and when you praise God for what you don't have God will supply your needs according to his riches and glory let's stop thinking God right now let's stop raising God right now let's stop thinking God right now thank you lord so what you're already doing thank you Lord for the grace that is coming in my life thank you Lord for the victory that is coming to me oh that's not enough praise come on praise God somebody you can thank him not for what happened but for what shall be just give me a little power here thank him for what shall be the Lion of the tribe of Judah has already prevailed he has already prepared he has prevailed on your situation he has prevailed in your case he's already prevailing while the message is going forth chains are breaking sicknesses are disappearing gratings are rolling away situations are changing oh praise God this afternoon it is the revelation what is about to take place the revelation unlocks a super faith praise be to God he's coming as a lion and when he comes as a lion it's by force in this by order and the Prophet says I have hunted in African jungles I've been around where Lions where he's the king of the beasts I've laid on the jungles at the nighttime and here the squawking and the hyenas and the laughing and the Holly and the different animals and some of them hyenas would make just cuddle and just cuddle your

specialness and at the time of this special message it is the beginning of the seventh seal but then the seventh seal is about to end are you with me but another thing that we also understand is that
