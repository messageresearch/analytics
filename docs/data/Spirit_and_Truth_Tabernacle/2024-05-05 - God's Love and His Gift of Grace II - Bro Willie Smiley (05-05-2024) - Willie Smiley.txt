back trust that they enjoyed there amen get away 31 years amen y'all pray for us we got a 25 year old today Christina's birthday today I tell you what I I remember when she was a little little fell baby now she 25 time is time is flying it ain't waiting on no man I almost got a 30y old yeah boy I tell you all right I I just thought I could keep them babies forever but it didn't work out that way they started growing up and I'm still trying to get over the fact that they not they not babies and let letting go is is been been difficult for me as a father protector and all of that trying to let go and uh let them them uh take their wings and fly that ain't easy but it's I guess it's just something that you have to learn to do amen as as a as a dad uh Romans chapter 5 we want to read the first uh couple of verses now y'all pray for me and uh we'll we'll just see how God directs us this morning it says therefore uh being justified by faith we have peace with God through our lord Jesus Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith and to this Grace wherein we stand and rejoice in Hope of the glory of God and not only so but we glory in Tribulation also knowing that tribulation work with patience and patience work with experience and experience hope and hope make it not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is is given unto us for when we were yet without strength and Due Time Christ had died for the ungodly uh for scarcely for a righteous man will one die yet pre adventure for a good man some would even dare to die but God commended his love towards us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us much more than uh being now just as ified by his blood we shall be saved from the Wrath through him for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life and not only so but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we have no uh we have now received the atonement let us bow our heads Grace father we just come to give thanks and praise this morning for allowing us this opportunity to be here Lord and uh we just trust that you could take control of uh uh our thoughts and help us to say something that'll be uh edifying and encouraging oh God this morning Lord we're just trusting and depending on you oh God and we just be so careful to give you praise in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated praise the Lord uh we just like to use a uh as a topic the um God's love and this is the topic that we used on Easter Sunday um morning and uh I told us during that time that it's just so much and and I'm going try to do my best this morning but uh uh when when we look at the scriptures uh the scriptures constantly unfold right you know even uh the brothers they understand you know you preaching sir I just want to also make mention I we appreciate brother Mark on Wednesday night amen I really I really enjoy the the young brothers and listening to what God gives them he's always real encouraging and preaching on the seven compound names and just really really encouraging and building our faith but um um uh as as ministers we we we realize you preach a sermon and then you go home and the sermon it it opens up and you preach a little bit more and it constantly constantly unfold right uh there's times uh even the prophet he made reference he said you know he goes from Genesis to Revelations and back and forth and and just W watches all the the shadows and types of the scripture yes sir and and also as as I was thinking about uh this Romans chapter 5 I thought to myself this is a good uh fundamental scripture for uh new converts and non-believers and things of that nature that that it'll help us uh in our experiences with God right uh one of the things I you know uh thoughts come as you as you studying and I was thinking you know uh when when we come to the world there's there's things that we don't even really consider especially at the early stages of Our Lives as as human beings um we don't really have many questions about things and and just as as we grow and and as we mature we we start starts to we start to look at life from a a a different perspective right questions start coming that that we need answering answers to in order to settle us amen as as uh individuals right even even before our conversions that's this questions start to pop up in our minds you know that we you could go on for years and you never consider you know I I can recall uh being a younger uh guy and and you know things just you you just you just come up and you grow up and and you might learn your uh family pedigree and and who your parents are and and you know your surroundings but then you're still you know you still realize there's an emptiness you know what what causes all of this what what's behind all of this and and that may not come for years like I say you know it wasn't until I got a little bit older uh cuz you know we grow up in church I went to Sunday school probably like all other kids did this morning uh I went to Sunday school but at at that time the questions really really wasn't there but then you know after being con converted you start you start to realize certain things right about our existence right right and and why we here and and what what brought us here in this condition where where we got to fight we got to struggle we we got to battle what what what what caused all of this yeah right amen what what caused all of this why why am I struggling so hard why why life is so so difficult on is that right somebody ought to say Amen this morning right wh why why is it such a a a a struggle every day there's there's a struggle there's there's mind battles and there you know some of us going through this morning physical battles and you know we've matured now we're we're we're in Christ and we we have some of the answers to our questions but you know uh just take for for instance some of these younger guys who who may not have gravitated to that spot where they have the kind of questions as yet but they're going to come to it now right but you know if there's a Bible question there's got to be a Bible answer if if any at any time that's questions God is obligated by his word to answer the questions that we have in our heart that's right is that right amen because when we look at scripture initially amen you go back to Genesis which is the seed chapter of the Bible we we we look at that and we and we we we realize amen that everything that God did was perfect right everything was good he was able to look and see my you know if if that's how he talked back then I guess that's how I talk all right but uh to to look back at at what he had did and seeing the the the order of the things and my this is this is wonderful yeah this is great setting a pattern right setting setting an order set setting Something In Motion even having the knowledge being infinite that that that would be a fault right but but God established an order right God's establ I got to say God I got to put it cuz what we find today is we find start to find the order of God and the principles of God uh is starting to be broken right that's right right but I mean we still got religion and we still got churchianity but you know you goad it's certain things that I find is missing right right and anytime we find that anything start to get out of its place right is it's it's kind of becomes chaotic right right it it kind of becomes a little bit deformed uh it be kind of becomes a freak HH right so I this is why I just kind of appreciate my understanding personally of of what Redemption is is that right right you know looking back at before the fall and so on Easter what we was just trying to show that you know God what God did but then show us also what the church what what the individuals did did right in in Breaking the word right right come on yeah glory to God because God gave them a mandate you know there's a tree here and there's something here and that day you eat thereof that day you die right yeah that was just so simple right right that that was very very simple uh but but then you know we know Satan had a plan yeah right amen Satan wanted to produce a family after his kind he Satan had Ambitions come on glory to God Satan had Ambitions right to to exalt himself right to be exalted to build a bigger and much better amen Kingdom than Michael ah right he he brought deception we know amen all the way back in heaven but then there was a war and he was kicked out he found himself eastn Eden uhhuh right he found God's Masterpiece right then then he found the woman he found the church however you want to place it it's all there right right and then he brought her he brought her amen a thought uhhuh right right they had discussion biblically yes come on see if we look back if we look back to Genesis he wasn't talking to her about drinking liquor he wasn't talking to her about smoking weed he wasn't talking see those things are just the attributes of sin come on now right his objective was to get her amen off of the word of God get her away from the standard of God that's it is that right get out get out from behind the amen The Fortress from behind her protection come on is that right Amen to to to just bring her to a place you know the Bible says she was she was deceived uhhuh yeah right that's scripture how many read that in the Bible there come on she was deceived yeah the Bible don't say no way where Adam was deceived right right right the woman was deceived yeah is that right glory to God Amen the B PL up but just thank God that God had a plan in the back part of his mind is that right but it it was be it was because of it was because of of this this deception right that that that that caused all of what we going through come on come on is that right my God glory to God but I want to read us some quotes this morning come on y'all pray for me take your time I know sometimes I don't read it's it's just it's just I'mma educate y'all a little bit uh I know y'all a lot of y'all ain't preachers and probably never will be a preacher but you preach by Rhythm uhhuh and once you find your Rhythm you don't want to break your rhythm right so sometimes if I don't if I'm in a rhythm and I don't feel a stop and know but you can challenge me on it when I get done uh but you're fine I'm in there so but this morning but this morning I felt like uh doing it doing it this way because I want I just want to break out I want to bring out some things so that you know somebody sometimes people you know uh uh you know brother SM ain't read no quotes I ain't had to read no quotes I was quoting the whole time all right all right all right amen come on brother all right but but I I want to read us this this some this this quotation now where it's from I I I got too much stuff up here I'm glad when we get delivered of this place so we can get a real pull pit back in the place you know so I could put some of this stuff up here come on brother you know come on if nothing else I want to deliver is try to preach and you got this little spot I have and cuz I'm a little old school too I have stuff on this tablet and paper and I'm trying to get used to the computer but but I want to read this quote uh uh he says but but uh now this is this quote is just dealing with after the fall uh right after after uh uh uh the fall and God comes down and things of that nature he says but then uh when I see when this poor little Eve looked over in the face of Adam poor little Eve come on right amen and know that she was the cause of the fall of the human race right she threw her arms around and Adam was not deceived uhuh the Bible said he walked out with both eyes open oh my right Adam at no time was deceived yeah right amen but Eve was deceived because Eve was the one having the discussion with the serpent it don't the Bible don't say nowhere where Adam and the serpent was having this this uh dialogue yeah right but it does say that Eve and the serpent right amen yeah uh uh cuz once they had to fall and and God comes down and and was bringing judgment and Adam said a woman and then watch he didn't say Adam she said the serpent right the serpent begal me right right right glory to God but he says uh he I'm just trying to use this to get to a little point because we we're we're talking about the love of God right yes and and one of the things that I want to bring out this morning is to show us just how how great the love of God is amen right the the love of God is just so great that that it didn't just it didn't just focus on the mistake oh my right it it right love love superseded all of that that's real good love love was so because because if it wasn't he would have brought judgment glory to God because now listen he he did tell him the day you eat thereof that day you die so he by right by right he could have judged them but then where things would have gone from there right glory to God but but in his mind a lamb was slain before the foundation of the world is that right amen amen amen you know I said all that to say you know sometimes uh even me more more now in this season you know when you start to talk about love we we we might need to really ponder it come on now ponder it really think about it based upon uh the love of God to see if it's if it's what kind of love it actually is right it can be a love yeah right but is it is is it an agop of Love based upon scripture huh right or it's ailio love based upon feelings and conditions and things of that nature right yeah glory to God oh my y'all don't get quiet come on come on I'm just getting started come on but he says and Adam was not deceived the Bible said he walked out with both eyes open Eve was deceived so he walked out I mean that's love right right amen uh uh he walked out with both eyes open Eve was deceived so he walked out he seeing that he wasn't deceived so his wife was turned right yeah he put his arms around her and listen I could hear them as they they uh start going out Clump Clump now now this was after God had clothed them uhhuh right right we unring but God was clothing God is always God is clothing amen huh amen amen he said what is it bloody sheep skin beating against the lead the go God that whole universe I can see it begin to come down like in a funnel and I like this come down to this little one thing four letters love l e he just couldn't see them oh my wow right wow he loved them so well that he couldn't see them go amen right uhuh he L's let's be realistic God didn't want to see them go from the place that he provided a place a place of security a a place of health and things God didn't want to do it sometimes as parents you don't want to do what you got to do but you got to do what you got to do Brother come on cuz sometimes you know one kid could be very detrimental to the rest of the kids all right and and in in in your heart you still love that person right right you know as a youngster I used to think my mama did not love me but then when I grew up she told me that that wasn't it she said you know what I wanted to make you a man so so I didn't I didn't cuddle you cuddle yeah yeah yeah I put responsibility on you right I I treated you a certain way right so so that you could Excel but but you know uh I took that as she didn't love me I could imagine the Eagles in in its nest when the mama walk in there and go crazy yes yes come on get the taking everything out the nest she F she F to kick y' you know the morning day time kick you to the curb a little bit all right cuz cuz if she don't you'll never come to a place of maturity so when you think she's insane right amen you you start realizing if she had not have done it I could have never expressed the attributes of an ego right she done made this thing tight tough and everything else right but but love uh was the thing that allowed ow her to do it right glory to God so so you put the quote back up God God didn't God did it didn't do it because he didn't love them uhhuh right glory to God okay uh so he loved them so well that he couldn't see them go and he said he put IM enity this where he gives them a promise between her seed and the serpent seed right well we can get into something on that and that same clumping of the Sheep's skin that Bloody beaten against Eve and Adam as they went out of the Garden of Eden uh them same blood of the Son of God beaten against his legs as he went to Carana with our sins upon him see the blood beaten from his body carrying up yonder into car do you believe that amen let me get one more then we we I'm going try to that's all right uh see if I could uh move forward right he said Adam was not deceived wasn't deceived he didn't have to walk out but he walked out because he loved his wife wow he walked out with both W Eyes Wide Open no matter if she had to go to torment he go with her now I don't know about that one I don't know I love my wife not going you talking about God's love right now brother yeah yeah amen yeah you talking about it now hey I I I love God more than I love anything yeah is that right now Adam Adam walked out you know he was typifying Crisis to a certain degree but now we talking about restoration and and and all of that right come on y'all got quiet now I'm not scared to say what I'm saying right you in there I'm not going to tornament for for wife kids neighbors grandparents and nobody else uhhuh well y'all ain't going to say Amen I'm going say Amen y'all head's going down y'all getting nervous can just feel y'all come on brother well if you're willing to if I'm going say this if if if for you willing to follow false word and take a chance at judgment that's on you I'm not willing to do that yeah yeah come on right now I'm a Christian right right to the best of my ability and I'm not willing to do that right right right well let me leave that alone yes sir that's starting to get hot and heated we we ain't trying to bring no smoke all right amen but he he go with her he said when God looked down and he seen that love of now this is powerful though he said when God saw the love of human beings it was so great that he couldn't stand it himself right he said I'll come and go two see and I'll put eny between them right but but it it it was because of a choice is powerful we can take that down I'm done with that we Choice it was because of the choice uh of Adam right that that caused all of this right be because had not there been a fall we understanding what we've been taught through amen a prophet that we would have came by the word right but after the fall the second Covenant was given right so we had to come by sex yeah right now if I'm off brother Jack correct come on right right yeah amen so so that's that's just God's order right yeah we we we come we come we come by say yes but it it was because of the Cho choice is powerful right and and church I I I'll say this you know and I'm 61 and I'm still learning I'm still growing I'm still maturing and in my thinking sometimes even of late I I I I talk to God and it's like it's if if it was for the Holy Ghost I would get discouraged a little bit all right um but you know God does things at his own time amen right G God gives us what he gives us at at his own at his own appointed time amen and sometimes you you you look back and and I tell you what as a younger generation it it's important for y'all to take the advantage of of the knowledge and the wisdom that's afforded you uh in this season right because I can say you know uh from my own personal now this just me from my own personal experience there's a lot of things that I did not obtain uhuh and wasn't accessible and even even in Ministry uh uh looking back they didn't have what I needed to help me as a young man all right all right come on Church yeah cuz cuz you know I I appreciate you know and we must get the baptism of the Holy Ghost you must be born again but but you know one thing I realize now you know after the birth after we get them born again what we going to do with them where we going to take them what what are they going to gravitate to right right and and life goes uh Beyond these four walls right amen life life goes beyond CHR Christian Life right devs into our entire uh existence that's beyond just shouting that's beyond just cuz uh you can't you can't just shout when you face with a trial you might be able to shout in the trial all right but sometimes you can't shout your way out of it right you have to have some knowledge some wisdom some some some understanding yes right glory to God some some communion with with God right where God can speak to you where God can direct you is that right and and and I and I'll say this because I've been around for a while now uh uh you you younger generation y'all in the best season ever oh my come on I I just wish that that you know I could have sat up under uh the kind of ministry that y'all are given the opportunity to sit up under in this hour because it's it's more it's more understanding it's more resources it's more things that's that's out here right right right that that all we got was was was the Holy Ghost yeah quoting and and and little pet doctrines and and that caused divisions amongst us and and and and just all sorts of things that were were not biblical and I'm I'm saying that the the attitudes and the different things that those things produce it was an indication that those things were not amen biblical because it's not God's objective to separate but to bring things together if if we really understand Redemption and what being redeemed is all about see the fall separated us right glory to God Amen it it was the thing that uh separated us amen from from fellowship and things of that nature yes come on but but God comes come came down uhuh right and and God had the resources okay okay to be able to bring back yeah together glory to put Humpy Dumpy back together all right y'all ought to preach with me I don't start walking brother Jack all right glory to restore the Masterpiece God had the plan in his mind amen amen amen that's it that's it and it wasn't to to bring separation but it was to bring together yes right to bring to bring the the family to bring the church back to a place amen where they could fellowship with God right Glory Adam didn't have the plan that's right he forfeited the title deed of redemption amen glory to God Amen he walked out with his wife yes he lost everything is that right but God wasn't willing for that to stay in that that that space right amen glory to God God God started to work in on the Masterpiece is that right glory glory to his wonderful name but uh I'm I'm trying to go how much time I got uh I I was saying to myself I want to just labor on this first part then get to my my text for today uh our subtitle will be uh we must see the the benefits of believing uh but give give me another two or three minutes on on on this this one part it was it was because of one one man's choice that that uh we find ourself in this position where we we bypassed our theophany we we you know we we come on the earth to be tested and tried right is that right glory to God and and and proven uh uh but then but then uh the choice of one man right which is Christ the choice that he made uh to to die right to die to to it was his choice to die it was his choice to give us the free gift amen right glory to God which which is is greater right when when we think about biblical principles when we think about restoration when we think about what God has done for us what God does for us supersedes everything amen supersedes all of our failures supersedes all of our our disappointments it it it catapults us yeah yeah is that right yes glory to God right when we place it on the scale cuz sometimes as individuals we hard on ourselves on and and we we have this tendency of of uh you know and and I'm guilty too sometimes of of um just poor me and why me and and come on come on self self-pity right and and and all of that and and they got this and I don't have it and you know and y'all ought to talk to me somebody uh and and it just it's an indication that that we're failing to understand what our faith and belief in God actually should be meaning to us all right all right all right what what it affords us right right well let me let me get on my text for this morning and then I'm I'm g go right but but I just wanted to you know show us it's it's like because of one man one man you know uh uh um choice uhhuh right I ain't got no hair this morning glory to God a whole lot of us ain't got nowh all right some of our headlines is going further and further back right come on yeah but I know I know in my other body boy I got a head for all right it might be nappy or whatever but it's going to be there all right glory to God hallelujah amen right but but but watch watch what what Paul Paul relating to uh this this Roman Roman Church church and and you know when when you really study the Bible the opening of the word is to Anchor us Amen to to bring stability right yes can we say Amen today the the opening of the word has never been about arguing and fussing I can't I I can't hard understand all that right amen but to bring Clarity to bring stability right glory to God to give us what it takes to be able to overcome in this age of of overcoming yes right because we got to overcome according to the Book of Revelations right but watch watch watch this he says therefore being justified by faith all right glory to God fa faith is a revelation right faith is a revelation of of of the will of God faith is is is an understanding of what God's plan for the church has been all about all right come on glory to God this hasn't been something that's been random yeah right right right amen sometimes you listen you listen to people and it's like that their comments and their statements and it's like you just don't really understand the plan of God right because because God people see you know they question God if if there's a god well why he allow this and why he allow that and why he allow this you you only seeing one facet uhhuh and and you're not really understanding just the the sovereignty and the love of God right amen is that right and and and what God is doing by what he's allowing amen right like the critic said one time um um a God that would just kind of sit back and allow mothers but then you know a man with understanding comes on the scene and and he sees where it had to be that seed had to fall into the ground and die right right it had right right see and in order for the next stage to come about amen we know that in planting anything that seed falls into the ground and die uhhuh right and and it's it goes through a process and through that process brings forth another stage and then another stage and then another stage and another stage to it bring forth you know a full grain of corn amen amen amen amen right amen amen glory to his wonderful name but he says uh uh therefore being justified by faith right we have peace with God yeah amen glory to God and and listen apart from that right apart from I belief and faith and what God has done for us you ain't you don't have any peace I'm sorry amen I'm sorry I'm I'm sorry amen glory to God and then you know this doesn't negate the fact that you goingon to still go through some stuff exactly right but in the midst of what you going through yeah you can go home and go to bed and go to sleep amen I listen to a brother talking about about Peter and how Peter Peter was Shackled to Two Soldiers uh had 14 others watching him amen was in was in the inner jail sleep come on brother sleep yes sleep all right and the next day he was going to get his head cut off he sleep right but he was sleep yeah yeah yeah not wored come on all right snoring yeah yeah mop yeah y'all know what I'm talking about when you get in a good sleep yeah boy you mouth open you might even have a little water trickling oh Hallelujah that's some good sleep boy you know you sleeping good when you hit one of these num you wake yourself up but you in there oh Hallelujah you in there you like woo Jesus might have been sleeping so hard it's like Lord have mercy where am I come on but you know what Peter had been influenced by his master it see it depends on what you come up in all right right that that really that really molds your character right I can recall the time on the on the Open Sea amen they was scared and Jesus was sleep that's right that's exactly right and at that time at that time Peter was fearful yeah run down there Master carth thou that we perish you in there my God we man we F to get to it out of here you don't care come on he car it for you huh yes sir Glory but by that experience by the time he got the baptism of the Holy Ghost that experience molded something in Peter now face with a trial now face with a situation amen influen by amen the present day word he could didn't know how he was going to bring him out didn't know how he was going to bring him through Glory but he was man I'm gone to sleep ain't no sense some worry come on now come on wor why am I going to worry I might as well I didn't see him worrying why I'm a worry he slept in the midst of you know a hurricane I'm I'm tied up with two two men one on this side one on that side well since you're there I'mma use you as a pillar hallelujah oh glory to God but God carth God's love God wasn't finished with him is that right amen glory to God Amen he said we have peace with God through Jesus Christ good see we we got to understand how how we benefit uh from being in Christ right believing the word no matter what anybody say so many critics so many Skeptics of the Bible that ain't got nothing to do with me cuz the Bible is for the believer my God my God right amen amen okay so he says by whom watch this the second verse he says by whom also we have Act access by faith right faith is a powerful thing amen it's it's simple you just got to be willing to just accept what he's done for you apart apart from Christ you have no access amen right you're not entitled to anything glory to his wonderful name you don't amen but by being by being on the outside right amen but by by what what he's done for us it it gives us access right amen something that's permanent right cuz he here's here's here's sometimes our understanding of of of things right oh I made a mistake then then we're we're kind of fearful yeah you know and God don't operate like that come on now we operate like that come on God don't operate like that right right amen it because if we're actual sons of God and there's a genuine birth in us there's always amen a communication there's always access that we have to the father and it's not predicated will I make you're going to make mistakes what no yeah come on y'all stay with me come on huh yeah we we going to make mistakes yes sir even the prophet say he made what yes it's it's so caral when you hear people say well brother B didn't make no mistakes come on it's like come on y'all con yeah that's right we talking about you we talking about human instrumentality this this man would let you know man God will tell me one thing and I'll do the exact opposite that's right that's exactly right that's a man or he allow he a prophet allow somebody else to talk him into something that God told him not to do that's right brother and that's just biblical we know in the Bible God told a prophet you know you you go this way and don't don't stop don't talk another Prophet another Prophet came you know and then look what happened to him come on so so as long as we in this we going to make mistakes let let me just say this y'all ain't none of y'all perfect not not not in the flesh my perfection is in Christ by being in Christ praise God glory to God amen amen I you know I know we looking good and cute and all that and this and that and other got hair cone all of that that don't mean nothing amen you ain't perfect amen none of us ain't perfect our Perfection come on give me one teaching on that come on now give me one bit of thought on that it ain't there our per even though Perfection is required our Perfection amen is met in Christ right so you see the benefit of of faith in in a work that you couldn't do right you didn't do no man did no matter how much we appreciate Ministries seven angel or any other Angel amen uh we know the work was done in Christ all right praise God is that right glory to God now we appreciate many Ministry yes we appreciate Brothers right right we appreciate the works in the body right right yes but if Christ had to went to Calvary forget about it we'd be done we be we' be finished amen right glory amen so so you you got to understand something you can't afford say this again real slow you cannot afford to be outside of Christ amen praise God whether you fully understand all of what I'm talking about this morning right now uh I'm going say something that you can understand you cannot afford to be outside a man of Christ Glory right and it has nothing to do with this Build It come on now it has everything to do with being baptized into one body Glory come on that's what we've been taught right amen not religion not names on the window but a spiritual baptism being placed in the body yes right glory to God you can't afford to church well I'm on the fence I'm still I'm still you better stop thinking and get try to find a way to get in oh amen glory to God Amen okay I'm almost there come on it might take it a I'm just going to my time okay by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand right and rejoice in Hope of the glory of God Amen and that's and see uh this this this rejoicing comes by being in Christ and Christ Alone amen right this this rejoice it it means this Triumph all right come on Amen this this this victory that we haveen right cuz a Victorious man he Rejoice amen a man that that is that is triumph right he Rejoice but a man with no clue well praise the Lord come on y'all shout and y'all what what what what are we doing when we in here and we screaming and holling that's a sign of Tri man Triumph right that's a sign of Victory glory to God cuz you watch a man that ain't got no victory I Wy Wy woo woo yeah like brother Jew would say Wy Wy woo woo huh glory to God but a man that's that's that rejoice and has Victory oh Lord amen am man just got a pep in his step yeah glory to God smile on his face amen he going through but he still smiling all right amen all however manye he got in his head he let everybody see it if he how many you supposed to have 32 32 he might have 30 still smil he might have 15 still SM SM amen man you might be saying man you you know you missing something it don't matter if you know what I know if you got what I got Glory huh you got you got 32 but you won't let nobody see them huh you won't let nobody see them people ain't even seeing them things in years I'm old school that huh glory to God glory but we rejoice in Hope of the glory of God I'm I'm okay I'm just read these because I I don't want to comment I want to get to the sixth verse I'mma just skip that part that's a sermon in itself right there come on right but I'm I'm I'mma skip down to the six verse at the same time right it says for when we were yet without strength right and and this this means when when when we had no ability to redeem ourself come on right no ability not one of us in here right we had no ability to redeem ourself once once amen uh uh uh Adam made the choice right uh uh to to walk out with his wife and everything amen no matter what he tried to do and we know he tried to work and put something make a religion figle it did not work my God it didn't work yeah and nothing listen Church nothing we try to do humanly will work it's just accepting a work that's already been [Applause] done believing in what's already having faith in what's already been done for us exactly right amen that's so simple to grasp is that right glory to God the Bible says not works that any man should boast right cuz you can work all you want you can cook chicken you can do all that now you might get in uh I'll just say this by being good to the bride yeah but I ain't taking that chance cuz you might not be good enough the work might not been enough to get you in yeah right but amen there's a free gift that's been given you just got to amen accept amen right yeah glory to God Amen it's it's not you know uh uh you know and I know the younger generation too not now I I believe that when we get the spirit of God in us God character it it it has to grow right IM mature and and weed out right glory to God and until that time when you make mistakes you just repent make it right and you just keep on going is that right praise God Amen we scold and we you know we're different than what God our love and God's love is too different and I've seen this too too often it's it's just totally different yes right amen I think we all just got to grow up a little little bit more in what the real love of God is amen right you say well why you say that brother Smiley because it's the truth because we we we're so accustomed to just looking at the carnal and the Earthly mistakes and and we we become judgmental and it's just so many attributes that's contrary to biblical understanding right that we need to achieve glory to God glory to God my God I can't point my finger at you but you can't Point your finger at me righten right be because if any of us get in it'll be will'll get in because of him right not because of our works not because of you know our money and not because of how good we look it we ain't getting in because of our that we getting in because amen of Christ by being predestinated for the foundation of the world is that right God Amen wrote our names on the lamb book of life before now I'm still moving right glory to God but when when we were yet without strength right when when when I didn't have the strength right right amen uh to transform my life yes right amen he said in due times Christ died for the ungodly right right and what was the due time all right at the at the end of the Old Testament right that was God's time amen right that was that was God's time to bring the second Adam on the scene to make a choice to die for me that I could receive justification by faith

Christianity all right we don't think that's we don't think that's Christianity oh my we don't we don't see that as the love of God I'm struggling wow and we be screaming god know yeah I see you know

spiritually yes that's right come on amen all of us should have said Amen to that cuz we chose life over death he said but God commended right committed his love towards us when we think about this

oh God has smart me he's been good to me praise the [Music] Lord thank God for his word Amen on this morning uh just a wonderful angle on the love of God and uh how we just appreciate his love that's been uh given to us I just love the the scripture while we were yet sinners Christ already died and uh God had a plan from the very beginning when he saw Adam and Eve make the decision God it didn't catch God by surprised uh God knew these things were going to happen but this was a way for him to express his love to us and uh you know it's just it's just beautiful i i i i as brother smile was just kind of going through uh the sermon then uh so much I just saw you know uh in the in the way that he painted the picture for us uh on today but uh I I really appreciate that thought of how when we're going through great trials and we realize the love of God that is given to us we're going through great trials distresses you might be going through right now but I'm going to tell you something don't you go home and be up all night the Bible says in the Book of Psalms that he gives his beloved sleep God God give you sleep it's it's only the devil trying to take your sleep from you I don't care if your bill ain't been paid and you you're trying to figure out how you going to get the tax is taken care of or the mortgage taken care of you just go to sleep God going to take care of it amen especially if you are a faithful tithe payer then there is a promise in the scripture that says I will now this is not your job but this is God's job I will rebuke the devour for your sake that's just the first part of it but there's another part to that promise is then I'm we going to open up the windows of heaven and pour you out blessings where you have room not enough to receive and when you get blessings where there's room not enough to receive you know it's easy to go to sleep amen but I'm telling you before you get there just just sleep just sleep just sleep just sleep just sleep God got everything under control amen how we thank the Lord God bless you brother Smiley thank you for getting yourself out of away and allowing the Lord to use you amen praise God I'm I'm glad he kind of went back to that thought but I was just watching how the Lord was just um just just take carrying him through that sermon I saw a lot here today and uh I just I just I love it you stayed with that thought there and just carried it all the way through and Ma brought us back to the scripture I say he boy this is all right this is this is this brother Smiley this is Brother smiley we we thank the Lord for him amen uh he mentioned uh brother Mark we had a chance to hear your service as well which which this sermon connected to the sermon on Wednesday uh brother Mark preached on be still and um and he was saying something like be still don't mean what we think it mean it's not just kind of like this but it's just waiting on God be patient with God God right I mean and and and and that be still don't get all frustrated pretty much be still mean go to [Music] sleep oh Hallelujah but uh but you know we we really I got a chance to listen to and and I was just blessed and when I got to um to Maine a brother walked up to me uh from Michigan he says uh I I appreciate brother Mark's sermon on on Wednesday night I'm like you l in Michigan how you he stream the service but it said he enjoyed what he heard and uh and I'm just glad to see that you know the food is coming forth to feed God's people amen right here we want to bring you we want to bring you sheep food amen that's what's going to sustain yes brother SM Smiler was saying even this morning we uh our are when we were coming up uh it was a lot of infighting in this message it's a lot of infighting if if you didn't believe a certain thing you were out the circle was drawn and you were drawn out and uh and and you know it had churches all over you know but you couldn't fellowship with nobody because they didn't believe exactly what you believe and we had so much of that and and and all the sermons were designed to do is prove a point really it was the same thing being preached every time just a different title y'all go back and listen to the tapes it was the same thing being preached every time just a different title but here you know as God has matured us we realize there's more to this word than than that and even brother Brandon himself never went to seed don't know one thing he he he he shared all of it with us right so we thank God for this and and I just thank God for how the the brothers just kind of get themselves out way all the way from last Sunday brother brother quu and you know just just how the Lord used him brother Mark come on and take it from and brother Smiley I I appreciate y'all so much I appreciate y'all so much but we uh we we thank God for you amen I um um um sister Eric and I had a a a whirlwind week let's just put it that way when we left here on uh last Sunday um just so much happened just throughout the week I I I left here and went straight to the studio uh for my daughter's project and they've been waiting on me to kind of come and and get my parts in so um you know we we got there and recorded and while we're sitting there recording in the studio there's an anointing that came in and it jumped on sister [Music] Erica praise the Lord so sister Rebecca said I would just be honored if both my parents would be on this project with me and they put sister Erica behind the mic and and got her on one of the songs so we thank the Lord for that y'all look forward to hearing it y'all look forward to hearing it amen but we we went from there to the uh Ohio we were there in Sugar Creek and just you know just uh they had the ministers pastors and pastors wives get away and uh it was supposed to be a time of rest but um we had morning sessions and evening sessions of just devotions and different ones speaking just wonderful wonderful thoughts that some of the brothers was bringing uh about about being just just a role of Pastor and uh but in between the sessions everybody wanted to fellowship with you and uh and you just didn't get the rest you got a lot of Fellowship but not the rest and we left there on on um uh they actually saved my devotion I told you I had to speak and they didn't tell me when they put me last everybody spoke everything and I come last but I told the brothers I said you know what um I was born at the end of the month and since I'm born towards the end of the month just my birth put me last right so you I say so I'll just do what I have to do and the Lord just kind of gave us a little thing uh on um on the tail of three kings and I had to uh there's a book that I read when I first started out in Ministry about these different styles of leadership and um King David King Saul and King Absalon and uh and you just you know that just talks about their characteristics and how they changed and and recently I I read that book um um you know before but I told my wife I was looking for it and we couldn't find it at the house and she said you know what I I'll get it off Amazon and I have it here tomorrow so I got a chance to read it before I went and as I going through this book there was seasons in my my Ministry I felt like you know what you were a David here but then other Seasons you are s and you got to watch yourself hello somebody and so I just begin to see certain things you know that that kind of play out in life and like okay Lord help me so I can be uh more like you in everything that we do we want to be more like Jesus amen so we we thank the Lord you know for that and and and on that Wednesday that I had to do that it just so happened to be me sister Erica's anniversary so uh we celebrated our 31st year there and and and we want to thank you all for we got so many messages and texts and you know even some saints just sent us a a little blessing we really appreciate it amen we re we really really appreciate it we thank God uh that he has given us this 31 years and you know I was telling her I said um when we stood in an altar 31 years ago we had no idea we'd be doing what we're doing right now for the kingdom of God but we're happy to be doing what we can for the kingdom of God we're very very grateful amen and from from there on to Boston

what the Lord is uh calling us to do praise the Lord amen let's um have a word of pray prayer amen as we prepare to dismiss father we thank you for your your word today coming through your serving Lord just uh helping us to see your love and how great that love is it was even it was demonstrated in Adam when um the prophet said that Adam was willing to go out with her um it it showed that this was true truly the love of God that was inside of Adam because that same love caused you to leave your throne in glory to come to this earth and to bring to us the Redemption story father we could never ever exhaust the love of God we can never we can never really uh Gather in our minds Lord just this great s sacrifice that you made and as brother Smiley was saying this morning we can have so much we can have the quotes we can have um um we can have uh Lord the the the scriptures we could have uh dressing nights we can have all these things Lord and but if we don't have Christ we don't have nothing we can have good jobs we can have good careers um L we can have good families we can have a good house we can have a good car but if we don't have Jesus lord it's it's worthless so help us to realize Lord uh how much you love us and God that uh even right where we are if we just turn to you and accept the love that you've given to us God you begin to uh make the difference in our walk and in our life and and um father we we can stand with a testimony like brother Smiley some 35 36 years later when that love was accepted he's able to stand and even through every trial and every uh distress and every tribulation God we can still uh look forward to coming into the house of the Lord father we we heard here today that uh no matter what it is that we're going through we can go home no matter what the trial is we can go and lay in that bed and go to sleep knowing that our God will work everything out amen you you you you never failed up us yet and father you never will so father we just give you praise I pray your blessings upon the Saints as they prepare to leave this place but not your presence thank you for um these men of God thank you Lord for brother Mark who shared on on Wednesday night and God as we come here and Lord never KN how you're going to speak father but you you constantly encourage us and strengthen us Lord right and saying the right things as we have need of it so bless these brothers oh God thank you for each and every one in their respective places Lord we uh also thank you for my precious sister God you brought her through a mighty surgery a mighty surgery and Lord just to see her be able to come back into the house of the Lord today God how grateful uh we are you are an awesome god you're an awesome God you're a God that answers prayer and Lord how we praise you how we thank you pray oh God that you would bless us as we leave this place but not your presence may you keep us until we're able to come back together again on Wednesday night it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen I forgot to mention this when my sister was in the hospital we were there one night and uh I was there visiting her and and um and you know she had a a a roommate and um and this roommate had two daughters come in and and them girls begin to um play worship music and as they begin to play worship music uh they began to try to create an anointing around their mom and um and them girls got so anointed they each one taking turns praying over mama and speaking in tongues and everything I'm like you know y'all don't realize what y'all doing over there cuz that's that's flowing right over here and uh you know so we uh you know sometimes it's good just to kind of go and get the right neighbor you know uh in your room another you know person that believes and and as they just got to praying and everything I just sat there and just patiently waited for them to finish and you know and um and uh and so I went over next door and told him said I just love to have a quick word of prayer with your mom um I'm I'm also a pastor and would just love to just offer a word of prayer so quickly offer the word of prayer because the nurses were waiting for us to get out of there uh but uh but it was just a blessing and and I think you know when we saw that it gave us a a confidence gave us a peace it let us be able to sleep God was in control God was in control he even control what what neighbor he would have in the bed and just how they would just create that atmosphere like that so it was real it was just a blessing God has a way of just giving you peace like that with whatever you're going through sometimes all you got to find is a the cloud the size of a man's hand and when you see that cloud the size of a man's hand you just start rejoicing now you ain't got the victory yet but you can see yourself with the victory so you just start rejoicing cuz there only a man that has the victory that can Rejoice praise the Lord God bless you church amen the brothers will come at this time to dismiss you praise the Lord [Music]
