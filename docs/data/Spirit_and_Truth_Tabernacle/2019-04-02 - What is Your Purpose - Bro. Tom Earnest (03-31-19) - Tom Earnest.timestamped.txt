[1:04:43] they're serving the Lord and and trying
[1:04:45] to do things right you know the devil
[1:04:46] gonna be right there to find them amen
[1:04:49] and we've seen some come and we don't
[1:04:52] see you know everybody this morning so
[1:04:54] y'all be in prayer especially for those
[1:04:56] newcomers be in prayer and then people
[1:04:59] that think they might have walked in
[1:05:01] here by mistake God don't make mistakes
[1:05:03] he predestinate and he for ordains
[1:05:06] things to happen and you just pray that
[1:05:08] God would just give revelation and
[1:05:10] understanding to his people that's one
[1:05:12] of the things that we want to see God do
[1:05:14] in this hour just just sell their hearts
[1:05:16] with with Revelation and we we can't
[1:05:19] help but preach truth that's what we all
[1:05:22] about spirit and truth amen so sometimes
[1:05:25] people have not heard some of the things
[1:05:26] that we share but we don't want it to be
[1:05:29] anything - a man started and we wanted
[1:05:31] to be something that draws them closer
[1:05:33] to the Lord Jesus so we think no more
[1:05:36] for that as we're approaching Eastern
[1:05:39] there's a little project a man that we
[1:05:43] wanted to do with the just with the
[1:05:45] families here in the church and after
[1:05:47] church today there would be a little
[1:05:49] little area there that you can get a
[1:05:51] little cross and and what you're doing
[1:05:56] with the cross is it's just a way for
[1:05:58] you to come and sit down maybe have some
[1:06:00] family devotion and talk about what does
[1:06:03] the cross really mean to you what was
[1:06:04] what is a crucifixion mean to you
[1:06:07] personally right and you know you kind
[1:06:10] of talk about it maybe write some things
[1:06:12] on the cross and then we're gonna take
[1:06:14] it and put it together and just kind of
[1:06:17] have a little display here even as to
[1:06:19] what the cross meant for us as as
[1:06:21] individuals it's not just amen just
[1:06:23] another holiday
[1:06:25] Amen it's not just something that we do
[1:06:28] get some new suits and a man who dresses
[1:06:30] and and all of that that's not what
[1:06:32] Easter is all about but we should think
[1:06:33] about what our Lord and Savior did for
[1:06:35] us there's some 2,000 years ago I'm
[1:06:39] recalling the scripture says why while I
[1:06:42] was yet a sinner
[1:06:45] he died a man I I don't know about you
[1:06:49] but I am grateful for love like damn
[1:06:51] Amen before I knew him he knew me come
[1:06:55] on somebody then he had already died for
[1:06:57] me you know what mistakes I was gonna
[1:06:59] make in my failures he and he had
[1:07:01] already paid the price
[1:07:03] hallelujah so when I come to him and I
[1:07:05] had already repented he said I got this
[1:07:07] covered don't worry about it my blood
[1:07:10] with shame man it's covered all your
[1:07:14] sins and I think God for love like that
[1:07:16] so so as you as we're approaching this
[1:07:20] Amen I want you to just take it you'll
[1:07:22] have out there in each one we have an
[1:07:24] opportunity just kind of put on the
[1:07:26] cross and decorate your cross however
[1:07:28] you would like to decorate we're just
[1:07:29] gonna kind of bring it and put it all
[1:07:30] together and you know just until Easter
[1:07:34] time and so Sunday April 14th would be
[1:07:38] the last thing that you have to be able
[1:07:39] to return your cross so you get in a man
[1:07:42] of the 14th we want you to bring it back
[1:07:43] by the 14th so we can put all together
[1:07:46] for Easter Sunday amen the Lord Lord I
[1:07:49] believe Lord of less than just got a
[1:07:51] little card here also says a special
[1:07:54] thank you every kindness as a part and
[1:07:56] bringing joy to someone's heart is
[1:07:59] sometimes easy to forget that there are
[1:08:02] nice people out there doing nice things
[1:08:04] for others thanks for being such a
[1:08:08] special reminder this is coming from
[1:08:10] sister Verna and the Jemison family in
[1:08:13] the loss of their loved one just

[1:08:17] and their support during this time of
[1:08:19] their loss and continue to keep the
[1:08:21] family in your prayers that God will
[1:08:24] just continue to give them strength and
[1:08:26] direction through this time amen so

[1:13:18] bring you greetings from Wichita our
[1:13:21] pastor there brother Pinkston they are
[1:13:27] in service at this moment as we are and
[1:13:30] so just remember them we're gonna just
[1:13:32] read a couple of verses of Scripture out
[1:13:34] of the book of Acts chapter 27 we have
[1:13:37] been much in prayer for our service
[1:13:41] upcoming that we have now got upon us
[1:13:44] here asking the Lord to give us
[1:13:48] something out of his word that'll just
[1:13:51] just encourage our hearts Acts chapter
[1:13:59] 27 and verse will pick it up this is in
[1:14:03] the middle of a Paul's journey to Rome
[1:14:06] he was of course a prisoner on this
[1:14:08] journey and we find that as the journey
[1:14:13] eclipsed wonderful wonderful lessons to
[1:14:16] be learned out of this this journey he
[1:14:19] had to get there it had been prophesied
[1:14:22] that he would go go to Rome so it was no
[1:14:25] question about him arriving safely but
[1:14:28] this hey just a little excerpt out of
[1:14:30] that journey acts 27 and verse 13 and
[1:14:33] when the south wind blew softly I want
[1:14:39] you to notice that next word these are
[1:14:41] these are the ship people these are the
[1:14:43] people that are escorting him when the
[1:14:45] south wind blew softly supposing that
[1:14:48] they had obtained their purpose loosing
[1:14:55] thence they sail close by
[1:14:57] Creed everybody with me say that one
[1:15:00] word supposing you know these people got
[1:15:03] under uh that soft wind from the South
[1:15:06] coming calmly rocked him right to sleep
[1:15:09] I just want to point that out for we go
[1:15:13] any farther because it was it was a soft
[1:15:16] south wind was blowing on and and
[1:15:20] because of that comfort level that they
[1:15:23] had reached they were supposing that
[1:15:27] they had found their purpose but look at
[1:15:29] Burt what's the next word but if you get
[1:15:33] rocked too much asleep but something
[1:15:35] might happen but not long after there
[1:15:41] arose against it a tempestuous wind
[1:15:44] called Yurok Ladon that sounds like a
[1:15:50] dinosaur so you Rock Ladon come up
[1:15:56] against that south wind that was blowing
[1:15:58] softly yeah and you know why it rose it
[1:16:01] was to get Paul where he was supposed to
[1:16:04] let's pray together Heavenly Father
[1:16:06] today as we go into the word our hearts
[1:16:09] are always encouraged to see these
[1:16:12] little things that the word has for us
[1:16:14] and holds for us
[1:16:15] it keeps our hearts steered in the right
[1:16:18] direction
[1:16:19] we pray today that we can every one find
[1:16:23] some some comfort some strength some joy
[1:16:27] some peace some long-suffering that all
[1:16:30] belong to you that it'll come our way to
[1:16:31] death we always enjoy coming I have to
[1:16:35] come out and sit in on the songs and the
[1:16:38] ministry of our brother in the psalm
[1:16:40] service and the specials and the choir
[1:16:43] and every one of them that participated
[1:16:45] Lord rained down a special blessing upon
[1:16:47] them today we ask these things in your
[1:16:50] name amen and amen god bless you may be
[1:16:53] be seated he says I've got a hold this
[1:16:57] so I'm gonna do it
[1:16:59] last time y'all experimented with the
[1:17:01] time of the pill Mike but easy says that
[1:17:03] thing that went by the way too grave I
[1:17:08] always enjoy coming by just everybody
[1:17:12] that I talked to that gets to come by
[1:17:14] there's something about the the
[1:17:15] Fellowship of our brother and your
[1:17:17] saints that come and it's just it's just
[1:17:20] a privilege to be here with you short
[1:17:22] little stay this time just passing
[1:17:24] through we're actually going to to fly
[1:17:27] out of here and make a little journey up
[1:17:28] to Baltimore Maryland on on Tuesday and
[1:17:31] then come back and rejoin our vehicle
[1:17:34] and pick up our chariot and go further
[1:17:36] on the journey so but it's just a
[1:17:39] pleasure to have this time my wife's
[1:17:42] been a little we spent a few days of
[1:17:45] vacation over around Port Charlotte area
[1:17:47] I know some friends from Canada they
[1:17:49] would like to come down there and so we
[1:17:51] went over and stayed with them for a
[1:17:53] week and now we're making this little
[1:17:55] journey north back to our children in in
[1:17:57] Navarre Pensacola area before we get
[1:18:00] home and then by Memphis for some
[1:18:03] services there Memphis on the way home
[1:18:05] so that's our journey and and you are
[1:18:08] here it was gonna be here he knew
[1:18:13] exactly exactly who would be in the
[1:18:17] service it's it's a it's it's just never
[1:18:21] a disappointment when you when you see
[1:18:25] something in the word that that strength
[1:18:28] comes out of areas you know people ask
[1:18:30] me a lot of times especially young
[1:18:33] people been in the message a long time
[1:18:35] now I'm in my 40th year ministry right
[1:18:37] if I preached his heart his brother Jack
[1:18:40] I'd be finished by now because I'd only
[1:18:43] got about twenty one or two years down
[1:18:45] there not have been done yeah but I
[1:18:47] space myself out a little bit I'm in my
[1:18:49] 40s Peter this guy's high-octane that's
[1:18:54] all I can say about that you know you
[1:18:56] pull up to the pump so these new cars
[1:18:58] need that hot stuff
[1:19:00] my wife my boyfriend got her another car
[1:19:03] needs that high octane it just it just
[1:19:05] breaks my heart every time I see the
[1:19:07] difference in regular and high octane so
[1:19:10] I always think of brother Tom just being
[1:19:13] regular gas just being regular but it's
[1:19:18] just a joy it's it's wonderful to feed
[1:19:21] off of that energy I've known the pastor
[1:19:24] he was just mentioning in Ohio I didn't
[1:19:26] know I didn't know they ran that hot
[1:19:28] either but I'll have to get by there
[1:19:30] myself and see that maybe you just fed
[1:19:34] off of him but it's just a pleasure it
[1:19:38] is a joy I see some of your faces over
[1:19:41] and over again and you're continuing in
[1:19:42] the word that's how you know you're
[1:19:45] truly a disciple indeed a lot of people
[1:19:48] start the journey but those who continue
[1:19:51] in my word these are my disciples and
[1:19:53] then and and we pray today that that if
[1:19:57] you're new to the journey if you're just
[1:19:59] joining the battle if you're old-timer
[1:20:01] like us you know I got the got years old
[1:20:03] me now I'm turned 60 years old this past
[1:20:07] year I know you're surprised your
[1:20:10] brother Tom you don't look a day over 35
[1:20:13] you can I can read it see I'm not a
[1:20:15] prophet but I feel that coming in I feel
[1:20:18] it coming in actually we lived in Canada
[1:20:23] nine years my wife is Canadian and and
[1:20:25] of course I'm not quite old enough to
[1:20:27] draw us Social Security yet but I found
[1:20:30] out when I got up to Canada in December
[1:20:32] on a visit that you can start drawing
[1:20:33] your Canadian pension at sixty I was
[1:20:37] just overjoyed I never thought I'd draw
[1:20:41] a pension shape here I'm 60 years old
[1:20:44] it ain't gonna let me retire but it was
[1:20:46] we lived there nine years and I had no
[1:20:49] idea the brother that I was visiting
[1:20:51] there says you need to go down and just
[1:20:53] see what you can get cuz y'all done paid
[1:20:54] it in I mean
[1:20:55] get it back you know wander down to the
[1:20:58] pension office there and the Canada
[1:21:00] Pension Plan I work nine years while it
[1:21:03] was up there and contributed and found
[1:21:05] out they're gonna give me a whole 133
[1:21:07] dollars 95 cents a month that's only
[1:21:15] about 75 bucks Americans the exchange
[1:21:18] rate ain't too good right now but but
[1:21:21] it's still good to have so I just opened
[1:21:23] me a little Bank of Montreal account and
[1:21:25] I'm just just laying up some Canadian
[1:21:27] treasure but I'm just sharing that with
[1:21:31] you so if I go slow it's cause I'm old I
[1:21:34] once was young but now but I am a
[1:21:39] pensioner so I look at these young guns
[1:21:43] on the drums and the music over here and
[1:21:46] it's just wonderful to say God bless you
[1:21:48] down here I enjoy coming I can't even
[1:21:50] can't even sit in the back I always want
[1:21:53] to come out and be a part of the service
[1:21:55] with you sit in on the songs and enjoy
[1:21:58] that with you here you got a new
[1:22:00] neighbor behind I don't know if you can
[1:22:03] I'll do my best overrun that neighbors
[1:22:10] our neighbors sometimes you're not
[1:22:13] allowed to choose your neighbors just
[1:22:15] like your family you can't choose your
[1:22:17] family sometimes you don't get to choose
[1:22:21] good but today we're gonna just take a
[1:22:24] little little thought for you something
[1:22:26] I've had on my heart to bring for
[1:22:29] several days now and I keep looking at
[1:22:30] it and and you know people in this age
[1:22:33] you especially have trouble finding
[1:22:36] their true purpose my purpose is an easy
[1:22:39] thing to preach on because because we're
[1:22:43] not really interested in our purpose of
[1:22:45] what we want out of life but we're
[1:22:47] always searching for what he wants
[1:22:50] what our true purpose is take some
[1:22:55] people a long time to find it I wanted
[1:22:57] to read you a little quote from the
[1:22:59] Prophet if I can and of course we look
[1:23:03] back to Abraham last time I was here I
[1:23:05] know we spoke quite a bit about Abraham
[1:23:07] and his journey and his life and but the
[1:23:10] Prophet tells us in a message called
[1:23:12] faith is our victory that Abraham was
[1:23:15] just a man with no hairs his words
[1:23:18] Abraham was just a man with no certain
[1:23:21] purpose in life that was until he turned
[1:23:25] 75 years old see we always as young
[1:23:29] people all of your counselors in school
[1:23:32] all of your advisors your parents your
[1:23:35] pastors your your guidance counselors
[1:23:38] they are always always steering you
[1:23:40] trying to as it take a young person and
[1:23:43] steer them into a particular area of
[1:23:45] life kids go get their degrees in
[1:23:48] agriculture and they end up being
[1:23:50] bankers you know they'll they'll spend
[1:23:54] four years studying criminal science and
[1:23:56] they'll end up nailing the roof on a
[1:23:59] house it's it's just we do our best to
[1:24:04] take what this world has to offer work
[1:24:07] with it apply ourselves but God has a
[1:24:11] way of as with Abraham as brother
[1:24:15] branham says here Abraham was just a man
[1:24:17] with no certain purpose in life you
[1:24:20] remember last time we were here we were
[1:24:22] talking about brother Branham letting us
[1:24:24] know he was actually down there in
[1:24:25] Babylon helping build away on that Tower
[1:24:28] of Babel his early journey he was spent
[1:24:32] in in the heathen land he wasn't even
[1:24:35] Abraham Abraham wasn't raised righteous
[1:24:38] he wasn't raised by any kind of a godly
[1:24:42] standard as there was back in that day
[1:24:44] he was down there with his his father
[1:24:47] laboring away on the Tower of Babel
[1:24:51] with Eze brother branham says just a man
[1:24:54] with no certain purpose in life just
[1:24:59] with his father and his friends coming
[1:25:01] down from babylon they settled there and
[1:25:03] Shinar they had a tower built and so
[1:25:05] forth one day while abraham was praying
[1:25:08] no doubt he prayed through till he
[1:25:09] struck the end of god how did he do it
[1:25:12] perhaps he felt like this if there is a
[1:25:14] God who made the ark and let Noah float
[1:25:16] through he still lives today somewhere
[1:25:19] in the land of heathens where he was
[1:25:21] sojourning he touched the hand of God I
[1:25:24] think every one of us could say that's
[1:25:26] our testimony in the land of heathens he
[1:25:29] touched the hand of God and in there God
[1:25:32] give him a revelation that there was a
[1:25:34] city whose builder and maker was God and
[1:25:38] we read that all of Abraham's life he
[1:25:40] was a pilgrim and a stranger to the
[1:25:42] world because his one ambition from not
[1:25:46] having any certain purpose in life his
[1:25:48] one ambition was to find that city whose
[1:25:52] builder and maker was God he struck
[1:25:56] something he he caught God in a faith in
[1:25:59] that God that he first saw the New
[1:26:01] Jerusalem and he put his pack on his
[1:26:03] back and he became a wanderer not just
[1:26:06] floating about with any purpose but he
[1:26:09] had faith that there was a city whose
[1:26:12] builder and maker was God he had a
[1:26:15] purpose in life to find that place do
[1:26:19] you see he was just he was a farmer he
[1:26:22] hadn't done the end of bad I mean if you
[1:26:24] read some of the the history of Abraham
[1:26:27] he had cattle he had possessions came
[1:26:29] down to the place at him and lot had to
[1:26:31] divide it up and go separate ways but
[1:26:33] but we know that he hadn't really done
[1:26:35] bad in life but he had not found his
[1:26:38] true purpose he had not found his
[1:26:41] calling until one day we find out he met
[1:26:44] a stranger coming up over the hill but
[1:26:47] he knew who he was three men come
[1:26:50] walking up on the tent door and he met a
[1:26:52] man named
[1:26:52] hesitate and the profit lets us know
[1:26:55] that once he met Melchizedek it changed
[1:26:58] his whole his whole ambition he knew
[1:27:02] there was a city it was confirmation
[1:27:04] that there was a city to be had because
[1:27:08] he had met the king of that city and he
[1:27:11] knew by that acquaintance he knew by
[1:27:14] that visitation of the the king of that
[1:27:17] city coming to him I can't do nothing
[1:27:20] now but look for that city oh the
[1:27:24] Prophet goes if I can just finish this
[1:27:26] quote out for you you can't purpose
[1:27:27] anything of God's promise in your heart
[1:27:31] without finding the reality to it if
[1:27:35] your soul has been tormented by sins and
[1:27:37] doubts and ups and downs and
[1:27:39] frustrations and there's something down
[1:27:42] in you that's telling you there's
[1:27:43] somewhere you can overcome that
[1:27:44] why do you float around them from church
[1:27:47] to church and place the place just kneel
[1:27:49] down to you strike heaven and go beyond
[1:27:52] the sound barriers then you'll have a
[1:27:53] purpose in life you'll have a purpose in
[1:27:57] life he says you'll have a purpose and
[1:27:59] belonging to the church you'll have a
[1:28:01] purpose in being baptized you'll have a
[1:28:03] purpose in what you're seeking for not
[1:28:08] just doing it we don't come this morning
[1:28:10] just because it's Sunday morning we
[1:28:13] don't come because it's a habit we don't
[1:28:15] come because it's a routine we come
[1:28:17] because there's a purpose in us in a
[1:28:23] message called that day on Calvary
[1:28:24] that's what that's what all people has
[1:28:27] to do is find out what you are and
[1:28:31] what's the purpose Church isn't going to
[1:28:34] church just to play music and sing songs
[1:28:37] church is a place where corruption
[1:28:39] correction and judgment begins at the
[1:28:42] house of God he tells a little story
[1:28:47] about Abraham Lincoln here I was reading
[1:28:49] a story one of our greatest presidents I
[1:28:52] think the nation ever was was Lincoln
[1:28:53] not because he come from Kentucky but
[1:28:56] because he was a great man he was
[1:28:59] deprived of education but something was
[1:29:01] in his heart some purpose brother
[1:29:04] Branham says I like a man of vision I
[1:29:06] like people this
[1:29:07] something they're fighting for just not
[1:29:08] lay around well whatever comes we'll be
[1:29:11] all right
[1:29:12] Oh be up and at him Lincoln never let
[1:29:14] his education stand in the way he had
[1:29:16] something to do and I think every
[1:29:18] Christian ought to be that way find your
[1:29:21] purpose and go do it
[1:29:24] amen and amen let it not be the next
[1:29:30] best car the next best house the next
[1:29:32] best church the next best any of that
[1:29:34] let it be the purpose that God puts you
[1:29:38] here for now we've learned many lessons
[1:29:40] through these years learning it from
[1:29:43] from the the words of our prophet so
[1:29:46] often he would he would instruct us and
[1:29:48] let us know that that the trouble with
[1:29:51] people is they always think that in
[1:29:53] order for them to be serving God that
[1:29:55] their purpose has to be a large one
[1:29:56] right it's got to be something
[1:29:59] magnificent it's got to be got to be
[1:30:01] something spellbinding but we find out
[1:30:03] that the Prophet let us know that there
[1:30:05] were people who were were even in the
[1:30:07] days of our Lord he said Joseph of
[1:30:09] Arimathea was in the in the region he
[1:30:11] was enough of a disciple then he had
[1:30:13] enough money to be able to buy the tomb
[1:30:16] for our Lord that was his purpose oh you
[1:30:20] know he kindly hurt our feelings there
[1:30:22] along the way you'll find him saying in
[1:30:23] one place that God puts some people in
[1:30:26] the church you ready now some people are
[1:30:30] a part of the church just to help pay
[1:30:32] the power bills
[1:30:35] that is we don't have those folks around
[1:30:38] these lights is gonna go off soon and
[1:30:41] maybe the connection next door will get
[1:30:43] shut down too
[1:30:45] I'm just saying maybe it's all on the
[1:30:48] same breaker
[1:30:49] I don't know that y'all been around long
[1:30:52] I don't bother y'all but here this yes
[1:31:01] we all but but everybody thinks and you
[1:31:04] know what what troubles me and again I'm
[1:31:06] just gonna be a little evangelistic this
[1:31:08] more it as evangelistic as I can be now
[1:31:11] people think evangelism is sweating and
[1:31:13] running and hollering and tap-dancing on
[1:31:16] the back of the benches for a little
[1:31:17] while an evangelist can stand still if
[1:31:22] it's something that that evangelizes an
[1:31:25] area of your life I'm always happy let
[1:31:29] me just confess something to you I've
[1:31:31] witnessed it many times and I've told
[1:31:33] many of the churches that I go to I'm
[1:31:35] always happy if I'm done and one person
[1:31:38] got a little bit closer to the throne
[1:31:41] because of that sir I don't have to go
[1:31:44] into a church and have everybody all
[1:31:46] worked up in the ladder
[1:31:48] have everybody all raving about what a
[1:31:50] wonderful so if one person who's a
[1:31:53] little closer to the throne because this
[1:31:56] body is being made up little by little
[1:31:58] day by day
[1:31:59] in his own way if there's one thing that
[1:32:03] is said that inches you a little closer
[1:32:05] to the throne into your the fulfillment
[1:32:07] of what God has placed you here to do
[1:32:10] then it's been a wonderful morning but
[1:32:13] people get it in their mind they always
[1:32:15] feel like I hear it so awful well I
[1:32:18] could serve God better if you ever get
[1:32:22] you ever get around those folks that's
[1:32:23] all they want to talk about well I could
[1:32:25] serve God better if if we had more young
[1:32:29] people in the church I hear that one a
[1:32:31] lot well we're gonna up and relocate
[1:32:34] over here we're gonna relocate from this
[1:32:37] church to another Church because over
[1:32:39] there they got more young people well
[1:32:42] young people have problems see I'm gonna
[1:32:49] get in trouble now got a lot of young
[1:32:51] people here and listen to an old fellow
[1:32:53] saying I once was young I remember but
[1:32:57] they all there's always something well I
[1:32:59] could serve God better you know I was
[1:33:01] listen to a fellow the other day
[1:33:02] preaching a guy on radio he had a good
[1:33:04] thought he said you know he said I he
[1:33:06] said well we always got some reason that
[1:33:08] if this was different I could serve God
[1:33:10] better he said you know we I was getting
[1:33:14] on the airplane to come to this meeting
[1:33:15] the other day and and I'm walking by all
[1:33:17] those folks in first class rows 1a and
[1:33:20] 1b and and my wife and I experience this
[1:33:24] too you know what is something about
[1:33:25] walking on an airplane and folks up
[1:33:26] front when your seats all the way in the
[1:33:28] back they won't look at you now because
[1:33:32] because you belong way back there and
[1:33:35] you walk by Rho 1 a and 1 B and you're
[1:33:38] in 27f
[1:33:39] yeah and you're sitting back there you
[1:33:45] think well I could serve God better I
[1:33:48] could serve the Lord a little better
[1:33:50] my attitude would be a little better I
[1:33:54] stopped in on brother Stevens ear that
[1:33:56] he made one of the best statements I've
[1:33:58] heard a preacher say in a long time he
[1:33:59] says we're always wanting power to move
[1:34:02] a tree or to move a mountain but we
[1:34:05] don't ever worry about enough power to
[1:34:07] move a grudge out of our lives I told
[1:34:13] him after I said that's the most
[1:34:14] profound thing I've ever heard everybody
[1:34:16] wants want something bigger and more
[1:34:18] glamorous and something that others can
[1:34:21] see and something that others can
[1:34:22] participate in and can talk about later
[1:34:25] yeah but it's not location that's what
[1:34:31] real estate people have taught you and I
[1:34:33] know y'all have trouble with real estate
[1:34:34] down here the prices of things we took a
[1:34:38] little bus tour the other day we were
[1:34:39] over in Naples Florida there is more
[1:34:41] rich folks live in Naples then the whole
[1:34:44] state of Kansas they're all
[1:34:46] conglomerated together down there and
[1:34:48] the fellows giving us a little bus tour
[1:34:50] and he's showing us the town and he's
[1:34:52] telling us now on this side of the
[1:34:53] street and all these big fine houses
[1:34:55] that's where two millionaires live and
[1:34:57] they don't get to cross the street
[1:34:58] because over here this is where the
[1:35:00] billionaires live and they got Judge
[1:35:04] Judy and all them kind of people living
[1:35:06] there Elton John's got him a house there
[1:35:07] all these money people of the world
[1:35:11] fabulous wealth I never you know we get
[1:35:16] into a trap sometimes and we think man
[1:35:18] if I could just why does it always go
[1:35:21] back to money why does it always have to
[1:35:22] go back to money Jesus taught us so many
[1:35:26] lesson but he you know he actually
[1:35:28] taught more or less is more parables
[1:35:29] about money than he did about any other
[1:35:32] area prayer or faith or anything else he
[1:35:36] took that little woman that cast all she
[1:35:37] had into the offering plate he's a baby
[1:35:40] I hate to let you fellas know this but
[1:35:42] she gave the most because it was all she
[1:35:45] had
[1:35:46] it was all but that's that's the
[1:35:50] trouble with people they I find in this
[1:35:53] message especially you know I've been
[1:35:55] around long enough we came into message
[1:35:56] in 1969 and I remember a little
[1:35:58] community there in Tennessee where was
[1:36:00] was going to church there were actually
[1:36:03] people that would leave their jobs in
[1:36:05] other states there wasn't there wasn't a
[1:36:07] church on every corner like there is now
[1:36:09] it was it was lean Pickens back then but
[1:36:11] there were people that would meet move
[1:36:13] from two and three states over to come
[1:36:16] where the word was they would quit their
[1:36:18] jobs and come to the word I remember
[1:36:21] that I remember families moving in
[1:36:23] picking up their children to coming in
[1:36:25] and looking for for work in our location
[1:36:27] just so they could be in church but it's
[1:36:31] all different now now you hear of it all
[1:36:33] the time well I got to move over here
[1:36:35] because my job is taking me over there
[1:36:37] the first course question needs to be
[1:36:40] asked that person is there is there an
[1:36:42] assembly there is there a church there
[1:36:44] is there a fellowship there for you to
[1:36:47] continue your walk with the Lord is
[1:36:50] there well no I'll just I'll just taper
[1:36:53] I'll do it we'll do whatever I can do
[1:36:55] that's the opposite of the way it was
[1:36:58] people used to leave their jobs to come
[1:37:00] to church now they leave the church to
[1:37:02] go to their jobs they don't believe that
[1:37:05] God can provide a table in the
[1:37:07] wilderness
[1:37:09] do it he will prove you you'll prove
[1:37:13] himself to you that he is able to take
[1:37:15] care of your needs I know all the
[1:37:18] psychologist wants you to bloom where
[1:37:20] you're planted and all those things that
[1:37:21] you see on the internet you get on
[1:37:23] Facebook and they'll just have you doing
[1:37:25] all kind of stuff I'm not interested in
[1:37:28] that I'm interested in being where the
[1:37:29] Lord has placed me to be if my job gives
[1:37:33] out guess what he has another job for
[1:37:34] you he has something better in mind for
[1:37:38] you if your heart knows if you are
[1:37:41] convinced in your heart and soul in mind
[1:37:43] that this is the place that God has
[1:37:46] brought you to fulfill this earthly
[1:37:48] journey because this is just an earthly
[1:37:50] journey this one ain't gonna go on
[1:37:52] forever folks our purpose is much like
[1:37:55] Abraham's was to look for that city
[1:37:58] whose builder and maker was gone but
[1:38:02] people get it in their mind it's just
[1:38:05] again in the old days back in the late
[1:38:07] 60s and early 70s when we came into the
[1:38:10] message there wasn't churches on every
[1:38:12] corner there wasn't there wasn't houses
[1:38:15] of worship that you could just relocate
[1:38:17] from one to the other at will
[1:38:19] now it's just it's just church hoppers
[1:38:22] something will go wrong somebody done
[1:38:25] somebody wrong right I could have served
[1:38:28] the Lord better there if that sister
[1:38:30] hadn't cleared at me from the other side
[1:38:31] of the aisle and if she could have just
[1:38:34] had some in her I don't know what caused
[1:38:38] that flinch but all of a sudden we
[1:38:41] become prophets I'll suddenly become
[1:38:44] diviners of a human nature how is that
[1:38:48] why is it that we let such little petty
[1:38:51] things get between us in the word I'm
[1:38:56] not a big fan of TD jakes but I heard
[1:38:58] him say one of the most profound things
[1:39:00] that I've ever heard I do listen to a
[1:39:02] lot of preachers on the radio I can't
[1:39:04] stand to look at a lot of them so I do
[1:39:06] listen on the radio I tried looking to
[1:39:09] Joel Osteen one time he blinded me with
[1:39:10] those teeth
[1:39:12] the light reflecting off of those teeth
[1:39:14] I just couldn't do it but I do I listen
[1:39:16] on the radio and TV Jake's made a very
[1:39:18] good observation he said we allow people
[1:39:20] sometimes and he was he was using the
[1:39:26] scripture talking about redeeming the
[1:39:28] time listen to this now he said he said
[1:39:31] we'll allow a 15-second conversation
[1:39:34] with a brother or a sister something
[1:39:37] they say to us in 15 seconds
[1:39:40] we will walk away and let that ruin our
[1:39:43] lives for years
[1:39:46] listen just something they say something
[1:39:50] that we thought they meant that maybe
[1:39:52] they didn't even mean it at all and we
[1:39:54] will let that ruin our lives for years
[1:39:57] and years that will haunt us in our
[1:39:58] dreams and then our when our heads are
[1:40:00] on our pills that brother said that to
[1:40:02] me that sister said that to me and his
[1:40:06] whole point was this we need to go out
[1:40:08] and redeem those 15sec give them over
[1:40:11] into the hand of God and let him deal
[1:40:15] with that in your life
[1:40:17] erase it buy it back you know what
[1:40:20] redeem means it means to buy it back
[1:40:22] well you don't know how bad I've been
[1:40:24] hurt everybody's been hurt
[1:40:27] and everybody to say no session for who
[1:40:32] got hurt the most that's what the
[1:40:35] country-western people sing about
[1:40:36] somebody done somebody wrong we're not
[1:40:38] interested in that oh my goodness
[1:40:44] sometimes we let the enemy rob us robbed
[1:40:48] us of a true liberated I love the songs
[1:40:52] you sing the the comfort that they bring
[1:40:55] to you but we let the enemy rob us so
[1:40:58] many times of the victory because of
[1:41:02] those petty little things in our lives
[1:41:03] we have to find the purpose and once you
[1:41:07] know what the Prophet says you that's
[1:41:09] all you have to do is find out what you
[1:41:12] are and what's your purpose that's what
[1:41:15] he's encouraging us to do we're not even
[1:41:18] getting to our text yet let me get out
[1:41:20] two things running smooth we get rocked
[1:41:24] to sleep sometimes we get you know we
[1:41:27] think that we think that our Christian
[1:41:29] walk you know we didn't join no picnic
[1:41:31] you know that already it ain't gonna be
[1:41:33] easy all the time that's what I
[1:41:36] especially liked about our text when the
[1:41:39] south wind blew softly things that
[1:41:42] things was rolling along pretty smooth
[1:41:44] things had calmed down for them and by
[1:41:48] that comfort by that little rest period
[1:41:52] that they had been given it led him
[1:41:54] astray let me tell you something too
[1:41:56] brother
[1:41:57] that brother branham said about that he
[1:41:58] says he said I believe it was Lincoln
[1:42:01] that said one time in the time of peace
[1:42:04] prefect prepare for war he stops there
[1:42:08] he says now it might not have been him
[1:42:09] but it sounds like it was him that made
[1:42:12] that say me well actually it wasn't him
[1:42:14] that made it it was that that statement
[1:42:16] is contributed or attributed to George
[1:42:18] Washington all right and it wasn't even
[1:42:21] his he borrowed it as well I did a
[1:42:23] little research for you there brother I
[1:42:25] said I think it was Lincoln said this
[1:42:26] but it wasn't Lincoln everybody else
[1:42:29] sent in a mirror
[1:42:29] who thought it was George Washington but
[1:42:31] it was a fella by the name of you ready
[1:42:34] for this his name was Publius
[1:42:36] Flavius for genius rene das I'm gonna
[1:42:42] give you all the quiz on that afternoon
[1:42:44] in the four in the fourth century AD he
[1:42:48] was a Roman military writer and he wrote
[1:42:52] about the conquest of the Romans and and
[1:42:55] it was a Latin expression which meant if
[1:42:57] you want peace prepare for war but
[1:43:01] brother brems gonna teach us a little
[1:43:02] lesson out of this old expression even
[1:43:04] though he gave it to Lincoln we can all
[1:43:08] make those kind of mistakes family yeah
[1:43:10] sometime I might be quoting brother Jack
[1:43:13] and it could be somebody else you know
[1:43:16] we're all plagiarist let's face it
[1:43:19] everything I know about plagiarize I
[1:43:22] borrow from the best I'm borrowing from
[1:43:26] Paul and John Peter and I'm going to the
[1:43:30] message and I'm telling you what he said
[1:43:33] because the things that that are that
[1:43:36] are revealed belong in to us and to our
[1:43:39] children I don't have you know I've
[1:43:42] never had a little corner that you got
[1:43:44] to know you got it from me that's the
[1:43:47] trouble with preachers today the Lord
[1:43:49] will give them a little inspiration also
[1:43:50] there's got to be their doctrine it's
[1:43:52] got to be their teaching
[1:43:53] got to be their instruction it's got to
[1:43:55] be their view on the scripture that that
[1:43:58] you remember it doesn't matter where you
[1:44:00] got it from if it's the truth his truth
[1:44:03] will march on
[1:44:05] I know God used a donkey one time to get
[1:44:08] the message across if God can use a
[1:44:11] donkey he can use anybody to get his
[1:44:14] message across but brother Branham is
[1:44:16] talking about this
[1:44:17] he's a attributing this to Lincoln and
[1:44:19] to enna in the time of peace prepare for
[1:44:22] war that would be a good thing for us to
[1:44:24] think about in time while everything is
[1:44:28] running smooth you better get ready for
[1:44:30] Satan isn't going to let it run smooth
[1:44:33] very long he says you're in a convention
[1:44:37] now and everything he was in he was in
[1:44:38] Southern Pines North Carolina when he
[1:44:40] was preaching this you're in a
[1:44:42] convention now and everything will just
[1:44:44] pour a long fun but you're gonna leave
[1:44:46] here in a few days and you're gonna meet
[1:44:49] the enemy he might not even wait till
[1:44:51] you get ready to leave listen what he
[1:44:54] says he might attack any time he's
[1:44:56] wicked he's ruthless
[1:44:57] he just carries on whenever he can
[1:44:59] whatever he can say or do he does it so
[1:45:02] it's best to be dressed all the time you
[1:45:04] might meet him talking about the enemy
[1:45:06] in the mail you might meet him out on
[1:45:07] the street you might meet him in your
[1:45:10] car hard telling where you meet him or
[1:45:14] he'll meet you right in the seat there
[1:45:16] and me right in the pulpit here anywhere
[1:45:19] he's just wicked and he doesn't care so
[1:45:21] we want to be prepared for it what's the
[1:45:24] message that the Prophet is giving us in
[1:45:26] the time of peace prepare for war in the
[1:45:31] time of smooth sailing prepare for what
[1:45:34] God might be allowing to come your way
[1:45:37] you know it's not it's not it's not calm
[1:45:40] calm winds and and bliss that that marks
[1:45:44] out the truth the true designation of
[1:45:47] what a Christian life is we appreciate
[1:45:49] the times of rest the times of
[1:45:52] refreshing that comes from the throne
[1:45:55] but it's a battle my dear brothers
[1:46:00] you might meet him in your car could be
[1:46:04] on the way to church could be something
[1:46:07] the wife said that you need to go back
[1:46:09] and redeem that time are you with me
[1:46:13] might meet him on the street it's not in
[1:46:18] in the calm of the wind sometimes God
[1:46:23] deals with us and in this instance we
[1:46:26] took our scriptures back to the word
[1:46:29] there where we looked you find that that
[1:46:32] that that restful little time that they
[1:46:35] had when the southern winds were blowing
[1:46:37] softly when God had allowed him to find
[1:46:41] a little place of rest a little a little
[1:46:43] place where they we just wasn't fighting
[1:46:45] the battles so hard it deceived them
[1:46:50] supposing they had found their purpose
[1:46:52] now Paul had already told him
[1:46:54] Paul had already let him know we need
[1:46:56] that we need to win her right here
[1:46:57] there's gonna be some harm if we don't
[1:46:59] win it right here let's stay but brother
[1:47:01] Graham's words was the ship captain
[1:47:03] thought he'd know better than Paul
[1:47:04] thought he had more instruction on the
[1:47:07] matter thought he understood the soft
[1:47:08] southern breezes that was blowing in his
[1:47:10] face better than Paul and so he went
[1:47:14] ahead and cut loose but right after that
[1:47:17] a confession wind called Yurok Ladon I
[1:47:24] like to say that word I could just stand
[1:47:27] here and say it about a half a dozen
[1:47:28] times and be ready to go home
[1:47:30] you Rock Ladon came away like I said it
[1:47:34] sounds like a dinosaur don't it
[1:47:36] but here's one thing you'll learn about
[1:47:38] the troublesome winds when there's when
[1:47:40] the trials and the test comes and our
[1:47:43] weather service has taught us this they
[1:47:45] like to name everything you know he's
[1:47:47] doing the old days you just had
[1:47:49] hurricanes now you got a name to a
[1:47:50] hurricane you can probably name all the
[1:47:53] ones that's blowed through here since
[1:47:54] you've lived in West Palm Beach
[1:47:57] brother Brown talked about those those
[1:48:00] storms let's read one other scripture
[1:48:02] together Matthew chapter 7 I like what
[1:48:04] we were taught on this verse Matthew
[1:48:07] chapter 7
[1:48:09] Jesus is going to give us a little
[1:48:11] parable here concerning concerning your
[1:48:16] foundation in Matthew the seventh
[1:48:20] chapter we'll pick it up in 24 therefore
[1:48:26] whosoever you know this parable very
[1:48:28] well I know you've heard it preached on
[1:48:29] many times therefore whosoever hears
[1:48:32] these sayings of mine and doeth them I
[1:48:34] liken him unto a wise man which built
[1:48:37] his house upon a rock the rain descended
[1:48:40] the floods came the winds blew and beat
[1:48:42] upon that house and it fell not for it
[1:48:44] was founded upon a rock and every one
[1:48:46] that heareth these sayings of mine and
[1:48:47] doeth them not shall be likened unto a
[1:48:49] foolish man which built his house upon
[1:48:51] the sand the rain descended the floods
[1:48:53] came the winds blew and beat upon that
[1:48:55] house and it fell and great was the fall
[1:48:58] of it and it came to pass when the
[1:49:00] entity says the people were astonished
[1:49:02] at his doctrine it doesn't seem like a
[1:49:05] real hard lesson right there this is
[1:49:06] pretty easy build your house on a rock
[1:49:08] ins gonna be able to withstand just
[1:49:12] shows and folks hadn't been taught much
[1:49:13] at all they were still back in some ABCs
[1:49:16] right there in that early day here Jesus
[1:49:19] was giving him a little simple lesson on
[1:49:20] foundations building on a solid
[1:49:24] foundation but but the Prophet took up
[1:49:29] these verses and he gave us a little a
[1:49:30] little admonition here and I hope it
[1:49:32] strikes your heart today Jesus was
[1:49:35] speaking here of a coming storm which
[1:49:39] has got to strike every man and every
[1:49:41] woman that's born in the world you're in
[1:49:45] that verse you are in those verses this
[1:49:48] lesson on the foundation you are there
[1:49:51] he was speaking of a coming storm which
[1:49:55] has got to strike every man and every
[1:49:57] woman that's born in the world there is
[1:49:59] just no way out of it
[1:50:01] that storm will strike you sometime or
[1:50:04] other
[1:50:05] if you can look back in your past and
[1:50:08] and you've already weathered it god
[1:50:11] bless you today maybe it's this maybe
[1:50:14] it's that we don't even want to get into
[1:50:16] what how that could manifest itself in
[1:50:18] your life I do know for the body itself
[1:50:21] for this broad elect body there is a
[1:50:23] coming storm still out there ahead of us
[1:50:28] we get all worried about our fellow that
[1:50:30] lives near y'all over here in Marlo go
[1:50:33] go I don't really care whether you like
[1:50:41] it or don't like it God somehow has
[1:50:45] orchestrated all these players to be in
[1:50:48] the right place at the right I could
[1:50:53] care less about the politics though I
[1:50:55] don't care if you like the wall or don't
[1:50:58] like the wall I don't care if you like
[1:51:01] guns or don't like guns I don't care I
[1:51:04] don't care about any of those going ons
[1:51:07] out there but he's not gonna help you
[1:51:10] build a foundation that'll weather this
[1:51:12] storm is coming
[1:51:13] [Music]
[1:51:14] I could just
[1:51:19] I always got accused of stumping for
[1:51:22] Trump before he won I remember being in
[1:51:25] a lot of churches and every one of us
[1:51:28] thought there was no way he was gonna
[1:51:29] get there what many wasn't many prophets
[1:51:32] that could foresee mr. Trump being the
[1:51:34] president he had a powerful woman
[1:51:38] running against him
[1:51:39] they just got done with that Russian
[1:51:41] thing and there were two years I wasted
[1:51:44] their money finding out he didn't have
[1:51:45] nothing to do with it or so they say but
[1:51:48] if we got all political we could discuss
[1:51:50] that I don't care whether
[1:51:56] whether the Russians influenced our
[1:51:58] election or not I'll tell you who put
[1:52:00] the right man in office if he's if he's
[1:52:05] the devil incarnated himself he's there
[1:52:07] in office to help this thing there you
[1:52:15] are back to if I was sitting up there
[1:52:17] rolling one a I could serve God better
[1:52:20] than back here in 27c and see if you get
[1:52:25] in the mindset that it's where you are
[1:52:27] is what's the problem is then
[1:52:28] everything's gonna go wrong around you
[1:52:30] to even make it worse if you're in 27
[1:52:33] see the guy in 27 D and and on the other
[1:52:37] side of you they're gonna both of them
[1:52:38] gonna weigh about 400 pounds and your
[1:52:41] life could even be more miserable
[1:52:43] finding yourself back there it's not
[1:52:46] location we are sheltered that we have a
[1:52:50] shelter my dear brothers and sisters but
[1:52:53] brother branham is talking about this
[1:52:54] oncoming storm every man has to weather
[1:52:56] it every man's gonna face it that storm
[1:53:00] will strike you some time or another
[1:53:02] depends on what kind of a foundation you
[1:53:04] have you'll like this little quote I
[1:53:07] know you've probably read it but it's
[1:53:09] sir it's involved in your area here in
[1:53:11] fact he was in he I think he might have
[1:53:13] been in West Palm Beach when he was
[1:53:14] preaching this I'm not sure didn't get
[1:53:17] that down he says this he says not long
[1:53:21] ago I was told of a story that happened
[1:53:22] I believe I read it in the newspaper
[1:53:24] down in Florida they have many great
[1:53:27] storms that sweep through Florida
[1:53:28] typhoons that come in off the sea and
[1:53:30] bring the water four city blocks up into
[1:53:33] the city and sweeps out everything I
[1:53:35] like what he says there I'm told that
[1:53:37] their weather prophets are always on the
[1:53:40] lookout for such snores they call the
[1:53:43] meteorologists today yeah call them
[1:53:46] weather prophets they get it right just
[1:53:49] a part of the time it's not a true gift
[1:53:51] that's for sure and some way through the
[1:53:54] elements they can contact the changing
[1:53:56] of the weather in the atmosphere which
[1:53:58] away the weather's gathering that'll
[1:53:59] bring forth one of those storms because
[1:54:01] they made a life study of it and by
[1:54:03] certain instruments
[1:54:04] things that science has provided them
[1:54:06] and then by calling ahead and hearing of
[1:54:09] which way the storms coming how much
[1:54:10] wind has got behind him which way other
[1:54:13] storms are coming in or winds whether
[1:54:14] it's able to combat it or to shove away
[1:54:17] the storm he stops there said I could
[1:54:20] stop here and preach on that for an hour
[1:54:22] that it hears this point it takes a
[1:54:25] greater storm that's coming
[1:54:27] it takes a higher wind to turn that
[1:54:31] storm what a point he's making here I
[1:54:35] know we lived up in the panhandle of
[1:54:37] Florida and we watched that ourselves we
[1:54:39] we lived there for 21 years right a
[1:54:41] couple of miles off the coast those
[1:54:44] hurricanes would be barreling up the the
[1:54:47] Gulf there right towards us and the
[1:54:50] weather prophets were all glued to the
[1:54:52] radio and we're listening and they're
[1:54:53] telling us where it's gonna hit and
[1:54:55] we're moving an inch to the left or an
[1:54:56] inch to the right trying to get out of
[1:54:58] the way and the thing that would always
[1:55:02] either turn them to the left or the
[1:55:04] right was another storm way back over
[1:55:06] here somewhere another a higher wind it
[1:55:09] takes a higher wind to turn that storm
[1:55:15] it takes a higher wind to turn the store
[1:55:20] and you know we we always wanted to
[1:55:22] think ourselves very spiritual let me
[1:55:23] show you how spiritual we were for all
[1:55:25] those years we would sit there in
[1:55:27] Navarre we lived right out on the coast
[1:55:29] not for not just a few miles off of the
[1:55:31] coast and we'd sit there and those
[1:55:32] storms would be coming up they'd be
[1:55:35] coming up the Gulf and they'd be racing
[1:55:37] right towards us and we'd all be praying
[1:55:38] Lord turn that devil away from us
[1:55:41] and we'd be holding on because we didn't
[1:55:43] want our fences to blow down and a
[1:55:45] rooster be gone we didn't want it and
[1:55:49] we'd be praying and we'd be we was sure
[1:55:52] it was of the devil
[1:55:53] well everybody be saying turn that turn
[1:55:56] that devil away from us well I remember
[1:55:58] one year it turned and it went in over
[1:56:01] in New Orleans remember the big woman
[1:56:02] went in you know what everybody was
[1:56:04] saying that was God judge in New Orleans
[1:56:06] for all that filth and sodomy the same
[1:56:09] folks that was turning the devil just
[1:56:11] before was now saying it was of the Lord
[1:56:14] the same storm
[1:56:16] we're not spiritual at all we're
[1:56:19] situational Christians and I only bring
[1:56:24] that up for this point whenever you see
[1:56:27] a brother or sister struggling or having
[1:56:28] a battle or a fight we always want to be
[1:56:32] the first ones to race to the front of
[1:56:33] the class say I know why it's happened
[1:56:35] to ma'am
[1:56:36] he must be doing something wrong you
[1:56:39] gotta have something wrong in his life
[1:56:41] and not knowing that it could be the
[1:56:44] tender handed Jehovah leaning a little
[1:56:48] bit closer at the atrocities that was
[1:56:54] taken out on the Jewish people and have
[1:56:57] a prophet come along in our day and tell
[1:56:59] us that that was the tender hand of Joe
[1:57:02] leading them back to the promised land
[1:57:07] you're not gonna find that on a
[1:57:09] holocaust memorial wall because of the
[1:57:13] atrocity the look of it the atrocity of
[1:57:15] it the the apparent but in the mind of
[1:57:19] God he he's the one in fact the Prophet
[1:57:22] goes on to tell us it takes a higher
[1:57:25] wind to turn that storm and we all know
[1:57:28] that we've got an oncoming storm and the
[1:57:30] only wind that I know that can turn that
[1:57:33] storm will be the rushing wind that fell
[1:57:35] on the day of a rushing mighty wind is
[1:57:40] an answer to that storm that's coming
[1:57:43] your way it goes on talking about
[1:57:47] communism it takes a higher wind it
[1:57:50] takes a higher storm a greater wind to
[1:57:54] turn and this is what Paul found in his
[1:57:57] day they they the men let loosen that in
[1:58:00] that journey they suppose they had found
[1:58:03] their purpose but God brought in a
[1:58:08] higher wind called you Rock LaDonna when
[1:58:12] you see your brother or your sister what
[1:58:14] kind of instructions that we've been
[1:58:16] given I know this sounds so simple and
[1:58:17] plain but what kind of instructions have
[1:58:20] we been given through the word and
[1:58:22] through this message but when you see a
[1:58:24] brother or a sister struggling beat down
[1:58:28] beat up battered and bruised and tired
[1:58:32] don't rush to the head of the class and
[1:58:34] declare I know why that happened don't
[1:58:38] be the first to don't push him under it
[1:58:41] was the instructions we were given don't
[1:58:43] take a stick and try to push him under
[1:58:45] give him a helping hand and lifting back
[1:58:48] helping through that journey it could be
[1:58:53] a storm that's in his life that's come
[1:58:55] his way that he's fighting we all want
[1:59:03] we'd all want that rapture and faith we
[1:59:07] all want faith to move a mountain we
[1:59:08] want faith to move a tree I want to have
[1:59:11] faith for you and i for my beleaguered
[1:59:13] and beat-up brother you know I'm gonna
[1:59:16] stand with our prophet in one state but
[1:59:18] he said if you tell me you're a
[1:59:19] Christian I'm gonna believe that I'm
[1:59:21] gonna accept that but he said I'm gonna
[1:59:24] watch for the word to keep growing in
[1:59:26] your life and feeding you and bringing
[1:59:29] you along the way I'll tell you brothers
[1:59:32] and sisters we've got an oncoming storm
[1:59:34] there is another we have an area of time
[1:59:37] ahead of us we hear the atrocities of it
[1:59:41] we read about what it looks like it
[1:59:42] could be closing up the buildings
[1:59:45] shutting down our sanctuaries us meeting
[1:59:48] in our homes a time of pressure a time
[1:59:52] of the mark of the beast the squeeze the
[1:59:55] pressure that's gonna come on the church
[1:59:57] if you go back and look almost every
[2:00:00] time the prophet referred to those
[2:00:02] oncoming storm this pressure that the
[2:00:04] church would be under he always had a
[2:00:06] little caveat right there at the end you
[2:00:09] know what it was watch that third pull
[2:00:11] then when you see this happening when
[2:00:13] you see this happening what you see
[2:00:15] manifested temporarily will be
[2:00:18] manifested in this fullness then watch
[2:00:21] it then watch it win when that storm is
[2:00:23] on when the pressure is on when the
[2:00:25] trust stress is on when the tribulations
[2:00:27] is on trouble is we got folks running
[2:00:30] around now trying to manifest it before
[2:00:32] the time we had a felon in Florida there
[2:00:36] what time he came over from Alabama and
[2:00:38] he was visiting us and we had foot
[2:00:39] washing that night and it was pouring
[2:00:41] down buckets I mean one of the biggest
[2:00:44] rain storms you could ever been in and
[2:00:46] and he took it upon himself to almost
[2:00:48] announced to us that he was going
[2:00:50] outside because our sisters had to go
[2:00:52] out of the church building and go over
[2:00:53] to a fellowship hall for foot washing
[2:00:56] and he pretty well let us know that he
[2:00:58] was going to go out there and stop that
[2:01:00] storm for these
[2:01:01] so they could pass in safety so we all
[2:01:04] were all peeking through the windows we
[2:01:06] want to see what this fellas doing he's
[2:01:07] shaking this fist and he's been you know
[2:01:10] what he got out of it that night very
[2:01:12] wet
[2:01:12] what you got wet it's not something
[2:01:19] we're gonna be able to think or
[2:01:20] manufacture or fabricate it's when that
[2:01:24] pressure comes something's gonna come
[2:01:27] back to you then what you see manifested
[2:01:31] temporarily will show itself English
[2:01:34] noticing you're not gonna need to
[2:01:37] announce its residency in your life you
[2:01:42] don't need have time to call it brother
[2:01:44] Jack say you're knocking I gotta need me
[2:01:46] to do this you're just gonna speak and
[2:01:49] it's gonna I believe it I believe that's
[2:01:55] the kind of power that rests in this
[2:01:57] church but sometimes it takes those you
[2:02:00] Rockland odds to manifest sometimes it
[2:02:04] takes those pressures it takes those
[2:02:07] tribulations sometimes we have the word
[2:02:10] of a prophet that tells us a man will
[2:02:12] come into your church and he'll sit
[2:02:13] under the meekness and the quietness and
[2:02:16] then you'll begin to shoot that poison
[2:02:18] stuff I tell you we've already been told
[2:02:22] they'll be able to drink anything deadly
[2:02:23] thing and it won't harm them I'm not
[2:02:26] worried about that poison
[2:02:28] [Music]
[2:02:31] we're looking for a show of rapturing
[2:02:34] faith we're not looking for a show of
[2:02:36] third pulp our looking for to to learn
[2:02:39] of it now to taste of it now to witness
[2:02:42] of it now to know what it is and in its
[2:02:46] time in this season it will be there man
[2:02:50] nobody may even know about it but you I
[2:02:52] know the biggest thing in my years are
[2:02:54] growing up in the message the pastor we
[2:02:56] had it's all he ever talked about it
[2:02:57] just can't wait for the day when I speak
[2:02:59] food on the table it's a promise I
[2:03:03] believe it if your family needs food and
[2:03:05] you can't buy or sell and the mark of
[2:03:07] the beast is on I believe that I believe
[2:03:09] the privilege of that will be there if
[2:03:11] that's what God's portion for you is but
[2:03:14] I ask my own family and our church at
[2:03:16] home there one time I said let's just
[2:03:18] suppose that there is no food and God
[2:03:20] just don't let you get hungry she's not
[2:03:25] as supernatural is it I know I know
[2:03:30] there's something about Daniel going on
[2:03:31] around here now this he was explaining
[2:03:33] it to me as he explained it I was glad I
[2:03:37] lived in Wichita but I admire y'all for
[2:03:41] people to do that I was shared with him
[2:03:44] some things that brother Brown said
[2:03:45] about Daniel during that time he
[2:03:47] wouldn't eat of the Kings meat he didn't
[2:03:49] want the finer things he wanted a pulse
[2:03:51] right that's all he wanted to eat you
[2:03:53] know what the Prophet said he got fatter
[2:03:55] than all the rest on following what was
[2:04:01] in his heart to do it
[2:04:02] we're away he said if one place he said
[2:04:06] the buttons was popping off of his robe
[2:04:13] don't you see brothers and sisters we
[2:04:15] serve a mighty we it's just we got to
[2:04:19] stop figuring out how he's gonna do it
[2:04:22] that's that's always been our trouble
[2:04:24] Lord how I want to get saved how am I
[2:04:27] gonna do well we had so many preachers
[2:04:28] you gotta come down an altar you got a
[2:04:30] you got to do this you got to do that
[2:04:32] you got it
[2:04:33] you got you know there's no there's no
[2:04:36] formula there is no pattern there is no
[2:04:41] certain way that everybody has to come
[2:04:44] there is one way and that's through the
[2:04:45] blood of Jesus Christ but we were taught
[2:04:49] through our Pentecostal years that you
[2:04:50] got to come to an altar you got to do
[2:04:52] this and we we help people remember is
[2:04:55] helping people speak in tongues we help
[2:04:57] people you know I've been through all
[2:05:00] this yeah I've been kneeling down in an
[2:05:03] altar now got one fell on one side of me
[2:05:05] yelling in my ear hang on hang on hang
[2:05:08] on hang on I got another down this side
[2:05:11] he's hollering turn loose turn loose
[2:05:13] turn loose
[2:05:14] give up one guys want me to hang on the
[2:05:18] other guys want me to turn loose how can
[2:05:22] I do both it's because of traditions we
[2:05:27] have traditions made up our minds if I
[2:05:30] have a grievance with with youth camps
[2:05:36] youth camps have to go through the same
[2:05:39] scenario every year I actually stood in
[2:05:42] a youth camp in Ohio I used to preach
[2:05:44] him and I stood in the youth camp under
[2:05:46] a tent before meeting one night and it
[2:05:48] was a Thursday night usually the the big
[2:05:50] the big
[2:05:52] the climax is the last night I actually
[2:05:55] stood there and the brother that was
[2:05:57] going to be preaching that night asked
[2:05:58] the host pastor a question and I've
[2:06:00] never hardly felt more offended by
[2:06:04] hearing that then I hear in this
[2:06:05] question he asked me says do you want
[2:06:07] the climax to be tonight or do you want
[2:06:10] to wait until Saturday night when
[2:06:13] another brother is preaching I walked
[2:06:17] away I couldn't even fathom a question
[2:06:20] like that
[2:06:21] what is his climax in his mind is his
[2:06:24] ability to stir and drum up and and
[2:06:28] build an emotion or a crescendo I walked
[2:06:33] away in my heart and I said God why
[2:06:35] don't you decide what night why don't
[2:06:39] you pick the night that you want the
[2:06:42] climax of the meeting to be sometimes
[2:06:47] we've done churched ourselves so long
[2:06:49] we've we've lost sight of what God wants
[2:06:54] God leads his dear children some through
[2:06:59] the waters some through the flood some
[2:07:02] through the fire but all through the
[2:07:04] blood don't ever let anybody else short
[2:07:08] change your path of life I know brother
[2:07:11] Moore sunburn a dear friend of mine
[2:07:13] I still go by what's with the remnants
[2:07:15] of his little church there Memphis when
[2:07:16] I go and one thing the Prophet told him
[2:07:19] he was kindly lamenting he didn't do
[2:07:21] this in his life brother Brad said never
[2:07:23] look back on your life and be
[2:07:24] disappointed at what God led you through
[2:07:27] he brought you through it he taught you
[2:07:31] a lesson through it
[2:07:32] don't ever grumble and moan and complain
[2:07:34] about this happened or that happen every
[2:07:37] one of them was a life lesson for you
[2:07:40] just come out on the other what would I
[2:07:42] have done things different now that sure
[2:07:45] we all we can't help but being human
[2:07:47] I've had brothers say things to me in my
[2:07:49] young days of the ministry that I didn't
[2:07:51] have an answer for I wish they would
[2:07:53] come and ask me now I've learned a
[2:07:55] little better answer than what I had
[2:07:57] back then but I'm saying to you brothers
[2:08:00] and sisters God leads us and in the time
[2:08:03] when this when that storm is coming
[2:08:05] against us
[2:08:06] the answer to it will be there one thing
[2:08:13] about about this storm that hit the ship
[2:08:17] the Yurok Ladon when it came his way and
[2:08:20] I'm almost done let's have a musicians
[2:08:22] come several musicians come as they will
[2:08:25] when you rock Ladon hit that boat if you
[2:08:28] go back to the book of Acts you'll find
[2:08:30] there that you know there was 276 people
[2:08:34] on the boat how many of you knew that
[2:08:36] 276 people and the scripture accords for
[2:08:39] us that all hope was gone
[2:08:44] that means Paul was the only one among
[2:08:47] them there wasn't nobody else on the
[2:08:50] boat thought they were gonna get out of
[2:08:51] it except Paul and he came down and he
[2:08:55] stood in the face of those other 275 men
[2:08:58] I mean if you go back and read the
[2:09:00] history of it they were trying to jump
[2:09:01] out of the boat and they were letting
[2:09:03] down the life rafts trying to get away
[2:09:05] Paul told the Centurion said if these
[2:09:08] guys get off of the boat we're all gonna
[2:09:09] be lost we're all supposed to hang on
[2:09:11] we're gonna hit up on this island over
[2:09:13] here of course when Paul walked ashore
[2:09:16] unharmed everybody thought he was it he
[2:09:19] was of the devil you know that they
[2:09:22] thought he was a demon that come among
[2:09:24] them how could a man live through a
[2:09:25] storm like that he's out picking up some
[2:09:28] sticks for the fire and the snake bit
[2:09:29] his hand and they thought he was of God
[2:09:30] must be a god that's what I'm telling
[2:09:35] you about being spiritual and knowing
[2:09:36] wouldn't which way the winds blowing not
[2:09:38] always doing though you can't base it on
[2:09:41] what you see but here they came though
[2:09:43] it says all hope all hope was gone all
[2:09:50] hope the storm was that aggressive 14
[2:09:54] days and 14 nights I think it blew no
[2:09:57] stars no Sun just nothing but soon it
[2:10:01] was called you rock LaDonna you know the
[2:10:04] trouble with most storms that we face in
[2:10:06] our life is we even take time to name
[2:10:08] them I tried to get to that point
[2:10:11] earlier we try to name them this is
[2:10:13] what's wrong with me that's what's wrong
[2:10:15] with me try to put a handle on it put a
[2:10:17] name on it
[2:10:18] if I had more money this wouldn't happen
[2:10:20] if I had more prestige that wouldn't
[2:10:22] happen if I had a better car this
[2:10:23] wouldn't happen if I God leads his dear
[2:10:26] children mommy we try to put a name on
[2:10:30] it we won't identified rather than look
[2:10:33] to the deliverer in the midst of the
[2:10:36] storm quit trying to name your troubles
[2:10:41] don't try to put a name on it might find
[2:10:46] you it's like I said he might be
[2:10:47] throwing a brother or sisters name on
[2:10:49] there she's the problem he's the
[2:10:50] pastor's the problem tragically too many
[2:10:53] churches have their pastor for lunch
[2:10:55] when they go and I don't mean over for
[2:10:58] fried chicken either I mean they they
[2:11:00] having for lunch when they get home on
[2:11:01] Sunday if he comes up limping next week
[2:11:08] you know somebody did a big bite out
[2:11:10] he's just a man too all hope was gone
[2:11:20] you know what Paul came down he said I
[2:11:21] got one thing to tell you be of good
[2:11:24] cheer how can you be of good cheer in
[2:11:27] that kind of a storm because he said as
[2:11:29] long as we all remain ship I must go to
[2:11:33] Rome you're riding with a man that's got
[2:11:36] a his journey mapped out
[2:11:39] I must go before Caesar as long as you
[2:11:43] stay in the boat there gonna be no lives
[2:11:45] lost be of good cheer you know the first
[2:11:48] time that God told him he was going to
[2:11:50] Rome you know what the very words the
[2:11:51] angel told him two years before that
[2:11:53] Paul be of good cheer because you must
[2:11:57] go before Caesar he told him that two
[2:11:59] years before this this accident happened
[2:12:02] with the boat and there's Paul
[2:12:03] rehearsing those same words to be of
[2:12:06] good cheer when the storms come when the
[2:12:10] raging seas around about you just hang
[2:12:13] on because he is the master of the
[2:12:20] let's stand to sing that together I know
[2:12:21] the master of the wind do you know the
[2:12:24] master of the wind
[2:12:25] you rock Ladon Yurok LaDonna

[2:12:35] this one printed out but I I wanted to
[2:12:38] read it to you this morning listen to
[2:12:39] this
[2:12:44] sometimes it takes a beatin to get us in
[2:12:46] shape you know that you remember a guy
[2:12:49] named six-second Smith you remember the
[2:12:51] Prophet Tom at six seconds men he said
[2:12:54] not straining for fighting they said
[2:13:01] he'd always tell me it's for good
[2:13:06] and feel good but he said when you take
[2:13:08] that hit and are able to get back up

[2:19:14] so grateful today for this message for
[2:19:19] my precious brother Tom Ernest just a
[2:19:23] lot lot lot was safe I believe and God
[2:19:26] knows exactly what his people is
[2:19:29] and as we have just coming to speak
[2:19:32] directly to our penis I love that
[2:19:35] scripture of south wind acts 27 13 when
[2:19:38] the south wind blew softly supposing and
[2:19:43] they have obtained that purpose losing
[2:19:45] this this up close by Creek just really
[2:19:48] really beautiful thought just to think
[2:19:50] you know sometimes we go through things
[2:19:51] in life and we're thinking that that's
[2:19:54] exactly where God since a man but God
[2:19:57] allows a little storm to come and our
[2:19:59] life to show us that now I got somewhere
[2:20:01] else for you to go
[2:20:03] you know we we got our own bow back see
[2:20:07] that I was listening to her brother Tom
[2:20:10] put that II think he called it a rock
[2:20:12] laDawn right I guess that's that's
[2:20:15] that's that's how it is in the state so
[2:20:19] coming from Wichita is using your rocket
[2:20:21] down and we sing you rope light on right
[2:20:24] but it's nonetheless it's still the same
[2:20:26] storm right
[2:20:28] you know the thing of it is is that God
[2:20:30] allowed some stink but I was thinking to
[2:20:31] myself we got all personal we have to
[2:20:36] come to church and have to do even if
[2:20:38] some of the things that we enjoy but

[2:29:58] something now you might as well get
[2:30:00] ready because something is on the way a
[2:30:01] man and the song said if you're not
[2:30:04] anchored in Jesus then you drift away
[2:30:10] man my salvation is not in my job my
[2:30:14] salvation is not in my house my
[2:30:17] salvation is not in my car but my
[2:30:20] salvation is found in the blood of the
[2:30:22] Lord Jesus a man so come what will come
[2:30:25] with me it's not changing my testimony I
[2:30:28] can still say Lord I love you in the
[2:30:31] midst of whatever I'm facing praise the
[2:30:34] Lord Amen let's talk word of Prayer man
[2:30:37] and we'll prepare to let you be
[2:30:39] dismissed today father we're so grateful
[2:30:41] for the word that has come here to us
[2:30:45] Lord and just talking on the subject of
[2:30:48] purpose then God as we just look at that
[2:30:50] supposing that they had if they had they
[2:30:54] have found their purpose they suppose
[2:30:55] that's oftentimes we we may feel that
[2:30:58] way but God you I just reminded of my
[2:31:00] own life and I thought I had my purpose
[2:31:03] on a particular job thank God to send
[2:31:06] the storm to move me off that job and I
[2:31:08] went to the next job and I thought I
[2:31:10] found my purpose again but you allowed
[2:31:12] another storm to come or to move me off
[2:31:14] that job and God you brought me a man
