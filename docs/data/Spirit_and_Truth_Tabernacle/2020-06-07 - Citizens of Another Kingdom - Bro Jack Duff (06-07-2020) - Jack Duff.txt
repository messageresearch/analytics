[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] a couple of things that we just need to take care of here and just look at be back in the house of God just like going to church like worship but I like worshiping with wrong man it's good just to be here and you know there's there's places where they they can't even meet we're grateful that God has given us this just wonderful opportunity to meet and the other thing that you know I was mentioning that we just want to come and take take things slow as they've been opening up our County there's been more cases reported of people you know coming down with this virus and you know one of the things that I've realized is that as we go back into the workplace there's opportunity for us to be exposed even more to you know somebody else that may have been sick or getting sick we need God's protection we need God's protection so I thank God that I he has thus far protected all of us and you know every person that had to take a test has come back negative and we just were grateful for that and so God is God is real good and my prayer is that not one of us will you know have a problem I was approached this week by somebody a man relative of mine and they were saying are you all going to church I'm like yes we are how about going to church and this is we - just tell me what y'all doing with the mask and everything a yellow wearing masks are not wearing master say well yes we do wear masks we do wear masks and say now we don't make it mandatory that everybody have to wear masks but we we are wearing them a man for you know safety reasons and they say well praise the Lord because you know where where I'm going everybody looking at me funny because I wear a mask I say well no I don't look at you funny because you're wearing a mask I say the way I see a mask is I like to ask a question how many left home this morning they left they front door unlocked [Music] I mean it just you got that nice constant night there in the parking lot did you leave it unlocked with somebody just to drive away what about leaving a lock and leave a key in it we don't do that right it's just these are what we call just you know these are things that's just common sense right so I don't think it's a it's a lack of faith if you lock your front door there's not a lack of faith if you don't leave the key in the ignition for somebody to take don't right so so mask is just like that it's not it's not a thing of faith at all that's not it's not it's not faith at all I mean it's just something that they asked us to do so we're doing what they asked us to do and if Christians can't do what the government is actually doing something wrong with our Christian experience should not be the ones that's been rebellious question she would say yes we'll do that so I'm told say if you if they laugh at you but you had you got a place you can come alright I got some things I'm supposed to say you know let me get the announcements and and then I want to go I got to give you all a quick update on our building from the praise our Lord we get wishes our happy birthday the sister Mary man

Beach Kerala we haven't been released it's really go phase two and what phase two is it allows us to get more than the supposed to be maybe fifty with social distancing we kind of split down the center of that and try to get it about thirty with social distancing and and and thus far that's been successful but it is my desire that we'll all be able to come back together as one you know soon

amen amen praise the Lord as we just kind of turn our attention here have a just a update on [Music] building fire amen and I'm grateful and happy to announce we're still moving in a positive direction a man what this is showing Amen if you just hit that light switch there for my brother thank you very much this first column is showing what our goal was for this year is to raise a hundred and five thousand dollars for 2020 and the pledges that came in towards that goal was sixty thousand nine dollars amen towards that goal and received as of June seventh Amen 2020 is fifteen thousand one hundred forty-five dollars in nine cent praise God thank God for that I mean last last month we received ten thousand three hundred seventy-five dollars amen and and then on top of the the total

needs and I tell you he's been real to us a man I'm grateful I'm grateful I mean you can turn that back on better quick thank you so thank you musicians I appreciate you all I was listening to a song the struggle is over this week I just happened to click on a link and and we were there in North Carolina at a meeting and and you know that song at the end of the sermon I began to sing that and just a real sweet anointing came underneath the tent you know and and and well as I was going back through the video I I was looking at brother Solomon sits in the Oh me and brother Colima a man and proclaim me he blessed me that service I've never forget him I never forgiven my preaching and he was yelling at me you know from the from the from the from the audience I think I said something about I'm just leave that right there I'm gonna come back to church and I just appreciate it but you know I was just going back in a just you know we as 2013 and my mind just began to replay and look in seven years later amen brother Solomon and sister Naomi and just marry a man then being here with us for these paths I I would say must was in 2013 you all made the transition a 2014 so I mean God been good in six years [Music] since years we've done some some mighty things and and I'm gonna just let y'all know y'all ain't seen nothing yet right so we just under expectation a man for for some really really great testimonies and men to come forth even more than what God has done but but that that song the struggle is over a man it's over and you got to declare that over yourself and a man and my finances the struggle is over in my body the struggle is over me and my family the struggle is over I am fighting with the devil no more it's it's over it's over you got to see yourself already walking in victory praise the Lord a man so we just we just think God for all things I want to read a scripture here out of the book of John this morning John 18 and God is so good it seems like we for those that have joined us online I do want to just mention this we for weeks we have not had our neighboring churches here and this week they have joined us and we thank God for them being able to open up their doors and worship again but sometimes their music amen will bleed over into our service of you if you hear that online just bear with us this is why we believe in God for a new church a new school and we're not trying to shut them down we need more churches we shut down boss we pray for laws to shut down but not churches so but we just want a little bit more space where we can kind of worship and freedom and not necessarily have to worry about you know of bleeding over like that so just be praying be praying with us a man if you desire to give towards that and amen we will accept any nations towards that as well so if you hear that they may hear some other music or something like that just bear with us a man you can get into a channel where all you can hear is the Word of God and we want to encourage you to do that on today John 18 and actually I want to start up a little earlier from that I start at verse 28 a man if we can praise the Lord so much is happening a man so much has happened and I have been getting so many phone calls with all the events that have transpired here through this week and I just felt it would be appropriate to just kind of give an appropriate response to to everything that is that has happened a Christians response that's if that's okay and let's just let's just read a man from Scripture John 18 verse 20 then led they Jesus from Caiaphas so the whole of judgment and it was early and they themselves went not into the judgment Hall lest they should be defiled but that they might eat the Passover Pilate then went out unto them and said what accusation bring ye against this man they answered and said unto him if he were not malefactor we would not have delivered him unto thee you can see they saying with an attitude right then said Pilate unto them taking him and judge him according to your law the Jews therefore said to him it is not lawful for us to put any man today right so their law would not even because they had thou shalt not kill right they they couldn't even with their love put into death but they had to deliver him over to the government if we can put it that way at this time amen in order to kill Jesus the Roman government had to kill him for them right that the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled which he spake signifying the death he should die then Pilate entered into the judgment Hall again and said and called Jesus and said unto Him art thou the King of the Jews jesus answered him says thou this thing of thyself or did others tell it thee of me Pilate answered mi-joo vynil nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me what has thou done and I love this response from Jesus jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight can I read that again jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hence a man Pilate therefore said unto Him art thou a king then what you're trying to say right Arthur king then jesus answered thou says that I am a king to this end was I born for this car came out into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice right all right all right all right let's just have a quick word of Prayer a man over this Father we thank you for the word of the Lord that has been raining down our prayer today is that you would just help us to apply what we are what we are reading and what we're hearing lord help us to hear your voice that you got would just take control of our time here together you'll be magnified and exalted in this place blessed Lord every ear that is here present those that are joining us online and God bless those ear to hear what the Spirit is trying to say is in Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you you can be seated so I I had another scripture I think i'ma save it to later out of first samuel for I thought it was very divine if I can use that word that the thought that I wanted to kind of present today reconnected with something that I shared last year and and the scripture reading during this week actually I think the scripture reading for yesterday I'm a daily Bible reading it connected with all of it and now we were reading from first Samuel 24 so I'll save that for later but I want to just title this sermon citizens of another Kingdom a man we are citizens of another Kingdom let's look at a man a quote from the questions and answers part to play man there there's a statement a couple statements that it makes here we want to just look at them this first quote here says here as I've often said I believe in the church here there's a role here like and here lives mortal beings and each one is in this great conglomeration of gaiety of blackness and darkness mortals live in here he says now they are influenced from this away or from that way hallelujah your influence comes from one or two directions either your influence is coming from heaven or your fluence is coming from Hell a man there is no in-between either either spirit from heavens actually a man determined where the influence is coming from come on somebody another Kingdom he says you can be here if you influence from here your from above I like this if your influence from from here Amen you from you are from above get that now if your influence from here that means you are fallible that means you came from God and you going back to God hallelujah you are citizen of another Kingdom your actions are different than everybody else [Music] [Music] [Applause] you're up here [Music] do you understand profit looks at things a lot deeper than everybody else profit is not moved by emotions by feelings hey he just gives us the word and you know and and that's what I that's what I want to be I don't want to be moved by emotions my feelings I just want to be on the word praise the Lord that's what that's what that's what pleases God how we how we lay hold to the work I tell you I think this is a time if ever there was a time for Christians to actually shine the light this is the perfect time for Christians Christians to shine the light and let me take something already people know you're Christian by the way some of some of us dress they can tell you no man you do different I'm sister you different because of what you dress and if you're dressing a man helps people realize that there's something different about you your actions should also help people to realize that there's something different about you amen oh my god amen shoo jr. - true genuine Christians it goes to be on our dress now it's our actions praise the Lord alright I'm going on a little further and some some some other quotes here oh my see I got to do this because I'll be there I lose track of time so y'all that first one was free and and then I'm assessed imma set the timer right now so then you know praise the Lord alright let's go to oneness of unity hey man don't count that don't count that against my time alright the wonders of unity just recently I could feel the spirit in the meeting and you are who are sending your letters in as an apology of the first night or two to believe that it was some kind of mental setup and now you're convinced should I forgive you God does too and the Lord bless you certainly it says now when the meeting going on evil spirit in the meeting that spirit is almost harmless evil spirit is actually harmless until it can catch somebody that it can work through evil spirit is harmless somebody down the standard [Music] I lose somebody so we gotta watch it coming from this one it's coming from underneath now which world is just there Jesus died for we we just eat does he just even in that one quarter just kind of gave us three worlds she said underworld an above world and then we're in this great kendama conglomeration of blackness three different worlds right there in that one cool so which world of Jesus represented when he said when it says my if if if my if my when it says my kingdom is not of this world which one was he talking about I can guarantee you it wasn't underneath we got to you know let's go he says an evil spirit in the meeting that spirit is almost harmless until it can catch somebody that it can work through then when it can work through in a certainly do damage because it's an evil spirit and the Holy Spirit is here trying to find somebody and when it finds somebody to work it can't do good see the two spirits their motives objectives watch out is watch their works watch their fruits then you can see what spirit on you watch their fruits then you can see what spirit is on you you are motivated let's get motivated to spirit your debt and if you have a spirit it motivates your life and if your life bears the fruit of a Christian it's a Christian spirit amen now you maybe feel now watch this evil spirit when he goes out he walks him dry places hunting a place to find rest the Bible said he could not father sir says I will return back to where I come out of now God could have delivered you from something at some point in time of your life a man God can deliver you from some really really evil thoughts towards other races a man God could have set you free from that but the devil has a way of bringing that saying right back around and he will anoint you oh that evil spirit let's say I'm gonna go back and this time when he comes back he come back with seven other spirits and now you're worse than you ever was a man if God has set you free from sin that stuff you better stay free from it glory to God Church look at this he says I will return back to where I come from come out of he goes back to this person that he was once in and he founds the house all swept cleaned up sanctify all condemnation gone oh just a real happy believer but it's empty and he said come here seven other spirits worse than he was will you please try to get this the Bible said that's the truth Jesus said it's the truth and it comes back to this house a man who has confessed Christ to be his Savior has got rid of his wickedness has quit his drinking quit his smoke him his his feeling he has become sanctified cleaned out his house is all sweat he feels free so he comes back in he finds a house then he goes in and gets seven other spirits worse than he was and comes into this person and the Bible said the last estate of the man is seven times worse than it was at the beginning so we got to just be careful we don't know how the enemy is trying to move now I want to just inject a little something here I'm going back to that message questions and answers part two and I'm going to paragraph 145 let me just let me just before I bring that up I want I want to say something when you see something with your eyes you can't unsee it when you hear something with your ears you cannot unhear it you can't act like I never heard that before you heard it and when you see something with your eyes you cannot unsee it that thing is with you I mean for the rest of your life if a young man I'm going to some other areas here if a young man gets involved with pornography at a young age he can't unsee the stuff that he saw hallelujah that stuff would stay with him even though he's a Christian the devil will bring those thoughts right back to his mind if a young lady does it that stuff stays with you in your mind for the rest of your life even though you converted hallelujah now I'm saying that to say this because nowadays as these different videos are floating around the internet there's some stuff you don't need to see because once you see it you can't unsee it and once it gets into your spirit it begins to do things in you it awakens things in you that you thought was P I'm just passing through look at what the Prophet says here in this message questions and answers part 2 says I think a good little thing you ought to set around on your desk it's a little thing I seen down in Florida brother branham saw it in Florida a little thing I've seen down in Florida not long ago it was three little monkeys and one of them had his hands over his eyes and said see no evil the other one had his fingers in his ears and said hear no evil and the other one had his hand over his mouth and said sorry no I'm not going and I will not speak just keep your mind pure and on Christ you can't just say well now they see if you don't watch you'll get yourself over into a place if you keep oh they did that right and now and don't don't think you can't live so perfect till you don't make that mistake right now don't you think you'll ever get that way cuz you won't no sir you're not sinless and you'll certainly get up on their track on this side on that side I love the old song be careful who lives what you see be careful little eyes what to see for the father up above is looking down below be careful arrives what you see they had another verse be careful little feet where you go be careful little feet where you go for the father up above is looking down below be careful little feet where you go be careful near the mouth what you say be careful little mouth what you say for the father up above is looking down below be careful little mouth what you say [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the Holy Ghost is what controls us a man now look at this the Prophet makes his statement and the message questions and answers says but a man this is paragraph 147 I don't know if I wrote this one down or not okay all right he said but a man that's once knocked down if he's a real soldier he'll rise up again Lord let me rise and try it again but a coward as soon as he makes his first little mistake he's like I said it's one in the bug and the water spider will crawl right back in the water again see he just king's standing so refused all the ol that that profane babbling and carrying on talking babbling means confusion so the Prophet said you got to refuse and the Bible say avoid profane tablets and brother branham say it babblings is confusion if we're not living in a time where people are so confused it's a shame you know I mean I somebody called I got so many calls this weekend you know I'm just trying to understand this trying to understand and I said I'm probably the wrong person to ask you know I say because a lot of things I don't understand and a lot of things I actually I actually feel different about it then then what other people feel about and I say really to me you know government is not the answer ain't no ain't no president gonna be able to get this song huh hey man I don't care how much people post that ain't gonna solve it what are all the things that they do that's not gonna solve the problem it brings awareness to it but it don't solve it [Music] [Applause] [Music] change your heart hallelujah that's my sauce you need Christ we all need Christ a man the murderer needs Christ Jesus I'm telling a real solution he says so refuse all that profane babbling and carrying on talking Babylon means confusion and the Bible said mark those who cause contentious among you if somebody said uh-huh uh-huh now just say how do you do I'm glad to see you again thank you just keep on going that's the best thing I said don't shun them but just mark them don't show them just mark them watch it because they influenced by another spirit the spirit coming from the underworld a man he said just marked him don't pay any attention because you see what it leads to hey man now I got a little quote here that I wanna read let's see how far we can go going as far as we can he says and before I read this is coming out of the voice of God in the last day I want to just say this your your political position can't bring you in direct opposition of the word revealed truth of a vindicated prophet imma say that again your political position can bring you in direct opposition of the word reveal truth of a vindicated prophet now I say this even his opinions were things we should take note of even if he just had an opinion about it it was things that we should take note of I've seen people actually say that the Prophet was wrong about certain things that he said from a political standpoint I'm gonna have to have y'all read between the lines there's some quotes at down some political things a man that kind of shakes some people but even even his opinion you better be watching his opinion because when a prophet is speaking he's not talking naturally he's always talking spiritually and if you can't catch things about a spiritual rim you're gonna always miss it hey man you're gonna always miss it praise the Lord Amen there we have have some really good leaders good inspirational people but we talk about a prophet vindicated by God hey man you can't you ain't got no you ain't got no no no no no mess on his life right you got you can pin on his life he ain't cheating on his wife and still prophesied hallelujah somebody run around the world and doing all kind of things amen this man came to bring God to the people so even his opinions meant something even if his opinion goes against your [Applause] brother this go beyond race this go way beyond race this message goes beyond man hallelujah I'm not a saint I talk different because of this word is the truth anyhow the word made me like this amen amen man Oh Lord let me just we we are a Christian Church now just that's that's what we are i'ma say that again we are a Christian Church [Music] so anybody actually what kind of search hello Christian search all right even his opinions with things that we should take note of he's not looking from the same lenses as everyone else so you know your political position can bring you in direct opposition of the world revealed truth of a vindicated prophet so even his opinions were things we should take note of he is not looking from the same lenses as everybody else amen and if you want to understand the Prophet you're gonna need spiritual insight to understand what a prophet is saying the voice of God is last days the Prophet says this and the sermon he says in the forces of God they say how will we know it is how how will we notice the voice of God because because for the day then it was then then it was in a vindicated prophet down today how we know in support of God because it's the manifestation of the prophets word this is God's prophet and a true voice of God only brings back that real living supernatural God with his supernatural world with the supernatural manifestation of the true word then we know that it's just the voice of God because that and there's so much other in other realms that's just almost dead in that out but remember it will glisten it'll come forth it'll do it so now there is a voice today in the world of politics that's a great voice he says that people absolutely and great day of politics it's all mixed up in their churches see politics get into the church I don't heard some things I can say something is more than something I heard this week I just want to blast it to smithereens but I'm just keeping myself in check some of the stuff I heard but see what happened we get politics mixed up in the church I'm gonna tell you III just kind of went back in my mind a man just kind of going through Scripture I couldn't think of one prophet actually I only knew one that got got intertwined with politics and his prophetic position most prophets in scripture a men are always separated from that not only not only they separated it's the prophets that actually get in trouble with the government right your lives you got in trouble with the government Elijah got in trouble with the government John the Baptist got in trouble with the government brother Branham had a tax case got in trouble with the government hello somebody there's only one prophet I know in Scripture that was actually representative both a man government and and also I had a spirit I mean he was a prophet as well and that was King David only one now you see a king dave was a prophet he prophesied in the songs he was a prophet amen but he was not like any light he was not like any like shut he was not like a John the Baptist right so I mean and even God had a reason for allowing David where both rose crowns like that hallelujah where he prophesied also was a king of the I mean because we got a soon coming King his name is Jesus and they was a pure representation of the life of Jesus Christ Oh hallelujah I'm getting to David a little bit he was in our Bible reading yesterday even even with that he still handled himself certain ways David handled himself like he was from another kingdom let me just try to read some quotes and i'ma let me finish this one he says the voice the voice of politics is actually stronger but then the voice of God in the churches right amen all the American people would have never did what they've just done see they'd have never done it if the voice of God would be kept alive in the church they'd have never made that mistakes but the voice of politics is so much stronger in the earth today than the voice of God until people saw their Christian birthright from Nessa popularity how many likes can I get a man and an old please they hold a profits level education against them you tell me what man with all the education they got was able to preach the things that he preached no nobody could even touch it couldn't even look at it nobody could go in there right and and so we're not looking for some educated genius that came live right praise the Lord we don't need that no don't bring that I'm sorry church ah I mean that's not what we stand for here we a man and if you knew anything about the Word of God you know that God called john the baptists out to the wilderness to at a very early age a prophet of God and not only just a prophet but a prophet uh prophets because he introduced the Messiah a man jesus said there had been nobody born of woman that was greater than John he only had a six month ministry and uneducated praise the Lord I mean when he preached he had to preach in symbols later acts at the root of the trees go tell that that that's neat you know I mean he used an old kind of language like he using wilderness language to get his message across God gave us a prophet with the same types and shadows and everything like you got to be spiritual to catch what this prophet is saying is out there in the land today and that's the force of God's alright the voice of politics so much stronger nerve to date in the voice of God until people saw their Christian birthright for a message popularity education and political power it's such a shame to see the very thing that our nation was made with what it's made on the people turn right back around and vote anything that we left the other country it says in the Plymouth Rock and Mayflower them come over here and establish this great economy that we have is the very thing we felt so hard to come out of we put ourselves right back in its clutches because the Bible speaks that it would be that way you know our purpose for even leaving some of the other countries reason this country was established with is because there was a freedom of religion and if you're not careful the spirit that's coming from the underworld is actually going to take your freedom of speech let's get ready to take it from you because if somebody does not agree so I'm going to put something out then you say something that you don't agree everybody will come for you and when they're coming for you what they've done and then make you apologize I gotta apologize because I don't agree I refuse to let you take my freedom of speech from me hey man I don't agree what you're seeing but I am apologizing for it you ain't apologizing I apologize praise the Lord any high man I mean you got a freedom to do what you want to do I got a freedom to say what I want to say I believe the Word of God I'm a citizen of another Kingdom yes but while I'm here I respect those that in authority all right you gotta worry about nothing for me now just serves we will see Jesus I'm coming in and I'm trying he says we're citizens not of Canada neither are we citizens of the United States our citizenship is above if we are citizens of the kingdom of God when I go into Germany I watch the way they do they have their own ideas I come down from one of the greatest meetings where we was having a a verge of 10,000 souls save each night 50,000 saved in five nights and then coming down the street here was the Saints with the great big schooners of beer drinking just as fast as they could drink the Saints praising the Lord as hard as they could you see well that's their custom in Germany see they don't pay any attention to it and so forth he says you find different traits in different nations Oh y'all got to catch that one because certain people respond based on their environment you understand if certain traits go with certain nations certain people identify with things a little faster than you do because they have seen this spirit before but was a spirit remember that different rates and different nations we find it in Canada find it in the United States but then when a Christian becomes a Christian he is no more a citizen of this world but we plainly know that we're Abraham's seed and Kiko confessed that he was a pilgrim and a stranger he was a citizen of another world hallelujah looking for a city whose builder and maker serves this just lost my place to looking for a city whose builder and maker was God so meet us see so we our citizenship is of above and above this holiness see we got an influence either coming from above coming from beneath and therefore we are citizens of the kingdom of God and as citizens of the kingdom let's look for our king first every 24 let's read this tell you what bring David right right back in this was a part of our Bible reading and yesterday you know sometimes you sit around you just just just Lord just give me something I just want to hear your voice and I hear so many voices around and this one that and they have this Lord I just need to hear your voice what is it that you are trying to say at a time like this what is it god I need to hear you and sometimes you can hear it it's still small voice just in the reading of his word and as I was reading on yesterday and it just blessed my heart I said lord I read this before and I remember you gave me some sermons on Christ and life of David and and and and we went right back and picked it up again I believe last year and we preached war strategies what's your war strategy you're gonna be facing some stuff you're gonna need a strategy yeah and you know y'all when I went through that whole series of water does that mean that I made a statement in there that there are times where your strategy got to be just shut your mouth and y'all know brother Diggs picked that up and came right back and prints it to y'all he said he got a new ministry he heard it here he was listening to the tape from here the YouTube video and he picked it up and carried around the world he say I got this new ministry that God gave me it's like it like a third Pole in my ministry it was such your mouth and you know what we need to exercise that ministry just don't say nothing ma'am just don't say nothing go silent and silent don't mean consent all right that's what the world is telling you the silent consent then Jesus was concerned what was was consenting when they were taking him to the cross because he remained silent praise the Lord and you want to talk about something that you really should be upset about why how did they know my Jesus to the cross he did nothing who took them outside and nailed him up there to across somebody needs to get upset and posted get mad make a t-shirt they kill Jesus praise the Lord Lord help me I'm not trying to diminish nothing but I'm trying to get the focus back on cry hey man lay man we're citizens of another Kingdom we act different we talk different we walk different David without the Holy Ghost look at how he acts here in 1st Samuel 24 verse 1 came to pass when Saul was returned from following the Philistines now understand before David got into situation David had he was already on the run from Saul Saul is just determined to kill him he tried to kill him while he was sleeping and his wife had to trick him and put a rock in the bed and all kind of stuff - you know that to get David out of the house and and then start lying but sorrow still determined to kill this man right and and here David refused to to have the same type of anger or the same type of feeling towards all he just kept dodging him he just kept running whatever he could do got to a little spot where God told him to go down into a certain City he said go down there and and and deliver those people the Philistines have come against him go down there and deliver those people and they went down there they fought for the people and and they celebrating this great victory from the Philistines and and Saul here you down here that David is down there and this in the city and and Saul wants to go down and get David after David just killed her Phyllis times again for right and here you know here David Davis down there so I was on the way down to get David and David praise the Lord will these people deliver me back into salt and he said yeah you better get out of here so the same people that he was celebrating with he's the same people that was getting ready to deliver him the song you gotta watch who you celebrate with right so here here here you celebrating with him and and a man and now now they're gonna deliver him a mentor saw that he say so you better get on out of there so David just going from mountain range to mountain range and around the mountain and through the through the fat go do everything he can to get away from stuff got so closer I think Salton was about compassing him but at the time that Saul finally got got got a hold of David God allowed to feel it's time to start raiding the area where Saul live and he had to leave his battle with David to go back down and try to protect the people from the Philistines God know how to do things if we just let God do it right so here he goes down he delivers the people but in his spirit he still wants to kill David and this is what we pick up here and first-ever twenty four and it came to pass see it seems people are known it from with spirits from underworld and you cannot fight spirits naturally Amen hallelujah we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers right so you know we got it we got to use spiritual weapons prayer is the greatest weapon that we can use prayer changes things amen listen and it came to pass when Stoll was a turn I need to try to read fast on this when it solves returned from following the Philistines that it was told him saying behold David is in the wilderness of India D then saw two three thousand chosen men out of all Israel went to seek David and his men and upon the rocks of the wild goats and it came to the Sheep coached by the way there was a cave and salt went in to cover his feet and David and his men remain in the size of the cave now they saw him come in may be had they had they had an opportunity to do some damage right here this and look at what happened and the men of David said unto Him boy they got excited their home the day with the Lord said look how they put the car all in this you know which the Lord said yea I say unto thee with the Lord fan to thee down hand that thou mayst do to him as it shall seem good unto thee then David arose and cut off the skirt of Saul's rule privily and it came to pass afterward that David's heart smote him because he had cut off saw skirt not ain't that something the man heck fiction from just cutting skirt he didn't kill him just cut it and he got conviction I wonder what convicts us and his men the Lord forbid that I should do this thing unto my master the Lord's anointed to stretch what my hand against him seeing he is the anointed of the Lord so David stayed his servants with these words and some of them not to rise against Saul but saw rose up out of the cave and went on his way David also arose afterward and went on went out of the cave and cried after Saul said my lord the King and when Saul looked behind him David stooped with his face to the earth and bowed himself I had to look at this and I was so glad that this came up in my Bible reading this ties into all those sermons that I preached and it goes right into the script over in second Peter 3 I mean second Peter 1 we can start reading everything maybe verse 6 or 7 we picked that up in a second but but David exercised temperance David exercised temperance I was so blessed a man you know because I know that some of the Saints are exercising temperance I know that you see we're Christians we're from a we're citizens of another Kingdom and and the Holy Ghost that we got is not our Holy Ghost that just make us feel good it's the Holy Ghost that causes us to act like Christ it's the Holy Ghost that calls us to live like Christ it's the Holy Ghost that calls us to be like Christ hallelujah Church alright now just just real quick so we can read this Amen what this temperance is all about let's go to 2nd Peter a man chapter 1 hallelujah this is this is what God has called his church to a man these are the ones that are influenced from above thank you Jesus second Peter chapter one I'll start reading at verse three according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness and through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue into your virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience amen and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity this is what we are made of we are citizens of another Kingdom listen it says but if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these things is forgotten that he was purged from his old sins I'm just reading the Word of God I'm just reading the Word of God that's all I'm doing now I'm a citizen of another Kingdom I'm not like this world III gave actually gave up my citizenship to this world a long time ago amen this world is not my home all right I got a new passport praise the Lord it's a heavenly passport to see if my if my subjects were of this world then they will fight but since my subjects are not of this world my subject don't fight let the church say Amen can we read from statue of a perfect man is it okay hallelujah all right the Prophet says this fourthly we have to hurry because it just feels so good to stand here and talk about it a man and one of the brothers in the church said all right all right yeah hopefully thank you prophet says temperance oh my we've come to temperance now you've had faith first you have to have that to begin with then you have virtue to your faith it's in this the right kind of virtue then you add knowledge if it's the right kind of knowledge now you're going to add temperance and the Prophet gives us the definition you didn't got to look in the dictionary we got it from the Prophet doesn't mean stop drinking alcohol here either no no tim'rous doesn't mean alcoholic you not in this case this is Bible temperance holy spirit temperance that's just one of the lust of the flesh but we're talking about holy spirit temperance that means how to control your tongue I think God for profit even when you just do did something to say something I uh you want to know what's tell you to do that it's the Holy Ghost in you that's fine if the Holy Ghost close the front and oh don't try to go through the window they left a back door open I'm going in the back don't know just pass right by it doesn't he says that means how to control your tongue not being tattle how to control your temper so that's why I say see when you see things you can't unsee it when you hear things you can't unhear and I'm gonna tell you some of us are responding based on what we saw I had people calling me from South Africa based on what they saw they start telling this going on that's good and they shouldn't I say look look look look it's saying all of this is sin every every last bit of it's just nothing but sin the only fix is Christ and when I start talking like that they stop texting me nobody wants to talk to me when I talk about Jesus you want to shut down the conversation bring Jesus up watch how many like she get a man I put a picture of me and my daughter in my family everybody liked it I put a scripture huh it's okay I know you reading this deal it's you gotta like it just read it alright not be a tell how to control your temper not fly off every time anybody's fees cross to you oh my by a lot of us going to fall up if we get started aren't we see then we wonder why God is not in this church doing miracles and things that they used to do yes sir see he goes on he says add these things at temperance to it Oh temperance how to answer in kindness how to answer in kindness citizens of another Kingdom amen how to answer in kindness winter wrath is spoke to you somebody said you bunch of holy rules down there don't jump up don't jump out and roll up your sleeves now see that see not that but talk with godly love temperance kindness is the way you want to be congregation says when you ride upon round not back round not back let him be your example when they said if thou be the Son of God turn these stones into bread he could have done it and show he was God but he had temperance when they called him Beelzebub he said I'll forgive you for it that's right they pull handfuls of a beard out of his face and spit in his face and said come down off the cross he said Father forgive them they don't even know what they're doing what an example of temperance and as believers if there was ever time to demonstrate that our lives are different than everybody else's it's right now let temperance be just oozing out of you 1st Peter 2:20 first Peter 2 and 24 what glory is it if when you be buffeted of your folks now Buffett means to be struck repeatedly or violently to be battered now you're buffeted for your faults that mean you did something wrong you struck repeatedly they strike repeatedly at you violently bad I mean your batter because of something you did wrong he says for what glory is it when you be buffeted for your faults you shall take it patiently you ain't done nothing you was wrong a man but if when you do well and suffer for it you take it patiently this is acceptable with God but even here up to where you called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that we that you should follow his steps who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth I'm going on who when he was reviled reviled not again so if you want to know what what Jesus do when he was reviled he reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose stripes you were healed revived reviled means to be criticized in an abusive and angrily insulting manner so you've been criticized and an abusive angrily insulting manner you're supposed to not revile again as a citizen of another Kingdom Lord the wind is almost gone Jesus the wind is almost gone but i'ma finish up God I want y'all to catch this quote here blasphemous names brother Branham preached a message statue of a perfect man and after statue perform a he preaches blasphemous names and he's making comments about you know the different virtues faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godless you know brotherly kindness and charity is making comments about then he makes a comment here and blasterz themes and this package says to my knowledge I add temperance self-control says I like that because tempers are self-control I like that look at this to my knowledge I add temperance self-control I like that my country tis of the crown my soul with self-control from sea to shining sea I just couldn't what is this why would the Prophet say something like this look at what he say to my knowledge I add temperance self-control I like that my country tis of thee ground my soul with self-control from sea to shining sea well he actually just integrated two songs two songs about our nation one of those songs a man is called America right and and I was I was just looking at this - the song says my country tis of thee sweet land of liberty of thee I sing he says land where my fathers died hallelujah land of the pilgrims pride from every mountainside let freedom ring even Martin Luther King got inspiration from this mmm when they talk about let freedom ring he got inspiration from this I Lou you glory to God the properties say it's a crown of my soul with self-control and then it goes into these Amen songs about the land of America because here we have a problem singing those songs there's a big stand has been taken that we're not gonna sing those songs but the properties say crown my soul with self-control my country tis of thee from seed to sign and see it's gonna take some self-control to be able to do what the prophets said let me give other song it's called America the Beautiful it says oh Beautiful for spacious skies for amber waves of grain for purple mountain Majesties above the fruited plain AMERICA AMERICA God shed His grace on thee and Crown thy good with Brotherhood from sea to shining sea I thought that was very very unique that a prophet would just kind of inject that and I think the Holy Spirit allowed him to say that because he knew the times in which we'd be living and how we gonna need some Holy Ghost temperance to make it through these out and make it through this hour all right let me just bring a closing quote here actually I'll finish reading that quote out of blasphemous names it says to my knowledge at I had temperance self-control I like that my country tissa t crown my soul of self-control from sea to shining sea see patience o my test it don't worry don't you worry Satan will count them for you Amen I'm climbing up the ladder now see I've added virtue knowledge temperance now I've got to add patience I still ain't got the Holy Ghost then after I had patience are godless you know what it what it is like god I don't misbehave myself go like a Christian gentleman let that not be a put-on hallelujah something in me the love of God just boiling see see not say I could I could do it but maybe I better not don't be like that he says see uh-huh is there any how so you said if you got to fight to keep it down in this day anyhow you got to pray that God deliver you from it he say it's a birth I've been birthed into this into this into this into this into this into this into this and then the love of God Christ comes down and seals all that upon me for service see praise the Lord all right all right all right all right let me just see I think I want to just bring one last quote this was as I was with Moses oh yeah as I was with Moses and just make sure that's what I want to do oh no no gods provided wait gospel by the way this is a quote that brother Branham makes here in West Palm Beach and I just want to bring this to you hallelujah Church were citizens of another Kingdom and hey I want to act like where I come from they man and see my actions now actually prove where I came from you understand it proves where I came from there's spirits all in the land and they pull in from every direction you got to watch what you see you got to watch what you hear because that influences you Amen look at this down brother brother and I made a statement here and I just want to leave you with this because it seemed like the add just came out the room it was a lot of a man's at first and everything it just I knew I was I knew I knew something that's been right when the amens get like that you can barely you got to pay for any man would you just give me an amen please do you know you don't say something right then you know that you don't hit the target and see I'm gonna tell you we're not we're not up here preaching for amen we're up here preaching so people can be set free hallelujah look at this now righteous man is not a sinless man for you notice he said Elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are he had his ups and downs and his differences and the scripture of his life proves that he had his ups and downs like we do and he had his times of wandering amen and it's times that his temple got away from him and he had a lot of things that went wrong but he was still a righteous man because he confessed his unworthiness and believed in God so that's what made him righteous we're not righteous within ourselves we're righteous through Jesus Christ I cannot be sanctified within myself I'm sanctified through Jesus Christ who stands in the presence of God in my place it isn't my holiness it's his holiness my holiness won't work at all but his does because God done accepted him and in accepting him he had to accept me because I'm in him amen that's what makes it real isn't it then we don't have to depend on ourselves now that doesn't make us say we can see in brother if you seen you just away from God that's all there's only one thing to do is confess and get right with God as long as your desire to sin the desire of sins still in your heart then it's time to stay down at the altar till that thing is taken out now you will see him you're about to sin you just can't help it but not willfully sin he that says willfully after he received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin but everyday you're bound to sin look at what he says and you're bound to be backsliding constantly so it takes a constant prayer to God Paul said I die daily and if Paul had to die daily how much more am I going to have to stay there dead all the time if Paul had to die daily to stay right with God and so we have to do that just die out self and that's getting God's wait now there's only two ways of anything that's the right way and the wrong way and then ways are your ways and God's ways and you can't be in your way and God's Way at the same time you've got to forget your own way to get in God's Way and you got to get out of your own way to get in God's Way for as long as you're in your way you're out of his way so forsake your way forsake your thoughts forsake everything and just rely on one thing on thus saith the Lord that's all then you know you're right citizens of another Kingdom god bless you [Applause] [Music] let's pray father we are grateful to know that we are citizens of another Kingdom you told us in your own words that we have come from you we're going back to you you told us through the voice of a prophet that we're either influenced from the above

they don't fight god we realize that we are subjects of another Kingdom were controlled by Lord a heavenly vision a greater plan and God I pray that we would all step into our position and that it might not oppose the Word of God that's been revealed but father that it was just Lord it will flow a man accordingly with the word of God and lord help us to hear your voice there's so many voices

Lord says that we should do gotta actually to forgive us of us in we recognize and acknowledge our wrong before you and God we're so glad to know that even as the Prophet Lord Elijah a man of like passions and God sometimes it's tough to got out of control but he was righteous because he was in you God and Father that's what we found ourselves in you won't forgive us for the way that we represent you sometime forgive us Lord for a man for not doing the things that we should do for the kingdom of God God help us Lord to stand bold and I pray to chew it and as it was prayed in the book of Acts write unto your service that with all boldness they may speak the word Lord by stretching forth out of hand to healing signs and ones we've done by the name of our Holy Child Jesus Bible says
