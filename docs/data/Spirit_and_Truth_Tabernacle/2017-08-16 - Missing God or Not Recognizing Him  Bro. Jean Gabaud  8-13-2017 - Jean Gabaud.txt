gave me I'm sorry he's not here to hear it hopefully he can pick it up in here in some time the future the song is about someone living in the world and because the Sun is so bright outside and it makes the world look really good they're not really sure of the life that they're leading and he's facing his songs that because there in the world they think everything is really great and but they don't realize that they're living in darkness and not feeding on the light of God he also states that because they live in the world so much that their God is down and they don't realize that they're living in a life of hopelessness and that they're choosing the devil's Mirage he also states that because they are living in the world that they're they can't keep focused on trying to serve the Lord and that the more they're in the world the more that their spiritual light is burning out and once they realize that they are not being focused on the world and that they're falling away from the Lord that they start to cry out to God and they ask God to begin the journey to turn themselves back to God and Jesus answers this person and says that he has come down into the world to save him in a set set his person free and that all the struggles and trials that this person goes through he they belong to him and this person doesn't need to cry or fight the battle alone so he named the song life is a traffic jam without Christ insurance and I cold titled it come to me and be free I hope it's a blessing to you just because the sun is shining doesn't mean the world is bright your ever take a bite of darkness then feed on the light your guard is down and you live in a life of hopelessness choosing after The Devil's Mirage yeah yeah you're choosing after The Devil's Mirage so you can't keep focused cuz your light is burning up and now you are crying trying to gain this whole world mmm you're trying to gain this whole world but then you realize that your light is burning out so you cry out to Jesus to save you from you'll need the real oh whoa save you from your missile beanie and Jesus said I come down from heaven to say it are you free all your struggles and try your they belong to me so stop your crying come to me and be free stop your fighting come to me and be free Jesus that I come down from heaven to say to you free all your struggles and trials they belong to me so stop

morning the Cecilia Marie I met just Marie few months back when I start going through the efforts of trying to get a little part-time job after being out of the work place for many many years and I was real nervous about it but I became a part of an agency that sent me on a temporary assignment where sister Marie was she was our coordinator the first time I went there I kind of did a dry run because I was nervous I want to make sure that I would get where I was doing on time the next day so I went and I went inside and I told the receptionist why I was there but she called just Marie out and she came out and greeted me and when I saw her I said Lord this is a real Christian yes this is a real Christian that was a happy sight to me so the next day I came in for the interview and we sat and talked the first question that she asked me in the interview was what church do you go to and our interview went along those lines and really we were talking about the Lord our experiences in the Lord and it was good it really was good as I never had a job and I'd be like that before we had many many conversations during the course of time that she was there and that I was there and it just got richer and richer and one particular day we were talking I don't know how it came up but uh she said something and I responded to the words some of the words of the song step into the vision and

to be back in the house of the Lord let's just bow hearts maybe as they play that softly let's just approach the author of the word gracious Heavenly Father we counted a privilege that we could be here this morning we think you dealer for your blessings that you've bestowed upon us this week and father the Lord there's no other place that would rather be but in the house of God the Lord my heart just burned within me the Lord just knowing the Lord I was going to come to a place of worship father the Lord I pray I pray that you would remove any distraction from our midst the Lord anything that would hinder us from receiving a blessing this morning may you come and speak to every hungry heart the Lord and minister to every need the Lord and father I pray that your people would just lay the burden at the foot of Calvary their Lord knowing the Lord that our debts have been paid the Lord Father we thank you for your grace and your mercy now as we reverently approach your word the Lord I pray the Lord that you would open up the word on to us I'm reminded of what you're profited at any man within the ability of his own can flip back the pages of the Bible but it takes the Lamb of God to come and break bread with him father may you come and just reveal your word one more time to us the Lord will be careful to give you the praise and glory that only you are worthy of and the bride says amen amen god bless you sing to certainly get to be in the house of the Lord that's all the singing for my part so preachers appreciate the positions turn with me revelations chapter three just one opening Scripture and I'll let you have your seats and shush y'all had a good week amen I was uh I was running a little bit behind got a late start and my mom is with me so I was happy that I was able to swing by and pick her up amen so really excited to have her with us and I tell you what I mean you know your your your already running late as it is and feeling really bad and here you're stuck behind every slow car you catch every red light you know you don't see a cop for days and then that one day that you're running late they're everywhere you know they're following you there ahead of you so it's expressional you but they've got God's grace right here this morning amen Revelation chapter 3 verse 21 opening Scripture and I'll let you have your seats and it reads behold I stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and what's up with him and he with me Amen me the Lord has his blessing too reading of the word he may be seated amen i ministered on this not too far back I'm a home church and really looking at some key scriptures that I may or may not have shared with this little flock here but it's really missing God or not recognizing them and we're living in a day where you know men's agenda is is as such that they're so preoccupied with so many things that's taking place and they're missing the very movement of God the very essence of God and and it's amazing because it's nothing but the tactics of the devil where he's throwing and bombarding us with so many forms of distraction things that occupies our time impulses redeem the time for the days are evil so things that occupies our time things that occupies our mind things that just occupy you know are walking so it's just that it just God is moving on the scene and man is missing the very the very acts of God and and it it's it's striking and it's remarkable and that's what we're going to dig into a little bit is you know how man is missing God or not even recognizing him in in their midst you know it's interesting because we live in a we live in a modern day society and we have at our disposal so much technology and you know we could look at and know that there's a storm that's brewing and we make preparations for the storm we know the strength of the storm we know if it's a tropical depression we know if it's a category one two three four five so we know the strength of the storm we even have instruments that can predict the path of the storm so if the storm is if the storm is not heading towards us then it gives us moments to relax but if we're in direct path of the storm it creates a sense of urgency because you know we don't want to not trust the news the news anchor or the newspaper or the the source in which you're getting the information from you just know that there's a storm that's coming and you want to make preparations and like any man or woman would do they would board up the house they would make sure that everything is hunkered down and that there's not anything loose you could think you could spiritualize this so because this is important right you you want to make sure your family is safe so you board the house you want to make sure that nothing you know the Bible says lay aside every weight and sin that so easily beset us so so when we know that there's a storm that's coming we take precautions we we built things down we make sure that there's nothing loose around we take inventory of making sure that the home is in order we make sure that our children's in order why because there's a storm that's approaching now jesus said you know of the Pharisees you can discern the sky but the signs of the time you can't discern pondering that for a little bit so with all the technology that man has they can discern the the sky they know when things are going to get bad they know if conditions are right for a tornado they know conditions are right for a hurricane they have the instruments but yet they fail to look at an anointed word and draw the same type of spiritual conclusion they have they lacked spiritual urgency and so therefore naturally they take precaution but spiritually the searle is void of God but there's been a prophet in the land who told us that there's a storm that's coming I don't know about you but I'm going to echo what John would say up for me in my house we're going to serve the Lord we're going to make preparations let me tell you it's more than me coming to church to showcase that I just bought a new suit it's Laura let me tell all my track I said you know coming to church is much more than fulfilling your spiritual obligation you don't come to church on Sunday just to get your spiritual fix I hope y'all can still call me brother after church is done it's much more to entertain it's much more to show one another my soul is at stake the soul of my family is I think let me say if you don't want to take this seriously then you shouldn't be right here worshiping God but let me tell you I know what the Bible tells me and I've laid aside every weight and sin and I'm going to take this gospel very seriously can we sit braise the Lord there's a storm that's brewing and people are dismissing the signs of the time it's no mere coincidence that we have things that happening in the world today we're living in the end time in spiritual darkness are coming at play there the gatherings are forces and people are looking for something thicket sense it in the atmosphere but for us it's more than just sensation my soul is anchored on the promise word that the Bible says this mortal must put on immortality someone has to fulfill that Scripture the Bible also says that God is not slack concerning his promises at some men will count slackness because usually in that we're usually in that approach people tend to get lazy they get relaxed and they miss God so I just like to draw some examples from the scripture of of opportunity that people have missed and John chapter 5 if your turn there with me real quickly John chapter 5 the Bible says this and verse 1 after this there was a feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem now there is at Jerusalem by the Sheep market a pool which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda having five porches in there in these lay a great multitude of impotent folk a blind Hulk withered waiting for the moving of the water for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and troubled the water whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had so pausing there real quickly you find that there was a spool and within a certain season an angel would come in and with trouble the water and can you just imagine the throngs of people that sat around waiting for an opportunity for healing to take place and the Bible says that the conditions of the people varied from impotent to blind hole withered and their salvation was resting upon the moving of that water and that was where they received their blessings if you will and the Bible talks about that the first one that got into the water after was troubled they were made whole of whatsoever disease they had man can you just imagine so when when the water was troubled an angel in trouble that water one person made it in then the rest would have to wait but the Bible goes on and says in a certain man was there which had infirmity 38 years 30 years 38 years he had this infirmity now I want you to kind of ponder on this a little bit this man was amongst the people waiting for an opportunity to dip into the pool so that way he could receive the healing that he's been battling with for 38 years this man didn't have anyone there to support him he did have family members he didn't have friends he was alone in this situation it's all he knew that his only salvation was was to make it to the pool in order for him to receive his complete healing so everybody was waiting for a return angels ministry to come in trouble the water always been together so but while they were waiting for a return ministry Jesus was in the midst of the people because God knows who his chosen ones are I'm not looking for a return ministry I'm looking for Jesus on the scene it's all you find that you know this man year after year he was at position but one day there was a visit that was going to change his life completely and so why he sat there just waiting year after year first year no opportunity second year no opportunity third year I mean think about it you have to fight with people he had to wrestle he had to struggle in order to have access to the pool but he was just not quick enough perhaps he was not forceful enough perhaps he was enough he didn't have enough fight in him but he stayed close to where the blessing he thought was that hereafter year he came the church got nothing he after year heard a message it was troubling but did nothing yesteryear let me tell you your condition does not change stops pursuit after you just because it didn't happen the first year you hold on to that the second year you hold on to that the third year you hold on to that because one of these days it's going to be different one of these days it's not going to be the same and the Bible says and and when Jesus saw him live there the Bible says he saw neither in you that he had been now a long time in that case he said to him will thou be made whole you know I like about that scripture the Bible says when Jesus saw him he knew his diagnosis he knew the situation it's different when you go to a doctor and they got a picture of these smiley faces from happy to really sadness that how you feeling I'm like I don't know I'm somewhere between seven and eight but it's really really bad and they try to they try and get you to pull you how do you feel the day if I may I don't know that the reason why I'm here is because I don't feel good but the Bible says Jesus is a great position that could be touched by the feelings of my infirmities your brother may not know the pains of what you're going through but I could interject and those exactly what's going through your heart and do your soul he could diagnose your situation before you sit out of one word of what your problem is and not only that but he has an answer for your problem he has an answer for yourself for your situation he has an answer for your question he could look at you let me say you could be sitting here in church with a smile in your face but your soul is full of pain your heart is aching you can fool everybody yes but you cannot fool Jesus Christ he has diagnosed the situation and he knows exactly the burden that you're caring Sunday after Sunday you could come to church with a smile but your heart is heavy I may not be able to well articulate what you're going through but the moment you open up your mouth to God he's able to dissect he's able to desert all your situation and provide a remedy for your problem this man his focus in attention was with everybody else think about that Jesus sifted through a crowd of people you know how many people he bypassed just to find that one man and as Jesus brushed the side of the group of people they were still looking at the water and meanwhile he was sifting his way through the crowd the word was looking for his alexia the Bible says when Adam fell there did not change God's opinion about his son this is not a message of replacement this is a message of restoration when word got back to God that your children are fallen brother branham illustrate these licenses I'll step in and go help out give us as I step in as will help on and progresses gorgeous perspectives on this is Michael this is not your job Gabriel this is not your job these are my children and the policies without controversy great is the mystery of godliness of God became flesh and he came walking he came looking after his own children because another law will not do he has to restore you back to your condition so he sifted through the crowds of people press his way people want to push the Messiah whether they were just looking at the water because that was more important than recognizing God in their mid but that's okay for the other people that miss God I think Donna he was looking for me I think God that he came and gave me and on him then he came and sought after me because let me tell you how was it looking for God but God was looking for me the Bible says long we were yet sinners Christ died for you when you were drinking your beer in the world God will get you that I made the right decision about you when you had a farm ah just that I make the right decision about you when you were smoking your cigarette just still saying I made the right decision about you let me do when people saw you and thought that you all finished up God look at you sir this is a promise child I have made a promise and I will redeem him and back to the phone what man failed to see God saw in me everybody else did that man but he had no opportunity he had no friends there's a friend in G he had no support the support in Jesus and in Jesus can you just imagine just the thousands of people that probably stood there waiting for an opportunity to just have an audience with God to have an audience to just just dip into that pool and receive their healing and me like Jesus say excuse me I'm looking for someone he knew who he was looking for it was God who says Adam where are down God who said Adam where that God is it's all so God who called Jeremiah from looking room of his mother God knew you by name before you uttered your first word before you breathed your first breath God said I put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life and Jesus came to this man he asked him one question will you be made whole this guy's was not complicated when I asked you to put your name in the books always you could be joined to a church we're not asking you to do back flips and somersaults we're not even asking you as a requirement to speak in tongues before we need to put - you're part of the body that's not part of the requirement Jesus kept it simple he came to the man he looked at him he diagnosed the situation you he's been in that situation for a long time let me say something there's not one prayer that you pray to God that he didn't know about lord I don't know if you know but uh there's not one word that you can honor to God that he didn't know about the Bible talks about again he begins to pray for the Church of Israel and try to understand the vision that he had and the Bible talks about how 21 days later the angel Gabriel comes and tries to insert the prayer for Daniel and finally when he gets the Ganga he says Daniel highly favorite unless of God he says the first day that you inclined yourself to pray God heard you the first time you ever get on your knees about your issue God heard you two years ago he heard you five years ago but the glory of the Lord is with the right time when with the right season but you gotta stay pressing or believing that the moment that God comes on the scene he's more than able to do exceedingly abundantly then all that you have ever expected let me say praise the Lord so yes a man would I be made whole just one simple question and then the airplane man answered him and said you didn't say yeah he said well you see what happened was I have no man when the water is troubled to put me in the pool but while I come well I am coming another step down before me and they just get chaotic I went to the doctor and the doctor said well we all know we don't have the right medication and then you know it runs in my family and this stand the other it's a really difficult situation I've been like this hole for the longest he's just imagine Jesus in there he Jesus didn't know how he got how he came how he came with that explanation from one question he has it was a yes/no question do you want to be made whole yes or no but this man he misunderstood it says well let me cling to you you know thirty years I've been seen here no one came by I don't got no family you know the doctor said this and you know they've been in school and they got degrees and everything who are we to really capture addicted doctor and you know I just you know I don't know what we I've seen a lot of specialists I've seen experts and I seen their experts I've seen a psychiatrist I've seen their psychiatrist I've seen a bunch of people I talk to everybody and no one really has an explanation but I don't know what you're gonna do for me but I'm telling you what it is a very complicated situation I maintain different I mean it not much different from you and I today after I went to the doctor the doctor oh you know this came from discouraging you let me take every time the devil opens up his mouth ezel I the Moses that every man be alive and God be true I don't care how many degrees you have I don't care what school you went to if you ever went to the school of the baptism of the Holy Spirit where the Bible says by His stripes I am healed I have no reason to get here to things that contradicts the structure jesus asking one question do you want to be made whole my response is yes feet alone to me according to your word that should be your attitude Lord be it unto me according to your word no matter how difficult the situation looks you might the brother Jean I'm going after a job and there are two people down much better than I am beat it up to me according to your word God deals with the impossibility I don't want to miss God this morning he's walking by are we staying together so this man said that he offered Jesus a whole explanation you know the when the foolish trouble like as if Jesus doesn't like he's telling Jesus things like as if Jesus doesn't know himself cuz obviously you didn't make it to the water I get that that's the reason why you still in the situation that you're in but I'm not looking for that explanation do you want to be made whole because he was looking at all of these people and he probably reasoning how is this man gonna get me down to the water now realizing that he was speaking to the very killer himself to the very one who who's responsible for you and I Jesus didn't entertain it too much he just responds like some anniversay and says man rise up take up your bed and walk rise rise take up thy bed and walk you know the reason why that's so important is because the devil's sole ambition is to knock you down when someone is tired they get this they sit down they need rest when someone's beaten the beam down when someone is sick sickness just brings you down physically emotionally and sometimes it spiritually brings you down and so the reason why that is is because remember Satan anointed the beats who used to walk upright so he had an advantage over man and so when he brought man when he interfered with man he he he interjected Timmy introduced sin and men spiritually fell and God looks at man it is because this has occurred I will curse the ground for your sake and the Beast that walked upright the Bible says how he God brought down his body broke down his composition and in physique and had him go and crawl on the ground so he's identified with the curse so that's the reason why when when saying he his demons are an attack they tried to bring you down to the ground because they want you to be identified with the curse but thanks be to God the grave is that what I'm supposed to be I'm not identified with the ground that's the reason why there has to be a resurrection there has to be a spiritual resurrection that's the reason where we got begins to bless you he raises you up the Bible says you're seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus because you're not identified with the curse of the ground God has risen you up you're seated in heavenly places let me count upon them kind of play with this a little bit when when the first piece came out it was a lion a four-footed beast he still walked on the crown that was anointing with in the first future changes the second beast was an ox he was still connected to the ground that was within sight area in the third beast he rose up a little bit with a man he walked him two feet you see that men's beginning the rise up a little bit but he was still connected to the ground but in this age God has given us the anointing of an eagle there were no longer identify with the course of the girl but God has resurrected you and I up then we just fly and soar above the custard land and see the impending judgment your quickened with the Eagles of nineteen praise be to God so Jesus saw them rise that's your message when God speaks to you you no longer have to be bounded by your problems binded by your circumstances the viruses W the chains are broken you're no longer tied to those things in the business world the illustrate how one should try to exercise realize their full potential they talk about that in business and on a side note a lot of people that prosper prospers under the philosophy of business but the inspiration comes from God you used to tie a lot of these motivational speeches and things of that nature from the very things that dig in the scripture don't let the devil rob you of what God has for you they said man that is design that's not anything new underneath the Sun it's from the Bible but they use this illustration but this a baby elephant and they they take this chain and they tied it this baby elephant to the tree and time and time again that baby elephant will try to pull but the tree would hold him back that baby elephant would try to pull but that tree would hold him back year after year he would try to do it and at some point he'll give up and stop trying saying you know what this situation is much bigger than me and he sits there and by the over the years he's grown into this ambassadors enormous gigantic elephant house strong and still chained and bound he stopped trying he stopped making efforts because he believed that he can't break that chain and in the business where they say you don't recognize your full potential what I'm telling you this greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world do you recognize your full potential don't be binded by the thing that the devil's told you in the past were you so real over the sins of the past and God so that can fit into the fear forgiveness but the devil want to replay that image into your head and you refuse to walk a little bit closer to God because you're haunted by the sins of your past if you put him underneath the blood and you've made it right you know that devil is just a lie and the Bible says in immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walk and on the same day was the Sabbath so immediately he was made whole Matthew 17 does those scriptures points the scriptures let me make sure I'm not keeping you past three o'clock with his 12 amen Matthew 17 [Music] now I'll just bring this point this is where Jesus brings up Peter James and John up to mount transfer your Mount Transfiguration and he illustrates how the the end times going to be with the the resurrected Saints those that died and went by the way of the grave and those data that are alive and took a change in the body a type of Moses and Elijah and so he brings them on the scene and he's transfigured before them but then in verse 10 the Bible says and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that Elias which is Elijah must first come and jesus answered and said unto them truly shall I Elias truly shot first come and restore all things so he's talking about this inside ministry says look Elijah is really supposed to come and restore all things but I say unto you that Elias Elijah is all is come already and they knew him not but have done her to him whatsoever they listed likewise also also also the son of man suffer of them then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist so I correlated this scripture with the study I was doing with the church around us and I was tiny with missing with missing God they were looking for Alliance to come and yet they were missing what he was doing brother he says this he says we think up for what he's done in the past we look forward for what he's going to do in the future but we often time miss what he's doing right now and so the world is completely missing the very acts of God in what he's doing right now uh when I was a tad bit younger um dudas I used to read a lot of comics and so when the paper came I always looked forward to it and that was the only thing I read with the comics and then there's this comic that it was a Charlie Brown comic it was a peanuts and it went across it went across the the u.s. it was a famous car it was the probably still live the famous comic and this newspaper went across the US and in this in this comic you find that this so this little boy he's watching a television and and and he's watching as this golfer is getting ready to make his last putt and the announcer says you know here it is there's no tomorrow and the little girl walks in and that's all she heard those no tomorrow she screams and she runs out she's like I heard it for myself it's the end there's no tomorrow this is it the world's coming to an end they're panicking in the book the little girl and the little boys are panicking in the last clip were their top of Snoopy's house and they're reflecting on what they just heard and Snoopy little bubble is the thought process was I thought Elijah was to come first I have the article I could show you this wood across the u.s. millions of people probably read the comic and saw that and went right over their heads they were looking for something and missing it and there he was saying I thought Elias I thought Elijah was to come first in the world missed it and yet God has showed it to a low bride you have an opportunity to see something that that that the scholars had missed the theologians overlooked Luke chapter 24 we'll wrap up with this Luke chapter 24 you love the Lord Luke 24 I loved reading the scripture because there's just so many there's so much points to this in verse 13 and behold two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus which is from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs so let me just kind of set the stage for you you have two individuals one of which will learn his name is Cleopas and they're leaving Jerusalem where the word kind of sprung forth and then we're making the way to Emmaus and this is after this is coming out of the heels of of the death of Jesus and then not only that but you they were witnesses to all the miracles how he fed the multitude how he did all these grander things and so then were somewhat saddened in the toll estate and they will work and they were making their way back weatherman says that there was going back to the occupations that will come back to their job and basically he says that you know though you know people say that the days of miracles are past it's all over there's no more revival so these men were heading to Emmaus and you know like anything misery breathe company so it's not enough for one person to kind of walk along in their tears of sorrow but they want somebody else to kind of join with them because they want you to know their pain so they say so they're walking back and they talked together of all these things which had happened how he healed the sick he he raised the dead he fed the multitudes he walked the water-heater waters reward to wine he did all these miraculous things in a cage the past verse 15 that while they commune together in reason Jesus himself drew near and went with them let me tell you if you haven't experienced Jesus this week did you talk about him because if you talked about Jesus it brings him on the scene Gee's ability not just had a self the presence of the Holy Spirit when's the last time you talked to God because if he's talked to God enough I'm sure that's going to invite God to come into your realm of atmosphere don't only girl God when you're in trouble don't only call God when you're down but let me tell you when the bills are paid when the job is good and the teak is full and your family Posse still call upon God don't wait till you're down on your bottoms only to when you're distraught but when things are going well you are to give God praises you're to holler shout if they like thank you for my health thank you for my well-being thank you for my finances thank you for my car thank you for my job thank you for my children thank you for my marriage you are to holler scream when the things are good [Applause] [Music] start talking about them it's easy to talk about politics but politics could divide us it's easy to talk about social issues but social issues could divide us but when we get to gathered around this anointed word praise be to God when you start a coup my brother Brennan said and you start telling me what Jesus says I have an affinity with what you're talking about you will not offend me because you're talking about what I am interested in people get upset because people are not including them in certain clicks at work I don't get a bit when they scatter like roaches because they see me I don't get offended the Spirit of God is so great in my life I want to be a beacon I want to be a living testimony talk about them so I you know I've been kind of sharing these those thoughts and points you know it takes me about 40 minutes to get to work 40 minutes back I just read to you I just act look quoting see what the Bible says redeem the time for the days are evil so 40 minutes what do you do in your commute you get caught up in the frustration of traffic what do you listen to when you're driving into work now only look around I just look at me what do you listen to when you get off work and things are really difficult I want I want to voice I could cleanse my spirit I want to voice I could cleanse my soul that could put me in the right mind frame so I'll put on a I listened to a sermon a brother branham because I think about and I did the math you know I'm like 40 minutes you know to and fro you know that's about 80 minutes you know it's been five days within a week that's a lot of hours that's a lot of time and you come you'll have time to find time to talk with God how do you fill your lost time if you're so uncomfortable that's okay God dealing with you cuz I just waste time I used to listen to the new station and my wife would tell me every time you hear like all these distraught things things around the world how does that really encourage you it I got to thinking about like I guess it does it by the time you get to work you're frustrated you're upset the boss say I want to talk to you about what because you have no sweetness about you your mind is animal is not in the right place your spirit is not in the right place but if you can fall into the right channel no matter what the devil throws at you you're ready for the day because you're sunny the day with God just talk about him a little bit let's talk about Jesus the king of King is you can never talk enough about Jesus it sets the right stage it's that's the right atmosphere I'll come to church you know I try to condition myself that way and I was you know what it was 2002 Thursday's ago I was preparing myself for one of the most challenging Thursday's of all my career and it was one of the best Thursdays I've ever had I said well I trusted God going into it and if you have made week service lord knows you need to start your day right because Monday nothing happens we have church on Wednesday Monday nothing happens Tuesday nothing ever happens Thursday nothing happens Friday nothing happens but Wednesday the devil shows everything in the kitchen sink action you know you got to get off for it by five o'clock you're talking to you talk to someone I did o'clock they don't say none me you're seeing my 9 o'clock I don't say none of you I 3 o'clock don't say none of you 459 AG you got quick second I don't blame that person is the devil trying to stop you from being a church now it's one thing if the if the Ox is in the ditch but open the reason why the Ox is in the disco put it in the ditch you gotta have an attitude with the Lord I am so excited to go to church tonight I want to be there and receive a blessing that's I could make it a church my ox was in the ditch and me while you're falling feeling guilty because you put the Ox there can we say praise the Lord I tell church when you get to the stoplight you gotta go go right and go home or go left and go go to church when you decide to go left to go to church it was the Holy Spirit I was that guy that was guiding you I let you draw your own conclusion if you would the other way but they got to talking about Jesus ah here's an interesting thing they were going in the wrong direction they were going to amazing last Jerusalem they were going in the wrong direction but that didn't stop Jesus from coming to their attention he still came looking for them and the Bible says in the eyes were were holding that they should not know him now listen to this because I just like to dig into the scripture and he jesus said unto them what manner of communication are these that you have one with the other as ye are as you walk is our sag so he's asked him what were you guys talking about now that's that's that's just how God is he's knows what they're talking about sometimes you just want to hear from your lips he drew it to their attention and meanwhile keep in mind the world is still functioning the world is still moving along people you know transactions are taking place life is continuing but they're missing what God was doing so Jesus draws them suffices what are you guys talking about when I told you ain't nothing that you're gonna tell God that he doesn't already know there's not one thing that you could tell God that he doesn't already know that prayer requests that you got this morning he wrote about God already knew about it he knows about the prayer requests but you're gonna write next week he knows what you're gonna face tomorrow this is how God is but he plays in the moment he wants to hear from you why are you so sad about talk to me a little bit because we want to tell everybody else they would feel happy talking to each other but let's talk to him a little bit and one of the most a was clear open sensory sit on them all right now only a stranger in Jerusalem it has not known the things which are called to pass in these days and Jesus said unto them what things are you only a stranger they even know that it was Solomon Jesus and that these things seems assassin Jesus what things and instead of them concerning Jesus of Nazareth which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God in all the people and how the chief priests and our rulers and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified Him now I want you to follow this next verse because here they are expounding to Jesus all these things that the rulers did that the chief priests did and how they conspired so they're telling them all these things and then in verse 21 it says but we trusted that it would have been he which should have redeemed Israel now listen to this and beside all this today is the third day since these things were done why did they say that because Jesus said you destroyed his body and in three days I'll raise it up he says I have the power to lay my life down and I have my power to raise it up so they held on to that word now follow this real carefully their doubts about the word did not prevent the manifestation from coming to pass because here was Jesus walking alongside with them and listen today's the third day where's the act we were looking for him we thought he would have been here with us he said he wasn't going to rise up here he was the manifested word so let me put you this way do you believe what you're saying amen to or does this message just sound good to you how deep-rooted is this how incurred is your faith because these men they were they were regurgitate it back to Jesus the same scripture and besides this today is the third day we thought you would have been here it was looking for him but they had doubts they had unbelief they struggled I don't know how they imagined it in their mind but here Jesus was walking with them now I say this to say there are things that's happening in the world today these events where the Bible says Martin events made clear by prophecy that's what the prophets reached what we see happen in the political system it's not by mere coincidence but God ordained it what's happening in social environments what's happening in technology the distractions it's happening right now and people are distracted by these things and yet Jesus is on the scene and their eyes are withholding but we'll find out soon as they continue to walk with Him he opens up their eyes but the Bible talks about Laozi's here they're blind miserable wretched naked and don't even know it and they put Jesus outside they put him outside the age so therefore Jesus has no value to the age that we're living in there are destory why people could say certain things and do certain things and not be so troubled in the spirit and the world is crumbling and falling apart like I was saying I was listening to a program I saw about the world falling apart he's inside my house just falling into pieces how sin has gotten worse and this was back in the 60s how the world's just falling apart and I was something the church this is the reason why there is such pains and agony and frustration and sin is because the bride is getting restless she's tired of living in this world my spirit grown is within me every day I wake up I anticipate a body change and when that doesn't happen I grown within myself waiting for the change of a body and don't you know that you're the blood that word that flows to you is the reason why this whole earth hasn't come and come into full complete corruption you're the salvation that's preventing this world from completely deteriorating but the moment that rapture takes place the Bible says you remove the salt you are the salt you remove the salt and the whole thing goes into corruption but the world is missing what God is doing to an individual elect group so they put Jesus outside of the age where is Jesus in your home where is he in your Christian walk or are you only a Christian when you're in church are you only a son of God when you're sitting here and people could see what you do let me tell you this is just a training field the battle is when you leave those church doors do people see Christ or do they see somebody else do people hear Christ or do they hear somebody else do you carry yourself with the sweet aroma or do people want to stay away from you they said today's the third day and they were missing what was happening in the Bible today in certain women also of our company made us astonished which were early as a Sepulchre and when they found out his body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive and certain of them which were with us went to the Sepulcher and finally even so as the women had said but him they saw not Jesus as a gentleman the processes the electro lament he'll let you complain they'll let you say what you have to say just like the man did he'll hear you out and when you're done with all your reasoning and all your explanations the Bible says he said unto them o fools slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken all that the prophets have spoken do you believe all this message even the one that makes you kind of squirmish a little bit you believe that when the Prophet Whitman when you pass will start preaching about your home do you still say Amen when you start talking about how you need to conduct yourself at work do you still say Amen when he talks about your dress attire did you still say hey man all that the prophets spoke this business this message this is not a buffet you can't just pick and choose what you want what you don't like when the Prophet the bass was preaching life after at least when he's preaching and things are going good I say Amen when I'm when I know I'm aligned to what he's preaching I'm a man but once in a while you know I get kind of beaten into the right path buzzer yeah I gotta get straight enough to and the baskets are saying something you start times going down my alley a little bit hurts it's not as loud but I do say a man may hurt oh they put a whooping to me man I and I'm looking to see who else knows about this and I left every courage I have amen amen and meanwhile you send a reflecting as if he just was walking with you that whole week the attitude that you caught that you should have caught the thing you say that you shouldn't have said the innocent thing that you did that it's all so innocent come on somebody I don't need to see if a God is watching everything you do and so is a devil so when you come to church and your pastor begins to hit on something that only you only you and God knows you got into devil God just whispered something into your passes here to make that spirit uncomfortable we as ministers we have an obligation they may not be anything going in the church but their spirits within the atmosphere and they're looking for a vessel to anoint it's the ROI given a certain thing what hit is strong work we will preach against it work we're hidden we hit it and you say and people looking around on a Hui Tama we talking about nobody this is not for a particular person but we want to make sure that you don't make yourself a willingly a willing vessel for that spirit because the Spirit is as weak until it finds a vessel to use and so God why is a man so that we can preach against so sin that's out there at that in the atmosphere that would be cast away from this place and sometimes the pastor has to just drive it straight home and know that there seems to be dealt with and he drives it straight home why because he has to clean out the church that's his role he has to present the church as a chaste virgin unto Jesus Christ can we say praise the Lord all right another two hours I'm wrapping it up I am I'm wrapping it up he says all fools and small parts of slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken all that Christ to have suffered these things into inner to his glory and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the Scriptures of things concerning himself as they drew nigh unto the village whether they win and he made as though he would have gone further but they constrained him saying abide with us for destroyed evening in the days it's far spent and he went in and tarry with them now in type you look at the journey of the seventh church age it's not until the seventh church age where the Prophet talks about that there's there be light in the evening time so the day has far been spent and we're living in the evening time and meanwhile along this journey Jesus is talking to them and they don't realize that it's Jesus they've heard a noise in Martin they heard of noise in John Wester you heard a noise in Pentecost but they really didn't recognize what that was it was not until the end time prophet came and talked that was Jesus throughout the ages and so by this time the heart is on fire so the getting ready to go into quiet place and it came to pass as he sat at meat with him he took bread and he probably said it's about hearts and praying he probably pray like this our Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name and he's breaking the bread and meanwhile Cleopas probably sitting with his friend open one eyes like I recognize that prayer sounds so familiar and he goes on say hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come that's exactly how Jesus were prayed something in that prayer brother and says there was something he did as he was breaking bread with him something in that message when you first heard good evening friends and the word started to come forth something one true in your heart yes I'm identified with this message I recognize it it sounds so familiar to me you never hunger for something unless you unless you first had it before I love that analogy I never once hunger for chicken unless I had chicken because I know how chicken tastes like I'm the hot fried chicken tastes like I know how big chicken tastes like I know I saw a chicken things like whenever I'm hungry free that's just because I tried it I know how fish taste like I know how steak tastes like I know how to shrimp tastes like but whenever I have a craving it's because I tried it before when I had a hunger for God when I was hoping for something more than denominational teachings when I was hungry for more than worthy ism it's only because way back before the foundation of the world I had an experience with God I tasted him before I recognized that message and its word so in the prosper Caymans and begin to kind of speak to my soul there was a recognition I recognized this word I'm like my goodness sounds so familiar and they probably looked one they probably looked at each other at the corner da and 100 escapa sizes they're women or to cheat in the Bible says he disappeared him vanished out of their sight can you just imagine the joy that overwhelmed these man that Jesus just vanished out since it zips up that was it it was so whole excited like this do you think it was him but I'm so excited and then the Bible talks about how did not our hearts burn within us while he talked with us by the way and he opened up to us the things in the scriptures let me tell you they got so on fire for God because the Bible says that God is a consuming fire I don't know about you but a fire doesn't cause you just to sit still when I come to church I get excited because my god is a consuming fire brother and says a church without emotion is is dead that's the reason why when the devil tried to put the Hebrew boys decided to a fiery furnace he couldn't kill them boys God is a consuming fire that's the reason why God defines every laws of science that's the reason why Moses could explain why burning bush didn't burn up because God is a consuming fire that's the reason why when you first came in contact with this message you weren't exciting to cross your legs that wall built praise be to God no such a fire inside of you such as zeal such a determination such privacy the Bible says that these men they couldn't sit put they ran all the way back to Jerusalem to go let the other disciple so what's the place and they came busting into the room and they start sounds the Lord is risen indeed he's appeared to Simon it's true if they got so excited and what they were trying to catch the breath I'm closing up whether catching whether trying to catch the breath and he tries to make activation sigh we saw him he's alive who did you see Jesus how do you know you saw him he talked with me how you know with him he did something that we all recognize that was so excited they have to share the word with someone you know why I had to be - because even if he took those two and you put them in opposite sides of the earth they were both still have the same testimony the God that you preached ears the God that I preached in Orlando they can interrogate brother Duff and Nicollet arrogate bilging they'll draw the same conclusion jesus is alive and well they preach the same thing they believe in the same word and I don't need that but Jesus back your testimony while these men were talking and tried to explain what was going on the Bible talks about how Jesus came on the scene and by that time they were all afraid they were looking one to another trying to be scientifically explained because I mean that's the thing I don't get the Bible talks about how Jesus says I will rise up in three days and yet when these things start to happen they got spooked I believe there's gonna be a change in the body I believe he's coming back again I believe the Dead will rise don't get scooped if you suck see people that you recognize start to rise up again because I'm under expectation don't be blind if I want Hollywood have you believe in zombies and supply I'm believing in a resurrection I'm believing that we're going to return back to a glorified body to our body that world where we're completely intact not what Hollywood paints I'm not gonna get spooked on why Hollywood paints I'm looking for someone that I've drawn by the way of the grave of Saint to rise up and I know that my redemption draweth nigh it becomes much more than something that we come to church and we hear a message that a prophet preached a ministry that a pastor exhibits a word that that encourages it actually becomes a reality can we say praise the Lord let's all stand to our feet the world is missing God these men almost missed them in the days of Noah it was sold to build an ark in the middle of a hot desert and yet the people were criticizing him why because the Bible talks about how he never rained a do one from the ground and watered the face of the earth but water never came from the from from from the sky but the very idea that water would come from the sky it went above the people but that's what Noah believed and so Noah was in the middle of a desert just building a boat just hammering away he endured criticism he endured laughter he endured these things and then not only that but when he got into the ark it didn't even rain immediately for a period of seven days I believe the boat just sat there can you just imagine he was like he built this boat surely we saw we're gonna see something they won nothing happened they - nothing happened three nothing happened four nothing happened five nothing happen people went back to man's man's undying the boat having this old family on the way he was taking crazy they five nothing happened they six nothing happened that man if you saw a lot man get your family out of boat Bay 7 my man this is crazy it was Oh things started to change a little bit they've never experienced water falling from the sky and then we're looking at that first part like this is very unusual and this is pretty awesome didn't know what the judgment of God and then the rain started to come down they won it wasn't so bad they - the water kept on getting bigger day three day four and nah no I listened to apologize I'm sorry day five the water started to get bigger the flood started to say there's no there's no stronger force in the power of water nothing can stop it you did you get an ambulance of water going through and it's just going to plow its way through so the whole earth in and out of the water it's no doubt know us that the boat started to crack a little bit give away a little bit and then finally broke loose and by the time people crying out judgement was in the land and they were missing it so what the Bible says they talked about pieces safety you'll go back to your work tomorrow you'll go back to your regular routine your clock-in you do what you need to do you go to the grocery store life will probably be as the same but you need to live it differently you can't live it like the people in the world something is different you gotta be like Noah you got to constantly be building that Ark building your family building the altar building that prayer life building that sacredness you got to be vigilant your life got to be different can we say praise the Lord we turn back to you soldier with by our hearts and prayer Lord Jesus we thank you for the opportunity that you've given unto us the Lord just to share the word with your people a little bit father I pray in trust that something would stay that was of encouragement to your people the Lord that this was the word that you put in my heart today to just expound on and I pray the Lord that folks will take it pretty seriously we obviously are living in the endtime men's hearts the Bible sense is showing them for fear we see the disturbance in the land both here in abroad the rise of faction groups that's causing terror but we know the type of though of devil that's rising that's causing that's trying to terrorize your people the word fortifies by your spoken word fortifies by your blood keep us shielded and protected dillard help us to walk circumspectly according to your word the world is falling apart and we know that the Bible says according to Hebrews 13 that anything that could be shaken will be shaken help us to have an inker help us to be grounded and rooted into your word in the Lord help us to just echo not only echo but also truly believe what Paul says that this mortal the living must put on immortality that the corruptible the dead shot put on incorruption of which the Bible is saying the Bible says a grave was not victory o death where is thy sting father keep your people here until the appointed time and father we trust that even today there could be a change in the body but should should life proceed as normal tomorrow help us to live a life that's so different a life that's so called out a life that's worthy of the gospel we are peculiar people a called out group our spiritual diet is different we can't hear everything we can't see everything we can't get digest everything you've built us up differently we know that the Bible says were the temple of the Holy Spirit and as a result
