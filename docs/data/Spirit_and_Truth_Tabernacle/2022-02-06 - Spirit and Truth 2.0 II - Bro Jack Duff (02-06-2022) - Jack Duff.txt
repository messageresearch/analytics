[Music] cause i know who i am [Music] cause i know who i am do you know who you are amen you are the children of the most high god praise the lord sister amanda has a testimony of who she is this morning praise the lord god [Music] god bless you i'm excited this morning so i've been waiting to give this testimony for a long time so i'm very excited um i don't know how many of you have ever struggled with it like a food allergy but it's not fun for a long time i um i was having really bad headaches for years and my joints were very sore i was always very exhausted my sinuses would constantly hurt like very painful so i went to the doctor many many times with all of these different symptoms and every time i went they said oh well you know let's check how you're sleeping maybe you're not getting enough sleep let's check maybe you're allergic to something in the air so they did tons and tons of tests they could never find out what was wrong with me and because i was studying in college at the time i had access to research databases and i'm pretty good with research so i started researching on my own and i ended up finding out that i had i was allergic to wheat so anything i ate with gluten in it would trigger these symptoms that were happening in me so i stopped eating gluten all together for a couple of months and just to test my theory i had um two of the breadsticks from olive garden my whole body broke out in hives it was horrible and then i had all of those symptoms again and i was like okay i'm done i'm done with gluten i know what it is um but you know that was a really hard decision for me because i love bread i love pasta i love things that have gluten in them and so i was always cooking separately for my family and then for myself and i would have to eat like gluten-free bread and gluten-free pasta and those things just don't taste good they're disgusting so but i did it because the symptoms were horrible and i didn't want to have to deal with them um so let's see when was it i think about a year ago maybe a year ago we had um decided i said you know i'm going to um just i'm not i'm not going to accept this i'm going to just eat gluten all i want i'm healed in the name of jesus and well i did it and my whole body broke my eyes and all the symptoms came back and i was like well maybe my faith is not there yet or something so i stopped eating gluten again um and then we were going to the fair this year and i told josue i said i'm so sick of this like i can't have anything with gluten in it you guys get to go have all this yummy stuff and i can't have anything i have to eat like kettle corn popcorn the fair so um he was like just do it just just eat gluten just i was like oh remember what happened last time you know the same doubts in my mind but anyway we discussed it prayed about it in the car on the way there and i just made the decision i'm done with this i'm done with this and i've been craving like so many things that have gluten in them so the baby's telling me eat this eat this and i'm like i can't so if we ended up going i ate gluten and i didn't break out in hives i i i didn't have any headaches my sinuses were not hurting my joints were not hurting and then the next day i'm telling josue on the phone do you think it's like bad of me that i'm um over here like waiting to see like i'm gonna like break out and hide somewhere or is my head gonna start hurting or something he was like that's a devil don't don't listen to that he's like look just just go and then we we talked to brother jacket brother jack was like you know what if you even have a symptom show up just rebuke it i i send this back to satan i rebuke this in the name of jesus so i've been eating gluten every single day and i haven't been eating a little and that's probably not a good thing right now oh but i've been eating gluten every day actually i had it this morning for breakfast and i have had no hives no headaches no symptoms so i just thank god for that because that is a blessing i'm so very thankful that we have a healer and i just gave god all the glory for that hallelujah amen well ain't no gluten praise the lord amen god bless you sister amanda amen god is good praise the lord sister naomi and sister hadassah will you come [Applause] [Music] god bless you [Music] my boat of life sailed on the troubled seas ever there's a wind in my cell but i have a friend who watches over me when the breeze turns into again i know the master of the wind [Applause] i know the maker of the rain he can calm the storms and make the sun to shine again i know the master of the wind [Music] sometimes i soar like an eagle through the highs among the peaks my soul can be found an unexpected storm may drive me from the house it may bring me low but it will never bring me down [Music] i know the master of the wind [Music] i know the maker of the race and he can calm the storm and make the sun to shine again i

to say so good to see since the porsche god bless you amen good to have you with us uh this morning and uh you all got uh all the information regarding our sister wasting just we really appreciate the just the way god just does things there's a lot that can be said about how that day was orchestrated uh one thing that i'll typically my wednesdays are uh i have to go and pick up food for the pantry and and bring it in and restock the pantry it just so happened on that particular wednesday uh sisatina forgot to press submit for the order so i didn't have a pickup and uh it freed me up to actually go to the hospital and be there uh with uh sister wayson and and you know it's just you know just looking at just all the little things that god was doing uh all along the way and you know really i feel like last year amen when the churches were merging sister wasting took sick and and uh some of the things like please please pray for we just didn't know how things were going to be but we saw god touch her raise her up uh give us strength to be able to walk again and i remember her walking through the parking lot to get in church just for prayer that's when was doing that at seven o'clock in the morning and situation was running through the parking lot because barely barely barely you know put shoes on but i saw god touch and saw running through the parking lot trying to get in there before seven o'clock hit the you know hit the dot there but i was just you know just so much that god god has done that day that she was in the hospital just just it would it i don't call it happenstance but sister um chantera was supposed to be off work that day she said i just happened to come in to take care of some paperwork and there she was sitting there uh taking care of sister wasting amen and giving us all the medical advice so you know we just knew that god was in him and after we you know planned for you know we uh for where the service is going to be that's even a testimonial i call brother wesco to let's let him know that she had passed and he called me back and said i just want to know the church is open and available if you need to use it i say well praise the lord amen and you know after we did that we um uh was looking for a place to have the re-pass and the sisters happened to pass by the boys and girls club and it was telling sister candace what we were getting ready to do and sister candace said i will get this place for y'all to have the repass say they had stop i stopped letting people use it but i'm gonna get it i think i can get it for y'all and uh and she said she worked it out say okay i got it and then she called back and said we're gonna donate the chairs and the tables as well for the repass god just moving all over the place so you know she's absent from the body but she's present with the lord and uh and i'm so glad that she walked out of here on her own terms hey man last sunday she was here just walking right on at the church like she normally does but where's he got called a home you know and uh and and i i tell you this i've never seen a saint leave so peaceful so peacefully uh uh me and sister virginia and sister brown and also sister ashley was there at the time that she was leaving us but but she left here so peacefully and and all i can say is that when it's my time to go if i can go like that god i'd be all right i'd be all right but she left her so peaceful like she just went to sleep amen amen so we're gonna miss our precious sister uh but i know it won't be long we'll see her again amen we'll see you again praise god amen um let's uh let's read a scripture um and we will kind of continue our thought here in spirit and truth 2.0 amen john 15. i had to take a second look josiah my god bro man you got me man well that's spirit and truth 2.0 represent my lord hey hey hey that's all right brother that look nice glory [Laughter] glory glory glory amen amen um here in uh uh john 15 says i am the true vine and my father is a husband man every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit this is just this blesses me every branch that bears fruit he purgeth it so it means your life can be fruitful your ministry can be fruitful but it has to go through a purging process and and now there's a reason for the purging process the scripture actually gives you uh the answer why you go through purgings and it says that it may bring forth more fruit hallelujah amen so don't be afraid of the update now amen things get better after the update all right it says now ye are clean through the word uh i have spoken unto you abiding me and i am you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye accept ye abide in me i am the vine ye are the branches glory to god amen uh he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing oh yes and if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if you abide in me glory and my words abide in you ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be done uh unto you hey i believe that amen just turning back to uh john 4 um and just picking up this woman at the well uh as you just see here plainly in scripture where the name of the church comes from amen and it's right here in scripture let's look at john 4 23 and 24. you know i i didn't think about this until now but sister porsche this week my my mother-in-law was at the house and she was um going back and looking at just some old videos old videos i don't know where she found them at uh but she was going through the videos and and there's some bible studies that we were teaching at um in green acres and uh and on that night she happened to just be watching one this week and on that night the one that she picked out she said guess who i saw in the video she said brother mike came with sister porsche for the first time and uh and when y'all walked into church i said brother mike it's good to have you and your wife that's what i ended up saying that and brother brother mike say this ain't my wife this is my daughter and that just happened this week you know i don't think god do things by mistake right amen but my god god is good glory glory uh here in john 4 verse 23 but the hour cometh and now is glory when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seek as such to worship him god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth amen the lord had a blessing to the reading of his word father we thank you for the privilege and the opportunity we have to be able to read the word but god may the holy spirit come now and take control over what we have read god made you get glory and honor and praise uh from amen the the sermon today and as you just kind of uh bless this god to be able to see 20 years of ministry and uh lord we uh we could never do this without you had you not uh the scripture says if the lord don't build the house they that labor laboring in vain so we thank you for building this house and watching over this house and just keeping us lord throughout the years uh we uh lord we're just grateful for what we know that you have done this is not the work of a man but this is a work of almighty god and we appreciate you lord jesus we pray god that he would just hide us behind the cross may we not be seen but may christ be on display uh this morning in jesus name we pray amen i mean god bless you can be seated amen as we just continue our journey um last last time i spoke for you um i was we took this subject amen of spiritual 2.0 and as we mentioned this is a man really just to play on words uh when we're using 2.0 um it represents 20 20 years a man of ministry uh that the lord has blessed us to be able to be a part of and and um and trusting that god will just continue to carry us forward in the years of hit in the years ahead and as i was just kind of sharing with you all there was roughly seven different occasions or several different things that happened in my life uh where i felt uh that the lord was calling me into ministry many of you all probably never heard my my testimony and i like to share it every once in a while because what i find out is that if you don't share your testimony people will give you one amen praise the lord so sometimes you need to hear from amen the source and know what happened in their life amen until you can direct people back to tape and say go listen to it if you want to hear his testimony go listen to this particular tape and uh you know but we we thank the lord for what he has done amen and all these years but we were talking amen with this play on words uh 2.0 actually represents what we call an update amen and an update and uh we were using these uh these uh what i want to call uh technical terms in order to explain what an update and i use uh information from the web as well as i used brother quentin jr uh he's a solutions architect and he you know he has to do updates with software so there there's reasons for doing an update so that's what we're what we're focused on just to revisit that just a little bit amen an update uh is new improved or it fixes software it replaces older versions of the same software amen uh they say for an example updating your operating system brings it up to date with the latest drivers now when i preached this uh two weeks ago uh right after service man sister wayson come running me and my wife down and uh she say i i got on this phone amen all these updates that are needed but i don't know how to update and uh and we start walking through the process we'll press this and press that the reason the phone don't work the way you want it to work because you got to do the updates hallelujah and i was just so happy that you know you know she was able to respond to the word just listening to a little sermon like that she responded i wanna i wanna be updated and i'm here to tell you this morning she not just updated she been upgraded [Applause] no more sickness no more pain no more worries about this that or the other she been upgraded hallelujah a body that'll never experience death again what an upgrade hallelujah we're all looking for an upgrade like that amen but uh but i was just blessed by you know when she heard the word you know i there there's just so much i i could just say but when she heard the word she wanted to apply it man she re i mean right then and right there she wanted to apply one one one wednesday night i come in and and i just was telling the church about you know we we should be so much further up the road than um worried about you know sisters and makeup and and all of that that that that shouldn't be a problem anymore and i was just talking about that one wednesday night and sister sister wayson come come to me after service and she say um she'll say brother jack you know uh i i have to put this on my on my across my eyes you know i i don't even have any eyebrows and i just feel so bad sometimes i just i have to put something up there just just so i you know she said i just feel so bad and i like the way she just kind of come and i just kind of talked to him like look i can't tell you to go against the word i can't tell you to do that say but i tell you what god god will help you you know through this and you just you just be obedient to his word that's all i can tell you just be in every area i want to tell anybody that be obedient to god's word how does he require you to dress i can i can show you in the scripture as to why we do what we do if you if you want to read the scripture right and and it's not my rules these are god's rules but i just loved the way her heart was and how you know anytime the word was spoken she wanted to adapt she wanted to apply amen immediately i appreciate her spirit appreciate her spirit amen but but here you know this update amen uh is often provided by software publishers is free of charge amen they're trying to improve things they want to make sure your experience is good so they provide these things free of charge that's what an update does it's it's to is to improve it's uh it's it improves security it gives you a better experience it fixes bugs you know it does all these things security because people trying to steal information people trying to steal your credit card information right sometimes you go into an app or you go to a website and you put you know uh uh uh a thing you you put your your personal credit card information somebody trying to hack that right and next thing you know you got charges on your credit card and you wonder where they came from it was something stolen off of a website but this is why uh uh people when they're when they're developing these websites when developing applications they got to make sure it remains secure so that your information is not stolen glory to god amen uh the update is to provide you a better experience all altogether and like i told you a man a bug happens in a computer it's a flaw or a fault in the computer program that produces an incorrect or unexpected result amen and we don't want incorrect uh unexpected results glory to god it causes the computer to behave in unintended ways amen but an update to the computer can call can actually resolve the issue with that software glory to god now here you know they made a statement that uh typically the only time software or hardware stops updating is when the related company goes out of business and as long as the ministry is is is uh is still moving forward we're gonna constantly get updates hallelujah amen it shows that we're living shows that we're moving serves like something to happen we're constantly getting updates from the from the holy ghost so i'm i'm excited about this season that god has us in now i use a lot of computer terms amen when we're talking that but i want to try to bring it down into common terms amen uh when we talk about these updates and upgrades now you know there's a difference uh in an update versus an upgrade uh if you've um if you've ever you know had the experience of buying a a new car or a new work car to replace maybe the jalopy that you were riding in anybody ever had a jalopy glory to god you ain't you ain't drove a man a a jalopy carter you had to maybe slide in from the passenger side glory to god to get over to the driver's side amen your windows won't let down come on somebody you you you understand amen i mean you know you go through things like that and and you have to pray that god will open up a door for you to amen to get a new car hallelujah hey man you every time you stop you got to put water in it right hey man we've been there my wife used to keep wat uh bottles of water in the trunk of the car cause every time he was running hot all the time glory to god but but what happens is that god at some point times makes a way for you to go out and get a new car and when you trade in that old car and i don't know some of y'all you might not have been in a situation like me but i had to pull it in and tow it in and and oh god i couldn't drive it in amen look i'm trading it in but i can't drive it here glory to god i needed god to give me an upgrade look i didn't want to update on that car i needed to upgrade replace it completely and there's some things in our life we need an upgrade we need god to replace it completely hallelujah the spirit of god is here to give us the upgrade thank you jesus amen and i tell you when you get the upgrade to that car ain't no looking back you thanking god for you know for these new wheels you like to bring it up to the church and let the saints look at it you park it in a certain spot and in the parking lot but then you ride by glory to god to let everybody know how god has blessed you thank god for your upgrades glory glory glory i had it here in in my in my notes you know well let me let me just say this you know adding if you had your you know your car and you just wanted updates to it you can add ram seat covers and dashboard covers and a new radio or whatever any other type of accessories that you want those are updates to the car but replacing the call together is an upgrade hey man another common term that i had uh right here in my notes and i know this was going to come in i say buying a new suit is an upgrade and here brother josiah walk in here like he's he's showing the upgrade and the update and i said now when you want to update the new suit you just throw a little hanky in there that's an update amen for you sisters when you buy dresses glory to god it's an upgrade amen to buy that new dress but if you want to update the dress sometimes you just add a belt hello somebody and that's an update to the dress sometimes you throw a jacket with it and that's an update it's the same old dress just an update to it hallelujah glory to god in some areas of our life god wants to upgrade other areas he wants to update we thank god for the changes amen amen i was thinking on this my daughter's getting married how many days is it nice 40 days she's getting married in 40 days and when when when her and erin come together as husband and wife that's to be an upgrade that's going to be an upgrade hallelujah how we thank god for that but you know there was a man in scripture that i want to just kind of read about here a little bit um this man needed a real update and what we what i also want to borrow the term from brother brother gwynna a system change amen this man went through some things in his life and and this is why god you know he allows us to go through certain things in our life uh to show that we need an update oh don't be satisfied with the experience you had 20 years ago don't be satisfied with the experience you had five years ago you ought to seek god for a fresh experience every time you come into his presence amen but but this man began to go through some changes in his life and uh and god had to humble him glory glory glory amen god had the humblest man because he you know as as we were just reading in the scripture amen jesus said i am the vine you are the branches and what happens sometimes we think we're the vine no no christ is divine and we are the branches hallelujah and we're only supposed to bear the life amen or express the fruits that are actually in the life of the vine glory to god amen if you're not bearing those fruits and there's something wrong so so here you know we find this man uh in scripture that needed an update he needed a system change a man he was humbled uh after seven years of living like an animal his name was nebuchadnezzar amen the man uh got to a point where he he got uplifted in his spirit my god he thought that it was all about him amen but god had to take him through a process where he stripped him of himself amen and then he could just kind of restore some code on top of this man in his heart your heart needs his code change [Music] glory to god god god has to take your your heart through a code change glory to god because you know often times amen we we get to a point where we think it's all about us and and i want to say this as we celebrate this 20 years i want to give god all the glory and all the praise i never want to think that this was about brother jack amen this has been all god but here you know we pick up nebuchadnezzar we never want to get lifted up like this man got lifted up let's pick him up in daniel chapter 4 and verse 30 glory amen hallelujah you know when you when you think about this man god had actually given him a dream about what was getting ready to happen and even a dream was interpreted to him told him what was going to happen but he couldn't stop itself from going down this road something's wrong when god show you that you're going down the wrong path amen god god has revealed it clearly that this is the wrong way but some still keep pushing to go in that wrong direction you're going to need an upgrade an update here daniel 4 verse 30 the king spake said it's not this great babylon that i have built for the house of the kingdom by my might of my power and for the honor of my majesty this man just got i i all in this like he did it all glory to god but there were there were prophecies about his kingdom coming amen and then there would be prophets about the you know other kingdoms that would follow amen the meas and persians and the greeks and you know then the roman empire which is still in effect today glory to god but here you know we look at verse 30 of the king spake and said it's not this great babylon that i have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power amen and for the honor of my majesty now look at verse 31 while the word was in the king's mouth there fell a voice from heaven saying o king nebuchadnezzar uh to thee it is spoken god will speak directly to you amen to thee it is spoken the kingdom is departed from thee my and they shall draw thee from men and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen and seven times shall pass over thee until thou know that the most high ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he will oh i love that amen you can't question god about who he put in leadership god god is the one that establishes amen the pastor god is the one that establishes the evangelist god is the one that establishes the prophet god is the one that establishes the teacher and the apostle god is the one that sets those gifts in the church we don't have a right to question god amen here this man thought it was all about him and while he's speaking these things out of his mouth amen god begins to speak back to him and say look you're going you know uh uh you he says seven seven times past that meant seven years he would go through this condition oh lord have mercy seven years look at seven times shall pass over thee until thou know it took that long for him to realize it seven years for him to realize until thou know that the most high ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he will the same hour was the thing fulfilled upon nebuchadnezzar and he was driven from men lost his mind driven from men and then eat grass as oxen and his body was wet with dew of wet with the dew of heaven till his hairs grown like eagles feathers and his nails like bird claws i want you to get that look at this man now here he was a king in a very very prominent position glory to god but once he lost his mind my he could no longer rule the kingdom now he's out eating grass like the animals amen fellowshipping with the animals you you'd be surprised at what uh depths you can go to when you step outside of the will of god you see i i want i wanna i i think this is a good uh warning for even me this morning yeah thank god for 20 years but you'll be careful about getting lifted up hallelujah because you can lose it all just like that god keep me humble keep us humble glory to god amen amen look at this uh verse 33 again the same hour was a thing fulfilled upon nebuchadnezzar and he was driven from men and did eat grass as oxen and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till his hairs grown like eagle's feathers and his nails like birds claws and at the end of the days i nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes into heaven and my understanding returned unto me oh my and i bless the most high and i praise and honor him that liver forever i'm gonna tell you when god does something on the inside when he gives you a system change when he gives you an upgrade when he gives you an update you're not the same person you used to be oh hallelujah amen we need an upgrade god we need an update father we need things to change from the inside and our hearts let it change and what is inside the heart will be reflected on the outside you can't say you love god and doing all these other things like that no if you love god you're gonna follow his words my god we need an update amen amen amen look at this look at this man amen it took him seven years it took him seven years but he but he finally got it after seven years verse 34 and at the end of the days i nebuchadnezzar oh i feel jesus i feel like somebody's days are coming to an end amen maybe maybe uh uh some have uh just aired in spirit maybe they've gone through some things kind of like nebuchadnezzar went through and they've been lost for a few years but but there comes an end to that there comes a beginning to it and then there comes an end to it and i believe somebody's reaching the end of their days no longer walking in the wilderness amen you got a position that god has called you to glory to god but you got to realize it's not about you it's about christ when you come amen to the like he did at the end of the days i nebuchadnezzar lifted up my eyes into heaven and mine understanding returned unto me and i blessed the most high and i praised and honored him that liveth forever man whose dominion is in everlasting dominion and his kingdom is from generation to generation and all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth and none can stay his hand or say unto him what does thou you don't ask god questions amen at the same time my reason returned unto me and for the glory of my kingdom my honor and brightness returned unto me and my counselors and my lord sought unto me and i was established in my kingdom and excellent majesty was added unto me now i nebuchadnezzar pray see that now after you got the update after you got the system changed now i nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honor the king of heaven he realized his place amen i honor the king of heaven all whose works are truth and his ways judgment and those that walk in pride those that walk in pride he is able to abase nebuchadnezzar went through this he realized something needed to change on the inside of him in his heart he needed to go through an update he needed to go through an upgrade amen they need to go through a system change glory to god he realized no matter how high you were amen if you ever get too lifted up god is able to bring you down oh i don't ever want to get lifted up amen i i thank god for what he has done for us i really do appreciate the lord but i don't want to get lifted up even as we move into our new church a new school we don't want to get lifted up we want to stay humble in the presence of god glory you know that that was that that was one of the main reasons that we started the seven a.m morning prayer uh you know when god blessed us to come from the first building to to to the building we just left we i say lord we got to give you more we can't give you less you've blessed us now let us give you more and that's when god birthed that seven am prayer in my spirit and for 13 years that prayer has been going i thank god for the saints that were able to make it out this morning oh it blesses my heart amen i come in i see sister dixon off she's the first member of the church amen and i see her coming and getting in prayer glory that means so much to me hallelujah amen stay humble stay humble glory glory glory nebuchadnezzar needed a change in the heart and after he got the change in our heart he was able to put his put himself in the proper perspective he realized it was all about god he was praising and extolling and honoring the king of heaven no more was he talking about what he accomplished but he was talking about what god had done i want to uh also share amen just another uh example i think in scripture of uh where god actually gave an upgrade to the kingdom of israel amen an upgrade is a complete change out pretty much right uh you know when you move from that old cop to that new car you've upgraded the car amen you've moved from the old suit to a new suit you you've upgraded the suit moved from an old dress to a new dress you've upgraded in your wardrobe it's an upgrade a complete change a new look here you know israel went through an upgrade they had their first king by the name of saul amen and and so my god was uh uh was a man was not a good king he might have been the first king and and there was a time in saul's life where you saw god had done something in his heart even when he met the prophet the prophet saying now uh you're going to see this group of men they're going to be a school of prophets and you're going to start prophesying like them the anointing that come on saul he felt that anointing and he was a new man he was a different man hallelujah but for some reason saul couldn't stay with it glory he couldn't stay with it and when the prophet began to give him a man a certain instructions all can stay with the instructions amen hallelujah now now uh saul is what we would call a man a a rebellious king glory amen but when god decided to take saul off the throne he brought in david and upgrades because david was considered a man after god's own hearts hallelujah so israel went through an upgrade and let me tell you something when it's time to go through the upgrade or to go through the update don't be afraid of what god is getting ready to do here we see saul amen in 1st samuel chapter 15 glory we call him a rebellious king first samuel chapter 15 verse 22. this is he was supposed to uh kill all the animals and and do all these things that they probably told him and and he'd say well i got afraid because the people were leaving and you hadn't come at the time that you said you was coming so i i i just kind of forced myself i forced myself to do these things because i thought the people would leave he said no you should have never done that he's saying he began to rebuke he began to rebuke saul for what he had done hallelujah look at this this rebuke oh help us lord some of us don't want to be rebuked amen we don't want that when we do something wrong we don't want to be rebuked amen we don't want nobody to tell us that we're wrong amen we don't want nobody to tell us that's not godly that wasn't that wasn't right what you did you don't want to hear things like that this this why kids rise up against their parents oh i'm telling the truth in it huh because they don't want nobody to tell them that they're wrong see we live in a society that that done made some things real bad i was at lunch with some guys this week i'm gonna come to that scripture a little bit i was at some lunch with some guys this week and they would talk about how they would go to different competitions with their their little uh nephews or nieces or whatever and in the competition you know and i saw this happen with my my own nephew when we he used to be in taekwondo you go to the competition and he go and he beat this person real good and then at the end of the whole thing they come out and give the loser a trophy and they give the winner a trophy they give them both like there was no difference in what just happened out here now you lost you get no trophy for losing see see we don't we don't we don't we don't uh we don't make people soft right we don't make them soft they expect to lose and still get rewarded no you can't lose and get rewarded what you need to do is practice and get better what's the difference here if we all going to get a reward why do we even have the word winning and losing in our vocabulary right so so you know it's just it's something the way that the psyche that they've placed on man and they're making us weaker and we cry because we lost no you don't cry because you lost you you you you get tough let me use that word i don't want to say do you you get tough tough in your mind amen you get out and you start really working on your craft until you get better losers don't win championships praise the lord glory to god but by here you know we what what's happened is that we we've we've stopped in people and just kind of and and nobody nobody want to be told that you was wrong nobody want to be told we only want to speak positive words and this positive you lost but you can get better if you practice you can do i i see it in you but you got to practice hallelujah glory to god you be ready for them next time all right amen but we're not going to reward you for losing amen so uh here we see amen in first samuel 15. this man saul was known as a rebellious king and i want you to catch this now and samuel said verse 22 in uh first 15 and samuel said hath the lord as great delight and burnt offerings and sacrifices now notice this man right you know because we're like you know i i we we killed the animals and we sacrificed we got the best of the animals we sacrificed he thought he was doing god a favor but he got a strong rebuke you're not doing god no favor god is always doing you favors listen and as samuel said have the lord as great delight and burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the lord behold to obey glory is better than sacrifice so this is what god wants from you he wants your obedience amen hallelujah in every area of your life god wants your obedience to obey us better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams and look at what the next verse says for rebellion this is a this is this is this is a a dangerous thing to get involved in rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and look at the next one and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry because thou has rejected whoo the word of the lord he has also rejected thee from being king he got a downgrade because he wouldn't follow the word of god you know you can be at a certain level in your life and god just using you and using using you and if you guys if you allow yourself to get lifted up like nebuchadnezzar did next thing you know you get a downgrade here we see this in the life of king saul amen uh he because of his disobedience to the word of god the prophet had given him a exact thing to do but he refused to do it he didn't want to do it the prophet's way he wanted to do it his way i want to tell you something when we get caught in a situation like that i want you to remember something the bible declares there is a way that seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death i want to read stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry idolatry uh this uh i'm gonna pull a quote from the message god being misunderstood i just added this one to the back amen this morning god being misunderstood and and the word stubbornness it means dogged determination not to change one's attitude or dog determination not to change one's position on something i'm determined not to change i i don't care what brother jack say i'm determined not to change and whoever else get in the pulpit i'm determined stubbornness [Music] and here the bible says stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry now you can be you can be a full-fledged christian but still have a stubborn spirit we're going to read this quote oh god we need to we we need to be stripped of some things we want an upgrade we want an update as we go into this next season oh glory take everything in me that's not like you if i got some bugs inside of me some unexpected results that keep happening over and over again take that stuff out of me i need an update here in this message god being misunderstood brother branham i am saved and have been baptized in the name of jesus christ how but how do i get away from a stubborn spirit that i can't seem to break away from now now i want you to just get that because he's saying the person said i'm saved that's good and i've been baptized the name of the lord jesus christ now they didn't say they had the holy ghost but they did say they was baptized the name lord jesus christ right but now watch this he says well my christian brother or sister whoever it may be now most times when you find people that's got stubborn spirits he says it's usually a complex that causes this so when you see somebody with a stubborn spirit and not not willing to change amen to make adjustments even after they hear the word of god that's why i say sister waiting when she heard the word she applied it immediately before she left the ground she was trying to apply the word of god she wanted to be like jesus it says that my christian brother sister whoever it may be now most times when you find people that's got stubborn spirits it's usually a complex that causes this either they have inherited it oh glory to god oh i thank god for a prophet amen you trying to get free from your stubborn spirit are you trying to how did this thing get them it came from your mama it came from your daddy it came from your grandma it came from your granddaddy you inherited a stubborn spirit oh my god most of us want to inherit money to god we want to inherit those things but no recognize that there are certain characteristics that you got glory to god you was born with them characteristics and it's going to take the holy ghost to set you free from it you inherited a stubborn spirit my either they inherited from a mother look at this a father look at what the brothers say a uncle a uncle you can get a stubborn spirit from an uncle a aunt grandmother grandfather somebody like that and if you'll chase back down through your life now i've taken it by experience under discernment because i have met cases on the platform thousands of those that have that spirit and the first thing you know i chased that spirit right back by discernment and find that there was a granddaddy there was a grandmother there was somebody else back down there and you inherit that by nature you know sometimes your grandparents might have gone through certain experiences raised in a different era my times were different when they was coming up right so so so so they look at life totally different than the way that you look at life but if you're trying to actually follow in their footsteps you're inheriting a spirit who some of us come from you know uh i i got i got roots in alabama i got roots i got family roots in alabama but there are some things that have happened in the past in alabama that weren't so good and so some of my family from alabama some of the stuff that they experienced or maybe they saw their parents experience they like no no we don't trust this we don't trust that we don't want this we don't want that but then you don't realize if you if you take on that nature you take on those conversations you begin to inherit a spirit that's being passed down through your family and when it comes to this message glory to god when it comes to this message jesus can i just be honest with you amen you know i mean because you know we come through the air my parents come through the area of the days of martin luther king and brother brandon when he made a statement about martin luther king oh my goodness how that shook us in the message martin luther king don't lead his people to a slaughter we're thinking ourself how can a prophet say that about a good man like martin luther king it shook us to our core but we had to realize the prophet was not saying anything racist we had to come to that understand that what he said it was spiritual and if you look back over the over life now you look back you look back you look back you can see some things where amen our people have actually lost some spiritual things the prophet saw that and he called it out glory to god glory to god amen amen amen amen that dream that martin luther king had will never be accomplished unless people get the holy ghost amen look here you got to watch those spears that come through your your parents and your grandparents and your uncle talking to your uncle talking to your auntie it's a spirit being passed down and this message it shakes off it just shakes all that stuff down oh my god that's why you can you can fellowship here and you know i had a cousin looking online like man it's all kind of people in the church yeah that's the way it's supposed to be god made a big bouquet of people and we're supposed to be able to come together like that and all love one another amen no no no uh big eye little you no culture greater than another culture we're all god's people call to this message oh blessed be the name of the lord oh i thank god for this amen go just about anywhere in the world and preach and feel right at home no matter no matter what the the the ratios is feel right at home oh blessed be the name of the lord all right i'm i i see that there's a spirit i know that passes down through my family amen but the holy ghost breaks that spirit man look at this he says when he traced he chased it down i chased that spirit right back by discernment and found that there was a granddaddy there was a grandmother there was somebody else back down there and you inherit that by nature says stubbornness is not of god it's not of god so when you get a stubborn spirit you know that god did not anoint you with that spirit and let me tell you something we all from the pulpit to the top riser we all have to fight the spirit of stubbornness we all want our way amen but it's stubbornness is a dog determination not to change your attitude and not to change your position on something it's not of god stubbornness is not of god and now the only way to get away from that is you have to overcome faith you have to have you have to have faith to overcome that that's if you're a christian you are a son or daughter of god whichever you may be and you will never be able to just stand and rebuke it and rebuke it and rebuke it now notice what he said you just can't stand there i rebuke this stuff and spirit i rebuke this you can't you can't stand and do it like that it'll never leave pastor pray for me i got a stubborn spirit rebuking that we get the oil out poured on you we repute this stuff and spear the name of jesus in order to stay right there the prophet gives us insight tells us how to overcome a stubborn spirit tells us how to get an update look at this look at this look at this amen he says um uh now the only way to get away from that is is you have to have faith to overcome that that's if you're a christian you're a son or daughter of god whichever you may be and you will never be able to just stand and rebuke it and rebuke it and rebuke him it's just like tantalizing a rattlesnake he's laying there ready to bite you and if you will just ignore him what wisdom if you would just ignore him and walk away from him he can't hurt you see so when you feel that you got a stubborn spirit lay the thing on the altar and believe god that the thing is dead and you'll never have it no more sometimes you just got to act differently [Music] you gotta act different you and you know that thing is there but you just gotta you gotta hold jesus i act like it ain't there because it's a spirit from hell trying to trouble you amen you just got to ignore it look at that he says he says um when you feel that uh you got that stubborn spirit lay the thing on the altar and believe god that the thing is dead and you will never have it no more and go on and don't even pay any attention to it no more and the thing will leave you not even praying over it rebuking it it'll actually go on its own because you ignored them so when you take on the submarine's fear it's because you choose to you choose to be stubborn you choose to act like that oh it's just i just got a devil no you accepted that devil into your life you welcome that devil lean come on church see we're trying to have an update in the heart oh yes lord amen look at what it says now it says lay the thing on the altar and believe god that the thing is dead and you will never have it no more and go on and don't even pay any attention to it no more and the thing will leave you resist the devil and he will flee from you that's get away quickly so that would be my advice to how to overcome it we overcome the devil by faith that's what we overcome all evil is by faith you know i remember um we were at the first church building after we left our our home um we moved into the place in green acres amen and and we were there and and and just so many so many wonderful memories you know from that five years of being there and one of those uh memories was they had a a shop right next door to us it was a clothing store and uh the people would be there and sell their clothes and and um and and and one day we just got to talking to the young man that was there i think it was his mother's shop and he was there running things for his mom and we got to talk to me and my dad got to talking to him and and he just began to open up so much and and just just you know talk about how you want to live for the lord and all these other things and you know we just keep planting seeds keep planting seeds and one day he uh he came over he's like you know i really want to do this but i just can't stop smoking i just have a problem with smoking i just can't stop smoking i i i i won't i want to i want to live right but i just can't stop it so uh you know at that point in time i knew to stop talking and i knew i let my daddy talk because my daddy had balanced smoking for years and i knew that god had gave him given him the ability to overcome a man smoking my even when daddy got sick and you know and cancer was attacking his body he had a revelation he said you know what uh i know i smoked and i could have brought damage to my body he said but i asked god to forgive me and said that and as a as a father he's my heavenly father he will not allow me to suffer from the things that i did wrong he actually forgave me for it i said my what a revelation he said he won't let me suffer so i won't receive cancer you know in my lungs i won't receive that because my my father has forgiven me of that i say amen dad right and and i saw my dad multiple times get healed of cancer and he used uh natural means but he was healed of cancer multiple times i saw it with my own eyes the doctor's report showed it that he got he had been ill but he was standing on the revelation so i remember that young man said i just can't overcome you know smoking and uh and my dad my dad said he looked at the young man he says uh he says uh you know you are larger than i am you know i'm a small man and you're a little bit larger than i am he says uh if you were to walk up to me and push me as large as you are and based on my side of this if you were to walk up to me and push me he said you'll probably be able to push me right down right down no problem at all because of your size he says but if i just offered a little bit of resistance just a little bit of resistance he said i don't think you'd be able to get me down and my dad is you know late 60s at this time he said if i just offer just a little resistance even though you come stronger than i am and you push me i just offer a little resistance i don't think you'll be able to get me down not that easy and he said that's what you got to do when it comes to this smoking spirit just off a little bit of resistance if you resist the devil he'll flee that's all you got i don't care what you're going through this morning if you would just offer the devil a little bit of resistance a little just a no just know i ain't doing that no i eventually you're not gonna get real strong but you just gotta put up a little bit of resistance when it comes to a stubborn spirit a little bit of resistance act different do something different respond differently that spirit will just leave you amen hallelujah let me see i want to um let me bring in two other thoughts here and i want to move to something else here updates um oh my they happen all the time as long as the the business or the software the church the person as long as they're living as long as it's still being used in these updates it needs updates so we don't we don't we don't run from it we welcome him and uh here you know i want to just kind of show the church itself received update it was you know uh in the days of luther luther came out with the message that just shall live by faith we call that justification right and in those days luther was preaching that message and why my what a wonderful message it was it went contrary to what the catholic church was teaching and here god was actually updating the church with the message of martin luther but you know martin luther still smoke pipes and all these things like that so god had to actually a man send another update glory to build on the foundation of justification he sent wesley with the message of sanctification amen and and and and as he begin to preach that no we're not going to keep smoking we're not going to keep drinking we're not going to keep doing that we got to live a sanctified life before god i'm not going to be looking at ladies and lusting after them amen i'm not going to be looking at men and lusting after them i gotta live sanctified uh uh here wesley began to preach the message of signification that was an update to the church but after that you know after justification technication god sent another update the baptism of the holy ghost amen and that's what was poured out at azusa street amen uh uh william seymour believing that god would visit his people again and kept praying and kept and kept believing god till they got a mighty outpouring on azusa street god sent that as an update to the church but it did not stop there amen now it's the holy ghost himself becoming one with us the very person brother branham makes this statement in the message the masterpiece hallelujah the church has constantly been receiving these updates amen look at this he says notice here the life that was in the husk in the stalk and in the tassel in the husk all gathers in the seed and the light that was in the stalk went on uh went one went to make the other justification hallelujah made a way for sanctification an update amen sanctification made a way for the baptism of the holy ghost that's another update the baptism of the holy ghost glory made a way for the holy ghost itself to come right down in perfection back to the word again to manifest itself he goes says but what what denominated dies like a like a life loot like life in luther went to mate wesley and from wesley went to pentecost and from pentecost to make the original seed on the pentecost comes out of wesley until that time the reason that pentecost come out of wesley because it had it was no denomination pentecost was the pentecost went to denominate and what did it do it turned to the house it turned it looked like the real thing so it had to continue to go through updates till it got back to the original this is where we are church god brought us out of lutheran god brought us out of you know the methodist teachers that's what wesley was to the methodist organization amen and then after after that god raised up the pentecostals but god brought us out of pentecost and he brought us to this original word the original seed the updates have brought us back to this same spot again the original again we thank god for the update oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah i was i was saying to myself luther uh went to wesley wesley to pentecost pentecost to a prophet coming to open up the word and every time that every time a season changed god was updating and i want to also let you know underneath the seven church ages it was updates happening from the first eighth church age to the second to the third to the fourth to the fifth to the sixth to the seventh it was another update every time a new message would come god was sending an update to the church glory to god we were moving from different anointings from the lion anointing to the ox anointed to the man anointed to the eagle anointing the prophetic anointing we have been updated thank god for each and every update can i get a scripture out of matthew 18. i told you we're looking for those 20s this is spirit and truth 2.0 we're looking for those 20s amen and we found one in matthew 18. thank you jesus oh hallelujah thank you lord jesus my god my god my god look at this in matthew 18 verse 18 says verily i say unto you whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and west of you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven and again i say unto you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven here's that verse 20. glory for where two or three are gathered together in my name there am i in the midst of them thank god that he has been in the midst for 20 years no matter how many of us were gathering he has proven that he was in the midst oh hallelujah let's look at this statement out of spiritual adoption amen this quote from spiritual adoption the prophet makes this statement he says sometimes god meets in different councils of man god has always loved to counsel with man and many times in the old testament how we could go back to find how god met with man and regardless of their numbers god meets with man he met one time with 500 and he met again with 70 he met again with the 12. he met once with three and then he met again just with one and regardless of the number of the council god always loved to meet loves to meet with man so even though the church this morning may not be as large in congregation or in size as many great cathedrals today but god will be pleased to meet with us amen for he said wherever two or three are gathered in my name i'll be in their midst two or three will gather my name i'll be in the midst of that two or three church i can go back in my mind and amen and think of various services that we had and oftentimes we go down this path uh you all have different thoughts that come in your head glory amen of how god has proven himself to be in our midst i remember when we were in the old church uh there at green acres and i remember uh man the spirit of god got to moving so rich in the place uh one of her sisters had you know was was was really getting caught up and she was about to pass out in the spirit you just you can just see she getting ready to sway she's swearing she get ready to go so one of the other sisters went and grabbed his sheet and she got got the sheet and she walked up towards the sister to go try to lay the sheet on her to be a help tool and before you knew it she she got to feeling something she needed to sheet for herself just a pal god just contagious amen just moving all over the sanctuary i mean it was just it was just a a a blessing oh my amen i remember a service where you know uh the sermon i think that i preached he drew me out of many water amen and and just talk about how god uh just chose us out of all the other people in the earth that he could have chose he chose us to bring us to this truth he drew me out of many water brother mike mike woodfolk was there and he just got to shout in the middle of the aisle didn't know what to do ran up to the front of the church grabbed my bible and said come on i'm taking you to the office i say i can t i can carry my own bible no i got it by pastor no i said i'll take my own no no i no pasta i said i'm gonna be your own bear i say i only know i'm a beer but he was just underneath the anointing i'll let him kiss it didn't let me carry for the day and i won't do it no more i said go ahead and carry it brother i remember being a man over in the church that we just left in so many wonderful services but i remember amen we had those meetings and and uh brother um uh brother lawson that preached a sermon about uh uh kind of living underneath our privileges and and he preached that sermon good god almighty the church was just tore up and as they were they were just worshipping and everything i i gave them mic to brother westco brother my brother wesker got up there and he just began to uh just just be himself boy he don't he don't get a devil no break people shouting and jumping all over the place and that service that got so loose brother brother simba let out let that one you start dancing out there on the on the front row i mean we was we was having a time god has proven that he has been in our midst just a few years ago i i i want to say just a few years ago just uh sister rebecca being there on the piano and and we're going just had a prayer line i don't know what we just did just praying and while she down the piano all of a sudden the spirit of the lord hit her and she began to prophesy oh the spirit of the lord has proven that he has been here wherever two or three are gathered in my name there am i in the midst of them we've seen god we've experienced god we know this is of god oh hallelujah amen amen amen let me uh oh my just a little something here i don't think i'm gonna be able to get it i'll save it i want to just show how even in brother brandon's ministry he received updates god gave him a first pull god gave him a second pull god gave him a third pull and every time he got a new pool in this ministry it was an update it was an improvement it was a better experience oh hallelujah let me just read maybe from the anointed ones at the end time revelations 10 said in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel now remember seventh laodicea church age the sounding of that angel when that church age is done denominated and become a church age when it's done in its pentecostal organization when the messenger to that what was each messenger what was martin luther a rebuke to the catholic what was wesley a rebuke to them lutherans what was the pentecost a rebuke to them others where has the life gone now away from an no more shuck it's the grain what is it a rebuke to the pentecost see to fulfill the scripture of this hour see i think about this you know uh you all might not realize you are rebuked to the pentecostals you know the pentecostals used to dress the way you dress they used to look the way you look but now they don't have that they got a form of godliness but they deny the power of the keeping gospel hallelujah amen you are a rebuke to them every time you walk out i was walking up here to the church and i see two churches here and i'm watching the way some dress to go in one church and the way dressed the way others are dressed to go to another church since these sisters stand as a rebuke to the others hallelujah and they won't be able to say that they didn't know truth they saw truth walk in perform every sunday hallelujah they can see they see through the windows they see you walking up they can see it amen i remember if somebody came into the church and they saw how everybody was dressed they said i think i'm at the wrong church [Music] just by looking at the way the sisters were dressed i think i'm at the wrong church you probably are if you don't want an update let me just keep reading i'm almost there notice the very day when this messenger not when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message see the first pull healing second pull prophesying or or actually we can call it uh discernment it was an update right second prophesied third pull another update the opening of the word the mysteries revealed no more there's no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets that's my god i love that no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets but the only way the prophet can be vindicated is by the word that's why we believe his message because god promised it in the word and remember the third paul was the opening of them seven seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word do you see it it is then and that day when this thing is to take place that janus and jamborees the impersonators will appear again just like they did when moses appeared with the original word to say it they appeared to impersonate it just exactly right now you see what matthew 24 24 is see anointed once every time god took the prophet's ministry from one level to the next level to the next level it was an update the man didn't change just an update to his ministry and i want to tell you god has taken us these 20 years to another level and we're receiving an update i want to welcome it with all my heart i don't want to be stubborn and stuck in my ways i want to welcome what god got for me next because i didn't even think god had this for me but for god to god to call me to this and allow me to be a part of it i just want to give him all the glory all the honor i never want to get lifted up like nebuchadnezzar this is not amen uh anything brother jack did this is all god let me just share a little testimony here i i'm gonna pull out i got some more notes here amen that i wanted to kind of bring but i i don't think i'll have time to hit it so i will oh lord i i can't i can't i can't i might go in overtime y'all just bear with me i want to share this i want to share this another update was when joshua led the people into the promised land it was update not an upgrade the reason i say it was an upgrade moses brought the people out of egypt but joshua took them into the promised land and the reason it was an update is because you cannot upgrade from a prophet you can't upgrade from a prophet that's god's highest order of revealing things so you only update but you never upgrade the prophet provides the original code and we simply complete what was originally started amen israel didn't come out of egypt just to wander in the wilderness they had a promised land awaiting we didn't forsake the world and denomination to simply wander around the message there's a rapture a changing of the body that's awaiting us amen as moses brought them out joshua took them in glory to god the amen and i want to say this uh as as the message that god gave brother branham brought us out of denomination brought us out of the world brought us out of state it's the holy ghost that is here now to take us in the holy ghost is our joshua today who is taking us into the promised land our prophet will be one of the dead in christ who will rise and present us to jesus let me read a little something here oh i i yes i'm gonna read this as i was with moses so i'll be with thee look at this says and as we find joshua to take this commission knowing the responsibilities was was uh leading them through the land through lands now that he have to go over into other land he'd have to set up the kingdom he'd have to divide the inheritance among them he know the commission was tremendous far more than what moses had done joshua had more to do than moses had to do another thing he was to lead them along the border amongst their brethren and they'd already tasted blood he had to conquer them he had to keep them quiet as they marched on so is it today with the new pentecostal group that's rising up they've tasted denominationalism it's so hard to keep them there now this is what the message you know uh was to try to pull us out of denominations god was upgrading when he pulled us out of pentecost when he pulled us out of baptist when he pulled us out of methodist when he pulled us out of catholic it was an upgrade a spiritual upgrade brother random says you know in this quote he says it's hard to keep them there people that taste denominationalism they always want to go back to it and when they get there they realize how how uh it's it just does it doesn't taste good the experience is not good when you get there it don't take them long to realize this is a mess i don't i don't got myself involved in something i should i know better than this it don't take him long look when god give you an update and upgrade don't go back don't take a downgrade keep following following god i want to do more for you i was just thinking about this uh brother adam you know when he preached the message services of time he talked about six dreams and one vision and brother bila had a dream and it talked about the cattle wanting to go the way of least resistance oh my god church this is where we are because the cattle represent the church they want to go the way of least resistance they want to go the easy way out they don't want to be rebuked they don't want to admit that they're wrong they don't want that they want that easy way out so the easy way out sometimes produce a stubborn spirits y'all see the circle we're back in there now right but sometimes the easy way out produce a stubborn spirit this is why some people they don't want they don't want to own up to it they don't want to be told they're wrong they don't want headship they don't want that amen they run from that they'll do everything against that don't tell me what to do right but that's the wrong spirit it's a wrong spirit here you know um brother bill would say he saw that the cattle they wanted to go the way of least resistance said but brother branham told us to keep the cattle on this side and and what i mean by keeping the cat on this side that mean keep the cattle away from denomination and here just a little statement i won't read the whole quote so that's the way we hunt for the lord and the food for the lord through difficult we always go through difficult we don't we don't go the way of least resistance we actually go the harder way you say they say it says uh and that's the way and i'm coming to standing in the gap you can get that one lined up it's the last one i have over there it says uh it says um and that's the way we hunt for the lord and the food of the lord through difficult rounding up the cattle was this church keeping them on that side cattle will actually go on the smooth road the denomination if they can which the road represented denomination we're doing everything we can to keep the cattle on this side grazing in these lands where this message is being preached keep the cattle on this side some of you all had to leave some very very tough situations i i i i just thank god for this some of y'all went through some tremendous trials before you came here to spiritual tooth tabernacle some of y'all had to make some tough choices some of y'all was criticized by by everybody but you have to withstand the criticism and you have allowed god to prove that your decision was right can i can i can i just share just a little encouragement from this message standing in the gap and what this was was this after after sermon one time brother branham preached this man walked up to him said man that could have been the 22nd chapter of revelation as he was talking he just started speaking and talks and when he started speaking in tongues three people rose up real quick saying oh that one tongues that was perfect french and brother branham says it was he said okay you go over there to your corner you write out what he said you go to another corner you write out what he said you go to the other corner you write out what he said and bring it back to me when they brought the words back to the prophet can i just read it because this is for you this is for you i know you made some tough decisions from heart and even you withstanding criticism right now but i got good news for you look at this in this message standing in the gap i'm going right to paragraph 136 oh oh i can't let me just read i victor lee do i am a full-blooded frenchman born again christian filled with the holy spirit my spirit my address is 809 north king road los angeles 46. i attend the bethel temple pastor arne vick pastor a true translation that i proclaimed a prophecy said over brother branham given by danny henry in french february the 11th 1961 reason i had to read that because february 11th is my daughter's birthday alexandria's birthday and this happened on her birthday right february 11 1961 at the full gospel businessmen's breakfast a true translation of the prophecy now here's what it said because thou has chosen the narrow way hallelujah oh my the harder way thou has walked in your own choosing nobody made you do this but you chose the harder way thou has walked the night on jesus jesus says now i can see that moses had to make his choice too see thou has picked the precise and correct way correct decision and it is my way it says underline my way the holy spirit speaking back it says because of this momentous decision a huge portion of heaven awaits you awaits thee my it says what a glorious decision now listen close he said what a glorious decision thou hast made this in itself is that the decision that you made to worship in spirit and in truth this in itself is that which will make and come to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine [Music] i got confident you don't have to prove nothing you just stay salty they'll get thirsty before you know what you'll see a family member sitting right next to the same ones that was criticizing you about coming to the church you'll see them sitting next to you underneath the same ministry this in itself the decision in itself will make come the past a tremendous victory in love divine oh my oh my well i'm gonna stop i got i got so much more that i need to share but i can't get it all out and even in two services i got another one i got to come back with but this just in my spirit the spirit of truth 2.0 don't be stubborn allow god to do an update do something different in this season hallelujah hallelujah let's pray oh my father we thank you jesus what a just uh just the way that you present yourself to us how we just appreciate it we can hear the voice of our savior calling out to us speaking to us god we we yield ourselves to this update we don't want to be uh like nebuchadnezzar get lifted up in our hearts we want to stay humble in your presence god we don't want to be like king saul lord who did just just did not have the understanding he was doing all kinds of sacrifices but he failed to be obedient we don't want to be sacrificing and doing this but we want to we want to obey the word of god we want to obey the voice of god the bible say the day that you hear my voice heart and not your heart [Music] you've proven lord god just to be a part of this uh this this little group of people you have proven father that

best obedience is better than any sacrifice continue to deal with our hearts continue to let the spirit lord reformat us and upgrade us and update us and whatever it is that we need in our lives do
