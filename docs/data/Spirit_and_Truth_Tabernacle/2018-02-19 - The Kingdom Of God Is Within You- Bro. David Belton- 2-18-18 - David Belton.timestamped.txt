[1:16:22] pray and we thank you amen
[1:16:24] they may not have you standing too long
[1:16:27] let us go right into the word of the
[1:16:28] Lord in amen the Book of Luke 16
[1:16:41] Luke 16 Luke 16 beginning at verse 16
[1:16:47] Luke 16 and then Luke 17 Luke 16 it says
[1:16:52] verse 16 the law and the prophets were
[1:16:55] until John since that time the kingdom
[1:16:59] of God is preached and every man presses
[1:17:02] into it they meant at the seventeenth
[1:17:06] chapter verse 20 and when he was
[1:17:10] demanded of the Pharisees when the
[1:17:12] kingdom of God should come he answered
[1:17:14] them and said the kingdom of God cometh
[1:17:17] not with observation neither shall they
[1:17:21] say lo here or lo there for behold the
[1:17:24] kingdom of God is within you and he said
[1:17:27] under disciples the days will come when
[1:17:29] you said his are to see one of the days
[1:17:31] of the Son of Man and you should not see
[1:17:33] it and they should say to you see here
[1:17:36] or see there go not after them nor
[1:17:39] follow them for a lightning that shine
[1:17:43] it out of the one part under heaven
[1:17:45] China than to the other part under
[1:17:47] heaven so she also the Son of Man be in
[1:17:51] his day but first must he suffer many
[1:17:56] things and be rejected of this
[1:17:57] generation and as it was in the days of
[1:18:00] Noah so it certainly be also in the days
[1:18:02] of the son of man they did eat they
[1:18:04] drank they married wives they were given
[1:18:07] in marriage until the day that Noah
[1:18:09] entered in it all and the flood came and
[1:18:11] destroyed them all likewise also as it
[1:18:15] was in the days of lot they did eat they
[1:18:17] drank they bought they sold they planted
[1:18:19] they builded but the same day that lot
[1:18:22] went out of Sodom it rained fire
[1:18:25] brimstone from heaven and destroyed them
[1:18:28] all even thou shall it be in the day
[1:18:32] when the Son of Man is revealed a man
[1:18:35] made a lot of the blessing today
[1:18:36] remember his words you may be seated
[1:18:40] amen so we are we have a subject here I
[1:18:47] don't I don't think I ever preached this
[1:18:50] here
[1:18:52] but it's a subject the kingdom of God is
[1:18:55] within you the kingdom of God is within
[1:19:00] you
[1:19:04] amen and we see as as Luke tells us here
[1:19:09] the law and the prophets weren't to John
[1:19:13] from that time the kingdom of God is
[1:19:17] preached and every man presses into it
[1:19:21] it is it don't come easy it is not on a
[1:19:25] silver platter it's not with a silver
[1:19:28] spoon but there's a press you got in
[1:19:32] other words you have to be diligent you
[1:19:34] have to be persistent amen you a
[1:19:37] minister even the Prophet went beyond
[1:19:39] the time things are told him pressed
[1:19:42] Avada keep on pressing hallelujah and
[1:19:47] then they begin to tell us whatever you
[1:19:49] do get perfect of no one will enter
[1:19:53] without it and we know that perfect love
[1:19:56] faith worketh by love you know we were
[1:19:59] sharing back home of few subjects
[1:20:03] perfect relationship and perfect
[1:20:05] fellowship perfect faith perfect love we
[1:20:09] share in perfection and we see that
[1:20:12] we're in the age of perfection we're an
[1:20:15] age where every seed is bringing forth
[1:20:18] of his kind
[1:20:19] we're in our age where is time up for
[1:20:23] anything that's fake
[1:20:24] amen it's time to be real many play
[1:20:28] church many claim to be Christians but
[1:20:31] God is looking at the heart and their
[1:20:35] life amen
[1:20:36] it must be a manifested life and that
[1:20:39] hidden life must be in Christ now here
[1:20:42] as we see they demanded unto the Lord
[1:20:46] Jesus Christ when the kingdom of God
[1:20:48] shall come and he began to tell them the
[1:20:51] kingdom of God cometh not with
[1:20:53] observation in other words is not an
[1:20:56] outlet chill Amen praise the Lord in
[1:21:00] other words it
[1:21:01] is no output out with manifestation it's
[1:21:05] not revealed to the public
[1:21:07] praise the Lord his hidden head man
[1:21:11] oh praise the Living God it reminds me
[1:21:14] of Sam you first said that the Bible
[1:21:16] said in daisa Sam Nia there was no open
[1:21:18] vision right it was not revealed to the
[1:21:22] public but now we see we must understand
[1:21:25] this reason
[1:21:26] now now now keep in mind about was that
[1:21:29] without a vision the people perish now
[1:21:32] in other words without a redemptive
[1:21:34] revelation or without a prophetic
[1:21:36] message to people perish and that word
[1:21:41] perish it means also means they run Wow
[1:21:47] it also means they are naked
[1:21:51] so without or a dipped of Revelation the
[1:21:54] people run Wow they are naked that's the
[1:21:58] Word of God they are wandering the Bible
[1:22:02] say a wandering spirit is like one that
[1:22:04] worship among the dead you know that's
[1:22:07] what the Bible said but Jesus come to
[1:22:10] tell you then you'll say lo here or lo
[1:22:13] there lo he's in the mountain you know
[1:22:19] sunset sunset mountain go to sunset to

[1:23:04] God that's what is all about the
[1:23:06] prophets and my ministers to declare
[1:23:08] that he's here who Christ is here and
[1:23:11] Christ is the theme of the whole ba ba
[1:23:13] the principal theme hey man I'm afraid
[1:23:17] they're getting two people to church but
[1:23:19] not to Christ but we must be in Christ
[1:23:22] so where we get them to the message but
[1:23:25] together to get them to Christ the

[1:29:17] life once you recognize if you haven't
[1:29:19] recognized the kingdom of God is within
[1:29:22] you
[1:29:23] head man oh praise the Living God let's
[1:29:27] look at this kingdom amen are you glad
[1:29:29] I'm glad to be a part of crisis a part
[1:29:33] of him before the foundation of the
[1:29:35] world you know uh you know as the
[1:29:38] Prophet taught us he so we are now
[1:29:40] worshiping under the Feast of
[1:29:42] Tabernacles and we will get in a nap
[1:29:44] that after a while because we remember
[1:29:47] the woman when Jesus went to the woman
[1:29:51] at the well that's his turn now let's
[1:29:59] read some
[1:30:04] you are telling either God want to show
[1:30:07] you what we had we're in the seventh age
[1:30:09] where we are worshipping under the feast
[1:30:11] of tabernacle no we will finish it up in
[1:30:13] the Millennium but now we're worshipping
[1:30:16] now under the Feast of Tabernacles we
[1:30:18] should be in worship I love the worship
[1:30:22] in the singing worship is not just sing
[1:30:25] you know worship to God is really a life
[1:30:28] a dedicated life to Him
[1:30:31] and and they said the word worship is
[1:30:34] the greatest function it's the greatest
[1:30:37] function that any creature can perform
[1:30:43] the greatest function that any creature
[1:30:46] not just us but any creature that
[1:30:49] animals have their way of worship amen
[1:30:52] hallelujah
[1:30:53] [Applause]
[1:30:56] talking about bhakti amen a restoring
[1:31:00] has begun amen first Joan excuse me
[1:31:03] Saint John for st. John for let's just
[1:31:11] start at verse 21 Jesus hasn't had a
[1:31:16] woman believe it's me now I will cometh
[1:31:19] when we should neither ye shall neither
[1:31:22] in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem
[1:31:25] worship the father ye worship you know
[1:31:30] not what we know what we worship for
[1:31:33] salvation is of the Jews but they are
[1:31:37] cometh and now is when the true
[1:31:40] worshipers shall worship the father in
[1:31:43] spirit and in truth for the father
[1:31:47] seeketh such to worship Him God is a
[1:31:51] spirit and they that worship Him must
[1:31:54] worship Him in spirit and in truth
[1:31:57] that's what we're trying to say the
[1:32:00] kingdom of God is within you
[1:32:03] now now remember Israel made their
[1:32:07] greatest mistake because they what they
[1:32:09] chose law over grace he chose law for
[1:32:14] grace
[1:32:15] that's the worst mistake that they had
[1:32:18] made but here we as a people for what
[1:32:24] God has given us we should be on fire
[1:32:29] for God that's what we see I'm on fire
[1:32:32] there's a farm you know Jeremiah said a
[1:32:35] water Lord is like fire shut up in my
[1:32:38] bones you should never let the spirit
[1:32:41] revived or die
[1:32:42] hey man you should always be revived
[1:32:44] praise the Lord it should never be a
[1:32:47] dull moment because of what Christ has
[1:32:49] done Amen I'm not here to rebuke you
[1:32:54] anything like that but I'm speaking as a
[1:32:57] whole as we move on together are you
[1:33:02] happy we can move on together in Christ
[1:33:06] because we have a greater witness we
[1:33:10] have a greater cloud of witnesses all
[1:33:12] those Saints are waiting on us they're
[1:33:15] waiting on us because why they without
[1:33:19] us cannot be made perfect so we must
[1:33:22] come to it we shall come to it our full
[1:33:26] recognition in Christ knowing who you
[1:33:29] are nor what we have amen and see what
[1:33:34] it is that the devil don't want you to
[1:33:36] see and if you see it praise the Lord
[1:33:39] as the Bible said happy are you because
[1:33:45] we must move on what what are we saying
[1:33:48] God here by the preaching of the gospel

[1:33:57] individual
[1:33:58] he's building a powerhouse you as an
[1:34:02] individual walking the Prophet said my
[1:34:06] ministry is to build the individual so
[1:34:10] you as an individual
[1:34:12] one of you becoming a walking powerhouse

[1:34:34] one thing I do and forgetting all the
[1:34:35] negative things all the things that are

[1:35:06] glory there was at a time that then they
[1:35:09] was at a time of the Feast of
[1:35:11] Tabernacles they were worshipping under
[1:35:15] that feast they went around and told

[1:35:39] what we're doing evening we're eating
[1:35:41] the lamb the revealed word we're

[1:35:49] because we are free hallelujah are you
[1:35:53] free this morning you know I want to
[1:35:55] tell you something
[1:35:59] the devil is more afraid of you than
[1:36:03] what you realize because say he's he's
[1:36:07] afraid of that blood and that word I
[1:36:13] said that Deborah is afraid of you that
[1:36:17] word in that blood but he's he's always
[1:36:23] trying to make you
[1:36:25] be afraid but I want to tell you as
[1:36:29] often said the devil is on probation
[1:36:36] tell your neighbor I'm gonna tell you
[1:36:41] why he's limited he have power but he's
[1:36:51] limited why because he committed a crime
[1:36:58] a serious crime ittan started here
[1:37:05] he came against Michael in heaven he
[1:37:09] wanted a better Kingdom he thought he
[1:37:12] could have a better Kingdom he said I
[1:37:14] will sit in the sides of the north I
[1:37:19] will be worshipped as God it was the I
[1:37:25] will I will I will but he was brought
[1:37:29] down but Christ in the garden he said
[1:37:33] father not my will but thy will
[1:37:37] hallelujah why because he knew he
[1:37:39] possessed the kingdom of God hallelujah
[1:37:41] amen when you recognize who you are it a
[1:37:44] humble you he was humble even obedient
[1:37:48] to the death of the Cross because why he
[1:37:51] knew what power we had he could have
[1:37:53] called 12 leaders that more than trouble
[1:37:55] easily anger then changed the whole
[1:37:56] scene but he knew what he came to do o
[1:38:00] praise the Living God what do we see
[1:38:04] what do we see let's move on now here we
[1:38:09] know there are two powers to powers in
[1:38:13] the whole universe
[1:38:14] the power of God and the power of the
[1:38:20] devil they're cooked two kingdoms the
[1:38:24] power of God the kingdom of God and the
[1:38:26] kingdom of the devil and we see Lucifer
[1:38:30] was once in heaven the light bringer but
[1:38:36] he was cast at Earth
[1:38:38] so his name was changed from Lucifer to
[1:38:41] Satan you know you don't like that name
[1:38:44] cuz Satan shows his defeat it changed
[1:38:48] him from from the bringer of light unto
[1:38:51] the father of darkness
[1:38:52] oh what a mighty God we serve I'm glad
[1:38:57] to be on the winter side
[1:38:58] I'm glad to be on the water side so here
[1:39:03] Satan is limited back in the day when he
[1:39:08] committed certain crimes and we're on
[1:39:11] probation they use what they call a
[1:39:13] leavin worth as a prison ball-and-chain
[1:39:19] made of cast iron they drug it around
[1:39:23] everywhere is about 18 pounds today they
[1:39:26] have an ankle bracelet bracelet whatever
[1:39:29] it is I don't know all I know he it
[1:39:35] makes him limited he can only go certain
[1:39:38] places hello yeah and I want to tell you
[1:39:42] safety cannot do anything to you unless
[1:39:44] God allowed Satan is limited by men but

[1:40:30] Christ came to do that's why he's hid
[1:40:33] this message why one is already going on
[1:40:37] the Prophet is already raised up he was
[1:40:40] a Superman among people anyway with God
[1:40:44] gave him victory and brother Jack
[1:40:46] greater than this old Clark Kent that
[1:40:54] was just a perversion

[1:41:07] be now don't don't look down the road
[1:41:10] you know what's deceiving a lot of
[1:41:13] people they fail to call Jesus Christ on
[1:41:16] the scene right now the Lord Jesus told
[1:41:22] them he said the kingdom of God is nigh
[1:41:24] unto thee they didn't understand him so

[1:43:16] want to do this brag on him because we
[1:43:18] we are we are coming to our recognition
[1:43:22] knowing who we are you know I was
[1:43:25] reminded of uh you know you say we
[1:43:28] always have to create the right
[1:43:30] atmosphere I'm reminded of one time
[1:43:33] there was a visitor came in a service
[1:43:36] they had a foot disease for about six
[1:43:41] months
[1:43:41] radda nning of the of defeat and he came
[1:43:47] in his service center came in a service
[1:43:51] for the first time sit down
[1:43:57] that day he walked out healed
[1:44:03] the foot disease left hey man
[1:44:13] later we went over there hop home and
[1:44:15] about 25 of us and prayed and applied
[1:44:19] the blood to that home request it from
[1:44:23] his parents he was 27 we joined together
[1:44:28] we we applied the blood we read Exodus
[1:44:31] 12 and we applied the blood to that home
[1:44:37] actually this happened before he was
[1:44:39] healed and he came and testified and
[1:44:42] said he was in his room when we were
[1:44:45] praying for him he joined the circuit
[1:44:48] prayed with his parents he came and
[1:44:51] testified he said demons start leaving
[1:44:55] him as we were praying and then he he he
[1:45:02] wrote different poetry and poems poems
[1:45:05] and he denounced Islam I said what a
[1:45:09] mighty God we serve hey man they meant
[1:45:14] praise the Lord
[1:45:16] one sister came in service with a cyst
[1:45:20] on her hand not the size of a nickel you
[1:45:23] see it already do it the two darkness
[1:45:27] first one doctor in a specialist station
[1:45:29] we got to do surgery
[1:45:36] so she didn't want surgery she came to
[1:45:39] service and she said doing it medicine
[1:45:44] had a word she said she looked in her
[1:45:47] hand it was gone she said disappeared
[1:45:50] and she told her her husband a man prays
[1:45:54] alone that same sister walked in service
[1:46:00] with a cane two different times because
[1:46:04] I'd asked about that then she told me
[1:46:06] what happened with the cane way anyway a
[1:46:09] voice spoke to her and said you don't
[1:46:11] need that cane she threw the cane away
[1:46:14] praise the Lord
[1:46:15] God is able you been the kingdom of God
[1:46:19] is within you
[1:46:21] Amen I believe that you know we want it
[1:46:25] it should be where at all time so we've
[1:46:27] been living on our privilege too long if
[1:46:32] it's not for anyone else I'm may be
[1:46:34] saying it for me maybe one preach it to
[1:46:36] myself but you understand me
[1:46:39] we're talking about a bride that's
[1:46:42] moving on we're talking about claiming
[1:46:44] all of our rights you know see the enemy
[1:46:48] he he don't want you to come to your
[1:46:51] position but see we have to come to like
[1:46:54] Enoch as I've said I have an opportunity
[1:46:57] yeah but I'm pressing Enoch had a
[1:47:00] testimony the Bible said before his
[1:47:07] translation so you got to get it on this
[1:47:11] side adoption on this side now I'm not
[1:47:16] talking about the adoption of your body
[1:47:18] in in Romans 8 but we're talking talking
[1:47:22] about it seasons you been adopted it's
[1:47:25] coming to your place your position on
[1:47:27] this side you doing the greater works on
[1:47:30] this side hey man praise the Lord
[1:47:34] you coming the resting
[1:47:35] you decide recognizing your data's
[1:47:39] message recognizing who you are
[1:47:41] recognizing you kanuda greater works
[1:47:44] recognizing what silver you say rest in
[1:47:47] ours and what system is a part is
[1:47:49] impossible in the youth right is right
[1:47:53] not just with God all things are
[1:47:55] possible but God put it back on you with
[1:47:59] you nothing should be impossible
[1:48:01] that's the barbary man why because the
[1:48:04] kingdom of God is within you
[1:48:06] hold man so you don't have to be afraid
[1:48:10] take the Word of God and use it home and
[1:48:13] drive it in our heart of the enemy but
[1:48:16] this kind of faith worketh by love and
[1:48:20] this kind of faith the foundation of it
[1:48:23] is forgiveness you can't have any arms
[1:48:26] see not we're not talking about a fate
[1:48:31] see sinners have a fate they'll come in
[1:48:35] and be healed and go out and live they
[1:48:37] kind of life and never come to Christ so
[1:48:40] they have a fate but we're not talking
[1:48:43] about a faith we're talking about
[1:48:45] perfect faith what's perfect faith you
[1:48:50] think it's some for fence somewhere but
[1:48:52] perfect faith is pressing God praying
[1:48:56] and asking God to do something for you
[1:48:58] and going away but even if he's will
[1:49:03] work it out
[1:49:03] that's perfect faith you mean is that
[1:49:06] simple that's perfect faith praise the
[1:49:09] Lord
[1:49:11] amen so what do we see what do we see
[1:49:15] I want to stir up your pure Minds by
[1:49:20] where amendments you know how I have my
[1:49:25] watch here because I don't see I can't

[1:49:50] of different gadgets myself and don't
[1:49:51] know how to use him like him
[1:49:53] mine just yeah but anyway praise the
[1:49:57] Lord I said man you older than me but
[1:49:59] I'm always good you not gonna praise the
[1:50:06] Lord but you know I said here we must
[1:50:12] recognize the supernatural it's right
[1:50:16] among us we have to what are you saying
[1:50:20] taking God at His Word
[1:50:21] he said the angels of God and camp
[1:50:24] around them that fear Him what do you
[1:50:28] mean they pitch a tent they camp out
[1:50:31] where will you go angels of God camp out
[1:50:34] around you hey man my mother ought to
[1:50:39] make a lutheran child hey man
[1:50:41] my mama you have so much Authority more
[1:50:44] than the angels of God in his presence
[1:50:47] you have more authority as a sinner
[1:50:49] saved by grace you as a son and daughter
[1:50:51] of God have more authority my remember
[1:50:55] now is really the greatest mistake they
[1:50:57] made they chose law over grace God was
[1:51:01] to make them a kingdom of priests a
[1:51:02] Kingdom priests but according to
[1:51:06] revelation 1 in 6 and revelation 5 and
[1:51:09] 10 I've made you unto those unto God by
[1:51:15] the blood I've made you kings and
[1:51:17] priests that word Kings mean Kingdom
[1:51:20] priests I've made your kingdom a priest
[1:51:23] according to 1st Peter 2 and a royal
[1:51:27] priesthood a holy priesthood or all
[1:51:32] priesthood that's what God is doing why
[1:51:36] because of the shed blood of Jesus
[1:51:38] Christ because of the perfect sacrifice
[1:51:42] he made us kings and priests because of
[1:51:48] the precious shed blood of Jesus Christ
[1:51:51] now his life can come back and live in
[1:51:57] the believer
[1:51:58] why is the kingdom hallelujah h-him the
[1:52:04] kingdom crossing you hallelujah it just
[1:52:09] does something it brings a certain
[1:52:13] character and remember character is what
[1:52:17] I can't hear you
[1:52:22] it's a victory it's not a gift it's a
[1:52:26] victim and recognizing what you're
[1:52:30] possessing knowing what you're
[1:52:33] possessing and not only knowing what you
[1:52:35] possess and moving in action putting it
[1:52:39] in action it's got to be faith in action
[1:52:41] show me your works faith without your
[1:52:44] works and I will show you my faith by my
[1:52:47] works because faith without works is
[1:52:51] dead but what's its faith Express hey

[1:53:08] battle

[1:53:37] power because we need power to operate
[1:53:41] the gifts that are in us but we need
[1:53:44] faith to operate the power and we wisdom
[1:53:48] how to use this power and authority what
[1:53:53] are you saying - remember me Elijah
[1:53:54] Elijah they criticized him they called
[1:53:58] him ball head What did he say
[1:54:00] what did he do he cursed the 42 children
[1:54:03] and he calls to she-bears to go and kill
[1:54:06] them he had power he had authority but
[1:54:10] he used it wrong
[1:54:12] he used that anger when Jesus was
[1:54:15] rejected in Nazareth
[1:54:18] John and James said let us call on far
[1:54:21] from heaven like a lodging and destroy
[1:54:24] them up

[2:05:18] praise the Lord you ought to claim your
[2:05:20] rights you shouldn't be a feeble one
[2:05:22] among us I'm telling you it shouldn't be
[2:05:24] a fever one among us if God under the
[2:05:27] sacrifice of booze and goats on it alone
[2:05:29] could cause them to walk 40 years and it
[2:05:33] was not a people on among them what
[2:05:35] about now what about now even for God
[2:05:41] call one of his Saints home did she go
[2:05:46] home healed you understand me
[2:05:49] that's how it should be you believe that
[2:05:53] that's how it should be now praise the
[2:05:58] Lord
[2:05:58] because because we're talking about an
[2:06:00] atmosphere that God want us to create
[2:06:05] and to live in you know you know that's
[2:06:08] why the scripture said make a joyful
[2:06:10] noise unto the Lord all you lands serve
[2:06:17] the Lord with gladness
[2:06:18] don't don't don't let the pastor after
[2:06:21] plead with you to come to church we not
[2:06:25] getting mentioned prayer service that's
[2:06:29] a that's an unpopular service sometimes
[2:06:33] a Cray only my wife and I be there
[2:06:43] brother Charles Anderson he's a former
[2:06:46] pastor but we will have prayer one time
[2:06:49] I think they had about 20 people there
[2:06:51] but most the time we had about 10 of us
[2:06:55] so it's unpoppable
[2:06:58] something we needed more and more
[2:07:00] together together together even a more
[2:07:03] as we see the Day approaching you
[2:07:07] talking about a powerhouse a church
[2:07:10] coming together in prayer look what
[2:07:11] happened in the book of Acts we said
[2:07:14] where the book of Acts now it features
[2:07:15] first of all now this message is
[2:07:17] producing another Ephesians right if
[2:07:19] heathens had church for two days solid
[2:07:22] everyday search the Scriptures for two

[2:10:04] bringing pleasure
[2:10:05] it means enjoying happiness are you
[2:10:08] enjoying happiness you notice how to put
[2:10:11] on
[2:10:14] you happy yes you know I'm not trying to
[2:10:22] clown but you know what I'm saying
[2:10:24] people say they're happy and they're not
[2:10:26] happy but this is real God wants you to
[2:10:30] be happy he want to see about you come
[2:10:34] now let us reason together let's let us
[2:10:36] talk things over whatever it is if if
[2:10:38] there's unconfessed sins or whatever it
[2:10:40] is
[2:10:40] let's talk things over cuz I want you to
[2:10:42] have this that's what he that's what he
[2:10:45] tell us though your sins be as scarlet
[2:10:48] I'll make them white as snow though they
[2:10:50] be red like crimson I'll make them white
[2:10:53] like war that's the Word of God it's all
[2:10:56] you have to do come let's talk about it
[2:10:58] let's talk things over God understands
[2:11:07] God wants you to enjoy life even though
[2:11:12] his loving-kindness is better than this
[2:11:15] life but God wants you to enjoy this
[2:11:17] life
[2:11:25] praise the Lord it's so much that God is
[2:11:31] having store for us and want us to have
[2:11:34] and you know some have power you know in
[2:11:38] Luke 22:24
[2:11:41] he gave them power to cast out unclean
[2:11:45] spirits and that word powers exuse you
[2:11:51] which means authority got some scholars
[2:11:56] in here got some students that a word
[2:12:03] but it didn't stop there because some
[2:12:06] were casting out Devils didn't even
[2:12:08] follow him they didn't mean they
[2:12:11] possessed the kingdom of God now Luke
[2:12:23] 24:00 Luke 10 was the power he gave them
[2:12:26] there but Luke 24 after the Holy Ghost
[2:12:29] is come upon you
[2:12:30] you see receive the promise of my father
[2:12:33] from on high and x1 and eight
[2:12:37] that power is Dunamis that's the Holy
[2:12:42] Ghost that's different in Luke 10 so
[2:12:48] many have politic s that unclean spirits
[2:12:51] exuse you but they don't have Dunamis
[2:12:55] that's the power within you see the
[2:13:00] kingdom of God is within you
[2:13:02] once there's a healing of the soul you
[2:13:04] could not be lost no more than God
[2:13:07] Himself could be lost because keep in
[2:13:09] mind it's like potentially once the
[2:13:17] German the egg meets in the fellow below
[2:13:20] fallopian tube the pregnant takes place
[2:13:26] potentially potentially the baby is
[2:13:29] present here but not born
[2:13:38] and by the holy ghost we are pregnant by
[2:13:44] God's Spirit but we must grow thereby
[2:13:55] didn't you have this power a coordinator
[2:13:58] fees is 121 which means which the Greek
[2:14:02] word on that is Kratos which means
[2:14:07] Dominion a king hath dominion Dominion
[2:14:15] is what a kingdom so God want us to have
[2:14:19] all three of those powers power and
[2:14:23] authority the Holy Ghost virtue power
[2:14:26] for service and power Dominion we're
[2:14:34] talking about you knowing knowing what
[2:14:37] you really have knowing that their
[2:14:40] leaders are angels to protect you
[2:14:44] minutes and spirits sent forth to assist
[2:14:48] you to deliver you God have angels
[2:14:55] haters angels of deliverance angels of
[2:14:58] healing different ages we look at angels
[2:15:02] s Michael the Archangel and Gabriel and
[2:15:05] wormwood who Gaber who God used for
[2:15:08] Israel wormwood who who was their new
[2:15:11] and eluvian agent controlled the waters
[2:15:15] but then what about and then Michael is
[2:15:18] Christ in angelic realm you notice that
[2:15:23] because you know Satan he didn't go the
[2:15:25] Gaber
[2:15:26] he didn't go to wormwood he went to
[2:15:30] Moses disputing Michael disputing of
[2:15:37] Moses body thank you the Archangel but
[2:15:44] God help different angels so what are
[2:15:48] you saying you got to look into the
[2:15:50] unseen around we know there's a heavenly
[2:15:55] kingdom there's coming on out of heaven
[2:15:59] the New Jerusalem
[2:16:03] but what we're sharing is for you to see
[2:16:05] this other Kingdom because their meat
[2:16:14] we receive a kingdom an eternal king who
[2:16:18] is the eternal word who has eternal life
[2:16:21] by his eternal word to his eternal
[2:16:24] people who has eternal life and
[2:16:27] partakers of this the Bible said in in
[2:16:33] first Timothy 1:17 the king eternal he's
[2:16:39] the king eternal jesus said my kingdom
[2:16:43] is not from here if this was my kingdom
[2:16:46] I will allow my service to fight and I
[2:16:49] will fight but my kingdom is not from
[2:16:52] here we have a kingdom that cannot be
[2:16:57] removed amen that's why he started in
[2:17:01] you Christ in you the hope of glory
[2:17:05] that's the kingdom that'll never be
[2:17:07] moved I'm so glad to be a part of that
[2:17:12] Kingdom
[2:17:13] aren't you praise the Lord Amen I'm
[2:17:17] coming down to the end here coming down
[2:17:22] to the end amen I have I have some few
[2:17:28] things here
[2:17:33] you know one thing about the Lord he
[2:17:36] don't change he never changes did you
[2:17:43] know this civilization changes they went
[2:17:48] from walking the horse and buggy to
[2:17:54] automobile to airplane now they have
[2:17:59] gems but it's only a type of what's in
[2:18:04] the spirit and and I was thinking I said
[2:18:07] you notice they may whom and already
[2:18:12] prophesy of the car amen
[2:18:16] and one of the prophets prophesy of the
[2:18:19] airplane I said they have mechanical
[2:18:22] chariots and horses the autumn will be
[2:18:27] an airplane mechanical but God had
[2:18:29] already designed the bird they just they
[2:18:32] just copied everything and made it
[2:18:35] mechanical and then they got in
[2:18:37] electronics and they begin to not we got
[2:18:42] what we call wireless but we can't live
[2:18:47] in all of that we have to look to the
[2:18:49] invisible God because that while it's
[2:18:52] gonna fail when that wild as you can go
[2:18:54] on area and have no connection right but
[2:18:58] with God you can always have a
[2:19:00] connection a man here never faded some
[2:19:06] people switched from Horizon to AT&T
[2:19:10] Straight Talk and all these others back
[2:19:12] and forward and they still missing calls
[2:19:16] and missing sickness and missing
[2:19:20] connections but once you connect it with
[2:19:23] him hey man
[2:19:26] only sinking separate you but he wants
[2:19:31] you to stay connected and once you're
[2:19:33] connected with him you become a Superman
[2:19:36] or superwoman a super child why because
[2:19:41] in you dressed the powers of heaven and
[2:19:46] earth
[2:19:46] in other words heaven and earth is
[2:19:48] backing you up mine I tell you what it
[2:19:53] is a joy being a Christian God has sent
[2:19:57] so much word in the US revealed by
[2:19:59] prophet to show us who we are and you
[2:20:03] know they have television or television
[2:20:05] now now television it is it's what the
[2:20:10] devil has has put on it it could have
[2:20:12] been used for a great purpose of God so
[2:20:16] not against television but it's what
[2:20:19] they got on it all the field is so much
[2:20:24] field but I'm glad for that other vision
[2:20:30] God told Moses visions he told Paul
[2:20:34] visions he told all his prophet visions
[2:20:37] and all this is written by vision amen
[2:20:41] the full Word of God
[2:20:48] you have all these things I could go on
[2:20:53] and on and on live let me just a narrow
[2:20:56] down I thought about today even the
[2:20:59] robots I went in Sam's Club a few weeks
[2:21:03] ago I don't like well my I apologize but
[2:21:08] I don't the customer service is poor
[2:21:14] very poor man he found a copy Costco but
[2:21:21] it's very poor but I went in there and I

[2:21:30] were self checkout and only two people
[2:21:36] with there with about 20 customers
[2:21:40] that's terrible
[2:21:47] I apologize
[2:21:55] they replace in humans and robots and
[2:21:58] then now they're doing you know they did
[2:22:00] darling you remember dolly they won't
[2:22:03] they want to try to bypass god they're
[2:22:07] trying to bring these animals that can
[2:22:12] avoid death can't avoid death that way
[2:22:16] is only one way to heart death hey man
[2:22:19] he that believeth in me though he were
[2:22:23] dead yet shall he live because he that
[2:22:26] believeth liveth and believeth in me
[2:22:27] shall never die
[2:22:28] that's the only way to avoid death amen
[2:22:31] Christian's don't die they go to sleep
[2:22:34] amen the Lord Himself said is sin from
[2:22:38] heaven with a shout a message amen
[2:22:41] and the voice of an archangel the dead
[2:22:46] in Christ shall rise first
[2:22:47] and we were to live and remain to be
[2:22:51] caught up to meet him in here the Bible
[2:22:55] said they which are sleep will God bring
[2:22:57] with him
[2:22:58] Amen O Lord Oh y'all trouble not the
[2:23:03] master she's dead
[2:23:07] trouble not the master jesus said let's
[2:23:12] go wake her well Lord if she if she
[2:23:15] sleeping she do it well then he had to
[2:23:18] speak their language she's dead but
[2:23:21] let's go wake her so he that liveth him
[2:23:25] and leave her than me shall never die
[2:23:27] though he were dead yet shall he live
[2:23:31] you know we're looking you know you go
[2:23:33] back thirty years you know just about
[2:23:37] everybody was around you go back twenty
[2:23:40] years some of our loved ones is going on
[2:23:43] you go back ten years we begin to miss a
[2:23:47] lot of our loved ones who has set an
[2:23:50] example and as going on but you know
[2:23:53] what we'll see them again we will see
[2:23:57] them again why because they were part of
[2:24:00] their they are a part of this kingdom
[2:24:03] and I'm glad to be a part of this
[2:24:06] kingdom
[2:24:07] a man I'm so glad so glad I'm yours
[2:24:12] alone so glad your mercy has found me so
[2:24:16] the POW was here is all in Christ is all
[2:24:20] in Christ as much as your faith will be
[2:24:30] released that's how much power you can
[2:24:35] have what are you saying I'm really
[2:24:38] narrowing down give me about ten minutes
[2:24:41] as much as your faith will be released
[2:24:47] that's how much power you can have
[2:24:50] because in you dwells the power to make
[2:24:55] heaven and earth God within you and your
[2:24:59] sons and daughters of God do you believe
[2:25:02] that according to your faith be it unto
[2:25:05] you
[2:25:05] if thou canst believe all things are
[2:25:09] possible that's what he wants you to
[2:25:12] live in that omnipotence power
[2:25:22] that's exactly what he want you to live
[2:25:24] in and you can't there's no way to be a
[2:25:27] person said I've talked to a minister 30
[2:25:31] years among the message he see never had
[2:25:35] a supernatural experience with God now
[2:25:40] there's no way you can be in contact
[2:25:42] with God and not have a supernatural
[2:25:46] experience there's something wrong
[2:25:51] there's something wrong because it does
[2:25:56] something to you it changes you
[2:25:59] from the inside out hey man Jeremiah
[2:26:02] said is like fire shut up in my bones I
[2:26:04] cannot hold my peace you recognize who
[2:26:07] you are amen you glad he called you the
[2:26:12] bombers you blessed because he called
[2:26:15] you that he chosen you so those who he
[2:26:21] called his justified he calls you before
[2:26:24] the foundation the war those who he
[2:26:27] called he justified those he justified
[2:26:29] he had already glorified you believe
[2:26:33] that the same God before the foundation
[2:26:36] of the world calls your name wrote it in
[2:26:40] the Lamb's Book alive from the
[2:26:42] foundation of the world he has already
[2:26:44] made a place in glory for you it was
[2:26:48] this earth a new Tabernacle be dissolved
[2:26:50] this earthly house see the tabernacle of
[2:26:53] God is with men the kingdom of God is
[2:26:57] within you
[2:26:58] that's what the Lord Jesus was saying he
[2:27:01] could have he could have say that the
[2:27:03] tabernacle of God is with you because
[2:27:06] why your body is a temple of the Holy
[2:27:09] Ghost
[2:27:15] so while you're worried about what are
[2:27:18] you going along looking sad for lift up
[2:27:22] your heads
[2:27:24] the fever need let the hands raise up
[2:27:26] that once hung down let it let them this
[2:27:29] week say I'm strong that means let the
[2:27:32] weak say I'm a warrior not only Christ
[2:27:39] was slain to take away sin but your name
[2:27:42] was written in the Lamb's of the life
[2:27:44] before the foundation a Torah God wrote
[2:27:47] your name associated with his before the
[2:27:53] foundation of the world now Satan make
[2:27:57] you get scared or try to get you to
[2:28:00] doubt but before the war ever begun God
[2:28:04] called your name you Christians are you
[2:28:10] glad to be one of them I'm glad to be
[2:28:13] one of them and we are enjoying the
[2:28:16] blessings and resting and waiting upon
[2:28:18] the coming of the Lord waiting for it
[2:28:21] I'm waiting I'm looking I'm trusting
[2:28:25] because why I know that it won't be long
[2:28:29] so you as an individual is not what you
[2:28:34] had done 10 years ago or an experience
[2:28:39] back there but God want you to see him
[2:28:43] ever liveth as far as a ever-present
[2:28:47] the same today you're right now God
[2:28:52] that's what he was trying to tell them
[2:28:54] the kingdom of God is is among you right
[2:28:58] now
[2:29:00] well lord the kingdom this in the
[2:29:02] kingdom that the kingdom of God is right
[2:29:04] now among you he told him is nigh and I
[2:29:10] believe that he was telling them that
[2:29:14] what he was possessing when a person
[2:29:18] receive the Holy Ghost it's like a
[2:29:20] little white button like a light
[2:29:23] in us in that person do you know that
[2:29:28] even scientists proven when someone pray
[2:29:32] for the sick and evangelist that's
[2:29:35] anointed they're sincere when he pray
[2:29:38] for an individual with a sickness they
[2:29:41] actually trapped light and so like
[2:29:43] leaving that evangelist body Internet of
[2:29:47] that person what is it God wants you to
[2:29:51] look into the unseen I'm closing my
[2:29:54] Bible say God wants you to look into the
[2:29:57] unseen because that's how to devil Roth
[2:30:02] you when you don't look into the unseen
[2:30:06] he Rob's you see and many never go on to
[2:30:12] get Christ they never go on to get the
[2:30:16] Holy Ghost
[2:30:17] that's how keeping power if the Holy
[2:30:20] Ghost will leave us we all fail so I
[2:30:26] thank God for the Holy Ghost he's not
[2:30:29] keeping power that's why that's why we
[2:30:31] must have it it's the only way he'll
[2:30:35] keep us we pray Lord that kingdom come
[2:30:41] thy will be done in earth not deserve
[2:30:49] here but in earth there will be done in
[2:30:54] earth as it is in heaven
[2:30:57] see the pattern must be according to
[2:31:00] heaven
[2:31:01] Moses build the tabernacle
[2:31:06] according to the pattern we are
[2:31:09] Tabernacles
[2:31:13] pray to the God within you
[2:31:22] you know what happened
[2:31:26] during the time in the old testament you
[2:31:31] had singers they were commanded to sing
[2:31:41] in the tabernacle continually several
[2:31:49] were pointed and all they did was some
[2:31:53] several pointed that was their job they
[2:31:57] played music some were appointed to
[2:31:59] stand at the door
[2:32:01] some were appointed to burn incense but
[2:32:05] it was continual worship all the time
[2:32:13] that was their occupation
[2:32:19] but Paul came over and said rejoice
[2:32:23] always making melody in our hearts
[2:32:31] always I'll continue worship that's
[2:32:37] where Paul and Silas they were in jail
[2:32:39] they worshiped they sung they praise God
[2:32:46] it creates a certain atmosphere instead
[2:32:51] of complaining sometime sing a song
[2:32:56] call back our song love remembers maybe
[2:32:59] when you first got saved
[2:33:01] if the enemy try to bring discouragement
[2:33:04] I try to get you to doubt or try to go
[2:33:07] down memory lane you know you take
[2:33:09] memory and make you sad if you lean too
[2:33:12] much you get sad you have to say wait a
[2:33:15] minute I don't need to be sad he does
[2:33:18] that some music you hear at times it
[2:33:20] makes you say you got to get away from
[2:33:23] it it's the truth you know but
[2:33:29] atmosphere is what makes the difference
[2:33:32] don't forget that's why often times the
[2:33:35] Lord kept reminding them I want to
[2:33:37] remind you who you are
[2:33:39] remind you that I'm with you remind you
[2:33:42] that I'll never leave you nor forsake
[2:33:43] you you want to remind you at all times
[2:33:48] that's how we walk in victory never
[2:33:52] defeated never lose ibadah
[2:33:55] walking on obedience that was the
[2:33:58] difference he Saul got in with
[2:34:01] disobedience and the kingdom was rented
[2:34:07] from him and he began to worship a winch
[2:34:16] but David as he walked in obedience God
[2:34:19] gave him victory before he went and

[2:45:48] kingdom of God is within us oftentimes
[2:45:52] we're so busy looking at so many other
[2:45:56] things but we fail to see what is
[2:45:58] dwelling on the inside of us how many
[2:46:00] people went to church today and God just
[2:46:02] got a good feel good sermon but God
[2:46:05] you're trying to bring your bride to a
[2:46:07] place where they recognized who they are

[2:46:12] wants to bribe but recognizes who she is
[2:46:14] then the rapture widow so is this
[2:46:17] evident that we have not come to the
[2:46:19] place that you want us to be so help us

[2:46:40] change so if that same God dwells on the
[2:46:42] inside of us we should be crying either
[2:46:44] we should speak and see things change so

[2:46:50] be
