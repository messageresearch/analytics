precious pastor brother jack father as his ministering father back in okeechobee brother smiley's church anointed them lord father use him to bless the body of christ lord bless him lord father and bring him back safely to be with us lord we thank you we bless you in jesus christ and we pray amen glory be to the lord amen shall we be seated to our amen thank you thank you my pleasure sisters for what you do for us amen that is the ministry of angelic i think we've got three basic types of angels we've got the archangels who are the warriors who fight our battles for us we've got the seraphims who bring their presence of the lord their sweetness and their son's inspiration and we've got their caribbeans who bring their word onto us so the lord we thank the lord for anointing our sisters and our brothers who can play instrument strung the guitar play all distance you know and create the atmosphere and in the heal in even the songs there's healing amen and we know in the time of david and saul when saul was afflicted with demons david would go and strong and i mean play the guitar whatever and then the holy ghost through the anointing of the songs will go into the body of a soul and hit his sickness and ailment so the lord used the ministry they are part of the ministry and we than the lord for our brothers and sisters who have sacrificed themselves and the talent for the glory of god god bless you for the songs because i cannot do this i don't have a clue how to do this it's not my calling so the lord the body of christ is mainly one body but many members you know to fulfill every need in the body of christ and the lord bless our brothers and sisters those who sing those who play guitar those who list songs and everything that they do their lord bless them the lord bless our brothers and sisters on the internet world the lord be with them and the lord give you your portion as we minister the word of the lord amen amen glory be to the lord we want to continue uh further on what we preached last week since some of us were not here present we know because of covet our services are divided into two morning and afternoon right but the lord is good sometimes he makes a way for us to we thank the lord for the internet we get everything but sometimes it's not like being here in in in distance so we want to just caption that today's title is going to be uh the eterna you are the attribute of elohim express or you are the expression of elohim's eternal attribute amen we want to lift god from history to the present tense we can talk about what the lord did for abraham all day long but then if the lord is not doing what i need for me then it's just a history we can talk about what the lord did for hannah some four thousand five thousand whatever years ago but then if you come to that need and the lord doesn't do the same for you then it's god yesterday it's not god of today we can talk about what the lord is going to do in the future their glory is going to open in the on earth and in the sixth dimension but if the lord doesn't do what we need today it doesn't give the food that we need today the healing that we need today deliverance of our loved ones if we cannot he'll covet 19 if we cannot take away cancers and tumors if he cannot do all this as far as then he's just a god of history and maybe he's going to be some god in in the future but it's not a present tense god but no that's not what our lord is amen he's the same hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today and tomorrow and forevermore amen his power doesn't diminish he doesn't run out of power out of healing virtues and our virtues they are in you and i to express them amen glory hallelujah last week we talked about we ministered on as you said the attributes seven attributes of jehovah but then we put it as elohim eternal attributes we talk about geovajira he being the the the provider he provide for every situation doesn't matter how needy and how big the problems are sometimes we made the problems like mountains and like the sky when we let the human mind detect to what you see the human mind can magnify your problems so wide it will rain from here both hills mountains and go way into the sky so you are just a teeny ant behind the problem there's nothing that you can do amen if you do that we're going to be like the 10 spice that's what they did they look at all mine we went to them to the place yes the land was flown without kenani but we were just like grasshoppers before the giants and so they became magnified the problem and that's what the devil don't look at the devil as somebody far away from you the devil will preach on your mind he even operated on the man of jesus christ when he was here in flesh the bible said that satan came to him right do you think he came with some monkey like a tail and came to waxy steel and said hey jesus tried to turn turn the stone into bread no he was working on his mind he was working on his human spirit that you have got the power you fasted 40 days and 49. and look at the way you are walking so about to fall down why don't you turn this stone into bread and that wasn't what it was meant for that wasn't the word for the day yes you had the power but the power is governed by the world so jesus didn't do it amen then he went back it didn't mean he went back he just began to express back again that he you've got all the power in the universe why don't you throw yourself on the ground and the angels will carry you up yeah he didn't oblige to that and he began to tempt him he was working on his mind so sometimes the devil will not use somebody to tempt you but your own mind that your problem is so way big is beyond you is beyond the universe there's nothing that anybody can do for you and you are just a little tiny insect behind a problem and you lose soup and you begin to go down and under and under but then when you begin to see yourself that is not your might it's not your human mind it's not your power it's not your resources it's not your healing virtues but it's jesus christ in you amen it's jesus christ in you manifesting those virtues then you just say hey i'm a human being i'm only five foot eight five foot eleven i'm only four foot six foot i can't be any longer than that but there's somebody who can be longer than that who can be taller than that he's jesus christ let's transfer the battle to that person and the lord jesus christ in your heart in my brother's side in your sister's heart take up the situation and diminish the situation amen let's look at david david was a just a little skinny little boy and he said he was going to fight goliath why do you even think about that david is a hallucination what is wrong with you yeah even saul who is the tallest of other people in israel he couldn't even go before goliath and you a little tiny little skinny boy you want to go and fight goliath yeah but david was looking beyond himself he was looking to the lord of hosts yahweh jehovah so when the battle became the battle they all gave their ways i'm going to do this to you goliath was kissing david in the name of his idols and david also kissed him in the name of his god and so when the battle was set i mean a peace became a real battle david just put himself out of the way and he let the lord take place he transferred he's learned how to transfer the battle to the lord on the desert on his knees in prayer when he saw the bear he didn't kill the bear with his strength but he let jeopard come into the situation that nothing can take my life nothing can take my sheep from from my hands my daddy gave me 100 sheep to take them to the field yeah and my daddy's expressed expectant henry shibako he's not a person 99 so you this bird you are not going to take this from me in the name of the lord jesus christ i take a hold of you rape his mind with the strength of the almighty and brought it as a trophy to his father that i killed this bear another time a lion appeared out of the blue and looked looking around and then he said look this doesn't scare me right i've seen this before i've seen a bear you lying is going to be the same thing it's not my strength the lord of hosts the jova jarrah anointed him giovanni the protector anointed man you took the lion and ripped the lion apart the same lord is here and all we need to do is to transfer the battle onto the lord because the battle is not your battle the covet battle is not my battle but the battle is unto the lord amen and when we learn to transfer to that hey the lord has given us sheep the sheep could be our loved ones that's right we you are the one who is covering them with your talking amen we are covering our loved ones who haven't come to maturity spiritually with your token because the lord has anointed you for that ministry that's right and so you take yourself out of the way and say lord even my loved one hasn't been seen the lord yet and it's not the time for him to be taken out of this world i put my token upon him i put my holy ghost upon him holy ghost to me go to go to work take care of my loved ones and you just commit and believe the lord and you see the lord doing the work that you're supposed to do amen glory be to the lord amen the lord is good amen so those attributes we put java jarrah as a provider which is gold we gave a scripture genesis 22 14. now this is an attribute that we're going to dwell upon jova rapha the healer amen if there's a time we need healing of our people of our land the whole planet it is today and that is red because what we are seeing now people dying life being lost the red blood of jesus christ has already taken care of that amen if the people of the world can if the politicians can come together and just humble themselves that we are not here by our own political powers right even those politicians the lord put them in power for a purpose and if they can ascribe to the lord that lord take care of our nations our scientists cannot help anymore our medicines are not helping we don't have a vaccine lord give us ever sin the lord will give it to them amen i will come back today to the rapha there's a lot of scriptures we use exodus 15 26 psalm 147 3 he said he he let the broken in heart and bind up their wounds amen if there's anyone whose heart is broken the lord heals you and binds up your wound that is red brown the lord doesn't need to save the skies the lord doesn't need to save the angels he doesn't need to save theophanies the lord needs to save the earth which you and i are part of amen the red is a human being we've got red blood in us the crimson blood that the lord need to save us from the old breath and transition us to the new breath to be whiter than the snow the brown is the earth because this earth is what we are going to dwell upon we are not going nowhere the prophet said that when you go to heaven you're not going to fly away to another planet you're just going to be right here in another dimension faster than that when you leave this blood behind blood system that flesh behind there's another being in you by the holy ghost by the uh decree of the lord by christ the theophany the celestial body that doesn't it's not limited to this war i cannot go beyond this wall but there's another person who can go beyond this wall and see outside what is going outside he's the celestial body amen and when we drop this flesh we still gonna be right here on earth not in this flesh that can be broken down by the true flesh the bones and the flesh that is the few funny body that you wear before the foundation of the world you're going to transfer your experience that you gathered here into that theophany and keep expressing christ all throughout eternity which is beyond there's nothing like ending to eternity amen eternity means a tenor and the prophet used a circle right to describe it you just keep going and going and manifesting when you finish this circle you break into another circle as we are seen on earth the lord is moving in in circles and in cycles now one cycle manifests on earth then he breaks another circle was it last year a couple years ago we had hurricanes all over the place there's this hurricane maria hurricane this hurricane that hurricane that there was a time you see earthquakes on the earth there's this earthquake moving here in africa in asia in europe in north america in south america now it's a universal disease called coronavirus the crowning crowning of satan's ministry and as the disease is crowning isaiah chapter 16 verse 1 teaches us maybe let's read it amen i haven't read scriptures but you are the scripture expressed let's read that scripture that's not my scripture but i felt like to read it praise be to god isaiah 60 verse 1 our lord is good okay isaac is still running he said 16 isaiah chapter 6 verse 1 arise shine for thy light is come and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the lord shall arise upon you upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee amen darkness is covering the earth as we see this chronovirus all over the earth but at the same time not after not before but at the same time the glory of the lord is arising or is it raising you to shine where you are amen so the power of god is in you not that in the future in eternity when you drop this flesh you don't need healing healing is beyond you that's right it's just like god taking you from the ocean and then you want to go and eat seaweed you've gone beyond seaweed when you're in the ocean that's the other food you can afford the fish they can afford the sharks they can go to grocery and buy uh things that will be processed in the grocery right they can't get those fries so when you're on the ocean you make use of what is in the ocean when you're on earth we make use of what you have on earth on the other side you go way beyond healing the body doesn't get sick you cannot even cry so what are you going to need healing for right you cannot die none of your loved ones can die so you don't need healing on the other side of eternity but on this side of eternity that is when you need healing that's why the lord has put those attributes in you and i to manifest the healing when you fall sick or when our loved ones for sick or when the world forsake amen so the same time that coronavirus is going on let's not make it overwhelming that god we don't have a christ in us to solve the problem amen we're going to find out that is not we are not the first person to encounter pandemic and this or the prophet there was pandemic and even the prophet he prayed for a vasin because he knows that not everybody can receive divine healing you can receive divine healing but some people and that god put us under different measures some people they are level that is no they can't receive it they are not built for that but the sovereign lord being so kind and loving he made a way for scientists he broke his laboratory for them to break through the lab and then find inventions and discoveries and find okay this when the addison this these molecules can destroy gems it can kill this virus it can cure cancer it can do this it can do this it's the lord who does all the healing he's not a scientist amen one member in the room we're discussing this and he was already in my ceremony already that's right true you really my someone you must be a prophet you saw what i was going to minister how the prophet even prayed in this time i think in 1960 there was not treatment for cancer so one is that we stand a lot for sex vaccine and all these vaccines and inoculation and we pray that the lord will give us a remedy for cancer as well now we've got a lot of remedies for cancer chemotherapy radiation and what have you so that you take off everybody because the lord doesn't leave anybody out even those who don't recognize him and they don't love him they hate him he still feed them he clothes them he gives them air he put blood in them he takes care of them even those who reject him outright those who don't want to receive his word his love is so overwhelming amen is so uh infinite yes it doesn't it's it's it's not limited it's not limited to those who love him alone it's beyond it's divine love it's unlimited love those who curse him those who crucify him he forgives them and still love them amen and that attribute is you and i so the lord sometimes allows situation that people that are dear to you they will curse you they will sass you they'll reject you they'll persecute you they'll hit you they'll throw i mean put you down they'll do whatever they will do but you can come out of it your heart and pray for them and love them because you are a daughter of elohim you are expression of the attribute of elohim you are elohim manifested on earth amen if people will see elohim they have to see it in you because they don't see it in you people think there's no god why if there's god why are people suffering why there's no corona why are they scrooner virus because they are using their intellect but if they can listen to their hearts who manufacture this heart i've never seen my heart before right you've never seen your heart before but you can feel this heart that is pumping and i mean circulating blood in your body you might not see god physically with your eyes but if you can look down you can hear his voice everywhere you can see him in creation you don't even need to read the bible to see the lord you see him all around you you see him in his people amen the lord he is good that is jehovah and nisi we can go to isaiah 17 15 isaiah 4 5 luke 8 50. and jehovah's shalom the next is jova shalom the lord our peace here comes the troubled waters and the color here is blue the blue waters and the blue sky oh we've got a blue microphone please go hallelujah and the lord is awesome there's no coincidence with god amen so the lord comes no matter what the trouble in your family in your life in your city in your country in the world there's the living christ in you who can calm you down if you can listen to your heart and pray we're going to find out that we have got a responsibility to pray not only for ourselves but to pray for the world amen could jesus pray for the world amen so we can look at scriptures like judges 6 24 john 14 27. we can now come to the fifth attribute jova rohi or jova ra that is a pastor the lord is is the the pastor he's a shepherd and the color is green we had last week when we preached we had a green microphone and but i saw was telling me to break cook i was looking like green microphone yeah i said exactly the pasta always bring fresh food fresh manna from above amen there's no way that one day the person comes i don't have nothing to preach so congregation go your way no no no no it's not it's not going to happen because the word the eternity doesn't doesn't i mean exhaust you can't exhaust it amen you can preach all the bible there's more to preach you can take one scripture the lord will bring something for you on the scripture tomorrow you break something you've never seen in that scripture meanwhile you've read it you read it like thousand times because god is an unending food supply around preacher sermon spiritual food in due season when is the season the lord will give you the dew the food in that season amen so jehovah rohi

need amen me and brother were discussing about ministry that brought trodu sometimes get your ceremony don't even know the titles you're gonna use there are times that you've got the lord has given you the same one but you don't know the titles right and you keep praying and waiting and sometimes he told me sometimes you get a title right here right and sometimes you're preaching that's where the title breaks out sometimes just before you leave the office that's when the title comes so by the very time he will give it to you he said behold i'll be with you even in you on to the end of the world so he doesn't leave you behind he's always going to be with you if tomorrow maybe you need something for tomorrow you might not get the answer today when tomorrow comes he just put it there for

enough to pay this you might balance everything right it doesn't balance you might try to solicit all the help you need the banks cannot help you your neighbors cannot help you but when the time comes right on time someone you don't even think that channel you don't even think yeah the avenue you don't even you didn't envisage the lord just provide writing for this your money this your healing this your deliverance this your prayer request this what you've been designed for this is for you amen because it's a very present help in a time of need he's present amen he's not a god of future but he's god of presence amen glory hallelujah to the lord praise be to his name that is the fiery we use the color amber and yellow yellow is the color of death before you can get the new things the odd has to die amen you can't keep the old world and get a new world at the same time you have to let the old die in you you'll have to let yourself die out from the situation and the lord take care and bring the amber the glowing the beauty of christ as long as you are trying to do it right you're gonna fail you're gonna have sorrows you're gonna have i mean everything's going to run into shambles but when you let go and let god when you let go and let christ the lord will come it doesn't matter how when what he doesn't care about that but when the situation arises when there's the need for it he shows up in the situation amen he's been there all the time amen there's a song we've seen said he was there all the time he was there all the time he was there all the time he's there but sometimes you might not see him he's just wanting you to have faith in him glory hallelujah to the lord and we want to go into the bible reading the scriptures we want to read for today let's go into genesis 15 and read from verse 6 going and see how the lord manifests those attributes in our father abraham and you put yourself in situation in abraham's situation genesis chapter 15. maybe we start from verse one and read get in town with praise if you want to be on our feet if we can let's be on our feet and uh go into our same one expression of eternal attribute of elohim genesis 15 verse one downwards after these things the word of the lord came on to abraham in a vision and i want you to note his name abraham not abraham yet right abraham right saying fear not abraham i am thy shield and i exceeding great reward shield is what nissi i am thy giovanni yes i am your protector and your reward as well and the desires that you have i'm protecting you and i'm giving you rewards of you believe in me amen and verse 2 and the lord said unto abraham what will thou give oh sorry and abraham said and abram said lord god what will thou give me sin i go childless and the steward of my house is this elisa of damascus and abram said behold to me thou has given me no seed and lo one born in my house is mine mine air four and behold the word of the lord came unto uh came unto him saying this shall not be thine air but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be that thine air five and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven and tell the stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall i see be so now the lord brought abraham from his situation abraham was in his room morning my seventh is going to be my air i don't have a child i'll go childless me and my wife has married since maybe 18 18 and 16 when we're in our countries worshipping idols the lord who called us and give all our life to you and the lord we saw around 90 and 80 or 100 and this and we saw you so childless lord what is this are you making a mockery of me i mean abraham was a human being he was 100 percent prophet of god but he had his flesh and blood going through so the flesh was speaking to his mind so the holy ghost in him begin to voice out abraham come out let me show you something remember the stars i said lord i cannot remember it he said your cease will be like the stars of heaven let's keep going praise be to god and he built them see and he brought him fought abroad and said look now toward heaven and tell the stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall i see it be six and he believed in the lord so what the lord told him he swallowed it that's and he counted it to him for righteousness and he said unto him i am the lord that brought thee out of heir of the childish to give thee this land to inherit it and he said lord god where whereby shall i know that asha heritage night and he said unto him take me an effort of three years old and i want you to know the number three and she got of three years old three again and a ram of three years old three and tattled off and a young pigeon and he took and he took unto him all this and he divided them in the midst and laid each piece one against another but the burst divided he not and when the fowls came down upon the carcasses abram drove them away and when the sun was gone was going down a deep sleep fell upon abram and lo a horror of great darkness fell upon him and he said unto abraham no of surety that thy seed shall be stranger in a land that is not theirs and shall save them and they shall afflict them for 400 years and also that nation whom the whom they shall save will i judge and after afterward shall they come up with great substance amen and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace thou shalt be buried in a good old age amen shall we take our seed glory hallelujah to the lord that is abraham now abraham was called abram before then he inherited a promise called abraham abraham means father of nations amen god has added attribute manifest those attributes in the life of abraham and i want us to look at the word like i said today we're going to go a little further beyond the seven attributes and look at the word in hebrew that we use all the time the word a-m-e-n what is it amen right the root hebrew word is a man a-m-a-n a man and we want us to see certain meanings of amen glory hallelujah to you to the name of the lord the word amen has got three if you break it down it's got three parts it comes from a-m-a-m-a-n which is hebrew word for amen a man and that word means surely sure truly so be it as we know in english truthful that is a man then the the other word is e-m-u-n-a-h the faithful god emunah is the faithful god and when you break it down in the hebrew word sorry the next one yeah the emunah is faithful god if you break it down it means firmness security fidelity establish trustworthiness amen you are leaning on a gospel you are believing the gospel that gospel is for sure it's stable is the word of the lord is ye and amen it is stable it is it's fiddle it's not something that is infidel it's not something that is not truth it is worth worthy of believing it it's established it's something that is already established in the heaven forever o lord thy where they settle in heaven forever oh lord that where they settle in you amen the word is settled in you because you are heaven so emunah is feminist security of the word of the word of the lord just like abraham and the third is meth m-m-e-t-m-e sorry m oh come on e-m-e-t-h-m-e-m-e-t-h that is stability certainty truth and faithfulness so the word amen has got this three breakdown that the word of the lord is amen is ye is stable is certain is trustworthy is is worth putting all your hopes on it because it doesn't fill you you can go to sleep on the word of the lord amen amen you can have peace in the word of the lord amen people don't have peace that's right people don't have what you have somebody was telling me in texas and they don't have uh people from amarillo they don't have a and uh forgotten the places they don't have the facilities the hospitals that can um cure or whatever not cure treat a chronic virus so they drive people from all the way from like 10 hours to san antonio texas and just only go there to die oh man before they get there they're ready they call it vegetable they go there before they get hospital because the beds are they don't have even enough verse but then if you have java jarrah in you yes you can be affiliated with corona but you can stand on your feet and tell that demon enter the spirit of death don't you see the mark on me don't you see who i am don't you know that i'm not one of your victims don't you sing that i am elohim incarnated on earth don't you see that elohim is living in me don't you see them i'm the word of god expressed on earth you don't have any jurisdiction over this property amen this is what the lord has what lauded for himself i'm consecrated unto the lord i am the aiming of the lord and you don't have any power over me you speak that demon you speak whether it's coronav covet 19 whether it's cancer tumor just limit whatever situation that authority that attribute is you amen and when you voice this out it becomes yeah and amen because you are a dimension just like david so was take soul as a so no soul take goliath as a kona virus and take david as the healer as the healing there's this giant standing before david the children of israel everybody's run away but david knew who he was that he wasn't by himself no he wasn't just an 18 year old old chap he was what christ in manifestation he was a prophet a priest and a king the lord anointed him to be that amen and so he let that attribute out he transferred the battle to the he who lives in him to his royalty to the deity to jehovah to keno amen to jovah sharma the very present tense in the time of help and david test the situation in the name of the lord and he didn't have to battle just one stone j-e-s-u-e j-e-s-u-s diver where g jehovah yahweh yahshua he picked it jesus christ and just swung it by faith and it went all the way meaning through and with all the gulat was a was a giant right i don't know i can't imagine probably i can't reach it to his level right he did it there was a little tiny spot which wasn't covered that was the spot that the stone around there hit him amen the spot that the world cannot cover they can't cover prayer they don't believe in prayer they think prayer is fanatics they think the word is fanatics but when you go on your knees to pray that is a place that is not covered you might not need prayers now you and your family are good but when you go in that place that is not covered and you take that stone just one stone of prayer faith and you see even you pray and put the stamp of god among amen on it is trustworthy amen heaven said hey my son troy has prayed my daughter rebecca has prayed my son gary has prayed my all my sons and daughters are praying and the lord began to do something you know what for they are sick yes i'm healing the earth for they are sick i'm driving i'm calling a wormwood back take your hands from the earth i'm calling a satan demon of a killing demon of corona get away from the earth and things begin to change when you know our position amen glory hallelujah to the lord the lord he is good blessed be the name of the lord let's go a little bit into the prophet situation because we are reading let's look into abraham before we go to abraham abraham before we go to brahman amen abraham had a need his need was not wasn't co corner virus but he wanted a child yeah and it was childless but the lord does things in steps right sometimes he can do everything at once and give it to you sometimes you bring it one step the next step right and the next step before you bring the finality amen you might not see the finality might bring you you want a bible you might not give a bible i'll give a bible cover thank god for the bible cover god will not give you a bible cover without giving you a bible right so you've got you've got a bible cover you better swap go dancing around hey i've got my bible where's the bible it's in the cover i can't see it i can see it amen so you have got faith you move by faith just be happy advertise testify i've got my bible but that was the bible i don't see the bible in your cover yes the bible is right there the lord has put it there you see when the lord wants you to see it amen amen so the lord called abraham to be a father of nation and this man went to childless for many many years and the lord gave him a servant at least got a servant to inherit him that's right but that wasn't the satisfaction that's right he wanted his own son so he prayed and the lord gave him who his wife helped him to get to ishmael so he moved into a first pool festival is what the seven eliezer second pool is his own son his uh ishmael was his blood son he's coming from his own loins but it wasn't coming from the woman that the lord allotted it was a permissible of the lord yeah the lord bless it for him that this will make you a little happy so abraham take ishmael shabram was happy yeah until a certain point abraham knew that ishmael was going to be his son yeah even he said lord bless ishmael he's my son it's my from my own loins blessing the listener no that son has to come from between you and sarah right amen so as long as not between you and sarah yes i'll bless ishmael from hagar he's going to be a great man he's going to conquer nations and israel is the conquered nations you know if you know ishmael middle east israel and israel are still fighting now they are they are rich they've got all the oils they've got money they've got they can sponsor uh what they call it a sponsor al-qaeda sponsor evil terrorists in the world they've got money they've got religion they are conquering everywhere their religion is conquering every on their planet every nation you go ishmael is there israel is a great nation but ishmael is not the one that i spoke about amen the one i spoke about is going about isaac and finally the third pool came in isaac came in when he's already hundred and his wife's i was 90 from when they married from maybe in their 20s young men young women now they are already old men and old men when it was impossible completely impossible that is when the lord sent the promisson to father abraham amen and abraham believed the lord that's why i said it was if you read a greek version said it was credited to him if you read in english english he said it was accounted or something like that but the hebrew said it was accredited to him is to his credit that he was faithful the lord found him faithful believing the lord with all his heart that's right despite his condition despite his problems and his mistakes he still believed that he was faithful unto the lord or he counted the lord as being faithful amen so the lord put him through three pools the first pool of uh eliezer that was her servant secretary was a son but that was not a promising the third pool was isaac amen then the lord himself had a hidden pool that abram didn't even know about because when we building a house we don't build a house in a triangle if you look at this building it's got four corners one corner here this corner right third corner and fourth corner so the lord used eliezer he used ishmael he used isaac but there was a fourth son amen that was the lord jesus christ the son of the royal city of abraham now made the building complete amen all these three sons were human beings they were earthly but the first son is the jesus christ himself he was a royal seed of abraham the lord jesus christ amen and the lord fulfilled all of them so there's nothing that the lord didn't do everyone at one time he gave him a servant at least we've got somebody to inherit you he gave him ishmael and he was happy abraham wouldn't have bothered to have isaac he as a human being was satisfied with the ishmael but the lord wasn't satisfied with the ishmael sarah who brought who helped bring ishmael out was so dis satisfied with ishmael when ishmael and mum were mocking her so now they have to what the lord satisfy abraham and sarah with isaac but then the lord has to satisfy himself and abraham and sarah with perfection four is a number of deliverance three is perfection one is uh omnipotent all alone two is number of multiplication by by the lord three is perfection four is the number of deliverance so the lord has to bring deliverance among the royal seat of abraham amen because isaac cannot deliver you an eye but the rest of abraham jesus christ is a tenor he's god himself amen praise be to god the lord he is good i want us to read something from the quotes of the prophet blessed be the name of the lord and let's see how we can intercede for our nations for our family for ourselves that the lord will heal our land that we pray that there will be a vast sin for the people of the world amen you might not need a bar sin but there's somebody who needs a mercy so the lord will throw the land and take discover that way let's read glory be to god let's read the uh the message conference with god 60-01 conference with god the prophet said he said if there's any if there's any in divine presence who is sick and needy may they leave this meeting tonight well middle of this meeting tonight well if there's any without hope without god without christ may they go with a couple a cup running over with joy that they had found jesus the inexhaustible fountain of eternal life granted lord hear our prayers and speak to us through thy word for we ask in jesus christ's name i'm afraid of is asking are you afraid of the new breath what makes it because it is kind of messy to them but it brings forth new life i'm so glad paragraph 45 you know there was a time when there were there wasn't any toxin on earth for smallpox in other words like there was no vaccination many died was many many died with smallpox because there was no toxin diphtheria no toxin but now you have got inoculated from that when an epidemic breaks out in the city quickly you go down and get a smallpox vaccination or a deterioration they got toxin i'm thankful for that i'm glad for that i'm glad we got it and the sac vaccination for little children i thank the lord for that i pray that he will give us more and more so from here it means the lord who gave all the sacrifice nation fascination for diphtheria vaccination for different things talking about and he said we pray that the lord will give us more okay let's see i believe that if you just warm up to god there's there's things here for us we was made out we was made out of the earth you know if we just warm up to god and pray to him and quit our wickedness and things all these things will be found that's right but for you who believe so he's talking to two categories of people it's called talking to the nation the word america and the world who don't believe god who wouldn't take god at his word if they can create their wickedness political wickedness uh what they call it a civil wickedness and all their weakness in the world if the leaders and the people will quit it and i mean warm up to god in other words give their heart to the lord the lord will give them breakthrough even for blessings things that they need for because those time they didn't have a sin for cancer different things so if they quit but now he came to the believer he said now you who believe you who believe be you who are abraham's seed who are christ so now this is what he's telling you he said let's see pray and things like that you who you who believe is that you for you who believe he's got a remedy beyond that amen is what the remedy beyond vaccine suck vasin and the and and the vaccination he's got a remedy beyond that certainly he has now it's all made and ready for you 46. there was a time when the toxin there wasn't any and many people died from the diseases but now you've got to you've got you can be inoculated there was a time when gas bomb wasn't perfect because it was drawn from the veins of animals it only covers sin it didn't divorce it but there's no excuse now god one day made a toxin i'm going to say something he didn't try to he didn't try it on a guinea pig either he gave it to his son he inoculated him at the jordan when the holy ghost came down upon him every every eye watched him as he lived he lived the life of god he looked like god he acted like god he lived like god he prayed like god he healed like god he raised the dead like god he was god god was he was the he was inoculated from the things of the world and they watch him amen and 47 and i thank god for every serum for the silk vasin pray pray constantly that god would give us something for cancer so there was no nothing for cancer then that's right praying constantly that the god will give us something for cancer for poor suffering people anything can can do anything can do to help i'm for it yes sir i'm 100 for it and if you are christian people would you pray more for certain as that we will be better off the whole country would yes great men they give their lives just trying to fight back at those things that crippled children and everything certainly in other words people scientists were researching because people were born crippled and there was nothing they could do for them people with their children a lot of diseases in those times that's why they gave back to a lot of large family if you listen give it to sister children and five survive all alive praise god if you get ten and two or five survive praise god those time they marry very early 14 16 because people died just like that there wasn't this fascination and distance on earth but by the grace of god the prophet's time he was praying for more and now his prayer has brought cancer vaccine because they pretty didn't have cancer chemotherapy and radiation and all those uh not cancer vaccine but on all those camera cancer remedies that we have now but through that they've got it now now we've got chronovirus that the scientists don't have the vase in so it's you and i our duty to pray that they break through because not everybody can receive divine healing like you can do not everybody has got elohim in him not everybody has got holy ghost in him nobody not everybody has got even a representative in him but yes on earth we all need blessing amen on earth you are not a farmer but yes so you eat every day we don't know where the food is coming from somebody farm they their hands are carlos you know they do planting they do hoeing and they wake up and do things we don't know what goes on in that world but then we god has blessed us to have grocery uh what farmers market wherever you go and buy your corn buy or whatever you buy and come and prepare your food that's a blessing so the lord has put you on earth you and i on earth to pray even for certain that there could be a breakthrough so that we are not happy when people are dying it doesn't matter what are they your family or they are your country they are human beings amen amen the devil cannot create one one human being you cannot create one iota of cell in your body he's not a creator he's only can pervert and destroy but jesus christ came to give life and give it abundantly amen so your prayers you might not see it today but your prayers can change situation let me give example when i was in texas i think it was a bush time probably before bush or something early obama's time the price of gasoline was so high i don't know here it was almost i think four dollars and something per gallon it was like so this is too much because you get your paycheck and a lot of them go to gas especially when you have to drive like an hour or 30 minutes to work so when there was a gas station and something came out i had that god can hear everything it doesn't have to be sickness and i pray lord let the price of gas come down amen i just prayed in my heart or whatever it began became a prayer topic for me for some time and i left it probably within a year or more or less the prices begin to america begin to draw oil and the prices in the middle east they kind of have the price their prices came down because now the whole world is drilling unlike fest america had an oil but they wanted to con reserve it for whatever but now they begin to draw they call it baby draw when obama came drew baby drill and clinton and coal so we will begin to draw so now the price is not wasn't detected only by the mother east who was sponsoring terrorism the price came i remember i bought a gas price for less than a dollar 96 cent and i was a disney this wedding is for food it didn't matter how long it took it didn't matter the politics and listen but my i can't say for myself because i go and buy gas price for almost four dollars or a little more than four dollars but now it's less than two dollars somewhere good gas station less than a dollar you can fill your tank with about twenty dollars or less it's the grace of the lord so the lord has put you in if you only can believe all things are possible if you only will let yourself go don't think about it speak it and believe it pray it and the lord will let it come to pass amen so we are not troubled there could be a vaccine tomorrow there could be a vaseline next year to help suffer mankind so you and i our prayer can go help that amen we might not be the one developing the vast sin we might not be the scientist but your prayer can give a breakthrough the lord will listen to my daughters are praying in west palm beach my sons and daughters are praying let me give vase in a breakthrough it doesn't matter where it's coming from amen and it's chronovirus we contain so that we can also be expressed ourselves more better than we than we are now amen glory be to the lord praise god so there's nothing there's something in you divine attribute of christ in you that surpasses everything that is way beyond your problems amen if you can god will help us to specialize in yielding being sensitive to the lord and yielding to the lord sometimes your mind can battle you with troubles your mind can tell you you can't do this this is limited you can't go this way this problem is not going to be solved this sickness everyone that gets sickness died in my family my grandfather died of cancer my great-grandfather died of cancer this one out of tumor and here i am oh here my family member is diagnosed he's the one going next but if you can all the children you can tell your mind to shut up right tell the man to shut up like let me use that phrase for example the anima that chatter in the phrase is what is the squirrel coco is chatting everywhere as if he's the king of the forest meanwhile the lion who is the king of the forest will be just be somewhere quiet but when the lion steps in when it's time for the lion to eat and he steps up from his from his uh i won't say hiding place but from his from his little uh habitat where he lives and he give a yell womb even the ant the elephant the butterfly all of them know that the king has arrived everybody shut up the squirrel who's been chattering shut up he doesn't just have to go into the you know they have burrows in the in the trees he goes deep into the barrel and when hide the kid is here i don't want no trouble the same thing doesn't matter the problem if you the king of christ queen jesus christ in jesus christ the holy ghost in you if you can believe that christ in you and you pray and speak the word don't worry about how when you might not have to do nothing to do with it yours is just a prayers yours is just the word the rest could be the politicians the worlds could be the city it could be the nation it could be whoever it could be the doctors your word will push them to do what needs to be done amen amen your prayers will push them to line things for you the way you want it you might not you might not even have to vote to frankly i don't vote because if i don't have a candidate i won't vote right but i don't whoever god needs to put it there to fulfill the purpose of god god will put him there i don't have to fight about who's going to be in office it's not my problem whoever wants to be there whether they make the whole country gay it doesn't matter it doesn't matter they will fulfill the word of the lord you don't have to do nothing to do with it you believe the word and whoever god put it there go to fulfill his word amen let me read you something here brown talk about in his time amen he talked about kennedy there was a problem and kennedy sent a military to the south and let's see how even god used politicians for the word of god hebrew series hebrews series chapter 1 57-0821 hebrews paragraph 119 is that i see where our president mr kennedy tom i believe his name is kennedy that sent down sent down for this so many offices down for this segregational war he sent down 400 and something down in the south to stop the segregation award and when he ended up at his four course they could send no more he had exactly 666 it was in times magazine oh if people was only spiritual could wake up and see what it is 666 exactly what they had that's them that is in this month's time kennedy send people to the south to stop a segregation award and when he finished sending the military he had sent six six six people and kennedy was the first catholic president of the united states so even the politicians god is using them to fulfill the word of god it might not be the positivity you are fulfilling but god put them there amen so you don't have to worry about politicians you don't have to worry about black lives matter and wildlife matter right ours is what jesus christ matters amen christ for all nations amen christ for everybody whether blue green yellow white cream everybody is a creator of god creature of god amen we are one people amen where we live is what would give us our colors but we are one and same human humankind amen so the lord is using anybody to fulfill his word everybody and anybody but you as god as you are especially the exaggeration of the lord the lord has made you in a special way to fulfill a part of the world not everybody can fulfill and that's why we have to what wake up to our ministry now what is going on in earth right now is nothing strange it has happened over an hour before god allows uh things to happen to fulfill his work because he's moving this earth this has restart now it's not the way way it was before uh before the time of noah before the time of nowhere they don't they don't have long day and short night they don't have to adjust their watches they didn't even have watches then watches were developed by the swiss invented by the streets swiss people but now the sun light or the earth equally so we don't have like now it's a 134 here if you go to england it's four hours different so 5 34 somewhere or five hours difference you go to africa africa it's about four hours you go to china they're already monday philippines some are already monday because they're in the east the sun begins there before we see the sun but the lord allowed it in the time of noah the earth was shifted who shifted the earth one wood a wood worm there's an angel who controlled the waters and he's the one the lord sent on earth to shift the earth to bring the rain because in the time of noah before noah there was nothing like rain there was no cloud in the atmosphere you can't they didn't have this bible we read they read their bible from the zodiac they could see the sun and the movement of the sun tells them what the lord is doing on earth the moon the stars but then the lord wanted to bring more attribute clouds because he committed clouds so the lord formed clouds in the time of noah and the earth was before the water the other waters were around the earth we didn't have like six and seven continents we have now so now we have got the earth has been divided into seven to tell the seven church ages that was going to come they were all part of the word of the lord god was fulfilling the seven churches now we have gone through the seven churches beyond we are in the eighth day or back to tennessee when the seven churches are over christ is here right now dealing with his wife dealing with his people you and i amen so now god wants to go back to the beginning where there was no uh the way he made the earth in the beginning so all this going on uh hurricanes uh when he spoke remember 63 when the seas were open the lord told abram to pick up a rock right and say throw it in the air and he said earthquake will hit alaska the angel of the lord is the one that caused the earthquake and there has been a cascade of earthquake tornadoes movement shifting the earth to bring the earth back to where it used to be the way the lord wanted it to be because he's for keep on fulfilling his word so there's nothing strange about corona and the hurricanes and the earthquake the lord knows it all amen he's the one who's sitting on the throne and i want us to read something about what the lord taught about um the angel that moves the water blessed be the name of the lord warm wood let's see god is great okay here we go and the hour has come the message the hour has come five one zero five one zero four one five e paragraph 25 5 1 0 4 1 5 e the hour has come rama was talking about the angels paragraph 25 said i can hear gabriel okay let me skip that and go now i can hear gabriel say i'll go down and i'll strike babylon off the map of the map if you let me go down there you consider them i can hear the master see that is gabriel god dealing with the angels before something happened on earth god holds a conference in heaven and the lord determines what to be done on earth yes gabriel you're a wonderful angel you've obeyed me and sat at my right hand ever since the day that i created you but i can't let you go just can't let you go then i see coming this way another angel you know ghost got angels in heaven at his command i can see another angel coming up look at him he rash up he's called warm wood sometimes you brown call it wood worm the same thing he falls down he has controls of all the waters all the waters on the planet one wood is the one who is in charge i can hear him say master down in babylon your children has took a stand and they are going to throw them in the fiery furnace this morning they're almost there and i've i've stood by your side since you created me i have the controls of the water in the anti-diluvian distraction that is you know as time i broke up the spring of the deep i swept over the earth and destroyed the whole world with water let me go down there this morning i'll wash her off the face of the earth and that's the angel asking the lord if the lord if you permit me you know i did that job for you in no worse time watch all the sins and kill other people right so let's keep going he said let me go say let me go down there this morning i washed her off the surface of the mouth i believe you could have done it don't you i can i can hear him say can't the lord didn't the lord didn't allow it because himself was going to go amen right now let's read another another message another quote from message uh what thank you of christ what thank you of christ 51-09-308-51-0930 what thank you of christ paragraph 83 from this side comes another angel his wormwood the one who has control over the water saying master have you looked down in babylon why you give me the jurisdiction over the unto the anti-deliverance distraction i broke up the springs of the deep and rain the waters out of the heaven i washed the earth off let me go down there this morning i'll wash babylon of the face of the earth i believe he could have done it eighty-four i can hear him say woodward you've been a good angel you've done you've done just what i told you in anti-delivery and distraction you cleared the earth and saved noah but i can't let you go so i want you to take turns over this he cleared the earth he didn't only destroy right but you saved noah yeah the same engine that brought the flood in nowhere's time he's the one that was protecting no one noah and his people could have what could have perished amen because it wasn't if you read the story it was it was flood it's not just a little flood right on the face of the earth right the lord was destroying that's a destroying angel and noah with the act that they built how could have the eye could have stood but it was in the same uh wormwood standing there protecting the ark that no demon can touch abraham and his group because abraham and his group are specially designated designation of the lord they are the word of god made flesh for that hour and abraham and noah received the word of the lord and his household and they believe the word and they're receiving their word they have become part of god and god cannot destroy himself and be god you can't take your arms off just stick take a knife cutting yourself up and it still be rather quick no you destroy yourself you're gone right so god cannot destroy you that's good and still be god he cannot destroy you and still be god because you are part of your designation of him amen so regardless of what is going on there's an angel of the lord protecting iran said that um there's going to be a prophecy about this he said there's going to be diseases that the doctors cannot do nothing about it they wouldn't have disease they won't have uh cure for it but those is that for those who don't have the baptism of the holy ghost they'll be swept but those who have got a baptism which is the seal of the lord they'll be spared they'll be protected because you are the remnant of the lord so the holy ghost that you receive the message i received that people mock you you suffered for it you lost your job you lost different things you lost your popularity that message is what is keeping you now and that message is what you are putting over your loved ones amen just like i said abraham wasn't selfish when the lord came and he was going to destroy sodom abraham didn't watch god oh yeah my my cousin a lot my nephew lord was stubborn he didn't listen to me he didn't believe my word yeah go go get him go destroy him right he didn't do like that that's not the spirit of christ yeah he doesn't like me you know he took the big that was my promise i need to the promise for himself and his family yeah here they go let them perish abraham stood in their way abraham said it's not worthy for a man to talk to god i want to ask you one question he said lord if you find 50 before i go to the strategy he said no there's a lot it's not i'm for a man to talk to god face to face i mean some head off but let me ask one more if you find 40 begin to bargain with god like you know what there might be 50 people lord spare them and he bargained to about five or ten there wasn't not even enough five people who were righteous who were doing the word of the lord beside lord and the lost the lord said you know what i'll spell out your your nephew for you so he sent to angels and they went and what they spent pull out out before they burn the city and before anything could touch the earth you will not be here in the earth amen before something will touch down here the lord will protect you from here because jovanisi his job rapha he heals your sickness you are you are the expression of god and that's what the lord wanted us to know just like abraham everyone was mourning and yelling lord i have no child because he hasn't come to know that the harm has not been added to his name he believed god though he trusted god but he was looking at himself that i've passed beyond age and the person that i was hurting is my slave born in my house but the lord said no abraham not a slave but i will bring the promise to pass amen you are not going to go with the wind you are not going to go with the world you are not going to perish with the world the lord has protected you the lord has designated an angel one mood is here there is an anger of the lord the lord jesus christ himself is here on earth he's living in you he's in the atmosphere he's all around you to protect you and your loved ones amen and all that we need to do is believe him and the more you believe in you even think about your protection you now go beyond you abraham went beyond him and begin to what bargain for a lot begin to think about lord we can you the world will despise you people will despise you people that are dear to you will mock you they will call you names they will make you better they will walk down upon you they will destroy they'll call you fanatic they'll call you they have all kinds of names you know especially our sisters for the way they dress they call you all kind of names but you should be happy and rejoice that's right that you've been chosen of the lord you're not chosen by a man no you're not chasing by your family it's not your dad with you but the lord himself chose you the pastor didn't come and beg you like oh please come and follow my church no please i need 100 people in my check please you just come i'll give you ten dollars you know i'll give you twenty dollars no come to check this one i'll give you i'll buy something for you no i'll make shopping for you i'll give you a gift card no but the lord himself brought you here and you have a purpose for you spending your time to sit here to hear from your pastor to hear from the ministers to pray to dress to portray christ yes you are doing it there's somebody so when there's chaos you can go to your bed and sleep because shalom is you are shalom amen you are the eternal truth of the lord there's nothing that can take your life if the lord finishes the lord hasn't finished with you when the lord is finishing you'll be singing sons of zion and you break into the atmosphere you are a pillar of fire and the more we get to know who we are the more we can express the attributes amen until abraham got to know who he was yes he has praised the lord but he was limited but when the lord came to admit abraham i'm going to make you maybe you don't know that you are part of me i'm adding harm to you i'm letting you know that you are just like i was elohim all by myself and you were all in me not expressed on earth until i began to create adam i'm going to create more of you something that will come from you not a servant that was born in your house not a servant but your own son coming from your loins will be the one who inherits you and everyone was surprised how come i'm already 19 my wife is go way beyond menopause but he believed the lord as we read from the bible and as long as the lord said it he put an aim into it a man to it immunity to it that is ye and amen amen it's established that's right there's nothing that is going to change the man of god so he went with it and the rest was not abram's problem the lord took care of everything amen and whatever the lord has promised you in your heart whatever you are expecting from the lord put before the lord it doesn't matter the conditions around you or in you your situ your human situation is the word of the lord and as you believe it you profess it it's already fulfilled amen the battle is over i don't have to fight your battle transfer to the be like david be like abraham believe it and the word will manifest himself in you praise be to the lord glory be to the lord there's nothing that is impossible with the lord with the lord the lord saves and he saves completely he's adonai his elohim is that i am that i am sometime when i i read the bible and look at those attributes i am when moses came to him and said he called moses he said go and rescue my people and say lord if i go and ask me what is your name saturday i am that i am i am who i am amen there's only one person who can say that that's right it's a king that's right just a president so who i tell the president if you don't know if the president united states you know donald trump so he said the president there's only one president in the united states if you go outside you have another president right but when you come to the universe there's only one christ that's right there's only one elohim there's only one i am there's only one person who can say i am that i am amen and if i am missing you what is your problem let i am go to work amen glory don't fear nothing amen don't be don't be afraid yes we do everything but don't let fear grip you glory that is not your portion amen you can speak your the word it doesn't matter and the disease will take go away amen you can pray and the holy ghost will command the angel that such and such a person pray my daughter pray for this person go get him at the hospital take your hands off him and the person will come back home amen you can pray somebody in some somewhere not even here in west palm beach the lord can use your prayer because your prayer is not limited to the room it's not limited to you your flesh it's not limited to your strength your prayer is the prayer of the word of elohim i am that i am and when you pray and speak the word of i am take creative power there are four four elements that elohim uses amen he uses the water look at where the hurricanes come from we talk about warm wood he controls the water if the lord wants to send hurricane for some reason he just can't create hurricane on whatever ocean atlantic ocean you might not see the angel but before realized there was a hurricane and most of the time it's coming from africa right some attributed to so many things i don't know but it's coming from somewhere pacific ocean and goes somewhere else where they're having a uh southern uh i think that was i forgotten at the time by the year when they were in louisiana they were having a gay festival they called it southern uh forgot to wait for it but we haven't given this festival hurricane katrina went and swept human beings as if it was sweeping ants sudden cut against whatever i forgot to wait but when the lord wants to do something they can just call one wood just a snap of a finger a woman will go and take and create the hurricane uses the water to swing reduce create a hurricane and take off situation the way he wanted if you want to use fire fire does not necessarily bush fire we have bushfires in california different places but fire is the war when there's war in battles that is a fire the lord can set up an angel the devil the devil is the anointed politicians and they go into war blow you and i blow you they do their war if there's water if there's air like we have krona it's in the air you don't see it physically but then it's the air in the atmosphere the same only goes the same holy ghost has got angel of the lord here who can say stop and the corona will stop right at once there was a thin second world war they didn't sign a treat treaty the law sent an angel to stop the war that was stopping uh the 11th month which is november the 11th hour the 11th day the 11 minutes the 11th second to ocean in the 11th hour libra workers the lord has an angels here you might not see them flying around you want to see them in your room but it's the angel of the lord you have a guardian a personal guardian angel each one of you as a son of god as the daughter of god that's why the lord wants you to be holy unto the lord because when you do certain things you keep away the angel the angels hate evil they hate wickedness they hate sin so as long as you let god take over your flesh take over your mind take over your heart and let the world go away the lord has come control and nothing can touch you amen you might be working the most dangerous place the people who are holding guns will salute you hello hello sis because they could see that you you can't be the attacker they are even afraid there was a time john wesley was going to preach on horses and he didn't have a vehicle so someone wanted to kill wesley and he went with his gun or whatever hiding under a bridge where wesley was i mean galloping his horse right and when wesley didn't know anything about somebody trying wanted to kill him he didn't know he was singing his songs and rejoicing and going to do his work and when the person wanted to kill wesley when he so wesley he saw a fire around him and he was like overwhelmed he saw a ball of fire around wesley and he surrendered to wesley that i wanted to do this and lose it to you but i saw you at the you are the holy one you are the one of the holy one he wouldn't touch wesley until the lord finished with wesley and he died at eight something eight years of age so there's nothing that can touch you unless you do something you obey god as a child of god the only thing that can take your life prematurely you do something god will stop you and you keep doing evil upon evil god will send ministers to send people to warn you and he said this the evil i'm going to do it and god will not let you disgrace him on earth so at time of come god cannot help you push god's hands to take you from the earth prematurely but beside that no demon no devil no sickness no corona can touch your life because you are of christ amen shall we close shall we pray heavenly father we thank you for this word we thank you for the word of life we thank you for what you've given to us today blessed father i pray for us my lord father in times of
