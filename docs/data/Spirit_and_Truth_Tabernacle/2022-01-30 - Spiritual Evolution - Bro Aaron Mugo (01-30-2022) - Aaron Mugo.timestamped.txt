[54:23] prayer request for his daughter
[54:25] erica
[54:26] she's been going through a number of
[54:28] things and um and lately the doctors are
[54:31] kind of advising that she
[54:34] think a blood count is down in some kind
[54:36] of way cells are down and they're trying
[54:38] to maybe do an infusion or whatever
[54:40] she's just been fighting young young
[54:43] sister maybe early 40s or something like
[54:45] that i think three kids and husband
[54:48] and they're doing all they can just to
[54:50] try to help her so he just asked that
[54:51] all the churches churches would just be
[54:53] in prayer and man for her so we want to
[54:56] remember sister erica and man in our
[54:58] prayers on today
[55:00] and
[55:02] just trust that god will touch her amen
[55:04] in some some way god would touch and
[55:06] work a miracle on her behalf so let's
[55:09] just stand to our feet
[55:11] and um
[55:12] we will uh have word of prayer and then
[55:15] we'll um
[55:16] also invite our precious brother aaron
[55:18] out amen
[55:21] let's pray
[55:23] father
[55:23] [Music]
[55:25] um
[55:26] a precious brother reagan has requested
[55:29] prayer for his daughter
[55:31] lord
[55:33] you've seen everything that she has been
[55:35] going through the the
[55:38] the fight she's having inside of her
[55:40] body
[55:41] but we know according to your word
[55:44] you told us it is your will for us to be
[55:46] in good health and to prosper even as
[55:49] our soul prospers
[55:51] so father we rebuke this enemy
[55:54] god satan and all of his demons that are
[55:57] coming against sister erica right now we
[55:59] rebuke it in the name of jesus because
[56:01] you told us in your word that what we
[56:03] bind on earth shall be bound in heaven
[56:06] and what we loose on earth shall be
[56:07] loosed in heaven so we we bind the hands
[56:10] of satan that's at work and we lose the
[56:12] presence of god to saturate her entire
[56:15] body lord that it will function the way
[56:18] that you designed it to function and
[56:20] lord may you give her a miracle may you
[56:22] work all things out father for your
[56:23] glory and for your honor and as we begin
[56:26] to turn the service now father to the
[56:28] preaching of the word we actually should
[56:29] use brother aaron
[56:31] god in only a way that you can minister
[56:33] through him to us that we would be
[56:35] edified
[56:36] lord and that your name will be
[56:38] magnified in this place it's in jesus
[56:40] name that we pray
[56:42] amen
[56:45] amen
[56:49] seeing grace
[56:52] how sweet
[56:55] the
[56:56] sound
[56:58] that
[57:00] saved

[1:01:16] time i walk in the building he greets me
[1:01:18] says how many days left and i never
[1:01:20] remember
[1:01:21] and
[1:01:22] he says you better find out cause she
[1:01:24] knows
[1:01:27] i heard that today and i was like yeah
[1:01:28] she certainly knows i better remember
[1:01:30] that
[1:01:31] but um
[1:01:32] i thank you guys for all your support
[1:01:34] and all the love and so many people have
[1:01:38] given us great advice and given us
[1:01:41] physical gifts so many different things

[1:01:52] day with you i hope each and every one
[1:01:53] of you makes it out
[1:01:55] uh yeah it's gonna be great
[1:01:58] yeah god's in it all right let's go to
[1:02:00] uh genesis chapter one
[1:02:04] and we're going to go to verse 26 this
[1:02:06] morning
[1:02:12] genesis 1 26
[1:02:14] we're going to read three verses there
[1:02:20] 26 starts with
[1:02:22] and god said let us make man in our
[1:02:24] image after our likeness
[1:02:26] and let them have dominion over the fish
[1:02:29] of the sea and over the fowl of the air
[1:02:31] and over the cattle and over all the
[1:02:33] earth
[1:02:34] and over every creeping thing that
[1:02:36] creepeth upon the earth
[1:02:39] so god created man in his own image in
[1:02:41] the image of god created he him man male
[1:02:44] and female created he them
[1:02:47] and god blessed them and said unto them
[1:02:48] be fruitful and multiply and replenish
[1:02:51] the earth and subdue it and have
[1:02:53] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[1:02:54] over the file of the air and over every
[1:02:55] living thing that moveth upon the earth
[1:02:58] you may be seated
[1:03:04] you know
[1:03:06] when god
[1:03:11] god created man
[1:03:13] and
[1:03:14] we were created in his image that's what
[1:03:17] the scripture tells us
[1:03:19] and
[1:03:19] he created us as the highest
[1:03:22] form of life that could be created
[1:03:25] and
[1:03:26] that is in the image of god
[1:03:28] so we can believe hey i'm i'm pretty
[1:03:31] good because i am as close to god as
[1:03:33] you're gonna get in nature
[1:03:35] you can think that about yourself that's
[1:03:37] a wonderful thing
[1:03:39] now
[1:03:40] uh
[1:03:41] this
[1:03:42] this topic i'm going to talk on today is
[1:03:45] actually called spiritual evolution
[1:03:48] and
[1:03:49] i want to show you how god has evolved
[1:03:53] us
[1:03:54] and how that matches exactly
[1:03:56] well not exactly but
[1:03:58] pretty closely to how science evolved us
[1:04:01] as well according to their take on
[1:04:03] things which is not correct
[1:04:05] so
[1:04:06] i'm going to talk about what evolution
[1:04:07] is at the beginning and i just want you
[1:04:10] to bear with me because i'm going to
[1:04:11] build a lot and then we're going to hit
[1:04:12] some all right
[1:04:14] all right so
[1:04:16] evolution in science says that
[1:04:19] we were
[1:04:20] first
[1:04:21] we started out as little single cell
[1:04:24] organisms and these are like bacteria or
[1:04:27] germs or something like that and then
[1:04:30] each time that we moved to a new
[1:04:32] environment we got bigger we got
[1:04:34] stronger and then eventually we became
[1:04:37] human beings so we went through bacteria
[1:04:40] we became plants and then
[1:04:42] uh moved on up and up until you get
[1:04:44] animals that move around and so many
[1:04:46] different things until you get to a
[1:04:47] chimpanzee and stuff like that and then
[1:04:50] boom human so that's how evolution works
[1:04:52] in science now
[1:04:54] that theory actually came
[1:04:57] it was probably floated around for a
[1:04:59] while but it got really big with charles
[1:05:01] darwin
[1:05:02] he wrote this book called the origin of
[1:05:04] species
[1:05:05] now i'm sure a lot of you have heard all
[1:05:08] of this in school i'm just going over it
[1:05:10] again because you need to remember it
[1:05:12] so
[1:05:13] he writes this book and then the
[1:05:14] communists and the nazis they take this
[1:05:16] and they run with it and they use that
[1:05:19] for their political agenda because
[1:05:20] they're against god
[1:05:22] and in the time that brother branham was
[1:05:24] preaching and he was ministering people
[1:05:27] thought communism was the mark of the
[1:05:29] beast because this spirit of thinking
[1:05:32] that science had the answer to where we
[1:05:34] came from and what we're going to
[1:05:37] that spirit was so strong that he you
[1:05:40] know everybody just thought it was the
[1:05:41] mark of the beast it's totally the end
[1:05:43] because the cold war was coming around
[1:05:45] so uh
[1:05:47] there is a lot of false out there and it
[1:05:51] is
[1:05:51] interesting whenever you go to the
[1:05:53] message and you actually see brother
[1:05:54] branham says that he believed in
[1:05:56] evolution
[1:05:57] if you look at some quotes so i had a
[1:05:59] lot of quotes on that but i broke it
[1:06:01] down to a couple of them we're going to
[1:06:02] the mark of the beast
[1:06:04] 1961 and the seal of god
[1:06:09] it says i believe in evolution you can't
[1:06:12] argue with that he said that the first
[1:06:14] thing maybe when there was nothing but
[1:06:16] just plain chaos volcanic eruption
[1:06:20] you know god's a great contractor you
[1:06:22] believe that a great contractor always
[1:06:25] lays out all of his stuff when he builds
[1:06:27] his subdivision
[1:06:28] god when he was moving the earth around
[1:06:30] creating calcium potash petroleum and so
[1:06:34] forth he was laying our bodies on the
[1:06:36] earth right then
[1:06:39] the material that we're made out of and
[1:06:41] the holy spirit went out from god you
[1:06:43] see
[1:06:44] i already told you what science thought
[1:06:46] of evolution but i like the way that the
[1:06:49] prophet actually takes these things he
[1:06:50] has a spiritual side he's able to see
[1:06:52] all sorts of things and he takes the
[1:06:54] scientific side they have a an idea it
[1:06:57] just wasn't really balanced out right so
[1:06:59] he takes that and pushes it with the
[1:07:01] word and it works just perfectly
[1:07:04] see i'm not against science i love
[1:07:06] science i find it really interesting
[1:07:09] it's very wrong a lot of the time
[1:07:11] but i feel like science just confirms
[1:07:14] what god has
[1:07:15] confirms all the laws of science that
[1:07:17] you see written out there they actually
[1:07:20] confirm god's word
[1:07:22] okay where'd i stop there hallelujah and
[1:07:24] the great holy spirit went out from god
[1:07:26] to brood over the earth or coo
[1:07:29] make love like a hen her brood and his
[1:07:32] let's think he had wings he did not but
[1:07:34] let's think he had wings like a hen over
[1:07:36] a brood
[1:07:37] he began to brood over the earth
[1:07:39] and i can see some calcium coming run
[1:07:41] running down a little place mixing up
[1:07:43] with some moisture and podash and a
[1:07:45] little easter flower come out then i can
[1:07:46] hear him say come here father and look
[1:07:48] at this
[1:07:49] you see if
[1:07:50] if you look in the scripture we read in
[1:07:52] genesis it says let us make man in our
[1:07:56] image so you know
[1:07:58] the holy spirit's talking to the father
[1:08:00] that's the us he's talking about right
[1:08:02] there that's a little nugget if you ever
[1:08:03] never thought about that
[1:08:05] all right come to your father and look
[1:08:07] at this very good keep on brooding after
[1:08:09] a while brood a little more what come
[1:08:11] out next was probably the flowers and
[1:08:12] the vegetations and the birds flew out
[1:08:15] of the dust of the earth and then come
[1:08:16] the animal life and kept getting higher
[1:08:18] life higher life higher life until
[1:08:20] finally a man come up in the very image
[1:08:22] of god strange something didn't come up
[1:08:26] higher than that wasn't it
[1:08:28] can't get no higher right it was the
[1:08:30] image of god glory
[1:08:32] evolution brings it up like that
[1:08:35] so
[1:08:38] man was created after six days right on
[1:08:41] the sixth day
[1:08:42] god started with lower things he said
[1:08:45] let there be light and then he built up
[1:08:47] and then he built up and then you get
[1:08:48] the plant life then you get the animal
[1:08:50] life the very last day he convert can he
[1:08:53] um
[1:08:55] he
[1:08:56] i forgot what that word is but he yes he
[1:08:58] dedicated that whole day just for man
[1:09:01] he dedicated the whole day just for you
[1:09:04] just for me so that's how important he
[1:09:07] was because
[1:09:08] you can't like if we're created in the
[1:09:10] image of god you can't just make god
[1:09:12] just like that he's complex you know
[1:09:15] we are triune beings there's a lot to us
[1:09:18] you know even if that first day he was
[1:09:20] making us in the spirit a spirit by
[1:09:23] itself is so complicated
[1:09:25] it can
[1:09:26] it can change so many things like one
[1:09:28] spirit in this room affects all of us
[1:09:32] other spirits can affect certain ones of
[1:09:34] us
[1:09:35] groups of us over here some spirits are
[1:09:37] on one person some spirits aren't many
[1:09:40] people there are so many different
[1:09:41] spirits positive and negative and god
[1:09:44] just
[1:09:45] creates one just like him in that one
[1:09:47] day i'm surprised it only took him one
[1:09:49] day but that's god right
[1:09:51] now he he creates that spirit and in not
[1:09:55] only that but if you actually think
[1:09:56] about it if you look in the bible god
[1:09:59] anytime he takes the the the form
[1:10:02] anytime he uses uh
[1:10:04] the body of a creature
[1:10:07] and actually speaks and acts through
[1:10:09] that body
[1:10:10] it's going to be through a human
[1:10:12] he always uses a human yes he used that
[1:10:15] donkey with balaam and that but he just
[1:10:17] spoke through it he wasn't actually you
[1:10:18] know doing works or anything like that
[1:10:21] whenever he came to abraham he used a
[1:10:22] body whenever he came in the form of
[1:10:24] jesus christ he used a body whenever
[1:10:26] moses saw him pass by like that the back
[1:10:28] of him was like the form of a man
[1:10:30] because
[1:10:31] we are in his image he wasn't
[1:10:34] it wasn't that far of a stretch for him
[1:10:36] to step into a body or to use a body
[1:10:38] like that because we are just that high
[1:10:41] on the food chain
[1:10:42] so
[1:10:45] i i know that's just one quote where he
[1:10:47] says he believes in evolution let me
[1:10:48] read a few more just a few more
[1:10:51] present stage of my ministry 1962.
[1:10:55] now this might be good some of you high
[1:10:57] school kids is getting this stuff taught
[1:10:58] to you here about evolution now i
[1:11:00] believe in evolution but not in the way
[1:11:03] that men evoluted from some lower
[1:11:05] species
[1:11:06] their own theory backfires on them when
[1:11:08] they try to hybrid anything it won't
[1:11:11] breed itself back
[1:11:13] so you see it's backfired on them now i
[1:11:15] believe that when god began to bathe the
[1:11:17] earth maybe the first thing he did
[1:11:19] come forth was a jellyfish from from
[1:11:21] that up to a frog and on up but you see
[1:11:23] it's continually come closer and closer
[1:11:25] to the image of man and man was a
[1:11:28] reflection of god and that's the reason
[1:11:30] that grass became evoluted maybe grass
[1:11:33] and then from grass and flowers and
[1:11:34] flowers and shrubs shrubs come tree why
[1:11:37] it's a picture of the tree of life
[1:11:39] standing on the other side and
[1:11:41] everything on this side that's natural
[1:11:44] is a shadow of the supernatural or
[1:11:46] eternal on the other side
[1:11:48] therefore as long as there's a
[1:11:49] born-again christian on the earth and we
[1:11:51] got a body here like this it's the very
[1:11:53] reflection
[1:11:54] of one that's waiting on the other side
[1:11:56] where there is no death and sorrow
[1:11:58] countdown 1962.
[1:12:01] [Music]
[1:12:02] and then the last thing that ever come
[1:12:04] up from the earth in the form of
[1:12:05] creation was a man nothing higher ever
[1:12:08] come because why it was a perfect
[1:12:10] reflection of the highest in heaven
[1:12:12] which god is a man
[1:12:14] he says god is a man
[1:12:17] see god is a man so therefore it proves
[1:12:19] it and when god came down to dwell among
[1:12:21] us he was a man see a man so it shows
[1:12:23] that the perfection of evolution was god
[1:12:26] which is a man
[1:12:28] so
[1:12:29] if you look at adam's created state
[1:12:31] which we read in genesis then you see
[1:12:34] that he had a lot of attributes that we
[1:12:37] don't have right now so he was immortal
[1:12:39] he could live forever right uh he had
[1:12:43] complete dominion over the earth because
[1:12:44] he could tell the earth to move and he
[1:12:47] could tell the animals to do what he
[1:12:48] wants or the plants or anything like
[1:12:50] that he could order them around because
[1:12:52] he was in that connection with god not
[1:12:55] only that his connection with god was so
[1:12:57] strong it was face to face all he had to
[1:13:00] do was say something and god was right
[1:13:02] there in front of him he could see him
[1:13:05] see uh you look in the scripture and
[1:13:07] says no man has seen god at any time
[1:13:09] adam was able to actually
[1:13:11] see god and communicate with him there's
[1:13:14] a difference between where he was right
[1:13:16] there and what we are right now
[1:13:18] so
[1:13:20] this thought of evolution it was it was
[1:13:22] it was causing me to think
[1:13:24] and
[1:13:25] i i
[1:13:27] i won't tell you where i got this
[1:13:28] thought until maybe the end of the
[1:13:29] sermon but um
[1:13:31] it was causing me to think that
[1:13:34] if someone can evolve going forward and
[1:13:36] become a higher life form can that work
[1:13:39] backwards
[1:13:40] because where we are right now is not
[1:13:43] where adam is over there so something
[1:13:45] happened between there and here that
[1:13:47] brought us to where we are right now now
[1:13:49] granted we have all this revelation that
[1:13:51] we have right now and we're closer to
[1:13:53] god than other church ages but still
[1:13:56] there's a big leap between where adam
[1:13:59] was and where we are
[1:14:01] so
[1:14:03] i uh
[1:14:04] i looked up something called reverse
[1:14:06] evolution and
[1:14:08] i
[1:14:08] actually found out that
[1:14:11] scientists actually know that this is a
[1:14:13] thing
[1:14:14] so
[1:14:15] let me use an example of an animal that
[1:14:17] everybody is aware of it's penguin if
[1:14:20] you see a penguin
[1:14:22] it has flippers on it
[1:14:24] scientists will call that a bird
[1:14:27] so
[1:14:28] their idea of evolution because they
[1:14:30] have to make it fit you know whatever
[1:14:32] theory they came up with so their idea
[1:14:34] was that okay penguins didn't always
[1:14:37] have flippers like that so they said all
[1:14:39] right it evolved just like all the other
[1:14:42] organisms just like we did from like you
[1:14:44] know
[1:14:45] fish or whatever or frogs or whatever it
[1:14:47] is and then it became a bird and it was
[1:14:49] able to fly
[1:14:51] and then it evolved backwards and lost
[1:14:53] the ability to fly so that's what that's
[1:14:55] an example of
[1:14:57] reverse evolution hang with me now i
[1:15:00] don't want this to get too complicated
[1:15:02] so it just evolved backwards and then it
[1:15:04] became the way it was the way it is
[1:15:06] right now
[1:15:07] so
[1:15:09] i took that thought and i went to the
[1:15:10] bible and i realized god even though he
[1:15:13] created adam in his own image with all
[1:15:15] of that power and all of that perfection
[1:15:17] eve the same way
[1:15:20] he had to break us down
[1:15:22] over stages to get us to where we are
[1:15:24] right now
[1:15:26] and that was through his purpose and his
[1:15:27] will and i believe that
[1:15:29] so the first place i went to look was
[1:15:31] the scripture we already read okay adam
[1:15:33] was there we are not there second place
[1:15:36] i went to is genesis 3 22
[1:15:41] and the lord god said
[1:15:44] behold the man is become as one of us to
[1:15:46] know good and evil this is right after
[1:15:48] adam already took of the tree of
[1:15:50] knowledge good and evil
[1:15:52] so if you realize
[1:15:54] at that point he wasn't the perfect
[1:15:56] reflection of god because god had the
[1:15:59] knowledge of good and evil
[1:16:00] he just
[1:16:02] did good all the time
[1:16:03] now
[1:16:05] now that adam and eve actually took of
[1:16:07] that tree then they have that knowledge
[1:16:09] and he says the man is become as one of
[1:16:11] us to know good and evil and now lest he
[1:16:14] put forth his hand and take also with
[1:16:16] the tree of life and eat and live
[1:16:19] forever therefore the lord god sent him
[1:16:21] forth from the garden of eden to till
[1:16:23] the ground from whence he was taken so
[1:16:25] he drove out the man
[1:16:26] and he placed at the east of the garden
[1:16:28] of eden cherubins and a flaming sword
[1:16:30] which turned every way to keep the way
[1:16:32] of the tree of life so the first thing
[1:16:36] that happened whenever
[1:16:38] that caused adam to go down
[1:16:40] to devolve
[1:16:42] or
[1:16:42] his reverse evolution the first thing
[1:16:44] that happened was he sinned
[1:16:47] and he was told in that day that you sin
[1:16:50] that day you die so
[1:16:52] he's driven out away from the word of
[1:16:54] god that's the first thing god actively
[1:16:57] does to cause him to
[1:17:00] devolve
[1:17:01] the very first thing separation from the
[1:17:03] word
[1:17:04] genesis chapter six
[1:17:06] verse one
[1:17:07] i'm going to go through the second part
[1:17:10] and it came to pass
[1:17:12] when men began to multiply on the face
[1:17:15] of the earth
[1:17:16] and daughters were born unto them that
[1:17:18] the sons of god saw the daughters of men
[1:17:20] that they were fair and they took them
[1:17:21] wives of all which they chose
[1:17:25] and the lord said my spirit shall not
[1:17:26] always strive with man for he for that
[1:17:28] he also is flesh yet his day shall be
[1:17:31] 120 years so the second thing right
[1:17:34] there god's spirit not striving with man
[1:17:37] god took his spirit from man so first
[1:17:38] the word then the spirit now after that
[1:17:41] you go down to verse five actually and
[1:17:43] god saw that the wickedness of man was
[1:17:44] great in the earth and every imagination
[1:17:46] of the thoughts of his heart was only
[1:17:47] evil continually and he repented the
[1:17:49] lord that he had made man on the earth
[1:17:51] and grieved him at his heart so
[1:17:53] he was separated from god's spirit
[1:17:56] and after that his lifespan becomes only
[1:18:00] 120 years god takes his lifespan down
[1:18:02] that now you know if you pass 120 years
[1:18:05] that's just a blessing from god right
[1:18:06] there you actually see people who
[1:18:08] actually pass that
[1:18:10] um
[1:18:12] so the second stage was his lifespan got
[1:18:14] lowered third stage
[1:18:16] genesis chapter 11 verse one to eight
[1:18:21] now we're going to go to
[1:18:23] we skipped about five chapters in
[1:18:24] genesis actually and we see that
[1:18:28] the whole flood happens and noah and all
[1:18:31] of his sons they already pass in
[1:18:32] previous generations and god had seen
[1:18:35] how wicked the world had become and he
[1:18:37] already wiped all the men off the face
[1:18:38] of the earth
[1:18:40] now this is what happens uh this is
[1:18:43] around the time of the tower of babel
[1:18:45] so 11 verse 1 and the whole earth was
[1:18:47] was of one language and of one speech
[1:18:50] and it came to pass as they journeyed
[1:18:51] from the east that they found a plane on
[1:18:53] the land of shinar and they dwelt there
[1:18:56] and the lord came down to see the city
[1:18:58] and the tower which the children of men
[1:18:59] builded and the lord said behold the
[1:19:01] people as one and they have all one
[1:19:03] language in this they begin to do
[1:19:06] and now nothing will be restrained from
[1:19:07] them which they have imagined to do
[1:19:10] go to let us go down and there confound
[1:19:12] their language that they may not
[1:19:14] understand one another's speech so the
[1:19:16] lord scattered them abroad from
[1:19:18] uh from thence upon the face of the
[1:19:19] earth and they left off to build the
[1:19:21] city
[1:19:22] so the third thing was
[1:19:24] he confounded their language and that
[1:19:27] was like the final death stroke because
[1:19:29] this is immediately this is not long
[1:19:31] after the flood it's within a few
[1:19:33] hundred years after the flood and
[1:19:36] mankind even though he has a short
[1:19:38] lifespan he's already building this
[1:19:40] tower of babel which is completely
[1:19:41] against god's word and they're trying to
[1:19:43] reach where god is so he knows that
[1:19:46] since they have one language and they're
[1:19:47] all in agreement they still have the
[1:19:49] capability of getting to this point
[1:19:51] where they're reaching god in a way
[1:19:53] that's not correct
[1:19:55] going away away from his word but still
[1:19:58] trying to find their own path to get to
[1:19:59] heaven and he said yeah they will reach
[1:20:02] there but let's stop them so what
[1:20:04] happens whenever you change everybody's
[1:20:06] language what happens they all scattered
[1:20:08] all over the earth and cultures start
[1:20:10] arising in different places and nobody
[1:20:12] likes each other everybody has a
[1:20:13] different religion and everybody's okay
[1:20:16] with that and they start fighting each
[1:20:18] other now if everybody in the world
[1:20:21] actually spoke the same language right
[1:20:22] now
[1:20:24] and everybody recognized the bible right
[1:20:26] here was the truth
[1:20:28] from the get-go we'd be a lot farther in
[1:20:30] life
[1:20:31] so many people wouldn't have died
[1:20:33] unnecessarily so many people would have
[1:20:35] been
[1:20:36] much closer to god or have an
[1:20:38] understanding of god because you got to
[1:20:40] realize this is a generation or two
[1:20:41] after noah everybody probably knew who
[1:20:44] exactly noah was they probably saw him
[1:20:47] shem and japheth right there in front of
[1:20:49] them that was probably their granddaddy
[1:20:51] or something they knew who that was and
[1:20:53] they knew what his word was
[1:20:55] so they had that concept but they didn't
[1:20:58] like the fact that they had that
[1:20:59] connection with uh that that they had to
[1:21:02] go god's way in order to have a
[1:21:03] connection
[1:21:04] if you look at um
[1:21:06] the church age book brother branham says
[1:21:09] that uh he took it from his slops to
[1:21:11] babylons that they they were the reason
[1:21:14] they built the tower
[1:21:15] was because they didn't like the
[1:21:17] connection with god above them so they
[1:21:20] built this structure where everybody
[1:21:22] could live inside but not feel the force
[1:21:24] of god's presence above them so they had
[1:21:26] a ceiling over their heads and it was a
[1:21:28] roof and it protected them from that
[1:21:30] condemnation of not living the correct
[1:21:32] way if you actually look in the hislop's
[1:21:34] two babylons that's what it says and i
[1:21:36] thought that was an amazing amazing
[1:21:38] point how people actively separate
[1:21:40] themselves from god that's exactly what
[1:21:43] this science is that i'm telling you
[1:21:44] about they have to find an answer to
[1:21:47] everything and they have to try to find
[1:21:49] a way that the bible doesn't add up with
[1:21:52] their answer because if they find an
[1:21:54] answer that works then they can
[1:21:56] say that god doesn't exist they can
[1:21:58] ignore that fact
[1:22:01] they can't ignore that fact whenever
[1:22:02] they actually hit their death beds and
[1:22:04] you know the spirit's leaving their body
[1:22:06] because science will tell you a spirit
[1:22:07] doesn't exist there's no such thing as a
[1:22:09] spirit they say that all you are is a is
[1:22:11] a is a
[1:22:13] collection of memories that's all your
[1:22:15] brain is and that's all that makes you
[1:22:17] so
[1:22:19] i find it amazing the links that people
[1:22:21] go to in order to ignore god it takes so
[1:22:25] much more work than actually just
[1:22:27] following his word
[1:22:28] so all of these cultures spring up
[1:22:31] and uh
[1:22:35] the world becomes an apostate place it's
[1:22:37] very um anti-god
[1:22:39] and um
[1:22:41] actually if you look in the power of god
[1:22:42] in 1955 i had i saw this quote and i was
[1:22:45] like this is perfect goes right here it
[1:22:47] says a woman is a wonderful thing a man
[1:22:50] too but when they've got away from god
[1:22:52] they're lowered down in beasts that's
[1:22:54] right they'll do things that a beast
[1:22:56] wouldn't do
[1:22:58] so at this point
[1:23:00] god
[1:23:01] he has
[1:23:03] all of these
[1:23:05] creatures all of us as mankind as his
[1:23:08] creation but he has an unfulfilled
[1:23:10] purpose in us in that he wants us to get
[1:23:13] to that place where we are where he is
[1:23:16] even though we have this knowledge of
[1:23:18] good and evil even though we've eaten
[1:23:21] from the tree of knowledge of good and
[1:23:22] evil he still wants us to get there now
[1:23:25] this is different from adam and you in a
[1:23:27] way are greater than adam was in the
[1:23:29] garden of eden because
[1:23:32] even though you have that knowledge of
[1:23:33] good and evil you still chose god's way
[1:23:36] even though you knew that there is
[1:23:39] something seductive in life and you had
[1:23:41] something even though you were born in
[1:23:43] sin and shaped in iniquity even though
[1:23:45] you had no control over that in your own
[1:23:47] history you still chose god's way
[1:23:50] i look around here this morning i see so
[1:23:52] many people who've chosen god's way i
[1:23:53] see them dressed correctly i see them
[1:23:55] giving their time to the lord their
[1:23:57] talents i see
[1:23:59] how how hard it is to live in this age
[1:24:01] and yet we still decide to choose god's
[1:24:03] way because there is no greater way
[1:24:06] somehow we recognize that somehow
[1:24:08] against all the odds and against all of
[1:24:11] all of the things that the devil shoves
[1:24:13] in our faces day after day we still
[1:24:16] recognize that god has a better way
[1:24:20] you know i i think of it this way how
[1:24:21] many people have electronic devices like
[1:24:24] a phone or something like that
[1:24:26] how many ads do you see in a day
[1:24:28] just looking down at that thing that's
[1:24:30] right
[1:24:31] and 90 of the ads is something the devil
[1:24:33] wants you to look at
[1:24:35] like i said there are different spirits
[1:24:36] here the devil has a spirit behind every
[1:24:38] ad even if it's something as innocuous
[1:24:40] as hey here's a notebook it's empty you
[1:24:44] probably want a notebook maybe your
[1:24:45] phone heard you saying you wanted a
[1:24:46] notebook this thing's taken on a life of
[1:24:49] its own right
[1:24:50] it heard you say you want a notebook
[1:24:52] there's nothing wrong with a notebook
[1:24:53] right
[1:24:54] but there's a spirit behind that if you
[1:24:56] go too far and you jump on every ad it's
[1:24:58] called a spirit of consumerism and the
[1:25:00] devil loves to take that
[1:25:03] and he he loves to keep shoving stuff
[1:25:05] like that in your face
[1:25:06] not only that you look up from your
[1:25:08] phone you just look at the way people
[1:25:09] are dressed you look at all the
[1:25:11] entertainment that's around you look at
[1:25:13] all the options there are for destroying
[1:25:15] your own life
[1:25:17] so many options
[1:25:18] so many ads and it's a spirit of this
[1:25:21] age
[1:25:22] not only that entertainment
[1:25:24] that's one i have a struggle with i'm
[1:25:27] going to be honest with that i have a
[1:25:28] problem with entertainment because i i
[1:25:31] don't have an addiction of of probably
[1:25:34] some drug or alcohol or anything like
[1:25:36] that but if i decide to focus on
[1:25:38] something i'm going gonna focus really
[1:25:39] hard and i'm gonna stay right there
[1:25:41] so if it's something like entertainment
[1:25:43] i feel like reading a book i'm gonna
[1:25:44] read like five of them in the space of
[1:25:46] two weeks because i don't want to do
[1:25:48] anything else and the devil just traps
[1:25:50] me right there it might not be a bad
[1:25:52] thing
[1:25:53] but too much of it makes it a bad thing
[1:25:55] that's where the addiction sets in a lot
[1:25:58] of people have different addictions like
[1:25:59] this could be movies it could be music
[1:26:02] it could be all sorts of things and the
[1:26:04] devil will just shove it in your face
[1:26:06] like that
[1:26:07] devil's got an ad campaign people it's a
[1:26:09] strong ad campaign
[1:26:11] you know what he's got he's got uh
[1:26:15] he's got a
[1:26:17] buy one get seven free deal
[1:26:19] you know what i mean
[1:26:22] when the unclean spirit steps out comes
[1:26:25] back with seven more guess what he finds
[1:26:27] this he finds a clean house
[1:26:30] and that scripture says that it's a
[1:26:31] garnished house y'all ever seen garnish
[1:26:34] food it looks so good it's like whoa
[1:26:38] i was at a place yesterday where i was
[1:26:40] eating and they put a flower on the
[1:26:41] plate and i'm like i want to eat that
[1:26:43] even more
[1:26:44] i don't even want to eat the flower i
[1:26:45] just want to eat the food the devil when
[1:26:48] he comes back with that spirit he's like
[1:26:50] everybody come on in
[1:26:52] you can welcome him in or you can fight
[1:26:54] back
[1:26:56] now
[1:26:58] we're still on this topic of evolution
[1:27:01] and um
[1:27:03] so there's another process in evolution
[1:27:06] that's called natural selection
[1:27:08] and uh
[1:27:09] it says that okay
[1:27:11] there's a group of organisms in this
[1:27:12] species and they're in front of us
[1:27:15] and um
[1:27:17] some of them are going to make it to the
[1:27:18] next generation and some of them are not
[1:27:20] because some of them are going to be
[1:27:22] ready and evolved
[1:27:24] so for example
[1:27:25] uh
[1:27:27] humans i think no let's use giraffes as
[1:27:30] an example so giraffes
[1:27:32] according to science
[1:27:34] in the past they didn't have long necks
[1:27:37] but the longer neck giraffes because all
[1:27:39] the animals they were competing with
[1:27:41] they're like imagine competing with
[1:27:42] zebras and antelopes on the savannah all
[1:27:45] the animals they're competing with are
[1:27:46] eating leaves off the trees
[1:27:48] and then giraffes
[1:27:50] over time
[1:27:51] the longer next giraffes lived longer
[1:27:53] because they were able to get the
[1:27:55] tallest leaves off the top of the tree
[1:27:57] so eventually all giraffes ended up with
[1:28:00] long necks that's their theory so
[1:28:02] naturally select natural selection said
[1:28:05] okay all giraffes with long necks make
[1:28:07] it to the next generations all the other
[1:28:09] ones die
[1:28:12] hang with me here
[1:28:13] so
[1:28:16] god still has this desire fellow to
[1:28:18] fellowship with man
[1:28:19] and
[1:28:21] he needs to look for somebody
[1:28:24] in this generation
[1:28:26] after the flood
[1:28:27] after the tower of babel with some sort
[1:28:30] of characteristic
[1:28:32] that he can latch onto and take on to
[1:28:34] the next generation someone he can use
[1:28:38] to fulfill his will
[1:28:39] so this
[1:28:40] gene it's really simple it's called
[1:28:43] faith
[1:28:44] so he sees abraham he's like that guy
[1:28:47] that guy has the gene i need and i'm
[1:28:50] gonna take him
[1:28:51] and all of his descendants spiritually
[1:28:54] speaking because this is a spiritual
[1:28:55] side of things all of his descendants
[1:28:57] are going to come into the next
[1:28:59] generation
[1:29:01] we are living proof of that right here
[1:29:03] we all have the faith
[1:29:06] so did it work yes it did there's proof
[1:29:08] right there so he calls abraham i call
[1:29:12] that natural selection
[1:29:14] now uh there's a definition i got on
[1:29:16] national geographic says natural
[1:29:19] natural selection is the process through
[1:29:21] which populations of living organisms
[1:29:23] adapt and change
[1:29:24] some individuals have traits better used
[1:29:27] to the enviro better suited to the
[1:29:29] environment than others
[1:29:32] individuals with adaptive traits traits
[1:29:34] that give them some advantage are more
[1:29:36] likely to survive and reproduce
[1:29:38] these individuals then pass the adaptive
[1:29:41] traits to their offspring
[1:29:43] so
[1:29:44] how many people in this room believe the
[1:29:46] message
[1:29:48] all right keep your hands up please
[1:29:49] please all right how many heard it from
[1:29:51] their parents
[1:29:54] right there's a decent number of us
[1:29:56] right here how many heard about christ
[1:29:58] and him coming to save us from your
[1:30:00] parents some hand should go right back
[1:30:02] up
[1:30:03] why because you had faith in that word
[1:30:05] your parents were praying for you
[1:30:07] they were teaching you they were helping
[1:30:10] you to grow and to survive and that
[1:30:13] faith actually came from somebody who
[1:30:16] was ahead of you in your christian walk
[1:30:17] some of you may have heard it from your
[1:30:19] pastors that could be a spiritual parent
[1:30:21] to you some of you may have heard it
[1:30:23] from some random preacher some of some
[1:30:25] of you directly from the message but
[1:30:26] that same faith was transmitted to you
[1:30:29] from our forefathers that's a gene and
[1:30:32] it just keeps moving on i'm not saying
[1:30:34] people who've never heard of the word of
[1:30:36] god in in their entire life or their
[1:30:38] family tree won't hear it because
[1:30:39] somebody's gonna bring it to them
[1:30:42] it could be us it could be each it could
[1:30:44] be any of these little kids right here
[1:30:46] could be anybody but that's still
[1:30:47] somebody who passes it down to you
[1:30:50] because that is your genetic inheritance
[1:30:53] you're going to inherit that so like
[1:30:55] right now think of it
[1:31:00] think of it this way i don't want to get
[1:31:01] ahead of myself let me just let me just
[1:31:03] hang on
[1:31:05] so um
[1:31:06] abraham he's in a place
[1:31:08] he's in an environment and this is
[1:31:10] another factor according to evolution
[1:31:12] it's environment
[1:31:14] so if you think
[1:31:16] about animals
[1:31:18] and plants too
[1:31:20] often they'll develop some sort of
[1:31:23] um
[1:31:24] characteristic based on the environment
[1:31:25] that they're in so all animals tend to
[1:31:28] have limbs not all i mean you have
[1:31:29] snakes and whatnot but most animals tend
[1:31:32] to have limbs so depending on the
[1:31:33] environment they're gonna have something
[1:31:35] that develops
[1:31:37] based on the environment they're in so
[1:31:39] if you look at a fish you look at a
[1:31:40] shark their limbs develop into fins
[1:31:43] that's still a limb they move it you
[1:31:45] look at us we have arms and legs just
[1:31:46] like land creatures you look at birds
[1:31:48] they develop wings because they're
[1:31:49] supposed to go out so they have that
[1:31:51] characteristic that develops
[1:31:53] that characteristic is actually called
[1:31:56] it starts by a mutation
[1:31:57] in the earlier things so
[1:32:00] in the earlier generations it's a
[1:32:01] mutation for instance
[1:32:04] uh
[1:32:04] not everybody
[1:32:06] not all humans are going to have the
[1:32:08] same exact mutation some of us are going
[1:32:10] to be tall some of us are going to be
[1:32:11] short and those are genes that came
[1:32:12] directly through our family tree for
[1:32:14] instance here's something weird about me
[1:32:16] i was born with six fingers on each hand
[1:32:19] my parents did not have that but my
[1:32:21] grandparents did so that gene passed
[1:32:23] down in like one in every 500 people has
[1:32:26] about the same thing so i was born with
[1:32:28] 12 fingers but not everybody's supposed
[1:32:30] to be born with 12 fingers it's just
[1:32:32] something that's there it's a mutation
[1:32:34] so i hope becca you knew about that
[1:32:36] before you
[1:32:37] just gonna let you know
[1:32:40] but it's a mutation and it can follow
[1:32:43] your family tree
[1:32:45] so
[1:32:46] uh
[1:32:47] if you think about that
[1:32:50] that environment
[1:32:53] [Laughter]
[1:32:57] that uh
[1:32:59] and that also applies to the spiritual
[1:33:01] i'm just gonna say
[1:33:03] i didn't even think about that right now
[1:33:06] i mean whoever you're gonna marry you
[1:33:08] gotta look at their family too
[1:33:10] not just the ones who are under the
[1:33:12] blood the ones who probably are running
[1:33:13] from god look what they're fighting
[1:33:16] before you bring them into your thing
[1:33:19] you're not just marrying your partner
[1:33:21] now you're just
[1:33:22] i mean i'm not even married and i know
[1:33:24] that
[1:33:25] you're not just marrying your part you
[1:33:26] need to be careful who you look at
[1:33:31] not only that but be careful who you
[1:33:32] associate with because we're talking
[1:33:34] about environment right now right
[1:33:37] so
[1:33:38] abraham is actually called out of out of
[1:33:41] an idolatrous environment right
[1:33:44] that is exactly the environment he was
[1:33:45] in not only that but he moved with his
[1:33:48] family and they carried the environment
[1:33:50] with them
[1:33:51] they had to die out before isaac was
[1:33:53] actually born his dad had to die he had
[1:33:55] to separate from his brother he had to
[1:33:57] separate from lot
[1:33:59] be careful who you hang out with it's
[1:34:01] important
[1:34:04] so that environment it's going to
[1:34:07] cause you
[1:34:08] to
[1:34:09] develop something that will help you
[1:34:11] fight
[1:34:12] the environment or help you survive
[1:34:14] there i believe we're in the one of the
[1:34:16] one of the
[1:34:17] most difficult environments to live in
[1:34:19] for a christian that's ever been exist
[1:34:21] in existence right
[1:34:23] i mean it's the worst right now the
[1:34:25] world is at its worst but god gave us
[1:34:28] something to work through this he gave
[1:34:30] us his word not only that he gave us
[1:34:32] more than everybody in the history of
[1:34:35] the bible was ever given in order to
[1:34:37] survive
[1:34:38] pass that on to your kids teach them
[1:34:40] how to let that gene work for them make
[1:34:43] sure to teach them the right thing and
[1:34:45] teach them about the environment that
[1:34:47] they're living in so life 1962 brother
[1:34:50] brandon was actually talking about
[1:34:51] environment
[1:34:52] and uh
[1:34:54] he says um
[1:34:55] a brother was testifying to me this
[1:34:57] morning he was called to the ministry
[1:34:59] when a little boy when a little boy and
[1:35:02] then he fell he said
[1:35:03] and he said but then he come back with
[1:35:05] more of a call to preach than ever
[1:35:07] before
[1:35:08] so if you look at him and you look at
[1:35:10] abraham
[1:35:12] this this guy had got away from god
[1:35:14] abraham was never with god in the first
[1:35:16] place he was living an idolatrous life
[1:35:19] and
[1:35:20] in order for god to use them they had to
[1:35:22] step out of whatever environment that
[1:35:25] was in they had to move for god to
[1:35:28] actually build them to exactly where
[1:35:29] they were so god the first thing he's
[1:35:31] doing and involving us
[1:35:33] descendants of
[1:35:35] abraham he shows first you need to
[1:35:37] separate
[1:35:38] you hear the word you need to separate
[1:35:40] you need to follow the word and wherever
[1:35:42] it leads you it's going to take you out
[1:35:44] of whatever bar room you're in it's
[1:35:45] going to take you from a group of
[1:35:47] friends sometimes it's going to take you
[1:35:48] out of your family sometimes sometimes
[1:35:51] it'll move you geographically but follow
[1:35:53] the word and god's going to take you
[1:35:55] exactly where you need to be to survive
[1:35:57] he's going to control the environment
[1:35:59] so the quote continues
[1:36:01] he says you see what it was when he
[1:36:03] become a christian he got in the wrong
[1:36:05] environment see and that environment
[1:36:07] influenced him see and you just keep
[1:36:09] holding around without a kind of
[1:36:11] environment it influences you i hope
[1:36:13] you're reading between the lines what
[1:36:14] i'm saying it influences you in that
[1:36:17] environment the first thing you know you
[1:36:19] become a part of that environment you go
[1:36:21] into it
[1:36:23] see
[1:36:24] you end up going in there it's not going
[1:36:26] to come on to your side you can say wow
[1:36:28] i'm just going to be an influence and
[1:36:30] i'm going to get everybody in this bar
[1:36:32] room
[1:36:33] to church they're not going to follow
[1:36:34] you
[1:36:35] they're not going to follow you
[1:36:37] don't take yourself there don't put
[1:36:38] yourself in a situation you don't need
[1:36:40] to be but there are situations that we
[1:36:43] have to be in we have to go to work we
[1:36:45] gotta go to school there's things you
[1:36:46] gotta do and there are people there
[1:36:49] that are gonna have their own atmosphere
[1:36:51] their own spirit they're going to be
[1:36:52] setting that environment
[1:36:54] you can fight back while you're there
[1:36:58] but all the more reason you should come
[1:37:00] to church on sunday that's right
[1:37:02] because god gives you a bit of rest and
[1:37:04] pulls you out of there charges you up
[1:37:07] and sends you right back in there that's
[1:37:08] just the way he made this age to be is
[1:37:11] that we are supposed to
[1:37:13] be a light for him
[1:37:14] but we still have to
[1:37:16] charge up once in a while and there's no
[1:37:18] other way you're going to stay strong
[1:37:19] unless you charge up even if it's a day
[1:37:22] by day thing read your bible pray charge
[1:37:24] up wherever you are set that atmosphere
[1:37:26] in your home
[1:37:27] let everybody in the house actually come
[1:37:29] under subjection to that and have the
[1:37:31] same mindset
[1:37:33] it's really important
[1:37:35] so god pulled abraham out of the
[1:37:37] environment for him to achieve his
[1:37:38] potential um
[1:37:40] and that's what we need to do you need
[1:37:42] to achieve your potential you know the
[1:37:44] word of god comes to edify us and
[1:37:46] perfect us and you're not going to
[1:37:48] evolve and go to the next stage if
[1:37:50] you're left behind
[1:37:52] any time god takes it
[1:37:53] turns a corner in his word you need to
[1:37:56] follow
[1:37:58] now
[1:37:58] you can actually see the people didn't
[1:38:00] follow this all in the in the past so
[1:38:03] um
[1:38:05] abraham's family they didn't make it
[1:38:07] because they didn't follow god's word
[1:38:09] god wasn't speaking to them they didn't
[1:38:10] get natural selection sometimes you
[1:38:12] can't do that i mean god predestinates
[1:38:15] us i hope you're seeing the spiritual
[1:38:17] side he predestinated you so you're
[1:38:19] already naturally selected
[1:38:21] now the israelites
[1:38:23] they get the word of god through moses
[1:38:25] they get the law and god is still
[1:38:27] evolving us back in stages trying to get
[1:38:29] us to exactly where he wants us to be in
[1:38:31] the future
[1:38:32] so
[1:38:33] they get the law of god
[1:38:35] and
[1:38:36] it's it's the word to them that's the
[1:38:38] first time the word is ever written
[1:38:40] in in on with a human pen that is the
[1:38:43] first time ever and they get that and
[1:38:45] that's a major step for them if you look
[1:38:47] on the
[1:38:48] on the scientific side of things and you
[1:38:50] see how people evolved the written word
[1:38:52] was a major part of that the development
[1:38:54] of language and things like that were a
[1:38:56] major part of that according to science
[1:38:58] because that showed that something could
[1:39:01] be passed on to generations whether the
[1:39:03] organisms were living or not and that's
[1:39:05] a history right there so
[1:39:08] um
[1:39:09] the israelites get the law of god and
[1:39:11] not only that god sends his son
[1:39:15] and he speaks to the 12 disciples and
[1:39:17] all the christians in the earliest stage
[1:39:19] right there and gives them grace so they
[1:39:21] have the word plus grace you can see
[1:39:23] this restoration happening adam was
[1:39:25] separated from the word that was the
[1:39:27] first thing god did first thing god does
[1:39:29] at the beginning when he's re-evolving
[1:39:31] everybody give him the word back right
[1:39:33] there give it back to them
[1:39:35] and not only that second thing is grace
[1:39:38] and that's eternal life
[1:39:40] that comes that's the second stage he's
[1:39:42] bringing us right back to him where are
[1:39:44] we headed right now okay so
[1:39:47] the seven church ages come
[1:39:49] and you see justification starting you
[1:39:51] say sanctification baptist baptism the
[1:39:54] holy spirit one at a time we're coming
[1:39:56] back to where god is
[1:39:58] so
[1:39:59] what happens is
[1:40:02] in every church age
[1:40:05] you see a group of people and they
[1:40:06] undergo a mutation like my fingers right
[1:40:09] but the spiritual side because they're
[1:40:11] the only ones around them who recognize
[1:40:13] how god's moving to the next age they
[1:40:15] have to see it and in order for you to
[1:40:17] see that you need to have that
[1:40:18] relationship with god to see exactly
[1:40:21] where he's moving to if you don't have
[1:40:23] that relationship and then you come to
[1:40:25] him he's not gonna i mean you come to
[1:40:28] him like once in a while not as often as
[1:40:30] he should be you need to be you need to
[1:40:31] be on a friend to friend basis with him
[1:40:35] in order to see where he's moving
[1:40:36] otherwise you're going to miss a turn
[1:40:38] and guess what you're going to die out
[1:40:41] so on the devil side of things what does
[1:40:43] he do to stop us from evolving to where
[1:40:45] god wants us to be
[1:40:48] he causes people to hybridize and
[1:40:51] brother branham talks about this all the
[1:40:53] time so a hybrid animal is where you
[1:40:55] take two species that do not belong
[1:40:57] together and then you mash them together
[1:40:59] and you come up with something that
[1:41:00] doesn't isn't supposed to exist
[1:41:02] so
[1:41:04] the most common example of that is
[1:41:05] actually the mule because you got a
[1:41:07] horse and a donkey and then you end up
[1:41:09] with a mule so people like good things
[1:41:11] that are here they the thing is they
[1:41:13] like
[1:41:14] they like the endurance of a horse but
[1:41:17] they like the patience of a donkey so
[1:41:19] they put those together and like hey i
[1:41:21] got both of them together and look this
[1:41:23] is the product
[1:41:25] now people do the same thing with god's
[1:41:27] word they take the things they like out
[1:41:29] of the word they take the things they
[1:41:31] like out of the world and then they
[1:41:33] smash them together it's like okay what
[1:41:35] do we have denomination right there
[1:41:38] religion right there we do that on our
[1:41:40] personal lives as well so what happens
[1:41:43] whenever you hybridize
[1:41:45] two animals
[1:41:46] you get a mule
[1:41:48] you hybridize two more you get a second
[1:41:50] mule
[1:41:51] one is a male one is a female
[1:41:55] put them together they're not going to
[1:41:56] come up with anything that's not how
[1:41:58] hybridization works that species will
[1:42:00] not survive to the next generation not
[1:42:03] until you keep mashing them together
[1:42:04] over and over again until you keep
[1:42:06] coming out with more and more mules but
[1:42:08] they're not going to reproduce that's
[1:42:10] not a new species
[1:42:12] so
[1:42:14] i actually looked up a bunch of other
[1:42:15] species that uh are hybridized they get
[1:42:17] a buffalo and a cow it's called a
[1:42:18] beefalo
[1:42:20] i don't know why
[1:42:22] they got a zebra and a horse it's called
[1:42:23] a zebroid i looked at pictures of these
[1:42:25] i didn't want to show them to you
[1:42:26] because they're kind of disturbing they
[1:42:28] they don't work
[1:42:30] they don't work and mixing god's word
[1:42:32] with anything does not work that's not
[1:42:34] how it works
[1:42:37] is not how it works
[1:42:40] so we actually do that ourselves because
[1:42:45] humans even though we're getting better
[1:42:46] and better you know as christians every
[1:42:49] generation gets more of his word and you
[1:42:50] get to climb up higher and higher even
[1:42:53] though you have this
[1:42:54] we have this i'm including myself here
[1:42:57] thing is
[1:42:58] people's concept of god keeps changing
[1:43:01] even though he's the same exact god
[1:43:04] we do that and
[1:43:05] for instance you know the jews they had
[1:43:07] a picture of jehovah they could not
[1:43:09] reconcile that with christ
[1:43:11] so their idea was of jehovah it's like
[1:43:13] my god it's like this you know he's not
[1:43:15] supposed to be like christ
[1:43:17] early christians they see christ in
[1:43:19] jehovah same person and they have to
[1:43:22] they actually have to come to terms with
[1:43:24] that and then move to the next age
[1:43:27] so
[1:43:29] we make that mistake individually
[1:43:31] because
[1:43:32] we have an idea my god loves me
[1:43:35] you know and we just look at god from
[1:43:37] that angle he loves me so much he will
[1:43:39] forgive me for everything you know and
[1:43:43] my god is giving jehovah gyra great
[1:43:46] wonderful these are all wonderful
[1:43:47] characteristics but god is just
[1:43:50] he's also timely he won't give you
[1:43:52] everything you want
[1:43:54] you know he's a very timely god so
[1:43:58] we have a we we actually we go to god in
[1:44:01] our prayers we don't really have a
[1:44:03] relationship with him but what we know
[1:44:05] from church is he loves me and he'll
[1:44:06] give me anything so we just go hey god
[1:44:09] please give me this please give me this
[1:44:11] please give me this please give me this
[1:44:13] and
[1:44:13] that's not a relationship
[1:44:16] what we want and the thing is we get
[1:44:17] ourselves in these messes here sometimes
[1:44:20] you know it's like
[1:44:21] i i got myself in this situation you
[1:44:23] know brother branham talks about the
[1:44:25] devil giving you a box of rattlesnakes
[1:44:27] you go out there if you don't sign for
[1:44:29] it and you decline it then he can't give
[1:44:32] it to you that's what he says but if you
[1:44:34] go out there sign it and hand it over
[1:44:36] ooh i got a package i didn't order this
[1:44:38] but what is it
[1:44:39] and then you're like oh
[1:44:41] i want an amazon prime god two days over
[1:44:44] i just wanted knocked out i wanted to
[1:44:46] come over here and as soon as i got i
[1:44:48] mean it took me an hour to get myself in
[1:44:50] this mess but i want him to come get it
[1:44:51] get me out of it immediately that's not
[1:44:53] how that works all the time a lot of the
[1:44:56] problems we have in life are things that
[1:44:58] we signed for and brought onto ourselves
[1:45:00] like i said the way we were spending our
[1:45:02] time with entertainment and stuff i
[1:45:05] bring myself into this problem where i
[1:45:07] lose my connection with god then a trial
[1:45:09] comes and guess what here i am just like
[1:45:11] oh
[1:45:12] god i know i haven't been around in a
[1:45:14] while but here we are
[1:45:16] that's not how it works you need a
[1:45:18] relationship
[1:45:22] that's not how that's not how that works
[1:45:25] a smyrna in church age
[1:45:28] brother brandon talks about
[1:45:29] hybridization
[1:45:33] he says the smyrnian age had drifted far
[1:45:35] from the original it had become a hybrid
[1:45:37] and this this works for all church ages
[1:45:40] not just the smyrnia church age
[1:45:42] and it works for all individuals too
[1:45:44] it had hybridized the way
[1:45:46] itself the way eve did you know what a
[1:45:48] hybrid is
[1:45:49] what comes of two species mixing the
[1:45:52] result is no longer pure like the
[1:45:54] original it is mongrel when eve allowed
[1:45:57] the beast to mingle his seed with hers
[1:45:58] he produced a creature called cain that
[1:46:01] wasn't pure humming human he was of the
[1:46:04] wicked one
[1:46:05] so if you mix god's word with anything
[1:46:10] it's not his word anymore
[1:46:13] the church too has departed from what
[1:46:14] she originally was he was a hybrid that
[1:46:16] is the church nominal is a hybrid people
[1:46:18] say i'm a baptist it wasn't so in the
[1:46:20] beginning i'm a methodist it wasn't so
[1:46:21] in the beginning instead of the straight
[1:46:23] word of god instead of the spirit-filled
[1:46:25] men in the church who were led by
[1:46:26] spirit-given revelation there are now
[1:46:29] creeds and bylaws and the educated
[1:46:31] guesses of educated men
[1:46:33] see
[1:46:33] [Music]
[1:46:35] our concept of god
[1:46:37] is it can be so hybrid because we don't
[1:46:40] really look at what god is and don't
[1:46:42] treat him as a friend
[1:46:44] you need to constantly read his word
[1:46:46] constantly get more revelation
[1:46:48] pray for that relationship pray for his
[1:46:51] characteristics in any time that he's
[1:46:53] going to make a change in your life
[1:46:55] you can either be evolved at that point
[1:46:58] or you can be not evolved at that point
[1:47:01] and then he's got to wait
[1:47:03] and you won't have those characteristics
[1:47:04] see that evolution i'm talking about is
[1:47:07] getting us to be exactly like god it's
[1:47:09] taking a while to get there
[1:47:11] and i believe the bride has something to
[1:47:13] do with that we need to be able to
[1:47:15] get on his level
[1:47:17] not only those people who haven't come
[1:47:19] in yet but ourselves we need to look
[1:47:21] after after ourselves and make sure we
[1:47:22] get to that point
[1:47:27] and uh i think i have another quote here
[1:47:32] yeah so there's only one thing that can
[1:47:34] actually evolve the human race and get
[1:47:36] us back to where adam was
[1:47:38] and chemistry doesn't work like this in
[1:47:41] in
[1:47:42] in
[1:47:43] actual science world in the in the
[1:47:44] science world um
[1:47:46] chemistry says you know you can't
[1:47:47] unscramble scrambled eggs it's like hey
[1:47:49] you already these guys already evolved
[1:47:51] this far you can't suddenly become a new
[1:47:53] species all of a sudden but god's word
[1:47:56] says that it can't
[1:47:57] there's only one way you can actually
[1:47:59] get back to where you're supposed to be
[1:48:01] if you look at 1960 condemnation by
[1:48:04] representation
[1:48:08] brother branham says god said so
[1:48:11] jesus died that he might breed back oh
[1:48:14] hallelujah only the blood can do that
[1:48:17] only through the chemistry of the blood
[1:48:18] of jesus christ and breed back again a
[1:48:21] person that won't vary one word from
[1:48:23] what god said a little further down he
[1:48:25] says christ came up came that he might
[1:48:27] breed back by the holy spirit oh brother
[1:48:30] as we sat together now in heavenly
[1:48:31] places in christ jesus the holy spirit
[1:48:33] breathing upon us like we are now
[1:48:35] breathing just like god breathes into
[1:48:37] the nostrils of adam breathing back
[1:48:41] taking away the rubbish the rubbish of
[1:48:43] theology taking away the rubbish of the
[1:48:45] world man-made doctrines having forms of
[1:48:47] godliness denying the power thereof
[1:48:49] breeding breed it back to an
[1:48:51] unadulterated faith in jesus christ
[1:48:54] oh in god
[1:48:57] so
[1:48:58] he also says uh in i think it's the same
[1:49:01] tape actually you know nope it wasn't so
[1:49:04] from the beginning 1960 and all these
[1:49:06] years of denominations finally god has
[1:49:09] bred his church back to the holy ghost
[1:49:11] again
[1:49:12] i'm so glad to be in it let the old
[1:49:14] seeds and carnality die out become a new
[1:49:17] creature in christ jesus we're setting
[1:49:19] today together today in heavenly places
[1:49:22] in christ jesus the holy spirit breeding
[1:49:24] out oh i'm so glad
[1:49:26] of that breeding out doubts isms
[1:49:29] breeding in himself the sons of god not
[1:49:31] breeding back mules crossing it up or
[1:49:33] breeding sons and daughters of god that
[1:49:35] don't look at the word and stick out
[1:49:37] their ears and say well my mother was
[1:49:39] present presbyterian
[1:49:41] that's all right but we need first to
[1:49:42] make a sons and daughters of god
[1:49:44] breeding out the unbelief and the creeds
[1:49:47] and the things and bringing us so
[1:49:50] he's breeding us back to the same faith
[1:49:52] of our fathers the same faith of adam
[1:49:55] see adam he didn't have um
[1:49:58] he didn't have to have faith for the
[1:49:59] things he was doing there's something in
[1:50:01] biology also called instinct it's where
[1:50:04] you just act
[1:50:05] exactly like you're supposed to in a
[1:50:08] given situation
[1:50:09] like right now i don't have to tell
[1:50:11] myself to sweat right now because i'm
[1:50:12] warm
[1:50:13] that's instinct my body just does that
[1:50:16] somebody tries to hit me i move
[1:50:19] that's instinct right you don't have to
[1:50:21] think about that that's just what you do
[1:50:24] we need to get to that point where we
[1:50:25] don't need to pray to god for every move
[1:50:28] we make because it's an instinct he
[1:50:30] wants us to do that there's something in
[1:50:32] our spirit we have a human spirit that
[1:50:34] makes us do this
[1:50:36] now
[1:50:37] that sorry that was a scientific side we
[1:50:38] have a holy spirit that makes us do this
[1:50:41] but there's something in an organism
[1:50:43] that's just passed down you don't have
[1:50:44] to learn to have an instinct
[1:50:47] i want to get to that place with god god
[1:50:49] wants me to do something i'm just right
[1:50:51] there that's where i want to be right
[1:50:55] philippians 1 6
[1:50:57] says
[1:50:57] being confident
[1:50:59] of this very thing that he which have
[1:51:02] begun a good work in you will perform it
[1:51:04] until the day of jesus christ
[1:51:06] see i i started coming up with laws of
[1:51:09] evolution according to god and the first
[1:51:11] one is god does not evolve somebody in
[1:51:14] vain
[1:51:15] he does not evolve somebody in vain he
[1:51:18] started a work in you he's going to
[1:51:19] finish that
[1:51:21] he's going to see you through to the end
[1:51:23] even though you have to strive sometimes
[1:51:24] it seems like a struggle it's like god i
[1:51:26] don't know what to do next but he knows
[1:51:28] exactly what he's going to move you to
[1:51:30] he knows what environment he placed you
[1:51:32] in
[1:51:33] he gave you exactly what you needed and
[1:51:35] he he selected you naturally
[1:51:39] uh
[1:51:41] yeah i also have one more scripture
[1:51:43] romans 12 2
[1:51:45] basically telling us to evolve
[1:51:47] says be not conformed to this world but
[1:51:50] be transformed by the renewing of your
[1:51:52] mind
[1:51:53] that you may prove what is that good and
[1:51:55] acceptable and perfect will of god
[1:51:58] so
[1:52:01] you realize your your
[1:52:04] your body is not going to evolve past
[1:52:06] where it is spiritually speaking until
[1:52:07] you take a rapture
[1:52:09] but
[1:52:10] you can evolve your thoughts
[1:52:12] have god's thoughts you can evolve your
[1:52:14] spirit take on his spirit
[1:52:17] that's what you can do church
[1:52:19] don't miss a beat don't miss a beat in
[1:52:21] your family in your household
[1:52:23] musicians can come back actually but
[1:52:24] don't miss a beat in your family and
[1:52:26] your household just
[1:52:29] i want to have the mind of god yeah and
[1:52:33] i'm so hungry for that
[1:52:35] i don't want to miss out every time he
[1:52:36] takes a move

[1:54:59] [Applause]
[1:55:07] [Music]
[1:55:11] praise the lord
[1:55:13] i certainly appreciate uh
[1:55:15] brother aaron
[1:55:18] on today and just
[1:55:20] wonderful
[1:55:21] thoughts
[1:55:22] about the spiritual mutation
[1:55:25] just you know
[1:55:26] god just uses um
[1:55:28] he makes us all different ways so he can
[1:55:30] use this
[1:55:31] in different ways
[1:55:33] and you know as i was just you know
[1:55:35] listening to brother aaron and um
[1:55:37] how he was able to kind of go back into
[1:55:39] science
[1:55:41] um
[1:55:42] you know they talk about evolution the
[1:55:44] first thing we you know we want to say
[1:55:45] is god is against evolution but wait a
[1:55:48] minute wait a minute wait a minute wait
[1:55:49] a minute let's look at this
[1:55:51] here the prophet you know kind of says
[1:55:53] that he's for evolution but he brings it
[1:55:56] from a different angle and sometimes we
[1:55:58] can just kind of catch those angles on
[1:56:00] the word of god
[1:56:02] there is so much
[1:56:04] in there
[1:56:05] so much in there and as you know just i
[1:56:07] i never heard of the term reverse
[1:56:10] evolution and and and all of this but
[1:56:12] ultimately what our brother was just
[1:56:14] really showing us is how
[1:56:16] yes we lost everything that god gave
[1:56:18] adam
[1:56:19] but through the coming of the word of
[1:56:21] god throughout the seven church ages god
[1:56:23] has brought us right back to the spot
[1:56:25] where adam was
[1:56:26] and it was proven in the life of the
[1:56:28] lord jesus christ amen when he could
[1:56:30] stop the wind and the waves and you know
[1:56:33] just control nature in whatever way he
[1:56:35] did that showed that that was coming
[1:56:37] back
[1:56:37] to man it was being restored it's being
[1:56:40] brooded breeded back into man we have
[1:56:43] this now and not only did it happen in
[1:56:45] the life of christ but god allowed it to
[1:56:47] happen in the life of his prophet
[1:56:49] amen showing that a man that was born
[1:56:51] just like us could operate in this in
[1:56:54] this in this area amen and and i love
[1:56:56] that i love that we can just have
[1:56:59] instinct
[1:57:01] you understand amen god just gives you
[1:57:03] instinct where you know there are
[1:57:05] certain things you're going to come and
[1:57:06] come through and come to in life you
[1:57:09] don't have time to pray about it
[1:57:11] you don't have time to fast about it but
[1:57:13] you can act
[1:57:15] and act knowing that heaven is backing
[1:57:17] you up
[1:57:18] and whatever you whatever decision you
[1:57:20] make god gonna back you up at that
[1:57:22] moment oh hallelujah amen i i
[1:57:26] appreciated that brother aaron god bless
[1:57:28] you
