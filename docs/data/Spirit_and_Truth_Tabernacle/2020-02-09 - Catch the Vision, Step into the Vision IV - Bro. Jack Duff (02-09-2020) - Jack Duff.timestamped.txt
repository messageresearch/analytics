[43:21] I guess the last Monday had started
[43:28] having problems with tooth haven't
[43:32] paying very scruciating pain and I went
[43:35] to the dentist on Wednesday and on
[43:40] Wednesday
[43:42] Dennis told me that I needed over have a
[43:45] root canal and so in the midst of that
[43:50] he gave me a referral so I was kind of
[43:52] trying to find someone to do that but it
[43:55] like from Wednesday up until even this
[44:00] morning every morning it seems like I
[44:03] mean I've been on some taking
[44:06] antibiotics and some painkillers
[44:08] different ones oxycodone and ibuprofen
[44:12] 800 and it works for a while and then it
[44:16] stops and but every morning it seems
[44:19] like around three or four o'clock in the
[44:21] morning the pain it would get very
[44:23] bearable and I would have to get up and
[44:27] I got a couple times I got up and went
[44:29] my prayer closet and I would fight that
[44:31] devil put that pain to go away and by
[44:41] God's grace it by the time I got through
[44:44] praying the pain would go away and and
[44:47] then it would come back and I mentioned
[44:50] it to brother Jack and yesterday and he
[44:53] was like well maybe you should take you
[44:59] that I should probably take my medicine
[45:03] a little bit later at night and maybe
[45:06] that way I helped me get through sleep
[45:08] and I have that pain so I did that last
[45:11] night what a almost three o'clock again
[45:15] here come that devil with that pain and
[45:20] brought it back on and so this morning I
[45:30] was going to was trying to get out
[45:33] because I come to prayer so prayer
[45:35] service in the morning it's 7:00 and I
[45:38] actually got up I got up and I was gonna
[45:45] come at 7:00 but I was just so so weary
[45:49] so tired from having to get up all those
[45:53] different mornings but I just couldn't I
[45:59] didn't have the strength to come in this
[46:03] morning and and so I laid back down or 7
[46:08] o'clock and and then I kind of woke up
[46:13] about 8 o'clock and finally I got up at
[46:18] 4:00 I mean 8:30 and when I got up I I
[46:26] noticed I didn't feel any pain
[46:34] it was before it was before that time I
[46:39] even days I would just touch my my side
[46:42] here and every pain I try to bike down
[46:44] just in the back you know just just pain
[46:47] pain all the time and I thought I said
[46:53] Lord it happened between 7 & 8 I believe
[46:59] and I know the Saints were just praying
[47:02] for me this morning and I know Lord you
[47:06] heard their prayers and and brother
[47:10] branham's speaks of that we have to have
[47:12] faith for divine healing and and I lo I
[47:15] was a repenting to the Lord to help me
[47:17] to have that faith Lord because we have
[47:19] to have that faith to take a rapture and
[47:22] I was repenting I said Lord helped me to
[47:25] have it
[47:26] helped me to have that faith Lord God
[47:28] for divine healing that I will not even
[47:31] be able to I will not even have to have
[47:33] a root care now no medicine no nothing
[47:38] and so I was feeling pretty good I
[47:41] talked to my mom and I told her the
[47:42] testimony and she was praising the Lord
[47:44] I was praising the Lord and I was trying
[47:51] I Khloe I'm gonna tell it I'm we're
[47:53] gonna have give the testimony this
[47:55] morning but then when I came into the
[47:58] church that devil came back he came back
[48:03] and I remember brother Branham said that
[48:07] when you get your healing it could be
[48:10] worse
[48:13] and so I was been trying to remember the
[48:16] words of a prophet and hang on to what
[48:24] God said and what God promised and so
[48:29] from between now and then pain has
[48:33] started to go away again and I think and
[48:37] I just want to ask you to help me to
[48:39] have that strength that faith Lord for
[48:42] divine healing that God will take it
[48:44] away and Olivia
[48:46] complete testimony that the goodness of
[48:50] the God he's the same God yesterday
[48:52] today and forever he can be touched by
[48:55] the feelings of our infirmities and I

[49:02] done for me and I'm claiming my healing
[49:05] right now and even today I've learned to

[58:34] quick before we just get into the sermon
[58:37] I shall be seated just be seated just
[58:41] for a second be seated for a second I
[58:43] want to rush through this I want to just
[58:45] kind of make a quick announcement
[58:47] we were here at prayer the brothers I
[58:51] want to say a month ago that we came on
[58:56] a Tuesday night and we were here and
[58:59] that particular night and I wanted to
[59:05] mention because of because I think what
[59:08] happened at Tuesday night this is why
[59:09] brother Quentin has been kind of going
[59:13] through the devil didn't like what
[59:14] happened that Tuesday night and you know
[59:17] so that that Tuesday night I remember
[59:20] brother Quentin he just kind of shared
[59:22] with me how he was just praying and you
[59:26] know fasting you know that day before he
[59:28] even came to prayer and you know he told
[59:31] the Lord I don't want to eat after
[59:33] prayer that's that's when I want to eat
[59:35] and I think God for things like that
[59:37] right and instead I don't want to eat
[59:39] until after prayer and he says you know
[59:43] so he came in kind of with an
[59:45] expectation and he began to seek the
[59:49] Lord in prayer and and he just got
[59:50] really really caught up and there's some
[59:52] brothers who that's that's witnesses
[59:54] amen to this but he got caught up and
[59:56] the Lord just began to anoint him and he
[59:58] began to speak in tongues and you know
[1:00:00] he got so full he had to just pull away
[1:00:03] from the brothers
[1:00:04] you know we had to just pull away just
[1:00:05] y'all keep praying but I'm praying over
[1:00:08] here and and you know and he just began
[1:00:10] to just just the Lord was just dealing
[1:00:13] with a mess that's a gift that God has
[1:00:15] given him and you know so he just was
[1:00:17] praying and and and the Lord just kept
[1:00:20] dealing with him and he just was just
[1:00:21] worshiping and praying and and and he
[1:00:24] was praying that he was having he was in
[1:00:25] his all world and the other president of
[1:00:27] the world and we were just having a
[1:00:29] wonderful time in the Lord so you know
[1:00:32] at the end of the prayer you know we
[1:00:35] were preparing to leave and then brother
[1:00:37] quake who made the statement he says
[1:00:40] brother Jack the Lord spoke to me
[1:00:44] tonight and and and I just felt led to
[1:00:46] tell you that we need to get prepared
[1:00:49] because the church is about to grow and
[1:00:59] he says we know we need to get ourselves
[1:01:01] some some cards that we can hand out to
[1:01:06] people to invite them to church you know
[1:01:08] that we're not necessarily trying to go
[1:01:10] get folk that go to another church and
[1:01:12] pull them in tie Church is people that
[1:01:14] don't go to church nowhere that needs to
[1:01:17] go to church
[1:01:18] right and what we want to do is try to
[1:01:20] reach them amen we need to you know we
[1:01:24] need to live a life a bleep brother

[1:02:31] was interpreting what brother Quentin
[1:02:33] actually you saying right that's what

[1:02:42] glad you said that I say you know there
[1:02:44] was a sister the Lord blessed us with

[1:06:28] that with a felony you don't have to
[1:06:31] limit you and say there's other ways to
[1:06:35] get work so you can actually start
[1:06:38] yourself in LLC by going to some
[1:06:41] business or work and you start your own
[1:06:45] business you become an entrepreneur and
[1:06:48] say they're not hiring whatever your
[1:06:50] name is the felony they hire your
[1:06:52] business as a so you just got to think a
[1:06:58] little bit outside the box and I say you
[1:07:01] go to church anywhere he said no sir I
[1:07:03] said man you need to go to church get
[1:07:04] connected with people that could help
[1:07:06] you kind of you know stay positive in
[1:07:09] everything I said because what's gonna
[1:07:10] happen is that if you don't find a job
[1:07:12] they're gonna be pulling you to the
[1:07:14] streets all right you don't want to go
[1:07:17] that route I say get connected so I said
[1:07:19] you know I said reach like I said you go
[1:07:21] to churches you can go to you say what's
[1:07:24] your name I say my name Jack if you just
[1:07:27] looking at the car you see Jackie but
[1:07:31] God God presents opportunities
[1:07:33] everywhere for you to just be able to
[1:07:35] share with somebody and just invite them
[1:07:37] right so so Church let's be let's be
[1:07:39] open to that and and you know the reason
[1:07:42] I feel like we're even still here we're
[1:07:44] apt to Bend unpack we should we should
[1:07:46] have been unwrapped a long time ago
[1:07:48] that's my feeling anyway but the reason
[1:07:50] we still here is because there's still
[1:07:52] some predestinated seat somewhere that
[1:07:55] has not heard this gospel and it's our
[1:07:57] job to reach them say man it's our job

[1:12:55] with this catch division and then step
[1:12:59] into it we just want to remind you a man
[1:13:06] of a couple things this thought is
[1:13:09] coming from a testimony of a brother
[1:13:13] Evans a man and brother Evans had his
[1:13:18] had a car stolen from him hey man this
[1:13:22] man somehow got in test drove the car
[1:13:26] and took off with the car and a man and
[1:13:29] didn't bring it back and pretty much
[1:13:30] thought he had got away with it I want
[1:13:33] to tell you something wherever the devil
[1:13:34] has stole from you maybe the devil
[1:13:37] thought he got away for it got away with
[1:13:39] it but when you catch division and step
[1:13:41] into it you're gonna get your stuff back
[1:13:44] hey man you you'll get your joy back
[1:13:48] you'll get your peace back you get your
[1:13:51] money back man you get whatever the
[1:13:53] devil is taken from you that's you know
[1:13:55] that's not the will of God for him just
[1:13:56] to take from you like that a man useful
[1:13:59] to recover all praise the Lord somebody
[1:14:02] you get your relationship back you
[1:14:04] whatever it is that the devil took from
[1:14:06] you get it back praise the Lord
[1:14:09] so you know brother Evans a man was was
[1:14:12] was there was concerned about this and
[1:14:14] just didn't know how things were gonna
[1:14:15] happen but then you know somehow God
[1:14:20] out for somebody to find where this man
[1:14:23] was and and they come back in eight oh
[1:14:25] brother they ever said a man lives in
[1:14:27] Bowling Green you know and they said
[1:14:29] well you know Bowling Green say alright
[1:14:31] so brother Evans never thought anything
[1:14:32] about it and and then God showed the
[1:14:34] Prophet a vision of going through
[1:14:37] Bowling Green and brother Evans actually
[1:14:39] getting his money back but brother
[1:14:42] Branham did not come out specifically
[1:14:44] and tell brother Evans that you're gonna
[1:14:46] get your money back he didn't tell him
[1:14:48] that he just told him we're going to
[1:14:50] Bowling Green he says actually going
[1:14:52] through Bowling Green we're on our way
[1:14:54] to Florida and we're gonna go through
[1:14:56] Bowling Green and brother Evans say okay
[1:14:59] I said that's 30 miles out of the way I
[1:15:01] don't see why because I'm thirty miles
[1:15:02] out of the way we go on the Florida you
[1:15:04] know that's just wasting time rather
[1:15:06] than have that type of attitude he just
[1:15:08] kind of kept ponder and say wait a
[1:15:09] minutes happened take at it brother
[1:15:11] branham didn't you say we was going
[1:15:13] through Bowling Green he said yes he
[1:15:15] said brother branham that man that got
[1:15:18] the car for me he lives in Bowling Green
[1:15:20] he said yes and he say say say if it was
[1:15:25] you you know brother branham if it was
[1:15:28] you what would you do if you was going
[1:15:31] through Bowling Green would you go get
[1:15:32] your money you say brother Evans I'd go
[1:15:35] get my money hallelujah glory to God
[1:15:39] it's time for you to go and get some
[1:15:41] things that the devil took from you and
[1:15:42] i'ma tell you you came wait for the
[1:15:45] devil to bring it to you you gonna have
[1:15:47] to go take it from him the same way he
[1:15:49] took it from you come on somebody catch
[1:15:53] the vision and did step into it he say
[1:15:56] brother if it was me I'd go get my money
[1:15:58] brother ever said going up here I got
[1:15:59] his address we going to get the money
[1:16:01] knocked on a man's dough and he got the
[1:16:02] money from the man glory to God but that
[1:16:05] he had to catch the vision first before
[1:16:07] he stepped into it we brought to you a
[1:16:10] man a couple of other things and
[1:16:16] hallelujah I brought to you just the the
[1:16:19] story of Lazarus and how he died a man
[1:16:23] and when it once he once he died Jesus
[1:16:27] already knew that Lazarus was gonna rise
[1:16:30] again
[1:16:31] Jesus by vision knew exactly when to go
[1:16:34] when they call for Jesus to come and a
[1:16:36] man and he'd never showed up because you
[1:16:39] know they had confidence and that had
[1:16:41] Jesus got there before Lazarus died that
[1:16:44] Lazarus would have never experienced
[1:16:47] death hallelujah and sometimes Amen
[1:16:51] that's the way we feel we we won't we
[1:16:53] won't God to come on the scene at a
[1:16:54] certain time because amen it would block
[1:16:57] the person from going through a
[1:16:59] particular thing Lazarus would have
[1:17:01] never received death but God has
[1:17:03] something greater in mind praise God I
[1:17:07] want to encourage you this morning
[1:17:09] amen no matter what you're going through
[1:17:10] you might feel like God has not made it
[1:17:12] on time he has something greater in mind
[1:17:16] hallelujah and what he had greater in
[1:17:18] mind for Lazarus imma let him experience
[1:17:21] death but I'm I also do something that
[1:17:23] they never seen before they might
[1:17:25] believe in it but they never seen this
[1:17:27] before I'm gonna raise them from the
[1:17:30] dead hallelujah so when he goes there to
[1:17:32] Lazarus grave and and and Martha
[1:17:35] separating herself from a certain
[1:17:38] atmosphere she says she say Lord I know
[1:17:40] you didn't come when we wanted you to
[1:17:41] come but even now I believe that
[1:17:44] whatever you ask God you can have it he
[1:17:49] made it I believe the Holy Spirit say
[1:17:51] even now whatever you ask God you can
[1:17:55] have it oh yeah Martha declared her
[1:17:59] faith a man and even even though
[1:18:02] American get herself out of the
[1:18:05] atmosphere he still told Martha Mary on
[1:18:07] your part of this vision now and say
[1:18:10] y'all gonna have to do something before
[1:18:11] I do something say roll the stone away
[1:18:15] when they got the stone rolled away and
[1:18:18] all them strong men around somebody else
[1:18:20] could've rolled a certain way but no
[1:18:22] they had to be a part of this
[1:18:24] hallelujah they they couldn't depend on
[1:18:27] nobody a damn part in the vision
[1:18:30] what's the role that stone away and that
[1:18:32] might be your part role that doubt away
[1:18:35] role that fear away from giving what
[1:18:41] you're supposed to get from God roll
[1:18:43] away please let God have his way they
[1:18:52] roll the stone away and then Jesus did
[1:18:55] something there then the vision finally
[1:18:57] manifests itself
[1:18:58] he says Lazarus come forth and when
[1:19:03] Lazarus come out that grave a man
[1:19:05] walking the minute he had been gone for
[1:19:07] four days came out of the grave walking
[1:19:11] what a powerful powerful a man
[1:19:15] demonstration of Almighty God at that
[1:19:17] moment only God can raise the dead he
[1:19:20] meant only God could be in Christ doing
[1:19:22] that and you know and and and and you
[1:19:24] know so here we saw them that was once
[1:19:26] they was take off the vision then they
[1:19:29] stepped into it and they enjoyed the
[1:19:30] blessings of it
[1:19:32] glory to God let's go on a little
[1:19:34] further Amen hallelujah now our last
[1:19:38] time we come
[1:19:39] I brought to you a man the story of Mary
[1:19:44] a man but I want to just read a couple
[1:19:47] quotes ears we set this up and then
[1:19:50] we'll go a little further and I'm
[1:19:51] pulling from Genesis but we want to go
[1:19:54] back and get to Mary just for a little
[1:19:56] bit and then we'll get back to Sarah but
[1:19:57] I want to start here in the message
[1:19:59] pergamene church H because this vision
[1:20:03] that I'm talking about you catching a
[1:20:05] man is stepping into it is a much
[1:20:08] greater vision a man then just common
[1:20:13] 20/20 vision what people are talking
[1:20:16] about today 20/20 vision is very normal
[1:20:19] a man is very natural for just about
[1:20:24] everybody got it
[1:20:26] a man and those that don't have it then
[1:20:28] we just use glasses to help us get a
[1:20:29] look closer to it right but but
[1:20:31] everybody
[1:20:32] as normal vision we we all want just
[1:20:34] normal vision a man we what we want
[1:20:37] supernatural vision praise God we want
[1:20:41] to step into something a little higher
[1:20:42] than what everybody else got we're not
[1:20:44] trying to be like everybody else we
[1:20:46] actually want to be different
[1:20:48] hey man I want all that God has for me I
[1:20:51] don't want to miss that in this hour
[1:20:53] amen I don't want to miss it naturally
[1:20:55] nor do I want to miss it spiritually
[1:20:58] praise the Lord Amen I thank God for all
[1:21:01] the natural blessings but I'm certainly
[1:21:02] looking for all the spiritual blessings
[1:21:04] to be poured out as well
[1:21:05] so so here we're talking about you know
[1:21:08] because it's very easy for a person to
[1:21:09] kind of get up a collar I got a vision I
[1:21:11] got a vision God gave me an idea guy
[1:21:13] yeah I mean that's good that I bless you
[1:21:14] here but will that get you out of here
[1:21:18] huh I mean that that vision that you got
[1:21:22] for your own personal self will that get
[1:21:25] you out of here
[1:21:26] praise the Lord let me tell you
[1:21:28] something I don't care how great your
[1:21:30] job is I don't care how big your title
[1:21:34] is on the job if something would have
[1:21:36] happened to you right now they replace
[1:21:38] you in no time
[1:21:40] and that title will go to somebody else
[1:21:43] so there's a greater vision than your
[1:21:46] natural vision we gotta step into what
[1:21:49] we call spiritual vision we gotta see
[1:21:52] what God's vision is for us and I want
[1:21:54] to tell you his ways are higher than our
[1:21:57] ways as thoughts
[1:21:58] amen are greater than our thoughts so
[1:22:00] glory to God we want to step into the
[1:22:02] saw the vision that I'm presenting to
[1:22:04] you it's a vision that the angel had
[1:22:08] concerning you before you were even born
[1:22:11] I hope that doesn't go over your hand
[1:22:15] the angel had this vision for you before
[1:22:19] you were even born can I tell you
[1:22:21] another thing that angel of God has a
[1:22:24] vision and I don't know angel God and
[1:22:26] God himself has a vision of Mary before
[1:22:30] she was even born
[1:22:32] amen when God said a virgin would
[1:22:35] conceive God already knew who the Virgin
[1:22:37] was
[1:22:38] and no matter how many virgins amen try
[1:22:43] to you know make like they were pregnant
[1:22:48] and that make as if they were the
[1:22:51] fulfillment of that many virgins will
[1:22:54] step out and give testimonies about I'm
[1:22:58] pregnant a man I am the Virgin s
[1:23:01] conceiving and they would step up and
[1:23:04] tell everybody how they were gonna
[1:23:05] fulfill Isaiah's words but nothing would
[1:23:08] happen to them amen and there's been
[1:23:12] many churches the Prophet said it this
[1:23:16] way churches churches but there has to
[1:23:22] come one that will be the fulfillment of
[1:23:25] the manifestation I don't care how many
[1:23:27] churches don't think they could claim
[1:23:30] these things but there has a man we have
[1:23:32] come to a time where the church is
[1:23:34] stepping to the vision that God had for
[1:23:38] Mary Mary was the one that God had in
[1:23:42] his mind it took 700 years before she
[1:23:44] was produced on the earth a man but yet
[1:23:47] she was the one that God said she gonna
[1:23:49] fulfill this and there was something
[1:23:51] spoken about you before you even were
[1:23:54] born an angel told the Prophet pick up
[1:23:58] your pen and write pick up your pen and
[1:24:01] write and say this message that I'm
[1:24:03] gonna write it's for the church and here
[1:24:06] I can say 60 years later this message is
[1:24:10] now coming alive and this is the vision
[1:24:14] that I'm trying to get us to step into
[1:24:17] let's read a little bit Amen about this
[1:24:21] vision here in pergamene church age one
[1:24:24] night I was seeking the Lord the Holy
[1:24:28] Spirit told me to pick up my pen and
[1:24:30] write as I grasped the pen to write his
[1:24:33] Spirit gave me a message for the church
[1:24:35] I want to bring it to you it has to do
[1:24:38] with the word and the bride oh it has to
[1:24:43] do with the word and the bride there's a

[1:25:24] church can we even just go to the
[1:25:30] natural just for a little bit when a man
[1:25:32] is out seeking a bride amen
[1:25:36] he's not just trying to find somebody

[1:28:10] hallelujah glory to God there's a
[1:28:13] greater vision here it's a greater
[1:28:15] vision right so so so when we look at
[1:28:18] this Christ was not just looking for
[1:28:20] people to come to church when when he
[1:28:24] started dealing with debt with your
[1:28:25] heart it wasn't for you just to be
[1:28:27] sitting on him on a seat in the church
[1:28:29] he was looking for something greater
[1:28:31] than that I'm looking for a woman a so a
[1:28:34] spiritual woman that I can put my put
[1:28:38] the ring on it what ring - ring the
[1:28:40] wedding band of grace
[1:28:43] oh I want to give a wedding banner grace
[1:28:48] and I might as well tell you this while
[1:28:50] I have you there do you realize that
[1:28:52] before you were even born you came to
[1:28:56] the earth with the wedding band already
[1:28:58] on that's why you can stay in tune our
[1:29:02] nation's that's why you couldn't stay in
[1:29:05] the world you something begin to deal
[1:29:07] with their heart you had to come because
[1:29:09] you already had that wedding band on a
[1:29:12] commitment was already made for you
[1:29:15] before you even got here and can I tell
[1:29:20] you something else
[1:29:21] it one just made for you you had already
[1:29:23] made a commitment before you got here
[1:29:28] you've already made a commitment that's
[1:29:31] why I got don't waste this time on
[1:29:32] nobody God already knew where soon as
[1:29:35] this word crosses your path you're gonna
[1:29:36] say yes will you marry me I will will
[1:29:42] you forsake all others I will will you
[1:29:49] forsake the things of the world that's
[1:29:57] what happened when you stand a man to
[1:29:59] give you a heart to the Lord Jesus
[1:30:01] you said I'm leaving everything else
[1:30:03] back and I'm standing with him now when
[1:30:07] he gives when he receives a wife he has
[1:30:11] a desire he wants to produce children
[1:30:14] I'm talking spiritually now he may he
[1:30:18] wants to produce he actually was I could
[1:30:20] put it this way he wants to reproduce
[1:30:21] himself and that's where you come in the
[1:30:27] only way this work doesn't get done is
[1:30:29] through you so this is more than just
[1:30:32] being a church member this is actually
[1:30:33] being bright bright bright now let's
[1:30:38] read this because this message was for
[1:30:40] the word Amen it has to do with the word
[1:30:43] and the bride this message that the
[1:30:46] angel was speaking has something to with
[1:30:48] the word and the bride
[1:30:50] listen this is important to me because I
[1:30:52] realized that even as the bright
[1:30:55] sometimes we don't understand the word
[1:30:59] sometimes we don't understand the words
[1:31:02] we're in we can we can be identified
[1:31:04] ourselves as the bride but we're not
[1:31:06] catching Amen what the word is doing
[1:31:09] hallelujah
[1:31:10] I mean can I know i'ma get to some of
[1:31:14] these quotes but as it comes to me I
[1:31:15] just want to give it to you is that
[1:31:16] Alright but you know the men I mean
[1:31:21] Sarah was going through changes all the
[1:31:23] time and you know Sarah laughed at the
[1:31:27] promise which he first received it God
[1:31:30] Himself spoke to Sarah and she was
[1:31:32] laughing at the promise I got good news
[1:31:35] I don't care how much you doubt I don't
[1:31:39] care how much you disbelieve what's
[1:31:40] being spoke to you
[1:31:41] hey man I told you this before and i'ma
[1:31:44] tell you this kid God ain't playing
[1:31:46] games when he's releasing sermons like
[1:31:47] this to you you can go to any church and
[1:31:51] hear any sermon but to come to this
[1:31:53] church and hear this sermon I'm telling
[1:31:56] you God he playing no games God got a
[1:32:02] purpose for speaking these things to you
[1:32:04] I don't care you might say man I don't
[1:32:09] I'm getting it I ain't getting like it I
[1:32:11] don't know well Lord that's just going
[1:32:13] way over my head just keep sitting there
[1:32:15] that's maybe maybe it's got to be that
[1:32:17] way for you amen in order for you to
[1:32:19] come back because we're not just trying
[1:32:20] to appease your flesh I come from the
[1:32:24] church buddy we split what he used to
[1:32:25] hold her ear
[1:32:26] and sing the sermon and the reason they
[1:32:29] had to sing the sermon because they
[1:32:30] wasn't saying nothing let me tell you
[1:32:35] something and when I read the Bible I
[1:32:37] can't see Jesus yeah I can't see Jesus
[1:32:45] doing none of that he just preached the
[1:32:48] word and when that word struck the food
[1:32:51] on the inside that's what produces a
[1:32:55] change in the people
[1:32:56] [Applause]
[1:32:57] we're not here to entertain we're here
[1:33:01] to get people ready for a rapture please
[1:33:05] God glory to God I had my sham
[1:33:11] entertainment in church I don't want
[1:33:14] more of it man can sing like I don't
[1:33:18] know what I can't live like nothing we
[1:33:22] don't need that no more we want people
[1:33:24] that can preach it and live it if you
[1:33:29] don't reach it praise God but here you
[1:33:38] know you know Sarah was laughing at it
[1:33:42] but here God went over the top of all
[1:33:45] her laugh and all her unbelief and they
[1:33:48] still manifest himself in Sarah and I
[1:33:51] want to tell you that God's going over
[1:33:52] the top of your unbelief your doubt and
[1:33:56] he's still gonna manifest himself
[1:33:57] through you because this message is
[1:34:01] father amen it still has to do with the
[1:34:04] word and the bride other thing about
[1:34:08] Sarah that I found out is that Sarah had
[1:34:11] already been experienced in changes
[1:34:13] before she came to the manifestation of
[1:34:15] Isaac before she actually produced the
[1:34:22] promised son she had already gone
[1:34:25] through changes Abraham himself had
[1:34:28] already gone through changes amen
[1:34:31] I'm trying to say I'm sharing it with
[1:34:33] you because you don't realize it but the
[1:34:35] Word of God is changing you right now
[1:34:42] the Word of God is not going to change
[1:34:45] you in the future the Word of God is
[1:34:49] changing you right now
[1:34:54] that's why you dress different that's
[1:34:57] why you speak different that's why you
[1:35:00] think different that's why you are
[1:35:02] different because the Word of God you
[1:35:06] are being washed by the water of the
[1:35:09] word and that one is changing you right
[1:35:12] now that's why you can't get away from
[1:35:18] the fellowship in the word after you in

[1:38:32] forth after its own kind even according
[1:38:36] to Genesis 111 and God said let the
[1:38:40] earth bring forth grass and the herb
[1:38:42] yielding seed and the fruit tree
[1:38:45] yielding fruit after his kind whose seed
[1:38:48] is in itself upon the earth and it was
[1:38:51] so whatever life was in the seat came
[1:38:56] forth into a plant a man this is a this
[1:39:02] is you if you can just look at it it's a
[1:39:04] process the seed get quicken the seed

[1:39:27] news for you plant if you stay
[1:39:30] underneath the presence
[1:39:33] of the s/o in you keep getting moisture
[1:39:39] your plant will eventually produce fruit
[1:39:42] in a produce so much fruit that you'll
[1:39:50] get to pour it like mama got - I'm ready
[1:39:53] to cut the tree down it's so much fruit

[1:42:15] the fruit tree yielding fruit after sky
[1:42:17] whose seed is in itself upon everything
[1:42:19] it was so whatever life was in the sea
[1:42:21] came forth into a plant and Vince into
[1:42:24] fruit so we come in there this is where
[1:42:27] we hit this is where we are the very
[1:42:29] same law applies to the church today
[1:42:33] what ever see started the church will
[1:42:38] come forth and be like the original seed
[1:42:42] because it is the same seed what you saw
[1:42:51] in Jesus we should see in us if you go
[1:42:56] into a church and they not trying to
[1:42:57] produce that something wrong they got
[1:42:59] the wrong seed man what was in Jesus is
[1:43:03] supposed to be in the church today
[1:43:05] this is where reproducing himself is all
[1:43:08] about glory to God we got work to do
[1:43:12] don't get caught up in the things of the
[1:43:14] world we got work to do
[1:43:17] listen says whatever seat started a
[1:43:20] church will come forth and be like the
[1:43:21] originally caused it's the same seat in
[1:43:22] these last days a true bright Church
[1:43:25] Christ seat will come to the headstone
[1:43:26] and this is this is powerful to me I say

[1:49:12] rings
[1:49:16] three different no other sister can
[1:49:19] claim that but because she's bright see
[1:49:23] she got yeah I think she hit me at the
[1:49:26] 10-year anniversary she got me Oh jack
[1:49:30] okay okay because she's bride I went
[1:49:34] along with it then it 25 years she got
[1:49:36] me again because she's bright she get
[1:49:40] benefits she's the only one that goes
[1:49:44] home with me you understand she's bright
[1:49:47] ain't nobody else nobody else should be
[1:49:49] coming to my house like that hey man
[1:49:54] don't even trying to do that right but
[1:49:57] because she's brought she get benefits
[1:49:59] amen and because you're brought to
[1:50:01] Christ you suppose I have benefits let
[1:50:08] me go forward I have not even got to
[1:50:12] where I want it to be but God knows all
[1:50:14] things super-race as she nears him they
[1:50:23] in the bra would be so much like him
[1:50:25] that they would be even be his very
[1:50:27] image this is in order to be united with
[1:50:31] him can people say you look like Jesus
[1:50:34] or even say this man you act like Jesus
[1:50:40] that's what they supposed to be saying
[1:50:43] right
[1:50:44] his very image this is in order to be
[1:50:46] united with him they will be one they
[1:50:51] will be the very manifestation of the
[1:50:53] word of Living God
[1:50:54] denominations cannot produce this it's
[1:50:57] the wrong seed they reduced their crease
[1:51:00] in their dogmas mixed with the word thus
[1:51:02] mongrel I this mongrel eyes and brings
[1:51:04] forth a hybrid product now let's keep
[1:51:06] going now remember the the says the law
[1:51:10] reproduction was to that each speech see
[1:51:12] bring forth after its own kind and when
[1:51:14] you're when it's when it's when
[1:51:15] something is reproducing that means it's
[1:51:18] having offspring I mean it also means of
[1:51:21] the word reproduction means had to have
[1:51:24] offspring it means to produce again amen
[1:51:28] also means to copy to imitate to
[1:51:32] multiply so if the law of reproduction
[1:51:36] amen it's placed upon each and every one
[1:51:39] of us because the seed that started was
[1:51:41] God he started this church right so I
[1:51:44] mean he started his church so that the
[1:51:45] seed that was supposed to be produces is
[1:51:47] the life of Christ amen it's supposed to
[1:51:50] produce again it's supposed to be
[1:51:53] supposed to be a copy nah I don't know
[1:51:55] about you but I've made copies I was at
[1:51:57] the store the other day and so that's
[1:51:58] where I made these from I make copies I
[1:52:00] got copies but um while I was in the
[1:52:03] store there was a lady that come in and
[1:52:05] made us some copies and and when she
[1:52:07] made the copies some of the ink was all
[1:52:09] smeared all over the copy it just didn't
[1:52:12] look right it didn't look presentable to
[1:52:14] give to somebody so she so she come to
[1:52:17] the desk say look I don't even need
[1:52:18] another machine I'm gonna need my money
[1:52:20] back because this is not considered a
[1:52:23] copy are you with me yet look at your
[1:52:31] life you just came off the copy machine
[1:52:36] examine yourself this does not look like
[1:52:39] a copy we don't have to give this thing
[1:52:44] six because I'm not leaving here paying
[1:52:47] for that and I'm gonna tell you Jesus
[1:52:49] didn't die on the cross paid that great
[1:52:53] price to produce nonsense he won't say
[1:52:57] exact copies
[1:52:59] Oh Laurie and I'm not I'm not sure you
[1:53:06] know why are we waiting on something we
[1:53:09] need to come into this now we need to
[1:53:12] conform to this now let's go on let's go
[1:53:16] on let's go on the first son Adam was
[1:53:19] spoken word spoken see word of God he
[1:53:22] was given a bride to reproduce himself
[1:53:25] Adam was given a bride to reproduce
[1:53:28] himself that's the whole purpose that
[1:53:31] God gave Eve to Adam to reproduce
[1:53:33] himself you've been given to Christ to
[1:53:36] reproduce Christ that is why the bride
[1:53:40] was given to him to reproduce himself to
[1:53:42] produce another son of God but she fails
[1:53:45] she fits she failed by hybridization she
[1:53:48] calls him to die Oh Lord Eve calls Adam
[1:53:58] to die I hope y'all get that that's why
[1:54:05] I tell y'all be careful don't be trying
[1:54:07] to get your husband's in some position
[1:54:10] Amen where it might cause him to die
[1:54:13] spiritually compromising with things Eve
[1:54:18] compromise with the Word of God and it
[1:54:20] calls her husband he loved her so much
[1:54:23] that he went intentionally and did what
[1:54:27] she did because he knew that she'd be
[1:54:30] separated from him she was a part of him
[1:54:33] she knew that he knew that man I won't
[1:54:36] have him them oh so he intensely went
[1:54:37] out there and fell in sin with Eve gave
[1:54:40] up his position hallelujah but it was a
[1:54:46] perfect type of the Lord Jesus he was
[1:54:49] sitting in heaven gave up his position
[1:54:51] to come down to earth and to die for
[1:54:55] sinful man he was not a sinner but he
[1:54:59] became sin that we might become his
[1:55:02] righteousness thank God for that but
[1:55:07] don't put yourself don't put your
[1:55:08] husband's position Amen that you might
[1:55:10] cause him to die
[1:55:12] spiritually look at this the second son
[1:55:15] Jesus also a spoken C Word of God was
[1:55:19] given a bright like as was Adam but
[1:55:22] before he could marry her she was all
[1:55:23] she also had fallen she liked Adams wife
[1:55:28] was put to the test whether she would
[1:55:30] believe the Word of God and live or
[1:55:32] doubt the word and die she doubted she
[1:55:36] let the word she died it goes on but
[1:55:40] from a little group of the true seed of
[1:55:43] the words God will present Christ with a
[1:55:46] beloved bride she is a virgin of his
[1:55:51] word she is a virgin because she knows
[1:55:55] no man-made Creed's or dogmas by and
[1:56:00] through the members of the bride will be
[1:56:02] fulfill all that was promised of God to
[1:56:05] be made manifest in the virgin let me go
[1:56:09] on a little further the word of promise
[1:56:11] came to the Virgin Mary hallelujah and I
[1:56:15] love the way the Angels given a prophet
[1:56:16] distant pick up your pen and write
[1:56:18] because the word of promise is coming to
[1:56:19] you you're not you're not here a man
[1:56:23] following something creat you're not
[1:56:25] here following some dogma you're not
[1:56:27] here following some denominational
[1:56:29] doctrine but you're here because you
[1:56:31] agree with God's Word do you realize a
[1:56:34] change to placing you the data to
[1:56:37] accepted the message you realize a
[1:56:43] change happen I remember brother Mike
[1:56:48] Mike say he come to the church and how
[1:56:51] brother Hugo was used that day preached
[1:56:54] the gospel and brother Mike first time
[1:56:56] in the church for the IRA brought him
[1:56:58] and him here come Mike IRA and Bobby
[1:57:03] well I wonder what a combination God God
[1:57:06] used some situations in brother Mike's
[1:57:08] old church the cause I'm gonna have to
[1:57:11] start searching to go somewhere else God
[1:57:14] used some situations and brother IRAs
[1:57:16] church thing that caused him to say that
[1:57:18] and when brother Mike said I'm looking
[1:57:20] for a church that don't play no games
[1:57:22] I know how to sing so don't take me to
[1:57:24] the church that can show me how to sing
[1:57:26] it I want to go to church that's real
[1:57:29] and he used some situations and brother
[1:57:32] IRAs like the provider say I can't take
[1:57:34] you to my church but I know where to
[1:57:36] take you and they got in the car and put
[1:57:39] brother Bobby in the car with him and
[1:57:41] they drove out to the church and here
[1:57:44] brother you go preaching that day and
[1:57:45] brother Mike got so wrapped up he come
[1:57:47] down to the to the Alton just just just
[1:57:49] crying out to God the very next Sunday
[1:57:52] he was on his way to his church got to a
[1:57:54] certain Street and when he made that
[1:57:58] turn the Holy Ghost was direct of him
[1:58:00] and from that day he made that turn he
[1:58:03] never went back to that other church
[1:58:05] again only to visit someone's got to get
[1:58:12] to a point where we make a turn and when
[1:58:15] we make the turn we also making a
[1:58:16] decision that I'm not going back to
[1:58:20] where I used to be I'm committed to
[1:58:23] Christ the word of promise came to the
[1:58:31] Virgin Mary but that word of promise was
[1:58:35] he himself to be made manifest God was
[1:58:37] made manifest himself acted at the time
[1:58:40] of fulfilled his own word of promise in
[1:58:42] the Virgin it was an angel that had
[1:58:44] brought her the message
[1:58:46] but the Angel's message was the Word of
[1:58:48] God Isaiah 9:6 He fulfilled at that time
[1:58:52] all that was written of him because she
[1:58:55] accepted his word to her now that was
[1:58:58] that was that was the big thing there
[1:59:00] when the angel came to Mary say you are
[1:59:04] blessed too highly favored so you know
[1:59:06] there was a promise sitting out there
[1:59:08] Isaiah 7 and 14 in Genesis 3 and 15
[1:59:11] these were things that were spoken about
[1:59:13] a man a virgin would actually conceive
[1:59:15] the woman's seed right a virgin
[1:59:18] conceiving these were promises that were
[1:59:20] made and God knew in his mind who the
[1:59:23] Virgin was going to be but when God
[1:59:25] finally I mean seven hundred years after
[1:59:27] Isaiah spoke here the word comes
[1:59:29] searching searching searching searching
[1:59:32] searching just like a text message
[1:59:35] through you right now the Word of God
[1:59:38] has passing through this atmosphere
[1:59:42] searching for hearts that he could just
[1:59:44] land on and when he finally got to Mary
[1:59:47] Mary your highly favored Mary you know
[1:59:51] say Mary you know you can't have a child
[1:59:53] and that child gonna be named so how
[1:59:55] does how does come P I don't even know a
[1:59:57] man he said the Holy Ghost gonna
[1:59:59] overshadow you Mary ain't gonna bring
[2:00:01] this thing to pass say not only is the
[2:00:03] Holy Ghost overshadow you but I want to
[2:00:05] tell you know your cousin Elizabeth in a
[2:00:08] Oh H she's pregnant six months pregnant

[2:00:13] Merritt's say what mayor say being unto
[2:00:17] me according to thy word and God has
[2:00:20] been looking for a few people they were
[2:00:23] just just just yield surrender empty out
[2:00:29] and say be it unto me God according to
[2:00:32] your word I brought I was brought here
[2:00:36] as brought to reproduce you a man that's
[2:00:41] my whole purpose to reproduce Christ let
[2:00:44] me tell you something Jesus is greater
[2:00:49] than anybody that ever lived on this
[2:00:52] earth I want you to try to read between
[2:00:59] the lines Jesus is greater than anybody
[2:01:06] that ever lived on this earth Jesus our
[2:01:12] attention has got to be on Jesus
[2:01:15] hallelujah Amen it's all about Jesus my
[2:01:20] life is about him right
[2:01:22] amen in him I live I'm moving I have my
[2:01:25] being it's all in Christ
[2:01:27] I don't want Jesus just be something on
[2:01:28] the side I want him to be my everything
[2:01:31] I want him to be my all and all and no
[2:01:35] matter what happens in this world is not
[2:01:36] going to take my attention off Jesus
[2:01:39] praise the Lord all right Mary said
[2:01:43] being unto me according to thy word and
[2:01:44] this is where God has been trying to get
[2:01:46] us when when when Satan tried to come
[2:01:48] and present some doubt to Mary brother
[2:01:50] Branham say Mary shifted out away she
[2:01:53] should get away hey man you got to shake
[2:01:55] some things away amen hallelujah she
[2:01:58] said be it unto me according to thy word
[2:02:00] and brother Branham saying when she made
[2:02:01] those words when she made that statement
[2:02:03] that's what brought the life that's what
[2:02:06] produced the pregnancy that's what
[2:02:08] produced the change no feeling no
[2:02:10] emotion just an agreement with the word
[2:02:13] can I get somebody to just agree with
[2:02:16] God's Word every time you say man you
[2:02:22] agreeing with the word and do you
[2:02:24] realize your Amen is producing a change
[2:02:26] in you man I got it I got a statement
[2:02:31] that and I won't have time to read it
[2:02:33] all today but Abraham experienced
[2:02:40] adoption before he experienced receiving
[2:02:44] the promised son brother Branham say
[2:02:47] Abraham was adopted when his name was
[2:02:51] changed he because God Himself was
[2:02:56] Elohim and he gave Abraham a part of his
[2:03:00] name
[2:03:01] when he became Abraham he took on the
[2:03:04] father's name and that allow Abraham's
[2:03:07] name on the check
[2:03:09] [Music]
[2:03:11] to be as good as a father's name because
[2:03:14] he had a part of the father's thing and
[2:03:17] everybody on earth is named after the
[2:03:20] Lord Jesus Christ oh my my my
[2:03:24] we got to realize these things already
[2:03:26] happen in church oh man let me go on I
[2:03:28] come back and hit that later on let me
[2:03:31] let me uh this this is a statement this
[2:03:34] is out of the message Abraham and his
[2:03:36] seed after him and then I want to just
[2:03:38] pick up Sarah if I can just for a few
[2:03:40] minutes and we'll try to bring it on
[2:03:42] home Abraham and his seed after him let
[2:03:43] me just read this it says when Abraham's
[2:03:47] body was changed Sarah's body was
[2:03:50] changed like it never had been changed
[2:03:54] before now we all know that when Jesus
[2:03:57] comes we'll be caught up in a rapture we
[2:04:01] know our bodies will have to be changed
[2:04:02] first and it won't have to be just go
[2:04:06] back to young men and women say that was
[2:04:08] the first change where I went back to
[2:04:10] young men when I'm a girl okay II 79 or
[2:04:12] agree just go back to young men and
[2:04:15] women so that was the first change that
[2:04:16] that Sarah and Abraham went through it
[2:04:18] was a constant change happened this is
[2:04:20] why I was telling you the word is doing
[2:04:22] that to us right now so when we're
[2:04:23] changed in a moment in a twinkling of an
[2:04:25] eye it's because the process of change
[2:04:26] had already started amen Oh y'all don't
[2:04:30] get that the process of change should
[2:04:33] already be started it's not like you're
[2:04:34] just gonna lose everything and just just
[2:04:36] like that no you should be losing now
[2:04:38] it's you dropping off for you right now
[2:04:40] hey man what it says it won't have to be
[2:04:44] just go back to young men and women but
[2:04:46] it'll have to be changed because Abraham
[2:04:48] and Sarah's body had to be changed in a
[2:04:50] way that they could receive the promised
[2:04:52] son
[2:04:53] that's Abraham his body had to be
[2:04:56] changed to receive the promised son
[2:04:58] after being justified now again notice
[2:05:00] he had already had a external change
[2:05:04] they were already this external change
[2:05:07] was something that even even a king
[2:05:09] recognize Sarah at ninety years old at
[2:05:12] being a young woman a man even a king
[2:05:16] recognizing the man was praying for a
[2:05:19] wife he saw 90 year old grandma
[2:05:22] two up in his town and he said I got to
[2:05:25] have her for my wife and now what was
[2:05:28] his purpose for having his wife my eye
[2:05:30] candy he wanted children reproduction so
[2:05:37] they say I got a heaven and Abraham lies
[2:05:40] now there's something in there oh I
[2:05:44] can't I'm lead out when I'm coming back
[2:05:46] I'm gonna come back to Abraham lies and
[2:05:49] say that's my sister
[2:05:50] he said now he said thank you Lord this
[2:05:53] man brought his sister down here and he
[2:05:54] was just praying and thinking God and
[2:05:56] God say don't you touch that man's wife
[2:05:58] what wife the man said sister so you
[2:06:02] better not touch his wife you touch that
[2:06:04] man's wife I kill you and everybody
[2:06:06] around here so what'd he say he said not
[2:06:10] only did I want you not to touch him I
[2:06:12] want you to take his wife back to him
[2:06:14] and then I want you to have him pray for
[2:06:17] you what went back had Abraham pray said
[2:06:23] this man is Elias no no you're not a
[2:06:24] liar
[2:06:25] Oh God say he my prophet he's my prophet
[2:06:30] I'm trying to get you to see something
[2:06:33] cuz you are Abraham's seed and your
[2:06:36] heirs according to the promise I don't
[2:06:39] care what label that devil has assigned
[2:06:42] to you you are not that you are who God
[2:06:46] says you are even in your fallen state
[2:06:53] y'all ain't got that
[2:06:57] even in your fallen state you are still
[2:07:01] a son of God you are still a daughter
[2:07:04] part your failure does not disconnect
[2:07:09] you from your father can I say that
[2:07:14] again
[2:07:15] your failure does not disconnect you
[2:07:18] from your father this is a blood
[2:07:23] relationship place-cards ain't just join
[2:07:32] the family I was born into this a man a
[2:07:35] man glory hallelujah
[2:07:40] look at this look at this he says
[2:07:42] because Abraham Sarah body had to be
[2:07:45] changed in a way that they could receive
[2:07:46] the promised son
[2:07:47] that's Abraham his body had to be
[2:07:49] changed to receive the promised son B
[2:07:50] after being justified sanctify filled
[2:07:53] with the Holy Spirit
[2:07:54] called bi-election manifested God of
[2:07:58] glory in the midst of him and then his
[2:08:00] body was changed in order to receive the
[2:08:03] promised son he goes on well the church
[2:08:07] has come through justification
[2:08:08] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:08:12] gifts manifest it to it and now what the
[2:08:16] Spirit of God moving in the church doing
[2:08:18] the same work set Jesus did before he
[2:08:20] left as a promise and what's the next
[2:08:23] thing the change the next thing happened
[2:08:27] Abraham was a changed body now this is
[2:08:29] something that happened on the inside
[2:08:30] right there was already an external
[2:08:33] change we should see the external
[2:08:35] changes happening now but then there
[2:08:38] happened to be a change on the inside
[2:08:40] where now they can reproduce but see it
[2:08:44] already go he he and her had already
[2:08:46] gone back to looking like young people
[2:08:48] again Oh hallelujah
[2:08:49] there's an external change that took
[2:08:51] place first in church that's what we're
[2:08:54] going through the word it's what's doing
[2:08:55] that right now
[2:08:56] amen but that same word that produced
[2:08:59] the external change is the same word
[2:09:02] it's going to produce the internal
[2:09:04] change it's not gonna be something that
[2:09:06] you did it's the spirit that comes on
[2:09:09] the word that makes it
[2:09:10] thing happened all right let me let me
[2:09:12] let me let me try to finish up here says
[2:09:15] he had to have it
[2:09:18] the next thing happened Abraham was a
[2:09:20] change about he had to have it or he
[2:09:22] never got the Sun and the next thing
[2:09:25] happens to the church is the rapture
[2:09:27] will have to be changed and caught up in
[2:09:30] the air to meet him we can't meet him on
[2:09:32] earth we've got to go in to the air to
[2:09:35] meet him it's the coming Sun the
[2:09:37] promised Sunday man we've looked for him
[2:09:38] now for hundreds of years
[2:09:40] he will come someday but the next thing

[2:10:53] [Music]
[2:10:54] it was germ warfare and a prophet tells
[2:10:57] us that only those that have the baptism
[2:10:59] of the Holy Ghost will be immune from
[2:11:03] germ warfare only those that's why you
[2:11:06] better make sure you got the token man

[2:12:04] on mama testimony you can't get in on
[2:12:06] daddy testimony you got to know Jesus
[2:12:09] for yourself all right I read this about
[2:12:15] Sarah Sarah Sarah Sarah in Genesis 21
[2:12:21] Bible say in verse 1 and the Lord
[2:12:23] visited Sara as he had sent and I'm just
[2:12:28] one that believes that we've come to a
[2:12:31] spot where God gonna visit his people as
[2:12:35] he say it you got to understand we got
[2:12:38] to move from it just being a promise to
[2:12:41] move to the place where becomes a
[2:12:43] manifestation they had been walking in a
[2:12:46] place where it's just a promise for
[2:12:47] years but God's Word just can't remain
[2:12:50] promises God's work must be manifested
[2:12:53] God don't speak things just what to be a
[2:12:56] promise that we can get excited we can
[2:12:58] we can we can rejoice over promise but
[2:13:01] I'm not just rejoicing over the promise
[2:13:03] I'll read just because this word will
[2:13:06] become material praise God brother
[2:13:09] branham say you know a man that I got
[2:13:11] faith in you know he don't have a loaf
[2:13:13] of bread but he got a quarter he said
[2:13:15] the reason a man can rejoice with that
[2:13:17] quarter is because he got the purchasing
[2:13:20] power
[2:13:22] no he don't have brag that he got the
[2:13:24] purchasing power that when he comes to
[2:13:26] the place where he can buy the bread he
[2:13:29] has what it takes to Amen exchange in a
[2:13:32] transaction
[2:13:34] a manner and then this word that God has
[2:13:37] given us it's everything we need for
[2:13:40] Bobby change but I'm not just waiting
[2:13:44] amen and just excited just because I got
[2:13:46] the promise I'm looking for Genesis 21
[2:13:49] experience where the promise action
[2:13:52] becomes a manifestation I believe we've
[2:13:55] moved into that year we're moving into
[2:13:58] that year where the promise is becoming
[2:14:00] a manifestation but I got a preach
[2:14:03] division and step into it watch this the
[2:14:07] Lord visited Lord visited God God is the
[2:14:10] one bringing his promise to pass the
[2:14:11] Lord visited Sara as he had said and the
[2:14:15] Lord did that thing the Lord did unto
[2:14:26] Sarah Abraham didn't have nothing to do
[2:14:30] with this the Lord did unto Sarah as he
[2:14:35] has spoken
[2:14:36] let's go home church I'm telling you
[2:14:39] Sarah doubt it she wasn't like mayor say
[2:14:41] be it unto me according to your word
[2:14:42] Sarah was was wrestling with unbelief
[2:14:45] sad me and my lord have present I mean
[2:14:48] she comes she couldn't she she couldn't
[2:14:50] get this thing but I love this amen
[2:14:52] there was some point in time where Sarah
[2:14:55] wept from laughing to believing I'm not
[2:15:04] we know God did not destroy Sarah
[2:15:06] because she was connected to Abraham but
[2:15:09] I'm telling you that Sarah had her own
[2:15:12] epiphany Sarah had her own revelation
[2:15:16] Sarah had her own understanding how can
[2:15:21] you say that brother Jack because the
[2:15:23] Bible said Hebrews 11:11
[2:15:27] can we read that now ain't that good
[2:15:30] Hebrews 11:11 that's double double
[2:15:41] this how we know Sarah had her own
[2:15:43] revelation some types at some point in
[2:15:47] time you're gonna come to your own
[2:15:48] revelation I'm speaking to Sarah's today
[2:15:51] amen
[2:15:52] through faith also Sara herself sera
[2:16:01] herself now Abraham didn't do this God
[2:16:06] not spoke to me himself so Sara herself
[2:16:09] received strength oh my god not just in
[2:16:14] her body but in her mind
[2:16:17] and what happened to her mom began to
[2:16:19] transform what was happening in her body
[2:16:21] you gonna have to receive strength in
[2:16:24] your spirit man please God something
[2:16:30] that's gonna cause you to rise up from
[2:16:32] where you are no you're not defeated no
[2:16:35] you're not some disobedient child you're
[2:16:38] a child of God you can tell the devil
[2:16:41] yeah I might have made some mistakes but
[2:16:43] I'm still here Sara laughed laughed at
[2:16:49] God's telling their laugh you ain't been
[2:16:52] that bad I hope you ain't been that bad
[2:16:54] but laugh why God was ten but still
[2:16:56] Scott still God manifested himself in
[2:16:58] our body I want to tell you something I
[2:17:01] don't care how bad off his bed for you
[2:17:03] in life the change still gonna take
[2:17:06] place
[2:17:07] you shall be changed changed in a moment
[2:17:11] in twinkle of an eye
[2:17:12] look at this look at this look at this
[2:17:14] through the Bible say through faith also
[2:17:17] Sara herself Sara herself received
[2:17:20] strength to conceive seed and was
[2:17:22] delivered of a child when she was past
[2:17:25] age ain't that just like God I got some
[2:17:28] things I want to just share with you all
[2:17:29] that's delight God she was past age
[2:17:31] because she judged him faithful who had
[2:17:34] promised so at some point in time Sara
[2:17:37] came to her own revelation and what I'm
[2:17:39] saying is that some point in time the
[2:17:40] church has got to come to his own
[2:17:42] revelation we got to recognize who we
[2:17:44] are
[2:17:44] I've told you brother Branham who he was
[2:17:46] he looked in the script and saw Malachi
[2:17:49] 4 and began to preach it now I want to
[2:17:53] taste how much I was talking with a
[2:17:54] brother yesterday you know we were just
[2:17:56] conversing around the word and say now
[2:17:58] now when you catch this when you catch
[2:18:02] this tribulation down set in it was only
[2:18:08] after the word was being formed in Mary
[2:18:11] that she began to go through persecution
[2:18:13] as long as you've just a virgin with no
[2:18:16] problem with not with no manifestation
[2:18:18] she there was a promise hanging over
[2:18:20] Mary but not a manifestation but when
[2:18:23] the manifestation took place persecution
[2:18:25] set in can I tell you persecution is
[2:18:28] coming as the manifestations start
[2:18:30] coming as crisis being formed in you
[2:18:34] watch the persecution said early in its
[2:18:39] just gonna produce the baby that's all
[2:18:41] don't run from it run to it a man you'd
[2:18:45] be stronger you be better praise God
[2:18:48] a Manny Manny man glory to God let me
[2:18:52] just finish reading this in Genesis 21
[2:18:55] verse 2 says in Sarah for Sarah
[2:18:58] conceived and bare Abraham a son in his
[2:19:00] old age at the set time of which God has
[2:19:04] spoken to him and Abraham called the
[2:19:06] name of his son that was born of him
[2:19:08] whom Sarah bear to him Isaac now I was
[2:19:11] just looking at this a man and you can
[2:19:14] just see just in reading these
[2:19:15] scriptures here God visiting Sarah the
[2:19:19] way he promised now
[2:19:20] God God used multiple ways to visit his
[2:19:24] people before Sarah had the change in
[2:19:29] her body God came down to talk with
[2:19:31] Abraham and stood there at the tent God
[2:19:33] and flesh in flesh talking to Sarah I
[2:19:37] mean talk at Abraham but Sarah overheard
[2:19:39] thinks God in flesh with two angels that
[2:19:41] was one visitation but when it was time
[2:19:43] for the manifestation of what God told
[2:19:46] Abraham he would do he says I'm gonna
[2:19:49] visit your wife Sarah at the time of
[2:19:51] life when it comes time for the
[2:19:52] manifestation he didn't come back in
[2:19:54] person there's a lot there cuz somebody
[2:20:04] feel looking for brother Brandon to come
[2:20:05] back no no no no he's done his part when
[2:20:10] the manifestation time came it was the
[2:20:12] spirit coming on the word and God made
[2:20:18] it come to pass and I'm here to tell you
[2:20:21] I'm just trusting God this is the time
[2:20:24] this is the season where the Spirit will
[2:20:27] connect with the word dynamics to the
[2:20:30] mechanics and cause this thing to come
[2:20:33] to pass all we got to do is just stay
[2:20:36] with it amen
[2:20:37] listen he's supernaturally touched Sarah
[2:20:40] so she could she could conceive her body
[2:20:44] had changed before she produced the son
[2:20:47] amen and we talked about there with
[2:20:48] Abimelech in other words she experienced
[2:20:51] the supernatural before she fulfilled
[2:20:53] her ultimate purpose of producing Isaac
[2:20:55] you know even after that Sarah produced
[2:20:57] Isaac she lived for a number of years
[2:20:59] but then she was she was taken off the
[2:21:01] scene our ultimate purpose is to produce
[2:21:03] Christ and I'm gonna tell you when we
[2:21:04] get there we're gonna be taken off the
[2:21:06] scene in a rapture hey man we might as
[2:21:10] well enjoy the other supernatural
[2:21:12] blessings of God before we are raptured
[2:21:15] Kucera enjoyed it too amen amen
[2:21:19] glory to God hallelujah so God visited
[2:21:22] in different ways initially came as a
[2:21:24] man and visited in but then he came back
[2:21:26] as spirits and visited them now look at
[2:21:29] this in order for them to produce this
[2:21:32] this justice son
[2:21:34] the promise had to be caught by faith
[2:21:36] and then believed and they did that it
[2:21:39] took 25 years but but the promise became
[2:21:42] a manifestation hallelujah hallelujah
[2:21:47] same thing with Mary it took hundreds of
[2:21:50] years before the promise became a
[2:21:52] manifestation but it became a
[2:21:54] manifestation it became a manifestation
[2:21:57] in Sarah it became a manifestation in
[2:22:00] Mary and I might as well tell you right
[2:22:02] now it will become a manifestation in
[2:22:08] you I declare by faith that this is
[2:22:15] another time of visitation I'm just the
[2:22:25] devil has just run roughshod and when
[2:22:28] the devil start moving he tried to get
[2:22:30] your mind off of what God is doing keep
[2:22:34] your mind on what God is doing amen
[2:22:37] I want to tell you something the devil
[2:22:39] is still alive the devil is still alive
[2:22:42] praise God all right let me just read a
[2:22:46] couple things and it will close right
[2:22:47] here a man this is going to come from
[2:22:52] the message the faith of Abraham the
[2:22:59] faith of Abraham
[2:23:01] since this why you're too old
[2:23:06] your wife's twenty years past menopause
[2:23:08] man so this is devil talking to Abraham
[2:23:11] I don't care if she's a hundred years
[2:23:14] past menopause that's where you got to
[2:23:16] talk back to the devil we're gonna have
[2:23:18] the baby how do you know God sent so
[2:23:21] that settles it God said so no matter
[2:23:25] how ridiculous it sounds if God said so
[2:23:30] alright God makes it ridiculous all
[2:23:33] faith is ridiculous to the unbeliever
[2:23:36] listen faith is only real to God and the
[2:23:41] one who has it
[2:23:42] unbelief don't stop God it don't bother
[2:23:45] God's plans it don't buy
[2:23:47] amen God's Word it don't hurt it it
[2:23:49] don't ruin them and only ruins the one
[2:23:52] and unbelief it only ruins the
[2:23:54] unbeliever amen
[2:23:56] not God see faith I mean doubt not not
[2:23:59] not ruling God God's promises will be
[2:24:01] fulfilled just exactly the same whether
[2:24:03] you believe it or not right you just
[2:24:05] beat your brains out trying to get away
[2:24:07] from it it don't stop God certainly not
[2:24:10] his promises has made his words that
[2:24:12] they're all the unbelief you can muster
[2:24:14] together won't stop it try to take your
[2:24:16] unbelief and stop the Sun from rising
[2:24:18] try to keep the rain from falling with
[2:24:21] your unbelief God will do it anyhow and
[2:24:24] if you can't stop the rain from falling
[2:24:26] if you can't stop the Sun from rising
[2:24:28] you can't stop this change from
[2:24:30] happening glory to God amen God will do
[2:24:34] it anyhow because it's in God's plan is
[2:24:37] God's program and he will heal every
[2:24:39] sick person that'll take his word for
[2:24:41] it's his program he said I'm the Lord
[2:24:44] heals all our diseases praise God I
[2:24:48] believe that a man this this last Pope
[2:24:51] that I want to read is there anything
[2:24:53] too hard for the Lord is there anything
[2:24:58] too hard for the Lord said Abraham
[2:25:05] where's your where's your wife Sarah a
[2:25:08] stranger never seen him before where's
[2:25:10] your wife Sarah how did he know that he
[2:25:12] had a wife and how did he know that her
[2:25:15] name was Sarah says she's in the tent
[2:25:16] behind you and when she laughed when
[2:25:19] Sarah laugh said why does she laugh he
[2:25:22] caught the sign he knew what it was
[2:25:24] Sarah didn't get it she even come forth
[2:25:27] and tried to deny it God would have
[2:25:30] destroyed her upon that if she hadn't
[2:25:33] been a part of Abraham and a lot of
[2:25:35] times our unbelief with destroy us if it
[2:25:38] wasn't for the blood of Jesus Christ God
[2:25:41] can't destroy us now because the blood
[2:25:45] of Jesus Christ keeps God off of us you
[2:25:50] want to know why you need the blood
[2:25:55] it's the blood that keep God off you he
[2:26:01] would have destroyed you a long time ago
[2:26:03] but blood has been covering you can I
[2:26:06] tell you something else even when you
[2:26:07] was in a world of sin the blood was
[2:26:10] covering you some of us was this close
[2:26:12] to death but we here this morning it's
[2:26:15] because the blood was covering us God
[2:26:22] can't destroy us now because the blood
[2:26:24] of Jesus Christ keeps God off of us we
[2:26:27] are part of Christ just as Sarah was a
[2:26:29] part of Abraham for we are the Bride of
[2:26:32] Christ and we people who's born of the
[2:26:34] Spirit of God ought to wake up get out
[2:26:37] of our stools and watch for the
[2:26:39] supernatural sign of the coming of the
[2:26:40] Lord Jesus his signs that he promised a
[2:26:44] man you know we go through things in
[2:26:47] life and my we thank God for the blood
[2:26:50] that covers us and keeps us and you know
[2:26:52] but I tell you we make some we sow some
[2:26:55] seeds and when you sow your seat you got
[2:27:00] to reap it there's not nobody else's job
[2:27:03] to reap that that's what you sow so you
[2:27:05] got to reap it you got to deal with your
[2:27:07] own stuff that you soaked but God I give
[2:27:10] you grace
[2:27:11] God will give you grace catch the vision
[2:27:15] Oh
[2:27:16] step into it let's pray father we thank
[2:27:22] you for your word Lord as we just try to
[2:27:27] process and really grasp what the angel
[2:27:29] is trying to say to us lord I pray you
[2:27:34] God would help us to see this enterprise
[2:27:37] above where we are God you've called us
[2:27:41] to more than that get so bogged down
[2:27:44] with the things of this life and Lord
[2:27:46] the things of this world God but I just
[2:27:49] pray that you would help us Lord Jesus
[2:27:51] to rise above that Jesus you warned us
[2:27:58] Lord you called us so that you could
[2:28:00] reproduce yourself in and through us
[2:28:03] that's what you did Lord we're yielding
[2:28:07] ourselves to you God that you might be
[2:28:09] able to make us copies make us Lord
[2:28:13] just like you God that that's our desire
[2:28:16] we really want to be that we don't want
[2:28:19] to just be church members and God just
[2:28:23] God just people that go to church pay
[2:28:25] tithes and offering and God that it's
[2:28:27] more to this Christian walk than that
[2:28:29] it's so much more help us to yield to
[2:28:32] you God Father we pray that you just a
[2:28:36] man don't let these words go over our
[2:28:38] heads as your prophet told us if
[2:28:40] revelations be on dust and to look up
[2:28:42] and ask you for it we pray that you
[2:28:45] would help us to catch this know God
[2:28:46] that we might be the fulfillment of your
[2:28:48] word the word was fulfilled in Sarah the
[2:28:52] word was fulfilled in Mary that same
[2:28:57] word must be an will be fulfilled in us
[2:29:02] unbelief won't stop God the devil
[2:29:05] himself can't stop God doubt can't stop
[2:29:09] God nothing can stop God if you've
[2:29:12] spoken it it must come to pass and we
[2:29:14] will be a super church a super race as
[2:29:19] we near you God and every year we're
[2:29:23] getting closer and closer and closer to
[2:29:26] your coming so god I pray let change

[2:29:33] that the thing this world would just
[2:29:35] begin to fall off we're so wrapped up in
[2:29:38] trying to please people in the world
[2:29:40] that we're not pleasing God's father
[2:29:43] help us to recognize that you're the
[2:29:45] only thing that matters no nobody else
[2:29:47] has a heaven our hell to put us in so
