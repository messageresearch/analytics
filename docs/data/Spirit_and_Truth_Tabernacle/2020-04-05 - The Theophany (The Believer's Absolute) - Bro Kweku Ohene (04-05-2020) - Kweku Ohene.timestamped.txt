[16:00] jeez really

[16:13] maybe
[16:15] [Music]
[16:18] in love for me
[16:24] [Music]
[16:32] is real I can
[16:36] and
[16:38] I saw
[16:42] [Music]
[16:45] the reason I chose this song is because
[16:47] everything that's going on all around us
[16:50] people need to know that God is real and
[16:54] you know everybody's running around
[16:56] scared and afraid but people need to
[16:59] know that God has it all in control and
[17:02] that every little thing he's mindful of
[17:06] and and they need to realize that you
[17:09] know when trouble surrounds you that you
[17:12] need to be able to look to something not
[17:15] to the government not to the medical
[17:18] science but look to something that's
[17:20] truly truly real because we know that
[17:23] the Bible tells us that heaven and earth
[17:26] will pass away but his word will always
[17:28] remain the same and those the government
[17:31] can can't take this away
[17:33] medical science can't take this away the
[17:36] only thing that can take this away is
[17:37] Jesus Christ
[17:40] [Music]
[17:44] yes God is real I can't
[17:50] [Music]
[17:52] No
[17:54] oh he's reeling my soul
[18:08] yes God is real
[18:11] [Music]
[18:15] me home
[18:19] his love for me
[18:26] it's like you go
[18:31] [Music]
[18:36] for I can't
[18:39] yes that is real or I can't be
[18:45] yes God is real or I can't be
[18:52] in my lord
[19:00] [Music]
[19:04] you believe that this morning have you

[26:06] of sacrifice
[26:08] if I shut up heaven that there be no
[26:12] rain or if I command the locusts to
[26:16] devour the land or if I see pestilence
[26:23] among my people so God can do that if
[26:26] you want to right it says if my people
[26:29] which are called by running
[26:32] so hover themselves and pray and seek my

[27:19] like that even coronavirus my bow before
[27:23] him he is a mighty God a man's a mighty
[27:27] God just a couple of things this morning
[27:30] we were blessed amen brother quake who's
[27:33] actually going to come at minister for
[27:35] us this morning
[27:36] now we looking forward to that but
[27:39] before he comes I just want to share a
[27:40] couple of things with is the first of
[27:42] the month a man we have our building
[27:46] fund report that I wanted to just give
[27:51] you really quickly here and there was a
[27:58] last month we actually received four
[28:04] thousand two hundred thirty thousand
[28:06] twenty three cent a man towards the
[28:09] building fund last month
[28:15] our objective they've managed to just
[28:18] kind of see our goal was to raise a
[28:20] hundred and five thousand dollars this
[28:22] year we have pledged sixty thousand nine
[28:27] dollars that's was played pledged and so
[28:30] far received a year today is nine
[28:33] thousand eight hundred and ninety two
[28:35] dollars and fourteen cents for that for
[28:37] this first three months nine thousand
[28:39] eight hundred and ninety two thousand
[28:41] fourteen cent and we have actually
[28:43] accumulated interest of two hundred
[28:45] fifty dollars and ninety seven cent
[28:47] which gives us a grand total of ten
[28:49] thousand one hundred fifty one dollars
[28:52] and 11 cents a man so that's what has
[28:55] been raised and we thank God for that
[29:01] and you know I tell you what God has
[29:06] been good in the midst of all of this
[29:08] that we are facing I have seen his
[29:11] mighty hand at work and continue to see
[29:14] his hand at work him we just want to say
[29:18] a word of Prayer I'm just thinking we
[29:19] have some Saints here in our church that
[29:21] are kind of like frontline people as
[29:25] they respond to this and it's just their
[29:28] job to go and and respond and they
[29:31] probably had a number of different
[29:32] things and we want to remember those
[29:34] Saints in prayer now we got a request
[29:37] from sister realized she has a friend of
[29:39] hers that's in
[29:40] New York and the she was responding and
[29:44] end up actually contracting this virus
[29:48] and I believe her whole entire household
[29:51] was actually impacted her children
[29:53] they're impacted as well so we want to
[29:56] take this serious and we want to pray I
[29:58] think her mom is also impacted so we
[30:01] want to pray for them that God would
[30:03] just make a way and just touch through
[30:05] their bodies we've been here tested most
[30:07] people that have been heal from this
[30:10] people that have been God has reversed
[30:12] it and now if he can do it for one he
[30:14] can do it for others a man so we want to
[30:18] do that and I want to thank you all for
[30:19] you know just kind of following some of
[30:22] the protocols that we put in place this
[30:24] is all for everybody's benefit and
[30:26] everybody's protection we don't want to
[30:29] take this lightly and you know just be
[30:31] negligent in some things so I just
[30:34] appreciate you all doing the social the
[30:36] social distancing it and the washing of
[30:38] the hands and sanitizing and all those
[30:40] things we really appreciate that so the
[30:43] Lord blessed you I had an opportunity I
[30:45] got a call from a church that told me
[30:48] that those Christ fellowship they said
[30:50] they were giving out things they had
[30:51] bags of groceries that they want to give
[30:53] out and asked me that I know anybody
[30:55] that that can use it so I I somebody had
[30:58] told me about it particularly the mass I
[31:00] said I remember that need and you know
[31:02] so I tried to you know get some things
[31:03] for them and if you all are running to
[31:06] many things where you have some these
[31:07] just get it to me there are people
[31:09] reaching up to me asking me if you need
[31:11] something please I will try to help out
[31:13] so just let me know and we'll try to do
[31:15] whatever we can but we were able to get
[31:17] some of those groceries and we gave it
[31:18] to some people in a community here next
[31:22] to us and there was a lady that was
[31:27] grateful for what we did and she sent a
[31:29] card here a man
[31:31] with appreciation she says pray that God
[31:35] will continue to bless you all and in
[31:41] all your endeavors in sharing and caring
[31:44] and blessing she says to past it up in a
[31:48] spiritual tabernacle members please
[31:49] accept my sincerest thank you for
[31:51] sharing a food bag from my neighbor and
[31:55] mobile industry the Cypress Lake so she
[31:59] was grateful for what we provided and
[32:01] you know it just just happy that we're
[32:03] able to touch somebody's life they went
[32:05] even during the time like this so we
[32:08] won't just remember her so let's just
[32:10] sub before brother Queen could come
[32:11] let's just have a photo but word of
[32:13] Prayer over some of our frontline Saints
[32:17] a man that are providing care at this
[32:19] time they don't just protect them during
[32:22] this season God would come before your
[32:23] presence believing that you are in
[32:28] control of everything that we see going
[32:30] on it they told us Lord that if your
[32:33] people which are called by your name and
[32:35] will humble themselves and pray seek
[32:38] your face turn from our wicked ways God
[32:42] you said you would hear from heaven and
[32:43] you would heal our land where doctors
[32:46] are not able to do it where nurses look
[32:48] not able to do it God where our
[32:52] government leaders are not able to do it
[32:54] we know our God is more than able to do
[32:58] this so father we want to pray for our
[33:01] frontline
[33:02] fathers those that are here even with
[33:05] our bit scoff ever having a face to put
[33:07] on a day-to-day basis whether it's in
[33:10] the hospital whether it's in people's
[33:11] homes
[33:12] God we pray for your divine protection
[33:14] Lord four-foot for these Saints that you
[33:17] would just be with them their other
[33:19] states Lord here in this area that also
[33:21] work as front-line responders God be
[33:24] with them and protect them protect their
[33:26] families Lord you said that this display
[33:30] would not come not our dwelling that's
[33:32] what you promised and what we just speak
[33:34] your word over each of them and acts
[33:36] that you would just be there their
[33:38] support God and that you would just
[33:40] carefully we also remember this young
[33:42] lady there in New York Lord that has
[33:43] contracted a virus and Lord her family
[33:46] that is going through even at this time
[33:49] God bring healing to that family I trust
[33:52] that you reverse what what the enemy has
[33:54] attacked with all she was doing was her
[33:57] job and God this in advance jumped on
[33:59] her so we've noted this is a demon that
[34:02] comes from hell and all sicknesses of
[34:05] the devil so Lord we just so we rebuke
[34:07] it down the name of Jesus they're
[34:09] probably just free as you told us in
[34:11] your word that what we are on earth
[34:13] shall be bound in heaven and what we
[34:15] loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
[34:16] so we come against it right now in the
[34:18] name of Jesus action to be a hedge
[34:19] around all your people and to it keep
[34:22] them through this time we give you all
[34:24] the glory we give you all the honor we
[34:26] give you all the praise as we prepare to
[34:28] hear the word of God to date from our
[34:29] precious brother quake who use of God in
[34:31] a special way bless the Lord that it
[34:33] will speak to our hearts and God that
[34:35] you would just get the glory out of all
[34:37] that happens here in this service of

[44:52] Garden of Eden but a lot through what
[44:54] you see you restore you and I back to I
[44:56] inherit ants amen

[45:09] yo-you I garden yourself if someone said
[45:12] are the Blessed a man who not who

[45:19] be like a tree of life because we a tree
[45:21] you a garden you are a plantain of the
[45:24] Lord just as we plant flowers and trees
[45:26] and vegetables and different things the
[45:29] Lord planted you on this earth for this
[45:31] very purpose amen
[45:33] so there's nothing out of Keita there's
[45:35] nothing beyond your control so brother
[45:37] I'm a human being we have a lot of
[45:39] limitation I don't even know how to go
[45:41] through my grocery I don't want to get
[45:43] in touch with people I don't want to
[45:44] shake hands with people yes I know that
[45:46] the human limitation but behind that
[45:50] within that there's another dimension
[45:53] there's a few funny there's a holy goose
[45:55] that's eternal life he's greater than
[45:58] all the demons which rather than Satan
[46:01] who is greater than all the negatives
[46:03] you can listen to around the world he's
[46:05] the one in you amen
[46:07] did I see you is rather than he does in
[46:09] the world blessed be the name of the
[46:11] Lord so fear is not your promise no your
[46:15] promise is eternal life
[46:17] what is the West in the West is I can't
[46:20] drop down and die physically it's just
[46:23] like taking my garment of me I'm still
[46:25] alive so if even this is taken out of me
[46:28] we could still be walking in the
[46:29] dimension glory hallelujah amen
[46:33] the westin that we draw from this flesh
[46:35] that's what everybody's care about from
[46:37] this is an element by you and I you
[46:40] existed before the foundation of the
[46:41] world
[46:42] you had another life in you that when
[46:44] this one drops there's someone who takes
[46:47] over this is too funny that's it's an
[46:49] alive there's Jesus Christ in you that
[46:51] life has no beginning and there's no end
[46:54] so we are not just ordinary people to be
[46:56] gripped with fear you are a son of God
[46:58] you are a daughter of God you are the
[47:00] one you are the hope for this world
[47:02] amen you are once you give your
[47:04] neighbors who that crisis alive
[47:06] amen so don't let the enemy the news
[47:09] media grip you of course we have to obey
[47:11] every loss or the land you have to take
[47:14] the precautions of and see Co
[47:17] CDC thank you we have to do everything
[47:20] necessary even taking this with just
[47:22] common sense to do that
[47:23] I for example when I go to grocery
[47:25] before this and I like to wash I'm not
[47:28] exactly but something like that a lot to
[47:30] watch everything I can't wash even
[47:32] bottles drinks juices I like to watch
[47:34] them I like to wash my hands so it's
[47:36] practical to do that amen and also to
[47:39] transfer 17 to our aquatic artist do the
[47:42] social distancing but behind addresses
[47:44] Petra type in that amen
[47:46] now this is a play that has caused the
[47:48] whole world to reach into the whole big
[47:51] machines machines
[47:53] powerful men
[47:54] powerful people influence everyone is
[47:58] hiding in his home everyone doesn't want
[48:00] to touch and talk to nobody people
[48:02] doesn't want to touch nobody why it is a
[48:05] home calling time amen
[48:07] the Lord is typing this one it's our
[48:09] home what is your home your home is not
[48:11] here yeah it's the home of this flesh
[48:14] but you have a home with you amen
[48:17] you are the clean feel funny room you
[48:19] have the kingdom of God within you that
[48:21] is the hook going time amen
[48:23] the smoking where the third who is your
[48:25] home amen and that is what the Lord is
[48:27] preparing us for when turn of Israel and
[48:30] Egypt this another Egypt going on
[48:33] sometimes they lost for four scriptures
[48:35] in a very simplified way when you really
[48:38] from history was thinking like oh there
[48:39] was like some mighty something going on
[48:42] but it was a simple form just like this
[48:44] there was an angel of death going around
[48:47] knocking down the firstborn of the
[48:49] Egyptians and there was the appeal of
[48:51] fire they agreed in China if I should
[48:53] put in a human form we stretch behind in
[48:56] front of every door boots of the
[48:57] believers they just go in this way
[48:59] there's no way the angel of that could
[49:01] even venture you could even try because
[49:03] he's the one in charge and all of them
[49:06] could go and plant editing do groceries
[49:08] like we did but you could go to their
[49:10] farm and get their food and animals and
[49:12] come back they are first ones didn't die
[49:14] because he that was within them it was
[49:17] written he that was in the world and now
[49:19] we have another Egyptian freak again
[49:21] caught coronavirus that has put big
[49:24] president little president big woman
[49:27] little woman everybody back to their
[49:29] home why the Lord is telling us that
[49:32] he's the one in control
[49:34] doesn't matter you are Russia you are a
[49:37] China
[49:38] you are the United States you agree
[49:39] Britain everybody is now quiet when Lion
[49:43] King blues piece everyone is quiet in my
[49:48] time my lifetime I've never seen when
[49:51] the Lord has got attention of people
[49:52] like this one globally people everyone
[49:56] knows that is God I don't believe that
[49:59] is God you know there's God you don't
[50:02] have to preach to them the poor now
[50:04] running helter-skelter seeking for
[50:06] refuge because death is close to the
[50:09] doorstep by you and I are the hope or no
[50:12] because we are better than them but you
[50:14] were ordained to be a salvation unto the
[50:17] world amen so let's just say go into the
[50:20] scriptures and just see what the Lord
[50:23] will have for us this morning

[50:58] do you have nothing to do with God they
[51:00] are using some 91 verse 1 and I mean the
[51:03] rule of some 91 but let's read 1 and 2
[51:05] some 91 verse 1 and 2 he that dwelleth
[51:09] in the secret place of the Most High
[51:10] shall abide under the shadow of the

[51:16] and my fortress my god in him will I
[51:18] trust amen

[51:48] foundation of the world that's what he
[51:49] carries genetics declares his name his
[51:52] blood and everything so don't separate
[51:54] yourself that oh I'm different his
[51:56] daughter cannot say that oh I'm

[51:59] yes that is a man is a preacher she has
[52:01] a attribute Soraka has a attribute by
[52:04] the apartheid is got the same genetics
[52:06] you have got the same holy goose that
[52:09] was in Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago the
[52:11] same Jesus Christ is living in you amen
[52:14] so he said he that dwelleth in the
[52:16] secret place of the Most High which is
[52:19] in 1087 dimension before I mean there
[52:22] was heaven
[52:22] you were dwelling in the seven dimension
[52:25] the mind of Elohim you a part of Elohim
[52:27] but you have to express yourself in a
[52:30] shadow form amen
[52:31] I don't know if I can see my shadow I
[52:33] don't see it now your shadow you can see
[52:36] it right oh thank you God bless you LEM
[52:38] come here
[52:39] yes I have a shadow now I have to be
[52:42] there for my shadow to be there without
[52:44] me there wouldn't be any shadow so this
[52:46] shadow is a projection of me when the
[52:49] Sun and the light and darkness divide
[52:51] from the shadow so this flesh is a
[52:54] projection of the feel funny
[52:56] amen so before you drop on this earth to
[52:59] even get to know coronavirus you had the
[53:02] original he that dwelleth in the secret
[53:04] place of the almighty of the moosa' and
[53:07] now you are dwelling under the shadow

[53:13] place can we be seated
[53:14] amen everything's I will going through
[53:19] is a shadow it's a playground
[53:21] amen of the reality of the true life
[53:24] form there's only one type of life that
[53:27] is eternal life there's only one form of
[53:28] eternal life that is Jesus Christ amen
[53:31] there's no two types of life there's
[53:34] only one form of life eternal life so
[53:36] what about the privation poverty means
[53:39] is trying to imitate the original but
[53:42] it's not original it just like the virus
[53:44] that before our skin bacteria James
[53:46] coronavirus is not a reject creation of
[53:49] God Guardian creed virus but is a
[53:52] demonic life-form
[53:53] and Israel they trying to manifest
[53:57] lightly with Jesus Christ manifest as a
[53:59] gem of life but they are not able so
[54:02] they bring death and please and disease
[54:05] and harm an infection of a mankind so
[54:09] the only life the truest life is Jesus
[54:12] Christ and that is who you are
[54:13] amen you are no different from Jesus
[54:16] Christ let's Rican a description of got

[54:40] Corinthians chapter five verse one and
[54:42] seven for we know that if our earthly
[54:47] houses of this Tabernacle were dissolved
[54:50] we have a high we have a burden of God
[54:52] and house not made with hands eternal in
[54:56] the heavens
[54:58] we're seven for we walk by faith not by
[55:01] sight
[55:02] amen for we know that if our earthly
[55:05] House of this Tabernacle were dissolved
[55:07] we have we already have a house not that
[55:11] you are going to have but you have it
[55:13] now
[55:14] amen and house not made with hands it's
[55:18] not a house your dad and your mom make
[55:19] it's not this house that we live in no
[55:21] but it's a real house in China in
[55:24] heavens China in the dimension amen
[55:27] decide in Heaven's heavens represent the
[55:30] seas dimension the space we are living
[55:32] in and the church the church is heaven
[55:34] as well so we have this eternal life in
[55:37] us that is the life that is the true you
[55:40] amen
[55:41] so we won't talk about few funny the
[55:44] absolute the believers absolute so let's
[55:46] give a little background about the
[55:47] wealthy funny if you go to the
[55:49] scriptures you never find anywhere slide
[55:50] too funny it's not even in the Bible but
[55:53] then it was injected into Christianity
[55:55] to explain the celestial body the word
[55:58] body so you came from two different
[56:00] weights few and funny few means the
[56:04] Oh God funny means made visible amen
[56:09] whew is invisible Elohim who was way in
[56:12] the heavens and nothing can approach him
[56:14] but any wanted to become visible on to
[56:17] mankind to come into a shadow form as we
[56:19] read in Psalm 91 he that dwelleth in the
[56:22] secret place of the Most High shall
[56:23] abide under the shadow of the Almighty
[56:25] he wanted to have a salacious second
[56:27] dimensional manifestation so he has to
[56:30] put here to protect himself from that
[56:32] seventh dimensional being into the six
[56:35] dimensional RAM which is recall heaven
[56:37] the believers position not in the future
[56:40] but now amen
[56:41] if you know your position you know that
[56:43] have got Christ in you you've got heaven
[56:45] in you you've got rapture in you you are
[56:48] resurrected already you have got
[56:50] everything that you need is right at you

[56:54] got eternal life you have got Redemption

[56:58] already I'm a bird by Jack which last
[57:00] last week he said is we are be even
[57:03] beyond faith it's not something I have
[57:06] to struggle I need to struggle to do it
[57:08] I haven't got that fit that I'm
[57:10] struggling no is what it's a clear
[57:12] statement of the Lord you don't have
[57:15] nothing to do with you just accept
[57:16] accepted just like Mary Mary it was
[57:19] prophesied Mary was just working and he
[57:21] behold he met a man is that our highly
[57:23] favored before God okay I cannot take
[57:25] that and feel it praise God Alleluia
[57:27] but any good have a son what have a son
[57:30] how what I talking about I'm just only
[57:33] engage have a son say well how having
[57:37] only a man so how do I have a son is
[57:39] that a son that is not going to be new
[57:40] in man is good by the spoken word of God
[57:42] that's what I'm doing to you and say
[57:44] yeah let it be according to your word so
[57:47] you have to even fight it she ought to
[57:49] just believe it because they declare
[57:51] statement of the Lord you don't have to
[57:53] struggle you don't have to I mean we
[57:56] products which are distension we do all
[57:58] this sin but to be frank with you it is
[58:00] not a deceiving you
[58:03] people can be in the house didn't go
[58:06] nowhere
[58:06] nobody contacted they just got sick who
[58:11] has the best protection that priests

[58:17] better than doctors that are taking
[58:18] co-princes is your health advice is
[58:22] better than his health advices do you
[58:24] have the best doctors like and the wife
[58:26] of Edward Everett can a Canadian
[58:29] president what's his name - do we have
[58:33] the best health care light reduce wife
[58:34] but he was she was tested positive it
[58:38] doesn't mean they're bad people it
[58:39] doesn't mean to put up a test positive I
[58:41] can test positive
[58:42] I can die but I'm using the word of God
[58:45] to explain something to you to let you
[58:46] know who you are
[58:47] Amen that even in the mists of all the
[58:50] best when the best aid the trans team
[58:54] medical team is that one of the news I
[58:56] was watching said I'll be frank with you
[58:57] I don't even know what is gonna happen
[58:58] tomorrow we're just trying to do so that
[59:02] we can bring down the cliff down if rid
[59:05] of infection and they're free down but I
[59:07] cannot tell you what more is gonna be
[59:09] it's beyond human control is something
[59:13] in the air amen
[59:14] there are four forces for element a lot
[59:16] uses the earth water fire and air that
[59:22] is a natural element but now there's a
[59:24] supernatural aspect of that the air is
[59:26] not just the wind that they're blowing
[59:28] the air type the spirit the fire is the
[59:31] force of cleansing the earth is people
[59:35] water is people so the Lord is using his
[59:39] fire of cleansing there's a spirit in
[59:41] the in the spiritual realm that you
[59:44] cannot see physically but it was strike
[59:46] you just like the Holy Ghost strike you
[59:49] and before realized right in another
[59:50] world so Who am I my goodness I'm seen
[59:54] angels I'm see the supernatural my
[59:57] dreams have changed I'm a new person
[59:59] why because life has tricking you but on
[1:00:03] that on the on the flip side there's
[1:00:06] death going around striking people
[1:00:08] because mankind will not accept his
[1:00:11] creator mankind will not
[1:00:15] to connect his creator when Indians when
[1:00:18] you go to the Indian tribe in the olden
[1:00:20] days when a child is born they don't
[1:00:22] train a child for us to speak the
[1:00:24] training phase to be silent and design
[1:00:27] around because they had tribe our
[1:00:30] enemies
[1:00:31] this tribe want to concatenate because
[1:00:33] there's water here this I have what you
[1:00:36] call it grass for animals and stuff like
[1:00:38] that there's a lot of corn here so tribe
[1:00:40] won't move from the microphone please
[1:00:42] please so if we see this attribute he
[1:00:44] can kill them fight
[1:00:45] so they trained a child how to design
[1:00:47] from your heart listen quietly do you
[1:00:51] hear noise around listen from your heart
[1:00:53] so India's I wanna preach or naturally
[1:00:55] speaking spiritual people I think was it
[1:00:58] John Wesley he came to in his time he
[1:00:59] came to a United State here Georgie and
[1:01:02] part of the sudden police and Italy
[1:01:04] Indian camps he said after he pretty
[1:01:06] said oh who converted me because he had
[1:01:09] things from the Indians spirit returned
[1:01:11] from the Indians who didn't read Bible
[1:01:13] because they were connected to create to
[1:01:15] the Great Creator the Griz spirit and
[1:01:18] that is what God want us to do not just
[1:01:21] their forms of church but you be
[1:01:24] connected to him now he's living in you
[1:01:26] if you have been accepted with the new
[1:01:28] after accept impressed you have to open
[1:01:30] your heart unto Him Lord have me all
[1:01:32] amen but if you have accepted him now
[1:01:35] you have to open your ears yo spectra is
[1:01:38] and hear him speak to your voice
[1:01:40] comforting words to you that be not
[1:01:43] afraid
[1:01:44] be not afraid because I'm the one in
[1:01:48] control is not a demon of coronavirus no
[1:01:51] it's Jesus Christ come true the spirit
[1:01:54] of death is just fulfilling a part of
[1:01:56] the Word of God and when there was a
[1:01:59] time that I had to die the Lord called
[1:02:03] who do this for me and a Bible say there
[1:02:05] was a demon of life is there Lord send
[1:02:08] me I'll go it wasn't Michael it wasn't
[1:02:10] gay bro it wasn't well mood but it was a
[1:02:13] demon he said how I could go Israel be a
[1:02:15] lying spirit in the false prophet and of
[1:02:18] course funny prophet they were possessed
[1:02:20] and they professor lies on to a hub and
[1:02:24] it happened Isabel died
[1:02:25] it wasn't that the Lord wasn't even true
[1:02:28] the Lord was in control
[1:02:29] amen so before the demon of death came
[1:02:32] on earth wherever I began in China or
[1:02:35] whatever that demon has to get
[1:02:37] permission from Christ
[1:02:42] yes I'll do that I'll just bring a
[1:02:46] little demon on earth
[1:02:48] Karuna means crowning spanish wait
[1:02:51] it's a crowning he's putting everybody
[1:02:54] home if you look at it we are being
[1:02:56] crowned this is a time of crowning
[1:02:58] because we've got a crown in your heart
[1:03:00] not a physical ground away but you've
[1:03:02] got a penis so that's happening you that
[1:03:05] is your crown because Christ is the king
[1:03:08] of the sins they live in you you are his
[1:03:11] queen you iook in it doesn't matter
[1:03:13] whatever a female or male in Christ

[1:03:32] what the power God want us to do he want
[1:03:34] us to avail a cornet just like the
[1:03:35] Indian train dear children connect to
[1:03:37] the one in you he that is in you Jesus
[1:03:39] was a human being and represent him I
[1:03:41] mean you could cry he died
[1:03:43] have you seen God Elohim died no in the
[1:03:46] human form it could die you could get
[1:03:48] sick he could get sorrowful he wept
[1:03:51] he was depressed he slept he was born he
[1:03:55] had fever just like human being but
[1:03:58] within him was another person that he
[1:04:01] can put a human form to displease and
[1:04:02] then they feel funny they turn up in can
[1:04:05] take place and do things needed to do
[1:04:07] there was a time they wanted to kill him
[1:04:08] when he said that before Abraham I am
[1:04:11] and say you are not even 50 years old

[1:26:06] before there was a star before there was
[1:26:08] anything this great fountain going forth
[1:26:10] of spirit and out of this fountain came
[1:26:13] the most pure most pure of laughs cause
[1:26:16] there was nothing for it to come from
[1:26:18] but laughs now we have now we what we
[1:26:23] call laughs today is a perverted laugh

[1:52:04] the Lord put up on the pastor's hat the
[1:52:07] preachers had to speak but I've got a
[1:52:09] daughter she's running through this
[1:52:10] problem that ever was battling her with
[1:52:12] fear with sickness she's got a little
[1:52:14] sore throat and Haitians are running
[1:52:17] wild and you speak a word that was
[1:52:20] through your heart knowing that all is
[1:52:22] well amen
[1:52:24] because where it had not been amen
[1:52:26] blessed be the name of the Lord glory
[1:52:29] hallelujah to the Lord you are
[1:52:31] Atena amen always put that one in your
[1:52:35] heart that the dimension is right here
[1:52:37] heaven is right here so it's the sins
[1:52:40] are here only there's a little veil and
[1:52:43] as we keep progressing the gospel the
[1:52:46] Lord is breaking the veil is becoming
[1:52:48] more clearer and clearer and clearer
[1:52:51] so don't depend don't let your life
[1:52:52] depend upon institutions of mankind what
[1:52:55] do I mean don't depend upon first times
[1:52:58] are great jobs are good we do that
[1:53:01] business are great economics are great
[1:53:03] just name them shops are great Amazon is
[1:53:06] awesome we use them everyone just named
[1:53:09] them iPhones whatever named em vehicles
[1:53:12] they are great but they are not Atena
[1:53:15] those systems are man-made and if Corona
[1:53:18] can shatter them just a little demon a
[1:53:21] lot of virus can shatter all the system
[1:53:23] the last time I had a news they would
[1:53:25] say that 10 million be part of a out of
[1:53:27] job they are going on they applying for
[1:53:29] F what benefit 10 million and then
[1:53:32] Emma's going to skyrocket
[1:53:34] so and now they want us to to to what
[1:53:38] you call it to add social distancing and
[1:53:40] as I was watching the TV not if you have
[1:53:43] an award from Internet I don't have to
[1:53:45] be in my house so let me explain it
[1:53:46] better
[1:53:47] i watch everything from here i can go to
[1:53:49] youtube and watch can go to our phone
[1:53:51] our own SOT I know I don't have time
[1:53:53] when I was a kid god I don't know why I
[1:53:56] will be deviating my niche I don't like
[1:53:58] things that are very peaceful person as
[1:54:00] my nature that's with a lot made me so I
[1:54:03] don't like movies that someone in my
[1:54:05] nature when I was a kid I remember the
[1:54:07] Musa Allah Oliver Twist something sintra
[1:54:10] simple she's PA I don't like those what
[1:54:13] that will run my mind world so I was
[1:54:16] watching the new CNN or some way and
[1:54:17] what was I lost my thoughts I was
[1:54:20] talking about oh people a demo people
[1:54:24] data on going sucia distance not what I
[1:54:27] planned for a benefit and now they've
[1:54:29] got their mask alright but India in
[1:54:31] touch with each other in front of the
[1:54:33] benefit office multitude of people look
[1:54:36] at human institutions we are supposed
[1:54:37] products which are distancing but now
[1:54:39] people won't benefit so now they are
[1:54:41] close to each other I mean just right
[1:54:44] into each other so what the switch are
[1:54:46] distancing institutions of man who feel
[1:54:49] if you put your trust in them in America
[1:54:53] in whatever nation is going to fail you
[1:54:55] but not a lot is called everybody home
[1:54:59] from within you it's not just the house
[1:55:03] but home go in what 10 in what yourself
[1:55:06] the lot is not doing away with a micro
[1:55:09] macro is going to mock my crew is going
[1:55:12] a man you'd from the he that is in you
[1:55:14] the fearfully the Holy Ghost in you he's
[1:55:17] going to work for you he's going to
[1:55:19] speak footing on your table when your
[1:55:21] resources are depleted don't run wild

[1:55:35] there's money in front of my door pick
[1:55:36] it I need a $20.00 applicate
[1:55:40] I run into money sometimes they just the
[1:55:46] Lord can do whatever he needs to do for
