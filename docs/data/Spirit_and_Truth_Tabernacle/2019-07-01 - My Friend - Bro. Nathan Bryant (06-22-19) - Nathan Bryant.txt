just learned this week that these services were put together and I was writing we were riding in a car on our way here and I started kind of just thinking about some of the sermons that my grandfather is preached and on faith and only believing and I had remembered a time where he said there's a difference between believing and only believing believing still leaves room for doubt all right but when you only believe there's no space for doubt you only believe and so tonight you know we were just trusting God my wife and I we've been believing the Lord and I've kind of shared just a little bit we've just been believing the Lord to bless us with a child and you know we we don't know what God has in store for us but we're only believing and we've turned it over to the Lord and we're just trusting him amen so I just hope that this would encourage somebody tonight so can I get a sheet sauces you don't have to worry then don't you be afraid joy comes in the morning troubles may don't

everyone being here tonight and a man good to have for the West gourd sister West [Music] and get some the Saints from the other churches for the genes churches see is represented and we think are for that they made also some other sister daily [Music] man here tonight and a good to have their man fellows shitman I believe my brother Wesker told me this was a brother Solomon he made us a pastor there in Ghana man was righteous wife so good they had to war with this some few years ago we had a service here on a Saturday night like this and brother Nathan came and he prayed for the sick that night and and there were many positive things that came forth from those services reminded of one particular relative we had here it was his first time coming to church was that night and then he was going through situations blind in both of his eyes and on his first time here he came that was pray for his sister inviting the comedy came and I prayed for him and they come back a few weeks later set up past to God restore him sign in with her - and he's been faithful to church ever since that time big man and we just thank God for them a male in there was a gentleman that had come and he was bringing a relative of his here to the service that night he was from Washington DC and he was just passing through just visiting didn't know anything about the service and he walked in on that night bringing this kind of bringing his cousin I believe in and said I want to be pray for two and you know and he was prayed for and about a few months later he was back down visit his cousin we were at the hospital together they said pastor I need to talk to you they pulled me outside the night and the hallway they said you know that night I came to churches my first time coming and he says I got an afraid line to be prayed for it says I had a cyst that was right here you know on my hand and you know we didn't know really what was gonna you know what we were gonna do but it was there on my hand I remembered that he said but I got prayed for after that prayer lamb the cysts was gone and here he was just passing through just you know not knowing anything about our church and and he come back to testify that God touched his body and we're witnesses that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and also you know the Lord just kind of put it on my heart to do this and a few years ago we went to brother Nathan's Church and a precious sister 15 man's and sometime yet she had she had been prayed for once before for the Nathan was here and she had a issue where she couldn't move she couldn't rotate the shoulders she couldn't move it and my brother Nathan was pretty for that night say that same night that she was grateful she went home and she pulled out the iron and she was ironing the way and she said you see notice that hey my son my shoulders moving in ways that it wasn't moving before and God did it in one night one night so you know she she had she had faith to say you know what I got another situation and I'm facing you know she developed a growth you know in her in her scalp and the doctor told her that it was cancerous that this was a cancerous growth and and said you know we're gonna have to remove that and you know she was just standing in faith believing God that you know something would happen and we that we went out there to Jeffersonville and we had meetings there and brother Nathan's Church the Church of the open door there in Sellersburg area and and as we were as we were there having service just say you know what before I go back home I want you all to pray for me you know just just pray for Mesa garden God heard your prayer once before and I believe he'll hear it again so just pray for me before I go back home and at the end of the last service you know he called her up to be prayed for you know she came up and I believe my mom came up as well and and mom had been going through something where she was having cramps you know in her legs and she had a very hard time sleeping but that night that she was prayed for she had one of the best sleeping nights that she could and and you know God touched her in her body and she were coming back home the next day and so sister Tonya told the doctor before she left you said you know I'm getting ready to go to some meetings in Indiana just say the doctor said we're gonna have to do surgery on that now said well before you do surgery let me just go to the meetings and and you know let's just you know after I get back then we'll do the surgery you know after I get back the doctor said okay that's fine you do all this weekend to the meetings so she went and she got prayed for the internet last service and when she was prayed for she came back home maybe she went through Monday we flew back home and I think Tuesday was the day that she was supposed to go and have this surgery and she woke up that morning and she pulled out her comb and she began to part her hair to look for this growth that was there cancerous growth that was there and was she part of the hair the growth was gone the cancer gone just like that absolutely go so you don't know when it fell off all she knows that it fell off between prayer and going back to the doctor and you know just pull that up for me if you can this just kind of shows where the cancer was you'll just hit that light switch there for me [Music] it shows this is where the growth was a man in this area it was cancerous but this was before prayer and this was after prayer a man just God give us evidence that he's the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah [Music] you know we think the Lord and you know when we were me experience things like this it's hard for us to doubt no matter how difficult the situation is they meant how impossible it may seem our God is the God that specializes in impossibilities a man I was listening to quote just a few days ago and the Prophet was referring to the healing of congressman congressman Upshaw I believe the man was in a wheelchair for 50 or 60 years and that 86 years old the man was made home he got up out of a wheelchair and what the Prophet says they say God it doesn't matter there's no age limit when it comes to healing no age limit you know you get 86 years old and you go to the doctor they'll actually tell you now you have to expect some things when you get this aged hallelujah but as a Christian you know what you can expect some things you can expect God to heal you hallelujah amen whether it was a baby or whether it was a ninety-year-old you can expect healing from an Almighty God he sets no age limits when it comes to healing the honors faith and tonight we're coming a man with our faith amen under with an expectation that whatever it is that you're facing here tonight God is able to heal it and we've acts you know what we want to initially do is try to get those to have a very serious case very difficult case a man may be something that the doctors have given up on but we want to invite you after the Word of God has preached to you tonight and maybe we'll have a prayer line and we want to pray especially for the sick our God is real our God is able to he's still a healer he never stopped healing they may still heal he's still in the healing business so we want to invite you to come for prayer and you know and after a man we've kind of gone through some of the hard cases then we may open the floor up for others that might be standing a gap for somebody else you know but we just want the Spirit of Lord just to lead our precious brother as as God will and we just want him to have his liberty as he comes here tonight amen to preach the gospel and the pray for the sick pray for him that God would strengthen him they meant tonight there's other testimonies that he would probably share but these the ones that we know that happened right here one other that night that we had that service my wife had an uncle if I had to be honest amen as he was walking into the church and days and months before it seemed like he was walking death if I had to be honest he was he look like he was going out he was going down we invited him to the service to come and be prayed for he couldn't Drive his appetite was was very I mean had a very low note really almost no appetite at all wasn't eating well and just you know just really going through a lot in his body and we invited him to come to that service he came and he got prayed for and that night he hadn't been driving for four months for a good while but that night he got in the car and left service and he said I'm gonna drive home and he drove home 45 minutes first time he had driven you know in a while and he made it home no problems next day got up kept driving the next day kept driving his appetite came back he started eating and if you saw the man today you never know that was the same man that came to be prayed for [Music] we've seen him do it before we know what he's able to do hallelujah somebody Amen so tonight Amen you've been invited to come hear me pray for and it was so glad that you came I was talking with a man recently and we were inviting him inviting him to come tonight and and he he was he say so in order to be prayed for we got it we got to come to the church I say yeah yeah yeah that's that's that's said to be brief uh come to the church so he says he say well that's guys gonna be hard so I told them I said you know the condition that you have if the doctor would have called you right now and say I got a new pill that just came out and this will handle everything that you're going through it'll take care of everything if if you just get to my office and get the pill say I guarantee you get in your car and get to the office to get that pill so if you do that for the doctor you got to do the same thing for God hey man he ain't got a pill he just lay hands on you hallelujah lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that's that's what he said in his work so we're not the only pill we give about us Gospels but you gotta have the same confidence in God that you have in a man God meets you here tonight if you just believe the Stentor feet let's welcome my brother Nathan Brian from Jeffersonville Indiana to the pulpit tonight as he comes let's just be praying for him that God would use him in a very special way God wants to speak to our heart hallelujah during his words and then from there we'll pray for the sea if you're not a Christian tonight we're asking it to its surrender your heart to the Lord Jesus before you would come to be praying for the sing this song [Music] maybe everybody [Music] me everybody's singing see [Music] let's see it this way deny oh Jesus [Music] he promised he would be [Music] he said wherever two or three are gathered in my name I'll be in their midst [Music] she [Music] and all possum for Jesus [Music] is [Music] it means they play that softly let's just bow our heads together this evening dear Heavenly Father Lord we just welcome your presence in our midst while we recognize it in ourselves Lord there's nothing that we can do or say there would be of eternal value but Lord we believe that if you'll come on the scene or the lives can be changed so Lord we welcome you Lord we believe you're here you promised you would be said you never leave us nor forsake us or we just thank you for your presence that we feel here already Lord we just ask that you be with us anoint me help me to get myself out of the way so you can speak something we would encourage hearts tonight Lord and we just submit the entire service into your hands for your glory father the name of the Lord Jesus Christ god bless you richly good to be here with you again this evening West Palm Beach Thank You musicians I'm not going to try anything else good to have my oldest son Phillip with me traveling with me to Florida this time and and my wife and other two children send their greetings and just wanted to make mention who was the the brother that's saying with Jesus I can make it with brother I heard you saying that you and your wife is or wanting a child and have been having we had a sister I guess it's been about a year ago her and her husband had been trying for seven years to have a child and at the end of his service we'd actually had a baptismal service and at the end of the service brother Billy Paul was there and I know that he had prayed for several and and and that had been in situations like that and they'd had children from that prayer and we also had a sister there that was her blood sister that had had a child but had a lot of birth defects and things and had passed away just a few days old and so I had asked for the Billy Paul to come up and pray for that sister that couldn't have children is interested in the way it worked out and asked him to pray for her and her and her sister both came up and so he laid his hands on on the sister that couldn't have children I prayed with him for her and then he kind of stepped back and I prayed for the sister that had had the child that that had died and and she was wanting another child and everything to be okay and and both of those sisters I had the honor and privilege last couple months to dedicate both of their children amen so we know that God's more than able raised the Lord for whatever you have need of tonight we believe that Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ is still the same today that he was yesterday so if we can look into the Bible we can read the things that Jesus did yesterday and find out that he was able to heal the sick and raise the dead and open the eyes of the blind and the deaf ears and all that he did deliver the demon oppressed if he was able to do that back then then he's able to do it again tonight or there's something wrong with Hebrews 13 and eight but but we believe that it's right we see the evidence of it I know brother Jack shared with you many of the testimonies and things that that happened the last meeting I don't want to keep you standing too long but I just want to share two other quick testimonies with you we had a sister a brother and a sister that one of my Deacon brothers and his wife they had a little girl and and she's just a little bit younger than my little boy and that's here with me tonight and and she has scoliosis and was two inches shorter than she should have been the x-rays showed her spine looked about like that just crooked and so they brought her up for prayer and we prayed for and about a year later the the doctor took another x-ray and it looked like that so we know God is able [Applause] where the random tells us many times none of us have the symptoms that Jonah had there's none of us here tonight that has quite as bad as symptoms as he had in the belly of the whale three days and three nights she may have had symptoms tonight but you're not in the condition that Jonah was and God brought him through so we know that I was able to bring ether as well and then when I was in in Finland a couple years ago I think you all were there September in New Albany at the church when sister Tanya was healed of the cancer and then that very next month in October I flew to Finland and I was in a prayer line there and had this same Bible in the same prayer cloth that I've got in this Bible and there was a sister that came up and she told me that she'd had chronic ear pain for 23 years what she didn't tell me was that she had thyroid problems for 24 years as well I took that prayer cloth and laid it on her ear and prayed for her and when I did she told me after the service through an interpreter since she felt a hot sensation starting her thyroid gland and it went up through the top of her head and when it passed by her ear the pain left instantly amen [Applause] hallelujah that doesn't make me anything but that makes him everything amen the same God that healed the people that you've heard the testimonies about tonight he's still here tonight he cares about you just the same as he does them his word is just the same for you if you'll accept it the way that they did Amen you get the same results let's turn to proverbs chapter 18 and verse 24 and just want to read one verse there tonight and then you can be seated after that proverbs chapter 18 verse 24 might seem like a very odd scripture to read for a prayer line service but maybe you understand a little bit shortly here's why I chose this first proverbs chapter 18 verse 20 for a man that hath friends must show himself friendly and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother Amen god bless she can be seated tonight I had been preaching at the church a few months ago and and had had kind of just before this service on actually right on my way out the door to the service I just wrote down one word and and from that one word I at the end of the service I begin to talk about a story that I want to share with you tonight and in doing that kind of went down this line of thought and when brother Jack invited me to come and and have a prayer line here and we're going to try and I don't make any promises but we're gonna try to keep the service a little shorter tonight so that we can go into the prayer line without keeping you too late but when he invited invited me I thought that I would share this with you and I just want to look just briefly at this thought of my friend and then I want to read you some quotes and scriptures in the lines of healing and what God does for the healing of the body some things I believe will will lift our faith by you just pray for me tonight it's a little bit different you know just coming out and preaching the word is one thing but but when you're praying for the sick and the needy and there's there's things in their lives that that they're obviously here for a reason that maybe maybe many severe needs it's just a little bit different atmosphere so we want the Lord to come and have his way but I want to tell you just a little story about a man that if there was anybody in all of history from the beginning of time until now if there was anybody that had a right I feel to be able in the natural to say that that Jesus waited too long that God was too late that it was this man and and this man had a friend and their friendship I would say was probably one of the strangest friendships that we could ever look at in all of history they had known each other since they were little children and but yet their their friendship would be different than any friend that she would have in the trope that you could compare it to this little boy they would grow up and they would have sleepovers together and this young man began to recognize very early on that there was something different about his friend than anybody else that he knew yet even when they were little boys he began to recognize there was something different about this friend from everybody else that he knew and as twelve-year-old children they would travel to a religious ceremony and on their way back home this little boy's parents would come and find him and I very frantically asked him have you seen your friend and you know I haven't seen him and they rushed around to all the other parents and the different people there and they caravan with him have you seen this little boy's friend now we haven't seen him and so the no doubt is they begin to travel back and very concern trying to find him they go back to where this religious ceremony was held and they find this little twelve-year-old boy and he's not he wasn't playing video games and he wasn't out you know just throwing rocks at people's windows with his other friends and things but they find him and he's sitting there talking to some rabbis probably in their 80s that knew the Scriptures very well and and they like a lot of theologians were probably sitting there and debating scriptures and one said well this is how I see it because Moses wrote it over here in Levitical law this is what I leaned to another one said well I can't reconcile that with numbers over here and so I leaned it I leaned a little bit more this way and they were debating their doctrinal differences and arguing and fussing and and one said well rabbi Levinsky teaches it this way and other ones said well I don't care this is what my daddy taught me and a little twelve-year-old boy standing over there very respectfully you may be raises his hand they said what what do you want son you need prayer something said no here's what what the the thing that ties these two scriptures is if you go over here to Deuteronomy it'll tie your question to Leviticus over here to your question of numbers and it'll come out just perfectly and they sat there dumbfounded a little 12 year old boy begin to explain the scriptures tune and as this this young man walks up maybe he came back with Mary and Joseph there to find his friend and he's amazed that his friend is able to teach the rabbis as they would grow up and they would become young men he could recognize that even in his teenage years he could recognize there's something different about his friend than the other friends that he would associate with you know maybe some of his other friends were a bad influence on him and they were always trying to get him to do something and it was odd to him to see this friend because the one little friend he is seemingly he could be tempted just right along with him like all of his other friends but when it actually got up to the point of an action to do something that was wrong he would always make the right choice now the you know the little boy he would try to make the right choice and sometimes he would and sometimes he wouldn't but his other friend he always made the right choice and so he grew up and he didn't understand exactly how this could be and what the difference was but he knew there was something different we find that as time goes on they begin to be young men they go down to the river one day brother band said they went arm and arm down to the Jordan together and here Jesus comes walking down with his friend and John the Baptist's are standing out there in the water baptizing people and they walk out there to the Jordan River and his friend walks out there into the water and John says behold the lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world is the little boy looks all around now he's a young man and he doesn't see anybody out there but his friend brother Jack the Lamb of God that's gonna take away the sins of the road that's my friend I grew up with him I used to have sleepovers at his house in Nazareth he came from the worst city in all of Galilee and here John stands out there and says the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world and this young man faints the prophet of God tells us he would he would be sitting there in Cana of Galilee and his friend would be there as well and his friend's mother and his sitting there you know maybe just often a corner humbly not making a big scene but as his friend's mother comes running in frantically wringing her hands and and since all there's a problem at the wedding there's a there's a problem they've ran out of line and she says look whatever whatever his friend tells you to do do it it might seem crazy it might seem ridiculous there was something about it this this man she recognized you know raising Jesus he had recognized something in his life there's no other recorded miracles in the scripture that he did as a child or a teenager not that's recorded in the scriptures but she must have recognized something in his life because there was a problem at the wedding and she didn't take him to Kay Ephesus and she didn't take him to the bank and she didn't take him to the lawyer and she didn't take him to some spiritual person in the family she took him to Jesus if we would do that when we had problems we'd be a lot better off oh there's all there's a problem there's an issue I'll run and I'll get a loan or I'll run to the lawyer I'll run to some spiritual person I'll run to some personality in the message do what Mary did take it to Jesus take it to Jesus she said whatever he says do it now sometimes we come into church and we want to be very proper and and all my if he asked me to raise my hand I'll do that and if he asked me to sing a special I guess I'll do that and if he asked me to dismiss in prayer I'll do that as long as they don't make me come up front and and you know we limit God if we're not careful I had just heard our church - a while back she said brother Nathan you would never make us do it Jericho March Woods yes I said well I don't think I've ever made anybody do anything except maybe my children you know made them take out the trash or something like that I've never really made anybody do anything in church he said well if you had a student Jericho Mart she said I just don't think I would do it I don't I don't think I could ever do that and so we were having a service there a few weeks later or maybe a few months later and the Holy Spirit was just falling in the service and my just wave upon wave the Holy Spirit coming into service all of a sudden I see this sister stand up brother Jack and there she goes around the church and she makes it all the way around she stops right in the middle of the aisle she walks back and forth the few times and here she goes again don't tell God that she won't do something Amen if you really don't want to do it then don't tell God I'll never do it or he may just make you do it brother Brandon said he was standing there and in its own tabernacle there and and he said he began to watch as a woman preacher came into the sanctuary and they got up to sing a special and he said he thought if the thing it had four decks she could have played all four decks on the piano there and he said she began to play and one of the little sisters from her church got out there and began to dance and the spirit he said there i sat in the seat of the scornful oh that's the problem we have a lot of times the church has too many people come and instead of sitting in the shouting seed or the rejoicing seed or the thankful seat they want to sit in the seat of the scornful sister so and so she I see her raising her hand and amen and over there but I know what she did last month and oh there's brother so-and-so and he claims to be such-and-such now but I remember what it used to be and if we're not careful we sit in the seat of the scornful oh man I want to send them in the seat of the worshipper hey man when I want to come to church now if I'm gonna sit in the seat lord let me just worship you you know we've seen when we all get to heaven we all get excited but when it comes to things that we're actually going to do in heaven many times when we come to church we sit there like a bump on a log and my get the heaven I brother Westcott want to run down to his feet and I wanna hold on to those precious feet that took my nails for me and I just want to lay there in worship hey man but why is it so hard when we come to church I saw a bumper sticker one time said you wanted to say you want to go to heaven but she won't go to church said well how would you enjoy going to heaven if you don't enjoy the church all the things we do here we're gonna be singing and shouting praising his name and worshiping somebody that don't like to go to church they won't like heaven very much they'll be disappointed there won't be no television won't be no remote controls won't be no internet hey man I don't get me wrong I'm not I'm not so you trying to you know just preach legalism tonight to you and say that all those things are on those things have their place and they can be used for the right thing but we find about 99.5% of the time they get used for the wrong thing amen but when we get to heaven I don't care who your favorite sports team is there ain't gonna be no basketball or football or soccer or whatever in heaven brother Brandon brother Nathan you saying basketball and football and soccer oh no I'm absolutely not saying that but if they if they become your God where that's more important to you then going to church or reading your Bible or pray and then what we call that as idolatry idolatry amen doesn't have to do that it can be hunting or fishing or our movies or whatever it is whatever you put above God it becomes an idol hey man I don't want anything in front of God I love my mommy I love my daddy I love my wife I love my children but they don't go above Jesus hey man so we want to put God first and all that we do put him first in your decisions put him first in your finances jesus said in Saint Matthew chapter 6 verse 33 seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these things will be added unto you but yet we find a lot of people well Lord when you bless me and coming to my first million then I'll do something for you Lord then then I'll pay my tithes then I'll give offerings then I'll do stuff and then we find people that get to that point then they're making too much money that oh I couldn't give 20% now goodness 10% I'm sorry you don't have to give 20% but if you want to that's alright hey man hey man Lord if you bless me with a million I'll pay 20% on it alright is it okay to pray like that I'll look at some people and I wouldn't want their millions I wouldn't want the pressures and the things that they face and and you know sometimes the more money you have it just means that there's more people coming around and thinking and expecting that you can do something for I'm and so I God didn't promise me a mansion over here but I do have one waiting over there hey man I didn't come for your money tonight I just came to preach the word to you there's a friend that sticketh closer than a brother he sees she comes and she tells him she said whatever he says to you to do do it some people say oh I I could never speak in tongues or I could never shout or I could never run the aisles I couldn't do this without the other brother branham said he was sitting there in the seat of the scornful and said that little lady dancing out there now he said well is there any scripture for that and he said I begin to think about Miriam when she came across and he said she looked back at all the taskmaster Slade behind him in the Red Sea and he said there there Moses came across and he began to sing and he said Moses Miriam rather began to get the tambourine and begin to dance and and worship with the daughters of Israel and he said I begin to Pat my foot a little bit he said I got my methodist foot patent you know and he said then I begin to think about David how that when he begin to bring the Ark of the Covenant back to the back to Jerusalem there and he was so excited to see the heart come back into the city he said he began to run around the dark and dance and a sound and his wife stood at the window looking out at him and said oh goodness look at that little Holy Roller out there he said do you think that's something watch this and around and around he went again he said before you know it I was out there dancing with her hey man so don't don't tell you're not gonna do something whatever he says my I don't I don't think that God would ask me to brother Solomon but if God told me tonight to lay down in the floor and roll down the aisle I'd do it if I really thought it was him whatever he says I'm willing to do if he tells me to go testify to somebody that I don't think has a chance I'll go do it amen because a lot of times hey maybe there was some that wouldn't come and testify to you and they didn't think you had a chance but yet here you sit in church tonight so I thank God that somebody got through to you that God used somebody he brought somebody by your way I don't know about you I know there was no angel that floated down out of heaven and came and said Nathan you know God God came and died for you and and then there's a message and a truth for the aged but somebody brought this all on my path amen so I believe somebody got to use somebody to get to you brother Branham teaches the seat always comes through the body it came through Philip to the eunuch in it or through the Ethiopian eunuch there and and it comes through the body to somebody so amen many times I think God is waiting on us to be that somebody that the word comes through to me that somebody that'll testify down at Walmart or that's your job or at your school or whatever it be so many times we get so afraid because of political correctness and people's opinions and things today that we're afraid to testify but but yeah brother brother Jack was tell me there's a there's a brother here tonight I believe that it heard about this church so because somebody just lived a life out there and they recognize that's a sister hey man sometimes that's all you got to do sometimes it takes more but sometimes all you gotta do is just walk down through and live a good clean holy life and people will get thirsty and recognize there's something real about that person there something that they have not an old legalistic something with your nose stuck up in the air and then get on better than all these people down here and my job but just a life of humility and a love of Jesus Christ that they recognize there's something real hey man whatever he says do it whatever he tells you to do hey man who do you think you are brother Nathan I'm I'm like that song that they say I'm just a nobody trying to tell everybody all about somebody that saved my soul Amen that's who I am I'm not anything brother Solomon but he's everything hey man I don't claim to be anything great but I serve one that's mighty greats hey man he's wonderful you know I'm getting off topic tonight left and right but let me just say this I was preaching recently and you know I was talking about David and Goliath and I always tease when a brother comes through and preaches on Dave and Goliath you know we've heard Dave and goliath 578 different ways from from 50 different preachers but yet something about it the anointing of the Spirit can come and you can begin to look into things and and you begin to see things about these stories in the Bible that you never saw before you've heard it a thousand times but yet what is it the word is eternal and so because the word is eternal if the Lord tarries another five years or 50 years or a hundred years whatever it'll be they'll still be an anointing on the word that people still be bringing things you'll think my goodness I never heard it like that why because the word is anointed and it's eternal and so you might be in a situation five years down the road that you're not in tonight and then you open up the Bible or you turn on a tape or you hear a minister get in the pulpit and you think why didn't I ever hear like that before because you didn't mean it like that before hey man but the light oh my I'm not looking for more light to unfold and has already been unfolded but I'm looking to walk into more of it than I've walked in hey man I don't think we're here to try to bring more revelation but I think there's a lot of Revelation that was brought that we've just scratched the surface of hey man so I want to keep digging into the revelation David when he got out there to fight Goliath you know everybody else was looking at the size of Goliath and compared to the Goliath the David it seemed absolutely ridiculous the size difference there and no doubt everybody else they'd heard this challenge go forth for 39 days and brother Brandon teaches us that 40 is the number of temptation Moses went up into the mountain 40 days Jesus went into the wilderness 40 days and so now the 40th day this giant has come and tempted them and said bring me a man but it just so happened to be that that day there was a man that had had an experience with God and had seen what God could do and he said hey if God can deliver me from a lion and a bear that wasn't even challenged in God they were just doing what their own natural animalistic instinct was that they smelled a sheep and they was hungry and they started to go after it they weren't challenged in God and rebuking of the children of God but here this man stands and he's defined the Living God david says hey if he delivered me from a lion and a bear that was just doing what their natural instinct was how much more will he deliver me from this uncircumcised philistine hey man let me say tonight if God brought you out of darkness to truth and if these pains are bills and he's given you a house whatever the whatever Satan has tried to come in tonight and rob you of the same God that can deliver you from the lion and the bear he's the same God tonight amen we put our testimonies back in the past if we're not careful all he did this for me back then but I want to tell you many of us if we live to be much older at all our best testimonies are in the future not in the past amen some of our best victories have God Terry's there in the future brother Jack's why because there's a brother in my church says it just keeps getting gooder and gooder I mean I know that's not proper English but I like it it just keeps getting gooder and gooder I mean that's how I feel about the Word of God hey man is so David but see everybody else looked at the size of Goliath and the size of David and it looked ridiculous but David wasn't worried about comparing his size with Goliath size he was comparing Goliath size to God size and compared to God Goliath was pretty puny I mean that's the problem with us many times we compared well you know this brother over here the brother Jack he's the pastor he's probably a better prayer warrior than I am and sister saw us over here she probably lives a better life than me but oh I know I'm a better Christian than brother so-and-so though because I know he don't make it to church near as much as I do and I've seen when the basket comes around he don't even put no money in the offering plate and ice I'm out here you know talking to some worldly woman the other day and so I know I'm a better Christian than him we begin to look around and compare our size to everybody else's amen but I'm not here to compare my anointing with some other ministers anointing or to compare my ministry with somebody else's ministry or compare my Christianity with somebody else's Christianity why I'm not depending on any of that I'm depending on Jesus Christ amen he's bigger than my problems he's bigger than my trials he's bigger than the Giants that are standing in my hey man stop comparing everything to your sis to yourself or to your church start to your pastor to the Deacons or whatever and compare it to Jesus Christ hey man whatever he says do it we'll get to it eventually whatever he says do it and this young man recognizes my friend can turn water into wine a little while later they're traveling through the city of nain and here comes a widowed woman this lost her son and they're packing the casket out there and she's mourning and weeping and and and his friend didn't stop and have a prayer meeting he didn't he didn't try to whip up a bunch of dancing and running and jumping although hey I'm all for dancing and running and jumping if it's the Holy Spirit I'm just not for working it up when it's not him amen you can tell when it's salmon when it's not him hey man you can tell when he's here and every service is not the same amen tomorrow morning Lord willin if he tarries we're gonna have another service in the morning it won't be the same as tonight hey man that don't mean it'll be better or worse it just means what the specific anointing for a service God hasn't planned and if we're not careful oh my remember remember last year those services we had brother Jack why didn't you invite that brother to come again and then if the Lord tarries another year all my remember when brother Nathan was here why'd you invite this other brother why didn't you have him back because the Lord had ordained for the time and the service what was supposed to be and sometimes brother Solomon will get up and sing your favorite song and sometimes he'll get up and sing somebody else's favorite song and sometimes it won't be your favorite song sometimes it'll be your favorite piano player an organ player in the next service it might not be your favorite but you know what God had something specific ordained for that service and I believe he has something specific ordained for tonight so whatever it would be god we can't compare service to service and revival to revival but God has sometimes it's running and jumping and shouting and sometimes it's a still small voice and you just lift your hand and wait to God and and you know we don't compare all those things he doesn't always come sometimes he comes like a mighty rushing he did that on the day of Pentecost we thank God for that and sometimes it's a still small voice amen and we should be able to rejoice that one just as much as the other it's the same God hey man that's why we still you know I I know it's not popular around the message but I still believe in a God called ministry and not just my favorite office or not just my favorite preacher and not just my favorite personality but I believe it's a many membered body not just five ministering gifts but nine spiritual gifts and many different gifts that that God places into the body brother Graham said even as a housewife has a ministry so don't let the devil belittle you and your place in the kingdom of God tonight each one of us has a part to put in but I thank God for a 5-volt ministry because some people you know they they feed on teaching and some people get stirred up by preaching and some people you know we'd grow different ways but yet we all can be blessed by different types of ministries and different types of seasons and are in our life and different things that we're going through sometimes we need just some good solid teaching of the word to stabilize us and balance us out oh it may not make us want to run and jump but it'll ground us in the word amen so God sends different gifts our way and I thank God for him Jesus just walks along and all he did brother Jack was just touched the casket oh my I wish he'd touched some caskets around some message churches some people is dead and sins and trespasses they come into church and they're there they're physically present but it looks like somebody just propped them up against the wall or later mount in the chair you can count them you know well we had this many people here tonight but I don't want to count the dead ones I just want to count the ones that are alive and they came to church and that want to be there hey man I don't care you know I don't care nothing about just fill in pews you know we've got some people that come to church in about five minutes in doesn't matter how hard up reach how loud I preach how quiet I preach how slow or how fast I preach they're gonna be out well they're warming a seat but I don't know how much they're getting out of it hey man notice somebody might say wake up God's here tonight amen nobody it doesn't matter that brother Nathan's here it matters that God is here tonight hey man I don't want to just warm a seat but I want to put something into the service some brothers came through recently and one of the brothers was telling a story and he said there was a man and his son came into the church and he said they passed the offering plate and said a man put in a dollar and they passed it on different people putting in different things when the service was over he said the Deacons was walking out with the offering plate and the man didn't like what the preacher preached he said he reached over and he took that dollar bill back out of the offering plate and the little boy looked at it and said daddy he said what son said if you were to put more in you would have got more out you can take that either way you were talking about offerings they're talking about just into the service but if you come to the service and you sit there like a bump on a log and you won't raise your hands and praise them and you won't say thank you Jesus for hallelujah or amen you go out at church do you think oh I didn't get very much out of the service tonight well why didn't you put more in hey man don't depend on brother Jack or brother Nathan her brother let's go to do all the work but you got to put something in - oh Jesus did was just lay his hand on the casket and a dead man set up you know we never can find in Scripture or history wherever Jesus attended a funeral when they actually got to the end of the funeral hey man every funeral he attended it was no longer a funeral that was a celebration this young man says my friend can raise the dead he's sitting there on the hillside and it's a hot day and they're out in the wilderness and he's listening to his friend teach and he's amazed to hear this young man that he grew up with sit there and and break down the word in a way that the common people could understand and he's sitting there and and the people begin to get a little restless and and Jesus turns he asked the disciples he said have you got anything to feed the people I love when Jesus asks a question like that because he already knows the answer but he just wants to see how we'll respond and in fact any any question that Jesus asked is really a rhetorical question he doesn't need you to tell him the answer he already knows the answer hey man have we got enough to feed him Philip he said all my said well you know we don't really have anything there's not there's not any grocery stores nearby if we did we don't have the money to buy the food he said all we got one little boy played hooky from school and he's got a couple loaves and a couple pieces of fish and Jesus said bring that here and he begins to take it and break the bread you see many times we got to think we've got to do some great big something or as Lord with I can just get to this point in my life spiritually or if I can just quit this or I can just do that all right then I'll really be a good Christian of mine you know if I could do enough works to be a really good Christian then Jesus Christ died in vain now I believe when we recognize what Jesus Christ did for us it'll produce works in our life because we love him so much that we want to do something for him don't get me I'm not just throwing works completely out tonight but if you're trying to work your way in you're putting the cart before the horse because if you could have worked your way in then the Pharisees have had it right in Jesus didn't a man it wasn't working your way in but this little boy he didn't have much to offer but when he gave it to Jesus Jesus was able to accomplish some more with it than he could have ever imagined and maybe you don't have much to offer tonight but give it to Jesus one time and see what he can do with it he begins to take and break this fish and his friend would sit there and watch maybe he would peek through the crowd and see nudges sister see did you see that my friend can multiply creation amen you know people get scared today they question you know squirrels being smoking to existence and things like that but yeah we find out how did the first one get here hey man if you can't believe in squirrels being spoken to the existence you'd have a hard time when God said Let there be squirrels you'd have a hard time you say oh I don't believe in no fish being resurrected you'd have a hard time when there was no fish and God's saying let there be fish oh I don't believe a possum could be healed I don't think God would do something like that and care about something that's so insignificant you'd have a hard time when God said there wasn't no opossums on the whole world and God said let there be a possum God why would you care to create a possum you know there's a lot of things I don't understand I don't understand why created spiders I don't understand it but he did it I don't understand why he created snakes sister Sara but he did it so there's a purpose and a reason behind it somewhere hey man I'm not gonna question him I just don't understand it all oh my friend can multiply on creation he here's a story where they're out the disciples are out there fishing and Jesus just come he didn't have a boat he didn't have a jetski he didn't have anything he just comes walking across the water he says my friend can walk on water he hears about him crossing a stormy sea - again answer it Jesus had - he had created the fish and the loaves multiplied creation now he gets in the boat and he goes to the other side of the sea you know and I find it so funny you know we got a lot of people like that around the message still today the the the Pharisees all they took out of that story if you go back and read the scriptures when 5,000 people was fed by one little boys lunch and what they took away from the from the story if you read the very next three verses is Jesus why didn't your disciples wash their hands out there before they fed all those people before they ate you know they was hinting that was so unsanitary they was handing out bread and fish in the desert and didn't even wash their hands the way that our tradition says that they have to oh isn't it sad that a lot of people still today have that same mentality about the Word of God they want to nitpick little things well why didn't you do it this way and why don't you and yet the supernatural being done and he gets in the boat he's tired he's prayed for the sick he's multiplied creation he's going over to pray for a demon-possessed man across the way and he gets in the boat and the devil tries to drown him and the disciples a storm comes up and they tell him they said if you would have been there said mine never seen anything like I said he just put his foot up on the side of the boat and he didn't scream he didn't he didn't get mad he just said peace be still and the winds and the waves obeyed him he said he said that's my friend my friend can stop the storms my friend can calm storms he can calm troubled seas they talking about when they got over and he prayed for leaves and a man that was out in the in the tombs cutting himself began to be free sand my friend can can't but can cast out Devils and he's standing there with him one day and and they the the Pharisees you know they thought for sure they'd catch him and this one they brought a woman caught in the very act of adultery and threw down at his feet and said hey what do you think we should do with their Moses law says stoner he said that's right and he used without first without sin pick up the first stone there he was the only one that could have really picked up a stone being without sin but yet he turns around he says where are thy accusers she said I have none he said neither do I accuse you go and sin no more and he sits there he says my friend can forgive sins and all of a sudden he begins to get sick now he has seen this friend cast out devils heal the sick raise the dead and he begins to get sick and he tells his sisters he says listen he said I I don't know where my friends at I haven't been able to find him but said the doctor says there's no hope for me the doctor says there's nothing they can do I've tried medicines I've tried chiropractors I've tried all kinds of different things and the doctors all say the same thing there's no hope and I don't know where he's at in revival but you go and you try to find him because you know what he could tell him he said look as a little boy as a teenager as a young man there's been many times that I've let him down by the Westco but he said but my friend has never let me down I mean that's my testimony tonight brother Jack I don't stand up here perfect before you there have been many times that I've let him down but he's never let me down and so he gets sicker and sicker his lungs begin to fill with blood brother Brennan tells us in several different places that that he died of tuberculosis and that a hemorrhage a hemorrhaging of the lungs is what he said historian's told us that that actually killed him and so he gets he gets sicker and sicker they can't find him anywhere and and he begins to cough and coughing up blood and he's laying there and he's slowly beginning to die and he begins to fade in and out of consciousness and as he comes back to himself have you found my friend no we haven't found him it's okay it's not too late yet my friend has never let me down he's never been late he's never failed me he's never failed me it's not too late there is coughing up blood and then bringing him some more towels and things and coughing up more blood it's not too late brother Troy he ain't let me down I don't care how sick I am I don't care what the symptoms look like I don't care what the doctor says he's never let me down he's never failed me he gets sicker and sicker and as he regains consciousness the last time it maybe he means to think I don't understand I don't understand I thought for sure he'd be here by now I don't think I can hold on much longer I thought he would be here by now and he goes and he dies and his sisters have looked everywhere they sent out the 70 looking for the disciples they couldn't find him nowhere couldn't find Jesus nowhere and he doesn't know they don't know what what happened but then they think it's gonna be all right I remember I remember the widow's boy in nain you remember that Martha you remember all he did he didn't even pray he didn't preach the funeral he didn't do nothing he just laid his hand on the casket it's not too late Mary it's not too late maybe he'll get back in time to preach the funeral and there won't be no funeral and they're waiting I don't know who got up and preached the funeral but if they're waiting and they turn around look and they're not hearing anything that he said it's a funeral I doubt brother Westco they're looking around waiting for that back door to open and Jesus come walking in and say it's all right your friends here but he didn't come he didn't come brothers Roy and they take him and they put him they put him in this tomb and they they roll a stone over it and they could sit there and remember different things that Lazarus had told him about his friend he said my friends the only one that can say I always do that which pleases the father he was the only one I don't say it to belittle anybody but Moses st. Paul brother branham you mean nobody could ever say I always do that which pleases the father except this man's friend amen you might think you can say it but your wife will kick you in the shins and call you a liar he was the only one that could say I have power to lay my life down I have power to take it back up again he was the only one that can say it he was the only one that could say I am the resurrection and the life and they waited and made maybe they were sitting there reading the scriptures brother Jack and they they begin to talk to one another said you know I don't understand there's been times we've had sickness in our family there's been times we've had financial troubles there's been times you know we were arguing and bickering back and forth and our friend always showed up and just knew exactly what to do and exactly what to say and here he is and he's not he's not here yet and here our brother lays in the grave and they began maybe they picked up a scroll and they begin to read over in the Psalms and David said I'll not suffer my Holy One to see corruption they said oh so here we go brother Troy there's still hope left there's still hope yet it hasn't been 72 hours yet and corruption hasn't set in maybe he'll come and he'll raise him from the dead before corruption sets in and he's not too late yet fourth day all hope is gone never you go back through all the history of the Bible all there'd been a dead man they threw in on the bones of Elijah one time he was just freshly dead a knee raised there was different ones that raised from the dead but there was never one Jesus raised several from the dead the the one there that we just talked about the little boy that in cane the widow's son that he prayed for but never had anybody ever been dead for days and come back all hope was gone he's too late our friend let us stand I don't understand and here he comes walking down the road four days late and they came to me and said we don't understand if you'd been here our brother wouldn't daddy sit on he said it's okay your brother all rise again they said all we know we know Lord he'll rise in the in the resurrection you know they weren't Sadducees they were looking for a resurrection said all mine said he'll rise again he said no no you don't understand I am the resurrection of life said where have you laid him but you're too late Lord you're too late and I can imagine Lazarus here he is a four days journey in another dimension and he's probably sitting there brothers Solomon fellowship one of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and they're telling him all about the things that they saw and all the things and he begins to tell Jobe he said you remember that one you said I know my redeemer liveth I met him that's my friend that's my friend I've recognized that's got to be my friend ain't nobody been able to do things like Jesus has done that's my friend Daniel do you remember that one you saw oh that's the one that I saw but I saw him in the flesh you remember Ezekiel that wheel in the middle of the wheel I wrote down the road with him amen oh I say you remember that virgin that was going to conceive and bear a child and his name was going to be a manual I slept right beside him on a camping trip Amen God with us God was with me in a tent on a camping trip God was with me in the back of the boat on a fishing trip Emmanuel God with us I used to have sleepovers at a Manuel's house and they begin to get excited Abraham you remember that one you saw at the off anybody and you ain't with him that one time I you see with him all the time I know his favorite fish place and they're rejoicing all of a sudden from another dimension here it's not not a quiet voice like a lot of us when we come to church - amen but the scripture said he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth and he cried loud enough that Lazarus heard him in another dimension and all of a sudden these lungs that had been filled with tuberculosis and hemorrhaging and bleeding a few days before all of a sudden air begins to breathe back in those lungs and that heart that had been dead for four days begins to pump and that knows that it began to sink in comes back out right but he's still bound and he's still in the darkness like a lot of us when Jesus came by and delivered us but it wasn't just enough for him to speak life but he said loose him and let him go a man that's my friend oh my he's still a present help in the time of trouble there's a friend that sticketh closer than a brother if you don't know him that way tonight he can be your friend too brother Branham tells us several different places I'll read you a couple of them he says in one place sight in time is God's worst enemy in divine healing another time he says time in sight is the worst enemies that God has time and sight and that's what most of us if we'll be honest with ourselves if we're not careful we begin to look at the clock or look at the symptoms and like Lazarus we think Lord has it's been too long if he was going to heal me like congressman Upshaw that brother Jack was talking about their sick for 60 some-odd years crippled and yet God heals him in his 80s why didn't God heal him when he was younger because God wanted to be glorified in it hey man if he would have healed him right away maybe nobody would have heard about it but by now this man's a congressman he begins to send letters to the King of England he begins to send letters all around the world to other congressmen and leaders of state and things and God had a plan in it but we if we're not careful we begin to look at the clock and we begin to look at the symptoms and and that's why the scripture tells us that faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen now when God spoke and said let there be there was nothing to see but everything that we see here tonight came from something that was nothing you say well you know somebody formed this wood together and somebody put the metal together and all that but if you take it back to its raw materials everything that we see whether it's a person or I house or a car or a tree or whatever it be an animal at one point in time it was smoke from nothing and then the seeds of what we see today whether it be animal life or plant life or human life all those seeds were in those originals that God said let there be and there was and so when it many times when we look we look to the scene instead of looking to the unseen we look at the doctor statements my if that little girl would have just looked at the x-rays she wouldn't have been two inches taller tonight she wouldn't have had a normal sign tonight but they didn't just look to the x-ray they look to Jehovah Jireh amen so we find that God brother Ben tells us God can correct all wrong if anything's wrong he can make it right amen that's a big statement but we serve a big God if anything's wrong God can make it right now I know we're emphasizing on physical healing tonight but I want to say if you have emotional scars we got a lot of those around the message too don't we brother Troy people got hurt by their family by some little school friend that they used to play with that got made fun of some type of work situation or some church situation some church leader hurt them or let them down or disappointed them and people pack around scars all the time and they can't move on and can't forgive and can't grow in God because of emotional scars but if God if there's anything wrong God can make it right I mean that's not just for broken bones and cancer but anything that's wrong mental problems children born with mental problems I believe God can heal bands he's if he can heal the body he can heal the mind he can heal the family he can heal the finances he can heal the emotions if anything's wrong he can make it right again he tells us what the devil done any time God can take it away so whatever condition you're in tonight well the Satan allowed this to happen in my life and Satan allowed this to happen in my family and Satan allowed this back in my past all this anything what the devil done anytime God can take it away Moses tells us that he's the Lord that healeth thee David tells us bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases you see it's always been a dual atonement the same God that can forgive thine iniquities can heal your diseases David didn't just say that Isaiah came and said he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with this stripes we are healed not we might be healed not I hope we'll be here we are healed whether you can physically see it or not tonight you are healed not because brother Nathan might lay hands on you in a few minutes or because some of these brothers are gonna say a prayer over you in a few minutes or because we've got a prayer cloth as acts 19 tells us or anointing oil as James tells us in James chapter 5 none of though that's just obedience to God's Word that's not what heals you that just builds your faith to accept what God already did for you by His stripes you are already healed and James tells us is there any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if he have committed any sins they shall be forgiven him so it's a dual atonement forgiveness of sins and healing how many times when Jesus prayed for somebody and they was sick did he say go and sin no more or less the worst thing come upon you so we find you don't have to be a Christian to be healed but you have to be a Christian to stay healed now brother min tells us again in deep calling to the deep in 1956 he said people for healing of the body to be so complicated it's very simple just taking God at His Word just saying the same thing that he does that's all we may get some big complicated thing all brother so-and-so would just come and pray for me or all this could just happen or God if you could just show me a sign or if I could just my symptoms could just get a little better then I could believe in be healed no healing isn't complicated it's just taking him at his word he said that you're healed so you are healed no matter what the doctor said no matter what I say or anybody else says you're healed because his word says that you're healed now whether you're gonna see the manifestation of it or not depends on whether you can take him at his word or not but you're already healed if you can accept it let me say this tonight God loves you not because of anything he can show you or give you he loves you because he said he loves you and no matter what anybody else says or no matter what you convinced yourself of that all I've gone too far I've made too many mistakes or I just don't think he could love somebody like me he loves you because he said he loves you that's the proof of his love a man if God blesses me with a bigger car or a nicer house or more money in the bank account or more health in my body that is wonderful and I appreciate that but that doesn't prove his love to me his love has already proved because he said he loved me and either I take him at his word or I don't and that's the same for healing for salvation for whatever you have need of tonight either you take God at His Word tonight and you walk out of here healed either you take him at his word tonight you walk out of here save you take him at his word tonight and you walk out of here with peace and victory or you doubt his word you go out and well I'm still nervous I'm still upset I'm still depressed I'm still sick I still got this cough I still got this ache I still got this pain why brother Nathan because you didn't take him at his word again brother Graham tells us if you've got faith enough to walk across the floor to walk across that floor you've faith enough for anything God promised if you got faith enough to raise up your hand why you've got faith enough for anything else it's simple faith now I don't have I don't claim to have SuperDuper faith I don't claim to be some great mighty magnificent faith warrior but I do have enough faith tonight by the grace of God to walk across the floor you didn't think I had faith enough to do it did you I've got enough faith why because I've done it before I've walked across the floor before I've done it brother Jack I don't have to wonder now careful these legs I'm not sure if they work right or not here's the floor does this floor move do you have it on a tilt just against there is a ring gonna spin around or are we gonna drop 50 feet what is it no I've walked across this floor before in fact brother Jackson I don't know why he puts up with me but he's been inviting me back for years I've walked across this floor many times sometimes I've walked back and forth across it so many times I've probably made some of you nervous but I have faith that I can do it because I've experienced it before and if you if you've been healed before or you've seen God heal somebody before then you know that he's more than able you know that he's able so why don't you put your faith in action and say hey I believe it tonight I have faith to receive it tonight if you've got faith enough to walk across the floor you got faith enough for that if you got faith enough to raise your hand now you have to you know you know unless you've got some serious muscle or or some type of problems nerve problems or whatever it be I don't think there's anybody in here that just raises their hand involuntarily if so then you're probably encouraging the pastor because you just every once a while raise your hand like that but I don't think there's anybody in here tonight that just involuntarily raises their hand so if you're gonna raise your hand it takes a conscious thought and there has to be a spirit inside of you that has life that's able to make that that conscious thought go through and and the neurons in your brain begin to fire they send they send messages to the nerves and to the muscles in your body and you don't have to sit there and think about it and work it up and say Lord it's been about three hours since I raised this left armen I sure hope it still works I don't know now let's see the word said this and brother Jack teaches this and science says this and and history says that and my mommy and my daddy taught me this sigh I guess I hope that my arm still works to raise it you don't have to work it up and figure it all out you just raise your hand because your brain told you to and you've experienced it before you know that those muscles work and the arm works and your mind tells your body to do it and it's not it doesn't take a lot of conscious thought you just do it praise God that's how healing is Lord I take you at your word Lord I accept what you did for me I don't gotta figure it all out I don't gotta work it out I don't have to take science and history in the Bible and put them all together and come out with some equation to be healed I'm healed because he said so he says right out in front of you stands a person just like he was a few minutes ago you were sit down here but there's a well person standing there Jesus Christ is calling to that well person right beyond it now you just by faith as you close your eyes walk right into that well body see then just keep on walking just keep on going now we had a prayer line I'm not gonna do it here tonight but we had a prayer line a few weeks to go to our church and I read this whole brother Jack and I told the church I said now I'm not gonna lay hands on you tonight because I don't want anybody be able to say well brother Nathan laid hands I mean this is what it was but I told him I said you just visualized that well body and you start over here and you walk your way into it and when you get there you just say Lord that's my well body I'm walking into and I'm gonna keep on walking and you just imagine Jesus on the other side saying come on into this well body and we had people walk by and people started screaming and shouting and some of them was healed instantly I didn't touch them but something touched him amen he touched him or they touched the hem of His garment he tells us just take a little mental trip now and remember imagine sing the Lord Jesus walking right down the aisle standing there by the side of you now let's be honest we've been taught that he has no hands but our hands and no letters but our lips no feet but our feet if he's gonna do something he's gonna do it through the body but let's be honest tonight if it wasn't me your brother West or brother Jack here tonight but Jesus of Nazareth came walking in the door and walked around and came up the back aisle and stood right beside you and put his hand on you and said I want to heal you more than you want to be healed you'd have a shouting fit right here you'd have a shouting fit so why don't we do it why don't we accept our healing like that because we don't take him at his word the way that we should but he said imagine Jesus coming walking down the background stand and besides you and saying my child child of mine I want to heal you more than you want to be healed now we've heard him say that he wants that God wants us to have the Holy Ghost more than we want to receive it but here he's saying he Jesus Christ is standing there saying child of mine I want to heal you more than you want to be healed now how many tonight whether it's physical emotional mental family whatever it is how many needs healing in their life some form of healing you want the healing you really want it he wants you to have it more than you want it his desire he said I would that she prosper in health even as your soul prospers he wants us to be well spiritually physically emotionally mentally in every way he cares about you he loves you when you come through this line tonight I don't want you to just say well there's brother Nathan and brother Jacqueline different brothers they're gonna lay hands on me and pray for me and I guess it'll just be another prayer line another service but I want you to visualize what he said there's your sick body stand and there's you come along but when you get to the end over here and don't let the devil lie to you and say well Manor I'll just walk down the middle I'll go ahead and walk on across the floor prove the devil you got enough faith to walk on across the floor and visualize that well body or that family that's back together again or that job or that fan a financial issue that you're facing all better or whatever it is some situation at your school or some mental oppression that the devil is trying to give you anxiety or fear or depression or whatever it is imagine walking into that well body with all that better all those negative things gone all those emotional scars from when you got made fun of when he was a kid or or whatever it was got abused or whatever and you walk right into that well body you say I'm delivered I'm victorious I'm gonna walk out of here different than I came in I'm never gonna complain again I'm never gonna have a negative thought again if I do I'm not gonna dwell on it I'm gonna have a positive testimony when somebody asks me I'm not gonna tell them how bad I'm feeling I'm gonna tell them I'm healed because jesus healed me I'm healed because Jesus wants me to be healed more than I even wanted to receive it I mean you do that and you take God at His Word I guarantee you you'll notice a difference in your life you know or you can go out and say well there's just another service I'll come back again or maybe it'll be different Amy let's bow our heads together dear Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful that we have that same friend that Lazarus had Lord we love you tonight and Lord we just take you at your word Lord as we enter into this service I pray that she'd be with us be with each one that has a need Lord no matter how severe how small Lord every need Lord if the people care and they they have a desire in their heart or do you care you care about their situation you cared enough to sent into your word and to send your prophet and to send ministers by Lord to try to encourage hearts and try to help us to build our faith to a place where we can take you at your word you care tonight for these people whatever they're facing Lord whatever the devil has tried to rob them of whether it's their health or whatever it would be Lord we believe that you're more than able and that you care about them and or whatever the devil's done at any time you're able to make it right father well we take you at your word tonight we accept it by faith in Jesus Christ's name Amen I don't know exactly what brother Jack has in mind but I would say this for the musicians maybe just let one musician come up and play and let the rest of them any of them that wants to come and and and be prayed for let them come through and then when they get through if whoever's playing wants to come through the prayer line let them play let's just just something simple sister Rachel just the Great Physician or something like that then actually do you know healing is here and I receive it do you know the Great Physician that's fine a man will just join together in faith while these people are coming through being prayed for you pray with us agree with us for their healing and their deliverance brother did you want to say anything before we do just as the brother Nathan was saying we wanna those that want to be prayed for we want you to just line up on this on this wall here and as you're lying now we will anoint you with oil according to the scripture [Music] those data are in receipts if you just keep your head back all these are coming through to be free for tonight [Music] this is a gift from God you healing tonight is a gift from God so we want to encourage you to receive that and as you're receiving the gift is just telling them thank you and just worship him in your own special way but God has gifts that he wants to give to each and every one that's coming through the slant tonight with faith I believe that [Music] the minister may feel that just to stop and talk with some a man if he does that then we want you to just feel free to open up I'm reminded of the woman that had a child it was fixed with the devil and she told the horse and my child was at home thanks for the help she was very specific about her problem Jesus was able to take care of it tonight if the minister talks to you be very specific he wants to touch and agree and believe God with you tonight those that know the song and you you see just sing along as create an atmosphere for God to do miraculous things in this place [Music] you [Music] [Music] you [Music] dismissed is there anybody else here tonight wanted was prayer before we decide every physician now is near supervisor Jesus [Music] now ease me see see Jesus he speaks part 2 cheer Oh [Music] gee no D see sweet [Music] to turn sweet [Music] oh Jesus [Music] stand to your feet

it's not based on the feeling is not based on an emotion it's based on what God said I believe if you walk out of here tonight with the faith that was preached to us you'll experience your own personal miracle I'm on the expectation that many y'all will hear the testimony I'll see precious brother Joe and that could bring the baby [Music] and you were there that night we're gonna pray for you go see if people see anything see God did it for Abraham and Sarah all right brother amen I believe that I'm on the expectation you know this year the Lord put in our spirit at the beginning of the year that's certain and we started serving out with was the year of the incredible and incredible things a man of things that just don't seem possible right but you know in order to be a Christian you have to believe the incredible because our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ was born of a virgin if there was anything impossible that was something that should have been impossible but by him coming through Mary's womb hallelujah amen that was something Amen incredible that occurred and we're believing that God's gonna do it man similar things for us [Music] amen let's have a word of Prayer again

see them crying and seeing a man seated the diapers and everything else that goes along with taking care of a baby we already see it and we thank you for it god we thank you for the well bodies amen that those that maybe have gone through accidents and the devil has tried to wipe them out but they couldn't go nowhere amen because their purpose was their protection praise God you still got something for them and fathered it and one thing you got for me healings and a testimony goes forth from the healing that will encourage other people that would show that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so father I pray and I thank you in advance for everything that you've done in this place tonight Oh God we just we just believe Lord the incredible things a man will occur
