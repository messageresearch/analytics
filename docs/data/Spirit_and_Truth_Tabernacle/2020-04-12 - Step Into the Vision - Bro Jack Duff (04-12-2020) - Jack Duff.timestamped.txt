[9:25] I be afraid when the wicked even mind
[9:28] enemies and my folks came upon me to eat

[52:54] in the midst of them I understand over
[52:57] him and England that they wouldn't allow
[52:59] more than two people to gather together

[53:04] Scripture because Jesus sake wherever

[53:48] [Music]
[53:51] [Applause]
[53:55] let's eat just for a few minutes here
[53:58] just want to take a little time to bring
[54:02] greetings to all those that are joining
[54:05] us online we have been blessed here in
[54:11] the state of Florida and the Lord has
[54:12] given us a governor that says you know
[54:15] when I'm not gonna limit people for
[54:17] going to church on Easter I want them to
[54:20] be able to go to the house of God you
[54:22] know so we've been able to come together
[54:24] just a few Saints and a man someone
[54:26] joining us online and we thank God for
[54:29] that because we're still trying to do
[54:30] all of them use all the precautions we
[54:32] can a man just use the little wisdom
[54:34] during this time but we thank God just
[54:37] to be able to gather together and also I
[54:39] wanted to thank the Lord
[54:40] we have spoken word ministries there out
[54:44] of a man
[54:46] Londyn a man whispered women passed in
[54:51] air and you know that he called me up a
[54:55] little earlier this week and he says
[54:57] brother we were supposed to have
[54:59] meetings and you know this devil just
[55:02] comes with this business this little
[55:04] attack here say but we still want to
[55:06] have service and I say ok say how many
[55:10] services y'all having and I was telling
[55:13] them what we were doing for this weekend
[55:14] they say well brother we still have our
[55:16] meeting - what they've done is have the
[55:17] meetings virtually and you know so
[55:20] they've been using this tool called zoom
[55:22] and then I'm just one that believed God
[55:25] had the people developed a platform like
[55:29] zoom just so the Saints could still go
[55:32] to church today they have issues the
[55:36] government actually can't use the
[55:38] platform they're coming against zoom
[55:39] because of some of the you know security
[55:42] things like that but and and in our
[55:44] field of work we actually want this to
[55:47] get out if somebody wants to break in
[55:50] and see somebody's we're okay with that
[55:53] maybe your life would be changed by the
[55:57] power of God so you know if they took
[56:00] zoom and they've been creating some
[56:01] services and ever since Friday they had
[56:04] a service Friday at 2:00 on Saturday and
[56:06] - today
[56:07] hey man so in England it's roughly you
[56:11] know a little after 5:00 I mean almost 6
[56:13] o'clock
[56:13] up there and they are tuned in to this
[56:16] service a man enjoying the worship and
[56:20] we want to say God bless you try
[56:22] brothers and sisters from the UK God
[56:25] richly bless you
[56:26] we're so happy to have you in fellowship
[56:29] and so happy that the Lord inspired the
[56:32] pastor to put something like this
[56:33] together we still gonna have Easter
[56:36] regardless a man so this is a different
[56:40] way of doing it but God is good anyway
[56:42] earlier this I got a chance to see the
[56:45] service over on Friday and
[56:47] and I texted out to a few Saints and
[56:49] then gave them information for yesterday
[56:51] but I didn't get a chance necessary but
[56:54] this morning I got up and I was looking
[56:55] at the service and and I saw my precious
[56:58] brother and friend brother Lincoln Amen
[57:01] up in North Carolina
[57:02] ministering to the Saints there and in
[57:05] the UK and I say wow what a what a
[57:07] blessing he was preaching on the sermon
[57:10] the crooked line journey of the believer
[57:13] amen the crooked line journey of the
[57:17] believer and he was saying God never
[57:21] moves us or a man does things in a
[57:25] straight line you don't do things like
[57:27] that
[57:28] God always moving like this it's a
[57:31] crooked line journey and I love one of
[57:33] the things he said that I was listening
[57:35] I couldn't catch the whole sermon but I
[57:37] was blessed by what I heard he says God
[57:39] always appears in the beginning and what
[57:42] it does is give you a promise in the
[57:44] beginning and then what he does is
[57:47] disappear in the middle he appears in
[57:52] the beginning gives you promise and then
[57:54] he disappears in the middle to see if
[57:56] you're gonna hold on to what he said and
[58:00] when you get to the end
[58:02] olives let me show up
[58:06] it's like when he shows up he said I
[58:09] told you so and the other thing about
[58:12] our goddess he only have to say it one
[58:14] time for it to come to pass our God does
[58:18] not have to repeat himself Amen if he
[58:21] said it that settles it lets it be the
[58:25] name of the Lord so I was ours bless a
[58:29] man by brother Lincoln a man just just
[58:31] hearing hearing the word of the Lord
[58:33] amen
[58:34] through him and and I just I just
[58:37] believed that the Lord will just
[58:39] complete this today and we were we were
[58:43] we were certainly looking forward to
[58:45] being there in fellowship and in the UK
[58:47] for Easter and after brother Guinta had
[58:50] passed through this way last year and
[58:52] and he declared you know that Easter the
[58:55] UK you know and the Saints when we're
[58:58] ready to go I believe we had about 40
[59:00] sinks and we're ready to come tickets
[59:02] paid for and everything and hotels paid
[59:05] for it in corona candy but but the Lord
[59:08] knows all things and and and some of the
[59:11] saints what we've done is we've left our
[59:13] ticket opening praise God with the
[59:15] airline so that means when things open
[59:18] up again there is a freedom for us to
[59:22] travel and we know that we talked about
[59:24] maybe doing something next year but if
[59:26] the Lord wants us to come before that
[59:28] then we're gonna be open a man to
[59:30] whatever the Lord has in store he's a
[59:32] good God he's an awesome God a man a man
[59:37] amen so what I want to do a man I know
[59:40] when I when I go to UK a man
[59:44] I have to do two things I have to preach
[59:46] I have to sing and what I'd like to do
[59:49] if I can this is preach first and then
[59:52] maybe we'll do a little singing at the
[59:54] end we have a daughter of the assembly
[1:00:01] amen they're here in our midst the stood
[1:00:03] roof a man thank god sister Gwyneth
[1:00:06] daughter but assisted by his daughter
[1:00:08] and I also do another ministry there and
[1:00:11] we're so glad to have her with her
[1:00:14] precious husband for the simba a man we
[1:00:17] think for them being a part of this this
[1:00:21] a man but we thank God for all things so
[1:00:28] what I want to do is I want to go to the
[1:00:30] Word of God first and then afterwards we
[1:00:32] would sing and and and there's a song
[1:00:35] that I was requested to sing they asked
[1:00:38] me to do the blood medley so we'll do
[1:00:40] that and I have to first confess before
[1:00:45] I do the blood medley I have to confess
[1:00:48] my need to ask God to forgive me
[1:00:51] publicly for something that I did
[1:00:54] privately my daughter's when we came to
[1:00:58] UK four years ago they were actually
[1:01:01] singing and I was I said girl you know
[1:01:04] you know y'all get ready y'all go out
[1:01:05] there y'all sing and you know and you
[1:01:08] know saying that's saying you know and
[1:01:10] they say well that we think we don't
[1:01:12] sing the blood will never lose his power
[1:01:14] see see you know no Danny we gonna sing
[1:01:22] the blood never lose his power and as a
[1:01:25] father I'm confessing on my own you know
[1:01:29] so they stone that song and then after
[1:01:32] the song I kind of song a few things
[1:01:42] because I was telling them not to sing
[1:01:45] that song God knows how to do things
[1:01:48] he's in control it's not about us it's
[1:01:50] all about him so I thank God for them
[1:01:53] being obedient and listening to the
[1:01:55] Spirit of the Lord and singing that song
[1:01:57] I mean we will at the end amen of the
[1:01:59] service come back and just try to have a
[1:02:01] little worship a man praising God bless
[1:02:03] you musicians thank you all so much
[1:02:04] appreciate you appreciate for the
[1:02:06] Solomon and the song leading amen the
[1:02:09] specials that went forth we appreciate
[1:02:12] that actually sister Charisse and sister
[1:02:16] Tina we're on the list to come so that
[1:02:18] means when we do come and they own the
[1:02:21] list
[1:02:21] y'all don't let them get by y'all heard
[1:02:23] I'm saying here so don't let them get by
[1:02:25] have them staying there and then you
[1:02:27] came
[1:02:27] praise the Lord thing god bless you amen
[1:02:31] can we stand for the reading of the word
[1:02:33] of God
[1:02:39] returning our Bible to Genesis 21
[1:02:49] so with us planning to go this was a
[1:02:55] sermon that I had in my heart to take
[1:02:57] there to to the UK and and I said well
[1:03:04] since I couldn't do it there I'll do it
[1:03:06] here and you know our church has been
[1:03:09] with me on this particular journey and
[1:03:12] you all will hear some of the same
[1:03:15] things but what I find is that it always
[1:03:17] preach is different every time you you
[1:03:20] preach it and so we're just going to be
[1:03:23] obedient and just try to be a blessing a
[1:03:26] man to everyone and and I I am I'm like
[1:03:29] brother Lincoln you you love being in
[1:03:31] church and seeing other people just you
[1:03:33] know respond to the Word of God and it's
[1:03:36] a little difficult when you're going
[1:03:37] through a platform like this but
[1:03:39] nonetheless let God we're gonna let go
[1:03:42] and let God have his way so we thank God
[1:03:45] for all things amen
[1:03:46] Genesis 21 and a few verses there that
[1:03:51] we will read praise the Lord it was I
[1:03:57] want to read from verse 1 the Bible says
[1:04:00] and the Lord visited Sara as he had said
[1:04:07] a man as he is saying and the Lord did
[1:04:13] unto Sarah as he had spoken the Sarah
[1:04:18] conceived and bare abraham a son in his
[1:04:21] old age at the set time of which God had
[1:04:26] spoken to him and Abraham called the
[1:04:29] name of his son that was born unto Him
[1:04:31] whom Sarah bear to him Isaac a man the
[1:04:36] Lord had a blessing to the reading of
[1:04:37] his word let's just pray over what we've
[1:04:42] read dear God we thank you for the
[1:04:46] ability to read the scripture but God we
[1:04:49] know it takes the Holy Ghost to help us
[1:04:54] understand God the things that we're
[1:04:57] reading and to make it present-tense
[1:04:59] these words that were spoken years
[1:05:02] stories that occur in Scripture years
[1:05:04] ago but yet still apply to us today we
[1:05:07] pray God that you would help us to see
[1:05:09] ourselves in Scripture and that father
[1:05:12] you would get the glory and the honor
[1:05:13] out of our gathering thank you for the
[1:05:16] Saints that are there in the UK Lord in
[1:05:18] their homes streaming the service the
[1:05:20] pastor for the widow who felt that in
[1:05:23] his heart to do it this way god I pray
[1:05:25] that you would bless him and bless his
[1:05:26] church Lord in a very special way and as
[1:05:29] a whorl we are praying for healing in
[1:05:32] the land God you told us in my people
[1:05:35] which are called by my name shall humble
[1:05:38] themselves and pray seek my face turn
[1:05:43] from their wicked ways God just said you
[1:05:46] were here from heaven and you also
[1:05:48] promised that you would heal the land
[1:05:51] and God over the entire earth we need
[1:05:53] healing in the land and father we just
[1:05:57] praying that you would do that and just
[1:05:58] thank you for what you have already done
[1:06:01] and god we know that you have more in
[1:06:03] store bless our time together today as
[1:06:05] we worship a man through the hearing of
[1:06:09] the word it's in Jesus name we pray amen
[1:06:11] and amen god bless you you can be seated
[1:06:14] as we started our year off this year
[1:06:19] we've we're using the subject of step
[1:06:23] into the vision a man that is our title
[1:06:25] for today step into the vision and I
[1:06:28] know that this is Easter and I was
[1:06:30] blessed again by brother Lincoln because
[1:06:34] he was just preaching I noticed a man
[1:06:36] just how the Lord was leading him and I
[1:06:38] said wow that that just helps me that
[1:06:40] frees me up because usually on Easter we
[1:06:43] are always trying to kind of bring
[1:06:44] something you know that's right down the
[1:06:46] channel of Easter but but what I find as
[1:06:49] a believer Easter is everything a man
[1:06:53] Easter is not just one weekend out of
[1:06:56] the year and it changes from the
[1:06:59] calendar every year right but but for us
[1:07:02] as believers Easter is is every day
[1:07:05] hallelujah hallelujah this morning as we
[1:07:09] were just kind of sharing in our
[1:07:10] and our thought of what a resurrection
[1:07:12] this is brother branham made that
[1:07:14] statement there and the message it is
[1:07:18] the rising of the Sun and he was trying
[1:07:20] to show the church that you know yes
[1:07:22] what happened some 2,000 years ago was
[1:07:25] powerful a man it says what a
[1:07:27] resurrection that was but if we would
[1:07:30] recognize a man that we have also been
[1:07:34] quickened just the same way the Lord
[1:07:36] Jesus was quickened and rose from the
[1:07:40] grave we have also been quickened and we
[1:07:43] rose from denomination we rose from the
[1:07:46] things of the world we rose a man from
[1:07:49] from from defeated situations we have
[1:07:52] experienced a personal resurrection
[1:07:56] ourselves and brother Branham say what a
[1:07:58] resurrection that was but when you think
[1:08:01] about what he has done in you then you
[1:08:05] can say what a resurrection this is
[1:08:09] because he's still resurrected
[1:08:12] hallelujah somebody today will
[1:08:15] experience a resurrection how if you're
[1:08:18] sick in your body you can experience a
[1:08:21] resurrection
[1:08:22] you know Joe was sick in his body and
[1:08:25] Joe was the first one to ever see Easter
[1:08:29] hallelujah why he was discouraged and
[1:08:32] some of us may be in a state of
[1:08:34] discouragement we don't know how things
[1:08:36] are gonna work out but when Joe was at
[1:08:38] his worst that's when God gave him a
[1:08:41] glimpse of Easter so if you're at your
[1:08:44] worst if your sin condition is at its
[1:08:48] worst you can expect to get eclipsed of
[1:08:51] Easter what a job see said he says in
[1:08:55] the scripture says the skin worms
[1:08:59] destroy this flesh yet in my flesh I
[1:09:03] shall see God when job made that comment
[1:09:07] it's because God elevated to God about
[1:09:11] job to see a little further than where
[1:09:13] he was and what we need in this hour
[1:09:16] what we need in this season is for God
[1:09:19] elevate us and help us see beyond the
[1:09:23] virus help us see me you're on the tip
[1:09:26] the tribulation help us see me on the
[1:09:28] trouble
[1:09:29] let God elevate us so we can step into
[1:09:32] the vision glory to God hallelujah I
[1:09:37] shall see him for myself and not another
[1:09:40] glory to God jovem had a view of Easter
[1:09:44] and it came at a troubled time we need
[1:09:47] to be able to view east during these
[1:09:49] troubles times I want to just read a
[1:09:51] little statement here from the Prophet
[1:09:56] this is a coming out of the message hear
[1:09:58] his voice
[1:09:59] a man hear his voice he says now you
[1:10:10] that's turned in the scriptures the
[1:10:12] first Samuel the third chapter this is
[1:10:15] how it reads for the first 10 verses
[1:10:18] says verse 1 and the child Samuel
[1:10:21] ministered unto the Lord before Eli and
[1:10:25] the word of the Lord was precious in
[1:10:29] those days there was no open vision and
[1:10:34] says oh how I would like to dwell there
[1:10:37] for a minute maybe some other time it
[1:10:40] just strikes me let me just read it once
[1:10:44] again that verse and the child Samuel
[1:10:47] ministered unto the Lord before Eli and
[1:10:50] the word of the Lord was precious in
[1:10:52] those days for there was no open vision
[1:10:56] now brother Branham goes on to say says
[1:10:58] see what a vision is then he says it's
[1:11:03] the direct word of the Lord and the
[1:11:06] Lord's word was precious I like that I
[1:11:10] like that statement a vision is a direct
[1:11:13] word from the Lord and the Lord's word
[1:11:17] was precious amen so I'm using this this
[1:11:21] title step into the vision and as we
[1:11:25] were starting this year out amen
[1:11:27] there was a number of state statements
[1:11:30] that were being made some sermons being
[1:11:32] preached we've
[1:11:32] into the year 2020 amen and look at
[1:11:36] where we are in 2020 look at how we have
[1:11:39] to have church hey man it was a it was a
[1:11:41] year of a supposed to be clear vision
[1:11:44] you know people people won't clear
[1:11:46] vision or or some people would say 2020
[1:11:49] it's perfect fishing
[1:11:50] Loreena God but I really you know it's
[1:11:53] not and I was as I was coming into the
[1:11:55] year I had an opportunity to listen to
[1:11:57] brother to send a make a few statements
[1:11:59] there over and out and in Zimbabwe and
[1:12:02] as he was talking about the year 2020
[1:12:05] says a person with 20/20 vision really
[1:12:08] has normal vision glory to God if you
[1:12:11] got 20/20 vision it's just normal vision
[1:12:14] it's it's nothing special about that so
[1:12:16] so anybody claiming that I want 20/20
[1:12:18] vision you're not asking for anything
[1:12:20] special that's what everybody else got
[1:12:23] amen amen
[1:12:24] and I'm just beginning to think about
[1:12:25] that I'm not trying to be ordinary I
[1:12:28] don't want to be just like everybody
[1:12:30] else I'm not trying to be ordinary I
[1:12:32] want to be Extra Ordinary right I don't
[1:12:35] I don't need the usual amen but what I
[1:12:39] need is God to do the unusual Laurie say
[1:12:43] I'm not trying to be the same as
[1:12:44] everybody else I actually want to be
[1:12:47] different
[1:12:48] I mean I don't want to see them natural
[1:12:51] but I'm expecting God to do the
[1:12:54] supernatural we have seen oh but the
[1:13:03] Prophet told us that when we see oh
[1:13:07] he'll turn loose then we should also
[1:13:10] expect to see Oh heaven turn loose
[1:13:14] praise God I'm looking for all heaven to
[1:13:18] turn loose God will not be outdone by
[1:13:22] the devil let's it be the name of the
[1:13:27] Lord hallelujah I'm not looking Amen I
[1:13:30] don't want to see the natural I want to
[1:13:32] see the supernatural I don't want to be
[1:13:35] average I wanna be above average I don't
[1:13:38] want to just get by I want to excel we
[1:13:42] don't want to just me
[1:13:43] expectations we want to exceed them this
[1:13:47] is a year for me a double-double 20/20
[1:13:54] double-double glory to God
[1:13:57] I'm looking for God to a double portion
[1:14:00] of his spirit a double portion of his
[1:14:03] anointing we're looking for
[1:14:05] double-double glory glory glory glory
[1:14:08] brother branham makes a statement in
[1:14:10] this message show us the father and
[1:14:12] it'll satisfy it says he can heal
[1:14:18] diabetes I love this I love this you
[1:14:23] know we were talking about this a little
[1:14:25] earlier because we have been told that
[1:14:30] most of the people that have diabetes or
[1:14:32] some other underlying conditions that I
[1:14:35] think they specifically said diabetes
[1:14:37] and high blood pressure say these are
[1:14:40] the ones that have been attacked with
[1:14:41] this virus these are the ones that's
[1:14:43] being attacked and now these are ones
[1:14:45] that are dying primarily glory to God
[1:14:48] this is what they told us and I found
[1:14:49] that quite amazing because I would think
[1:14:51] that cancer if you're dealing with
[1:14:53] cancer right now it's pretty dangerous
[1:14:55] with this virus hallelujah right but up
[1:14:59] but but we have nothing to fear amen
[1:15:02] just because that's what they say you

[1:15:09] glory to God coz I'm dwelling in the
[1:15:11] secret place all right it shall not come
[1:15:13] down my toilet

[1:15:18] what the data says says you speak
[1:15:21] against the data say what the word says

[1:15:37] high blood pressure to see these quotes

[1:16:11] can catch the vision a man he says this

[1:16:19] this is it not now you're believing now
[1:16:22] you got all the doubts move back the
[1:16:24] Christian spirit Oh glory the Christian
[1:16:31] spirit is over all the other unbelievers
[1:16:35] and if there was ever a part that we
[1:16:38] need the Christian spirit to override we
[1:16:44] need it right now if there was ever time
[1:16:47] we mean up the Lord before we sure do
[1:16:51] need him now
[1:16:52] let your Christian spirit oh you know
[1:17:04] well you know over happens most of the
[1:17:07] sisters use this when they go shopping
[1:17:09] praise the Lord you know and what
[1:17:11] happens is that you know they they buy
[1:17:13] something and and then they want to take
[1:17:15] it back and you know and maybe maybe
[1:17:17] they found something else so you know
[1:17:19] maybe it's a better deal or whatever
[1:17:21] they want to just take this thing back
[1:17:22] they got the receipt glory to God and
[1:17:25] they walk into the place with that
[1:17:27] receipt and now they don't show them
[1:17:28] never seek first they just show them the
[1:17:30] merchandise praise the Lord
[1:17:32] amen and when the clerk begins to argue
[1:17:35] back and forth Amen about well no this
[1:17:38] is not ours and you know and you can't
[1:17:40] you can't take this if we can't take it

[1:17:54] expecting to get my money back or
[1:17:56] exchanging come on somebody so so so if
[1:17:59] that clerk has a problem doing things
[1:18:02] what the sister was says like do you

[1:18:11] know look I'm not gonna waste my time
[1:18:13] talking to somebody that can't make
[1:18:14] decisions I need the manager and the
[1:18:17] reason you're asking for a manager is
[1:18:19] because you're looking for somebody with
[1:18:21] the authority a man with the ability to
[1:18:25] override what just happened if they rung
[1:18:29] up your product room you're not gonna

[1:19:13] Holy Spirit is supposed to work that's
[1:19:15] it if thou camps believe now as we talk
[1:19:20] about this stepping into the vision it
[1:19:23] just at the beginning of the year the
[1:19:25] Lord just begin to just deal with my
[1:19:27] heart and I just began to think about
[1:19:29] Lord well what vision because the vision
[1:19:32] is a direct word from the Lord what
[1:19:36] vision with the bride be able to step
[1:19:39] into what is it that you're calling the
[1:19:41] bride to in this hour you know we we
[1:19:44] have so much that we're we're hearing so
[1:19:47] many voices so many voices so many
[1:19:49] voices so many voices I mean every time
[1:19:51] you turn around somebody sending you
[1:19:53] this somebody sending you that it's one
[1:19:56] report say this another report completes
[1:19:58] with that when they say that's not gonna
[1:20:00] happen and and you just don't even know
[1:20:01] what to believe it's so many forces but
[1:20:04] what I found is that I can settle myself
[1:20:06] on two sources one is the Bible
[1:20:11] right I can look at what God said in his
[1:20:15] word and I can be satisfied I can find
[1:20:19] comfort I can find strength I can find
[1:20:21] hope I can find protection I can find
[1:20:24] whatever I need in the pages of the
[1:20:27] Bible and then my second source is God
[1:20:30] sent us a vindicated prophet and when he
[1:20:35] spoke thus saith the LORD I can rest my
[1:20:37] I can rest my weight on what the prophet
[1:20:41] said so if I'm going to share something
[1:20:43] with somebody I'm gonna share what the
[1:20:45] Bible say and I'm gonna share what the
[1:20:47] prophets say glory to God we could put
[1:20:51] our confidence in these sources now what
[1:20:54] is it that the bride could step into in
[1:20:57] the South what is it that that we can
[1:20:59] you know what is God's great vision as
[1:21:02] we look at this year this year vision a
[1:21:04] man that people declared it to be but
[1:21:06] what is it that we can can ultimately
[1:21:09] climb up into and surprise and the Lord
[1:21:11] just kind of led me to this message the
[1:21:14] perk of me in church age glory but the
[1:21:17] things that I want to read to you amen
[1:21:20] in the pergamene church age because I
[1:21:22] believe this is the ultimate vision for
[1:21:25] the people of God to come into a man and
[1:21:27] I believe this is the season for the
[1:21:29] people of God to come into this vision
[1:21:32] amen amen
[1:21:34] now before I read this I want you to
[1:21:37] understand the words that I'm about to
[1:21:39] read are not brother branham's words but
[1:21:47] brother Branham was told by an angel to
[1:21:50] pick up your pen and write so brother
[1:21:53] Branham became the scribe of what an
[1:21:56] angelic being was telling him to write
[1:21:59] and what the angel was telling him the
[1:22:01] right he says this has everything to do
[1:22:04] with the word and the bride match time
[1:22:09] for the bride to step into this vision
[1:22:10] now let's look at this we call ourselves
[1:22:13] bride what's the purpose of being bright
[1:22:16] let's look at this amen
[1:22:19] he says one night as I was seeking the
[1:22:21] Lord the Holy Spirit told me to pick up
[1:22:23] my painting
[1:22:23] right and I grasp the pen to write his
[1:22:26] spirit gave me a message for the church
[1:22:28] hey man I want to bring it to you it has
[1:22:31] to do with the word and the bright Lord
[1:22:34] it says here's what I'm trying to say to
[1:22:37] you now to Angel the Lord the Holy
[1:22:38] Spirit telling the Prophet here's what
[1:22:40] I'm trying to say
[1:22:41] now now notice he's not speaking this to
[1:22:43] the Prophet he's speaking this through
[1:22:45] the Prophet but to though to the pride
[1:22:48] this hat this message has everything to
[1:22:51] do with the word and the bride says
[1:22:55] here's what I'm trying to say to you the
[1:22:57] law of reproduction is that each species
[1:23:00] forth after some kind even according to
[1:23:03] Genesis 111 and God said let the earth
[1:23:06] bring forth grass and the herb yielding
[1:23:08] seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit
[1:23:10] after his kind whose seed is in itself
[1:23:13] upon the earth and it was so whatever
[1:23:17] life was in the seed came forth into a
[1:23:20] plant and this into fruit the very same
[1:23:23] law applies to the church to take
[1:23:26] whatever seed started the church will
[1:23:28] come forth and be like the original see
[1:23:31] because it is the same see in the last
[1:23:36] days the true bride church christ seed
[1:23:39] will come to the headstone and she will
[1:23:43] be what ain't promised now I want you to
[1:23:47] understand this is not the prophets
[1:23:49] words the angel or the Holy Spirit said
[1:23:55] this about you she will be the super
[1:24:01] church a super race and she nears him
[1:24:13] give him up because they came one time
[1:24:16] to take him away and when they came they
[1:24:18] fell back the anointed was so strong
[1:24:23] that they felt it was a shield placed
[1:24:25] around Jesus I want you to know that
[1:24:27] same seal has been placed around the
[1:24:30] Bride of Christ they can't touch you
[1:24:32] unless God allows him
[1:24:34] to control the virus King taught you
[1:24:38] let's not allows you it may look like
[1:24:44] you're surrounded but you're surrounded
[1:24:47] by him glory to God
[1:24:51] you're surrounded by promises brother
[1:24:55] when I turn it over here it says I'm
[1:24:57] gonna be healed when I turn over that
[1:24:59] says by His stripes
[1:25:01] please come wherever I turn I'm
[1:25:04] surrounded by promises so I walk through
[1:25:09] the valley of the shadow of death I will
[1:25:12] fear no evil with me my rock
[1:25:19] they comes with me let's it be the name
[1:25:23] of the Lord
[1:25:24] nothing to fear we're surrounded by
[1:25:29] Jesus Christ a host of angels we can
[1:25:45] keep drinking coffee drinking our tea
[1:25:48] just like the Prophet Elisha did she was
[1:25:54] worried what in the were you doing
[1:25:56] prophet this army is out here got you
[1:25:59] surrounded what are you doing man I
[1:26:00] ain't worried about nothing
[1:26:02] you don't see what I see i'ma tell you
[1:26:06] the world does not see what we said we
[1:26:09] are we're already reading we are let's
[1:26:11] finish way we have already read
[1:26:13] tomorrow's newspaper read - next week we
[1:26:20] need two years from now we already read
[1:26:22] ahead of time a prophet has laid it out
[1:26:25] so when it comes to pass nothing shocks
[1:26:28] us we go he said
[1:26:31] when the Prophet said is where the
[1:26:32] prophets say glory glory a man and for
[1:26:37] those of you that are waiting to come
[1:26:39] back to the Lord after California goes
[1:26:41] under I need you to understand that some
[1:26:45] things at the Prophet spoke have already
[1:26:46] come to pass the testimony recently
[1:26:49] given where his brother said that he was
[1:26:52] listening to the radio and brother
[1:26:54] Branham had told his son Billy Paul said
[1:26:56] before you become an old man you say he
[1:26:58] said Billy where you standing at this
[1:26:59] athlete preached the sermon choosing up
[1:27:01] a bride and it says it says you know
[1:27:04] brother Branham had prophesied that a
[1:27:06] particular system was going to die and
[1:27:07] if somebody stood up and in the meeting
[1:27:10] they come up and say thus saith the Lord
[1:27:12] because their norton's they're not fast
[1:27:14] the Lord you will not die but you'll
[1:27:16] live brother Ram said God had told me
[1:27:19] nothing different even that thus saith
[1:27:22] the Lord
[1:27:22] then move the prophet oh can I say this
[1:27:28] no matter if you're thus says the Lord
[1:27:31] in coming in line what the prophecy I'm
[1:27:33] not moving it's got to line over what
[1:27:37] the Prophet says I told you I got two
[1:27:40] sources two sources the Bible and what
[1:27:45] God said through a vindicated prophet
[1:27:47] blessed be the name of the Lord amen I
[1:27:50] appreciate anything else that may come
[1:27:53] along but I always go back to what the
[1:27:56] Bible said and what the Prophet said so
[1:27:59] if it don't line up
[1:28:00] you don't get no Amen that brother did
[1:28:02] not get an amen from the Prophet said
[1:28:05] God told me none different so brother
[1:28:08] brother Billy Paul went walking with his
[1:28:10] dad after that Nortec service was
[1:28:12] brother Branham prophesied that service
[1:28:14] about Los Angeles going under and
[1:28:16] choosing of a bride a prophesy so so he
[1:28:18] left a service in here it was walking
[1:28:20] Billy Paul just kind of walk himself out
[1:28:21] there north and and when it when he got
[1:28:24] got got outside he said bill the way
[1:28:25] you're standing say I'm standing loss
[1:28:28] and he said no be more specific son
[1:28:29] where are you standing
[1:28:30] he said I'm standing in front of me
[1:28:32] in Los Angeles he said before you become
[1:28:35] an old man sharks will be swimming where
[1:28:37] you stand
[1:28:39] well everybody interpreted that one way
[1:28:42] the interpretation was Los Angeles gonna
[1:28:45] go under and sharks gonna be swimming
[1:28:47] where the main building if it went under
[1:28:49] and the main building was under how
[1:28:51] would you know where the may building
[1:28:52] was standing how would you know
[1:28:57] or would you trust Google will Google
[1:29:04] tell you what Mays building was right
[1:29:06] right see you don't know so what
[1:29:09] happened and his brothers listened to
[1:29:10] the radio and he gave the testimony was
[1:29:12] - and this is what happened one brother
[1:29:14] listened to the radio and I believe
[1:29:16] either Virginia or West Virginia and
[1:29:18] there was another sister she was working
[1:29:21] in the maze building at the time and
[1:29:23] this was in the 1970s that this
[1:29:26] testimony came out this man was
[1:29:27] listening to his radio he's a minister
[1:29:29] there and in Virginia West Virginia and
[1:29:31] as he was listening to the radio he
[1:29:33] heard he heard on the radio I can't
[1:29:37] think of the guy what the radio
[1:29:39] announcer that's the rest of the store
[1:29:42] what's his name Paul Harvey he heard
[1:29:43] Paul Harvey say there's been a report
[1:29:46] that sharks are swimming in the basement
[1:29:49] of the maze building in the 70s
[1:29:52] now now at the same time there was a
[1:29:56] lady that was working in the building
[1:29:58] and she told one of her relatives we
[1:30:00] just got a letter from our CEO he says
[1:30:05] be careful don't go into the basement of
[1:30:09] the maze building because sharks are
[1:30:11] swimming and sharks have been reported
[1:30:13] to be swimming in our basement they got
[1:30:16] something exact they got a letter from
[1:30:18] the CEO at the time hallelujah
[1:30:21] now all it takes is two or three
[1:30:23] witnesses and every word is to be
[1:30:25] established whether Google got it or not
[1:30:28] we got two witnesses that say it
[1:30:31] happened Gloria God and that happened
[1:30:34] before brother Billy Paul became an old
[1:30:36] man that's why
[1:30:38] so if you're waiting on something stop
[1:30:41] waiting now is the time glory a man
[1:30:56] looking I want to keep going in this
[1:30:58] quote hallelujah hallelujah they in the
[1:31:01] bright would be so much like him until
[1:31:06] so much like him that they will be there
[1:31:08] will even be in his very image this is
[1:31:10] in order to be united with him they will
[1:31:13] be one they will be the very
[1:31:16] manifestation of the word of the Living
[1:31:18] God
[1:31:19] denominations cannot produce this wrong
[1:31:22] seed they were produced their Creed's
[1:31:24] and their dog was mixed with the word
[1:31:25] this mongrel izing brings forth the
[1:31:28] hybrid product now the reason that
[1:31:29] Christ was given a bride it was to
[1:31:32] reproduce himself it was all about
[1:31:34] reproduction that was that's the purpose
[1:31:37] of you being a bride to Christ he wants
[1:31:39] to reproduce himself inside of you let's
[1:31:42] keep reading he says the first son Adam
[1:31:44] was to spoken see Word of God he was
[1:31:48] given a bride to reproduce himself that
[1:31:52] is why the bride was given to him to
[1:31:54] reproduce himself to produce another son
[1:31:57] of God but she fell she failed by
[1:32:00] hybridization she calls him to now the
[1:32:06] first first personal Eve failed but
[1:32:09] you've been the second me do you realize
[1:32:11] you are ordained not to fall
[1:32:16] predestinated not to fall before a man
[1:32:22] this virus hit we had a spiritual virus
[1:32:26] hit glory to God you better watch God
[1:32:33] they were the spirits of violence virus
[1:32:34] hitting the land a man people stopped
[1:32:37] believing the sign and it starts
[1:32:40] sweeping the land another big church
[1:32:42] went down a man right before this virus
[1:32:45] hit already got but I'm so glad that I'm
[1:32:49] part of a people that have been ordained
[1:32:53] by God I came to this earth with a
[1:32:57] purpose and my purpose is not too far oh
[1:33:01] [Music]
[1:33:05] he came with a purpose even when God
[1:33:09] designed Eve he knew that she would fall
[1:33:12] God knew but but when she felt every
[1:33:15] attribute of God has the opportunity to
[1:33:19] be released out of cars colored but now
[1:33:22] since we have received all the
[1:33:24] attributes of God we have been ordained
[1:33:28] not too far oh I think Gough it is look
[1:33:35] at this let me go a little further the
[1:33:38] second son Jesus also had a spoken C
[1:33:43] word and remember I'm giving you what
[1:33:44] the angels saying about you I won't give
[1:33:46] all of it to you you have to read this
[1:33:48] yourself but as we're talking about a
[1:33:50] clear vision and perfect vision this is
[1:33:53] what we need to step into for this
[1:33:54] season what did the angel say what does
[1:33:57] God's vision for me here's where here's
[1:33:59] your answer right here the angel told
[1:34:01] the Prophet pick up your pen oh right
[1:34:02] he's giving you vision now look at this
[1:34:05] says the second son of Jesus also spoken
[1:34:08] C word a Word of God was given a bright
[1:34:11] like as was Adam but before he could
[1:34:14] marry her she's also she also had fallen
[1:34:16] she's like she liked Adams wife was put
[1:34:19] to the test whether she wouldn't believe
[1:34:20] the Word of God and live or doubt the
[1:34:22] word and die she doubted she left the
[1:34:25] word she died listen from a little group
[1:34:29] of the true seed of the word God would
[1:34:32] present Christ with a beloved bride she
[1:34:34] is a virgin of his word she is a virgin
[1:34:37] because she knows no man make Reaser
[1:34:39] dogmas by and through the members of the
[1:34:42] bride will be fulfilled all that was
[1:34:44] promised of God to be made manifest in
[1:34:46] the virgin let me keep going says the
[1:34:48] word of promise came to the Virgin Mary
[1:34:50] and this is important to me the word of
[1:34:54] promise came to the Virgin Mary but that
[1:34:58] word of promise was he himself to be
[1:35:01] made manifest
[1:35:02] God was made manifest he himself acted
[1:35:06] at that time and fulfilled his own word
[1:35:08] of promise in the Virgin now Oh
[1:35:11] Gloria let's let's keep reading it was
[1:35:13] an angel that had brought her the
[1:35:16] message
[1:35:17] but the Angel's message was the Word of
[1:35:20] God Isaiah 9:6 people feel at that time
[1:35:25] all that was rid of him because she
[1:35:27] accepted his word to her now let me just
[1:35:31] just just just just break into that just
[1:35:33] a little bit
[1:35:33] Mary accepted the word that was sent by
[1:35:38] an angel today we have accepted the word
[1:35:42] that has been sent by an angel glory to
[1:35:46] God amen now I love to just look at a
[1:35:49] couple scriptures because when Mary was
[1:35:52] born she came to earth with a very
[1:35:55] specific purpose and and I don't want to
[1:35:58] suggest leaving at Mary because when you
[1:36:01] were born you came to this earth with a
[1:36:03] very specific purpose your career is not
[1:36:07] your purpose amen many are losing their
[1:36:12] jobs in a time like this but if we lose
[1:36:15] our child it does not define who we are
[1:36:19] I can tell you this but even if I lose
[1:36:23] my job God will still make awake why
[1:36:27] because he said this word I will rebuke
[1:36:30] the Devourer for your sake amen I will
[1:36:35] open up the windows of heaven pour you
[1:36:38] out lessons when you have room not
[1:36:40] enough to receive not getting a check
[1:36:44] well your fake account would be sealed
[1:36:47] the reason your bank account is being
[1:36:49] filled it's because God made you a
[1:36:52] promise
[1:36:53] [Music]
[1:36:54] glory taka
[1:36:57] work look up from everywhere 315 and I
[1:37:06] was there 7:14 in a second but uh but
[1:37:08] brother Lincoln was saying how there was
[1:37:10] a brother in his church waiting
[1:37:12] believing God for job got so discouraged
[1:37:15] that he said I'm gonna just give up on
[1:37:16] my prayer I'm not even gonna ask God for
[1:37:18] anything more I'm just giving up on it
[1:37:21] and and here where everybody else is
[1:37:24] getting laid off this man was just sent
[1:37:29] a letter by Wells Fargo that they have
[1:37:33] accepted his application and they want
[1:37:36] to offer him this very good job in well
[1:37:40] Sparkle he gave up on it and God
[1:37:44] actually blessed him with the job during
[1:37:47] the virus okay cuz cuz god he just

[1:38:13] certain thing in order for you to keep

[1:38:24] well when it came to his store he did
[1:38:29] not have the title but he got another
[1:38:32] time they forgot about this title son of
[1:38:36] God
[1:38:37] [Applause]
[1:38:42] he did not have the other titles but he
[1:38:45] had the title son of God and they let
[1:38:47] everybody else go he's the only one with
[1:38:51] that title that's keeping his job
[1:38:54] [Applause]
[1:38:55] [Music]
[1:38:56] everybody trying to figure out what
[1:38:58] happened why you did this and why you
[1:39:01] get that all I can say is God's FEMA is
[1:39:06] not there
[1:39:07] [Applause]

[1:40:15] looking for heaven to turn and when all
[1:40:18] heaven empties out he has blessings in
[1:40:20] two areas
[1:40:21] he has blessings in the upper spring a
[1:40:24] lot of spiritual blessings that come
[1:40:27] down from God but he also has lessons in
[1:40:30] the nether Springs but also have a
[1:40:32] blessing to need to sustain you why you
[1:40:35] living here on earth glory to God and
[1:40:39] I'm watching God sustain his people oh
[1:40:45] yes let me keep let me keep let's look
[1:40:50] at this Mary Mary Mary came with purpose
[1:40:53] look at the scripture jim says 3:15 look
[1:40:57] at this I will put enmity between thee
[1:41:02] and the woman and between thy seed and
[1:41:03] her seed initiative bruise thy head and
[1:41:06] thou shalt bruise his heel
[1:41:07] now this scripture was was was was was
[1:41:09] produced after Adam and Eve failed after
[1:41:13] Adam did what he did that God came down
[1:41:15] said Adam where art thou and he went
[1:41:17] looking through the garden for for Adam
[1:41:19] and Eve and you know they come with this
[1:41:20] new revelation of dressing themselves
[1:41:22] and fig leaves and things like that so
[1:41:23] where you get that from who told you
[1:41:25] that you was naked who told you that
[1:41:27] so you say I'll never use language like
[1:41:29] that they had a new newt oh my god I
[1:41:32] fell in sin but it was an opportunity
[1:41:34] for God's attributes to go to work
[1:41:36] God knew exactly what he was doing but
[1:41:38] here he wrote a promise in Scripture he
[1:41:41] says I will put enmity between thee and
[1:41:43] the woman and between thy seed and her
[1:41:45] seed and if Sir Bruce I had him thou
[1:41:47] shalt bruise his heel over in Isaiah
[1:41:50] 7:14 this a promise is added on to a man
[1:41:54] God gives a little bit more information
[1:41:56] it says therefore the Lord himself shall
[1:42:00] give you a sign
[1:42:01] behold a virgin shall conceive and bear
[1:42:06] a son and his and shall call his name
[1:42:09] Immanuel so if there was a young lady
[1:42:12] that rose up and said I'm a virgin
[1:42:16] I have conceived and God's gonna give me
[1:42:18] a baby now if she come out with a
[1:42:20] daughter you know she wasn't fulfilling
[1:42:22] this you know she would first of all she
[1:42:25] was lying in the first place right but
[1:42:28] what we were looking for is a virgin
[1:42:31] that would conceive and bear a son so
[1:42:34] when the word was spoken even in Genesis
[1:42:37] and the word was Amen spoken again in
[1:42:41] Isaiah the word went out like this
[1:42:45] hallelujah the word just was circling
[1:42:48] the earth waiting for the right time
[1:42:51] that the woman would come along and
[1:42:53] catch this fish and when she caught it
[1:42:58] she would step into it hallelujah
[1:43:01] I want you to know that what I just read
[1:43:03] to you Amen that came from an angel came
[1:43:05] from the Holy Spirit that word had been
[1:43:07] circling waiting for people to come to
[1:43:11] the earth amen that will respond the
[1:43:14] same way
[1:43:15] Mary respond these people would say I've
[1:43:17] never heard anything like this but be it
[1:43:21] unto me according to that words
[1:43:25] do you realize when you say a man to the
[1:43:28] word because that is what mary did
[1:43:30] married mayor said mayor say now what my
[1:43:33] what matter salutation says how is this
[1:43:35] going to happen I don't know man
[1:43:36] she had very good question haha they say
[1:43:39] the Holy Spirit new language never heard
[1:43:43] that in her church before Holy Spirit
[1:43:45] the priest is not talking anything like
[1:43:48] that the Holy Spirit will overshadow you
[1:43:51] and you will conceive she said being
[1:43:53] unto me according to that word she said
[1:43:55] look this name I promise this st. Joseph
[1:43:58] promise this is what you promised me so
[1:44:00] be it unto me according to what you
[1:44:02] Jesse when Mary agree with the words
[1:44:06] brother Adam even said that that's what
[1:44:08] that's what actually brought the life
[1:44:10] when she said a man it brought life when
[1:44:16] you can say a man to God's Word stop
[1:44:18] fighting it and just say a man is gonna
[1:44:22] bring life I wrote this down this week
[1:44:27] miracles will occur when we say a man
[1:44:35] hallelujah miracles will happen because
[1:44:38] we said a man to the word Oh blessed be
[1:44:42] the name of the Lord right I mean if you
[1:44:45] don't believe it go back to the story of
[1:44:47] Hattie right Hattie right
[1:44:50] what had no money it was a depression
[1:44:53] Lori to God and here she gave a little
[1:44:55] money to Amanda that the building fund
[1:44:58] and in glory
[1:45:02] [Applause]
[1:45:04] she gave a last to the building fund
[1:45:07] brother Brandon was on the way back to
[1:45:10] give the money Oh sister had he
[1:45:11] shouldn't do that and in the god god I
[1:45:13] had to say now did I tell that I stopped
[1:45:16] the widow from giving her last well
[1:45:18] don't you stop Harry right hallelujah
[1:45:20] but now he did not tell the Prophet that
[1:45:22] he had a blessing for Hattie right he
[1:45:24] say just don't stop right now just going
[1:45:27] down to the house and visit they got
[1:45:29] down there start eating and and while
[1:45:31] they're eating the Holy Spirit came into
[1:45:33] the place
[1:45:34] Laurie brother Brandon was sharing about
[1:45:36] how to squirrel say he created squirrels
[1:45:39] hey man there was no squirrel but he
[1:45:41] spoke in the squirrel came into
[1:45:43] existence had it right as she heard that
[1:45:46] now think about this think about this
[1:45:47] you sitting in your house a man walks in
[1:45:51] and says you know what I just created a
[1:45:53] squirrel how would you think I would you
[1:45:58] be really thinking thank God that
[1:46:07] provided a rare for Abraham is the same
[1:46:10] guy he put it back in Scripture is the
[1:46:12] same God that provided a squirrel for me
[1:46:15] I weren't thinking about no squirrel I
[1:46:18] was looking for the squirrel this is the
[1:46:20] problem we sit around thinking about
[1:46:27] what we gonna do how this thing works
[1:46:32] I mean God has to inspire you God has
[1:46:37] the anoint you brother brandon was not
[1:46:40] thinking about a squirrel God just
[1:46:42] brought it to him what are you here
[1:46:44] hunting hunting squirrels he say have
[1:46:48] you ever considered this scripture if
[1:46:50] you say to the mountain be louder
[1:46:52] looping our peanut Cassady don't tell me
[1:46:53] how you can have what you say yeah I
[1:46:55] considered but I'm afraid to preach it I
[1:46:57] don't even know nothing about say have
[1:46:58] you considered that scripture what are
[1:47:00] you hunting and then brought the
[1:47:02] scripture and his experience together so
[1:47:05] now when he preached it he can talk he
[1:47:07] can really appreciate it works in each
[1:47:08] that you do but it was not sitting
[1:47:12] around meditating on this
[1:47:14] when you're swimming when you and you
[1:47:16] when you are in the right channel I can
[1:47:19] actually send something your way but who
[1:47:21] trying to make it happen it'll never
[1:47:23] happen you gotta wait on the even
[1:47:30] the Prophet told us that he could not do
[1:47:33] things before the vision paint a mentor
[1:47:36] in and to order everything had to be in
[1:47:40] place they went everything was in place
[1:47:43] then he can step in watch God manifests
[1:47:47] himself which is when he said that the
[1:47:52] the same God that provided for Abraham a
[1:47:55] ram is the same God that provided me the
[1:47:57] squares and say that's nothing but the
[1:47:58] truth because she sent a man to that he
[1:48:03] said tell to Haddie right now whatever
[1:48:07] she asked for she can have and you know
[1:48:12] what had he did Haley looked around said
[1:48:15] what should I ask for
[1:48:17] you can't the Prophet can tell you what
[1:48:20] to ask for you have to do this on your
[1:48:22] own mama can't tell you what to ask for
[1:48:25] you have to do this on your own daddy
[1:48:28] can't tell you what the ass with you got
[1:48:30] to do this on your own
[1:48:31] had it looked around sick she was poor
[1:48:33] she could actually no I said you acts
[1:48:35] with money right now I guarantee you of
[1:48:37] their many your sisters over here sick
[1:48:40] you can pray I mean you can act mother
[1:48:42] she we don't pray for a minute time
[1:48:43] she's never been heal but I guarantee if
[1:48:45] you acts for her she'll be him had he
[1:48:49] thought about it mama
[1:48:50] mom and daddy they little water bodies
[1:48:52] of war out and but mama love Jesus daddy
[1:48:57] loved Jesus my sister loved Jesus and
[1:49:00] what that what she said they have found
[1:49:02] a way to be content in the state in
[1:49:06] which they're in but my boys I'm
[1:49:09] concerned about these books God want to
[1:49:13] know are you concerned about your love
[1:49:15] that if God was to place this question
[1:49:18] in your lap what would be your response
[1:49:21] don't don't try to be a man the richest
[1:49:24] man in the world
[1:49:25] you won't be able to spin it all before
[1:49:26] the action and somebody else gonna get
[1:49:29] it you just meet God to meet your needs
[1:49:33] look at the card it's okay to have him
[1:49:36] meet your needs and live a little bit
[1:49:38] all right you know what I'm saying I
[1:49:39] believe that alone
[1:49:40] but I had to say I want the salvation
[1:49:44] and then she had them she had to word it
[1:49:46] perfectly because if she would've said I
[1:49:49] won the salvation of one boy she would
[1:49:51] only got one boy
[1:49:52] I won the salvation up to my two boys
[1:49:57] immediately because she said a man she
[1:50:00] received a blessing the Lord dropped
[1:50:07] something in my spirit and I'm speaking
[1:50:09] this before it happened I cannot speak
[1:50:11] at all but I'm gonna speak some of the
[1:50:13] God dropped something to my spirit I was
[1:50:15] reading my Bible this week and as
[1:50:17] Scripture I ran into and and when I when
[1:50:19] I when I when I ran into the scripture
[1:50:21] the Lord said send this to so and so I
[1:50:23] say okay Lord that's exactly what I'm
[1:50:25] gonna do and I sent the script over say
[1:50:28] just what the Lord told me and and went
[1:50:30] and went and we're not when I sent it
[1:50:31] they responded back amen hallelujah when
[1:50:35] they said a man then the Holy Spirit hit
[1:50:37] me again and it said miracles will occur
[1:50:40] because we say a man to the word imma
[1:50:47] say that again miracles will occur
[1:50:49] because we say a man to the word Larry
[1:50:54] responded with an a man had a right
[1:50:58] responded with an a man the person I
[1:51:01] sent it to responded with in a man Mary
[1:51:04] had a manifestation handy right hand a
[1:51:08] manifestation we're looking for three
[1:51:12] Oh glory all right let me go on a little
[1:51:18] further that's a man hey man I'll come
[1:51:23] back and explain it more later
[1:51:26] glory glory glory now let me just go a
[1:51:29] little further here because we're
[1:51:31] talking about stepping into this vision
[1:51:33] thank you Jesus let's go back to Genesis
[1:51:37] 21 we read here we read here Genesis 21
[1:51:42] says him the Lord visited Sara as he had
[1:51:46] said and the Lord did unto Sarah as he
[1:51:50] had spoken now
[1:51:51] destruct me as I read this the Lord
[1:51:54] visited Sara as he had said and the Lord
[1:51:57] did unto Sarah as he had spoken now a
[1:52:01] few chapters before this God came to
[1:52:05] Abraham and Sarah down into the tent
[1:52:08] glory three angels visit but it's God
[1:52:11] and two angels that came to visit and
[1:52:13] gave Abraham a promise that Sarah's wife
[1:52:16] was going to have a son and and Sarah
[1:52:18] was sitting in the tent laughing he said
[1:52:20] why is Sarah laughing and he revealed a
[1:52:22] secrets of what was going on in the tent
[1:52:24] but when God came in Genesis 18 to visit
[1:52:28] Abraham and Sarah I want you to notice
[1:52:31] he came in the body of a man and visited
[1:52:35] Abraham and Sarah and gave them the
[1:52:37] promise but when it came time for the
[1:52:40] manifestation the Bible says that the
[1:52:44] Lord visits there this time he did not
[1:52:46] come in the body of a man but he came as
[1:52:50] spirit you see it's the spirit that
[1:52:55] gives us life it's a spirit that
[1:52:58] quickens us and changes our condition
[1:53:00] you know it was the spirit that got
[1:53:03] Jesus out the Great Jesus spoke certain
[1:53:07] things amen you say destroy this temple
[1:53:09] and in three days I'll raise it up when
[1:53:11] Jesus went to the grave
[1:53:13] it took the Spirit of God to go and
[1:53:16] connect with the promise of God and
[1:53:18] bring it to pass Mary was overshadowed
[1:53:21] with the Spirit
[1:53:24] Sarah was overshadowed with the spirit
[1:53:28] the bride to make these promises come to
[1:53:31] pass will be overshadowed with the
[1:53:34] spirit and she will be the super Church
[1:53:38] the super race she will be oh that God
[1:53:42] said she'll be you seeing Genesis 21 it
[1:53:48] was no longer a promise in Genesis 21
[1:53:52] they had moved from the state of promise
[1:53:55] to manifestation and what I believe this
[1:53:58] is a season for the church to move from
[1:54:01] just a promise to now the manifestation
[1:54:04] of what was written on the expectation
[1:54:07] I'm claiming it for this season double
[1:54:10] double double double glory glory glory
[1:54:19] glory glory glory amen God will visit us
[1:54:23] in different ways he came in as a man
[1:54:26] the first time but he sent His Spirit to
[1:54:28] bring it to pass and I believe the
[1:54:30] Spirit of God is gonna come and bring
[1:54:32] this back bring it every promise that he
[1:54:33] meets us to pass Mary when she said Amen
[1:54:36] it was the spirit that caused that to
[1:54:38] come to pass
[1:54:39] Mary didn't have anything to do with it
[1:54:40] Oh God wanted her to do is yield all God
[1:54:43] wants you to do is you all right let me
[1:54:47] just look at a couple other things this
[1:54:50] a man oh all right yes I do I want to
[1:55:00] read this this is out of crisis the
[1:55:01] mystery of God revealing glory glory
[1:55:06] glory glory amen
[1:55:10] the word is in the bride as it wasn't
[1:55:12] married they man she's ordained not to
[1:55:15] fall look at this now that Christ is a
[1:55:17] mr. Garvin who says the church is the
[1:55:19] blood of Christ by the Spirit
[1:55:24] because the life is in the blood
[1:55:27] that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:55:29] step baptize it's asking to his body
[1:55:31] that recognizes only his body as flesh
[1:55:34] his word denomination won't never touch
[1:55:37] that and I just love you know brother
[1:55:41] Branham what kind of talk of
[1:55:42] denomination would never produce this
[1:55:43] the denomination it doesn't matter how
[1:55:45] many members they have if you're still
[1:55:47] feasting after the army Chelsea you
[1:55:48] could never manifest what gripe like
[1:55:50] what God is looking for and brother
[1:55:53] Branham said you know he says what a
[1:55:55] resurrection that was but what a
[1:55:57] resurrection this is do you realize that
[1:56:00] if you were in denominational churches
[1:56:02] and you came out to this message that
[1:56:05] you have already experienced the
[1:56:07] resurrection and that's why I say what a
[1:56:11] resurrection this is you have already if
[1:56:13] you were in a man in the world in a
[1:56:16] world of sin we all came into this world
[1:56:18] speaking last but if you was in a world
[1:56:19] of sin and you come out and you hearing
[1:56:21] this message you have already been
[1:56:23] resurrected brother Adam say your
[1:56:25] resurrection lays in you now oh and he
[1:56:30] sent the same way Jesus had power to
[1:56:33] raise himself up guess what you have
[1:56:35] power to raise yourself up that's what
[1:56:38] he said I ran it this morning
[1:56:39] hallelujah and if you got powned raise
[1:56:41] yourself up that means stop crying
[1:56:47] speaking move oh yes the power is
[1:56:50] already in you and I'm waiting oh
[1:56:52] nothing they make it's already in you so
[1:56:56] use what you got
[1:57:00] glory use what you got the spoken word
[1:57:04] is in you use it Church all right glory
[1:57:07] glory glory look he says the best
[1:57:12] baptism Holy Ghost that baptizes us into
[1:57:14] it into his body that recognizes only
[1:57:16] his body his flesh his word it says
[1:57:18] denomination will never touch that it's
[1:57:21] a revelation she knows it so didn't even
[1:57:23] know it but she fell but this one knows
[1:57:26] it and won't fall she even knew it and
[1:57:30] she fell we know it and won't fall look
[1:57:33] at he says she is ordained
[1:57:36] hallelujah whoo she is ordained to not
[1:57:41] fall she won't fail as I tell you I come
[1:57:45] with a purpose that word went around
[1:57:48] waiting for Mary to come here to drop
[1:57:50] down into marriage because God had
[1:57:52] already had in his mind who was gonna be
[1:57:55] the fulfillment of genesis 3:15 isaiah 7
[1:57:58] i was there not he already had this my
[1:58:00] network was waiting on Mary and it when
[1:58:04] Mary got here word came before she could
[1:58:06] get married to Joseph engaged before she
[1:58:10] could get married word had to drop down
[1:58:14] God had to bring it to pass before she
[1:58:17] got married hey man and then and then on
[1:58:21] top of that you know cuz Joseph when he
[1:58:23] heard this that was strange think about
[1:58:25] it not think if you was Joseph and Mary
[1:58:28] comes to you to say now Joseph I'm
[1:58:31] pregnant
[1:58:31] Joseph and meeting up there now who did
[1:58:34] this well it wasn't Mary what's going on
[1:58:36] here well let me tell you as the angel
[1:58:38] came to me I said amen to the word and
[1:58:40] he said the Holy Spirit Elish out of me
[1:58:42] and I'm pregnant Mary I love you but I
[1:58:47] don't think I would be able to go with
[1:58:49] this story so the Bible say Joseph was
[1:58:51] primarily thinking about putting her
[1:58:52] away but what God had to do is come to
[1:58:56] Joseph and give him a dream and when God
[1:58:59] gave him a dream the dream actually took
[1:59:02] him back to the word you go study the
[1:59:04] dream the dream took him back to work
[1:59:06] and when he saw it in the word it's 70
[1:59:08] spirits so what I want you to understand
[1:59:10] is that when God gives you a
[1:59:11] supernatural experience it will settle
[1:59:14] you you are Dane not to fall
[1:59:21] she won't fail she is predestinate - it
[1:59:24] blesses a man who got will not impute
[1:59:26] sin your ministers know what I'm
[1:59:28] speaking of when there's a couple dozen
[1:59:30] of you sitting here see blessed is the
[1:59:32] man who God will not impute sin David
[1:59:35] now I want to just kind of bring out a
[1:59:38] little testimony here a man I was
[1:59:44] looking at this a man I was listening to
[1:59:50] take wisdom versus faith and in there
[1:59:53] brother Branham was giving us a
[1:59:55] testimony about Welch Evans Welch Evans
[2:00:00] had a situation where he went to church
[2:00:02] and while he was there in church he
[2:00:05] brought the car and and while he was
[2:00:08] there you know in church somebody stole
[2:00:11] Welch Evans car and and took it and left
[2:00:14] him here here he is having no way to get
[2:00:17] back home he but he had to drive a long
[2:00:18] way to get back home he wasn't right
[2:00:20] around the corner he says everything was
[2:00:22] in the car and luggage and all that and
[2:00:23] this man has gone with the car so he
[2:00:26] just didn't know what to do Welch Evans
[2:00:28] was a little concerned so they went and
[2:00:30] they they the brothers when it found
[2:00:31] brother Brown said brother branham you
[2:00:33] know Rhoda brother Welch's carbon stole
[2:00:35] while he was at church and I just think
[2:00:36] that's something that the devil would
[2:00:37] tried them Wow they at church
[2:00:41] that's a bold devil that you at church
[2:00:44] and I mean if there if there's any safe
[2:00:46] place it should be Church but the devil
[2:00:48] would come and try it even in church
[2:00:50] right so here we'll talk like I don't
[2:00:53] know what to do
[2:00:53] he said random say let's pray let's pray
[2:00:55] let's pray and as you know right before
[2:00:58] they were praying the word quickened to
[2:01:00] the Prophet and and the scripture says
[2:01:04] if you ask anything in my name if you
[2:01:06] abide in me and my words abide in you
[2:01:10] ask what you will and it shall be done
[2:01:13] that quicken to the prophet so he prayed
[2:01:16] according to the scripture and said
[2:01:18] while he was a man praying a vision came
[2:01:21] and he saw the man that had toast on the
[2:01:24] he saw the man turn the car back
[2:01:26] around come and park it get out and
[2:01:28] leave it there he said conviction came
[2:01:30] on the man he brought the car back he
[2:01:32] say brother whilst you're gonna get your
[2:01:33] car the vision actually told him that he
[2:01:36] was going to get the car all brother
[2:01:38] Welch had to do is go where the vision
[2:01:40] ship said go and he went get the car
[2:01:42] that's exactly what he did he received
[2:01:44] his car but brother Branham said a
[2:01:48] couple other things
[2:01:48] say the reason that this man brought the
[2:01:52] car back he says because we sent the
[2:01:54] word after him the word was if you abide
[2:01:58] in me and my word about and you asked
[2:02:01] what you will so what I'm asking for is
[2:02:03] bringing the car back in the name of
[2:02:07] Jesus so that's what I'm asking in the
[2:02:09] neighborhood he said because the man had
[2:02:12] something on the end he said a man used
[2:02:14] to be a Christian and it's that sense he
[2:02:16] used to be a Christian the word has
[2:02:18] something to attach to and condemnation
[2:02:21] was Ceti and and caused the man to turn
[2:02:24] around and come back according to the
[2:02:29] vision but he had to step into the
[2:02:31] vision in order to give the car brother
[2:02:35] well chat another situation come up this
[2:02:38] time brother branham made a statement
[2:02:41] here and wisdom versus faith in in and
[2:02:44] and and I think I want to read this
[2:02:48] starting at paragraph 344 I want to read
[2:02:51] this one Oh says come back and said some
[2:02:58] man bought a car from him this is same
[2:03:00] brother Welch Evans he slipped off and
[2:03:02] didn't pay it now this man stole another
[2:03:04] car from brother he was selling the car
[2:03:06] the man supposed to pay him but the man
[2:03:08] slipped out without paying Oh
[2:03:11] even during this time if somebody done
[2:03:15] stole something from you God will make
[2:03:18] him bring it back
[2:03:21] even during the time this time you can
[2:03:25] expect it even now they not working but
[2:03:29] they stole it from you God will make him
[2:03:32] bring it back watch this now
[2:03:37] glory glory since he slipped off and
[2:03:40] didn't pant say brother branham I
[2:03:42] thought the poor man told him $400 I
[2:03:44] said I pray I sent the word the word
[2:03:46] went got on his track found him oh he
[2:03:53] says when we went down to find the man
[2:03:56] he never Christian see he laughed they
[2:03:59] asked him go to church one time he said
[2:04:01] Wow while the preachers preaching I'll
[2:04:03] look for pretty blonds so you see you
[2:04:06] can't find yet that's the devil that's
[2:04:09] so the word couldn't hold on to him
[2:04:12] write the word could not latch on to
[2:04:14] this man because he had a different
[2:04:16] spirit but what brother branham say the
[2:04:18] word didn't latch on to him the word
[2:04:19] just follow him you can take that down

[2:07:10] tell him it was a vision brother Welsh
[2:07:13] had to catch it and step into it brother
[2:07:17] Raymond said now this is the type that
[2:07:19] he used this is the type that you said
[2:07:23] he said when Jesus went down to the
[2:07:27] grave of Lazarus oh yes Lord Jesus he
[2:07:30] says when he went down there to the
[2:07:32] grades of grave of Lazarus he says how
[2:07:34] he was even just kind of having a
[2:07:37] conversation with the disciples telling
[2:07:38] us that now let's go because our Lazarus
[2:07:41] sleepeth and we got it going on we got
[2:07:43] it going
[2:07:44] Carrodus and the disciples say
[2:07:46] night-night now he's sleeping let's just
[2:07:48] leave him alone
[2:07:48] don't don't wake him up let the man get
[2:07:50] some good sleep he said say no we got it
[2:07:53] going we gotta take care of something
[2:07:54] Jesus just leave look let me tell you
[2:07:57] something
[2:07:58] Lazarus is he any say say I go to wake
[2:08:09] so so so jesus said now you know a head
[2:08:13] a man down there to the city where we're
[2:08:15] landed now he's already four days late
[2:08:17] this thing seemed impossible this thing
[2:08:21] seemed like it would never happen
[2:08:23] Oh glory tuk cop I don't care what
[2:08:25] you're facing now it may seem impossible
[2:08:28] but it's not as impossible as Mary
[2:08:31] having a baby amen and being a virgin
[2:08:34] it's not as impossible as Peter the
[2:08:37] Great for four days and rising again if
[2:08:40] those things can happen anything Jesus
[2:08:48] was on his way to see Lazarus because of
[2:08:51] a vision now there were certain things
[2:08:53] in this vision that had to be set in a
[2:08:56] certain way before it would manifest see
[2:08:59] brother Branham helped us to see
[2:09:01] scripture in this light things had to be
[2:09:03] sent a certain way before things would
[2:09:05] manifest when God gave him dishes
[2:09:08] already got here Jesus goes down tell
[2:09:13] the disciples I go to wake him now when
[2:09:15] he got down there oh I love the story
[2:09:17] when he got down there they were still
[2:09:19] mourning Martha and Mary was still in a
[2:09:23] state of mourning but when Martha heard
[2:09:25] that Jesus was in town Martha decided it
[2:09:31] was a personal decision that I'm gonna
[2:09:34] get up from my situation and I'm gonna
[2:09:38] go to where Jesus is hallelujah
[2:09:41] if there's anybody can change things
[2:09:43] Jesus came so she said I'm leaving where
[2:09:47] I'm at I'm gonna stop mourning with you
[2:09:50] Mary
[2:09:51] I gotta go see Jesus and Martha come up
[2:09:54] and she got to Jesus and she just
[2:09:56] beginning
[2:09:56] say something oh can we just read it in
[2:09:59] Scripture oh let's go to Charlie Levin
[2:10:02] Oh hallelujah oh yes yes yes yes I like
[2:10:08] this
[2:10:09] amen amen he says I burst Twitter their
[2:10:12] mother as soon as she heard that Jesus
[2:10:16] was coming we didn't met him but Mary
[2:10:19] sat still in the house I want to tell
[2:10:22] you got two options you can either get
[2:10:24] up and go meet Jesus or you can sit
[2:10:27] still in the condition that you in I
[2:10:29] want to encourage you get up from where
[2:10:32] you act and go meet Jesus how do you get
[2:10:36] up from your defeat get up from your mom
[2:10:38] now get up from your sickness get up and
[2:10:41] go meet Jesus
[2:10:43] glory to God holy then said moth unto
[2:10:47] Jesus Lord has been here my brother had
[2:10:54] not died because even though she's going
[2:11:02] through this this this time of grief she
[2:11:05] still declares her faith amen and
[2:11:08] sometimes what we gotta do is believe us
[2:11:11] it's continue to declare our faith no
[2:11:14] matter what it is that we're up against
[2:11:16] she says but I know that even not
[2:11:21] statements when Coronas all over the
[2:11:25] planet not just not just in and in the
[2:11:30] United States but the UK is all locked a
[2:11:33] man in China spit on a lockdown
[2:11:35] they bent down enough in Australia they
[2:11:37] lock down South Africa Oh lock down the
[2:11:40] whole planet
[2:11:42] it's a lockdown but even whatsoever that
[2:11:49] will ask of God God will give it thee
[2:12:06] what's your faith in the mystery of
[2:12:08] pandemic Mazel begin to declare fishes I
[2:12:11] know that even now whatsoever that will
[2:12:13] ask of God God will give it thee now
[2:12:16] look at this Jesus said unto her thy
[2:12:19] brother shall rise again now now here's
[2:12:21] the problem Martha is looking at these
[2:12:25] words as future tips but Jesus is trying
[2:12:29] to get her to see no no no no no this is
[2:12:31] present tense I'm gonna talk about
[2:12:33] tomorrow I'm talk about God sent me here
[2:12:36] by a vision to actually bring him forth
[2:12:38] now look at this
[2:12:40] he says Martha said to him I know that
[2:12:42] he shall rise again in the resurrection
[2:12:44] at the last day
[2:12:46] jesus said unto her I am the
[2:12:51] resurrection so the resurrection is a
[2:12:54] person the person of the Lord Jesus I am
[2:12:58] the resurrection and the life and he
[2:13:00] that believeth in me though he were dead
[2:13:03] yet shall live now notice Jesus had not
[2:13:05] died but yet he claimed to be the
[2:13:08] resurrection you get that Jesus had not
[2:13:13] died but yet he claimed to be the
[2:13:15] resurrection guess what you have not
[2:13:17] died but you have experienced a
[2:13:20] resurrection when you came out of the
[2:13:24] world you experience the resurrection
[2:13:26] when you came a man out of
[2:13:28] denominationalism you experience the
[2:13:30] resurrection amen
[2:13:31] when you've been defeated in your spirit
[2:13:33] just like Joel was in his spirit Joe
[2:13:36] received a resurrection Peter received a
[2:13:39] resurrection you have received and are
[2:13:41] receiving a resurrection not rather not
[2:13:44] just what a resurrection that was but
[2:13:47] what a resurrection this is I am the
[2:13:51] resurrection and the life he that
[2:13:54] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[2:13:56] shall he live and whosoever liveth and
[2:13:58] believeth in me shall never die
[2:14:00] and he left it with a question believe
[2:14:04] us how this
[2:14:08] and I love this next verse she said unto
[2:14:10] Him
[2:14:11] yay Lord that's all got me to here
[2:14:14] I believe that thou art the Christ the
[2:14:17] Son of God which had come into the world
[2:14:21] now
[2:14:21] the scriptures say we're gonna stop
[2:14:23] right there in reading but the
[2:14:24] scriptures say that he went away and she
[2:14:26] called her sister secrets that you know
[2:14:28] the math to come Mary Mary married a
[2:14:31] master come and he called it for you so
[2:14:34] this meant you know now that mountain
[2:14:36] married man Mary made a decision
[2:14:38] i'ma stay here and I'm gonna just keep
[2:14:40] crying you see when we do this penny
[2:14:44] wants a party Peter wants a party but
[2:14:50] Jesus didn't actually go to Mary Mary
[2:14:52] had to come to him and and and pretty
[2:14:55] much on the way to him she has to shake
[2:14:58] herself from the condition that she says
[2:15:00] because if you want to see a miracle you
[2:15:03] have to shake yourself out of the
[2:15:05] condition or the mindset that you're in
[2:15:07] in order to see the miracle now in this
[2:15:10] vision that Jesus had he was going to
[2:15:14] wake our Lazarus the vision was already
[2:15:17] shelter he was going to wait laughter
[2:15:19] now the problem is there was a couple
[2:15:21] people that had to do something they had
[2:15:24] to be in placed in division they had to
[2:15:26] find their place and step into this
[2:15:28] vision if you want to see your brother
[2:15:30] raised again here's what I need you to
[2:15:32] do now he never told them this oh he
[2:15:35] says it's Mary Martha roll the stone
[2:15:40] away not right now brother branham say
[2:15:45] Jesus could have rolled the stone away
[2:15:48] Jesus could have smoked the stone away
[2:15:51] they could have had some other brothers
[2:15:53] help them out to get the stone rolled
[2:15:55] away but that was not Jesus part of the
[2:15:58] vision that was not the other brothers
[2:16:00] part of the vision this was Mary and
[2:16:03] Martha part of the vision I don't care
[2:16:06] how you struggled with the stone roll it
[2:16:10] away
[2:16:14] you see the scripture action tells us
[2:16:17] that there are some things that we have
[2:16:19] to lay aside it didn't say God was gonna
[2:16:22] deliver us from it
[2:16:23] he say lay aside every sin and weight
[2:16:27] that so easily perception so we have to
[2:16:30] do some things ourselves
[2:16:32] maybe there's a storm of depression
[2:16:34] that's getting your life you roll it
[2:16:36] away rather than maybe there's a stone
[2:16:39] of a man of oppression roll it away
[2:16:41] maybe there's a stone of disappointment
[2:16:44] you roll in a way roll it away when they
[2:16:56] rolled a stone the way we saw a
[2:17:00] resurrection Jesus said Lazarus come
[2:17:08] forth and when Jesus spoke that brother
[2:17:11] branham told say if he had not called
[2:17:13] Lazarus by his name he said everything
[2:17:17] that was in the grief because the
[2:17:20] resurrection was standing pressing
[2:17:22] present tense was 10 right he said if he
[2:17:24] didn't call as if I mean everything in
[2:17:27] the Greek would have got up a man that
[2:17:32] was dead for four days
[2:17:33] came out in the green and experienced a
[2:17:37] resurrection I don't know how long
[2:17:39] you've been dealing with your situation
[2:17:40] I don't know how long you've been
[2:17:42] dealing with your circumstance but you
[2:17:45] can come forth on this Easter Sunday and
[2:17:47] have your own personal resurrection what
[2:17:50] you need to do is step into the vision
[2:17:54] God richly bless you
[2:17:57] [Applause]
[2:18:07] let's have a word of Prayer
[2:18:14] father
[2:18:17] we thank you for this Easter time
[2:18:22] thank you God that you've given us so
[2:18:24] much to look forward to their promises
[2:18:29] that have been given through the angel
[2:18:31] of the Lord directly to us your prophet
[2:18:35] wrote it down and gone here we have it
[2:18:38] in our in our in our hands a gear of
[2:18:41] vision but the ultimate vision that we
[2:18:45] could step in to Lord is what you
[2:18:46] declared through your prophet for us
[2:18:48] this message is follow is about the word
[2:18:51] and the bride
[2:18:53] help us to recognize who we are Lord to
[2:18:58] walk in the fullness of it - they meant
[2:19:02] to accept it
[2:19:03] we were ordaining not to fall so many
[2:19:09] have come with this and with that but
[2:19:12] God our eyes are on this on what you've
[2:19:14] said through your prophet we're not
[2:19:16] we're not turning in and even he said to
[2:19:20] us Lord that the bride will only do
[2:19:24] pretty much what the Spirit is revealed
[2:19:26] to her to do no nobody else can make her
[2:19:28] do otherwise that only what God has told
[2:19:30] her to do that's what she gonna do and
[2:19:33] God we're holding fast to this word
[2:19:35] we're standing on it scripture tells us
[2:19:38] that heavens and earth will pass away
[2:19:39] but the word will remain forever we're
[2:19:44] standing on the word god I pray your
[2:19:48] blessing is upon the Saints Lord that
[2:19:50] have tuned in to hear the word of the
[2:19:51] Lord today and God we just we just
[2:19:54] appreciate you for ministering to our
[2:19:57] hearts and the technology that has been
[2:19:59] given to us Lord for the word to go from
[2:20:01] from just through through the airwaves
[2:20:05] these are these dimensions Lord that we
[2:20:08] were using the Prophet told us about it
[2:20:11] this dimension of science technology
[2:20:15] Laurie say these things were here even
[2:20:17] during the days of Adam and I was just
[2:20:20] thinking to myself the way that we're
[2:20:22] doing service and streaming it is a very
[2:20:25] similar to what the Prophet was doing
[2:20:27] when he was here on earth when he
[2:20:28] preached it was the rising the Sun he
[2:20:30] had people connected via
[2:20:32] the telephone and they would hear the
[2:20:35] word of God through the airwaves of the
[2:20:37] telephone and Oh God now that we can go
[2:20:40] beyond the telephone and we can use the
[2:20:42] Internet
[2:20:43] I am quite sure the Prophet would have
[2:20:45] been doing the exact same thing at a
[2:20:47] time like this so we thank you for
[2:20:49] technology the Lord our prayer in our
[2:20:52] desire is that some they really soon
[2:20:55] that we can all be able to come together
[2:20:56] for fellowship we how we just love to be
[2:20:59] in one another's presence how we enjoy
[2:21:02] it oh God just shaking each other's
[2:21:03] hands and and being able to give a hug
[2:21:06] Lord it just means so much as things
[2:21:08] that we take for granted but God it
[2:21:10] means so much to us
[2:21:11] we pray your blessings a man upon the
[2:21:13] Saints there in the UK upon brother
[2:21:16] whispered Amen sister Gwyn Oh Lord just

[2:21:48] you know there is one place of safety
[2:21:52] and that is found underneath the blood
[2:21:55] of the Lord Jesus Christ and his brother
