[59:07] I could say it's time to jump in so we
[59:10] were under a man under under expectation
[59:14] a man sister was sharing a dream with me
[59:19] that the Lord had given her and I won't
[59:23] breathe the dream I just kind of give
[59:25] you the highlights but it was a dream as
[59:27] if we were going to a meeting someone
[59:33] was gonna preach and we were headed
[59:35] towards this meeting and you know we all
[59:37] jumped in a car and we got there to the
[59:39] meeting and it's pretty big
[59:40] you know the preacher that was becoming
[59:43] everybody wanted to come here so we got
[59:46] in the car had to park in the parking
[59:47] lot but the parking lot was so big that
[59:49] we had to get like a trolley to ride up
[59:53] to the building where to preach was
[59:54] preaching and you know so as we got
[59:58] Charlie there was another may have
[59:59] jumped on the trial again I guess he was
[1:00:02] kind of scratching himself and it seemed
[1:00:04] like he had a
[1:00:06] a disease there he was dealing with sort
[1:00:09] of sister saying I think you you got
[1:00:10] this
[1:00:11] you know what you named a disease that
[1:00:13] he had and and he like yeah yeah you
[1:00:18] know and we went on to the meeting when
[1:00:20] we got there it was brother branham
[1:00:22] preaching and so brother Brandon
[1:00:25] preached and the man that jumped in the
[1:00:27] trolley with us for the brand I'm
[1:00:29] happened to call him out and his
[1:00:31] condition now and say it's gonna be
[1:00:34] alright you're healed he said that's all
[1:00:35] I needed to hear
[1:00:36] so all I need to hear he said he walked
[1:00:39] away from there believing that he was
[1:00:40] ill but her sister said she had in her
[1:00:43] heart she just wanted to get brother
[1:00:45] Brandon detention she just you know I
[1:00:47] just love to talk to him if I could and
[1:00:50] when she had a heart she she loved eyes
[1:00:54] and maybe and you know pretty much kind
[1:00:58] of he was inviting her to come on over
[1:01:00] you know so she was making her way with
[1:01:02] somebody coming a little kid got in
[1:01:04] front of her there little girl got in
[1:01:06] front of him you know and everything and
[1:01:08] you know the girl got for the grade of
[1:01:09] detention so she just kind of waited and
[1:01:11] when the girl walked away then she went
[1:01:13] up and she be getting the cover
[1:01:14] it'll just gets converse for the Branum

[1:08:30] a man just turn with me in your Bibles
[1:08:33] we'll read a scripture I want to thank
[1:08:36] the Lord for all the specials that went
[1:08:38] forth amen on today certainly appreciate

[1:08:43] that the worship as well
[1:08:46] amen yes you know we just we just
[1:09:01] appreciate the Lord I have a little
[1:09:04] thought here that I want to share with
[1:09:06] you all today is I would say it's gonna
[1:09:08] be somewhat evangelistic a man in nature
[1:09:12] and but I pray to be a blessing to you a
[1:09:16] man as we just kind of share from a
[1:09:18] heart so I'm today amen everyone
[1:09:21] standing that can stand as we read the
[1:09:23] word of the Lord
[1:09:25] a man Romans chapter 6 Romans chapter 6
[1:09:30] a man and verse 23
[1:09:46] romans 6 and verse 23 very familiar
[1:09:49] scriptures for the wages of sin is death
[1:09:52] but the gift of God is eternal life
[1:09:56] through Jesus Christ our Lord so the
[1:10:00] wages of sin you get paid for sin
[1:10:02] right you get paid for it a man and your
[1:10:07] payment is death right which is which
[1:10:11] which means eternal separation a man
[1:10:15] from God the wages of sin is death but
[1:10:18] the gift of God is eternal life through
[1:10:19] Jesus Christ our Lord and also over here
[1:10:22] in Hebrews chapter 9 verse 22 speaks
[1:10:33] this a man says and almost all things
[1:10:37] are by the law purged with blood and
[1:10:41] without shedding of blood there's no
[1:10:43] remission Amen the Lord had a blessing
[1:10:46] to the reading of his word let's just
[1:10:47] pray Amen over what we've read here
[1:10:49] today father we thank you for your word
[1:10:58] that we've read but now God let the Holy
[1:11:02] Spirit take us a little deeper into the
[1:11:04] thought that you want to present to us
[1:11:05] today God get glory and get honored a
[1:11:09] man out of everything that'll be shared
[1:11:13] and Lord we know the enemy would love to
[1:11:16] try to distract us so that we can't hear
[1:11:18] what the Spirit is trying to speak to us
[1:11:20] but father we we ask that that you would
[1:11:25] just give us power to overcome the
[1:11:27] faults of the enemy and even now God as
[1:11:31] your son here on earth we take control
[1:11:34] over the atmosphere we take control over
[1:11:37] every thought we take control over
[1:11:40] everything God that Satan would try to
[1:11:42] do to prevent us from receiving from you
[1:11:45] we're here God to hear from heaven speak
[1:11:49] now Lord is our desire our prayer and
[1:11:54] god we we also just want to pray maybe
[1:11:58] somebody's getting a blessing this
[1:12:00] morning Lord next-door and just pray
[1:12:03] that you would just do something special
[1:12:04] form and and the most important thing
[1:12:07] that could ever happen is bring people
[1:12:08] to the knowledge of truth so Lord let us
[1:12:11] be a light amen in the midst of all that
[1:12:14] is around us Oh God let us be a light
[1:12:16] with cream so Jesus name we ask it
[1:12:20] amen amen god bless you can be seated
[1:12:34] there's a little thought that I have
[1:12:37] here in my heart that I wanna I want to
[1:12:42] share we want to title this a man this
[1:12:45] morning settle it a man settle it a man
[1:12:52] and I pray that the Lord will just bless
[1:12:54] us as we journey through this let me
[1:12:57] just take my time a man building us to
[1:13:01] where we want to go here I want to read
[1:13:04] from this this this sermon a man oneness
[1:13:08] this sermon oneness the Prophet makes a
[1:13:11] statement here and it says now when we
[1:13:14] see this see the penalty must be paid
[1:13:20] and this is the this is the part that I
[1:13:23] really want to kind of drive home the
[1:13:24] penalty the penalty must be paid and
[1:13:28] this uh this is actually the penalty for
[1:13:30] sin okay it must be paid and note the
[1:13:35] highest form of animal life is a human
[1:13:37] being and the human being fail itself so
[1:13:41] how can one human save another this is
[1:13:44] important because it wasn't Adam that
[1:13:48] redeemed Eve amen
[1:13:51] Adam could not redeem her he fell in sin
[1:13:53] so he could not redeem her he was a type
[1:13:55] of a man of Christ leaf thrown in Laura
[1:14:00] coming down a man to bring us redemption
[1:14:02] story he who was sinless became
[1:14:06] sin that what me we might become
[1:14:08] righteous right but but there was a
[1:14:11] penalty that had to be paid because of
[1:14:14] sin because of what Adam did in the
[1:14:16] garden there was a penalty for sin that
[1:14:19] had to be paid it had to be settled and
[1:14:21] only Christ could do to do the settling
[1:14:24] for us right so he said so one human so
[1:14:26] how can one human save another and take
[1:14:28] in God and God and spirit cannot die so
[1:14:32] God had to bring his self a little lower
[1:14:34] than the Angels Hebrews the first
[1:14:36] chapter the first verse had to make his
[1:14:39] self lower than the Angels in order to
[1:14:42] take death to pay the penalty to bring
[1:14:45] the oneness between man and God again so
[1:14:48] the Holy Ghost could come back right say
[1:14:50] the debt of sin was paid Jesus had to do
[1:14:54] this sin the Holy Ghost back to punt to
[1:14:57] unite people again like it was in the
[1:14:59] Garden of Eden the debt was paid when
[1:15:01] Jesus died I love that the debt was paid
[1:15:04] when Jesus died that settled it right
[1:15:09] amen brother
[1:15:10] if I could only get it to Sookie and see
[1:15:13] the dentist paid hallelujah to the lamb
[1:15:16] the debt is paid and every man and woman
[1:15:18] hear me this morning or will hear me by
[1:15:21] the tape your penalty is paid a man
[1:15:25] don't you disbelieve God's Word again I
[1:15:28] love that your penalty is paid don't you
[1:15:33] disbelieve God's Word again all right
[1:15:37] said come back to the word don't it says
[1:15:39] don't believe he he was the word glory I
[1:15:41] feel like shouting he says I honest I do
[1:15:46] you say the penalty is paid it's all
[1:15:49] over
[1:15:50] no wonder angel screamed and saying the
[1:15:53] anthems of heaven ring out yes sir the
[1:15:56] lost sheep was found appropriation was
[1:15:59] made for him to be restored again the
[1:16:01] waters the separation God's word that
[1:16:03] washes him from his iniquity when the
[1:16:06] word died in my place and was
[1:16:08] resurrected again and became a man
[1:16:11] permanent in my life in my heart amen
[1:16:14] the penalty is paid it's over we are
[1:16:17] redeemed
[1:16:19] I love that see that you know there was
[1:16:22] a the depth of sin had to be settled and
[1:16:25] only one that could do it was the Lord
[1:16:27] Jesus and you know as I was thinking on
[1:16:29] this a man little thought here and all
[1:16:33] honesty this thought was given to me

[1:26:20] say and she just got in the car she
[1:26:24] moved on but she planted a seed and when
[1:26:27] that lady planted that seed inside of me
[1:26:29] I say Lord you know I found a way to get

[1:26:50] things for me hallelujah I would tell
[1:26:53] you something you ought to have a stake
[1:26:55] driven down Amen as to where things got
[1:26:58] settled in your life and that man I am
[1:27:01] NOT going back to seeing not willfully
[1:27:04] oh come on somebody it's one thing when
[1:27:09] you get tripped up or somebody if you
[1:27:10] get tripped up your repent quick but but
[1:27:14] when you willfully go back in and out of
[1:27:16] sin something that's not settled Jesus
[1:27:20] has not become your absolute
[1:27:23] can we go a little further you know I
[1:27:26] think we need to preach it like this
[1:27:27] sometime to a man I think people you
[1:27:30] know cuz we got a lot of up and down
[1:27:32] Christians a man in and out Christians
[1:27:34] glory to God amen and God want to set us
[1:27:37] something look you got the paper for
[1:27:39] seeing amen and not now if you if you if
[1:27:42] you if you won't accept what Christ has
[1:27:44] done for you they may he's already paid
[1:27:47] the price but he wants you to live
[1:27:48] according to his word you got to settle
[1:27:51] this thing listen before you leave Earth
[1:27:55] your debt for sin has to be settled
[1:27:59] going to church won't settle it but
[1:28:02] truly accepting Christ as your Savior
[1:28:04] will settle it alright and I wrote this
[1:28:07] also when when Christ has become your
[1:28:10] TrueNorth a man then you know that
[1:28:13] things are settled with God's when it
[1:28:15] becomes your TrueNorth and see what
[1:28:17] happens like with a hunter a man of
[1:28:21] people that countered well you know they
[1:28:23] aren't they're a hunting or maybe just
[1:28:25] they like nature whatever they
[1:28:27] understand things they understand about
[1:28:29] a true north right and when you lost you
[1:28:32] looking for a true north and the way
[1:28:34] that sometimes they find that true north
[1:28:36] is they would go on a particular side of
[1:28:38] the tree that certain moss that would
[1:28:40] grow on that side of the tree and once
[1:28:42] they once they kind of rub their hand on
[1:28:44] that Mouse take know exactly which
[1:28:46] direction to go into hallelujah amen you
[1:28:49] got to know that you lost a man without
[1:28:52] God you are lost I don't care what you
[1:28:56] accomplish in this life you're a lost
[1:28:58] and at the end you gonna have to settle
[1:29:00] it all right now Romans 3 Twitter's
[1:29:06] safer says this for all have sinned and
[1:29:08] come short of the glory God so we all
[1:29:10] need the settlement for all have sinned
[1:29:13] and come short of the glory of God
[1:29:14] another thing in from Psalms 51 and
[1:29:17] verse 5 says behold I was shapen in
[1:29:20] iniquity and in sin did my mother
[1:29:22] conceive me that means you came out of
[1:29:24] your mother's womb lost you're gonna
[1:29:26] need to settle it I don't care who your
[1:29:28] mama is I don't care who your daddy is
[1:29:31] you got to settle some things with God
[1:29:33] hey man Psalms 58 and three
[1:29:36] says the wicked are estranged from the
[1:29:38] womb they go straight as soon as they be
[1:29:40] born speaking lies hallelujah so you
[1:29:45] were shaped in iniquity born and sin
[1:29:47] came into the world speaking lies you
[1:29:51] need to settle some things with God
[1:29:54] hallelujah I was just looking at a
[1:29:57] couple things that I want to just kind
[1:29:58] of share here oh my god this is let me
[1:30:01] go to the message and an inside
[1:30:04] I'm sorry divine love divine love let's
[1:30:06] go to this message divine love oh my god
[1:30:09] it says when God seen the sin of this
[1:30:12] world and seeing that man was dying
[1:30:15] without hope and could not be saved and
[1:30:18] yet he knows that man would love him
[1:30:20] extreme gods he says and it proved his
[1:30:24] nature God's nature is love God is love
[1:30:28] and it's trained God's nature until he
[1:30:31] had to provide a way of escape but for
[1:30:34] those who want to escape all right it
[1:30:37] constrained God to provide a way of
[1:30:41] escape for those who want to escape all
[1:30:44] right and he sent his son to the world
[1:30:46] made in the likeness of sinful flesh to
[1:30:49] bear our sins in sickness to Calvary GUP
[1:30:52] did it the love of God going out call
[1:30:55] for Sovereign Grace and God never said
[1:30:57] if you'll do it if you'll do this I'll
[1:31:00] do this God without any conditions he
[1:31:04] sent his son to die in your place and
[1:31:07] settle the same question had nothing to
[1:31:10] do with what you think about it Amen God
[1:31:14] did it anyhow amen
[1:31:15] divine love and when you're straight in
[1:31:18] when you're strange Sovereign Grace has
[1:31:21] to take its place that's all there is
[1:31:23] when divine love jet love just sets at
[1:31:26] the right place and brother branham just
[1:31:28] kind of saying you know you get yourself
[1:31:29] to a little Jam where you strain a man
[1:31:31] God has depth the kind of interact into
[1:31:33] your situation let you know what he's
[1:31:34] already done you don't have to carry
[1:31:36] that burden of sin more hallelujah you
[1:31:40] can settle things today glory to God let
[1:31:43] me go in a little further an ensign he
[1:31:45] says Adam really expressed that says the
[1:31:48] first man on
[1:31:50] after finding that he had fallen from
[1:31:52] grace he tried to take his own
[1:31:55] intelligence and make a way back to God
[1:31:57] without an atonement amen
[1:32:01] he tried to go back to God without
[1:32:02] making an atonement something to pay for
[1:32:06] his sins
[1:32:07] after the penalty of God was death he
[1:32:11] tried to go back without a death
[1:32:12] atonement and men are still trying to do
[1:32:16] that trying to make a religion without
[1:32:19] an atonement in it
[1:32:21] Oh hallelujah can I just be honest with
[1:32:25] you God don't only want your money
[1:32:29] because we try to do this without an
[1:32:31] atonement amen
[1:32:32] yea God God does require for us pay our
[1:32:35] tithes and offerings and things like
[1:32:36] that but often we think just because we
[1:32:39] give God our tithes and offerings that
[1:32:41] we've done enough that's not gonna
[1:32:43] settle it a man you gotta have to accept
[1:32:46] the blood atonement that happened at
[1:32:49] Calvary and you're gonna have to walk
[1:32:51] underneath that I told man you're gonna
[1:32:53] have to live underneath that atonement
[1:32:57] 24/7 living under the atonement
[1:33:01] hallelujah somebody right he'd say he
[1:33:04] said he tried to go back to God without
[1:33:06] making an atonement something to pay for
[1:33:09] since after the penalty of God was death
[1:33:12] he tried to go back without a death or
[1:33:13] told me man I'm still trying to do that
[1:33:16] trying to make a religion without an
[1:33:18] atonement in it
[1:33:19] amen Adam made himself a covering out of
[1:33:23] fig leaves and I was just listening to
[1:33:25] her brother a man on last night he says
[1:33:29] see those those fig leaves a man made up
[1:33:32] made of covering but jesus didn't make a
[1:33:35] covering at Calvary Jesus actually
[1:33:37] brought forgiveness hallelujah not just
[1:33:41] the covering it's forgiveness of what
[1:33:43] you've done right and at first you got
[1:33:45] to admit that you're wrong the gods
[1:33:47] hallelujah admit that you're on the God
[1:33:49] when you can admit that you're wrong
[1:33:51] then God can do something for you right
[1:33:53] he said he say but he say it wasn't it
[1:33:55] wasn't just a covering a man but it was
[1:33:57] forgiveness and when you when you
[1:34:00] actually have forgiveness oh my
[1:34:02] the reason that you want forgiveness is
[1:34:04] because once you receive it it shows
[1:34:06] that it can never be a man it could
[1:34:09] never be brought against you anymore
[1:34:11] a covering is still there but
[1:34:15] forgiveness is go amen it is deleted
[1:34:19] it's forgotten about you want to receive
[1:34:21] forgiveness of your sins not just a
[1:34:24] covering for your sins you need
[1:34:27] forgiveness for your sins
[1:34:31] hallelujah the debt must be paid
[1:34:35] alright let's go on a little further
[1:34:37] here he says and man I'm still trying to
[1:34:40] do that trying to make a religion
[1:34:41] without an atonement in it Adam made of
[1:34:43] stuff recovering out of fig leaves with
[1:34:45] no blood shed for his covering and God
[1:34:48] refused him and he has refused he has
[1:34:50] refused it then he will always refuse it
[1:34:53] because without the shedding of blood
[1:34:55] there is no remission of sins he just
[1:34:58] can't get back because the penalty is
[1:35:01] death and something has to die to pay
[1:35:04] that penalty so it can it can only be a
[1:35:07] substitutionary or we're all in death if
[1:35:09] there wasn't a substitute for us to hold
[1:35:11] on to and man and doing this realize
[1:35:14] that he needs something to hold on to
[1:35:16] something that he can put his hands on
[1:35:18] something he can say that's it I've got
[1:35:21] it
[1:35:21] I know it's it and I'm gonna tell you
[1:35:24] you got to come to a spot in your own
[1:35:26] Christian life where you know what that
[1:35:28] it that when when you say that's it we
[1:35:30] got to know I got that relationship with
[1:35:32] Jesus and I know that I've settled
[1:35:35] things amen and once you know that it's
[1:35:38] been settled with the Lord my god
[1:35:41] amen it's a certain way that you carry
[1:35:43] yourself and like I said at the
[1:35:46] restaurant you know you somebody you
[1:35:48] found that somebody than paid for you it
[1:35:50] creates an excitement it creates a joy
[1:35:53] it creates a man of peace my God hear
[1:35:56] you thinking man I was gonna be out a
[1:35:58] lot of money no no no it's already
[1:35:59] settled it's already taken care of and
[1:36:03] and and I remember one time I actually I
[1:36:06] you know I I paid for somebody's meal
[1:36:09] when I told you cash you don't let him
[1:36:12] know who did it don't let him know who
[1:36:13] did I just you know I said I just I just
[1:36:15] want to be a blessing to
[1:36:16] so I paid for the milling and I just sat
[1:36:18] there and I kind of looked at the color
[1:36:21] of my iron when I did I saw the guy just
[1:36:23] counting the cash she walked on him say
[1:36:25] it's already paid for I saw him just
[1:36:26] kind of jump up start looking around
[1:36:28] like who did it he was excited to know
[1:36:33] who he wanted to know who did that he I
[1:36:36] mean he could he could now it's like he
[1:36:38] couldn't leave the restaurant until he
[1:36:41] knew who would make a sacrifice like
[1:36:44] that right who would paid a price for me
[1:36:46] and I tell you what well if we have that
[1:36:49] type of experience in a natural
[1:36:51] restaurant why can't we have the same
[1:36:53] type of excitement looking a man to
[1:36:55] express our thanks to a god that would
[1:36:58] go to a cross and die for our sins
[1:37:02] Amen we we ought to be in a spot where
[1:37:05] we can't wait to get to church just to
[1:37:08] worship Him and praise Him because we
[1:37:11] know that he's the one that settled it
[1:37:12] for us
[1:37:13] my debt was too great to pay if you
[1:37:20] think about where God has brought you
[1:37:22] from your debt was too great to pay but
[1:37:26] Jesus Christ has paid it all oh I'm so
[1:37:31] glad he settled it I'm so glad he
[1:37:34] settled it now let me just kind of you
[1:37:36] know just kind of drop in to a couple
[1:37:39] things here I want to tell you how we
[1:37:41] are living in a time where sin is on the
[1:37:43] ramp on this rampage let's read
[1:37:46] something over here in Genesis you know
[1:37:49] the Bible actually tells us as it was in
[1:37:51] the days of Noah so shall it be in the
[1:37:53] coming of the Son of Man as it was in
[1:37:56] the days of life so shall it be in the
[1:37:58] coming of the Son of Man now I'm gonna
[1:38:00] pick up here in Genesis 6 and I'll just
[1:38:04] hold on one second there I'll give you
[1:38:06] the verse in a second but you know I
[1:38:09] when we just kind of think about as it
[1:38:14] was in the days of Noah saying that
[1:38:15] reached to rampage I mean I mean reach
[1:38:18] reached a threshold where God just could
[1:38:21] not do any more with man only thank God
[1:38:25] could do was destroy a man and what was
[1:38:28] happening is that the
[1:38:29] people were actually paying for their
[1:38:32] sins when they when they are when they
[1:38:34] refuse to get on the boat right they
[1:38:36] refused the way that God had made for
[1:38:39] them in that hour they had to pay for
[1:38:41] the sin that was being committed on the
[1:38:43] earth right so so what I want you to
[1:38:46] understand is that if it was if the
[1:38:48] promise is as it was in the days of Noah
[1:38:51] so shall it be in the comments on the
[1:38:52] man men today will pay for their sin
[1:38:56] hallelujah men they will pay for their
[1:39:01] sin let's look at it because the
[1:39:03] conditions in Noah's day with match
[1:39:06] conditions of today let's look at
[1:39:09] Genesis 6 verse 11 oh my god hallelujah
[1:39:15] amen look at this verse 11 the earth
[1:39:18] also was corrupt before God amen and
[1:39:23] just look at these words the reason that
[1:39:26] God wanted to destroy the the man from
[1:39:29] the earth in North Day is because the
[1:39:31] earth became corrupt before God a man
[1:39:34] not only that the earth was filled with
[1:39:36] violence now you tell me they say in a
[1:39:39] world
[1:39:39] Amen where we see violence every
[1:39:41] everywhere violence I mean I mean you
[1:39:44] can't turn you can't go nowhere without
[1:39:47] seeing violence you're afraid to go
[1:39:49] Christmas shopping huh because of the
[1:39:52] violence that's out there you have no
[1:39:54] idea what people do to you

[1:39:59] you for cutting them off in traffic now
[1:40:02] I didn't cut you off I had my blinker on
[1:40:04] for five minutes I didn't cut you off
[1:40:09] right but because of the love the Bible
[1:40:12] say the love of many has wax cold Amen
[1:40:17] people don't care anything about life
[1:40:18] anymore right hey hallelujah if this is
[1:40:22] not I mean everywhere you turn and I
[1:40:25] forget I forget what the stat is but

[1:42:22] it's the truth in it hi sin has reached
[1:42:25] our ultimate a man seeing this it's I
[1:42:29] mean it's just impossible for God not to
[1:42:33] destroy somebody gonna pay for this you
[1:42:38] know brother Brad was talking about a
[1:42:40] little story this this man he had called
[1:42:43] him in he's a rancher and he had sheep
[1:42:47] on his farm and he says you know as he
[1:42:50] was out they said now those cheap costs
[1:42:51] money he makes money off till she saying
[1:42:53] one morning one morning he goes out
[1:42:55] there monks of sheep and a lot of them
[1:42:57] are dead and he realized what happened
[1:43:00] that lion had got in in the night inside
[1:43:02] the pen and just destroyed some of those
[1:43:04] sheep brother branham said you know it's
[1:43:06] unfortunate but because the man lost
[1:43:09] about $3,500 in one night he said the
[1:43:12] other lions had to pay for it come on
[1:43:17] somebody when things go wrong in your
[1:43:19] house and you know you know parents that
[1:43:22] have more than one child a man you know
[1:43:24] some time to cheer the kids got another
[1:43:26] sibling in the house and that simply is
[1:43:29] I don't know so the sibling I don't know
[1:43:35] where we give birth to I don't know
[1:43:38] right if it's so many of y'all this has
[1:43:41] happened in the house somebody gonna get
[1:43:44] it somebody gonna have to settle this

[1:43:52] gonna get my belt come on somebody right
[1:43:56] but somebody gotta pay for this thing
[1:43:58] and then a lying spirit get amongst the
[1:44:01] children and the lying spirit come and

[1:44:11] hallelujah somebody see you when you
[1:44:14] don't let things get I mean and when you
[1:44:16] get that I don't know thing what what
[1:44:18] typically happen what happened in my
[1:44:20] house okay since nobody know everybody
[1:44:26] right since nobody know everybody gets
[1:44:30] it come on somebody hallelujah glory to
[1:44:34] God glory to God see things have to be
[1:44:37] settled at some point in time you just
[1:44:39] can't keep getting away with what you're
[1:44:41] doing you got to settle this thing let's
[1:44:45] look at this in Scripture again because
[1:44:46] Genesis 6 gives us a really really good
[1:44:49] Amen illustration a picture of what
[1:44:51] we're looking at in this day the earth
[1:44:52] also was corrupt before God when the
[1:44:56] earth was filled with violence and God
[1:44:58] looked upon the earth and behold it was
[1:45:00] corrupt for all flesh had corrupted his
[1:45:02] way upon the earth now notice that this
[1:45:06] there was only a few people that God
[1:45:08] actually gave grace to because everybody
[1:45:09] else was corrupt the ones that he gave
[1:45:12] grace to was knowing his family
[1:45:13] everybody else was corrupt think about
[1:45:16] that he says says God looked upon the
[1:45:18] earth and behold it was corrupt for all
[1:45:20] flesh had corrupted his way upon the
[1:45:23] earth look at verse 13 and God said unto
[1:45:26] Noah the end of all flesh is come before
[1:45:29] me for the earth is filled with violence
[1:45:31] a man threw filled with violence through
[1:45:34] them and behold I will destroy them with
[1:45:37] the earth now you know if the scripture
[1:45:42] tells us that as it was in the days of
[1:45:44] Noah so shall it be in the coming of the
[1:45:46] Son of Man we see the same signs of
[1:45:49] violence all over the earth we see sin
[1:45:51] amen has reached its peak some of the
[1:45:54] stuff that people do nowadays it's
[1:45:55] unbelievable a man the truth and a half
[1:45:59] you know brother Branham talked about
[1:46:00] some of the sins that happened in his
[1:46:02] day he talked about how you know
[1:46:04] husbands and wives would go to a hotel
[1:46:07] amen and hear a husband and his wife
[1:46:10] going to a hotel with other husbands and
[1:46:13] wives and then they just start throwing
[1:46:15] names in a cup this is what the Prophet
[1:46:18] talked about in his day said he thought
[1:46:19] through our names in the cup and then
[1:46:21] the wife would actually reach in and
[1:46:23] pull the name either cup and whatever
[1:46:25] name she got like the cup is the person
[1:46:27] she had to go into the room with her
[1:46:29] husband taking his wife to something
[1:46:31] like that that is pathetic not 60 years
[1:46:37] ago
[1:46:39] imagine what people do or nowadays huh
[1:46:42] glory to God we know sinners have an
[1:46:46] all-time high
[1:46:47] people got a creative things that you
[1:46:49] were never even imagined going on in
[1:46:52] their life somebody gonna settle this
[1:46:55] thing somebody gonna settle this thing
[1:46:59] somebody gonna pay for this and I'm
[1:47:04] advising you if I'm telling you Jesus
[1:47:06] has already paid for anything that
[1:47:09] you've done there's not one thing you
[1:47:11] can do where God can forgive you of it
[1:47:14] but you got to accept it let's go on a
[1:47:19] little further my God my God you know
[1:47:22] even in the days of Joshua where sin had
[1:47:25] reached a peak Joshua had to stand up
[1:47:27] and say to Jesus day whom you gonna
[1:47:28] serve that thing had to be settled right
[1:47:31] a man in the days of lot Senate reached
[1:47:34] its peak and and and God just couldn't
[1:47:37] take no more
[1:47:38] he sent investigating angels of judgment
[1:47:40] down in the days of lot and when they
[1:47:42] come down to see all the sin that was
[1:47:44] happening amen on the earth at that time
[1:47:45] my god it had to be settled and God
[1:47:48] rained fire and brimstone down from
[1:47:50] heaven and to and wiped that city out
[1:47:52] because of the sin somebody gonna pay
[1:47:55] for the sin alright I think God in the
[1:47:59] human race God put something in place
[1:48:04] hallelujah somebody's got to pay God set
[1:48:07] the penalty but I don't not only did he
[1:48:09] set the penalty he paid the penalty
[1:48:11] that's what grace does for us right he
[1:48:14] set the penalty then he comes along and
[1:48:15] he pays the penalty and you know and
[1:48:18] what he put in place for us there in in
[1:48:23] the Book of Jeremiah
[1:48:24] you know we saw where you had to have a
[1:48:26] kinsman redeemer also in the Book of
[1:48:27] Ruth where it showed that they had they
[1:48:29] had to have a kinsman redeemer if a man
[1:48:32] got himself in trouble glory to God the
[1:48:35] Levitical law showed that if he got
[1:48:37] himself in trouble
[1:48:38] and-and-and-and and he needed somebody
[1:48:40] not a good thing about this is that you
[1:48:43] couldn't just have your friend pay for
[1:48:45] you hallelujah
[1:48:47] hey man you can have your BFF take care
[1:48:51] of this for you
[1:48:52] glory to God amen amen you can have just
[1:48:56] an acquaintance take care of this price
[1:48:59] for you amen
[1:49:01] according to the vehicle law you had to
[1:49:03] have somebody that was blunt relation Oh
[1:49:06] glory to God if they have any blunt
[1:49:09] relation in order to take care of this
[1:49:11] anybody else that would show up to try
[1:49:13] to take care of your debt amen would be
[1:49:16] denied but if somebody that was blood
[1:49:18] related to you showed up then the debt
[1:49:21] would be settled hallelujah and it just
[1:49:24] showed that we mean it to have a god
[1:49:26] that was related to us by blood that's
[1:49:28] why he took on the flesh of Jesus Christ
[1:49:31] so he could die in our stead and once
[1:49:35] once he has died and presented it to God
[1:49:37] it has been accepted we don't have to
[1:49:42] die for that no more church let me just
[1:49:45] let me just show you something brother
[1:49:46] Branham made the comment he says it says
[1:49:48] the kinsman redeemer the kinsman
[1:49:51] redeemer our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:49:52] Christ a man he settled the thing for us
[1:49:55] all we got to do is accept it and I'm
[1:49:59] here today doing everything I can to
[1:50:01] encourage you to accept what God has
[1:50:04] already done for you don't leave this
[1:50:07] church today with the thing unsound if
[1:50:11] you try to leave a restaurant with
[1:50:12] things unsettled what happens what
[1:50:17] happens you might find you might find
[1:50:20] some lights you know coming right behind
[1:50:23] you and tell me let me let me just also
[1:50:26] just let you help you understand we're
[1:50:28] never light so coming up behind you it's
[1:50:30] not a good feeling it's not a good
[1:50:34] feeling but but one day you you realize
[1:50:36] the demons of Hell might be coming up
[1:50:38] behind you and when you get to that
[1:50:41] point it won't be a good feeling because
[1:50:44] you had an opportunity to settle it but
[1:50:47] you tried to run from it you gonna pay
[1:50:49] either now or later but you gonna pay
[1:50:56] let me go on a little further the the
[1:51:00] brief between the seven churches in the
[1:51:02] seven seals it's time to settle this
[1:51:03] thing Oh glory to God
[1:51:06] actually let me I want to go to the
[1:51:09] manifestation of the spirit you're gonna
[1:51:11] have to settle this thing glory to God
[1:51:14] okay I can take you to the spot where I
[1:51:16] settle a man a minute you all have the
[1:51:20] same type experience you knew that Lord
[1:51:22] this is it I've made my confession and
[1:51:24] it's the last one I'm making praise God
[1:51:27] look at this manifestation of the Spirit
[1:51:29] he says now when Jesus died at Calvary
[1:51:31] he says he sent up the sink question
[1:51:33] forever before the Father because he was
[1:51:35] a perfect sacrifice for our sin he was
[1:51:38] our kinsman redeemer you Bible scholars
[1:51:41] know what I'm speaking of like Boaz he
[1:51:43] had to be a kinsman redeemer to redeem
[1:51:45] the loss of state of Ruth and he had to
[1:51:47] make a public testimony and then
[1:51:50] everything that Ruth had failed to him
[1:51:53] as he redeemed all of her possessions
[1:51:55] and he of course he got when he redeemed
[1:51:58] Naomi why he got Ruth in which is a type
[1:52:02] of the Gentile bride and so forth but he
[1:52:04] was a kinsman redeemer now God who is in
[1:52:08] spirit availed himself in a body of
[1:52:10] flesh which was his son Christ Jesus and
[1:52:13] God was in Christ reconciling the world
[1:52:16] to himself and become kinfolks to human
[1:52:18] beings to suffer the penalty that he had
[1:52:21] put on human himself and he became
[1:52:23] kinfolks and a redeemer in other words
[1:52:26] like this we was put in the devil's pawn
[1:52:30] shop and Jesus paid the price and
[1:52:34] brought us out see the price was already
[1:52:39] paid now when Jesus died at Calvary he
[1:52:42] saved every sinner in the world ever
[1:52:44] would be in the world as far as God was
[1:52:47] concerned listen now you wasn't saved
[1:52:50] ten years ago or two years ago or three
[1:52:53] years ago I wasn't saved seventeen years
[1:52:56] ago I was saved 2000 years ago but I
[1:53:00] accepted it 17 years ago so you were
[1:53:05] saved when Jesus died at Calvary but the
[1:53:08] question is have you accepted it in
[1:53:10] order to settle it now Jesus didn't come
[1:53:15] come down and digest for me or digest
[1:53:18] for you he said of the sink
[1:53:20] but it'll never do us any good until we
[1:53:22] accept it you know what if some people
[1:53:24] is just a good story and I'm not here
[1:53:27] just to tell you a good story I'm here
[1:53:28] to tell you need to settle this thing
[1:53:30] I've seen I've been around Church way
[1:53:33] too long to see people in and out up and
[1:53:35] down you know sometimes got the victory
[1:53:37] sometimes so defeat it hey man you know
[1:53:40] some you can even while I'm preaching
[1:53:43] this sermon right now there's people
[1:53:44] named mine thinking about okay about two
[1:53:46] weeks from now I'm giving up where you
[1:53:50] get that thought from you already you
[1:53:53] know someone's got it mapped out when we
[1:53:56] gonna fall that's a shame before God you
[1:54:00] got this thing already mapped out okay
[1:54:03] I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do damned it
[1:54:04] and then WHAM that's it and you know
[1:54:06] where you go through with your plans I'm
[1:54:08] trying to warn you in Jesus name
[1:54:11] settle it today said early make me make
[1:54:15] make a make a decision once and for all
[1:54:17] I'm gonna serve God and I ain't doing
[1:54:19] nothin else
[1:54:21] hallelujah everybody gotta come to that
[1:54:24] place going to church ain't settled in
[1:54:26] it huh paying your tithes ain't settling
[1:54:30] it I'm talking about a real commitment
[1:54:32] cuz if you got a real commitment to God
[1:54:34] you'll pay your tithes anyway a man
[1:54:36] giving her offering that's not settling
[1:54:37] it huh I mean I'm talking about really
[1:54:40] giving your heart to Jesus you know time
[1:54:44] of my life
[1:54:45] glory to God you know I remember my
[1:54:47] pastor pull me to the side one time and
[1:54:49] you know I was going to church I was
[1:54:51] doing all those things but he pulled me
[1:54:53] to the side one time and he asked me a
[1:54:54] question say when you gonna give all
[1:54:55] your heart to Jesus when you're gonna
[1:55:01] give all your heart to Jesus not wanna
[1:55:03] ask the same question to you today when
[1:55:06] you're gonna give all your heart to
[1:55:08] Jesus oh it ain't good enough just to
[1:55:12] say you believe the message it ain't
[1:55:15] good enough just to say you believe a
[1:55:16] prophet
[1:55:16] you know people learn the lingo and you
[1:55:20] can talk the lingo you can do all that
[1:55:22] but your life is a wreck and the reason
[1:55:26] that it's a wreck is because things are
[1:55:28] not settled hallelujah at some more time
[1:55:32] you got to come to a conclusion
[1:55:34] reason God even brought you to this
[1:55:35] truth it's so that you could settle it
[1:55:39] the Bible say you know the truth and the
[1:55:41] truth will make you free this is why God
[1:55:44] did that so you cannot sell without God
[1:55:47] your life was gonna always be in
[1:55:48] shambles hallelujah but you can have an
[1:55:52] abundant life if you just surrendered to
[1:55:55] him can I go a little further
[1:55:58] he wasn't safe ten years ago or two
[1:56:01] years ago three years ago I wasn't safe
[1:56:03] seventeen years ago I was saved 2000
[1:56:05] years ago but I accepted it seventeen
[1:56:07] years ago listen now Jesus didn't come
[1:56:10] down and digest for me or digest for you
[1:56:12] he settled distinct question but if
[1:56:15] it'll never do us any good until we
[1:56:17] accept it it's your accepting of him I
[1:56:22] want to put this on Jesus I wanna I
[1:56:25] wanna I wanna exalt him so high today
[1:56:26] even if it's your accepting of him of
[1:56:30] Christ as your personal Savior mama
[1:56:33] couldn't save you daddy couldn't save
[1:56:35] you preacher can save you but Jesus be
[1:56:38] it and it's your accepting of him as
[1:56:42] your personal Savior and it's by faith
[1:56:45] that you receive it and believe it hello
[1:56:47] he says now in Hebrews 3:1 the Bible
[1:56:49] said that he's the high priest of our
[1:56:53] confession and he's sitting at the right
[1:56:55] hand of the Father make intercession for
[1:56:57] us upon our confession and I love that
[1:57:01] there's a maybe one other thing that I
[1:57:03] want to just kind of read to you here
[1:57:05] because when you when you when you the
[1:57:08] first thing is is believe that he did it
[1:57:10] the second thing is confessed that he
[1:57:12] did and the third thing is live
[1:57:15] underneath that confession first believe
[1:57:19] that Christ did it ii accept what you
[1:57:23] did
[1:57:24] third start living underneath that you
[1:57:28] know III can't I can't get you to even
[1:57:30] see the deeper things of God I can get
[1:57:33] this settled
[1:57:38] oh my god I told you this happened to me
[1:57:43] while I was in the Dead Sea find it kind
[1:57:47] of amazing you know that I was standing
[1:57:49] there in the Dead Sea and God would just
[1:57:53] kind of speak this to my heart there's
[1:57:56] some things you know that's special
[1:57:57] about the Dead Sea first thing is that
[1:58:01] it's almost 9 times saltier than the
[1:58:04] regular ocean right the Dead Sea is
[1:58:07] almost 9 times saltier they said it's
[1:58:09] also known as the earth lowest elevation
[1:58:12] on land the dance sea is known as the as
[1:58:15] the earth lowest elevation on lamb and
[1:58:20] because of the high levels of salt or
[1:58:23] salinity they call it the high levels of
[1:58:25] salinity no plant or animal can live
[1:58:28] inside the Dead Sea right no plant or
[1:58:32] animal can live inside the Dead Sea and
[1:58:36] you know and when you just kind of you
[1:58:38] know just start looking at some of these
[1:58:39] things me standing there in the Dead Sea
[1:58:43] and God telling me you know we gotta
[1:58:46] settle it right I just begin to kind of
[1:58:49] think to myself say you know if this is
[1:58:51] the lowest a man elevational land what
[1:58:55] we need maybe somehow to get to the
[1:58:56] altar right get to a low spot a man
[1:59:00] where they can just kind of come before
[1:59:01] God and just say Lord I want to settle
[1:59:04] things and and maybe you've got to go
[1:59:05] through some things that life has
[1:59:07] brought you to a very low point a man
[1:59:09] and that's ok because at this low point
[1:59:11] this is the place where God wants to
[1:59:13] meet you where you can settle some
[1:59:15] things he can't bless you until you
[1:59:18] settle it the other thing about the Dead
[1:59:24] Sea is that if you settle it there amen
[1:59:32] and I'll just may think of the name
[1:59:35] dance see right if you can just die out
[1:59:38] to yourself if you can die out to sin
[1:59:42] right if you can just give it up it just
[1:59:45] died to it when a man is is
[1:59:48] they're just something that don't bother
[1:59:49] him no more right
[1:59:51] I am wish you want you to have your own
[1:59:53] personal dance C experience I want you
[1:59:57] to understand some things because a lot
[1:59:59] of us alone I wanna I wanna I'm gonna
[2:00:01] have to pick on sister Brown she was a
[2:00:02] little timid when she went to the Dead
[2:00:06] Sea and this is this is some of us
[2:00:11] approach God this way we it's hard for
[2:00:13] us to give it all up I'm talking to you
[2:00:16] it's hard for us to let it all go but
[2:00:20] but I'm gonna tell you when you can
[2:00:22] bring it to the Dead Sea and you can
[2:00:24] actually just sit yourself in the day at
[2:00:27] sea I want you to know something I don't
[2:00:29] care and the dance here is pretty deep
[2:00:30] but I don't care how deep it is because
[2:00:33] of the salinity inside the Dead Sea you
[2:00:36] can't drown he couldn't let me drown but
[2:00:42] his daddy took me in right you came trou
[2:00:45] if you commit yourself to the PMC and I
[2:00:51] will tell you that fear we might round
[2:00:53] you that's it when I kill you if you
[2:00:56] commit yourself to Jesus Christ will it
[2:01:05] hold me
[2:01:06] cansu it up we don't know we we don't we
[2:01:07] don't we don't we don't have confidence
[2:01:09] that the blood can actually wash us we
[2:01:12] don't have confidence that the blood can
[2:01:14] actually cleanse us we don't have
[2:01:15] confidence that the blood can actually
[2:01:17] stop us from our sin just like what
[2:01:23] y'all say j-just sit down sister Brown
[2:01:25] just just said what y'all say so the
[2:01:29] brown way huh what y'all what do you
[2:01:32] want and everybody out just sit around
[2:01:34] floating they just I mean you can stop
[2:01:36] sister cop from floating come on
[2:01:39] somebody she got so excited she had a
[2:01:41] phone in her pocket and the Middle's of
[2:01:44] the Dead Sea gotta hold the phone right
[2:01:47] Buster Cobb just floating all over the
[2:01:50] place said Amen she was she was very
[2:01:51] comfortable but sister Brown said I
[2:01:54] don't know about this I don't know about
[2:01:56] that and then that's the way some of us
[2:01:57] approach God
[2:01:59] huh we don't we don't we don't have the
[2:02:01] confidence that he can take care of it
[2:02:04] God will turn your life around
[2:02:07] oh if you'll give him a chance gotta
[2:02:12] give you more than you ever bargained
[2:02:13] for
[2:02:14] if you give him all of you I don't know
[2:02:21] I'm not sure y'all say what just just
[2:02:25] sit down yes sit down yes sit down all

[2:02:34] faith to believe that the water girl
[2:02:37] whoo yeah hallelujah
[2:02:39] it takes faith to believe that the blood
[2:02:42] Amen can wash you it takes faith to
[2:02:46] believe that the blood gonna settle
[2:02:47] things for you huh but about farming
[2:02:50] sister Brian got to the point she you

[2:03:53] back to the shore I see I thank God
[2:03:59] you know God God would give me just this
[2:04:00] little thought here while I'm while I'm
[2:04:02] sitting there in the Dead Sea settle it
[2:04:06] to today don't don't leave with that
[2:04:09] selling I mean if you if you ain't
[2:04:11] really
[2:04:11] really committed it all over to him can
[2:04:16] I invite you to do that today
[2:04:18] I mean I'm talk about really surrendered
[2:04:24] did let me read you something here out
[2:04:26] of here he him he says you have a barrel
[2:04:32] meet here and a barrel of salt here
[2:04:37] it'll never save you got meat and salt
[2:04:40] you just got two barrels of it it'll
[2:04:42] never save you say the salt will never
[2:04:45] save the meat till it contacts it and we
[2:04:50] got to be salty and then contact the
[2:04:54] world right that's the Savior he said
[2:04:58] and some salt salt creates thirst right
[2:05:01] and when the Christian people who call
[2:05:04] themselves Christians will be so salty
[2:05:06] that the world would desire to be like
[2:05:09] you you'll make a contact then the
[2:05:14] reason your family can't follow you
[2:05:15] because you ain't become salty you ain't
[2:05:19] made contact yet they say have you seen
[2:05:24] Christians you say I just love to be
[2:05:28] like that woman now y'all know y'all
[2:05:30] don't see people like that in your life
[2:05:31] I just love to be like that woman I just
[2:05:34] love to be like that man
[2:05:35] if there ever was a Christian there he
[2:05:37] is see that's that salty it says you
[2:05:42] just be that you be that you be the salt
[2:05:45] God will create the thirst but you'd be
[2:05:47] salty and I don't have I know I've had
[2:05:50] Christians in my life that I said man I
[2:05:52] wanna I want I want my life to pattern
[2:05:54] like them I want to be like that some of
[2:05:56] y'all have parents that and that's
[2:05:58] that's the person in your life you mean
[2:06:00] I want that I want my life to pan out
[2:06:02] I'm gonna tell your parent has become
[2:06:04] that salty they've done exactly what God
[2:06:06] has asked them to do you know you know
[2:06:13] you got one of their mamas that's salty
[2:06:17] when you get in trouble ain't nobody to
[2:06:21] come but you know that if you get in
[2:06:23] touch with mama and if mom would
[2:06:26] begin the pre this thing I'm turning a
[2:06:29] little bit so you got some salty people
[2:06:32] in your life but the problem is is that
[2:06:33] you happy to let them be salty but but
[2:06:39] what God wants now he wants you to
[2:06:41] become salty you become one of the
[2:06:44] people that people have to call along a
[2:06:47] son can look up to his Danny a daughter
[2:06:50] can look up to his daddy huh you become
[2:06:52] salty the others could make contact
[2:07:00] there's this little quote and I'm gonna
[2:07:04] wind up here in let me see something
[2:07:06] here let me just see where I'm at
[2:07:08] oh my god I want to read this a couple
[2:07:12] more quotes I'm gonna go to the token
[2:07:14] next but there's a little statement
[2:07:17] please brother Peregrine was sharing the
[2:07:21] testimony I shared this with you all
[2:07:23] there are some ladies they they went to
[2:07:26] a meeting brother Brandon was preaching
[2:07:27] and in brother Branham preached and he
[2:07:31] just told him he told the pieces he
[2:07:33] started talking about all kind of stuff
[2:07:34] that the sisters was doing they should
[2:07:36] have been doing don't dress like this
[2:07:38] don't don't present yourself like this
[2:07:39] don't do that don't do this that's of
[2:07:41] the world that's not of God he just went
[2:07:43] right through it and the sisters got
[2:07:44] upset so they told me husband's after in
[2:07:47] between the service like you know they
[2:07:48] shouldn't let brother Brandon preach
[2:07:49] because you know he just come in he
[2:07:51] offend all the people he offend
[2:07:54] everybody he got that he got a bad spear
[2:07:55] he just offend everybody so the night
[2:07:58] that night for the random get up to any
[2:07:59] preaching during the middle of the
[2:08:00] sermon say don't think I didn't hear
[2:08:02] what you said
[2:08:03] you said I had a bad spirit and that
[2:08:05] they shouldn't let me preach and that I
[2:08:07] just offend everybody I'm offending
[2:08:08] people again that's what you're thinking
[2:08:10] don't do that and then he stopped and
[2:08:12] made it come and he says he says and
[2:08:15] here they were church-going folk but he
[2:08:17] said you know what you have gone as far
[2:08:18] with God as you are going to go until
[2:08:23] you get ready to pay a greater price
[2:08:26] they said you have gone as far with God
[2:08:30] as you are going to go and I want to
[2:08:32] tell you that maybe the reason your life
[2:08:34] is up and down in and out is because you
[2:08:36] have gone as far with God as you are
[2:08:38] going to go
[2:08:40] until you get ready to pay a greater
[2:08:43] price he already paid a price but now
[2:08:48] it's time for you to pay a greater price
[2:08:50] a price of sacrifice a price of giving
[2:08:54] it all up to God otherwise you'd never
[2:08:59] go further than where you are right now
[2:09:09] Sarita's messed this quote out of the
[2:09:11] token and a couple other quotes and
[2:09:13] we'll bring it home America this is your
[2:09:19] last hour judgement leaves in the
[2:09:22] balance yonder for this nation if God
[2:09:26] would let this nation get by with what
[2:09:28] is done now he would be obligated to
[2:09:31] raise up sodom and gomorrah and
[2:09:33] apologize for burning them up that's
[2:09:37] right we're going to pay for our sins we
[2:09:41] are doing the same thing they did in
[2:09:43] Sodom and God sent down message just
[2:09:48] exactly the way he did in Sodom just
[2:09:50] exactly he sent one to the church out
[2:09:52] there and the Lak group and to Sodom and
[2:09:55] he sent to the elect and so forth and
[2:09:57] proved it and the church is setting
[2:09:59] exactly in the condition it was in the
[2:10:01] days of lot Jesus said it would be again
[2:10:04] friends it's in your hands what are we
[2:10:07] gonna do with it say blood on your hands
[2:10:11] yes what do you think Oswald thought
[2:10:13] when he was sitting in that room the
[2:10:15] other day by taking the blood of his
[2:10:16] fellow man shooting the president and
[2:10:18] assassination and he was sitting there
[2:10:20] no he had to face the federal court when
[2:10:23] that Supreme Court will look on him with
[2:10:25] anger eyes knowing that on his hands was
[2:10:27] the blood of the President of the United
[2:10:28] States he was in a sweat box what ought
[2:10:33] it do to a man when you know you have
[2:10:36] trampled over the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:10:38] and refused to do it you're sitting in a
[2:10:40] sweat box not only will you be judged by
[2:10:43] a Supreme Court by an angry god that
[2:10:47] that can cast the body away and throw
[2:10:50] the soul into hell you stop look listen
[2:10:54] take heed we just trample over him easy
[2:10:58] and think he is so loving young fella
[2:11:02] said the other day God loves me so well
[2:11:04] God is a God is a good God that is true
[2:11:08] but he's a God of anger - he's a God of
[2:11:12] judgment he's a god of Wrath we fail to
[2:11:14] get that you make him so good - you make
[2:11:17] him some old daddy grandpa Dodie grandpa

[2:11:32] know as parents you'd be wanting to tap
[2:11:35] into that child but grandparents don't
[2:11:42] do that God ain't like that God is a

[2:11:49] you've ever had the dynamic of the
[2:11:52] grandparent parent you know thing
[2:11:53] happening and your family do you know
[2:11:56] what that's like but sometime as a pair

[2:11:58] grandparent no no no no no look I'm
[2:12:01] gonna have to do what I need to do right
[2:12:04] cuz you did it to me and look how I

[2:12:12] of pulled on back but after that child

[2:12:56] father of Correction
[2:13:05] the Lord just put this in my heart while
[2:13:07] I was there and I want to tell you
[2:13:10] something just like in the Dead Sea when
[2:13:13] you if you just commit yourself to it
[2:13:15] you won't drown and if you could just
[2:13:18] commit yourself to the Lord Jesus Christ

[2:13:22] he won't harm you amen he will sustain
[2:13:25] you right
[2:13:26] I know he will Laurie to God but i but i
[2:13:29] but but i have to bring this to a point
[2:13:31] where amen
[2:13:32] you have to be the one to accept what he
[2:13:34] has done for you you ain't got to go
[2:13:36] back to the register and repay it's
[2:13:38] already paid and I'm telling you you
[2:13:40] paid it Jesus did so if you would just
[2:13:43] accept what he's done for you your life
[2:13:46] could be totally different no more up

[2:16:38] the last days I believe that Jesus
[2:16:42] Christ has sent His angels to the earth
[2:16:45] and as he has and as he has and every
[2:16:52] Junction like in the days of nor like in
[2:16:56] the days of the delivering the children
[2:16:59] of Israel the Lord Jesus himself and in
[2:17:04] the last day I now confess all of my
[2:17:08] unbelief I believe that you clearly paid
[2:17:13] my debt for my sins for my sickness I
[2:17:19] accept you as my savior I accept you as
[2:17:25] my healer from this day on by God's help
[2:17:31] I am going to testify to the glory of
[2:17:35] God of my healing and my salvation I
[2:17:40] believe that the devil has no power over
[2:17:46] me anymore because of the grace of
[2:17:51] Christ that's here today give God praise
[2:17:56] for already being done
[2:18:08] believe it
[2:18:11] confess it begin to live in it believe
[2:18:17] it confess it begin to live in it you
[2:18:24] just settled that thing you can leave
[2:18:27] the rest of right now with no bird
[2:18:42] I believe that let's just read a script
[2:18:46] a few scriptures musicians can come give
[2:18:49] me matthew 26:26 i just want to read a
[2:18:51] few scriptures to you and just about
[2:18:54] your Lord and Savior he took care of
[2:18:58] this for you says as they were eating
[2:19:01] Jesus took bread blessed it and brake it
[2:19:05] and gave it to the disciples and said
[2:19:07] take eat this is my body this was
[2:19:09] communion and he took the cup and gave
[2:19:12] thanks and gave it to them saying drink
[2:19:14] ye all of it for this is my blood of the
[2:19:18] New Testament which is shed for many for
[2:19:20] the remission of sins let me tell you
[2:19:24] something when things have been settled
[2:19:25] you don't have to run from communion
[2:19:30] when things have been said or you can
[2:19:32] come to communion not only now I can you
[2:19:34] come to communion but Jax you look
[2:19:35] forward to come into communion can I
[2:19:38] tell you why because the first thing
[2:19:40] you're gonna do when you get to heaven
[2:19:42] is have communion so if you can't have
[2:19:47] communion here how do you expect to just
[2:19:51] have it over there if things have been
[2:19:54] settled you ought to make your way back
[2:20:04] first Peter 2:24 who his own self I'm
[2:20:11] talking about the man that paid your
[2:20:12] debt who his own self bare our sins in
[2:20:15] his own body on the tree that we being
[2:20:18] dead to sins should live unto
[2:20:21] righteousness by whose stripes ye were
[2:20:24] healed when you settled it you become
[2:20:27] dead to those old things that had you
[2:20:29] bound
[2:20:29] guess we're guess where we dropped them
[2:20:31] into the dance scene it's all been
[2:20:36] dropped into the dance scene and let me
[2:20:38] tell you something about the dead see
[2:20:40] nothing can live nothing can live in a
[2:20:50] dance see the salt is too high the level
[2:20:55] of salt is too high
[2:20:56] nothing can live there your sins have
[2:21:01] been disintegrated Colossians 2 verse 13
[2:21:13] and you being dead in your sins and the
[2:21:19] uncircumcision of your flesh
[2:21:22] I like this hath he quickened together
[2:21:27] with him I love this part not just
[2:21:31] covering but forgiving having forgiven
[2:21:34] you some of your trespasses no no I
[2:21:38] don't care what you've done is under and
[2:21:42] he's forgiving you of all your
[2:21:44] trespasses blotting out the handwriting
[2:21:47] of Ordinances that was against us which
[2:21:50] was contrary to us and took it out of
[2:21:54] the way nailing it to his cross and I
[2:21:59] love this and having spoiled
[2:22:00] principalities and powers he made a show
[2:22:03] of them openly triumphing over them in
[2:22:08] it he's already won the victory all you
[2:22:12] got to do is walk in it believe it
[2:22:17] confess it live in it
[2:22:29] let's stand to our feet I want you to
[2:22:36] think about it from the angle that I
[2:22:41] presented it of that person that might
[2:22:43] have walked into the restaurant and
[2:22:44] Paige or you're dead
[2:22:47] [Music]
[2:22:49] you didn't know them you've never seen
[2:22:53] them before but yet out of the kindness
[2:22:56] of their heart they show grace they show
[2:22:58] mercy and if God could put that upon
[2:23:05] somebody's heart to do that for you in
[2:23:06] the natural it shows a type of what he
[2:23:08] has done for you spiritually the joint
[2:23:12] brings to know that somebody's paid out
[2:23:14] that we ought to worship our Lord we had
[2:23:19] a worship our Savior when you think
[2:23:22] about where you were how deep you were
[2:23:23] in sin but he's wiped a whole deck clean
[2:23:29] what
[2:23:31] a savior what a mighty God that we serve
[2:23:36] we gotta love them we ought to praise
[2:23:39] Him we ought to thank him if your hands
