[23:54] because my mom raised her so she always
[23:57] says she's my sister and her mom who is
[24:00] my sister has struggled with drugs all
[24:02] my life so
[24:05] when my my i'm gonna say my niece my
[24:07] great niece passed
[24:09] uh her mom who we were like thickest
[24:11] thieves one you seen one you seen the

[27:28] into the station you know they'll start
[27:31] coming in there and i just end up
[27:32] talking to them about the lord and
[27:33] everything but um
[27:36] i went in and told my boss i said i want
[27:38] to be a csa so he said his first words
[27:41] to me was
[27:43] you know they got to wear pants right
[27:44] nelly i said i know that i consider all
[27:47] things
[27:48] but i want to be a csa
[27:50] so he said okay
[27:52] and he approved it
[27:54] it went all the way up to the
[27:55] undersheriff so everybody approved it
[27:57] right away and they even got me into the
[27:59] academy to be the underchair i'm to be
[28:02] to go to um be the csa
[28:04] but
[28:06] the week they had transferred me to this
[28:08] new department it was everything was
[28:09] signed sealed and delivered
[28:12] but god
[28:13] uh works all day long like you say he's
[28:16] in the beginning he's in the end he's in
[28:18] the middle he works at all he's working
[28:20] it all out
[28:21] so
[28:22] in all of that the week before i was
[28:25] supposed to go to the academy we had to
[28:27] go to this academy down south or
[28:28] whatever happens the week before it was
[28:30] supposed to be a group of us to go to
[28:32] this academy
[28:33] but because it wasn't the lowest will
[28:35] even though i just told him what i
[28:36] wanted and not what he wanted uh he shut
[28:39] the whole academy down for the whole
[28:40] entire sheriff's office
[28:42] so i said okay lord
[28:45] i was like okay lord
[28:48] they were like well nella you can go and
[28:50] you can be into it the next time
[28:52] i'm not upset about it i was like okay
[28:55] it is what it is
[28:56] but we're coming back to the testimony
[28:58] i'm going back in the house and i'm
[29:00] laying down and there's god
[29:02] continuously talking to me
[29:04] uh um
[29:06] while i'm up in this room he says you're
[29:08] not gonna be a csa
[29:10] he was like um i need you to be ready
[29:13] for this next level
[29:15] so i was like okay lord and then he was
[29:19] like have i not he said you've never had
[29:21] to worry about your finances in all your
[29:23] years you never had to worry about your
[29:24] life there's your water bill hot
[29:26] anything was gonna get paid how much
[29:28] more can i take care of you and your
[29:30] retirement so i said okay lord no
[29:33] problem i went in and the next morning i
[29:35] said well i can't be a csa my boss said
[29:37] well nelly can i ask you why you can't
[29:40] what made you change your mind i say
[29:42] well the lord said i can't do it he said
[29:44] well if the lord said you can't do it
[29:46] that's the end of that
[29:49] so so i i go and um
[29:53] that's the end of that and um
[29:56] thanks that they start having my daddy
[29:58] he gets sick and you know this is a very
[30:01] very very strong man and he's
[30:03] i mean you've never seen him down you
[30:05] never seen
[30:06] anything he goes and he gets sick and
[30:10] uh
[30:11] they say he had covet but then it turns
[30:13] out that he was back in
[30:16] with cancer
[30:17] and um
[30:19] i go down there to see him and i've
[30:21] never seen my dad
[30:23] in the bed flat is back they can't get
[30:25] up can't move i've never seen him in all
[30:28] my years any in that kind of position so
[30:31] um i'm like okay i need to get
[30:34] you know get you a bed so at least we
[30:36] can get you up and everything like that
[30:38] he was like okay nelly so i go it up
[30:41] um i try to find him this bed and i try
[30:44] to find him this bed and i can't find
[30:46] this bed calvin gets furniture and stuff
[30:48] all the time you get these little pants
[30:49] but he couldn't get a bed for him
[30:51] so the next week i was like dad i'm
[30:53] still looking for your bed but
[30:55] i can't um find this bed he was like oh
[30:57] no don't worry about that bed because um
[30:59] i'm up and i'm walking you know cause
[31:02] the song that was in my heart was this
[31:04] week will be a week for miracles so and
[31:07] i wasn't thinking about tonight's and i
[31:09] stopped and i was like god just working
[31:11] working things out you know just this
[31:14] week is a week for miracles and god
[31:16] can't do nothing with what we want to do
[31:18] he said that we was going to go in
[31:23] with our character and the things that
[31:26] we have on us that he can't use he's
[31:29] going to send these tests and these
[31:30] trials for us to get these
[31:32] characteristics up out of us because we
[31:35] are going to the next level and of
[31:38] course i you know me being stubborn you
[31:40] know like you said god has sent somebody
[31:42] even you know no nobody ain't gonna
[31:44] affect you like those that are closest
[31:46] to you are those that are in the church
[31:48] the people in the church and the people
[31:51] in your home affect you more than
[31:53] anybody else if joe schmo blow does
[31:56] something to you you don't care but if
[31:58] somebody in the church does it or
[32:00] somebody in your home does it it affects
[32:03] you more and uh and and you know
[32:06] what it is i say um
[32:08] i'm putting on a stubborn face again
[32:12] you know what i ain't giving my
[32:14] testimony
[32:16] and as i'm sitting here and uh
[32:18] and uh
[32:20] as brother jack preacher last week you
[32:22] know i was just going and i just i
[32:24] actually opened up the book
[32:27] that you know i've always taken my notes
[32:29] in i'm always right now with stuff
[32:31] coming in i just started reading the
[32:34] first couple of pages
[32:36] and in the first couple of pages it was
[32:37] just laying out every single thing that
[32:39] i had just went through
[32:41] and he was just saying that i'm gonna
[32:43] elevate you to the next level
[32:45] stop being hard-headed and get in the
[32:47] will of the lord go and testify to
[32:50] strengthen the faith of your brothers
[32:52] and sisters
[32:53] check your spirit when you come to
[32:55] church so that the holy spirit can flow
[32:58] freely so what i'm saying is stop
[33:00] thinking about yourself and get in line
[33:02] with the will of god because we're
[33:04] coming to a place in a time where we're
[33:06] going to be able to speak and everything
[33:09] that we speak we're going back to the
[33:11] first beginning everything that we speak
[33:13] is gonna happen just like adam in the
[33:15] beginning and you can't have any old
[33:18] kind of spirit when you have this power
[33:20] in you so we are like christ and then
[33:23] being like christ we have to have the
[33:25] character of christ and stubbornness and
[33:28] and hard-headedness is not the
[33:31] characteristic of christ so if he got a
[33:33] single test in the trials to get that
[33:35] spirit up off of you then he's gonna sit
[33:38] in that test and try to get that spirit
[33:39] up off of you cause you are coming to
[33:42] the next level
[33:44] [Applause]
[34:01] elevation comes with a price
[34:03] all right
[34:04] hey
[34:06] character is not a gift it's a victory
[34:08] you're going to go through some things
[34:10] in order to get character
[34:12] you can look for that if you want to be
[34:13] elevated
[34:15] you got to be proven first
[34:17] ain't nobody going to put you up if you
[34:19] can't take care down here
[34:21] amen god bless you sister nelly thank
[34:23] you for that testimony

[1:05:57] because you know you just start looking
[1:06:00] back at
[1:06:01] you know
[1:06:02] 20 plus years now brother jack you know
[1:06:04] we
[1:06:05] we were just there on palm beach well
[1:06:07] we'll read the scripture and then i'll
[1:06:08] reminisce
[1:06:09] and then you're not standing so
[1:06:11] revelations chapter 3
[1:06:13] verses 20 to 22
[1:06:16] and it says behold i stand at the door
[1:06:18] and knock if any man hear my voice and
[1:06:20] open the door i will come to him
[1:06:22] and sup with him and he with me
[1:06:26] and to him that overcometh will i grant
[1:06:28] to sit with me in my throne even as i
[1:06:31] also overcame and am set down with my
[1:06:33] father in his throne he that hath an ear
[1:06:37] let him hear
[1:06:39] what the spirit saith to the churches
[1:06:41] father bless your word and your people

[1:07:04] ever stayed at

[1:07:11] you know man you know his brother jack
[1:07:12] introduced the boys well man some of
[1:07:14] them just probably remember when they
[1:07:16] were just
[1:07:17] you know little
[1:07:18] and then i started thinking about
[1:07:20] rebecca and sarah and when i first came
[1:07:22] along you know i thought they were twins
[1:07:24] because they were both about the same
[1:07:25] size
[1:07:26] they were like eight or something and
[1:07:29] and just
[1:07:31] you know all right you know you just go
[1:07:33] okay lord just
[1:07:35] it's just
[1:07:37] where's the time gone lord

[1:08:09] friends and
[1:08:11] you know congregations that are just
[1:08:12] like this is a
[1:08:14] special place
[1:08:15] for many many people and so so cherish
[1:08:17] what you have church
[1:08:19] cherish your pastor
[1:08:21] you know support him he's he's doing a
[1:08:23] really good job
[1:08:25] he's got the right heart and
[1:08:27] just trying to stay balanced himself
[1:08:30] and try to just lead on in the word of
[1:08:32] god and and not to get to the right not
[1:08:34] to get to the left not to get off in
[1:08:36] fanaticism
[1:08:37] not to
[1:08:38] camp out on any one doctrine or you know
[1:08:40] hey we've come we've come through it all
[1:08:42] church you you've been there too
[1:08:44] you know
[1:08:45] let's just hey god sent us a message
[1:08:50] and it don't make people crazy
[1:08:53] yes sir brother that's right
[1:08:56] it makes people believers
[1:09:01] it sets a reality of the word of god
[1:09:04] in this age and that's what we're
[1:09:05] following
[1:09:07] amen
[1:09:10] it's a restoration
[1:09:12] of the original word
[1:09:14] because it got lost in this day all
[1:09:16] right now i'm not going to preach on
[1:09:17] that
[1:09:19] but i could
[1:09:23] i'm so thankful
[1:09:25] so as as so many of you know um
[1:09:29] you've gone through your sunday school
[1:09:30] with the church age book curriculum um
[1:09:33] and and brother jack's
[1:09:35] faithful friend you know my the guy who
[1:09:37] pushed me to finish that and
[1:09:39] so um i had kind of plans to to preach
[1:09:43] something else but just on the way down
[1:09:45] just trying to get the mind of the lord
[1:09:47] as as we drove and um i i did lesson 71
[1:09:52] the end lesson of the laodicean church
[1:09:55] age at our church just last sunday or
[1:09:57] the sunday before i don't know time
[1:09:59] moves by so fast
[1:10:00] you know um
[1:10:03] and
[1:10:04] to me it was a very moving lesson and i
[1:10:07] couldn't i could just couldn't get away
[1:10:09] from it and then speaking with brother
[1:10:10] jack last night he just mentioned
[1:10:14] the word he's just said the word
[1:10:15] understand you know and just man you
[1:10:18] talk about feeling like
[1:10:20] a load of bricks just
[1:10:22] fell into place with mortar and
[1:10:23] everything and a foundation was laid in
[1:10:25] like two seconds it was like okay lord
[1:10:27] this is what we're it's what we're
[1:10:29] talking about so
[1:10:30] i just want to go some of the slides
[1:10:31] that i have i i edited just a little bit
[1:10:34] from from how i i did the lesson there
[1:10:37] in in at home but um a few of them will
[1:10:40] probably end up skipping and i'll work
[1:10:42] with you sister tina but um
[1:10:47] you know
[1:10:49] we just want to talk about overcoming
[1:10:50] and i i told brother jack i said you
[1:10:52] know i was i was gonna do
[1:10:55] a non-church age
[1:10:57] lesson
[1:10:59] strange as that may sound
[1:11:01] because i started actually i was looking
[1:11:03] through photos and my wife and i when i
[1:11:05] first started writing that curriculum my
[1:11:07] wife and i took a trip and we we took a
[1:11:09] weekend away and uh you know she
[1:11:11] scrapbooked and cut out pictures and and
[1:11:13] i worked on church h book stuff and that
[1:11:16] was the first i think nine lessons i
[1:11:17] wrote that weekend
[1:11:19] and that was um i think eight years ago
[1:11:22] and it was just the other day eight
[1:11:23] years ago that i started and i realized
[1:11:25] like wow like i've probably preached
[1:11:27] maybe 10 sermons that haven't come out
[1:11:29] of the church age book
[1:11:30] in eight years
[1:11:32] and so
[1:11:33] um
[1:11:34] so this comes out of the church each
[1:11:36] book it comes out of the latest in
[1:11:37] church age
[1:11:38] and um like i almost joked to our to our
[1:11:42] church but i just
[1:11:44] you know
[1:11:44] that i was like we just finished
[1:11:47] our last lesson on the laodicean church
[1:11:49] age and we're in the laodicean church
[1:11:51] age
[1:11:52] i was like yeah probably doesn't mean
[1:11:54] anything but
[1:11:57] because remember we're not a bunch of
[1:11:59] crazy people
[1:12:00] like we're just serving the lord
[1:12:03] we don't have to try to you know make
[1:12:05] stars align and things like that you
[1:12:06] know
[1:12:07] so
[1:12:09] but it's good you know i could preach
[1:12:11] for the rest of my life out of the
[1:12:13] church age but the things that are in
[1:12:14] there how much scripture brother branham
[1:12:16] brings out into that and and the depth
[1:12:18] that he goes into so amazing so i just
[1:12:20] want to continue on that i'll start my
[1:12:22] timer here
[1:12:25] you know now that i'm done with all of
[1:12:27] that so
[1:12:28] so as we read here in um
[1:12:31] revelations chapter 3 that christ is
[1:12:33] christ is outside the church and we'll
[1:12:36] just start at this first phrase behold
[1:12:39] i stand at the door
[1:12:41] and knock and brother branham begins to
[1:12:43] say now there's great
[1:12:47] there's a great deal of confusion
[1:12:50] over this verse because so many personal
[1:12:52] workers use it in personal evangelism
[1:12:55] as though jesus were at the heart store
[1:12:57] of every sinner knocking for admission
[1:12:59] it would then be said that if the sinner
[1:13:01] opened the door
[1:13:02] the lord would come in
[1:13:04] but this verse is not talking to
[1:13:07] individual sinners the whole message has
[1:13:09] a summation as does every message and
[1:13:11] every age in verse 22 it says he that
[1:13:13] hath in the ear let him hear what the
[1:13:14] spirit saith to the churches
[1:13:17] so this is a message to the church of
[1:13:20] the last age now this is where you know
[1:13:23] we kind of depart from just general
[1:13:24] christianity as he said most christians
[1:13:27] are just like oh yeah this is just you
[1:13:29] know salvation stuff and it's like no
[1:13:31] jesus is talking to church he's talking
[1:13:33] to the churches
[1:13:35] so so he's saying i stand at the door
[1:13:37] and knock i'm outside the church so he
[1:13:40] says this is the condition of the
[1:13:41] laodicean church
[1:13:43] as its end nears it's not a personal
[1:13:45] message to one person it is the spirit
[1:13:48] telling us where jesus is
[1:13:50] christ
[1:13:51] has left the church and so we can say
[1:13:54] well what
[1:13:56] how can we say christ is outside
[1:13:58] like what a bold statement and so my
[1:14:01] answer to that is is i'm not
[1:14:04] the bible is all right amen
[1:14:07] plainly reading that passage is just
[1:14:09] telling you christ is knocking saying
[1:14:12] hey open up i'd love to come in
[1:14:14] but i've been put out
[1:14:16] i'm not inside you think i'm inside the
[1:14:19] very the very thought of having church
[1:14:22] would say yeah i'm inside but no he's
[1:14:24] outside he's knocking trying to get in
[1:14:26] and then we could talk about well why
[1:14:28] why is he outside why isn't he inside
[1:14:31] that would be like the logical next
[1:14:33] question like why isn't he on the next
[1:14:35] side on the inside and brother branham
[1:14:37] says it's is this not the logical result
[1:14:40] of or end if the word is put aside right
[1:14:44] for creed the holy spirit deposed for
[1:14:47] popes bishops presidents counselors etc
[1:14:49] and the savior set aside for a works
[1:14:52] program
[1:14:55] or church joining
[1:14:58] or some type of conformity
[1:15:00] to a church
[1:15:02] system
[1:15:05] now
[1:15:06] now that last slide that talked about
[1:15:08] popes and all those things we're like
[1:15:10] yeah yeah yeah that's what them
[1:15:11] denominations do
[1:15:13] but church joining or
[1:15:16] conformity
[1:15:18] to a church system that maybe starts
[1:15:20] getting a little
[1:15:21] closer home maybe
[1:15:23] and we would all say no no no i'm not
[1:15:25] guilty of that and i would just say are
[1:15:27] you all right
[1:15:29] like like it's time to search our hearts
[1:15:31] and make our calling and elections sure
[1:15:34] and find out you know what have we been
[1:15:35] doing for 40 years in the wilderness
[1:15:37] kind of a thing yes sir to make sure
[1:15:40] that we're the joshua and caleb who are
[1:15:42] going to take a land and i'm not just
[1:15:46] wandering around following a prophet and
[1:15:48] the prophet's like well here's the
[1:15:49] jordan river would you like to cross it
[1:15:50] and we're like well i mean just you know
[1:15:52] i'll do what uh
[1:15:54] you know i'll do what the children of
[1:15:55] israel thing to do is
[1:15:57] like all the rest of the children of
[1:15:59] israel because that's you know
[1:16:01] that's what children of israel do
[1:16:03] is children of israel things what is
[1:16:05] that well it's
[1:16:06] yeah i mean you you know the thing you
[1:16:09] know come on like
[1:16:11] we follow a prophet what's that mean
[1:16:13] well you know
[1:16:18] come on
[1:16:19] i mean we go to spirit and truth you
[1:16:21] know like
[1:16:23] s.a.t
[1:16:28] who are you i'm an s.a.t believer good
[1:16:31] good what's that mean well that means we
[1:16:34] get together on sunday and we sing good
[1:16:36] music and
[1:16:37] well the jack preaches
[1:16:41] well i'm glad that you've joined the
[1:16:43] church i sure
[1:16:44] truly i'm glad that you're here that's
[1:16:46] wonderful it's good you should be here
[1:16:49] but that you're here
[1:16:52] means you're here
[1:16:56] that you're here means you've at least
[1:16:57] come to a place where you say okay god i
[1:16:59] want to come i want to be where you are
[1:17:02] i want to i want to hear the word of god
[1:17:04] preach to me i want to be encouraged and
[1:17:06] i want to come and i want to worship you
[1:17:08] together with saints because i believe
[1:17:11] it's important because it's what your
[1:17:13] word says to do and not that i'm here
[1:17:16] because well that's what s.a.t believers
[1:17:19] do
[1:17:20] that's what message believers do good
[1:17:23] for you that has nothing to do with it
[1:17:26] now if you're here for that reason i'm
[1:17:27] glad
[1:17:28] because i hope today we can we can get
[1:17:30] your we can get you a little farther
[1:17:33] and we can get you to wipe away those
[1:17:35] things because christ is on the outside
[1:17:37] knocking to the church saying why have i
[1:17:39] been put outside would you just open the
[1:17:42] door even now though you've rejected me
[1:17:44] and pushed me out
[1:17:47] oh but i'd love to come in
[1:17:49] what a merciful and gracious god
[1:17:51] so so so let's make sure that our church
[1:17:54] joining and our conformity to the you
[1:17:56] know message things isn't saying to our
[1:17:59] hearts you're all good because that has
[1:18:02] nothing to do with it all right
[1:18:04] all right
[1:18:05] so
[1:18:06] what more can be done against him
[1:18:08] this is the apostasy
[1:18:11] this is the falling away what
[1:18:14] hang on i thought it was
[1:18:17] yeah right i thought it was people
[1:18:19] leaving the message that that was the
[1:18:20] apostasy well
[1:18:22] what are they doing when they're
[1:18:24] leaving the message
[1:18:27] well
[1:18:29] they've left the word
[1:18:32] not
[1:18:33] not not
[1:18:34] like
[1:18:35] some people
[1:18:37] who who who who we say are leaving the
[1:18:39] message
[1:18:41] never really left anything
[1:18:43] because christ was still on the outside
[1:18:45] knocking saying hey
[1:18:47] i want to come in
[1:18:50] but no
[1:18:52] he wasn't there to begin with
[1:18:56] and that was a problem that was the
[1:18:57] problem the problem was is that people
[1:19:00] weren't actually getting to the word
[1:19:01] they were a part of a church system they
[1:19:03] were part of some conformity and they
[1:19:05] came to a spot where they were where
[1:19:06] they fought
[1:19:08] what is it that i'm in what is it that
[1:19:10] i'm doing and they actually maybe were
[1:19:12] honest with themselves to recognize they
[1:19:15] didn't have what this thing said they
[1:19:17] were supposed to have
[1:19:20] this is the apostasy this is the falling
[1:19:23] away that the church throughout the ages
[1:19:27] has rejected christ has put him on the
[1:19:29] outside has just said maybe you know
[1:19:32] what we're gonna do it this way you all
[1:19:34] do it this way we good good you're doing
[1:19:36] it this way amen good we're all going to
[1:19:38] kevin together
[1:19:43] all you had to do was walk through the
[1:19:44] doors on sunday morning
[1:19:50] okay dressed the right way too oh we
[1:19:52] could add a few more things and we do
[1:19:54] that you know in the message that's what
[1:19:55] the message is about right adding a few
[1:19:57] more things to regular christianity so
[1:19:59] that you know we can
[1:20:02] be better believers than all those other
[1:20:07] believers
[1:20:08] nothing to do with it
[1:20:12] that's right
[1:20:13] this is the apostasy this is the falling
[1:20:16] away is that is that people have pushed
[1:20:19] him out
[1:20:21] they haven't made it about him they've
[1:20:23] made it about
[1:20:26] them
[1:20:29] and when you make this thing
[1:20:31] whatever it is that you're doing about
[1:20:33] me
[1:20:34] about me getting to heaven and me
[1:20:36] overcoming in me this and me that
[1:20:38] where's christ in it all you've put him
[1:20:40] outside and you've taken a system just
[1:20:43] to make you something that you're not so
[1:20:45] that you can go somewhere that you don't
[1:20:46] be that you really just don't belong
[1:20:51] will glory
[1:20:53] this is the open door to antichrist for
[1:20:56] if one came in his father's name jesus
[1:20:59] and was not received but rejected
[1:21:02] then there will come another with his
[1:21:03] own name a liar a pretender and him they
[1:21:06] will receive john 4 john 5 43 the man of
[1:21:10] sin that son of perdition
[1:21:12] will take
[1:21:13] over
[1:21:15] see when you reject a
[1:21:17] real true servant of god
[1:21:19] well
[1:21:21] you're gonna just find somebody else
[1:21:23] say brother trevor no i'm i'm
[1:21:24] independent
[1:21:26] i'm on my own
[1:21:28] you know and just to show how
[1:21:30] independent i am you know what a lot of
[1:21:31] people do they dye their hair purple
[1:21:33] or blue
[1:21:35] because i'm different and then guess
[1:21:37] what they do they go hang out with other
[1:21:38] people with blue and purple hair
[1:21:41] thought you wanted to be different and
[1:21:42] then you just got together with all the
[1:21:44] other people that were just
[1:21:46] differently like you
[1:21:50] so you can follow somebody yes sir yes
[1:21:52] sir
[1:21:55] now he continues and says now we can see
[1:21:57] why there were two false vines one true
[1:21:59] one false we can see why abraham had two
[1:22:01] sons one after the flesh that persecuted
[1:22:03] isaac and one after the promise now we
[1:22:05] can see how that out of the same parents
[1:22:07] two boys came forth as twins one knowing
[1:22:10] and loving the things of god and the
[1:22:11] other knowing much of the same truth but
[1:22:13] not of the same spirit and hence
[1:22:15] persecuted the child that was elect
[1:22:18] god did not reprobate for the sake of
[1:22:20] reprobation
[1:22:21] he reprobated for the sake
[1:22:24] of the elect
[1:22:26] amen
[1:22:28] are we together yes yes
[1:22:30] we we
[1:22:32] we all sitting here going
[1:22:34] i mean i know when i read this i was
[1:22:35] like wait
[1:22:36] he reprobated for the sake of the elect
[1:22:39] okay first of all we got to talk about
[1:22:40] what reprobate means
[1:22:43] that you're gonna like
[1:22:45] that you're gonna be cast out
[1:22:47] that you're not a part of the thing
[1:22:48] because you're reprobated and it's so
[1:22:50] brother branham here is answering a
[1:22:52] question i actually didn't even know i
[1:22:53] needed to ask
[1:22:55] why does god reprobate
[1:22:57] that's what he's saying he this is why
[1:22:59] he reprobated he reprobated for the sake
[1:23:00] of the elect
[1:23:02] so god cast people out for the sake of
[1:23:04] the elect
[1:23:07] wow
[1:23:08] let's just let that sink for a little
[1:23:10] while let that just sit there and go
[1:23:12] okay wait god cast people out for his
[1:23:15] elect's sake that um okay
[1:23:19] i don't even know what to do with that
[1:23:20] yet and you begin to just think about
[1:23:22] that and you say well it seems like it's
[1:23:23] unfair but start to think about for a
[1:23:25] moment you know what sometimes how we're
[1:23:28] preaching and how we're you know trying
[1:23:30] to get people to come in is to say
[1:23:32] start doing it right and if you don't
[1:23:35] start doing it right god is going to
[1:23:37] cast you out
[1:23:39] and and he is going to burn you so do
[1:23:42] what is right because if you don't do
[1:23:44] what is right you're going to be
[1:23:44] reprobated and you're going to be burnt
[1:23:47] chaff
[1:23:49] and and when god puts the chaff there
[1:23:52] he's gonna light the fire and he's gonna
[1:23:54] laugh
[1:23:55] in judgment
[1:23:59] okay somebody just went full crazy
[1:24:05] sometimes that's them that's the way we
[1:24:07] we we bring it that's sometimes that's
[1:24:09] the way we think it and that actually
[1:24:11] has nothing to do with it and but yet
[1:24:14] sometimes we'd we'd say okay then what's
[1:24:16] the opposite of that the opposite of
[1:24:18] that is that god
[1:24:20] went and planted wheat
[1:24:22] and then an enemy came in and planted
[1:24:24] weeds
[1:24:25] and god said no let them grow together
[1:24:28] let them be blessed together
[1:24:31] amen
[1:24:32] but at the end
[1:24:35] what does he do
[1:24:36] first
[1:24:38] gather the wheat into the barn what it's
[1:24:41] about the wheat
[1:24:42] it's about the wheat it's about the ones
[1:24:45] that he elected it's about the ones that
[1:24:48] he planted everything else is just look
[1:24:51] an enemy put that in there we're just
[1:24:53] gonna cast it out because i'm not
[1:24:55] bringing weeds into the barn with the
[1:24:58] wheat
[1:25:00] i'm not going to contaminate my wheat
[1:25:03] with the weeds so god reprobates he gets
[1:25:06] rid of the weeds for the sake of the
[1:25:08] wheat
[1:25:09] so then it changes the the idea is has
[1:25:13] nothing to do with trying to escape
[1:25:16] judgment but it has everything to do
[1:25:19] with am i one of his
[1:25:24] cause we just sing it i
[1:25:27] am yours
[1:25:29] and you are mine
[1:25:33] oh
[1:25:36] yes sir
[1:25:37] that's what it's about
[1:25:39] am i one of his
[1:25:41] oh yes there's things that are right
[1:25:43] there's things that he likes there's
[1:25:45] things that are wrong there's things
[1:25:46] that he doesn't like and i want to be
[1:25:48] one of his and if i if i if i esteem him
[1:25:52] so highly then i'm going to walk in the
[1:25:54] things that he wants
[1:25:57] and then as i start doing that i start
[1:25:59] recognizing these my life is so much
[1:26:02] better having walked in his ways because
[1:26:06] my his truth endureth to all generations
[1:26:10] and when i walk in truth my life becomes
[1:26:13] better amen praise god
[1:26:16] but brother trevor there's a lot of
[1:26:18] trials christians have
[1:26:20] but your life is still better
[1:26:25] elect cannot persecute elect elect
[1:26:27] cannot harm elect it is the reprobates
[1:26:29] that persecute and destroy the elect
[1:26:32] these those reprobates are religious
[1:26:34] they're smart they're of the cane line
[1:26:36] the serpent seed they build their babels
[1:26:38] their cities their empires and all the
[1:26:40] wild calling on god they hate the true
[1:26:42] seed and they will do all they can even
[1:26:44] in the name of the lord
[1:26:46] to destroy god's elect ones
[1:26:50] you'll be persecuted
[1:26:52] in the name of jesus that's exactly
[1:26:54] right
[1:26:55] exactly right
[1:26:58] i'm part of a soccer program
[1:27:00] trying to get out of it actually right
[1:27:01] now but um
[1:27:03] you know whenever there's a disagreement
[1:27:05] between you know this these people don't
[1:27:07] like the coach these people do like the
[1:27:08] coach guess what they tell me
[1:27:11] trevor you got to get rid of that coach
[1:27:12] he's just not christian enough he's just
[1:27:14] not a good guy like we can't have him in
[1:27:16] front of our children get rid of him
[1:27:19] it's the christian thing to do
[1:27:22] and to to get rid of the guy yeah
[1:27:24] because it's about the kids you know
[1:27:26] everybody look you got a guy that you
[1:27:28] think isn't you know isn't a good
[1:27:29] character guy in front of your children
[1:27:31] you want a different coach you want to
[1:27:33] coach with good character for your
[1:27:34] children so it's a christian thing to do
[1:27:37] in a christian homeschool program to get
[1:27:39] rid of the guy in leadership position if
[1:27:40] his character isn't good enough and then
[1:27:43] everyone who likes that coach tells me
[1:27:45] how dare you get rid of somebody like
[1:27:47] that that's not christian
[1:27:54] it's like a guess i'm not a christian
[1:27:56] there's no way for me to continue to be
[1:27:58] a christian
[1:28:02] that's just a small little deal you
[1:28:04] understand real people are going to be
[1:28:06] religious they're going to try to use
[1:28:09] religion to their own ends same as the
[1:28:11] reprobates they'll use religion to their
[1:28:14] own ends they'll balk at the the that
[1:28:16] that you would say that maybe you don't
[1:28:18] have it how dare you say such a thing
[1:28:21] how dare you tell them christ is
[1:28:22] actually outside of their own church
[1:28:26] but let's find out if he is or not all
[1:28:28] right all right
[1:28:30] you say well of course they're not
[1:28:31] message churches he must not be on the
[1:28:32] inside
[1:28:35] maybe it's time we update our thinking
[1:28:40] but they are needed what is the chaff to
[1:28:42] the wheat
[1:28:43] no chaff
[1:28:44] no wheat
[1:28:46] but at the end what happens to the chaff
[1:28:47] it is burned with fire unquenchable and
[1:28:50] what is and the wheat where is it
[1:28:52] it's gathered in his garden
[1:28:54] garner
[1:28:55] it is where he is
[1:28:59] is that a changing place
[1:29:01] for the wheat if you're wheat
[1:29:03] and you're gathered and you're with
[1:29:04] you're where he is is that a changing
[1:29:06] place
[1:29:08] everybody's like i didn't answer that
[1:29:10] question it's a trick question i know
[1:29:11] it's a trick question he's like well i
[1:29:13] mean yeah now we're in the barn we were
[1:29:15] in the field but you know we're already
[1:29:17] seated
[1:29:18] in heavenly places
[1:29:20] with christ jesus you should be where he
[1:29:22] is right now there's a time he's going
[1:29:24] to come and he's going to harvest the
[1:29:26] wheat but that's not a change in
[1:29:27] spiritual place you're already where he
[1:29:29] is now
[1:29:33] what are you waiting for church
[1:29:35] are you waiting for a rapture
[1:29:37] yeah well of course i'm waiting for a
[1:29:38] rapture and brother trevor it's like
[1:29:40] well
[1:29:41] you know i wanna yeah yes we wanna wait
[1:29:43] for a rapture
[1:29:45] because we wanna be with jesus
[1:29:48] but we should be with him now
[1:29:53] how many want revival
[1:29:59] did you pray about revival this morning
[1:30:02] yes
[1:30:04] did you prepare your heart for revival
[1:30:05] this morning
[1:30:07] well we knew brother trevor was gonna
[1:30:09] just break it so
[1:30:14] i'm sorry maybe you had me confused with
[1:30:15] another preacher i don't know
[1:30:19] but some of us do that right
[1:30:23] i'm gonna wait you know for the the
[1:30:26] right circumstances in the right meeting
[1:30:28] and you know so i i did a little um
[1:30:30] bible study with the young people i was
[1:30:31] just like okay you know when's the last
[1:30:33] time you felt revived
[1:30:36] and they began to talk about the
[1:30:37] different meetings maybe they had been
[1:30:38] some of them you know said you know
[1:30:40] wednesday night actually it was just
[1:30:42] this last service i felt i felt revived
[1:30:44] i was like well praise god wasn't
[1:30:45] expecting that what did another sister
[1:30:47] said well actually that last service
[1:30:48] that you preached i said well praise god
[1:30:52] i should have expected that one
[1:30:56] some of them talked about different camp
[1:30:57] meetings that they were at and i saw
[1:30:59] okay so if we want revival the last time
[1:31:01] you got revived was it one of these
[1:31:02] meetings like this what is it that
[1:31:04] brings revival and so i got the
[1:31:06] whiteboard out and we started putting
[1:31:07] all kinds of stupid answers on the
[1:31:08] whiteboard and you know like well we're
[1:31:10] gonna have to you know we should rent an
[1:31:11] auditorium we should bring a bring you
[1:31:12] know
[1:31:13] a preacher in and then we'll all get
[1:31:15] together we'll all have a great time and
[1:31:16] we'll have revival it's like that's what
[1:31:18] brings revival as an auditorium and a
[1:31:19] preacher
[1:31:20] come on somebody or is it because
[1:31:23] something in me said god i need more of
[1:31:25] you
[1:31:26] and i'm not content to wait on the
[1:31:28] pastor to to spend the money and to do
[1:31:31] the thing but god you're here i should
[1:31:34] be where you are and where you are is
[1:31:36] where revival is and god i don't have to
[1:31:39] wait for that and i'm tired of waiting
[1:31:41] for that
[1:31:43] we sit in church sometimes just waiting
[1:31:45] for the thing to happen with no
[1:31:47] preparation of ourselves as if we expect
[1:31:50] god's just gonna you know god i'm i'm so
[1:31:52] miserable and so lost you're just gonna
[1:31:54] have to deliver me
[1:31:56] and praise god when he does that
[1:31:59] but should we wait on that should we
[1:32:01] camp out on that should we always just
[1:32:03] sit there and service feeling like god i
[1:32:05] can't do anything there's nothing i i'm
[1:32:07] just you're gonna have to just just pull
[1:32:09] me up again lord
[1:32:15] and we're waiting on god to just you
[1:32:16] know
[1:32:18] pump up the super soaker of holy ghost
[1:32:21] juice
[1:32:22] and
[1:32:23] you know start spraying in the service
[1:32:25] because there's no
[1:32:26] other way
[1:32:30] come on somebody
[1:32:35] let's go to him
[1:32:36] the wheat is where he is
[1:32:39] the wheat is where he is
[1:32:41] we can be where he is
[1:32:43] he's paved the way
[1:32:45] the cross made a way for us to be back
[1:32:47] in fellowship with him again
[1:32:49] so let's do it
[1:32:51] let's overcome let's let's take the
[1:32:53] overcomer's throne
[1:32:56] because that's what the scripture's
[1:32:57] telling us now is he's talking about
[1:32:59] christ being outside the church he
[1:33:01] doesn't have to be outside the church he
[1:33:02] can be in the church right now you can
[1:33:04] have a revival right now
[1:33:06] glory to god he can be with you now so
[1:33:09] to him since he can be with you now to
[1:33:12] him that overcometh all of these things
[1:33:15] to him that overcometh i will grant to
[1:33:17] sit with me in my throne even as i
[1:33:21] overcame
[1:33:23] so let's talk about overcoming now now
[1:33:25] now what
[1:33:26] we are to not what we are we overcome
[1:33:29] but how we overcome matters now
[1:33:33] now
[1:33:34] now
[1:33:35] i'm just going to be honest
[1:33:37] i had a real problem with this one
[1:33:40] brother trevor's intellect clashed with
[1:33:41] the prophet
[1:33:43] in a in a in a big way
[1:33:47] because like brother branham like okay
[1:33:50] that's nice but like we we need to know
[1:33:54] what it is we are to overcome you know
[1:33:56] there's a wall okay i have to overcome a
[1:33:57] wall what am i gonna need well i'm gonna
[1:33:58] need something to get me how i overcome
[1:34:01] is dictated by what is in front of me to
[1:34:04] overcome well i either need to be able
[1:34:06] to strong enough to jump six feet to
[1:34:08] grab a wall and then be strong enough to
[1:34:10] pull myself up and over it or i need
[1:34:12] another brother you know who can lift me
[1:34:14] up or something like that like
[1:34:16] how over is being well how to overcome
[1:34:19] is being dictated by what it is to
[1:34:21] overcome
[1:34:24] come on brother branham like what
[1:34:27] we need and then if i know what is
[1:34:30] overcoming
[1:34:31] then when i overcome it i can look back
[1:34:33] and go
[1:34:35] i was on that side now i'm on this side
[1:34:37] i overcame
[1:34:39] and it's so obvious and brother branham
[1:34:41] you're saying like it doesn't matter
[1:34:42] what you're supposed to overcome it's
[1:34:43] just how like stop no
[1:34:47] no okay so let's read and let's let him
[1:34:49] explain now jesus overcame by the word
[1:34:52] eve fell to the personal temptation of
[1:34:55] satan by failing to use the word
[1:34:58] adam fell in direct disobedience to the
[1:35:00] word but jesus overcame by the word
[1:35:05] now and right now
[1:35:07] let me say that this is the only way to
[1:35:09] be an overcomer
[1:35:10] also it is the only way that you can
[1:35:12] know if you were overcoming
[1:35:14] because that word
[1:35:17] can't
[1:35:18] fail
[1:35:21] so then when we start thinking like oh
[1:35:23] wait wait how we are to overcome is the
[1:35:26] same way that jesus christ overcame in
[1:35:28] the desert how we are to overcome is
[1:35:30] using the word so if we're gonna use the
[1:35:33] word to overcome then the thing in front
[1:35:36] of us the what doesn't matter anymore
[1:35:44] you're going to go to you're going to
[1:35:44] have battles it's like okay um
[1:35:48] how do you overcome the romans with
[1:35:49] their shields and sort
[1:35:51] short swords it's like you could
[1:35:53] approach the battle and go okay well you
[1:35:55] know in history you know a greek phalanx
[1:35:58] could do that because they had longer
[1:35:59] spears and different things and you
[1:36:01] could you know you could then begin to
[1:36:02] manipulate the things that overcome this
[1:36:05] thing overcomes that thing and that you
[1:36:06] know rock beats scissors and paper beats
[1:36:09] rock and you know
[1:36:11] all of those things yes now we've
[1:36:13] reduced the word down to rock paper
[1:36:14] scissors
[1:36:17] i don't know if we can have brother
[1:36:18] trevor back again
[1:36:21] the problem is the word is a nuclear
[1:36:23] bomb like you how do you how are you
[1:36:24] going to overcome the romans well we got
[1:36:26] to figure out how to overcome the romans
[1:36:27] well we have a nuclear bomb okay never
[1:36:29] mind
[1:36:30] that's over like how are we going to how
[1:36:32] are we going to overcome the greeks well
[1:36:33] we have a nuclear bomb
[1:36:34] okay i guess that's this is the word
[1:36:38] it is the most powerful thing i don't
[1:36:40] care what's in the way i don't care what
[1:36:42] needs to be overcome the word does it
[1:36:48] the word does it
[1:36:50] now notice again how jesus overcame the
[1:36:52] world systems of religion
[1:36:54] while he was repeatedly badgered by the
[1:36:55] theologians of his day he constantly
[1:36:57] applied the word he spoke only what the
[1:37:00] father gave him to speak there was not a
[1:37:02] time when the world was not utterly
[1:37:03] confused by his wisdom for it was the
[1:37:07] wisdom of god and let's just underline
[1:37:10] this little bit right here it was the
[1:37:12] wisdom of god you see jesus comes and he
[1:37:15] uses the word and jesus comes and let's
[1:37:17] say like matthew 5 six seven you know
[1:37:20] like like they're confused he's just
[1:37:22] giving the sermon on the mount and
[1:37:23] they're like wait how's this guy he's
[1:37:25] got such authority he's preaching so
[1:37:27] differently and and you know you you've
[1:37:29] heard it's been said
[1:37:32] you know
[1:37:33] he that you know he that kills his
[1:37:35] brother you know and he that all this
[1:37:37] but no no no if you're angry with your
[1:37:40] brother
[1:37:41] without a cause see jesus goes so much
[1:37:43] deeper
[1:37:45] with the word
[1:37:46] his wisdom of the word
[1:37:48] got to a deeper
[1:37:50] level than all of those other people
[1:37:54] his his his wisdom of god
[1:37:58] with the
[1:37:59] written pages
[1:38:01] went to a deeper level
[1:38:03] than all those around him
[1:38:08] the wisdom
[1:38:09] of god
[1:38:12] in his heart
[1:38:13] the revelation of god
[1:38:16] taking the written pages that he had and
[1:38:20] he understood it and knew it at a deeper
[1:38:23] level
[1:38:24] than all those around him
[1:38:31] are we together
[1:38:32] should i repeat that again
[1:38:34] because i'm i'm emphasizing something
[1:38:37] for a reason
[1:38:38] so let's hang on for just a moment and
[1:38:40] let's look at this now so so we need to
[1:38:43] overcome all that is in the world
[1:38:46] so first john 2 16 for all that is in
[1:38:49] the world
[1:38:51] oh
[1:38:52] john
[1:38:54] goodness
[1:38:56] you just you're giving us everything
[1:38:57] here
[1:38:58] now what all is in the world now we're
[1:39:00] gonna itemize the lust of the flesh the
[1:39:02] lust of the eyes the pride of life is
[1:39:04] not of the father
[1:39:06] but of the world so so now okay we got
[1:39:09] three things that we can break down
[1:39:11] overcoming all that is in the world into
[1:39:13] three buckets in our lives we got we got
[1:39:15] lust of the flesh we got lust of the
[1:39:17] eyes we got pride of life so now then
[1:39:19] then then wouldn't it be nice
[1:39:22] wouldn't it be nice if we saw like see
[1:39:24] jesus was our example right
[1:39:26] and wouldn't it be nice if we saw jesus
[1:39:29] overcoming each one of these things and
[1:39:32] if we could see how he overcame it then
[1:39:34] we could figure out how to overcome it
[1:39:36] in our lives too
[1:39:38] man that'd be amazing so turn to matthew
[1:39:40] chapter four
[1:39:42] there you go
[1:39:52] so matthew chapter four and verse one
[1:39:54] and i don't have slides for this one
[1:39:57] well i do but we're gonna wait on those
[1:40:00] for a second
[1:40:02] i don't have slides for the whole thing
[1:40:04] but i want to read this this little bit
[1:40:06] here probably 1 through 11 or something
[1:40:08] jesus was led up into the spirit into
[1:40:10] the wilderness to be tempted to the
[1:40:11] devil
[1:40:13] when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights
[1:40:16] he was afr afterward and hungered
[1:40:19] 40 days and 40 nights
[1:40:21] after that he was hungry
[1:40:24] [Music]
[1:40:29] hen's lunch
[1:40:31] when the tempter came to him he said if
[1:40:34] thou be the son of god command that
[1:40:36] these stones
[1:40:38] be made bread
[1:40:40] but he answered and said it is written
[1:40:41] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:40:43] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:40:44] mouth of god then the devil taketh him
[1:40:46] up into the holy city and setteth him on
[1:40:48] a pinnacle of the temple and he saith
[1:40:50] unto him
[1:40:51] if thou be the son of god cast thyself
[1:40:53] down for it is written he shall give his
[1:40:54] angels charged concerning thee and in
[1:40:56] their hands they shall bear thee up lest
[1:40:58] at any time thou dash thy foot against
[1:40:59] the stone jesus said it's written again
[1:41:02] thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god
[1:41:05] again the devil taketh him up into an
[1:41:06] exceeding high mountain and show with
[1:41:08] him all the kingdoms of the world and
[1:41:09] the glory of them and he said saith unto
[1:41:11] him all these things will i give thee if
[1:41:12] thou wilt fall down and worship me jesus
[1:41:14] sayeth unto him get thee hence satan for
[1:41:16] it is written thou shalt worship the
[1:41:18] lord thy god and him only shalt thou
[1:41:20] serve then the devil leaveth him and
[1:41:22] behold angels came and ministered unto
[1:41:25] him now now this is just message 101
[1:41:28] right here we know we defeat the devil
[1:41:30] by the word
[1:41:32] because we're message believers you know
[1:41:34] we place the high priority on the word
[1:41:37] it's the word the word the word the word
[1:41:40] and maybe you know you were 14 or 15 and
[1:41:42] you're like yeah i know it's the word
[1:41:43] but it's like
[1:41:45] you know like you preachers you're
[1:41:46] always like the word
[1:41:48] so amazing and i'm like
[1:41:51] okay i know that's right
[1:41:54] i know that's right
[1:41:55] but i don't
[1:41:57] i know i should feel that way
[1:42:00] but where is it in my life like how like
[1:42:03] what's the
[1:42:04] you know
[1:42:05] and so many of us our answer is is to
[1:42:08] just well become like them and just
[1:42:11] start saying yeah but the word you know
[1:42:14] you got to say it deeper and
[1:42:16] lengthen it out
[1:42:18] and because it sounds more spiritual
[1:42:19] that way and then you can be a better
[1:42:22] message believer because now you're
[1:42:24] saying it the way everyone else says it
[1:42:26] that apparently seems to have it all
[1:42:27] together
[1:42:29] that's it
[1:42:31] that's it
[1:42:33] so
[1:42:35] so thank god for the word
[1:42:38] all right god bless you you're dismissed
[1:42:39] like we just had cert like hey no give
[1:42:42] me something
[1:42:43] give me something i know that i'm
[1:42:45] supposed to
[1:42:46] defeat the devil with the word brother
[1:42:47] trevor tell me something i don't already
[1:42:50] know
[1:42:52] because sometimes brother trevor i'm
[1:42:54] tempted
[1:42:55] and i'm tempted hard i deal with things
[1:42:57] and i don't even want to tell anybody
[1:42:59] but i'm tempted and you want to tell me
[1:43:01] like like i'm sitting there being
[1:43:03] tempted with pornography and and i'm
[1:43:05] supposed to use the scripture that says
[1:43:06] flee youthful lusts
[1:43:08] like okay devil
[1:43:10] it's written
[1:43:11] flee youthful lusts ha
[1:43:16] got him
[1:43:20] i i don't
[1:43:22] somebody just said doesn't work like but
[1:43:23] sister it's the word
[1:43:31] help us jesus because why did it work
[1:43:34] for jesus well he was jesus it works for
[1:43:36] him obviously doesn't work for a loser
[1:43:38] like me
[1:43:41] apparently i need to just get better do
[1:43:43] better be more you know
[1:43:47] you know and get the i don't even know
[1:43:49] what i'm
[1:43:50] saying i just gotta
[1:43:56] write
[1:43:56] resist the devil and he'll flee from you
[1:43:59] that's easy yeah sure brother trevor
[1:44:01] craig that's resist the devil and
[1:44:02] healthy you just gotta think what is
[1:44:04] resistant devil i'm resisting you
[1:44:08] how
[1:44:11] how am i resisting the devil
[1:44:16] i'm waiting for a power outage
[1:44:18] that's how i'm resisting the devil
[1:44:26] [Music]
[1:44:29] so if we have the word
[1:44:31] and the word is the atomic bomb
[1:44:33] that can destroy any enemy
[1:44:36] any devil
[1:44:38] any thing that must be overcome can be
[1:44:41] overcome by the word with which we have
[1:44:48] and and
[1:44:50] oh
[1:44:50] where is it oh it's in my bible case i
[1:44:53] should have a message book with me
[1:44:54] you know which we have holding up a
[1:44:56] message book too like we've got these
[1:44:58] things
[1:45:02] spot me spot me which we have
[1:45:12] and yet
[1:45:13] we're told this defeats the devil
[1:45:16] and then our experience doesn't match
[1:45:18] what we're told
[1:45:20] and then i go
[1:45:23] so i have two options
[1:45:25] try to act like everything's okay and
[1:45:28] i'll just do it better next time or
[1:45:30] or
[1:45:31] or
[1:45:32] i'll just act more spiritual
[1:45:38] and everything's good
[1:45:41] because i certainly couldn't tell anyone
[1:45:43] else that anything's wrong
[1:45:46] because i got the word and they got the
[1:45:48] word and if something's wrong
[1:45:51] it can't be the word
[1:45:53] so it must be me
[1:45:56] but i don't know what to do i don't know
[1:45:58] how to defeat it because i have done
[1:46:01] what i told and i i said the thing
[1:46:06] take the name of jesus with you child of
[1:46:09] sorrow
[1:46:10] when temptations round you gather
[1:46:11] breathe that holy name in prayer
[1:46:17] oh jesus lord jesus christ
[1:46:21] still tempted
[1:46:24] now now this is not to say that you
[1:46:25] should never actually physically try to
[1:46:28] resist that you shouldn't actually try
[1:46:30] to you know build up right the correct
[1:46:32] kind of boundaries and barriers and you
[1:46:34] know that you should try to have you
[1:46:36] know your own little bit of legalism
[1:46:37] until you don't need it any longer like
[1:46:39] this is not to say any of those things
[1:46:41] i'm not saying that you shouldn't try to
[1:46:43] resist the devil of your own life i'm
[1:46:45] not saying that you shouldn't you know
[1:46:48] move the computer into the living room
[1:46:50] do the whatever needs to be done in your
[1:46:52] life you make good decisions you make
[1:46:55] right decisions and you just don't wait
[1:46:57] for the for god to just you know light
[1:47:00] you up with fire and just take it all
[1:47:02] away sometimes he will and sometimes he
[1:47:04] won't
[1:47:05] so praise god for his mercy when he does
[1:47:08] and god help me for those times that
[1:47:10] you're just teaching me to grow and to
[1:47:12] strengthen my life and to teach me the
[1:47:15] power of the word of god in my life
[1:47:17] because the word of god is powerful
[1:47:22] but we've been trying to intellectually
[1:47:24] duel with the devil for far too long
[1:47:26] we've been trying to say well i've got
[1:47:28] the word
[1:47:29] and that's good enough and as long as i
[1:47:31] know it up here and i can say okay the
[1:47:33] devil's trying to do this so i'm to take
[1:47:35] the word and i'm going to say this to
[1:47:37] him
[1:47:38] and i'm going to have this intellectual
[1:47:39] duel and at some point in time i'm going
[1:47:42] to get better at it than the devil
[1:47:50] i mean probably not
[1:47:53] so
[1:47:53] so brother trevor are you actually gonna
[1:47:55] tell us
[1:47:56] what to do
[1:47:58] now that you've just totally broke it
[1:47:59] all down and given us absolutely no hope
[1:48:02] we'll do it like jesus
[1:48:07] i was like
[1:48:08] isn't that what we were doing
[1:48:11] apparently not
[1:48:13] apparently not so how is jesus doing it
[1:48:15] now so let's go let's look at this let's
[1:48:17] look at matthew 4 3 the tempter came
[1:48:20] to him and said if thou be the son of
[1:48:21] god commanded these stones to be made
[1:48:22] bread
[1:48:24] but he answered and said it's written
[1:48:27] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:48:29] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:48:31] mouth of god if you would turn with me
[1:48:32] to deuteronomy
[1:48:34] i don't have deuteronomy on this slide
[1:48:35] so you're going to have to use your
[1:48:36] bible and turn there
[1:48:40] bible.is if you don't have
[1:48:42] the physical paper copy you can use that
[1:48:44] that's fine i
[1:48:45] i'm okay with that
[1:48:47] so we're gonna make a point here so so
[1:48:49] deuteronomy 8 3
[1:48:51] and he humbled thee suffered thee the
[1:48:53] hunger fed thee with manna which thou
[1:48:55] knewest not neither did thy fathers know
[1:48:57] that he might make thee know that man
[1:49:00] doth not live by bread only but by every
[1:49:02] word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
[1:49:04] the lord doth man live
[1:49:08] this is what jesus is quoting
[1:49:10] deuteronomy
[1:49:12] chapter eight
[1:49:14] verse three
[1:49:15] when's the last time you got in a battle
[1:49:16] with the devil and you decided you know
[1:49:18] what i'm gonna go to
[1:49:19] deuteronomy
[1:49:23] not psalms
[1:49:24] not the new testament i'm going to
[1:49:26] deuteronomy
[1:49:28] that's all jesus did
[1:49:31] how does jesus just get to pull
[1:49:33] why does jesus know deuteronomy 8 3 i i
[1:49:37] why does he have that memorized i don't
[1:49:38] know because i didn't
[1:49:41] but why does he go to deuteronomy 8 3
[1:49:43] man shall not live by bread alone the
[1:49:44] man's been in the wilderness for 40 days
[1:49:47] 40 nights he's hungry any any any any
[1:49:51] one of us are thinking like man if i
[1:49:52] have power after 40 days to turn a rock
[1:49:54] into bread it's like rock your bread
[1:49:56] like it's just
[1:49:58] i'm just doing it
[1:50:00] i'm hungry
[1:50:02] and jesus says no no man shall not live
[1:50:04] by bread alone
[1:50:06] so wait a second like why is jesus going
[1:50:09] there though
[1:50:10] is it just because well he's tempting me
[1:50:12] with food find okay rolodex of
[1:50:14] scriptures about food
[1:50:16] bing found one deuteronomy 8 3 use the
[1:50:18] use the anti-food temptation scripture
[1:50:20] against the devil
[1:50:24] because that's what we
[1:50:25] look i'll say just that's what i do
[1:50:29] when i started studying this this
[1:50:30] challenged me deeper in my walk to be
[1:50:33] deeper with god than than any sermon to
[1:50:36] date that i've studied
[1:50:40] because i recognize that's what i do
[1:50:43] i'm looking through the rolodex to find
[1:50:45] the thing that cancels that thing
[1:50:50] but it's deeper than that for jesus
[1:50:52] you see jesus the devil's trying to
[1:50:55] tempt him jesus yes he's hungry he can
[1:50:58] be tempted by that but jesus is jesus
[1:51:01] recognizes what the devil's trying to do
[1:51:03] the devil is trying to get him to stop
[1:51:06] looking and to stop realizing that the
[1:51:09] word of god is sufficient
[1:51:11] you say okay that's great trevor we know
[1:51:13] that but no we
[1:51:15] we need to take that and let the wisdom
[1:51:18] of god that jesus had that confused
[1:51:20] everyone else and we need that wisdom we
[1:51:23] need that revelation of what the
[1:51:25] scriptures are saying to us because when
[1:51:28] jesus said man shall not live by every
[1:51:31] word what he's doing is he's taking the
[1:51:33] devil back into some history and saying
[1:51:36] you know what there was a time in
[1:51:38] history when god's children were hungry
[1:51:41] but they were following a pillar of fire
[1:51:43] and as they followed the pillar of fire
[1:51:46] as they got hungry their hunger didn't
[1:51:48] matter because they were with the pillar
[1:51:50] of fire and when they needed food the
[1:51:53] manna fell
[1:51:56] so i could be tempted to just throw
[1:51:58] everything away when i get hungry but i
[1:52:01] gotta recognize that if i stayed with
[1:52:04] the word if i stayed with god and i
[1:52:07] truly believed him the hunger is going
[1:52:10] to be taken care of because i've got the
[1:52:13] thing that's more important and so jesus
[1:52:16] is taking the devil back to absolute
[1:52:19] history to absolute fact and not only is
[1:52:22] jesus taking him there he's showing the
[1:52:25] devil not only do i know that this
[1:52:28] happened in the past but i've come to a
[1:52:30] place where i've believed this so
[1:52:33] thoroughly where i've understood the
[1:52:36] word to such a place where it's become
[1:52:39] so real to me that my experience with
[1:52:42] the word tells me that you could try to
[1:52:45] tempt me with bread when i'm really
[1:52:48] hungry and try to get me to throw away
[1:52:50] the word of god for a morsel of bread
[1:52:55] but i know that god's word will provide
[1:53:01] in its own like it's temptation because
[1:53:04] the devil's tempting him but in another
[1:53:07] sense it's not temptation the devil has
[1:53:10] nothing on the revelation that the man
[1:53:13] jesus christ had in his heart
[1:53:18] amen how do you defeat the devil
[1:53:20] with the word
[1:53:23] but that kind of word with the wisdom of
[1:53:26] god coupled with the written page down
[1:53:30] in the inside becoming a reality you say
[1:53:34] how do you do that brother trevor oh
[1:53:36] you're gonna spend time in prayer you're
[1:53:38] gonna spend time in meditation you're
[1:53:40] going to spend time reading
[1:53:42] you're not just going to spend time
[1:53:44] wandering around and just merely
[1:53:47] following just coming to church and
[1:53:49] doing the motions it's more than the
[1:53:51] motions church you're not here this
[1:53:54] morning for the motions you're here this
[1:53:57] morning to hear from almighty god that
[1:53:59] he might quicken his word into your
[1:54:01] heart that it would strengthen you and
[1:54:04] make you more than you ever thought you
[1:54:06] could be and that's what this word is
[1:54:08] that's what this message is
[1:54:11] the power to overcome the power to
[1:54:13] realize that if i needed food and jesus
[1:54:16] goes and he's going to prove this later
[1:54:19] 5 000 people come to hear me preach and
[1:54:22] they don't have food hey disciples take
[1:54:24] that boy's lunch no it's okay you're not
[1:54:26] really he'll get his lunch don't worry
[1:54:28] grab that boy's lunch and start handing
[1:54:30] it out to the people why because the
[1:54:32] word meant more than the bread
[1:54:39] amen
[1:54:40] it wasn't bandying scriptures
[1:54:42] intellectually it wasn't hot devil i got
[1:54:45] you you're trying to tempt me and i know
[1:54:47] that man doesn't live by bread alone but
[1:54:48] by every word
[1:54:50] take that bam
[1:54:52] what you got
[1:54:54] i'm a message believer i've been in
[1:54:55] church for 40 years now
[1:54:57] i know it
[1:55:02] get over it
[1:55:04] get in it
[1:55:07] let's realize what this is
[1:55:10] that this is this gospel is the power of
[1:55:12] god to salvation
[1:55:15] this word is powerful and if it's not
[1:55:18] powerful in your life let's get in it
[1:55:21] and say god i need the revelation of it
[1:55:24] i want the word like jesus had it i want
[1:55:26] it real
[1:55:28] see there's a big difference there
[1:55:32] there's something greater than bread
[1:55:34] so the lust of the eye matthew 4 6 if
[1:55:36] thou be the son of god cast thyself down
[1:55:38] for it is written he shall give his
[1:55:39] angels charge over thee and in their
[1:55:42] hands they shall bear thee up lest at
[1:55:43] any time that dash they put against the
[1:55:45] stone
[1:55:48] you say well how is this the lust of the
[1:55:49] eye well
[1:55:52] what's he saying here he's saying
[1:55:55] if thou be the son of god
[1:55:59] just just do this
[1:56:00] like
[1:56:03] the word is for you
[1:56:05] you can just do what you need to do with
[1:56:07] the word
[1:56:09] right hasn't
[1:56:10] aren't you a believer aren't you bride
[1:56:13] well just
[1:56:15] just do this
[1:56:18] jesus saith unto him it is written again
[1:56:21] thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god
[1:56:24] you see it comes to a point where we
[1:56:26] recognize the word is primary not what i
[1:56:28] want done with the word is primary
[1:56:31] was that a mouthful was that a statement
[1:56:33] right there let's just let's just let
[1:56:34] that the word is primary
[1:56:37] not what i want done with the word
[1:56:41] well what do you want done with the word
[1:56:42] well you could just do this
[1:56:44] you know
[1:56:46] prove god
[1:56:49] you need you know
[1:56:51] you need 10 000 bitcoin in your wallet
[1:56:53] you just prove god
[1:56:55] put 10 10 000 bitcoins in your bitcoin
[1:56:57] wallet here everybody hold up your
[1:56:59] bitcoin wallet and say i'm just trying
[1:57:01] to update it to 2022 i don't know um i
[1:57:03] left my wallet actually in the office so
[1:57:07] it's in the pocket there brother stay
[1:57:08] out of it
[1:57:12] like we've heard that kind of preaching
[1:57:14] we've seen that kind of preaching
[1:57:16] oh just prove god intent
[1:57:18] that's the tempting of god
[1:57:20] because now jesus is taking the devil
[1:57:22] back and he's saying thou shalt not
[1:57:25] tempt the lord by god and it's like okay
[1:57:27] that's that's nice that's easy but what
[1:57:29] is he saying he's taking him back to
[1:57:31] deuteronomy six so now again jesus using
[1:57:34] deuteronomy to defeat the devil you
[1:57:36] didn't know you defeat the devil with
[1:57:37] deuteronomy but you do so deuteronomy
[1:57:39] chapter 6 you should still be close to
[1:57:41] that maybe deuteronomy chapter 6
[1:57:44] verse 16
[1:57:46] you shall not tempt the lord your god as
[1:57:49] he tempted him in masa
[1:57:52] so jesus is saying ha see i got you i
[1:57:54] i've got a verse for that no he's not
[1:57:56] saying that what is this scripture
[1:57:57] talking about this scripture is going
[1:57:58] back to i think it's a
[1:58:00] exodus 17
[1:58:02] where they have no water but this is the
[1:58:04] second time the israelites have no water
[1:58:06] the first time they come to to the
[1:58:09] waters of mara the waters are bitter
[1:58:11] they're thirsty they can't drink the
[1:58:12] water moses what do we do we throw a
[1:58:15] tree in the water that's what we do we
[1:58:16] just add calvary to the situation makes
[1:58:18] everything good
[1:58:21] they have water
[1:58:22] then they come now to a next the next
[1:58:25] point to this maza or meribah and and
[1:58:28] and and and well well
[1:58:32] moses
[1:58:33] we don't have water again
[1:58:35] is god with us or not
[1:58:41] and so jesus just say remember devil
[1:58:44] remember when the children of israel
[1:58:46] were in
[1:58:47] the wilderness and they wandered around
[1:58:48] and they tempted god and said god are
[1:58:51] you with us or not
[1:58:54] and god showed them over and over and
[1:58:57] over again that he was with them
[1:58:59] i don't have to worry
[1:59:01] i don't have to i don't have to prove
[1:59:03] that god is with me i don't have to trip
[1:59:05] over a rock i don't have to throw myself
[1:59:08] over a cliff i don't have to put ten to
[1:59:11] proclaim ten thousand bitcoin into my
[1:59:13] bitcoin wallet and wait for that to
[1:59:14] happen to show me that jesus is with me
[1:59:17] it's not about what i want done with the
[1:59:18] word it's not it's not about any of
[1:59:20] those things it's about he said so
[1:59:24] he's proved it over and over again and
[1:59:27] jesus could look back in history and
[1:59:29] again it's not just a history lesson
[1:59:31] that he has no experience with but it's
[1:59:34] something that he realizes is absolutely
[1:59:37] truth not just knowing it truth but
[1:59:40] having an experience and a revelation
[1:59:42] something that binds in his heart so
[1:59:44] deeply that says devil i cannot be moved
[1:59:47] you don't have to you i don't have to go
[1:59:49] through circumstances to show me that
[1:59:52] god is with me i know
[1:59:55] he's with me i feel him it's real and
[1:59:58] it's not just you know that i'm saying
[2:00:00] the words because we say these words
[2:00:02] sometimes and we don't know it but
[2:00:04] there's a time that it's truth that it
[2:00:06] comes there and it says i know that god
[2:00:08] is with me i know that he's real
[2:00:13] and he'd never leave me that he'd never
[2:00:15] forsake me so i don't have to tempt him
[2:00:18] devil i already know
[2:00:21] i already know
[2:00:23] i don't have to battle with him with the
[2:00:25] word in my mind because the word is in
[2:00:28] my heart the revelation's so deep the
[2:00:31] devil doesn't have it coming
[2:00:36] this is what it means to overcome by the
[2:00:38] word to let the word become real not to
[2:00:41] just know the history not to just know
[2:00:43] the words not just to be able to quote
[2:00:45] the words but to recognize the truth of
[2:00:48] all ages coming down and resonating and
[2:00:51] becoming a platform of stability for you
[2:00:55] to stand on that you know i'm standing
[2:00:58] here and i shall not be moved
[2:01:02] hallelujah
[2:01:04] so then we see we come to the pride of
[2:01:06] life the devil take him up to an
[2:01:07] exceeding high mountain show with him
[2:01:09] all the kingdoms of the world
[2:01:12] and the glory of them
[2:01:14] and saith unto them all these things
[2:01:16] will i give thee if thou fall down and
[2:01:18] worship me
[2:01:19] so jesus is tempted with power and
[2:01:21] authority over all things
[2:01:24] without going through trials
[2:01:27] without going through character building
[2:01:29] things
[2:01:32] you don't want a leader that goes
[2:01:33] through that becomes powerful without
[2:01:36] going through trials
[2:01:38] because he'll have no character
[2:01:41] so jesus is tempted with this
[2:01:43] and again he takes the devil
[2:01:46] to deuteronomy
[2:01:48] chapter 6.
[2:01:51] verses 13 to 14 thou shalt fear the lord
[2:01:53] thy god
[2:01:54] serve him
[2:01:55] shalt swear by his name you shall not go
[2:01:57] after other gods the gods of the people
[2:01:59] which are round about you for the lord
[2:02:00] thy god is a jealous god among you lest
[2:02:02] the anger of the lord thy god be kindled
[2:02:04] against thee to destroy thee from off
[2:02:06] the face of the earth
[2:02:08] so jesus says it's written satan
[2:02:12] get thee hence for it is written thou
[2:02:15] shalt worship the lord thy god and him
[2:02:17] only
[2:02:18] shalt thou serve
[2:02:21] jesus is taking the devil back in
[2:02:22] history again
[2:02:24] and he's saying you know what we had
[2:02:26] this law satan
[2:02:28] and it wasn't just a law though like it
[2:02:30] was a law satan but
[2:02:32] but it wasn't just a law like it was
[2:02:34] obvious wasn't it
[2:02:36] like when the children of israel come to
[2:02:38] mount sinai and they go off into into
[2:02:41] worshiping a golden calf already like
[2:02:44] okay
[2:02:45] like what were they thinking
[2:02:48] because the last gods that they had
[2:02:50] encountered
[2:02:51] were the gods of the egyptians
[2:02:55] did you know that the egyptians even had
[2:02:56] a frog god
[2:02:58] and it was it was unlawful for egyptians
[2:03:00] to kill a frog
[2:03:06] that's a problem
[2:03:13] i just love what god does there just
[2:03:15] like oh you have this god
[2:03:17] here you go
[2:03:19] have some frogs you can't kill
[2:03:22] what you gonna do
[2:03:25] when almighty god the only god the only
[2:03:28] true god
[2:03:30] comes and thrashes your intellectual
[2:03:32] conception that you've made from you've
[2:03:34] twisted some some truth
[2:03:37] over and over and over again so you got
[2:03:39] to a place where you have a god that's a
[2:03:41] frog that you worship but jesus is god's
[2:03:43] gonna come in and he's gonna send so
[2:03:45] many frogs amongst you that you will
[2:03:48] hate the very sight of frogs and wish
[2:03:51] like anything
[2:03:53] that you weren't bound by this
[2:03:54] ridiculous rule that you can't kill the
[2:03:58] thousand frogs that are in your home
[2:04:03] they had they had things the priests
[2:04:05] would would sprinkle dusts and
[2:04:07] ceremonies so so god tells moses hey
[2:04:10] grab the dust
[2:04:12] do like their priests
[2:04:14] sprinkle it around
[2:04:16] and it's going to be lice
[2:04:19] there's going to be flies there's going
[2:04:20] to be every single thing the egyptians
[2:04:23] worshipped at one time god come walking
[2:04:26] right through and said nope not a god
[2:04:30] nope not a god
[2:04:32] nope not a god that's three nope not a
[2:04:35] god that's for nope not a god that's
[2:04:38] five nope not a god that's six that one
[2:04:41] nope not a god that's seven nope not a
[2:04:44] god nope not a god no
[2:04:47] not a god
[2:04:52] man this this law in exodus chapter 20
[2:04:55] like
[2:04:57] thou shalt have no other gods before me
[2:05:02] is that a law
[2:05:03] or is that just
[2:05:05] obvious
[2:05:06] well it was obvious to jesus
[2:05:10] because jesus knew devil i'm not just
[2:05:12] throwing a scripture at you
[2:05:13] but i'm throwing at you the
[2:05:15] understanding the revelation in my heart
[2:05:17] of the truth of the matter that thou
[2:05:20] shalt have no other gods before him that
[2:05:23] you should worship no other god because
[2:05:26] well guess what there isn't any other
[2:05:28] god but him and i'm not gonna set
[2:05:30] anything up to that that might be
[2:05:33] worshiped because if i worship something
[2:05:35] else other than god i know god at some
[2:05:38] point is gonna come walking right
[2:05:41] through that thing and say nope
[2:05:44] not a god
[2:05:46] so devil
[2:05:47] why would i worship you to achieve some
[2:05:51] good end when all that's gonna happen is
[2:05:54] god will take the rebelliousness of my
[2:05:56] heart and destroy me why
[2:06:00] because he is the only god
[2:06:05] and him only shall thou serve and the
[2:06:09] reality of that situation had come so
[2:06:12] deep inside of christ that this
[2:06:15] temptation from the devil again
[2:06:18] not just a scriptural i know the word
[2:06:21] and i'm
[2:06:22] flinging it at you devil no it's more
[2:06:24] than that it's a reality
[2:06:27] it's a truth
[2:06:29] amen
[2:06:31] church this is how we should have the
[2:06:32] word of god this is how we're going to
[2:06:33] overcome all the wor world
[2:06:37] is not just by understanding
[2:06:40] not just by reading and having it in our
[2:06:43] heads and look we we recite the word we
[2:06:46] teach it in sunday school memorize the
[2:06:48] word these are wonderful things these
[2:06:50] are the starting points they're not the
[2:06:52] ending points the starting points to the
[2:06:55] end that the spirit which catches the
[2:06:57] word brings that thing down into your
[2:06:59] heart to your spirit and that's the
[2:07:01] thing that's got life in it it becomes
[2:07:03] real to you and i challenge you church
[2:07:06] if the word hasn't become real to you
[2:07:08] yet
[2:07:10] let's go
[2:07:13] there's more for you
[2:07:16] why would we wander farther and do
[2:07:19] church things and do message things and
[2:07:22] all of this culture that we've created
[2:07:25] and we like it and it's wonderful and
[2:07:26] it's just how we do life but that isn't
[2:07:29] the point
[2:07:30] the point is the word of god that he
[2:07:33] sent us in this last day re restoring
[2:07:36] all things to where we're not worshiping
[2:07:39] any other god we're not tempting god and
[2:07:42] saying god are you even with us
[2:07:46] we're not
[2:07:48] what's the other one that i've missed
[2:07:50] you know
[2:07:51] we're not we're not we're not tempting
[2:07:52] him we're not okay let me go through my
[2:07:54] slides
[2:07:56] and we're not taking our eyes off of him
[2:07:58] and we're not looking for any we don't
[2:08:00] need anything else but him
[2:08:05] let's let that become real amen
[2:08:09] okay i'm a little over time we're gonna
[2:08:10] go over a couple more slides
[2:08:14] now notice how jesus overcame the world
[2:08:16] systems of religion
[2:08:18] he was repeatedly badgered by the
[2:08:20] theologians of his day
[2:08:22] he constantly applied
[2:08:25] the word
[2:08:26] he spake only what the father gave him
[2:08:29] to speak
[2:08:30] there was not a time when the world was
[2:08:32] not utterly confused by his wisdom for
[2:08:34] it was the wisdom of god but let's go
[2:08:35] back let's go back one slide he
[2:08:37] constantly
[2:08:39] applied the word
[2:08:41] because he knew the truth of the word he
[2:08:43] constantly applied the word every
[2:08:45] situation in his life he applied the
[2:08:47] word to it every question in his life he
[2:08:49] applied the word to it every time he was
[2:08:51] at a crossroads he applied the word to
[2:08:53] it he constantly applied the word apply
[2:08:56] the word in your life let it become real
[2:08:59] let it become reality don't just don't
[2:09:01] just dwell
[2:09:02] look the church systems pushed him out
[2:09:06] when they made a system of religion when
[2:09:08] they when they made it not about him
[2:09:13] and made it about
[2:09:14] the stuff
[2:09:16] stop making it about religious
[2:09:18] messaging stuff
[2:09:20] apply the word in your life
[2:09:27] it's not stuff
[2:09:29] it's the word
[2:09:33] it's real
[2:09:35] it's living it's alive it's active it's
[2:09:39] it's a discerner of the thoughts and the
[2:09:41] intents of the heart go ahead and let
[2:09:43] the word discern the thoughts and
[2:09:45] intents of your heart oh it doesn't have
[2:09:47] to be a prophet standing up on a
[2:09:49] platform going i see this in your life
[2:09:51] and i see this in your life and that's
[2:09:52] how we use that scripture and amen
[2:09:54] that's how that scripture was applied
[2:09:56] but not only that but the word of god
[2:09:59] can come on the inside of your heart and
[2:10:01] as you dwell on it in some time in
[2:10:04] prayer and some time in meditation the
[2:10:06] word of god can cut and divide asunder
[2:10:10] the thoughts and intents of your own
[2:10:12] heart and make those things real to you
[2:10:14] where you could go oh
[2:10:16] god
[2:10:18] that one was a little rough there lord
[2:10:19] like
[2:10:20] i want this though and he's like yeah i
[2:10:22] know and i just showed you you want that
[2:10:25] and it's not my will
[2:10:30] hallelujah oh hebrews 4 12 an action
[2:10:34] not just a memory verse but a reality
[2:10:36] verse
[2:10:37] i said it wasn't just a memory verse but
[2:10:39] it's a reality verse it's time we take
[2:10:42] memory verses and take them to reality
[2:10:44] verses
[2:10:50] let the word discern your heart
[2:10:52] and when and constantly apply it
[2:10:55] over and over and over and over and over
[2:10:58] and over till you realize what am i
[2:11:00] applying the word to the word
[2:11:03] like i've become it so much i'm applying
[2:11:06] so much it's becoming so real and and
[2:11:09] and there are you know we we i mentioned
[2:11:11] this in our church you know we've had a
[2:11:13] family that's god has just just
[2:11:15] just changed their lives and it's just
[2:11:18] it's more than one family really and
[2:11:19] it's just but you see there's lives and
[2:11:21] and i was preaching i was like you know
[2:11:23] there's there's people it's like you
[2:11:25] look back two years in your life you
[2:11:26] look back three years in your life and
[2:11:28] you go
[2:11:32] oh i can't believe that i was doing that
[2:11:35] i can't believe that that was even a
[2:11:37] thing in my life
[2:11:39] it's like god has changed me so much
[2:11:42] that's what we're talking about like you
[2:11:44] don't even have the desire for that
[2:11:46] anymore because of the word
[2:11:50] there's things that you're dealing with
[2:11:52] and that you're battling there's
[2:11:53] temptations in your life that you're d
[2:11:55] you know that are that are tough
[2:11:57] but think back on that that the last
[2:12:00] thing that god delivered you from and
[2:12:01] how you're like man that was ridiculous
[2:12:04] how did i even battle that in my life
[2:12:08] guess what
[2:12:10] it can happen again
[2:12:14] because that's how jesus defeated the
[2:12:17] devil every time was through the word
[2:12:21] but not through mental but through
[2:12:23] coming to places where the word became
[2:12:25] so real those things were he's looking
[2:12:27] at that going
[2:12:29] was that ever even an issue in my life
[2:12:31] how could it have been an issue it's so
[2:12:34] ridiculous to even think about because
[2:12:36] now i get it
[2:12:38] there's no value in that thing anymore
[2:12:40] because there's value here and i see it
[2:12:43] now
[2:12:44] and i'm not just trying to become
[2:12:46] something i'm not but literally the word
[2:12:48] of god is being quickened in my heart
[2:12:51] this is christianity church this is the
[2:12:53] message of the hour to become power in
[2:12:56] your life to overcome everything
[2:12:59] if you let it
[2:13:01] if you'll let it calm if you let it do
[2:13:04] the work stop just trying to go okay
[2:13:07] yeah we do the thing we do the thing i'm
[2:13:08] a believer i'm a believer
[2:13:12] i bet there's been i have carried a
[2:13:14] message book and had a message patch on
[2:13:16] my on my arm and told talked about this
[2:13:18] for every single sermon i've ever
[2:13:20] preached at this church probably
[2:13:24] most of them
[2:13:26] this is not a message believer
[2:13:29] someone who walks around with a message
[2:13:30] book and can well because you know what
[2:13:32] that is you see jesus was repeatedly
[2:13:35] badgered by theologians of his day
[2:13:40] there was a lot of theological badgers
[2:13:45] there was a lot of
[2:13:46] yeah next slide
[2:13:48] next slide
[2:13:50] there was a lot of theological badgers
[2:13:58] their little spectacles
[2:14:00] their little stripe tie
[2:14:02] their little message book under the arm
[2:14:03] you know brother
[2:14:06] you know what it says see i've been
[2:14:07] seeing your life and
[2:14:09] you know
[2:14:11] the message says
[2:14:17] let's go brother you see what it says
[2:14:19] right here overcome the devil with the
[2:14:21] word
[2:14:34] i don't want to say not a believer
[2:14:36] but certainly not a good one
[2:14:39] all right there's so much more yeah
[2:14:42] it's so much more deep
[2:14:44] so much more moving
[2:14:46] so much more filling
[2:14:50] god help us i wish i could just um what
[2:14:54] i feel in my heart about this i've been
[2:14:56] there i've been that guy
[2:14:59] i knew i was that guy and i didn't just
[2:15:02] it's not that just saying look brother
[2:15:03] this look
[2:15:05] please brother god's word says this
[2:15:08] let it become a reality that's not being
[2:15:10] a theological badger i'm i'm i'm trying
[2:15:12] to help him i'm trying to pull him up
[2:15:14] i'm not just trying to beat him over the
[2:15:15] head with the word and take out my word
[2:15:17] sword and
[2:15:19] man
[2:15:21] because my doctrine's better who cares
[2:15:24] we're in the end time church he's come
[2:15:26] in church he's coming
[2:15:30] and there's so much for us that we leave
[2:15:33] on the table
[2:15:35] for whatever reason it is i don't know
[2:15:38] but god help us to stop letting that be
[2:15:40] our the sum total of our message
[2:15:42] experience
[2:15:44] and that's why i have a stupid picture
[2:15:46] up there so you'll never forget it don't
[2:15:50] be that
[2:15:55] amen
[2:15:57] not when there's a reality
[2:15:59] jesus constantly applied the word
[2:16:01] he takes the book of deuteronomy
[2:16:05] and he applies the word
[2:16:07] the book of deuteronomy
[2:16:10] like we struggle to read the book of
[2:16:11] deuteronomy jesus supplies the book of
[2:16:13] deuteronomy where are we at
[2:16:16] like this this as i studied this sermon
[2:16:18] i said god
[2:16:20] make my study and my my just plain
[2:16:22] reading of the word so much deeper
[2:16:26] may i not just look and read the words
[2:16:29] may i not just understand the history
[2:16:31] but god
[2:16:32] may the revelation of what's going on of
[2:16:34] what you're actually saying
[2:16:37] may i be like gee may i become like
[2:16:40] jesus on the mount preaching saying it's
[2:16:43] not just eye for an eye tooth for a
[2:16:45] tooth it's not just you know don't don't
[2:16:48] don't commit adultery but don't even
[2:16:50] lust don't even look at it my desire for
[2:16:52] you is so much deeper god help me to get
[2:16:55] into the depth of the word to understand
[2:16:58] it have the revelation of the word
[2:16:59] church we ought to like this should
[2:17:01] illustrate what the prophet told us we
[2:17:04] ought to pray for revelation more than
[2:17:06] anything else
[2:17:10] not understanding
[2:17:12] revelation
[2:17:19] jesus didn't just
[2:17:21] oh where's my notes because i want to go
[2:17:23] through this thing
[2:17:26] he constantly applied the word the
[2:17:28] musicians can come
[2:17:29] i'm going to try to end right here
[2:17:37] he doesn't just debate the word
[2:17:41] he doesn't just talk about the word
[2:17:46] he doesn't just wander around the word
[2:17:49] he doesn't just hang out with other
[2:17:51] people
[2:17:52] who do the same things as he does
[2:17:57] whatever it could be said
[2:18:00] that we do with the word
[2:18:02] it wasn't what jesus was doing
[2:18:04] he was constantly
[2:18:06] applying the word
[2:18:10] constantly applying the word
[2:18:13] why
[2:18:14] because he knew the word was real
[2:18:17] he wasn't just applying the words
[2:18:20] he was applying the word
[2:18:22] the truth the thought the revelation of
[2:18:25] it
[2:18:26] that was there before the foundation of
[2:18:28] the world before anything was in being
[2:18:30] the word was
[2:18:31] was there and was truth and was power
[2:18:35] and when the word spoken said let there
[2:18:36] be light there was
[2:18:39] so let the word speak in your life
[2:18:41] because it's trying to
[2:18:44] the word of god is trying to push itself
[2:18:47] into your life
[2:18:50] the word of god is trying to come into
[2:18:52] your heart and it's trying to say let
[2:18:55] there be
[2:18:56] light
[2:19:02] constantly pushing constantly pushing
[2:19:05] and some of us run from it and some of
[2:19:07] us try to you know we try to do all
[2:19:10] kinds of things and we we we want to be
[2:19:12] part of it we want to i want to do this
[2:19:14] for you god i want to do this when god's
[2:19:15] just saying i'm trying to let light come
[2:19:17] in
[2:19:19] i want the word to be real
[2:19:24] quit with the stuff
[2:19:26] it's too late it's too late to do the
[2:19:28] stuff it's too late to think the stuff
[2:19:30] does anything for you it's time to let
[2:19:32] the reality of this word come and sink
[2:19:34] down into your heart like joshua and
[2:19:36] caleb that they knew that when moses
[2:19:39] said we go take a promised land that
[2:19:41] wasn't just stuff we talked about but it
[2:19:43] was stuff that they were going to say
[2:19:45] this is a reality in my life get out of
[2:19:49] the way and give me my mountain
[2:19:52] because let there be light had been
[2:19:53] spoken in their hearts
[2:19:55] because you have a promise you can have
[2:19:57] had been spoken in their hearts because
[2:19:59] they began to get out of the way they
[2:20:01] had seen others who were trying to say
[2:20:03] well i'm a levite well i'm a i'm a this
[2:20:05] and i'm a that and i'm a i'm a child of
[2:20:07] israel
[2:20:11] well i'm a message believer
[2:20:15] but has let there be light
[2:20:19] impacted your soul
[2:20:21] has the word become to be alive and
[2:20:23] active and real inside of you
[2:20:26] because that's what it's about church
[2:20:29] and i myself
[2:20:31] when i read this bible from here on out
[2:20:34] and i still fail i still struggle myself
[2:20:37] i still do all kinds of stupidness but
[2:20:39] god as i read this word may continue to
[2:20:42] become more alive to me may it not be
[2:20:45] words on a page but it may it be reality
[2:20:53] so
[2:20:56] what is it that you're standing on
[2:20:58] is it the word of god
[2:21:01] or is it your
[2:21:04] culture of the word
[2:21:08] because jesus christ is standing on the
[2:21:09] outside of the culture of the word
[2:21:12] trying to get in
[2:21:14] jesus christ is on the outside of
[2:21:18] people that have just decided i'm an
[2:21:20] s.a.t member
[2:21:22] and he's trying to get in
[2:21:25] not just trying
[2:21:28] pressing his way
[2:21:30] pushing his way ignore it no longer
[2:21:32] church he is knocking knocking
[2:21:39] can i come in
[2:21:41] let me in
[2:21:43] let the word come in
[2:21:46] and change your life forever
[2:21:50] let it be reality
[2:21:52] let us pray heavenly father lord
[2:21:57] our hearts are full and struck by this
[2:21:59] lord jesus
[2:22:01] may we look and be real honest with
[2:22:03] ourselves lord may your word come in the
[2:22:06] inside lord
[2:22:07] and begin to discern our thoughts in the
[2:22:09] intents of our hearts
[2:22:10] discern whether or not we've lord
[2:22:12] [Music]
[2:22:15] whether we've pushed you outside through
[2:22:17] our creeds and traditions and our dogmas
[2:22:20] and our
[2:22:22] god
[2:22:25] may we never be guilty of such a thing
[2:22:27] ever again
[2:22:29] may we open this morning the doors of
[2:22:32] our hearts
[2:22:33] fling them wide open and invite you to
[2:22:35] come in father
[2:22:37] over and over again lord say yes come be
[2:22:40] with us
[2:22:41] not just you know lord just the thought
[2:22:43] of it but lord let the reality of the
[2:22:45] word come on the inside
[2:22:47] who you are you're you're very qualities
[2:22:50] lord your very characters lord may as we
[2:22:52] read the word we understand your
[2:22:54] character better
[2:22:58] open our eyes to see it oh god
[2:23:03] bless us lord
[2:23:05] with that word
[2:23:08] but not in mind only lord
[2:23:11] but father may you grant us more and
[2:23:13] more and more revelation o god
[2:23:18] blessed be your holy name
[2:23:21] lord if those
[2:23:26] i just pray lord that you just go to
[2:23:27] every heart and speak to them wherever
[2:23:29] they're at lord i don't even know and i
[2:23:30] wouldn't presume to speak where anyone
[2:23:32] would be lord but lord would your spirit
[2:23:35] lord not me but but hebrews 4 12
[2:23:39] discern the thoughts of people's hearts
[2:23:41] lord and reveal it to them
[2:23:43] show them lord where they need you and
[2:23:45] what they might change what they might
[2:23:47] repent of what they might run from
[2:23:48] father
[2:23:50] and how the word can
[2:23:52] strengthen their lives
[2:23:54] and be that atomic bomb
[2:23:57] destroys every enemy
[2:23:59] destroys every devil
[2:24:03] may we dwell in it lord

[2:29:26] i certainly appreciate the word from

[2:29:32] early this morning
[2:29:35] i had to teach
[2:29:37] on the uh eight o'clock call that i do
[2:29:40] and
[2:29:41] my
[2:29:44] my topic was on overcoming
[2:29:46] and
[2:29:47] using the scripture
[2:29:49] revelation 12 i believe 11 it says that
[2:29:52] they overcame him
[2:29:55] by the blood of the lamb
[2:29:57] and by the word of their testimony
[2:29:59] and you know just uh my encouragement
[2:30:02] has been that is a
[2:30:04] past tense scripture and a future tense
[2:30:07] scripture
[2:30:08] and i'm here to tell you that whatever
