hallelujah my god my god my god bless the name of jesus bless the name of jesus amen thank god for his mighty presence amen a sanctuary on today um i heard the prayer requests for sister vernon's nephew and i just wanted to read a scripture i felt that this would be a teachable moment anytime you hear of someone having a nosebleed the prophet gave us very specific instructions on how to deal with them and he said read ezekiel 16 and verse 6 so you need to write that in your bible or somewhere and put a note in your phone anytime you hear somebody has a nosebleed you read ezekiel 16 and verse six and the instructions from the prophet is read it three times i did this uh one time my daughter had a really bad nosebleed we were about to take her to the hospital my wife was uh up at night with her and she'd come and um she got me out of bed and said you know zandy's bleeding and you know we don't know just keeps coming so uh i say well we're gonna use what the prophet told us we're gonna use this scripture and say now if she keep bleeding after this then we're going to take him to the hospital so uh i read the scripture three times and prayed the prayer of faith and and after that no more bleeding amen so i believe god's word if god gave us instruction through a prophet that's what we're going to do and even though we're not in the hospital room we're sending this scripture to the hospital room where this young man is and just believing that god's going to do what he said he would do the bible says and when i pass by thee and saw thee polluted in thine own blood i said unto thee when thou was in thy blood live yeah i said unto thee when thou was in thy blood live he said read it three times the second time and when i passed by thee and saw thee polluted in thine own blood i said unto thee when thy when thou was in thy blood live yea i said unto thee when thou was in thy blood live the third time and when i passed by thee and saw thee polluted in thine own blood i said unto thee when thou was in thy blood live yea i said unto thee when thou was in thy blood live we send that scripture to that young man right now in the name of jesus we command him to live in jesus name satan loose him and let him go we've come according to what the prophet has told us to to come and follow over this condition we plead the blood of jesus believing that he's healed by your stripes god he is healed it's in jesus name we declare it amen amen amen amen praise the lord praise the lord amen um really quick uh i um two things first friday we supposed to have uh at home tape service and i keep forgetting to remind you all that we just passed the first friday and uh i want to encourage you this week if you can to just look on the church app we had the the tape that was assigned to that for last friday but try to listen to it sometime during this week i believe it's beyond the curtain of time and we want to try to make sure we get that back on the announcement so that everybody is aware of what's going on but the first friday of every month we try to have a tape that we listen to from the prophet and uh sometimes from before kobe we were coming together at the church and we were doing it but since that uh we we've been having everybody just listen to it in their homes and and want to encourage you to do that so uh but we'll start reminding you i promise we'll start reminding you now um it just so happened on first friday of next month that's going to be easter weekend so that's going to be good friday and we will have we won't we will actually be having services we're planning services for our church right here spiritual tabernacle we're going to do a thursday night friday night saturday night sunday morning sunrise service and sunday morning service now you might say brother jack i can't make all that make whatever you can i ain't putting no pressure on you but the lord just put in my heart to do it that way and that's what we're gonna do uh we're gonna use the gifts that god has given us in this church and we're going to have our own little meeting we'll probably cancel the wednesday night service for that week but we'll have thursday night friday night saturday night sunday morning sunrise and then uh and then sunday morning regular service so i'm looking forward to that i believe it's on that same week if i'm not mistaken i believe that's our fifth tuesday um if i'm not mistaken i believe it's the same week of our fifth tuesday and i mentioned to y'all at the um the the the uh business meeting that fifth tuesday night is going to be dedicated to those that have gifts in our assembly if you have the gift of tongues the gift of interpretation uh someone would share with me how often times they get in prayer and god just begins to kind of show visions to them while they're in prayer if you got a gift please talk to me about it we want you to come on that fifth tuesday brother branham told us just sit and wait on the lord and as brother smiley was preaching a few weeks ago he hid a scripture out of acts 2 and it says they were all in one accord and they were just waiting on the lord right and as he read that it just spoke it spoke to my spirit so we got to put ourselves back in the word of god with everything that we do right so the brother branham said just wait on the lord we don't manufacture it don't make it up don't do any of that right but sit and wait on the lord and if he speak then we're going to listen to what he got to say amen but we want to just do things amen the way that the prophet laid it out for us so we're asking those that are gifted like that god has given you gift just come and just sit and wait on the lord uh and uh we're gonna do that on the fifth tuesday so that's gonna be leading us right into easter i think that's special i think that's very special so i'm looking forward to it next week brother um paula lafontaine to be here um and just so that you all know church i will uh i won't be here next sunday and i won't be here sunday after next sunday i will be uh at brother charles anderson's amen ministering there he has a minister's meeting for that weekend and he asked me to come up and just speak for his church on sunday morning so i told him sure we'd be glad to do that and then the weekend after that so brother paul i fountain to be here while i'm out but then the next week i'll be at brother paul lafontaine's there is a concert that is being done another night of worship and i've been asked to be a part of that night of worship and and then i'll also be speaking for him on sunday morning then there's a youth service on sunday night that i'll be speaking at so i'll be busy amen the next couple weeks and and i'll be here during the midweek but away on sunday so keep us in your prayers amen as we go we just we just thank the lord amen just to be able to be an encouragement uh thank god for all the help that we have in church because it's gonna keep going it's gonna keep going and i just appreciate amen what the lord has done and what he continues to do here in our midst this morning we have our precious brother ernie villanueva amen and i was thinking um brother ernie if i'm not mistaken um your name in spanish means new house right and we're looking for a a new house a new church house so uh we thank god for brother ernie and amen um certainly has been a blessing to us the enemy certainly attacked him and uh and not one thing i want to say is i appreciate uh when i was uh when i was working in corporate america um you know and um there were times where you know i had to really really be down before i would stay home from work i mean i have to be really really down i just couldn't just have a uh just a little just a little that i had to be down almost going to the hospital uh uh and i love you know it's the same way it is with the work of the lord i'm gonna have to be really really down before i you know stop working for god i'm you know i'm gonna i'm gonna do everything i can for the kingdom of god and i believe uh brother ernie has the same heart and amen and he comes this morning and we pray for him and just believe in god i told y'all we're looking for omnipotence to do amen the miraculous and uh and and i believe this this enemy that's been attacking our brother for a number of years uh he shows up every once in a while we're believing here and now he can receive his healing once and for all right once and for all praise the lord hallelujah so i want you all just to remember him in prayer and we just want him to take his liberty and come and and just preach the word of god as the lord has given it to him to give to us amen let's welcome brother ernie uh to the pulpit with this song amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me i once was lost now i'm found i'm blind i was blind but now i see how sweet the sound is [Music] like me [Music] i see your amazing grace [Music] well [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] amen i love how brother branham saw that when dwight moody when he got a revelation of grace he just ran outside and the first person he found he just started yelling at him grace grace do you know grace and he said grace who's amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved the wretch like me i feel like god has delivered me so many times he delivered me from the catholic church from the baptist church from the assembly of god from the full gospel businessmen from ptl bible school from the upc and finally he brought me the truth and uh i got baptized five times once in the catholic church against my will i was screaming the whole time then the baptist church then the assembly of god church then the upc church and finally got baptized in the message amen amen you know this this message it is a supernatural multiplication of inspiration and revelation for communication with god and many people they think well you know i'm just a you know i'm just a a human being that's come down to earth to have a spiritual experience but in reality we are supernatural beings and we've come to earth to have a human experience and our mission and our mandate is to overcome that human experience overcome our eyes our ears taste touch smell the conscience the memory the imagination our reasonings and our affections and have the holy ghost enthroned in our soul and to have that supernatural intelligence to lead and guide and direct us into all truth amen i want to compliment you on your song service and brother solomon i'd like to have you travel with me sometime and and and like to have you sing before before i preach and you know you're devil blessed to have brother jack because he can preach and he can sing i didn't know he could sing to the last time we were together down in boynton beach and after the service he began to sing and i thought look a choir of angels started started singing and so uh i thank you for your prayers it's wonderful to be here in the house of god and you're probably going to have a little bit of a different service today because you're going to have two preachers you're going to have myself and i'm going to be reading a little bit of scripture and then brother jack's going to take over read the scripture and i'll be commenting and preaching in between so there's going to be a first for me probably be a first for you also so let's let's turn in our bibles to the book of romans chapter 12 and we'll start reading at verse 1 and before we read let's speak to the lord [Music] father we're so thankful to be able to come and to know that we are in your presence and you are the high priest sitting at the right hand of majesty waiting to make good all the redemptive blessings of the resurrection lord no doubt in the congregation there are many needs each one fighting the greatest battle ever fought but lord we know that even though the battle rages the war has already been won and we thank you lord for your your leading and you're guiding and directing and to giving us that that revelation that stimulation from revelation that leaves us in a state of intoxication and supercharged energized electrified quickened stimulated activated motivated revelated to know and to do your will so we commit the service to you father and we ask you to bless all the the people in divine presence meet all the needs and we ask this with a great confidence for we ask it in your precious name of our lord jesus christ amen i'll read this first scripture brother jack i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that ye present your body a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god and i like this next little passage it says which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god amen god bless you and you can have your seats and to start i would like to turn over to leviticus in chapter 2 and brother jack if you could just start reading in leviticus 2. in verse 1 and when any will offer a meat offering unto the lord his offering shall be a fine flower and he shall pour oil upon it and put frankincense thereon and he shall bring it to aaron's sons the priests and he shall take thereof there out his handful of flower thereof and of the oil thereof with all the frequencies thereof and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar to be an offer made by fire of a sweet savior unto the lord and the remnant of the meat offering shall be aarons and his sons it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the lord made by fire amen i'd like to just comment on that the the elements that go into this meat offering are first of all you've got to have the fine flour and brother branham talked about a a device they had back in those days it was called a burr and he mentioned it 28 times and this burr was something that they would take and they would grind the corn or the meal and every piece came out exactly the same size and so this is a type and brother branham said i am a typologist and any man who truly knows the bible will be a typologist and so we know that this bible it blends together all the way from genesis the seed chapter revelation is the harvest chapter and so the first element had to be that fine flower and then there had to be oil put on there and and and then there was frankincense and frankincense was the most costly and the most precious and the sweetest fragrance that there was in that time so you can continue brother jack and if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baked in the oven it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingle with oil or unleavened wafers anointed with oil and if thy oblation be a meat offering baked in a pan it shall be a fine flour unleavened mingle with oil thou shall part it in pieces and pour ore thereon it is a meat offering and if thy oblation be a meat offering baked in the frying pan it shall be made of fine flour with oil and thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these things unto the lord and when it is presented unto the priest he shall bring it unto the altar amen now there's there's three elements that i want to bring to your attention one of them is the this meat offering could be bacon in the oven or it could be bacon in the pan or it could be bacon in the frying pan three different ways for this to be to be baked and brother jack if you could just pick that up at verse 11. the lord no meat offering which ye shall bring unto the lord shall be made with leaven for ye shall burn no leaven nor any honey in any offering of the lord made by fire as for the oblation of the first fruits ye shall offer them unto the lord but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savor and every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou seize them with salt neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy god to be lacking from thy meat offering with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt now these are very specific ingredients we talked about the fine flour and the oil and the frankincense now we're instructed don't put any leaven in there and don't put any honey in there because when you heat honey it has a tendency to sour ferment and sour and the last element was the salt because the salt this was a preservative and you see these are wonderful types that that are laid out that will come to light further on in the service now if we go to first kings chapter 16 and verse 23 through 26. in the 30th and first year of assa king of judah began omri to reign over israel 12 years 12 years six years reigned he in terza and he bought the hill samaria of shimmer for two talents of silver and built on the hill and called the name of the city which he built after the name of shimmer owner of the hill samaria but omri wrought evil in the eyes of the lord and did worse than all that were before him for he walked in all the way of jeroboam think about that this man the bible says he did worse than all that were before him and whenever you see that word all it means all because it's the word so this was a bad man yes sir praise god okay continue for he walked in all the ways all the way of jeroboam the son of nabat and in his sin wherewith he made israel to sin to provoke the lord god of israel to anger with their vanities amen and now we'll we'll read at verse 28 brother jack so amri slept with his fathers and was buried in samaria and ahab his son reigned in his stand and in the 30th and eighth year of assa king of judah began ahab the son of omri to reign over israel and ahab the son of armory reigned over israel and samaria 22 years and ahab the son of omri did evil in the sight of the lord above all that were before him so his evil bypass even his father's evil so it doesn't get better it's getting worse and worse continue brother jack and it came to pass as if he had as if it had been a life a light thing for him to walk in the sins of jeroboam the son of nabat that he took to wife jezebel a pagan a heathen come on brother the daughter of ethbaugh king of zidonians and went and served baal and worshiped him and he reared up an altar for belle in the house of baal which he had built in samaria and ahab made a grove and ahab did more to provoke the lord god of israel to anger than all the kings of israel that were before him so these are this is supposed to be the king of israel leading god's people and he winds up marrying jezebel and jezebel the more i read about jezebel and the history of jezebel she was a wicked woman and served baal and cause all of israel to fall into that worship of baal so in other words his israel for the most part they became a worshiper of a pagan god now god is not going to let this stand for long so in chapter 17 we'll start reading at verse 1 brother jack and elijah the tishbite who was of the inhabitants of gilead said unto ahab as the lord god of israel liveth before whom i stand there shall not be dew nor rain these years but according to my word now you can imagine ahab he's probably looking down and maybe jezebel with them saying who is this fool how in the world did this fool ever even get into the palace to get into my presence and and to have the nerve to say that it's not going to rain until he calls for they probably didn't pay it not one lick of attention laughed ridiculed the fool in verse two the word of the lord came unto him saying get the hands and turn thee eastward and hide thyself by the brook cherith that is before jordan and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the brook and i have commanded the ravens to feed thee them now you've got to be a supernatural being you know a message believer is a supernatural being with a divine purpose in your life and for you to believe that god had ravens come and they had bread and flesh in the morning bread and flesh in the evening it was room service brother branham said that god wanted three and a half years of constant fellowship with his prophet and he took him to the brook cherith which brother branham said was the driest place in the land but yet that brook it just flowed for that whole three and a half year period start at verse verse seven brother jack and it came to pass after a while that the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land and the word of the lord came unto him saying arise get thee to zarephath which belongeth to zydon and dwell there behold i have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee now think about that this widow woman had no idea of her destiny she had no idea that she was walking into a supernatural future but yet god had ordained for her to be there and so we continue that brother jack so he arose and went to zarephath and when he came to the gate of the city behold the widow woman was there gathering of sticks the same woman that he saw in the vision he's walking down there maybe he come to the picket fence and he looked over there and there's that woman and she's out there and she's picking up sticks and he called to her and said fetch me i pray thee a little water in a vessel that i may drink and as she was going to fetch it i think about that the first part of the message she had no problem with it even though even though they are in the midst of a famine there's no water water is the most precious commodity that there is and yet when this stranger comes walking up and says fetch me a drink so she's ready to go and get the drink continue brother jack [Applause] and as she was going to fetch it he called to her and said bring me i pray the immorsa bread in thine hand that stiffened her up that stopped her right in her tracks continue your brother jack and she said as the lord thy god liveth i have not a cake but a handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil and a cruise and behold i am gathering two sticks that i may go in and i just wanna she's gathering two sticks not three sticks or four sticks she's gathering two sticks that i may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die she's in desperation she knows this is the last meal that she's got for her and her little son continue brother and elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou has said but make me thereof a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make for thee and for thy son for for thus saith the lord god of israel the barrel of meals shall not waste neither shall the crews of oil fail until the day that the lord sendeth reign upon the earth and she went and did according to the saying of elijah and she and he and her house did eat many days and the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the cruise of oil fail according to the word of the lord which he spake by elijah now brother branham love to speak about elijah and about this widow woman and her conditions and you won't find this all in one chapter or one passage but brother branham talked about the widow woman she said she was the poorest of the poor she had to be a virtuous woman or god would not have sent his prophet to her he says she was weary unable to sleep all night she was tossed about because of this great tragedy big tears dripping from her eyes for many weeks she'd had only one meal every three or four days her husband had been lost in the battle for the lord he trusted god and gave his life for the cause of israel now listen to this detail you know if if a submarine's under the water and the commander wants to know what's going on he had a a periscope and that would go up and it could tell him any land any other ships but god in this day he has given us a prophet scope and god could take that prophet scope and he could turn him back to genesis he could take him all the way through revelation he could come down and show us fine details here's one of the fine details her ragged nightgown was just about gone her sleeves were all ragged and her arms sticking out of them she lived decent and honorable and met all of god's requirements but still the lord remained silent her shoulders were stooped as she sat in her rocking chair shedding big tears and looking at her starving baby her cheekbones sticking out her arms frail and she sat ringing her bony hands her bones were dwindling away as the flesh goes from them this this was not just a man thinking or trying to describe what he thought might have been going on this was precision revelation that god gave to the prophet and he gave it to us he said she knew that only a handful of meal stood between her and death and then he says later on she wasn't going to eat of the cake she was going to make she was going to feed her little boy and put him in her arms and die then about the little boy he said the little boy was three or four years old he was unable to sleep over 20 minutes at a time because of his hunger he had on a ragged night shirt he had sinking cheeks his eyes were turning yellow and he was holding his stomach as he asked his mother if she was ready to cook the little cake now you'll be able to find all these things verbatim just as i've read them and again you'll have to search because it's in one message and then another message and then he says of the conditions in the land because of the drought and the famine the whole nation was starving and in a terrible condition the people in the city of zarepath were starving to death screaming for water it was a reflection of sin and immorality as the woman looked down the street she heard the people cursing and carrying on so now we read in leviticus that in this this this meal offering there had to be fine flour and and the oil and the woman she is on on a little bit further in the bible she's out there and she's got a little bit of meal and a little bit of oil and she's out gathering two sticks and she's gonna put the meal and the oil on the two sticks and gonna cook it and she thought she was going to die she was like a skeleton walking around but jehovah god sent elijah to him and elijah said thus saith the lord because you were willing because you were willing to sacrifice and give everything you had your meals never gonna run out your oil's never gonna run out and she and he and her house did eat and the oil and the meal never ran out now if we can turn over to luke chapter four now those of you that are that are familiar with luke chapter four we know at the at at the beginning it's uh it's jesus and he's going into the wilderness to be to be tempted and for 40 days and 40 nights he has no food and no water and he did this as a man and in the desert it is hot in the daytime and cold in the evening time and the devil was there trying to trip him up at every step and then we see in in verse 12 and jesus answering the devil said unto him if it is said thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god and when the devil had ended all the temptations he departed from him for a season didn't leave him permanently but he departed for a season and brother jack can you pick up the reading there in verse 14. and jesus returned in the power of the spirit into galilee and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all there's that word all again he taught in the synagogues went from synagogue to synagogue and all that hurt him they glorified him all of them that hurt him continue brother jack and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up in other words local boy comes home local boys made good we've heard about him sometimes you hear about a sports star comes from a local community yeah that's he comes from my hometown maybe a footballer baseball basketball player or a politician or a comedian or or or actor yeah yeah he's from my hometown so now jesus comes to his hometown where he'd been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and he stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah now jesus didn't ask for him to give him the book of isaiah it was predestinated that that minister hand jesus the book of isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he have sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord think about that he read that scripture and he sat down continued brother jack and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them is all there's that word all again the eyes of all of them they're looking they're fastened on him waiting to find out what's next he just read it and he sat down and the eyes of all of them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears that was radical for a man to stand up and read isaiah and said this day this scripture is fulfilled right now in your ears okay and all bear him witness and wandered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth and they said is not this joseph's son the answer is no it was not joseph's son that was god's son it was joseph's stepson but it wasn't joseph's son but they thought yes who does he think he is this i mean he grew up here we know him this is joseph's son and now he's saying that he's fulfilling this prophecy in isaiah continue brother jack and he said unto them ye will surely say unto me this proverb physician heal thyself whatsoever we have heard done in capernaum do also here in thy country we've heard all the miracles you've done we've heard about the blind eyes the deaf ears the leper we've heard all about that so do a miracle we want to see a miracle too don't hold back and he said verily i say unto you no prophet is accepted in his own country think about that no prophet is accepted in his own country and you wonder why there's not more message believers in america like there is in africa with ten thousand fifteen thousand they have conventions have twenty twenty five thousand you won't see that in america continue brother jack and he said verily i say unto you no prophet is except in his own country but i tell you of a truth many widows were in israel in the days of elijah many widows were there when the heaven was was shut up three years and six months when great famine was throughout all the land but unto none of them was elijah's sent save unto serepta of a city of sidon until a woman that was a widow and many lepers were in israel at the time of elisha the prophet and none of them was cleansed saving naaman the syrian now buckle your seat belt for the next couple of verses here and all they in the synagogue when they heard these things were filled with wrath wrath anger who is who is this god who dares to stand up in our temple and read this book and say it's me you have just had this prophecy fulfilled in your ears and they had all that wrath continued brother jack and rose up and thrust him out of the city and led him unto the brow of the hill where on this where in the city their city was built that they might cast him down headline deadlong they were not just going to push him over they wanted to send them down headlong there's no there's no anger like perverted religious anger friends i have seen that take place i have seen the manifestation of devils come out of religious people like i've never seen come out of just plain worldly people last verse brother jack but he passing through the midst of them went his way amen so so now jesus is beginning his ministry and let's turn over now to matthew chapter 27. remember all these types that we're talking about in the beginning in leviticus they're about to become manifest in matthew 27 verse 1. when the morning was come all the chief priests all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against jesus to put him to death all this is the sanhedrin council the supreme court they are going to get this man who is making uh what they think is a blasphemy in their town and their city and they are that they're getting together to commune how we're going to get rid of this guy when they had bound him they led him away and delivered him to pontius pilate the governor okay now in verse uh verse 11 he stands before the governor and then they present the the premise of barabbas and they give the people the opportunity do you want jesus or do you want barabbas and in unison they all screamed out give us barabbas he said what shall i do with jesus they said crucify him in verse 27 actually verse 26 brother jack sorry then released he barabbas unto them and when he had scourged jesus he delivered him to be crucified then the soldiers of the governor took jesus into the common hall and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers now listen listen to that they gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers so it wasn't just a couple of soldiers that were going to torture jesus these roman soldiers they were masters of torture they loved to do it they were saddest say this whatever way you want to say it and they took glee in doing it and they took jesus and they began to beat him and spit upon him and kick him and punch him and mock him and put a rag around his head and walked around and just sucker punched him took turns hitting them you imagine you're there and and you've already been scourged you've already got 39 lashes and now you've got this whole band of soldiers and they're beaten on you okay continue brother jack and they stripped him and put on him a scarlet robe and when they had planted a crown of thorns they put it upon his head and a reed in his right hand and they bowed the knee before him and mocked him saying hell king of the jews and they spit upon him and took the reed and smote him on the head and after that after they had mocked him they took the robe off from him and put his own raiment on him and led him away to crucify him and as they came out they found a man of cyrene simon by name him they compelled to bear his cross now when these roman soldiers crucifixion was the most horrible method of execution in the roman empire and these soldiers it was a common task for them to crucify murderers robbers all kind of of criminals and and so when somebody was going to be crucified as they were being led up to the place where the cross was no doubt they were screaming and swearing and pleading and begging for their life and how brother branham said a demon possessed a man sometimes they have four or five times the power of a natural man and so these roman soldiers they were used to all kind of scenes as they were going to crucify and they always outnumbered the one that was going to be crucified maybe they had a couple of guys hold down the hand a couple of guys hold down the feet then in verse 45 brother jack 30 35 i'm sorry and they crucified him and parted his garments casting lots that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet they parted my garments among them and upon my vesture did they cast locks and sitting down they watched him there and set up over his head his uh set up over his head his accusation written this is jesus the king of the jews now no doubt he was a spectacle no doubt all the jewish leaders that were responsible for this plot to get him killed they were all there and a great big crowd of people that had heard all about jesus and his ministry and the miracle worker and so his crucifixion caused a lot of people to come and gather and no doubt some were just you know cursing and all kind you can just imagine this this mob scene we've seen some mob scenes in the last summer time that we've gone through so you can imagine what this mob scene was like continued brother jack then were there two thieves crucified with him one on the right hand and another on the left now some people think there was a good thief and a bad thief they were both thieves and they were both casting insults and cursing at jesus but the thief on the right something happened to him i believe he was one of the first ones to experience the third pull something happened to him and he said lord remember me when you come into your kingdom and jesus said this day you will be with me in paradise continue brother jack and they that passed by reviled him wagging their heads and saying thou that destroys the temple and builders it in three days save thyself if thou be the son of god come down from the cross likewise also the chief priests mocking him with the scribes and elders said he saved others himself he cannot save if he be the king of israel let him now come down from the cross and we will believe him imagine this cynicism and sarcasm that is spewing from these chief priests and the scribes and the pharisees and all of them go ahead brother jack he trusted in god let him deliver him now if he will have him for he said i am the son of god the thieves also which were crucified with him cast the same in his teeth now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour it was early for the sixth hour to come and there be darkness on the land yeah and about the ninth hour jesus christ with a loud voice saying eli eli lama sabachthani that is to say my god my god why hast thou forsaken me continue brother jack some of them that stood there when they heard that and this man uh said this man called for elijah and straightway one of them ran and took a sponge and filled it with vinegar and put it on a on a reed uh and gave him to drink the rest said let be let us see where the elijah would come to save him jesus when he had cried again with the loud voice yielded up the ghosts he yielded up the ghost if he had not yielded up the ghost he could have been on that cross indefinitely he yielded up his life and behold the veil of the temple was written twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks rim and the gra and the graves were open and many bodies of the saints which slept the rose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many now you'll never have any denominational bible teacher or seminarian give you an accurate description and a revelation of what happened here they came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the city and appeared unto many right like brother branham said abraham and sarah they said lord would it be okay if we took kind of a whistle-stop tour around jerusalem and jesus yeah we're going to be here for a while and so they went and then they saw they were going to be recognized and they disappeared so they could appear and disappear right now going back to leviticus the fine flour and the oil and the frankincense no leaven no honey and salt so the widow woman she picked up a portion of that but then jesus came he was the bread of life that came down from heaven anointed with the oil of the holy ghost no leaven no honey he was not a honey christian he was a real man and he had salt there was a preservative he said he that endureth until the end the same shall be saved and when jesus was on the earth he carried many burdens and many burdens he carried inside maybe like the oven experience but then when the pressure started coming then it turned into a a pan and people could see the pressure and they could see the persecution coming but then on the cross it turned into a frying pan right the whole world could look at him and they could see what he was going through and in the greatest trial in the greatest suffering the most precious fragrance that frankincense was released upon the world the grace jesus knew that the cross that was the crowning portion of his ministry while the world thought he was an abject failure capital punishment at the cross was his greatest crowning achievement and now i'm going to sit down for a minute where you folks are sitting down because now i want to talk about you and me because right here this this flesh this is our meal and this meal needs to be anointed with oil with the holy ghost amen and then the leavens gotta go and no honey excuse me just a moment it's not so we're not not to be a honey christian all right that's right and like the woman had those two sticks finally we have to get on the cross and lay down like jesus did and wait for the nails to come and your trial it may be a oven experience maybe you're the you'll be the only one that knows about it or maybe just you and your family and the pastor knows about well then sometimes that trial goes to be a pen experience and more people know about it and maybe something happens in your family maybe has nothing to do with you but it brings shame on your family and everybody knows about it and people start to gossip and they talk gossip is a dainty morsel eaten with great relish brother branham said when you begin to gossip just mark it down the holy ghost has just left you he said he can't stand that kind of a spirit he said now he's not gone far away he said how do you get him to come back just become a lamb again [Music] or maybe your trial it becomes a frying pan trial maybe you backslid or something horrible happens in your family and the whole church and everybody knows and they're talking and they're looking and they're thinking about what's happened to you but like jesus when he went through his greatest trial on the cross waited for the nails to come and when they lifted him up and all the people came about wagging their finger at him and mocking him oh you think you're from god you think you've got god inside of you and they just laugh and they ridicule and they mark and the sarcasm and the skepticism comes and you wonder lord how can i how can i stand this how can i handle this how can i ever come back from this and you know many people they are in that state right now they are in a backslidden condition and many of those people they would like to come back but pride holds them back and they say what what are people going to think they know what i've done they know what's happened i i just can't stand it to go and think that they have to sit in the church and face all those people knowing what they're thinking you know what we've got to be like the father of the prodigal son waiting for somebody to come back looking for them to come back and when they come back run run to meet them run to welcome them let them know how thankful you are that they're home that they're back that they're back in the arms of god brother jack if you read first thessalonians chapter 4 and verse 13. remember when jesus was on the cross when he gave up the ghost then the bodies of the saints which slept arose and came out of the graves and appeared unto many brothers jack would you read that but i would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead and christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words now friends that the types are perfect from leviticus the meal the oil the frankincense no honey no leaven and salt then the winter woman comes and she picks up she's got the meal she's got the oil she's got the two sticks then jesus comes he is the bread of life that come down from heaven anointed with the holy ghost no honey no leaven and salt to preserve him and on the cross in his greatest trial in that frying pan experience the frankincense is released now we are the the life of god we are god we are messiahs walking in this human body and when the bride brother branham said fully recognizes who she is then the rapture will take place so the only thing holding the rapture back now is for the rest of the bride to fully recognize who she is and get on the cross and become that living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is our reasonable service god bless your saints let's stand amen which is our reasonable service and you say well brother you don't know what i've been through you don't know the trials that i'm going through check your trial against the apostle paul five times he got 39 lashes 195 lashes three times beaten with rods once they stoned him left them for dead he'd brushed himself off picked himself up and went to the next meeting and then later on he said this light affliction worketh for us a far greater rewarding glory let's bow our heads brother jack maybe you can come and be prepared to sing do we sing these are the days of elijah okay let's let's bow our heads friends i want to ask you today we are in a very late hour this is the terminal generation and you are on the home stretch and this is the time to obey the word like we have never obeyed it before to become those living sacrifices to pick up the cross and carry it no matter what the cost no matter what people say about you no matter what people think about you i want to just ask your friends if you'd like to just say lord here i am today i'm presenting myself a fresh and anew as your living sacrifice i want to be holy i want to be acceptable unto you because after what you have done this is my reasonable service god bless you god bless you hands all over the building let's pray father you being omnipotent omniscience omnipresent you know the condition of every heart and i pray lord that right now that you would take the healing bomb and that you would spread of the past across their life and no matter where they've been no matter what they've done they had a desire they raised their hand they had a desire to say lord i'm coming afresh and anew take me mold me shape me let me become a living sacrifice thank you lord for these hands that were raised in the lies and i pray that you would continue the work that you have started knowing lord that we're all we're all waiting for that great day when the rapture will take place thank you lord for the insight and the revelation that you have given to us and how the mysteries are all become known in this day thank you for that in jesus name let's sing that song these are the days of elijah thank you for your patience and your prayers brother jack thank you it was brother jack's wisdom last night he said maybe i should read the scripture and you could save your voice so god bless your brother these are the days of elijah preparing the way of the lord these are servant moses righteousness being restored oh these are the days of great trial famine and darkness and sword oh we are the voice in the desert crying prepare ye the way of the lord come up behold he comes riding on a cloud shining like something

hey salvation comes somebody give them praise in the house glory hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah thank you jesus my god well i don't know if i actually got the title to the sermon but what i can tell you is that it was a continuation [Music] [Applause] from what the lord spoke to us on last week and and i feel like he brothers brother ernie just kept emphasizing the word oh oh oh and as they start walking through the scripture i think all recognize that it was god speaking to us i mean only god could do things like this this is what make church real right this is what makes it sincere when you can come into the house of god and know that you've heard directly from god no way brother ernie comes all the way from the state of washington other side of the united states and starts walking right through the sermon last week i say only god can do something like that that was all right even using word for word [Music] the enemy was fighting him in order to stop him from bringing forth that and uh and one thing i do want to say uh uh i felt that the holy spirit just uh emphasized this through the sermon and just talked about how we go through different trials and some of our trials are just in the oven don't nobody know about it but us and maybe a few people that's about it and then sometimes it it's a pan experience a few other people know about what you've gone through you know and and uh and maybe it's just shared amongst them just inside the panhandle but then they become a frying pan and when you hear the frying pan it's like everybody knows like your stuff all over social media right and you just ain't nothing you can do it and all you can do is bear the reproach of what you've done but what i can tell you is that god got grace and i'm gonna tell you his grace is big grace great grace grace that is greater than all our sins and if you would just receive the word of the lord god will cleanse you from whatever it is that you've done wrong there's nothing you can do to separate you from the love of god he keeps coming after us over and over again and i just heard the word of the lord this morning i pray that you heard the same thing no matter what you've done uh if there's anybody looking at you funny tell the pastor about i want to talk to him praise the lord we don't need the prodigal son brothers we need the prodigal sons father and mother hallelujah somebody man we're praying that god will send all of his children home no matter what you gotta come home with just come on back home [Music] come on back home hallelujah because home is where you belong god is good god is good [Music] you just make things right and the way you make things right is just simply repent once you repent god don't hold it over your head and i'm going to tell you when god drops into the sea for forgetfulness don't worry about what other folk gonna say don't worry about what other folk gonna say amen they can they can go fishing all they want to but you ain't got to wear the label the label that you wear is unforgiving because you were forsaken [Music] i'm accepted you were condemned and i'm alive and well your spirit lives within me because you died and rose again it's all about you and jesus come on say it say say i'm forgiven because you were forsaken i'm accepted you were condemned i'm alive and well your spirit lives within me because you dine and rolls again anybody know anything about this amazing love how can it be [Music] that you my king would die for me [Music] amazing love i know it's true it's my joy to honor you hallelujah in all i do i honor you in all i do in all i do i'm gonna honor you amazing love say amazing love how can it be that you my king would die for me i know it's true [Music] it's my joy to honor you lord and all i do i want to honor you god and all i do i want to honor you hallelujah god welcomes his children home [Music] god welcomes his children home father we heard your word thank you for your servant just enduring his
