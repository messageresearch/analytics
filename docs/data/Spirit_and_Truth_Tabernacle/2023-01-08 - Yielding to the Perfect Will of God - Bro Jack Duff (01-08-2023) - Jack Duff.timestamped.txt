[10:54] hear my prayer O Lord and let my cry
[10:57] come unto thee
[10:59] hard not thy face from me in the day
[11:01] when I am I'm in trouble incline thy ear
[11:05] unto me in the day when I call answer me
[11:07] speedily for my days are consumed like
[11:10] smoke and my bones are burned as a as an
[11:13] as an earth my heart is smitten whether
[11:17] and withereth like the grass so that I
[11:21] forget to eat my bread verse 11. my days
[11:25] are like a shadow
[11:26] that didn't CL that declined and I am
[11:29] withered like grass but thou O Lord
[11:32] shall endure forever and thy remembers
[11:34] unto all generations thou shall arise
[11:37] and have mercy upon Zion for the time to
[11:41] favor her yea the set time has come
[11:44] for thy servant taketh pleasure in her
[11:47] stones in favor the dust thereof so the
[11:50] Heathen shall fear the name of the Lord

[11:55] when the Lord shall build up Zion he
[11:57] shall appear in his glory he will regard

[12:06] written for the generation to come and
[12:09] the people which shall be created shall
[12:10] praise the Lord

[12:14] of his Sanctuary from the heaven that
[12:17] the Lord behold the Earth and I like

[50:44] her daughter actually attends school

[50:48] have church in the school
[50:50] and uh and mama say I grew up in the
[50:54] church so I'm gonna go visit that church
[50:56] in the school and it's good to have you
[50:58] and they've been here this morning the
[51:01] Lord reached the bless you
[51:03] amen the Lord is good
[51:06] amen and he's doing great things uh in
[51:09] our midst amen amen appreciate the
[51:13] specials this morning I appreciate the
[51:16] worship song service
[51:19] I'm very grateful for the presence of
[51:22] the Lord I won't hold you longer
[51:26] ask that you get your Bibles and we'll
[51:28] read a scripture uh this morning and so
[51:31] good to see brother Robles amen sister
[51:34] Robles in the house of the Lord on the
[51:36] day and
[51:37] amen
[51:39] um he was down for a little bit but the
[51:42] Devil Couldn't keep him down
[51:44] amen and uh we certainly certainly thank
[51:47] God for touching him uh and y'all
[51:49] Brother Joseph made it back on on
[51:52] Wednesday night and uh
[51:58] you look better on the front road and in
[52:00] that hospital bed Brother Joseph amen
[52:03] but we thank God for bringing you
[52:05] through uh amen God God is God is good
[52:12] amen he told me before uh before he went
[52:16] on the uh the surgery and everything he
[52:19] said the Lord just well I'll I'll call
[52:22] it a vision but something he says uh we
[52:25] were at our new church
[52:27] that's the that's the other good part
[52:29] about it we were at our new church and
[52:31] he says uh brother Jack you called for
[52:34] the preacher to come out and you call me
[52:36] out brother Jack I said well brother and
[52:38] you ain't leaving here until that's
[52:41] manifested
[52:43] so there's two parts to that a new
[52:45] church and brother Joe got to give us a
[52:47] sermon at some point in time so
[52:52] so we uh we just we just we just believe
[52:55] in God and you know I was just um uh
[52:58] thinking someone turn to Romans 12 while
[53:00] while I'm talking here uh but I was just
[53:03] thinking this morning I said you know it
[53:05] God is a God that opens Red Seas
[53:10] God is a God that does the supernatural
[53:14] and um uh the one thing that I'm sure is
[53:18] that we don't have to uh
[53:20] struggle with the Enemy trying to get a
[53:24] church that's when God opens a door
[53:29] then God opens the door
[53:32] and when God closes a door then God
[53:36] closes a door
[53:38] but the God we serve when he's ready to
[53:40] move he doesn't makes it real easy it
[53:42] makes it really and everybody know that
[53:44] it's him uh so what I what I've come to
[53:47] understand that there is a purpose for
[53:49] our being here
[53:51] and if it's to pick up one soul
[53:56] if it's just to pick up one soul on our
[53:58] journey amen then we've done what God
[54:01] has asked us to do
[54:04] so I don't think it's by accident on
[54:06] since Yvonne heard that from her
[54:08] daughter and then decide to come God
[54:09] know what he's doing so amen we thank
[54:12] God for all things amen amen Romans 12
[54:16] is is where I want to uh draw our
[54:19] attention to on today
[54:22] um the uh scripture says I beseech you
[54:26] therefore brethren
[54:29] by the mercies of God
[54:32] that ye present your bodies
[54:36] a Living Sacrifice
[54:38] holy acceptable unto God
[54:42] and I love the way Paul puts this which
[54:44] is your
[54:46] it's the least you can do
[54:49] your reasonable service
[54:52] and verse 2 says and be not conformed to
[54:55] this world but be transformed by the
[54:59] renewing of your mind that ye may prove
[55:03] what is that good and acceptable
[55:07] and perfect will of God Amen the Lord is
[55:12] a blessing to the reading of his word
[55:13] let's pray father we thank you for the
[55:15] ability to read the scripture in a very
[55:17] familiar scripture we've read this
[55:18] morning but God May the Holy Spirit make
[55:21] the word of God live in US father we
[55:25] don't want to come and just go through
[55:26] motions this morning but father we want
[55:28] to hear from you and we want you God to
[55:31] have your way uh in this portion of the
[55:34] service thank you for the anointing that

[55:45] each and every heart those present those
[55:47] that are online speak to each one God
[55:49] and may you challenge us with your word
[55:51] today in Jesus name we pray amen amen
[55:56] God bless you you can be seated Amen in
[55:58] the presence of the Lord amen
[56:02] um
[56:04] I um
[56:06] I want to I'll give you my title here in
[56:09] a second but just just bear with me as
[56:11] we just kind of go through
[56:14] um
[56:15] just a few things a few things and I'll
[56:18] give you the title in a second uh
[56:22] early this week I guess uh a day or two
[56:25] ago I got a a text from Sister Amina Tom
[56:31] Wang and uh she had sent me this uh
[56:34] quote that I want to read and I and when
[56:37] she said I'm like this is exactly uh
[56:40] what was in my spirit and I just spelled
[56:42] it was a confirmation uh for you know
[56:44] just just just
[56:45] how I want to start the year off amen uh
[56:50] brother Spradley brought our our our new
[56:53] year sermon it did a wonderful job a man
[56:55] on last week and I the the scripture
[56:57] that he read out of uh the Book of
[56:59] Joshua is a very uh personal scripture
[57:02] you you haven't gone this way before
[57:05] all right you you you've never gone this
[57:08] path before and and since you've never
[57:11] walked this walk before you've never a
[57:14] man uh gone this path before he says the
[57:17] the best thing you can do is keep the
[57:18] word of God in sight
[57:20] amen don't don't get in front of the
[57:23] word amen don't get too far behind the
[57:26] word but keep the word of God in sight
[57:29] because the word is what gives us
[57:30] Direction and I think I believe brother
[57:32] smile is saying now you ain't been this
[57:34] way before but God has
[57:37] and since God knows the way all we got
[57:39] to do is follow
[57:41] amen just follow amen don't leave but
[57:44] follow amen so so you know I I I've been
[57:48] you know just dealing with some things
[57:49] in my own spirit and I want to bring
[57:51] something to the church and I'll give
[57:52] you my title like I said in a second but
[57:54] let me read this this quote from the
[57:57] message the contest uh this sermon the
[58:00] contest is one that brother Brandon
[58:01] preached as he was closing out one year
[58:03] and going into the next year amen and I
[58:06] thought it was just a very fitting quote
[58:07] that sister Amina sent me she said the
[58:09] quote says this the prophet says now
[58:12] beginning a new year
[58:14] it says I want to say not happy New Year
[58:19] to you I want to say this to you
[58:21] God bless you
[58:23] amen and if he does that that's all you
[58:27] have need of for the coming year and I
[58:30] trust that he will
[58:31] and he says and I'm by his grace we're
[58:34] going to try this next year he shall
[58:37] spare me spare you by his grace I hope I
[58:42] am a better Pastor amen next year than I
[58:46] have been this year praise God it says I
[58:49] hope I a better servant to Christ
[58:52] see I want to improve
[58:54] if you understand I mean that there's
[58:56] there's room for improvements
[59:00] come on somebody
[59:02] amen there's room for renovation
[59:06] bless it be the name of Lord I want to
[59:09] be a better Pastor amen I want to be a
[59:12] better servant to Christ I believe as
[59:15] Christians you want to be better
[59:16] Christians you want to be better in
[59:19] every every every area of a life better
[59:22] parents say man come on somebody better
[59:25] husbands better wives we we want to be
[59:27] better
[59:29] Hallelujah
[59:31] amen amen he says I'll try hard to to
[59:35] try to live closer more truer to bring
[59:38] the message just as he gives me I shall
[59:41] bring it to you the best that I can
[59:43] without holding with hope withhold
[59:46] nothing that he would want me to give
[59:48] you I'll do all that I know how glory to
[59:52] God and I know you feel the same way you
[59:54] feel like that we all want to work
[59:56] together now for the evening lights are
[59:58] certainly getting dim and the sun far
[1:00:02] setting amen the Earth is cooling off we
[1:00:05] know that spiritually speaking the
[1:00:07] church
[1:00:09] here it is the church is cooling off and
[1:00:13] the Revival is over we don't know what
[1:00:15] comes next but we will trust God for
[1:00:17] that whatever it is amen he says we'll
[1:00:20] trust God for it so you know I was just
[1:00:22] looking at that and that cooling off and
[1:00:24] I think it's um uh it's it's very
[1:00:26] fitting I think we are we we can all see
[1:00:28] that in our own lives amen we can see it
[1:00:31] in the world that we're living in
[1:00:33] there's a cooling off that has taken
[1:00:34] place and and I've said to myself we got
[1:00:36] to fight to stay warm
[1:00:39] Hallelujah we got a fight to stay warm
[1:00:42] we got to fight to stay on fire
[1:00:44] spiritually the devil always trying to
[1:00:47] take that fire the devil always trying
[1:00:49] to take your joy and trying to take your
[1:00:51] peace we have to fight for these things
[1:00:53] amen and I and I made this little
[1:00:56] statement to myself said lower spring
[1:00:58] blessings are great
[1:01:00] so that means the blessings that you get
[1:01:02] on your job and in your house and you
[1:01:04] know uh anything that helps us get
[1:01:06] through on this Earth those are lower
[1:01:07] spring blessings they're great I thank
[1:01:09] God for it but up a spring blessings
[1:01:12] are Eternal amen so we're asking God for
[1:01:15] upper spring blessings this year
[1:01:18] amen I believe that we're closer this
[1:01:21] year than we have ever been to the
[1:01:23] coming of the Lord
[1:01:25] and I know you have heard that
[1:01:27] um over and over in your life and
[1:01:29] sometimes because you've heard it so
[1:01:31] much it doesn't mean as much to you
[1:01:34] praise the Lord but but but but but
[1:01:36] eventually this this revelation's got to
[1:01:38] sink in we're getting closer to the
[1:01:40] coming of the Lord and and I want to ask
[1:01:42] the question are we getting closer to
[1:01:44] Jesus
[1:01:46] are we actually pulling further away
[1:01:48] from him
[1:01:49] uh our decisions taking us closer to the
[1:01:52] Lord are they actually taking us further
[1:01:53] from him
[1:01:54] amen because we're getting close did
[1:01:56] we're closer this year to the coming of
[1:01:58] the Lord than we've ever been amen and
[1:02:00] we got to get desperate for God
[1:02:02] hallelujah I sat with this in mind
[1:02:04] realizing that the coming of the Lord is
[1:02:06] so close with this in mind I need to do
[1:02:09] a spiritual checkup on my own life
[1:02:12] amen hallelujah

[1:02:18] my own life and and I'm gonna tell you I
[1:02:20] want you to also do the same do it
[1:02:22] spiritual checkup on your own life Paul
[1:02:24] said to lay aside every sin and every
[1:02:28] weight that's so easily besets us amen
[1:02:31] and I'm asking a question to the Lord
[1:02:33] what can I lay aside this year
[1:02:37] that will allow me to draw closer to you
[1:02:41] now that's my question and since I had
[1:02:44] that question I felt everybody should
[1:02:46] just stop for a moment right
[1:02:48] glory to God just stop for a moment I
[1:02:51] want us to pause just for a minute

[1:03:24] prayer amen with me glory to God and you
[1:03:29] just repeat the words after me I'm going
[1:03:31] to say the prayer but you just repeat
[1:03:32] the words and and then after after after
[1:03:34] you repeat the words some of y'all may
[1:03:37] have an answer already to it Others May
[1:03:40] get the answer throughout this sermon
[1:03:41] but whatever it is I want you to write
[1:03:43] that answer down and hold on to it glory
[1:03:45] to God here's the prayer I want you to
[1:03:47] just uh say these words after me Lord

[1:03:52] something that I can lay aside
[1:03:56] this year
[1:04:01] Lord show me something
[1:04:04] that I can lay aside
[1:04:06] this year
[1:04:09] the rest of the prayer says something
[1:04:11] that would allow you and I to draw
[1:04:12] closer
[1:04:15] I want you to think about that just take
[1:04:17] a moment even those that are online take
[1:04:19] a moment amen I want you to be involved
[1:04:21] in the moment amen Lord show me
[1:04:24] something that I can lay aside this year
[1:04:26] something that would allow you and I to
[1:04:29] draw closer
[1:04:31] put that on a sheet of paper put it in
[1:04:33] your phone put it somewhere but that's
[1:04:35] what your goal is this year amen and and
[1:04:38] I don't want you to just wait to the end
[1:04:39] of the year to get your goal start on it
[1:04:41] today start working towards that goal
[1:04:44] today we're trying to get closer to the
[1:04:46] Lord not further away from God
[1:04:49] Hallelujah in Prior years amen here at
[1:04:52] the church we would
[1:04:54] um take a word that we would just kind
[1:04:56] of use and that would be our word for uh
[1:04:59] you know things that we want to
[1:05:00] accomplish that year and a couple years
[1:05:02] ago one of those words was replication
[1:05:05] amen and and I believe God certainly
[1:05:07] honored that and and allowed us to
[1:05:10] replicate in many ways praise God and
[1:05:12] then uh one of the other words that we
[1:05:15] had in the last couple years was being
[1:05:16] intentional about some things and I was
[1:05:19] very intentional in a lot of areas you
[1:05:21] know that that I knew and and I was
[1:05:23] happy that God uh gave us that but this
[1:05:25] year I was kind of struggling I was
[1:05:27] trying to find the mind of God uh for
[1:05:30] our church and you know what is it that
[1:05:31] God would want us to to kind of focus
[1:05:33] our attention on and um and I was
[1:05:36] praying over it and just just meditating
[1:05:38] on it and I just really couldn't get any
[1:05:40] peace on it so uh a few days ago uh
[1:05:43] maybe about a week ago or so a brother
[1:05:45] beginning to preach on on this morning
[1:05:47] call that I'm on brother Stanford Christ
[1:05:49] is his name up there in in in in North
[1:05:52] Florida and he was preaching saying you
[1:05:54] know every year from my church we take a
[1:05:56] word and we we use that word to kind of
[1:05:58] be our Focus for the year I said oh wow
[1:06:01] they do the same thing we do and uh he
[1:06:03] said the word that the lord gave me this
[1:06:04] year was Perfection I said hey I like
[1:06:07] that brother you know and I began to
[1:06:09] just kind of ponder that and thank God
[1:06:10] and say okay I might have to hold on to
[1:06:13] that just for a little bit and as I was
[1:06:15] waiting then I got a little text that
[1:06:17] came through and uh brother Josue didn't
[1:06:20] realize that what he had done but he
[1:06:22] sent out a text to the brothers in our
[1:06:24] group chat and he he found himself a man
[1:06:27] at a uh at a junction
[1:06:30] come on somebody amen he says I'm here
[1:06:33] at the junction and uh and I began to
[1:06:36] think about how we talked about that a
[1:06:38] few years ago that we were we were at a
[1:06:40] junction amen when the Ministries were
[1:06:43] merged and we were at a junction glory
[1:06:45] to God and I believe we've done very
[1:06:48] well through that merging amen we were
[1:06:51] at a junction and brother brother
[1:06:52] brother Josue said you know at the
[1:06:54] junction what I recognize here is before
[1:06:57] I can enter the junction
[1:06:59] I have to yield
[1:07:02] that's right
[1:07:04] amen I said hey that's a good word right
[1:07:07] there yielding
[1:07:09] so what the Lord just kind of put in my
[1:07:11] spirit amen for this year and this is
[1:07:13] the title of the sermon yielding to the
[1:07:17] perfect will of God
[1:07:20] yielding to the perfect will of God amen
[1:07:25] hallelujah amen and and yield means to
[1:07:29] give the right away
[1:07:31] Hallelujah somebody amen and I want to
[1:07:34] encourage us as a church give God the
[1:07:37] right away in your life amen yield to uh
[1:07:41] to to what is per what is perfect will
[1:07:43] and what his perfect plan is for your
[1:07:44] life yield means to give the right away
[1:07:46] uh to others in traffic another thing
[1:07:49] that yield means cease to argue about it
[1:07:53] you mean stop arguing amen give that
[1:07:58] thing to God
[1:07:59] Hallelujah the Bible actually tells us
[1:08:01] that that uh where there is no wood the
[1:08:05] fire stops
[1:08:08] we gonna have to learn how to yield how
[1:08:10] how to take the time how to take the
[1:08:12] heat out of the fire
[1:08:14] you'll cease to argue about amen another
[1:08:18] thing yield means is the relinquish
[1:08:20] possession of so that thing that you
[1:08:23] wrote down you have to relinquish to God
[1:08:25] relinquish possession of give up
[1:08:28] something
[1:08:30] when you're yielding to his perfect will
[1:08:33] you are giving up something you're
[1:08:35] giving up your will you're giving up
[1:08:37] your way you're giving up your thoughts
[1:08:39] you're giving up your ideas you're
[1:08:41] giving up everything to follow Christ
[1:08:45] relinquished possession of or give up
[1:08:48] something
[1:08:49] amen and another thing yield is because
[1:08:52] when you when you finally give up
[1:08:54] something you just turn it all over to
[1:08:56] Jesus the other thing yield is it it it
[1:08:59] it provides interests
[1:09:01] on your investment
[1:09:04] and the greatest investment you can ever
[1:09:06] make is giving your everything to the
[1:09:09] Lord Jesus
[1:09:11] see some of y'all amen that yielding
[1:09:13] might just simply mean uh being more
[1:09:16] active in service
[1:09:19] just coming on Wednesday night
[1:09:21] amen that that might be what your yield
[1:09:23] is for this year there is something that
[1:09:25] you can do to draw closer to the Lord
[1:09:27] Jesus
[1:09:29] Hallelujah all right here I want to just
[1:09:32] kind of catch a a a a a quote out a
[1:09:35] resume of the ages
[1:09:37] and just bear with me Hallelujah I I am
[1:09:41] I'm just thanking God yielding to the
[1:09:43] perfect will of God you know there's uh
[1:09:46] uh let me let me let me let me just uh
[1:09:50] put this in here before I go to that
[1:09:51] quote uh before this ministry started I
[1:09:55] I had to come to a place where I yielded
[1:09:58] I had to give God I had to Just
[1:10:00] Surrender my all to the Lord and
[1:10:02] recently you know a brother was asking
[1:10:03] him say brother um tell me about your

[1:10:11] events happen in my life that uh showed
[1:10:16] me that God was calling me to this seven
[1:10:18] different times something happened to me
[1:10:19] I said brother take me a good while to
[1:10:21] kind of explain all seven I'm saying but

[1:12:12] says Jack you are natural
[1:12:14] I said what he said says Jack your
[1:12:18] natural says just uh it just flows out
[1:12:21] of you I said I would just so I was so
[1:12:24] nervous I didn't feel like it was
[1:12:25] flowing I didn't feel like I'm I feel
[1:12:27] like I'm a failure he says no Jack
[1:12:28] you're a natural I said well wow so I
[1:12:31] went on to to my break and I'm sitting
[1:12:33] there pondering with this man standing
[1:12:35] like this is I never I never expected
[1:12:37] that so while I'm sitting on break one
[1:12:39] of those other students two of the other
[1:12:40] students in class one guy hey man he was
[1:12:43] a a a military captain and I think in
[1:12:46] the
[1:12:47] um
[1:12:48] the Marines and he says uh he says Jack
[1:12:51] his name was Captain Carr it says Jack I
[1:12:54] said uh yes sir he says uh
[1:12:57] anybody ever tell you that you sound
[1:12:59] like a reverend
[1:13:01] I said uh
[1:13:03] I said no I'm just up here talking
[1:13:04] business don't don't you know don't
[1:13:06] don't don't you know just just no don't
[1:13:09] don't go there he said well you you know
[1:13:11] I just want to just ask anybody ever
[1:13:13] tell you you sound like that I said nah
[1:13:15] so after I tried to get him to calm down
[1:13:17] another girl piped up she said she said
[1:13:19] yeah while you was up there talking I
[1:13:21] ain't know whether to say Amen or what
[1:13:25] I say I'm here in business school
[1:13:27] talking business
[1:13:29] they say I ain't nowhere to say Amen or
[1:13:31] what I say well hey I appreciate that
[1:13:33] y'all thank y'all very much so he says
[1:13:35] Jack I say yes yes sir how can I help
[1:13:37] you he said how old are you sir I said
[1:13:40] uh I'm I'm 33. I'm 33.
[1:13:44] it says okay
[1:13:45] and it said uh Jack I said hey Mr Mr Mr
[1:13:50] Carr yes what and I'm on my break and
[1:13:54] this man is doing this to me except he
[1:13:56] said he said Jack how old was Jesus when
[1:13:59] he died
[1:14:05] I said he was 33.
[1:14:08] and at that moment I had to give up some
[1:14:10] things
[1:14:11] because I knew it was not just Mr Carr
[1:14:14] talking to me anymore
[1:14:16] I knew that actually on that day there
[1:14:18] were three Witnesses
[1:14:20] I didn't even catch that to now but that
[1:14:22] preach I mean that that former preacher
[1:14:24] that was my teacher Mr Carr and the
[1:14:26] other young lady by the name of Diane
[1:14:27] all of them made these comments at the
[1:14:29] same time about me I knew I had to yield
[1:14:33] I had to give up something and let me
[1:14:35] taste that I'm so glad I yielded it
[1:14:38] because there's a return on the
[1:14:40] investment
[1:14:43] Hallelujah and I'm telling you this
[1:14:45] morning if you were yield to the perfect
[1:14:48] will of God there will be a return on
[1:14:52] your investment
[1:14:56] Hallelujah to the Lamb of God let me
[1:14:59] read this out of the resume of the ages
[1:15:01] it says I sincerely believe that the
[1:15:03] spirit of God has been speaking to us
[1:15:05] not only teaching us the the truths of
[1:15:08] the ages but he's been Faithfully
[1:15:10] dealing with hearts that they may turn
[1:15:12] to him that is the reason for all the
[1:15:15] preaching and teaching for it it is in
[1:15:17] the preaching and teaching of the word
[1:15:19] that the sheep hear the voice of God and
[1:15:21] follow him look at this not for one
[1:15:24] moment do I bring a message to the
[1:15:27] people that they may follow me or join
[1:15:30] my church or start some fellowship and
[1:15:32] organization I have never done that and
[1:15:35] will not do that now I have no interest
[1:15:38] in those things but I do have an
[1:15:40] interest in the things of God and people
[1:15:44] and if I can accomplish just one thing
[1:15:46] I'll be Satisfied hey man it says that
[1:15:49] one thing is to see established a true
[1:15:53] spiritual relationship between God and
[1:15:56] Men where men become New Creations in
[1:15:59] Christ filled with his spirit and live
[1:16:03] according to his word since I would
[1:16:06] invite my God plead and warned all to
[1:16:11] hear his voice at this time and listen
[1:16:13] to this and yield your lives
[1:16:17] completely to him even as I trust in my
[1:16:20] heart that I have given my all to him
[1:16:23] God bless you and may his coming Rejoice
[1:16:26] your heart I want to encourage us I want
[1:16:29] to plead with the church yield to the
[1:16:32] perfect will of God he'll stop fighting
[1:16:35] with God stop arguing with God yield to
[1:16:39] God
[1:16:40] God I'm not worthy and God I'm not this
[1:16:43] God knows you he made you
[1:16:46] and he has allowed certain things to
[1:16:49] happen in your life for a reason and let
[1:16:52] me tell you he is gonna get Glory out of
[1:16:54] everything he allowed to happen to you
[1:16:56] but he wants you to just heal
[1:17:02] give up something
[1:17:04] give up your ideas give up your
[1:17:06] Ambitions give up your thoughts give it
[1:17:09] all up
[1:17:10] Hallelujah yield to the perfect will of
[1:17:13] God
[1:17:16] I was reminded amen just a few years ago
[1:17:19] how as we were just yielding to the
[1:17:22] spirit of the Lord in our church we
[1:17:24] start we start seeing gifts manifested
[1:17:26] here
[1:17:27] and the devil didn't like it and and I'm
[1:17:30] gonna tell you there was gifts coming in
[1:17:31] not just and and
[1:17:33] um tongues and interpretations but
[1:17:35] dreams were coming out of everywhere
[1:17:38] people were in a position where they
[1:17:40] could hear from God
[1:17:42] hallelujah amen but it seemed like you
[1:17:44] know um uh you know it's just that they
[1:17:47] as as things begin to change you wanted
[1:17:49] to do we start slipping and getting
[1:17:50] further away from God or are we drawing
[1:17:52] closer to the more God speaks to us and
[1:17:55] through us we ought to want to draw
[1:17:56] closer to him
[1:17:58] we want to get sin out of our life amen
[1:18:01] anything in my life that is not pleasing
[1:18:04] to you I want to get rid of that
[1:18:08] Hallelujah
[1:18:10] glory to God Amen I was just reading an
[1:18:14] article here you know and they were
[1:18:16] saying 10 sins that happened online
[1:18:19] that the church has become comfortable
[1:18:21] with and I'm gonna have to bring that
[1:18:23] because I don't have them all but you
[1:18:25] know one of them when we post you know
[1:18:27] we brag
[1:18:29] we boast when we post
[1:18:33] and boasting is not a not not a a a
[1:18:36] something that Christians supposed to do
[1:18:38] but we boast when we post
[1:18:41] right amen I mean I I I I put that quote
[1:18:45] out there for the brothers I was in you
[1:18:46] know reading in my my daily devotions
[1:18:48] and you know and if just um Brother Brad
[1:18:51] I'm talking about this brother how he
[1:18:53] they asked him if they could put his
[1:18:55] daughter's picture on some type of
[1:18:57] little box
[1:18:58] and then the brother said that's an
[1:18:59] insult to me to have you ask me to put
[1:19:02] my daughter's picture on that box you
[1:19:04] know I don't want people looking at her
[1:19:05] like that but look at everybody of their
[1:19:07] selfies today
[1:19:09] praise the Lord somebody right I mean
[1:19:12] you know and we we promote ourselves so
[1:19:14] much hey hallelujah amen a gift supposed
[1:19:18] to make room for itself
[1:19:20] hello somebody that's biblical
[1:19:23] principles we've gotten away from a lot
[1:19:25] of these things
[1:19:27] and it's just become acceptable
[1:19:29] but according to God it might not be
[1:19:31] acceptable
[1:19:33] I'm gonna tell y'all another thing that
[1:19:35] the lord lord lord shared with me amen
[1:19:37] he says sometimes when people saying
[1:19:39] Amen in church it is a mental amen
[1:19:45] it's a mental amen and what a mental
[1:19:48] amen is that I'm gonna just say that so
[1:19:49] you stop talking
[1:19:53] I'ma just give you Amen on that but some
[1:19:55] amens come from the heart when people
[1:19:58] really agree with the word of God that
[1:20:01] amen will change you that it may not
[1:20:04] change your situation
[1:20:06] that's the type of Amen had a right hand
[1:20:08] which he said that's nothing but the
[1:20:11] truth
[1:20:12] man that struck God let your amen strike
[1:20:16] God and let your amens change you this
[1:20:19] year
[1:20:22] Hallelujah
[1:20:24] here you know we got to look at some
[1:20:26] things and I'm gonna tell you one one
[1:20:28] other things that's in my heart we're
[1:20:29] going to get practical this year we're
[1:20:31] going to do a lot of practical things
[1:20:32] and I'm gonna go back and get some of
[1:20:33] that you know that I read I want to
[1:20:35] share with you because we got the we got
[1:20:36] to do checkup we drawing closer closer
[1:20:40] to the coming we're not getting further
[1:20:41] from the coming or we're getting closer
[1:20:43] to the coming of the Lord
[1:20:47] I was thinking about all the gifts and
[1:20:49] everything flowing through the church
[1:20:52] and you know with a church with all the
[1:20:54] word that we have
[1:20:55] we ought to see a living Jesus in our
[1:20:59] midst
[1:21:02] sick is not supposed to come to the
[1:21:04] church and be comfortable
[1:21:07] disease not supposed to come to the
[1:21:09] church and be comfortable
[1:21:12] you know when you go to a hospital
[1:21:13] you're expecting to do something about
[1:21:15] it I'm not here visiting
[1:21:18] I'm here with a issue and people come to
[1:21:21] church with issues
[1:21:23] and the church has got to rise up and
[1:21:26] accept responsibility somebody need to
[1:21:29] learn how to be more sensitive to God
[1:21:33] can speak to us and speak through us
[1:21:36] oh my
[1:21:38] God I was just looking at something here
[1:21:39] you know um and I won't read this uh
[1:21:42] maybe I you can pull this up but um get
[1:21:45] down to paragraph
[1:21:46] right at paragraph 22 and pull up that
[1:21:48] quote the Messiah don't pull it up on
[1:21:50] the screen but on your on your screen
[1:21:51] just pull it up brother Brandon just
[1:21:53] talking about this in this message of
[1:21:54] Messiah let's talk about how over in
[1:21:56] England there was a time that they they
[1:22:00] they said they they uh they turned the
[1:22:02] Heelers loose
[1:22:05] in the hospitals they turned the healers
[1:22:08] loose what what that meant is that they
[1:22:11] realized they couldn't do nothing with
[1:22:12] the sickness the doctors were just at
[1:22:14] their wits in but they knew God was God
[1:22:17] and they they turned their healers loose
[1:22:20] my God Amen I wonder would they be able
[1:22:24] to call you up
[1:22:27] we need the healers to come we need
[1:22:30] somebody to pray for the sick to to show
[1:22:32] up here at the hospital somebody
[1:22:34] believed God because we can't do nothing
[1:22:35] with this and they turn the healers
[1:22:38] loose
[1:22:39] oh my goodness Lord can you can you have
[1:22:42] confidence in us that we can be the
[1:22:44] healers for this day
[1:22:46] oh my
[1:22:48] God Amen here in in in this in this
[1:22:51] message uh it says um
[1:22:54] they find that there is a ray of light
[1:22:57] they had this man you know that that
[1:22:59] laid hands on the sick and they said a
[1:23:01] red light passed through the man they
[1:23:03] picked it up so they find that there was
[1:23:05] a red light when this man sincerely not
[1:23:08] knowing they would well uh knowing they
[1:23:10] were doing it put his hand upon a man
[1:23:12] and prayed an Earnest prayer they was
[1:23:14] putting the X-ray down and found out a
[1:23:17] light coming from his ham God knew what
[1:23:20] he had talked about when he said lay
[1:23:22] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[1:23:24] he knows what he was speaking of oh I
[1:23:28] want to see the church
[1:23:30] press into that place where it can come
[1:23:35] like God wants it to be
[1:23:38] I'm saying that for this year I want to
[1:23:40] see the church press I'm at I'm right
[1:23:43] above paragraph 22. I want to see the
[1:23:46] church press into that place where it
[1:23:48] can come like God wants it to be
[1:23:51] it says then when God was made flesh and
[1:23:54] became the Messiah then if we can yield
[1:23:58] ourselves to be the anointed like he was
[1:24:01] we become Messiahs little lights that's
[1:24:06] what the church is supposed to be lights
[1:24:07] little anointed ones that's God's Church
[1:24:12] his standing light is the lighter
[1:24:14] Messiah raised in Christ and his people
[1:24:16] the anointed ones caring forth his light
[1:24:18] all the church ages sometimes it almost
[1:24:21] goes completely out then it comes back
[1:24:23] again God's anointed when God's Messiah
[1:24:25] church if Messiah means the anointed
[1:24:28] ones it means king and then if the
[1:24:30] church is Anointed by the Messiah Spirit
[1:24:32] it becomes a lesser but still a messiah
[1:24:35] because it has his light reflecting his
[1:24:37] power reflecting his glory reflecting
[1:24:39] his Dominion so it is Messiah oh how it
[1:24:42] reflects him in his kingdom in his
[1:24:44] domain
[1:24:45] I like that and uh you know this is what
[1:24:49] I want us to yield yield to a spot where
[1:24:51] God could actually use this the way that
[1:24:54] he uh the way that he promised in
[1:24:56] Scripture
[1:24:57] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:24:59] they shall recover now you got to have a
[1:25:01] life to do that
[1:25:03] you got to have a life to do that you
[1:25:05] got to be following the word of God you
[1:25:07] got to be you got to be yielded
[1:25:09] a man yielding to the perfect will of
[1:25:11] God
[1:25:12] let's go back and look at this scripture
[1:25:14] Romans 12. I beseech you therefore
[1:25:17] brethren

[1:26:43] bodies of Living Sacrifice holy accept
[1:26:45] unto God which is your reasonable
[1:26:47] service
[1:26:48] and I like this and be not conformed
[1:26:51] to this world but be transformed by the
[1:26:55] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[1:26:57] uh what is good and acceptable and
[1:27:00] perfect will of God and as I was just
[1:27:01] looking at amen some of those words
[1:27:03] renewing when it says be be transformed
[1:27:06] by the renewing of your mind that means
[1:27:08] amen a renovation
[1:27:11] glory to God it's a renovation and at
[1:27:14] the beginning year we need to be
[1:27:15] renovated
[1:27:17] y'all we all watch them shows amen where
[1:27:21] people gonna try to decide whether
[1:27:22] they're gonna buy a new house or
[1:27:23] renovate amen and oftentimes when they
[1:27:26] renovate my that the renovations look
[1:27:29] better than buying a new house amen but
[1:27:31] it's the same address it's the same
[1:27:34] house it's just been changed on the
[1:27:36] inside hello somebody amen you at the
[1:27:40] same address you the same house but you
[1:27:43] need to be changed on the inside renewed
[1:27:46] renovated
[1:27:51] glory to God Amen renewing me to
[1:27:55] renovate completely change for the
[1:27:57] better
[1:27:59] see I told you we ready for some
[1:28:00] improvements amen I myself am ready for
[1:28:04] improvement I know I can be a better
[1:28:06] Pastor I know I can be a better
[1:28:09] Christian I know I can be a better
[1:28:11] father I know I can be a better husband
[1:28:13] I can be better
[1:28:16] and you can too
[1:28:19] good means upright and honorable
[1:28:24] amen so it says transformed about an
[1:28:26] anointing amount that you may prove what
[1:28:28] is that good means to be upright and
[1:28:31] honorable in everything that you do amen
[1:28:34] acceptable means to be well pleasing
[1:28:39] glory to God and I like this he says be
[1:28:42] not conformed to this world but be
[1:28:44] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:28:47] that you may prove what is that good
[1:28:49] amen which is upright and honorable and
[1:28:52] acceptable which means well pleasing and
[1:28:54] it says and then uh imperfect will of
[1:28:56] God perfect means full grown mature
[1:29:03] and you you can't tell me spiritually we
[1:29:05] can't we're not in a place where we can
[1:29:07] mature
[1:29:09] see this is why we gotta yield
[1:29:12] to the perfect will of God
[1:29:14] and let me tell you something each each
[1:29:16] person in here got God's got a perfect
[1:29:18] will for each life in here but you have
[1:29:21] to yield to what God has for you
[1:29:25] praise the Lord
[1:29:27] what he got for you might not be for
[1:29:28] your neighbor
[1:29:30] but you got to yield to what God has for
[1:29:32] you yield to the perfect will
[1:29:35] of God I want to pick up a quote out of
[1:29:38] the power of transformation
[1:29:40] amen you know even on on
[1:29:43] Friday night we were listening to the
[1:29:46] tape and you know you got to be you got
[1:29:47] to be able to hear God's voice you know
[1:29:49] when you when you're sitting there and
[1:29:51] uh you know we're listening and brother
[1:29:52] branham's you know preaching there on uh
[1:29:55] the seated discrepancy and then towards
[1:29:57] the end they start uh going through that
[1:29:59] prayer line
[1:30:00] and as as he's going through the prayer
[1:30:02] line and the lady walks up he says oh
[1:30:04] you got a request I know what you
[1:30:06] request is ma'am okay I see it and now
[1:30:08] you gotta understand when brother
[1:30:09] branham's in that prayer line in order
[1:30:11] for him to see what the spirit wants to
[1:30:14] show him he has to learn how to
[1:30:16] oh
[1:30:18] he has a yield he has to get quiet
[1:30:20] before God he he can't have a lot of
[1:30:22] distractions y'all gonna have to get
[1:30:24] these distractions out of your life
[1:30:26] amen get get quiet before God so God can
[1:30:28] speak to you come on somebody we this is
[1:30:32] what yielding is all about what Lord
[1:30:34] what can I give up this year that will
[1:30:37] Draw Me Closer to You
[1:30:40] right but he's he's daring it's just
[1:30:42] yielded and you can see the return on
[1:30:44] the investment after the prophet yields
[1:30:47] he said I see what you hear for sister
[1:30:49] you're here for you know you want a baby
[1:30:51] and that's a wonderful request and as
[1:30:53] brother Brandon starts saying I said hey
[1:30:55] something just struck me and I say oh I
[1:30:58] just began to think about uh brother
[1:30:59] Stephen and sister Rachel I say Lord
[1:31:01] give them that that that request they're
[1:31:03] not there to go through the prayer line
[1:31:05] but Lord I believe you're the same God
[1:31:07] and you hear their request
[1:31:09] come on somebody
[1:31:11] man then he started talking about a way
[1:31:13] with child
[1:31:14] glory to God and how somebody was in
[1:31:16] line for a way with child I start
[1:31:18] thinking about brother Nehemiah glory to
[1:31:21] God then I stop thinking about my own
[1:31:22] daughter then I stopped thinking about
[1:31:24] some of your kids I say Lord give us all
[1:31:26] our kids if they got their requests
[1:31:28] granted What About Us
[1:31:32] what about us he's the same God
[1:31:37] Hallelujah we want to be sensitive to
[1:31:40] the voice of God
[1:31:41] we want to be sensitive to the spirit of
[1:31:43] God what you read in your Bible that's
[1:31:46] what your life's supposed to look like
[1:31:49] you're gonna have to yield some of your
[1:31:51] time
[1:31:53] so you can get back in the word of God
[1:31:56] Hallelujah you got that you got to find
[1:31:58] time in your schedule
[1:32:00] to get God back in the picture
[1:32:03] at the beginning of the year yield yield
[1:32:10] the power of transformation The Prophet
[1:32:12] says this to be Transformers to be
[1:32:14] changed and made something different
[1:32:17] so it's like a tadpole
[1:32:18] it's transformed from a tadpole to a
[1:32:22] frog see once he looked like a catfish
[1:32:25] he swims around he's got a head and it's
[1:32:27] telling everything looks uh just like a
[1:32:30] catfish then after a while he begins to
[1:32:32] lose loses the tail he's transformed
[1:32:35] from one specie to another
[1:32:38] transform that but it's the same animal
[1:32:40] now but it's just transformed we need to
[1:32:43] go through this process of
[1:32:44] transformation
[1:32:45] amen he says I think that's what Paul
[1:32:48] must have had in mind when it's that be
[1:32:50] ye transformed by the renewing let's see
[1:32:54] let me get that right be not conformed
[1:32:56] you know what conform this be not
[1:32:57] conformed to this world but be
[1:32:59] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:33:03] the prophet says renewing of your mind
[1:33:05] the things that you once thought upon
[1:33:08] praise God to be precious the things you
[1:33:12] thought were precious amen laid that
[1:33:15] aside and be transformed to something
[1:33:18] else
[1:33:20] hallelujah what you was one time to what
[1:33:24] you are now see amen Lord God we know
[1:33:28] where God brought us from and someone
[1:33:31] start to head back in the direction that
[1:33:32] God brought us from
[1:33:35] it's the truth anyhow amen be renewed
[1:33:38] Amen in your mind
[1:33:40] yield to God give up something amen that
[1:33:44] would cause you to draw closer to Christ
[1:33:47] all right look at this he says oh that's
[1:33:50] what we all want to know how to do it
[1:33:53] where we are here we love him he saved
[1:33:56] us now we want to know what to do and
[1:33:59] we're trying to take a little step this
[1:34:01] morning to raise up just a little bit
[1:34:03] higher sometimes we have to hit things
[1:34:05] you just hold off a few to to till we
[1:34:08] see what it comes out to be now I like
[1:34:11] they says we got to know how to do it
[1:34:13] and now there was a quote that I that I
[1:34:16] have here amen and I was saving it for
[1:34:19] later but I think this would be a
[1:34:20] perfect place to put it this is in the
[1:34:22] in the sermon how can I overcome we need
[1:34:24] to know how to do it how do I heal God
[1:34:27] how do I do that brother Branham brings
[1:34:30] us something here Amen in the message
[1:34:32] how can I overcome
[1:34:34] Hallelujah
[1:34:36] amen and and every mother every Father
[1:34:39] Here ought to be able to identify with
[1:34:40] this one right here he says just like
[1:34:44] putting a little baby's arm
[1:34:47] in a sleeve hold you see you want to
[1:34:49] know how to yield he says it's just like
[1:34:52] putting a baby's arm in a sleeve hole
[1:34:54] you see he just up down over everything
[1:34:59] else and if you ever try to give like a

[1:39:52] closer to God
[1:39:53] amen here's some examples of of perfect
[1:39:56] and permissive will
[1:39:57] Cain knew
[1:40:00] the perfect will of God when it came to
[1:40:03] the offering you know how he knew it
[1:40:05] because God told him exactly what to
[1:40:07] offer
[1:40:08] but Cain rejected that and and actually
[1:40:12] I said like this Cain refused to yield
[1:40:15] to what God told him to offer
[1:40:17] Hallelujah it was a perfect will for
[1:40:21] Sarah to have the promised son but God
[1:40:24] permitted Hagar
[1:40:27] but the perfect will of Sarah
[1:40:29] always the perfect will with Sarah look
[1:40:31] and we we can't we can't we can't be
[1:40:33] like Sarah were we suggesting things to
[1:40:35] God
[1:40:38] pause for a second who are you
[1:40:41] to suggest to God what he should do
[1:40:46] did you make him or did he make you all
[1:40:49] right
[1:40:50] hello somebody right we don't suggest to
[1:40:53] God we yield
[1:40:58] Israel rejected Grace and cried out for
[1:41:02] law
[1:41:02] amen and that that when they cried out
[1:41:05] for law that was not God's perfect will
[1:41:07] for them to have he wanted them to have
[1:41:08] Grace
[1:41:10] but they cried for law another thing
[1:41:12] Israel did they wanted a king
[1:41:15] to rule over them rather than following
[1:41:17] God's perfect will of speaking through a
[1:41:19] prophet and letting that Prophet lead
[1:41:21] them they rejected God's plans and God's
[1:41:24] ways for for for for for their uh uh
[1:41:27] just just for the leadership of their
[1:41:29] Nation amen another thing that that that
[1:41:31] you know just in my studying our birth
[1:41:34] you all born a man and uh born in this
[1:41:37] earth your very birth came through the
[1:41:40] permissive will of God
[1:41:43] hello somebody your birth was permitted
[1:41:47] by God Amen but it was not the perfect
[1:41:50] will of God for us to come through that
[1:41:52] sexual act
[1:41:54] hallelujah amen we could have come
[1:41:56] through a spoken word amen but your
[1:41:59] birth was a permissive wheel and you
[1:42:02] know what with that verse when we're in
[1:42:04] the permissive will of God we see all
[1:42:06] the negative things that come along with
[1:42:07] the permissive will look at all the
[1:42:10] sickness look at all the disease look at
[1:42:12] all the death
[1:42:15] our kids can't go to school anymore
[1:42:18] you all heard it this week a
[1:42:20] six-year-old
[1:42:22] go to go to school with a gun how did a
[1:42:25] six-year-old get a get a hold of a gun
[1:42:27] that's right
[1:42:29] a teacher
[1:42:31] six years old life has they don't
[1:42:34] they'll never even see life
[1:42:37] what a shame
[1:42:40] we need to yield to the perfect will of
[1:42:42] God
[1:42:43] here you know our birth should have been
[1:42:45] by the spoken word that's how Jesus came
[1:42:48] but God permitted our births to come
[1:42:50] through the sexual act another another
[1:42:51] uh example Jonah was completely out of
[1:42:55] the perfect will of God as he was
[1:42:58] traveling to tarshish rather than going
[1:43:00] to Nineveh I got this scripture here in
[1:43:02] Jonah 1 12 and and I'm gonna read this
[1:43:04] for you here really quick Jonah even
[1:43:06] though he was out of perfect will of God
[1:43:08] God God allowed that permissible will to
[1:43:10] work to his perfect will and I'm gonna
[1:43:12] tell you sometimes we've been in the
[1:43:13] permissive will and God will turn that
[1:43:15] person that permissible to work to his
[1:43:17] perfect will but let me tell you stop if
[1:43:19] you stop fighting with God stop
[1:43:21] struggling with God it'll be much easier
[1:43:23] on you
[1:43:27] Jonah did his own thing
[1:43:30] John knew he was in trouble not only he
[1:43:32] knew he was trouble everybody on the
[1:43:33] boat knew they was in trouble and they
[1:43:35] could not figure out now this this this
[1:43:37] don't make no sense I believe those men
[1:43:39] that studied the seeds
[1:43:41] they knew that uh a storm probably
[1:43:44] shouldn't even been out there and this
[1:43:45] is why they start responding where they
[1:43:47] was like wait a minute wait a minute
[1:43:47] wait a minute this is not the time of
[1:43:49] year for this why is this happening
[1:43:51] somebody on this something on this boat
[1:43:53] that they should not have done everybody
[1:43:55] start confessing
[1:43:58] Journal finally jumped up and said you
[1:44:00] know I know
[1:44:01] you know you know why a lot of stuff
[1:44:03] going wrong
[1:44:04] in your life
[1:44:06] because you out of the wheel
[1:44:11] you added a perfect will and when you
[1:44:13] get yourself aligned with the perfect
[1:44:14] will of God you'll see other things line
[1:44:16] up in your life
[1:44:17] hello somebody
[1:44:20] get back in line with the perfect will
[1:44:22] of God
[1:44:25] Hallelujah here Jonah when they came to
[1:44:27] Jonah they asked him here in Jonah 1 12.
[1:44:29] they say now what did you do what's
[1:44:31] going on why is the storm say say look
[1:44:33] you know I did this I did that I can I
[1:44:35] confessed that I did it it said why did
[1:44:38] you do that why are you running from God
[1:44:40] why are you doing that
[1:44:43] so tell you what you'll tell y'all what
[1:44:45] y'all do
[1:44:46] take me up
[1:44:48] cast me forth into the sea
[1:44:52] so shall the sea be calm unto you if I
[1:44:55] know that for my sake this great Tempest
[1:44:56] is upon you
[1:44:58] now here Jonathan thought I said well I
[1:45:00] still ain't gonna get God's will
[1:45:01] accomplished because I'm a drown in this
[1:45:03] sea
[1:45:05] well
[1:45:06] then how God think
[1:45:08] God prepared
[1:45:10] a fish
[1:45:13] if the fish was already created the fish
[1:45:16] was growing for years to be big enough
[1:45:19] to swallow Jonah not only not only
[1:45:22] growing on all those years I don't know
[1:45:23] where that fish was but somehow the fish
[1:45:26] found this way
[1:45:27] in the ocean
[1:45:29] to get the right where Jonah was to be
[1:45:32] cast out of a boat and be there to
[1:45:34] swallow him
[1:45:36] predestination God allows for his his
[1:45:39] that that permissive will to always work
[1:45:42] out to his perfect will and God caused a
[1:45:44] fish since he couldn't go by boats he
[1:45:47] calls a fish to take Jonah right to
[1:45:50] Nineveh
[1:45:51] and you know the other beautiful
[1:45:52] partners that they worship the fish God
[1:45:54] in Nineveh so when Jonah comes walking
[1:45:58] out Amen on the tongue of a fish they
[1:46:01] knew they had to hear God
[1:46:04] but if Jonah would have just submitted
[1:46:07] himself
[1:46:08] to the perfect will of God he would have
[1:46:10] never found himself in the belly of a
[1:46:13] well
[1:46:17] are you in Wells belly today
[1:46:20] because of your disobedience
[1:46:24] are you in Wales belly is your business
[1:46:27] in Wales belly
[1:46:29] is your family in Wales belly
[1:46:34] I'ma tell you something about God if you
[1:46:36] are in Wells belly he'll bring you out
[1:46:39] but you gotta surrender
[1:46:41] to the perfect will of God yield
[1:46:45] to the perfect will of God
[1:46:47] is another one that I got Balaam Balaam
[1:46:50] Balaam knew the perfect will of God
[1:46:52] and that perfect will of God got it out
[1:46:54] I told him do not go with balak I don't
[1:46:58] care how much money they offer you I
[1:46:59] don't care if nothing but don't do not
[1:47:01] go with balac you stay right here and he
[1:47:04] he you know they send back one group say
[1:47:07] no Balaam said he not come say he so
[1:47:08] balakcept sends somebody a little bit
[1:47:10] more important than y'all go down there
[1:47:11] off a little bit more
[1:47:13] go pray he go pray God said no don't go
[1:47:15] down there and they say he says uh
[1:47:18] uh they start off from all these things
[1:47:19] say well you know okay I I I'll go and
[1:47:22] God God told you now you go I'm gonna
[1:47:23] permit you to go but you better only say
[1:47:25] what I tell you to say
[1:47:28] you get down there and on his way the
[1:47:30] reason he found out he was in the
[1:47:31] permissible of God what happened he the
[1:47:33] donkey that he's riding
[1:47:35] sees the angel of the Lord sometime
[1:47:37] because we we so far out of the will of
[1:47:39] God we can't see God we can't hear God
[1:47:42] we can't feel God
[1:47:45] but a donkey had to tell him
[1:47:49] and can you imagine a man
[1:47:52] he got so mad he hit the donkey crazy
[1:47:55] donkey out you know I'm trying to go
[1:47:58] here and then the donkey just start
[1:48:00] talking
[1:48:03] it's just
[1:48:05] for me
[1:48:08] I don't have any more um pets at the
[1:48:10] house amen but if I had a pet
[1:48:14] that started
[1:48:15] talking to me
[1:48:20] that would that would say something that
[1:48:22] I'm I'm something right here I need to
[1:48:25] turn around and go back to where I I I
[1:48:26] left but for him he hear the donkey
[1:48:29] talking still want to pursue it
[1:48:32] oh my God God got a donkey talking to
[1:48:34] y'all this morning yield to the perfect
[1:48:37] will of God
[1:48:41] Balaam was out of out of the perfect
[1:48:42] will of God God turned it to uh to work
[1:48:46] so he was in the permissible but God
[1:48:47] worked it to the perfect will hearing
[1:48:49] this message the Sheep the seed shall
[1:48:51] not be able to shut brother random makes
[1:48:53] a statement
[1:48:55] it says now you see from as I said last
[1:48:58] night
[1:48:59] any move from that original plan of God
[1:49:02] throws the whole thing out of cater any
[1:49:05] move from the original plan of God
[1:49:06] throws a whole thing out of cater we
[1:49:09] can't move from that original word
[1:49:13] since we talked on it last last evening
[1:49:15] or the evening before last rather on
[1:49:17] Balaam he he got God's answer he got
[1:49:20] God's answer right I mean straight and
[1:49:22] clear don't go
[1:49:25] but he has a permissive will
[1:49:27] and you can work in that if you wish to
[1:49:31] and God will make it honor him
[1:49:33] but it's still but still it's not God's
[1:49:36] perfect will and that's what we should
[1:49:38] strive for his perfect will not his
[1:49:40] permissive will the kingdom of God which
[1:49:43] he is in the Earth today
[1:49:45] can never be set up justly this is
[1:49:48] important to me the kingdom of God which
[1:49:51] he is in the Earth today that Kingdom
[1:49:53] can never be set up justly
[1:49:55] on the permissive wheel
[1:49:58] God can't accomplish the work that he
[1:50:00] wants to do in our life if we're going
[1:50:01] to continue to operate permissive will
[1:50:05] some important time we got to yield
[1:50:08] we got to stop doing what we're doing
[1:50:09] and we got to yield to God's perfect
[1:50:11] will
[1:50:12] for our lives
[1:50:13] it's got to come back to its perfect
[1:50:15] will
[1:50:16] I was um
[1:50:18] looking at something here
[1:50:21] that just kind of blessed me and I I
[1:50:23] I'll I'll share this maybe I'll just
[1:50:25] share a couple more things and then
[1:50:26] we'll come to a close uh one time
[1:50:29] brother Brandon went overseas to
[1:50:31] meetings
[1:50:33] and he says you know the uh if you ever
[1:50:35] want to get yourself all tangled up just
[1:50:37] get amongst a bunch of preachers
[1:50:40] that's how you get tangled up and um and
[1:50:42] as he was over there
[1:50:44] it says the Lord had told him before he
[1:50:46] went and says be careful there's a trap
[1:50:47] set for you and
[1:50:49] and Africa there's a trap set for you
[1:50:51] there's a trap set and he's like oh my
[1:50:53] so he was expecting the trap to be some
[1:50:54] type of witch doctor or something like
[1:50:56] that he didn't realize the Trap was
[1:50:58] going to come from Ministry
[1:51:00] he didn't realize that so uh as he was
[1:51:03] over there
[1:51:04] he says uh Brothers the Lord just told
[1:51:07] me we're not supposed to take this
[1:51:08] little the way that y'all got the
[1:51:09] meeting set up the Lord said we're not
[1:51:11] supposed to do that he said we're
[1:51:12] supposed to go back this way and do this
[1:51:13] do that and they said no no no no no no
[1:51:15] no God told us to do it this way we got
[1:51:17] it all set up they said no God telling
[1:51:18] me not to do that we need to go back
[1:51:20] over here God showed me in a vision not
[1:51:22] to do that brothers and so it's it's
[1:51:24] they say so one of the brothers yeah
[1:51:26] hyped up it says uh
[1:51:28] um
[1:51:29] you're the only one God speak to
[1:51:33] he looked at the brother they say they
[1:51:35] thought the same thing one day
[1:51:37] when he tried Moses like that he says
[1:51:40] I'm telling y'all in the name of the
[1:51:41] Lord we are going in the wrong direction
[1:51:43] and we're going to pay for it if we do
[1:51:45] this it says he took some leaves down
[1:51:47] off the tree and start throwing them at
[1:51:48] the brother's feet thus saith the Lord
[1:51:50] we honor the will of God thus said the
[1:51:52] Lord we out of the will of God
[1:51:54] and as they they looked at us and and
[1:51:56] and only a son and one of the other
[1:51:57] brothers were standing there with him
[1:51:58] say brother Brandon we'll go back to the
[1:52:00] States if you want to go back he's like
[1:52:01] no we'll go but I'm just telling our
[1:52:03] brothers we're out of the will of God
[1:52:04] things you know so they went down to
[1:52:06] meeting all these peoples gathered and
[1:52:08] out of nowhere storm just came
[1:52:11] shut the meeting down nobody could get
[1:52:13] out of their car and go to the meeting
[1:52:15] shut the meat now say we're going to get
[1:52:16] back together next night next night they
[1:52:18] went say out of nowhere uh it start
[1:52:20] freezing
[1:52:22] and the people can get out because it's
[1:52:23] too cold they won't even prepare for God
[1:52:25] was showing them they were out of the
[1:52:26] perfect will of God let me tell you
[1:52:28] something sometimes storms come up in
[1:52:30] your life
[1:52:33] to show you that you're out of the will
[1:52:35] of God you're out of place
[1:52:36] and all God wants you to do is get back
[1:52:38] in line so that he can bless you
[1:52:41] oh help me somebody
[1:52:45] brother Brandon say you know he says
[1:52:47] Brothers we're out of the will of God I
[1:52:48] know God showed me this and then he said
[1:52:50] he went and he's praying throughout
[1:52:51] through the nine and him and the son
[1:52:53] praying and says God said you know I'm
[1:52:54] Gonna Let You Go at these brothers
[1:52:56] he says but I'm letting you know right
[1:52:57] now this is not my perfect will he said
[1:53:00] y'all not gonna be blessed he says but
[1:53:02] uh he says I'm Gonna Let You Go with him
[1:53:04] he says but you're gonna pay for this
[1:53:06] decision
[1:53:08] and just through eating and drinking
[1:53:11] some kind of way he got an amoeba into
[1:53:13] his into into a system and end up off
[1:53:16] the field for eight months
[1:53:18] because he didn't follow the perfect
[1:53:20] will of God
[1:53:21] don't you know you suffer
[1:53:24] you suffer when you don't follow the
[1:53:27] perfect will of God
[1:53:28] I want to encourage this church at the
[1:53:30] beginning of the year heal
[1:53:33] give up stop pause give God the right
[1:53:36] away
[1:53:38] follow his perfect will
[1:53:41] I was thinking on this
[1:53:44] and there's a a statement here and I
[1:53:46] want to read this about brother Billy
[1:53:48] Billy Paul
[1:53:50] we all uh those you know many of us know
[1:53:53] the message pretty well we know that
[1:53:54] Brother Joseph Branham has a tremendous
[1:53:57] he has a gift you know a prophetic
[1:53:59] anointing on his life and and don't let
[1:54:01] nobody tell you that they don't have he
[1:54:03] does have it it just has to be placed
[1:54:04] right in the scripture and the way I
[1:54:06] place it the five full ministry said
[1:54:08] that God gave unto the church pastors
[1:54:11] prophets evangelists teachers preachers
[1:54:13] I mean he gave that uh Apostles he gave
[1:54:15] that to the church so I see brother
[1:54:17] Joseph's ministry right in that amen not
[1:54:20] not somebody to take brother Brown's
[1:54:22] place
[1:54:24] no preacher do that because it's not
[1:54:26] scripture but it's certainly within the
[1:54:29] fivefold ministry amen but um brother
[1:54:32] Brandon made a statement about Billy
[1:54:34] Paul
[1:54:35] that just blessed me it's hearing the
[1:54:37] message Jairus and Divine Healing
[1:54:40] he says there's good evening friends
[1:54:43] it's indeed a pleasure to be here
[1:54:44] tonight and a privilege
[1:54:46] I thank you for your thoughts
[1:54:49] of the boy my son he's just a lad
[1:54:52] he's been going through now for a little
[1:54:54] while the managers in Canada Mr Baxter
[1:54:57] and so I hardly know uh how I would it'd
[1:55:01] be hard for me to get along without him
[1:55:02] right now so it's kind of in my right
[1:55:04] hand man he's but being just a kid
[1:55:07] and you all and you you always respect
[1:55:10] for him I certainly appreciate that
[1:55:12] he says and I hope someday
[1:55:15] that God makes a minister out of him
[1:55:18] and if he would only give a complete
[1:55:21] yield to God
[1:55:24] of course he's just a kid
[1:55:26] he's an adolescent age but Billy if he
[1:55:29] will yield to God look at this if he
[1:55:33] will yield to God his ministry will
[1:55:38] exceed mine
[1:55:40] brother Branham said this about his son
[1:55:42] that if if Billy would have yielded to
[1:55:45] God his ministry would exceeded his
[1:55:47] fathers
[1:55:51] if he would yield to God his ministry
[1:55:54] would exceed mine so bad till so far it
[1:55:57] won't be even
[1:55:59] it won't even be in the picture
[1:56:02] Billy is going to be a very spiritual
[1:56:05] boy
[1:56:06] and the spirit of the Lord is near him
[1:56:09] for instance
[1:56:11] we'll be riding down the road on a place
[1:56:13] we've never seen before
[1:56:15] he's talking to me the other day he said
[1:56:17] Daddy he said I see we're going to make
[1:56:19] a turn after a while and there's a red
[1:56:22] barn and there'll be a cow standing over
[1:56:24] here and some chicken standing around
[1:56:26] beside it'll it'll be just there don't
[1:56:29] just don't worry it'll be just there he
[1:56:32] see and it's so near him the same thing
[1:56:34] if he just yield to it
[1:56:37] and then we'll go a little further and
[1:56:39] I'll say now watch Paul if you see it's
[1:56:42] the same I'm telling you uh I said now
[1:56:44] we're going to we're going to be a man
[1:56:46] uh you be ready to catch your breaks
[1:56:49] cause there's a man gonna come around
[1:56:51] the corner and the next city and the
[1:56:53] man's gonna be dressed in a certain way
[1:56:54] like that and there and there he will be
[1:56:57] just like and he will say well now daddy
[1:56:59] that I see that too he said but I don't
[1:57:02] know what to do
[1:57:04] I just want y'all to catch this
[1:57:07] Billy in the car with his daddy and I
[1:57:10] mean his daddy you know being a prophet
[1:57:12] got all kind of visions that he see
[1:57:13] we're gonna see this we're gonna see
[1:57:15] that we're gonna see this
[1:57:16] and the fellowship in this car
[1:57:21] y'all not catching it yet
[1:57:24] the fellowship in this car
[1:57:28] is the Dr is the passenger can say well
[1:57:31] I see this I see that I see this I see
[1:57:33] that and it's gonna be just that way oh
[1:57:35] that's what you see well I see
[1:57:39] and everything that they saw God would
[1:57:42] can you imagine the level of Fellowship
[1:57:45] in that car see if I was riding with the
[1:57:48] prophet it'd be like oh my oh
[1:57:51] but I I don't know and I just wondered
[1:57:54] myself you know was was it because
[1:57:55] brother Billy was around it so much that
[1:57:57] God elevated him to be able to see
[1:58:01] because if that's the case
[1:58:04] we've been in this so much
[1:58:07] we've been around this so much for years
[1:58:11] after years that we should be elevated
[1:58:13] to a spot now where we can see some
[1:58:16] things
[1:58:18] but in order for you to see something
[1:58:23] we got to yield
[1:58:33] I don't know what to do I said just
[1:58:35] follow what the Lord says
[1:58:37] see
[1:58:38] gifts and columns are without repentance
[1:58:40] that's right and of course be thousands
[1:58:42] of things happen we've never I never
[1:58:44] even mentioned it
[1:58:46] he just tells me certain things and I
[1:58:48] just go ahead that's all right I'm
[1:58:50] thankful and just don't tell it to the
[1:58:52] people you don't have to unless it's
[1:58:54] going to do somebody some good or help
[1:58:56] somebody if it isn't going to help
[1:58:58] anyone it doesn't do any good anyhow
[1:59:01] does it just maybe for our own our own
[1:59:03] benefit and there's many things he lets
[1:59:06] happen that he never tells me nothing
[1:59:08] about it just lets me go right on in and
[1:59:12] I don't know nothing about it until it's
[1:59:14] done happen he just tells me what he
[1:59:17] wants to
[1:59:19] and what he doesn't want to he doesn't
[1:59:21] have to
[1:59:24] that's the way God does
[1:59:27] brother random saying brother Billy Paul
[1:59:30] could have had a really really powerful
[1:59:32] Ministry and we all know he went through
[1:59:34] some things in his life especially this
[1:59:35] marriage and all of that he uh he ended
[1:59:38] up in a situation where he married a
[1:59:40] girl that he wants he ran out married
[1:59:42] and brother Randall said no you want you
[1:59:43] were supposed to do that they had to
[1:59:44] knowledge so that causes divorce and
[1:59:47] that that that that caused him to be
[1:59:48] taken out of the ministry but if he
[1:59:50] would have yield it to God where would
[1:59:54] his ministry be
[1:59:56] now we all know also by scripture that
[1:59:59] his ministry couldn't have been no
[2:00:00] greater than his dad but as far as the
[2:00:02] Supernatural still happening the way it
[2:00:04] was happening we would still see it we
[2:00:06] still have fresh testimonies
[2:00:08] if a man in his teenage years oh y'all
[2:00:11] gotta get that
[2:00:13] if a man in his teenage years
[2:00:16] would have yielded to God
[2:00:19] this generation would have been far more
[2:00:21] blessed can I tell you something I'm not
[2:00:23] just going to just put that on brother
[2:00:24] Billy Paul I'm putting that in your lap
[2:00:27] today
[2:00:28] if you would just learn how to yield to
[2:00:30] God
[2:00:31] how much further would our church be on
[2:00:33] the road
[2:00:35] yielding to the perfect will of God
[2:00:40] each one of you wrote something down on
[2:00:41] your list today and and I'm trusting
[2:00:43] that you'll be sincere with God
[2:00:46] that you will uh take that before him in
[2:00:49] prayer Lord what what can I what can I
[2:00:52] give up
[2:00:53] that will help me draw closer to you
[2:00:54] what can I give up this year I'm not
[2:00:57] talking about next year this year what
[2:00:59] can I give up that will Draw Me Closer
[2:01:00] to You
[2:01:02] here this last quote and does God ever
[2:01:04] change his mind about his word the
[2:01:06] prophet says it is best to have God's
[2:01:08] will
[2:01:10] that's what he taught us
[2:01:12] thy will be done
[2:01:14] thy kingdom come thine will be done
[2:01:17] we must submit ourselves to his will and
[2:01:20] his word don't question it believe it
[2:01:23] don't try to find a way around it just
[2:01:26] take it the way it is so many wants to
[2:01:28] go around get some other way and when
[2:01:30] you do you find yourself going on and
[2:01:32] you find God blessing you but you're
[2:01:34] working in his permissive will see
[2:01:37] that's that's another that's another
[2:01:38] tricky thing right there you can
[2:01:40] actually get blessings in the permissive
[2:01:42] will
[2:01:43] and still not being the perfect will
[2:01:45] amen right we don't want blessings in
[2:01:49] the permissive will we want the perfect
[2:01:51] will blessings look at what he says he
[2:01:53] says you find yourself going on you find
[2:01:55] God blessing you but you're working in
[2:01:57] his permissive will and not in this
[2:01:59] perfect Divine will he permits it
[2:02:02] as I've said but he will not he will not
[2:02:04] let it be his perfect will so you can't
[2:02:06] make
[2:02:08] you can't make God's permissive will
[2:02:10] become his perfect will
[2:02:13] he'll bless you for it but you're going
[2:02:15] to pay for some things too along the way
[2:02:18] I want to look at this he says he
[2:02:20] permits it
[2:02:21] my but you're working in his permissible
[2:02:23] and not in this perfect perfect Divine
[2:02:25] will he permits it as I said but he will
[2:02:27] not let it be his perfect will but he'll
[2:02:29] make it work to honor and bless his
[2:02:31] perfect will and childbearing by sex is
[2:02:33] one of that
[2:02:35] that's uh our birth is a part of God's
[2:02:38] permissive will he's blessed it but mind
[2:02:41] if we were to come to perfect will
[2:02:43] how much more could he have done for us
[2:02:45] and even in this as we're approaching
[2:02:47] this next year uh this year amen if we
[2:02:49] would just yield this perfect will how
[2:02:51] much more
[2:02:52] can he do for us
[2:02:54] how much more we see the gifts of God
[2:02:56] manifested in our midst how much more
[2:02:58] will God give dreams how much more will
[2:03:01] God speak to his people how much more
[2:03:03] will God heal the sick how much more
[2:03:05] will God raise the debt how much more
[2:03:07] will God do in our midst if all of us
[2:03:09] would just learn to yield
[2:03:16] husbands got to give
[2:03:18] wives got to yield children have to heal
[2:03:22] a pastor has the yield
[2:03:25] we all have to learn how to yield yield
[2:03:27] and to give God the right of way
[2:03:30] Lord I'm not holding on to this I don't
[2:03:32] need this this thing this thing this
[2:03:33] ain't gonna take me into no Rapture let
[2:03:35] me let this thing go and notice what
[2:03:37] notice what Paul said lay aside every
[2:03:39] sin and every week that's so easy to
[2:03:40] beset you that means you got to give it
[2:03:42] up not God come take it from you but you

[2:12:54] what a tremendous message
[2:12:56] there was so much that was said
[2:12:59] you know my mom was born everywhere
[2:13:01] there's a there's a song for everything
[2:13:03] he actually preached about it you know
[2:13:07] us brother Jack and sister Erica came by
[2:13:10] the house one day and I was telling him
[2:13:12] about something that I saw it was the
[2:13:15] week that um brother Jack and brother
[2:13:17] Willie were going
[2:13:19] with their wives to Arizona and brother
[2:13:21] Willie was preaching on Wednesday night
[2:13:25] and while he was preaching sister Birds
[2:13:27] was sitting where she is and she was
[2:13:28] just nodding her head
[2:13:31] I sat back and I thought I was like my
[2:13:34] sister Birds is
[2:13:36] is watching her son-in-law approach
[2:13:40] I got to think of somewhere down the
[2:13:42] line she yield it to the Lord and when
[2:13:46] she yielded to the Lord her songs went
[2:13:49] around the world not only that she
[2:13:52] raised two two preachers
[2:13:54] she raised her preachers she raised her
[2:13:57] daughter that married a preacher she has
[2:14:00] a grandson that approaches she has a
[2:14:03] granddaughter that married a preacher
[2:14:05] there's musicians throughout her family
[2:14:08] they're singers throughout her family
[2:14:13] the decisions that we make affects
[2:14:17] Generations there's blessings there are
[2:14:20] cursings if only we just you
[2:14:23] there's so much God can do with us
[2:14:25] there's so much God can do at our own
[2:14:27] spring to impact this world for the
[2:14:29] kingdom of God's sake
[2:14:32] so we ought to you
[2:14:34] [Music]
[2:14:35] you can't stop playing for a second
[2:14:38] there's a little song I want to sing
[2:14:41] you know sometimes you have to you have
[2:14:43] to yield
[2:14:45] you you never heard this song before
[2:14:48] but I feel like I I have to yell
[2:14:51] you know when I left South Carolina me
[2:14:53] and my pastor brother Luke I left
[2:14:56] we left I left on bad terms
[2:14:59] we we really went at it over some things
[2:15:03] but there was a song that he sung that I
[2:15:05] hadn't I hadn't sung in about nine years
[2:15:08] it's a song that he wrote
