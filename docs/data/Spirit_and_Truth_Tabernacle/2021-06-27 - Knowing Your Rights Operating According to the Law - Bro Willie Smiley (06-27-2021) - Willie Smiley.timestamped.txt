[47:15] we were young people coming up and
[47:19] it's one of the songs that carried us
[47:24] there's times where i remember
[47:27] my life in particular um
[47:31] i was getting away from god getting away
[47:33] from you know loving him
[47:35] and serving him time that me and brother
[47:38] smiley got into that accident
[47:40] and our car was turned over i i was
[47:43] coming to a point in my life where i
[47:44] just didn't want to go to church anymore
[47:46] it's just just you know that was it for
[47:50] me
[47:51] but sometimes what god
[47:54] does he allows certain things to happen
[47:57] to just get your attention to to help
[48:00] you to realize that if
[48:02] you're not underneath my covering you're
[48:04] not underneath my protection anything
[48:06] can happen to you and after that
[48:08] accident i i
[48:09] i began to run back to jesus
[48:12] and just give him everything i had as we
[48:15] were
[48:16] listening to uh brother solomon sing
[48:19] that song and
[48:20] you know sometimes the devil be fighting
[48:21] things like that because
[48:23] he knows somebody is going free in the
[48:25] midst of
[48:27] the words of the song
[48:32] and you know that those words i'm tired
[48:35] of pain
[48:37] and i don't like fear right i mean
[48:40] and when you get sick and tired of being
[48:41] sick and tired then you're going to do
[48:43] something about it
[48:44] see that fear is that i might miss the
[48:46] rapture and i might miss going home with
[48:49] the saints and i and i don't want to
[48:51] live life in fear right i want to make
[48:53] sure that my
[48:54] my my my heart is right and my mind is

[59:57] on joel chapter 2
[1:00:00] we might want to read um
[1:00:04] make sure i got it here the 25th 25th
[1:00:07] verse
[1:00:08] it says that the locust has eaten
[1:00:13] the canker worm and the cali
[1:00:17] a great army which i sent among

[1:00:26] gracious father we just come this
[1:00:28] morning to
[1:00:29] yield our vessel uh to you this morning
[1:00:33] we
[1:00:34] trusting that you'd help us to say
[1:00:36] something that's
[1:00:37] edifying this
[1:00:46] jesus christ wonderful name amen amen
[1:00:54] amen
[1:00:55] [Music]
[1:00:57] i've gotten used to that cordless mic
[1:01:00] uh it used to be a time where i used to
[1:01:03] like these things here but
[1:01:05] i kind of uh i get a little wild when i
[1:01:08] get one of these in my hand i start
[1:01:10] feeling more like an evangelist but uh
[1:01:13] we'll see how it works out this morning
[1:01:16] i want to use as a little topic uh this
[1:01:19] morning knowing your rights
[1:01:22] and there's a context operating
[1:01:25] according to the law
[1:01:26] all right i was i was listening to a
[1:01:29] tape this week that i hadn't heard in a
[1:01:31] good long time
[1:01:33] i thank god for the leadership of the
[1:01:35] holy spirit
[1:01:36] and as i was listening boy that thing
[1:01:38] started just
[1:01:40] really uh working on me i was like man
[1:01:42] that's really
[1:01:43] real powerful thought uh i'm i'm a firm
[1:01:46] believer
[1:01:47] in the knowledge and understanding of
[1:01:49] the scripture
[1:01:50] right uh i often say this now i hope
[1:01:53] y'all don't never get tired of my
[1:01:54] sayings
[1:01:55] but you know i often say i enjoy
[1:01:59] the worship and all of those things but
[1:02:01] for me
[1:02:04] what we understand about the word of god
[1:02:06] is going to take us farther than
[1:02:09] don't get don't get tired don't get dead
[1:02:11] because anything dead
[1:02:13] needs to be buried right right but
[1:02:16] uh our victory comes by the revelation
[1:02:20] of the word of god
[1:02:22] is that right amen it you we we
[1:02:25] i shout because i realize by
[1:02:28] understanding
[1:02:29] amen who i am
[1:02:32] right right that's the reason why i
[1:02:35] shout
[1:02:35] i don't know why y'all shout
[1:02:38] you might shout because your neighbors
[1:02:40] shout all right
[1:02:42] your hood's been shot i don't know why
[1:02:44] y'all shout
[1:02:46] it's got to be an individual thing
[1:02:50] right we we come here this morning uh as
[1:02:53] individual now y'all just pray for him
[1:02:55] i'm gonna get out trying to get the
[1:02:56] flesh out the way first
[1:02:58] uh but but whatever i do on a spiritual
[1:03:01] note
[1:03:01] i do it for myself
[1:03:05] by revelation right because that's how
[1:03:08] he deals with gentiles as
[1:03:11] individuals if you're not coming here as
[1:03:14] an
[1:03:14] individual to get closer to god
[1:03:17] something's wrong
[1:03:19] it's okay to start out that way well you
[1:03:22] know my mama bringing me to church
[1:03:24] and praising lord well you ain't got no
[1:03:26] choice
[1:03:28] when you when you're young you got to go
[1:03:30] to church
[1:03:32] you know but but as you get older
[1:03:35] you know you start making your own
[1:03:37] decisions and things of that nature
[1:03:39] well you're going to be hell responsible
[1:03:41] i ain't going to go that way this
[1:03:42] morning that was free
[1:03:44] right uh uh
[1:03:47] brother branham preached a message the
[1:03:49] restoration of the bride tree
[1:03:52] yeah really really really powerful
[1:03:55] powerful message and and my hope this
[1:03:59] morning
[1:03:59] is is that uh at the end of the show
[1:04:02] because i i've been thinking
[1:04:03] brother jack has been preaching some
[1:04:05] just outstanding
[1:04:08] messages is that right can y'all all
[1:04:10] agree
[1:04:11] man i tell you what i was having myself

[1:04:42] is that right i hope i don't get in
[1:04:45] trouble now y'all don't stick your dogs
[1:04:47] on me when i get out of charge
[1:04:50] god just put that in my mouth that ain't
[1:04:52] on my nose all right
[1:04:54] all right come on you know we come we
[1:04:57] come
[1:04:58] lord help us let me leave that alone
[1:05:01] don't you don't you pull on me like that
[1:05:03] brother troy i got this cordless
[1:05:06] folk will be putting the head down
[1:05:08] before i get started girls
[1:05:11] uh but but by the end of the service
[1:05:15] um i i just trust that you know we could
[1:05:18] get
[1:05:19] stronger and grow stronger in our
[1:05:20] understanding
[1:05:22] uh in the faith right
[1:05:25] one of the things we realize faith comes
[1:05:28] by
[1:05:28] hearing and hearing of the word of god
[1:05:32] is that right amen and uh the prophet of
[1:05:37] god he starts to talk about
[1:05:39] restoration right right uh uh
[1:05:42] and he says restoration it means to
[1:05:45] bring back or to restore a claim
[1:05:48] can be enforced but
[1:05:52] one of the things we we know that
[1:05:54] because we were born in sin
[1:05:56] right we we we were separated
[1:06:01] right come on we we
[1:06:04] we were separated and we thank god for
[1:06:07] reconciliation this morning
[1:06:10] we thank god for uh being restored being
[1:06:14] brought
[1:06:14] back to to this place
[1:06:17] right brother brandon makes a statement
[1:06:19] in the breach he said
[1:06:21] you know all that adam lost
[1:06:24] right now that's that's really powerful
[1:06:28] that's that's a really powerful thought
[1:06:31] right
[1:06:32] but but i think in our understanding
[1:06:36] right um not in just not we ain't
[1:06:38] dealing with just head knowledge
[1:06:40] yeah we talking about what has taken
[1:06:42] that 18 inch
[1:06:43] drop what's here
[1:06:47] right that's what that's what's lacking
[1:06:49] what's here
[1:06:50] yeah we might have a lot of information
[1:06:52] we might can say
[1:06:54] brother branham said this in the bible
[1:06:56] said this
[1:06:57] that don't mean anything if you're not
[1:06:59] operating in accordance
[1:07:03] see here's the thing that made the that
[1:07:05] made this i was
[1:07:06] i wrote this in in the footnotes here's
[1:07:09] the thing that made the difference
[1:07:11] right um um in this the one slave in the
[1:07:14] rest of the group
[1:07:16] right his knowledge of who he was
[1:07:21] right his knowledge of who he was
[1:07:24] made the difference and how he walked
[1:07:28] how he he acted his his attitude
[1:07:32] see they couldn't understand that what
[1:07:34] what makes him different
[1:07:36] it was his knowledge come on preach with
[1:07:38] somebody
[1:07:40] it's your knowledge that makes the
[1:07:42] difference
[1:07:43] in how you walk how you talk
[1:07:47] is that right well i'm a christian we
[1:07:49] got our heads
[1:07:50] hanging down we can't hardly smile
[1:07:53] come on now
[1:07:57] we got to realize amen what christ has
[1:08:00] done for
[1:08:00] us what what we've been brought into
[1:08:03] now i'm just kind of building this
[1:08:05] morning right
[1:08:07] amen what we've been brought into
[1:08:10] this family right amen that we've been
[1:08:14] brought into
[1:08:15] is that right glory to god amen there's
[1:08:18] a lot that goes along
[1:08:20] uh uh with it right
[1:08:24] this restoration
[1:08:27] saying you're a christian that's a lot
[1:08:29] that goes along with this
[1:08:32] and and i enjoy these things for myself
[1:08:35] because
[1:08:36] uh i'm no different than you all now i
[1:08:39] get anointed when i'm preaching but i
[1:08:40] ain't always under this kind of
[1:08:42] anointing
[1:08:43] [Music]
[1:08:44] right i'm i'm 16 elements of how many
[1:08:47] elements we've been made up of i'm just
[1:08:49] like you and i
[1:08:50] when i ain't anointed now when i get
[1:08:52] anointed i feel like i can run through a
[1:08:54] truth
[1:08:58] but but you take the anointing off then
[1:09:01] then
[1:09:02] i have to operate a certain kind of way
[1:09:05] because i don't know about you amen
[1:09:07] uh i i want to uh uh experience
[1:09:11] all of what the words say i supposed to
[1:09:14] be experienced
[1:09:15] and i think that's what brother jack has
[1:09:17] been bringing to us
[1:09:19] see experiencing everything amen that
[1:09:23] the words say we supposed to be
[1:09:25] experienced see we still can have what
[1:09:29] we say
[1:09:35] because he said we can
[1:09:39] glory to god because he said we can have
[1:09:41] it then we can have it
[1:09:45] glory to god glory to god so
[1:09:48] so we got to understand what goes along
[1:09:53] with
[1:09:53] restoration listen we have rights
[1:09:57] yes right and and i was i was thinking
[1:10:01] about something
[1:10:02] as as i was looking at you know the the
[1:10:05] scriptures and and the the thought that
[1:10:08] the prophet of god was bringing
[1:10:09] out um uh
[1:10:13] a lot of times because we we don't
[1:10:17] understand our rights we get taken
[1:10:19] advantage of
[1:10:20] all right come on now
[1:10:24] sometimes it's times right you know you
[1:10:27] you be on social media and and you find
[1:10:31] people there able to stand up to
[1:10:34] uh just say the police and things of
[1:10:36] that nature not in a negative way
[1:10:38] just by knowing their rights knowing
[1:10:41] knowing the law
[1:10:44] right it gives you the advantage it
[1:10:48] gives you the victory
[1:10:50] in situations people can't just walk
[1:10:53] over you and
[1:10:54] and y'all want to talk to me see when
[1:10:57] when you know your rights then the devil
[1:10:59] just don't walk over you
[1:11:02] when you know who you are you know your
[1:11:04] rights and you don't walk around and
[1:11:06] you know in depression and oppression
[1:11:09] and things of that nature
[1:11:10] you give that back to the postman that
[1:11:13] don't belong to me
[1:11:15] is that right uh uh uh
[1:11:19] corporations and things of that nature
[1:11:21] they hire smart
[1:11:22] people people with knowledge lawyers and
[1:11:26] and and tax people right
[1:11:30] so so a lot of times
[1:11:33] that so that they they could work even
[1:11:35] sometimes on the edge
[1:11:42] they want to find all of the loopholes
[1:11:45] they get smart folk they pay them big
[1:11:49] money to to show them where
[1:11:52] the loopholes are in the law
[1:11:56] right now right see
[1:12:00] now we ain't trying to find no loopholes
[1:12:02] but i'm just trying to show us something
[1:12:05] how how important our knowledge
[1:12:08] of of our rights and the law
[1:12:12] is to us right
[1:12:15] these people pay money because they see
[1:12:18] the value
[1:12:21] the value amen in this
[1:12:25] knowledge and how this knowledge
[1:12:28] benefits their companies and they make
[1:12:32] millions and millions and and you can't
[1:12:36] say
[1:12:36] you you could say it's illegal but it's
[1:12:38] not so much illegal
[1:12:40] because it's in the guidelines all right
[1:12:42] see
[1:12:43] you they ain't got to worry about amen
[1:12:46] the cuts being put on them because
[1:12:48] they're working within the guidelines of
[1:12:51] the written
[1:12:52] law the law of the land
[1:12:56] right right see it's it's the this the
[1:12:59] law of the land
[1:13:00] that gives them the the go ahead
[1:13:04] to do certain things now when you go
[1:13:08] outside of that
[1:13:10] then that's when you go into jail
[1:13:13] right people go to jail not because they
[1:13:16] on the edge because they
[1:13:18] crossed the line all right all right
[1:13:20] right they crossed
[1:13:21] they crossed the line and they ain't got
[1:13:23] nothing to back them up
[1:13:26] y'all didn't agree with me this morning
[1:13:29] they crossed the line
[1:13:30] right that's why they go to jail but as
[1:13:33] long as they
[1:13:34] they can get as close to their line as
[1:13:35] they want to
[1:13:37] as long as they got some laws and things
[1:13:40] there
[1:13:41] to back them up they ain't got to worry
[1:13:43] about nothing
[1:13:44] is that right see we we have we have got
[1:13:47] to keep this
[1:13:48] this thought in mind right it's so
[1:13:51] that's why the bible says study to show
[1:13:53] our self approval unto god
[1:13:55] one of these days we gon we gonna
[1:13:57] realize how important it is to
[1:13:59] study on our own not just wait till we
[1:14:01] come to church
[1:14:03] to to listen right to tapes and things
[1:14:06] of that nature
[1:14:07] because that there's a wealth of
[1:14:11] information that's needed
[1:14:14] for us as individuals
[1:14:18] right come on now come on come on
[1:14:21] there's a wealth there's a wealth i've
[1:14:24] been preaching a long time and i've
[1:14:25] listened to
[1:14:26] i probably preached this message and
[1:14:28] i've listened and some things
[1:14:30] i know but it's sometimes when things
[1:14:33] come back around
[1:14:34] and inspiration strikes it again
[1:14:37] it just really lifts you up and it just
[1:14:40] really elevates
[1:14:42] us is that right yeah yeah oh glory to
[1:14:46] his wonderful name
[1:14:47] so so it's knowing your rights
[1:14:51] knowing your rights you know uh
[1:14:56] people we have very little knowledge of
[1:14:58] of our rights
[1:15:00] just even as american citizens
[1:15:04] and this is why people do us any kind of
[1:15:06] way that they want to take they take
[1:15:07] advantage of us
[1:15:09] just so many things that we we we
[1:15:12] lack so many things that they don't even
[1:15:16] inform us
[1:15:17] in school you go to college
[1:15:21] there's so many things that they they
[1:15:23] keep you
[1:15:24] away from they don't want you privy of
[1:15:26] this knowledge
[1:15:29] right they don't want you to know amen
[1:15:31] what you entitled to
[1:15:33] as americans
[1:15:37] right they want us in just a certain
[1:15:40] bracket all right come on is that right
[1:15:43] glory to god
[1:15:44] yeah you know i was even thinking and uh
[1:15:47] just over the past how
[1:15:49] the last holiday um
[1:15:52] i was kind of chatting it up with sister
[1:15:54] johnson and some of them
[1:15:55] because they've coming to a knowledge
[1:15:59] right that uh
[1:16:02] we as african-americans hadn't really
[1:16:06] been privy to
[1:16:08] nobody when i was coming up talked about
[1:16:10] amen
[1:16:11] uh uh stocks and and all that y'all can
[1:16:15] preach with me
[1:16:19] yeah yeah that's true
[1:16:23] we you know all we all we got was
[1:16:26] with slogans when we we we were young
[1:16:29] converts
[1:16:31] right we got a bunch of slogans and a
[1:16:33] bunch of things that
[1:16:35] uh uh you know made us shout with no
[1:16:38] knowledge of
[1:16:40] but but what i thought we we lacked
[1:16:44] was just just common knowledge even of
[1:16:47] life
[1:16:49] all right because you can't just be so
[1:16:52] heavily minded that you ain't no earthly
[1:16:54] good
[1:16:56] cause you still gotta live here
[1:16:59] you still gotta function you still gotta
[1:17:01] eat you still gotta raise your children
[1:17:04] and see even for me i i tried to raise
[1:17:08] my children to go
[1:17:09] even on another level
[1:17:13] right i remember i remember talking
[1:17:16] about these things and trying to get
[1:17:18] folks to
[1:17:19] study finances and i don't know where
[1:17:21] this from but i'm gonna preach it anyway
[1:17:24] right hey man you know working working
[1:17:27] on the beach i'm gonna get to my subject
[1:17:28] i guess i'm gonna just go the way you
[1:17:30] leave me this morning
[1:17:31] uh uh uh working on the island for three
[1:17:36] years
[1:17:36] i said to myself man i ain't never seen
[1:17:38] so many and they talking about a
[1:17:40] recession
[1:17:41] ain't never seen so many mansions built
[1:17:43] in all my life where these people
[1:17:44] getting all this money from
[1:17:48] and and why i ain't got none
[1:17:53] right what where's the secret what did
[1:17:55] they keep away from they kept
[1:17:57] they kept away from me the knowledge
[1:18:00] of how to get wealth
[1:18:04] we still scared of that you preach this
[1:18:08] certain places they be looking at you
[1:18:10] and they'll tell you about brother
[1:18:11] branham don't
[1:18:12] tell me that
[1:18:15] [Applause]

[1:18:20] didn't die poor didn't dress
[1:18:23] poor had a cow like when he dropped
[1:18:26] when he died she don't tell you all that
[1:18:29] they tell you a bunch of other stuff
[1:18:32] right but i'm gonna i'ma tell y'all
[1:18:35] i'ma tell y'all
[1:18:39] these people worth a hundred and some
[1:18:41] million dollars
[1:18:42] where they get that from
[1:18:46] come on preach with me church
[1:18:49] we we we you know we we gotta we gotta
[1:18:52] touch on these things because jack
[1:18:54] brother jack has a vision
[1:18:55] hallelujah
[1:19:00] and see it takes finances to go along
[1:19:04] with division
[1:19:08] and we need to be able to excel in
[1:19:11] finance
[1:19:14] glory but that's just denominational say
[1:19:17] what you want to say i'm a preacher
[1:19:19] anyhow
[1:19:21] all of us can't be be struggling
[1:19:26] come on we we
[1:19:30] listen church we we have we have young
[1:19:32] minds in here
[1:19:34] i remember when i was younger commercial
[1:19:37] used to say a mind is a terrible thing
[1:19:39] to waste
[1:19:41] it's the truth it's a terrible thing to
[1:19:45] waste
[1:19:46] right some of these young people can
[1:19:48] excel in these
[1:19:50] things and help elevate us
[1:19:53] we're getting older i'm getting old
[1:19:55] demanded i'm woe out
[1:19:56] construction is beating me down now
[1:20:00] i used to think i was superman i realize
[1:20:03] now
[1:20:04] man kryptonite didn't found me
[1:20:08] my kryptonite is every every year i have
[1:20:11] a birthday i got another one coming up
[1:20:13] in a couple of
[1:20:14] you know six seven weeks or something
[1:20:16] like that right come on
[1:20:18] and and i know at some point i gotta
[1:20:21] change
[1:20:22] pace so so these
[1:20:25] this kind of stuff is important for us
[1:20:28] we're getting older brother jack
[1:20:30] following behind me brother troy
[1:20:33] right glory to god brother calvin
[1:20:35] brother calvin can't be lifting these
[1:20:36] couches for the rest of his life
[1:20:41] he might could drive for a little bit
[1:20:43] longer but
[1:20:44] man them couches are killing you
[1:20:49] i'm telling you right so so i'm saying
[1:20:52] this because
[1:20:54] uh uh uh knowledge is important
[1:20:58] right in in all all aspects
[1:21:02] right we just don't want it to be one
[1:21:04] way just so spiritual and so deep and
[1:21:06] everything is about the word
[1:21:08] i don't function like that
[1:21:13] i just don't that the bible said there's
[1:21:16] a there's a there's a time
[1:21:18] and a place and a season for everything
[1:21:21] and every time you get around me i just
[1:21:24] don't want you trying to quote to me
[1:21:29] it's the truth anyhow i'm gonna be
[1:21:31] honest with you i ain't built like that
[1:21:35] studying that you gotta study
[1:21:38] but for some people it ain't good
[1:21:41] i'ma say this and i'm gonna move on how
[1:21:43] much time i got i could put my glasses
[1:21:45] on
[1:21:46] um i remember a brother one time um
[1:21:49] good brother good brother um
[1:21:52] he had gotten saved and and uh
[1:21:55] god was working on him and he was
[1:21:58] scramming
[1:21:59] trying to cram so much word
[1:22:02] to the brother actually lost himself
[1:22:06] a good man good man police and
[1:22:09] everything
[1:22:10] just trying to catch up with brothers
[1:22:12] had had been around the word of god
[1:22:14] for years been studying the message for
[1:22:17] years
[1:22:18] man and he was just trying to just it's
[1:22:21] like brother you got to give it a break
[1:22:22] sometimes you got to be in the natural
[1:22:24] sometimes
[1:22:25] you got to laugh you got a wife you got
[1:22:27] to you know make her happy you got
[1:22:30] children you got to raise i mean there's
[1:22:32] other things
[1:22:33] because god's going to give you what you
[1:22:35] need when you need it
[1:22:38] you better believe that it's it's not
[1:22:41] about
[1:22:41] catching up it's not about who got the
[1:22:44] most knowledge and who got the most
[1:22:46] revelation i you know when i preach i
[1:22:49] ain't concerned
[1:22:50] about about and i think i've probably
[1:22:52] been preaching longer than
[1:22:54] everybody all the brothers in here
[1:22:57] but i don't never approach the gospel
[1:23:00] like that i'm not
[1:23:01] trying to impress anybody i ain't in no
[1:23:04] contests
[1:23:04] with anybody i'm just trying to be a
[1:23:07] blessing
[1:23:08] to everybody
[1:23:11] yield the vessels that god can speak to
[1:23:14] our hearts
[1:23:14] and give us something that help us in
[1:23:17] the natural
[1:23:18] and the spiritual that's why i like
[1:23:19] brother jack's balance
[1:23:22] right it's spiritual and natural
[1:23:25] because because the laws that god set up
[1:23:28] when we get into it if i can get off of
[1:23:29] there
[1:23:30] is is natural and spiritual
[1:23:34] right and so if if we've been brought
[1:23:37] back to this
[1:23:38] place because we know there was a fall
[1:23:41] that put us on this side of the chasm
[1:23:44] right
[1:23:44] right right amen we we when we came here
[1:23:48] and we still ain't in our ought to be
[1:23:50] placed
[1:23:51] [Music]
[1:23:52] right that's why that brother branham
[1:23:54] said there's a groaning
[1:23:57] there's still a groaning if they ain't
[1:23:59] groaning in you something's wrong
[1:24:02] come on glory to god amen
[1:24:06] as sons of god so we we've been brought
[1:24:09] back to this place listen church
[1:24:12] this morning i'm no longer a sinner all

[1:27:44] that's right see the
[1:27:47] the this knowledge right see it it
[1:27:50] changes the way
[1:27:52] we view life
[1:27:56] i view life totally different i might be
[1:27:59] considered a fanatic in a crank
[1:28:01] but by the way i just view things from a
[1:28:04] different standpoint
[1:28:06] uh uh i i've learned not to be critical
[1:28:10] anymore but but my views may
[1:28:13] differ from your views it just depends
[1:28:17] on where you
[1:28:17] are and and and because i'm up here
[1:28:21] i'm not i'll come down here only
[1:28:24] to fellowship with you but amen in my
[1:28:27] views
[1:28:28] i'm not coming down here with you i'm
[1:28:31] not compromising with you and your
[1:28:33] your thoughts because i if your thoughts
[1:28:36] amen is not lining up with the word of
[1:28:38] god
[1:28:39] right something's wrong your views and
[1:28:42] your opinions and your feelings
[1:28:44] look church i ain't got nothing to do
[1:28:45] with that i don't operate in feelings
[1:28:48] and emotions and
[1:28:49] i operate based upon amen i'm trying to
[1:28:52] in a lot of areas i may not be
[1:28:54] but but in a lot of areas i'm only
[1:28:57] trying to operate based upon the
[1:28:58] scriptures
[1:29:01] see even even in the flesh the hardest
[1:29:04] see this is my enemy right here
[1:29:09] this is the thing that i struggle with
[1:29:12] right glory to god this is this is the
[1:29:15] thing that i wore with
[1:29:17] not my wife our biggest battle be
[1:29:20] ourselves
[1:29:22] and overcoming and that's why these
[1:29:25] thoughts are so important to us

[1:29:31] blaming people now
[1:29:32] that's right you are you are where you

[1:29:59] blame me for a lot of stuff stop it
[1:30:03] you did that you made the choice
[1:30:07] right you made the choice you reasoned
[1:30:10] with the devil
[1:30:12] how could eve eve couldn't
[1:30:15] listen it wasn't adam's fault right
[1:30:19] adam wasn't there if adam was there
[1:30:22] uh she wouldn't have failed
[1:30:25] but but she got smaller than her mate
[1:30:29] and she reasoned and boo caused the
[1:30:31] trouble
[1:30:32] come on somebody oh glory to god it's
[1:30:35] the truth
[1:30:36] i'm trying to go somewhere see
[1:30:40] knowledge changes the way that we view
[1:30:43] life
[1:30:44] the way we walk the way we talk
[1:30:48] the way we live right
[1:30:51] the atmosphere right
[1:30:54] that that we live in
[1:30:57] that we create that's in church man
[1:31:01] on my birthday i'll be 59 years old i
[1:31:03] refuse
[1:31:04] to live in an atmosphere
[1:31:07] right i i ain't saying today i thank god
[1:31:10] for birthdays
[1:31:12] my mama just turned 80 years old
[1:31:15] still i'll be 59 years younger
[1:31:21] to god and and and
[1:31:25] and at this stage of life i'm just
[1:31:28] trying to create
[1:31:29] a more positive atmosphere
[1:31:34] right glory to god to live in
[1:31:38] see i want a bunch of people around me
[1:31:40] gloom and doom and depression
[1:31:42] and oppression and things of that nature
[1:31:45] i thank god this week uh
[1:31:46] uh my son was home uh for a week uh
[1:31:50] uh from work and he called me and he
[1:31:52] said uh dad um
[1:31:54] uh you got you got anything for
[1:31:57] me to do
[1:31:58] you know i could work and i just started
[1:32:00] this this house i say uh
[1:32:03] yeah come on man i took him to work a
[1:32:05] couple of days and
[1:32:06] it was an opportunity to just fellowship
[1:32:09] and and talk can let him talk and try to
[1:32:13] try to share uh uh you know what's
[1:32:16] what's on his heart try to you know lead
[1:32:19] him in in the right
[1:32:20] direction i i just took the opportunity
[1:32:23] and i said you know i need to do this a
[1:32:24] little bit more often
[1:32:26] you know um um just just take the
[1:32:29] opportunity
[1:32:31] you know because he's he's i didn't have
[1:32:34] a daddy come on brother
[1:32:36] well i take that back i did have a daddy
[1:32:40] right but he he just didn't give me
[1:32:43] nothing
[1:32:44] right he was like the old song papa was
[1:32:48] a rolling stone when he left me he just
[1:32:50] left me alone
[1:32:52] he didn't leave me with no money no
[1:32:55] identity
[1:32:56] no wealth of knowledge no nothing
[1:32:59] right so it's like god is putting me in
[1:33:03] this position
[1:33:05] and giving me this knowledge right
[1:33:08] that i could be able to amen right
[1:33:11] pour into him right
[1:33:15] glory to god glory to god just sometimes
[1:33:18] sometimes you know you take these subtle
[1:33:20] opportunities
[1:33:22] to share the wealth of knowledge
[1:33:25] amen just sow seed just sow the seed
[1:33:29] just put it out there if you sow the
[1:33:33] right kind of
[1:33:33] seed it'll come up
[1:33:37] huh one thing one thing one thing i know
[1:33:40] the bible says uh
[1:33:41] this right train up a child and the way
[1:33:44] that she go
[1:33:46] see you you you know i like something
[1:33:49] brother jack said last week
[1:33:51] right when his his daughters went on
[1:33:54] vacay and things of that nature
[1:33:56] probably when they were younger boy he
[1:33:59] was probably standing there
[1:34:00] like boy boy let me tell you something
[1:34:04] he was in control you could control
[1:34:07] the situation when they get older forget
[1:34:10] about it
[1:34:10] all right when they get older
[1:34:14] you can only rely upon what you put
[1:34:18] in there all right
[1:34:22] right because you can't follow him
[1:34:27] all right sometimes my son tell me about
[1:34:30] things that he's done
[1:34:32] to me in a way it's mind-blowing it's
[1:34:35] like
[1:34:35] but then i have to look back and say
[1:34:37] well i did those things and i did it
[1:34:39] kind of the same way
[1:34:41] right glory to god but i i'm glad that
[1:34:45] i've grown
[1:34:46] to a place where i could take the
[1:34:49] opportunity
[1:34:51] and just be they daddy
[1:34:54] right not a pastor
[1:34:58] that probably was hard knowing that i
[1:35:02] had to go
[1:35:02] they had to go home with the pastor all
[1:35:06] right
[1:35:06] all right sometimes you know even as
[1:35:10] ministers
[1:35:12] we got to learn how to put that hat over
[1:35:14] here
[1:35:17] and and and be it be the daddy
[1:35:20] amen see be the daddy i'm preaching i
[1:35:23] ain't got where i want to go
[1:35:25] but when it's done it's done today
[1:35:28] because
[1:35:28] it's all knowledge right
[1:35:32] so some sometimes there's things that we
[1:35:34] you know we
[1:35:35] we we gotta gravitate towards
[1:35:39] right we can't just be all cut and dry
[1:35:42] listen
[1:35:42] you got to be 17 dealing with the 17.
[1:35:50] i can't i can't deal with a 23
[1:35:54] i have a knowledge because i'm i'm 58
[1:35:58] where i can break myself down and think
[1:36:01] about
[1:36:02] what type of individual that i was when
[1:36:04] i was 23
[1:36:06] and understand yeah
[1:36:12] this realm because of this knowledge
[1:36:15] and understand and try to
[1:36:19] if it ain't but a little bit by little
[1:36:21] bit
[1:36:22] right give them something to elevate
[1:36:25] them
[1:36:26] or bring them out of that thing
[1:36:29] sister lewis used to sing this song
[1:36:32] little by
[1:36:32] little we'll win every battle
[1:36:36] it's it's it's a little bit by a little
[1:36:39] bit
[1:36:40] by a little bit by a little bit by a
[1:36:43] little bit

[1:48:03] now to bring anything back to its

[1:48:13] restoration abroad tree um
[1:48:15] verse 83 yeah um my page here

[1:48:23] from his original owner and can wander
[1:48:25] around
[1:48:26] anywhere but to restore is to bring
[1:48:29] back to to it who really
[1:48:32] owns it to bring it back to its natural
[1:48:36] state i just want to get to a point
[1:48:37] where it was that the first time to
[1:48:39] bring it back to
[1:48:40] its natural condition thank god for that

[1:52:44] some somebody stole some property
[1:52:47] and they're holding the property cap
[1:52:50] captive
[1:52:51] then you can take see watch this the

[2:02:24] he has unrightly deceitfully taken from
[2:02:28] god souls of men he took from god
[2:02:32] souls of women cheering sicknesses of
[2:02:34] the body he placed upon people where

[2:14:18] i'm learning that
[2:14:19] well it's like this i don't care what it
[2:14:22] look
[2:14:22] like i'm only looking at what the words
[2:14:25] say
[2:14:26] amen right amen because what it is now
[2:14:30] is only temporal anyway

[2:14:45] had a scripture
[2:14:46] on that he said yes sir god sets all of
[2:14:48] his laws in motion think of it
[2:14:50] let it soak in that cause we're coming
[2:14:52] to a healing
[2:14:53] uh a healing service in a few minutes
[2:14:55] god sent all of his laws into motion
[2:14:58] that it must work according to his own
[2:15:00] word
[2:15:02] right that's why you don't take i ain't
[2:15:04] letting nobody take this from me
[2:15:07] is that right amen um his word his laws
[2:15:11] has to work according to his word
[2:15:13] he commanded the son he commanded the
[2:15:15] moon he commanded the earth
[2:15:17] he commanded all nature and and they all
[2:15:20] fall right into line and all the laws
[2:15:24] work in harmony with god's spoken word
[2:15:26] and the law of life that's
[2:15:28] in us will also bring us to resurrection
[2:15:31] it's got to it's impossible for not
[2:15:34] ain't that powerful think about that
[2:15:36] church
[2:15:37] see this that's why i say the knowledge
[2:15:40] of these things
[2:15:40] it takes all the worry why what what are
[2:15:43] we worried about
[2:15:45] god's got it all in control right amen
[2:15:50] uh this is the last thing he says 120.
[2:15:52] he said now that's the reason
[2:15:54] he said the law of life that was in
[2:15:55] christ when the word was spoke
[2:15:58] and said i'll not suffer my holy one to
[2:16:02] see corruption neither will he leave his
[2:16:04] soul in hell there wasn't
[2:16:06] enough time there wasn't enough devils
[2:16:08] see
[2:16:09] there wasn't enough anything to keep
[2:16:11] christ in the grave
[2:16:13] amen uh his body began to rot because
[2:16:16] the law of god would bring the word to
[2:16:18] pass
[2:16:21] don't let nobody take this from you you
[2:16:23] gotta
[2:16:24] operate based upon the word not your
[2:16:28] feelings
[2:16:29] not your emotions because in that we up
[2:16:32] and down one minute we happy the next
[2:16:34] minute we said

[2:29:10] and we got to know that we're kin to god
[2:29:14] we can't let the devil hand us any kind
[2:29:16] of way i love that
[2:29:18] i was just as he was reading that quote
[2:29:20] on brother ramsey say there's a
[2:29:22] law and a fish when he's in the water he
[2:29:25] just
[2:29:25] swims and now you get him out the water
[2:29:28] he can't do nothing
[2:29:30] but when they get in the water you're in
[2:29:31] trouble right and
[2:29:33] he just he just swims he just does what
[2:29:35] he does when he's in the water and
[2:29:37] he talked about how that bird you know
[2:29:39] if we want to fly
[2:29:41] we might have to try to get up on the
[2:29:42] top of some mountain and take off
[2:29:44] running and amen and try to glide but
[2:29:47] you know there's
[2:29:48] a law in us that pulls us right back
[2:29:52] you can't stay up there that long hey
[2:29:55] man you gonna come back down
[2:29:56] parachute and all come bring you down
[2:29:59] right it's it's like but it was a law
[2:30:01] and a bird that he'll need none of that
[2:30:03] he gonna when it when it's time to fly
[2:30:07] you know what the bird don't pray about
[2:30:08] it
[2:30:12] the bird don't fast about it the fish
[2:30:16] ain't fasting if it's just i'm in one
[2:30:17] i'm gonna do what i do when i'm in the
[2:30:19] water
[2:30:20] and it just kind of struck me and say a
[2:30:22] fish swims
[2:30:24] a bird flies but a son or daughter of
[2:30:28] god

[2:39:08] have gifts they come together
[2:39:11] at a particular time and just sit and
[2:39:13] wait on the lord and that's that's what
[2:39:15] we're there to do just wait on the lord

[2:44:07] brother would you come and speak to our
[2:44:09] men
[2:44:11] in september i say lord jesus
[2:44:16] god what is this i said lord
[2:44:19] give me some wisdom on how to handle
[2:44:24] this because i'm not looking for none of
[2:44:27] this
[2:44:28] but i know god is moving and i know that
[2:44:31] like i was telling my brother
[2:44:32] i want to be i want to just be in this
[2:44:34] wheel that's all
[2:44:35] i just want to be in god's will whatever
[2:44:37] whatever that is but
[2:44:39] uh but y'all just keep us in prayer we
[2:44:41] you know we're just trying to find
[2:44:42] you know just the mind of god for a lot
[2:44:44] of these things and uh
[2:44:46] and and the the the the thing for the
[2:44:48] men
[2:44:49] uh they told me that all of our brothers
[2:44:51] would be invited now we can't have all
[2:44:53] the brothers go
[2:44:54] to a meeting y'all understand what i'm
[2:44:56] saying
[2:44:57] it's a it's a meeting for men and
[2:44:59] sometimes you hear
[2:45:00] things like that why start thinking it's
[2:45:01] for the brothers yeah let my husband
[2:45:04] please send my husband up there to that
[2:45:06] meeting
[2:45:07] he might come back with something new
[2:45:10] so truthy now but uh but but but but uh
[2:45:14] just you know they told me they're gonna
[2:45:15] i'll i'll put the announcement there on
[2:45:17] the board for
[2:45:18] for the brothers when it comes i'll let
[2:45:19] you know but uh
[2:45:21] if it's something like that for the man
[2:45:23] you know in the in the denomination
[2:45:24] world they do things like promise
[2:45:26] keepers
[2:45:27] and they try to do that for men but this
[2:45:29] is something where brothers have a
[2:45:30] message get together and i think they
[2:45:31] have a limit to 120 brothers that
[2:45:33] they're going to invite
[2:45:35] whatever you pay the fee going to cover
[2:45:37] your food and cover your lodging and all
[2:45:39] of that but
[2:45:40] i think it'll be something really really
[2:45:41] nice if some of the brothers were able
[2:45:43] to attend
[2:45:44] uh that's going to be in september but a
[2:45:46] lot coming up
[2:45:47] a lot coming up and uh we just want to

[2:48:18] but to release and give back
[2:48:21] what has been stolen from us if he's
[2:48:24] taken our health
[2:48:25] health must be given back if he's taken
[2:48:28] our children

[2:55:41] that's why brother smiley said just tell
[2:55:42] them how many you want now that's all

[2:55:47] [Music]
[2:55:54] just tell them how many won't oh
[2:56:01] [Music]
[2:56:07] um that was for me
[2:56:10] not cause he called my name but this
[2:56:13] morning i woke up
[2:56:15] early and i was laying in bed and i came
[2:56:18] to like a resolve
[2:56:19] that i would never have kids and i was
[2:56:22] like
[2:56:22] i'm okay with that maybe god just wants
[2:56:24] me to be the cool all right
[2:56:26] and i'm okay god if you don't want me to
[2:56:28] have kids i'm fine with that
[2:56:30] and um and then i was just at peace that
[2:56:34] everything was gonna be okay so when he
[2:56:37] said it even though he was speaking to
[2:56:40] stephen i was like that was god
[2:56:44] confirming to me that the promise that
[2:56:47] do you mind if they pull up one more
[2:56:48] scripture genesis 30 22
[2:56:52] was a scripture that god gave me to hold
[2:56:55] on to
[2:56:57] and i always quoted in fact when our
[2:56:59] house was being built
[2:57:01] we wrote it on the foundation of our
[2:57:02] house before they laid the towel
[2:57:04] and god remembered rachel and hearken to
[2:57:06] her and open her room
[2:57:11] and last sunday well
[2:57:14] earlier this year delshna came to me and
[2:57:17] she asked me why don't you have a baby
[2:57:18] and i said because i'm waiting on god
[2:57:21] she said god's going to give you a baby
[2:57:22] i said i believe it
[2:57:24] she said thank you and walked away so
[2:57:26] last sunday she came to me and she put
[2:57:28] she said let me hear the baby and she
[2:57:30] put her ear to my
[2:57:31] stomach i said there's no baby yet but
[2:57:33] it's coming and she touched my heart and
[2:57:35] she said
[2:57:36] keep believing god's gonna give it to
[2:57:38] you and i said
[2:57:39] i know and she said before this year and
[2:57:42] i said
[2:57:43] i know you told me and she said okay and
[2:57:45] she walked away
[2:57:47] and so when he said that it was just
[2:57:49] confirmation to me
[2:57:51] from everything i've been holding on to
[2:57:53] and the the first thing that popped in
[2:57:54] my mind when you said that was that
[2:57:56] scripture that i just got to keep
[2:57:57] holding on to that scripture
[2:58:04] [Music]
[2:58:04] [Applause]
[2:58:10] god bless you sir rachel the rachel has
[2:58:13] been on my heart for prayers

[2:58:18] year or two years mother's day
[2:58:20] and asked brother jack we were watching
[2:58:22] mother's day to go and greet him

[2:58:26] sitting by herself

[2:58:30] lord

[2:58:36] testimonies i wanted to just run faster

[2:58:47] had a heart attack he was on the verge
