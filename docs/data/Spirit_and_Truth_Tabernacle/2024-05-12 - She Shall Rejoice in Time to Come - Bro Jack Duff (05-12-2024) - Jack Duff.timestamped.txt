[6:08] hallelujah amen Christ is Enough amen
[6:12] the one thing needful is Jesus Christ
[6:15] amen we can never have enough of him
[6:18] praise the Lord he's all we have need of
[6:21] Amen let's open our
[6:25] Bibles praise the Lord I wanted to read
[6:28] something a little different we're going
[6:29] to turn to Matthew
[6:33] 21 and let's start at verse
[6:37] 8 happy Mother's Day to all your mothers
[6:41] amen I was reading this little portion
[6:43] of scripture earlier in the week or
[6:44] maybe last week and I thought this would
[6:46] be real nice for the
[6:49] mothers amen we'll start at verse
[6:53] 8 the scripture says and a very great
[6:56] multitude spread their garments in the
[6:58] way others cut down branches from the
[7:01] trees and straw them in the way and the
[7:03] multitudes that went before and that
[7:05] followed cried saying hosana to the son
[7:09] of David blessed is he that cometh in
[7:11] the name of the Lord hosana in the
[7:14] highest now I got to think and I was
[7:15] like oh these parents are really doing
[7:18] something it's going to affect their
[7:20] children down the
[7:22] road
[7:23] amen then verse 10 says and when he and
[7:26] when he was come into Jerusalem all all
[7:29] the city was moved saying who is this
[7:33] and the multitude said this is Jesus the
[7:35] prophet of Nazareth of
[7:37] Galilee and Jesus went into the temple
[7:39] of God and cast out all them that sold
[7:42] and bought in the temple and overthrew
[7:43] the tables of the money changers and the
[7:46] seats of them that sold doves and said
[7:49] unto them it is written my house shall
[7:51] be called The House of Prayer but ye
[7:54] have made it a den of Thieves and the
[7:56] Blind and the lame came to him in the
[7:58] temple and he healed them and when the
[8:01] chief priests and the scribes saw the
[8:03] wonderful things that he did and the
[8:07] children cried in the temple and saying
[8:09] hosana to the son of David they were so
[8:13] displeased and I got the thinking oh my
[8:14] these children recognized something the
[8:17] wonderful things that Jesus was doing
[8:20] the children knew that this was a son of
[8:22] David before we saw the parents
[8:24] worshiping on their way to church but
[8:26] now the children are in church because
[8:29] of the influence the prophet of God was
[8:31] saying that the mother is the first
[8:32] teacher so these children were learning
[8:35] from their mothers how to worship God
[8:37] and how to recognize the works of the
[8:39] Lord so I thought that was very
[8:42] beautiful and then verse 16 and and said
[8:45] unto him hears thou what these say and
[8:49] Jesus sath unto them yay he acknowledged
[8:53] yes I I hear what they're saying have ye
[8:55] never read out of the mouth of babes and
[8:57] suckings thou Hast PR perfected
[9:01] praise and he left them and went out of
[9:04] the city into Bethany and lodged there
[9:07] amen and I got to thinking how different
[9:10] this is from those 48 children that came
[9:14] out talking to Elisha because of what
[9:17] they learned at home but here you see
[9:20] another example of Godly Parents showing
[9:23] their children how to worship and
[9:24] teaching them at home how to worship and
[9:26] recognize the Messiah when he was a come
[9:29] and I thought it was a beautiful text
[9:31] because of the mothers God bless you and
[9:33] happy Mother's Day to you amen we love
[9:35] you for everything that you
[9:38] do praise the
[9:41] Lord
[9:43] amen sometimes Housewives they may never
[9:47] know how much they mean to this
[9:50] world you never know you sit there you
[9:53] get to thinking how am I impacting this
[9:56] world the children that you are raising
[9:58] to send out and to the world that's
[10:00] how your work is being made
[10:04] manifest when you see doctors and
[10:06] lawyers and policemen and soldiers
[10:09] coming forth It's because of what you
[10:10] put in those children but when you see
[10:13] preachers and deacons and pianists and
[10:16] song leaders and different ones it's
[10:18] because of the influence that you had on
[10:20] their lives never take what you do for
[10:22] granted and you're the backbone of this
[10:24] nation amen God bless you praise the
[10:27] Lord let's bow our heads and pray
[10:29] Heavenly Father we thank you so much
[10:32] Lord that we can come before you and
[10:34] give praise and honor because of who you

[58:13] another drummer I told yall replication

[58:26] for the Lord uh you can't serve God and
[58:29] Mammon at the same time but you got to
[58:31] have a life serve God give him

[58:35] him your gifts he's the one that put the
[58:37] gifts in you now give that back to him
[58:39] and uh and just serve him that's that's
[58:41] all we require just a life just a life a
[58:44] life a life amen I ain't the only one in
[58:46] here got to live right that's
[58:48] right amen everybody got to live right
[58:52] so uh but we want to invest in that
[58:54] young man and we going to figure y way
[58:57] so let me leave it like that amen let's
[59:00] let's turn to a very familiar passage of
[59:04] scripture this morning proverbs
[59:08] 31 amen proverbs
[59:11] 31 and um I will just read one scripture
[59:15] out of this and I'll let you be seated I
[59:18] mean we'll have a word of prayer and
[59:19] I'll let you be seated uh verse
[59:22] 25 uh everybody's very familiar with
[59:25] this proverbs 31 the uh virtuous woman
[59:29] uh passage that is there in the
[59:32] scripture and and if the Lord um if if
[59:36] we have time we'll kind of go through
[59:38] most of it but this verse is what I want
[59:40] to highlight today uh verse 25
[59:44] strength and honor are
[59:48] her uh
[59:50] clothing and she shall
[59:53] rejoice in time to come come amen the
[59:57] Lord had a blessing to the reading of
[1:00:00] his word let's pray father we thank you
[1:00:02] for the ability to read
[1:00:05] scripture we thank you for this uh
[1:00:09] Mother's day that you have uh allowed us
[1:00:12] to come Lord and just uh participate in
[1:00:15] and it's not often that we get a chance
[1:00:17] to just speak to the mothers so I I
[1:00:20] thank you for just a little Sermon Just
[1:00:22] to help them in life's journey I pray
[1:00:25] God that you would take control over the
[1:00:27] thoughts that are being presented as
[1:00:29] well as the thoughts that are being
[1:00:31] received uh we appreciate your anointing
[1:00:34] that has been in this
[1:00:37] Sanctuary uh this morning and father we
[1:00:39] ask that you would just take us further
[1:00:43] amen into that anointing as we hear the
[1:00:46] word of the Lord I also want to remember
[1:00:50] a prayer request that came in Sister
[1:00:52] Irma asking for prayer for brother
[1:00:54] Raphael uh an infection
[1:00:56] that occurred but God we ask that you
[1:00:58] would touch him you've done so much for
[1:01:00] him uh Lord so we just believe that
[1:01:03] you'll complete the work that you
[1:01:05] started and we bind the hands of the
[1:01:07] enemy that's attacking our brother's
[1:01:09] body and father may he be made
[1:01:11] completely whole uh in this situation in
[1:01:15] Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless
[1:01:19] you amen you can be seated sister Irma
[1:01:21] also sent her Mother's Day greeting to
[1:01:24] all the mothers as well amen we want to
[1:01:28] take for a uh topic on today
[1:01:33] amen she shall rejoice in time to come
[1:01:39] amen we're pulling that right from verse
[1:01:41] 25 in Proverbs 31 she shall
[1:01:46] rejoice in time to come
[1:01:51] amen um and I think it's very obvious
[1:01:55] that uh um uh a lot of every mother has
[1:01:59] something that she's she has gone
[1:02:01] through or is going through and um you
[1:02:05] know especially when you have uh kids uh
[1:02:09] you know there's different things that
[1:02:11] kind of come up in in the
[1:02:13] home uh you get to you know as a mother
[1:02:17] you know even I have to say it like this
[1:02:19] as a parent there is no book on
[1:02:23] parenting uh that if you do this it'll
[1:02:26] always work out like this and if you you
[1:02:29] know that that book don't exist uh the
[1:02:33] other thing you find in parenting is
[1:02:35] that every
[1:02:37] child is different so what you have done
[1:02:41] with one child it don't work on
[1:02:45] another praise the Lord you know um I
[1:02:49] can remember when you know Dad would
[1:02:52] have
[1:02:53] to uh you know drop dro the hammer down
[1:02:57] on us cuz Mama done told them something
[1:02:59] that we done did and uh just to kind of
[1:03:02] prove to you the differences in and
[1:03:04] children uh we as boys knew that uh when
[1:03:08] Daddy got home there was going to be no
[1:03:13] discussion just going to be uh he tell
[1:03:16] us to go get the belt we got to go pick
[1:03:19] out the belt that we going to get hit
[1:03:22] with this is you know a little uh
[1:03:25] challeng in here so we go get the
[1:03:27] smallest one we can find uh and daddy
[1:03:30] said you know that's not the one I'm
[1:03:31] looking for and you know he would pretty
[1:03:34] much I mean he he go get the belt the
[1:03:36] strap you know for us but the the
[1:03:39] difference uh is that my
[1:03:42] brother uh he was um a different kid
[1:03:48] praise the Lord my brother would find he
[1:03:50] knew the beating was coming he knew the
[1:03:52] spanking was coming but my brother would
[1:03:54] find things to put in inside of his
[1:03:57] clothes to prevent
[1:03:59] the the straps from hitting him right
[1:04:03] and and uh and and he knew how to act
[1:04:05] that thing out that when Daddy would
[1:04:08] swack he would he would jump and ouch
[1:04:11] and and then Daddy kind of figured wait
[1:04:13] a minute boy you know something ain't
[1:04:16] right about this and and and and when
[1:04:18] Daddy found out what was really going on
[1:04:20] that was it was trouble then right but
[1:04:22] kids are different I never thought to do
[1:04:25] nothing like that with my daddy but my
[1:04:27] brother thought differently so so so so
[1:04:30] so kids are different and you got to
[1:04:32] realize that you have to rais them
[1:04:34] differently and uh and so there's no
[1:04:36] book on these things right but uh as
[1:04:39] parents we do the best we can and
[1:04:41] sometimes uh mothers you uh have done
[1:04:43] the best you can with your kids and then
[1:04:45] they get to a certain age and my they
[1:04:48] don't want nothing to do with the Lord
[1:04:50] no more and they done took off and they
[1:04:52] this and they that and and you didn't
[1:04:54] let me do this and you didn't let me do
[1:04:55] that and you didn't let me I mean you
[1:04:57] just get blam for everything praise God
[1:05:01] rather rather than saying thank you that
[1:05:02] I didn't go to
[1:05:04] jail right thank you that I'm not six
[1:05:07] feet under like my friends right rather
[1:05:10] than saying thank you just get blamed
[1:05:11] for everything but I'm here to tell you
[1:05:13] this morning you will
[1:05:16] rejoice Lord in time to
[1:05:19] come blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:05:22] here uh the prophet tells us something
[1:05:24] here in the message mother's day and uh
[1:05:27] I always like quoting from this sermon
[1:05:29] there's a couple quotes I like to read
[1:05:31] out of Mother's Day uh when we hit
[1:05:33] Mother's Day I think it's just so
[1:05:35] perfect uh but here brother brandom says
[1:05:37] mother is so great it says uh you know
[1:05:42] the first one that receives you uh uh
[1:05:46] this life is your mother no one can
[1:05:49] touch you because you're conceived and
[1:05:52] she Bears you under her heart and she is
[1:05:55] the first to know you praise the Lord uh
[1:05:58] and the first to in this life to hold
[1:06:01] you then when you're born she's one of
[1:06:04] the first hands that touch you and wipes
[1:06:07] back the tears out of your eye she's the
[1:06:09] first one to Pat you and to love you and
[1:06:13] to
[1:06:14] cool over you amen and I want to tell
[1:06:17] you something I don't care how old you
[1:06:19] get your mama going to continue to
[1:06:22] cool over you little little boys when
[1:06:26] they being dropped off the school by
[1:06:28] mama and they don't want mama to give
[1:06:31] them that kiss in front of everybody you
[1:06:34] got to understand it's just Mama
[1:06:37] coing over you and and and one day
[1:06:40] you're going to want Mama's kiss so you
[1:06:43] might as well enjoy it now don't wipe it
[1:06:45] off your face and things like that just
[1:06:47] enjoy mama let Mama cool over
[1:06:53] you Hallelujah amen says uh she's the
[1:06:56] first one uh to to Pat you and to love
[1:06:59] you and to coup over you in this life is
[1:07:02] your mother now I think that there's not
[1:07:05] enough honor that we could give to a
[1:07:09] mother praise the Lord amen it says
[1:07:12] mother is the first with the child and
[1:07:15] she has she's a great responsibility to
[1:07:18] what that child will be and brother
[1:07:21] brother brother Solomon was just kind of
[1:07:22] talking about that in the scripture that
[1:07:23] he read how those mothers were
[1:07:25] worshiping amen uh with the the the
[1:07:28] flagging of the you know waving the the
[1:07:30] the palm branches and everything and and
[1:07:32] and and their kids ended up in church
[1:07:34] because mama was going to church right
[1:07:37] Mama Mama is the first one uh with the
[1:07:40] child she has a great responsibility of
[1:07:42] what that child will be will be based
[1:07:45] upon the way that mother starts that
[1:07:48] child on the path that it must travel
[1:07:51] look mother has the responsibility from
[1:07:54] God to place that child on the right
[1:07:57] Road and I think that's why mother has a
[1:08:00] special little touch now it's Mama's
[1:08:02] responsibility to place them on the
[1:08:04] right road but it's it's it's it's it's
[1:08:07] um you know I think uh I think we all
[1:08:09] realize that even though we place our
[1:08:11] kids on the right Road they don't always
[1:08:13] follow the right Road hallelujah amen
[1:08:16] but the promise of the word of God says
[1:08:19] that if we train up a child in the way
[1:08:22] that they shall go amen when get old
[1:08:26] they will not depart so at some point in
[1:08:29] time you got to realize if I've done
[1:08:31] what God has asked me to do then I'm
[1:08:33] going to
[1:08:34] rejoice in time to come yes sir amen
[1:08:38] amen glory to God here are a few

[1:19:06] clothes walking along you know there's
[1:19:09] something about it you can pass right by

[1:19:42] he says he got this great job making
[1:19:44] really really good money you know on the
[1:19:46] job and uh but for some reason they keep
[1:19:49] coming to him asking him to apply for
[1:19:51] other jobs and he you know and he's like
[1:19:53] uh these other jobs pay a lot more than
[1:19:55] what I'm making but I don't really need
[1:19:57] a lot more I'm I'm I'm good where I'm at
[1:19:59] and it says I'm I'm going through my
[1:20:01] mind and just trying to make sure it's
[1:20:02] not me and my flesh getting in in in
[1:20:04] into this and I just want to make sure

[1:27:59] there be careful here preacher I say
[1:28:01] that these things on this Earth that's
[1:28:03] called Beautiful is absolutely of the
[1:28:05] devil I'll prove it to you then in the
[1:28:08] light of this remark let's search God's
[1:28:10] holy world word to see it it's see if
[1:28:13] it's right or not some of you women
[1:28:15] wants to be so pretty see where it comes
[1:28:17] from in the beginning we find that Satan
[1:28:19] was so beautiful till he deceived angels
[1:28:23] and he was the most beautiful angel of
[1:28:25] all of them showed it lays in the devil
[1:28:29] praise God you know and same thing
[1:28:31] happened with with Absalon how he uh
[1:28:34] swayed the hearts of the people because
[1:28:36] he had this long hair beauty this this
[1:28:38] fellow was all about beauty right but
[1:28:40] that thing was that was very
[1:28:43] deceitful look at it it say and he was
[1:28:45] the most beautiful angel of all them
[1:28:46] showed it La in the devil Proverbs said
[1:28:48] Solomon said beauty is vain that's right
[1:28:51] sin is beautiful certainly it is it uh
[1:28:54] it it it is it's attractive so we don't
[1:28:56] want to go after Beauty we want to go
[1:28:59] after character the scripture said that
[1:29:01] a woman that fears the Lord is worthy to
[1:29:04] be praised I always have to take a
[1:29:07] moment Amen in these Mother's Day sermon
[1:29:10] to give credit uh to my mother amen who
[1:29:14] taught me the things of
[1:29:16] God uh mama was uh mama was uh the
[1:29:21] Christian in the house when rest of us
[1:29:23] weren't Christians
[1:29:25] my daddy wasn't serving the lord uh but
[1:29:28] I I know my daddy knew some things he
[1:29:30] knew not to get on Mama's bad side so uh
[1:29:33] certain things that that that that
[1:29:35] events that we wanted to go to and and
[1:29:37] we would we would you know we we were
[1:29:39] kids too we played our parents against
[1:29:40] each other and we know Daddy would let
[1:29:42] us do certain things we went to Daddy
[1:29:44] but daddy always had this this response
[1:29:47] go ask your
[1:29:50] mama daddy now you know what the answer
[1:29:52] going to be and he know that we know
[1:29:54] what the answer going to be so he just
[1:29:55] want to put it all on Mama right and
[1:29:58] when Mama have to put her foot down and
[1:29:59] say no I don't feel led that y'all
[1:30:01] should be a part of nothing like that
[1:30:04] nothing we can do right but I have to
[1:30:06] give credit to Mama who taught us the
[1:30:08] things of God uh she encouraged me to
[1:30:11] read The Book of Proverbs as a young man
[1:30:13] and and much of what I read helped shape
[1:30:16] the decisions that I made in my life
[1:30:18] amen as I read through Proverbs so from
[1:30:20] what my mama taught me I teach that to
[1:30:22] every young man read the Book of
[1:30:24] Proverbs read The Book of Proverbs just
[1:30:26] keep going over every day if you new to
[1:30:29] the Bible and a new Christian and trying
[1:30:31] to trying to understand the Bible just
[1:30:33] start in the Book of Proverbs start in
[1:30:35] the book of Psalms just start there and
[1:30:37] then go to the the the first four
[1:30:38] gospels to learn about the life of Jesus
[1:30:41] but you'll get wisdom from this book
[1:30:44] right uh Mama's correction and teaching
[1:30:46] kept me out of jail and off the streets
[1:30:48] I thank God for that uh she even
[1:30:50] discouraged me from going into the
[1:30:52] military m set me up I had no idea I I
[1:30:57] went to uh church one night and I was
[1:30:59] doing fine but I I thought to myself say
[1:31:01] I'm going to the military I'm getting
[1:31:03] I'm just I'm just getting away I'm just
[1:31:04] getting away and um and and mama said no
[1:31:07] please don't go in the military that's
[1:31:09] not a life for you see my mom was a
[1:31:12] marine my mom served in the Marines and
[1:31:16] and so she had already gone through what
[1:31:18] was happening there she like that ain't
[1:31:19] a life for you I I wouldn't want you to
[1:31:21] go through that and she even told I feel
[1:31:23] like God got something else for you to
[1:31:25] do in life but don't go to the military
[1:31:27] and I was you know just a young man I
[1:31:29] said n mama don't really know I mean for
[1:31:31] a woman I can understand might not be
[1:31:32] for her but I'm a man the military is
[1:31:35] for me you know and uh so one one night
[1:31:37] I go to church and when I get there my
[1:31:39] pastor you know I knew I had done
[1:31:41] nothing wrong but my pastor say I like
[1:31:42] to see you after church I'm like you
[1:31:44] want to see me what you need to see me
[1:31:46] for y'all know how y'all do when I say I
[1:31:48] need to see you
[1:31:54] but I said I ain't doing nothing wrong
[1:31:55] so I walked into the office and the
[1:31:56] Pastor said you know your mama told me
[1:31:58] that you was thinking about going to the
[1:31:59] military and I said yeah yeah yeah I'll
[1:32:02] be going I'm going down to sign the
[1:32:03] papers I'm going to do this and I'm
[1:32:04] going to do that yeah I'll be going and
[1:32:06] uh he said you sure about this yeah yeah
[1:32:08] yeah yeah my uncles have served and this
[1:32:09] when Serv and I want to I want to be in
[1:32:11] the military and he asked me one
[1:32:13] question that I could not answer he
[1:32:16] simply asked me says have you prayed
[1:32:18] about it and when he said that I
[1:32:24] honestly I haven't prayed for about it
[1:32:26] this is my decision right I haven't
[1:32:29] prayed to ask God if that's his decision
[1:32:31] for me and when he said that that stuck
[1:32:34] with me and I realized that I had not
[1:32:36] prayed about it and God had not given me
[1:32:38] an okay so you know what I did I didn't
[1:32:40] go to the military but I found myself in
[1:32:43] another army yes
[1:32:46] sir a army greater than the US Army
[1:32:51] praise the Lord a air force greater than
[1:32:53] the US Air Force for and I'm flying with
[1:32:55] some
[1:32:59] [Applause]
[1:33:01] Eagles my mom remained committed to
[1:33:03] praying for her family even while we
[1:33:05] were walking
[1:33:08] contrary one other things about my mom I
[1:33:10] I have to give credit to she was
[1:33:12] searching for truth spiritually and
[1:33:15] eventually found something that
[1:33:18] stabilize her family my mama was the one
[1:33:21] the first one to come to this message
[1:33:23] and our family and by mama coming to
[1:33:26] this message uh it actually helped all
[1:33:29] of us and everyone of her children has
[1:33:33] been exposed to this message they might
[1:33:34] not be living it but they know what
[1:33:37] truth
[1:33:38] is and and my brother would be the first
[1:33:41] one to tell you that even when i w
[1:33:42] living it you you couldn't get me to uh
[1:33:47] he he would tell it they say you you
[1:33:48] know people would invite me to the to to
[1:33:50] denomination churches says but to ask me
[1:33:53] to join the Church look I know I ain't
[1:33:55] living right but this is one thing I
[1:33:57] will not do I know that this is not the
[1:34:00] where the place I'm supposed if I'm
[1:34:01] going to go to church I know where to go
[1:34:03] back to is because these things were
[1:34:06] instilled by a Godly example that we had
[1:34:09] in front of
[1:34:10] us I also say this about Mom she's
[1:34:13] always been a source of love for all of
[1:34:15] her
[1:34:16] children
[1:34:18] grandchildren and now even her great
[1:34:20] grands I just watched Mama how you know
[1:34:23] so this event pop up in this child's
[1:34:25] life Mama there this event pop in this
[1:34:28] child's life Mama there and she's always
[1:34:31] making sacrifices to be wherever she
[1:34:33] need to be for her children for her
[1:34:37] grandchildren for her great grands I
[1:34:40] mean just recently we had this trip
[1:34:42] planned to go to England and and mama
[1:34:43] was all set to go but when her
[1:34:46] daughter when her daughter you know had
[1:34:49] this little uh situation Mama canceled
[1:34:51] all that say I know where I need to be
[1:34:54] and she'd already had the time off so
[1:34:55] it's very easy of her to be at the
[1:34:57] hospital with her daughter while she had
[1:34:58] the time off see these are the
[1:35:00] sacrifices that a mom
[1:35:03] makes amen
[1:35:06] amen the Bible said in Proverbs 31:25
[1:35:09] strengthen honor of her clothing and she
[1:35:11] shall rejoice in time to come rejoice in
[1:35:16] the in the dictionary says is to feel or
[1:35:18] show Great Joy or Delight oh m i I know
[1:35:22] that many of y'all have had some very
[1:35:24] sad days some hard days but there's a
[1:35:27] Time coming where you're going to show
[1:35:28] Great Joy or Delight amen uh there's
[1:35:32] there's different mothers here in the
[1:35:34] scripture that we can look at that had
[1:35:36] some situations amen where they showed
[1:35:39] great joy and Delight let's look at amen
[1:35:41] 1st Samuel chapter

[1:39:29] she's having a child and again not just
[1:39:32] a child God gives her a prophet God
[1:39:36] knows how to double amen your uh he he
[1:39:39] knows how to double the blessings when
[1:39:40] you've been going through things amen oh

[1:39:51] make it makes it worth everything you
[1:39:52] went through when God doubles it up like
[1:39:54] that but Elizabeth got uh uh got got
[1:39:57] pregnant and but here's the problem in
[1:39:59] in uh El Elizabeth's pregnancy during
[1:40:01] the pregnancy John stopped doing the
[1:40:04] things that he was supposed to be doing
[1:40:06] glory to God but when she heard from
[1:40:08] Mary praise God and Mary just began to
[1:40:11] tell her that I've been visited by an
[1:40:13] Angel and and the angel told me that I'm
[1:40:15] going to have a child said well so you
[1:40:16] and you and Joseph got got married said
[1:40:19] no we ain't married yet well how you
[1:40:21] going to have this baby with the angel
[1:40:22] say the Holy Ghost going to overshadow
[1:40:24] me and I'm going to have a I'm going to
[1:40:25] have a child and not only and and you
[1:40:27] can imagine maybe Elizabeth having a
[1:40:29] hard time believing Mary story

[1:40:34] angel also told me that you were
[1:40:35] pregnant well how you know that I've
[1:40:37] been in hiding all this time how you

[1:40:40] would pray and the angel also told me
[1:40:41] something else you going to call your
[1:40:43] son Jesus and when Elizabeth heard that
[1:40:46] she said wait a minute now I couldn't
[1:40:49] believe everything you said but but I
[1:40:51] believe this because when you said the

[1:47:10] go to First Kings
[1:47:12] 17
[1:47:16] Hallelujah she shall
[1:47:19] rejoice in time to come
[1:47:22] First Kings 17 and I want to start at
[1:47:25] verse
[1:47:31] 17 the Bible
[1:47:34] declares and it came to
[1:47:37] pass after these
[1:47:40] things now I I I I always have to stop
[1:47:44] when I see you know the the the phrase
[1:47:47] after these things after what things
[1:47:50] what happened before this and what
[1:47:52] happened happened before this was there
[1:47:54] was a
[1:47:55] mother who
[1:47:57] had one
[1:47:59] child and uh when she had this child
[1:48:02] this this mother also lost her husband
[1:48:04] so she was a a widowed woman and uh when
[1:48:07] she lost her her her husband there was a
[1:48:10] famine in the land they were uh they
[1:48:13] were running out of food they were
[1:48:14] running out of everything and um and it
[1:48:18] just so happened she had no idea that
[1:48:20] God had told a prophet to come to her
[1:48:22] house and that in her house God God told
[1:48:26] the prophet I have sustained her to be
[1:48:29] able to take care of you now this lady
[1:48:31] didn't have nothing to take care of the
[1:48:32] Prophet with so when the prophet shows
[1:48:34] up said would you mind fetching me some
[1:48:36] water and she said now I think we can
[1:48:38] get that so she went looking for some
[1:48:39] water and she said now and and on your
[1:48:42] and by the way as you're going to get
[1:48:44] the water would you do me a favor yes
[1:48:47] sir would you bake me a cake first she
[1:48:51] say wait a minute now hold on hold on
[1:48:53] hold on the water was no problem but I'm
[1:48:55] going to have to speak up now because uh
[1:48:58] I'm I'm getting ready to to to to bake
[1:49:01] my last cake and me and my son are going
[1:49:03] to eat this cake and then we're going to
[1:49:05] die because we have nothing else left
[1:49:08] after we eat this cake we know that
[1:49:10] death will be waiting for us so so let
[1:49:12] us just enjoy our last meal and the
[1:49:15] prophet say I understand that you're
[1:49:16] going to bake amen your son a cake and
[1:49:19] you all are preparing for it say but but
[1:49:20] if you don't mind just bake me a cake
[1:49:23] first just bake me a little bit first
[1:49:26] and and and and and and and and and and
[1:49:28] the lady something struck her heart and
[1:49:30] she said I she didn't know whether it's
[1:49:32] a man of God or not but she said you
[1:49:34] know I'mma just be obedient I'mma bake
[1:49:35] this man a cake first and she went and
[1:49:38] she baked the cake first and and praise
[1:49:41] God when she brought it to the prophet
[1:49:42] she went back Hallelujah and there was
[1:49:45] some more oil amen and there was some
[1:49:47] more meal for her to bake another cake
[1:49:50] and every time she turned around and go
[1:49:53] that spot where the meal and the oil was
[1:49:55] amen she went back and there was enough
[1:49:57] to bake another cake and there was
[1:49:58] enough to bake another cake I'm not sure
[1:50:00] if God just had an overflowing but
[1:50:03] sometime the way God do things he do
[1:50:05] things he just meets your need as you
[1:50:08] have need of it hallu Hallelujah but in
[1:50:11] her obedience she got a cake and and she
[1:50:14] got sustained through a famine because
[1:50:17] she obeyed the prophet's voice amen she
[1:50:22] rejoiced
[1:50:24] in time to
[1:50:25] come but here the Bible says and it came
[1:50:29] to pass after these
[1:50:34] things that the son of the woman the
[1:50:36] Mistress of the house fell
[1:50:38] sick and there was no breath left in
[1:50:42] him now I was as you think about this
[1:50:45] this woman had already been obedient to
[1:50:47] the Lord and providing the prophet the
[1:50:50] the cake and God sustain her she said
[1:50:52] say we going to die after we eat this
[1:50:54] cake but God sustained them and now we
[1:50:56] find later on that this boy actually
[1:50:58] ends up dying now look at
[1:51:01] this she said unto Elijah what what have
[1:51:05] I to do with thee Oh thou man of God Art
[1:51:10] Thou come unto me to call my sin to
[1:51:12] remembrance and to slay my
[1:51:16] son it says and he said unto her give me
[1:51:19] thy
[1:51:19] son and and oh my and he took him out of
[1:51:23] her bosom and carried him up into a loft
[1:51:26] where he where he Abode and laid him
[1:51:29] upon his own bed and he cried unto the
[1:51:31] Lord and said oh Lord my God hast thou
[1:51:33] also brought evil upon uh the Widow with
[1:51:37] whom I sojourn by slaying her son and he
[1:51:40] stressed himself upon the child three
[1:51:42] times and Cried unto the Lord and said
[1:51:45] oh Lord my God I pray thee let this
[1:51:46] child's Soul come into him
[1:51:50] again and the Lord heard the voice of
[1:51:53] Elijah and the soul of the child came uh
[1:51:56] into him again and he revived and Elijah
[1:51:59] took the child and brought him down out
[1:52:01] of the chamber into the house and
[1:52:03] delivered him into his mother and Elijah
[1:52:05] said see thy son liveth and the woman
[1:52:09] said to Elijah now by this I know that
[1:52:11] thou art a man of God and that the word
[1:52:14] of the Lord in thy mouth is truth this
[1:52:19] woman rejoiced in time to to come after
[1:52:23] her son was struck dead amen uh she
[1:52:27] rejoiced she rejoiced the first time
[1:52:29] because she she was sustained through a
[1:52:31] famine but now she rejoices again

[1:52:35] from the dead amen I want to say

[2:16:15] her and I want you to notice this is my
[2:16:18] one of my favorite statements that

[2:16:21] mother would not be
[2:16:24] complete there without her family it's
[2:16:29] going to be hard for you to Rejoice over
[2:16:30] there if your family's not there with
[2:16:33] you so I'm here to tell you God going to
[2:16:36] somehow some way unravel these
[2:16:39] knots and you're going to rejoice in
[2:16:43] time to come mother would not be
[2:16:45] complete there without a family cuz the
[2:16:47] greatest time of all her life is to see
[2:16:50] the children
[2:16:51] around the table and all of them healthy
[2:16:55] and happy and to see her pour the coffee
[2:16:58] or whatever she does and fixes up and
[2:17:00] her dad sat down and what's the happiest
[2:17:03] time in Mama's life see her kitties all

[2:17:09] home I I I watch my wife anytime she
[2:17:13] just get with all her kitties in the
[2:17:16] same little spot it just does something

[2:17:23] you miss them you miss them you you miss
[2:17:24] those things but when they all get back
[2:17:26] together it shows that you know you

[2:17:30] just this this Earthly Gathering but
[2:17:33] there's a Heavenly Gathering that we're
[2:17:34] going to someday mama won't be complete
