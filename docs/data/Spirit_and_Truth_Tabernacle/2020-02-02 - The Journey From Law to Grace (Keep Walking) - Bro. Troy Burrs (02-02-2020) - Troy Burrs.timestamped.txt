[41:16] wickedness is at its peak
[41:18] a man but he gave us something he gave
[41:21] us his own life law that we can
[41:24] withstand in his own praise Lord sister
[41:27] Rachel
[41:34] ss you I did not come to church planning
[41:41] to sing brother Solomon asked me to sing
[41:44] this song and I think it's very fitting
[41:46] with sister Rebecca's special because
[41:49] you have to think of who coined that
[41:51] phrase in a way I know my redeemer lives
[41:53] and what Joe was going through he was
[41:56] going through the very worst time of his
[41:58] life and still he was able to look up
[42:00] through all of it and say I know my
[42:03] redeemer lives and I think it's so
[42:05] important for us to understand that even
[42:06] through hardships God God got our back
[42:09] and everything is gonna be ok so pray
[42:13] for me
[42:19] [Music]
[42:37] you

[42:45] I used to be
[42:50] so broken
[42:53] first empty
[42:59] with no meat a singer with no soul to
[43:08] see
[43:09] [Music]
[43:11] so I know fulfilling silence is
[43:19] deafening
[43:22] but in your pain lies sweeter sound the
[43:30] victory so keep walking and walking and
[43:37] walking
[43:38] no it's Itza
[43:42] [Music]
[43:59] [Music]
[44:08] but you must be me

[50:19] look at each other and say we all got it
[50:21] together but we don't sometimes we
[50:24] really don't it's just comforting to
[50:28] know that there's a God that does
[50:31] there's a common
[50:36] so when I say I was almost out of here I
[50:39] was almost gone and I wanted to die from
[50:43] how I was that's real and I know I'm not
[50:48] the only one that feels like that the

[51:18] pick my life up I thought I had that
[51:20] power but I didn't I tried but I
[51:25] couldn't cuz God's got so much more for
[51:29] me to do he's got so much more my flaws
[51:33] in my trials all that stuff it doesn't
[51:36] matter to me and it doesn't matter to
[51:39] God cuz at the end of the day it gets
[51:41] better and I know he's got so much for
[51:44] me to do so look at yourself and say

[1:09:00] with those sacrifices which they offered
[1:09:04] year by year continually make the comers
[1:09:07] thereunto perfect for then would they
[1:09:12] not have ceased to be offered because
[1:09:16] that the worshipers once purged should
[1:09:20] have had no more conscience of sin but
[1:09:25] in those sacrifices there is a
[1:09:27] remembrance again made of sins every
[1:09:31] year for it is not possible that the
[1:09:36] blood of bulls and goats should take
[1:09:40] away sins wherefore when he cometh into
[1:09:44] this world he says sacrifice and
[1:09:47] offering thou what is not but a body has

[1:10:47] fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind
[1:10:50] whose seed is in itself upon the earth
[1:10:53] and it was so and the earth brought
[1:10:57] forth grass and herb yielding seed after
[1:11:00] its kind and the tree yielding fruit
[1:11:02] whose seed was in itself after its kind
[1:11:06] and the God and God saw that and it was

[1:11:47] the journey from law to grace the
[1:11:53] journey from law to grace and for an
[1:11:58] inspiration or subtext amen I'm gonna
[1:12:04] say keep walking
[1:12:06] amen keep walking
[1:12:11] we know Amen that it was taught to us
[1:12:18] that the spoken word of God is the
[1:12:23] original seed in a beginning
[1:12:27] Amen we start there in Genesis because
[1:12:30] we understand that Genesis is the seed
[1:12:34] chapter God spoke
[1:12:38] let there be let there be
[1:12:41] let there be and there was a man his
[1:12:47] word a man his spoken word a man was the
[1:12:53] see that produced everything we see the
[1:12:58] world was framed by the Word of God Amen
[1:13:03] now now if you notice God said let it
[1:13:08] bring forth of its kind whatever it was
[1:13:12] it must bring forth of its kind amen
[1:13:18] that is a lot everything in nature is
[1:13:25] governed by in law amen
[1:13:31] God is not a fireable person he's not
[1:13:37] like men we can have a good idea one day
[1:13:40] and have a better idea tomorrow we can
[1:13:45] come up with something and we can
[1:13:47] improve on what our thought was or what
[1:13:51] our idea was just by maybe it's studying
[1:13:55] a little bit more or looking into it a
[1:13:57] little bit more but God is God his first
[1:14:03] thought is his best oh and his only
[1:14:08] thought his first way is his only way it
[1:14:12] is perfect so when he established in
[1:14:17] Genesis and he said he went through and
[1:14:23] he framing earth and he set everything
[1:14:28] in order and man that was the way it was
[1:14:34] everything was established the law by
[1:14:39] the Word of God amen
[1:14:43] now we see in the Prophet said in the
[1:14:49] message restoration of the bride tree
[1:14:51] that we see the fish have a law the fish
[1:14:56] amen
[1:14:58] he has a law he can he can live
[1:15:02] the water I would like to see you try to
[1:15:07] do it because that law is not in you
[1:15:11] there's a law of the birds a man that he
[1:15:16] can he's an earthbound creature but he
[1:15:20] can lift his wings a certain way and so
[1:15:24] in the heavenlies amen
[1:15:26] his whole entire makeup was designed in
[1:15:32] order for him to carry out that law amen
[1:15:38] he has the ability in him to defy
[1:15:42] gravity amen
[1:15:46] that was the way God made him amen he
[1:15:49] has a law a man that he could fly man
[1:15:55] try to copy it and sometimes we don't
[1:15:59] quite succeed amen but uh we see a man
[1:16:06] just like I said but gravity is a law so
[1:16:10] everything in nature everything is
[1:16:13] controlled by a law it has the goal a
[1:16:18] certain way in order to get to a certain
[1:16:21] place that's just the law of God amen
[1:16:25] the law of Christ the law of man is you
[1:16:30] can bury him amen in the deepest grave
[1:16:34] and in the deepest sea and in the lowest
[1:16:38] hail the law of the Spirit of God is
[1:16:42] that he'll raise the game Bible says if
[1:16:48] that same spirit dwells in you that it
[1:16:52] will quicken your mortal body amen
[1:16:55] to raise from the grave
[1:16:58] but amen we see that in the beginning
[1:17:03] the Prophet was talking about there in
[1:17:05] the message why some people can't keep
[1:17:09] victory and he was talking about in
[1:17:11] there he said the holy spirit any man
[1:17:16] when the earth was void and without for
[1:17:19] a man that was see laying there because
[1:17:26] God's spoken word is a scene so we don't
[1:17:33] know when he said let there be and let
[1:17:36] there be the manifestation of what he
[1:17:41] said didn't appear right away but the
[1:17:45] seed was there and in that scene was the
[1:17:51] potential amen
[1:17:53] for it to manifest itself it's appointed
[1:17:57] time
[1:17:59] hey man everything was set in order
[1:18:03] it had to be placed in its right
[1:18:07] condition and then everything had to go
[1:18:12] according to his perfect timepiece a man
[1:18:18] if something would have came out of
[1:18:19] order it would have threw everything in
[1:18:21] the chaos that is a trick of the devil
[1:18:26] to try and get us to move ahead of God
[1:18:30] that's the mistake that Eve me she moved
[1:18:34] ahead of God and and God was going to
[1:18:40] give them a child it was going to happen
[1:18:45] his way and in his time but Eve got a
[1:18:52] little excited
[1:18:53] and she didn't wait oh God
[1:18:56] she went another way and see she defied
[1:19:02] the look amen
[1:19:07] how you wit me I want you to see here
[1:19:11] the prophets say it the Holy Spirit came
[1:19:18] down when the earth was formed without
[1:19:20] forward and brood and cooling over the
[1:19:25] earth in another place he said that the
[1:19:29] Holy Spirit and the earth got to know
[1:19:33] one another
[1:19:34] read between the lines he said and it
[1:19:38] brought forth it was the German ization
[1:19:42] of the seed that was already laying
[1:19:45] there
[1:19:46] amen and he said that out of the dust
[1:19:53] came to burn and all of a sudden out of
[1:19:58] the dust came the Beast what was it that
[1:20:04] seed that was laying there
[1:20:06] coming into manifestation he said that
[1:20:11] dust came in a man after his image and
[1:20:18] after his likeness a man you wonder how
[1:20:22] Satan got in brother Solomon and I were
[1:20:26] having a little conversation about this
[1:20:27] and a real wonderful conversation maybe
[1:20:30] we say say everything that uh he said at
[1:20:37] the beginning say this was good this was
[1:20:40] good and this was good and this was good
[1:20:45] but there was one thing that came not
[1:20:49] quite the same way it was a byproduct
[1:20:52] and saved and say oh there's
[1:20:54] my door I can get in right there hey man
[1:21:00] little bitty no God had already made
[1:21:04] preparation hey man he had already
[1:21:09] thought knew see that this would happen
[1:21:13] and he said well I'm gonna make
[1:21:17] preparation before the foundation of the
[1:21:20] earth I'm gonna make temperature now to
[1:21:26] redeem man are you with me
[1:21:29] amen so we see him in the message Christ
[1:21:34] the mystery God revealed
[1:21:35] I'm sorry sirs will we see Jesus now
[1:21:40] when in the beginning was the word and
[1:21:42] the Word was with God in the world was
[1:21:44] God now what is the word the word is a
[1:21:52] thought expressed and made manifest then
[1:21:57] before God did anything he thought it
[1:22:00] and when he drew the plane in his mind
[1:22:06] and then expressed it by the word he
[1:22:12] could never take it back
[1:22:13] it had to be forever be that way it
[1:22:20] can't fail it can't change because God
[1:22:24] is infinite he's omnipresent he's
[1:22:27] omnipotent and infinite surge that
[1:22:33] serves what we see Jesus 5701 Oh for I
[1:22:38] thought I wrote it down this system amen
[1:22:43] let me go on if he was if he's infinite
[1:22:48] if he only present an impotent he is if
[1:22:56] he wasn't this way then he isn't God and
[1:23:00] if he is infinite at the beginning
[1:23:03] before the world was
[1:23:06] ever form he knew the end from the
[1:23:09] beginning he knew every flea he knew
[1:23:12] every fly he knew everything that he
[1:23:16] knew every person everything that would
[1:23:19] ever happen he knew just exactly what it
[1:23:23] was before the world began
[1:23:26] he's infinite so he by being that way
[1:23:32] could predestinate or for all day even
[1:23:36] for the wrath of his enemies to praise
[1:23:40] him even for the rest of his enemies to
[1:23:46] praise Him amen
[1:23:49] now we see we see that we were a thought
[1:23:54] in the mind of God so we were in a place
[1:23:57] any man that's a wonderful place to be
[1:24:02] in in God's thoughts in his mind but
[1:24:09] then when he came in and the seed farm
[1:24:11] in Genesis and we when we were day in a
[1:24:15] perfect place but what happened we fell
[1:24:20] from grace is that right now when man
[1:24:25] fell from grace his nature changed amen
[1:24:29] you're born in sin shaded in iniquity
[1:24:32] coming to the world speaking lies and
[1:24:35] there's not one good sound part about
[1:24:40] anybody so who are you anyhow who are
[1:24:45] you anyhow what are you you are about 84
[1:24:51] cents of dirt
[1:24:54] that's all about 84 good singer a man
[1:25:01] however you have a soul that's worth
[1:25:05] 10,000 words God so loved the world that
[1:25:11] He gave His only begotten Son that
[1:25:14] whosoever believeth him can have eternal
[1:25:19] life God could not change his law law
[1:25:25] required a penalty a man in that penalty
[1:25:29] was death law required judgment amen the
[1:25:38] 12th chapter of st. John the 17th verse
[1:25:42] 8 verily I say unto you except a corn of
[1:25:45] wheat fall into the ground and die it
[1:25:48] abideth alone but if it die it brings
[1:25:53] forth much fruit he that loveth his life
[1:25:58] shall lose it and he that hated his life
[1:26:03] I want you to prepare attention today
[1:26:06] he hated his life in this world shall
[1:26:13] keep it unto life eternal
[1:26:17] amen I heard the testimony this morning
[1:26:23] of the sister was saying that she felt
[1:26:27] like a man just giving up a man that's a
[1:26:33] good place to be to give up to your own
[1:26:40] will give up to your own way and man I
[1:26:47] just let God take complete control
[1:26:50] Amen sometime God allow us to get to
[1:26:54] that position to call on his name Amen
[1:27:00] we look at the children of Israel they
[1:27:04] they want found themselves
[1:27:06] Amen in a journey that they went to
[1:27:10] Joseph there was a famine in the land
[1:27:14] God had made preparation for their
[1:27:20] salvation and you give me some water
[1:27:25] brother God had made preparation for
[1:27:29] their salvation there under Joseph a man
[1:27:33] but before I go into that story I want
[1:27:36] you to see in the message Melchizedek
[1:27:41] the Prophet said this he says now see
[1:27:44] here plainly that the complete secret of
[1:27:48] our lives in journey and death is where
[1:27:52] we go after we die where we go out to be
[1:27:56] done amen thank you there there are
[1:28:02] stages to your eternal purpose he had in
[1:28:07] his secret now has been revealed did you
[1:28:13] catch what I'm saying let me let me let
[1:28:14] me back up and I might have put some
[1:28:17] thanks too close together there are
[1:28:20] stages to your eternal purpose this was
[1:28:24] a secret that is now revealed that is
[1:28:29] now revealed amen there are three stages
[1:28:32] a man that we must that we must go
[1:28:35] through now in that same message with no
[1:28:39] further on in the in the in the text F
[1:28:41] the Prophet said now Abraham's journey
[1:28:44] he met God along the way in different
[1:28:46] forms and so forth which he could take
[1:28:49] it and show it just we are Abraham see
[1:28:55] if we're in Christ so he stopped that he
[1:29:00] says Isaac was his lesser son he was his
[1:29:07] son sexuality bisexually but spiritually
[1:29:13] Christ was Abraham see
[1:29:17] his royal see his faith now we find that
[1:29:23] his royal seat it is travels the same
[1:29:27] journey his Bride of Christ travels the
[1:29:32] same journey and I want to speak to you
[1:29:36] this morning that we must travel the
[1:29:39] same journey a man bear with me you must
[1:29:44] travel the same journey a man as the
[1:29:48] sister song the song just keep walking
[1:29:51] amen other problem is in order to keep
[1:29:56] walking you have to start walking a man
[1:30:03] so now during the time of Joseph we see
[1:30:08] the church original has failed some
[1:30:09] grace and when their roles of Pharaoh
[1:30:14] that knew not Joseph what happened they
[1:30:17] went through four hundred years of dark
[1:30:20] ages they made four hundred years of
[1:30:23] trouble a man but you see God had
[1:30:27] promised them a land that was floor with
[1:30:31] milk and honey what happened to the
[1:30:33] children of Israel they found themselves
[1:30:35] in a good place there there was plenty
[1:30:38] of food to eat
[1:30:39] amen Joseph or was a store doctor the
[1:30:44] granite stumbles down with all with the
[1:30:47] grain in and everywhere else was in
[1:30:49] family I'm not you know what they was
[1:30:51] living pretty good
[1:30:53] the Egyptians gave them jobs they had
[1:30:56] good jobs they was working a man and
[1:30:59] everything was good it was in a good
[1:31:01] place step probably you know had you
[1:31:03] know come home every night to a warm
[1:31:05] meal and things of that nature it
[1:31:08] started off it was pretty good but see
[1:31:12] God had told them promised him a land
[1:31:16] that was flowing with milk and honey
[1:31:18] Egypt one memory
[1:31:21] but they like the cat hold my god they
[1:31:25] like the cares and comfortable with the
[1:31:29] riches of Egypt they got comfortable
[1:31:32] with the provisions that was in Egypt
[1:31:36] they forget all about they they were
[1:31:38] supposed to be looking for a city like
[1:31:41] their father Abraham
[1:31:44] they stayed during Egypt and see God had
[1:31:47] to let some things go a little salad
[1:31:52] some time when when when your a job just
[1:31:55] I had a situation like that my wife can
[1:31:57] attest I was comfortable on my job but
[1:32:07] slowly and surely I would come home oh I
[1:32:10] got the best job in the world
[1:32:12] oh we had another pot look all these
[1:32:16] people so nice when my father-in-law
[1:32:19] passed they took it offering in the
[1:32:22] office to give to my wife I said I mean
[1:32:27] and things was just going great but all
[1:32:30] of a sudden they brought in another
[1:32:33] supervisor they rolled the Pharaoh who
[1:32:37] do not chose oh here we go
[1:32:44] things started changing and started
[1:32:48] changing and so you know being a kind of
[1:32:53] person I am I can yeah I'm good work out
[1:32:57] tough guy get through this
[1:32:58] little did I know to know God was trying
[1:33:02] to tell me something get me it's time to
[1:33:05] move but I was comfortable a man
[1:33:11] the project was saying how precious lot
[1:33:18] chose the the bright lights inside and
[1:33:23] they got down there and they got
[1:33:26] comfortable
[1:33:28] hey man if Locke had his day of grace
[1:33:35] when those angels came down and say
[1:33:38] light you gotta go it's time to get out
[1:33:42] of here this thing is fitting to be
[1:33:44] destroyed the ceiling has reached it now
[1:33:48] he's finished let's go well I've had a
[1:33:51] choice to me if his heart was still
[1:33:56] dancing oh I'm good here he would have
[1:34:00] perished but he chose to follow the
[1:34:06] leading of the Lord through an angel a
[1:34:09] man that came to him
[1:34:12] amen and so that's to go it's time you
[1:34:17] can't wait any longer
[1:34:19] grab your children grab your wife let's
[1:34:23] go it's time to move on it's time to
[1:34:29] move on Amen I believe that's where
[1:34:32] we're at today you can certainly draw a
[1:34:35] comparison but we see the children
[1:34:39] vigilant got comfortable leaving Japan
[1:34:41] and things that slowly got worse and
[1:34:43] they and they had to go through some
[1:34:45] persecution but uh we see when things
[1:34:52] like that come in our lives as long as
[1:34:56] everything is good we're comfortable we
[1:35:00] won't pray hey man we won't seek the
[1:35:02] Lord amen we begin to put our trust in
[1:35:06] man we begin to put our trust in our
[1:35:10] paychecks when we're supposed to put our
[1:35:12] trust in God but God had to make things
[1:35:16] uncomfortable mm amen and along there
[1:35:23] come a baby
[1:35:25] born named Moses and then what was that
[1:35:29] my brothers and sisters God was making
[1:35:32] preparations God was making preparation
[1:35:36] you see when a baby is born when a baby
[1:35:42] is born its mother and its father make
[1:35:46] preparation for that baby's arrival amen
[1:35:52] they go out and buy a crib they maybe
[1:35:57] prepare a room
[1:36:00] my wife had a whole room full of Pampers
[1:36:03] already just turned up from the floor to
[1:36:06] the ceiling we got to never buy no fan
[1:36:08] for all to eat bamboo so we made
[1:36:12] preparation and see that's what was
[1:36:16] happening here there God that we're
[1:36:17] getting ready to move God was making
[1:36:20] preparation amen for them to take a
[1:36:24] journey he was preparing things while
[1:36:28] they was going through but see he let
[1:36:30] him go through two things had to happen
[1:36:33] one Moses had to come to a place of
[1:36:36] maturity because he we like she came
[1:36:40] lead ourselves he had to come to a place
[1:36:43] to where he was ready to lead people out
[1:36:49] and made but all along God was he had
[1:36:53] this going over here and over here to
[1:36:56] you that the children of either died in
[1:36:57] Goshen he had to wait until they got
[1:37:01] desperate they had to get desperate he
[1:37:05] see because before they was living so
[1:37:07] good they went praying but see after
[1:37:09] things got so difficult than me lives
[1:37:11] the things got so rough in the live then
[1:37:14] beginning the crowd to God send in the
[1:37:17] delivery Lord he's not gonna move until
[1:37:22] you crowd
[1:37:24] until you ask for amen
[1:37:28] but all alone he's making preparations
[1:37:31] he's making preparation a man for you on
[1:37:35] that journey so we see amen
[1:37:39] the children of Israel mine Moses was
[1:37:44] ready raised in the house of Pharaoh and
[1:37:47] educated in the finest schools and we
[1:37:50] see it took him 40 years on the desert
[1:37:53] amen to get all of that paint out of him
[1:37:56] amen to a place where he could leave a
[1:37:59] man the message there was a question and
[1:38:02] answer the prophets saying cranium is a
[1:38:04] type of the Holy Ghost Egypt is the
[1:38:09] world and they come out of the
[1:38:12] wilderness is where they were sanctified
[1:38:15] called out church can is where they
[1:38:19] settle down with the Holy Spirit cause
[1:38:23] they still had wars if you don't believe
[1:38:26] it you just if you don't believe it
[1:38:30] you have Wars just get the holy spirit
[1:38:34] once amen we can attest to that they
[1:38:41] still had wars so know what we getting
[1:38:44] is even after you get the Holy Spirit
[1:38:46] amen
[1:38:46] you're gonna have to fight I heard a
[1:38:49] preacher say one thing about a Christian
[1:38:51] a man you better learn to fight and
[1:38:54] enjoy it because you are gonna fight
[1:38:57] until you get out of here amen because
[1:39:00] the devil is not gonna give up but you
[1:39:02] know what
[1:39:03] he ain't nothing but a palmer worm
[1:39:08] that's all he ain't nothing but a pommel
[1:39:11] worm amen so in the message of paradox
[1:39:16] 1965 a man Joshua here the Prophet said
[1:39:24] Joshua here's a book actually of
[1:39:27] the book of redemption of the Old
[1:39:29] Testament Joshua we would have to
[1:39:35] consider it to be a
[1:39:38] and the Old Testament the book of
[1:39:43] redemption because this redemption have
[1:39:46] two parts amen
[1:39:49] Redemption anywhere has two parts that
[1:39:53] is coming out of and going into it takes
[1:39:57] two parts to make redemption out of and
[1:40:00] into Moses represented the law which
[1:40:04] brought them out of Egypt and whereas
[1:40:08] Joshua represented grace that took them
[1:40:11] into the Promised Land
[1:40:12] another way was love and grace were two
[1:40:16] different aspects of God's command amen
[1:40:19] now the law brought them out Moses and
[1:40:22] Joshua took them in it also represents
[1:40:28] something for our day now it represents
[1:40:31] as they were in the journey coming from
[1:40:35] Egypt into the Promised Land so have we
[1:40:40] come out of the world a man a vision of
[1:40:45] chaos on our road to the promised land
[1:40:50] in my father's house there are many
[1:40:53] mansions if it was not so I would have
[1:40:56] told you coming out of going into it's
[1:41:01] law that bring us to recognize that
[1:41:04] we're wrong but it's grace that forgives
[1:41:07] us the law has no hope of redemption
[1:41:11] because our aunts who completed it it
[1:41:18] has no grace in it because lo only
[1:41:22] points this to the two that you are a
[1:41:25] sinner but grace tells you how to get
[1:41:29] out of it law is the policeman that puts
[1:41:33] you in jail but redemption is the one
[1:41:36] who come and paid your fine to out they
[1:41:40] paid your fine and out of and into and
[1:41:43] integrase so I want you to understand my
[1:41:47] brothers and sisters
[1:41:49] you don't just have grace grace is there
[1:41:55] waiting for you to claim it grace is
[1:41:59] there you have to come through the law
[1:42:02] you have to recognize the law to get to
[1:42:07] grace amen my god grace is there but you
[1:42:13] have to clean your grace if you reject
[1:42:19] your day of grace there's nothing left
[1:42:22] but judgment if not had it rejected his
[1:42:28] day of grace there was nothing left for
[1:42:32] judgment there's another fella in the
[1:42:36] Bible a man we know him as a young ruler
[1:42:42] for wealthy rich young ruler his day of
[1:42:47] grace had came to him Jesus say it to
[1:42:52] him sell all you have give to the poor
[1:42:55] and come follow me
[1:42:57] come take this journey with me come and
[1:43:02] take I'm the law my word is law
[1:43:07] come follow me to grace he rejected
[1:43:13] grace and found judgment
[1:43:17] amen you have to accept grace when it
[1:43:23] comes to you he is not obligated to keep
[1:43:29] him but his grace and his love will keep
[1:43:34] coming and give you chance after chance
[1:43:37] after chance after chance I heard a
[1:43:42] preacher once said that you have to
[1:43:44] fight to go to hate you have to grace
[1:43:50] comes to you by the law of the word and
[1:43:54] it's up to you to continue to fight with
[1:43:59] the law
[1:44:00] no I don't want it no I don't want grace
[1:44:04] is sitting there Christ God is ordering
[1:44:09] he's making preparation through your
[1:44:12] trials and tribulations and things that
[1:44:16] you're going through he's pushing you
[1:44:18] integrate pushing you into this
[1:44:21] direction he allowed things that get
[1:44:23] difficult in your life so that you were
[1:44:26] recognized that grace is right over
[1:44:28] there but you say no I don't want it why
[1:44:32] because I may have to give up my friends
[1:44:35] I may have to give up the fellowship
[1:44:39] that I have with the people that I
[1:44:42] currently associate with my god and you
[1:44:47] rejected and rejected
[1:44:50] instead of yielding a man we see the law
[1:44:55] Amen of that scene that scene outside of
[1:45:01] the right condition outside of it it's
[1:45:05] the desert and man has a hard shell amen
[1:45:10] in other words it has a stony heart amen
[1:45:15] it has to go into the ground amen and
[1:45:19] under the right condition so the
[1:45:22] children of Israel for 400 years
[1:45:25] any man they was in the right condition
[1:45:28] a man that they could pray amen to find
[1:45:34] God they say what a lot we know that
[1:45:37] this is no way to live they begin to cry
[1:45:40] out to God what God had to put them in
[1:45:44] that position what he had to put them
[1:45:46] into a place of struggle amen
[1:45:49] he had to bury them in Egypt amen and
[1:45:53] then calls amen the water day amen so
[1:45:56] touch each other knowing that see that
[1:45:59] hard shell had to break in order see the
[1:46:04] life it's in the sea amen
[1:46:08] sometimes we plant seeds and we get
[1:46:12] impatient
[1:46:13] well you look check every day well
[1:46:16] nothing's come up yet okay what
[1:46:19] nothing's come up here all right
[1:46:21] nothing's come up yet
[1:46:22] then after Wow well let me check it
[1:46:26] leave it alone if the life isn't that
[1:46:31] see you just put it in the right
[1:46:34] condition and leave it alone if you go
[1:46:39] to messing with it you're getting cards
[1:46:41] wait thank you Jesus sometime you see a
[1:46:46] person going through something leave it
[1:46:49] alone
[1:46:51] don't get in God's weight God know what
[1:46:56] he doing there in that condition God is
[1:47:00] trying to drive them to a condition when
[1:47:04] they get on their knees and cry out to
[1:47:07] God to where they realize that they're
[1:47:10] tired amen of this condition they want
[1:47:14] to press out of the dirt amen this
[1:47:17] condition amen they want to break free
[1:47:20] and they began and then to press out of
[1:47:23] their condition press suitable price to
[1:47:27] the dirt price to the soil
[1:47:29] amen and then they shoot
[1:47:31] and the leaves get suddenly yes oh we
[1:47:36] but the churn is not over
[1:47:38] it's about producing fruit you're just
[1:47:42] beginning the journey I say some haven't
[1:47:46] even begin the journey yet why because
[1:47:51] they won't stay in the right condition
[1:47:53] for birth they keep rejecting grace I'm
[1:48:00] trying to push you into a place where
[1:48:03] you can go free
[1:48:05] you don't know freedom until you
[1:48:09] experience you can be in bondage and
[1:48:13] think you're free and in bondage all
[1:48:17] alone
[1:48:17] you don't know freedom Oh tasted see
[1:48:21] that the Lord is good
[1:48:23] amen let us go on Israel came to a time
[1:48:32] of decision they had to make a decision
[1:48:39] amen to leave Egypt not knowing where
[1:48:44] they were going they didn't know they
[1:48:48] knew the journey was going to be
[1:48:50] difficult some got along the way and
[1:48:54] said well maybe it was better where we
[1:48:57] were after God had vindicated through
[1:49:04] all kinds of signs wonders and miracles
[1:49:08] to free them of the condition that they
[1:49:15] were in they had to steal pick up their
[1:49:19] feet and make footprints grace was in
[1:49:25] Canaan the condition was right down in
[1:49:31] Goshen in Egypt but they had to make a
[1:49:34] choice I'm going to accept this journey
[1:49:38] and receive grace all along the way God
[1:49:43] had already made provisions he took them
[1:49:47] to the Red Sea
[1:49:49] a man performed a miracle they went
[1:49:54] through the Red Sea prophet said it was
[1:49:56] the waters of separation a man
[1:50:00] representing that they went through the

[1:51:35] rights to let go of all of their
[1:51:38] Egyptian ways they had to let go of
[1:51:41] those things a man

[1:52:34] fast you need to let go of the world and

[1:52:42] Word in your heart you got to be taught
[1:52:47] how to do that you don't do it by
[1:52:52] jumping up and down neither do you do it

[1:52:59] surrendered heart to Almighty God amen
[1:53:05] let go amen
[1:53:15] same paragraph 111 their prophecy don't
[1:53:22] condemn the sinner have mercy on him let

[1:53:32] partes that is his pleasure don't blame
[1:53:37] him come home and everything tired and
[1:53:41] worn out he wants some pleasure the
[1:53:44] thing you do is to live such a godly
[1:53:49] life that you can prove to him that the
[1:53:54] gospel holds 10,000 times more for him
[1:54:00] [Music]
[1:54:01] amen now and when he dies in that state
[1:54:07] that he'll go to hell on his liquor on

[1:54:19] is his judge amen because he saw the way
[1:54:25] he solved your life you proved to him
[1:54:31] that there's a better way and he
[1:54:33] rejected his day of grace amen
[1:54:37] he rejected his day of grace he dies
[1:54:42] going out there dancing running around
[1:54:44] with immoral clothes God is his judge
[1:54:50] but there's one thing if you die under
[1:54:54] the anointing power of the Holy Ghost
[1:54:56] like Stephen did when he looked up in
[1:54:59] the face of God I see heaven open and
[1:55:02] Jesus standing at the right hand your
[1:55:04] heaven bow like like a Marten in a box

[2:03:11] to grace our destination
[2:03:14] a man is back to grace I want to hear a
[2:03:19] story a man of a man had two sons and
[2:03:26] the younger son said father give me my
[2:03:32] portion of goods that I may go
[2:03:41] that's he said give me my portion of
[2:03:43] goods that falleth Rumi and he divided
[2:03:46] unto them his livings and not many days
[2:03:50] after the younger son gathered all
[2:03:52] together and took his journey to a far
[2:03:56] country and there wasted his substance
[2:04:00] on riotous living
[2:04:02] see he fell from grace he had everything
[2:04:07] he needed in his father's house but what
[2:04:12] was it he got pulled by the flashing
[2:04:15] lights I'm grown now I can do what I
[2:04:21] want to do see that pommel worm then ate
[2:04:29] down at the tree now change form and now
[2:04:33] you grown and sexy I can do what I want
[2:04:39] to do got a little money in my pocket

[2:04:48] not only can I do what I want to do I
[2:04:51] can go where I want to go see no longer
[2:04:56] was he under the rule of his father he
[2:05:00] was just old enough to step out of the
[2:05:03] rule of his father his father said Oh
[2:05:06] King I'll divide give you an your
[2:05:09] inherited your money he went out and
[2:05:12] don't they do it this oughta turn
[2:05:14] squandered it away on riotous living
[2:05:22] but God began to make preparation and
[2:05:27] women speak all his money their roles
[2:05:32] are mighty famine in the land and he
[2:05:36] began to warn not for food but there was
[2:05:43] a famine for the Word of God and he
[2:05:47] began to once maybe he had sat down of
[2:05:53] the trough of Pentecost sat down at the
[2:05:58] trough of Methodists sat down at the
[2:06:02] trough of Jehovah's Witness and sin
[2:06:08] because he he had experienced good food
[2:06:12] was he had already experienced it and
[2:06:16] now he said my father's servants eaten
[2:06:21] better than this this is garbage but he
[2:06:26] said a hunger man to eat out of a
[2:06:28] garbage can but what happened he went
[2:06:34] and joined themselves and it to a
[2:06:38] citizen of a country and he sent him to
[2:06:41] the fields to feed with the swine and he
[2:06:46] would fain have filled his belly with
[2:06:50] the husk and the swamp that the Swan did
[2:06:53] he and no man gave unto him God making
[2:06:59] preparation and when he had come to
[2:07:02] himself see he came to himself and he
[2:07:06] said how many higher service does my
[2:07:10] father have bread enough to spare and I
[2:07:15] perish with hunger he said I will rise
[2:07:21] and go to my father and will say unto
[2:07:25] him father I have sinned against heaven
[2:07:27] and before thee and AM no more worried
[2:07:31] that you be called son make me as one of
[2:07:35] the heart
[2:07:36] service and he arose and he came to his
[2:07:41] father but when he was yet a great way
[2:07:44] off his father saw him and had
[2:07:48] compassion read to him and fell on his
[2:07:53] neck and kissed him he was glad to see
[2:07:57] him
[2:07:57] I had the father I've been waiting on
[2:08:01] your son I've been praying for you see I
[2:08:06] got this prayer journal and you right
[2:08:09] here you're right here in my prayer
[2:08:13] journal I've been praying for you I know
[2:08:16] you went out there but God was making
[2:08:19] preparations all alone amen but he had
[2:08:24] to come to a decision to arise and make
[2:08:29] the journey back home and make the
[2:08:33] journey back home he recognized a man
[2:08:38] this was no life for him
[2:08:41] that disturb this is what this wasn't
[2:08:43] the life that I'm supposed to be living
[2:08:46] he came to a place of realization that
[2:08:50] why am I going through this way I'm not
[2:08:52] doing this to myself why not killing
[2:08:55] myself why am I doing this
[2:08:57] you know the devil a usual and spit you
[2:09:02] out but God is making preparation making
[2:09:09] preparation for a journey from law to
[2:09:13] grace amen
[2:09:16] so we see Amen the son and then his
[2:09:19] father a man gave him a met a roll say
[2:09:24] when he yeah a great weight loss and he
[2:09:27] saw her and he had compassion ran from
[2:09:29] his fellow his neck in the Sun said unto
[2:09:31] him father I've sinned against heaven
[2:09:34] and in thy sight and I'm no more worried
[2:09:37] that you'd be gone son but the father
[2:09:39] said to his servants bring me his best
[2:09:42] robe and put it over put a ring on his
[2:09:45] head
[2:09:46] shoes on his feet the boy you name had
[2:09:48] most
[2:09:49] and bring hither the fatted calf fatted
[2:09:53] calf and kill it and let us eat and be
[2:09:56] merry amen
[2:09:58] for my son that was dead is alive again

[2:10:07] began to be merry Amazing Grace how
[2:10:11] sweet the sound that saved a wretch like
[2:10:15] me I once was lost but now I'm found I
[2:10:18] was blind but now I see amen
[2:10:22] and the message things are to be we see
[2:10:24] a man that Jesus was talking the parable
[2:10:26] of the sheep folk and he says he says
[2:10:31] you have to come to the door jesus said
[2:10:35] I am the door of the sheepfold
[2:10:37] I am pentecost on this on that that
[2:10:41] don't mean a thing
[2:10:42] you must come by the door and if you
[2:10:47] come by the door you get a robe and this
[2:10:51] man when he said sir how did you get in
[2:10:55] here friend it showed he didn't come the
[2:10:59] right way he didn't come through the
[2:11:01] door he come in some back way but not
[2:11:05] through the door because he didn't have
[2:11:06] the robe on not to the door and the way
[2:11:10] that Jesus came he didn't come the way
[2:11:14] that Jesus came now I want you to pay
[2:11:17] attention sit is because we're traveling
[2:11:19] my brothers and sisters he said you have
[2:11:22] to come through self-sacrifice give you
[2:11:26] all to God the same way Jesus had to
[2:11:30] walk to Calvary you must walk to Calvary
[2:11:33] and be crucified with him and rise again
[2:11:37] to wear his garment of sacrifice and
[2:11:40] death to the things of this world if you
[2:11:44] love the world and the things of the
[2:11:46] world the love of God is not even in you
[2:11:49] if you still have the love of the world
[2:11:52] won't want to act like the world and
[2:11:56] don't
[2:11:58] I like the world and do like the world
[2:12:01] you try your yet you're in church but a
[2:12:06] cover in the patch with the we shout
[2:12:11] with the rest of them rejoice with the
[2:12:13] rest of them all the spiritual blessings
[2:12:16] is upon you you say well i prophesy
[2:12:19] so did Kay Ephesus so did Balaam that
[2:12:22] has nothing to do with it
[2:12:24] hold on to your son he says I have the
[2:12:27] baptism of the Holy Ghost that still has
[2:12:29] nothing to do with it
[2:12:33] that still has nothing to do with it
[2:12:36] that's just only a temporal gift for you
[2:12:39] the real gift is in your soul down there
[2:12:44] amen see that was born of God and that
[2:12:52] controls the whole thing to the Word of
[2:12:54] God and the we love God and there you
[2:12:59] grow up see I want to make sure you get
[2:13:03] back that was born of God
[2:13:06] Nicodemus said you must be born again
[2:13:10] and that control so you can have this
[2:13:13] thing on your first trip that's the
[2:13:16] problem that so many make we start on
[2:13:19] its journey but we have to complete the
[2:13:21] journey we sometimes will go through a
[2:13:26] man to read see and go through the sight
[2:13:29] of Satan occasion of the wilderness and
[2:13:31] right there is where we think we got it
[2:13:35] but we have to cross Jordan we have to
[2:13:40] die out we have to let go we have to
[2:13:44] dump out dump out let go oh right they
[2:13:52] didn't take Christ life he let it go we
[2:13:57] have to be like sheep to fulfill our
[2:14:02] rights
[2:14:03] that's the door that we must come
[2:14:06] through to get the road a man so the
[2:14:11] Word of God in the will of God and you
[2:14:13] grow up and see that you're a son of the
[2:14:16] daughter of God and a child of God and

[2:14:21] mother now you're in the bowels of the
[2:14:24] earth trying to come forth you're a son
[2:14:27] of God

[2:14:38] mean one thing don't mean one thing
[2:14:44] amen you must come to a Calvary amen I'm
[2:14:53] reminded here of a man by the name of
[2:14:57] Daniel curry any man is that a wonderful
[2:15:03] man of God a sainted man a real
[2:15:06] Christian a man that everybody thoughts
[2:15:10] so much of such a wonderful person and
[2:15:15] the story goes that he died and went
[2:15:18] into a trance and he said I went up to
[2:15:20] heaven of course and he when he died he
[2:15:27] went when he got to the pearly gates The
[2:15:32] Caretaker come to the door and said who
[2:15:35] are you he said well I am evangelist
[2:15:39] Daniel Curie I've won thousands of soul
[2:15:42] to Christ and I want to come in this
[2:15:46] morning my life's journey is indeed amen
[2:15:53] on the earth I have no place to go

[2:16:00] morning Center that's the way it's
[2:16:03] coming to you backslider that's the way
[2:16:06] it's coming to you that grieves the Holy
[2:16:09] Spirit away from you a man if i'ma take
[2:16:13] liberty who grieve that day
[2:16:15] of grace away from you not to be gentle
