[52:35] uh that song i'm gonna let y'all just be
[52:37] seated just for a moment here
[52:40] um
[52:41] just some kind of way
[52:43] um god has a way of just confirming
[52:45] things to you
[52:46] [Music]
[52:49] and
[52:50] i didn't know brother solomon's going to
[52:51] bring me out on that on that song
[52:54] today but
[52:55] i just
[52:57] one thing i do know
[52:59] is that we're in the right place at the
[53:01] right time
[53:03] amen and i just feel like god got
[53:05] something in store for us that's already
[53:07] started
[53:08] uh here um this morning i was uh
[53:12] i was
[53:14] contacted by
[53:16] a
[53:17] precious brother
[53:19] um
[53:21] from trinidad there brother ovid and he
[53:23] was they were telling me they can ready
[53:24] to do a
[53:26] virtual convention
[53:28] and um the pastor that is hosting the
[53:30] convention is actually from ghana
[53:32] and they actually said brother jack and
[53:34] i've done this before the accident uh
[53:36] would you
[53:37] just send a few songs
[53:40] that uh you know maybe from you all
[53:42] singing as well as
[53:44] we want you to take 10 minutes and just
[53:46] greet the people
[53:48] you know
[53:49] and uh the first time i tried to do it i
[53:51] we recorded a video amen in the church
[53:53] but the video was too large and i just
[53:55] couldn't send it across so we sent the
[53:56] songs and that was that was it well this
[53:58] time they asked me and the the song that
[54:00] came my mind to send them was not a
[54:03] kelly moo
[54:06] and i was telling brother simba if he
[54:08] would just go in
[54:09] strip it from one of the services i
[54:11] can't remember what service it was that
[54:13] we did it but i asked him to strip it
[54:14] from there and just
[54:16] create a file and we'll send it over to
[54:17] him
[54:18] and i was just telling my brother to say
[54:20] i'm a sinless greeting and
[54:22] amen and and um
[54:24] um
[54:25] you know just trust that it'd be a
[54:26] blessing to
[54:28] uh uh the saints and most of y'all know
[54:31] our
[54:32] some of y'all know our history
[54:34] and uh so some of the saints that we're
[54:36] sending this video to these are saints
[54:38] that we haven't fellowship with probably
[54:40] 20 years
[54:42] and uh so it's it's it's
[54:45] meaningful you know and
[54:48] i feel like you know with the recording
[54:50] and just the song that i had in my heart
[54:52] to sin i felt that was the confirmation
[54:54] right there so thank you brother solomon
[54:57] just for
[54:58] being led of the spirit
[55:01] oh my god
[55:03] i remember when i went to
[55:04] jamaica and uh and i and i ministered
[55:07] and they were singing that song in
[55:08] jamaica i said man i ain't heard this
[55:10] when i heard this and i got to take this
[55:12] one back home and
[55:13] and uh it just i just love the words
[55:16] you've done so much for me
[55:18] god i can't tell at all
[55:21] and then then you know i have to switch
[55:23] from english to
[55:25] another language
[55:26] because naughty killing
[55:29] you know amen what it says receive my
[55:32] praise
[55:33] so uh i just i just appreciate daddy man
[55:36] that's just that's just wonderful uh
[55:38] well i'm not gonna take too much time
[55:40] amen good to have everybody in the house
[55:42] of the lord today uh there was another
[55:45] announcement that came to my mind uh oh
[55:49] yes um
[55:51] we are
[55:53] still receiving any gift cards that
[55:56] anybody want to give we gonna be a
[55:57] blessing to the school here during this
[56:00] holiday season um 75 teachers that
[56:04] was talking to
[56:05] [Music]
[56:07] both sister tina and my wife
[56:09] and they would just make some
[56:10] suggestions i think sister tino's sent
[56:12] us teachers they need
[56:14] supply supplies so we actually gonna
[56:17] bless them with supplies and my wife was
[56:18] saying that maybe we just give them like
[56:20] a little gift card uh in the supply bag
[56:23] so you know uh just something maybe a
[56:25] little different just feed them because
[56:26] everybody can't come and eat at the same
[56:28] time and all that so i said okay that

[1:05:47] glory hallelujah blessed be the name of
[1:05:49] the lord
[1:05:50] amen
[1:05:53] glory
[1:05:55] we want to speak on a little theme which
[1:05:58] already spoken on it it's been a thought
[1:05:59] that has been on my heart for since
[1:06:01] ghana
[1:06:03] for maybe four months
[1:06:04] five months ago
[1:06:06] i have commissioned you by my name says
[1:06:09] the lord jesus christ
[1:06:11] i have commissioned you
[1:06:13] and i want to personalize it to you
[1:06:15] not a group personally to you brother
[1:06:18] troy sister michelle and all of you
[1:06:20] individually you take it as you or me
[1:06:24] amen says the lord almighty
[1:06:27] glory hallelujah to the lord
[1:06:29] [Music]
[1:06:30] let's read the first scripture i give
[1:06:32] the first the scriptures but i want to
[1:06:34] add one scripture to it probably a
[1:06:36] couple more so let's read from genesis
[1:06:38] chapter 1 verse 27 to 28 genesis 1 27
[1:06:42] and 28
[1:06:43] let's go back to the beginning of our
[1:06:45] commission
[1:06:46] before we drop on earth let's go to
[1:06:48] where we began amen where you began
[1:06:51] amen genesis 1
[1:06:53] 27-28 says so god created man in his own
[1:06:57] image
[1:06:58] in the image of god created he him
[1:07:01] male and female created he them
[1:07:04] what i think 28 what where does this let
[1:07:06] us make man in our own image
[1:07:09] let us make man in our own image in the
[1:07:12] image of god created him amen you can
[1:07:15] take your seat please god bless you
[1:07:19] so the lord wanted to
[1:07:20] before the earth was formed
[1:07:22] and when i'm talking about the earth
[1:07:24] don't look at mother earth look at your
[1:07:26] earth
[1:07:27] amen before brother sullivan was formed
[1:07:29] before that trial was formed the lord
[1:07:31] said that let us make you
[1:07:33] he told you
[1:07:34] that let us make man in our image
[1:07:37] so that shows that you already existed
[1:07:40] before you pack the flesh called brother
[1:07:42] solomon
[1:07:43] amen but a solomon used to be before the
[1:07:45] foundation of the world
[1:07:47] amen not the flesh
[1:07:49] but brother solomon that eternal person
[1:07:52] the theophany the pill of fire amen
[1:07:54] whatever your father is you are
[1:07:57] amen
[1:07:58] if you want to test if brother jack is
[1:08:00] the father and historical the parents of
[1:08:02] his
[1:08:02] their daughters
[1:08:04] their blood
[1:08:05] is their blood amen
[1:08:07] they are one they have got the same
[1:08:08] spirit amen
[1:08:10] their dna is in them amen so whatever
[1:08:13] jesus christ is
[1:08:14] is you amen
[1:08:16] don't separate yourself from the lord
[1:08:19] and don't separate the lord from you you
[1:08:20] are him and he is you
[1:08:22] amen if you want to manifest him you
[1:08:25] have to accept him as you and you as him
[1:08:28] amen so he said let us make man in our
[1:08:31] own image
[1:08:32] so that is plurality of god
[1:08:34] god and his attributes
[1:08:36] now we were taught by the prophet that
[1:08:39] we were in him before the foundation of
[1:08:40] the world paul said it in ephesians
[1:08:42] chapter one i think verse four that we
[1:08:45] were in christ before the foundation of
[1:08:47] the world and all the prophet taught it
[1:08:49] that we pre-existed not in the flesh
[1:08:53] but in the spirit
[1:08:55] that's what the lord is not like you're
[1:08:56] thinking amen god's thought is real when
[1:09:00] he says real if god said microphone he
[1:09:02] means microphone
[1:09:03] it's not like a blueprint on his mind
[1:09:05] that he's going to make a microphone
[1:09:07] someday but when the lord said that
[1:09:09] brother uh quentin existed he existed
[1:09:12] amen
[1:09:13] his height everything about him he it
[1:09:16] was just the same amen
[1:09:18] glory hallelujah so before you drop here
[1:09:21] you were there
[1:09:23] here and there look at that let me put
[1:09:25] the natura the letter the word here
[1:09:28] h-e-r-e
[1:09:30] there
[1:09:31] t-h-e-r-e
[1:09:32] the only difference is what the tea
[1:09:34] the tea is the theophany
[1:09:36] and the teresia amen
[1:09:38] one was a terrestrial bean one was a
[1:09:40] celestial bean amen one was in the
[1:09:43] theophany one was in the earth amen so
[1:09:46] that's the only difference it's just the
[1:09:47] light
[1:09:48] the on and off switches
[1:09:51] it's the same electricity you can turn
[1:09:53] it on they save the same whatever where
[1:09:55] is it do you have one here thank you
[1:09:57] brother the same note you can turn it on
[1:09:59] off and the place will be dark you turn
[1:10:02] it back on and it will be light so just
[1:10:04] on an off switch amen
[1:10:06] it's just here and there amen
[1:10:09] glory hallelujah between here and there
[1:10:11] amen
[1:10:12] your answer is right there amen glory
[1:10:15] hallelujah to the lord
[1:10:17] blessed be the name of the lord jesus
[1:10:19] christ
[1:10:19] [Applause]
[1:10:23] amen glory hallelujah blessed be the
[1:10:25] name of the lord amen
[1:10:27] the lord is good so i just want to just
[1:10:30] want to learn a little background about
[1:10:32] our commission
[1:10:33] so i will use some few scriptures thank
[1:10:35] you
[1:10:39] i'll use some few scriptures to later
[1:10:41] background let's go to job 37.
[1:10:44] when you was in trial when he was in
[1:10:46] amnesia you forgot who he was
[1:10:48] but the lord reminded me job where were
[1:10:50] you
[1:10:51] when the sons and daughters of god
[1:10:53] shouted for joy
[1:10:54] it means job existed
[1:10:56] his problem doesn't what
[1:10:58] changed his who he was
[1:11:01] amen because his pre-existence he still
[1:11:04] funny his commission take precedence to
[1:11:07] his problems amen
[1:11:09] so when you remember your commission
[1:11:11] your permission commission truncates
[1:11:13] your problems amen
[1:11:15] remember who you are
[1:11:17] brad jack always preached to us that
[1:11:18] your purpose is your protection
[1:11:22] the purpose god has given to you that is
[1:11:24] why you are here you are not here
[1:11:26] because you are the most handsome woman
[1:11:28] uh most handsome man or most beautiful
[1:11:30] lady you are here because god has a
[1:11:32] purpose and has a commission for you
[1:11:35] amen
[1:11:36] glory hallelujah the other scripture is
[1:11:39] hebrews chapter 12 verse 1
[1:11:41] cloud of witness
[1:11:43] how can a cloud be a witness
[1:11:45] the cloud is still funnies amen
[1:11:49] you were there in those clouds
[1:11:51] not a physical cloud but a supernatural
[1:11:54] cloud
[1:11:54] because whenever elohim travels he
[1:11:56] travels with its people
[1:11:58] he's a king he's got subject he's got
[1:12:01] queen he's got the kingdom he's got his
[1:12:03] wife he's got his servant so whenever he
[1:12:06] travels just like a president or a king
[1:12:08] travels he goes with his entourage amen
[1:12:12] and you
[1:12:12] are part of the entourage of jesus
[1:12:14] christ
[1:12:15] glory hallelujah so the lord has a
[1:12:17] commission for you amen
[1:12:19] let's look at the word commission and
[1:12:21] try to break it down a little bit
[1:12:23] commission i look at the cambridge
[1:12:25] dictionary and he said commission is
[1:12:29] a group of people
[1:12:31] who have been formally chosen
[1:12:33] and given the authority
[1:12:35] to get information about a problem or to
[1:12:37] perform other special duties
[1:12:40] a group of people who have been
[1:12:41] specially chosen and put yourself there
[1:12:43] amen
[1:12:44] were you chosen by the lord jesus christ
[1:12:47] amen have you been given authority of
[1:12:48] the word do you have all the information
[1:12:51] revelation of jesus christ
[1:12:53] to accomplish your commission on earth
[1:12:55] glory hallelujah another definition said
[1:12:57] a commission is a high ranking position
[1:13:00] in the armed forces or a special
[1:13:02] committee that controls and investigate
[1:13:05] something amen so you are here as an
[1:13:07] angel of the lord as a messenger to
[1:13:10] control and investigate the earth
[1:13:12] amen the spirit of christ in you
[1:13:14] remember ram talk about when they see
[1:13:16] flying sources and they're trying to
[1:13:18] find out what is this nasa and all the
[1:13:21] scientists and government want to what
[1:13:23] is this sources what is this
[1:13:24] unidentified flying object ufos and they
[1:13:27] didn't know that those are supernatural
[1:13:29] beings
[1:13:30] amen those are few funnies those are
[1:13:32] holy spirit those are the spirit of
[1:13:34] christ the entourage of jesus christ
[1:13:36] investigating the earth and seeing what
[1:13:39] is going on and then bringing report
[1:13:40] back to the king of kings the lord jesus
[1:13:43] christ amen
[1:13:44] you are somebody you are message jesus
[1:13:47] christ
[1:13:48] you are the very heart of god amen you
[1:13:51] are the motive and the purpose of god
[1:13:53] creating this big universe
[1:13:56] put yourself as a tiny little
[1:13:59] brother or sister
[1:14:00] that you are the motive
[1:14:02] the reason the purpose that the lord
[1:14:04] created all these big planets and the
[1:14:06] universe that exists not only earth by
[1:14:10] mercury jupiter they see the oceans
[1:14:12] antarctica whatever planet you can talk
[1:14:15] about you are the purpose that the lord
[1:14:17] created that planet amen
[1:14:21] and nothing
[1:14:22] can take your purpose away amen
[1:14:25] not even your mistakes and your errors
[1:14:27] and your weaknesses
[1:14:28] glory hallelujah to the lord amen
[1:14:32] and sometimes the lord allows you to go
[1:14:34] through some things
[1:14:35] to be able to accomplish the commission
[1:14:38] like as we read at a commission in the
[1:14:40] military's high ranking position we have
[1:14:42] got what they call special forces
[1:14:44] they are trained in a special way
[1:14:46] now to be in the special force you have
[1:14:48] to go through certain training you have
[1:14:50] to go through the extreme hard a harsh
[1:14:53] weather condition
[1:14:54] very cold condition
[1:14:56] they'll find a place which is very cold
[1:14:58] and you train over there because for the
[1:15:00] purpose if you need to capture somebody
[1:15:02] if you need to kidnap some somebody's
[1:15:04] kidnapped you need to go to that place
[1:15:05] to rescue them you should be able to
[1:15:07] face those weather conditions so they
[1:15:09] are not going to give you the normal
[1:15:10] condition you're going to go through
[1:15:12] very cold area
[1:15:14] early morning snow and you're going to
[1:15:16] train you're not going to wear glass
[1:15:18] you're going to train in the snow run
[1:15:20] and do jogging in snowy area just to get
[1:15:23] your body acclimatized to what lies
[1:15:25] ahead you in the future amen so whatever
[1:15:28] you are going through now is just an
[1:15:30] acclimatization
[1:15:32] the lord is trying to get you used to
[1:15:34] accustomed to what your commission is
[1:15:37] amen
[1:15:38] just like an officer just like a
[1:15:40] military person the lord is training us
[1:15:42] for a purpose on earth glory hallelujah
[1:15:44] to the lord so one establish in your
[1:15:47] mind that you existed before you park on
[1:15:50] this flesh
[1:15:51] amen
[1:15:52] here and there
[1:15:54] here is not the only existence that you
[1:15:56] have
[1:15:57] there is also your existence
[1:15:59] you had it you funny before you dropped
[1:16:01] in the flesh
[1:16:02] if you didn't have a few funny you
[1:16:04] didn't go back there but because you had
[1:16:06] a theophany
[1:16:08] you drop on flesh you put on just the
[1:16:10] flesh to help you to manifest in this
[1:16:12] dimension glory hallelujah to the lord
[1:16:15] just like i use electricity
[1:16:17] if you want to connect your
[1:16:19] cell phone or your refrigerator with
[1:16:21] with a 10 000 voltage it's going to
[1:16:23] blast you
[1:16:25] and fry you
[1:16:26] like a beef
[1:16:27] or like a fish
[1:16:29] it's not going to work it doesn't work
[1:16:31] that way so you have to step the
[1:16:32] electricity 10 000 volt down down to
[1:16:35] where 22 000 uh sorry to
[1:16:38] uh 110 volts where you can comfortably
[1:16:41] plug in your computer yourself on your
[1:16:43] refrigerator and what have you so the
[1:16:45] holy spirit the peel of fire try to step
[1:16:47] himself down from the logos the
[1:16:50] theophany become an angel become a thief
[1:16:53] became a human being so that you can
[1:16:55] communicate on earth amen glory
[1:16:58] hallelujah to the lord amen because the
[1:17:00] supernatural is beyond what the flesh
[1:17:02] and blood can contain so the lord has to
[1:17:04] step himself down in you
[1:17:07] to manifest his glory in your life
[1:17:09] blessed be the name of the lord jesus
[1:17:11] christ
[1:17:12] thank you jesus amen so the lord said
[1:17:14] let us make you made yourself what you
[1:17:16] are now you choose your blessing and you
[1:17:19] choose your problems
[1:17:21] the two go hand in hand amen
[1:17:25] you choose your blessing and you choose
[1:17:27] your problems as well but because we
[1:17:30] came through amnesia we don't remember
[1:17:33] and we want to only have the blessing
[1:17:35] remember jesus
[1:17:36] he was the almighty god was he
[1:17:38] but in flesh there was a time he said
[1:17:40] father who is the father he was praying
[1:17:42] to
[1:17:43] the pillow of fire in him
[1:17:45] that let his cap cut means what
[1:17:47] suffering
[1:17:48] passed over me because he could see the
[1:17:51] suffering that was coming ahead of him
[1:17:52] because he was what he was flesh and
[1:17:54] blood
[1:17:55] because flesh and blood is not made
[1:17:56] naturally to suffer
[1:17:58] but without the suffering you cannot
[1:18:00] appreciate the other side
[1:18:02] he had to suffer on the cross to become
[1:18:04] the king of kings to become the lord of
[1:18:06] lord to live in many member bodies it
[1:18:08] was comfortable to live in the flesh
[1:18:10] called jesus but he had to step down
[1:18:12] that flesh accomplished that work redemp
[1:18:14] redemption work and then moving toward
[1:18:17] many members body millions and billions
[1:18:19] of people all over the planet
[1:18:20] glory hallelujah to have an experience
[1:18:23] so the lord steps you down to be able to
[1:18:26] accomplish the purpose you need to
[1:18:28] accomplish your commission on earth
[1:18:30] blessed be the name of the lord jesus
[1:18:32] christ
[1:18:33] so for your commission to start your
[1:18:35] commission on earth
[1:18:37] the most important thing you need is the
[1:18:39] new breath
[1:18:41] the new birth set you
[1:18:43] on the platform
[1:18:45] on the right at the right position to be
[1:18:47] able to establish your to be able to
[1:18:48] start your commission without the new
[1:18:50] breath
[1:18:51] you all messed up i'm all messed up
[1:18:53] without the holy ghost baptism you
[1:18:55] cannot fulfill that commission
[1:18:58] without being called by the master to
[1:19:00] equip you
[1:19:01] and to send you on the field you're
[1:19:04] gonna fail
[1:19:05] you can't go to afghanistan to go and
[1:19:07] fight when you don't know you haven't
[1:19:08] been trained to face al-qaeda's they'll
[1:19:11] blow you to pieces
[1:19:13] but those who are trained they know how
[1:19:15] to walk they know how to dodge land
[1:19:18] mines they might be land might they can
[1:19:19] detect that there could be a lineman
[1:19:21] here let them pass this way when they
[1:19:22] are going on a patrol they know how to
[1:19:24] maneuver they know how to move
[1:19:27] themselves around they know how to keep
[1:19:29] quiet they know when to talk but if you
[1:19:31] have not been trained right you just be
[1:19:32] talking and they'll blow you to pieces
[1:19:35] amen so the lord train us there are
[1:19:37] certain times in our lives that the lord
[1:19:39] is training you
[1:19:40] in the quiet time so you don't seem to
[1:19:42] hear from the lord he's training you
[1:19:44] amen
[1:19:46] when you go to the native indians when
[1:19:48] the children are born they don't train
[1:19:49] them how to talk first they train them
[1:19:51] how to listen first
[1:19:53] because they used to have tribal enemies
[1:19:56] so they don't want the kids to give them
[1:19:57] away
[1:19:58] so they
[1:19:59] train you to be to keep quiet for an
[1:20:02] hour you don't say nothing just keep
[1:20:04] quiet and you learn and when you learn
[1:20:06] how to keep quiet
[1:20:08] then they train you how to talk
[1:20:13] because the silence time is as important
[1:20:15] as the talking times
[1:20:17] we are only used to babbling talking
[1:20:20] we talk about the certain time you want
[1:20:22] to what want to be quiet
[1:20:24] and listen to the king of kings in your
[1:20:25] heart
[1:20:27] and sometimes when you listen to him
[1:20:29] you find that you have only you already
[1:20:30] have the solution of the problem that
[1:20:32] you are battling with
[1:20:34] but because we don't listen sometimes we
[1:20:37] think the problem the solution is like
[1:20:38] million billion miles away but it's
[1:20:41] right here amen
[1:20:43] you just only have to what have a
[1:20:44] listening ear
[1:20:46] and when you pray then believe listen to
[1:20:48] your heart for he lives in your heart he
[1:20:51] speaks amen he can speak through your
[1:20:53] own lips to encourage yourself he can
[1:20:56] speak through somebody's lips he can
[1:20:58] speak through scriptures he can speak
[1:21:00] through a text message someone who sent
[1:21:01] to you he can speak through a billboard
[1:21:03] he can speak through nature he can speak
[1:21:05] through animals he can speak through
[1:21:07] everything to help you in your situation
[1:21:10] glory hallelujah to the lord
[1:21:13] blessed be the name of the lord jesus
[1:21:14] christ so you need the baptism of the
[1:21:17] holy ghost the old person has to die
[1:21:19] amen and then you go to the back of the
[1:21:21] desert like moses
[1:21:23] remember moses was a failure
[1:21:25] as
[1:21:25] a prophet as a deliverer so moses
[1:21:29] bought it himself up
[1:21:31] and gave up on his commission
[1:21:33] and went to
[1:21:34] uh
[1:21:35] africa
[1:21:36] to look for a wife
[1:21:37] and then settled there become became a
[1:21:39] shepherd taking his fathers in lordship
[1:21:42] but what he said in heaven
[1:21:44] took precedence of his failure amen
[1:21:48] in heaven in the sixth dimension
[1:21:50] moses
[1:21:52] told himself i am going to deliver the
[1:21:54] people
[1:21:55] and lord send me at this time and the
[1:21:57] lord sent him to aaron and his mother i
[1:21:59] forgot his name
[1:22:01] yoshi thank you so moses nobody could
[1:22:05] take moses please
[1:22:06] regardless of his failures
[1:22:08] moses could not run away no he was still
[1:22:11] in the arms of the lord
[1:22:13] amen
[1:22:14] after he thought his run
[1:22:16] he found a voice moses
[1:22:19] take off your shoes
[1:22:20] for the land is the holy ground
[1:22:23] and he thought he's run away it's okay
[1:22:24] he's cool
[1:22:26] but the lord still went to fetch him and
[1:22:28] said go to egypt and go and deliver my
[1:22:30] people he said lord no you you don't
[1:22:32] understand
[1:22:34] i can't go there
[1:22:35] i have a warrant to be to be kidnapped
[1:22:38] to uh to be arrested
[1:22:40] and said go i am i am that i am is
[1:22:43] sending you
[1:22:44] my commission
[1:22:46] take precedence over over your uh
[1:22:49] arrest warrant
[1:22:50] so go back your mistakes doesn't negate
[1:22:54] your election
[1:22:58] amen your righteousness
[1:23:00] is not what makes you who you is not
[1:23:02] what elected you
[1:23:04] your holiness didn't give you eternal
[1:23:06] life
[1:23:08] and your mistakes
[1:23:10] can never in no way negate
[1:23:13] your election
[1:23:14] your redemption
[1:23:16] your eternal life
[1:23:18] your manifestation amen
[1:23:20] regardless of how many mistakes you made
[1:23:22] or how many sins you've committed they
[1:23:24] can't negate the mind of god
[1:23:27] remember the man of god is what eterna
[1:23:29] and israel is he and amen
[1:23:33] no matter how much yours your children
[1:23:36] may run away they are still in the arms
[1:23:38] of the lord
[1:23:40] [Applause]
[1:23:42] they can run to the north the south the
[1:23:44] east the west
[1:23:45] they're still in the arms of the lord
[1:23:48] they haven't gone nowhere amen
[1:23:51] and you believe for them amen
[1:23:53] just as you believe for yourself
[1:23:55] and it will happen amen glory hallelujah
[1:23:58] to the lord
[1:23:59] blessed be the name of the lord and
[1:24:01] sometimes the lord let us go through
[1:24:02] some crude stuff just for your election
[1:24:04] let me use esther for example
[1:24:06] esther was born to be a deliverer oh how
[1:24:09] could she be a deliverer she's a woman
[1:24:11] yes she was born to deliver israel
[1:24:13] amen in the way the lord ordained her to
[1:24:16] be amen
[1:24:17] so esther the lord at the tender age the
[1:24:19] lord took both parents
[1:24:21] it wasn't the devil it was the lord who
[1:24:23] called their parents back home
[1:24:25] that your job is to bring esther it was
[1:24:27] somebody somebody else's job to train
[1:24:29] esther
[1:24:30] to fulfill what i want her to fulfill
[1:24:33] glory hallelujah
[1:24:35] so the devil is just a tool in the hand
[1:24:37] of the lord
[1:24:39] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:24:41] so now esther's parents were taken away
[1:24:44] and esther has to be raised by mordecai
[1:24:46] who became the father
[1:24:48] and mother trained her in the word of
[1:24:50] the lord
[1:24:51] in prayers and in fasting
[1:24:53] and reading the scriptures at the scroll
[1:24:56] and so esther grew up learning the word
[1:24:58] of the lord amen
[1:25:02] not fully understanding what her purpose
[1:25:04] on life were
[1:25:06] she was a human being
[1:25:08] you can read about esther now and talk
[1:25:09] about how great she was but when she was
[1:25:11] going through her commissioning
[1:25:14] she had to go through some tough times
[1:25:16] losing both parents
[1:25:18] not even that or mum remaining but both
[1:25:20] of them were gone
[1:25:22] and she was now a foster child
[1:25:24] but that isn't negate estes election
[1:25:28] that didn't negate her calling for her
[1:25:30] life amen it actually rather enhanced
[1:25:34] her calling amen because she learned how
[1:25:36] to pray
[1:25:37] how to fast how to wait on jehovah how
[1:25:40] to do 3-d praying fasting it became it
[1:25:43] was engrained in hair
[1:25:45] for the purpose that she had to fulfill
[1:25:47] on earth
[1:25:48] and when the right time come the lord
[1:25:50] glorified her
[1:25:52] your commission
[1:25:53] your purpose is your protection
[1:25:55] your commission is your glorification
[1:25:58] the lord has put this glory on you
[1:26:00] the lord has made by the jack who is
[1:26:03] because of the commission that they call
[1:26:04] him to be
[1:26:05] amen the lord has put their glory on you
[1:26:08] because of the commission he has called
[1:26:10] you to be amen
[1:26:15] amen so there was a time that esther
[1:26:18] went through the training and was turned
[1:26:20] over elevated esther
[1:26:22] esther was she was an immigrant
[1:26:25] a jewish person
[1:26:27] and in those time the land of er
[1:26:29] wasn't him the king was kinna jesus it
[1:26:31] was like the united states about 54
[1:26:35] still put together amen the bible said
[1:26:37] that 127 provinces is that it's the
[1:26:40] modern day india and her kin his kingdom
[1:26:44] straight from india eastern countries
[1:26:46] all the way to africa because the bible
[1:26:48] says ethiopia was part of his kingdom
[1:26:50] and this one was very powerful and it
[1:26:52] came to pass that his wife disobeyed him
[1:26:54] and they needed another lady another
[1:26:56] queen for the kingdom another wife for
[1:26:58] the king
[1:26:59] and there were many more beautiful women
[1:27:01] who were more men who were more
[1:27:02] beautiful than esther by the lord odin
[1:27:05] esther for that time and season
[1:27:07] ernesto didn't put on lipsticks she
[1:27:10] didn't put on nothing artificial
[1:27:12] but she went to praying fasting it was
[1:27:14] like a beauty contest whoever i want or
[1:27:17] for all the young virgins you can have
[1:27:19] whatever you need if you need money you
[1:27:21] need clothing you need whatever to maybe
[1:27:23] take care of yourself for six months and
[1:27:24] appear before the king and if you please
[1:27:26] that can you are going to be the queen
[1:27:27] the king's wife and esther went into
[1:27:30] prayer and fasting with his uncle with
[1:27:32] his father
[1:27:34] and esther when appeared when she
[1:27:35] appeared before the king
[1:27:37] there's something supernatural about
[1:27:39] esther
[1:27:40] that when the king saw her he said this
[1:27:42] is the lady this is a young lady that i
[1:27:44] want to marry
[1:27:45] and esther became the queen right but
[1:27:47] that wasn't just for esther's comfort
[1:27:50] amen
[1:27:51] that was a comfort yes she became the
[1:27:54] first lady of the land the queen of of
[1:27:56] of i mean of united states that was
[1:27:58] great with all the purposes around
[1:28:01] but there was a purpose to that amen
[1:28:05] the purpose was to save israel
[1:28:08] glory hallelujah
[1:28:09] and there was a time when the enemy
[1:28:11] arose
[1:28:12] what is his name the man who wanted to
[1:28:14] amen wanted all the jews to be killed
[1:28:17] and there was there was evil
[1:28:20] against israel
[1:28:22] and of course esther was a jewish
[1:28:24] regardless of her being the queen she
[1:28:26] was a jewish she was an immigrant
[1:28:29] so if they were going to kill all the
[1:28:30] jews the queen would be killed as well
[1:28:33] regardless of being the the queen
[1:28:36] so the anchor said hey esther don't
[1:28:37] think because you're in the palace
[1:28:39] you're in a white house you still have
[1:28:40] to remember your praying fasting
[1:28:42] [Applause]
[1:28:43] we still have to go on our knees
[1:28:45] and the lord puts you there for a
[1:28:47] purpose
[1:28:48] you have a purpose esther
[1:28:50] that is why the lord gave you to me to
[1:28:51] train you
[1:28:52] and so pastor rise to the occasion
[1:28:55] amen
[1:28:56] and esther rose to the occasion
[1:28:58] he said i need your praise and support
[1:29:00] and i'm going to do what i need to do
[1:29:03] if i die i die
[1:29:04] and if i'm sick i've saved glory
[1:29:06] hallelujah to the lord blessed be the
[1:29:08] name of the lord there are certain times
[1:29:10] that the lord uses women as well amen
[1:29:14] for some great things on earth amen
[1:29:16] and the lord will put that purpose in
[1:29:17] your heart and you have to rise to the
[1:29:19] occasion
[1:29:20] and accomplish what the lord wants you
[1:29:22] to do
[1:29:23] blessed be the name of the lord so as i
[1:29:25] said you pray for me we are going to
[1:29:27] pray and fasting and she was a prayer
[1:29:29] warrior already
[1:29:30] so she's just you have to know how to
[1:29:31] switch dimensions
[1:29:33] [Applause]
[1:29:35] there are certain times that you are
[1:29:37] walking there just as a human being but
[1:29:39] when they say need you have to go back
[1:29:40] to who you were amen there sometimes
[1:29:43] you'll be working as brother jack a
[1:29:44] human being
[1:29:45] he's a son he's a father he said brother
[1:29:48] he's a friend but there are certain
[1:29:49] times that they asked what switch
[1:29:51] dimension
[1:29:52] and go to the real brother jack in him
[1:29:54] come out to take care of certain things
[1:29:55] you need to take care of amen there are
[1:29:57] certain things that you'll be mr erica
[1:29:59] sweet and kind but there are other times
[1:30:02] that you have to go back to who you are
[1:30:03] amen and manifest the one in you to be
[1:30:06] able to bring things to pass glory
[1:30:08] hallelujah to the lord amen blessed be
[1:30:12] the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:30:21] and esther had learned how to switch
[1:30:23] dimension
[1:30:24] through prayer and fasting
[1:30:26] and the screw that they read in their
[1:30:27] time
[1:30:28] so when the time came esther went into
[1:30:30] the spirit of the lord in prayer and
[1:30:32] fasting and she was a queen she had all
[1:30:35] their food whatever breakfast she wanted
[1:30:37] lunch dinner but i said no i don't want
[1:30:39] none of them it's time for me to go back
[1:30:42] to the theophanic dimension because
[1:30:44] there's something that needs to be
[1:30:45] accomplished
[1:30:47] glory hallelujah
[1:30:49] and through prayer and fasting
[1:30:51] the tide began to change
[1:30:53] in favor of esther
[1:30:55] and the law of the land was that if you
[1:30:57] go before the king if the king didn't
[1:30:59] call you
[1:31:00] and you go before the king there are two
[1:31:02] things that could
[1:31:03] you have or two alternatives two choices
[1:31:06] if you choose to go before the king
[1:31:08] and the king doesn't stretch his hand or
[1:31:10] his sword for you
[1:31:12] then executes to come for you and kill
[1:31:13] you
[1:31:14] so it's not a joke
[1:31:16] to go before the king when you have not
[1:31:17] been invited but esther put her life in
[1:31:20] her hands
[1:31:21] and went before the king
[1:31:23] and the king said esther
[1:31:25] thou great beautiful queen what is your
[1:31:27] desire
[1:31:28] even half of the kingdom i'll give it to
[1:31:30] you
[1:31:31] what made the difference
[1:31:32] prayer and fasting
[1:31:35] switching dimension
[1:31:38] she has to close your belly amen
[1:31:41] nigerians have got a term called belly
[1:31:43] fall he didn't go belly full she went
[1:31:45] barely empty
[1:31:48] when the theophany was full in her amen
[1:31:50] she did away with the sticks
[1:31:53] and all the good food
[1:31:55] and all the
[1:31:56] chicken even the plant food
[1:32:02] not even the vegetables
[1:32:04] she did all away with them and she went
[1:32:07] barely empty
[1:32:08] and then that you found a pillow fire
[1:32:09] the true esther came into manifestation
[1:32:12] and when she appeared before the king it
[1:32:13] wasn't a physical esther but it's a pill
[1:32:15] of fire
[1:32:16] that changed the heart of the king to
[1:32:19] give favor to esther
[1:32:20] and now things change in the favor of
[1:32:22] esther and esther became the great
[1:32:24] deliverer and even after now if you go
[1:32:26] to israel or jewish people in all the
[1:32:28] land they have a piece called the feast
[1:32:29] of esther if you look at jewish calendar
[1:32:32] they have it there observe what esther
[1:32:34] did for israel
[1:32:36] but look at the beginning of esther she
[1:32:38] was somebody was born
[1:32:40] under privilege
[1:32:41] losing both parents when she was a
[1:32:43] little kid but the lord had a purpose
[1:32:45] her commission her election her
[1:32:48] predestination
[1:32:50] had to do with what you are going
[1:32:51] through
[1:32:52] and your purpose your predestination
[1:32:55] your commission has got to do with
[1:32:57] everything you are going through
[1:32:59] amen
[1:33:00] so don't worry don't fret your heart why
[1:33:03] me why do i have to go through this yes
[1:33:05] it's you that the lord choose
[1:33:07] it's you it's me amen so that you can
[1:33:09] bring your commission to be accomplished
[1:33:12] because heaven is written on you
[1:33:15] heaven is dependent on you heaven is
[1:33:17] counting on you sister virginia god
[1:33:20] bless you
[1:33:21] heaven is counting on you to bring those
[1:33:23] peppers into manifestation amen and when
[1:33:26] you got the holy ghost baptism in other
[1:33:28] words the crisis in you if you and your
[1:33:30] theophany are united you are on the on
[1:33:32] switch if you are the off switch you
[1:33:35] don't even know you have a commission
[1:33:37] peter didn't know he had a commission
[1:33:38] when he was in the off switch
[1:33:40] he was concerned about
[1:33:42] fishing
[1:33:43] in fact all the disciples who is going
[1:33:45] to sit at
[1:33:46] at the top of jesus christ at the side
[1:33:49] of jesus christ which brothers which
[1:33:51] family will sit close to jesus
[1:33:53] but when the day of pentecost when the
[1:33:55] holy ghost came
[1:33:57] when the spirit of envy comparison by
[1:33:59] biotin was done away with and they got
[1:34:02] their commission at the upper room
[1:34:05] they were not talking about who would be
[1:34:07] greater in the kingdom of god
[1:34:09] they came down to save amen
[1:34:12] your commission is not to be big
[1:34:14] but your community is to go so low
[1:34:16] and save amen
[1:34:18] that's why we are servants and handmaids
[1:34:20] of the lord because we are we are here
[1:34:22] to save god's creation upon the earth
[1:34:26] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:34:28] let's read a couple of scriptures i've
[1:34:29] not even read the scriptures
[1:34:31] let's go to matthew 28 16-20
[1:34:35] matthew 28 16-20
[1:34:39] and probably i'll give the rest of the
[1:34:40] scriptures to us to go to read at home
[1:34:43] marty 28 16-20 i left my bible home the
[1:34:47] lord had a purpose for it so we than the
[1:34:49] lord
[1:34:50] is
[1:34:51] then the 11 disciples maybe our liberal

[1:35:05] then the 11 disciples went away into
[1:35:07] galilee into a mountain where jesus had
[1:35:10] appointed them
[1:35:12] and when they saw him they worshiped him
[1:35:15] but some doubted it
[1:35:19] and jesus came and spake unto them
[1:35:21] saying all powers given unto me in
[1:35:23] heaven
[1:35:24] and in earth
[1:35:26] go ye therefore and teach all nations
[1:35:29] baptizing them in the name of the father
[1:35:31] and of the son
[1:35:33] and of the holy ghost
[1:35:35] teaching them to observe all things
[1:35:37] whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i
[1:35:40] am with you always even unto the end of
[1:35:42] the world amen amen
[1:35:45] so that is
[1:35:46] one of the commission go into the world
[1:35:49] that is a command commission
[1:35:51] the king has commissioned you
[1:35:53] and preach the gospel teach other
[1:35:55] nations that thou be believed baptize
[1:35:57] them in the name of the lord jesus
[1:35:59] christ
[1:36:00] that is the commission god has given to
[1:36:02] all of us to be a witness
[1:36:04] amen to share the gospel and do you know
[1:36:06] the best preaching you can preach
[1:36:08] preach with your life
[1:36:11] if you can utter one word with your lips
[1:36:14] let the christ in you
[1:36:15] shine before the people and they will
[1:36:17] see their cries in you amen that is the
[1:36:20] best preaching that your neighbor will
[1:36:21] knock at your door
[1:36:22] sister my daughter is sick i've watched
[1:36:25] you you've been neighbors for two years
[1:36:27] 20 years what however long you've been
[1:36:29] neighbors for
[1:36:30] and i could see you are different
[1:36:33] and i'm not a christian or i don't know
[1:36:35] the lord
[1:36:36] but can you tell me a bit can you tell
[1:36:38] me something about the guy that you save
[1:36:40] i see you and your family i could see
[1:36:42] the way you dress i could see the way
[1:36:44] you carry yourself i could see how you
[1:36:46] talk i could see your laugh towards the
[1:36:47] neighbors i could see you are different
[1:36:49] what makes you that different this is a
[1:36:51] ritual
[1:36:52] and you're going to open your arms
[1:36:54] of blessing
[1:36:56] and you're christ in you
[1:36:58] the pill of fire in you
[1:36:59] and be a blessing to the people amen
[1:37:02] and that is the commission the lord has
[1:37:03] commissioned us to be we want to go to
[1:37:05] another scripture john 9 4
[1:37:08] the book of john chapter 9 verse 4.
[1:37:18] amen let's finish the reading then
[1:37:22] john 9 4
[1:37:24] i must work the works of him that sent
[1:37:26] me
[1:37:28] while it is day the night cometh when no
[1:37:30] man can work
[1:37:32] amen glory hallelujah
[1:37:36] i must work jesus said this that he must
[1:37:38] work when he was on earth
[1:37:40] the work
[1:37:41] that he's been sent to do he was a
[1:37:44] servant he was the almighty god but he
[1:37:46] left his glory he left the tea and he
[1:37:49] came here amen he left the glory the
[1:37:52] theophanic dimension the theophany was
[1:37:54] telling him but he put himself in a
[1:37:56] cloud of flesh to be able to manifest as
[1:37:59] a redeemer to be a servant to wash feet
[1:38:02] to to hug little children to pray for
[1:38:04] mothers to heal their sick and that was
[1:38:06] commissioned so he said i must work the
[1:38:08] rest of him that sent me while it is
[1:38:09] there the ninth comet went over can work
[1:38:11] what was the night that was the seventh
[1:38:13] church ages
[1:38:15] the night time
[1:38:16] when the moon when does the moon come
[1:38:18] the moon come and the night
[1:38:21] does the sun shine at the night no
[1:38:24] the moon does what reflects
[1:38:26] the light of the sun
[1:38:28] so the night time the heart stars
[1:38:31] they had messengers
[1:38:32] but they didn't have the fullness of the
[1:38:34] sun
[1:38:35] starting from paul
[1:38:36] up to abraham amen
[1:38:38] but then the lord used the nighttime to
[1:38:41] show
[1:38:42] the ministry of the wife
[1:38:44] the moon is the minister of the wife
[1:38:47] amen it reflected from the sun
[1:38:49] the prophet and the messengers were
[1:38:51] reflecting the light of the sun but the
[1:38:53] fullness of the sun had not come yet but
[1:38:55] in the morning the sun comes out amen so
[1:38:59] the prophet preaching the same one
[1:39:00] called it is the rising of the sun
[1:39:04] it means that night time is over
[1:39:06] we are no longer in the seven church
[1:39:07] ages
[1:39:09] it is we put it relegated to the rail
[1:39:12] amen
[1:39:13] but the lord had a special designation
[1:39:16] for certain special people remember when
[1:39:17] we read the meaning of a commission that
[1:39:20] special class of people that have been
[1:39:22] commissioned to do a special job so you
[1:39:25] were not brought up in the seven church
[1:39:26] ages we were born after the seven church
[1:39:29] ages and seven is accounting if you go
[1:39:31] to the greek number seven is a counter
[1:39:33] number eight is two zeros
[1:39:36] in actuality eight is eternity double
[1:39:39] portion so the lord ordained and
[1:39:42] designed and commissioned you to come
[1:39:44] after the seven churches to manifest him
[1:39:47] on earth
[1:39:48] glory hallelujah
[1:39:50] that's why you and i didn't get to see
[1:39:52] the prophet
[1:39:53] because you have to see the lord himself
[1:39:55] amen
[1:39:58] glory hallelujah amen
[1:40:01] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:40:04] that is why you didn't get to see the
[1:40:05] messenger
[1:40:07] that is why john the baptist
[1:40:10] when he was born
[1:40:11] he had a special designation and
[1:40:13] commission
[1:40:15] so at the age of nine his father was
[1:40:16] already taken to heaven
[1:40:18] because he wasn't born to brain incense
[1:40:21] zakaria was
[1:40:23] born to to burn incense in the temple
[1:40:26] but john his commission was way higher
[1:40:29] than his father was to introduce the
[1:40:31] messiah so john the lord made sure that
[1:40:34] this father's work will not contaminate
[1:40:36] his commission
[1:40:39] glory hallelujah
[1:40:41] there were people in the days of the
[1:40:42] prophet
[1:40:43] that when the prophet was taken away it
[1:40:45] was like the literate the lord jesus
[1:40:47] christ has been taken away
[1:40:49] families were
[1:40:50] broke into pieces
[1:40:52] they didn't know where to turn
[1:40:54] because a man who could tell you
[1:40:56] things in your family
[1:40:59] who could tell you your destiny who
[1:41:01] could tell you tell your house number
[1:41:03] when he has never been to your house
[1:41:05] before
[1:41:06] who could tell you the conversation that
[1:41:07] you were having with your children and
[1:41:08] your wife when he wasn't in your bedroom
[1:41:12] i think brother prayed green one time
[1:41:13] was when he met him and said he was
[1:41:14] going to he was the arrangement meeting
[1:41:16] for abraham and he was talking to his
[1:41:18] wife about going to get a kiss haircut
[1:41:20] and when he said he said you are brother
[1:41:22] green you love the color green your
[1:41:24] dough is green you were talking up to
[1:41:25] your wife about the haircut is that a
[1:41:26] brown were you hiding around my house
[1:41:29] i said no i wasn't hiding there
[1:41:31] but i saw you
[1:41:32] but i saw you
[1:41:34] glory hallelujah
[1:41:36] and if the lord wants you to be
[1:41:38] in india without you stepping foot to
[1:41:41] india you make sure you do that
[1:41:43] if the lord wants you to be in africa or
[1:41:45] europe without you stepping your foot to
[1:41:47] europe but at solomon the pillow fight
[1:41:49] in you can do that amen so the lord
[1:41:51] makes sure that we're not born in the
[1:41:53] night time but we're born at the rising
[1:41:56] of the sun
[1:41:58] so greater is your faith when you didn't
[1:42:00] see the prophet
[1:42:02] but you have to deal with the son of man
[1:42:04] himself
[1:42:05] amen
[1:42:06] you believed you didn't see the prayer
[1:42:08] line you didn't see the discernment but
[1:42:10] you have belief after time
[1:42:13] because you are believed in eternity
[1:42:14] amen
[1:42:15] and when you speak you already see an
[1:42:18] amen
[1:42:19] you don't have to wait for abraham to
[1:42:20] preach to you because you already preach
[1:42:22] the word to you
[1:42:23] the word is in your heart and when you
[1:42:25] take the word and you eat it it would
[1:42:27] have been awesome to be in bradham
[1:42:28] tabernacle listen to the prophet sitting
[1:42:31] at at the front uh pew and hearing the
[1:42:34] prophet of the lord that would have been
[1:42:36] a blessing but it's a greater blessing
[1:42:39] when the lord himself
[1:42:40] steps
[1:42:41] his feet in your flesh and said i am
[1:42:43] that i am
[1:42:45] i have married you i am in your flesh
[1:42:48] i am greater than the prophet
[1:42:50] amen
[1:42:52] remember the man in the time of jesus
[1:42:54] the man who was the name the crippled
[1:42:56] person who wanted to be healed and in
[1:42:58] those time the lord sent an angel
[1:43:00] to stead the waters and whoever will
[1:43:02] dive into the water will be healed and
[1:43:04] this man has tried is this 38 years
[1:43:07] he couldn't
[1:43:08] and almighty that this the sender
[1:43:11] the the pres the king himself was
[1:43:14] talking to him that do you want to be
[1:43:15] healed
[1:43:16] and he started making excuses
[1:43:18] yes i've tried for 38 years
[1:43:20] trying to be healed
[1:43:22] trying to get my strength back but i'm
[1:43:25] lame i can't walk before i get there
[1:43:28] people get ahead of me
[1:43:29] the question is do you want to be healed
[1:43:33] whatever infirmity that you have
[1:43:35] and when the lord got him to know that i
[1:43:37] am that i am standing before you he said
[1:43:39] lord i want to be healed so rise up and
[1:43:41] take your mat and go your way amen what
[1:43:44] is your infirmity
[1:43:45] what is your trouble now is it cancer is
[1:43:48] infertility is it job is it money is it
[1:43:52] peace in your family redemption of your
[1:43:54] loved ones
[1:43:55] it's in you amen
[1:43:57] just believe it speak it and it will
[1:44:00] happen amen
[1:44:02] because
[1:44:03] the creative voice is in you and your
[1:44:05] father wants you to manifest him
[1:44:08] he doesn't always want to give it if you
[1:44:10] there's a scene that teach me how to
[1:44:11] fish
[1:44:12] do not fish for me
[1:44:14] because if you fish for me give me two
[1:44:15] pieces of fish
[1:44:17] i'll eat it i'll get hungry and i'll
[1:44:18] come and knock out your door
[1:44:20] give me fish but if you teach me how to
[1:44:22] fish i can go to the lakes and oceans
[1:44:26] and everywhere to fish for myself
[1:44:28] and the lord doesn't always want to
[1:44:30] carry us yes he carries it when we're
[1:44:32] babies but we are adults now spiritually
[1:44:34] speaking and he wants you to manifest
[1:44:36] him he just wants to see his sons and
[1:44:38] daughters
[1:44:39] speaking
[1:44:40] and claiming and believing and the lord
[1:44:43] who is proud he's more happy when he
[1:44:45] when he has to
[1:44:47] how do i put it the lord is not too
[1:44:49] pleased when he has to carry you all the
[1:44:51] time
[1:44:53] then become like an orphan he become
[1:44:54] like like
[1:44:55] a lame person
[1:44:58] spiritually disabled
[1:45:00] he has to be pushed all around
[1:45:03] but when he can have confidence in you
[1:45:05] that his son brother troy
[1:45:07] can speak
[1:45:09] and cancer will drop
[1:45:11] can speak he's not going to say oh i
[1:45:13] wish but abram was here i wish jesus of
[1:45:15] nazareth is here
[1:45:17] how he's going to heal my sickness how's
[1:45:19] going to take up my situation
[1:45:21] you are jesus of nazareth amen
[1:45:23] oh let's put this way you are jesus of
[1:45:25] west palm beach

[1:45:38] jesus of whatever wherever you come from
[1:45:41] you are jesus christ in flesh
[1:45:43] the man literally jesus christ in many
[1:45:45] form amen
[1:45:47] and when you speak it's as good as jesus
[1:45:49] of nazareth's book
[1:45:51] it's as good as paul of tarsus book it's
[1:45:54] as good as william abraham of
[1:45:55] jeffersonville spoke
[1:45:57] you are jesus of a
[1:45:59] florida amen
[1:46:01] and if somebody's looking for jesus
[1:46:04] praise god hallelujah he said oh i'm the
[1:46:06] one you are looking for i am jesus
[1:46:08] amen
[1:46:10] remember the policeman in england
[1:46:12] when the american paparazzi went to
[1:46:15] england to investigate john wesley's
[1:46:16] ministry
[1:46:17] they went they didn't get nowhere they
[1:46:19] went to this policeman who was full of
[1:46:20] the fire of god the pill of fire
[1:46:22] imbabbing him and praising the lord and
[1:46:25] they say hello sir we want to uh we're
[1:46:27] looking for a john wesley's revival he
[1:46:29] said you have born a revere you have
[1:46:31] arrived i am john wesley's revival

[1:46:36] you should be able to tell people that i
[1:46:37] am jesus christ
[1:46:39] i can pray for you
[1:46:40] i can lay my hands on you i can anoint
[1:46:43] you i can change your situation because
[1:46:45] the power the authority has been given
[1:46:47] to you amen do you know that rapture is
[1:46:50] in you
[1:46:51] the rapture is not going to come from
[1:46:52] somewhere
[1:46:53] you are the rapture the resurrection is
[1:46:55] in you
[1:46:56] millennium is in you
[1:46:58] whatever you need is in you
[1:47:00] because eternal life is in you
[1:47:02] eternal life jesus christ is in you
[1:47:05] amen that's why the bible said that
[1:47:08] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:47:10] the lord jesus christ and you shall seek
[1:47:12] you shall receive the holy spirit
[1:47:15] the bible said seek ye first the kingdom
[1:47:18] of god and the righteousness thereof and
[1:47:20] all the other things
[1:47:22] all the other commission
[1:47:24] all the other attributes will be
[1:47:26] manifested in you resurrection
[1:47:28] millennium new heaven and new earth is
[1:47:30] right in you amen god bless you amen
[1:47:34] everything that you need off is right in
[1:47:36] your heart amen
[1:47:38] if you have a desire
[1:47:40] just like esther like hannah had a
[1:47:42] desire
[1:47:44] hannah couldn't accept being barry no
[1:47:46] she was 17 years old said no no me
[1:47:49] have served the lord with my husband
[1:47:50] since i'm remarried
[1:47:52] we're teenagers i am going to bear
[1:47:54] children i am not a baron and hannah
[1:47:57] spoke to herself she she cried yes she
[1:47:59] went to the moses ministry of crying
[1:48:02] but she came to the joshua ministry of
[1:48:04] allotting the land to herself amen
[1:48:08] when it's time to cry cry it's okay it
[1:48:10] relieves some emotions
[1:48:12] that's why the lord brought moses moses
[1:48:14] means taking from water
[1:48:16] so water was with moses all the time but
[1:48:18] then when they come to joshua i remember
[1:48:19] moses had to cross the red sea
[1:48:21] but joshua what did joshua do a lot the
[1:48:24] land
[1:48:25] william brahm's ministry was moses
[1:48:27] ministry
[1:48:28] if you read a what's the name um what's
[1:48:31] the scripture the last book of the old
[1:48:32] testament malachi
[1:48:34] a thread somewhere said our behold
[1:48:38] elijah and moses i'll send you a prophet
[1:48:40] like elijah moses
[1:48:42] so he has both elijah and moses ministry
[1:48:44] and encompassing him
[1:48:46] but who gave him that ministry
[1:48:48] jesus christ
[1:48:50] and that ministry is in you
[1:48:53] but then when after time
[1:48:56] at the rest of the sun
[1:48:58] what administration do we have
[1:49:00] if the night ministry was so great
[1:49:02] what about the money ministry
[1:49:04] if the sun
[1:49:06] is so brilliant could give us so much
[1:49:08] light yes sorry if the moon
[1:49:11] could give us light during the night how
[1:49:13] much more the sun
[1:49:15] because where does the moon get his
[1:49:16] light from
[1:49:18] the sun
[1:49:19] is the son of man in you
[1:49:21] are you the son of god
[1:49:23] are you the son of david
[1:49:25] are you the son of man
[1:49:27] you have all the ministry in your heart
[1:49:30] the lord jesus christ in the flesh
[1:49:32] of jesus two thousand years plus ago
[1:49:35] could do the same thing in the flesh of
[1:49:37] brother solomon
[1:49:38] in the flesh of brother jerry in the
[1:49:40] flesh about the quentin junior in the
[1:49:42] flesh about the quentin senior
[1:49:44] brother brother simba in every one of us
[1:49:47] in all the sisters
[1:49:48] the same lord jesus christ if there's a
[1:49:50] need for you to pray for cancer
[1:49:53] don't look for oh i wish bubram is here
[1:49:55] oh my how you could spill the cans out
[1:49:57] of existence
[1:49:59] you sister cherise am i right
[1:50:02] cheryl god bless you you can speak the
[1:50:05] cancer out of existence
[1:50:07] because the same christ
[1:50:08] in hana in willie abraham and jesus is
[1:50:12] in you
[1:50:13] and whatever jesus did 2000 years ago
[1:50:15] you can do the same thing when they need
[1:50:17] arise
[1:50:18] they lost authority and power is not for
[1:50:21] sure no
[1:50:22] but it's for a need
[1:50:23] when they need a rice you have to arise
[1:50:26] to the occasion just like esther
[1:50:28] glory hallelujah to the lord
[1:50:31] blessed be the name of the lord jesus
[1:50:32] christ let's read one more scripture
[1:50:34] isaiah 43
[1:50:36] and verse 6.
[1:50:43] isaiah 43 6
[1:50:45] glory to the lord
[1:50:51] i will say to the north give up
[1:50:54] and to the south keep not back
[1:50:56] bring my sons from far
[1:50:58] and my daughters from the ends of the
[1:51:00] earth amen
[1:51:02] this scripture
[1:51:03] i will say this the description is
[1:51:05] fulfilled
[1:51:07] it's connected directly connected to
[1:51:09] ephesians 3 17 2 19.
[1:51:12] i used this scripture when i the last
[1:51:13] time that i preached
[1:51:15] and it was so much on my heart wanted to
[1:51:17] explain it but i read it didn't explain
[1:51:19] it
[1:51:20] and the next week or a week after but i
[1:51:23] just came right
[1:51:24] and put the same scripture
[1:51:26] and broke it
[1:51:28] into pieces for us
[1:51:29] the bread
[1:51:31] because after i still fell in my heart
[1:51:33] like i didn't give the children's bread
[1:51:34] to them
[1:51:36] and but i just came right back
[1:51:38] and just picked the same scripture
[1:51:41] i would say to the north give up
[1:51:43] and to their self keep not back bring my
[1:51:45] sons
[1:51:46] and i'll add my daughters from afar
[1:51:49] and my daughter's from the ends of the
[1:51:50] earth
[1:51:51] and he just broke it into pieces and
[1:51:53] gave it to the children so glory
[1:51:55] hallelujah i was sitting right here i
[1:51:56] said lord you know my heart
[1:51:58] you were the one who put it on my head
[1:52:00] you see how the ministry is connected is
[1:52:02] the same ministry
[1:52:03] is the same jesus christ but a jack in
[1:52:05] me
[1:52:06] and you in every one of us amen
[1:52:09] so you use brother
[1:52:11] troy to speak the same one
[1:52:13] he's the one who used but a troy and he
[1:52:15] used by the jack to speak the same
[1:52:17] sermon in another way and his brother
[1:52:19] jerry to speak the same same one and his
[1:52:21] brother who is used by brother brother
[1:52:23] but a smiley is the same jesus christ
[1:52:26] amen

[1:52:40] brother joseph amen little preacher god
[1:52:43] bless you
[1:52:45] it's the same holy ghost in us amen
[1:52:47] that's why we have got the mind of
[1:52:49] christ
[1:52:50] and the more we subject ourselves to the
[1:52:52] holy ghost the more the supernatural
[1:52:54] takes place the more we see things amen
[1:52:57] because the lord wants his children to
[1:52:59] be united
[1:53:01] we are many member buddies by the same
[1:53:03] body
[1:53:04] no bodies body
[1:53:07] many members but same what buddy
[1:53:11] let me use science to explain something
[1:53:12] and i told me when you go to medical
[1:53:14] school
[1:53:16] sometimes they give you dead bodies
[1:53:18] maybe you start with rabbits sorry
[1:53:20] guinea pigs and rats and different
[1:53:21] things but ultimately they give you a
[1:53:24] human being i know my cousin was a
[1:53:25] doctor and said the first time they
[1:53:26] tried to shock you they don't tell you
[1:53:28] they've got the dead body's in the room
[1:53:31] so they open this room you follow your
[1:53:32] professor open this room and then you
[1:53:35] come and dead bodies this is for you
[1:53:37] that's your property
[1:53:41] your first day medical school
[1:53:43] and people be sharing and shaking he
[1:53:46] said yes this is welcome to medical
[1:53:48] school you want to be a doctor welcome
[1:53:50] take the dead body we're gonna decide
[1:53:52] that we're gonna start that
[1:53:54] dissection
[1:53:55] from the brain
[1:53:57] you've already learned the anatomy of
[1:53:58] the brain cerebellum
[1:54:00] uh cortex what have you thalamus
[1:54:02] hypothalamus and so on and so forth
[1:54:05] that's the basis but now we are going to
[1:54:07] go to the intricate part of the brain
[1:54:10] maybe you want to be a neurosurgeon you
[1:54:12] have to know all the gray matter
[1:54:14] substantia all those little
[1:54:16] intricate pieces of the brain
[1:54:18] so they chloroform the dead body for you
[1:54:20] and you're gonna start cracking the
[1:54:22] brain open it
[1:54:24] without touching the blood vessels
[1:54:27] and you're gonna go that's why doctors
[1:54:29] true doctors are very patient
[1:54:31] because they go through their training
[1:54:32] their training itself will teach you
[1:54:33] patients
[1:54:34] and you go through the intricate and
[1:54:36] dissect when you finish with your brain
[1:54:38] come to the neck region
[1:54:39] you finish you come to the torso you
[1:54:41] come to the stomach they'll give you a
[1:54:43] kidney i see medical student carrying
[1:54:45] kidneys and lungs and heart in a bottle
[1:54:48] chloroform around investing campuses
[1:54:51] that's your property
[1:54:52] bones give you bones of live bones of
[1:54:54] human beings
[1:54:55] people that die some people give their
[1:54:57] buddies when they die they should be
[1:54:59] used for that some people when they
[1:55:00] can't find a somebody died in us then
[1:55:02] they can't locate they give it to
[1:55:03] medical school and they use it for
[1:55:05] training
[1:55:06] so you see people carrying bones
[1:55:08] and you have to study the bone they're
[1:55:10] intricate they're firm or different than
[1:55:12] how they interlock and they interconnect
[1:55:14] how the brain cells and
[1:55:16] uh what they call it the fibers and
[1:55:18] blood vessels innovate and bring action
[1:55:21] potential and what have you you learn
[1:55:23] all of them
[1:55:24] but remember despite the thousands and
[1:55:27] millions of intricate of the human parts
[1:55:29] is one person
[1:55:30] it's one whole human being
[1:55:32] amen we came from eternity
[1:55:35] different many members
[1:55:37] different attributes by we are one

[1:55:46] hope one faith

[1:58:46] cloud some people believe i remember i
[1:58:48] preached for it some people thought it
[1:58:49] was a reflection of it was a jet plane

[1:58:53] go no mechanical device can go that far
[1:58:56] not even astronauts
[1:58:58] they cannot go that far
[1:59:00] it was almighty god it was you and i
[1:59:03] in the form of pill of fire
[1:59:05] a cloud version if you go to let's read
[1:59:08] um
[1:59:10] revelation
[1:59:11] chapter
[1:59:13] is it
[1:59:14] one
[1:59:18] cloud is talking about cloud
[1:59:20] i think revolution one
[1:59:22] seven
[1:59:23] let's see if i'm right five seven
[1:59:25] somewhere
[1:59:34] please help me thank you ray jack
[1:59:38] the whole he cometh with clouds and
[1:59:41] every eye shall see him
[1:59:43] and they also which pierce him and all
[1:59:45] kinders of the earth shall well because
[1:59:46] of him even so amen amen
[1:59:50] he
[1:59:51] cometh with clouds
[1:59:53] who is he
[1:59:54] the lord jesus christ
[1:59:57] he come up with a clouds in every eye
[1:59:59] the scientists saw him
[2:00:01] sinners saw him
[2:00:02] but then the photo that they took
[2:00:04] they didn't understand
[2:00:06] because it wasn't meant for them it
[2:00:08] wasn't about the brahmo to the picture
[2:00:10] it was a scientist they saw it in their
[2:00:11] computer not only in the us canada
[2:00:13] mexico they saw their observatory they
[2:00:16] turned their computers they say
[2:00:17] something supernatural and they captured
[2:00:20] it took a picture
[2:00:21] and they had it
[2:00:23] turned upside down
[2:00:24] and they brought a copy to the prophet
[2:00:26] and he said turn it upright
[2:00:27] and when they turned upright they saw
[2:00:29] who
[2:00:30] christ
[2:00:31] they saw his beard his face everything
[2:00:34] just like the man who lived two thousand
[2:00:35] plus years ago
[2:00:37] he's here amen he lives in man amen
[2:00:41] and we were there you in that cloud
[2:00:46] glory hallelujah remember i said that
[2:00:48] you were not born in the in in the
[2:00:49] church ages you were born after time
[2:00:52] after the seven we were born in the um
[2:00:55] if i put it in the omega all right
[2:00:57] or even beyond omega
[2:00:59] because christ is the alpha and omega by
[2:01:01] so beyond omega before the beginning he
[2:01:03] was and after the end he will be
[2:01:06] so you and i were there we had the
[2:01:08] ministry we had a commission
[2:01:11] but before we drop on earth we were in
[2:01:12] that celestial dimension
[2:01:14] amen brother solomon you were there
[2:01:17] yes we went through amnesia we don't
[2:01:19] remember physically but we were there
[2:01:21] amen
[2:01:22] were you in christ before the foundation
[2:01:23] of the world
[2:01:25] that was before even time began
[2:01:27] if you could believe that why can't you
[2:01:29] believe that you were in the clouds
[2:01:31] amen paul talked about cloud of witness
[2:01:34] so you had all of you were there
[2:01:37] not in your flesh but in your celestial
[2:01:39] body
[2:01:40] and the lord commissioned you
[2:01:42] to do what you are doing right now amen
[2:01:45] the ministry the lord has for you and so
[2:01:47] at the right time the lord gave you to
[2:01:49] your parents you came the same life the
[2:01:52] celestial life in you
[2:01:54] if you preach if you go to your father
[2:01:56] and operate in your father
[2:01:57] you are not going to see a human being
[2:01:59] it's a life
[2:02:01] but when the time comes for that life to
[2:02:02] fall on earth to come on earth through
[2:02:04] the union of the father and mother the
[2:02:06] woman conceive and even when the baby is
[2:02:08] in the womb the future doesn't have that
[2:02:10] life yet
[2:02:12] it just depends on the life of their
[2:02:13] mother but when it drops that life in
[2:02:15] the cloud dropping the flesh
[2:02:18] and the baby begins to cry
[2:02:20] life has begun
[2:02:22] amen the day you were born
[2:02:25] there was something there was a star
[2:02:27] that crossed in the heavens
[2:02:29] amen
[2:02:30] there was an angel that stood by your
[2:02:32] mother in the hospital where you were
[2:02:34] born
[2:02:35] your mother might not have seen that
[2:02:36] angel
[2:02:37] you might have not have seen that angel
[2:02:39] but it was an angel of the lord because
[2:02:41] you were a seed of god amen you have a
[2:02:44] purpose on earth you say oh i wish my
[2:02:46] mother saw a light light but abraham
[2:02:48] when his mother saw the light and coming
[2:02:50] in because you are not too controversial
[2:02:54] it is easy for you to be believed down
[2:02:56] for willie abraham even with all the
[2:02:59] other other vindication proposals can
[2:03:00] take it
[2:03:02] they can go back to the bible and
[2:03:03] believe paul was a servant of the lord a
[2:03:05] prophet they can go back to moses
[2:03:08] they didn't see moses
[2:03:10] they didn't see where moses was born
[2:03:12] but people are still wondering oh we
[2:03:14] don't find a bridge where he talked
[2:03:16] about the system people fail what has
[2:03:18] bridge got to do with eternal life
[2:03:21] what has breached
[2:03:23] and did got to do with eternal life
[2:03:26] do you have a theophany
[2:03:28] do you have a something in your heart
[2:03:30] that puts you towards the word of the
[2:03:32] lord
[2:03:33] look there was that in egypt they didn't
[2:03:35] have a bible in the time of jew
[2:03:38] it was moses that began to put something
[2:03:40] on on a what do you call it on scroll
[2:03:42] and on rocks and different things the
[2:03:44] lord began to write prince they used the
[2:03:46] zodiac
[2:03:48] they didn't have is that
[2:03:49] i think one is that the bravo make us
[2:03:51] like a
[2:03:52] kind of a like like a king we want to
[2:03:54] always lean on a cane but there are
[2:03:56] certain times that you are the bible
[2:03:58] amen
[2:04:00] and so the lord ordained you
[2:04:02] there was a cross of the star and give
[2:04:04] you the glory that is god in you amen
[2:04:07] because you have a purpose on earth a
[2:04:09] commission
[2:04:10] and when your prayers were brought
[2:04:11] before for you to understand the law of
[2:04:12] contrast to understand the negative the
[2:04:15] switch the switch has got the binary
[2:04:16] system negative
[2:04:18] light off and light on you went through
[2:04:20] the negative you were born in sin and
[2:04:22] shaping iniquity
[2:04:23] but then at the right time
[2:04:25] when the light in you begin to show
[2:04:27] himself he put on the on switch
[2:04:30] and you got a new breath it's like a
[2:04:31] whole brand new world has been open to
[2:04:33] you
[2:04:34] you could speak
[2:04:35] miracles could come before you were born
[2:04:37] again you did understand miracles what
[2:04:38] is miracles when you are sick the first
[2:04:41] thing you think about go to hospital
[2:04:43] but when something in you when they
[2:04:45] switch the on switch begin to take place
[2:04:48] you can believe healing
[2:04:50] you can receive healing for yourself
[2:04:52] you can speak your healing into
[2:04:53] existence
[2:04:55] you can speak cancer out of lives
[2:04:57] you can speak whatever sickness out of
[2:04:59] life
[2:05:00] the lord allow you to go through it to
[2:05:02] understand jesus christ was all in all
[2:05:05] but he came to the earth
[2:05:07] to experience humanity
[2:05:09] sickness suffering crying shame pain
[2:05:12] so that he can be a redeemer so are you
[2:05:15] amen
[2:05:17] you are a redeemer amen but you have to
[2:05:20] go to redemption first and be redeemed
[2:05:23] then you can understand the law of
[2:05:24] redemption
[2:05:25] and you can bring redemption to other
[2:05:28] people around
[2:05:29] amen glory hallelujah you understand if
[2:05:32] you have never been sick before
[2:05:35] if you've never been poor before you
[2:05:36] understand why is every why why are
[2:05:38] these people poor
[2:05:40] but if you've been homeless before
[2:05:41] you've been poor before you can
[2:05:43] understand you can associate yourself
[2:05:44] with them amen so the lord allow you to
[2:05:47] go through what you went through in all
[2:05:49] your predestination everything about you
[2:05:51] was predecessor by god
[2:05:53] he knows the hair the number of hairs on
[2:05:55] your head
[2:05:56] amen he knows the right parents to give
[2:05:58] to you
[2:05:59] you could have come through a different
[2:06:01] mother right you could have come to a
[2:06:03] different father
[2:06:04] but it couldn't be you had exact right
[2:06:06] perfect parents
[2:06:08] say oh my parents were no good yes they
[2:06:09] were perfect for your calling
[2:06:12] amen
[2:06:14] john the baptist's father died
[2:06:16] early but that was the perfect condition
[2:06:18] for john the baptist
[2:06:20] esther lost both parents but that was
[2:06:21] the perfect condition for her
[2:06:24] my father wasn't there for me that was
[2:06:25] the preference so that you can look up
[2:06:26] to jesus christ as your father
[2:06:29] my mother wasn't there for me perfect
[2:06:31] glory hallelujah so that you can look at
[2:06:33] the new jerusalem as your mother amen
[2:06:36] so whatever happened to you is part of
[2:06:38] your commission
[2:06:40] glory hallelujah and if you can take it
[2:06:42] at all glory you right above the clouds
[2:06:45] of circumstances
[2:06:47] because whatever is happening to you
[2:06:49] happened to you is for your calling and
[2:06:51] your commission
[2:06:52] amen and there's nothing out of cater
[2:06:55] amen
[2:06:57] there's nothing absolutely nothing

[2:07:04] esther it was too long but esther became
[2:07:06] the queen

[2:08:19] wherefore seeing we also are compassed
[2:08:22] about with so great a clown of witnesses

[2:08:45] sometimes it's a star
[2:08:46] an angel
[2:08:48] because it's of another dimension

[2:10:53] sometimes stretch you a little bit
[2:10:55] beyond what you are used to amen let me
[2:10:57] read my last scripture here
[2:10:59] i think have you read it already
[2:11:01] uh let's see where's the scripture
[2:11:06] praise god hallelujah
[2:11:08] height length breath okay let me see
[2:11:10] glory hallelujah
[2:11:12] we're getting closer running up
[2:11:13] efficiency
[2:11:15] it was efficient 17 15 oh sorry
[2:11:17] ephesians 3 17 to 19
[2:11:20] length breath height
[2:11:22] oh three yes i think we've read that
[2:11:23] already haven't oh we didn't okay thank
[2:11:25] you read for us ephesians 3 17-19
[2:11:30] praise god
[2:11:31] that christ may dwell in your hearts by
[2:11:34] faith that ye being rooted and grounded
[2:11:36] in love may be able to comprehend with
[2:11:39] all all saints what is the breadth and
[2:11:42] length and depth and height
[2:11:44] and to know the love of christ which
[2:11:46] passive knowledge
[2:11:47] that you might be filled with all the
[2:11:49] fullness of god amen who might be fooled
[2:11:52] you
[2:11:54] might be filled
[2:11:55] was it you know we know the bible just
[2:11:57] had what the fullness of the lord
[2:11:59] fullness of god had bodily dwell in
[2:12:01] jesus right
[2:12:02] but now he said that you
[2:12:05] might be filled
[2:12:06] with the fullness of the lord so is it
[2:12:08] wrong to say that you have been filled
[2:12:10] with the affordance of the lord no
[2:12:12] that is your very
[2:12:13] very word of the lord for you that is
[2:12:15] your commission that you and i
[2:12:18] might be filled with the fullness of the
[2:12:20] lord because without the fullness
[2:12:22] partiality we can accomplish things the
[2:12:24] way it should be accomplished but when
[2:12:25] you have the fullness this is that
[2:12:26] richard you stand as a daughter of god
[2:12:28] and you speak and your word is as elohim
[2:12:31] speaking because you are elohim amen in
[2:12:33] west palm beach amen
[2:12:35] glory hallelujah so we comprehend all
[2:12:37] the sin the breath
[2:12:39] the length the death and height what is
[2:12:41] the height let me start with the height
[2:12:44] the height is how much you can receive
[2:12:45] from the lord
[2:12:47] the degree
[2:12:48] how much you can contain the lord want
[2:12:50] to pour all his fullness in you
[2:12:52] will you be able to receive it
[2:12:54] that's your height
[2:12:57] what is the length
[2:12:59] the length is okay let me go to the
[2:13:01] death the death is how you are rooted
[2:13:04] in the word of the lord
[2:13:06] in the revelation of jesus christ your
[2:13:08] root you stand frame that in terms of
[2:13:10] when the wind is blowing you are not
[2:13:12] shaking you're sustana
[2:13:14] you stand strong you know who you are
[2:13:16] amen
[2:13:17] the winds are blowing and people are
[2:13:18] running helter skelter but you are
[2:13:20] standing strong and tight because you
[2:13:22] know who you are amen coronavirus is not
[2:13:25] shaking you

[2:13:28] government and policies do not shake you
[2:13:31] orders of the land doesn't shake you
[2:13:33] the cosmos order doesn't shake you
[2:13:35] because you are the logos not just you
[2:13:38] have the logos but you are the logos
[2:13:41] the mind of jesus christ
[2:13:43] amen
[2:13:44] so you are rooted in the word that's why
[2:13:46] we come to hear the word the teachings
[2:13:48] work by the jack teachers
[2:13:50] prayer praying in the family amen oh
[2:13:52] glory
[2:13:54] what about their breath
[2:13:56] their breath is how much you can give
[2:13:59] to people
[2:14:00] how much you have
[2:14:02] you have received
[2:14:03] and now you are rooted now you have to
[2:14:05] what give
[2:14:08] and the length is how much can you be
[2:14:10] stretched
[2:14:13] like the ego
[2:14:15] the ego has to they said some of the
[2:14:16] eagles have got i think 14
[2:14:18] feet right
[2:14:20] they construct themselves and there'll
[2:14:22] be a storm that should have swept them
[2:14:24] somewhere but the eagle
[2:14:26] will be standing and stretch his wings
[2:14:29] and fly and go above the storm because
[2:14:32] the ego was born and commissioned for
[2:14:34] that purpose amen glory last night i was
[2:14:37] stretched a little bit let me give an
[2:14:38] experience

[2:17:32] that you have to stretch length to
[2:17:34] measure length height breath
[2:17:36] and death
[2:17:37] so the lord will let you stretch being a
[2:17:40] person that you might be you must be
[2:17:41] what instant in season and what out of
[2:17:44] season even midnight if you have to
[2:17:46] preach me 20 minutes you have to preach
[2:17:48] me 20 minutes
[2:17:50] so
[2:17:51] sometimes in your life not everything's
[2:17:52] going to be comfortable for you
[2:17:55] certain things will not be your comfort
[2:17:56] zone but it's the law that is stretching
[2:17:58] you
[2:17:59] because you are here to learn measure
[2:18:01] height not the physical height but how
[2:18:03] much more of the lord you can give to
[2:18:06] others
[2:18:07] how much more can you sacrifice your
[2:18:08] time your resources
[2:18:12] your word your wisdom your whatever
[2:18:15] sometimes in your family you sacrifice
[2:18:17] things for the name of the lord amen
[2:18:20] sometimes we talk about great men let me
[2:18:21] use by the brown for example i'm done
[2:18:23] and how much is sacrifice
[2:18:26] sometimes he said you travel and
[2:18:28] when you get to people already vehicles
[2:18:31] around his house
[2:18:33] and he has to sacrifice and pray for the
[2:18:35] sick people they are waiting for him to
[2:18:37] be prayed for he doesn't even get to see
[2:18:39] his family first there's already prayer
[2:18:41] line around his home people that have
[2:18:43] got cancer different issue and before he
[2:18:46] goes to see his wife and daughters he
[2:18:48] has to take care of these people
[2:18:50] there was a time that sister who uh
[2:18:52] sister
[2:18:53] mida
[2:18:54] she cooked for people
[2:18:56] people traveling to to a home she cooked
[2:18:58] for all of them but her own children had
[2:19:00] not eaten
[2:19:01] and the kids were crying and she almost
[2:19:04] had a nervous breakdown
[2:19:05] but the lord
[2:19:07] has a purpose but bram came back home
[2:19:09] and his wife had broken down it was just
[2:19:11] too much for her and she was crying and
[2:19:13] she's just changing change himself and
[2:19:16] when to cut onions
[2:19:17] and trying to change the atmosphere amen
[2:19:21] you pick an onion cut it and start
[2:19:23] talking to the wife and all the pain
[2:19:25] begin to you know subside and said i'm
[2:19:27] going to buy you a dress he said i don't
[2:19:29] billy i don't need a dress oh yes i've
[2:19:30] seen this dress and it's so beautiful
[2:19:32] and what have you trying to change the
[2:19:34] atmosphere
[2:19:36] because you are christ amen
[2:19:38] wherever you are there is peace
[2:19:40] and it wasn't too long since amida was
[2:19:42] giggling and laughing and happy
[2:19:44] he chained the atmosphere by cutting
[2:19:45] onions and talking to her and buying
[2:19:48] even promised to buy a dress when she
[2:19:49] didn't even need a dress
[2:19:51] amen
[2:19:52] that attribute is still in you amen i
[2:19:55] remember when we're in the old church i
[2:19:57] talk about families
[2:19:58] and their children
[2:20:00] that the children they are yours and
[2:20:02] they are not yours
[2:20:04] they are gods amen
[2:20:06] they are gifts of the lord to you
[2:20:08] and they are yours because they are your
[2:20:10] children earthly speaking but they are
[2:20:12] beyond you your biological
[2:20:14] uh genetic connection
[2:20:17] they are the almighty's property amen
[2:20:20] and you're going to spend some of your
[2:20:21] time
[2:20:22] not only to work for them and feed them
[2:20:24] but to speak to them amen but a jail
[2:20:27] cannot do it all the ministers cannot do
[2:20:29] it all
[2:20:30] what has been preached the way the tips
[2:20:32] whatever
[2:20:33] break it down to your children
[2:20:36] and i said that as a family it doesn't
[2:20:38] matter how long you know your time take
[2:20:40] one children you and your wife to the
[2:20:42] park
[2:20:43] somewhere outside the house
[2:20:45] and let them know
[2:20:47] talk to them about the way that is
[2:20:49] preached to them
[2:20:50] what do you want to use your life for
[2:20:52] not talking about being an engineer
[2:20:54] being a doctor they're all great and
[2:20:55] dandy being nurses being a teacher
[2:20:58] being a whatever but do you not ask them
[2:21:00] do you know the mind of christ for you
[2:21:03] my son my daughter have you thought
[2:21:05] about god's plan for your life
[2:21:07] just the thought they might not
[2:21:08] understand it all
[2:21:09] but it's in your heart
[2:21:11] as much as mother did
[2:21:13] joe kebab was a typical example
[2:21:16] he taught moses when they were in the
[2:21:17] palace of pharaoh now moses
[2:21:20] whatever you do
[2:21:21] remember you were born a deliverer
[2:21:26] moses didn't see the angel of the people
[2:21:27] of fire come into their mother's room
[2:21:29] but their mother and their father saw
[2:21:30] the pillar of fire themselves
[2:21:32] just like what's the name of the uh just
[2:21:34] like samson's mother when the end of the
[2:21:36] lord came to commission them that you're
[2:21:37] gonna have a son no result shall touch
[2:21:40] his head he shouldn't drink wine and you
[2:21:43] shouldn't go near dead body and
[2:21:44] different things
[2:21:45] the same thing your children are god's
[2:21:47] personal property
[2:21:49] and you have to be smart than the devil
[2:21:52] because the world want to put all the
[2:21:54] garbage in them
[2:21:55] through school
[2:21:56] phone internet friends pierce what have
[2:21:59] you
[2:22:00] but then you have to put all christ in
[2:22:02] them
[2:22:03] before even the devil can get close to
[2:22:04] them
[2:22:05] amen
[2:22:07] and it's when they are younger and
[2:22:08] tender their mind is fatter they can
[2:22:10] take more than when they get to 21 or
[2:22:13] even now before 21 when they get to 18
[2:22:15] or even before 80 when they go to 16 or
[2:22:18] even before 16 when they get to 14
[2:22:21] when the devil has taught them so much
[2:22:24] and they want to experience an
[2:22:25] experiment because every child has got a
[2:22:27] curious mind
[2:22:29] why if you try to tell a child don't
[2:22:30] touch this stuff
[2:22:32] that's the person she's going to touch
[2:22:33] he's going to touch why don't why why is
[2:22:35] that he telling me let me see he's not
[2:22:37] around
[2:22:38] let me see when they get then oh okay
[2:22:40] now they learn by risk good and they
[2:22:42] learn by the their reason is not
[2:22:44] developed but cause and effect is how
[2:22:46] children learn
[2:22:47] that's why we teach children cause and
[2:22:49] in fact if you do this
[2:22:50] this will happen to you
[2:22:52] they don't understand why so much they
[2:22:53] ask why even if you experience something
[2:22:55] they don't understand but if they know
[2:22:56] their cause and effect
[2:22:58] no that he said don't touch it if he is
[2:23:00] going to bend you he's going to tell his
[2:23:01] brothers okay then because of the
[2:23:03] burning they won't touch it and as they
[2:23:06] grow their reasoning will develop and
[2:23:08] they will understand it more so parents
[2:23:10] god has given their children to you as a
[2:23:11] property
[2:23:13] it just came on my on my heart just to
[2:23:15] tell the church again
[2:23:17] that your children don't wait
[2:23:19] till they get 18 to get 20 but when they
[2:23:22] are tender even when they are one years
[2:23:24] old
[2:23:25] preach to them speak to them pray over
[2:23:28] them night and day amen
[2:23:31] don't think the church is enough oh yes
[2:23:33] i'll bring them to the chair but the
[2:23:34] jack is my pastor glory hallelujah
[2:23:37] but then when you take them outside the
[2:23:38] church do you know what happens to them
[2:23:42] when they go to school jack is not the
[2:23:43] one who teaches them at school
[2:23:46] if they go to school they learn things
[2:23:48] that you don't know
[2:23:50] they have things in their backpack that
[2:23:51] you don't have an idea
[2:23:54] they receive text message from their
[2:23:55] friends that you don't have a clue
[2:23:57] so you have to be way ahead of the game
[2:24:00] it's like the game of chess you have to
[2:24:02] think ahead of time
[2:24:04] whatever game you have to think it's
[2:24:05] like businessmen they think about the
[2:24:07] market corona they are thinking about
[2:24:09] five years
[2:24:10] 20 years where to invest their money how
[2:24:13] the the business world is going to
[2:24:14] change because of the covet so we as
[2:24:16] christians we have to we are eagles amen
[2:24:20] we've got that faculty we're beyond the
[2:24:22] world supernaturally so we have to think
[2:24:24] way ahead of the devil and be the devil
[2:24:27] in on his own ground amen
[2:24:29] by the way that has been preached to you
[2:24:32] ask them do you have a pro what is your
[2:24:33] purpose on in life
[2:24:36] not about being engineer being a doctor
[2:24:38] that is good
[2:24:40] but spiritual what do you think god has
[2:24:41] for you
[2:24:42] daddy i don't know mama i don't know
[2:24:44] okay daughter that's what you should
[2:24:46] pray about
[2:24:47] son that's what you pray about
[2:24:49] i cannot tell you
[2:24:50] i know god has purpose for you but i
[2:24:52] don't know god is going to make you a
[2:24:53] preacher or make you a housewife or make
[2:24:56] you a mother and make you a prayer
[2:24:58] warrior so son daughter pray about it
[2:25:01] let's pray and you pray with her
[2:25:03] that thing will be inscribed on her
[2:25:04] heart or on inside the rest of your life
[2:25:07] even when you are in glory your son or
[2:25:10] remember that when i was two years old
[2:25:12] when i was three i remember certain
[2:25:13] things when i was two years old
[2:25:15] in africa they put babies at the back i
[2:25:17] remember i was at the back of my mother
[2:25:19] and i remember
[2:25:21] so don't think children did might not be
[2:25:22] able to say it but they remember
[2:25:25] and if you plant in them they might not
[2:25:27] understand on their mind they have a few
[2:25:29] funny that you funny captures
[2:25:31] and the more you plant the more it
[2:25:33] captures and the more fruit is going to
[2:25:35] be
[2:25:36] it doesn't matter how far they go they
[2:25:38] can go to the north they can go to the
[2:25:40] south but what you planted will never
[2:25:42] leave them
[2:25:43] it will chase them overtake them and
[2:25:44] bring them back
[2:25:46] amen
[2:25:47] so you need to sow in their children to
[2:25:50] me that is the most important thing that
[2:25:51] parents need to do

[2:28:05] who is going to tell them that they
[2:28:07] should go and drink
[2:28:08] when is seeking holy ghost
[2:28:11] do you think a thief somebody who's a
[2:28:13] thief
[2:28:14] comes to your house
[2:28:16] and the thief
[2:28:17] asks you to pray for him he's going to
[2:28:18] steal
[2:28:20] and you want to be successful in his

[2:28:47] i won't rob the bank i'd rather go and
[2:28:49] work and get my money
[2:28:51] so when you take the children through
[2:28:52] that channel of supernatural the lord
[2:28:54] takes them over
[2:28:56] your job is done
[2:28:57] but if you don't take them through that
[2:28:59] channel
[2:29:00] and the devil is going like this he's
[2:29:02] watching
[2:29:03] now they are kissed the innocent
[2:29:05] he's watching them trying to find his
[2:29:06] showing a lot of things in them that you
[2:29:08] don't know
[2:29:09] and you don't know that those trees
[2:29:10] growing because you have not planned you
[2:29:11] haven't planted nothing
[2:29:13] you leave them to chance
[2:29:15] and then when the time comes
[2:29:16] that the enemy will use them fully then
[2:29:18] they will take over their lives
[2:29:20] but when you plant them and you point
[2:29:22] them always
[2:29:24] god holy ghost prayers pray eating pray
[2:29:28] at night go to the room and pray for
[2:29:29] them
[2:29:30] wives husbands do it
[2:29:32] and when you bombard them with the holy
[2:29:34] ghost even mentally they're gonna know
[2:29:37] that why does my daddy come to pray for

[2:31:34] praise the lord
[2:31:36] how we appreciate uh brother kwaku
[2:31:40] uh um there was
[2:31:43] a lot
[2:31:45] and that sermon um my notebook is quite
[2:31:48] full
[2:31:50] and um
[2:31:52] but there was a couple things i just
[2:31:53] want to um just make a quick
[2:31:57] mention of and
[2:31:59] he was talking about
[2:32:01] redemption being inside of us
[2:32:04] and i think i don't know if it was i
[2:32:06] think it was this week
[2:32:07] i was teaching on
[2:32:09] on wednesday
[2:32:10] um on this
[2:32:13] international type thing that i do i
[2:32:14] teach in in the mornings and i also
[2:32:17] listen to some of the other brothers
[2:32:18] that teach but my
[2:32:20] my i had to teach on wednesday and i've
[2:32:21] been teaching through
[2:32:24] revelation 10 verse 8 through 11.
[2:32:27] and
[2:32:27] what the lord had showed me is like when
[2:32:29] john
[2:32:30] in revelation 5 he he was looking at
[2:32:33] this book
[2:32:34] and there was no one that was able to
[2:32:36] take the book and to loose the seals
[2:32:38] thereof and john began to weep he began
[2:32:40] to cry begin to
[2:32:41] just get emotional like man nobody could
[2:32:44] even nobody can even just look at the
[2:32:46] book
[2:32:47] so uh he heard the
[2:32:49] voice a man of one of the elders say
[2:32:51] we've not the lion of the tribe of judah
[2:32:54] has prevailed to take the book
[2:32:56] and delusion seals thereof
[2:32:58] and uh and when john looked he saw a
[2:33:00] lamb
[2:33:01] well that same book showed up in
[2:33:02] revelation 10 and it came with an angel
[2:33:06] that had one foot on land one foot on
[2:33:07] the sea and he had an open book in order
[2:33:10] to reveal it to us and that's through
[2:33:11] the ministry of brother branham but when
[2:33:14] you get to verse 8 through 11 that same
[2:33:16] book
[2:33:18] john is told to go and eat the book
[2:33:22] so the same book that he couldn't look
[2:33:24] on is now
[2:33:26] in him
[2:33:28] and that book that john could look at
[2:33:31] that no man could look at no man could
[2:33:33] look upon that book was the book of
[2:33:35] redemption
[2:33:37] and when john ate the book now the book
[2:33:39] of redemption is inside of john
[2:33:42] john represents us as the bride of
[2:33:44] christ
[2:33:45] redemption
[2:33:47] lives
[2:33:48] in us
[2:33:53] as he was talking there about
[2:33:57] you know just just
[2:33:59] parents and just working with your kids
[2:34:01] and just
[2:34:02] planning certain things in them at a
[2:34:04] very young age
[2:34:06] and it's all about purpose you know they
[2:34:08] used to have a saying when i was coming
[2:34:09] up
[2:34:10] only
[2:34:13] what you do for christ
[2:34:15] will last
[2:34:18] so song says only what you do for him
[2:34:20] will be counted in the end only what you
[2:34:23] do for christ will last and you know
[2:34:25] oftentimes we we we want to be so
[2:34:27] accomplished in the things of the world
[2:34:30] but if we forget if we forget
[2:34:33] that there's a greater purpose to our
[2:34:35] existence than amen what we accomplish
[2:34:37] in this world and then we've messed up
[2:34:39] we've missed the point
[2:34:41] but uh you know he was just just kind of
[2:34:42] talking about that and and there was a
[2:34:45] a little story that i heard here
[2:34:47] recently we want to we want to do things
[2:34:49] and say things that will change lives
[2:34:52] that's that's that's the real purpose
[2:34:54] what god got us and we want to change
[2:34:55] lives and just re just this morning
[2:34:57] somebody sent me a little text and and
[2:34:59] it was um a story of um
[2:35:02] i believe it was three preachers or
[2:35:03] three missionaries that was going into a
[2:35:05] certain city to visit and uh and when
[2:35:08] they got there there was a judge i
[2:35:09] believe a police officer and a jailer
[2:35:12] that were there at the uh at the city so
[2:35:14] one preacher jumped up he started
[2:35:15] preaching judge ordered police officers
[2:35:18] take him and put him in jail
[2:35:19] and uh the next one you know why they
[2:35:21] got him handcuffed him the next one
[2:35:23] jumped they'll say i'm gonna take off
[2:35:24] i'm gonna pick up where he left off and
[2:35:25] i'm gonna take and i'm gonna start
[2:35:26] preaching judge order take him put him
[2:35:28] in jail
[2:35:30] and then the third one said well y'all
[2:35:31] got them two in jail i'm jump up i'ma
[2:35:33] start preaching too he said take him and
[2:35:35] put him in jail
[2:35:36] so all three of these preachers are now
[2:35:38] in jail and when they got to jail they
[2:35:39] began to make so much noise in the jail
[2:35:41] the the
[2:35:42] the judge said you got to separate them
[2:35:44] they got to stop all that noise put one
[2:35:46] over here and two over there just do
[2:35:47] something get get get stop all the noise
[2:35:49] so they stopped the noise and they
[2:35:51] thought they stopped the noise and uh
[2:35:53] they took the two of them and put them
[2:35:55] in in another cell and they happened to
[2:35:56] put in the cell of a man that was a
[2:35:58] robber
[2:35:59] and as they put them in the cell uh them
[2:36:01] preachers got to preaching to that man
[2:36:03] that was arriving next thing you know
[2:36:04] the man got converted he start making
[2:36:06] more noise than they was making and then
[2:36:08] the judge said i thought i thought i
[2:36:10] told you to separate them they're still
[2:36:11] making all this noise stop stop him he
[2:36:14] says no if we keep separating them
[2:36:15] they're going to make more noise because
[2:36:16] they're going to convert everybody
[2:36:20] see our purpose our very purpose
[2:36:23] is here to reach somebody else i i just
[2:36:26] brother branham said you know you get to
[2:36:27] the other side
[2:36:30] and you'll see a halo hanging over
[2:36:31] somebody's head
[2:36:33] and realize it's
[2:36:34] there because you had something to do
[2:36:36] with it
[2:36:40] god help us to to do what we've been
[2:36:42] called to do

[2:37:00] house and and grabbing that apron and
[2:37:02] doing
[2:37:04] just doing everything that he could for

[2:37:08] became god
[2:37:11] i became god
[2:37:14] in that situation
[2:37:16] and oftentimes that's where we need to
[2:37:18] see god in some of the
[2:37:20] most difficult situations in our homes
[2:37:22] and in our families
[2:37:25] god help us
