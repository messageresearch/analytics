brother Joe jr. man just holding down the song server supposed to make up bless you brother thank you so much this one also thank the Lord again for the pastor's coming bringing their churches and support these services man brother Westco so good to have him as sister Westco advance of the sanctuary rather than faith my sister Church and then brother and sister steamin came with some of the Saints from Sarasota and praise the Lord we certainly appreciate them dear friends and and I didn't realize my wife reminded me that brother Steven and sisters statement celebrated an anniversary yesterday is that right have the anniversary [Applause] certainly certainly appreciate them so brother Jean and sister Jean they man thank God for the Church of Boynton Beach and they're celebrating their anniversary on tomorrow a man so praise the Lord for them smiling a man so good to have my brother-in-law in the house pastor smiling well I'm not gonna take too much time we we certainly enjoyed ourselves this morning brother Nathan the latter glory a man so many little nuggets that that was there and you know I my previous job a man was you know let's just say a nice-size church and now brother Nathan made a comer says I'd rather be in this old maker Church than be in any megachurch I say oh yeah the love play on words there right old make up rather than Mecca Omega you choose which one you're gonna be in a man so I mean I was just I was just just being filled up over there and I appreciate this how the Lord used them just to speak to our hearts on this morning and I felt like man if it started out like that then what does the Lord haven't stolen for some tonight and I believe that the Lord's gonna use his servant brother Dwayne Lawson a man just administer to our hearts we thank God for him and his wife like I mentioned to you both of these brothers were traveling a man pretty late to get here brother Nathan got in last night him and his wife and his daughter having about flight landed at 11:30 you know here in West Palm and it goes straight to the hotel and gets up this morning and delivers a wonderful sermon and I'm brother brother Dwayne he's just getting back from India preached at home on Thursday night got up to catch a flight on Friday morning and they brought him from Ohio to Tampa and then they drove three and a half hours from Tampa to get here to West Palm Beach so that's a that's a big load and what I find is that you know typically the ministers the guest ministers they they go through the hardest time just to get to where they're trying to go to that was just give them the hardest time but you know what that's that's when we see God's greatest glory amen his gifts are used a man when they have to depend on praise the Lord so we thank God for these brothers that impressed Amen to make it here and tonight we're going to welcome a man I precious brother Dewayne Lawson to the pulpit a man would just we trusted the Lord we use him in whatever way he desires whenever we invite ministers to come we want them to take their Liberty and men that have freedom just to preach what the Lord lays in their heart a man we don't we don't put any stipulations on that only thing that we these meetings are called light to fire again and you know there are some things that just been in my spirit for a little bit and have just been kind of writing a little inspiration for about a year and there's a quote there in the church age book where brother Branham just kind of talks about that it talks about how the revival starts out in one generation and man is just it's I mean everybody's so blessed Bobby said but the second generation comes along then the fire begins to dim down they say the third generation he said is just immersed in verse then he said in the fourth generation which I believe this is that fourth generation third or fourth generation that's what we're looking at right now so in the fourth generation he says there's no vestige of the original flame and it says that now when you look at that word vestige it means no trace and this was the only generation that I saw where people were questioning why we voted the prophet they didn't do that in my generation we a man we didn't have a problem quoting the Prophet right and there was before me they didn't have a problem quoting a prophet but when it got to the fourth generation they had a problem but in the quote goes on brother Branham didn't stop they say thank God and that's why I believe we are we in the dead god season then God lights the fire again so that's what my expectation is it somebody's fire is going to be lit in the fourth generation and I'm gonna be right here to experience it right along with you hey man I'm on the expectation so let's stand to our feet hey man unless welcome brother the way Lawson to the full feet on tonight I see [Music] ah [Music] amazing [Music] [Music] hey man do you love him tonight hey man do you know about the grace of God I tell you it's a powerful thing to to know about the grace of God and what is done for us say man we want to say God bless you sure a privilege to see some of you once again I've been a years and the smiley had been wrong time since we've been down to his place and seeing some new faces here tonight brother Wisco god bless you nice to meet you and my friend brother Danny's here tonight we surely appreciate him and thank him so much for coming and I remember going to brother jeans but I bet it's been I bet it's been fifteen years ago something you might remember it but but I must have not impressed him he didn't remember me being there but maybe he's had a couple people come by since in the last 15 years they've met so we give you guys anyway so we want to say God bless you and we sure Thank You brethren for coming here tonight and bringing your people and supporting the ministry in meetings and in I thank God but these men of God that holds this word a man it's there's nothing more precious than these ministers who will preach this word and establish it in the heart of the people a man in this generation that we're living in we want to say that we enjoyed the meeting this morning brother Nathan letting the Holy Spirit my man he he put pressure on Paul amen and so we just want to say God bless him and his watch I an we won't say that we appreciate them and I've had my wife Carissa here with me tonight and we think if we could tonight let's just go to the Lord in a word of Prayer we're just gonna speak to him and and I I'm one believer that believes the things that a prophet says and he said there's power in the hands of believers he said that when you got born again he said that God took out the cosmic light and put in an eternal light and that light is inside every believer in this building tonight and I and one believer who believes that you're the most powerful force on the face of the earth is a believer more powerful than any atom weapon more powerful than any machine guns bombs or anything is a believer a man and so we want to tonight to to engage that power and in the hands of a believer the Prophet said the greatest power we have is prayer so we're gonna ask you just for a moment to take to take the hands and maybe just lay it on someone next to you there and I'm gonna ask you to pray with me and I'm gonna ask you to pray with your believing friends here next to you and ask ask God to do something in this meeting tonight above just having a church service that's the Holy Spirit to touch that brother next to you that sister next to you and answer the needs of their heart and their life father we bow our hearts here tonight and we call upon the name of Jesus Christ Lord that through that name Lord there is salvation there is power there is Liberty Lord there is every need to be met in that name now father we come here tonight as the sons and daughters of God we are not plead our worthiness we're not pleading our abilities but what we're pleading the blood of Jesus Christ that paid the payments Lord for every redemptive blessing Lord now we pray tonight father may the blessing of Abraham come upon this place upon these hearts upon these lives and father we pray that you would heal the sick we pray father that you would set the the very bound at Liberty tonight and may you take it open the blinded eyes and father may you touch the need of your children father some here need the Holy Ghost and I pray that you would open the windows of heaven tonight and pour out a blessing upon this place tonight father I pray O God that may you give a fresh experience Lord may you light the fires across this building and may they burn Lord like an ember father made me like a house afire on a windy day may they burn and unstoppable in unquenchable fire father we commit this meeting tonight we commit this service in your hands and we ask you God father do that which is exceedingly and abundantly above even what we could think about or what we could ask of you God pour out your blessing pour out your anointing Lord Jesus we welcome you here tonight we welcome you in this place O God and we give you preeminence O Lord we give you the right away tonight father we commit it Lord in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and the bride said a man Soviet Lord a man and a man we won't - tonight to turn in our Bibles say man and to read from the word of the Lord and want to read from the book of of Corinthians 2nd Corinthians chapter 4 and we want to read the 18th of verse second Corinthians chapter 4 and 18 a man I I love this this Bible it is the written word of God a man and it's the seeds of life in 2nd Corinthians 4 and verse 18 Paul will say while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal now Paul didn't say that we shouldn't look but he said that we should look but look to the unseen a man and I believe if you're going to look to the unseen Amen the Bible said in the book of Hebrews the eleventh chapter that Moses seemed the unseen and I believe it's possible to see the unseen let's look at Hebrews the eleventh chapter if we can and let's read the first verse Hebrews eleven and one now faith it is the substance of things hoped for it is the evidence of things not seen or the proof of the unseen Amen the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report and through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God so that things which are seen were made of things which do which do appear amen let's read that again of things which are seen were not made of things which do appear a man we asked the Lord to bless his word tonight as you may be seated amen we want to just take a few minutes this evening and speak to you from this text of Scripture and I I wonder if I take a title tonight I want to speak to you about the brides the bride's reality amen the bride's reality and I do acknowledge that we have a different reality than the world that we're living in amen but the world that we're living in a man is living in a in an imaginary realm in a world that they think things are real but they're really not real because they're soon going to disappear a man and we just want to speak to you a few minutes here the brides reality's a man waiting Jesus 1963 the prophet of God said I think he said Christians the whole armor of Christianity is faith and everything that we have is unseen of course you remember Apostle Paul will say possessing all having all things but possessing possessing all things yet having nothing amen so the things that you have is actually unseen the only things that's real is unseen and unexplained the things that can be explained are not real they're superficial and they die but the things that cannot be explained or immortal see the whole round now look at the army of Christianity love now love and joy and faith and long-suffering and patience none of these things see you can't see them they're unseen but yet we believe them amen things that you possess love and joy and patience are kind of see you can't see them but you have them amen and you possess them now do you see God is always supernatural amen to identify God in his carest expeller and talks about how you can watch a bird fly a certain way and you can see the bird fly and some people say well there goes a but there goes the raw but just by the way they fly a duck hunters you know and they know the difference from a duck from from a woodpecker just in the way that it flies it has a certain caressed ik amen and we know that God has a terroristic you can identify him because God is a supernatural and God works in the supernatural amen I love how sometimes you hear things like always God is always supernatural amen and as long as there is a God there is a supernatural amen it's Jehovah God the proper to tell us in Jehovah Jireh that God's callings are supernatural amen God calls you supernaturally all the things that God has did he calls he calls supernatural in the paradox brother Ram says see the paradox is the supernatural hey man you know what a paradox is a paradox is something that is actually true amen it's incredible but it is true it's incredible to think but it's true how Joshua could stop the Sun now that's incredible but it is true amen Mary can have a baby and never know a man that's incredible but it is true amen Moses could part the Red Sea it's incredible but it's true one man can feed five thousand with a couple pieces of bread in the fish it's incredible but it is true amen and we were to recognize that God is the God of the supernatural he is a paradox you cannot explain it you cannot see it but it's true he meant you can understand how God does what he does but he does it because that it's true amen and we find that there is a paradox in God amen and it is a supernatural now you got to recognize when you come to the Church of the Living God and you and you come to hear the word of God and you come expecting now I believe in expectation say men I believe you get what you expect I believe that amen I believe that you get what you expect from God but look right brother ma'am said it like this if you come expecting and you'll get something from God and he said but now if you come looking for something to criticize you're gonna get something amen he meant because God is gonna give you an expectation but if you're coming to criticize the devil's gonna meet your expectation so so you're always going to get your expectation min if you're looking for something wrong the devil will be sure you find something wrong Haven but if you're looking for the blessings of God God will be sure that you get something from God hey Ben hey man I my voice is a little bit weak so you keep your monitors and I appreciate it amen and we look and see that God is the God of the supernatural now when the church comes expecting and they begin to pull upon the Word of God amen many times we misunderstand and we think that we're pulling on the man in the pulpit he meant but actually you're actually pulling on a supernatural God and if a man in the pulpit has a gift that God gives that gift is supernatural and that gift is to get himself out of the way that the people can pull is supernatural through a natural realm of a natural being and here natural words they meant but the Prophet said see but it's not me you're pulling out it's him you're pulling out see your own power of faith pulls from the supernatural God the very desires of your heart amen it's not me you're pulling that it's you're pulling that and when you begin to pull up on the supernatural then the words that you're hearing is words that God is using a natural man but he's speaking words to your life you know I think hearing in the message the prophet of God will say it like this this is not you that you're pulling that but it's him now a person has a need a church hasn't he and as you come to the house of God pulling Amen do you know that God will actually cause a man to come in the pulpit and preach a certain thing because you have a certain need then God will make that man preach what you have made huh just like a woman gonna have a baby here with us when a lady's gonna have a baby and amen and she wants a different kind of food people some of these messages from the message are a little bit different Haman they're little different than denominational food I agree with you amen but do you see the reason there's a difference amen if you take your young life to the to look to the doctor and he used to not look she she's also said more than ice cream for breakfast and she put peanut butter and mustard on it there's something wrong with her her she's eating odd things to what she always eat before the doctor can limit it you'll say see there's another life on the inside of her amen and she's pulling to supply that body that's developing on the inside amen and you see when you start wanting something out of the ordinary you are looking for the supernatural you're desiring the presence of God amen let a doctor Amen tell you what's wrong with you tonight amen there's another beam operating on the inside of here amen there's a body developing bear and you're thirsty and you're hungry for the supernatural God two feet more than a natural body but a supernatural body is thirsting and desiring amen prophet of God said well amen is a father of course as a father Amen I'm gonna get what my wife wants amen because I want a perfect baby born then how much greater is father God amen to meet the need of his children amen to bring forth a perfect body and a perfect Church now amen then God will actually cause somebody to come to the pulpit and preach the absolute truth amen that's what we're hungry for his truth and God will make somebody preach the absolute truth that's right absolute truth and now in the curtain of time but the man says it like this he said God comes from the midst of his people he says and their faith begins to draw out supernatural words amen supernatural words how many times have you ever come to the house of the Lord you've been praying and and you've been fasting and you made concentrating and preparing yourself for the word the Lord now now you you got to understand that it takes preparation to come to the house of the Lord heaven whatever you're gonna do you're gonna need some kind of preparation Haven and when we come to the house of God we didn't come here just to have a fight we have prepared ourselves to have a victory hey man I don't know about y'all but hey man we've been over and Afghanistan fighting for years amen and ain't nobody winning that war it's just on and on and on and on and on Vietnam was on and on and on and on Oh buddy one that Amen they fought a long time but there wasn't any victory amen and I think it's time that the church quit fighting a many get some victory him just fighting with a devil don't you kill that devil instead of just showing up to the house of God and say we'll see what happens tonight we meant bring ourselves for the house of God ready but kill every devil in every enemy of our lives until the presence of God can take us over in a complete way I'll tell you I believe that when the people of God come prepared to hear the word of God then they're going to draw out supernatural words a man asked me one time a many Issa brother Lane I hear you talk about the Lord Amen brings I cast Devils out of people's lives when you pray for man things and we've had some supernatural happen in that way he said this this this a man or a woman always had to come through the prayer line to get a demon cast off for them I said well actually amen the highest order of casting out a demon is the preaching of the gospel and as the word of God is preached it drives spirits away from the mind and the heart of God's people Amen the Word of God cast out the devil Haman amen and then you know sometimes Amen you come to the house of the Lord preacher don't know you you don't know the preacher you don't even know the people that sitting around you amen but see the Bible said that the Word of God it's a discerner of the founding the intent of the heart and then the man don't know the situation he has no clue even what he's talking about at times Amen but God will turn that man a certain way and he begin to speak right to your Lea your heart and your need and begin to discern the things that are there and you think it's the guy in the pulpit but he has no idea what you're going through but it's God honoring your faith but make a man say something to bless your heart I tell you God still has supernatural words coming naturally they meant speaking to the heart in the need of his children amen I believe that there is a supernatural among us tonight and I believe that God a man has an ability to still use his word to drive away spirits amen you ever come in the house of God and you just barely get in the back door and you just call right in but about 15 minutes into the sermon amen you feel you're you get a little bit more Liberty and you start nodding your head a little bit when you couldn't do it before and all of a sudden you feel your hands start drifting up and amen and before you knew it you jumped on your feet and said hey man amen what is happening as the word becomes comes out amen it's like an army pressing back the demonic beats of unbelief and out in fear amen and after a little while amen Wow that we have the enemy pushed back that's your opportunity he meant to accept the things that you've been desiring and warning God God knows what he's doing brethren hey man the preaching of the gospel is still the way God deals with his people hey man hey man I believe that's the truth hey man I've seen that too many times hey man I've seen that with a word of God used and in Supernatural ways say men and we were in the minute in the meeting one night and never said it was a lady that come up to the to the platform and she told me she said well Elaine she said I've been I've been years carrying guilt she said where where I had been abused as a child and she's have been carrying that guilt for years she said but this morning something in the message has has quickened and I believe God's gonna let me free from it we prayed for him when that spirit left her he meant she let us scream out and the power of God come in the building a man and a woman been living for years with a spirit amen and that spirit was delivered right in that service well about a year later I was over in Norway and I was preaching him and just this little thing popped in my mind amen and that testimony Amen toward the end of the service and and I begin if I how God had picked up the spirit and brought that girl to the altar and a great deliverance come on her over somebody else had abused her and when I started telling that testimony there was a young lady sitting on the front row in her 30s just began to speak out and and rejoice and praise God and tears started running and she just started rejoicing Liberty and I I had no idea what was going on but I knew I've been preaching long enough there God was doing something I didn't know what it was but I knew God was doing something and after the service of young lady comes she said brother Lawson she said I went last week to my pastor's wife and told her I've been being abused by a certain situation when I was a kid said I'd ask what what what am I supposed to do how am I supposed to handle it this is gonna tear families this is gonna and all these situations and when she started telling pastor's wife she said look I don't have all the answers she said I listened to you but I don't have all the answers she said but we're gonna have a meeting in about a week and she said God's gonna have a man of God coming here don't know nothing about all this and he won't have any idea and you'll be neutral about it she said so you get somewhere and fast and pray to that man gets here and you asked God to make him answer your question from the platform and Wow he was the last service and it was the last few minutes of the last service and the Holy Spirit is so faithful he wouldn't let me leave that meeting without speaking to that need thank God come on the scene it was a supernatural world and let me tell you tonight that same supernatural God is still among his people our God is not bad people and God still has the gifts among his church hey man I still believe in a resurrected Jesus Christ hey man do you see what is what's the world to live in today brother man tells us he said do you see he said years ago I was out on the west coast and he said they told me they said brother branham said used to be that was good gospel word solid me and had women out here and the presbyterian people had had taught the Word of God he said brother man he said now much of fanaticism come in he said and they've taken all the people broke up the churches and everything's moved into fanaticism you know what the Prophet said he said listen the reason these things has happened he said it's because you have failed to feed the people the supernatural bread of God he said and hungry children will feed from a garbage can if they have to he said had the church stayed with the phenomena of the supernatural and brought absolute word then the people would have stayed with it and we find out that that's exactly what's happened in the world that we lived in today denomination turned off from God they turned away from the word of the Lord and they went to soup suppers and creeds and numbers and money and buildings and churches and they forgot amen the resurrected Jesus statement that started the situation amen but there is a Church of the Living God and still upon the earth today remember says I don't want all of that whoa Jesus hey man do you know the prophet of God said what it is is they're actually from a garbage can if they have to and the children of God need to be fed with a true Word of God of thus saith the Lord that's right for wherever the carcass is wherever the supernatural is demonstrated there the Eagles will gather together amen do you see amen we can teach theology we can teach them on doctrine but the prophet of God said it will never satisfy the human heart doctrine will never satisfy theology will never satisfy the human heart the human heart is hungry to see the realities of Jesus Christ they're hungry to see the presence of God come down in the church the prophet of God said do you see what happens they get away from the supernatural part he says it in the message resurrection of Lazarus he said Israel when they come into captivity by the Romans he said they've been taken away we know what their Roman spirit is don't we and the priests got to a place that they got away from the supernatural part of God and they begin to teach doctrines and theories and things like this and Jesus when he came rebuked them and said you have taught for doctrine the commandments of men and have made the Word of God of no effect that's right when the church begins to drift from the supernatural they start leaning to understanding and the understanding always comes from some man or someone who wants to become great among us amen the prophet of God says it like this he said as soon as education comes in the fenomena leaves he said Christ leaves the church because he can't stand it tall he meant they get more smart than he is they know more scripture he said but the scripture is not given by education scripture is given by a revelation not education by a revelation oh that's right he said see when they give me get away from that that's when Christ leaves the church look at this flower to see an H Christ is only outside of the church because they have more education than they've ever had but they got less Christ than they ever had I don't know about y'all tonight Amen but take the education give me Christ let me see the anointing of God moving in the heart of the people hey man I'll tell you this amen the prophet of God said see the church begin to get away from the phenomena and he is a supernatural being and he's looking for a supernatural God but the supernatural things that's what the heart is hungry tonight for is to see reality that's what happened to Shiva in the Bible when she heard about God who was working for Solomon that's your type Amen Sheba who was down in a pagan world and she was a queen down there but she heard of the wisdom of Solomon that's right do you know that little girl Amen was ready to pack up and leave whatever she had to go find the realities of a living God amen listen when she was going down to Israel she wasn't going after idol worship in theology and education she had every bit of the idol she needed down there amen she had all the religion that she could stand down there they had temples right there they had priests right there they had church right there but what they didn't have was the God of Israel and she wanted to see that number smaller than Church there's more than theology there's more than batteries that's more than gatherings together there is a God of the gathering there's a God in the presence of the people I'll tell you tonight hey ma'am I don't know about you but I did not leave the nomination just to come to another Idol worshipping together but I can to see you may thank me to be a fanatic but I know it's available I know the presence of God is available okay why can't we have it [Applause] that's right do you see she was hungry she had a hungry heart to see the presence of God you know what that girl did she packed up everything she had and put it on some camels and she took out and the priest said you you you don't have to go down there we got God's here in our country amen but she said I want to see a living God I want to see the presence of a living God working on a human being I want to know that he can enter in and use somebody and she packed up and started and you know what her priest couldn't stop her the journey couldn't stop her the trouble couldn't stop her but she packed up everything she had and she said if this is what they say it is when I get down there I'm gonna invest everything I have in it and when you come to see this Living God you need to pack up everything you got amen because if it here's what we're saying it is it's worth investing everything you got into it amen amen listen the cost ain't sure it's gonna cost you the same thing it costs her it's gonna cost you the same thing that it costs the children of Israel and that's everything to see him it'll cost you ever failed hey man do you see when she got ready to go down there she got in the middle of desert and that was mirages out there and they were they were thirsty and there was mirages that came up y'all know what a mirage is out in the desert the Sun shines and you've seen it on them long high-wage looks like a lake out there amen that ain't no Lake Amen that's an image of a lake imaginary it's imaginary it looks real but it ain't real are you with me can you imagine that there they are the first thing for the waters and they see something that looks real and the prophet of God said they go down there and they take the sand and hot sand and throw it up and all they're doing is heaping hot sand on their head it wasn't water it was hot sand and the denominational promises that they have brought the waters of life it's not waters it's imaginary it's an imagination amen Hailey's heaping hot sand upon the church a mint but if you keep pressing on if you keep pressing on there is a God but the children of Israel can be tonight the presence of God is just ahead hey man do you see what she done now y'all know she got up there in the presence of Solomon and when she heard that gift what'd she do she invested all she had and even her breath left her body she said it's everything I heard and more amen it's everything I believed for and more amen and I believe tonight that there's a church Amen that's got to press through to get into the atmosphere of the supernatural God amen and it's worth every investment that you have brought with you tonight all of your troubles all of your pains all of your problems amen if you land all aside and just press into the atmosphere the Holy Ghost everything that you've heard about it is real listen amen come on I'm a I'm a I'm a realist I guess but do you know how many rumors must have reached the ears of of Sheba before she got now if there y'all heard of good you've heard about good sports players yeah they got all kinds of rumors that blow way bigger than life way bigger than life but when she got down there she said you have exceeded above what I have heard about this they stretched out you know they told it bigger than he was Amen but they couldn't outdo what God does and ain't no matter how wonderful somebody makes it sound they don't no matter how wonderful that we have bragged up the presence of God one five-minute session in the presence of an Almighty God and you'll come out and say it's more than I thought it was God hey man it's more than they thought hey man it's worth it didn't it hey man you got you got it you got to go in you see you got a goal and overcome the Bible says to him that overcometh that's right Amen will I give to eat of the hidden manna to him that overcometh you see it's a reason it says overcome then in other words that's going to be something in front of you it's going to be pressure so it's going to be problems there's going to be issues the devil don't want you going where I'm talking about tonight because in the presence of God he is a powerless adversary in the presence of God doubts will die in the presence of God troubles will disappear amen but you see you've got to overcome to get into the presence of God amen there's a reason they call it overcoming you're gonna have to do something like overcome a mint not now you've got to think of this because but if you get two or three gathered in the name of Jesus tonight he said I'll be there in their minutes if you get one he can flee a thousand you take two he can flee ten thousand the prophet of God said on the day of Pentecost he said the pillar fire divided itself and come down in believers 120 of them and he dwells within them the prophet of God said that's why it's written where two or three are gathered in my name there I am he said so if you got two together that's two licks of the fire you get free together four together five together he said now is us gathering together he said the complete pillar of fire has come back together again now I don't know about you but if I was the devil I wouldn't want that to happen I wouldn't want a church full of people with the anointing of God in their lives to break through into a realm of truth and understanding amen you know what I'd do if I the devil I'd fight you all the way to church I'd give you a flat if I had to I'd like a guy cut you off bounce the red light I'd have the wife say something to the husband I'd have the husband say something to the wife I'd put a prideful spirit on the husband that when he said it he wouldn't repent and I'd have the family all tore up on the way to church and yeah screaming and hollering upset and Rama's mad at daddy was time to get to church nobody wants to worship nobody wants to praise nobody wants to come in the presence of God because if the devil can hold you out of unity he can hold you out of the atmosphere and he's got you whipped on your ground to do with him sometimes it's not easy I know it's a little bit difficult but it's worth you gotta keep my martyrs hot buddy hey man you gotta keep pressing hey man you gotta keep pressing now a man as you keep pressing in the Lord and then all of a sudden you just keep pressing after a while things get easier as you get deeper in you know sometimes Amen I know the devil don't like us to go here but sometimes you know what I may actually do if I'm ever preaching to you and it looks silly a man and you think what's he doing if I just throw my hand up like this and I start doing this I want y'all to know if I don't say nothing about it if I don't even call min if I just stole my hand up like this I want you to know what I'm doing this is sign language now I told the devil a few years ago I said that well you've tried everything you can do to keep me out of the presence of God you've done everything you can do to keep me from living this far from making it this far from serving the Lord from being in the message from preaching the word he's done everything you can do but every now and then I'm preaching I just waved my hand like this and I say we've been through some things but we're gonna keep going you see as you keep going you keep pressing him ten overcometh will I give to each other you know the prophet of God said the secret to that is the hidden manna was supernatural food supernaturally mate supernaturally given and supernaturally kept it's a supernatural food they meant that in the days of Moses when the children of Israel was journey and remember God rained manna out of the heavens and fed them what natural food it was supernatural food supernaturally bait but the problem is that was coming other generations and the Prophet said God did not want other generations to not have a taste of what he did for them cuz he later in the years they're gonna say what God did in the days of Moses and the days of the journey and how wonderful it was but God told Moses he said you go out to dinner and get a barrel fool well that's supernatural manna and I want you to haul it in to the end of the interval and I want you to set it there and the Holies of Holies where the Chicana latias and in the presence of God it would preserve the food that fell in previous generations that hundreds of years later young men who would raise up in the in the priesthood to go taste the exact dude that had failed in the days of Moses in the presence of God now listen friend I want you to know you couldn't taste that food anywhere hundreds of years later a menu you can stand out in in certain places and say there's not even such a thing now but you had to go where the food was in the days of Moses he build a tabernacle in the wilderness is that right that Tabernacle was a meeting place with God and he builded a tent they meant with three phases of course he saw the phone of God in heaven and built the pattern on the earth and it was a body soul and spirit it was an outer court an inner court and the holy sub wholeness is that right now on the outer Court they had sunshine and rain but see that was one atmosphere but there was another atmosphere with a candlesticks word and it was anyone's it was good light amen but it was smoked up and relevant said he never she had a bit of confusion under that light he said but there was one more atmosphere and that third atmosphere was where the pillar of fire was and in the presence of that pillar of fire the food stayed supernaturally kept and the people that lived hundreds of years later could eat the same exact food that had been fed in the days of Moses now don't you come here tonight and say I wished I would have lived in the days of brother Randall and seen the supernatural of God as I want you to know that same food that was in the days of William Branham is still on the earth today not in the natural realm it's not out here in the atmosphere of denomination but you gotta go me you gotta go me into the message you gotta go into the message of the hour you gotta go in there into the Intervale and back there in the Intervale that was a pillar of fire that was shining behind that badge of skin the meanest animal on the earth as a badger and behind that badger skin was a pillar of fire but you got to notice that was things back there that that badger skin would followers you'll know that was supernatural the prophet of God said the errand would get in there and make that walk he talked about this morning and it would Kyle Holies of Holies only outside they could hear air and walk it on the inside but when Erin stepped in there Erin could not hear them in there they could hear him out there then God had soundproof those people that was living in that room where they could no longer hear the criticisms you cannot eat this food in the presence of your criticism Bausch and unbelief and all you still got that in your mind it's not food to you you still got them plane circling your it's not food to you but if you take another step that veil drop behind them and when that veil dropped behind him they stepped into the presence where the Shekinah glory was dwelling over the word and right there in that presence was the eternal God and the very same food I don't know how they did it from generation to generation they ate that same food must have been the same God Amen that has dill in that inner veil was the one that had helped him back better amen in the witness that many light you cuz the barrel didn't go try from year to year from ages to ages it was the same food and the same Hey how did they get there because God was supernatural what's that no man going back there and refilling the bucket it was God supernaturally keeping it there for every believer that would come in there now friend you got to understand that was a powerful place to go in that atmosphere in that atmosphere according to the book of Hebrews that's exactly where Aaron's rod but it Amen do y'all know what Aaron's rod was right it was the rod of Aaron but that was 12 sticks put in the holiest of Holies to determine who should lead Israel amen and those 12 sticks it was one of them belong to Aaron and it was nothing more than just an almond branch broke off of an old tree and it was dead ain't meant not it now Aaron carried a dead stick in his hand I think it's important to understand the stick was dead even when Harun held it Aaron walked through the congregation of Israel and the stick was dead he stood in the presence of Moses and the stick was dead he carried it in the outer ramps the stick was dead he carried it in the second round the stick was dead but when he got into the third round the chosen vessel hello Church the chosen vessel amen in the presence of the Chicana begin in a man of 24 hours begin to bud and bring forth fruit in the presence of Chicana glory now you got to know what kind of fruit did it bear it bore almonds why because it was an almond to begin with it didn't change into something else but it found the power to manifest what it was in the presence of the Chicano glory in other words that God that had created the first Sri when he said let there be an almond tree Amen that Sri was living with the intelligence of that God dwelling in his life Amen but that stick was pulled off of that and lost its identity but when it was brought into the presence it didn't have to go back to the tree didn't have to go back to the tree went back to the creator that make the first God pulled you off the prophet of God said you come off of humanity an old dead dry sinner but when that's your kind of light begin to come over your life brother he had done a search on the life and it took ahold of that seed and it chased it back and it went all the way back to the Garden of Eden amen but it had to go further than that it went back in the presence of God where there was the Lamb's Book of Life that wasn't in the hands of Adam how about we wasn't entitled we were in Christ and he found us in that book that's why this message is the only one that can identify you in the Lamb's Book of Life well let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb it has come hey man that's right amen now I know you know that Jesus said you ought to rejoice your names written in the Lamb's Book of Life you ought to rejoice that your names now I think it's important to you and I to know that thousands of people have their name in that book man I would chance to say millions of people have their names in that book and have lived from the time that we live now all the way back to Adam but let me give you some news tonight you're the first people to know your name was in that book I spend millions I had it but they didn't know it was there but there's a bride on the earth today that knows her name was there because we have come into the presence of the original Shekinah glory my quick and the soul and when that soul was quick and then begin to say bride so what you're producing is fruit it's a bride fruit you're not producing world fruit denomination of fruit you're producing the fruit of the headstone my thing tonight but that's a bride on the earth that knows who they are that have been in the presence of God now you can live in the presence of the church you can live in the presence of the pasture and you can stay dead but you cannot go in the presence of God and remain dead if there's a seed down on the inside of you you chosen of God the elect of God will come to the life in the presence of God amen how can the supernatural God move through this church tonight and you not move out did God walk in the church tonight and you not know that he's here if there's a seat on the inside of you there's something on the inside that responds and says that's my god that's my god so alive hey somebody give me some praise tonight give me worthy wow that's the place hey men the public God said you let every man woman or boy in this building tonight get everything off of their mind and believe that he is standing present right now you'll see something that'll cause headlines and the papers in the morning you get everything off of your mind but that Jesus Christ is right here present and you'll read about these meetings in the headlines of the papers they'll write about what happens in the Church of the Living God if the church would only let go of every unbelief and never doubt and never fear and say god I've come here tonight to worship you and praise you listen there's a possibility you don't recognize the potential of who you really are listen I I know you know the prophecies over your life a prophet of God said as this bride nears the headstone she will become a super church a super race of people I take your friend you don't maybe know who you are but that don't make no difference God knows who you are and the devil knows who you are I think it's time you find out who you are now if you are that the potential is unbelievable the potential is unlimited the potential of what God can do with you as a believer it's unlimited look what he done with Joshua look at what he done with Moses and that was under the blood of bulls and goats what could he do with you Amen tonight under the blood of Jesus Christ I'll tell you what a prophet of God said he said the possibility here tonight is another book of Acts the possibility in this church tonight is an upper room experience now it's possible right here tonight the potential of this meeting is the book that's the potential of what could happen in this meeting tonight is a nether upper room experience my to think that them people wasn't no different than you are they was only children of God together together in one man and one Accord in the presence of God came in and filled them everyone he met absolute paragraph 47 then the pillar of fire is manifested in its fullness when his church sets together in heavenly places that's right Haman you see something begins to happen when the right atmosphere comes amen when the right thing happens twenty-five thousand were healed in one meeting at one time in Durban South Africa thirty thousand a men was saved him one altar call people talked about the day of Pentecost this is ten times more powerful than what happened on the day of Pentecost and you're trying to look back to a former age to find something that is real this is the most real anointing that has ever struck the earth the prophet of God in the first year of his ministry and 35,000 outstanding miracles in this message listen we've got pictures of the pillar fire that the critics amen are the one that took them we have we have 1100 tapes for you to go over and see if a prophet missed one prophecy or one vision Amen I don't know I meant where you are tonight I just know where I and in the place where I'm standing amen I read the Bible I have read what was prophesied and I can say this day this scripture is fulfilled that's what I'm standing I'm standing in a place where I've listened to we went through and counted brother Jack we counted for eleven hundred and something tapes amen and I wanted to know what how many visions were on those tapes when we got done that was over 8,300 visions where brother Branham would tell somebody their name or their address and their disease and listen out of eighty three hundred times not one time did somebody say that wasn't right brother BAM out of 80 let me ask you something how many times would it take for you to believe it was real let me ask you Jesus did it one time to a little woman at the whale and she said sir I perceive you're [Applause] [Music] the king of Israel and God would have it done Haiti 300 times on record and you're trying to figure out who it is brother we've got more than enough evidence to cover up every court in the country it's running for fear because there's a bride who knows where she is who she is and what she's doing with this message I'll tell you this friends as a desperation that lives today and the heart of believers we may be in a land but don't belong to us we may be living in America we may be living in some other continent amen but we're still children of God amen in the days of Elijah they took a captive of a little girl a man and took her down to Syria and there was a leopard down there whose name was naman and naman was so sick but this little girl saw the way her master lived and she said I would to God that my master name could go down to Israel where they got a prophet down there the prophet of God makes it sound like this I went to God the layman could get in the atmosphere were my prophet lives amen did you see this little girl new Israel the land wasn't the place he needed to be because when naman heard about it and introduced him to the supernatural he got hungry for it and he went to the king of Israel to find it so it wasn't in politics it wasn't in the country Amen but there was a certain atmosphere that naman had to get under it was the one the Prophet was under now watch because Amen this little girl Amen in a land like that told this great man if you could come down and come in the atmosphere but that profits in amen your leprosy will be healed whether you talk about inspiration that little girl was testifying my inspiration that's all she had because jesus said himself in Luke 4 says that was not one leper in the days of Elijah healed but naman that little girl did not have any testimony to go say naman I was down there the other day and there was a leper coming in and I've seen it with my own eyes she couldn't say well Roberts for lepers healed on the backside of Israel in one day maybe but she didn't have any testimony other than that she knew the presence that that prophet lived in could do anything for anybody she couldn't tell them 8,300 visions she couldn't tell if cripples walking and blinded eyes opening she couldn't tell a thousands and thousands of healings but she moved but the atmosphere that man was under if naman got under that atmosphere one time do you know I know tonight that if a sick person gets in the atmosphere of believing this word and the divine presence of God it don't take two hours it takes five minutes in that presence you know a man named and heard about the supernatural went down and brother man said he took his letter down the King how do you find the supernatural that way brother I said don't come through letters in church you can go you can go meet with the head of the church you can go meet with the tree I don't mean it's gonna happen you want to actually the church said what you do come and start a fight with us king of insurance what he was trying to get war with us I mean I can't heal your leprosy he meant but but Elijah heard and said he needs to come down here so the man turned from the king and went to Elisha he meant it was a great man and he went to lice you would have thought but Elisha hearing of a great ruler coming to his house he got up went outside you know the Bible said that Elisha didn't even go out and meeting this man my brother your Bible is a powerful thing and that's not one thing written in there that don't have a reason to be in there and Elisha did not talk to that man he sent a preacher Elisha didn't never even talk to that man but he said a man he told what to say and I tell you what naman found out Amen that you might not talk to a prophet but if you can just talk to somebody but a prophet is trained but a prophet is instructed for the prophets told them how listen friend I want you to know tonight that there's a fivefold ministry left in this earth a prophetess trained field and told Wow but a man can get rid of leprosy how to make the supernatural moon he's instructed them in the presence of God you see what when he went down there hey man this little preacher come out and met him and said Elijah said for you to go down and dip seven times in the muddy Jordan and Mayman got bad name and got mad as he died he gonna come and meet me himself is he not he gonna come out and talk to me I'm a big man huh I'm important somebody ought to say there's somebody with great importance hard to talk to me but it just a little simple preacher come talk to him and said what Elijah said let's go down and dip seven times and Elijah said and go hasten comes out and says excuse me name and says to him says well and then there's better there's better rivers in our country there's better rivers in our country maybe the property God said what is the what it's the reason to go to Jordan it's a ridiculous place for break man to go he said but there was a little guy standing next to him he said God always supplies that fella there and it was a little fella riding with him and nobody he said well if he told you something great wouldn't you have done it but he's actually to do something simple now listen if there is if there is a supernatural unlocked by disobedience now all of you know if you read your Bible you know David David Kendall's the number of the children of Israel and thousands died because he disobeyed God in the days of LP or they went down and the inland and the Israelite men labor the MOBOTIX women and what happened thousands died because they unlocked a supernatural plague but if if disobedience will unlock the supernatural how much greater will the obedience to the Word of God unlock a supernatural anointing and this man who was a great man went down to the river Jordan amen you see he didn't think he had to go down there he didn't have to go down there he had a right to not go down there but had he not went there he would have kept his leprosy and the prophet of God said you can come to the meetings and sit there and say I'm not going up there to that altar and Boo Boo and then cry and acting like the rest of them he said that's right you don't have to but you can stay a sinner just like you are amen but if you're gonna get something from God you've got to get to the place where you can get in the presence of God this said preachers the only place I need at the altar Amen let me tell you what prophet God said about a farmer one time said he wanted the Holy Ghost and the brother he had with him said well you got to come down here and go with me and they and they bastard the barn and the guy said can I get in here said no not down there Lisa my say and he said can I get he said no he said you got to come go with me went down to the hog pen and he climbed off in the hot mud got about knee-deep in the hope and he said boss come over in here this is where you get it no boy said well I don't want it that bad about two weeks later he got hungry he come back said look brother he said I'm ready to get that Holy Ghost wherever I gotta go to get it and he meant and he took off down to hog barn the boy how did he say hey boss where are you going he said I'm going to the hog pen to get the Holy Ghost he said I didn't say you had to go to the hog pen he said I said you got to be willing to go to the hog pen now if you're not willing to come to an altar you're not ready for the Holy Ghost if you're not willing a men to surrender your life you're not ready for the Holy Ghost do you know what sometimes I think I think we need to get down to the altar and pray and flip-flop like a chicken with its head cut off here we did something I think we ought to get something sure it's one thing to come and rejoice but we need a change we need a change in our lives and our hearts and it takes an atmosphere to change things it takes a presence of God your brother I've been doing this a while things ain't change will you watch your name and he did seven times it went about five times in he must have stood up and brother BAM said he said to somebody they know change it there ain't no changes been five times and they don't change it amen and the Prophet said there that God was and he said didn't he say seven times didn't he say seven times come on church didn't he say Amen go ye therefore and repent and stay there until you receive the Holy Ghost do you want you you needed five times but when he come up there seven time when he come up that seven times it was a change but the change happened all at once because he had obeyed the message of Elijah he got through another messenger who was instructed by Elijah listen I know it's been a long time in your traveling but listen you just keep doing what the message says you keep obeying the Word of God and one of these morning's you're going to have a change from the top of your head to the bottom of your feet you're gonna change in the moment in the twinkling of an eye think about it's gonna change I'll tell you friendly hey man we got a ride tonight say well I don't want to go down there and I don't want to be in that high I don't want to hack like man but you know hey man you got to give up your rights to find the supernatural Amen Jesus come to Martha four days late Lazarus had been dead for days and Jesus came brother man said Martha had a right to be angry with him because of his late coming he said but had she kept that right she would have never got that miracle you see you can keep that attitude well if this hadn't happened if that preacher had to done this if this situation had in the road you keep that attitude you can keep it if you want to you can be mad at God because the way your daddy did you your mama did you or the preacher did you you can keep that attitude you got a right to keep it but when you keep that attitude you miss the miracle that God is trying to do in your life but when that little girl seen Jesus come and she said Lord had you been here this wouldn't have happened but even now you see even right now thanks made me hard situations maybe but don't get angry don't get angry don't keep that attitude so your Lord I appreciate you coming tonight I'm looking for a change in this feeling tonight you know what Jesus said to her he said Martha roll back that stone take that stone away you know what brother Graham said he said that Jesus could have made that stone disappear with his pinky he could have dissolved that stone but rather than doing that he had that woman move it he had him women down there moving that stone what did he have them move that stone for he meant so they could be a part of the miracle so they he gave them something to do in the miracle but man said you got something to do you got a role your unbelief away you got a role your doubts away what was they doing they were preparing for a resurrection for a miracle to come listen friend I believe tonight amen that God is in the midst of this place and all we might have do is roll back the stones every man every woman every child in here tonight that's been born again jesus said unless you're born again you can't even see this amen and you that is born he said flesh is flesh but that is spirit is spirit the person that's born again is spirit spiritual authority your spiritual kings your spiritual priests everything that you have is in the spirit every power you have is in the spirit everything that you possess is in the spirit now you see why the devil wants to keep you in the natural because in the spirit you are more powerful than the devil see you are actually built to go in the supernatural we bought we bought a little doll for my daughter it's called a mountain current I don't know phim have you ever heard of the mountain curb a nice little boy growing up we had a I had a squirrel dog the Lord gave me and it was his probably the best squirrel I was ever Salling so for years I wanted one my daughter wanted two dogs I told my wife I said we'll get a dog as long as we get one of them counting dogs so we bought one of them brought it home now the thing is is we took this puppy it was about eight weeks old six weeks whatever they are when they're weaned we took offense mom and stand and they hadn't seen him since year old now probably or so but we took that puppy but that puppy had the genetics in it of some champion squirrel dog said but but but when it was born we took it right away so it never saw its mama Hunter's daddy huh never saw anything but when we started raising it we live there in the city and we've got a we got a back glass brother Jack you've been there and in the back there in that back glass it's pretty open then we got a little glass door there and that dog has been raised up right there in that house biggest part of it if it goes outside things somebody's mistreating it you know he's got to come back the house so it's been raised up right turned my daughter and thinks it's a human we finally had to start telling as a dog it's the silliest I'm serious that thing didn't know I was a dog and it get around other dogs it was scary it was funny because it is what is there but we hadn't I don't remember how old she was she hadn't but very old but all of a sudden one day she's out there in the yard and she saw a squirrel that dog having never been hunted having never been out with his parents didn't know nothing about it and he started barking and chasing that thing a few days later we started playing with it in different squirrels thing and all of a sudden this dog in the house she roams from the window to the window look in the backyard over his head is there squirrel out there and she'll just shoot a certain shoe she sees and she should start barking let it out she'll run around nobody ever taught her that but down in her genetics she actually is that and the older she gets the more those genetics become out of her of what she really was born to do now what's amazing amen as she learned that that word squirrel was that little animal so we'd all be sitting around the house and Nathan knows this is true we'd just be sitting around the house and in the dog be laying over there doing something and somebody would say well is that a squirrel out there the dog everything was normal house you say is that as far as she just I mean it was a funniest thing you ever saw she knew that word and what it meant and and and she never been trained to do nothing but it was literally in ER she was built and born to do that listen listen if that is true about a dog what about the children inside of you it's a gene of God but you are born for this you were born to praise God you are born to believe this message to go in the presence of God do you see if we start if we run over in the presence of God in an atmosphere and it begins to fall on us Amen it's not a time to back up it's a time to step in do you recognize that you can go to a place tonight to know what it felt like when they were standing on the Red Sea when it opened up you can come and go with me and step over in a presence tonight of what it was with Moses open the Red Sea you can know what it felt like but David brother branham created squirrel's you can know what it was like when Georgia Carter raised up from the band you can know what it's like I mean it was in the day of Pentecost the same atmosphere that they were under is the same atmosphere that's clear tonight but the power and the presence of Almighty God you've got to be willing to come in there you've got to be willing to step into the presence of God and become supernatural minded and let the realities of God do you see the prophet of God says you've got to find the reality of Ag Living God but you'll never do it till you get filled with a spirit you'll never do it till you get filled with the spirit you know right now and we're living in an educational age scientific age you go into astronomy and and it's far beyond anything the days of Enoch if you go into the study of the stars amen and you and you've got night now you got that that big old telescope that went back 14 million light years they got knocked over to where stars are born and they see the colors that come up out of the universe my butt and you know what's wild them scientists have looked back that far and they didn't find God in there right now medical science can break down your human body they can transplant organs in you they can they can they can dismember you and put you back together again amen mate they can break you down till they know that very DNA of your life they can tell you you're going to be sick before you're sick they can tell you the health of your mother and father just by looking at your genetics they can break that down the blood cells and white blood cells and proteins that ride upon them in Hara am DNA it's unbelievable how far science has looked into the medical field into your body and they didn't find God in there if you're anybody abala just in here in biology if you studying biology and in the natural world maybe how deep have they went into animal life and tree life into so much right now they're growing weeds and trees and corn and they're genetically modifying the thing they're breaking into the inner inner inner parts of the seeds and putting genetics from other plants and watching a manifest and they're doing all of this breaking down to the very last source and they didn't find God look as far as they can go in the sea being found God as far as they go in the heavens and they can't find God they can go as far as they can go in your life and they can't find God but put God in the heart of a man and he can see God in the pine tree and he can see God in the rain bowl and you can see God in the church and he can see God in you see what we've got a have to see God we've gotta have God on the inside of us what the church needs for reality is a baptism of the Holy Ghost and come down on the church as well we want God we won't gone you've got on the inside and you'll see God everywhere you'll see God in the message you'll see God in the ministry you'll see God in your husband in your wife brother amen brother man talk to a man on his porch one time who was a who who denied there was a god but man said them preachers a bunch of lying dogs amen amen been on that porch but I'm said he said that fella Tony said brother Adam he said he said I've looked for God for 75 years he looked for God 75 years in the very spot he lived in he'd been to the creek he'd been to the mountain he'd eat the apples off of that tree but 15 minutes in the presence of a prophet and he found God was right in front of you listen friends Christ don't need to come we need our eyes open to the reality of what's already happening in the Church of the Living God I'll tell you tonight there's a reality amen and that reality as there is they Pentecostal experience my brother called it this morning Pentecost begin without an ending and as to all people at all times it will take a Pentecostal experience to prove God you want to know there's my god get a Pentecostal experience and it won't be you asking it'll be you proven some people are looking for the revival come on that was true went over there and they asked that guy that policeman standing there weren't we where is the revival they was funded and that policeman said I am the revival it wasn't in a building was in him and today people say where is the revival Amen well people looking for it but there's somebody else that knows where it's at because they are the revival you see friends there's got to be a reality to this message a reality to this brother man said the Pentecostal spirits is a reality of God amen did you see that the church the world is hungry the prophet of God said they're hungry for the manifestation of sons he said that's God getting into his children and becoming a reality that's what the world is hungry for is to see God get in his children and become a reality what does young men want to see they want to see that God can change somebody what does young women want to see that God really can't change somebody and when what this what is people hunger for it's that God not a painting fire they're looking for the fire for the reality listen Prince things has written in this Bible tonight I hope you didn't oh I hope I got a few minutes amen the things that are written in this Bible was written and you know they were written in a symbol form amen but but if there's a white horse rider there's a reality to it somewhere now people don't like it when you say what it is there's a white horse rider we know what it is there's a there's a the Bible said that sets on seven hills we know what it is it's a symbol in the Bible but it really is the Roman Catholic Church really it is that's an efficient five that says as a glorious church without spot or wrinkle but it's got to be somewhere in reality and I know where the reality is the world may not see it but we see it we see the glory of God that is here in the church and the presence of God that he's placed there you see a reality to it it's one thing for it to be a symbol but it's another thing to be a reality and this is the age for the reality of God to come to the church this is not a moment he's making promises this is when God is fulfilling promises do you see the prophet of God says it like this God promised in the last days he was going to do something and I'd like to ask anybody any minister anywhere one promise that God made that his church what he said he would do but the real church is doing it now he said when they don't want it see they don't want that answer because they have another answer but the prophet of God said whatever God promised the church is now doing what's the future home brother BAM says it like this these mysterious things we've seen come to pass after understanding in the hour that we're living in the position there is no one that we want to sit down and really sensibly examine what has been spoken of and what has been promised to happen and what has happened but that we can say those things are fulfilled now that's pretty powerful seeing exactly what God said he would do he has did it down to the letter in reality he has really done these things in reality because what we're waiting for the books to be open brother mem said it's already opened we're just waiting for the people to recognize what he done see it's already an open word the veil has already been rent the message has already been preached that's what's been shaking in front of you the whole time amen it's a vindicated evidence of the word of the hour it's a reality of God to the believer to them that have the Holy Ghost they see it fulfilled see you see this is the thing God is shaking the thing in front of the people and giving a response out of one and others are acting like there's nothing happened like God is then mentally when God has done everything what is the happened on Mount sunset what happened out there why do we talk about it why is all the preachers talk about sunset mountain in the cloud and why mother Graham says it's the attraction of the bride God fulfill each word it's attraction of the bride that's what's attractive the true bride is the fulfillment of the word in reality you read revelations 10 one to seven and it's a it's a it's a beautiful reading in the scripture but it really happened on Mount sunset when Christ brought the book to a prophet I mean it really happened to the church and that reality is what I was looking for not just something in the book but a reality to what was in the book I tell you what we ought to do tonight is wake up to the realities of God there's been a message given to the church they ought to wait to see man into the presence of God sometimes we're looking for God to do something when he's already did it I think about this if you ever you ever waited late at night for somebody to come to the house you ever you ever waited upon somebody it was coming amen actually you went to sleep while they were coming and after a while they come in and you didn't know it they meant but when you woke up you woke up to your expectations has been fulfilled and the prophet of God said what we need to do is to wake up to the presence of Jesus Christ amen we keep looking for him to do something to come into our midst but the greatest shaking the greatest manifestations that have ever been given to any church at any time we already have that listen if this message isn't enough I asked you what are you looking for Amen if this reality it's not enough what would we be asking God for now you have to you have to realize that this is a reality a man that a man that is awaking up of the church a men that have shocked your soul it'll shock you into a reality that Jesus Christ is here among us amen this is so real Church this message is so real it has been so manifested I am not imagining Jesus crisis in this building he has proved beyond understanding that he's here he has proved beyond question that this message is real that this message is true amen he has proved beyond question but the message of the hour is a vindicated word to the Church of the Living God my when I think about this tonight the prophet of God said that this message will become so real it will join the church with the word and it will be a marriage right now I'm not imagining I'm married to Christ not walking around in this imaginary world like I'm talking to this imaginary person and when we got an imaginary presence and we got imaginary things happening here flitting this is not imaginary there is a real Lord Jesus and he really raised up from the grave and this message really brought him alive again in the age that we're living the same yesterday today and forever I have seen him I have seen his presence I have witnessed the power of this manifested word it's the greatest anointing that's ever struck the face of the earth a reality listen friends marry all she done was made the word more real it's all she did and this message has been moving more to the positive all the time do you see friends you cannot see God without finding the reality to him can't do it in closing I want to want to say this you cannot seek God without finding the reality to that God the prophet of God said in the days of Abraham Abraham was in Babylon in that in that land of confusion and he was out there in that city of many gods and he knelt down and was praying above himself why he was praying he got a touch and he got a glimpse that there was a city somewhere else whose builder and maker was God I don't know if y'all I just went through a series on future home back last spring while I was studying in something really stood out to me there Abraham the Bible said sought a city and become a pilgrim and stranger seeking a city that was to come and had a chance to return back but wouldn't do it now I'm not a mathematician but but if you just just quick figures I'd say that Abraham was about five thousand years ahead of that city coming to the earth is that a good safe number 5,000 so when Abraham was living the city he was looking for wouldn't be on the earth for another five thousand meters the New Jerusalem which comes out to the millennium right so Abraham two thousand years to Christ two thousand years to today we got a thousand-year millennium then the new heaven the New Jerusalem comes on top of the mountain right so five thousand years before he had a city to move to the pool was so strong that he told Sarah honey we're gonna sell the house can you imagine your husband walking in tomorrow honey we're gonna sell the house and all of a possession where we going I don't know but I got a feeling there's a city out here somewhere there's a city out here somewhere that God has been and we're gonna go to that city that's our home and he left his home looking for a city that was 5,000 years away and as he was walking one day he come to the spot where that city was gonna come down and the king of that city stepped out and met Abraham in the very place that city was coming down because the city would be coming for five thousand years God let him meet the king of that city to let him know it's real Church hey man we have sought a city whose builder and maker was God and here we are the seed of Abraham and we're going toward that city and people say well it's not real it's not real but God let that same king the same one but since your name is Abraham and your name is Sarah and you'll have a child he left my same king come down in this age Amen and meet the Church of the Living God on their way back friends I know the city's real I know God is real I know the message is real there's a reality to this word we have met here would you stand to your feet with us tonight is it real yes it's real yes it's a real thing it's reality real musicians come I'm sorry my voice is a little weak tonight I had 12 services and rolling Indian and come home preach there and then but you know someday I'm gonna get all my voice back y'all gonna hear me in glory you know so that's what he sounds like with a full voice it's real yes sir it's real all this I hear you're looking at it's not real it's not Satan is the god of everything you see but the problem of God said God is the God of reality the guvnah the unseen realm is the God that we're serving tonight I want you to know he's real for you to know he's a real God in the house tonight when I was about 22 year old I found out how really was I still believed a little Church one night and they opened up the altar and I found out that God was more than just something they talked about in church or something my mom talks about I found that he was real I found that he was a God that walks with you and talks with you and he's a God that keeps you in the hours of trouble he's a God that shows up and that same God is real here tonight they may be some of you here tonight even wondering is is this message real it's the things he's been talking about real but I want to show you tonight this is the realest thing you've ever come in contact with his presence is real his anointing is real and if he ever comes in your heart you can see him you can see for what he is what do you what he needs I wonder is there somebody here tonight and by the way I need this to be real to me the probably God said Lord let the people come into presence toward it becomes real again do you remember when the people first come into message and they hauled the televisions out all the world behind music they left they left every bit of that because the message was read to all and they can become that real to you tonight it can become real in your heart this this word this Jesus Christ can become that real to you that you sell out everything that you are and give your life to Christ tonight as some of you don't know me I understand that but I want to be a witness to you tonight that you're living in you're living in an unreal world and someday all these things that you see now they won't be here anymore but there's another world that's more real than this world the angles of God are more real than the things that you've seen on television and someday they'll be more real to you than everything that surrounds you but even right now they're still here and can become real tonight in his presence I don't know tonight where you are I don't know what your hearts are but I I want to see the realities I'm gonna become more real and ask God to come here tonight I will ask the Holy Spirit to move in this room tonight and we've got somebody here like the queen of sheba's a nicer brother Wayne I've heard but I want to see I'd heard that I want to see I want to see moving the presence I want to see love in my heart that's just bow our hearts tonight father Lord across the congregation tonight well we have spoke things and Lord we've done all that we know but Lord you have promised you have promised father that if we knock that you would open your promise father if they would see they would find and Lord as we have spoke your word tonight we pray that right here in this building that if everyone here tonight that it is asking about the things about the reality of this word about the reality of your presence we pray tonight that you would dissolve every doubt Lord that may your anointing come in this building just now Lord and may you take them into a realm you take us into the Holies of Holies tonight take us into the place where everything is possible take us in the place where the fire burns thank us wherever and Rothbard's Lord take us where lives are changed take us where hearts through healed other I'm prayed tonight I'm pray for your children Lord that our grow weary and those that have been battling and those that have struggled through to get this far the enemy Lord would do all that he can do to stop them but Lord I know the seed thereof I've read about him in the Bible I've read of the ones that could not be stopped by fire or by hunger order by pressure and I prayed anandhan that seed would begin to spark on the inside the Lord that they then did is press through the understanding and the doubts and fears and find their self in you lord I ask you for your children tonight give them the grace that they have needle god I pray father in the name of Jesus in the name of Jesus a man a man can we sing a song [Music] every hand lifted ever our clothes [Music] [Music] mine [Music] right [Music] Oh [Music] we'd like to ask the Lord for something tonight you're welcome to come if you'd like to pray just come and ask God for a refilling you want it to be more real to you I believe the Holy Spirit is structured me to speak what I've spoke to you tonight I didn't just pick something to preach me nor directed me and I don't believe that the Holy Spirit would put something on a man's heart unless he's ready to do something and I believe God's ready to do something in this place tonight we've done all we can doing the preaching of the word but at this point you just begin to help me male let your hearts begin to go into that groundwork where all things are possible then you begin to meditate and pray and worship the Lord and you that would like prayer just feel free to come we're gonna anoint you and pray with you [Music]

one you have everybody come here together and he's actually just looking for one that he needs to deal with them and he'll design the sermon just to go after that one person someone she loves us Jesus went after the one that was in a graveyard sleeping there she's living there he left and he went to the other side just for one went through a stormy sea went through all kind of things just for one soul that was that was on the other side and what our prophet told us that one soul is worth how many worlds how many worlds 10,000 one soul 10,000 worlds God got one Souls attention tonight this was more than worthy we wanted to just take the Lord for our precious sister sister Dolores mall that made it in tonight and man I'm not sure who invited around some of the Holy Spirit invited her but
