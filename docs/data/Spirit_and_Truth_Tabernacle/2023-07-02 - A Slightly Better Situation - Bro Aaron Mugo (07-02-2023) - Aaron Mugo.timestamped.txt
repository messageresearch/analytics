[4:09] [Music]
[4:12] it's one of
[4:15] my favorite scriptures to read
[4:21] I know that it's going home time so
[4:24] this is actually the scripture brother
[4:27] Bradley used as a text for the rapture
[4:34] amen the Lord is my light and my
[4:36] salvation
[4:37] Whom Shall I Fear
[4:39] the Lord is the strength of my life of
[4:42] whom shall I be afraid
[4:44] when the wicked even mine enemies and my
[4:46] foes Came Upon me to eat eat up my flesh
[4:49] they stumbled and failed
[4:51] doing the whole shouldn't Camp against
[4:53] me my heart shall not fear the war
[4:56] should rise against me and this will I
[4:58] be confident
[4:59] one thing have I desired of the Lord
[5:01] that will I seek after
[5:03] that I may dwell in the house of Lord
[5:05] all the days of my life to behold the
[5:08] beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his
[5:10] Temple
[5:11] for in a time of trouble he shall hide
[5:13] me in his Pavilion in the secret of his
[5:16] Tabernacle shall he hide me
[5:18] shall set me up
[5:20] on a rock
[5:22] and now shall my head be lifted up above
[5:25] my enemies round about me
[5:27] therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle
[5:29] sacrifice sacrifices of Joy I will sing
[5:32] yea I will sing praises unto the Lord
[5:36] hear O Lord when I cry with my voice
[5:38] have mercy also upon me and answer me
[5:41] when thou say to seek seek ye my face my
[5:44] heart said unto thee thy face Lord will
[5:46] I seek hide not thy face far from
[5:50] put not thine servant away in Anger thou
[5:53] has been my help leave me not neither
[5:56] forsake me o God of my salvation
[5:59] when my father and my mother forsake me
[6:01] then the Lord will take me up
[6:03] teach me thy way O Lord and Lead Me in
[6:06] the playing path because of my enemies
[6:08] deliver me not over into the unto the
[6:11] will of mine enemies for false Witnesses

[59:37] it's
[59:41] great to be here this morning
[59:43] um to be with you all
[59:45] um as you can see singing's not my gift
[59:48] but
[59:50] uh no whenever the prophet
[59:54] they were asking him for what to do I
[59:57] think it was Elijah or Elisha rather and
[1:00:00] uh you know when he told them to make
[1:00:03] the valley full of ditches before he did
[1:00:04] his prophecy he said bring me a Minstrel
[1:00:07] and uh you know I before I preach I
[1:00:12] always like to sit back there and just
[1:00:14] listen because this church is full of
[1:00:16] minstrels and God just sends them and
[1:00:19] after that after you listen to them it's
[1:00:21] like how can I not speak the word of God
[1:00:24] how can I not speak over my situation
[1:00:27] how can I not speak to these people how
[1:00:29] can I not speak the name of Jesus
[1:00:31] there's just no way I can can't do that
[1:00:34] you know um
[1:00:36] uh thank God that uh the past couple
[1:00:40] years has been crazy for me so uh I
[1:00:44] think I started preaching right before
[1:00:45] uh I met Rebecca and I didn't have a
[1:00:49] Minstrel and then a couple years ago I
[1:00:52] asked for the check for a hand of
[1:00:55] marriage and I was like okay I got a
[1:00:57] Minstrel now
[1:00:58] and uh before I preached I usually ask
[1:01:01] her to sing and I hope that's okay today
[1:01:05] um
[1:01:06] I I usually like to have her sing before
[1:01:09] I go because it helps me calm my nerves
[1:01:11] and I hope it helps the service so
[1:01:13] whatever you feel like uh singing today
[1:01:16] is anything that's on your heart
[1:01:18] she knows how to pick it it's her gift
[1:01:20] not mine so
[1:01:21] I'd like you guys can be seated watch
[1:01:24] these things actually
[1:01:50] foreign

[1:06:32] Genesis chapter 15.
[1:06:35] and um
[1:06:38] verse 13 Genesis 15 13 so
[1:06:42] um
[1:06:43] I'm gonna get right into it I I've never
[1:06:46] had this many notes as far as I know for
[1:06:48] any sermon so
[1:06:49] I might go a little quickly in some
[1:06:52] parts I might just cut it off we'll see
[1:06:54] how the Lord leads if if I just get off
[1:06:56] the notes entirely then we'll still be
[1:06:57] in his will it's fine it's all good
[1:07:00] okay so uh verse 13.
[1:07:03] this is God speaking unto Abram before
[1:07:05] he even got his name changed to Abraham
[1:07:07] it says and he said unto Abram know of
[1:07:10] assured that thy seed shall be a
[1:07:12] stranger in a land that is not theirs
[1:07:14] and Shall Serve them
[1:07:15] and they shall afflict them for a
[1:07:17] hundred years and also that Nation whom
[1:07:20] they Shall Serve will I judge and
[1:07:22] afterwards shall they come out with
[1:07:24] great substance let's just pray right
[1:07:26] here Lord
[1:07:28] we are uh
[1:07:31] we don't we don't feel a need to welcome
[1:07:33] your presence here today Lord because
[1:07:35] you're already with us we can just feel
[1:07:37] you in the room we've seen how you
[1:07:38] permeated the service and taking control
[1:07:40] of everybody was a part of different
[1:07:42] things uh the musicians and the singers
[1:07:45] and more just the testimonies and the
[1:07:47] prayers Lord you've been with us this
[1:07:48] whole thing and we know that you'll be
[1:07:50] with us for the rest of it you're
[1:07:52] building up to something and we just
[1:07:53] want to see what that is Lord just uh

[1:07:58] and be with me as I speak Lord please
[1:08:01] just use my lips and my tongue to say
[1:08:03] what you would have said and open all of
[1:08:05] our hearts to receive me included in
[1:08:07] Jesus name I pray amen
[1:08:10] you can be seated thank you
[1:08:12] so
[1:08:14] um
[1:08:18] in reading this scripture it's
[1:08:20] it's really short but it's actually
[1:08:22] prefacing a really a long period of time
[1:08:28] with the Israelites in the Book of
[1:08:32] Genesis going into Exodus and uh
[1:08:36] it starts with Joseph and
[1:08:40] his his departure from the land that
[1:08:44] Abraham had given them
[1:08:46] and he goes all the way to Egypt and
[1:08:49] nobody at the beginning could foretell
[1:08:52] how long the Israelites who followed him
[1:08:54] there would stay in Egypt and they
[1:08:57] didn't understand what God had for them
[1:09:01] but I
[1:09:04] I don't think that the Israelites back
[1:09:07] in that time that they realized that
[1:09:11] that they would that they were not
[1:09:13] called to live in Egypt because if you I
[1:09:17] just take history and I try to put
[1:09:19] things together and I look at how one
[1:09:20] group of people reacts and then I try to
[1:09:22] compare it to another group so if
[1:09:25] if you
[1:09:27] looked in our history
[1:09:29] and you see that a lot of people in the
[1:09:33] transit transatlantic slave trade they
[1:09:35] pulled uh Africans and they brought them
[1:09:38] over here and probably about I don't
[1:09:41] know a couple hundred years slavery goes
[1:09:43] on and they they pull these people out
[1:09:46] of their land and they put them in this
[1:09:48] place they don't recognize people but
[1:09:50] they're just torn apart and then placed
[1:09:53] here and they're given some new name
[1:09:55] that they don't even recognize it
[1:09:57] doesn't sound like the culture they're
[1:09:58] from then they're they're they're told
[1:10:01] to socialize with people they don't know
[1:10:03] just because of what they look like and
[1:10:05] then fast forward 200 years and none of
[1:10:07] these people even know what their
[1:10:09] ancestors religion was right so that's
[1:10:12] just 200. now these people are here for
[1:10:14] 400 years you got to picture that now
[1:10:18] then the life of an Israelite 400 years
[1:10:21] did they even know the god of Abraham
[1:10:23] like to be honest every if they didn't
[1:10:25] have a Bible they didn't have job they
[1:10:28] probably had job The Book of Job that's
[1:10:30] it but I don't I doubt they actually had
[1:10:32] it and were able to read because you
[1:10:34] know why would you want to teach them to
[1:10:35] read their history why would you want to
[1:10:37] do something like that so
[1:10:40] I can picture in their minds I think
[1:10:42] it's just a miracle it's even more of a
[1:10:44] miracle that Jesus learned from no sorry
[1:10:46] not Jesus Moses learned from his mother
[1:10:48] what his job was as his deliverer how
[1:10:51] God had to watch that family line and
[1:10:54] make sure they passed it from word of
[1:10:55] mouth all the way down there to make
[1:10:58] sure it got to Moses that he realizes
[1:11:00] that he's the deliverer even though he
[1:11:02] went about it the wrong way but still
[1:11:03] his mom had to teach him that God
[1:11:06] predestinated it that way so it's just a
[1:11:09] miracle to me how did they ugh can you
[1:11:12] imagine and then they get to this point
[1:11:15] and I don't think they understood that a
[1:11:17] lot of prophets before uh before
[1:11:20] um Moses and before Joseph actually
[1:11:22] actually before Joseph they probably
[1:11:24] knew Joseph at best but they probably uh
[1:11:28] didn't realize there were a lot of
[1:11:29] prophets before Joseph who had been
[1:11:31] talking to God about Egypt and God was
[1:11:34] not telling them to stay in Egypt so he
[1:11:36] realized that Joseph had brought them
[1:11:37] there yes that's great and they got out
[1:11:39] of the fam and everything but when the
[1:11:41] famine was over they didn't realize they
[1:11:43] were supposed to leave they probably
[1:11:45] didn't understand that God had already
[1:11:47] talked to Abraham right here
[1:11:49] so actually I don't know which verse is
[1:11:51] I probably messed up the slide somewhat
[1:11:53] but I want to go to Genesis 26.
[1:11:57] verse 2
[1:11:58] um
[1:11:59] it says in the Lord and this is God
[1:12:01] talking to Isaac actually it says and
[1:12:04] the Lord appeared unto him and said go
[1:12:05] not down into Egypt dwell in the land
[1:12:07] which I shall tell you God he's saying
[1:12:09] don't go to Egypt
[1:12:10] sojourn in this land and I will be with
[1:12:13] thee and bless thee For unto thee and
[1:12:15] unto thy seed I will give all these
[1:12:17] countries and I will perform the oath
[1:12:18] that I swear unto Abraham that father so
[1:12:20] he's referring to that Prophecy from
[1:12:22] before now I want to go over to Genesis
[1:12:25] chapter 50. you realize Joseph had that
[1:12:27] Revelation that they were not supposed
[1:12:29] to stay there but this is before the 400
[1:12:31] years of slavery so this is Genesis
[1:12:34] chapter 50 24 and Joseph said unto his
[1:12:36] Brethren I die and God will surely visit
[1:12:38] you and bring you out of this land unto
[1:12:40] the land which he swear unto Abraham to
[1:12:42] Isaac and to Jacob and Joseph took an
[1:12:44] oath of the children of Israel saying
[1:12:46] God will surely visit you and ye shall
[1:12:48] carry up my bones from hence he didn't
[1:12:50] even want his bones over there he
[1:12:52] realized that's not what his generation
[1:12:54] was called to do so even though the
[1:12:57] prophet might have taken you to a place
[1:12:58] he might be pointing you somewhere else
[1:13:01] they might point you to somewhere that
[1:13:03] he doesn't get to it might point you to
[1:13:05] something that he doesn't reach but
[1:13:07] he'll be pointing up ahead and you have
[1:13:08] to use his word and follow his word to
[1:13:11] get there right you with me right all
[1:13:14] right
[1:13:16] and uh actually Genesis chapter 49 this
[1:13:19] is where Jacob dies verse 28 and all
[1:13:22] these are the 12 tribes of Israel and
[1:13:25] this is it that their father spake unto
[1:13:26] them and bless them so this is Jacob
[1:13:28] talking to his sons everyone according
[1:13:30] to his Blessing he blessed them and he
[1:13:32] charged them and say it unto them I am
[1:13:34] to be gathered unto my people bury me
[1:13:36] with my fathers in the cave that is in
[1:13:38] the field of Ephron the hintite that
[1:13:40] cave was not in Egypt the field was not
[1:13:42] in Egypt
[1:13:43] what Abraham purchased for them to have
[1:13:46] as a burial ground was not in Egypt
[1:13:48] there was nothing in their future that
[1:13:50] was for Egypt beyond the famine
[1:13:53] okay so I realized that the Israelites
[1:13:56] they were in this uh interesting
[1:13:57] position
[1:13:58] where they were called for something
[1:14:00] more but they just sat there and I'm not
[1:14:03] saying they could have just left I'm
[1:14:04] just saying that
[1:14:06] at the beginning you got to realize
[1:14:07] Joseph had it made whenever he was first
[1:14:10] whenever he brought his family there
[1:14:11] before they multiplied and increased
[1:14:13] more than the Egyptians at the beginning
[1:14:16] before Joseph died and the pharaoh who
[1:14:18] knew not Joseph actually started to
[1:14:21] enslave them before all of that they had
[1:14:23] a chance to leave
[1:14:25] nobody was stopping them from leaving
[1:14:27] they got comfortable and then they sat
[1:14:30] there and while they were comfortable
[1:14:33] and didn't step into the vision of what
[1:14:35] they were told to do
[1:14:38] honestly they just sat there and then
[1:14:40] their rights were gradually taken away
[1:14:42] one by one one by one their ripe system
[1:14:46] you see if you want to enslave somebody
[1:14:47] you don't just do it up front to their
[1:14:50] face just like that you tell them you
[1:14:52] can't do that
[1:14:53] just one little thing it's like all
[1:14:55] right all right I'm comfortable
[1:14:56] everywhere else here you can take that
[1:14:58] one thing from me right and it's a
[1:15:00] slippery slope downhill from there
[1:15:02] so they reached this point
[1:15:05] where they are enslaved and they've
[1:15:07] forgotten who they were and they don't
[1:15:09] know the words of the prophets they
[1:15:11] don't realize what they were called to
[1:15:13] do
[1:15:14] so
[1:15:16] uh I hope you realize I'm typing this to
[1:15:19] us you know and it's down to an
[1:15:21] individual level you can look at what
[1:15:23] the prophet said you can look at
[1:15:24] whatever whatever the Branham said but
[1:15:26] you got to realize he he's passed away
[1:15:29] so I I honestly don't see him as a
[1:15:33] perfect person because if he was a
[1:15:34] perfect person he probably would have
[1:15:35] been like Enoch and Zoop out of here
[1:15:37] right so if he passed away what is he
[1:15:42] pointing me to that he was talking about
[1:15:43] so much why is it so important that I
[1:15:45] need to read what he's saying and that
[1:15:47] to me that's the Rapture that's it he
[1:15:49] didn't make it there he didn't take a
[1:15:51] Rapture yet and him without us will not
[1:15:53] be made perfect right so that means he's
[1:15:57] calling me to something I have to
[1:15:58] realize my place in the word that he
[1:16:00] spoke and actually take that place step
[1:16:02] four now I heard somebody talking about
[1:16:05] I don't know what point in the service
[1:16:06] someone was talking about a theophany in
[1:16:09] in uh stepping into that theophany I
[1:16:11] realized you know there
[1:16:13] it is a lot easier to do that than you
[1:16:15] think you realize your theophany is your
[1:16:17] perfected body your glorified body it's
[1:16:19] like the perfect
[1:16:21] image of what God has of you right so
[1:16:24] whenever he gives you his word it's to
[1:16:26] step into that theophany
[1:16:28] so I'm not doing jumping jacks here this
[1:16:30] is common sense if he's telling me to
[1:16:31] step into something I have to picture
[1:16:34] that for myself and have faith in my own
[1:16:36] heart that God will put me in that
[1:16:38] position so if he tells me in his word
[1:16:41] that he's going to heal me my theophany
[1:16:44] is not sick that means I'm not supposed
[1:16:47] to be sick if I'm not supposed to be
[1:16:49] sick I'm gonna step into that vision and
[1:16:51] it's like easy just step into what that
[1:16:54] vision is he happens with you if I have
[1:16:56] a broken heart if I have sorrow in my
[1:16:58] life that means I know my theophany is
[1:17:02] not supposed to be like that I was not
[1:17:04] born to be like that and if I was not
[1:17:06] born to be like that I'm gonna step into
[1:17:08] what he told me to be I can do that
[1:17:11] right now when I claim my healing when I
[1:17:13] claim that word in my life and how it
[1:17:15] changes me I'm already stepping into it
[1:17:18] it might be a long slow process I might
[1:17:20] not realize it right now how he's Gonna
[1:17:23] Change Me by that point but I'm already
[1:17:25] stepping into it one little step by one
[1:17:28] step at a time I don't have to stop
[1:17:30] anywhere I just have to keep taking the
[1:17:32] word at its value and realize that's for
[1:17:34] me I need to keep walking into that
[1:17:38] theophany it might look amazing at the
[1:17:41] end depending the the difference between
[1:17:43] me at the end and me at the beginning
[1:17:45] you won't even recognize me I'm gonna
[1:17:48] look so different and I can claim that
[1:17:50] right now
[1:17:51] right now why wait
[1:17:56] that's my theophany
[1:17:59] and I'm claiming that for me right now
[1:18:01] but I'm
[1:18:03] friends it's for all of us
[1:18:06] it actually brings me to my next quote
[1:18:08] brother Branham
[1:18:12] he said
[1:18:14] amen
[1:18:16] in the Intervale 1956.
[1:18:19] he says
[1:18:21] you gotta realize this is for everybody
[1:18:23] I'm not just pumped up for here for me
[1:18:25] myself I'm excited for you he says God's
[1:18:30] no respective person
[1:18:33] or God doesn't respect persons he wants
[1:18:36] all of his children to have the same
[1:18:40] amen next slide please
[1:18:43] he wouldn't a righteous father wouldn't
[1:18:45] give one a dish of ice cream without
[1:18:47] giving them all ice cream
[1:18:49] certainly he wants you to live and I'm
[1:18:51] not talking about gifts I'm talking
[1:18:53] about Grace he's not talking about
[1:18:54] preaching he's not saying all y'all need
[1:18:56] to be actually it's on the next slide it
[1:18:58] doesn't mean all of us need to sing I
[1:19:00] realize I'm not supposed to sing
[1:19:02] I don't have that gift
[1:19:04] he's talking about Grace
[1:19:07] now of course some are called Apostles
[1:19:09] and Prophets and teachers and
[1:19:10] evangelists and church offices and so
[1:19:12] forth God placed in the church these
[1:19:15] things but I'm talking about measures of
[1:19:18] Grace
[1:19:19] overcoming Grace to each one then he
[1:19:21] elects you to your office
[1:19:23] but then
[1:19:25] in but in Grace God has given us to us
[1:19:28] all freely as we have need everything
[1:19:30] that we have need of so when he's
[1:19:32] promising you different things in his
[1:19:34] word it's for everybody
[1:19:36] it's not just for oh that sister in that
[1:19:39] Churchill she's got so much Faith it's
[1:19:41] all for her she can get all of that she
[1:19:43] can I need to go to her to pray for me
[1:19:45] no I don't
[1:19:47] no I don't I don't need an intermediary
[1:19:49] that's not what that's about come on now
[1:19:52] that's me that's for me she can pray for
[1:19:56] her and that's fine I'm gonna pray for
[1:19:58] me I'll pray for her too because I love
[1:20:01] her but I'm claiming this for me this is
[1:20:04] mine
[1:20:07] so if you
[1:20:09] if you think of uh
[1:20:12] something like if you I know some
[1:20:15] a lot of you have been on YouTube and
[1:20:19] um yeah they're ads it got a lot a lot
[1:20:21] worse but at the beginning basically all
[1:20:24] you had to do was have an internet
[1:20:25] connection and you can attack you can go
[1:20:27] to YouTube and you can you can subscribe
[1:20:30] and you won't see ads or nothing and you
[1:20:33] go there you can still do that and
[1:20:34] you're gonna have ads but it's free you
[1:20:37] know if you go there and you you
[1:20:38] subscribe to a channel and you get there
[1:20:41] like let's say let's say you watch The
[1:20:42] Chosen I watched The Chosen it's a good
[1:20:44] Bible show it's great it's free on
[1:20:46] YouTube you can watch it on there so if
[1:20:47] I go there
[1:20:49] I
[1:20:50] I don't pay when I go there I'm cheap
[1:20:53] I've never I've never contributed to the
[1:20:56] chosen I probably should because it's a
[1:20:58] great show but it's it's wonderful and
[1:21:00] they say it's for everybody so if I go
[1:21:03] there and I'm like all right this is
[1:21:05] free and I'm gonna like go there and
[1:21:08] I'll expect the same quality every time
[1:21:10] I show up
[1:21:11] even though I did not pay for this I
[1:21:14] expect the same quality so whenever you
[1:21:17] go to God's word and he's saying this is
[1:21:19] for everybody
[1:21:20] and you look in there you realize the
[1:21:24] quality is there you should expect what
[1:21:26] you're asking for because he told you
[1:21:28] you're supposed to get it
[1:21:30] I don't have to bargain I have that
[1:21:33] internet connection I have the
[1:21:34] connection like I got that I got the
[1:21:37] Wi-Fi I no password needed I just go up
[1:21:41] there and I'm like hey God it's in your
[1:21:43] word why don't you
[1:21:45] hey there a lot of these have no
[1:21:47] conditions
[1:21:50] what was the Holy Ghost given for 1959
[1:21:52] you take a person that's lived a good
[1:21:54] life but they're always defeated
[1:21:57] oh I tell you good person oh sure I love
[1:22:00] the Lord Brother Brandon always defeated
[1:22:02] they never get a prayer answered
[1:22:05] you feel that little woman with a holy
[1:22:07] ghost one time watch what takes place
[1:22:09] when she goes before the Lord before God
[1:22:12] she is not defeated she comes boldly to
[1:22:15] the fluent of God believing she has a
[1:22:17] right because she's a daughter of God by
[1:22:19] a birth
[1:22:21] take that little man so cowardly the
[1:22:23] Boss Kick him all over the place say
[1:22:24] wait a minute here now something changed
[1:22:27] see he's got the Holy Ghost it gives you
[1:22:28] power your life is full of power it
[1:22:31] gives you power in speech see this power
[1:22:34] in speech it's a two-edged sword you can
[1:22:37] it it
[1:22:39] gives you power to talk to people
[1:22:42] who are trying to take advantage of you
[1:22:44] that's that's the example of the man at
[1:22:46] work but it's also the other Edge it
[1:22:48] gives you power to talk to God
[1:22:50] you can't come boldly to the throne of
[1:22:52] God unless you've met his requirements
[1:22:55] when you meet his requirements come
[1:22:57] boldly like I I can stand here with my
[1:23:00] back straight and pray for something I
[1:23:02] can pray for my brother my sister
[1:23:03] whatever the needs are
[1:23:06] in Hebrews chapter 4 he's actually
[1:23:07] quoting
[1:23:09] uh verse 14. it says seeing them that we
[1:23:12] have a great high priest that is passed
[1:23:14] into the heavens Jesus the son of God
[1:23:16] let us hold fast our profession we have
[1:23:19] not on high priests which cannot be
[1:23:21] touched with the feeling of our
[1:23:22] infirmities but was in all points
[1:23:24] tempted like as we are yet without sin
[1:23:26] Let Us therefore come boldly unto the
[1:23:30] throne of grace that throne of grace
[1:23:32] that we may obtain mercy and find Grace
[1:23:35] to help in time of need so that Grace
[1:23:38] it's not just about salvation
[1:23:40] that Grace is about everything you have
[1:23:42] need of in your Earthly walk see I
[1:23:45] thought oh God's grace is just about ooh
[1:23:47] my sins are gone so much grace I didn't
[1:23:49] realize you need Grace just to stand in
[1:23:51] front of him
[1:23:52] you need Grace every day for all of
[1:23:54] those things that you keep failing at
[1:23:56] you need Grace for everything you're
[1:23:58] asking for because it's just by his
[1:24:00] grace that you receive
[1:24:04] so actually
[1:24:06] all of that is uh I have this under a
[1:24:08] category called entitlement so that was
[1:24:11] positive entitlement right now we're
[1:24:13] going to talk about negative entitlement
[1:24:15] and that means all right I meet his
[1:24:19] requirements I you know you might have
[1:24:22] the the perfect experience according to
[1:24:26] spiritual Realms and stuff you know you
[1:24:28] might okay all right Justified
[1:24:29] Sanctified baptism the Holy Ghost and
[1:24:31] then sit here
[1:24:34] that's that's negative entitlement and
[1:24:37] that's for me because I know I have the
[1:24:39] Holy Ghost but I also know I'm entitled
[1:24:41] in a bad way you know I hear I hear
[1:24:44] people talk about oh these younger
[1:24:45] Generations they're so they're so
[1:24:47] entitled ah they're asking for all this
[1:24:49] stuff not everything's supposed to be
[1:24:50] handed to you and it's like all right
[1:24:52] well if they had that attitude about
[1:24:54] God's word they'd have a lot more than
[1:24:56] you do right because God just gives
[1:24:58] freely you don't need to earn anything
[1:25:00] with God but if I could just tap into
[1:25:03] that attitude and think about that but
[1:25:06] in terms of God's word
[1:25:08] I'm not going to be denied anything
[1:25:10] anything
[1:25:15] but then if you are sitting there with a
[1:25:19] negative version of entitlement you're
[1:25:20] just going to sit there and expect God
[1:25:22] to just change you and you're not even
[1:25:24] going to do what he tells you to do you
[1:25:26] still have the Holy Ghost you're still
[1:25:27] sealed but if you're not telling doing
[1:25:29] what he tells you to he's going to force
[1:25:31] you because if he doesn't Force you
[1:25:34] you're not gonna make it so you may as
[1:25:36] well just walk into what he's telling
[1:25:38] you to do right
[1:25:40] I actually have a quote here from C.S
[1:25:43] Lewis he um
[1:25:45] drawn a blank he he wrote The Chronicles
[1:25:48] of Narnia and the screw tape letters if
[1:25:50] you like reading this group tape letters
[1:25:52] is a very nice book
[1:25:53] um
[1:25:54] but he says God is not so much offended
[1:25:56] that we want too much as by the fact
[1:25:59] that we are satisfied with so little
[1:26:03] you could stop it right there
[1:26:10] he ain't the prophet but that was good
[1:26:13] the next line though he offers us oh
[1:26:18] yeah you can he says though he offers us
[1:26:22] the highest of Adventures in our
[1:26:24] Christian Life we settle for the stale
[1:26:27] mediocrity of our lukewarm religious
[1:26:29] routines
[1:26:31] not that that right there it don't
[1:26:35] matter I'm not I'm not trying to preach
[1:26:36] off of what he said but it's hard not to
[1:26:40] that hits everybody at every level it
[1:26:43] doesn't matter if you've been baptized
[1:26:44] not baptized doesn't matter if you're
[1:26:46] Justified not justified doesn't matter
[1:26:47] if you have the Holy Ghost or not
[1:26:49] everybody is living beneath their
[1:26:52] privileges
[1:26:54] because if if I was living to my
[1:26:57] potential I wouldn't be here if you were
[1:27:00] living to your potential we'd be perfect
[1:27:02] in God
[1:27:04] so that's for me that's for everybody
[1:27:07] we just need to ask and walk into what
[1:27:09] he tells us to do
[1:27:11] and Oneness
[1:27:15] 1962 what is it you got to get with the
[1:27:18] word get yourself killed out I'm
[1:27:20] persuaded that many of us friends have
[1:27:21] received the Holy Ghost but we just
[1:27:23] receive enough holy ghost in us to make
[1:27:27] us to a place where we don't want to lie
[1:27:29] we don't want to steal we don't want to
[1:27:32] do anything but God wants us to fill
[1:27:35] every fiber of his church he wants us he
[1:27:38] wants to fill your thinking and he wants
[1:27:39] to fill your mind he wants to fill every
[1:27:41] bit of you just make you completely
[1:27:43] totally dead to yourself or to your
[1:27:46] thinking just so surrendered in God till
[1:27:48] his words just living right through you
[1:27:49] you don't know nothing else but God's
[1:27:51] word just stay right with his word it is
[1:27:54] life amen it is life I want him to fill
[1:27:58] me with life I want to live for him to
[1:28:01] where there's nothing I do that is not
[1:28:03] according to his will am I there yet no
[1:28:07] do I want to be yes what do I have to do
[1:28:09] walk in it he said who was praying and
[1:28:11] said read your Bible and pray was it
[1:28:13] your brother Solomon was it yeah read
[1:28:14] your Bible and pray it's not that hard I
[1:28:17] know I'm using a lot of words to say
[1:28:18] this but seriously read your Bible and
[1:28:20] pray like there isn't much else and then
[1:28:23] walking what he tells you to do because
[1:28:24] if you're reading your Bible and you're
[1:28:26] praying you're gonna do what he tells
[1:28:27] you to do that's all there is to it
[1:28:31] and and that brings you to the point
[1:28:33] where you're in Hebrews 10 too uh Part B
[1:28:36] it says because that the worshipers once
[1:28:38] Purge should have had no more conscience
[1:28:40] of sins you shouldn't have to worry
[1:28:42] about whether you're sinning or not
[1:28:44] because you're stepping out of his will
[1:28:46] because you always know what his will is
[1:28:48] you always do that which pleases the
[1:28:50] father
[1:28:52] you know
[1:28:54] that actually makes me think
[1:28:56] uh that you got to realize God God's
[1:28:59] trying to push you to something no
[1:29:01] matter what state you're Christianity
[1:29:02] you're at he's pushing you to something
[1:29:03] it might be a soft push it might be a
[1:29:05] hard push depending on how you're
[1:29:06] yielding to him it can just be a soft
[1:29:08] push all the time if you just do what he
[1:29:10] tells you to do
[1:29:12] but you got to realize he's pushing from
[1:29:14] one end
[1:29:15] and
[1:29:17] there's an adversary and a lot of people
[1:29:20] don't really talk about the devil that
[1:29:22] much but he's a person
[1:29:23] and he's at the other end and he's
[1:29:25] pushing you the other way
[1:29:27] so if he's pushing you the other way you
[1:29:29] got to realize there's a struggle going
[1:29:30] on
[1:29:32] and those are those are
[1:29:35] let me pause on that right there
[1:29:38] you see God God is actually calling you
[1:29:39] to to something
[1:29:41] more and and there are some scriptures
[1:29:43] where Jesus is talking uh I think Peter
[1:29:46] has one uh Luke 6 36 and he says a
[1:29:51] statement he says be therefore merciful
[1:29:54] as your father also is merciful so you
[1:29:55] read something like that in your
[1:29:57] scripture you're like okay I'll try to
[1:29:58] be merciful I won't be mad at people
[1:30:00] I'll just give him a little Mercy I can
[1:30:02] do that
[1:30:03] and then you get to First Peter 1 16
[1:30:06] it's like okay because it is written be
[1:30:08] holy for I am Holy
[1:30:11] can I do that
[1:30:13] 100 of the time can I do that can me
[1:30:16] I'll try but the best I'll be is a
[1:30:20] Pharisee because that's the best example
[1:30:21] ever in the Bible they were they were
[1:30:23] clean they were perfect they did
[1:30:25] everything the law told them to do by
[1:30:26] the letter and then they came up with
[1:30:28] new rules because they loved rules so
[1:30:30] much and they became traditions and it's
[1:30:32] like all right I'm so holy yeah
[1:30:36] and then you get to this one in Matthew
[1:30:37] 5 48 be therefore perfect even as your
[1:30:42] father which is in heaven is perfect
[1:30:43] it's like all right I'm not doing this I
[1:30:47] can't do this nobody like I I can't be
[1:30:50] perfect because I don't know what that
[1:30:52] is
[1:30:52] I don't know what perfect Aaron looks
[1:30:55] like
[1:30:55] without the word
[1:30:57] I don't know what that looks like right
[1:31:03] then Israel in the church 1953 so
[1:31:05] brother Brown's talking about he says be
[1:31:07] therefore perfect even as your father in
[1:31:10] Heaven is perfect how could you ever be
[1:31:12] perfect but in the sight of Christ
[1:31:14] tonight every born-again Christian is
[1:31:17] perfect
[1:31:18] I'm just as perfect and God as Christ
[1:31:20] was you are to every other believer for
[1:31:22] it's not my Holiness it's his holiness
[1:31:25] God can't accept mine I have none but I
[1:31:27] come in Christ by faith and by Christ I
[1:31:29] in him imperfect in the sight of God
[1:31:32] so I I don't know if you've seen my
[1:31:34] title it's a slightly better situation
[1:31:35] so it's uh thank you and it's
[1:31:39] it's um
[1:31:41] it's it's basically about what you're
[1:31:43] settling for
[1:31:44] you got to realize we've all hit a point
[1:31:46] but we haven't hit the perfect point we
[1:31:49] haven't hit the holy point I a lot of us
[1:31:52] having to hit the merciful Point that's
[1:31:53] me I get mad at people all the time
[1:31:56] I have a job it happens
[1:31:59] you know and it's
[1:32:03] without him for it's not my Holiness
[1:32:06] it's his Holiness if I let him fill
[1:32:09] every fiber of my being am I not holy
[1:32:12] if I let him fill every bit of me with
[1:32:15] his Holy Ghost and let him continue to
[1:32:17] work on me am I not perfect eventually
[1:32:21] if I let him take over entirely will I
[1:32:24] not be merciful and those are just a few
[1:32:26] of the things he's asking us to do you
[1:32:28] could read the Beatitudes and it's like
[1:32:30] all right the sermon on the mountain
[1:32:31] with Jesus telling us things it's like
[1:32:33] blessed are all these people I can't
[1:32:35] even be half of those people just me I
[1:32:38] can't I can only do like one or two
[1:32:40] in and even then it won't be perfect
[1:32:43] it'll just be me yeah
[1:32:45] yeah so
[1:32:49] so why am I not there
[1:32:51] why are we not there church yeah
[1:32:54] so 1961 perfect strength by Perfect
[1:32:57] weakness it's good title
[1:33:00] there that's it we smother him out we
[1:33:03] drive him away with our from the poorest
[1:33:05] poorest of us to the richest of us from
[1:33:06] the least to the greatest we keep God
[1:33:08] out of our Lives because they're our own
[1:33:10] selves
[1:33:11] so that's why I say there's a common
[1:33:13] there's a common problem here see
[1:33:15] Satan and God have the same problem as
[1:33:17] you
[1:33:18] it's like okay you gotta realize
[1:33:22] it's you because whatever their agenda
[1:33:26] is they can't do it without you
[1:33:29] so God's having trouble pushing you one
[1:33:32] way Satan's having trouble pushing it's
[1:33:34] not God versus
[1:33:36] it's you like and if it's all on you how
[1:33:41] much more power do you have in the
[1:33:42] spiritual war how much more power
[1:33:46] you can tell Satan's not today I'm not
[1:33:49] gonna do it and what are you gonna do
[1:33:50] nothing you can't do anything
[1:33:56] he'll keep trying he'll try to make you
[1:33:57] scared but
[1:33:59] next part of that quote I've often said
[1:34:02] the greatest enemy I got is William
[1:34:03] Branham he's the one that gets in God's
[1:34:05] way he's the one that gets lazy he's the
[1:34:08] one that gets to a place sometimes where
[1:34:09] he thinks he can do something about it
[1:34:11] and when he does that shoves God right
[1:34:13] out of the picture so you can be serving
[1:34:16] God to the best of your ability
[1:34:18] but not doing what he's telling you to
[1:34:20] do and you shove him out of the way
[1:34:24] but when I can get rid of that guy when
[1:34:26] I can get to a place where he is out of
[1:34:28] the way then God can come over and do
[1:34:29] things that William Branham knows
[1:34:31] nothing about that's when God can use
[1:34:33] you that's when he can use any of you he
[1:34:36] can use anybody when we get out of the
[1:34:38] way but as long as we got ourselves in
[1:34:40] the way then we cannot
[1:34:42] so I'm talking about God's side he's
[1:34:44] really pushing you to do something but
[1:34:46] you got to realize there's somebody in
[1:34:48] each of us who we are catering to
[1:34:51] and that's the third person so there's
[1:34:54] God there's Satan and then there's a
[1:34:56] third person which is you
[1:35:01] it's me it's me too
[1:35:04] they're three people just fighting away
[1:35:06] all right in my life you know I'm not
[1:35:09] going to say Satan's in here but God's
[1:35:11] in here and he's trying to fight Satan
[1:35:13] and I just need to pick a side
[1:35:16] I just need to pick a side that's it
[1:35:20] if you have a vote and there's only
[1:35:22] three people voting when one person
[1:35:24] votes one way and yellow and votes the
[1:35:26] other way who's the tiebreaker raise
[1:35:28] your hand it's you you're the tiebreaker
[1:35:31] vote for God
[1:35:33] yes
[1:35:37] amen make Aaron great again
[1:35:45] that's still Maga isn't it
[1:35:48] I didn't realize okay
[1:35:57] okay so in in Genesis chapter 4 verse 6
[1:36:02] I think is where you have the first
[1:36:03] example
[1:36:05] of God referring to that guy in there in
[1:36:08] here he's talking to Cain and says and
[1:36:10] the Lord said unto Cain why are thou
[1:36:12] wrath and why is thy countenance Fallen
[1:36:13] if thou doest well shalt thou not be
[1:36:16] accepted and if thou doest not well sin
[1:36:18] lieth at the door and unto thee shall be
[1:36:20] his desire so that's a person
[1:36:23] and thou shalt rule over him see that
[1:36:26] that desire
[1:36:29] Cain could have done the right thing
[1:36:32] and still been Justified
[1:36:35] if he had brought the sacrifice and
[1:36:37] followed the word of the Lord like Abel
[1:36:39] had see Cain had much more reason
[1:36:42] than Abel
[1:36:44] to
[1:36:46] he had much more reason than able to do
[1:36:50] the right thing and shed the blood
[1:36:52] sacrifice for his sin because he had
[1:36:54] that nature in him that was from the
[1:36:57] Devil so you're talking about that
[1:36:59] nature and and I I I'm not saying that
[1:37:02] you guys are serpent seat I'm not doing
[1:37:04] any of that I'm saying that there is
[1:37:06] a character inside each and every one of
[1:37:09] us who we have to fight so Cain had that
[1:37:12] character and sure it's it doesn't seem
[1:37:15] fair he didn't he didn't try to make his
[1:37:17] daddy somebody he couldn't choose who
[1:37:19] his daddy was but he had a nature in
[1:37:21] there and a character from somewhere
[1:37:23] that was not of God and since he didn't
[1:37:26] yield it to God
[1:37:28] and do right then lay at the door and it
[1:37:32] caught him just like that he did the
[1:37:34] wrong thing
[1:37:36] but if we go all the way to Romans
[1:37:38] chapter six for six to seven it's um it
[1:37:40] says knowing this that our old man is
[1:37:42] crucified with him that the body of sin
[1:37:44] might be destroyed that henceforth we
[1:37:47] should not serve sin for he that is dead
[1:37:50] is freed from sin so if you die out to
[1:37:52] yourself and you're actually following
[1:37:54] God in his will you will die you'll be
[1:37:57] completely dead and God will have no
[1:38:00] other choice but to fill you with his
[1:38:02] life
[1:38:03] then you'll be really living because you
[1:38:05] don't know what it's like without that
[1:38:07] it's different
[1:38:10] also in John 8 34 still referring to the
[1:38:14] same thing Jesus is saying Jesus
[1:38:16] answered them verily verily I say unto
[1:38:18] you whosoever committed sin is the
[1:38:19] servant of sin and the servant abideth
[1:38:22] not in the house forever but the son
[1:38:23] abideth ever if the son therefore shall
[1:38:26] make you free ye shall be free indeed
[1:38:31] you know uh
[1:38:33] also in Thessalonians I'm just talking
[1:38:35] about the man of sin just just keep
[1:38:37] noticing there's that third guy who's
[1:38:39] got to give his vote
[1:38:41] um without money or without price 1959
[1:38:43] and how much more will it do to the old
[1:38:45] then that has rejected the new birth
[1:38:47] because only as your life has changed
[1:38:50] and you've been converted and born Anew
[1:38:51] into the kingdom of God your nature will
[1:38:54] still be of the things of the world no
[1:38:56] matter how religious you are no matter
[1:38:58] what you do unless that has been changed
[1:39:01] in you you could worship and be
[1:39:03] religious but still that will have some
[1:39:06] kind of a drawing power to you because
[1:39:08] this old man of sin and his desires is
[1:39:11] not dead in you yet
[1:39:13] but once let Christ take the throne in
[1:39:16] your heart those things don't matter it
[1:39:18] is so much greater see
[1:39:21] um there's the scripture in
[1:39:22] Thessalonians which I I believe he's
[1:39:24] referring to because he's talking about
[1:39:25] the man of sin
[1:39:27] um in second Thessalonians it says let
[1:39:29] no man deceive you by any means for that
[1:39:31] day shall not come except there coming a
[1:39:33] fallen away person that man of sin be
[1:39:35] revealed the son of perpetition so I
[1:39:37] understand if you go to the the table
[1:39:39] app and message and you type in Man of
[1:39:41] sin he's usually talking about you know
[1:39:44] the the
[1:39:45] satanic worship he's talking about the
[1:39:47] pope and all these things but this quote
[1:39:48] that I just read here he's talking about
[1:39:51] you he said you could worship and be
[1:39:53] religious
[1:39:54] he says
[1:39:56] um wait where did he say the Madison
[1:39:58] okay because this old man of sin and his
[1:40:00] desires is not dead in you yet so that
[1:40:03] could be yeah sure you can put it on
[1:40:05] some foreign power way out there I'm not
[1:40:07] I'm not fighting that man of sin
[1:40:09] personally
[1:40:10] he he doesn't affect my life on a daily
[1:40:13] basis honestly if I'm taking this word
[1:40:16] and applying it to me I'm gonna talk
[1:40:18] about the personal one for now once I
[1:40:20] deal with me I can worry about all that
[1:40:23] now you just realize there's a guy
[1:40:26] there's a there's a throne in your heart
[1:40:29] and two people are vying for attention
[1:40:31] here you're going to give one the throne
[1:40:34] just like that with no fight no I'm not
[1:40:37] gonna give it to him I'm gonna give it
[1:40:38] to the one who who loves me who told me
[1:40:40] about the throne in the first place the
[1:40:42] one who sits he's king of all Kings he
[1:40:44] can be king of this Throne too I don't
[1:40:46] mind I'm gonna give it all to him I
[1:40:48] don't mind
[1:40:49] laughs
[1:40:52] and there's this other uh quote in 1962.
[1:40:57] it kind of hurts so
[1:40:59] um hang on to your seats it says for it
[1:41:01] for in forsaking all
[1:41:02] you see we want to hold on to everything
[1:41:05] that we can and then follow Jesus
[1:41:08] but sometimes Jesus wants to us to turn
[1:41:11] loose of everything so we can get both
[1:41:13] hands on him if I just let go of
[1:41:16] everything
[1:41:18] it's it's literally Jesus Take the Wheel
[1:41:20] let him do it
[1:41:22] who has the the strength to do that
[1:41:24] who's brave enough to do that that's
[1:41:26] what he's calling for right now
[1:41:29] sometimes we think that just because
[1:41:30] we've got a hole
[1:41:33] and there's this example in in um
[1:41:37] in uh Exodus we're still talking about
[1:41:40] the children of Israel that's where we
[1:41:41] started right so uh example I was
[1:41:43] thinking about it the other day and I
[1:41:45] realized you know if you go to the Book
[1:41:48] of Exodus you go to chapter 12 where
[1:41:49] he's talking about
[1:41:50] um where God's telling them to leave uh
[1:41:54] Egypt he's telling them what to bring on
[1:41:56] their Journey so he knows the beginning
[1:41:58] and the end he knows exactly what
[1:42:00] they're going to need
[1:42:01] and he tells them all right uh do this I
[1:42:03] think the scripture's there is it there
[1:42:04] okay yeah verse 31. and he called for
[1:42:09] Moses and Aaron by night and said rise
[1:42:11] up and get you forth from among my
[1:42:13] people both you and the children of
[1:42:15] Israel and go serve the Lord as ye have
[1:42:16] said also take your flocks in your herds
[1:42:19] as you have said and be gone and bless
[1:42:21] me also he said flocks and hurts count
[1:42:23] with me that's all he said right
[1:42:26] and the Egyptians were urgent upon the
[1:42:28] people that they might send them out of
[1:42:29] the land and haste but they said we be
[1:42:31] all dead men
[1:42:32] and the people took their dough before
[1:42:34] it was leaven their kneading troughs
[1:42:35] they're being brought up
[1:42:37] is it Charles
[1:42:39] needing jobs right yeah yeah okay being
[1:42:42] bound up in their clothes upon their
[1:42:45] shoulders so they got bread now where'd
[1:42:47] that come from right
[1:42:51] and the children of Israel did according
[1:42:52] to the word of Moses and they borrowed
[1:42:55] of the Egyptians jewels of silver and
[1:42:58] jewels of gold and Raymond
[1:43:01] so
[1:43:02] I I look at that and I'm like okay he
[1:43:04] told you to bring what was it uh it's
[1:43:07] cattle right
[1:43:08] floxin hurts yes flax flux and hurts
[1:43:10] that's it he didn't say to bring bread
[1:43:12] he didn't seem to say to bring silver he
[1:43:15] didn't say to bring gold Raymond nothing
[1:43:18] right and if you look at at the end of
[1:43:20] Exodus they came
[1:43:22] they came into the promised land and
[1:43:25] they were wearing hand-me-down clothes
[1:43:27] let's be honest all those people who
[1:43:29] died in the wilderness they gave their
[1:43:30] clothes to the other people because
[1:43:32] you know and there wasn't one stitch
[1:43:34] among them that was gone like nothing
[1:43:36] was torn God took care of them and they
[1:43:39] didn't need to bring kneading troughs
[1:43:41] they didn't need to bring that God gave
[1:43:42] them Manna so he told them exactly what
[1:43:44] they needed because he knew that they
[1:43:46] would need to give a sacrifice it's like
[1:43:48] all right flocks and hurts that's it
[1:43:50] and then all these extra things like
[1:43:53] gold and silver
[1:43:54] they take it all the way to the promised
[1:43:57] land they take it on their journey and
[1:44:00] it becomes an idol to them what did they
[1:44:04] do with that they took that in Exodus
[1:44:06] chapter 32 there's no slide for it and
[1:44:08] Aaron said unto them break off the
[1:44:10] Golden Earrings which are in the ears of
[1:44:12] your wives and your sons and your
[1:44:13] daughters and bring them unto me and all
[1:44:16] the people break off the Golden Earrings
[1:44:17] which are in their ears and brought them
[1:44:19] unto Aaron and he received them at their
[1:44:21] hand and fashioned it with a graving
[1:44:22] tool after he had made it a molten calf
[1:44:26] so they literally took something God
[1:44:28] that never told them to bring brought it
[1:44:31] with them into this new life and it
[1:44:33] becomes an idol to them
[1:44:35] we do the same exact thing people we do
[1:44:38] the same exact thing you might think oh
[1:44:41] yeah I'm saved now I I and then you just
[1:44:43] couldn't let go of one thing just one
[1:44:46] thing
[1:44:46] it doesn't have to be something that's
[1:44:48] physical it could be something that's
[1:44:50] spiritual too some people have this
[1:44:52] nature and this thing inside of them
[1:44:53] that they cannot fight no matter how
[1:44:55] long and no matter how long you live and
[1:44:59] how long they try to serve God they
[1:45:00] still cannot fight this one little thing
[1:45:03] and it becomes a snare into them then it
[1:45:05] can be an idol if you just end up just
[1:45:07] sitting there and you realize I I
[1:45:10] thought I was saved I thought I had the
[1:45:12] Holy Ghost because you can be the whole
[1:45:13] have the Holy Ghost and be insane that
[1:45:15] means there's something in there that
[1:45:16] shouldn't be there right so I thought I
[1:45:19] was saved I thought I was you know
[1:45:20] everything I did everything you told me
[1:45:22] to do and I'm just sitting here and it's
[1:45:23] like ah does that mean this isn't for me
[1:45:27] that you're starting to worship that
[1:45:29] Idol over there you think that thing is
[1:45:31] greater than God so you make it an idol
[1:45:34] you put it above God and then there's
[1:45:37] your idol right there there's a sister
[1:45:39] in our church
[1:45:40] and um
[1:45:42] she had this uh she had this
[1:45:45] years ago I I don't know I think I was
[1:45:47] still dating Becca and I was already
[1:45:49] telling her about it on the phone I was
[1:45:51] like okay there's a sister and I worry
[1:45:52] about her
[1:45:54] I I was honestly worried about her she's
[1:45:56] like 12 years younger than me and um I I
[1:45:59] I've always been worried about her I
[1:46:01] don't know why I just think of myself as
[1:46:03] an older brother she probably doesn't
[1:46:04] see me that way but I I pray for her
[1:46:07] even though she didn't know about it
[1:46:09] and um
[1:46:12] she had this uh this she had overcome
[1:46:15] something I don't know around that time
[1:46:17] when I told Becca about her it
[1:46:20] I'm not sure the whole testimony because
[1:46:22] she hasn't told me personally I just
[1:46:24] understand from different sources and
[1:46:27] the testimony she gave later
[1:46:30] um she had this
[1:46:31] the one of the spirits that Legion had
[1:46:33] she was self-inflicting
[1:46:36] so you could see these giant like cuts
[1:46:39] on our arms you still can the scars of
[1:46:41] her past you know and while I was
[1:46:44] praying for it like she didn't look like
[1:46:45] she had any friends but while I was
[1:46:47] praying for her she suddenly gets
[1:46:48] friends
[1:46:49] and then she starts having experiences
[1:46:52] in church and I'm just like yes
[1:46:53] everything's great and as far as I could
[1:46:55] tell with my eyes she was fine
[1:46:58] God answered my prayer I was so happy
[1:47:01] I was telling Rebecca how she's
[1:47:03] socializing now I was just so excited
[1:47:05] for us like everything's good but uh
[1:47:08] for some reason she still kept coming to
[1:47:10] the prayer line and I didn't know what
[1:47:12] was going on and I thought oh all right
[1:47:14] well girl she's fine right
[1:47:17] but she still keeps coming and it and
[1:47:20] not every not every prayer line she just
[1:47:22] come once in a while you see her go up
[1:47:24] in the prayer line so there was a youth
[1:47:26] meeting uh probably one or two weeks ago
[1:47:28] three I don't know
[1:47:29] um and
[1:47:31] I I'm in the prayer line because I'm one
[1:47:34] of the preachers and uh people start
[1:47:36] coming up there and all of us ministers
[1:47:37] are trying to help people in the prayer
[1:47:39] line some at the altar uh some coming
[1:47:41] straight in the line some people
[1:47:42] standing at the edge it was just packed
[1:47:44] so
[1:47:45] um I was just standing behind the
[1:47:47] brother who had preached his brother
[1:47:49] Ronnie long and um for some reason I
[1:47:53] I I'm not an emotional person and I
[1:47:56] almost never cry but um for some reason
[1:47:59] in that service in that prayer line I
[1:48:01] could not stop crying and you know for
[1:48:03] someone who doesn't cry I'm just like ah
[1:48:05] I don't know what to do my face doesn't
[1:48:06] stop and I'm still trying to pray for
[1:48:09] people
[1:48:10] and uh
[1:48:12] the sister comes in the prayer line
[1:48:14] again and um as far as I know
[1:48:18] she comes and she raises her hand she
[1:48:19] gets prayed for I don't know what was
[1:48:21] what was bothering her and um I didn't
[1:48:24] understand all that clicked in my head
[1:48:26] is like okay little sister crying I
[1:48:28] don't know why I just and I'm just
[1:48:31] praying as hard as I can for her and I
[1:48:33] don't know her situation because I
[1:48:34] didn't hear what she told Brother Ronnie
[1:48:35] so afterwards she comes over to the side
[1:48:38] and she prays on the altar
[1:48:41] and starts praying in the altar so I
[1:48:43] take a step back and I kneel down on the
[1:48:46] ground and I placed my hand there and
[1:48:48] I'm praying for her and there's another
[1:48:49] Minister brother who's who was telling
[1:48:51] her in her ears like okay try to confess
[1:48:53] it
[1:48:55] because
[1:48:56] and from what I gathered she'd been
[1:48:57] coming the prayer line over and over and
[1:49:00] getting prayed for but she had never
[1:49:02] confessed that she was delivered
[1:49:04] so since she never confessed that she
[1:49:06] was delivered she kept coming back in
[1:49:08] the prayer line so the brother and and
[1:49:10] uh a Minister's Wife they were over
[1:49:13] there on the side and they're just like
[1:49:14] telling her please just confess it out
[1:49:15] loud just claim it claim it and I I'm
[1:49:18] over there just praying and I prayed as
[1:49:21] hard as I could I could barely talk
[1:49:22] because I was still crying and then she
[1:49:25] um
[1:49:26] she spends the rest of the service still
[1:49:28] praying there you know and I don't know
[1:49:30] what it was
[1:49:31] but a day or two later she texts the
[1:49:35] whole church and she claims her healing
[1:49:37] and after that you should just see how
[1:49:40] happy she is like she she was happy
[1:49:43] before but she settled now like is
[1:49:47] there's a big difference between that
[1:49:48] and now like I could say she had all the
[1:49:51] experience that she needed to in Aaron's
[1:49:53] book the book of Aaron says she's fine
[1:49:56] she looks fine I can't see your spirit I
[1:49:59] can't see her soul but she looks fine to
[1:50:00] me and she has all these testimonies but
[1:50:03] she had claimed onto something and she
[1:50:05] broadcasted that paragraph of her
[1:50:07] testimony was so long she's saying I
[1:50:10] come in the prayer line so many times
[1:50:11] and I thought this would be just like
[1:50:13] any other day that came in the prayer
[1:50:15] line but I came there and something
[1:50:17] different happened
[1:50:19] now I can tell you there we come to
[1:50:21] church a lot and we all need a lot of
[1:50:24] things
[1:50:25] some things we've been praying for for
[1:50:27] years years
[1:50:29] I've been praying for a few years I've
[1:50:31] been praying for some stuff forever but
[1:50:33] if I realize that
[1:50:34] it doesn't have to be like every other
[1:50:37] day this is Sunday right it doesn't have
[1:50:39] to be like every other Sunday if you
[1:50:41] have something you're praying for
[1:50:43] and you came here and you heard
[1:50:44] something I said that would help you
[1:50:47] just speak Jesus
[1:50:50] accept it say it out loud confess it to
[1:50:54] somebody confess it to yourself argue
[1:50:56] with yourself it doesn't matter God can
[1:50:58] see and it might just make the
[1:51:01] difference between life and death might
[1:51:03] be the difference between you serving
[1:51:04] that little Idol inside of you in
[1:51:06] complete deliverance
[1:51:08] again this can affect everybody I'm not
[1:51:11] just talking to people who don't have
[1:51:12] the Holy Ghost I'm talking to everybody
[1:51:14] me too
[1:51:17] that affects all of us
[1:51:21] 1955 the ark brother Brandon says and
[1:51:23] now to one thing the man appliable in
[1:51:26] the hands of God could be a great thing
[1:51:28] to God or you could be a great thing to
[1:51:30] the devil
[1:51:33] again the same tape I think he says um
[1:51:38] in verse 89 uh
[1:51:41] let me skip over that no I have to
[1:51:44] read the whole thing okay no matter what
[1:51:46] you got here in this world what you
[1:51:49] haven't got Keep Your Heart Right in
[1:51:50] tune with God for it's all everything
[1:51:52] all your hopes lands all your money all
[1:51:55] your sickness all your health all your
[1:51:57] children all everything that you've got
[1:51:59] here on this Earth will everything leave
[1:52:01] you and you'll go right straight back to
[1:52:04] the beginning again if that's right with
[1:52:06] God you'll come forth again just as
[1:52:07] certain as there is a God in heaven it's
[1:52:09] not if it's not right with God you got
[1:52:12] to take the other out
[1:52:13] you're here to make a choice make it
[1:52:15] today for Christ
[1:52:20] here's what I was talking about a second
[1:52:21] ago and in this day the scripture is
[1:52:23] fulfilled 1965. uh I've voted once
[1:52:27] that was for Christ I got to win the
[1:52:30] devil voted against Me In Christ voted
[1:52:32] for me depends on which way I cast my
[1:52:34] vote I'm glad I cast it on him let the
[1:52:37] world say what they want to I still
[1:52:39] believe that he's the same yesterday and
[1:52:41] forever he'll prove it he certainly will
[1:52:44] just cast your vote
[1:52:46] cast your vote on the word whatever I
[1:52:48] said today if it helped and it's not me
[1:52:50] I'm reading this a lot of these are
[1:52:51] verbatim like 50 of what I say in a
[1:52:55] sermon is read off of the tape or or
[1:52:57] somebody else said it it's not me
[1:53:00] no I I uh that reminds me you're talking
[1:53:03] about brother bless who just passed I
[1:53:05] never I never met him but um
[1:53:08] I just I see the reactions of those
[1:53:10] people you have
[1:53:12] and uh I remember it was it was hitting
[1:53:14] Becca hard when she first heard it we
[1:53:16] were still in Indiana at that point when
[1:53:17] she heard about it and it started
[1:53:20] affecting me so then I come here in the
[1:53:21] service and I sit back there I'm
[1:53:22] listening to service and sister uh
[1:53:24] sister Birds uh starts uh giving
[1:53:28] singing her song and tribute and um
[1:53:31] it started bringing tears to my eyes why
[1:53:33] I've never met him
[1:53:35] I don't know him
[1:53:37] uh you gotta there's this place where
[1:53:40] brother Brandon's talking about
[1:53:42] um
[1:53:43] I don't know what he's talking about
[1:53:44] he's talking about uh Jesus saying that
[1:53:46] they garnish the tombs of the prophets
[1:53:48] and they're the ones who put them there
[1:53:49] but he says the statement which is was
[1:53:52] interesting he says The Testament is not
[1:53:54] enforced until the testator is dead
[1:53:58] says The Testament is not enforced until
[1:54:00] the testator is dead so if you're
[1:54:02] getting a will you're getting your
[1:54:03] inheritance that person has to die for
[1:54:07] you to get your inheritance from what
[1:54:08] they have
[1:54:09] so I see all these testimonies and the
[1:54:12] Saints passing on I see those those are
[1:54:13] Testaments you guys they could say Old
[1:54:16] Testament New Testament it's all
[1:54:17] Testaments put it all together it's one
[1:54:19] big Testament and you know it hits the
[1:54:22] book of Acts and it doesn't end there
[1:54:24] Testament continues Our Testimony what
[1:54:26] are we going to tell our kids it's more
[1:54:28] of a testament more of a testimony for
[1:54:30] them and and it's just like what are
[1:54:32] they going to say about me after I pass
[1:54:34] well
[1:54:34] I've never met brother Robles but just
[1:54:37] because his Spirit was so christ-like
[1:54:39] and he touched all of your hearts and
[1:54:42] those people I can see your reaction and
[1:54:43] affects me
[1:54:45] and I'm starting to think about how I
[1:54:47] live
[1:54:48] bless that brother's heart I don't know
[1:54:49] him I will but I don't know him right
[1:54:51] now
[1:54:52] can't wait to see him
[1:54:55] that's a testament right there
[1:54:58] so
[1:54:59] um
[1:55:01] I'm going to
[1:55:03] kind of pivot a little bit you got to
[1:55:05] realize there's there's uh whichever way
[1:55:07] you cast your vote there's going to be
[1:55:08] terms and conditions all right how many
[1:55:10] people read their terms and conditions
[1:55:14] when you buy your phone
[1:55:16] or when you get your email address
[1:55:19] please one person just tell me you read
[1:55:22] all of it
[1:55:23] nobody I've never read one I read the
[1:55:27] title terms and conditions check
[1:55:31] that's it I didn't read that
[1:55:38] right there
[1:55:40] in church
[1:55:44] I didn't read it
[1:55:47] they could be buying my organs off of
[1:55:49] that terms and conditions I never read
[1:55:51] it I don't know
[1:55:54] I see
[1:55:56] the devil he don't he does terms and
[1:55:58] conditions the way the world does that's
[1:55:59] where they get it from that's the way
[1:56:01] these companies do it they they make
[1:56:03] that print super tiny
[1:56:06] zoom out you gotta zoom in I don't know
[1:56:09] 20 paragraphs long 10 pages
[1:56:12] I'm not gonna read that he makes it to
[1:56:14] where you don't want to read that and
[1:56:17] then he's like all right look at this
[1:56:19] great thing I'm giving you terms and
[1:56:21] conditions okay great thing
[1:56:23] and that's the way they lay it out
[1:56:25] because they know they can get you
[1:56:26] because you checked it
[1:56:28] yeah
[1:56:29] thank you
[1:56:31] the devil's going to do that but God
[1:56:33] does not do it that way
[1:56:35] praise God he says whenever he uh is
[1:56:39] giving you something
[1:56:41] he tells you with bold front
[1:56:43] what he's gonna do what things are good
[1:56:46] and what things are bad let me give you
[1:56:48] an example of terms and conditions from
[1:56:49] uh the book of Samuel first Samuel it
[1:56:52] says um I don't know if I want to read
[1:56:54] all this
[1:56:55] it's a Latin where I'm supposed to be
[1:56:57] wrapping up but um
[1:56:59] uh
[1:57:02] all right I'll read the whole thing then
[1:57:06] okay first Samuel chapter 8 10 to 20 11
[1:57:09] verses let's go
[1:57:10] and this is Samuel talking to the
[1:57:12] Israelites and they want a king they
[1:57:14] want that
[1:57:17] and Samuel told all the words of the
[1:57:18] Lord unto the people and asked of them
[1:57:20] that asked of him a king and he said
[1:57:22] this will be the manner of the king that
[1:57:24] shall reign over you he will take your
[1:57:25] sons and appoint them for himself for
[1:57:27] his chariots and be his Horsemen and
[1:57:29] some shall run before his chariots and
[1:57:31] he will appoint him captains over
[1:57:32] thousands captains over 50s and set them
[1:57:34] to ear his ground and to reap his
[1:57:36] Harvest and to make his instruments of
[1:57:38] Warren instruments for this chariots and
[1:57:40] he will take your daughters to be
[1:57:41] confectionaries and be cooks and to be
[1:57:42] Bakers and he will take your fields and
[1:57:44] your Vineyards and your hall of yards
[1:57:45] and the best of them and give them to
[1:57:46] his servants
[1:57:47] I know some of y'all eyes just glazed
[1:57:49] over
[1:57:50] terms and conditions right there right
[1:57:51] riveting stuff
[1:57:54] and that's what the Israelites thought
[1:57:56] they were just like all this stuff I
[1:57:58] said I just want a king I want someone I
[1:58:00] can see in front of me
[1:58:02] and that desire is it's good in a way
[1:58:05] because ultimately it's God's word you
[1:58:07] know he comes before them in the flesh
[1:58:09] and it was the greatest thing greatest
[1:58:11] person that ever set foot on Earth Jesus
[1:58:15] Christ they get to see that but it
[1:58:17] wasn't their time and this wasn't God's
[1:58:19] way that's not what he wanted
[1:58:21] and he will take a tenth of your seeding
[1:58:22] of your venions and give to his officers
[1:58:25] and to his servants and he will take
[1:58:26] your men servants and your maidservants
[1:58:28] and your good least young men and your
[1:58:29] asses and put them to his work
[1:58:31] he will take the tenth of your sheep and
[1:58:33] ye shall be his servants now he's
[1:58:35] telling them what's going to happen
[1:58:37] after
[1:58:38] they check this box
[1:58:41] and ye shall cry out in that day because
[1:58:43] of your king which he shall have chosen
[1:58:45] you and the Lord will not hear you in
[1:58:47] that day nevertheless the people refuse
[1:58:49] to obey the voice of Samuel and they
[1:58:51] said nay check but we will have a king
[1:58:54] over us
[1:58:56] that we also may be like all the nations
[1:58:58] to be like others and that our King May
[1:59:01] judge us and go out before us and fight
[1:59:03] our battles
[1:59:05] any all done that for but God
[1:59:08] pray for something
[1:59:10] I I read your word and I prayed over it
[1:59:12] like 30 seconds
[1:59:14] I'm gonna do it and that's it you didn't
[1:59:17] listen he probably told you directly
[1:59:19] what is going to happen he told you in
[1:59:22] his word you might have spoken to you
[1:59:23] somehow
[1:59:25] giving you a sign that you shouldn't do
[1:59:27] it but you go and do it anyway I go and
[1:59:29] do that all the time sometimes I don't
[1:59:31] even ask because I know what he's gonna
[1:59:32] say and then I go and do it
[1:59:39] actually do I have a slide with a
[1:59:41] picture on it
[1:59:42] I do yes please
[1:59:45] I'll let you watch that while I read
[1:59:46] water
[1:59:50] [Music]
[2:00:00] I've been here before
[2:00:03] ask him what he wants you to do do
[2:00:06] whatever you want to do and then he has
[2:00:08] every right to question why you did what
[2:00:10] you did
[2:00:11] and then you ask him to bring you out of
[2:00:13] it
[2:00:14] that's me
[2:00:16] I'm not perfect
[2:00:20] but God when he gives you terms and
[2:00:23] conditions
[2:00:26] it's like I told you it's in bold font
[2:00:29] he challenges you
[2:00:31] in those terms and conditions Malachi 3
[2:00:34] 10.
[2:00:35] bring ye all the tithes into the
[2:00:37] storehouse that there may be meat in
[2:00:40] thine house and prove me now herewith
[2:00:42] this is a promise that's his terms and
[2:00:44] conditions it's a promise
[2:00:45] if you check this box you get all these
[2:00:48] things saith the Lord of hosts if I will
[2:00:50] not and prove me not here with saith the
[2:00:52] Lord of host if I will not open you the
[2:00:55] windows of Heaven pour you out of
[2:00:56] blessing and there shall not be room
[2:00:58] enough to receive it I believe this
[2:01:00] church right here is evidence of that
[2:01:03] yeah
[2:01:04] pours you out of blessing
[2:01:07] and we got plenty of room coming
[2:01:11] and he's gonna fill that up too
[2:01:18] Luke 6 38 give and it shall be given to
[2:01:21] you another one good measure pressed
[2:01:23] down and shaken together and running
[2:01:24] over shall men give into your bosom for
[2:01:28] with the same measure that you meet with
[2:01:29] all it shall be measured to you again
[2:01:31] he's not saying you give me a you give
[2:01:34] me one the same measure I'm going to
[2:01:36] give you back the same measure you know
[2:01:38] he's saying a hundred times
[2:01:40] a thousand times a million times give me
[2:01:43] a dollar I'll give you a million
[2:01:45] I'm not preaching prosperity it's
[2:01:48] probably not literally going to be a
[2:01:49] million
[2:01:50] but your life will be fulfilled because
[2:01:52] you gave that to God and it might not
[2:01:55] come here on Earth it might come in
[2:01:56] heaven
[2:01:57] but he's gonna give it to you he doesn't
[2:01:59] have debtors
[2:02:00] God doesn't have debtors he got plenty
[2:02:03] to pay you back
[2:02:05] Mark 10 29-30 and Jesus answered and
[2:02:08] said verily I say unto you there is no
[2:02:10] man that hath left house or Brethren or
[2:02:12] sisters or father or wait left house
[2:02:17] or Brethren or sisters or father or
[2:02:19] mother or wife or children or lands for
[2:02:21] my sake in the gospels but he shall
[2:02:23] receive 100 fold now in this time houses
[2:02:27] God's house
[2:02:28] you left how many houses y'all left I
[2:02:31] don't know
[2:02:32] you let first house your house right
[2:02:34] yeah was the second house that
[2:02:37] storefront
[2:02:41] okay and then that's the third one and
[2:02:44] then this is the fourth one
[2:02:46] this is a fourth yeah how many y'all
[2:02:48] left
[2:02:50] you've left four houses I'm I'm claiming
[2:02:53] it now we've left this house
[2:02:55] you can't forsake one and he won't give
[2:02:58] you another one there's no such thing as
[2:03:00] that it says it right here you left that
[2:03:03] house he's going to give you another one
[2:03:10] you're living
[2:03:11] in your father forsakes you
[2:03:15] your mother forsakes you your brother
[2:03:17] your sister doesn't matter who forsakes
[2:03:19] you God got another one for you
[2:03:23] most of mine I've had trouble with
[2:03:26] family
[2:03:27] I I honestly
[2:03:29] have spiritual fathers in the message
[2:03:31] that are better than my Earthly father
[2:03:33] in terms of leading me and guiding me I
[2:03:36] can go to them for the Jack's one of
[2:03:37] them I can ask them for advice I'm like
[2:03:40] oh Finance Finance Finance brother Jack
[2:03:44] what do I do brother Quentin somebody
[2:03:47] here like somebody is I can ask them for
[2:03:50] advice God gave me them
[2:03:54] I came here when I was 19 to the states
[2:03:56] I didn't have any Father Figure here now
[2:04:00] I've got multiple ones in my phone I got
[2:04:03] no problem with calling texting them
[2:04:05] mothers I got plenty of mothers I didn't
[2:04:07] realize it till I got married and then I
[2:04:09] knew
[2:04:11] I was getting married that wedding day I
[2:04:13] had a lot of mothers laughs
[2:04:18] a lot of mothers
[2:04:21] some of them younger than you mothers
[2:04:27] I got three older sisters those are also
[2:04:29] my mothers I got an older brother that's
[2:04:31] also my father yeah
[2:04:34] I love him to death
[2:04:36] God make sure you have who you need and
[2:04:38] what you need where you need however you
[2:04:41] need it
[2:04:42] no matter what you leave behind he's got
[2:04:44] something better for you my life's a
[2:04:46] testimony of that
[2:04:48] [Applause]
[2:04:52] and and I I allude to this a lot and
[2:04:54] it's it's um
[2:04:57] it's it's in um so that scripture where
[2:05:00] he's saying nobody's forsaken any of
[2:05:02] these things and not been given them
[2:05:04] back
[2:05:06] um
[2:05:07] I have this this quote from Laura Grace
[2:05:09] and I keep talking about this I don't
[2:05:11] know why I just keep feeling to say it a
[2:05:14] lot
[2:05:15] um
[2:05:16] this is one of those parents who have
[2:05:18] kids and you know you don't
[2:05:20] they're they're not following the Lord
[2:05:21] you don't know why you might have
[2:05:22] siblings it might be brothers sisters
[2:05:24] might be parents who aren't father and
[2:05:25] Lord you don't understand why brother
[2:05:27] Brandon says it's in the law of Grace
[2:05:28] say I want to ask you something here do
[2:05:30] you remember how he
[2:05:32] give his children back he's talking
[2:05:34] about Joe
[2:05:35] now remember he give him a double bunch
[2:05:38] so many thousand Ox he had first when
[2:05:40] they was all taken away he doubled the
[2:05:41] boxes when the Sheep he doubled them
[2:05:44] sheep but remember he had I believe it
[2:05:46] was seven or twelve at seven I forget
[2:05:48] just how just which it was sons and
[2:05:51] daughters but he had the same amount of
[2:05:53] sons and daughters God gave him gave
[2:05:55] them to him is that right see he doubled
[2:05:57] all his portions of goods here on Earth
[2:06:00] but his sons and daughters all of them
[2:06:03] got killed but he gave him the same
[2:06:04] amount of sons and daughters did you
[2:06:06] ever notice you take thought of that you
[2:06:08] remembered when we taught it
[2:06:10] there where was those sons and daughters
[2:06:11] in glory waiting for him
[2:06:14] see he give them every one to him see
[2:06:16] there wasn't one of them lost see the
[2:06:18] same amount of sons and daughters that
[2:06:19] he specified first he specified the same
[2:06:22] amount at last but he doubled his
[2:06:23] portion of sheep and ox and so forth
[2:06:25] like that but his sons and daughters
[2:06:27] were all saved waiting in glory for job
[2:06:30] to come to them
[2:06:32] that's worth it all isn't it
[2:06:35] and and just because just because
[2:06:37] there's somebody related by blood
[2:06:39] who's who's
[2:06:41] um who you've been praying for who's not
[2:06:43] coming in it doesn't mean there's not
[2:06:46] someone in the church who's supposed to
[2:06:47] take that person's place
[2:06:49] are you looking out for your your your
[2:06:52] little siblings your little
[2:06:55] children in Christ are you looking out
[2:06:56] for them am I I don't know
[2:06:58] I I pray for who I remember I'm really
[2:07:01] bad with names but I try I try to look
[2:07:04] out for those younger than me those who
[2:07:05] are still just starting out if you don't
[2:07:07] then you're kind of neglecting something
[2:07:10] that's like
[2:07:11] that someone in church who you should
[2:07:14] have who's who you've adopted just by
[2:07:16] being there
[2:07:17] now parental negligence puts you in
[2:07:20] prison what does this do
[2:07:23] I'm not saying it's going to put you in
[2:07:25] prison I'm just saying you're it's just
[2:07:27] as bad as if you didn't give them a home
[2:07:28] didn't clothe them and they're your
[2:07:30] blood and your flesh and blood you
[2:07:32] should look out for those people
[2:07:34] those people who walk into churches
[2:07:36] sometimes I see young people coming to
[2:07:37] our church and they don't have anybody
[2:07:39] they just came by themselves brother
[2:07:41] sister uh young like under 25 and
[2:07:45] bringing themselves to church alone
[2:07:49] their family might have kicked him out
[2:07:50] of another church
[2:07:51] it's
[2:07:53] or they their family doesn't know
[2:07:55] anything they don't have family they
[2:07:56] don't know like am I looking out for him
[2:07:58] did God put him or her in the position
[2:08:01] for me to watch over
[2:08:04] God help me
[2:08:06] I don't want to miss that
[2:08:12] I'm almost done I don't know how time
[2:08:14] works here
[2:08:16] um
[2:08:20] so I'm still in terms and conditions one
[2:08:22] last thing God
[2:08:24] is he the devil the devil he
[2:08:28] he is just like the tech if you want to
[2:08:30] know what the devil's like look at tech
[2:08:32] support if you've ever had to call them
[2:08:34] right you call tech support how long
[2:08:38] before you actually talk to somebody
[2:08:40] you can't find them you can't you
[2:08:42] wouldn't first off you're not gonna me
[2:08:44] if I call tech support for my phone
[2:08:45] right here it's a Google pixel if I call
[2:08:48] tech support for this phone I'm not
[2:08:50] going to meet the engineer who designed
[2:08:52] this phone
[2:08:52] I'm not gonna meet the person who coded
[2:08:55] the software in this phone I'm not gonna
[2:08:57] reach them they don't have to be there
[2:08:59] they're not going to answer me that's
[2:09:00] exactly how the devil is when everything
[2:09:02] goes wrong after you followed his advice
[2:09:04] where is he
[2:09:06] nowhere couldn't find him if I tried
[2:09:11] can't even find the number it's not on
[2:09:13] the website
[2:09:15] type of an email he's not going to read
[2:09:16] that
[2:09:18] that's tech support here
[2:09:21] but God if you if you you need to have a
[2:09:26] relationship with God just to get what
[2:09:28] he are asking for from him so if he's
[2:09:31] given you something that's a
[2:09:33] relationship starting right there
[2:09:35] you go to Jeremiah it says in verse 12
[2:09:38] it says uh verse 12 of uh chapter 29
[2:09:41] then ye shall call upon me and ye shall
[2:09:43] go and pray unto me and I will hearken
[2:09:45] unto you
[2:09:47] and ye shall seek me and find me and
[2:09:49] when ye shall search for me with all
[2:09:50] your heart
[2:09:54] in Isaiah 65 24 and it says and it shall
[2:09:57] come to pass that before they call I
[2:09:59] will answer
[2:10:01] wouldn't that be crazy if you picked up
[2:10:02] your phone to call tech support and they
[2:10:04] were calling you
[2:10:06] it's like I knew you had a problem I
[2:10:08] designed it this way live it
[2:10:12] that's what you got to do
[2:10:15] that's God right there that's that's my
[2:10:17] tech support
[2:10:18] I think I think I'm done for now I'm
[2:10:20] cutting this short for now because uh I
[2:10:22] want to be mindful of the time musicians
[2:10:24] can come back thank you um
[2:10:26] but I'd like for us to pray one more
[2:10:29] time before before I close

[2:18:45] hearts
[2:18:46] amen he made a statement towards the end
[2:18:50] about
[2:18:51] um if in the natural we parental
[2:18:56] negligence
[2:18:57] and wasn't taking care of our kids
[2:19:00] they would come and do things to us Mike
[2:19:04] calls us to go to prison because we're
[2:19:06] neglecting
[2:19:08] children
[2:19:09] and you know I was just thinking
[2:19:12] spiritually
[2:19:14] sometimes God will allow you to go
[2:19:17] through certain situations in your life
[2:19:21] and oftentimes what happens as Believers
[2:19:25] we neglect to be able to reach out to
[2:19:28] other people that's going through the
[2:19:30] same thing that God has already brought
[2:19:32] us through
[2:19:33] and when we do that it actually creates
[2:19:37] more bondage for the person and
[2:19:39] something and I know that my wife have
[2:19:41] talked about this there's some times
[2:19:43] that you really wish that you could just
[2:19:45] be open and honest with people and just
[2:19:48] let them know all you know you need to
[2:19:51] let them know uh but sometimes folk just
[2:19:53] don't know how to handle information
[2:19:55] hello somebody
[2:19:57] and man sometimes when people open up
[2:20:00] and just giving you on their heart you
[2:20:01] got to know that you can't take that and
[2:20:03] just be sharing it everywhere
[2:20:04] [Music]
[2:20:09] in order to help you come on somebody
[2:20:12] right so I'll tell you we have a we have
[2:20:15] a job to do we want to watch out for one
[2:20:18] another
