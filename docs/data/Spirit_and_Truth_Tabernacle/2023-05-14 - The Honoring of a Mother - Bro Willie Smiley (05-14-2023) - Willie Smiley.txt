up the fruit of her hands and let her own works praise her and the gates and uh let's read a little passage out of the book of Ephesians Ephesians chapter 6. uh we want to read the first couple of verses as children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right we'll start that over again children obey your parents in the Lord for this is a right honored Our Father and mother which is the first commandment with promise that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the Earth amen let's just bow heads for a word of Prayer gracious father we just come this morning to give thanks and praise for this opportunity to be able to come in to be able to Fellowship around the caucus of the word of God and we just you know we just thank you Lord God you know for memory this morning being able to think back to some years and good Fellowship around the word of God and good songwriting and things that inspired us that's still you know inspires us today we just appreciate this portion of the Bride of Jesus Christ and help us to get out of the way help us to uh just be encouraging we just want to pray oh God for the mothers this morning we appreciate them and all the efforts that's been put forth to try to raise their children in the things of God we just appreciate your God this morning we ask that you blessed and anointing and suppression Jesus name amen amen you may be seated uh this morning I'd like to um use as a topic uh the honoring of a mother and um I just kind of been I don't know contemplating I gotta guess a few statements and a a few comments we'll pass and let you out of here but we we want to just try to be encouraging uh we we know just every year this just this time has been a a day that's been set aside for mother since the early 20th century this lady uh Ann I think Jarvis is how you pronounce her name she she kind of fought the government to implement this this day uh because she had I guess uh uh really good mother and thought it would be necessary to kind of bring forth sometimes we know it's historical and very traditional and and commercialized nowadays and I don't have no problem with that though you know the commercialization of it now I don't have no problem because sometimes we we don't hardly call our mothers we don't we don't hardly see them you know we don't hardly do anything for them sometimes folk won't even cut a chance to his mother's day I was I was messing with my my cousin uh on the job the other day me and a preacher friend of mine we was like man you won't take your wife to Service uh on Sunday and I just got declining with him I said might as well because then the preacher could just say Merry Christmas you know happy Easter because that might be the next time you show up and uh he got he caught a little warm with me but I'm his oldest cousin so you know he like come on cool leave me alone but uh you know sometimes that's that's kind of how it is I remember growing up and and a lot of times my my dad and my uncle's they they at that time they weren't Church going guys but when it Mother's Day came around uh they would they would go to church with my grandmother and I I thought that you know that was that was fine they probably needed to do it more often I I thank God this morning that um you know uh with with my children and growing up I had the opportunity that I was converted and I had the opportunity to just be there on a consistent basis right but you know you you have to really appreciate mothers the word mother is one who has begotten right one who has begotten and you know as as I was studying I was thinking how you know really really brought this this this uh sermon could be because there's so many different variables and so many things that that I think you know uh has has to uh be approached and has to be talked about that's just beyond tradition and and things of that nature to try to uh uh just maybe better Society uh as I was studying the prophet he he he in so many years he would take the opportunity to talk about uh mothering and and motherhood to try to really show just really the importance right yeah really show the importance of of of being a mother and what all mothering entails is that right I didn't come to really lecture I'm a preach in a minute I guess but uh it it's a lot that goes along with with mothering and and motherhood one of the outstanding statements he made he said you know uh uh uh and just trying to show the the importance he says um that motherhood is the backbone of a Nation right amen uh it's it's goes beyond just having children we there's a great responsibility that's been given is that right a tremendous tremendous responsibility that's been given and it's something that I don't think you know you want to approach it lightly and it's probably things that's never been been said never been taught things that we probably never really consciously understood is that right growing up you know a lot of times young ladies They Don't Really comprehend uh uh uh the sacred trust that's been given to them right of Womanhood and you know motherhood and things of that nature and and and and having babies and child rearing uh people approach these things haphazardly especially especially in this today's society you you look around and you see a lot of uh uh you know and hey I'm not trying to be critical but it's things that's got to be said unwed unwed mothers and you know a stream a woman with a stream of children with no no headship and things of that nature and and you can tell the approach to the whole thing has been uh in ignorance am I calling you ignorant but the approach to it has been in ignorance and a lack of of real clear understanding huh but but you know there's a responsibility that's been given because see uh when Womanhood is broken motherhood is broken that's when it comes to morals right and we could we could see this morning a real decay in morals if folks think this this stuff is cute well somebody gonna preach with me this morning folk think that this stuff is this stuff is cute but they're failing to see the responsibility that's that's been given and I'm not just talking about young young I'm talking about on every level right you could see the ignorance and where folk fail to understand the responsibility that's been been given to them right to affect a nation of people well I'm starting to feel like preaching this morning amen see when the morals are broken right then it's an indication of where the nation is come on somebody believe me this morning when the morals are broken it shows it show on the walk around with blinders on and not this nation is broken to pieces right because the morals look at just look at the morals right but it it just shows you it just shows you just the lack of understanding this morning brother spotty Gonna Leave You with some understanding is that right glory to God glory to God because you know growing up you know we didn't we didn't hear this this level of of of teaching come on Church you know this morning we probably get a whole lot of things that that's real uh surface but but I I think I think you know as as we we constantly move towards a man uh a change of our bodies in in the generation degeneration of of of of of young ladies coming up and and and mothers coming up I think it's important for them to be actually taught something help help them to understand the responsibility that they've been given right let's imagine something if if if we could if we could you know inject into every mother in America spiritual values right real true spiritual values and and really give give uh a real clear understanding of more morals it would change the fabric of America come on it would change the fabric of America when once we once LED in so many categories as not so much of as a Christian Nation because we've never really been that but you know we would found it kind of on Christianity and principles and and morals and at least you know I know oh oh man but I'm old enough to look back and and see where you know that was a little bit of something something but but you know nowadays you know everywhere you look is is somebody with um have stripped down and back sides out and it it's like bosoms out and it it just shows you uh where we've gone at as as a nation as as a society right oh well we can get deep into this this morning right this Mother's Day I'm gonna spare you just a little bit right right but but you know mother motherhood motherhood is is a is a great responsibility it's it's it's the office is different from being a wife glory to God it's it's definitely different because the way that you interact with your husband you interact with your children differently and you gotta understand the balance in all of that come on come on come on because you're choosing ain't your husband and your husband ain't your children somebody gonna preach with me up in here this morning right and and you never put your children on the same level because it's different it's it's different it's definitely different come on somebody say preach brother somebody come on y'all ain't heard me in a while so I might we're gonna preach y'all gonna have to bear with me two Sundays in a row because brother Jack gone y'all get brother Jack when he come back huh but but it's truth being being a mother uh uh is a great responsibility that that that's been been uh afforded to by the grace of God and and it's something that you can't take lightly and and I want to say this for the young people I'm kind of move back and forward you have to appreciate uh a good mother you know the Bible says for us to honor right to honor and that's to demonstrate high respect or praise the Lord demonstrate high respect or great esteem for someone by honoring another you are saying you see Great Value in them that's real powerful [Music] y'all get that young people right to demonstrate High because we don't got away from that yeah right in in this Society where where morals is broken down and right has become wrong and wrong it's become right like I say you know at as soon to be 61 things have changed it used to be when I was a Youngster you ain't you ain't sitting in the living room and and and and being Grown Folk and you ain't talk back and you ain't if you have something to say you said it lower in your in your room somewhere and if your parents heard you you like what you say nothing y'all a lot of priests with me yeah I love the priests with me my mother my mother uh my mother if you know my mother she tries to be poised and sophisticated and and uh show show character and she I'll tell you what my mom really actually she raised I was thinking on my drive to church this morning I say man I was raised right we lived in a nice four bedroom two bedroom house we we always had a nice car one of the nice houses one of the nice yards on the neighborhood I mean we dressed nice we we went places she took us places and things of that nature we just made crazy choices right it wasn't it wasn't that that she misunderstood her responsibility because she understood her responsibility it's just that it's just that being being young and immature we didn't understand right as being 12 13 14 15 16 17. we just select understanding and I'm quite sure in here this morning we got young folk that just look just lack understanding of what real motherhood and parenting is really all about yeah now I got six children I know what I'm talking about imma lead them out of this but uh you know I I kind of have a an idea and and you realize you know and I can speak by experience that I didn't I didn't understand uh my mother's role come on I thought my mom was mean I thought my mom didn't love me but I but as I got older and I got mature I realized she was being a mother she she was being responsible right it had nothing to do with with you know uh the thoughts of society right it it it it everything had to do with my well-being and her being responsible amen uh uh in her role as a mother because she was a wife and she was a mother and she had to navigate between those two roles and sometimes you know that gets difficult somebody ought to talk to me this ain't foreign this ain't even deep right right and and I'll say this for you young sisters That's not married you got to do a lot of navigating come on somebody some old sister start to work with me this morning come on come on because maybe the younger generation don't know what I'm preaching this morning right you you got to do a lot of side stepping and navigating but to right come on because it's it's so much going on and there's a devil in the midst of all of us to try to break up the Oneness right to spoil a picture Oh Glory to God and so you know as a mother you got to be prayerful right amen uh uh you gotta be something that struck me one day just thinking about the subject you know God impressed it in my heart you got to be discerning right you got to be Discerning as a mother glory to God young Sisters You Gotta you know the rose is different you kind of got to be on skates but but you you you gotta you know sometimes stand in the middle and battle on both sides y'all want to preach with me that's a mother that's a mother glory to God be be discerning right be be Discerning because you you gotta you gotta head and then you got children right and and you you got to be Discerning of him and and you got to be Discerning of them and you got to be Discerning of that devil come on come on that's that's real real real mother listen listen if if you're you're going to go back to uh and I'm not you know I want to be here all day but if you really go back to uh proverbs 31 this King uh I guess you pronounced his name Lyman something like that y'all go back to the first verse right uh um what he was writing was from the wisdom that was given to him by his mama right not his daddy right his mother is the one who related to him certain things as being a king his mother somebody who understood you know uh her role her responsibility I think it was brother Solomon was saying the dog got behind him and the first person mama that's just how it is I think sometimes as far as we get I won't say that uh how can I put this in a way you know I think I think sometimes our role our role people don't fully grasp right if I could say it like that especially our children sometimes I don't think our children really understand uh the role of a father sometimes I don't think they understand the road either but that's neither here nor there but uh it's definitely a difference and and I'll get to some quotes if I do if I don't I don't but I do have a few uh uh the just just because of motherhood and and like brother Brandon was making reference to you know they bear you under here there's there's that there's that closeness automatically from the jump right that that a mother have you know I remember back when when my children were were in the womb my wife used to talk to him come on my wife used to read to him you know I was automatically at a disadvantage when they got here you know who I mean let's face it how how do you how do you compete with Dad she already got his ill I mean that because she was expressing she was a she was expressing you know uh uh a love and a compassion in the womb man right sometimes we we see genius kids and those things come because mothers take the the opportunity and mothers let me tell you something I think we got a pregnant sister up in hitting my own anybody else at least one you know talk to your baby speak to it speak into its life you know educated come on I think scientifically and I don't know how to research but I'm quite sure you could find some statistics to prove how important these things are a man to uh the growth of the child from conception right you know people often say you know my children are smart and and it's it's it comes because there was a person who not fully but had enough understanding to realize you know what I'ma start the process in the womb to to get up to get a jump on it when when they come out right that that the feeling that you know these children I have towards us is that right yeah it's it's it's important it's Abraham Lincoln we got a quote you know he he says you know any contributions that I'm giving don't give it to me I am what I am because I had a good mother right amen you know uh I made a lot of mistakes coming up y'all know my testimony right but but it's because I I had good grandparents come on grandparents I had a good Mama and I had a good grandparents right that that I grew up around grandmothers lose it I that that's a touching well when you I started talking about my grandma was right not my grandmother's my grandmamas yeah yeah some of y'all might call them Mama dear but man let me tell you something these these people held me up when I could hold myself up when I was a young man just trying to trying to navigate through through life and and try to get some sort of understanding of who I was I you know and when I was at my worst and and when uncles and aunts and different ones you know would come around and rebuke me you know uh for being at Grandma house and and she taking the time to feed me and and and nurture me back to health and everything they will get upset but that was just it hurt that didn't go nowhere because her kids grew up right I like something the prophet of God said he talks about nature and he says he talks about the mother bear you know uh when when she wakes up in those Cubs you know they kind of pretty big and everything and she just get to a point after a while she shoot him away right but then you know they go into hibernation but if she wake up and realize that she didn't have no Cubs mother is still Lima so she'll go hunt them she'll go hunt them you know last year's comes down to to nurture them to love on them to nurture them that's an instinct that's something that's placed in in in a real good woman that's right amen is that right I mean you get some some mothers that get demon possessed and you know cause them to do all that them Spirits when you see women taking babies lives and all of that that's not them them Spirits because there's an instinct that's placed in them there's things displaced in the mother that's not placed in the father right there's there's compassions and there's different things that's placed in a mother that's just not placed in a man come on we we barely uh I was I was eating with some of my family members and everything and I just had to laugh because you know I remember my dad and and us growing up and and and and you know my mother was one way and my dad was another way especially old school dads you know they ain't want you washing dishes they didn't want you to do this and they didn't want you to do that and all of their mind could say I don't want him to be gay right come on preach with me somebody well if it what makes a person that is a spirit that gets on them Society Society screwed up now uh uh uh and it is what it and and we really can't change it because it's it's under scripture come on if you know your Bible as it was in the days right so it's it's it's a spirit that's dominating right but but you know here's the positive thing you know when when mothers understand their role in their position and what's been given to them by God right and and their approach to to Motherhood and everything it helps to offset a lot of things is that right be because they're the first line it's it's their job watch watch scripture right it it was it was not Moses's Daddy right that taught him his purpose it was Moses's mother come on preach with me somebody y'all might not jump over the building but y'all gonna be all right it was it was Moses's mother taught him the precepts in the his his real purpose right so so you gotta understand this young sisters you got a job to do yeah right uh I think it it was Paul talking to Timothy you know uh uh and he went way back because she he had he had a real spiritual Grandmama right amen Paul looked all the way back to his grandmother right and prophetically spoke to him about a gift that was in his life come on I thank God that you know my grandmothers were were spiritual women right one was Pentecostal and one was Baptist but they were spiritual prayer warriors prayer warriors read the Bible didn't neither one of them had a 12th grade education I doubt if they had an eighth grade education but they they had enough education that they could pick up the the little black book and read it come on somebody amen all right a responsibility some of y'all young sisters going to get married these things are key right one of the things I'm realizing more and more and more as as I'm mature right uh as a servant of God it's important that you educate yourself in in in areas of family sometimes I look back and I get frustrated I can't because you know you can't get blood from Eternal what what ain't in the preacher just ain't in a preacher and and until certain things is quickened to a man he can't present these things right amen that's a tremendous job amen that's been been given to us right and and a part of what's been given to us is to help us to mature help us help help us to see you know certain signs and what it takes to navigate right through this light and get the best out of life come on somebody get get the best out of life so it's it's important for you young sisters coming up right to to really take the time and educate yourself Amen on on Womanhood and motherhood right not just out here being fast and all of that that's that's nonsense all you're going to do is scar up your life with that right glory to God and trying to be cute and all of this and and and and somebody pray with me come finna go left I see it now yeah right but somebody need to just tell you because that that like who is that that ain't life who that was Troy that was Troy was saying that that ain't that's not life hugging up and slapping up and this and that and the other and getting your heart broken and that ain't life that ain't cute either way male or female I know we put we put a lot on on the young sisters but the same thing in the mail there ain't no notches in your belt and all that that's a lot of nonsense man you you scarred up people people lives and everything up and you gotta live with that you gotta live with that as a man you gotta live with these these things so you gotta take preventative measures to make sure because there's a sacred trust that's been given and and and you know you you want to grow up and be able to impart right in part some of y'all young sisters you know y'all got daughters and you might have some daughters and you know you you don't you don't want to scar up your life because you don't realize those daughters will be affected y'all cause you know I don't know you know I'm 61 and some a lot of y'all young enough to be my children but praise the Lord so I might go and just tell you what's on my heart because I'm I feel like I'm old enough right because when you do these things you don't realize the effects that's eat both ways the effects that that these things have on you whether you you're speaking these things or not you don't realize even by having a baptism of the Holy Ghost your past will have an effect Oh Glory Oh Glory your past of getting the way of of your presence is that right even though even though you may not want it but it will I'm a living witness to that glory to God sometimes sometimes sometimes I know I know sometimes my kids think I'm the strangest guy but but I'm really not it's just things that I choose not to never share with them uh but I had a pass come on I I had a pass and I I got a lot of scars and I got a lot of hurt and and and then also and and trying to raise right let's look from different different levels you you trying to grow up you know and you're trying to raise children but but you got scars you got hurt you you've been damaged right and and and you're trying you're trying to keep your children from the damage and the hurt and and you lacking understanding so you don't really fully know how to navigate y'all ain't gonna get this till you get older because this right this morning seemed to be see to be Greek and don't seem like it's a Mother's Day Mother's Day Sherman come on right but like I say it's it's levels to it it's it's things that you know you sometimes you need to we and I don't have time because I'm not the pastor to break to break things down right so so that so that this generation can be better than the previous generations in 23 years of pastoring that's all I fought to do is make every generation better I've probably been considered a fanatic and a crank but but I always knew what I was standing on right because biblical principles are different than natural carnal uh principles you want people right and and church I I just have to say it like this I'm a Christian and and you know I try to you know be a Christian and and operate Christian views and Christian values we make mistakes but uh you won't you want every generation to be better right every parent should you know you won't be and that's all that's brother Jack watch watch brother Jack's heart now I know on Sunday on Sunday mornings he preached faith and he tried to get you get you worked up and get you feeling good about yourself so you can go into Monday well I don't have that enough services to do that for y'all I just caught I kind of hit here and there you know so I have to I have to just kind of give it to you what I give it to you you know what I mean if I had every week then I could make you feel good a little bit some of these Sundays right but but you know when you give me a day like this and and with our level of growth and and you know one of the things I'm finding out is that it's people watching us brother Jack alluded to that a week ago it's people watching us from everywhere and and and we don't know what folks stand in need of we don't we don't know what folks are feeding on sometimes sometimes you know I think we take for granted what what we're getting fed right and so we don't show the kind of honor and respect to it right we we look at we look at the individual and not not comprehending what's being said right glory to God glory to God but but that real real honor real honor real respect is is what's needed in this generation to take us to the next level right amen glory to God see if if you can't respect and honor right your parents how could you ever operate in the purpose of God priest with me see if you don't respect your daddy and you don't respect your mother you ain't never gonna respect the pastor hello because these things got to start in the home right glory to God and so so that's why it's important to teach a man children respect it right honor that's the Bible say honor if you want to live long you honor right right amen is you know kids get older and and and you know they just start losing respect you was Mom and Dad then you become man what's up man bro it's like really I had I had to check one of my boys one day I try not to be on them hard but just sometimes things just because you know it'll go from that to something else right what's and I don't get on it it just become a habit now and to me to me it's it's sometimes and I try not to read into things but it's like I never would have even if my dad was still alive what's up man huh never never I could kind of handle pop a little bit what's up pop pops I could kind of handle that but what's up man what's up bro hey hold up fella I fed you I closed you I hurt because I was trying to and I'm broke I'm uh I'm bro I'm what's up man Lord have mercy that's disrespectful we never would have done that we never would have done I never would have done that if my dad was still living today bro what's up bro my dad probably would have swung on me I you know what I had a I have reference right young people that's that should be a reverence and our respect to your parents mother and father how much time I got praise God y'all gonna have to blame him now he always be pulling right but but you you you you you know I was talking to my mom yesterday and I was saying you know there's a lot of things I didn't understand you know when I was young I didn't and really I didn't I didn't I really didn't understand what she had to go through and and the Hoops she had to jump through to make sure that five children my mom had five children right and and and and I hate to say it like this but you know my dad was not there she told me things yesterday that I didn't even know from when when we were really young and and and and I was like what all right you know I still love my dad that's not what I'm saying but but I appreciate my mom at soon to be 83 years old this summer what she had to go through all for us right all for us knowing we had to be fed we had to be educated you know man she worked two jobs and still tried to get us to practices huh she didn't Pawn us off on people huh a whole lot of people now I was always real funny about that right when my kids was coming up I ain't buying my kids off on folk I was a little I was a little hesitant on letting them stay anywhere sister Burroughs maybe sister Lewis that was it I ain't hardly that I didn't hardly let my children go down south from State my grand my mother is loving but but I know from me growing up she was a little bit she get a little bit too much rope you know and and and I'm discerning right I'm Discerning I watch everything and I watch everybody I listen to Everything I comprehend everything right come on come on so so I knew where I wanted my children to be at and where I did not want my children to be at as as their guard whether they could comprehend those things or couldn't comprehend those things I could comprehend those things and I said no you can't go there let's just the last place on Earth it ain't nobody else could hold y'all it was times you know we were going out out of town out of the country and stuff like that and I had to let it and and I come back and I get vexed because things happened and it's like you want to just rip somebody head off right it's like listen when my children

they ain't your friend they not to equal yeah they're not to equal you know I mean my mother I didn't sit around all the time and listen you know she was my mom she had I mean she did a job and everything but you know she she wasn't sitting around trying to make me laugh all the time and this down the other and you know showing me a pass and all that now that she I'm 60 she's 82. we could sit around and talk about things on a different level that she would not talk to me about when I was 16 17 years old we were not equals she had her equals that she could you know what I'm saying sit down and talk about her girls that she could call on the phones or her you know right come on somebody so don't ever think your parents don't love you they love you but y'all ain't equal she got somebody that she could call up hey girl you know you see sister Brown and Sister Sister Cobbs and sister birds in them and you know that little crew there the silvers you know you watch them how they interact you know what I'm saying on you know hey girl you know yeah yeah that's how what we doing today and all that you know what I mean but but I'm quite sure when when Jack and Troy and my wife and it was coming up you know uh since the bird was sitting down with them you know no she was the mama see we're acting like a mama she understood her responsibility she was ruffling fouvels you know she was stirring up the nest I feel like preaching now if you go back to eat the eagle Stars the next story right amen mama mama Eagle trying to bring that little eaglet right notice Mama Eagle see anything sometimes Mama's supposed to just be this cuddly little no I almost could get rough that's right huh mama mama Eagle take them up for for uh uh flight lessons drop them mama got you though mama got you Mama Mama come in there one day y'all know what I'm talking about Mama come in the nest one day and just start taking all of the stuff up out of there y'all ever y'all ever been been in your room hey somebody had a preach with me maybe maybe I had the only mama like that but my mama come in there like a wide person did I tell you and me and my brother we should all the sense what we throw stuff all under the bed all in the closet close the door before my mama come in there like a wild lady swinging belts and everything get it get it you think you're fooling me get that stuff out of there I told you to fold them things hi Mama [Applause] that shows you value that shows you that shows you how to uh uh be neat and clean all right all right man let me tell you something my mama will give you in the kitchen the white glove test she come up in there and she be wiping there this ain't clean she got knives all up underneath her look at this yeah oh yeah oh you get it get back up in here she go off and then see another person if you ever talk to my mom she's sophisticated she talks you know her voice is up here but boy when she get mad she come way down here you'll be like you're from the hood ain't you you got a little Hood up in there yeah yeah that that mother Eagle but she come in there she she got him sometimes you gotta make it uncomfortable huh make it uncomfortable make us I swear to God I thought my mama hated me but my mama told me one day when I I was a lot older she said I did that because amen I did not want you to be uh like your daddy right amen I didn't and if you look go back go back to uh proverbs 31. this King mama was telling them not to drink and not to do this and not to do that how to help his mama mama how to handle the like my Grandmama used to say them coattails y'all don't know nothing about that that Old Country School these all these young ladies she broke it down to him she she she she broke life down to him in simplicity right as as a mother that was and you gotta honor that you you gotta listen young people you gotta honor and respect uh a woman that will stand there and fight for you fight for your morals fight for your integrity fight for your virginity fight fight fight fight fight fight you gotta respect that [Music] she's only doing what she's been calling of God to do civility won't let me hear no boyfriend right she right because a lot of us ain't even educated enough well preach with me come on we we lack maturity we we lack the level of understanding to even be in a relationship y'all don't seek your dog on me or Justin messenger right right now this probably only mean that to you but it will after a while yeah right you say why you say I could preach out an experience now I'm 60. and and I wish I I can't do it over again because they say hindsight is 20 20. but I can be informative to this generation that's coming up because because if you go back to the Old Testament when they were given the laws and different things amen Moses said look now you calling you this what you teach your children even the prophet said in marriage and divorce teach your children we gotta teach the children we gotta teach the young adults you say I know I'm educated that's all you is education education don't Translate uh if it's just intellectual what I'm trying to preach this morning I'm gonna get out of here in a minute right because you could be you could be ignorant and educated as it relates to Life come on that's right come on you got to grow you gotta mature young people you you educate yourself young men and young women right educate get an understanding of of who you are your position the things of that nature fatherhood I wish I could do it all over again I believe I'll do a better job at it I try to do the best job I can now right but but you know uh I believe that we're here for such a time as this to to try to inform right because all we had was a lot of infighting and see that's why I don't fight now Doctrine and religion and what you believe you believe what you believe right I just stand for what I believe and what I understand right and and where we understand and believe the same thing praise the Lord but but when you don't comprehend what I comprehend then that's between you and your maker maybe that just hadn't been your season maybe in the next season he'll reveal those things to you well well you know in this season now we could look at things holistically and try to and try to educate this Young Generation because you know God is still looking at the picture of Oneness if we understand Redemption right we go back to Genesis that first family was a Oneness it was in harmony is that right glory to God glory to God so God is looking at that so God has anointed God has anointed men of God to bring a perspective right that goes beyond y'all shouting right a lot of meetings and didn't know nothing when I left y'all talk to me you said don't say that brother why not we we we want for nothing to go we want for a younger generation to be educated right we want for a younger generation to get perspective well I ain't married yet don't tell me you don't want to be huh I believe all y'all your sisters will be married uh that why I believe God anointed a day for y'all to be here this morning to hear the old crank you to educate yourself boy y'all cry y'all cry my wife always used to tell me you start out good and before you get finished you don't get an amen nowhere [Laughter] because it goes see this this goes beyond listen this goes beyond just your your human emotions and all that this this touches the soul when it's not God stopped dealing with that Soul everybody get quiet preacher K how to get an A by a doorway he got a third piece of the lights come on lights next week I'm gonna have a different message it'll be better maybe y'all is out next week did we this week man this week I had I didn't know what I was going to preach on it's been a minute since I had to be well I try to be past 30 I'm different I like I have to say I'm not going to preach like the young evangelist because I'm Not Dead right but let me get on track for about two minutes educate yourself Young Generation y'all young sisters is not married really really do a deep dive pray in your Bible try to find the resources ask the questions you know talk to the pastor you know uh to try to to try to get even you know if they shouted to get them I believe we got a good good man of God that's my brother-in-law uh to to take the time uh to really sit down and give us the information to help us because listen it's it's it goes beyond the cute little white dress in the white tub somebody you ain't had now well most of the time you ain't had no battle sometimes people get took out at the wedding [Music] woman realized boy I ain't gonna be able to do this boom that's just a sense of humor but but you ain't normally you ain't fault no you ain't fought one devil were you up there looking cute and walking down and you and and he crying saying you walking down with your daddy and your little white guy on and he's sitting there and then next time you know a few years down the line he just sitting in the corner crying y'all talk to me I got a quote too now but I'm talking about a little fella sitting up in church with the children want me to walk down for 11. he got a children yeah yeah see and this I think this is why this is why they they're trying to mandate that uh uh couples get counseled right cause look at look at the divorce rate not just in the world right and I think at the core of the whole thing it's just that people like the knowledge at the core that that that if things were given to them and quickened to them it would have made a whole lot of difference right amen because a lot of times people people come from different backgrounds and and everything you know right well well we weren't giving any much of anything and what most young men we learn we learn from our cousins and we learned from our uncles cheating and running around and a lot of times even in the Pulpit they cheating and running around and that's what we learned huh that's what we learned these young men right glory to God Amen we was we wasn't given the tools right so you know I believe I believe that my job as long as I'm preaching is to help give us the tools what's what's what's needed right to go to to the different levels in our life as Christians this real Christianity right amen real Christianity is what you do outside of these doors huh You're Gonna shout out you want to the devil let y'all shout in this building be waiting on you when you get in the car I saw you I saw you
