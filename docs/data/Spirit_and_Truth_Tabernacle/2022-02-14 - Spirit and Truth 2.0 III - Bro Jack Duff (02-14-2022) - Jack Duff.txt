as well and uh just looking forward to god just meeting us in a very very special way so here in john 15 and also i'll read from john 4 as well in a second but john 15. it says i am the true vine and my father is the husband man a couple things i also forgot to just mention brother quentin and brother jerry um i think they came along this time and got everything set up on friday and i i want to say thank you for them brothers i i saw them coming out of here by nine o'clock uh driving down i see them coming i said they still it is am i so i appreciate them brothers uh i was telling brother quinn we'll just get it done sunday morning now and but they stayed around they made it happen so god bless you uh uh for for your efforts there uh really really thank god and and um a praise report before i go further i want to thank god for blessing my wife with her caught it she'd been wanting and man she'd been desiring and she just been waiting and waiting and uh you know remember walking to the dealership and they pretty much told us you ain't gonna never find that car at that price we're just gonna wait sir and uh we waited we waited and we found it at the price we want to pay amen and uh and god just god just manifests himself and i just i i thank god i'm gonna just share this with y'all um pay your bills on time pay your bills on time and i'm gonna just share that with y'all uh when you pay your bills on time in our um economy or here in the united states that we do a lot of things on credit and if you can pay your bills on time you can get what they call good credit right my my wife don't really have a job right now we do have a business and you know i'm talking about just the last two weeks she just start getting a real not even a it's a paycheck i can't call it a real paycheck it's a paycheck but she get paid something to put a little money in her pocket and um but you know it's not about how much money you have if you got good good credit to take you a long way and and she walked in there with what we call good credit they call it excellent credit and when she walked in there with excellent credit and i would i just let them talk to talk talk talk look look i ain't paying this i ain't paying that take this off take that off that okay now we're down to the number now when y'all run credit y'all gonna see this y'all gonna see that and uh they say okay when they ran her credit they saw it was 30 points higher than what i said and then they came back and say um you ain't got to put no money down you ain't got to put no money down so when god do things god do thanks so uh pay your bills on time all right now i can read but thank the lord for blessing her amen with with the cause she's been desiring amen um i am the true vine and my father is the husband man every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit lord i'm trying to read other thing when you pay your bills on time i might not think about this latest and you have what we call a decent or high credit score the other thing that happens for you is you get a excellent interest rate and when you have a lower interest rate it allows you to be able to afford more car brother waiting is that right he's in finance so uh but but just understand this is the way it works i i've been to the car lot and and i had bad credit and i was just praying that when they ran my credit that i'd be able to leave with the keys in my hand and oftentimes you do leave with keys in your hand but your interest rate is so high that it's it's very hard to pay for the car but if you just pay your bills on time what's the sermon in that pay your bills on time you can go in there with confidence you you approach the call out in a totally different you know you got a different aura when you walk through the door come on somebody well you you just got a different or are you not sitting there like lord please lord please no no no no no god i know this gonna work out i ain't even worried about and they gonna do it the way i say they're gonna do it i i i get up and walk in a minute like i do a dave ramsey so quick you ain't sad you ain't talking my language but when they see you got good credit they don't want you walking so pay your bills on time all right glory glory now i'm going to start over i am the true vine and my father is the husband man every branch in me that beareth not fruity taketh away in every branch that beareth that beareth fruit he purgeth it glory that it may bring forth more fruit now you cling through the word which i have spoken unto you abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye accept ye abide in me i am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast him into the fire and they are burned if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you amen here in john chapter 4 uh verse 23 but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth glory to god glory let's pray father we thank you for your word and thank you um for this opportunity just to share god with the saints of god we trust lord jesus that as the word is going forth your spirit would have preeminence in this place the true god would just speak to our hearts strengthen us encourage us correct us direct us instruct us lord whatever you desire to do here today may you do it may we not come to church lord just as a routine but may we come today father expecting to hear from you help us to look beyond the veil and to see christ hide us all behind the cross that we might not be seen but me jesus be on this blame god we give you all the glory all the honor and all the praises in jesus name we pray amen amen you can be seated jesus told us in [Music] john 4 that they that worship god must worship him in spirit and in truth uh we are continuing our thought in spirit and truth 2.0 and um just god has been good and like i told you this is when i'm using the term 2.0 and what is um uh marquise what's your oldest sons xavier yeah xavier uh i'm using 2.0 it's a play on words the 2.0 actually represents 20 and uh 20 years of ministry that god has given us and and and i i'm thankful for it last week we left church and xavier walked out and he says uh brother jack you're in here preaching on 2.0 and look at your car and uh on the back of my car at that time and i don't have it anymore xavier amen it said um uh uh ats 2.0 it was a 2.0 liter engine and and he said look it's a 2.0 and he just tying my car into the messages i said these young people something else you know they said you in there preaching about it you driving in a 2.0 i say well praise the lord you know i appreciate that but uh but you know that 2.0 is really just a um a play on words we're we're really just thanking god for 20 years of ministry um you know and and when we when we i'm using the 2.0 also from a um a technical term uh when we're dealing with uh uh software you know and even sometimes hardware a 2.0 represents an upgrade amen it's an upgrade hallelujah amen and uh in life there's an and and sometimes god wants to take you to things things where he wanted to give you an upgrade glory to god amen and and often times in order to uh to take the upgrades you got to be willing to get rid of the old stuff come on somebody amen hallelujah there's some things that god wants to set you free from there's some things that god wants to deliver you from and and and and and in order to you know i i was i was told a statement years ago uh in order to uh pretty much receive new blessings you got to let go some of the old stuff come on somebody amen and as uh you know brother brother jerry was telling me on on on friday night when i saw him um you know and he saw the car he said he said brother jack you just went from and you just had an upgrade amen in the car that your wife just got that's an upgrade i've been preaching about it right and god just showed it it's an upgrade when you go from something old to something new it's an upgrade hallelujah spiritually god wants to take you to an upgrade in him amen the devil wants to downgrade you hallelujah but god wants to see you do better he wants to give you an upgrade amen and in this season we can expect updates and upgrades hallelujah i'm i'm the expectation for it uh but you know as we were um you know just been kind of coming through there's so many little things that we we stopped along the way to try to bring and and and the church you know would not uh be where it is today if we didn't have all of you amen uh that you are spirit in truth tabernacle can i put it this way we together amen our spirit and truth tabernacles not just brother jack but it's all of us together amen when i leave this pulpit i'm representing you amen when you leave amen you're representing me amen we together our spirit in truth tabernacle glory to god amen so so and i was mentioning last week as we were closing uh in the sermon many of you all made some really really tough choices amen before you came here to be a part of this church you made some really really tough choices but i believe god if he has not already he will reward your decision amen and i finished the sermon with this this quote from uh standing in the gap hallelujah amen it says because thou has chosen the narrow path glory the harder way thou has walked in your own tooth now i'm just i'm just so i'm just so appreciative i heard even a testimony just this week of how um you know one of the sisters you know when she she made up not just a choice just to um uh to be in the church but you know this church has some standards i'm gonna say it again this church got standards and we believe the bible way right we believe from the old testament to the new testament we stand on the bible amen stick around long enough we'll tell you when you're doing something wrong glory to god just stick it now we might not try to skin you the first time you come through the door stick around long enough amen you're gonna hear truth why because you're attending spirit and truth so it's our responsibility to make sure that you get truth if you never hear it nowhere else you gonna hear it here glory to god amen but by here you know we understand something uh uh you know you made some tough decisions many of you all some some oh my goodness my goodness my goodness i'm just i'm going back in my mind there's so many little things amen i remember i remember you know when we first started the church out a man uh oh i was i was saying this a sister you know she made a a a a stand to follow this truth and stay with this word follow this word and got criticized for years by family friends by just criticized like crazy but she stood she she stood on what she believed and and then years later different things began to happen and the people start calling her and said would you pray for me i i know the prayer warriors and i know you are a prayer warrior well you said you used to say then take all that not take that and more you want somebody that can get in contact with god hallelujah right so so so you know um uh you know i'm just you know let me just read this you know just kind of keep moving um but you all chose amen there was a some some huge decisions that you made in order to be part of spirit and truth tabernacle and this quote i just want to encourage you with because thou has chosen glory to god the narrow path the heart away thou hast walked in your own choosing this ain't nothing that brother jack uh uh and i mean encourage you or convince you to do this is something that you chose to do yourself and because thou has walked in your own choosing he says thou has picked the precise and correct way now notice that when you're making a choice you have to know is this the way god wants me to go or not the way god wants me to go and hallelujah god has a way of confirming amen that he has you right where he needs you at the time that you're there can i tell you this morning you in the right place at the right time oh jesus amen thou hast picked the precise and correct way correct decision and it is my way glory to god and he says because of this momentous decision a huge portion of heaven awaits thee my god he says what a glorious decision thou hast made that's that's god speaking back to you amen on the choice that you made what a glorious decision thou hast made this in itself is that which will make and come to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine i'll tell you what if you have not been blessed you will be blessed for the decision that you've made to be a part of spirit and truth 2.0 i believe that i believe that with all my heart now i told you we're looking for some 20s especially when we talk about this 2.0 so i found another 20 and mark 16. let's read this a man uh in mark 16 oh hallelujah glory to god thank you jesus mark 16 verse 15. it says and he said unto them go ye into all the world preach the gospel to every creature my he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover my so then after the lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of god and they went forth and preached everywhere the lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following amen and you know i i i think it is and and and i i wasn't going to make this a part of my sermon but uh you know i i'll i'll just say it uh even you know from the 20 years that we've been in ministry the lord has actually allowed us to fulfill this commission amen in mark 16 uh as a church not just me as a pastor but you know there's ministers that have gone forth from this church amen to to carry the gospel uh into different places of the world and i'm i'm i'm happy about that right i'm happy that you know because that is a sign of a true church right a church that is that is thriving many many ministers have gone out i mean and i'm gonna have uh brother smiley close the services that he was just out last week amen and he can just share some of the things that happened while he was away brother kwaku just got back glory to god i mean there's there's others that that you know i mean my my my nephew caleb he was ministering the gospel and went many places right here from this pulpit glory to god so i'm very very grateful for what i've seen god do amen at this church hallelujah and i know god got more in store you know uh uh um there's a couple things that that has happened lately i told you all my daughter with her getting married uh and i think it's 33 days that's because she said 34 yesterday so i know one last day but 33 days and and what i did you know for this season when i knew that you know the engagement happened i said i pretty much canceled all anything that was going on in my schedule i want to just be around you know i just want to be around and um but as i was just pushing everybody off pushing them off pushing them off now they were waiting on that date glory to god and now when the date of the wedding brother like this is the date like okay uh do you think you can come i'll say oh lord have mercy but one brother i've been pushing off and i told y'all uh he's invited us to come to houston at the first of the first of april uh a church there in houston a young church just just getting started by the grace of god we're going to try to go and just be a blessing to him amen there in april and my my calendar is filling up pretty good in april right now uh because i recently i also got a a a call from uh brother gwenna amen brother whispering and he reached out to me says brother jack now a few years ago you all were coming to london for easter and uh and it says y'all think y'all gonna be able to fulfill that request this year i say oh lord brother i said it's kind of short notice i don't know if we can do that and uh you know so i i finally got to into my you know got settled in my spirit and i said okay brother i will come so easter time i am planning i'll go to go to london i'm sharing that with y'all and and some might say you know what we want to try to go you're welcome you know we'll try to make something happen but i know a short notice and it'll be a little difficult uh this thing i do know is that uh when the lord bless us with our new church especially i'm expecting this year and and easter next year you can forget about it i ain't going nowhere i'm gonna be right there at spirit and truth tabernacle right so i i said to myself i said look you know what i'm probably not gonna have these chances you know too much and so i say okay i think i'll i'll take you you know take you take you up on this we'll try to do this and then he asked me uh something he says brother it says brother jack can you bring uh brother joe underwood jr with you and i said um he said i never thought of that i say when i first went to africa um back in 94 went to nigeria my first time going to africa i went with brother joe underwood senior and now to take his son through international waters would actually be an honor it would be an honor for me to be able to do that and it's just a testimony amen to what god has done for this church and fulfilling amen this scripture that i just read to to take the gospel into all the world preach the gospel to every creature right he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sheep they shall recover so then after he had spoken unto them he received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of god and then went forth and preached and and they went forth and preached everywhere the lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following amen thank you lord that we've had an opportunity to fulfill the great commission let me read here out of the message the revelation of jesus christ from the church age book amen in reference to this scripture brother adam said let me show you another reason why satan hates this book of the revelation of jesus christ in the church amen he knows that jesus christ is the same yesterday and today and forever and he changes not he knows that a whole lot more than do 90 of the theologians he knows that since god is immutable in his nature then he is just as immutable in his ways the satan knows assuredly hallelujah that the original church at pentecost with the power of god mark 16 in action amen is the true church that jesus claims as his own all else is false it has to be he goes on in the revelation of jesus christ he says now remember this christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows how that antichrist spirit should come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes its satan revealing his works attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word i just love this statement amen because we have through these years we have seen how god's people have fallen into lukewarm condition condition we have seen how amen they try to try to destroy this message by discrediting certain things glory to god discrediting a bridge discrediting amen the appearing of seven discrediting god's word amen but we have stood faithful glory to god on the word of god look at what he says he says um i attempted destruction of god's word uh god's people and discredit the screening god's word right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire he fights that my he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is amen what she stands for glory to god and that she can do the greater works she will praise god man one of my favorite quotes she will be an invincible army amen glory to god i'm speaking that over this church we will be an invincible army and do you realize what an invincible army is it's one that is too powerful to be defeated glory to god amen too powerful to be overcome amen an invincible army a praying army a whole fire army glory to god amen that's who we are she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her he will be as definitely thwarted today as when christ withstood his every effort to gain power with him in the desert yes satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them oh how i thank god mark 16 in action that that's who we are you know i was uh just reflecting and so much you know over the years that the lord has done uh i i'm i'm i'm thinking on um a man's sister chinese there um when we we first started the church out and since michelle had come and brought the family we were over at sister tina's house i i don't know what we were there for it might have been a birthday party or something i don't know but uh but we were there and and i remember you know uh sister shanice just you know i don't know she was she was just young i i is this so we if we at 20 years would that make you how how do you know she was she was four years old four years old four about four years and i remember her um um coming up to me you know we're at sister tiguan's house she walked up to me and she just looked at me say are you the preacher at the church and and it hit me you know and i say well i guess i am to preach at the church you know and you know little little moments like that just kind of stick with you uh through life because you most of y'all if you just do and i i haven't been able to share my whole story with everybody but uh but if you would have known me at that time i was a brother that really i ain't really want to start no church i ain't wanting to do i don't i mean just let me go somewhere in this high i didn't want to be here that was not where i want to be right and uh and i'm dodging everybody that's even you know i ain't gonna tell nobody that we had a church i ain't want nobody to come and i just let i want nothing i'm telling you i'm just i'm being honest with you this is just where i was in my spirit at the time right god had to bring me through some healing right but but i'm like no i ain't gonna tell nobody i ain't sharing this with nobody i know nothing and and and i remember uh you know here we are just a few families just gathering and and uh and then my sister gina got a call from a brother and uh the brother say i'm over here in west palm beach and i'm looking for a church to go to and he says he's from south africa and and i need a church to go to while i'm here visiting and you know and he says he said i heard about y'all church and you know i heard about brother smile and i want to come out there and visit so my sister said you know well there's another church a little closer to you just got started and you probably enjoy going there and uh and she said i'm gonna just give you his number his name is uh brother jack duff you can give him a give hit just number you can call him and ask him about uh coming to church and so i get this call i get this message brother say i'm from south africa and i heard about the church uh sister smiley told me about it i wanted to come and visit you and i said oh lord here's the first visitor like this somebody i don't even know i i don't lord i don't want this lord i don't want this so i'm like okay god all right i'ma just go ahead and call the brother back so i picked up the phone and i reached and called the brother and said god bless you brother you know and uh he says he says oh praise the lord pastor he says i was just praying to the lord if it's your will for me to go to this brother's church lord let him call me now and as soon as soon as i said amen the phone's wrong i know it said with the lord so you know what i did i got out of my feelings i got completely out of my feelings this man is praying you know that god let him call now and i call right at that moment so here he comes i'm picking them up bring them in church picking them up bring them to church week in week out and at that time i told you i was a song leader i was uh uh deacon i was a preacher i was you know i mean i did it all you know at that point in time but but he had his brother coming to church and amen and and had no idea who he was glory brother shane from south africa glory coming to us from cape town and uh and and here brother shane just sitting in there and not doing nothing and and one day you know since i was a trustee as well i'm back there we don't run we run the offering so after service i'm there getting the money prepared to put it in the bank and everything and and uh brother shane say um uh passive you don't mind could i play the piano now i want y'all to understand something you gotta you got you to get this you know i mean you gotta when we went we had at those early stages we didn't even have a piano player but we had a piano in the church with no piano player we had it sitting there by faith and and i'm crazy enough to believe that the same thing that happened in brother manners ministry of the anointing come down and played the piano i'm crazy enough to believe that hallelujah if the holy ghost knew how to play piano but but here here you know we we got a piano sitting in the church and nobody able to play the piano nobody in the church i know how to do anything with it it was just when we had a guest maybe maybe brother smiley brought the church over the top i know my sister can play right but we we just had it there but nobody we just sung acapella kind of like what sister bernice did she went old school i got this amen god's got it all in control glory to god right amen but i need you to understand that's that's that's our roots that's where we come from and then god began to add to that oh he's a good god brother shane say pastor you don't mind could i just play around with the piano a little bit while you're in here i said sure you can do that brother that brother got up and he start playing around and said that ain't playing around that's that that that's playing and i went to the brother of me that's in that brother uh as long as you're in this church because i know you got a job that caused you to you know leave and come back and leave and come i said but as long as you're here when you show up your job is to play this piano that's what you do you play the piano brother and brother shane said okay pastor you know i'll gladly do it he and once he got started it inspired many others glory to god he was an inspiration to so many started with sister candace and amen went to my daughter since alexandria sister rachel uh sister rebecca i tried to get sister sarah i tried she can get a few songs down but amen but now we we we got uh uh sister dassa coming i mean you know it's just it's god that has done these things and behind sister dassa i know i got sister uh uh uh uh abigail sister shalom i got come on amen it's a bench that's been created god is good but you know i thank the lord for this i want to just step back just give you a little bit more of the testimony here but the reason that i like to read john 15. one of the things about me that you'll find amen that uh i'm i'm not a person that's just moved with a lot of fanaticism but what moves me is the word right if i can see something in the word if god can quicken something to me in scripture i know that's the eternal word of god i can i can rest my soul on the eternal word of god and i remember you know i just got to give y'all just a little testimony i'm trying to i'm going to get through all this and if i can but uh but years ago i was um i was at home and and my my my uh thing i used to do in the morning because i i didn't watch television and i still don't amen i didn't watch television and uh so but when i was going to work i wanted to uh be able to kind of talk sports with the guys so i would just get a newspaper and i just read what happened in the newspaper so i was ready to talk sports with the guys i ain't watching no game did you see the game no and they just never realized i never saw the game i'm just reading the sports page and then one morning i went downstairs and and i picked up that sports page and i was running back upstairs to read it before i left out to go to work and and uh and and as i as i was picking up the page i'm picking up the paper i heard a voice say if you read your bible as faith as you read that newspaper you'll be much further up the road my lord now i'm telling what i heard and when i heard i say uh now i know the devil didn't tell me that that was the voice of god speaking directly to me if you read your bible as faithful as you read that newspaper you'll be much further up the road a rebuke to me i put that newspaper down i said okay i'ma start reading my bible and on that day i found a bible reading plan for a one-year bible reading plan and i started reading and from that day to this day i read through the bible every year i do one-year bible reading plans every year i invite you join me on the journey because if you read your bible as faith as you got on facebook instagram you would be much further up the road so i've been doing this for for years and you know so so i i and i know now why god and there's so much that god just shows you in that because um i can prove the message with the bible that's why i believe the message because i see it in the bible i've read my bible that's why you can't get me on a lot of nonsense you can't get me with a bridge and a bear and all no no i read my bible this uh bears and bridges not in here that ain't what we talking about that's something personal for him but i'm talking about the message part go really god but i read my bible that's why you're not just don't pull a lot over my oh over me like that and and you know i don't know at all i'm still reading and learning it and what i find is that different seasons in your life god will speak different things to you it's an eternal word i found out something recently that went the word even though even though it might have manifested itself in one generation in time past it's not just a historical book it's an eternal word so it will it has the tendency to repeat itself and it will repeat itself in your generation oh come on somebody amen just recently reading the word of god and moses goes down and tell pharaoh not just let my people go but let my son go when i saw that i say oh that's for me pharaoh which is the devil today satan let my son go let my daughter go let my mama go let my sister you cannot hold them zero let my people go praise god i don't care what they do him they don't belong to you i don't care how much you get them trapped in sin you gonna have to let them go praise god it's time for them to get an upgrade time to get a release time to get an update the devil is a liar praise his holy name glory to god amen you don't know who you're messing with satan you don't know who you're dealing with this is the pride of christ we know who we are and i'm here to tell you bring one inbound but we got a revelation god uses human beings to redeem other human beings you come with one bound but leave with two free hallelujah i don't even know where i was hey thank you jesus hallelujah but we have we have seen god and i'm expecting more of god hey hey hey hey hey hey hey i'm expecting more of god i say let my son go man i read that this week i say hey that's it that's enough of me to start shouting on right there hey man you you have to claim claim your own claim your own they don't belong to you satan they never belong to you god gave them to me my child is a miracle amen my child is a miracle sometimes some of y'all need to go back in your mind and think about what god did for you even to bring forth that child and they're gonna get to this point and you're gonna think you think the devil amen is gonna just take him like that amen the further you take him in see him the greater the testimony greater the testimony grace grace god's grace grace that can save us from all our sins amen uh and so i'm trying to get my thought back and but uh but you know we just we just thank the lord for for for this and uh i know i was talking about brother shane i talk about y'all help me where was i the bible i got past that read my bible okay so i invite you read your bible brother random say we get closer to god by reading our bible and praying every day so you know i i so so for years i've i've read my bible all the way through and i'm i'm on it again this year i start january 1st i start reading and i encourage you if you say well i can start january first start like i did start right in the middle of the year right where start where the plans start and just keep on going keep going and and i've done that for i know it's over 20 years over 20 years and i don't say that in a bragging way amen but i i do say that that god had to prepare me for where i'm at right now and this is what this is what it this this is how he prepared me right so um you know one of the times i was reading my bible and i was reading john 15. and when i was reading john 15 it said there i'm the vine my father is a husband husband man and every branch of me that beareth not fruit you take it away and every branch that bears fruit it purgeth it and as i'm reading that it's like the the words just rolls up at the bible what are you saying god every branch of me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it god so i'm sitting here and i'm going through this in my mind and through my spirit like lord i i know i can't stay where i'm at i got to move on i mean there's some things that's happened that i know uh that it's causing me to step out of this environment that i'm in and uh and as i was just kind of processing the lord just kind of showed him he says no it's not because oftentimes people leave a church and the first thing they want to do is down the church don't you do that like the church ain't do nothing for you don't do that don't get engaged in nothing like that think about the good things satan always wants you to focus on the bad things think about the good things so so so when you know you get you get there and you know and and you start going through and you think about leaving church and like okay okay and and don't don't get me wrong sometimes truth just got to be shared but but but but you ain't got to say it in a way where you're trying to down that ministry so so you know uh as i'm going through like lord this is this is a fruitful ministry it's been very uh good to me and to my family and it's been this has been that i mean what's going on but as i start reading and just focusing on that he says he he um uh uh every branch in me that bear not fruit he taketh away and every branch that bear through he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit right so so i begin to realize that sometimes it has to be cut in order to go through an update in order for it to bring forth more fruit it has to go through a process of purging right and and the purging process is never easy hallelujah it's never easy so so as i realized what was going on say okay lord i i know you're speaking to me through this verse you know i'm going through this purging process and you know and i have to say it like this you know uh paul said that uh the the believers in this day say you are the seal of my apostleship but when i look at the saints of spirit and truth tabernacle i say you are the seal of my pastoral this is the fruit now i remember many times when i go back to my old past and i come with the church we're bringing the fruit this is the fruit of the ministry this is not anything that brother jack dinner's on but this is the fruit of the ministry glory to god but as i was you know processing this and just thinking through it praying over it i said lord i know you're speaking to me through this and i appreciate you you know and just just hearing your voice and i'll just i'll just wait you know just to get more you know from you and and and i remember going to a meeting uh one of the one of the brother coleman's meetings and as i was headed to the meeting went there and the first service i believe we sat down and and brother david musgrove from at that time he was from oklahoma but now he lives out in tucson uh he came and he was the medicine he he says okay we're gonna preach amen the sermon today and and i want you to turn your bibles to john 15. i say oh my he says i turn your bibles you start reading the scripture and i say oh my lord as soon as he read the scripture i say now this is the same one that god just had elevate for me and the brother titled his sermon fruit much fruit more fruit i just even from the title i almost stopped listening i just start praying to me say god i know you speaking to me right now i know i i know i know you saying something to me i don't even know what to do i don't know god i know i'm in your presence then nobody knew what i was going through at that moment no tears nothing just just hearing from god i said lord what do you want me to do at that moment i'm sitting there in this in the service saying okay god i know you just spoke to me through your word now what do you want me to do that's what he said start the church i said god what you want me to title the church it says spirit and truth tabernacle now i knew where that was right back in the book of john hallelujah so i held on to that for two years didn't say anything to anybody not even my wife i waited i waited i waited and while i was waiting i want you to understand i was very faithful to church you know you ain't got to be telling everybody what you're doing let it just happen and you know because i saw i mean i'm going way back in my history some of this is not even my notes but i saw different people transition from our church and the way they did it was so bad some of some some of these are witnesses in here the way they did it was so bad the way they went to some of the people in the church and the way they just handled themselves it was so bad i never felt even comfortable doing things that way i would have conversations with my pastor but i'm like no i ain't going to do things like that and at the very time that i finally decided okay i'm going to leave this going you know i can't i can't i can't do it anymore i left but i i've already been having conversations with him and uh you know and i remember um at the time that i decided to leave his his mom passed away now that really put a damp in me i'm like how i'm gonna leave him now his mama just passed i'ma serve until he gets things kind of situated i stayed right there did as much as i could the people are a witness the people are a witness i was faithful i did everything until the day it was time for me to go amen and when i walked out you know i finally told you that this gonna be my it's gonna be it's gonna be my last sunday whatever and uh you know i gave them the keys and and whatever that was and i said okay i got to move on and and i realized because god told me to say look you you can't be blessed until you move on abraham could not get blessed until he was able to just leave where he was at he couldn't he could receive the blessings of god trying to stay in earth that one the black that were in the black that's that was not the place where the blessings were for abraham now other people living in ur might have been blessed but you got to know where your blessings are and for abraham he had to leave the land of earth once he left then god could bless him now and that's when god said now look around look around look at all the stars look at this look at that look at everything it was just sitting there waiting for him so i learned i had to leave i had i couldn't have any attachments i couldn't be holding on to keys of the church and out here doing something else no no no no let it go completely while i was waiting on the lord to you know to um uh to lead us to our next step and i had not shared it with my wife yet what the name of the church was you know she was on the journey with me and as i'm talking about two or three year journey we were on and finally god began to deal with her in dreams and as he began to deal with her we began to get the meaning of those dreams and we knew that okay this is this is the lord this is the lord we know that that we know so she began asking what we gonna do i said we're gonna start a church what's gonna be the name of church i say spirit and true tabernacle say how you can be so certain about them things so fast i said god told me this two years ago and i just get into i'm just getting to the point to tell you i had to wait for you to get to a certain spot the cheers okay okay she knew that it was it was of the lord so we went and talked to our pastor amen we both went in and talked to our past and said this is what's going on and i just kind of told him i didn't tell him i was starting a church i just told him say look whatever the lord calls me to do i believe whether anybody else believe or not i believe i'm free to do whatever god calls me to do so i just told him like that and uh and then he looked at my wife and says now sister erica you ready for this she and i'm like oh lord what's she gonna say that's a tough question and she responded with one of the best answers i'll always remember it she says nobody could ever be ready for this i said that's wise nobody could ever be ready for this you're taking a step of faith and you're just trusting god all the way through and when you can look back 20 years down the road say oh god you did it you all know about the history of the churches i won't go into all that but i'm gonna i'm gonna share a scripture here with you i think i got that part of testimony let me share a scripture i told you we're looking for them 20s and this scripture that i want to share is the seventh of those scriptures with twenties joshua chapter 20. the lord also spake unto josh was saying speak to the children of israel saying a point out for you cities of refuge wherever i speak unto you by the hand of moses so what we got what we're going to get from here is that god had certain places that people could go and get refuge you just couldn't go to any city now i hope you can read between the lines you just couldn't go to any city you had to go to the city that god established as a place of refuge if you wanted refuge hallelujah now notice this it says uh speak to the children of israel saying a point out for you cities of refuge whereof i speak unto you by the hand of moses that the slayer that killeth any person unawares and unwittingly may flee thither and and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood now understand what is being spoken here if a person happened to uh uh uh commit manslaughter a man uh that killed somebody unaware unintentionally amen in those days the law was set up an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth so if if you kill somebody's brother or sister something like that they had the right to come after you and kill you because you slayed their relative and it just and just i mean and it was law that allowed them to do that but god provided a place that if you did this unintentionally amen if you did this unwittingly if you did this amen not in a way where it was premeditated you had a place that you could go to get refuge and what that refuge provided you jews that you never had to look over your shoulder you never had to worry about somebody coming to take your life you had protection you had security amen you had peace of mind glory to god you had everything you need when you got to the city of refuge glory to god i'm telling you spiritually spiritually i'm talking about me spiritually i found a place of refuge not just amen not just in christ but god put me a part of a ministry where i can have some peace oh i got there i got to keep reading amen that the slayer that killeth any person unawares and unwittingly may flee thither and they shall be your refuge from the adventure of blood and when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city and shall declare his cause so when you come to the city you got to tell them what while you're there i feel like shouting you just don't just run up in the city like you ain't did nothing hey you got to tell them i did it i'm guilty but i'm sorry repent when you get to the city don't count don't try to hide in the city without repenting get that sin straight glory to god he's oh some people just want to just hide in the church no you can't do it like that get that thing right i told you you might sit here for a few weeks and nobody say nothing but all of a sudden something come right down your alley amen this is a city of refuge that god has established this is a place of refuge god has established it amen somebody said brother jack that's pretty bold i know i know where i'm standing i know where i'm standing i told you this scripture has a way of repeating itself amen glory to god look at it look at it amen um and when he when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city and shall declare is causing the ears of the elders of the city they shall take him into the city unto them now i'm going to tell you all something about me and this is something that i've been able to keep for 20 20 years that's why i said it a few wednesday night and and one sister in here been able to accuse me of being fresh with him or doing anything out of character not one sister in here so often times a that you'll you'll see me if somebody want to meet with me you don't want to just meet with me you understand you don't want to just meet with me what you're asking is can i meet with you and your wife that's what you're asking me especially a sister you ask me can i meet with you and your wife i always have her there as a witness so can't nobody accuse me of nothing and sometimes when it comes to brothers amen i get brother troy involved you want to meet with me and the deacon notice what the scripture just said the elders of the church right you want to meet with me and somebody else gloria i got to have special insurance on myself because sir people come in with any kind of thing accuse me of anything and and y'all saints y'all be careful yes i want to help people but you know you know people come with certain spirits amen i want you to talk to the pastor uh hold on get brother come here brother come come sit with me in this meeting amen and and oftentimes i have to do that and you know lord have mercy just don't you know if you see brother troy sitting in there it's a reason i i need a witness well why brother i'm you ain't got to ask why brother jack did i'm telling you i want a witness in here sometimes you might need somebody to give you a different opinion than mine praise the lord sometimes you just think pastor crazy old-fashioned oh get it from another another another person's point of view is too praise the lord i i ain't preached yet i ain't even got started preaching it but but but but um understand this you know when something go wrong somebody did something wrong they had to meet with the elders of the city amen when they got there they had to meet with the elves of the city you didn't get a place to stay until you met with the elders i hope you're getting this you didn't get a house to stay in until you met with the elders of the city look when when he had when he that dove flee unto one of those cities shall stand at the entering of the gates of the city and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elves of that city they shall take him into the city unto them and give him a place that he may dwell among them they showed you where to stay you didn't even pick out your own house come on somebody amen and if the avengers blood pursue after him then they shall not deliver a slayer up into his hand because he smote his neighbor unwittingly and hated him not before time that means they would stand there for you and vouchers i know i i know it's an eye for an eye and a two-for-two but you can't take this one because he did it unwittingly and we believe his story we have provided him a place of refuge he can stay right here and you cannot touch him put your weapons down glory and can you imagine a man a man sitting in a city refuge with no stress hallelujah he can sit there with no stress he know that everything is all good glory hallelujah everything all good now now now i got to read a few things for you because you know you got to understand when god bring you to a spot where he relieved you from your stress and man he relieved you from some of the the hurts and the pains and all these other things that you done gone through god have to bring healing to you and when god does that you got there's some things you got to do let me just read the rest of this amen if the avenger blood pursue er even uh pursue after him then they shall not deliver the slayer up into his hand because he smote his neighbor unwittingly and had hated him uh or not before time and he should dwell in that city until he stand before the congregation for judgment and until the death and until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days glory he couldn't leave until the high priest died then shall the slayer return come into his own city and unto his own house unto the city from whence he fled and they appointed kardashian galilee in mountain of tally and shechem and mount ephraim and kurjath arba which is hebron and mount in the mountain of judah and on the other side jordan by jericho eastwood they assigned beezer in the wilderness upon the plane out of tribe of ruben and ramoth and gilead out of the tribe of gad and golan and bashan are out of tribe of manasseh these were the cities appointed for all the children of israel and for the stranger that so joineth among them that whosoever killeth any person that unawares might flee thither and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood until he stood before the congregation oh my i want to read just a couple of things amen if i can i'm i think i'm gonna have to skip something here i want to come i'll tell you there's a responsibility to have i'm going to let it letting off the pressure but this the quote that i'm going to read amen and this is from paragraph 81 and letting off the pressure hallelujah lord glory glory glory look at this says now if you want to do right i'm so glad tonight to tell you that there is a city of refuge and that's jesus christ if you want if you don't want to do wrong the enemy's after you then there's a way of escape and that escape is jesus christ amen there's a place where you can come and let off the sting but if you love to sin and you don't want god then the enemy is going to overtake you somewhere you can't come to christ because you don't want to and when this man comes to christ this place of refuge when a man come in the old testament the first thing he had to come upon his own free will i love this you can't come to christ with your brother you can't come to christ with your sister you got to come on your own free will it's got to be your own decision that i'm going to follow god right since you got you got to come upon his own free will that's the way you have to come to christ he says another thing you must be satisfied whoo hallelujah amen once you get to this city of refuge once you get to this place in christ you got to be satisfied while you are there oh i love this you can't hang around every day crying that's what the prophet said you can't be sitting around complaining about this complaining about that you need to start thanking god for this and thanking god for that says you can't hang around every day crying amen amen i like to get out of here i like to get out of here they they would put you out if that's the attitude you got they'll put you out he says you must willfully want to stay once you get to a place of refuge you must willfully want to stay it must be that you must want to stay in that city when you come to christ you can't look back to the world the bible said he that puts his hand on the plow and turns the look back is not worthy of the plowing now there's where so many so-called christians make their mistake so they act like they're going to plow but the first little thing comes along they blow up about it i'm moving on in this amen in this this message i'm going down to paragraph 92. the man must want to stay in the refuge he can't go out there going there complaining he must want to stay no complaining about it outside i love this i love this statement outside outside he dies inside he's safe i told you there's only certain places that god appointed the children of israel to go history has a strange way of strange way of repeating itself amen outside he dies inside he lives and and and you know it's been you know i and i i know this i've known this i hear it from so many different sources there's many people that have been with us on this journey been a part of spirit and truth over the years complex comes up just a little complex something that could be worked out but they decide that no i'm just going to leave i'm not going to be a part of it anymore and outside they die inside they live let me tell you something right now if you are looking for the perfect church it won't find i'm gonna tell you why i'm gonna tell you why i'm i'm gonna tell you why as soon as i came in it wasn't perfect no more as soon as soon as i arrived it was not perfect anymore as soon as you got there it stopped being perfect so if you're looking for a perfect church you ain't gonna find that one what you need to understand is that we are gonna have to go through some things where we just gonna let iron sharpen iron and we just learn to work with each other come on somebody yeah we didn't learn to work with each other no glory to god i mean them sisters i was given a hard time on this program i was they was they're scared to call me i know it they slip one on me like i ain't see it i say it's okay we learn to work together we love each other anyway it don't change it don't change i'm still past when we still sink right hallelujah let me keep going outside outside he dies inside his safe well i want to say something to people here if you're not a christian i come to this city of refuge about 31 years ago and brother i've never wanted to go out i come to the city ref he says oh i come into christ everything that i longed for was in here i don't want to go out i pray daily oh god i'm so happy here just let me stay i never want to leave and i know he'll never leave me i know he'll never leave you and the pressure gets great if it does then he is our outlet so we don't have to worry about it if you're all pressured up and don't know what you're going uh no no know where you're going what's going to happen to you after death and you know you're going to die sometimes you've got to you you've got you got it to do then the thing to do is come to christ the refuge and let off the pressure sell it settle it once for all there's a place you can go to settle all your sins you got to live like every day wondering if boy if jesus come back today i ain't ready you ain't got to live like that there's a place that you can go and actually have refuge there's a place that you can stay and know that god is pleased with the way that you're living there's a place that you can come into and that's not just the church i do believe this church is a city of refuge i know it has been for me and that's why i want to stay i want to stay i ain't looking for i'm not looking to go nowhere else i want to just stay right here i love spirit and truth tabernacle i love the saints here at spirit and truth tabernacle i love i love the family that we have created i just enjoy this praise i i love preaching to this group sometimes you know i go out and i preach a little place and say oh this ain't like this ain't like home are you preaching at home you're gonna get somebody yelling and screaming back at you and it doesn't make you want to just keep preaching sometimes when i go someplace i want to just take all y'all with me come on y'all i know we'll have some church over here glory to god but it's nothing nothing like spirit and truth tabernacle so so so but greater than just this church christ is that city of refuge and when we when when when we looked at in scripture there were six cities that god gave moses to establish as a place of refuge six is the number of man but seven is completion glory to god so the seven city would be christ you can find peace in him if you're looking for peace he's the person of peace and he provides you the peace that you need you don't have to wander anymore there's hope for your future god can give you your deliverance god can give you freedom god can give you a god can give you joy like you've never experienced before i was talking to brother wesker just yesterday and he we were just saying like you know serving god it pays to serve god it pays if you just commit yourself to the lord you'll just see just i mean everybody got problems in life i ain't gonna say i ain't gonna say you're gonna come to jesus and you're gonna have no issues no you're gonna have to pray through something you're gonna have to pray through something but i can tell you this it's i i rather if i'm gonna go through in this life i'd rather go through with jesus then without him i encourage you just give god your all surrender all get into that city of refuge which is christ let him save you from your sins you ain't got to look over your shoulders i used to i used to live a life that now i'm gonna have to close this up i had something else i want to share but i have to just let it be i used to live a life where i didn't know whether i was going to make the rapture or not i ain't know i remember one time having a dream and and uh and in the dream this train was coming and you know the train was uh and i felt like that train represented the rapture and i wasn't on the train i was going to church every week but i wasn't on that train and i said lord jesus i'm going to miss it lord i need to i need to i need to get my heart right god i need i need to i get need to change some things i need i want to be right i want to make it god and i was sometimes god give you something like that to shake you up a little bit so as i got shook up i said lord i i need this lord god you got to change me you got to do something for me i got desperate next thing you know a cousin of mine called me said jack i had a dream it was a train and i saw you on the train i say praise god amen i had i had i have found some refuge i got things right with god and i knew he was pleased with the life that i was living want to be pleased with the life that you're living that life has got to be according to his word society has taught us all kinds of things and those things that society has taught us against the word of god we can't live in sin and die and go to heaven we can't do that and and nowadays everybody you talk to that die everybody you talk to that die their relatives always say well they're in a better place are they you know hell was created for the devil and his angels and then the bible said hell hath enlarged its mouth and the reason hell got larger because more people wanted to go and if you live in sin you live in sin you're going to die and you're sin some of us want to try to take a chance that oh maybe right at my death lord forgive me you might not get that opportunity can tell you right now uh if sister wayson uh hadn't lived the life that she lived i don't think she would have had that opportunity it just came upon her just like that god took a just like that just like that so so you need to be ready why you got a chance why you got an opportunity get ready i want to invite you to come to the city of refuge and when you get there you got to be satisfied you can't be in the city of refuge talk about oh i remember the parties i used to go to i remember the time i used to have i used to when i hung on the corner i remember no you can't be in the city of refuge like you know why because what happened is if you start thinking that way next thing you know the enemy will pull you out the city refuge and you know what the high priest ain't dead yet so that avenger has every right to come against you and slay you you got to get in the city stay in the city and be satisfied in the city lord i don't want the things of the world i don't want to act like the world oh glory to god like they talked about sister wasted on yesterday say what i think it was the nephew said they'd never seen her in a pair of pants got other other family members just like that and when and she go to the the people this is her boss your boss she go to the boss it lets you know who the boss was even even the boss said he knew he knew who was boss go to the boss daughter i mean can you imagine that's some boldness i can just see ladies don't dress like this can y'all just get it the daddy say you got any memory any memory of beryl and the only thing come out her mind is when she told me young lady that will bring judgment to you if you never got it right but that left an impression on that young lady and we want to live lives where we're leaving impressions like that on others there is a city you can go to you can find peace that you never found before you don't have to keep going here because we search a piece in so many places and we don't find it we look for it in relationships and we don't find it i got a sermon that i've been i i'm a preacher i'm just i've just been waiting waiting but i'm let you know ahead of time i'm preaching a sermon hurt people hurt people and i'ma tell you sometime when you look at young people in certain sins i want to look deeper because hurt people hurt people you see somebody walking away from the message hurt people hurt people our our our response is just be prayerful pray for the person just pray that god and bring deliverance and and i'm gonna tell you something the scripture tells us that if we just believe on them let me write john 5 24 let me just read this really quick in john 5 24. it don't have to be uh some major event it's just believing on christ bible says here in john 5 24 says verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but it's passed from death unto life it's just take it into your heart taking the word of god in your heart believe in god i believe that's the truth and i want to walk according to your word repentance god forgive me of my sin i can't ask you for somebody else but i can talk about me forgive me of my sin and then give me strength to walk according to your word and i'm going to tell you something when you repent god don't hold god don't hold nothing against you and since god don't hold nothing against you i can't either when you repent you repent and you just move on we all move on but god just want to know want to make just it's got to be true sincere repentance i made it to the city of refuge god i'm happy to be here i ain't looking to leave god i want to stay right here i'm satisfied with jesus i'm satisfied let's pray lord your word has gone forth it's not by accident that hearts are here to hear what has been spoken even those that are online it's not by accident you don't make mistakes god you know what pleases you you've written it in your word and all we got to do is follow what has been written in the word of god and live according to that my prayer today father is that you would bring fruit from the thought you god would get the glory and that you would get the honor that you would set every captive free we don't have to we might have come in here bound but we don't have to leave the same way even now in our hearts we could just have a conversation with you god i don't want to live this way ma i'm just thinking of this quote i just didn't get a chance to read and there's some people lord that just don't want to live the way that they're living they really don't want to do that god that is not brother branham say i feel sorry for them because i know that's not the way that they want to live because there's a place there's there's a hope uh there's a place of refuge that they can go to god that they don't have they can let off the pressure they can come they can run the bible says that the name of the lord is a strong tower the righteous run in and they are safe we can find that safety we can find that peace we can find everything we need god when we come to christ father i pray that somebody would find their way today lord even now that they would just yield themselves god to your perfect plan for their lives we give you the glory [Music] we give you the honor we give you the praise it's in jesus name that we pray amen amen praise the lord amen let's finally just come and just close the saturday man on the day and just share a little bit about last weekend and just whatever the lord puts in your heart amen god bless you all i appreciate your lord this morning amen we serve a wonderful god you know i was just sitting back there thinking um it's just a blessing to be here this boy that is that sounded weak i don't know about y'all but it's it's you know i've often said this when we were in okeechobee that if it's any place i'd rather be it would be here with brother jack uh by growing kind of growing up spiritually knowing brother jack and knowing his nature one thing i know he's gonna stay with the word of god you know he used to be tough duff but uh he he's grown and he's seasoned and uh i just i just really appreciate them so much and stand for the word of god uh one thing about it when it when it just comes down anything just give me the word of god if i feel like he's just gonna compromise and everything i can't sit up under you because one thing i i've i've grown to realize it's gonna take the word of god to change us it's gonna take the word of god to rapture us and uh this is a place of peace it's the place of of growth and and maturity and no no matter no matter what we're going through i think that that we god has given us a word in this season that's transforming all of us i'm being changed my situation is being changed amen in spite of what what things has been i see change i see change in my home i see changes in me like like we we said you know we preached on last week i'm just saying this and get out of the way uh what we preached here determination and uh and preaching that i you know i brought up quite a few things and and uh i said you know what i have to change i can't live in the past i got to live in the future i got in and then changed sometimes it's not something that you talk about right right i know i know i know uh they they often say that women uh uh live by words i'm a man i don't live by words you you don't impress me with words not so much i i'm the type of person i like to see action and and i don't like just all the time just use words i like to show action there's got to be action but um i'll leave that alone cause i'm feeling like jack left a little something up here but uh uh uh on uh i just continue to pray for us uh also um we we're starting to get out and i supposed to be in arizona this weekend but god had other plans and uh so so we're here and uh we we just got uh meetings lined up in the future a couple of times a month we're trying to get out and just exercise the gift of god last week we were in sarasota i hadn't preached there and oh god i won't even say how long but uh god knows all things and had a wonderful time wonderful wonderful time um we preached on the uh determination and you know god the scripture said he confirms his word with signs followed and sometimes god confirms his word as a minister sometimes god allows you to say things and you don't even know you're just saying it and you just kind of going on you like this ain't even in my notes and nothing like this but i'm sad anyway and uh last weekend i just made a couple of just comments i can't even right now remember what prompted me to say it but it just kind of was in line of thought and uh after we got finished we got finished preaching um a sister uh uh got in the prayer line and she said i got a a praise report and a testimony and she said i i want to give god thanks she said um last night i was talking to my two daughters and uh she said a couple of things that you said bert batum i said to my daughters last night and one of them that i can remember is that she i was just talking about like i said i don't remember what prompted me but i was just talking about sometimes you know people can't see the forest for the trees because you ain't so so close but it's it's the people on the outside can just really see uh uh the forest and could just really see what you're going through and so she said uh uh i told my daughter the exact same thing last night and then it was something else she told another daughter and she said when you said that i looked at you and they looked at me and they had to know that that was god because i didn't i don't even know the sister i don't remember her even going to sarasota so so god is real god god is still speaking still still speaking to us one of the things that that i often and i'm gonna get out of the way uh used to admire about sister nelly since nelly never came to the office a whole lot she she never done i need to talk to you every blue moon baby but uh she would always say if i got a problem i'm just gonna bring it to church and i know once that man get under that anointing god's going to speak to me and he never failed to one time and and that's the way we ought to come to church if we got anything on our heart just just bring it on our heart and say lord speak to me like ashley sing that song speak to my condition tell me what i need to know and i guarantee you that man in that office is that right he'll speak he'll speak he'll speak that fella back there and speak got to speak to our conditions is that right let me go on let me go just continue to pray for us uh continue to pray for uh sister wayson's family uh she's definitely gonna be be missed amen uh my little spot back they ain't gonna be able to look over there and see anymore but i thank god um i know where she's at amen this morning so we appreciate it let's just stand and we'll have a dismissal prayer and like i say just continue to pray for me continue to pray for my children um also keep pray to god to keep him covered by by his blood amen it's about his gracious father we just thank you for uh your word on this morning spirit and truth uh 2.0 and uh we just thank you for the testimonies that that brother jack is sharing as many things that i could even share along the same lines i i just hmm [Music] [Music]
