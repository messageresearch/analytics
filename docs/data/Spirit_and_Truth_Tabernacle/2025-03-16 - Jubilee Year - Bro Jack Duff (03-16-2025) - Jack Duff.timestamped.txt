[1:02:59] turn with me also to Leviticus uh
[1:03:03] 25 we'll read um some verses from there
[1:03:08] uh before we jump into our thought and
[1:03:11] um before I forget uh our uh topic today
[1:03:16] is Jubilee year amen
[1:03:20] jubile
[1:03:21] year amen as I was meditating on this
[1:03:27] that old song came back to my mind this
[1:03:31] is the
[1:03:33] Year of
[1:03:35] Jubilee when a lame shall walk all right
[1:03:39] and the blind shall
[1:03:42] see and they say when the
[1:03:48] Lord will set the captiv
[1:03:51] free and it was a declaration this is
[1:03:55] the Year of Jubilee and we would just
[1:03:58] get excited with that and we at a
[1:04:04] I we put a little Jewish Twist on
[1:04:17] it this is a
[1:04:21] year stop stop stop stop stop no I ain't
[1:04:26] going to let y'all do that turn to
[1:04:28] Leviticus
[1:04:29] [Applause]
[1:04:31] 25 and the Lord spake unto
[1:04:35] Moses in Mount siai
[1:04:40] saying I know how y'all are so I'm not
[1:04:42] going to let
[1:04:46] y'all the Lord spake unto
[1:04:49] Moses in Mount Si
[1:04:52] saying Speak unto the children of isra
[1:04:56] Israel and say unto them when
[1:04:59] ye come into the
[1:05:02] land which I give you then shall the
[1:05:06] land keep a Sabbath unto the Lord so the
[1:05:11] land the land had to keep a
[1:05:14] [Applause]
[1:05:15] Sabbath it wasn't just the people
[1:05:18] keeping the Sabbath but also the land
[1:05:21] would have to keep a
[1:05:23] Sabbath sir six years Thou shalt seow
[1:05:27] thy
[1:05:28] field six years Thou shalt prune thy
[1:05:32] Vineyard and gather in the fruit
[1:05:35] thereof but in the seventh year shall be
[1:05:40] a Sabbath of rest unto the
[1:05:43] land a Sabbath for the Lord Thou shalt
[1:05:47] neither sow thy field nor prune thy
[1:05:51] Vineyard you wouldn't even work during
[1:05:53] this year

[1:05:58] of thy Harvest Thou shalt not reap

[1:06:06] the Lord I'm sorry unto the land and the
[1:06:10] Sabbath of the land shall be meat for
[1:06:14] you for thee and for thy servant and for
[1:06:18] thy maid and for thy hired servant and
[1:06:21] for thy stranger that sojourneth with
[1:06:23] thee and for thy cattle and for the
[1:06:26] beasts that are in thy land shall all
[1:06:30] the increase thereof be meat and thou
[1:06:34] shalt number seven sabbaths of years
[1:06:39] unto thee seven times seven years and
[1:06:43] the space of the uh of the seven
[1:06:47] sabbaths of years shall be unto thee 4
[1:06:50] and9
[1:06:52] years then shalt thou cause the Trum ET

[1:07:18] jubilee unto you and ye shall return
[1:07:21] unto every man uh uh and ye shall return
[1:07:25] every man unto his possession and ye

[1:07:31] and Jubilee shall a jubilee shall that
[1:07:34] 50th year be unto you ye shall not sow
[1:07:38] neither reap that which groweth of
[1:07:40] itself in it nor gather the grapes in it
[1:07:43] of thy Vine undressed for it is the
[1:07:48] Jubilee it shall be holy unto you ye
[1:07:52] shall eat the increase thereof out of
[1:07:54] the field in the Year of
[1:07:57] Jubilee uh ye shall return every man
[1:08:01] unto his
[1:08:03] possession amen so just a little context
[1:08:07] of scripture here uh for us as we talk
[1:08:09] about Jubilee year and as I said I know
[1:08:12] I won't finish this talk but we will get
[1:08:15] started Amen in this journey I want to
[1:08:18] take um to a opening quote from a sermon
[1:08:22] that the prophet preached and his title
[1:08:25] was
[1:08:26] Jubilee
[1:08:27] year amen let's take a quote from there
[1:08:31] and he makes a couple comments a
[1:08:34] statement here he says and these
[1:08:36] scriptures tonight that we read in
[1:08:40] here uh are fulfilled again in the days
[1:08:44] of the Gentiles they have eyes but they
[1:08:47] can't see they have ears but they can't
[1:08:51] hear and God is doing Miracles and signs
[1:08:55] and wonders and people are just simply
[1:08:58] closing their eyes to it because the
[1:09:00] prophecy has said it would be that way
[1:09:03] it says now Jesus was prophesied by uh
[1:09:08] Isaiah to preach the acceptable year we
[1:09:11] just read that in Isaiah 61 he says he
[1:09:14] was prophesied to preach the acceptable
[1:09:17] year that's what we want to deal on on
[1:09:20] tonight now the acceptable year was this
[1:09:24] that uh enduring the time between so
[1:09:26] many years acceptable year is the year
[1:09:29] called in the old writings the Year of
[1:09:32] Jubilee He says they come uh he says I
[1:09:35] believe was either every every every
[1:09:37] seven years was a jubilee year he says
[1:09:40] every seven years they let the ground
[1:09:43] rest they grow no fruit on it or planted
[1:09:46] no crops they let uh their crops in the
[1:09:48] field rest every seven years and that
[1:09:52] and at that time was a jubilee now
[1:09:56] um I want to just um mention that um
[1:10:01] that's a prophetic definition of Jubilee
[1:10:05] Praise God and there are many
[1:10:07] definitions that we could take I'm going
[1:10:09] to read some of them uh to you but some
[1:10:12] of the theologians would argue and they
[1:10:15] would say that the Jubilee year is
[1:10:17] actually the 50th year seven sabbaths uh
[1:10:20] he talked about and and then it says the
[1:10:22] 50th year would be a year Jubilee but
[1:10:24] what brother brandom just showed us that
[1:10:27] every s years of Jubilee would happen
[1:10:29] right and not and and and and I believe
[1:10:31] he's tying this into another scripture
[1:10:33] which we won't take time to read uh
[1:10:36] maybe we can maybe we got time to read
[1:10:38] it um Exodus 21 amen Exodus 21 uh these
[1:10:43] are prophetic definitions and I I
[1:10:47] appreciate prophetic definitions not
[1:10:49] just the theological definitions but
[1:10:51] prophetic but here in Exodus 21 we see
[1:10:55] um we see I I believe where brother
[1:10:58] brandom's kind of bringing this thought
[1:10:59] together and and I would just also just
[1:11:02] mention uh when I think about Jubilee
[1:11:05] Jubilee is a
[1:11:07] release amen a jubilee is not just a 50e
[1:11:11] celebration but a jubilee is when
[1:11:13] something has been released something
[1:11:15] has been set free glory to God Amen that
[1:11:20] that's when a real Jubilee is taking
[1:11:22] place and and brother brandom has some I
[1:11:24] mean I believe tying some things to
[1:11:26] scripture uh and his thought process and
[1:11:29] and even when he preached the message
[1:11:30] Jubilee year I was listening to it
[1:11:31] yesterday and I mean he came to the pull
[1:11:34] pit saying he didn't really have
[1:11:35] anything to preach but he came out and
[1:11:37] preached Jubilee year with nothing to
[1:11:40] preach praise God I I thank God for a
[1:11:43] prophet yes sir amen but here in in in
[1:11:45] uh Exodus 21 says now these are the
[1:11:48] judgments which Thou shalt set before
[1:11:51] them if thou buy an Hebrew servant six
[1:11:56] years He Shall Serve and in the seventh
[1:11:59] he shall go out free for nothing all
[1:12:02] right so now this is a human being being
[1:12:05] released Amen in the seventh year the
[1:12:07] land had to rest for six years and then
[1:12:10] the seventh year was was was I'm sorry
[1:12:12] they worked the land for six years but
[1:12:14] the seventh seventh year it was it was
[1:12:16] time for rest Hallelujah it was it was a
[1:12:19] release glory to God and it says now um
[1:12:22] verse three says if he came in by
[1:12:25] himself he shall go out by himself if he
[1:12:29] were married then his wife shall go out
[1:12:32] with him if his master have given him a
[1:12:35] wife and she have borne him Sons or
[1:12:38] daughters the wife and her children
[1:12:42] shall be her Masters and he shall go out
[1:12:44] by himself all right it says and if the
[1:12:47] servant shall plainly say I love my
[1:12:50] master my wife and my children I will
[1:12:53] not go out free
[1:12:56] my God says then his master shall bring
[1:12:59] him unto the judges he shall also bring
[1:13:02] him to the door and unto the doorpost
[1:13:05] and his master shall bore his ear
[1:13:08] through with an A and he shall serve him
[1:13:11] forever you know and and I thought about
[1:13:13] that I said you know this man uh first
[1:13:16] he gets trapped into a situation maybe
[1:13:19] through uh uh his finances are kind out
[1:13:22] of control and he he's indebted and he
[1:13:24] has to sell him self to be become a
[1:13:26] slave to somebody else but God
[1:13:28] orchestrated a plan he put a plan in
[1:13:31] place that if a man got on Hard Times
[1:13:33] there was a way out he didn't have to
[1:13:36] live in that condition for the rest of
[1:13:38] his life there was a way this man could
[1:13:40] come out because every every seven years
[1:13:43] by law the man would have to come out of
[1:13:46] that condition glory to God now now
[1:13:50] here's the thing you know if a man saw
[1:13:52] himself in in that in that situation and
[1:13:55] he went in with his wife the seventh
[1:13:57] year his wife could be released with him
[1:13:59] but if he got married while he was in
[1:14:02] that situation amen uh if he got he got
[1:14:04] married to one of the another slave then
[1:14:07] that slave amen would have to stay there
[1:14:09] that woman would have to stay there with
[1:14:11] her children with that Master and that
[1:14:13] man could go free however that man
[1:14:15] decided I want to stay with my wife I
[1:14:18] want to stay with my children I want to
[1:14:20] stay with my MK if that man decided to
[1:14:22] do that then he became a slave for the
[1:14:24] rest of his life now now I want you to
[1:14:26] get this the man would only make a
[1:14:28] decision like that if he thought things
[1:14:30] were better for him he man been actually
[1:14:33] being
[1:14:34] free on and I I want to I want you to
[1:14:38] get this if the man thought that
[1:14:40] condition of bondage was better than
[1:14:43] freedom than the man was stay in
[1:14:46] bondage and the only reason the man was
[1:14:48] stay in bondage because maybe for the
[1:14:50] first six years the the the the his
[1:14:52] owner treated him with with wrong like
[1:14:55] royalty but he does not understand when
[1:14:57] he makes a deal to go before the public
[1:15:00] and have his ear Bor with an awe the
[1:15:04] masc could change everything about how
[1:15:07] he was treating that man and he would be
[1:15:09] bound to him for the rest of his
[1:15:12] life I want to tell you something don't
[1:15:15] you make no agreement with the
[1:15:18] devil I don't care how the devil might
[1:15:21] be treating you right now don't you a no
[1:15:25] agreements with the devil because things
[1:15:28] will
[1:15:31] [Music]
[1:15:33] change you can find yourself Bound for
[1:15:36] the rest of your
[1:15:38] [Applause]
[1:15:41] life the prophet told us that every
[1:15:43] seven years they let the ground rest
[1:15:45] they grow no fruit on it nor planted
[1:15:48] crops they let the crops in the field
[1:15:50] rest every seven years and at that time
[1:15:53] it was a jubilee so when I think of
[1:15:55] Jubilee I think of Freedom right I think
[1:15:58] of release it's not just 50 years that's
[1:16:01] not what we're talking about I think of
[1:16:03] emancipation I think of Liberty amen and
[1:16:06] and and I was just looking amen at some
[1:16:09] famous
[1:16:10] quotes of people that said things about
[1:16:13] Liberty or about Freedom just wanted to
[1:16:15] read to you a couple things Benjamin
[1:16:18] Franklin made a statement he says
[1:16:22] whoever would overthrow the Liberty of a
[1:16:26] Nation must begin by subduing the
[1:16:30] freeness of
[1:16:33] speech I want to drop that on you again
[1:16:35] Benjamin
[1:16:36] Franklin told us whoever would overthrow
[1:16:40] the liberty of a Nation must begin by
[1:16:44] subduing the freeness of
[1:16:47] speech that's the truth amen John F
[1:16:50] Kennedy made a statement he says let
[1:16:52] every nation
[1:16:53] know whether it wishes us well or ill it
[1:16:58] says that we shall pay any price come on
[1:17:01] bear any burden meet any hardship
[1:17:05] support any friend oppose any foe to
[1:17:09] assure the survival and the success of
[1:17:12] Liberty
[1:17:13] amen praise God Harriet Tubman she says
[1:17:18] I would fight for my Liberty so long as
[1:17:22] my strength lasted and if the time
[1:17:25] uh came for me to go the Lord will let
[1:17:28] let them take
[1:17:31] me Thomas
[1:17:33] Jefferson he said we hold these
[1:17:37] truths to be
[1:17:39] self-evident that all men are created
[1:17:42] equal that they are endowed by their
[1:17:45] creator with certain inalienable
[1:17:48] rights among th among these are life
[1:17:51] liberty and the pursuit of happiness
[1:17:54] that to secure these rights governments
[1:17:57] are instituted among men now now when
[1:18:00] you use that word in aable that's a part
[1:18:02] of our constitution I just thought of a
[1:18:04] little quote here that brother brandham
[1:18:06] used that same word in because you know
[1:18:09] when you think about in alen in
[1:18:10] inalienable it means it's unable to be
[1:18:13] taken
[1:18:14] away
[1:18:16] amen amen and it it can't be given away
[1:18:20] by the possessor they cannot take it
[1:18:23] from you freedom is something the devil
[1:18:25] can't take from
[1:18:27] you glory to God and brother brandham
[1:18:30] said something in the Ephesian Church
[1:18:31] age he says uh what the church had at
[1:18:36] Pentecost glory to God is her
[1:18:39] inalienable right that mean what what
[1:18:42] what the church received at Pentecost is
[1:18:44] something that can never be taken away
[1:18:47] let me tell you something you can't
[1:18:48] preach it out of the
[1:18:50] church you can't pray it out of the
[1:18:52] church what God gave the church at
[1:18:56] Pentecost is supposed to still be
[1:18:59] there he saids what the church had at
[1:19:01] Pentecost is her inalienable right
[1:19:04] originally she had the pure word of God
[1:19:07] she had the power of the spirit
[1:19:09] manifested and divver signs and wonders
[1:19:12] and Gifts of the Holy Ghost if they had
[1:19:15] it then we have it now glory to God we
[1:19:17] won't let it go another statement here
[1:19:20] another quote uh on Liberty and freedom
[1:19:23] Patrick Henry
[1:19:25] said Give me liberty give me death or
[1:19:28] give me death amen brother random
[1:19:31] preached about Arnold Von Winkle Reed
[1:19:34] and he uh he made a statement he says
[1:19:36] Make
[1:19:37] Way for
[1:19:39] Liberty Hallelujah all these famous
[1:19:42] statements and amen Martin Luther King
[1:19:44] made a statement he said free at
[1:19:47] last free at last thank God Almighty we
[1:19:51] are free at last amen but greater than
[1:19:55] any of these our lord Jesus made some
[1:19:58] statements about Liberty one of those in
[1:20:01] Isaiah 61 says Proclaim Liberty to the
[1:20:06] captives also we'll find that same amen
[1:20:09] writing over in Luke 4:18 which we'll
[1:20:12] read a little bit later but it says to
[1:20:14] set at Liberty them that are
[1:20:16] bruised and I thought about you know now
[1:20:19] how did Jesus do this how did Jesus
[1:20:22] Proclaim Liberty to those that were cast
[1:20:24] of how did he set at Liberty those that
[1:20:27] were bruised and you know you go back in
[1:20:30] Amen in scripture and we can see
[1:20:31] different ones that uh that needed
[1:20:34] Liberty amen God made a way for people
[1:20:37] to get out of situations that were they
[1:20:38] were in one was the woman that was
[1:20:40] caught in
[1:20:41] adultery right now now now now now now
[1:20:44] now Jesus did not deny that the lady was
[1:20:46] not in adultery amen it's just the way
[1:20:49] that he handled it his job was to
[1:20:51] Proclaim Liberty some people are caught
[1:20:53] in situations that they really don't
[1:20:55] want to be in Hallelujah and when this
[1:20:58] woman come amen they cast her at his
[1:21:01] feet had the rocks in their hand ready
[1:21:03] to Stone this lady to death they say
[1:21:05] what do you say he begin to just write
[1:21:07] in the sand and they had no idea what he
[1:21:09] was writing but he rose up and he spoke
[1:21:11] one word he that's without
[1:21:14] sin that's right let him cast the first
[1:21:17] stone and all the Rocks begin to
[1:21:20] drop everybody walked away and Jesus
[1:21:23] asked says woman where your
[1:21:25] accusers says I have not said I don't
[1:21:28] accuse you either said but go no and
[1:21:31] send no more amen he set her
[1:21:35] free another uh situation that we find
[1:21:38] amen is the man at the pool of Bethesda
[1:21:41] sat in that condition for 38 years but
[1:21:44] when Jesus walked up to said will you be
[1:21:46] made whole this was a man that needed a
[1:21:50] jubilee in his body he needed a jubilee
[1:21:54] here we also have a man Legion with
[1:21:56] 2,000 Demons Inside of him Jesus set
[1:22:00] that man at Liberty yes the woman at the
[1:22:03] well was set at Liberty many different
[1:22:06] situations we can look in the scripture
[1:22:08] and see what Jesus did exactly what he
[1:22:11] said he was going to do Jesus also said
[1:22:13] if the son therefore shall make you free
[1:22:19] then you shall be
[1:22:20] free indeed another statement that Jesus
[1:22:24] said in John 8:32 says and ye shall know
[1:22:27] the
[1:22:29] truth and the truth shall make you
[1:22:34] free I pray I pray to God that people
[1:22:36] hear the truth through the sermon that
[1:22:39] God has given them today Jubilee year
[1:22:42] amen we look at some other definitions
[1:22:44] of this word Jubilee I just pulled it up
[1:22:48] Amen on on the computer and just grabb
[1:22:51] the a couple definitions and one said
[1:22:54] amen a special anniversary of an event
[1:22:57] remember a prophetic definition amen
[1:23:00] kind of pulls us more towards a release
[1:23:03] amen but here amen uh uh uh here here
[1:23:06] they got a special anniversary of an
[1:23:08] event especially one celebrating 25 or
[1:23:11] 50 years of rign or activity amen they
[1:23:15] would call it a jubilee celebration all
[1:23:18] right uh sometimes in in marriage you
[1:23:20] get to 50 years it's a jubilee year in
[1:23:22] your marriage or or even 20 5 years they
[1:23:25] would call it a jubilee year but but
[1:23:27] here you know again that that's these
[1:23:29] are these are nomenal amen definitions
[1:23:31] that I want to give you but but I want
[1:23:33] you to watch some of the connections
[1:23:35] here also in Judaism they said in Jewish
[1:23:38] history a year of emancipation and
[1:23:42] restoration established every 50 years
[1:23:45] so that was a jubilee to in in in
[1:23:47] Judaism also in
[1:23:50] Catholicism amen they have what they
[1:23:52] call a full Jubilee year it's a period
[1:23:55] of remission from the penal consequences

[1:26:48] uh a couple couple more definitions here
[1:26:51] but let me give you a quote out of R
[1:26:53] return and Jubilee brother brandom says
[1:26:55] something to us says now if
[1:26:59] someone or other the individual lost
[1:27:02] their inheritance that was given to them
[1:27:05] by God there come a year called The
[1:27:08] Jubilee Year and that was every seven
[1:27:11] years they had rest a Sabbath every
[1:27:13] seven days they had a Sabbath every
[1:27:16] seven years they had a Sabbath and and
[1:27:19] seven sabbaths was 49 years and the 50th
[1:27:22] year was a jubilee
[1:27:24] says and in this Jubilee every man that
[1:27:27] had lost his inheritance by some means
[1:27:31] if he was a Freeborn and a true blooded
[1:27:34] Israelite no matter who held the
[1:27:36] possession it had to go back to him free
[1:27:40] praise God he didn't have to pay a thing
[1:27:43] amen he didn't have to do a thing my God
[1:27:47] but just stop what he was doing and go
[1:27:50] back to his inheritance he didn't have
[1:27:52] to pay a thing he have to do a thing but
[1:27:55] what he need to do is stop what he was
[1:27:57] doing and go back to his
[1:28:01] inheritance you talk about a
[1:28:04] restoration Hallelujah he says Oh my he
[1:28:07] had a right to it it was a god-given
[1:28:11] right because he by Grace had inherited
[1:28:14] it and would be given to his fathers and
[1:28:17] handed down year after year no matter
[1:28:20] what had taken place if he lost it it
[1:28:22] must go free
[1:28:24] amen I thank God for that it meant Grace
[1:28:29] is uh Grace is is a way provided for
[1:28:31] each individual to return to their
[1:28:34] rightful inheritance watch this what a
[1:28:37] picture it gives us tonight of the
[1:28:39] church in this last day you see what man
[1:28:41] can do and then you see what God does
[1:28:44] What man does is failing and will fail
[1:28:47] has failed and always will fail but what
[1:28:49] God does is eternal and must forever
[1:28:51] remain nothing can ever take it away
[1:28:54] okay God give it is his free gift and by
[1:28:57] Sovereign foresight saw it and placed it
[1:29:00] and there's nothing can ever move it
[1:29:02] it's inalienable nothing can ever move
[1:29:05] it it's there eternally and that Jubilee
[1:29:08] was God's
[1:29:09] Mana of expressing Grace to his
[1:29:14] people you know this this to me he says
[1:29:16] God's God's man of expressing Grace to
[1:29:19] his people for restoring or be brought
[1:29:22] back to their rightful position so when
[1:29:24] a jubilee trumpet sounds it is the grace
[1:29:27] of God coming directly to you to bring
[1:29:31] you back to the place where you're
[1:29:33] supposed to be oh Hallelujah it does not
[1:29:37] matter how you lost your
[1:29:40] [Applause]
[1:29:43] status it does not matter how long
[1:29:45] you've been lost in that condition when
[1:29:49] a jubilee trumpet sounds a gospel Ju
[1:29:54] believe trumpet sounds it goes beyond
[1:29:57] all the mistakes that you make it goes
[1:30:00] beyond your failures it goes beyond
[1:30:03] anything you ever did or ever could do
[1:30:07] you can't restore yourself but the grace
[1:30:10] of God is more than able to restore you
[1:30:15] to your rightful
[1:30:17] position Hallelujah glory to
[1:30:21] God Amen I'm talking about if you ever
[1:30:23] been a real believer and somehow you

[1:30:28] Israelite was born an Israelite but lost
[1:30:31] their their their their land lost
[1:30:33] everything but God had established by
[1:30:38] law when the priest come and blow the

[1:33:12] [Applause]
[1:33:14] free I'm giving you another some other
[1:33:17] definitions here of this
[1:33:18] Jubilee here in uh I I have a a Bible
[1:33:22] amen uh dictionary at home the zandan
[1:33:26] handbook to the Bible and and they were
[1:33:29] uh reading uh they were just giv a
[1:33:32] definition on this on this Jubilee and
[1:33:34] and they were referring to Leviticus
[1:33:37] 25 they were actually given a breakdown
[1:33:39] of of Leviticus 25 and um it says this
[1:33:43] chapter looks forward to the time when
[1:33:45] the nation will occupy the promised land
[1:33:48] now so they they were in bondage uh then
[1:33:51] left Egypt going through the Wilderness
[1:33:52] and now they getting ready to go to to
[1:33:53] the promised land and when they get to
[1:33:54] the promised land God has given them law
[1:33:57] to establish for the promised land now
[1:33:59] can you imagine that yeah yeah I hope we
[1:34:02] I hope we get this before they even got
[1:34:05] to the promised land God had already
[1:34:08] established law to First protect them
[1:34:12] when they were in the promised land if
[1:34:14] you find yourself in bondage this law in
[1:34:17] Exodus is going to release you right yes
[1:34:20] the land itself I'm going to put a
[1:34:23] Sabbath on the land itself so I want I
[1:34:26] want the I want the land to continue to
[1:34:28] produce for you and we're going to need
[1:34:30] to have to we have to give in the
[1:34:31] seventh year we got to give the land
[1:34:32] rest so God had if I can just put it
[1:34:34] this way God had already thought
[1:34:38] aead can I tell y'all something if God
[1:34:42] already thought a head for
[1:34:46] [Applause]
[1:34:49] land I can tell you this you are more
[1:34:51] important than land
[1:34:54] and if God had already thought a head
[1:34:56] for land God has also thought a head for
[1:35:00] [Music]
[1:35:01] you amen here in the zandan handbook to
[1:35:04] the Bible says this chapter looks
[1:35:05] forward to the time when the nation will
[1:35:07] occupy the promised land the pattern of
[1:35:10] sevens reflected in the festivals now
[1:35:13] now now they're referring to festivals
[1:35:15] which is amen these different feasts and
[1:35:18] so that said the pattern of seven
[1:35:19] reflected in the festivals and and I
[1:35:21] don't have time to to hit all this but I
[1:35:24] I am going to come back to it uh the
[1:35:26] pattern of seven reflected in the
[1:35:28] festivals chapter 23 the Leviticus 23 is
[1:35:31] extended to the land one year and seven
[1:35:33] is the LIE phow one year and seven is
[1:35:38] the LI lie fow which means to be left
[1:35:41] unsown uh in order it's it's to be left
[1:35:44] unsown for a period in order to restore
[1:35:46] its
[1:35:48] [Music]
[1:35:49] fertility can I I I'm going just try to
[1:35:53] break this down down goad even the land
[1:35:56] going to be
[1:36:04] restored you you you you know we're in
[1:36:06] this journey through restoration this is
[1:36:08] connected all to to our journey and and
[1:36:10] and and and and the other thing you know
[1:36:12] at the beginning of the last year our
[1:36:14] our theme was get back in step and uh
[1:36:17] with the inspiration of of our restore
[1:36:19] sayth the Lord with that that that theme
[1:36:21] has carried over into this year and
[1:36:24] being that the them carried over into
[1:36:26] this year we got a second level of
[1:36:29] inspiration and that is the year of
[1:36:34] overflow yes
[1:36:35] sir the land itself would go through
[1:36:40] restoration every seven years amen watch
[1:36:44] this it says um so so so so they said
[1:36:47] the pattern of seven is reflected in the
[1:36:49] festival so the the festivals was the
[1:36:51] Feast of Passover the Feast of unle
[1:36:53] bread and that Feast of unle bread is
[1:36:56] something that happens in the months of
[1:36:57] March to April for for uh for for for
[1:37:00] the Jewish people uh also the Feast of
[1:37:03] first fruits that usually happens in
[1:37:05] April the Feast of Weeks which is also
[1:37:08] called a feast of
[1:37:09] Pentecost uh that happens typically in
[1:37:11] June the Feast of trumpets amen is a new
[1:37:15] year festival and and the first of three
[1:37:18] festivals in the seventh month which
[1:37:20] that happens in September to October
[1:37:22] time frame and then then you know some
[1:37:24] of those those other things that happen
[1:37:25] underneath Feast of trumpets is the day
[1:37:27] of atonement and the last Feast is the
[1:37:29] Feast of
[1:37:30] Tabernacles Hallelujah and the Feast of
[1:37:32] Tabernacles is a a Perpetual reminder of
[1:37:34] the nation's tent dwelling days when
[1:37:36] Israel had to dwell in tents what what I
[1:37:39] what I have a desire to do is go back
[1:37:40] and kind of break down those feasts
[1:37:42] because I think it's going to be very
[1:37:43] important but today we can't do all of
[1:37:45] that I'm just giving you amen some some
[1:37:48] some Cliff
[1:37:49] Notes also a continuation of the zandan
[1:37:52] hand book to the Bible they say the 50th
[1:37:55] year following the 7th seven say is an
[1:37:59] extra phow year right where nothing is
[1:38:03] swn in order for the land to be restored
[1:38:05] nothing is swn during that F year it's
[1:38:07] an extra fall year for the land which
[1:38:09] reverts Amen to its original owner it's
[1:38:12] a time when those who have fallen on bad
[1:38:15] times have their freedom and their
[1:38:17] property restored the Jubilee the year
[1:38:21] restoration that's what they put in
[1:38:23] there Jubilee is the year restoration
[1:38:26] and it serves a dual purpose and they
[1:38:29] said It reminds the people that the land
[1:38:31] belongs to God and it prevents the
[1:38:33] wealthy from amassing Land oh my now I
[1:38:38] like I like I like these definitions
[1:38:41] amen that they give us
[1:38:44] uh oh Lord I'm I'm trying my best not to
[1:38:47] get ahead of myself but it it is just uh
[1:38:51] it is so hard it is so hard I and I I

[1:39:15] year was a Year of Jubilee
[1:39:18] uh people return back to their
[1:39:20] possessions
[1:39:22] and they have freedom
[1:39:25] again but there was something else that
[1:39:27] happened now remember they were told not
[1:39:29] to

[1:40:24] it
[1:40:26] says ye shall not therefore oppress one
[1:40:30] another but Thou shalt fear thy God for
[1:40:34] I am the Lord your God wherefore ye
[1:40:37] shall do my statutes and keep my
[1:40:39] judgments and do them and ye shall dwell

[1:42:25] stealing the devil did not have to just
[1:42:27] return what he stole or the thief did
[1:42:30] not just have return what they stole
[1:42:31] they had to restore double that means
[1:42:34] you got a overflow when somebody stole
[1:42:36] something from you and if you caught
[1:42:39] them we have caught the devil
[1:42:45] stealing we know that that we don't

[1:43:18] somebody in the world I'm taking my
[1:43:20] daughter and I'm taking him I'm taking
[1:43:27] double I'm not settling just for getting
[1:43:30] that one back I want to praise
[1:43:34] God I told you our God does not subtract
[1:43:38] Our God adds and he multiplies
[1:43:43] [Applause]
[1:43:53] yes my Lord I I I I'm I'm under
[1:43:56] expectation the sixth year in the sixth
[1:44:00] year if they were obedient in the sixth
[1:44:03] year they were supposed to experience an
[1:44:07] overflow I mean you look at them crops

[1:47:12] our rightful position in
[1:47:14] Christ and uh but but when it talk

[1:48:23] problems and the government released a
[1:48:25] lot of big companies from
[1:48:28] debt in order to keep them
[1:48:31] afloat right now now if they do that for
[1:48:33] the companies why not do it for the
[1:48:35] people that work for the
[1:48:37] companies oh my so I'm just saying if
[1:48:40] they want to release me from my house

[1:49:03] death I was grateful for that am
[1:49:06] grateful for that am amen I only had

[1:49:20] me a jubilee is a grand National
[1:49:23] Festival of Israel held every 50 year it

[1:49:30] and all prisoners and slaves were
[1:49:33] liberated and when all lands and Estates
[1:49:36] whether they had been sold or mortgaged
[1:49:38] were restored to their original
[1:49:40] possessors the joyful event was
[1:49:42] proclaimed by the sound of the trumpet
[1:49:45] in the evening of the day of atonement
[1:49:47] that the rich might not be unwilling to
[1:49:49] surrender the property of others nor the
[1:49:51] injured to for forgive those who had
[1:49:54] offended so even in the year
[1:49:57] release oh let's let's just work with
[1:49:59] that for a little bit the
[1:50:02] injured would have to forgive those who
[1:50:05] had

[1:53:27] Freedom um it says uh this joyful event
[1:53:32] was proclaimed this is from key to the
[1:53:34] Bible it was proclaimed by the sound of
[1:53:35] the trumpet in the evening of the day of
[1:53:37] atonement that the rich might not be
[1:53:39] unwilling to surrender the property of
[1:53:41] others nor the injured to forgive those
[1:53:44] who had
[1:53:45] offended while they all have been
[1:53:48] imploring the pardoning mercy of God
[1:53:53] I want to go back to a quote here out of
[1:53:55] restoration of the Bride tree this is
[1:53:57] where our inspiration has come amen for
[1:54:00] this hour restore sayith the
[1:54:03] Lord
[1:54:05] um brother
[1:54:08] random uh makes a statement here about
[1:54:12] enforcing
[1:54:15] and he says
[1:54:19] enforce cuz this this was this was a
[1:54:21] this this Jubilee was a year of release
[1:54:23] release from deaths prisoners slaves uh
[1:54:26] everybody was liberated the lamb was
[1:54:28] liberated everything was liberated he
[1:54:31] says enforce there uh then we are we
[1:54:33] have the privilege to enforce upon
[1:54:37] Satan the claims that God give
[1:54:42] us and and you just ask us what what has
[1:54:44] God given you that the devil oh has
[1:54:50] taken what is God giving you that the is
[1:54:52] taken well there comes a time where you
[1:54:54] can rise up and and remember I I I I
[1:54:57] shared this remember the the woman um
[1:55:01] that had left her land in the the days
[1:55:04] of the Prophet Elijah I believe yeah and
[1:55:07] she had left her land right and uh she
[1:55:10] was gone because famine was in the land
[1:55:12] I think for about seven years well she
[1:55:13] left her property and and by the time
[1:55:16] she got back there were people in that
[1:55:18] property but it was
[1:55:20] hers so when she comes Amen to the king
[1:55:24] to request that she goes that she can
[1:55:27] get her property back uh the the the
[1:55:29] king had just been hearing
[1:55:32] testimonies and in the testimony service
[1:55:34] he said please tell us tell me some of
[1:55:36] these uh these Miracles that happened
[1:55:38] under Elisha's Ministry oh he did this
[1:55:40] and he did that and he prayed for This
[1:55:42] Woman's child and the child raised up
[1:55:44] from the dead and you know so so many
[1:55:46] precious Miracles that that that that he
[1:55:48] did when when while the testimony
[1:55:50] service was happening the lady coming
[1:55:52] back after 7 years being away her timing
[1:55:56] was absolutely perfect Jesus she comes
[1:56:01] back at that time while the testimony
[1:56:03] service is going on and and and and and
[1:56:05] the servant looks at her say King this
[1:56:08] is the woman right here that I just told
[1:56:10] you about that's now this is the one I
[1:56:13] mean she this is a living testimony her
[1:56:16] in a son she said King I'm just here to
[1:56:19] say yeah maybe maybe she shared her own
[1:56:21] version of testimony to say but I'm I'm
[1:56:23] here for a reason not just to share my
[1:56:24] testimony and now I need something I
[1:56:26] need my
[1:56:29] property I need my property and the King
[1:56:32] said I tell you what you're going to get
[1:56:34] your property and I am going to send a
[1:56:37] guard with you I'm sending a soldier
[1:56:41] with you to make sure you get back your
[1:56:46] property
[1:56:47] Hallelujah the and what it's pretty much
[1:56:50] saying is that if anybody on your land
[1:56:53] you ain't got to
[1:56:58] fight you just show up and you make your
[1:57:02] claim Hallelujah when you show up and
[1:57:04] make your claim the
[1:57:07] enforcer the the the the security guard
[1:57:11] the police officer whatever you want to
[1:57:14] call them the enforcers there to make
[1:57:16] sure you get what belongs to
[1:57:19] you and brother bandam tells us us he
[1:57:23] says
[1:57:24] enforce we have the privilege to enforce
[1:57:27] upon Satan the claims that God give us
[1:57:32] for God has a
[1:57:34] law and his word is a law and God uh in
[1:57:38] this word made certain claim to the
[1:57:40] church therefore we have a right to
[1:57:43] force these claims upon Satan and say
[1:57:46] give it
[1:57:48] back Glory I like that
[1:57:52] you can just feel the inspiration
[1:57:54] hitting the prophet you have a right to

[1:59:13] it the law of the land is to enforce is
[1:59:15] B land for the land but the law of the
[1:59:18] spirit of God is to force Satan yeah to
[1:59:21] give up that which he has
[1:59:24] unrightfully
[1:59:26] deceitfully taken from God Amen Souls of
[1:59:30] men he took from God Souls of women
[1:59:35] children sickness of the body he placed
[1:59:38] upon people where where where God Made
[1:59:40] Them In His Image to be like him and the
[1:59:42] church is given the rightful legal
[1:59:45] rights by the Bible to take the Holy
[1:59:48] Spirit and enforce this upon them
[1:59:53] yeah thank God I'm not going to live

[1:59:59] privileges amen I'm not living beneath
[2:00:01] my privileges amen amen I'm claiming
[2:00:05] everything amen thank you Lord the key
[2:00:08] to the Bible definition of Jubilee
[2:00:11] continues it says the Jubilee had a
[2:00:13] two-fold
[2:00:15] design it was political and it was
[2:00:18] typical is what they have in a
[2:00:20] definition and the political says it's
[2:00:22] to prevent oppression of the poor and
[2:00:25] Perpetual servitude that a kind of
[2:00:28] equality might be preserved in the
[2:00:30] families while the tribal distinctions
[2:00:32] were known it might be ascertained that
[2:00:34] the Messiah descended from the tribe of
[2:00:36] Judah the typical uh definition or a
[2:00:40] purpose was toe to predict the blessings
[2:00:43] of the New Covenant by which the liberty
[2:00:46] of the Gospel from sin and Satan and the
[2:00:49] salvation of Jesus Christ might be
[2:00:51] enjoyed with each eternal glory he says
[2:00:54] Isaiah alluded to the Jubilee of Israel
[2:00:56] and foretelling the ministry of the
[2:00:58] Messiah as his words were interpreted by
[2:01:00] our savior when we read in Isaiah 61
[2:01:03] verse 1-2 it told us what Jesus would do
[2:01:07] now we pick up Jesus in Luke chapter
[2:01:11] 4
[2:01:13] Jesus went to
[2:01:17] church and you know the Bible says it
[2:01:20] was customary right
[2:01:23] right for Jesus to go to church right
[2:01:29] amen if Jesus went to
[2:01:33] church why don't you go Amen to church
[2:01:37] amen the other thing that Jesus did not
[2:01:41] do Jesus didn't stay home the
[2:01:44] [Applause]
[2:01:47] stream Jesus got up church and went to
[2:01:51] church
[2:01:53] they saw him in
[2:01:55] church but this one day he goes to
[2:01:57] church in Luke
[2:02:02] 4 um
[2:02:05] verse
[2:02:08] 16 and he came to
[2:02:11] Nazareth where he had been brought up
[2:02:14] and as his custom
[2:02:18] was he went into the synagogue on the
[2:02:21] Sabbath day and stood up for to
[2:02:24] read and there was delivered unto him
[2:02:27] the book of the prophet Isaiah and when
[2:02:30] he had opened the book he found the
[2:02:31] place where it was written so Jesus they
[2:02:33] gave him the book he goes to church this
[2:02:35] day and he said why don't you to read a
[2:02:36] scripture for us and he opens up the
[2:02:39] book he finds Isaiah and goes right to
[2:02:41] Isaiah 61 and he begins to
[2:02:44] read and it says the spirit of the Lord
[2:02:47] is upon
[2:02:49] me because Heath anointed me to preach
[2:02:52] the gospel to the poor he have sent me
[2:02:56] to heal the
[2:02:58] brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to
[2:03:00] the captives and I love this part and
[2:03:03] recovering of sight to the blind amen
[2:03:06] now now when when when it says
[2:03:07] recovering of sight to the blind that
[2:03:10] means in the past this person has been
[2:03:14] able to
[2:03:16] see something has blocked their
[2:03:19] vision and and now not able to see the
[2:03:22] things they used to see right oh my we
[2:03:26] have a lot of people today in the
[2:03:28] message like that they have lost their
[2:03:32] sight right amen they they just don't
[2:03:35] they have they have they have questions
[2:03:36] about a lot of stuff in the message but
[2:03:38] but but look it's not the you know even
[2:03:40] brother brand say don't don't look at
[2:03:41] the message look at the
[2:03:43] [Music]
[2:03:44] message we we put a lot of attention on
[2:03:46] the messenger but we need to look at the
[2:03:48] message what was it that he said
[2:03:52] not not the man himself the man going to
[2:03:54] make mistakes just like you and I make
[2:03:56] mistakes that ain't got nothing to do
[2:03:57] with the message amen hallelujah glory
[2:04:00] to God often times what it is that
[2:04:03] people looking for the message to come
[2:04:04] through a perfect vessel no that's not
[2:04:06] the way that's not the way God operates
[2:04:08] even in even in Noah's day wasn't a
[2:04:10] perfect vessel right right but if you
[2:04:13] didn't get in the
[2:04:17] boat if you didn't get in the boat you
[2:04:19] were messed up you going to lose your
[2:04:22] life amen in in in Moses day was not a
[2:04:26] perfect
[2:04:27] vessel how do we know that Moses himself
[2:04:29] didn't even go into the promised land it
[2:04:31] was not a perfect
[2:04:34] vessel but if you didn't put blood over
[2:04:37] the door poost your son was dying
[2:04:41] firstborn son so we're not looking for
[2:04:42] perfect vessels there's only one perfect
[2:04:44] vessel his name is the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:04:47] amen but he did bring a perfect word
[2:04:50] amen
[2:04:51] just even by me preaching Jubilee amen
[2:04:54] again you go to the average Church they
[2:04:55] would take it only at the 50th year I'm
[2:04:58] taking it to a time of release because
[2:05:00] that's what brother Brandon brought us
[2:05:02] every seven years so Denny and I got the
[2:05:05] quote here anytime you hear the gospel
[2:05:07] trumpet sound amen it's a time of
[2:05:09] Jubilee for you amen I'm telling you you
[2:05:12] ain't got to wait seven years on you
[2:05:15] ain't got to wait 50 years you ain't got
[2:05:18] to wait 7
[2:05:19] Minutes amen amen
[2:05:22] I'mma take it even a little further down
[2:05:23] you ain't even got to wait 7 Seconds you
[2:05:26] can go free right now because you heard
[2:05:29] the gospel trumpet
[2:05:31] sound amen amen amen oh my my my
[2:05:37] my I'm I I got to keep going he wants to
[2:05:40] recover the sight amen of the blind he
[2:05:45] also says to set at
[2:05:47] Liberty them that that are bruised and
[2:05:49] as I as I was just mentioning earlier
[2:05:52] when you think about the the bruise the
[2:05:54] bruise is something that happens on the
[2:05:56] inside of your body and then it
[2:05:58] manifests on the outside amen like if
[2:06:02] you were to
[2:06:04] uh there was a a table of something and
[2:06:08] you happen to walk by it didn't see it
[2:06:09] and you oh you hit it with that hited
[2:06:11] your leg or something like that that
[2:06:13] bruise going to happen on the
[2:06:15] inside and then all of a sudden on the
[2:06:17] outside you're going to see this little
[2:06:18] dark spot in your skin that that shows
[2:06:20] that there's a bruise
[2:06:22] and sometimes uh
[2:06:26] emotionally people actually get a
[2:06:28] bruised on the inside and then it
[2:06:31] reflects itself on the outside but what
[2:06:35] God what what the Lord Jesus came to do
[2:06:37] is actually set at
[2:06:39] Liberty those that have been bruised
[2:06:42] amen amen
[2:06:45] amen amen and then verse 19 says to
[2:06:49] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[2:06:52] Brother random tells us that that
[2:06:53] acceptable year is the Year of
[2:06:56] Jubilee and
[2:06:58] um I was just thinking to myself you
[2:07:01] know they said it was a two-fold purpose
[2:07:03] political and typical that's that's
[2:07:06] those are theological definitions that I
[2:07:08] read to you but uh I believe a jubilee
[2:07:10] is a
[2:07:11] restoration I believe a a a jubilee amen
[2:07:15] has more than a two-fold purpose and
[2:07:17] earlier Amen in our journey here and get
[2:07:20] back and step we
[2:07:22] um uh we looked at the inspiration I
[2:07:24] will restore sayth the Lord and I said
[2:07:26] at that time and I'm saying it again a
[2:07:28] restoration can mean different things to
[2:07:31] different
[2:07:33] people it can mean Restoration in your
[2:07:35] health it can be Restoration in your
[2:07:38] family it can be Restoration in your
[2:07:40] business or your income it can be
[2:07:43] restoration of a prior position that you
[2:07:45] had that they took away from you right
[2:07:47] Hallelujah right it can be a restoration
[2:07:50] in an investment right amen it can be
[2:07:52] healing to your inner
[2:07:54] man amen let's let's just go back and
[2:07:58] just revisit some of that I'm running
[2:08:00] out of time here today but let me just
[2:08:02] give you let me let me give you uh a
[2:08:04] couple of these then I got one more
[2:08:05] quote to read and I'm going have to let
[2:08:06] it go but um Jeremiah 30:
[2:08:10] 17 restoration the Bible says for our
[2:08:14] restore Health unto thee and I will heal
[2:08:17] thee of thy
[2:08:19] wounds sayith the Lord because they call
[2:08:22] thee an outcast saying this is Zion whom
[2:08:24] no man seeketh after and and and I I
[2:08:27] just like that scripture let me just
[2:08:28] just hit it just for a little bit I'm
[2:08:30] going to heal you of your wounds and
[2:08:32] notice these wounds because they call
[2:08:35] [Music]
[2:08:38] thee because they called thee some of us
[2:08:41] need to go through healing on what other
[2:08:43] people have said about
[2:08:45] us and the Lord Jesus said I'm going to
[2:08:48] heal you of your wounds Hallelujah
[2:08:53] Jes Psalm 51: 11-12 this is healing to
[2:08:57] your inner man uh but David said cast me
[2:09:01] not away from thy presence and take not
[2:09:05] thy Holy Spirit from me and then he says
[2:09:08] this restore unto me the joy of thy
[2:09:14] salvation and uphold me with thy free
[2:09:17] spirit God amen amen
[2:09:21] restoration is to deliver back again and
[2:09:24] and they use a scripture out of Genesis
[2:09:25] 20 and 7 if you go back and you you pick
[2:09:29] that up this is uh uh uh ailec being
[2:09:33] told by almighty God Abraham can I can I
[2:09:37] just I'm going just have to I'm I'm
[2:09:39] getting ahead of myself but I'm going
[2:09:40] just say it this week because I don't
[2:09:42] know when I'm going get back to say it
[2:09:43] uh hopefully next week I can get back to
[2:09:45] say it but uh I told yall brother berley
[2:09:47] might be passing through so I don't know
[2:09:49] what'll happen next week but we'll see
[2:09:51] uh um but uh I I I want to say that um
[2:09:55] um
[2:09:57] Sarah needed a jubilee right sir amen
[2:10:03] and jubilees jubilees are needed for
[2:10:06] people that find themselves in
[2:10:08] situations that they don't know how to
[2:10:10] get out
[2:10:12] of they don't they they they they in
[2:10:15] bondage they have no they they don't
[2:10:17] have money to pay their way out of it
[2:10:19] they don't have a family member with
[2:10:21] money to get them out of it they are
[2:10:23] just
[2:10:24] stuck but God orchestrated that at every
[2:10:28] seven year I don't care if the man is in
[2:10:30] this condition him and his wife could be
[2:10:32] like this God orchestrated you got to
[2:10:35] release him and let him
[2:10:36] [Music]
[2:10:38] go Sarah and Abraham had told this lie
[2:10:43] that put Sarah in a really really bad
[2:10:46] spot yeah this
[2:10:49] lie caused Sarah to be taken from
[2:10:52] Abraham because she says he's my brother
[2:10:55] rather than saying that that's my wife
[2:10:57] and that's my husband said we're
[2:10:59] brothers and sisters and this
[2:11:01] lie uh caused Sarah to be taken into
[2:11:03] AMC's
[2:11:05] home AMC was thanking God for sending
[2:11:08] him a new
[2:11:11] wife and I told you there's many things
[2:11:13] in this story that we have to look at
[2:11:16] aimc had no idea right Sarah's never had
[2:11:19] a child m
[2:11:22] and as a king he would not marry a woman
[2:11:25] that was Barren right he has a purpose
[2:11:28] for marrying this woman I want to bring
[2:11:29] forth children from this woman but not
[2:11:31] knowing that this woman is a barren
[2:11:33] woman her body had been
[2:11:36] changed can I tell y'all something even
[2:11:39] though Abraham saw that the outside had
[2:11:42] been changed Sarah also noticed that the
[2:11:45] outside had been changed they did not
[2:11:48] connect the dots the inside had had also
[2:11:51] been changed before the
[2:11:54] outside so Abraham sells Sarah out and
[2:11:57] and Sarah goes along with the plan my
[2:11:59] God and they go and go down in the city
[2:12:02] and AMC say I got myself a new wife
[2:12:04] thank God for this new wife thank you I
[2:12:06] didn't even have to go look for her you
[2:12:07] brought her to me
[2:12:12] Lord God say AMC I know you're righteous
[2:12:15] man but don't you touch that man's wife
[2:12:18] amen he said wife the man told me and
[2:12:22] she said this they were brothers and
[2:12:23] sisters he said I know what they told
[2:12:25] you oh glory to God I know exactly what
[2:12:27] they told you but that is that man's
[2:12:29] wife give me um Genesis 27 just throw
[2:12:33] that up there for me oh Hallelujah he
[2:12:36] say look and he says he said now
[2:12:38] therefore restore see this restoration
[2:12:41] right here restore the man his wife
[2:12:45] right oh my let me tell you the AMC I
[2:12:48] have to use you and even though he was a
[2:12:50] righteous man he was playing the part of
[2:12:52] the devil he took this man's
[2:12:57] possession and and and and and this is
[2:12:59] what happens when when you're when
[2:13:01] you're in in in need of a
[2:13:02] jubilee God by
[2:13:05] Grace when you have put yourself in a
[2:13:07] really bad
[2:13:09] position you have put yourself where you
[2:13:12] are left
[2:13:14] helpless can you imagine Abraham
[2:13:16] couldn't sleep that night what did I
[2:13:19] just do I gave my wife to another man
[2:13:23] how can I do this and there was nothing
[2:13:25] what he going to do the next day what is
[2:13:27] Abraham going to do the next day go and
[2:13:29] go and say uh sir I'm sorry I lied to
[2:13:31] you she actually my wife that was death
[2:13:35] that was a death sentence right there
[2:13:37] was nothing Abraham could do and some of
[2:13:40] us are in situations just like that
[2:13:44] ain't nothing we can
[2:13:46] do sir but when the Jubilee trumpet
[2:13:49] sounds and you hear it you can go free
[2:13:55] amen true amen therefore restore the man
[2:13:57] his wife for he is a prophet I love the
[2:13:59] way God talks about Abraham he did not
[2:14:02] call him a liar he called
[2:14:05] him a
[2:14:07] prophet did Abraham
[2:14:09] lie yes he did did Sarah lie yes she did
[2:14:17] but according to in God's eyes he's not
[2:14:19] a liar
[2:14:21] he's a prophet amen and he shall pray
[2:14:24] for thee and thou shalt live and if thou
[2:14:28] restore her not know thou that thou
[2:14:31] shalt surely die thou and all that are
[2:14:36] thine
[2:14:37] amen Sarah herself
[2:14:40] experienced a
[2:14:46] jubilee amen
[2:14:51] let me I'm coming home I got to
[2:14:54] leave I gotta
[2:14:56] leave why are the people so tossed about
[2:14:58] let me give you one last quote here
[2:15:03] Jesus went into the
[2:15:07] temple
[2:15:11] no when he picked up the
[2:15:16] book gave it to
[2:15:19] him they didn't know what they were
[2:15:21] doing but when Jesus I I stopped
[2:15:24] actually reading the scripture there but
[2:15:26] when Jesus Took the book and he turned
[2:15:27] it back to Isaiah he read only so much
[2:15:29] of
[2:15:31] Isaiah because the rest of it brother
[2:15:33] brandom say it dealt with the second
[2:15:34] coming of the Lord so we got to talk
[2:15:36] about that later on but what I do want
[2:15:38] to tell you is that when
[2:15:41] Jesus took that
[2:15:43] book opened it to
[2:15:46] Isaiah and begin to read let me just
[2:15:48] read everything that he read and I'mma
[2:15:51] I'mma stop right there I just can't go
[2:15:53] no further go back to verse 18 there in
[2:15:55] Luke 4 the spirit of the
[2:15:58] Lord is upon me because he hath anointed
[2:16:01] me to preach the gospel to the
[2:16:03] poor he has sent me to heal the
[2:16:06] brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to
[2:16:08] the captives and recovering of sight to
[2:16:10] the blind to set at Liberty them that
[2:16:14] are
[2:16:14] bruised to preach the acceptable year of
[2:16:17] the Lord which is the Jubilee year
[2:16:21] look at this and he closed the
[2:16:24] book and he gave it again to the
[2:16:28] minister this the part that get
[2:16:32] me and sat down right
[2:16:36] it and the eyes of all them that were in
[2:16:40] the synagogue were fasting on him now
[2:16:42] he's sitting
[2:16:44] down and the priest got the book now but
[2:16:47] their eyes are not on the priest eyes on
[2:16:49] the man that's sitting down
[2:16:51] now and look at what happens next and he
[2:16:55] began to say unto them preaching from
[2:16:58] his seat oh come on
[2:17:02] [Music]
[2:17:05] Amen right preaching from his seat he
[2:17:09] makes a statement this
[2:17:13] dayall this
[2:17:16] scripture is fulfilled now not like not
[2:17:20] it's going to be fulfilled he made it
[2:17:22] present
[2:17:24] tense this day this scripture is
[2:17:28] fulfilled in your
[2:17:30] ears so those that came to church
[2:17:33] Hallelujah heard the sound of
[2:17:36] Jubilee as it came from the Lord Jesus
[2:17:39] [Applause]
[2:17:41] himself and brother Brandon say the
[2:17:43] greatest
[2:17:45] anointing that had ever been on any
[2:17:49] man was when Jesus read
[2:17:53] Isaiah and sat
[2:17:58] down yeah I'm feel that anointing in
[2:18:01] here right
[2:18:03] now I'm going to sit
[2:18:11] down this is Jubilee year
[2:18:14] church and I'm telling you if you just
[2:18:16] be obedient you're going to experience
[2:18:18] both your
[2:18:19] overflow and your you believe God bless
[2:18:22] you
[2:18:29] church we'll pick it up again amen I got
[2:18:32] some more that I want to bring out there
[2:18:34] but we'll pick it up God God knows all

[2:18:40] father we're
[2:18:42] grateful for the word of the
[2:18:45] Lord we're grateful for
[2:18:49] truth Jesus told is that we would know
[2:18:51] truth and truth would make us
[2:18:55] free Lord I believe this Jubilee trumpet
[2:18:58] is
[2:18:59] sounding God that uh people might find
[2:19:02] themselves in all types of situations
[2:19:04] and
[2:19:06] circumstances but oh
[2:19:10] God Grace has been extended
[2:19:13] amen Grace is upon
[2:19:16] us let us not make Grace a
[2:19:22] disgrace but father help us
[2:19:25] to uh Lord just receive what you're
[2:19:28] trying to say to
[2:19:30] us as a prophet tell us Lord when we
[2:19:33] hear that gospel trumpet sound we don't
[2:19:35] have to stay in the conditions that
[2:19:37] we're in we can go free and we don't
[2:19:40] have to hold on to whatever it is that
[2:19:42] the devil has us bound to that is a
[2:19:44] moment we can go free Lord I pray people
[2:19:48] to experience that freedom that Liberty
[2:19:51] young people would experience it old
[2:19:53] people would experience it even if
[2:19:55] there's something in our heart that
[2:19:56] we're holding against somebody may this
[2:19:59] be a time of
[2:20:01] release amen we don't realize things
[2:20:04] like that bring sickness upon our body
[2:20:06] when we hold on to it so I pray God that
[2:20:08] people would hear the voice of the Lord
[2:20:10] and go
[2:20:12] free we don't have to
[2:20:14] wait 7 years we don't have to wait 50
