[32:07] like the presence of the Lord
[32:09] [Music]
[32:16] I have a special prayer request here I
[32:19] want to make mention of
[32:22] our brother Nester and man we we thank
[32:26] the Lord for him
[32:29] he actually has to travel on tomorrow to
[32:34] England
[32:35] and uh
[32:37] you know
[32:39] his desire is to kind of stick around
[32:42] but
[32:44] um you know sometimes coming in from
[32:46] other countries you get only so much
[32:49] time that you can stay until they get
[32:51] things worked out for you
[32:53] and uh you know so he he I appreciate
[32:57] him he wants to honor uh you know the
[33:03] government and they told him that they
[33:04] only had so much time but he you know he
[33:07] wants to do what they say do and then
[33:09] try to come back in
[33:11] so we want to we want to pray for him
[33:13] that God would make a way we know that
[33:16] God it was only God that put him only so
[33:19] many miles from uh from this this this
[33:22] place of Fellowship but he says I thank
[33:25] God for my family here
[33:27] it's a wonderful group of saints that
[33:30] I've met here in Florida
[33:32] it's blessings to you all in the name of
[33:34] the Lord Jesus Christ I pray that we
[33:37] will see each other soon
[33:39] says it's not here and there man and uh
[33:43] we we believe the same but we want to
[33:45] pray for our brother he has to travel to
[33:47] England on tomorrow but we also want to
[33:49] pray that God will just move mountains
[33:51] amen and cause walls to fall amen and we
[33:56] want to see a miracle for our brother
[33:57] that God will make a way for him amen so
[34:01] let's bow our heads in a word of prayer
[34:03] father
[34:04] we come in the mighty name of the Lord
[34:09] Jesus
[34:10] precious brother Lord we saw you open up
[34:13] doors for him to get a fellowship healed
[34:15] while he was in Florida and how
[34:17] Supernatural you did things that he was
[34:20] just only a few minutes from the church
[34:22] and uh God he has come to this point
[34:25] this disjunction where he has to go out
[34:29] of the country then try to work on
[34:31] paperwork to get back in we pray that
[34:33] you would be with him throughout this
[34:34] entire process and I heard a testimony
[34:38] last night how you sped some things up
[34:40] where they were telling a sister would
[34:43] take weeks for her to get things
[34:44] accomplished it took days
[34:47] so father we we believe that you are the
[34:50] same yesterday today and forever and you
[34:53] told us Lord that you would give us the
[34:54] desires of our heart if we Delight
[34:56] ourselves in you so we realize there's
[34:59] no process of no program that Satan can
[35:02] put in place that would try to hinder
[35:04] our brother from being in Fellowship so
[35:06] Lord we're committing this into your
[35:08] hands and we pray that you would open up
[35:10] doors that he can't see provide in ways
[35:13] that go beyond his expectations put him
[35:15] at the desk of the right people that
[35:17] would give him favor
[35:19] Hallelujah and Lord may he bypass
[35:21] processes we've seen you do it before we
[35:24] know you're able to do it again there is
[35:26] nothing too hard for our God so Lord we
[35:29] believe for the impossible and we ask
[35:31] that you would move on our brothers uh
[35:33] behalf may you Lord get all the glory
[35:35] and all the honor and all the praise and
[35:36] father for him standing for your word I
[35:40] trust Lord that you would stand for him
[35:41] now God is in Jesus name that we pray
[35:44] amen amen
[35:47] [Applause]
[35:51] they were I just heard that um you know
[35:55] people that are kind of in this
[35:58] this state
[36:00] um they say if you get married you know
[36:03] you can get things done faster and
[36:06] actually there were some people that
[36:07] told our brother Nestor if you would
[36:09] marry a man
[36:10] [Music]
[36:12] it'd be 40 40
[36:14] faster than marry a woman
[36:23] we are living in hell
[36:30] so I thank God for a brother to say I'll
[36:33] just travel back to England amen
[36:36] amen rather than lower my standards like
[36:40] that I'll travel back to England and
[36:42] brother Ernesto we say God bless you
[36:46] deal Steve indica
[36:48] amen
[36:50] but we thank the Lord and we trust that
[36:53] God will honor his stand amen for the

[37:01] believe God's word

[38:20] might fit with their thing that they've
[38:22] been you know ministering on so the Lord
[38:25] just led me to go back and and pick up
[38:27] our thought on war strategies
[38:30] and uh you know we went through war
[38:32] strategies and showed where different
[38:34] strategies in the Bible were one of
[38:36] those virtues was actually uh um uh used
[38:40] Amen in that strategy of war and uh so I
[38:43] picked up war strategies patience with
[38:45] God
[38:46] and um and when I finished brother
[38:48] brother Delsey now I told him that we
[38:51] were you know working through the the uh
[38:54] the uh seven the seven
[38:56] uh Church no no not Church 87 statue of
[39:01] perfect man Seven Virtues he says but I
[39:03] didn't tell him which virtue we just
[39:05] finished with patience and he picked up
[39:06] patience and preached it so uh God knows
[39:09] how to just confirm his ministry amen we
[39:13] just thank the Lord for that we really
[39:14] appreciate to thank the Lord for brother
[39:16] quick who amen standing in on last week
[39:19] uh I was blessed by that sermon uh there
[39:22] were some things that he said in the
[39:24] sermon that was in my heart uh you know
[39:28] when it comes to the way that we you
[39:30] know present ourselves uh you know he he
[39:33] was talking about the little the ring
[39:36] that the young lady had and uh this
[39:39] reading that she was wearing was a
[39:40] signal a sign that she was married to
[39:43] Satan and uh you know so he was just
[39:45] kind of sharing how we got to be so
[39:47] careful about some of the things that we
[39:49] do uh you know I wanted to just mention
[39:51] that even when it come to
[39:54] um uh even Brothers they have to be
[39:56] careful with jewelry you know um in um
[39:59] in the in the Old Testament
[40:01] there was when the when the Hebrew boys
[40:04] and when Daniel were going through their
[40:06] trials in Babylon when they overcame the
[40:10] the uh the the people there was coming
[40:13] and bringing them necklaces
[40:16] that's where it come from from the
[40:18] Babylonians because they weren't wearing
[40:20] them but the Babylonians was given the
[40:22] man necklaces
[40:24] so the men have to be careful in this
[40:26] area right so brother brother Quaker
[40:28] just hit a number of things that was
[40:30] just right there and then we had a
[40:32] questions and answer session my God

[42:55] after that he had showed wonders and
[42:57] signs in the land of Egypt and in the
[42:59] Red Sea and in the wilderness 40 years

[44:07] hands

[44:41] hey man let's uh have a word of prayer
[44:44] father we are grateful for the reading
[44:48] of scripture we're also grateful for the
[44:51] anointing uh that is in the house we
[44:55] thank you that we can come to church and
[44:57] feel the power in the presence of God we
[45:00] know that when you come anything can
[45:03] happen so Lord we uh commit this portion
[45:06] of the service into your hands we ask
[45:08] that you would get all the glory and all
[45:11] the honor and all the praise from uh the
[45:14] word of God may it bring strength and
[45:16] comfort correction Direction instruction
[45:19] whatever it is that we need here today
[45:21] may you bring it God's in Jesus name we
[45:25] pray amen amen God bless you you can be
[45:28] seated
[45:29] um I I don't give my title in just a
[45:32] little bit I'm gonna read the title
[45:34] right out of a quote the first quote
[45:35] that I'll uh I'll uh pick up here in a
[45:38] second uh let me also mention
[45:41] um I I did receive a call from brother
[45:43] Mike over at brother West Coast Church
[45:46] and he had told me I forget one day this
[45:48] week that brother masaka was going to be
[45:50] there uh and they they actually have him
[45:52] speaking at brother West Coast Church
[45:54] this morning then he'll be speaking at
[45:55] brother Gene's church tonight they did
[45:58] invite us for the service this morning
[46:00] but I told him we just wouldn't be able
[46:01] to make it uh short notice and we just
[46:05] couldn't kind of try to uh move things
[46:07] that fast uh you know so so if we can
[46:12] make it tonight at brother Gene's it
[46:14] would be really really good I think they
[46:16] would really appreciate the support and
[46:18] the services so just keep that in mind
[46:20] hey man uh so I want to uh just just
[46:25] bear with me I'm gonna give you the
[46:26] title shortly uh but uh brother Branham
[46:31] preached a sermon
[46:32] why cry speak amen he preached the
[46:36] sermon why cry
[46:37] speak and he took his text for this
[46:41] sermon he took it out of Exodus chapter
[46:43] 14. and I'd like to read a man uh a few
[46:47] verses from there he he actually took
[46:49] verse 15 and 16 but I want to start at
[46:51] verse 13 uh and just kind of read where
[46:54] he got his text from says and Moses said
[46:57] unto the people fear ye not
[47:00] [Music]
[47:01] stand still and see the salvation of the
[47:06] Lord which he will show to you today I
[47:10] love this in verse 13 here in Exodus 14
[47:12] for the Egyptians whom ye have seen
[47:15] today ye shall see them again no more
[47:20] forever that's a promise amen verse 14
[47:24] says the Lord shall fight for you and ye
[47:28] shall hold your peace amen verse 15 says
[47:32] and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore
[47:35] Christ thou unto me speak unto the
[47:39] children of Israel that they go forward
[47:42] now here's the problem between verse
[47:44] amen 14 and verse 15. amen I want you to
[47:49] look notice verse 14 again the Lord
[47:51] shall fight for you and ye shall hold
[47:53] your peace now that is Moses speaking
[47:57] glory to God but somewhere in between
[47:59] verse 14 and 15 his human nature got in
[48:03] the way and he began to cry out to God
[48:05] and God had to rebuke him I actually the
[48:08] prophet gives us a man a beautiful
[48:10] description of this he said Moses he had
[48:13] finally called him he got him to a spot
[48:16] where he could carry the people and and
[48:18] the prophet said God was going to sit
[48:20] down Hallelujah and as he was on his way
[48:23] to sit down he heard a voice from the
[48:25] earth amen crying up to heaven Lord what
[48:29] shall I do and God turned around from
[48:33] going to sit-down way who is this
[48:34] calling me it's Moses on the earth Lord
[48:37] what shall I do say wait a wait a minute
[48:38] why are you calling me like that Moses
[48:40] didn't you just say that the Lord is
[48:43] going to fight for you then you just say
[48:45] to hold your peace then you just say
[48:47] fear and stand fear not and stand still
[48:49] amen because God's gonna show you
[48:51] salvation Day then you'll just speak
[48:53] those things out of your mouth why are
[48:54] you crying now Moses
[48:57] so then God speaks to him in verse 15 it
[49:00] says the Lord said unto Moses wherefore
[49:02] Christ thou unto me speak unto the
[49:05] children of Israel that they go forward
[49:08] that mean don't stand still don't stop
[49:10] but keep moving forward
[49:13] blessed be the name of the Lord he says
[49:16] but lift thou up thy rod and stretch out
[49:18] thou hand over the sea and divide it in
[49:20] the children of Israel shall go on dry
[49:22] ground through the midst of the sea amen
[49:26] here's the the statement here as brother
[49:29] Branham read this scripture and he and
[49:33] he took the thought on why Christ speak
[49:34] and if you've ever heard the tape I know
[49:37] you've been blessed and I it's one of
[49:39] those that you can just go back and
[49:40] listen to over and over again it is so
[49:42] anointing and so powerful why Christ
[49:44] speak we don't have to cry about
[49:46] anything speak and not just speak not
[49:48] just speak don't just don't don't just
[49:51] speak
[49:52] you got to put some action behind your
[49:54] speakings speak and then move forward
[49:58] some are speaking weights but that ain't
[50:02] what God Said
[50:04] speak move forward
[50:07] oh I don't think y'all get it yet we
[50:10] want to wait to see what this person
[50:11] gonna do we'll want to wait to see what
[50:13] that person gonna do but what did God
[50:16] tell you
[50:17] speak and then move forward put some
[50:20] action behind your speaking
[50:24] hey hallelujah amen we're always waiting
[50:27] on God to do something God is always
[50:28] waiting on us to do something
[50:30] but here you know the prophet takes this
[50:33] amen and he preaches uh why Christ speak
[50:36] but here I want you to just catch a
[50:38] statement at the very beginning of his
[50:39] sermon he says this for our text tonight
[50:43] amen I would like to use the three words
[50:47] why cry speak
[50:50] and for a subject
[50:52] I would like to use the attitude of
[50:56] people towards God's anointed
[51:02] so our title today
[51:04] is the ad the attitude of people towards
[51:08] God's anointed
[51:11] glory to God this was his subject Amen
[51:15] in the message why Christ speaks so we
[51:17] want to just try to dig in there just a
[51:19] little bit today
[51:20] so an attitude
[51:23] what is this what is this attitude uh
[51:26] the dictionary says it's a settled way
[51:29] of thinking
[51:30] or a subtle way of feeling about a man
[51:35] uh I forgot to start my timer so y'all
[51:37] everything I just said was free
[51:40] hey man he says uh the dictionary says a
[51:43] subtle way of thinking or settle away a
[51:46] feeling about someone or something and
[51:50] typically one that is reflected in a
[51:53] person's Behavior
[51:55] so what we if I could just dumb it down
[51:59] or in brother Quaker's words step it
[52:01] down
[52:02] hallelujah amen if I could just stepping
[52:05] down your attitude is reflected in your
[52:08] behavior or your actions
[52:10] amen we watch how you respond and we can
[52:13] tell whether you got a good attitude or
[52:16] whether you got a bad attitude
[52:18] your actions tell you what type of
[52:21] attitude you have sometimes your actions
[52:23] show what your attitude towards God is
[52:28] your attitude towards God's anointed his
[52:31] anointed Pastor his anointed ministers
[52:33] his anointed people your attitude
[52:36] displeased where you at
[52:40] it's a subtle way of thinking
[52:43] it's a set of way of feeling about
[52:45] something or someone if someone if you
[52:48] got a bad attitude with somebody you're
[52:50] gonna avoid shaking their hands
[52:53] you're not gonna greet them after church
[52:55] you're gonna you're gonna Dodge them
[52:56] we're gonna run by your your body
[52:58] language is telling us all about your
[53:00] attitude
[53:02] Y'all Gonna Let Me preach for a little
[53:04] bit
[53:06] but we want to watch our attitude see
[53:08] that the attitude of people towards
[53:10] God's anointed now there's a number of
[53:13] things we can get into here today but
[53:14] I'm I'm gonna just try to Coast just a
[53:17] little bit if I can now look at this in
[53:19] this in the sermon believe it's thou
[53:20] this
[53:21] believe it's now this out of New York
[53:24] amen the prophet says this
[53:27] says watch them on the pla on the
[53:29] platform sometime in a healing service
[53:32] watch the attitude they come in
[53:36] he says here the other night remember
[53:38] the lady coming up there just about
[53:41] enough why didn't have enough Faith
[53:44] Harlow to get to the platform
[53:46] she been in a prayer line
[53:49] after prayer line I I knowed the woman
[53:53] wasn't going to get well
[53:57] he says he knew it and the reason he
[53:58] knew it because of her attitude I know
[54:01] the woman wasn't going to get it well
[54:02] seeing her coming up there I knew it
[54:05] wasn't she didn't have the right
[54:06] attitude when she come up to get well
[54:11] you can't do it I said the Lord Jesus
[54:13] blessed you sister go may he heal you
[54:15] right it's all I can say see but it's
[54:18] just not there why she'd been here and
[54:21] There and Everywhere You see them like
[54:23] that you can't do that you gotta take
[54:26] God at his word
[54:28] it goes on he says here a few weeks ago
[54:31] a man
[54:33] um a a man come up and he said brother
[54:36] random said I went out and tried Freeman
[54:38] he couldn't do me he couldn't do me any
[54:41] good I went to Osborne he couldn't do me
[54:43] any good I went to uh uh ogre Leaf he
[54:46] can he couldn't do me any good I went to
[54:48] Robert's said now I come to you I said
[54:51] you're going you're going away the same
[54:53] way
[54:54] that's right I said you're going You're
[54:55] Going to the wrong person go to God not
[54:58] to some man what can we do nothing it's
[55:01] him that's already done it just believe
[55:03] his word and accept it it'll take place
[55:07] now you don't know when it's gonna take
[55:09] place but it will take place
[55:11] praise God Amen if there's any sick
[55:14] among you let them call for the Elders
[55:17] of the church they will anointed or lay
[55:20] hands on the sick and they shall
[55:23] they shall recover when I don't know but
[55:27] I know God said I shall
[55:30] and all you keep throwing in the devil's
[55:32] face is what God promised you I shall
[55:35] recover
[55:36] everything
[55:39] glory to God
[55:40] hey man look at this it says um uh uh I
[55:45] don't say it says uh you're going away
[55:46] here and disappointed he said but until
[55:48] until then it won't do your bit of good
[55:50] no matter where you go you're going away
[55:52] from here just as disappointed as you
[55:55] went away from the other places because
[55:57] your heart isn't right with God I don't
[55:59] say it was was any immoral acts now but
[56:02] if your heart isn't right with God you
[56:04] can't believe that's true so he went
[56:06] away
[56:07] the same way
[56:09] as all these people come through the
[56:10] line getting healed and pray after
[56:13] they've been prayed for they're getting
[56:14] healed this man leaves without his
[56:16] healing and he gets there into the
[56:18] prophet's presence but the reason that
[56:19] he cannot be healed is because he does
[56:21] not have
[56:22] the right attitude
[56:25] let's look at a few people here that has
[56:27] that have had the right attitude
[56:29] Amen in scripture when it comes to
[56:31] approaching
[56:33] um
[56:34] just approaching God one of these you
[56:37] know that I found
[56:38] amen and brother Brandon makes a
[56:40] statement about her is Rahab
[56:43] the the the the Harlot she had the right
[56:46] attitude
[56:47] and um and brother Brandon makes say he
[56:49] says actually I like her attitude he
[56:51] used that statement I like attitude
[56:53] because when Rahab saw these two spies
[56:56] coming into the land now she knew what
[56:58] the talk in the land was all about
[57:01] hey man she knew that these people uh
[57:04] There Was Fear all over Jericho the
[57:06] people like ain't no way we gonna be
[57:08] able to withstand uh this this group of
[57:11] people coming out of Israel no way we're
[57:13] gonna be able to defeat them I mean this
[57:15] is impossible for us so as they're uh
[57:17] you know she knows what the people
[57:19] Jericho are saying and so when she sees
[57:21] the two spots she recognizes who they
[57:23] are and admit if she goes into action
[57:26] and invites those men to come into her
[57:28] house now you need to understand Rahab
[57:30] was not looking for new customers
[57:33] actually this was a way to get out of
[57:36] the lifestyle that she was in
[57:39] remember brother random said that her
[57:41] parents put her out like that in order
[57:43] to make money oh Hallelujah somebody but
[57:47] even in rahabs amen uh being taken
[57:50] advantage of Rahab without the Holy
[57:53] Ghost still had a love for her daddy and
[57:55] for her mama that when the spots came
[57:58] she began to negotiate even on their
[58:00] behalf say we know y'all gonna take this
[58:03] city but all I want to know is is there
[58:06] any way I can get some safety for myself
[58:08] and what about for my daddy and what
[58:11] about for my mama and what about for
[58:13] this person what what about that they
[58:14] say look rehab if you can get anybody
[58:17] and everybody inside this house they
[58:20] will be protected praise God they can't
[58:23] be outside the house but they got to be
[58:25] inside the house and Rehab did
[58:28] everything she could to get them in the
[58:30] house and she put the Scarlet thread out
[58:32] of her window and when they came to take
[58:34] the city glory to God God gave them that
[58:37] battle strategy amen they're walking
[58:40] around the walls with patience walk
[58:42] around for one time for six days but on
[58:45] the seventh day go seven times they had
[58:47] to use their patience in order to bring
[58:50] the walls down
[58:52] glory to God Amen and why you waiting on
[58:56] God God is bringing walls down
[58:59] you might as well watch them fall praise
[59:02] God cause our God will move a mountain
[59:05] he will cause walls to fall
[59:08] [Applause]
[59:11] rehab waiting in there with our family
[59:13] rehab house was on top of the wall so
[59:17] the only part of the world that did not
[59:19] fall was where her house was
[59:21] [Music]
[59:23] I imagine the way God set up is that
[59:25] rahab's house probably had some scoring
[59:26] up too
[59:28] and one way out
[59:30] God knew how to take care of his people
[59:31] but Rahab had the right attitude with
[59:34] the spies they were God's anointed she
[59:38] had the right attitude she was willing
[59:40] to respect what she heard
[59:42] I like this the prophet says she was
[59:45] um she wasn't waiting to see what Joshua
[59:48] looked like
[59:49] she wasn't waiting to see how he was
[59:51] gonna handle business and how he was
[59:52] going to do that whatever these spies
[59:54] told her she she respected that and
[59:57] because of that attitude God honored it
[1:00:00] her house remained
[1:00:02] here the prophet makes a statement about
[1:00:04] her
[1:00:05] we'll read it here out of why Christ
[1:00:07] speaking says I like to make mention of
[1:00:08] one woman that I think of in the Bible
[1:00:11] see was bad to begin with rotten to the
[1:00:13] core a young beautiful woman by the name
[1:00:16] of Rahab she was a heathen to start with
[1:00:18] and she was a prostitute on the street
[1:00:21] but she heard that there was a God not
[1:00:24] an idol that set them or a declaration
[1:00:27] of Creeds but a God who lived among his
[1:00:29] people and anointed them and signs and
[1:00:31] wonders Glory was following them she
[1:00:34] heard about it one day two
[1:00:36] Representatives come to Jericho and
[1:00:38] quickly her on the street as a prophecy
[1:00:40] called them took them into a house
[1:00:43] they're after you and she hid them and I
[1:00:46] like her attitude she never said I would
[1:00:48] believe when I see the great anointed
[1:00:49] Joshua do some signs no she wasn't
[1:00:51] waiting for somebody else to do
[1:00:52] something it says if I could have seen
[1:00:54] Moses do some some of the signs I would
[1:00:56] have believed but she said I have heard
[1:00:59] Faith cometh by hearing hearing of the
[1:01:01] word I have heard that God Of Heaven who
[1:01:03] is the real God is with you all and he's
[1:01:05] done great signs and wonders he dried up
[1:01:07] the Red Sea he brought plagues from
[1:01:09] Egypt we see how he had turned the enemy
[1:01:11] over to your hands and and our whole
[1:01:13] country is trembling because of it I'm
[1:01:16] she says I'm asking Mercy
[1:01:19] somebody else should have had the same
[1:01:21] thought that Rahab had we know what
[1:01:23] y'all give me to do in here but I'm
[1:01:25] asking for mercy she didn't say well I I
[1:01:28] will I would have to see God first let
[1:01:29] me take my judgment and take what my
[1:01:31] scripture says about it she never found
[1:01:33] it but Faith cometh by hearing and
[1:01:35] hearing the word of God and she believed
[1:01:37] and when these words was brought back to
[1:01:39] Joshua the word Joshua means savior Like
[1:01:42] Jesus Does when it brought back to
[1:01:44] Joshua God's anointed her house was for
[1:01:46] a minute to stand and when the People
[1:01:48] March 13 13 times around the walls of
[1:01:51] Jericho and sounded a trumpet every
[1:01:53] place on that wall fell but her house
[1:01:57] because she believed before she's seen
[1:01:59] anything she accepted it she said
[1:02:02] they're Servants of the most high God
[1:02:04] and I will receive it upon the basis of
[1:02:06] hearing it amen I believe it Faith
[1:02:08] cometh by hearing she heard it she
[1:02:10] believed that she accepted it amen and
[1:02:12] notice they said Bond the Scarlet string
[1:02:15] that you let that you led us down with
[1:02:16] binded in the window that rant amen I
[1:02:20] spoke of the blood of Jesus the
[1:02:22] atonement glory and every place in that
[1:02:26] Warfare hell but rahab's house that sat
[1:02:28] on top of the wall God honored her and
[1:02:31] she saw a great A great miracle
[1:02:33] performed there and there it was drying
[1:02:35] up the Red Sea for the hand of Jehovah
[1:02:37] was over that little place to protect
[1:02:39] protected she had accepted it God's
[1:02:41] anointed God's servants went over there
[1:02:43] anointing that she believed it before
[1:02:45] she seen Miracles she believed it and
[1:02:47] how and accepted it
[1:02:49] and we got to be the same way before we
[1:02:51] see a miracle let's believe it and
[1:02:53] accept it
[1:02:54] amen and let's put some action with our
[1:02:56] speaking amen let's go forward
[1:02:59] another person that we can see in
[1:03:01] Scripture
[1:03:02] that had the right attitude no matter
[1:03:04] what she was going through but she had
[1:03:06] the right attitude with God's anointed
[1:03:08] amen because some people with God's
[1:03:10] anointed they get the wrong attitude but
[1:03:13] this lady kept the right attitude and
[1:03:15] and what had happened in her situation
[1:03:17] uh her brother had taken sick
[1:03:20] and when he took sit she uh uh they sent
[1:03:24] for Jesus her and her sister sent for
[1:03:26] Jesus this is Martha of the scripture
[1:03:28] and her and her sister sent for Jesus
[1:03:30] like you know we you know we we fed him
[1:03:33] we let him sleep here in the room and we
[1:03:35] we we we we took care of him when he
[1:03:37] come by you know maybe he'll come and do
[1:03:39] something special for us amen and
[1:03:42] um but Jesus delayed his coming he never
[1:03:45] showed up there to the house and and
[1:03:46] finally after four days of of uh Lazarus
[1:03:50] being in the grave Jesus finally shows
[1:03:52] up to town and when he gets there the
[1:03:55] way that we can tell Martha had the
[1:03:56] right attitude is the way she approached
[1:03:58] them let's pick it up in John 11 verse
[1:04:01] 20. amen John 11 verse 20. now she was a
[1:04:05] little discouraged uh she was going
[1:04:08] through a period of grief amen she was
[1:04:10] really she was just really downtrodden
[1:04:12] in her spirit and she approached the
[1:04:14] Lord when she heard that Jesus that
[1:04:16] showed up she left the pity party
[1:04:18] Hallelujah and man she left the people
[1:04:21] that were surrounding her and in a
[1:04:23] comfort she said only one that can
[1:04:24] really bring me confidence Jesus say I
[1:04:27] need to just get out there and just talk
[1:04:28] to him for a little bit so she left her
[1:04:30] sister in the house and she went running
[1:04:32] to find Jesus glory to God in verse 20
[1:04:34] says then Martha as soon as she heard
[1:04:37] that Jesus was coming went and met him
[1:04:41] but Mary sat still in the house amen
[1:04:45] then said my friend to Jesus Lord
[1:04:49] it thou has been here
[1:04:52] my brother had not died and she I mean
[1:04:55] look at the attitude I know if you would
[1:04:58] have been here if you would have come
[1:04:59] when we when we asked you to come my
[1:05:01] brother wouldn't have died but now he's
[1:05:03] four dead four days gone but but Jesus
[1:05:05] would be known if you would have been
[1:05:06] here it would it would have been a whole
[1:05:07] different story
[1:05:08] glory to God Amen they were looking for
[1:05:11] him to do something special but they
[1:05:13] didn't realize he really was going to do
[1:05:15] something special
[1:05:16] amen he said this he says but but look
[1:05:20] at what she say but I know
[1:05:24] if you would have been here Jesus my
[1:05:27] brother wouldn't have died
[1:05:29] but I know that even now I love that man
[1:05:34] you got to have the right attitude
[1:05:37] you gotta have an attitude of gratitude
[1:05:40] no matter what you're going through get
[1:05:42] the right attitude in it
[1:05:46] all right but I know even now
[1:05:50] that even now whatsoever thou will ask
[1:05:54] of God God will give it to thee
[1:06:00] man what an attitude
[1:06:02] when you're approaching God like that he
[1:06:05] want to do something for you
[1:06:07] he's looking to get something
[1:06:08] accomplished on your behalf
[1:06:11] but you gotta have
[1:06:14] gotta have said on her thy brother shall
[1:06:15] rise again
[1:06:17] Martha said to him I know that he shall
[1:06:20] rise again in the resurrection at the
[1:06:22] last day
[1:06:24] Jesus said to her I am the resurrection
[1:06:29] and the life and I like that see he he
[1:06:32] didn't keep he didn't put the
[1:06:33] resurrection off to the last day he
[1:06:35] helped us to realize the resurrection
[1:06:37] was not an event but the resurrection
[1:06:39] was a person
[1:06:43] it's the person of the Lord Jesus amen I
[1:06:46] am the resurrection and the life he that
[1:06:49] believeth in me though he word dead yet
[1:06:52] shall he live
[1:06:55] and whosoever living Believers in me
[1:06:57] shall never die believeth thou this
[1:06:59] look at that and she's 7 AM yay Lord I
[1:07:01] believe that thou art the Christ the son
[1:07:03] of God which should come into the world
[1:07:05] now I won't take time to read the rest
[1:07:07] of that but uh but I I'll um I'll just
[1:07:11] go and just say you know just to
[1:07:13] summarize that story when she got these
[1:07:15] words from Jesus she began to just kind
[1:07:16] of slip away she said let me go and get
[1:07:19] married because some getting ready to
[1:07:20] happen and Mary I know I know you're a
[1:07:22] little you you're a little crying and
[1:07:24] maybe you might even be saying if he
[1:07:26] would have come if he would have come
[1:07:27] this wouldn't be like this but Mary
[1:07:29] something get ready to happen you're
[1:07:30] gonna have to come on out here where
[1:07:32] Jesus is you're gonna have to get on out
[1:07:34] here where Jesus is and as they come out
[1:07:35] there and amen Jesus says show me where
[1:07:38] you laid them all right glory to God and
[1:07:40] uh and when they showed him where he was
[1:07:42] laid behind that tomb my Jesus looked at
[1:07:46] him then he told them sisters now they
[1:07:48] were brothers there but he told them
[1:07:50] sisters say now you roll away the stone
[1:07:53] and when and the reason they told the
[1:07:56] sisters roll away the storm because they
[1:07:57] had to be involved they had to be
[1:08:00] involved in the miracle you know what
[1:08:01] you got some stones in your life you
[1:08:03] holding some people back
[1:08:07] some of the words that you don't use
[1:08:09] against people
[1:08:10] they are stones that you done rolled
[1:08:12] over their graves
[1:08:14] amen and you got to be the one to
[1:08:16] release them out of that grave you have
[1:08:18] to roll the stone away
[1:08:20] and when they rolled and stone away
[1:08:22] Jesus amen spoke out with a with a loud
[1:08:25] voice Lazarus come forth and the prophet
[1:08:28] told us if he had not called Lazarus by
[1:08:31] name
[1:08:33] Amy says if he would have just said come
[1:08:36] forth everything that was in the grave
[1:08:39] no matter how long it had been in the
[1:08:41] grave it could have been there for 2 000
[1:08:44] years but if Jesus would have said come
[1:08:47] forth they would have come out of there
[1:08:49] [Applause]
[1:08:51] so he had to call Lazarus by me that's
[1:08:53] how much power is in his voice
[1:08:56] he had to call him by name and here come
[1:08:59] this man that's been dead four days in
[1:09:01] mummy clothes
[1:09:03] he still can't he's still not useful he
[1:09:06] might be might be risen from the dead
[1:09:08] but it's still not useful we got to get
[1:09:10] him out the mummy clothes now loose him
[1:09:13] lose him loose him and let him go
[1:09:17] oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:09:19] and brother random makes a statement as
[1:09:21] he's talking about this in Believers now
[1:09:23] this he preaches it in Minneapolis
[1:09:25] Minnesota and it makes a statement about
[1:09:28] Jesus being delayed to come amen and
[1:09:31] pray for Lazarus he says that's the
[1:09:33] reason friend I'm out of time and now if
[1:09:36] you sin to your pastor
[1:09:40] and it didn't come and pray for you when
[1:09:43] you were sick
[1:09:44] where you say the old hypocrite
[1:09:46] I would go over and join Jones church or
[1:09:49] somebody see that's what happened amen
[1:09:51] when you have the wrong attitude
[1:09:54] amen when you have their own attitude
[1:09:56] you want to get rid of the pastor
[1:09:58] all right amen he ain't done one thing
[1:10:01] wrong but just stand on the word of God
[1:10:03] but we want to get rid of that Pastor
[1:10:05] right say that old hypocrite I'll go
[1:10:08] over and join Jones's Church of somebody
[1:10:10] that's the reason your pastor can't do
[1:10:12] nothing for you
[1:10:14] you gotta have faith in him amen and
[1:10:18] confidence in him as a man of God and
[1:10:20] know that all things work together for
[1:10:22] good to them that love God
[1:10:24] that's right now your pastor didn't tell
[1:10:27] me to say that either but I know this
[1:10:29] you've got to have confidence in the man
[1:10:32] you're dealing with or it won't do you
[1:10:35] any good to do any dealing
[1:10:38] he said that's true you got to believe
[1:10:40] your pastor he's a good he's a god-saved
[1:10:44] man preaching the gospel stand behind
[1:10:46] him with everything you got if he isn't
[1:10:49] go somewhere they do do it
[1:10:54] now look at what the prophet saying now
[1:10:56] so if you got to pass it ain't standing
[1:10:58] on the word go somewhere you can find
[1:11:00] one that's standing on the word
[1:11:01] amen hallelujah look at look at what you
[1:11:04] say that's right now that clears it up
[1:11:06] for both sides I like what he just said
[1:11:08] there because you know some pastors will
[1:11:10] try to keep people in bondage
[1:11:13] amen they use steer tactics to keep the
[1:11:15] people close to them some of them use
[1:11:17] positions yo y'all ain't gonna talk to
[1:11:20] me they give positions to people in
[1:11:22] order to keep them in the ministry
[1:11:24] hallelujah amen but it's the word that
[1:11:27] you want to be kept by if the man is not
[1:11:30] preaching the word brother will say if
[1:11:31] he stopped preaching word you don't have
[1:11:33] to follow him no more find yourself
[1:11:34] another Pastor that's preaching the word
[1:11:39] we got to stay on this word the word is
[1:11:41] what's going to get us out of here
[1:11:43] feelings ain't gonna get us out of here
[1:11:44] emotions ain't gonna get us out of here
[1:11:46] we need the word if if Eve would have
[1:11:51] stayed behind the word we would have no
[1:11:53] trouble on the Earth today but because
[1:11:55] she got from behind the word and anytime
[1:11:57] a church comes from behind the word
[1:11:59] trouble will set in
[1:12:03] all right stay with me here
[1:12:05] he says uh uh if uh preaching the gospel
[1:12:08] stand behind him with it said he's a
[1:12:10] god-saved man preaching the gospel stand
[1:12:12] behind him with everything you got if he
[1:12:14] is him go somewhere where they do do it
[1:12:16] amen that's right now that clears it up
[1:12:19] for both sides now remember this if he
[1:12:20] preaches his gospel stay with him help
[1:12:22] him because he's a man sent from God
[1:12:24] ordained of God to feed your soul
[1:12:30] blessed be the name of the Lord I want
[1:12:33] to look at
[1:12:35] another story here
[1:12:37] of some people that just didn't have
[1:12:40] amen the right attitude towards God's
[1:12:43] anointed
[1:12:45] and you got to keep the right attitude
[1:12:46] towards God's anointed
[1:12:48] uh I want to pick this story up in
[1:12:51] Scripture
[1:12:54] out of the book of First Kings chapter
[1:12:56] one
[1:13:04] these people had a bad attitude
[1:13:07] when it came to dealing with God's
[1:13:09] anointed
[1:13:20] uh
[1:13:22] I said First Kings one right
[1:13:30] I might have the wrong scripture hold on
[1:13:32] one second let me
[1:13:34] let me look at this
[1:13:41] I think I might have pulled a wrong
[1:13:42] scripture hold on one second
[1:13:44] uh
[1:13:47] it might be second Kings one so just
[1:13:49] give me one second I just I just
[1:13:50] realized I wrote down the wrong thing
[1:13:56] Second Kings one
[1:13:58] Second Kings one amen
[1:14:01] these people had a terrible attitude
[1:14:05] and your attitude
[1:14:09] can get you sick
[1:14:12] your attitude
[1:14:14] can bring death upon you
[1:14:18] and and you know I'll I'll share this
[1:14:21] even brother branham's wife
[1:14:25] had the wrong attitude
[1:14:27] with her husband
[1:14:29] and you know she was looking for him to
[1:14:31] correct the kids in a certain way
[1:14:33] and and when he like no I don't want to
[1:14:36] do it that way you know nah I don't feel
[1:14:38] that to do it that way Derma just do
[1:14:40] this and brother Brandon knew that you
[1:14:42] know she was upset and she's like well
[1:14:43] you know you need to be here more often
[1:14:45] with the kids or whatever she went in
[1:14:46] the room slammed the door my God and you
[1:14:49] know the Bible actually say it's better
[1:14:50] for a man to beware on a rooftop
[1:14:53] then in the house with a a a woman
[1:14:56] that's acting like that
[1:14:58] amen and husbands need to know when your
[1:15:01] wife get into a condition like that just
[1:15:02] step away don't try to add fuel to the
[1:15:05] fire fire right but brother brother
[1:15:07] brother brother brother Brandon felt
[1:15:08] just said I'm gonna just go outside and
[1:15:10] wash the car and he said I'm just giving
[1:15:12] time to cool down you know I know the
[1:15:13] lady upset she got a right to be upset
[1:15:15] but her attitude was wrong towards God's
[1:15:17] anointed
[1:15:19] and when she uh when she did that uh the
[1:15:22] brother Brandon said the Holy Spirit
[1:15:23] came saying I go back in the house and
[1:15:25] take her to the scripture and read to
[1:15:28] her this scripture about I think it's in
[1:15:30] uh and those numbers or something like
[1:15:33] that but where where Miriam uh had said
[1:15:35] the wrong thing to Moses amen and she
[1:15:38] ended up being leprous Hallelujah he
[1:15:40] said now go back and read that Miriam
[1:15:42] had the wrong attitude right uh Aaron
[1:15:45] had the wrong attitude towards God's
[1:15:47] anointed amen when they got the wrong
[1:15:49] attitude they said the wrong thing at
[1:15:51] the wrong time criticizing Moses for the
[1:15:53] woman that he married
[1:15:55] amen
[1:15:56] all right I mean and and Moses Moses was
[1:15:59] in a mixed marriage but then he had to
[1:16:02] come back and tell people don't even let
[1:16:04] tribes cross
[1:16:07] right don't even let tribes crossing
[1:16:09] here he is all messed up in his marriage
[1:16:11] but you got to watch what you say to him
[1:16:14] sometimes you just need to keep your
[1:16:16] mouth shut brother brothers dicks told
[1:16:18] us you need the new ministry shut your
[1:16:20] mouth Ministry

[1:16:30] this man gonna teach me and he and just
[1:16:32] just don't say nothing
[1:16:37] because God is hearing it

[1:16:54] seven days and she'll be able to come
[1:16:56] back into Camp we'll heal her then but
[1:16:57] she got to pay for this for what she
[1:16:59] said she got to pay for brother
[1:17:01] Brandon's wife said the wrong thing at
[1:17:03] the wrong time the prophet Prophet was
[1:17:04] told by the Holy Spirit go back and read
[1:17:06] that scripture to her went back in the
[1:17:08] house and he read that he says knocking
[1:17:10] on the door can you imagine him like ah
[1:17:12] she mad at me but I gotta go tell her
[1:17:14] what the what the Holy Spirit just told
[1:17:16] me knocking on the door timing
[1:17:19] honey I need to talk to you
[1:17:21] what is it
[1:17:23] Holy Spirit told me to tell you
[1:17:25] something
[1:17:27] seeing a woman with a good attitude
[1:17:30] will humble herself down
[1:17:32] or she might if she got a bad understood
[1:17:34] she'll say I don't care what the Holy
[1:17:36] Ghost told you
[1:17:39] your attitude is bad and that type of
[1:17:42] attitude will bring death to you
[1:17:47] here you know he's saying look the Holy
[1:17:49] Ghost just told me something I got a
[1:17:50] which took out the scripture and
[1:17:52] read it to her and said now you're gonna
[1:17:54] have to pay for what you just did you
[1:17:55] just you know it wasn't me that it was
[1:17:57] finished it was God that was offended
[1:18:00] and since God was offended you're gonna
[1:18:02] have to pay for that she developed a
[1:18:04] tumor and that to me got so big it was
[1:18:06] big as a grapefruit I think or something
[1:18:08] like that a huge tumor and uh and
[1:18:10] brother Brandon I mean just imagine all
[1:18:12] this going on brother Bradham has
[1:18:13] meetings that he's scheduled to go to
[1:18:15] and his wife is set up for surgery
[1:18:18] y'all didn't get it yet
[1:18:20] he has meetings that he's scheduled to
[1:18:22] go to and while he's in the meetings his
[1:18:24] wife is set up for surgery
[1:18:27] now most wives if y'all would be honest
[1:18:30] with me if you knew your husband was
[1:18:32] going to a meeting and you had surgery
[1:18:35] what would be your attitude
[1:18:38] wow three
[1:18:44] three and you wonder you want healing
[1:18:47] with an attitude like that
[1:18:50] you you wouldn't be able to handle it
[1:18:51] right but here you know brother if
[1:18:53] animals away and he's like you know I
[1:18:55] know you got to go to surgery and I
[1:18:56] gotta go I got these meetings that I
[1:18:58] gotta go to a call from God call him out
[1:19:00] there to do this amen and he goes off on
[1:19:03] the field and while he's there on the
[1:19:04] field see it pays to be in the perfect
[1:19:06] will of God
[1:19:08] cause while he's doing God the service
[1:19:12] then he's praying for his wife while
[1:19:14] he's in in Louisiana he's praying for
[1:19:16] his wife in Indiana and they say loved
[1:19:19] before the doctor's hand touched my my
[1:19:21] wife's body let that tumor beat
[1:19:24] disappear
[1:19:25] so while he's in while he's in Louisiana
[1:19:27] speaking the word it goes all the way to
[1:19:30] Indiana and the doctor go to bring the
[1:19:32] wife into for surgery and they said he
[1:19:35] said she said before you before you take
[1:19:37] me in before you cut me just check me
[1:19:39] one more time what we know is that we've
[1:19:41] seen it there the last time but just
[1:19:42] check me one more time
[1:19:44] they went and checked ran the scam no
[1:19:47] more Tuma
[1:19:51] but see everybody got to keep the right
[1:19:52] attitude
[1:19:54] if you want to see God moved you must
[1:19:56] have the right attitude
[1:19:58] look even in your house your husband
[1:20:02] won't move with a bad attitude husbands
[1:20:05] your wife won't move she won't be
[1:20:08] willing to do nothing if you got the
[1:20:10] wrong attitude
[1:20:11] how you expect God
[1:20:14] to move on your behalf if you got the
[1:20:16] wrong attitude
[1:20:23] amen
[1:20:25] man let's look at these people here in
[1:20:27] Second Kings these people lost their
[1:20:29] life
[1:20:30] because of the attitude
[1:20:35] verse one the more I rebelled against
[1:20:37] Israel after the death of Ahab
[1:20:40] and ahasia fell down through a lattice
[1:20:43] in his upper chamber
[1:20:46] that was in Samaria was sick and he sent
[1:20:48] Messengers and said unto them go inquire
[1:20:52] bowel's above the god of ekron whether I
[1:20:55] shall recover this disease
[1:20:57] but the angel of the Lord said unto
[1:20:59] Elijah to the test Bank
[1:21:01] arise go up to meet The Messengers of
[1:21:03] the king of Samaria and say unto them is
[1:21:06] it not because there is not a God in
[1:21:08] Israel that you go to inquire about
[1:21:10] Beelzebub the god of econ now therefore
[1:21:13] thus saith the Lord Thou shalt not come
[1:21:16] down from that bed on which Thou Art
[1:21:18] going up but shall surely die and Elijah
[1:21:22] Departed
[1:21:23] watch this and when the messengers
[1:21:25] turned back unto him he said unto them
[1:21:28] why are you now turned back
[1:21:32] because they shouldn't have been back
[1:21:33] that fast
[1:21:34] right he says and they said unto him
[1:21:36] there came a man up to meet us
[1:21:39] and said unto us go and go turn again
[1:21:42] unto the king that sent you and say unto
[1:21:45] him thus saith the Lord
[1:21:47] is it not because there's not a God in
[1:21:49] Israel that thou send us to inquire
[1:21:51] bials above the god of ekron therefore
[1:21:54] Thou shalt not come down from that bed
[1:21:56] on which Thou Art going up but shall
[1:21:58] surely die
[1:22:00] and he said unto him what man of man was
[1:22:03] he which came up to meet you
[1:22:06] and told you these words
[1:22:08] and they answered him he was a he was a
[1:22:11] hairy man
[1:22:12] and Gert with a girdle of leather about
[1:22:15] his loins and he said everybody knew who
[1:22:17] it was
[1:22:18] it is Elijah the Tish bites
[1:22:22] then the king sent unto him a captain of
[1:22:25] 50 with his 50.
[1:22:27] and he went up to meet him and behold he
[1:22:29] sat on the top of an heel
[1:22:31] and he spake unto him thou man of God
[1:22:34] the king have said come down now I want
[1:22:38] us to stop there for a second
[1:22:40] right
[1:22:42] then the king sent unto him a captain of
[1:22:44] 50 with his 50. and he went up to him
[1:22:47] and behold he sat on the top of an heel
[1:22:50] and he spake unto him
[1:22:53] now a prophet actually helps us see a
[1:22:57] little bit more into this because when
[1:22:59] it says he spake unto him they were
[1:23:02] actually having dialogue
[1:23:05] they were actually having a conversation
[1:23:07] the conversation was not simply amen thy
[1:23:10] man of God the king of said come down it
[1:23:12] was more to the conversation than that
[1:23:15] and a prophet helps us look at that just
[1:23:17] a little bit so let's just find a just
[1:23:19] let's take this quote here really quick
[1:23:21] amen and and I will I will I will uh
[1:23:24] just help us to see just into this
[1:23:26] conversation a little bit more
[1:23:28] here I'm back at Warcraft speak amen and
[1:23:31] I'm dealing with a quote on Elijah here
[1:23:33] amen it says this Eli to the prophet of
[1:23:36] the Lord
[1:23:37] anointed oh yes God anointed him to be a
[1:23:41] prophet see it's how people are handling
[1:23:43] amen God's anointed the attitude of
[1:23:45] people towards God's Anointed God
[1:23:47] anointed him to be prophet he was Pastor
[1:23:51] Elijah I don't imagine Jezebel would
[1:23:54] have wanted to call him that
[1:23:57] Jezebel didn't want him to be her pastor
[1:23:59] but yet he was amen I don't imagine
[1:24:02] Jezebel would have uh wanted to call him
[1:24:04] that but he was her pastor just the same
[1:24:07] God made him her pastor now when we read
[1:24:12] the scripture understand something uh
[1:24:14] Ahab had already died but Jezebel was
[1:24:17] still living
[1:24:19] my God Amen Jezebel was still living so
[1:24:22] her influence was still in the land now
[1:24:24] watch this hey the prophet helps us see
[1:24:26] these things and man he says this uh uh
[1:24:29] he was a pastor just the same God made
[1:24:33] him her pastor so she hated him and God
[1:24:37] told him said you go up on the mountain
[1:24:39] and you sit down there I commanded the
[1:24:42] crows to feature I will water you from
[1:24:43] the brook Terror and he sat down there
[1:24:46] and the King said go get that fanatic
[1:24:49] and bring him down here and the soldiers
[1:24:52] are armed with the command of the king
[1:24:54] they started up the hill and uh he says
[1:24:56] Elisha which means Elijah probably
[1:24:58] raised up and said something like this
[1:25:00] gentlemen he raised up he's having a
[1:25:03] conversation with him gentlemen this is
[1:25:06] a holy spot now he's talking to these 50
[1:25:09] the first 50. gentlemen this is a holy
[1:25:12] spot I've been called of God to be his
[1:25:14] prophet
[1:25:16] he's commissioned me to stand on these
[1:25:18] grounds and Proclaim his message and the
[1:25:21] message that I have for you don't you
[1:25:22] approach this Crown amen stay off of
[1:25:26] here the uncircumcised have you not read
[1:25:29] when Moses the servant Lord crossed over
[1:25:31] the river and the uncircumcised tribe
[1:25:33] impersonate him they all drowned stay
[1:25:36] off this ground
[1:25:39] watch this
[1:25:41] oh they said that old quack what school
[1:25:43] is he from we would go anyhow Elijah
[1:25:46] said if I be a man of God
[1:25:49] that let fire fall from Heaven and
[1:25:51] vindicate my Ministry and about that
[1:25:54] time fire fell and burnt up 50 the king
[1:25:57] might have said lightning struck them so
[1:25:59] he sent another 50 and the same thing
[1:26:01] happened let's look at it let's keep
[1:26:03] reading in the scripture let's go back
[1:26:05] to the scripture
[1:26:06] the prophet helps us see that he's
[1:26:08] telling him this is Holy Ground don't
[1:26:10] cross that line don't go across that
[1:26:12] spot watch your attitude my brother
[1:26:16] watch your attitude don't don't don't do
[1:26:18] that now I mean I'm a prophet of God and
[1:26:20] I know I'm standing here with thus says
[1:26:22] the Lord so don't cross the line I know
[1:26:24] you're on King's orders but you better
[1:26:26] watch your attitude
[1:26:28] can I put it this way you don't know who
[1:26:29] you're dealing with Elijah can tell him
[1:26:31] that you don't know who you're dealing
[1:26:33] with I don't know what God y'all serve
[1:26:35] down there but this is the real true and
[1:26:37] living God don't play with him
[1:26:40] I know you're trying to do your job but
[1:26:42] just even in doing your job you got to
[1:26:44] do it with the right attitude
[1:26:47] let's go on
[1:26:50] amen
[1:26:53] so he says this in verse 9 then the king
[1:26:57] uh Ascend unto him a captain of 50 with
[1:26:59] his 50. and it went up to him and behold
[1:27:02] he sat on the top of a hill and he's
[1:27:04] speaking to him thou man of God the king
[1:27:06] upset come down
[1:27:08] and Elijah answered and said to the
[1:27:11] captain of 50 if I be a man of God
[1:27:14] then let Fire come down from heaven and
[1:27:17] consume thee and thy 50 and there came
[1:27:19] down fire from heaven and consumed him
[1:27:21] in his 50. that all 50 of them have the
[1:27:23] wrong attitude
[1:27:25] now look again also he sent up unto him
[1:27:29] another captain of 50 because maybe
[1:27:30] thinking well they died because it just
[1:27:32] so happened lightning struck that spot
[1:27:33] that I mean how you know that per chance
[1:27:36] that happened no it wasn't per chance
[1:27:38] God was vindicating the prophets
[1:27:40] Ministry
[1:27:41] watch this again also it's it's a
[1:27:44] synonym another captain of 50. with his
[1:27:46] 50. and the answer to send him old man
[1:27:49] of God thus half the king said come down
[1:27:53] quickly
[1:27:54] tired of waiting on you
[1:27:57] and Elijah answered and maybe he told
[1:27:59] him the same thing now this is a holy
[1:28:01] spot now you saw what just happened to
[1:28:03] the other 50. now it'll happen to you if
[1:28:06] you don't approach it the right way and
[1:28:08] maybe maybe this guy thought he was just
[1:28:09] no no I I got a job to do the king sent
[1:28:12] me to get you I'm taking you back down I
[1:28:14] got these 50 men to carry you back down
[1:28:16] he says he goes and says it again he
[1:28:18] lands Elijah answered and said unto them
[1:28:20] if I
[1:28:22] be a man of God my God let Fire come
[1:28:26] down y'all thought it was lightning but
[1:28:28] it's the prophet calling for it
[1:28:32] amen if I be a man of God let Fire come
[1:28:35] down from heaven and consume thee and
[1:28:38] thou fifty and the fire of God came down
[1:28:40] from heaven and consumed him in his 50.
[1:28:45] bad attitude
[1:28:47] verse 13 and he sent again this is the
[1:28:50] third time
[1:28:51] a captain of the third 50 with his 50.
[1:28:55] and the third captain of 50.
[1:28:58] went up
[1:29:00] and came
[1:29:02] and fell on his knees this man has the
[1:29:09] right attitude
[1:29:12] and his life is spared not only his life
[1:29:15] Spirit but the life of the 50 men that
[1:29:17] follow him are spared because this man
[1:29:20] demonstrated
[1:29:21] the right attitude
[1:29:24] and look at this he says
[1:29:26] in the third captain of 50 went up and
[1:29:28] it came and fell on his knees before
[1:29:29] Elijah and besought him and said to him
[1:29:31] oh man of God
[1:29:33] I pray thee
[1:29:37] let my life
[1:29:40] and the life of these 50 thy servants
[1:29:43] oh this man acting like a savior he's
[1:29:46] standing in the gap for 50 other men
[1:29:48] look at this man look at look at his
[1:29:50] attitude let let let let my life and the
[1:29:53] life of these 50 thy servants be
[1:29:55] precious
[1:29:58] in thy sight
[1:30:00] and look at what he said behold
[1:30:02] there came fire down from heaven
[1:30:06] and birthed up the two captains of the
[1:30:09] former 50s because they never made it
[1:30:10] back to the camp
[1:30:11] we noticed that burnt burnt up the the
[1:30:14] the captain of the former 50s with their
[1:30:17] 50s therefore let my life now be
[1:30:19] precious in thy sight
[1:30:22] an angel lord said in the yard to go
[1:30:25] down with him be not afraid of him and
[1:30:27] he arose and went down with him unto the
[1:30:29] king and he said unto him thus saith the
[1:30:32] Lord for as much as thou has sent
[1:30:33] messages to inquire bials about the God
[1:30:35] of ekron is it not because there is no
[1:30:37] God in Israel inquire of his word
[1:30:40] therefore thou shall not come down off
[1:30:42] that bed on which Thou Art going up but
[1:30:45] shall surely die actually this man
[1:30:48] ahazia had the wrong attitude
[1:30:52] towards God's anointed this is why he
[1:30:54] was going to a false god
[1:30:56] can I say this now and let me say this
[1:30:59] because I feel like the Holy Spirit
[1:31:00] telling me to say it you don't need to
[1:31:02] go
[1:31:04] to
[1:31:06] a a a crystal ball reader
[1:31:12] you don't need to be calling no
[1:31:14] telephone numbers and having somebody
[1:31:16] trying to read your future
[1:31:19] amen
[1:31:20] you come you if you got a problem that
[1:31:23] bad come see the ministry
[1:31:26] but don't you be running out after gods
[1:31:28] of equine
[1:31:31] amen
[1:31:32] that'll bring death to you
[1:31:34] amen
[1:31:36] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:31:40] amen amen amen all right let me see here
[1:31:46] I got another one
[1:31:48] another one that had a real bad a bad
[1:31:49] attitude towards God's anointed remember
[1:31:52] the story
[1:31:53] is actually his name is
[1:31:55] shimmy that's actually the name I looked
[1:31:58] it up in the Hebrew it's shimmy I used
[1:32:00] to call him chimei
[1:32:01] but it's shimmy
[1:32:04] shimmy had a terrible attitude
[1:32:07] shimmy was related to Saul
[1:32:10] and when David was being cast off of the
[1:32:12] throne because of his his son absenton
[1:32:14] had risen up against him Davis on the
[1:32:16] Run shimmy met him in the in in on the
[1:32:19] run and Sherman began to say see you you
[1:32:22] was no good in the first place we should
[1:32:25] have never had you as our King and he
[1:32:27] began to pick up rocks and stones and
[1:32:30] bottles and sticks and just whatever he
[1:32:32] could find just throwing them at David
[1:32:34] throwing throwing dust at David you you
[1:32:37] son of Belial you this and you that you
[1:32:41] should have never been the been a leader
[1:32:43] in the first place
[1:32:46] shimmy was just going off and finally
[1:32:48] there was uh one of David's men say
[1:32:51] should I let that dead dog head stay on
[1:32:53] his body let me go over there and take
[1:32:55] it off and David had to tell him to say
[1:32:56] look stop shedding blood he said maybe
[1:32:59] God allowed him to say what he's saying
[1:33:02] because God wants to test me
[1:33:05] I'ma say something God allows certain
[1:33:08] tests to come to the church
[1:33:10] let's see how we're gonna how we're
[1:33:12] gonna respond how we're gonna react we
[1:33:14] got to keep the right attitude
[1:33:25] I want to show you how David had the
[1:33:27] right attitude let me just let me just
[1:33:28] catch this
[1:33:29] oh I just I love the Lord I'm I'ma slip
[1:33:33] through this pretty quick but David
[1:33:37] one time desired to build God a house
[1:33:41] and when he when he when he when he he
[1:33:43] told his plan and you know he went to
[1:33:46] the prophet and the prophet actually
[1:33:48] gave him instruction the prophet Nathan
[1:33:50] gave him instructors say you know do all
[1:33:53] that is in thine heart God is with you
[1:33:56] he wanting to build God a house is it do
[1:33:59] all that is in thine heart because God
[1:34:01] is with you but now when you when you
[1:34:03] look at it in Scripture
[1:34:05] the prophet leaves David's uh uh uh
[1:34:08] company and he goes that night and God
[1:34:10] gives him a dream and in the dream God
[1:34:12] tells Nathan tell my servant David that
[1:34:15] he is not to build the house now I know
[1:34:18] you just told him that it was okay for
[1:34:20] him to do what was in his heart but he
[1:34:21] said about not go back and tell him not
[1:34:23] that I don't want him to build a house
[1:34:25] because he shed too much blood but I am
[1:34:27] going to allow his son to build the
[1:34:30] house now here David amen if his
[1:34:32] attitude was wrong when Nathan came back
[1:34:35] and told him this now he could if if he
[1:34:38] would have the bad attitude he would say
[1:34:39] now didn't you just tell me yesterday
[1:34:42] to do all that's in my heart because God
[1:34:45] is with me now you show him back up
[1:34:46] today and you're going to tell me not to
[1:34:49] do it what kind of prophet are you
[1:34:51] if David would have had a bad attitude
[1:34:53] he would have questioned the prophet
[1:34:56] but because he had the right attitude he
[1:34:58] didn't question the prophet he agreed
[1:35:01] with the prophet and David knowing that
[1:35:03] he would not be able to build God a
[1:35:05] house he still did something that showed
[1:35:08] he had the right attitude he put his
[1:35:10] actions behind his attitude
[1:35:14] you want to know what David did
[1:35:16] David made preparation
[1:35:19] for the house to be built he's he gave
[1:35:23] his money for a future generation
[1:35:28] I'ma say that again
[1:35:30] David gave his money for a future
[1:35:34] generation
[1:35:38] he store all kind of goodies
[1:35:41] he wanted them to be ready I don't want
[1:35:43] y'all to have to spend no money to build
[1:35:45] a church I might have money already set
[1:35:48] aside for you to do it
[1:35:51] that was his attitude
[1:35:55] he could he could have got really really
[1:35:57] upset with the with guys anointed but no
[1:35:59] he made preparation based on the words
[1:36:01] that he received I just love the word of
[1:36:04] God let's look at something here
[1:36:08] oh my
[1:36:13] god let's go back to the scripture
[1:36:16] acts 7 35 now as we're picking this up
[1:36:21] in Acts seven this is what we read
[1:36:23] earlier
[1:36:25] as we're picking this up we're we're
[1:36:27] seeing
[1:36:28] amen a problem with the attitude of the
[1:36:31] people towards God's anointed which was
[1:36:33] Moses
[1:36:35] you can just
[1:36:38] just look at how they they talking
[1:36:41] some of the things they're saying now
[1:36:44] the person that is giving this
[1:36:46] recollection
[1:36:48] of what happened here in scripture is is
[1:36:50] is Stephen
[1:36:52] and the reason Stephen is giving this
[1:36:54] recollection is because the religious
[1:36:56] leaders
[1:36:57] have an attitude with Deacon Stephen
[1:37:04] is God's anointed
[1:37:07] come on somebody but these people have a
[1:37:10] problem with the beacon
[1:37:13] so the Deacon is now just rehearsing
[1:37:16] some things to them walking them through
[1:37:18] their history
[1:37:20] come on somebody amen and I just need to
[1:37:23] forewarn you don't get an attitude
[1:37:25] with the deacon when he's doing his job
[1:37:29] [Music]
[1:37:30] let me also say it like this so
[1:37:33] everybody was clear we don't have people
[1:37:35] positioned to be figureheads
[1:37:40] they actually do the work
[1:37:45] so don't get mad at the Deacon when he's
[1:37:46] doing his job
[1:37:48] sometimes the Deacon might have to tell
[1:37:50] you because you sit here because you sit
[1:37:52] there because you do this could you do
[1:37:53] it and he's doing that for a reason you
[1:37:55] might not understand why he do it why
[1:37:57] every time I come in here he picking on
[1:37:59] me your attitude
[1:38:01] [Music]
[1:38:03] will block you from getting a blessing
[1:38:05] but if you just come here Lord wherever
[1:38:07] you want me to sit yeah because maybe in
[1:38:10] the place that you sit when the
[1:38:11] atmosphere you create might help that
[1:38:14] person that day so always be flexible
[1:38:22] amen
[1:38:27] man sister know her skirt Too Short
[1:38:29] don't sit up close like this right if so
[1:38:31] the pastor can see right between your
[1:38:32] legs don't do that hello
[1:38:35] amen don't do that we still trying to
[1:38:38] live holy here
[1:38:40] your sister come in with a mini skirt on
[1:38:43] don't put up in the front
[1:38:44] no actually back in the old days your
[1:38:47] sister came in church like that y'all
[1:38:48] know what they used to do
[1:38:51] see they had sheets
[1:38:54] they had white sheets and you knew when
[1:38:57] you was wearing a white sheet what that
[1:39:00] meant
[1:39:02] y'all ain't gonna talk to me today
[1:39:04] [Music]
[1:39:04] [Applause]
[1:39:14] come on somebody but you didn't have to
[1:39:16] get upset with the church all you had to
[1:39:18] do was dress right
[1:39:19] [Applause]
[1:39:24] you got to make some adjustments with
[1:39:26] your attitude
[1:39:35] Stephen was
[1:39:38] telling them all about you know what had
[1:39:40] happened in their history and man they
[1:39:42] got so mad at Stephen
[1:39:45] they got so upset with Stephen that you
[1:39:48] know what we ain't gonna We they was
[1:39:50] sometimes people attitudes get so bad
[1:39:51] they will they they be they were
[1:39:54] literally kill you
[1:39:58] literally
[1:40:00] man if I could just get rid of their
[1:40:02] voice I don't want to hear their voice
[1:40:04] no more these people are stoned Steven
[1:40:06] to death Paul was right there watching
[1:40:09] it all happen
[1:40:11] but they stoned them to death because of
[1:40:13] the attitude because he rebuked them in
[1:40:15] the word
[1:40:17] Sarah if you ever get rebuked in the
[1:40:19] word is because God loves you he only he
[1:40:21] only chastises and chases those that and
[1:40:23] rebukes them that he loves
[1:40:26] so we need to adjust our attitude Lord I
[1:40:29] Thank you that you care for me so much
[1:40:30] that you want me to be right
[1:40:33] look at this
[1:40:36] he was telling him here in verse um
[1:40:40] verse 35.
[1:40:43] this Moses whom they refused
[1:40:48] this Moses whom they refuse and see
[1:40:50] remember this was brother branham's you
[1:40:52] know inspiration when he was preaching
[1:40:54] why Christ speak is with the the
[1:40:55] attitude of P of of of people towards
[1:40:58] God's anointed look at what they said
[1:41:00] this Moses whom they refuse
[1:41:03] he said who made thee a ruler and a
[1:41:05] judge
[1:41:06] we'll call you Moses
[1:41:08] who made you to be over us
[1:41:11] the same did God send to be ruler they
[1:41:14] saw all the supernatural signs that
[1:41:15] would follow Moses right the the the the
[1:41:18] same that God sent to be a ruler and a
[1:41:20] deliverer by the hand of the Angel which
[1:41:22] appeared to him in the bush
[1:41:27] he brought them out after that he had
[1:41:29] showed wanders and signs in the land of
[1:41:31] Egypt and you know Moses standing at the
[1:41:34] at the at the burning bush and and um
[1:41:36] and when he stood there he heard divorce
[1:41:38] tell him to take off your shoes you're
[1:41:40] on Holy Ground they heard the testimony
[1:41:42] of the supernatural with Moses why are
[1:41:44] they coming against that Supernatural
[1:41:46] did God I mean did Moses send himself or
[1:41:49] did God send him
[1:41:51] amen now there was a time in Moses life
[1:41:53] where he tried to do it on his own he
[1:41:56] tried to kill Egyptians just one at a
[1:41:57] time but that wasn't God's plan
[1:42:00] and that's why he took off running to
[1:42:01] the Wilderness he was out of the will of
[1:42:03] God oh hallelujah amen Moses made
[1:42:07] mistaken had to run to the Wilderness
[1:42:09] but it did not take away who he was in
[1:42:12] God
[1:42:14] Stay With Me
[1:42:17] it didn't take away who he was in God
[1:42:20] amen he was still God's delivery he was
[1:42:23] still God's man look at this
[1:42:26] verse 36 he brought them out after that
[1:42:29] he had showed wonders and signs in the
[1:42:30] land of Egypt and in the Red Sea and in
[1:42:32] the wilderness 40 years this is that
[1:42:35] Moses
[1:42:36] which said unto the children of Israel I
[1:42:39] Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up
[1:42:40] unto you of your brethren like unto me
[1:42:43] him shall ye hear and that was the Lord
[1:42:45] Jesus was feeling that right it says
[1:42:47] this is he that was in the church in the
[1:42:50] wilderness with that which uh with the
[1:42:51] angel which spake to him in the Mount
[1:42:53] Sinai with and with our fathers who
[1:42:56] receive the living oracles to give it us
[1:42:58] the Ten Commandments right to whom our
[1:43:01] fathers who would look at this to my
[1:43:03] fathers would not obey all this
[1:43:05] Supernatural
[1:43:07] but yet the people want to be remember
[1:43:09] even while it was out there Nathan and
[1:43:11] core rose up
[1:43:12] so you got to watch the attitude as
[1:43:15] Nathan and cork rise up and they say you
[1:43:17] know what you ain't the only Holy One
[1:43:19] Among Us
[1:43:20] God speak to me too yeah you ain't the
[1:43:23] only one God speak to around here Moses
[1:43:26] God can speak to me
[1:43:29] and then they got all these people on
[1:43:31] their side
[1:43:33] come on church that's right you can
[1:43:35] imagine what they were talking about um
[1:43:37] in the camps
[1:43:38] going from house to house and having a
[1:43:41] little fellowship with each other and
[1:43:43] all the things they talking about my God
[1:43:45] you think Moses think he's the only one
[1:43:46] anointed amen you anointed too Nathan
[1:43:49] you anointed too Cora
[1:43:51] they just building up their psyche
[1:43:54] but God had not called taken Accord to
[1:43:56] that position everybody got to know
[1:43:59] which role they called to
[1:44:01] and when you know your old respect the
[1:44:04] other roles
[1:44:06] but here they got into a little spirit
[1:44:09] they come up amongst them like this I'm
[1:44:11] just preaching the Bible yeah
[1:44:13] this little Spirit get in on the amongst
[1:44:16] them and and they just feel like well we
[1:44:18] can challenge Moses
[1:44:22] you know what we got 250 renowned men
[1:44:26] the Bible say I mean they they great men
[1:44:28] amongst the people they said we're going
[1:44:30] to go against this most we tired of him
[1:44:31] trying to leave us like this he ain't
[1:44:33] the only one Anointed God spoke to me
[1:44:34] too
[1:44:35] well
[1:44:37] motor say uh you know I tell you what
[1:44:39] y'all say what that that God speak to
[1:44:42] y'all too not all these things y'all are
[1:44:44] seeing God vindicating my Ministry and
[1:44:47] now y'all gonna come up and say
[1:44:48] something like this
[1:44:49] say what has God done for you what's
[1:44:51] your testimony
[1:44:53] well he did this when it don't even
[1:44:55] compare
[1:44:57] well Moses Moses said I'll tell you what
[1:44:59] I tell you what we're gonna have one
[1:45:00] final Vindication right here right now
[1:45:05] if God is with me
[1:45:07] y'all gonna die death that ain't nobody
[1:45:09] ever died
[1:45:11] he say the Earth will open up and
[1:45:14] swallow you right now
[1:45:17] so now everybody that is on the Lord's
[1:45:19] Side not Moses site but if you're on the
[1:45:21] Lord's Side because you see the Lord
[1:45:22] vindicating then come over here now in
[1:45:25] the Bible actually amen it says that uh
[1:45:27] uh uh Nathan and Cora's Sons but they're
[1:45:31] a group of Sons of dathan that did not
[1:45:33] go down of course sons that didn't go
[1:45:34] down they went to God's side
[1:45:39] after Moses spoke it out of his mouth
[1:45:41] the same spoken word creation that was
[1:45:43] in Egypt was now in the wilderness
[1:45:47] the Earth opened up swallowed these men
[1:45:50] up why because they had
[1:45:53] the wrong
[1:45:54] attitude and let me tell you something
[1:45:57] about a bad attitude
[1:45:59] it can easily
[1:46:02] be contagious
[1:46:06] but let me tell you something about a
[1:46:07] good attitude
[1:46:08] it can easily
[1:46:10] be contagious
[1:46:19] let me just read a little bit from the
[1:46:21] prophet here
[1:46:25] actually I just want to read just a two
[1:46:28] two two quotes here and and I'll I'll
[1:46:31] close it off but and they're they're
[1:46:33] they are a little lengthy but I think
[1:46:34] it's it's beneficial
[1:46:37] the attitude of people towards God's
[1:46:39] anointed that was the that was the
[1:46:41] prophet's inspiration
[1:46:46] how did he get that
[1:46:48] but you know he went through so much
[1:46:50] with people
[1:46:51] look at what he says here and why Christ
[1:46:53] speak he says
[1:46:58] and God it caused such a man and that
[1:47:01] man was Moses but Moses a great deal
[1:47:04] like us
[1:47:06] every time it come a place that
[1:47:08] something had to be done Moses called
[1:47:10] out oh Lord what must I do in this place
[1:47:15] Now isn't that just like we do God had
[1:47:19] blessed him and anointed him above his
[1:47:21] Brethren give him a message and a
[1:47:22] minister that had had not been on the
[1:47:24] earth since that day until that day and
[1:47:27] yet every time something taking place
[1:47:29] Moses went off to God with it Lord what
[1:47:31] must I do what must I do in this case
[1:47:34] God got kind of tired of it I really
[1:47:37] said why are you crying to me speaking
[1:47:39] speak to the people and go for it my if
[1:47:42] any time if ever looked like they ought
[1:47:46] to retreat was then
[1:47:48] Pharaoh's Army behind them Red Sea in
[1:47:51] front of them if there was ever time for
[1:47:52] them to retreat it was then but he says
[1:47:54] but God
[1:47:56] has no retreat
[1:47:59] can we put it God and got that in his
[1:48:01] vote it's not in his dictionary Retreat
[1:48:04] Retreat from what
[1:48:06] no we go forward
[1:48:08] God has no retreat there's no place to
[1:48:11] retreat in God go forward the doctor
[1:48:14] says it's cancer go forward if he says
[1:48:18] it's TB go for if the devil says you
[1:48:21] can't give this up go forth if your home
[1:48:25] says that you're going to be a fanatic
[1:48:27] go forward the church turns you out go
[1:48:31] forward there's no retreat in back go
[1:48:34] forward praise God speak and go forward
[1:48:40] speak what
[1:48:42] speak what his word and go forward
[1:48:46] that's Faith the Lord
[1:48:48] and move on
[1:48:50] cry to the people but the people then
[1:48:52] rebelled and said it would have been
[1:48:54] better that we died down here down in
[1:48:58] Egypt it had been better than uh that we
[1:49:01] had our grades marked then from the
[1:49:03] hyenas and the vultures that picked our
[1:49:05] bones in the wilderness why did you
[1:49:07] bring us out here after they had seen
[1:49:09] that God had approved Moses to be a
[1:49:11] servant when God comes into a person or
[1:49:14] to a person into a congregation into a
[1:49:17] man or woman he vindicates his presence
[1:49:19] God proves that he's there for when God
[1:49:21] comes Supernatural signs begin to appear
[1:49:24] this person becomes a changed person
[1:49:28] that's what happened at the Johnson home
[1:49:30] this week
[1:49:31] amen it's God that came amen this person
[1:49:35] becomes a changed person they're not no
[1:49:38] more like they used to be
[1:49:40] sin
[1:49:41] sin has vanished from their life fear
[1:49:45] and doubt has vanished frustration
[1:49:47] they're solid stable liver die it's
[1:49:51] Christ they don't care what comes of
[1:49:53] what goes nothing shakes them they move
[1:49:55] forward
[1:49:56] I like that Moses spread it with the
[1:49:59] people
[1:50:01] and the People Credit to Moses now you
[1:50:03] you know we read during the scripture I
[1:50:04] didn't finish reading there and and acts
[1:50:06] but they got to a spot where they said
[1:50:08] it this Moses this Moses this Moses
[1:50:12] we don't even know what happened to him
[1:50:15] get that
[1:50:17] the language in their mouth this Moses
[1:50:20] what you mean this you mean the
[1:50:22] deliverer I mean y'all y'all forgot
[1:50:24] about the whips that were hitting your
[1:50:26] back and all the slavery that you was
[1:50:28] under the bondage and this Moses is the
[1:50:31] one that delivered you and now all of a
[1:50:33] sudden you ain't got nothing else better
[1:50:34] to say
[1:50:36] we don't even know what what happened to
[1:50:38] him
[1:50:39] make us a God so we can go back to Egypt
[1:50:41] what look what look at the attitude of
[1:50:43] the people now I want to tell you
[1:50:45] something because Moses was up in the
[1:50:47] mountain getting them them
[1:50:48] um them Ten Commandments and while he
[1:50:51] was getting the Ten Commandments I mean
[1:50:52] written by the thing of God
[1:50:55] Moses got him he's getting ready to
[1:50:56] carrying back down Joshua hear noise in
[1:50:59] the camp
[1:51:00] Joshua get excited he'd say oh Moses man
[1:51:04] there's some rejoicing going on down
[1:51:05] there
[1:51:06] Moses said
[1:51:09] that don't sound right
[1:51:14] that don't seem right
[1:51:19] Moses and no Joshua something ain't
[1:51:21] right about the sound
[1:51:23] so it had to be Moses come down and when
[1:51:26] he saw what was going on the camp he
[1:51:28] took them stones and threw him down he
[1:51:30] now he had a bad attitude
[1:51:34] same thing that was written with the
[1:51:35] finger I said can I can I'm just I'm
[1:51:37] gonna drop these things in here so some
[1:51:39] here
[1:51:40] your reaction to an action
[1:51:44] has to be better
[1:51:46] than the action itself because if your
[1:51:48] reaction is not right
[1:51:52] you can lose a lot of people
[1:51:58] oh man
[1:52:00] I'm preaching and I know I am
[1:52:04] I know I'm preaching
[1:52:07] I know I know I got the devil right
[1:52:09] where I want him
[1:52:10] yeah he ain't gonna get no glory here
[1:52:13] [Applause]
[1:52:17] and and I tell you right now ain't gonna
[1:52:18] be no division here
[1:52:20] We Stand United in Christ
[1:52:23] not here
[1:52:28] I need to uh I'm gonna keep reading this
[1:52:30] quote because there's something I need
[1:52:32] to get to there but but but when um when
[1:52:35] Moses is coming down you know and he
[1:52:37] hears this sounds like no that ain't the
[1:52:38] right sound Joshua and he and he sees
[1:52:41] the people dancing around this calf
[1:52:44] they've how did this happen I've been
[1:52:46] only been going 40 days how did the
[1:52:49] people come to this in 40 days
[1:52:52] it probably upset Moses like I don't
[1:52:54] know what and this is why he threw the
[1:52:56] through the storm like no no no Moses
[1:52:58] don't don't handle it like that because
[1:52:59] now you're gonna have to go back into
[1:53:01] the mountain that was the word of God
[1:53:02] that you threw at them people now you
[1:53:04] got to go back in the mountain this time
[1:53:05] God is not going to uh come down with
[1:53:08] his finger and right on the Rock guess
[1:53:11] who's gonna have to write on the rock
[1:53:13] you gonna ride on the Rock carve out
[1:53:15] every one of them Commandments you know
[1:53:18] you know it's like it's like that when
[1:53:19] we were coming up in school if you lost
[1:53:22] control of your temper
[1:53:24] you have to sit there and write 100
[1:53:26] times
[1:53:28] I will have self-control
[1:53:30] I will have self-control and you better
[1:53:34] not miss one line teacher counting them
[1:53:36] all you better come back well all of
[1:53:38] them written you know what you know how
[1:53:40] you gain self-control by not wanting to
[1:53:42] write that no more
[1:53:45] but Moses had to sit there right at each
[1:53:48] commandment
[1:53:54] Moses fretted with the people the people
[1:53:56] Frederick with Frederick the Moses he
[1:53:58] said what we what must we uh do go
[1:54:01] forward was the answer now they said we
[1:54:03] are out in the wilderness and the armies
[1:54:05] of pharaohs approaching us they're
[1:54:06] camped just behind us but Moses knew to
[1:54:08] obey God and if God sends a
[1:54:10] representative in the anoints is
[1:54:12] represented and sends it into the world
[1:54:14] the people must obey that representative
[1:54:17] it's always been that way all down
[1:54:20] through the Bible Moses is called for
[1:54:22] the job God has said in the word he
[1:54:26] would do it he promised that he would
[1:54:27] send such a thing in that day amen uh to
[1:54:31] deliver them and God did his part sent
[1:54:33] Moses and the children of Israel just
[1:54:36] because little stumbles in things come
[1:54:39] along to try them they fail to march
[1:54:42] with Moses look at it amen they failed
[1:54:44] to march with Moses Now isn't that just
[1:54:46] like today we see the message come forth
[1:54:49] we see the church rise to a place on the
[1:54:52] wings of the Holy Spirit until the power
[1:54:53] of God Thrills every person in here the
[1:54:57] glory of God Falls around and signs and
[1:54:59] wonders take place less than a week
[1:55:04] Satan
[1:55:06] is permitted
[1:55:09] to come into that congregation
[1:55:12] why does he do it God
[1:55:15] permits it
[1:55:18] and then the church
[1:55:21] begins to murmur
[1:55:23] fall back
[1:55:25] maybe it wasn't so there's where we fail
[1:55:29] that's the failing of the church look at
[1:55:31] this regardless
[1:55:34] of what takes place
[1:55:37] is God
[1:55:39] so what's your response
[1:55:43] move forward
[1:55:48] why Christ speak
[1:55:51] move forwards
[1:55:54] I got another quote to read but I'ma

[1:56:11] we are determined to move forward
[1:56:14] we realize Satan is he can do you give
[1:56:16] him permission to do certain things but
[1:56:18] if we're wise enough to recognize the
[1:56:21] enemy
[1:56:23] God then we know that he can't do
[1:56:25] anything to stop us
[1:56:27] we are the Invincible Army because
[1:56:30] that's what you've made us we stand
