right just want to thank you uh Brother David sister Hannah for ubering around brother Jin says they are the ones who are going to be the Uber taking me around and happy to see the team the girls there sister esta and and team amen I call them team they once visited us when we were at brother David's place when it was sistern birthday so we had a good time together amen good to see you uh sisters amen uh we're going to read from the book of Matthew 27 I'm trying to combine things uh the the the message I want to preach is is like three things in one so let's see what it does hey things sometimes go wrong sister Hannah you have to do what you do what you do my laptop is refusing to open Matthew 27 uh uh let's go B basically to paragraph uh uh um verse 50 I think uh cuz cuz it's refusing to open but uh we we'll get it opened it's a devil fighting how can a laptop refuse to open okay Matthew 27 let's look at verse 50 what does it say and Jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up The Ghost and behold the veil of the temple was rained in Twain from top to bottom and the Earth did quake and the Rocks rent and the graves were opened and many bodies of the Saints which slept arose and came out of the Grave after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many now when the Centurion and they that were with him watching Jesus saw the earthquake and those things that were done they feared greatly saying truly this was the son of God Amen uh while we standing let us also read uh uh Romans 12 verse one so I'm I'm going to combine things because I only have today so I have to be very fast you'll bear with me I have to be to be cruising cuz for for for uh bra Jin we'll do three series of the same things so I'll compact them now uh uh sorry I was reading Corinthians it's Romans 12 yes I beseech you Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies as a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service amen we may be seated while I pray Heavenly Father we've read the scriptures may you help us in the little time that we have to break the bread of life that it will help us to be better in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen oh this thing is still misbehaving okay then I have to switch it off then switch it on okay so when I came into us we were launching our 45 days of uh Covenant prayer of dedication so uh this year I was telling them at brain this year in our church we started Covenant programs I think the theme of the year we put it we said we're going to call it making achievements through Covenant prayers yeah so um I learned to I learned that these prayers that we pray sometimes today you pray tomorrow you don't all right they they they're not very effective uh the scripture says uh in uh Hebrews I think 11 verse 6 it says uh they that come to God must know that he is and a rewarder of them that diligently seek him where we fail usually is we do seek him but we don't seek Him diligently so so when you make covenant programs you find that it automatically makes you diligent yes for example look at Daniel I think it's chapter 10 the Bible says he he he started praying and uh uh G him himself to pray for 21 uh for three full weeks he actually says three full weeks there's a word full there every day of those three three weeks every day he was praying amen so you find he made a covenant he made a plan he he made uh uh an agreement with God and himself so automatically he had to honor his part and as long as he honors his part God will also honor his part sometimes the scripture also says when two people agree as touching anything here on Earth it shall be done in heaven so you can agree to say me and my husband we're going to pray three days we'll fast for the pastor for the anointing for the church you will see more Effectiveness in such kind of prayers amen so I just thought of sharing this with you the day we we started our prayer that's Wednesday when I just landed in US my first night in us we started we were launching our 45 days of Prayer dedication of ourselves and uh before that from January to beginning April we had 90 days of uh repentance every household should have picked one hour from uh uh uh 8 9 p.m. or uh no no no no what was that yeah 8:00 p.m. to 6: a.m. the following day each household should pick one hour to pray and then we we were praying repentance worship warfare prayer request every 1 hour every day for 90 days so after that uh so we even created a group which we're going prayer relay so when you finish when you start you post TK start starting in in the group and when you finish you say done another one says starting another one says done all the way up to the morning amen I believe uh such kind of prayers as the bride of Christ will achieve more Glory so let's consider that that night when we we did when I did that the first night when we were launching the the prayer dedication in that night I had a dream I dreamed an angel appeared to me in the dream and I was asking him questions uh and and one of the things that I asked him was what am I supposed to do I was trying to do something then he told me don't do that that's not your area your job is to encourage the children of God Amen so I'm here to encourage you uh in the faith so that you are EMB bettered amen praise God Amen uh and I'm seeing the grace of God that way uh sometimes when you are so much in prayer God is close you can hear God speak uh I usually hear testimonies from Sister Hannah she would tell me maybe I've been praying for a week and the Lord spoke this to me sometimes you would want God to speak to you but you're not in a state to hear God speaking you're so far away amen praise God Amen okay let's go to our subject my subject since it's a combined so it will be longer uh I'm getting the inspiration from that message that day on Calvary but um we'll make the title like this what Calvary meant and did and what we need to do for it amen what Calvary meant and did and what we have to do for it so there are three things there the prophet in the message that day on Calvary talks about three aspects he says what it meant what it did and what are you going to do for it amen right praise God Amen so let us read Isaiah uh chapter 6 it's still part of the story and then I load all the bullets uh we shoot a bit and uh we reach check some quotes and shoot a bit amen Isaiah chapter 6 in the year that King oah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and the trains filled the temple above it stood the seraphim each one had six wings with Twain he covered his face with Twain he covered his feet with Twain he did fly one Cried unto another say holy holy holy is a lot of host the whole earth is full of his glory and the P of a door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said I what is me for I'm undone because I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphim unto me having a live coal in his hand which he took taken from the altar uh with the tongues from off the Altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lord this has touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin purged amen did we read Romans chapter 12:1 oh okay so we can start shooting now so um uh some of the things that I want to say in the quotes but uh due to time some of them I'll just say them amen so uh when when Man was created God created man to stay in the presence of God all right to be in the uh Network just like a phone a phone has to be in a network for it to be effective amen amen so a human being was supposed to stay in the presence of God but because of sin they found themselves out of the presence of God and the prophet says Man became a Wanderer Hallelujah a wonder and a pilgrim are different a pilgrim knows where he's coming from and knows where he's going brother we are not wers sister we are not wers we are pilgrims amen we are on a journey going to where we know amen praise God Amen but Man became a Wanderer those days before that day on Calvary they wandered from daas to mountains they wandered all over and they cried and sought the the the the the good things that they had lost but it was nowhere to be found there was no way but the prophet says but man knew that if he could ever get back in the presence of God they will talk it over and the relationship will come back again but there was no way to go back to the presence of God but we thank God for that day on Calvary praise God Amen there came one from Glory his name is Jesus and he went all the way when when he reached Gethsemane he saw in the vision what he was going to go through but then he realized if I run away he was almost running away he he said Lord if it be thy will let this cup pass but he says oh not my will because he saw you he saw me he said if I run away that one will all be lost remember we were all scheduled for Slaughter we were all supposed to die the way Jesus died it was us who was supposed to be there but he did it for you and me amen praise God Amen he went to the cross for you and me and paid for our sins praise God Amen and brother Brenham says what did Calvary mean Calvary sorted out the sin question praise God Amen that mathematics which the scientists failed to solve Jesus came and solved it praise God Amen I don't know whether it was adma adma or oh just nor more math but it was a complicated P there was no way to solve it every scientist tried every anointed man every uh big man in the Bible they failed to solve the sin question praise God Amen we had a mighty man called David praise God Amen the man after God's Own Heart but he failed to sort out the sin question when sin came his way he failed to overcome praise God Amen but we thank God Jesus came and sorted out that question what was the question the penalty of sin was death right and for a man when you die it's all over it's all done so we were all scheduled to slaughter I was telling them there you know you like we were all like cows in an abator no matter how the cow would burst I'm the strongest in this abator I'm the most handsome you it doesn't matter because it's a matter of days a number of days three 4 days it will be in the PT praise God Amen the worldly people we don't care whether they they they Min when walking with their mini skats we don't care because it's just a few days they'll be in the fire praise God Amen Hallelujah this pride of life will end up in the fire praise God Amen but Jesus came and sorted out the sin question praise God Amen he went and died there on the cross and you know death was bursting throughout the ages every mighty man came there was Abraham there was all those Mighty Men oh there was Samson he would kill thousand Philistines but when death came it came like a bee and Stang him amen and he was no more and death was bursting all the time I'm the strongest I'm the strongest but one day somebody stronger than death came amen his name is Jesus praise God Amen When Death came and Stang Jesus it lost the sting wooo Hallelujah it lost the sting no more that's why Paul says death where is your sting where is your Victory I'm going to answer what Paul asked the sting of death was in Jesus he took it away and broke it it has no more power over you it has no more power over me Hallelujah there's no reason why you should be scared of death why you should be scared of anything praise God Amen death has lost the the war death has lost the battle and the prophet says when he died praise God Amen he went to hell and found that Wicked animal called Satan called the devil and he wanted to fight Jesus but he gave him a sidekick amen and he wounded that animal called Satan forever praise God Amen he is wounded forever he will not recover will never recover from that sidick praise God Amen for the backbone is broken the devil just pulls himself praise God Amen he cannot scare you my brother he cannot scare you my sister he is a BL praise God Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah Heen he wounded that animal called Satan called the devil once and for all praise God Amen that's what Calvary meant amen praise God Amen but what has he done what has Calvary done remember man was wondering no way to come in the presence of God no way to talk it over with God the Bible says the day that he died he cried with a loud voice praise God Amen and the veil in the temple was rained praise God aen not just rained anyhow but from top to bottom showing you that the one who's reing is above is God himself opening the way to the holy of holies praise God Amen hallelujah what about the holy of holies in the Old Testament there was the Holy place the holy of holies was separated by a veil right praise God Amen and outside it was called the outer court right that's the Temple of the Old Testament and then the holy of holies that's where you find you found the Ark of the Covenant and Shina Glory shining there and also you had the port of uh a Mana that was not rotting amen you remember when the Mana would fell in the old test if they keep it long it would rot but in there it was not rotting that's what you need my brother that's what you need my sister to be in the presence of God like when you're in the presence of God you are not going to rot we are not going to hear that brother has impregnanted girl or that sister was found drinking we're not going to hear that stench amen when you're in the presence of God you're going to stay fresh you're going to stay clean praise God Amen but right there also in the presence of God was the road of Aon the road of Aon was a dry dry stick yes sir praise God Amen your life can be dry your business can be dry but bring it in the presence of God praise Goden when they brought the dry stick there It produced leaves and It produced fruits and they even knew okay so this tree this stick was taken from the Tree of almans it prod produced hormons when you come in the presence of God we are going to see you're going to produce leaves you're going to produce fruits you're going to produce gifts then we are going to know that you were taken from the Tree of Prophecy we are going to know you were taken from a tree of speaking in tongues praise God amen hallelujah oh what you need my brother what you need my sister is to come in the presence of God come in the presence of God you say Preacher Man how do I get there praise God Amen you can get in the spirit praise God Amen by the way you're not supposed to even go Jesus says amen where are two or three are gathered in my name there am I in the midst so Jesus is here my brother Jesus is here my sister oh hallelujah praise God Amen may he open our eyes may he open your eyes so that you can see the glory of God you can see the presence of God Isaiah was in the temple and his eyes were opened and he says I saw the Lord praise God Amen Hallelujah he says I saw the Lord high and lifted up and the train of his glory was fill filled the whole house I believe that's what's happening right now when we gathered here the train of the glory of God is in this house praise God Amen where you're seated you don't have to push like that woman who says oh if only I can touch the H of His Garment she to thrive and push away but where you are just right where you are the train of his glory is right here you can touch the glory of God you can say Lord may I receive the healing power because a woman when she touched him instantly she was healed you can touch him in this service you can touch him in this meeting praise God Amen and you can be healed praise God Amen Hallelujah praise God my my my when they could enter into the holy of holies only the high priest once a year could enter there and there were rules don't just enter anyhow when you enter anyhow you die and if they if they if he dies behind the curtain no one will know so what they used to do they used to put bells on their feet so that when he's walking around the ark he will go holy holy get holy holy K holy holy K Hallelujah the bells will be ringing then they'll know that he's alive when it's quiet then they know he's dead that's why when we come in the house of God the Bible says the the cimes were shouting one to another they were saying holy holy holy that's what we are doing right now I'm shouting to you and you're shouting back you're saying hallelujah you're saying amen and I'm preaching to you we are in the house of God we are by the throne we are saying holy holy holy holy holy holy is a lot of hostes come on hallelujah praise God Amen Hallelujah but what if it's quiet in there it means the guy is dead and if he's dead how does he come out brother they used to tie them a rope because no one will go in to pull them out so if they hear Z quiet they just pull him out hallelujah praise God Amen I guess some of these Ministries we have to tie them up and pull them out of the pit praise God Amen Hallelujah even some of the Believers brother we have to tie them up and pull them outside because they are dead in the house of God praise God Amen can I hear some people that are alive hallelujah praise God Amen my my my my hallelujah oh oh praise God there are people who came in the presence of God my like uh Mary Simon invited Jesus and he didn't care about him but Mary saw that that is Jesus with dty feet and she says this is my chance you may be in a service like this others don't care about what's going on but you can care you can be like Mary you say I'll go and kneel down at his feet and cry and wash his feet with my tears where are the Maries of today Hallelujah who can cry before Jesus and when she cried and wiped away oh praise God Amen know the debt from the feet of Jesus he spoke those sweet words your sins which are many they are forgiven praise God Amen Hallelujah he's able to do the same for anyone who comes in the presence of God with a repentant heart praise God Amen and there was another guy who came in the presence of God his name was Jacob his name meant a crook he was a crook you can be a crook you can be a prostitute you can be a thief you can be a fighter but when you get a hold of that angel something can happen praise God Amen I remember I told them at Bon beach one day last time when I came I told them one day one of our preachers preached the he says you know whenever we gather the angel of the Lord comes down and most of us we get a hold of him but the problem is we let him go before he changes our name praise God Amen oh brother sister you can get a hold of the Angel tonight you can say Lord from this service things must change in my life I'm not going to be the same you can hold him and say change my name oh Hallelujah he will change your name from backbit to prophetes he will change your name from a thief to a preacher Hallelujah from a prostitute to a sister he's able to change your name Hallelujah just get a hold of the angel don't let him go you know when he preached like that in that service I said Lord we need a plot we need a plot where to build a church for you and uh you know we were coming from another town going to that church and then we told the pastor to say we're tired was was like getting to two to three years just traveling all the time going into another town like like the way we've driven like from Coral Springs to hear every service and you know in Zambia fuel is expensive and things so I told the pastor we need a place we need to start gathering in our town he says I'm not coming in your town unless you find a plot first because when I come there I want permanency so that day it was now getting months since we went to the council to look for a plot they were were not giving us so uh I said Lord I think today I'm going to get a hold of the Angel because you are here and the preacher has preached so I held the angel I went and knil down at the altar says I'm holding you today I will not let you go until you give us a plot Jesus I prayed and prayed that was uh we knocked off at 12:00 p.m. or or so I prayed and prayed I think by 2: or 3: p.m. they wanted to clean the place uh I just heard people come they wanted to sweep so I Rose from the altar I told the angel I'm going off the altar I'm not leaving you here so let's go I'll go out went out and waited praise Goen they waited for them to sweep and then I I came back I was holding something I says okay now we are back and they nailed down there prayed and prayed and prayed it was I think uh maybe 10:00 p.m. I got so tired I says okay Angel I think I need to rest a bit come here so went and sat and sat I started dozing I slept a bit I said I'm not letting you go until you bless me Hallelujah went on night till the morning praise God Amen and again it was going afternoon until evening wow then the pastor came with a team to have prayers on Monday after evening then they said you you didn't go home I said how can I go home when I don't we don't have a PL what I'm holding the angel I'll not let him go and then he told me oh okay I think God is just waiting for us to do that uh convention program and when we do that obviously that will be the next thing I said Lord if that is your word from your servant what I want I want a sign I want the council to call us and give us a plot without interviews so that's how I went uh back home you know it was another town so at work I just texted them uh sorry write me some leave I've got some important thing I'm still in another town so now this evening after that I went back two days 3 days later the cancel phoned Hallelujah they said are you people we've delayed you to get your plot just come and get without interviews and there we got it amen hallelujah praise Goden you can do the same my sister you can do the same my brother you can get a hold of the Angel you can say this is a rented place yes the angels have legs they walk you tell him I'm going with you home you have to go with me and when you reach home continue telling him what you want you're going to see results praise God Amen that's why we come in the presence of God we don't come here to show our suits Hallelujah they may be nice yes but come after 2 years it will be torn it's not necessary why we come here is to get a hold of the presence of God praise amen that's why we come in the house of God oh let it be you say like that woman oh if only I can touch the a of His Garment I shall be healed praise God Amen whenever you come to the house of God come with that attitude something is going to happen to you you're not going to be the same praise God Amen Hallelujah my my my Hallelujah okay I done 17 minutes so I still have a bit of time my my my hallelujah praise God so Jesus has sorted out the sin question am and he has opened the way to the presence of God that's what Calvary has done for us there's no reason why sin should reain in your life if sin is reigning in your life youve just been lazy the Bible says in Romans mortify the Deeds of the flesh give the Deeds of the flesh that's right if you let them alive they'll be alive yeah amen it takes you to do something about it I told you we were just repenting 90 days we were repenting my sister after those 90 days I don't care any sleep that's coming in front I don't pay attention I see demons almost saying come out devil but before that when you see a sleep you want to look clearly and and then you even stumble praise God Amen But after those prayers consistently killing putting sin under the knife all the time it wants to rise you kill it wants to rise you kill it want to rise you kill it praise God Amen you're going to walk in Holiness you're going to walk triumphant no sin has a right to Reign Over you because Jesus has sorted out that that is a done deal amen hallelujah he did not only do that he even added a bonus Isaiah 53 says he was wounded for our transgression the chastisement of our peace was upon his head but he added the Bonners by his stripes we are healed Hallelujah not only sin should rain in your life but even sickness should not rain in your life sickness must go sickness get out praise God Amen every demon of sin you are judged right now I command you to go whatever's been troubling you I command it to go in the name of Jesus Christ I declare you healed I give you good health because that is what is written thus say the Bible Hallelujah healing is children's bread Hallelujah healing is children's bread Hallelujah you are able to partake of it receive your healing in the name of Jesus receive your healing in the name of Jesus receive your healing in the name of Jesus receive your good health in Jesus Holy Name praise God okay so so now let's let's turn the the page now let's go to what are you going to do for Calvary because Calvary has done all this to you it has done all this all this amen you who were scheduled to slaughter today you are scheduled to Heaven there's an appointment waiting for you you're going to fly away one of these Fine Days in the twinkling of an eye I'll Fly Away Oh Glory I'll Fly Away Hallelujah to a land on God Celestial show I'll

where no sickness can enter where no amen where no moth can enter where no mosquito can enter where no worm can enter a place amen hallelujah did I tell you last time when I came I had a dream about heaven I I dreamed I died and then I just woke up in another place and then I said where am I and then I looked through the wall I could see through the wall the the the the the wall was built with bricks that you can see through they were like gold glass and they were shining and when I could see through outside I saw the leaves of the trees were also shining they were glowing like lights I was like what place is this and then I felt a feeling I don't know how to explain it it went ding do do you know like the best example I can give you is if you have a blocked nose and then it opens like and it like a sound when and it wasn't stopping and I was feeling so good I said oh I'm in heaven this is a heaven I've made it I've made it and you know what happened next I woke up I woke up I said no no no it's not happening it's not happening I woke up I said oh my if that's what heaven is I'll do all I can my brother how do all I can my sister to get there praise God Amen it's a beautiful place we going there we not wanders why are we going there because of Calvary that's right and because of Calvary I'll never be the same praise God Amen so you need to do something for Calvary you can't just sit there you need to do something for Calvary praise God Amen so what are you going to do for Calvary let's look at uh Romans we we we read Romans I I just I'm just reciting it says it says present your bodies Hallelujah is a Living Sacrifice amen hallelujah praise God the prophet says this the prophet says this from the message um this one I want us to read from the message hear ye him uh 57105 the prophet says so Jesus has no eyes tonight but mine and yours on Earth he has no hands but mine and yours he has no voice but mine and yours and he is the spirit in us and we are the branches to bear fruit as he energizes us amen Hallelujah that's right praise God Amen he has no eyes tonight but mine and yours he has no hands but mine and yours he has no voice but mine and yours he is the spirit in us and we are the branches to bear fruit right as he energizes us us you you know Jesus says Upon This Rock I'll build my church right so how is he working how is he building he needs hands to use he needs feet to walk with there's a lot of work of God that has to be done and you are seated there doing nothing about it God God he's saying present your bodies as a Living Sacrifice me I refuse this kind of Christianity of Spectators of people who just come in church and say amen amen and they go home and live their all kinds of life you have a job to do your job is not to eat January to December you don't miss breakfast you don't miss miss lunch you don't miss supper you eat everything I call it ding D ding ding ding all the way January to December and you say no brother Jack we fast brother Jack is is a man sent from God huh let me show you let's read the quote Lord uhuh Hallelujah let's read the quote from the message um um Church order glory to God yes it says uh that's um 58107 paragraph 12 I think or let's begin uh yeah paragraph 12 manifest themselves through the believer when the Holy Spirit comes in to take up the gift I believe that the scripture teaches that gifts and callings are without repentance that when we are born in this world mhm we are sent here for one purpose hallelujah how many were born in this world right how many were born in this world you you never was born you just dropped she didn't raise her hand so so so when you are born in this world bring back that quote when you're born in this world you are sent oh so that issue of saying William Branham a man sent from God so that William Bram will Fast alone he will seek the face of God alone for me it's just to sit and enjoy my rice and enjoy my Shima that's what we eat in Zambia it's a thick a thick porridge me I enjoy this it's everyone of us now we are part of it so this is a boy sent from God hallelujah this is a sister sent from God uhuh so when we all know that we are sent then we now know that we have a job Hallelujah let's read it further it says um sent by one purpose uh and and that that is that is of myself no no no no no what I want to do I want to work hard I want to buy that car and then I want to you everything is about you about you about you it it says hallelujah that is of god you came here for a purpose and that purpose is of God Amen your job is to find out Lord what do you want me to do praise God Amen Hallelujah you have a job my brother you have a job my sister you have to present so each time you don't present yourself your job is is is is not being done praise God Amen it it says that before we become adults before we we are even become adults while we are yet children the gifts that we have of God is in us then and only the filling of the Holy Spirit puts these gifts into operation so if it's not operating maybe the issue is the Holy Ghost amen that's why we are in the house of God you have to receive the Holy Ghost come on receive the Holy Ghost I like that there we can go receive the Holy Ghost I would preach that a thousand times receive the Holy Ghost receive the Holy Ghost receive the ah come on praise God Amen my my my the spirit puts the gifts into operation but we have them in the beginning such as teachers so it's just the preachers Apostles oh okay it's just brother Jack and Prophets oh brother Brenham he adds and and the gifts of tongues uh you have a job to speak in tongues and the nine spiritual gifts according to Corinthians 12 you know what's in Corinthians 12 Corinthians 12 says do I have a few minutes let's read Corinthians 12 mhm Corinthians 12 says now concerning spiritual gifts Brethren I would not have you ignorant Paul doesn't want people to be ignorant but there's too much ignorance about gifts in the message that's the truth why should people remain ignorant Paul says I don't want you to be ignorant concerning spiritual gifts that's right am there's some uh crooked Ness that has happened some some uh robbery that has happened such that the message land has been robbed of the knowledge of the gifts through some teaching I don't know which crook taught things says no we don't need the gifts we don't need these things why why why would you say that no you know they are for Pentecostals you know Mark 16 says this sign shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out they speak with new tongues you know these tongues tongues things they are for Pentecostals show me which Pentecostal wrote Mark 16 was it written by Assemblies of God or or Church of God it was the Lord Jesus who spoke those words and for your information he died speaking in tongues praise God Amen Hallelujah praise God Amen Hallelujah put a tape of Bram Tabernacle you hear someone speaking tongues someone interprets what where has that gone in the message churches you find message churches from January to December from uh uh for 10 years no one has ever spoken in tongues in the church and the people are comfortable we are in the message which message praise God not not that of William Bram not that of Malachi 4 it is another kind but the message that I know in Bram Tabernacle people used to speak in tongues people used to interpret tongues people used to operate you know bham Tabernacle was a church in the days when braam was around and brother Neville when braam is not around people would still come to church and brother Neville would prophesy on them that's right but what have we done we've thrown that away until when we come to church a person says I want to know the will of God over this matter what is God saying brother it's all in the tapes which tape show me that tape quickly where I can find something that is going to tell me what I have to do praise God Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah my my my my where was I we were reading a quote let's go back to the quote let's go back to the quote so he says um according to Corinthians 12 we started reading Corinthians 12 did we okay so we talked about the ignorance and let's go don't don't take that away I'm coming back there you know that you were Gentiles carried away unto these damn Idols even as you were led oh Paul is saying don't be ignorant of the gifts because it is possible for you Gentiles to become ignorant of the gifts because your old religion of Idols your Idols were not talking back to you so when you come to church you will just do your songs your kneeling down and maybe seven times you finish your whole program the thing you call your God will never talk to you and if you're in another town it will never walk to where you are but Paul is saying no no no this is not the way it is in Christianity if you're going to come with that mentality I call it idolatry in Christianity where you don't expect your God to come but the God we worship is not an idol he is alive he rose again he rose again he's able to come in this service and open your eyes and you can see the pillar of fire right here praise got a man and he's able to anoint someone he's able to anoint someone and they'll speak in tongues and we interpret tongues and we are going to hear right now what heaven is saying hallelujah praise God Amen Hallelujah he says we believe that these gifts are in operation today and they should be in every local church hallelujah praise God amen hallelujah we need to preach the message again in this in this world I think I need to go around the whole world reminding them this Hallelujah every local church but what do we see in the message preachers are beating the gifts preachers are stopping the prophecies there's a scripture which says quench not the spirit despise not prophecy is that Bible the Bible people are guilty at the end of The Journey people will answer for stopping the gifts praise God Amen I like it when I say that because many of you are thinking of the preachers who are stopping the gifts are the ones who answer but do you know that you yourself can stop your own gift praise God Amen Hallelujah the spirit of the Lord comes upon you and you feel the electricity and you say I don't want this I don't want this and you hold it and you quench the spirit but the Bible says quench not the spirit Hallelujah come on praise God amen hallelujah amen hallelujah no this is a message church if I speak in tongues here one preacher says when you speak in tongues here and there's no interpreter you I'll tell the deacons to take you out because those are demons that's a lie that's not what the Bible says Paul says if you speak in Tong when we are together it needs an interpretation what if when I'm alone oh brother I'll be changing gears gear one R gear two Roo praise God Amen I'll speak them amen yes praise God hallelujah yes but when we come together he says when you speak in tongues let the speaker interpret or pray that they interpret if there's no interpreter let the speaker keep silent he didn't say they stop they speak to themselves and God so you just reduce your volume you go from Roo to praise God Amen that's what the Bible says and and for your information for you to know that there's no interpretation how are you going to know you have to speak the first time so the first time is allowed Hallelujah praise God Amen so you can speak the first time and if there's no interpreter when they come the second time you just reduce the volume you go on my sister you go on my brother because that's what the Bible says hallelujah hallelujah praise God Amen they should be in every local church you should be worried me I tell people you come to church brother jack is not here no Brethren the preacher has not come so we'll just sing and go home one month two months it's you who will complain how come in the church there's no preacher but then people don't complain how come in the church no Tes no interpretation of Tes they don't care it's okay no no no no it's not okay that's not the message brother Bram left us we must be restored to the Faith of Our Fathers praise God Amen the Faith of Our Fathers began with the day of Pentecost when the day of P cost was fully calm they were all assembled in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled the whole house where they were sitting and there appeared tongues of fire upon each one of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they began to speak with other tongues Hallelujah as the spirit gave him utterance yes Hallelujah that's the religion believe Hallelujah he says I shall restore all the years that the caterpillar has eaten praise God Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah he's here to restore my brother he's here to restore my sister Hallelujah I shall restore say the Lord hallelujah he says I shall restore my God may you go on restore the things that have been eaten up restore the church yes praise God Amen my my my my hallelujah hallelujah I shall restore say the Lord and he says afterwards after restoration I will pour my spirit upon All Flesh do we have flesh here do we have flesh here may I tell God lord when you pour your spirit you say it upon All Flesh where is my portion Hallelujah of that Holy Ghost where is my portion God will not deny some people he says I'll pour my spirit upon All Flesh and your young men shall see visions and your daughters shall prophesy hallelujah hallelujah praise Goden may the Lord pour the spirit right now upon you my brother upon you my sister your portion is there he said I'll PO he did not say I'll sprinkle he says I'll po receive the Holy Ghost receive the Holy Ghost receive the Holy Ghost receive the Holy Ghost receive the Holy Ghost receive the Holy Ghost receive the Holy Ghost ghost receive the Holy Ghost

Withholding Nothing oh withh holding nothing I give my myself away I give myself away so you can use me praise God Amen oh thank you Lord shall we stand all of us as you come in the presence of God In Prayer remember the scripture says the sacrifice must be holy if there are any sins in your hands you say Jesus forgive me remember brother Brenham wanted to pray for a child when he had lied and the Holy Ghost says you can't put those lying hands on the child and the sacrifice was rejected sometimes your sacrifice is not accepted because it is not holy it is not clean it is not good enough it's not reasonable but the service must be reasonable you should give God enough time say I'll pray one minute that's not reasonable you should pray more let it be reasonable but remember the sacrifice must be holy oh Psalms 24 says who shall Ascend in the hill of the lord it's he whose hands are clean you know when you know that you've been sinning and you can't go in the house of God and you start ministering you start singing in the church you're are spreading sin on the people the sacrifice must be holy the sacrifice must be holy say Lord forgive my sins Lord Wash Me In The Blood remember Mary who cried at the feet of Jesus you can cry at the feet of Jesus and say Lord forgive me and then when you forgiven you can give your hands you can give your mouth you say Lord use me I give myself away I give myself away so you who can use me as I Cobra Jack I give myself away I give myself away so you can use me and we say yes yes yes Lord yes oh and we say yes we say yes yes oh yes yes

you one more time say I Give Myself Away hallelujah oh I give so you can use [Music] me come on give the Lord a hand of [Applause] Praise how we thank the Lord um you can be seated just for a moment I know for certain that the Holy Spirit spoke to us here tonight man and I know the spirit of God was pleased with what the minister had to share and um it just always an encouragement to me when God sends a minister just to kind of walk right into the same channel that the church has already been dealing with and um you know I mentioned to you all um the um our theme you know for this year was um get back in step and and uh the underlying inspiration behind that was I will restore sayeth the Lord and I and I mentioned to you all that um the gifts in the church were a part of the restoration and uh this is one church that actually believes in the gifts in the church I just love the the way the Lord use our precious brother uh Jimmy now he said something tonight that gave life to those that have gifts when we go back and we read the scripture and it says now one would speak in tongues and now before you quench the spirit you have to allow the tongue to go forth and if nobody is there to interpret then when the Holy Spirit comes back upon you you just turn it back down but we have been hindered in our walk by not understanding the scripture right but but when the Holy Spirit comes you don't know if you would just release and it's not you don't let it get it out of order but when when you release it you don't know if somebody's there that has the gift to interpret how many times have I heard that you know somebody was ready to speak in tongues and then say well I had I had to I I I was ready to give an interpretation but I just I just held it you quenching the spirit don't do that don't do that we this was restored this end time message brought it all back and we don't leave this with the Pentecost they do it because they don't know what they doing my God but here we know exactly what we're standing on and this was what God brought back into the church I'm so glad God sent a brother all the way from zomia Amen to to share that with us tonight how lifegiving how we should be freed in our spirit amen because the devil has bound us up for so many years but I tell you what now it's been loose by the end time message the holy brother brandom say the Holy Ghost have been bound by denominational Rivers for thousands of years but now it's been Loos by the end time message my God my God I'm looking for God to do some great things in here looking for God to do and I I I I I just felt tonight was a release amen that was that was nothing but the Holy Ghost to come and bring that to us like that nothing but the Holy Ghost oh my my my my my my my my my hallelujah hallelujah amen we not going to have to uh make it happen it's just going to happen cuz the ones that have the gifts they they feel it all the time often time they feel it they feel it you know especially when uh the preachers Minister the word if there's an altar call that's going forth we know we don't do things like that but there was always order to when things were done and uh we going to we're just going to step back into the order that's what getting back in step is all about you know get back into the step and get back into the order of what God the way God's wanted but no no preaching against the gifts let's encourage the gifts amen amen thank you thank you our precious brother thank you for for for just com tonight I I I know we have to go but there was one other thing we heard tonight take the angel with you the brother say I I I'm not I got to Le this altar but I'm bringing you with me when I go to sleep I'm bringing you with me when I go back go to work tomorrow I'm bringing you with me you ain't leaving my side and and and and and and and see when you realize that as a Believer uh he was writing the scripture because in uh uh that Psalm 34 I believe says the angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him and deliver them from all their troubles and brother random told us not everybody have an angel the only ones that have an angel are those that fear Him Glory to God so if if you fear God there's an Angel going with you wherever you go there's an angel right there and he's there for your service whatever you need you just ask God hallelujah church we live we live way beneath our privileges amen I'm I'm talking about spiritual Privileges and natural privileges amen it's it's time to release the gifts release God let God let God and he said that exactly there when you know when at the end of the turn of the sermon there what do we do now for Calvary what do we do for Calvary we yield ourselves and we allow the same spirit that was in the Lord Jesus Christ to dwell in us and to manifest himself through US amen it's all about yielding church it's all about yielding I appreciate this tonight I really appreciate this tonight God is good God is good this will be a nice turning point for us we'll go back to this night amen Amen Let me just give you quickly amen uh some announcements and we'll prepare to uh dismiss you tonight praise God and and that testimony about receiving a a plot of [Music] land and I think he said something about after they did a meeting he released something like he said the Pastor told them they had to do a meeting in a certain town and it was after they did the meeting there was supposed to been a release I don't know if y'all caught that but what is spirit and Truth hosting in in August God don't send nobody from Zombia to say things just to be saying things I hope you catch what the Holy Ghost is trying to say to you your expectation should rise oh my I'mma just I'm just I'mma I'm I'mma take a step of Faith y'all y'all mind me taking a step of Faith now I've been listening to this tape you know uh don't cry speak and I'mma speak I'mma speak Amen brother um Jimmy next time you come preach for us you'll be preaching for us in our church [Applause] amen praise God I told you there going to be a night we won't forget Amen brother brandom say when Moses was in the line of duty um he didn't have to keep praying about everything just speak hav when I already showed you that I've been with you now I want you to just take care of this that's what brother random said you go back and listen to I I've been listening to it over and over again but you you we have to realize that God has given us a certain amount of authority as Believers and when we know that we're doing things according to his will then we just got to back the devil's up with what we release out of our mouth praise God Amen I I I I'm releasing the angel go make things happen praise God whoever you got to work on work on but you you make it happen things I can't do you do I'm releasing the angel to make it happen glory to God thank you Jesus amen uh Sunday morning we'll be here prayer starts at

sometimes we have a service like this and um it may be unannounced but it's that's the time that God is actually dropping something on purpose and we got a little something on purpose tonight amen God God is good God is good let's have a word of prayer amen before we would leave father we are we are just overwhelmed we're blessed to be able to hear God you just speak to our hearts the way that you spoke to us father I just believe uh spiritually people were set free by the word that was spoken The Clarity on the word Lord we we needed to hear something like this we knew that uh that the gifts were restored it was part of the restoration process brother brandom said there were there were four death Messengers that took life out but in that brid tree there was four life Messengers that brought it back in and one of those life Messengers restored the gifts of the Spirit it came back through what happened at auzu street but God they they just they went off into denomination and they that's why the spirit was quenched but yet you brought a restoration back into the body of Christ and Lord we all we need to do is just align it properly according to the word then you're free to do exactly what you want to do in our midst so thank you for allowing your servant to come and Lord to speak so much to our hearts this is uh we realize what what Calvary has done for us but now what do we need to do for Calvary and that's simply yielding ourselves and allowing you to carry on your ministry through your bride so father we just we just we just pray Lord that you would help us Lord to meditate on as we heard tonight let the we know the scripture promis us that the Angels would encamp us but Lord let us go with the angel and let us Lord just begin to uh Lord just take our claims on the things that you've promised us father allow the angel of the Lord to go to work on our behalf We Trust oh God that you would uh continue to get Glory and Honor out of all that we do bless brother uh Jimmy God thank you bless his ministry his family and everything back home uh Lord all the other churches that he'll be ministering at while he's here use them Father in a special way and may the spirit of God just be pleased with all things that are done bless the saints that have come from bton Lord especially bless brother Dave and sister Hannah for hosting the preacher and just uh carrying them Lord wherever he needs to go bless them Father abundantly is our prayer uh we ask that you would keep us all until we're able to meet together again it's in jesus' name that we pray amen amen also real quick I forgot to mention we are uh I've been talking with brother Jean as well as brother Mike and um we are going to try to put something on the calendar to have a combined service again we haven't done that in a while but we're going to try to put something on the calendar so we can get back into some fellowship amongst amen the south Florida churches so uh you'll be hearing more about that in the future God bless you uh we'll have the brothers come at this time to dismiss and uh let's just allow the minister to go to the back here so he can just greet the people as they're going out amen God bless you
