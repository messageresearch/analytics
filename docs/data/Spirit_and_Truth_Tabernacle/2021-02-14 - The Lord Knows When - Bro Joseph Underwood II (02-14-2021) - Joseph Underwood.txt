we can just try to make it through and we'll get it fixed at a later later time i'm so glad to know that the devil is still a liar and we have the victory amen we have the victory a couple of things that i just need to make mention of uh first of all uh precious brother simba and sister ruth um last night had a baby boy uh early this morning i guess i should say uh february 14th amen valentine's baby uh mason munashe murangami amen praise the lord he was born this morning seven pounds 13 ounces and we thank the lord for just bringing our sister through amen the pregnancy and allowing the little one to arrive a man safely we certainly thank god for that so keep them in prayer also commit continue to keep brother jerry and man and uh his wife assist melissa uh their baby in prayer they're trying to get back home and and he's bringing the whole family with him this time this last trip to 80 without his family so just keep them in prayer amen uh also earlier in the week we heard that uh brother mike mondelis man he had a little boy i believe early this week so we thank god for blessing him and his wife amen with uh with a newborn amen so the lord is adding such as would be saved amen we thank god for all things uh also on um i mentioned this on wednesday night that we we were notified amen i think it's our duty once we are notified that uh that someone had come in contact uh very close contact someone in our church came in close contact with a family member that was diagnosed uh with a positive test of uh covet so uh what we decided to do we were trying our best not to have to shut church down we don't want to see no outbreak here in the church so some saints are uh quarantining and that's perfectly fine but those of us that are in the inside the house what i encourage everyone to do just so that we can prevent any outbreaks amen so we can keep coming to church we ask everyone please wear your mask while you're inside the sanctuary uh this would just really help us so that it does not spread here you realize that that's what the devil want to do is just let something spread and just shut the church down right we're trying to stop that we're really trying to stop that so we're just asking everyone just for the next you know week or so please wear your mask while you're here until this thing just kind of passes we were told of a positive test so we want to uh respond appropriately amen to that so bear with us amen just get through this little season then we can be free again amen praise the lord but we're happy to be here today a man and uh i am uh grateful to have um brother joe underwood and his precious wife sister rebecca amen and they have brought uh the miracle amen praise god uh brother zakai amen good to have him uh with us today in service and and um i won't steal any brother joe's thunder uh it is it is he and his sister rebecca's testimony uh we've heard different parts of it uh but now we see a manifestation of it and you know that's and i feel i feel i feel that uh as the bride of jesus christ removing a man from just holding on to promises to seeing a manifestation of what we would promise amen i believe that you know i you know when you're when a mother is expecting there comes a day that she delivers what she was expecting and and i believe we as the bride we've been expecting great and precious promises from our lord and savior and now it's time for those things to be manifested in our midst so uh let's look forward to that church let's look forward to it uh but this morning um i i want us to you know let's just stand and i told our brother joe when he comes i say brother whatever the lord put in your heart to do if you want to sing a little bit sing amen preach testify whatever you want to do use every gift that god gave you amen and we just want him just to have his way and uh um we just we just really appreciate them appreciate amen to stand for the gospel and just just watching the lord just do some mighty things during his life and uh god's just been real good to him real good so good to have him amen here uh they were prayed for here brother nathan bryant came and prayed they couldn't have children i think it was for seven years seven years it might been something like that and and they were prayed for it at a service here that we had and uh and and god touched our precious sister my precious brother and gave them this child and they had the child in the middle of a pandemic amen but that's just the way our god do things you don't wait till it's easy to do things he wanted to be a little difficult and give him more glory right when it's done like that so uh but god did some great things right here in this church and i tell you if there's anybody here believing god for anything uh let your faith rise this morning amen as you hear the word of god uh because all things are possible to those that believe amen um maybe we'll just uh we'll go back to old old song amen only believe only believe all things are possible if we only believe as we receive the servant of god as it comes to preach the word of god to our hearts let's sing this song [Music] believe come on everybody believe all things are possible yes only be [Music] believe [Music] come on tell the lord lord i believe say lord i believe [Music] oh [Music] yes [Music] let's just raise our hand say now i [Applause] believe [Music] i hallelujah all things are possible now i'll be amen and the church says amen this morning [Applause] amen [Applause] amen and i believe this morning amen do you believe amen you believe with your whole heart amen i don't just believe i only believe man there's a difference there's a difference some people believe but some people only believe amen so i only believe this morning amen amen so amen we're just uh happy to be here this morning if you don't mind you can be seated amen uh just very very grateful to be here and uh i think this is uh zeke's second or third time uh to west palm beach and uh we made it all the way down no wet diapers him had praise the lord so he's getting better hey man as he gets older um many of you all were here uh i believe was two years ago just two years 2019. when brother nathan bryant was here and uh brother jack you were hosting us the services um in june and i remember when we came i came up here to sing a special and i think i made my wife a little nervous i told everybody keep us in prayer we believe in the lord for a child and uh i remember she uh when we got in the car later on that evening she was i wish she didn't do that you know and she was like you know telling all our business out there you know everybody looking at us and i told her i said you knew who you married you know so you got i didn't surprise you i hope you know and uh so but uh later on in that service that evening uh brother uh jack and brother nathan uh there was a prayer line here and i believe the instructions were that uh when you come across that uh you come across from one side you uh after you get prayed for it you just thank the lord all the way to the other side amen and then you go to your seat on the other side and so we came in the line and uh brother nathan i prayed for me and sister rebecca and uh you know it's very important that we pay attention to the details amen you know if the lord i have a specific instruction you got to follow the way the lord you know lay it out and some people want the blessings of god don't want to uh be obedient to the instructions amen so you know i i we were coming through the line and when we got done getting prayed for my wife she was walking in front of me and she was about to go down the middle island but jack pulled me said whoa brother joe come here come come come come back and uh he said uh you know we want you to walk all the way across and praise the lord and then go to your seat now i see i think was right there with brother solomon sitting so we had no no need to go that way you know we could have just walked right there and so uh i grabbed my wife and said honey let's go down to the end we just thank the lord walk down to the end and man we can't walk all the way down some people want the short way now oxtails don't taste the same in the microwave so we took a longer route and um you know by going to the longer route there as i began to make my way back around to the seat i just said lord i already believe it's already done so we uh at the end of that service or tour i almost forgot brother nathan actually said uh here in the prayer line i almost forgot i got to go back he sent a prayer line he said by this time next year you have your child you know i don't mean nothing to a whole lot of people you know you just want to be prayed for you just want to see the promise of god but uh you got to pay attention to the details and um so i i got in my seat and i just began to think by this time next year i kept thinking how much time we had and the time was pretty short there so we get out to the parking lot brother nathan or not brother nathan brother martin dasslin at the boynton beach church i came over to me and my wife and he said do you want a boy or girl and uh i said well brother we'd just be happy with it whatever lord he said no no no he said the lord told me to come over here and ask you guys you want to borrow a girl uh we were standing there and uh i said i don't want no girls i won't have to kill anybody so uh he looked at rebecca he was like you on the same page you want a boy and so rebecca said yes so i went back home and i became like john ryan i started telling the church that the lord is going to give us a boy amen and the first month went by and you know i didn't i didn't see i didn't see anything so i started saying well we we ran out of time here you know he said by this time next year so the second month went by and nothing happened i said lord i believe you know uh we the clock is ticking down so we got to the third month and i thought for sure the third month you know because it takes nine months to have a baby so [Music] we went the third month and nothing happened so they'll try to discourage me and um made me think like uh you know maybe it's not the that exact time frame maybe sometime in the next year so i didn't say anything my wife was kind of depressed but then the devil attacked and she got in a car accident in the middle in the beginning of october her car was totaled she was hit on the driver's side some of you all heard the testimony and [Music] went to the hospital and of course first thing they asked before they take the x-rays on the mri they said uh are you pregnant and we i think rebecca maybe uh tested that morning and she said no i'm not pregnant so of course they gave her the special dye and had her take the mris and the x-rays and there was nothing uh we just thanked the lord that he protected there was no broken bones or you know anything really really severe at least that they could find in the x-ray that might impair her for the remainder of her life and so um we just thanked the lord for it and we're preparing a trip to go to canada um to see her sister her sister there and we had to come here to miami to get her passport and on the way back home brother westco and calling us he said hey i just felt led to call you and i tell you that you and sis rebecca need to get a hotel and turn off the cell phones don't turn the tv on and just stay in there until you have a baby and don't come out and uh i said granny you told us you've been telling us this for the past eight years almost saying like he would call you know periodically and try to give us that as advice he said okay he said well have you done it yet and uh i said yeah yeah we've done that a couple of times he said uh we'll do it again you know until until it happens so i said all right i'll take your advice and um that was on wednesday we were riding back home and then on friday morning uh about six o'clock in the morning i believe rebecca woke me up in a panic i thought something happened and she had uh went i don't know what maybe led her to go check or test but she tested positive for being pregnant and uh [Applause] we were we were i was excited but you know i i said let me go run by the store um today and i'll pick up some more tests and say you know yeah i'll take some more tests you know i want no false positives you know got to be certain of god you know i want to make sure so uh we went and i bought a ton of tests i don't know i probably was new to the whole thing i think the cashier lady was looking at me a little funny i had a lot of a lot of tests there i was like you know go take this one a few minutes later go take this one it'll take a little we was like lining them up bro jack positive positive positive positive positive and so um we found out we were having a baby we were so excited and um we went to the i don't know what they call that they're not the doctor but the ones who checked tried to find out the gender for you and uh we went and uh she said well it's too early to tell what we haven't but she said oh there's a baby here and she helped kind of identify maybe a condition that would have prevented us from having children at all and she thought it was very very interesting that we were able to get pregnant you know i said well it's not interesting to us we serve a mighty god amen amen so we we we weren't uh interested in in the doctor's opinions we got god's word we were okay um and uh so she said you know we can't determine i said it's a boy [Music] and i went back to the church brother jack i put my own ministry in the line i told i told the church that i i know dust said the lord it was a boy you know i could i probably wouldn't be preaching here this morning but some people take these things seriously you know you never get to preach again you say don't say the lord and they don't kind of pass it that's the end of the song they don't you know you don't get to go past that but i i was so sure uh of what had happened here that night you know my faith was anchored and when we went back later on we went to the doctor and uh we were going to find out the gender and rebecca was all excited she was like what if it's a girl i said it's not a girl i was certain i was picking out boy names i let her pick out the girl names i picked out all the boy names and um we got there she looked at that picture she was like wow i was alright cut the theatrics you know we we don't we're not doing no gender reveals she went you know how to ask you wanna you want us to hold this and i was like no we're not we we're old-fashioned just go ahead and tell us what it is she said that's a boy i said well praise the lord we already knew that thanks for confirmation and uh when i came back to the church and i told him to testimony he was a boy nobody clapped or said anything everybody was looking and they just couldn't believe it because it was so surreal in that moment and you know we went through we weren't sure if i would be able to go to the hospital for the delivery it's an experience so i probably won't be in the room twice for the jack i've seen enough i'm okay now it's one of those things where you're like man i want to be there now i'm like nah that's all right that's all right let the doctors do what they do you know i'm not a doctor you know i'm i'm just a husband so but uh you know um we i was there and we thought that there might be some complications because of the condition that was in the original x-rays rebecca delivered that baby in two hours i said good job i was so happy [Applause] she she got mad at me uh first hour i went to sleep i didn't know how long it was going to be there so i put my feet up took my shoes off and put ice with the two blankets and extra pillows and rebecca she's like how could you lay down i was like i don't know [Music] when he was born he was born i was eight pounds eight ounces three ounces i just remember he was born that's it that's all i remember and uh you know he's here with us this morning you know some of us don't know don't realize this but remember the attention is in the details you know he was born on june 24th but jack you had the meetings in june and brother nathan said by this time next year in the same month amen that's not coincidence yeah man no that i mean a lot of things we want to put it off the chance but you know this this is uh the manifestation of prophecy amen you know a lot of people they they talk about prophecy they say oh i believe the message i believe this and that but then what do you do when prophecy come to you amen how do you respond to a prophetic word that comes to you you know because i can preach all day and i can tell you my testimony but the word of the lord is for you and so you know god wants to know what are you going to do when this word come to you i'm just a preacher i'm just a vessel he's using pastor is just just a vessel he's using but it's up to you the outcome uh brother brandon i was reading a quote brother branham uh he was talking about uh he was uh he called out a sister i think it was sister virginia i i don't know if i read that quote here in this church i feel like i read it here it was a sister virginia and he had called out a condition that she she had and asked if she believed and she didn't respond and because she didn't respond there was another brother in the audience who had a similar condition and he responded brother thomas and so brother brown said y'all don't be like sister virginia she just missed it he said we don't want to be like sister virginia right in the same circle now for some people that would offend it since the virginia probably got up you know she was a black woman i don't know she might have had an attitude wanted to leave that service he said but don't be like sister virginia she just missed it this one this one over here this brother he got it it was intended for assistant virginia but because she didn't respond to the prophetic word it was given to somebody else same service same service same service somebody somebody this morning you might be believing god for something all right and god he wants to know where you respond it may not even be a directed word to you but if you can plug in and respond to it ask myself i said i wonder how many people that night here had the same exact wanted the same thing i wanted ask myself that i said i wonder how many people but i wonder how many people responded amen because what what happens is a lot of times we say you know lord you know i'm too embarrassed to say that i want i don't want everybody to know like my wife said when i got in the car you know i wish we should have to put all of our business on the line some people want things private but what if that's your day what if that was your moment what if that was your season and because you were just a little embarrassed you you were just a little ashamed or you didn't want nobody to know your business [Music] and just because of that that one minute where you didn't want nobody then this person over here got what was supposed to be for you so i said lord you know um i'm thankful i'm grateful um you know i i see it as my testimony but this isn't just my testimony it's for this whole church because now that you get to hear the testimony your face should arrive and say lord i'll respond it won't happen to me lord i will respond if you call on me god if it's my season i'm here send it my way i'm not too proud i'll send it send that anointing the same anointing it's here this morning same anointing then the same anointing that was in the prophet's ministry is here this morning i don't care what condition is in your body me and my house we knew i i was talking about a job me in my house we're not afraid of covet i'm gonna tell you why i'm gonna tell you why because the same god in the day of william branham the same god in the day of elijah the same god who was there that healed those lepers in the bible he is here this morning i'm not afraid of that stuff now your faith your faith might not rise to that place yet but i hope that by the end we get to the end of this service that your faith will increase amen let's just say you know what lord i have more faith in your word than man's opinion i have more faith in your word than the symptoms in my body i have more faith in your word than what's going on and what looks like this reality because the bible says that those who walk in the spirit they are the sons of god all right and we are not bound by the laws of nature when you walk in the spirit you are a supernatural being supernatural beings have the authority to override nature you can override the laws of nature that's why jesus can walk on water do you know you can walk on water if you're a supernatural being hey man amen you know i'm not even preaching yet but if you're a supernatural being you can defy nature that's what supernatural is it's outside of natural oh praise god that's why i don't worry about what's going on the doctor tell me bad news i said thank you but i'm supernatural i can override the doctor's orders [Applause] i have a prescription that overrides the doctor's prescription i have thus said the lord they said the lord prophet said the bride of christ she will have the mind of christ and thus said to the lord to know what to do with this word i know what to do with the word i applied over my house i applied over my wife i applied over my children hey man i'm a supernatural being this morning amen amen so i'm i'm thankful i'm grateful to be here and um you know i'm i'm glad i think this is uh zeke this is your first time hearing daddy preach at spirit and truth tabernacle amen i feel good i said i feel good to say i must i might might say some things to zeke this morning see if he'll cooperate you know back at the home church when i preach he like to say amen we'll see i don't get anybody else saying man he said man i'mma be all right so amen uh i know it's valentine's day um i didn't want to have my wife saying because i know she's watching z this morning but uh if you can give me the key of e flat i was listening to this song and um so you know what i tried to sing a song to the lord this morning uh look let me hear that again he flat amen you love with no reservation [Music] and you're not looking for perfection and there's no need in me pretending lord i'll give you everything i'll give you everything and you deserve my full attention [Music] and nothing less than my devotion will speak to me and i will listen and i'll give you everything i'll give you everything whoa whoa you can have my heart you can [Music] you can have my heart be the lord of my emotions and set me free from selfish motives lord search me till there's nothing hidden and i'll give you everything i'll give you everything you can have my heart you can have my [Music] heart let's say that again whoa [Music] whoa [Music] [Music] if you want my heart you got it you got it you say that if you want my heart you got it you got if you want my heart you got it yes you do if you want my heart you got it you got it if you want my heart you got it you got it if you want my heart you got it yes you do if you want my life you got it you got it if you want [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you can help my heart you can have my heart whoa you can have my heart you can one more time [Applause] [Music] yes you can [Music] can just raise your hand say lord if you want my heart you got it you got it whoa if you want my heart you got it if you want my mind lord if you want my mind you got it you got if you want my mind lord you got it if you want my lips lord if you want my lips you got it for whatever you have me to say if you want my lips cut whoa you got it if you want my life you got it yes you do if you want my life you got it you got it if you want my heart [Music] whoa [Music] you can have my heart you can have my heart yes you can whoa whoa you can have my heart you can have my heart somebody just praise him in this place [Music] hallelujah [Applause] [Music] all my dreams is his this morning all my hope is his this morning everything i've been looking to is his this morning amen we're resting on him this morning amen amen we just appreciate you this morning i said this time if you just stand with me hey man i think the musicians i didn't think they would get i sent it to him this morning i got to work on sitting uh earlier i'll get better but i appreciate you all this this morning amen um if you just open with me to psalm uh 126 and verse one and i just bring greetings from the family of god tabernacle with we're uh raising money right now we got the roof put on the new building and we're raising money to put the windows and the doors on the church you know i i told them the doors of the church are open nobody nobody thought it was funny when i said it because they want them doors on the church so i i i didn't mess with that for too long you gotta know when to when to play around you can't play all the time you can't play all the time so man let's read this psalm 126 verse one through six it says when the lord turned again the captivity of zion we were like them that dream then was our mouth filled with laughter and our tongue was with singing then said they among the heathen the lord have done great things for them the lord had done great things for us we're of we are glad turn again our captivity oh lord as the streams in the south they that sow and tears shall reap enjoy he that goes forth and weepeth bearing precious seed shall doubtless come again with rejoicing bringing his sheaves with him amen may the lord add a blessing to the reader of his word let's just buy our heads for word of prayer dear heavenly father o righteous one the giver of life the author and finisher of our faith god we just come before your throne of grace this morning and god all the singing and everything that's gone forth lord we know that you're here with us lord and your anointing and your presence can be felt here amongst your bride and lord just pray this morning lord god that you just come and meet the needs of your people lord you you know everything that's going on here in the sanctuary lord and here amongst your bride and god we all are needy people as a prophet will call us lord god and but we know we serve a god who shall supply all of our needs according to his riches and glory and lord we're just putting all of our burdens and cares on you this morning father and we ask lord that you would speak lord your mind your thoughts your spirit would have preeminence lord god and that any other spirit that would try to rise up lord god that it would be just cast down and that the sweet aroma of your spirit would sweep through the aisles lord god and change lives and deliver people lord god and fill us with the holy ghost lord bring healing lord help our faith to arise and it's our lord god of pandemic where it seems like uh the the people's faith has has maybe waxed cold but lord god that you you promised that this time would come but there will be some true believers lord god who will be able to rise up in faith lord god and lord i believe we're here amongst those people this morning who believe that anything can happen all things are possible to them that believe and lord we just i thank you lord god for my son and my wife and the testimony given me but lord may it be for your glory lord that somebody else lord god will hear that lord god and take a hold of the word that comes in their direction lord and they go and run with it so they'll have a testimony of their own for your glory lord god and lord god we know that we're just here together for this little time lord we pray that your blessings fellowship lord god man they'll be rejoicing in testimonies come lord from this service or in even the services that are to come if it be your will lord god you'll just continue to strengthen the pastor of his church and his family lord god continue to use him lord god and and the growth of this ministry just continue to flourish lord and we pray lord for the church you know the needs of the church lord we pray so meet those needs open up the doors that need to be opened lord god the opportunities that need to be presented may they be presented lord god and may the church just recognize it and walk right in and lord god and trusting in you we ask these things we pray in jesus name amen amen man you can be seated this morning hey man uh i i wanted to preach a short message this morning but every time i i do that say i'm preached short then i end up preaching the first part of the sermon in the first half hour and then the last part the last hour uh so uh i'm gonna try to be a preacher at a half hour uh but as brother wesker said we're preachers of the hour and so i gotta try to find some balance here hey man but uh i want to speak to you this morning on uh on a topic uh the lord knows when amen the lord knows when amen now the word when if you look over in psalm uh 126 and verse 1 it says when the lord turned again the captivity of zion we were like them that dream amen now when i when i look at this particular verse my attention is turned to when because it doesn't exactly express the timeline of the word when and when you think of the word when when is time encapsulating but it's uncertain all right so it doesn't have a date it just says when the lord turn amen and so uh some of you all have probably heard the expression the lord knows when amen so we we've heard that before uh you probably heard it used like uh the lord knows when it's the right time to do it or you've heard uh the lord knows knows when i should you know make that decision he knows all things right we we put that off like it's way out there on the side of the highway somewhere we we just got to wait until he brings it to pass but this morning i kind of want to uh take this thought of the lord knows when and actually bring a absolute conviction on it so i want you to think of it for uh with me for a moment this morning church the lord knows when the lord knows when so the lord we know that the lord knows uh the beginning to the end amen you believe that the lord knows it and so it's comforting then for us to say the lord knows when especially since we don't know when right so so because we know that he knows the beginning to the end we we we kind of sit at ease we don't have to get anxious and worry about anything we just pray about everything right and so we realize that if the lord knows the beginning to the end this means that god has his own clock the lord has his own watch now um some of you all may have a apple watch or you may be wearing your wrist watch and i remember reading um in the message where brother branham was talking about he got this special watch from sweden i believe it was and he said it was a great celestial watch and he said that you know it was beautiful to look at and it uh he set the time on it he said not two three months later he said though the time on the watch was not consistent with what time it actually was right but do you realize that god's clock it always ticks in perfect time hey man it doesn't it doesn't matter you know the apple watches they kind of sink to the internet you know so so they kind of can keep it up now but but if you just have a regular watch you know after a set period of time when the battery begins to go low it starts to get off track but see god's timing is so specific amen he has what we call appointments amen you know he's always on time you know he's not like your doctor you know your doctor tells you that you have an appointment but it's really not an appointment because an appointment is when you start on time amen so like when we say that church is at 10 30 then everybody's nobody should walk in at 10 31 right because the appointment is at 10 30. all right gonna get too deep leave it right there you see if you if you recognize what what we do sometimes psychologically is we put off excuses for lapses in time and imagine if god had an excuse for lapses in time on his clock so what if he didn't show up right when you needed him right and so now he has a schedule god has a schedule he knows the days that's on the calendar it's not like our days on the counter you know that's why when when month three came from me uh you know after we left the service and we you know we uh we weren't pregnant you know that kind of threw me off because see that's man's time right man says you have to have a baby you know in exactly nine months and it has to be like this god said what if i i don't get allow you to conceive until you know the fifth month and then you deliver in the ninth month see man we we our thinking is finite right but god he's outside of the box this is why this is why the lord knows when because if we knew when we probably mess it up we try to get ahead of the clock you know so some of you are when you get you heard me make the expression know that our cells don't taste the same in the microwave there's some people in here that's willing to put oxtails in the microwave when they get hungry enough they do it they'll put chicken in the microwave if they get hungry enough they'll do it there's some people that no matter how hungry they get they still gonna put in a slow cooker so so to play it safe we'll just let god know when and we just ride in the vehicle y'all ever had children they're riding in the car with you the children riding in the car and they say mom and daddy are we there yet you notice the thing about the children when they ask are we there yet that they are comfortable all right with the situation they're in but they don't know when they sit at ease they're resting and and their their confidence is in mommy and daddy y'all understand what i'm saying so they they don't they don't uh the only thing they probably say is i really gotta use the restroom right but when it comes down to getting from point a to point b when that child knows we're going from here to there they'll say are we there yet but they don't go are we gonna get there they know they're going to get there they just want to know are we there yet yeah right so the the saints of god we're in this automobile right and we're riding with god and we we don't need to try to figure out are we going to make it there we just want to know lord when will we get there that's that's the place our faith has got to rise you got to be so confident in god knowing that he controls all things that you're just waiting for the appointed time amen now there's some things you got to do when you're waiting because some people think that when you're waiting you're supposed to watch the clock you do that you know you kind of get bored you fall asleep and you you know you might wake up late and you might miss it completely so there's some things that you got to do uh there when you're waiting but we'll get to that here in just a moment now now you know god he is calculated he don't he don't um god don't just make up stuff god don't just uh react because you you made a decision now he's got to try to figure out his next move he doesn't do things on a whim and um the prophet of god uh said that everything that god does is purp his purpose everything he does is purpose uh brother brennan says this uh let me see here he says this uh in 1958 i know my redeemer livid he says just as my finger is here for a purpose my nail on my finger is for a purpose my eye and every part of our bodies is to serve a purpose and it was not put here just to see what it would look like when it was put here but it was put here to serve its purpose so i want to say this you are not here watch it just to see what you would look like all right some of y'all you know you want to show you know where your new suit and all that and that's great thank you you look good this morning praise god it's good to see you but you're not here this morning just to see what you would look like if you made it into this service this morning it's because you are put here to serve a purpose [Music] but the brown says it was god's divine plan to do so and if we were put here for a purpose watch then there is nothing can destroy us until god's purpose is fulfilled nothing can harm us until that purpose that god has put us here for has been made manifest i want you to think about that for a minute you mean to tell me that there is nothing watch now that the devil can do to prevent me from receiving the promise of god so no matter how hard the devil wants to fight or try to delay the promise of god for zika being in the service this morning he could not do it because when it is promised to you for a purpose there is nothing can harm the purpose that's why when the doctors they say you know we we see that there might be some complications here there's nothing can harm the purpose of god in your life nothing nothing can stop it your purpose must be fulfilled right no matter how much trouble we have how much heartaches or sorrows that we go through all of these are reasons and there's a reason for it so you mean to tell me you mean to tell me that the re the tribulation that's upon me the the the the time that's being delayed uh for my promise to come to pass is for a reason absolutely now the prophet goes on to say he says we will take for instance noah in the bible he said there was a flood that came on and all of the earth was destroyed the vegetation and everything was destroyed but noah and the seed that had taken into the ark watch this god's purpose can never be defeated amen i want to say something right here it doesn't matter how long you've been believing god [Music] it cannot be stopped i don't care you've been believing god for your children for 20 years 30 years for the it's a promise this promise is to you and your children and god's purpose can never the prophet said it can never you know it never means [Music] never that means it don't matter how bad it gets it don't matter how extreme the circumstances are it can never be defeated there is nothing can defeat it [Applause] i believe that this morning i receive that he said so how happy are we to be today hey amen how happy are we to be today resting upon that beautiful revelation of the word of the living god that there is neither things present nor things that can come watch this now i'm gonna read it the way i see it there's no covenant it's home there's no covet no sorrow no death no perils nor nothing can separate us from the purpose of the living god doctor said we gotta we gotta uh we can we might not be able to take you back uh to see the birth of your son mr underwood because we gotta protect the baby from kobe i said kobe can't stop that that let's see coleman couldn't stop it devil couldn't stop it there's no devil in hell can stop you from receiving your promise you got to believe it though i'm just saying it you got to believe it amen he said what god has imagined in his mind with god his purpose in his heart to bring the past there is no demon oh hold on everything you know some people they're operating in witchcraft now there's some people that are rooting against you so it's not just the demons there are no powers there is nothing can ever separate god's great immortal eternal plan it must be as god has said amen amen must be the way he said right so it doesn't matter how long it is the lord knows when i just stand believing amen doesn't matter how many demons get released doesn't matter how many services i got to go to doesn't matter how many times i got to be prayed over oh come on somebody you say i don't know if i want to get prayed for again i don't know i've been praying for it three times about the same situation don't matter how many times you need to be prayed for just come on through the line anyway and follow the instructions you got to follow you got to follow the instructions you imagine i had a uh you know i had just gone there and sat right down i don't think he could be here this morning i know he wouldn't because god is so specific there were several times where god told the children of israel to do things a certain way and every time they went outside of the way god y'all believe god has a provided way don't you you can't get eternal life going around the message [Applause] he's got one way one spirit one baptism one faith you can't get eternal life going around the message you got to follow the instructions there's some devils mad this morning some demons trembling this morning amen listen i don't care listen i don't care what your conditions say i know what my god says i value men's opinion but i value god's word more i value men's opinion but i value god's word more amen let me read this quote brother brandon says this this 1963 victory day he said and each one of us is born for something we just wasn't put here for nothing that mountain never happened out there just to be that tree was put there for a purpose everything is for a purpose you know some people don't want trees some people don't want mountains oh no they see a mountain in their life and they ready to quit give up and say it ain't for me i guess i've been praying for the wrong thing lord oh lord i guess i've been believing it seemed like it's gotten worse the situation lord that tree was put there for a purpose you know that the tree that jesus cursed was put there oh man [Music] he says it's got to serve and we are here for a purpose maybe it's to testify to one person wait a minute brother jack you mean that testimony i just told this morning might only be for one person oh man i rebecca i hope it's us get double blessed to get lost but that's the way you should respond if it wasn't for one person says me it's for me [Applause] maybe it's to testify to one person and get them saved and out of that might come a preacher will send a million souls to christ he said look at dwight moody's conference conversion and many of those you see he said just one little old woman with a little old watch woman with a message on her heart to do something for god and she rented an old lottery stable and got a minister to come down and preach and nobody why should you see how nobody showed up you know why it was probably wednesday night it was probably friday night prayer oh it wasn't it wasn't at the church it was at somebody's house and so we ain't going over that brother house because we ain't friends with that brother we don't get along with that brother we ain't friends with that sister we don't get along watch the attitude of the people you want to know you want to know how blessed the church is you can see it on the attitudes of the people people round ourselves people with positive positive faith get positive results that negative attitude is like a flat tire you can't go too far into your chains he said nobody but a little old boy with their hair hanging down his neck and his daddy's suspenders on went down there and knelt down at that uh at the altar that night dwight moody that sent a half million souls to jesus christ i wonder if that lady hadn't had that little service in the stable how those souls would have made it in she said see that woman watching out that woman that she didn't save the soul right pay attention to the story she followed the instructions that led to the souls being saved you see that woman has something to do and you might think that your part is so insignificant but that little part you got to do it it was for a purpose she was made a wash woman for a purpose little old watch woman cleaning the church making sure that the floor is vacuumed making sure that the bathroom's clean and we all people don't want to clean the bathroom but that might be saving somebody's soul hallelujah watch he goes on to say he says uh same sermon next paragraph he says don't despise where god has got you but serve your purpose why because there's coming a great victory day one of these days oh praise that make me want to shout right there you mean me cleaning around the toilet i don't i shouldn't despise don't despise cleaning that toilet you clean that toilet the best of your ability don't do it halfway oh my serve your purpose my sister my brother amen amen why your blessing your victory is attached to your purpose let me say it like this your victory is your purpose you can't despise where god got you some of us we try we're saying but you know when you start off if you drive no cala you know you got to get on the turnpike you know in order to get on the turnpike you got to have some money to pay the tolls you know some people that start off on the road they're like man we got a long way to go don't despise that beginning that's just the start of things that is to come amen amen but we got in our car we left home and i forgot a couple things at the house so uh deep down inside of me bro jack something told me just turn around turn around i said oh no no oh man going backwards some people want to go backwards when they calling oh no no no if you didn't get it back then just keep going keep going god he'll catch you up when you get to the other side i i ordered me a nice suit online and i thought it would be here so i could have it for this this service i i got here and i didn't have my suit it didn't get delivered in time i said what i'm gonna do my wife said just go to the store and buy another one some people get so caught up with what's going on back there that they completely miss what god could be potentially bringing them to up here now i got two suits [Applause] but it's because i didn't go back otherwise i would have one suit there's coming a great victory day as the song says blessings own blessings but you got to keep going with the right attitude no sister virginia amen amen amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah listen we serve a god that knows when we don't need to know when we just need to know that he knows when that's it that's it listen you are not at the mercy of any detractors you're not at the mercy of any critics there's not a critic or a hater in your life that can stop it from happening whatever it is i don't care how many times you get fired off your job i don't care how many times they tell you know when you go apply for that loan there is no bank there is no county there is no state there is no government that can keep you from the promise of god in your life amen i stood right here a couple of years ago i said i believe brother caleb would be the first uh west coast millionaire i stood right up here amen i remember it said he gonna be the first west coast millionaire i don't know how it's gonna happen it's gonna happen if it's going to happen there's some people that were ready for that but hey man i saw his mama back there she was probably thinking about the new house and all that stuff that was coming i don't know my teeth love that house i don't think she's getting rid of it but she probably think about the new car and all the other stuff that comes with it there's some people they heard that hey man we getting on board on that train but did you believe it right right because you serve a part in that happening oh help me now god wouldn't just be saying it in this room if you didn't have a part to play in that you looking at it as oh that's just for caleb but you got a part in that i went back to my church uh probably two or three years after that i was working at a dental practice i told my church i said i'll be the first uh underwood with a master's degree so i'll be the first underwood make a million dollars and you know people they get real shy up in there they say oh here come that prosperity preaching oh here he go i don't know that belongs in the message you know and uh i just put my head down in focus and i trust the lord and some things didn't work out there at the at the dental practice that i was working at and uh i decided to make a change i told my wife i said i i feel led to go into sales she said what kind of what [Laughter] i said uh i'm gonna sell me some solar panels and um at the time we have very little money and she said so once you get paid well like weekly i said no i get paid when i sell she said how easy is it i said it's pretty hard and uh she went in prayer and i was grateful she said listen as long as the lights don't get turned up and i told her i said listen i said i'm gonna do this with all my heart and i'm gonna trust the lord and listen when you're doing something you have to do it with all of your heart with all of your might with everything in you because if you do it halfway you'll get a halfway result if you say you're going to serve the lord you've got to serve him with all your heart with all your might because if you do it halfway you won't make it to heaven the song say 99 and a half i don't care if you gave 99 and a half up to your job that won't do it amen it won't do it to get into heaven either i went out there i had been uh calling brother jack to keep him updated with my progress and one thing left from another i was switching companies and different things of that nature i come over to this company and i was uh just a little sales rep back in uh april when i came over to this company uh after two months they said we we need you to uh be a regional manager there for the whole north florida region all right i started doing that there was so much growth in that brother jack it came over to me and said how would you like to be the director over divisions in the company i said would that entail i could i could have had uh one of those uh sister virginia moments or whatnot and i could have said well i i don't i don't know i don't know if i can do that i uh how people make excuses when you ask them to do something they ain't used to doing yeah i ain't never did that before i don't think i can do that i could have did that right i don't know i didn't know anything about roofing or windows or gas generators or any of that stuff they was trying to put me over i said i'll give it a try yeah i went in there i gave it all my heart all my mic went as hard as i can when they came back and told me how much i was gonna make i said well then we on track [Laughter] because when i get my millions i'm gonna make sure caleb get his hey man now i in that process we had zeke in that whole process now i have my master's degree and i'm working towards my million in the next 12 months now [Applause] some people say oh brother joe you have to why you had to brag i'm not bragging i'm trying to tell you the realities of the supernatural for me it just happened to be in in prosperity but for you it could be in your healing for you for somebody else it could be in your delivery for somebody else it can be in the baptism of the holy ghost in your life but the bottom line is it's still the same you got to give all your heart all your might you've got to trust god you've got to have confidence in him and you've got to know that you know that you know that he is going to bring it to pass have to know it you don't have to know when the lord knows when that's all right i just say it plainly so that everybody can catch it that's right amen so now you're not at the mercy of those detractors gold when you think about gold gold goes through uh the fire they put the gold through the fire now do you all know why they put gold in the fire i'm not talking about beating the gold i'm actually just putting it through the fire do you know why they put it through the fire so they put the the gold uh in the fire in order to burn everything off of it that will weaken its value all right so the reason that we're constantly what we would call being tried in the fire all right is to burn off anything that would watch this weaken the value of our testimony amen amen so the more you go through the fire the more valuable your testimony you should rejoice when you're going through great trials because the greater the trial the greater the testimony the the greater the trial the more valuable the testimony is amen so so when we're being when we're being tried in that fire you know you're not going through that just to say oh i went through something no it's so that we can prove without a doubt that there was no way other than the lord jesus christ bringing you through that test because you know there are some people who say well brother joe it's your education that made you that oh well brother joe it's you know you as a person that made you that but if i get tried through the fire hard enough you won't be able to say that right if i'm going if my situation is so so bad i've seen i've been in service and prayed over people who had stage four cancer stage four and they would have stage four cancer and that situation seemed so bad to them right but to god it was nothing but it's all about what you do with that faith will you exercise it amen so let me look at something i want to uh read this uh this scripture here it's uh revelation chapter two uh verse nine and ten revelation chapter two verse nine and ten it says i know thy works and tribulation and poverty watch now but thou art rich and i know the blasphemy of them which say they are jews and are not but are the synagogue of satan for none of those things which thou shalt suffer behold watch this or fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that you may be tried and ye shall have tribulation ten days be thou faithful unto death and i will give thee a crown of life now for me in verse 10 i get excited at the part right there that says and you shall have tribulation 10 days and the reason i get excited about that is because it says 10 days it's good to know that before i get in the situation [Music] before i get into the situation it already has a scheduled time for me to come out you know the song we singing trouble don't last always yeah we sing that song but then when we in our mess oh man when it's going in you know your trials have an end date the trials have an end date that's the part that gets me excited is it says 10 days when i look at that i start thinking i wonder what day i'm in i feel like i'm in the ninth day brother jack i'm excited that's the way i worship god when i come to church you gotta worship him like you on day 9. [Applause] some of you are worshiping them like you on day two oh help me lord jehovah [Music] you got to praise them like you on day nine everybody should be trying to figure out what's wrong with you [Music] i'm on the ninth i'm always on day 9. i i don't i don't want to always live in dayton because i feel like if i'm in day 9 then i have something to look forward to god has a watch remember he has a watch he has a calendar he has his own he knows it in from the beginning we already said that but also remember there's a time and season as paul said for everything right so that means that nothing is just running around chaotic all right it's not just chaos happening we look at what's going on right now and uh the government and with the uh covert it seems like it's all just kind of chaotic right now you know everybody's trying to figure out what's going to be the next move and things of that nature but do you know that this was all on god's calendar he already had it planned out and then i got something else for you do you know that there's an end date for this some of y'all think it's a vaccine but i think it's the rapture hey praise the lord you can stand get in line for the vaccine i'll get in line for the rapture how about that glory be to god i mark that on my calendar ah i ain't against the vaccine you go get it but i'm looking for the rapture amen amen you gotta you gotta make sure that you you don't put too much focus on one thing and forget the other that's right i think that's what john said he said come back to your first love amen let me keep going here so we got god is has already created everything that is required to be in his plan everything that's on the earth right now has an appointed time of which it is to come so god created specific things first watch now he's so smart he's so infinite he created specific things first for a specific time exact time 1958 brother brown says uh and you must be born again he says now we'll have to use a imagination here as to make a drama then the great holy spirit went forth and spread forth his wings over the earth and began to brood for a purpose and that was to bring forth something to project what god was as i said the other night which was first a sinner or savior i want you to pay attention to this this is very important because god is so infinite that he's already put things in your life ahead of time to help you get through the trials that are on the way so he says which was first a sinner or a savior he said what's this about any anyhow he said which was first a healer or sickness he said why certainly a healer well why did we ever become sinners then it had to be that way if god is a savior he had to have something to say so there's nothing wrong it's just all working his way so there's nothing wrong right now what's going on with the with uh biden and kevin uh uh camelot is it kamila mrs harris there's nothing wrong with with uh them being in office some people are oh my god we got a woman person there's nothing wrong it's all working his way calm down take a deep breath put your shoes up put your feet up he said now uh i don't i couldn't say uh this to sinners i'm saying it watch to ministers and children of god i wonder how many ministers and children of god we got here this morning he ain't talking just to the people out there he's talking to you and i this morning amen he says it's all working all right no matter what we do or do not do it's going to come out all right because what god foreknew he ordained now notice then as it's moving around as it is it's coming out all right there's no need of us worrying because it's going to be that's why i don't worry about kobe brothers i decided i said i said my wife she said what are we going to do you got newborn and you you know you go out there you work out there in the field and you come in contact with people you know what are we going to do i said it's going to be okay i said listen i'm i'm one of those believers who believe that if i was to get kovacs god is obligated to heal me amen amen i believe that do you know why because if he don't heal me then he's got to take me into eternal life so if i'm here if i'm going to be present in this body he's got to heal me i know if it's my time if you take me home i'll be ready to go home with the lord there's some people that said my brother joe practice wisdom now you know i practice wisdom i wear my mask when i go out and different things of that nature but i'm not afraid of no code i walk in the presence of kobe the same way i walk in the presence of other demon spirits like those spirits that you go to when you're at the south florida fair yeah you go right out there you just walk around and you do what you got to do get on your ride and go home it's the same thing i do when i go out in the midst of colby it's the same demon it's a demon lord brandon said every sickness is a devil that's all it is it's the same devil with new tricks [Applause] new clothes same devil some of y'all realize i'm the same joe i'm just 30 now i'm not five years old anymore you probably realize that sometimes up there go joe again that's him i said yeah that's a little joke he's still a joke i'll be 50 years old that still be calling me little joker what happened ain't nothing changed it's going to be all right i'm still joke amen he's still god hebrews 13 tonight jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever if he healed leprosy why he can't heal cody amen all right i didn't mean to go so deep in there [Laughter] so before there was a sinner the first thing was there was a savior the savior had to be first you imagine if you were in your sinful condition and there was nothing nobody could do about it because there was no savior oh man can you imagine being sick with covert but there was no way to be healed from it oh man that's eternal sickness so there had to be a healer first they had to be a savior first they had to be a deliverer first before covert 19. powerful powerful thought so before man's opinion there was god's word [Music] catch it now before the doctor could diagnose that was jesus he was the discerner right he knew the situation so we got to bring our focus back to what came first otherwise there's no way for you to overcome because you have your focus in the wrong area right so some people are spending more time uh evaluating you know what's wrong than simply thanking the lord for the promise the solution to the answer now i want to read this quote this is uh let me see here this is 1961 expectations i want us to paint it this is a fairly long quote i'm going to read the whole thing i want those who here is believing god for something supernatural by raising hands i want you to pay close attention very very close attention to this quote brother says it says god still remains god he lives today he's just as much alive as he ever was he's god now when the priesthood was done away with then we got the new priesthood and now there has a new urum thumbin that also with this priesthood and that is god's word god's word is god's urem thumb and we believe that so that means now we're not just talking about the bible now we got to bring this all all the way around god's word is his message in the bible you cannot separate the two because if you do that you're going to make a mistake it has to flash before the year i'm thumbing all right so we're all on the same page he says then if god promises anything in the bible and you can accept it with all your heart and believe it to be so notice here in this this little piece and you can accept it with all of your heart and there's a conjunction word believe it to be so he said you'll see the supernatural of god's word take place and manifest the thing that you have believed for but see if you believe in brother jack for the wrong thing then that's what will be made manifest so if you don't believe that you'll receive then you won't that's right amen no matter what it is if you believe it the word of god is a seed it's sold in the human heart and if there's some uh nothing there to hinder it just like when god makes a decision it's his ultimatum and if you have an ultimatum that god's just the same when them two comes together something's got to happen it just can't keep from happening see and if your ultimatum is the same as god's then something must take place if god makes a statement it's got to be that then when you take your stand that that is true something has got to take place so if god says something watch now not just here if he said it on the tape oh help me somebody then it's got to take place i don't know i don't know i don't know if you get it i remember my grandfather told me he was listening to a tape in the church uh and he heard uh i don't know was it was it is it rachel i can't remember somebody had heard his name on there and began to rejoice when brother branham had uh mentioned his name because they said well brother wesko he was sending to that person on the tape but we was in church listening to that tape and therefore he was saying it to you so if he makes a statement you can receive it in real time because remember now god's time ain't like ours the lord knows when his time is perfect we can be listening to messages from years ago and experiencing the same anointing from then right now [Music] he says it's got to he says and men in all ages watch this when they have heard the voice of god speaking to them they have seen the supernatural and they have expected watch and live their life expecting this to happen and it never did ever fail never did it ever fail why because they lived their life under that expectation just off of what they heard the voice of god saying now watch abraham expected that baby to come even down to 25 years after it was promised to him he was still expecting it just the same way when he was 100 years old as he did when the promise was made at 75 and the bible said that he never got weak but he got stronger all the time i wonder how many of us our faith increases the longer we wait on the blessing you know that's hard to do you know because as time goes on you start to kind of be like who come on already you know but abraham as time went on the prophet said but he got stronger all the time believing that god would do it could you imagine an old man now 75 years old and a woman well i says of 65 she was barren and he was sterile ain't no way no baby coming out of this well hold on hold on hold on a minute you mean abraham could not conceive and neither could how did they have children you know because see now you look at the story between abraham and uh hagar and now you notice there's a there's two miracles happening here because abraham the prophet said was sterile so how the heck i get pregnant [Music] oh we paid a lot of attention to the story of abraham and sarah we didn't catch that part where i go so now we keep going it says and here they went now was going to go down to a doctor at the hospital to make arrangements for a bed all right they're going to have a baby yep did i skip did i go too far no um they're going to have a baby yep 65 year old woman 75 year old man what would the doctor say the poor old couple little off their head you know that i got told that a couple of times oh joe's a little off y'all he's i am a little off i really am a little off you got to be a little off to believe the message just a little bit you have to be you you can't be completely sane you believe that the prophet really caught those conditions out in the prayer line you have to be a little off you believe that the red sea was part of you have to be just a little right come on now you got to be a little off you believe that daniel slept in the lion's den you just have to you can't be completely sane to believe that can't be so he says well now anybody that really takes god's word at face value is considered a little off at the head because it's so supernatural the natural world doesn't know anything about it he says it's it's foolish to the carnal mind so you'll never understand it he says but abraham believed it he said it's true and he believed it was i can hear him as he would say to sarah now we're going to have this baby honey it's settled because god said so she brought up the bird eye and the pens and got everything ready and made the booties and was already now listen to me if you're saying lord i'm believing you for a child you should be doing like what sister rebecca did she had uh had me buying uh baby blankets baby booties we had so many clothes for zeke before he was born and he ain't even had a chance to wear anything all right you gotta get the booties ready get the pins the bird eye y'all with me this morning some people say they believe they're gonna get healed or they believe that they're gonna this is gonna happen and you ain't even prepared for it you don't even have the room ready we're gonna put it you gotta have a room ready i'm all right he said uh and after the first so many days 28 days how are you feeling dear no different honey praise god we're going to have it anyhow my god first month pass no different second month first year second year how you feeling darling no different glory to god it's gonna be a bigger miracle than it was two years ago it's two years older now amen and when 25 years had passed he still had the same attitude just the same why because god says so how do you know cause god says so how do you know you're gonna be healed because god says how you know you're gonna be delivered because god it's been 50 years amen so that settles it if god says so there's no more to be said about it see he said so and at a hundred years old he still believed god that god would do it you know i wonder how many people was mad at abraham you know because he was like little king in the in the city there i wanna you know he go walk up like brother solomon you know 25 years of this all i'm in oh he giving me my wife we can't have a baby brother we're gonna have a baby i need your help uh building the crib you know uh at the house you mind coming by this weekend it's like you're 25 bro simon's going brother abraham you haven't even conceived you know i don't want to waste my time building a crib you know putting that critter together like four or five hours you know i wanna imagine you know some people were probably upset with him say oh you know what i want a bigger tent for the baby you know what let's have our workers build a bigger tent build a bigger tank let's make a little uh like a little toy for the baby it was probably like abraham's 20 25 years abraham let it go man let it go it's all right it's all right you can you can call our kids your kids you know you call our kids they're your kids that's what god meant that's a good point that's good yeah you know my brother did that to me you know because he had like five i think starting five now and so uh he was like man you know joe my kids your kids i said lord i'm gonna have my own they mine and i'm having mine amen nothing wrong with that then for the better you're going he said now the bible said in hebrews 4 that abraham staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but with strong giving praise to god and we are supposed to be abraham's seed for we who are dead in christ are abraham's seed is that right the holy spirit makes us abraham see abraham was not a jew abraham was a gentile but it wasn't jew nor gentile it was his faith in god's word was what made him to be an heir of the promise and we being dead in christ watch this we being dead in christ our abraham's seed and our heirs with him according to the promise i'll tell you that's true we are but sometimes sometimes brother jack we don't act like it you ever seen someone who's supposed to believe the message not acting like they believe that's why it's so important to follow the instructions because there's moments if you're not careful you'll begin to act like all right sometimes we go and say well i'll go and be prayed for i'll see what happens well i don't feel a bit different abraham see he says oh my he said that's a poor excuse even for a church member let alone being abraham seed abraham see don't look at no circumstance it looks at the word of god amen that's all right yes ma'am amen amen joe you don't understand it's hard man at school you know i'm surrounded by influences well i'm looking at abraham see you know who you are you are the influence of the school you are the influence on that job you know of all my life i've never been in a position as as an officer in any company to where now when we sit down in the conference room they say joe what should we do i'll be like oh the weight of the world is on my shoulders i never experienced that before but it should be of no surprise i'm abraham c amen amen to tell y'all what we should do that's how you should talk to the devil let me tell you what you gonna do satan you're going to get up out of my house yes she is you're going to get up out of my children you don't have no place in here i'm the officer i run this i'm i'm abraham's seed well hold on what you say doctor i have gout hold on now i appreciate you i know you got a job to do but did they tell you on my uh chart that i'm abraham c they tell you that now i know you got a job dude but i got my job to do too so stay right here satan in the name of jesus i cast you out to the same pit that you came from you and the other spirits that came with you you got to tell them why you think the spirit has jesus cast us into the swine you got authority to cast demon spirits to where you want them to go not just tell them to leave tell them where to go [Applause] come on that's why i said i'm having a boy oh having a child no we're having a boy you have the authority to speak thus said the lord specifics it sounds so simple and it is you are the royal seed of abraham you have no reason for being poor the bible says the poor will be with you he don't say you have to be poor amen i started changing the way i started asking for things i said lord you know i'd be asking you lord to give me 60 000 a year 70 000 a year that's why i only made that lord i asked you to give me six figures that's why i made it cause i asked for it yeah now i said i told my wife i said i promise you about this time next year i'll make a million dollars look at the position i'm in now why is it you have to believe it with all your heart you can't just say it you have to believe it with all your heart can't be no doubt that's why i ask how many y'all only believe i don't want to just know if you believe that some people believe and they kind of like wishy-washy day-to-day you got to only believe it [Music] [Applause] i'm gonna find a place to close here we the children of abraham man that's good man that's good you know abraham was rich my great great great great great great great great grandfather was rich i'm walking around here with my head now i'm making 30 000 a year i ain't picking on you but my god you know your great great great great great great great great yeah amen amen you know i was at my grandfather's house this weekend he uh you know we we were uh getting on the same you know brother wesker likes to drink coca-cola those of y'all who know him just like my great-grandmother his mother um and so you know i keep telling stop you can't drink that it's not good for you you can't drink that well what's going to say but i drink whatever i want [Laughter] you know who i am son of god can't get mad at that man can't get mad at that

family you was born in you're a son of god you're a daughter of god every demon power has to listen to you the whole earth is growing and waiting on you to get the revelation of it a whole earth you got people at work waiting on you to tell them what to do and you don't even know it right you got the state of florida waiting on them they waiting on you to tell them what to do the state of florida there's a land down the street real jack it's waiting on you to tell it what to [Applause] [Music] do y'all better wake up when i go around i'm telling them i'm abraham's seed i'm add to the promise that land is my land i feel like caleb joshua you tired that's fine hebron belongs to me you don't have to make that million i'll go get it you don't want to send the whole army i go by myself but the promise is mine if it's a one-man invasion it's mine come on somebody you know i think i think i think brother jack when you do that fast i think we should times the church i think we should challenge the church i'm not gonna be here i'm not gonna be fasting with y'all i'm gonna be real keep it real 100. that's what they say y'all going fast i'm not um i will intermittent fast but i'm not going dang it fast tried that i almost lost my wife to it one time um i thought it was times the church was that you know if we remove all of the carnal things out of the picture when we fast because see fasting is supposed to be spiritual but a lot of times we occupy our minds with things and we're not focused on what the the fast is for we're just eating meals in a different way that's carnal but i wonder if we could change the church so you know what church how about this how about we don't watch no tv during that timeframe turn the sports off how about we get in prayer church you know what it's a funny thing i was told by uh the owner of my company one time he he said uh joe if you show up to work on time for a certain period of time i give you an additional thousand dollars just to show up on time i wonder if we challenge the church but jack church if y'all show up on time 10 30 start the service on time at 10 30. start on time i wonder if god don't give you all the land that y'all looking for i wonder if god don't open up the doors and the opportunities i ain't nobody special i'm just a little joe but i wonder i wonder if we challenge the church to be sincere that's all it is it's justin said i ain't nothing ain't trying to take your phone away from you and all that i'm asking you to be sincere i i wonder if we ask the church to be sincere if god don't do like what he promised and malachi opened the windows and pour out blessings that you don't even have the room in this building because i heard there's been growth going on but i wonder if he'll pour out blessings that you don't have room in this building that you have to get another building in order just to contain the blessing amen amen don't know when brother jack but the lord knows when i don't think zacchaeus knew when but the lord knew when i don't think elizabeth knew when but the lord knew when mary didn't know when but the lord joseph didn't know when but the lord amen hallelujah thank you lord amen god's timing is perfect isn't it lebron said god's timing he said it doesn't just miss a tick he's right where he needs to be but we have to be right where we need to be now i've seen people they have gone through struggles they've gone through crying times and musicians you can come i've seen people go through struggles trying times i've seen people go through a season of struggle i've seen other people go through seasons plural of heartache struggle trouble they just couldn't seem to figure out how am i gonna come out of this thing and it's easy for people a lot of times to say you know uh just do this when you're going through that problem and you'll get through it and things like that it's easy for us to say that but it's hard to do it at times however this is why your faith must be built up and who you know which is jesus christ i identify with my father i am a son of god i am abraham c i believe i receive we sing these songs i believe i believe i receive i receive you know but do you really really really just ask yourself evaluate your own self do i really really believe it like that i mean this is a different level of faith this is like that faith that i'm taking into the rapture do i really have the faith to believe it like that the bible says there's a time for everything under the sun i believe we're in a time now this pandemic period this this cove at 19 i believe that god's purpose for covet was to try the faith of the believers to see will you really believe or will you back up in fear will you back up in doubt when you back up and unbelief my auntie tends to sing us all uh he may not come when you want him but he'll be there right on time right in the nick of time he's on time god yes yes galatians six says let us not be weary and well doing for in due season we shall reap you sell but you've got to go through that season that appointed period of time and you're going to probably ask me later on so i've been going through this how do i get through it um we i preached a sermon at uh my home church titled how to overcome a crisis and the answer was very basic the only way to overcome a crisis is to live through it just don't die in it just live in it that's how you overcome it because it ain't going away if it's a crisis it's there you only got one thing to do live and not die right take another breath i asked a 92 year old i said man how you how you how you doing this man you standing alive is youthful he said oh i'll tell you the secret to a long line so how he said take a breath he said if you stop breathing that's the end and while these things sound simple sometimes it's hard to take that breath but you got to take that breath you got to take that message you can't go around that message my brother i don't care if you you got some little bit of unbelief in your mind you've been questioning things in the message get that out as quickly as you can because the devil he'll try to take you on a detour he'll try to he'll try to make you take a shortcut you think it's short but really that's a bypass of your blessing the lord's saying go all the way to the very end y'all believe that's that right this song says the presence of the lord is in this place the presence of the lord is in this place so we seek his face he is here in this place i'm sorry there's nothing like the presence of the lord oh there is nothing like the presence of the lord there's nothing like there's nothing like the presence of the lord there's nothing like the presence of the lord so we seek his face oh as we seek his face he is here in this place there is nothing like the presence of the lord oh there's nothing there is nothing like the presence of the lord i believe he's here this morning that's why i'm singing it there's nothing like there's nothing like the presence of the lord whatever you need this morning he's here well as we seek his face he is here in this place oh there's nothing like the presence of the lord you believe that there's nothing like healing there's nothing like the healing of the lord there's nothing like the healing of the lord as we seek his face as we seek his face is here in this place

nothing i'ma praise god in advance hallelujah somebody my god the lord knows when the lord knows when god bless you brother joe we certainly appreciate the word of the lord oh this day my god how appropriate amen the word is and brother joe was talking about how he walks into meetings now and everybody's looking at him like what we gonna do you know joe what we gonna do what are we gonna do well they don't understand they call him job because that's short for something amen that's short for joseph and there was a joseph in the bible that they was also asking what they were supposed to do amen because only joseph had the answers amen glory to god so we we thank god for these things and and and and and and i um you know that the rest of that scripture uh brother brother joseph uh focused on when the lord turned so the lord knows when but the other thing in that scripture it tells us that uh we're gonna sow in tears come on somebody we're gonna sow some things in tears but there must come a season when we begin to reap enjoy and i don't know about you but i stepped into my joy season glory to god i'm stepping into my reaping time amen i've been sowed in tears but now it's time for me to reap enjoy come on somebody amen i'ma reap with my children imma reap with my family i'm gonna reap i'm a reek with the church we gonna reap hallelujah my god lord jesus this is all right i feel all right church glory to god amen amen amen amen amen i tell you what i i am i'm i'm walking in this my victory is attached to my purpose amen uh i like brother jose i'm a little off so y'all just excuse me amen if a man i'm a little off because i believe the word of god and i'm not ashamed of who i am amen i'm willing to follow the instructions i ain't taking those shortcuts amen glory to god and i'm responding with a praise to a prophetic word [Music] i said i'm responding with a praise to a prophetic word lord jesus i thank you for your word here amen on this day this is this is all right brother joe made a comment that i think we all need to just reflect on he said we ought to issue a challenge to the church a man during this season of fasting and and um that certainly that was something that the lord just put in my spirit and i meant to mention it but uh you know we there's other things and this is it's probably the only day in all of history that we've had so many distractions uh you know back back in you know brother branham's day they didn't have all the distractions that we have nowadays before that time you know tv was just coming out back then radio was just coming out some of the snakes in here remember when they got their first radio in their house right and uh you know and how they just sit around just listen to the radio you know those those things were that was new new technology so they didn't have all the distractions that we have today so we have to we have to when we're fasting it's not just the food it's not just changing our diet and some will eat no food at all that's perfectly fine but i think another challenge is let's let's separate from social media let's separate from all the things that just kind of keep us so busy let's get to a spot where we can just sit and just listen to the lord hallelujah even if he don't speak sit and listen anyway glory to god but you sit down and just read your bible and listen to a tape or listen to a service do something just to stay in the presence of god but let's let's take the next 21 days when we start we got next week but after that we're going to be entering into this corporate time of fasting i believe god gonna do something for us i was also thinking that if we would just really put a man the church in the school on the top of our prayer list during that time of fasting let's see what god does for us let's just see what god does for us i got i got a confidence that our god is about to move do something supernatural amen something that blows our mind something that we're gonna have to give him glory and praise for hallelujah oh glory praise the lord let's just bow on a word of prayer amen dear god we are grateful for the word of the lord that has come forth to our hearts on this day god truly you know when and god we want to approach it father with the faith god knowing that you are turning things amen around you're turning it around and uh lord we have sowed in tears but now the time has come for us to reap enjoy lord i pray that amen this would just not just be a word spoken but father to be something that becomes manifestation in the lives of your people thank you for this atmosphere of worship lord and praise and adoration so good to see the saints get free whatever it is that the enemy was trying to bind them with lord a release amen in this atmosphere lord is the greatest thing we could ever ask for father i pray that lord as the people would leave that they would go meditating on the things that they've heard here today and god uh i believe somebody god there's maybe a promise that they've been holding to i believe lord the the seeds of manifestation lord were birthed today i believe that old god and i just asked lord jesus that you were just uh lord work in us your perfect will god do great things in our midst we are at a junction and we look for the supernatural we thank you for the testimony that our lord that started here in this place and lord how brother joe told us just be obedient to the instructions that are being given and lord in that obedience just the simple things it's the simple things god that we overlook but it's the simple things that cause you oh god to move on our behalf lord our lord just a simple walk down amen and just give god praise after you come through the prayer line and lord as they did that three months later a pregnancy took place in place and now we see the birth of the baby god lord we know that you are an on time god and we know that there is nothing no matter what anybody says
