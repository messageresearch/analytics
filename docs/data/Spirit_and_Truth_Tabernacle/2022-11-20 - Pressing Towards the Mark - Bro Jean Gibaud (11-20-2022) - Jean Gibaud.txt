when brother brother Mike is what I know him as in Zimbabwe he has a Ministry where he prays for the sick and um when that brother pray he prayed with such Authority he knows his place as a Son of God and he always tries to anoint the faith of the person that's praying for that they would recognize who they are as children of God Amen we don't have to accept everything the devil does amen and one thing we're gonna do always we're gonna use our weapon of Prayer no matter what it is we're gonna use our weapon glory to God Amen we believe God for the impossible amen good to be in the house of the Lord uh this morning amen uh so good to have uh brother Stephen and sister Rachel and man with us praise the Lord and my soul sister Jessica back there amen good to have her with us as well amen and um I was a few months ago brother Armstrong had his meetings there and and um um I saw uh I was there in Arizona and I was looking at the services I saw from the gene come up and preach I said man we ain't had him in a long time and um and I was just blessed by the services and I was there fellowshipping with my brother and sister Robles they made it safely to New Jersey uh just a few months ago and they were telling me just the history of them living in Port St Lucie and driving to Lake Worth Florida where brother Gene's father was a pastoring there at the church and and how they was driving for two years they say they really didn't understand because things were being spoken in Creole but they were going anyway faithfully and I said my God so you know they when they brought his name up again I say my you know we haven't had brother Gene in a while and so we need to get him to come down so send him a text and say brother just let me know what what's available on your schedule and he said today was the day that he was available so we're happy to have him with us on today and man and he and he didn't come alone amen he brought his precious wife with him amen and um This this term that we like to use down south he brought the chilling amen the children praise God but it's good to have them all Amen in the house of the Lord on today praise the Lord praise the Lord [Music] um um I wanted to uh also just give thanks I know that many came and helped on on Thursday they had a a another turkey drive and a lot of turkeys were given out to different ones that uh you know maybe they have neither maybe they don't have any but they got blessed anyway with the turkey and uh it was just a wonderful wonderful opportunity and as we are you know finishing that going into our Christmas season just asking uh that uh we give gift cards for the Christmas Eve we and like I said we'll have some cards we're gonna have something there for you just some cars so you can fill out and just put your gift card in and just drop it in a little box we'll have that set up for you uh but we want to just be a blessing Amen to those in our community and just just spread the love of Christ and don't don't just sign the card God bless you make that the end of the of your signature but write a little note put a script to something just to encourage people amen that Jesus loves them amen you don't know who that card might go into the hands of so pray over it ask God to give you inspiration uh for what you're saying because you don't know what it might say to somebody so we want to do all or we can amen like I told you the turkeys were actually taken care of because somebody donated five thousand dollars to the to the pantry so we were able to take care of that but uh but we we still want to do our part amen here in the community so let's just let's just get prepared for that you can start bringing that and you know again we're I have cards for you to fill out other things one of the sisters that mentioned to us it'll be good that if the young people can be a part of that giving out when we're giving out those cards we'll let you know what day we want to do it but if our young people get involved in that that would be really really good uh sometimes our youth don't realize how blessed they are you know they don't realize how blessed they are and to you run into people that don't have what you have amen all right amen other kids that they ain't got what you got so so sometimes it's just good to you know get out of the community and just look around sometime even even I I encourage people travel go go to other countries uh you'll stop complaining amen We complain about the least of things and uh you know but people go through a lot more than what we go through here amen my God your lights off uh you couldn't last five minutes with them like so if you calling FPL you're these people go with that likes all the time right so so we just we just thank the Lord amen but if we can we try to get some of our youth involved we'll let you know the date and time that we want to try to do that so uh keep that in mind amen as we're approaching the holiday season uh this morning amen we uh have for the very first time in church amen this young man praise the Lord my first time ever meeting him I heard about him but at my first time ever meeting him and we're going to dedicate him to the Lord amen uh uh I got the middle name is Shepherd Shepherd Jeremiah Shepherd so what a name and uh I wish I would have thought of something like that you know but uh we want to have a member of the Jerry and his wife sister Melissa amen and they're gonna bring their newborn uh son as we just uh dedicate them to the Lord amen on uh this morning let me just read a scripture and a man just a portion of a quote two scriptures as they are making their preparation a Luke 18 Luke 18 verse 15 through 17. amen Luke 18 verse 15 through 17 it says and they brought unto him also infants that he would touch them but when his disciples saw it they rebuked them but Jesus called them unto him and said suffered a little children to come unto me and forbid them not for such for of such is the kingdom of God verily I say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall end no wise enter therein Amen brother Branham told us in the message of paradox it says now therefore we bring them and dedicate them any mothers any church any Crete any color anything else we dedicate all little children to the Lord Jesus Christ I know in the Catholic Church what they do is they sprinkle sprinkle kids I remember having a friend on my job and uh man he never went to church never never went to church I remember he had his first son you say Jack I'm going to church on Sunday you going to church never went to church I said okay he said yeah I'm going to church we're going to have the baby uh dedicated I'm like okay so it wasn't dedicated they wanted the baby would be sprinkled because in their in in the Catholic faith they say if a child is sprinkled then it guarantees them access to heaven and I said no that ain't true at all that child got to repent at some point in time they need to recognize that they're centers and they have to repent of their sins so um you know we we don't we don't sprinkle babies but we dedicate them to the Lord we pray over the parents that God would bless them uh to be able to raise the child the right way the first example of Christianity that the child can see is in their parents amen so praise the Lord another scripture I just want to read really quick over Jeremiah it's from the book of Jeremiah chapter 1 verse 4. then the word of the Lord came unto me saying before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb sanctify thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations praise the Lord amen foreign [Music] [Music] God bless you all amen let's pray over Jeremiah father we're so grateful for this bundle of joy that you've brought to brother Jerry and sister Melissa now they come today to dedicate them back to you as you've given him to them I pray God that you have blessed This Little Child God that you would keep of all of his days Lord that you were raising For Your Glory may his parents be the best example of Christianity that he could ever follow and Lord we just trust o God that you would keep them Father from the things of this world and God we realize that there's so much that is against them but God if you are for him then who can be against him so we pray Lord for Jeremiah Shepherd Lord that you would just lay your hands on him even today God that you would anoint him Lord for the life amen a life of service and dedication to you God father we pray that you would just meet every need that these parents would have with God in raising him we thank you Lord for your Provisions so far and God we know that you'll do more for them God so we just commit them down to your hands bless this family God is in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen praise the Lord [Music] you don't make no noise at all but you got your eye on everything I see that God bless you brother God bless you [Music] praise the Lord amen thank the Lord man the church is growing uh we we so appreciate amen these uh babies that the Lord is Blessing amen us with and um uh God is good so I'm not going oh oh I'm sorry I got a few announcements um so this Wednesday no service amen no service on Wednesday uh the beautiful thing today Brothers is that we do not have to break down uh we can leave everything as it is because there'll be nobody in the school all week and we'll just leave it as it is and come back to it next week um so no Services Wednesday we'll be back on next Sunday morning for our prayer service from nine to ten and um in our regular service will start at 10 30 on next Sunday looking forward to that uh we will continue our streaming through uh Twitter Facebook and our church website john423.org and then uh our brothers will be having a virtual prayer service on Tuesday night at 7 30 P.M amen so keep that in mind and also the upcoming meetings uh brother uh steaming and the Believers there and Sarasota having their anniversary meetings House of fellowship and that start no next Friday Saturday and Sunday so keep that in mind uh as I mentioned I will be away both actually myself and by the smile of the way that we can we were invited to go to um uh brother Caleb Duran in Arizona and um and so we'll be preaching actually for both brother Caleb and for brother Israel and uh it's going to be me and brother Smiley and and sister Erica and sister Gene amen going out on the trip so you all keep us in prayer amen as we as we go there and we're just looking forward to all that God has in store um there's some other things going to be happening I was just kind of thinking this morning so I actually don't think I'll be speaking on a Sunday morning until Christmas Day because we got guest ministers or other ministers in the church to be speaking lined up to speak but I know that brother Diggs is coming the weekend after he'll be coming we'll have a Friday night service and a Sunday morning service and then my son-in-law brother Aaron supposed to be coming as well and he's going to preach one of them Sundays and and then we'll go from there and I need to just mention some to you all about Christmas the school has called me already and said they're not gonna have anybody here to open for us on Christmas day so I am going to be working on finding another place for us to worship on Christmas Day and I will let you know where that's going to be and I tell you what I said um eventually ain't nobody gonna be able to tell us when we can worship him when we can't worship so I I say well praise the Lord so we just keep praying amen but I'm gonna I'm gonna be looking uh for something the Lord already start dealing my heart about a sermon for Christmas Sunday so I just I'm just um just trusting God gonna open up something I got something in my mind I need to make some phone calls about our giving is uh through cash app sale or PayPal that's for those that are online uh for a cash app you use dollar signs Spirit of Truth tea that's our handle for sale you use the email address of giving at john423.org we have mentioned before PayPal is taking fees so we really try not to use them that's why they last on the list amen but they uh we want what we want to encourage you try to use cash episode if you're going to use online if you want to use the mail that's that's perfectly fine spiritual Tabernacle PO Box 222462 in West Palm Beach Florida 33422 also for those that are inside the house of the Lord we have a box in the back on the back table you can just drop your offering in the Box hey man let's pray over our giving amen and then um what we will do is invite precious brother Gene the boat to come Amen to the pulpit at that time amen let's pray father we thank you for the privilege and the opportunity we have to to give we uh thank you that you have provided as we're

you have provided you have sustained you have made ways out of no ways you have blessed businesses you've blessed people to have jobs God you have not failed in in any area you have touched us in our health oh my the devil might have thought he would have took us out by now but God said not so and we're still here giving you the glory and the honor and the praise so father Lord as we come Lord just bring in just a portion of our income back to you through tithing and through offering we pray that you use it for the furthest of your kingdom here on Earth o God and Lord how we are God our under expectation that you will open a door for us to be able to purchase our own building glory to God our school and build all these little little ones that you're giving us the next amen phase of s.a.t virtual Resource Centers Lord already here they're here on the scene so God there must be a place where we can teach them Father the things of God and educate them appropriately Lord we ask that you God would just go before us and may we just continue to be patient and wait for you to do what you said that you're going to do God you said you're going to plant Us in the land assuredly you'll Rejoice over us over us to do us good and you'll plant Us in Atlanta shortly father we're expecting you to do exactly what you said you would do bless our giving today fathers in Jesus Christ's name are we ask him as brother Gene would come Lord to minister the gospel thank you for him and his family being with us today use them for your glory and for your honor Lord speak to our hearts in the only way that you can Father and Jesus Christ's name we ask him amen amen praise the Lord you all stamped to your feet amen and let's welcome a precious brother Gene gebold Amen to the pulpit because I know he holds my future in life is worth the living chance because he lives come on everybody sing with all your heart because he lives whoa because he lived [Applause] [Music] my life [Music] [Applause] [Music] is worth the living just because he lives one more time because he lives [Music] oh I can't face tomorrow [Music] because I know oh yes I know he holds my future and life is worth the living just because [Music] amen amen you love him this morning amen maybe as you continue to play that softness by our hearts Heavenly Father we just come before your throne of grace father we're just so appreciative of what you've done for us the Lord and father we just ask that you just come and minister to us in a very special way you know the needs of your people dear Lord and as a mortal man I would fail the Lord to meet any of these needs but the God there's a there there's a redeemer the lord and there is a a savior someone that we could turn to and I prayed to God that you would just come in a very special Mighty way and minister to every knee this morning to God exceed every expectation the Lord have preeminism this morning's service take full control to God we commit all things into your hands and we'll be careful to give you the praise and glory that you alone are worthy of and the bride says amen amen God bless you Saints it's certainly good to be back in the house of the Lord that's all the singing amen if you have your Bibles turn with me the Philippians chapter 3. always appreciate the invitation to come uh uh come this way and have some fellowship and uh good to see brother Smiley didn't think I'd see him and so it's good to see him again and just appreciate him appreciate every one of you amen just appreciate what the Lord's doing in our lives amen you love him this morning appreciate Brothers jacked up it's just uh I always say this you know when um brother Brown says that the closest thing to happen here on Earth is the pulpit and when you stand behind The Minister's desk you know there's a great deal of responsibility that comes with that and um I know you didn't come to hear Brother Gene but you came to hear from God so if I could just step into that channel then I know you'll be blessed amen so Ephesians chapter I mean Philippians chapter 3 just a simple thought that I thought I'd just share with you we'll read that verse 10. through 14 but we'll draw our our focus and our attention from verse 13 and 14 but we'll start at verse 10 so Philippians Philippians chapter 3 verse 10. that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made comfortable unto his death if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead not as though I had already attained either were already perfect but I will but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus brethren I counted I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth onto those things which are before that's Paramount forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before and then verse 14 I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word he may be seated what a scripture and uh we're just gonna take our timer so just bear with me as we kind of build on the foundation but I like this scripture because it really resonates with me especially in the day in the hour that we're living in because uh there's so many things that are causing us uh to weigh us down to cause burden in our lives and um you know I thank God by his grace that the only reason that I'm here is because of his grace the only reason why you're here is because of his grace but it's God who strengthened me in Christ Jesus so the Bible talks about how Paul is trying to um ascertain or apprehend or achieve something that is pretty remarkable and in that he says Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended it but this one thing and he's trying to bring your attention and focus on one thing because so many times you know we could easily be distracted by so many things but if we could have a singular focus a singular attention on what you're trying to achieve it changes everything yeah we we were we were beginning to even learn this in school and business school where where they talk about you know the idea of multitasking you know some people's like you could multitask well that you know it may work for some but you it may not work for all and in most cases for the sum that it works quality is compromised because you're multitasking and I was telling my team I said you know I come to the conclusion I can't do this and do this and I got to do one thing I got to stay focused on that one thing and that's really important and so Paul is telling me this one thing I do not multiple things just one thing I do is forgetting those things which are behind because the devil has ways of reminding you of your past telling you that you have failures in your past telling you that you have shortcomings in your past telling you that you are nobody in your past and the only thing I could tell the devil that was my past but that is not my future that is not my present that is not my current circumstance so I forget the things that are behind me because the things that are behind me are covered by the blood if God can't see it then the devil can't bring it to my attention so I forget those things that are behind and I'm reaching forth and if you think about it it's as different an individual is running a race and they're racing and they're striving towards that Finishing Line are you still picking me up I feel like I lost them but I'm striving towards that Finishing Line and you're racing and you're racing and you see that the that the end is in sight and something might be pulling you back but because you're determined because you're committed you're willing to go that extra mile and so you reach out because you want to reach that Finishing Line and so Paul understood that concept and he says I press towards the mark now the very word press means move a cause to move into position of contact with something by exerting continuous physical Force so when you're pressing for something you got to constantly be in Relentless Pursuit amen amen amen because being a Christian is not anything that you means for you to be casual you gotta constantly be on the move you got to constantly be on the go we got to be constantly marching towards something I am not satisfied where I am now I'm constantly trying to be better I am constantly trying to live a more Christian Life I am constantly trying to reflect the image of Jesus Christ right so I pressed towards the mark Against All Odds when things are against you you're still pressing towards the battle and you will have circumstances that you're faced with situations that hold you back but there has to be a desire that looks at the reward and that the reward is far greater than the circumstances that you're dealing with you know the prize outweighs the circumstances and so even Jesus understood that he says the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against it so meaning that you will have some opposition and as a Christian and bear with me as I'm building this Foundation as a Christian you find yourself that you're always on the move for God and the reason being is because God is a god of movement right the Bible says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth period and the Bible says this and I want to draw this analogy that the Earth was without form and void that was the condition that the Earth was in a type of you and I with a form with a void without God but the only thing about that scripture in verse 2 of Genesis the Bible says the spirit of God moved and the only the only way that you could bring something into movement it has to be alive that's the reason why the prophet says a church without any emotion is dead you cannot come into contact with God and be the same person you cannot tell me when God has brought you through victories that you're casual about it you give God the glory you cannot tell me when you overcome obstacles that you don't get excited God was in that movement yeah because my Bible tells me that God is a consuming fire and I don't know about you but when I get lit by fire I don't stand still I don't sit down I get up and I start moving because that tells me some things don't fire for God [Music] we're going to be tested along this way you're being tested along this way and if life is good for you you might want to take a check on which side of Glory you're walking on all right cause the devil doesn't like to leave us the Sons and Daughters of God Alone there's a constant Relentless Pursuit after God your Christian walk yesterday was for yesterday today's different gotta give God praise daily you got to know what you want out of this if you decided to come to church you got to know what you came here for not to see sister and so so not to her brother so and so not to get caught up in the latest rumors gossip but you came here for something personal something more deep something more more more meaningful yeah Glory there's a story in the Bible about a woman that had a blood issue the Bible says that she had this issue for 12 years 12 years and during those 12 years the Bible also says according to Mark 5 that she went and saw many positions she went to the experts and the experts couldn't help her she went to Dr so-and-so that was the best in town and Dr so-and-so couldn't help her in addition to that the Bible says that she made many expenses come on somebody y'all could relate to what the Bible is saying this is talking about some of you we've gone to doctors we've gone to experts and it's interesting because you go to the doctor and the doctor said I send you to the experts the expert says I send you to the specialist the specialist said well go back and see your doctor and you spend this and you spend that you gotta buy medications for this You Gotta Buy medications for that and none of that really helps you and she had endured this Affliction for 12 solid years and one day she decided to go to church because she heard of the name of Jesus There's Something About the Name of Jesus that carries weight Something About the Name of Jesus that says you know what all my prayers will be answered and so Jesus decides to go for a walk and the Bible says there was a throng of people a throng of people that's through themselves at Jesus can you just imagine a crowd of people that's probably three to four times the crowd that's what that's here this morning throwing themselves at Jesus and that lady decided to go and paid Jesus a visit but she didn't come to church because somebody drug her the church she didn't come to church because she felt obligated to fulfill a religious Duty but she had in her mind that if she could only touch the Helm of His Garment you see so she knew what she wanted to get out of the service I don't go to church just to go to church I want something out of the presence of God I want to get something out of it before she even went to Jesus she heard about him and she says I know what I need to do all I need is just to Touch the Hem of His Garment and throngs the people here she is she gets the scene of where the crowd has assembled think about that saint and normally when people look at that situation it says there's no way that I have access to Jesus there's no way that this promise belongs to me there's no way I could obtain this it's too difficult it's unreachable all right that's what the devil would like you to think that house I wanted is unreachable that job I wanted is unreachable that position I wanted is unreachable the church I want is one reachable come on Saints if we could credit God who created Heavens in the Earth the great universe that I'm sure God can take care of your little problems this morning [Music] [Applause] reaching Jesus seemed unreachable to her but she did not look at the circumstances she looked at the promise [Music] if Dr sorcer can heal me if Sergeant saucer can hear me and I had to spend all these countless monies then I'm gonna Place everything I can to try to reach Jesus she labored she pressed away the crowds was pushing her back life is like that sometime it pushes you back knocks you down on your feet let the devil know you could put me down on my feet but there's a God that could Raise Me Up amen she got up and she thought she wiped the dust off of her and she pressed on everybody was touching Jesus and it didn't even stop Jesus from walking he still kept on walking Jesus was hearing all kinds of voices and noise and loud noises Jesus can you heal me Jesus I need this Jesus I need that but that little lady all she was doing when she had that blood issue the only thing that went through her mind was that when I went to Dr so-and-so they told me this didn't work and I got 12 years I got this I've been battling this for 12 years she knew what she wanted to get out of the service this was not another service and she didn't want this opportunity to pass her by this was her moment as Jesus was passing by she didn't even know if she would have another opportunity like this pressed she pressed she was relentless impressing would not give up the crowds pushed her away and finally as Jesus going by she reached out her hands she pressed towards the mark because she realized that the blood issue that has been an Affliction in our life for 12 solid years and the doctors who had filled her time and time again the medicines that could not treat her condition and the Bible says that her situation was getting worse God puts you in circumstances where the situation feels like it's so burdensome it doesn't seem like it's getting any better it seems like it's getting worse every time you pray it seems like it's getting worse every time you try to find courage it seems like it's just falling apart every time you try to fight you seem like you're getting beat up and getting knocked down but once the situation gets to a point where you can't go anymore God comes on the scene and that young lady she reaches out she stretches her arms pressing through the crowd if she can only touch the Helm of His Garment just a brush of His Garment and as the crowd was passing by that's all she needed she wasn't looking for medication she wasn't looking for a big name preacher she just said if I could just Touch the Hem of His Garment I just need to touch him that little bit of touch as the glimmer of that garment just passed by and she touched it touching Jesus is all that matters very glorious amen she grabbed a hold of that garment can you just imagine the magnitude of what that means she touched the Hem of His Garment mixed all the people that was touching Jesus God was walking and he stopped she caused the Creator of Heaven and Earth she caught the attention of God Almighty to come stop dead in this track and as simple of a statement as this was a simple of a question that was he says who touched me shy could buy a heavy burden there's something about the touch of Jesus that cause she he can better stop he says who touched me can you just imagine everybody just stood back and looked confused because of all that time that everybody was touching him he never said a thing he never responded they were they were they were hollering they were screaming but let me tell you serving God is more than hollering serving God is more than screaming you could do backflip in church and go live like the world that don't mean nothing it's how you serve God now when you're in the presence of your brothers and sisters it's how you serve God when you're out there in the world that's what makes a difference not what I see you is what they see you as what is your testimony out there they were hollering and shouting and carrying on didn't even cause Jesus to move but because she had a desire she had an anointing and she touched the Helm of His Garment it caused Jesus to stop and says who touched me even his disciples thought he was off the off the kind of off his ways what do you mean who touched you that's right I don't mean disrespectful but there's a lot of people here that touch you a lot of people touched him a lot of people hollering come on Saints we might be in a school building we may not be in an auditorium but we're touching Jesus we're inviting him right now Lord if I could test touch the Helm of your garment I may not be in a stadium but I know your presence is here this morning my house may not look like a palace but God you're invited in my house touching Jesus is all that matters the crowds somewhat moved back a little bit and the disciples was confused because that very actions of Jesus could be confusing to people sometimes he and they say everybody touched you he's like but yeah this was a different touch he says virtue up virtue went out for me and as the crowd kind of dispersed a little bit the woman comes into view and Jesus says your faith has made you all her faith the power to press on to cause God come on the scene you know I was thinking about a story just kind of on the theme of like how you could cause God to move on the scene and many of you probably know this story this mother that has this young man who got caught up with the wrong things and and he caught a disease he was dying of this disease but let me tell you no matter how grown a man may be that's the mama's boy there's something about that that child that's still mama's boy and he was dying of some sort of disease that was incurable and she began to pray and holler she needed God to come on the scene and the prophet listened to the Saints he was on his way to a trip think about this for a moment and there were people that was on the flight y'all know the story there were people that was in the plane the thing that bothered that that boggles my mind is that there were people that were probably you know families that was trying to get to other relatives business people that was trying to get to business meetings people that was trying to get to certain destination but that didn't matter to God a prayer of a mother caused a play to be grounded so that when a prophet could leave his seat to come and answer the prayer of a mother let me tell you Saints this is not only the books of Acts this is the books of act and fulfillment that didn't belong to that mother that belongs to every voice that's here this morning it didn't matter if the businessman missed his business A Mother's Prayer was too important for God [Applause] it didn't matter if you were running late to me with their relatives The Cry of a mother granted that plane [Music] if you could just speak your voice right now and say God hear my voice hear my prayer God will stop all things just to come and meet your needs speak the word in the middle of the battle David cried our son be still you have that commanding power in your voice press towards the mark of the prize of the High Calling there's another story I love stories because I could relate to them brother grandma was in a prayer line he was conducting a prayer and in the distance commotion was brewing screaming and hollering brother Brown's trying to pray brother be the father comes up to him and said Dad we got this we got this young woman out there we gotta we don't know how to handle it [Applause] [Music] well what's the situation well there's this young woman who lost her bait died in the morning rather than going to what the weather then following what the doctor said she decides to come to service that night and that she got the dead baby with her why he's having a conversation with the prophet that young woman is pressing his way pressing her way trying to get to where the promise is at she was relentless she would not give up she would not back down her child's life was at stake [Music] she was climbing over deacons going over them running around them let me tell you when you're desperate for God there's nothing to stop you from reaching your promises [Music] you can't tell me that when God puts a fire in your heart that you're just gonna be still and you're gonna let the devil roll over you I am called for this generation to rise and prove that God is alive [Music] she was holding on to Yellow death baby there was not enough ushers strong man let me tell you a storm man against the force of a mother oh come on somebody there's no stopping her she was going around him like a football player just moving them around him couldn't be stopped holding on to that baby there was no reasoning you couldn't reason with her the devil trying to reason with the devil there's no reasoning I'm A desperate Bear I'm A desperate desperate individual I'm A desperate individual I need God I know I need God on the moment my family need God I got relatives I'm praying for they need God [Applause] I'm a man of desperation I'm not here to reason with you Mr devil I'm here to reach God and only he can answer my prayers [Music] [Applause] the prophet says she went around him underneath them over them sue them she was determined to reach that promise and there's nothing that the devil could do to stop that and God started working on the other side brother man says Brother Moore she doesn't know who I am she doesn't know who I am you go down there you go down there that's brother Jack Moore started going down there got stepped in God met the need of that little woman a vision broke out and brother Ram says brother more come on back let her come forward let her come forward she knew why she came to church do you know why you're here this morning you came here for a reason he said Lord I came here for a reason I come here to the Lord because I made a promise I believe that you're able to keep that promise press towards the mark of the prize of the High Calling you know there's another story in the Bible the Bible talks about David he was in the cave of a dullum in the Philistines had taken the land but he was with his mighty men and three of the 30 which is 10 percent and the tenth being holy so God said in the state funds he totally man went up to David and David just was reflecting about definitely and know how the water tastes you know I like Pepsi [Music] I love parrie something about water [Applause] and I appreciate man for their efforts but they can't replace god-given water it just it just quenches the body whenever you like you know when you step like it's a hot day we live in Florida so we know what hot days look like it's over 100 degrees and you're out there laboring and working hard and you're burning up a sweat and you go inside and you drink some water your whole body goes into a jubilee you with me and that was David he says oh if I could drink from the Waters of Bethlehem he he didn't look at any particular person he just remarked if I could just drink let me say sometimes you may not know a scripture but because you're so connected to God you act a certain way I don't know about y'all maybe I'm just preaching to myself but there's been times I come to situations like I don't have a scripture for that but I just know that's just not christ-like sure every time my spirit Bears witness with his spirit that I am a child of God the Bible says shun every appearance it may not be evil but if it looks like it's evil come on don't get quiet on me Saints if it looks like it's part of the devil if it looks like it has nothing to do with God and it may not be but the fact that it looks like it I shun it amen son every appearance of evil and the men they heard that and they assemble themselves and they say you know what we're gonna go get King David some water my King has a desire and I'm here to fulfill it you're called for that that's why I love the Book of Esther where mother God was trying to say how do you not know that you won't call for such a day as this day you could have been born any time of History but this is the time that God has called you for how do you not know that you won't call for such a time as this they're geared up they got ready for battle because the king was thirsty [Music] God's desires is my command his desires are my command can't you move forward because they had to fight their way through a Garrison of Philistines and they fought their way through and the thing about it is that as they were fighting they had to support each other they had to have had each other's backs as they're moving fighting off the enemy one scythe they got each other's back looking constantly in prayer constantly Vigilant constantly watching I don't got money I could give you but I could pray for you I don't always have things I could give you but I could pray for you if I can then let me grab you financially if I could I could do this but I'm always gonna have your back I'm always going to watch over you they're watching each other and they'll find their way through an oppressing constantly pressing not letting up in the midst of all the chaos the swords are clashing the Sparks are flying and they finally get to their destination they scooped up a bucket of water and then they'd stop and thought and like I guess we gotta fight back now right they fought their way through and just when you think you've gotten there it's like I made it gotta go back but you know they weren't discouraged they weren't disappointed they were invigorated because that was a destination point the Bible says he that has begun a good work in me will finish it if my king wanted something to drink then God who saw me through it is obliged to take me back to my king God who's seen you this far you have endured this much let me tell you saint people don't always know the reason why you rejoice they don't know what gets you excited they don't know what motivates you I'll be seeing people at church they're so praising God you don't know the challenges they have that week [Music] you don't know the Devils they had to fight you don't know the circumstances they have to face even getting here this morning you don't know the trials the obstacles what the devil put in the way and when they break through the Garrison of the Philistines and the gig here in the morning leave them alone and let them praise God you don't know what it took just to be here this morning every blood every sweat every tear every Star every wound that's why when I see somebody praising God I don't know what they went through I don't know the challenges when you see tears flowing through the eyes you don't know what those tears are made of but God knows these men were so determined and this time what made it so unique because when they were battling their way through they were pressing their way through now I'm going to say this as delicately as possible but they could have fought with the degree of carelessness not giving any thought to how they're swinging their sword who they might hit [Music] they're just fighting and that's all right but this time they're carrying Precious Cargo [Music] they got to be mindful of how they fight they got to be thoughtful with how they say things how they treat people come on somebody because this time they're carrying something that's needed for the king we're on our way back home Saints we can act any kind of way we cannot talk any kind of way we are carrying something that is of value to God you can't treat anybody any kind of ways [Music] this time they're carrying that bucket of water and they're aligning to each other making sure that bucket is protected making sure that water sourced that life that life has to be guarded on the inside you gotta constantly be guarding that life brother man says in that in the in the church saying she says and then in that unguarded moment Satan planted a seed of complete ruination in that unguarded moment don't let your Christian walk be unguarded you gotta constantly be on guard constantly vigilant I was telling my home church I used to work for the bank I used to work for the bank and I worked in a vault and so the Vault I mean we weren't you wouldn't know because it's not like we advertise that hey the votes down here with the error pointing down so I was when I was in Charlotte North Carolina and um the amount of money that we process was in the billions of dollars a year and we would process about hundreds of millions of dollars not exaggerating hundreds of millions of dollars each day armor carriers will come by so my site was considered a tier two site it was one it was a large site so we had tons of money cash that we would deal with I mean just flows of cash hundreds hundred dollar bills fifty dollars five dollar bills everything I mean just coins and we had you know what we called um it's been a while but we had these bins that would hold massives amount of cash cash and we had five six of them just laying around and we had extreme uh protocols and so as part of my learning I went to visit another tier 2 site just to kind of gain some best practices now keep in mind when you're processing all that cash before I started working there if I came across five dollar bill I I did a backflip life was good because I came across if I found five dollar bills that I found five dollar bills yeah I can't tell me if you didn't find five dollar bills you wouldn't be excited [Music] we'd be so excited I'd be thinking well I could buy this I could buy I didn't have lunch money so you get so excited with just one five dollar bill and so but I'm I'm right here with just millions millions and so I went to go visit a site and I'm learning things and we have security protocols and measures and the site leader there was telling me Gene you know and it just it just it just it just it it it hit me home he said she says because of the amount of cash that we process we become so numb to it it's easy you become so numb to it you don't even think that you're processing millions of cash and here's the thing we have we have extreme security protocols like we had something called a a manhole where you let one person in the door and that door closed and then you validate who that person is and then you open the other door and you let that person in there's so many security measures and she says to me if someone ever goes through the pro the trouble of breaking into my sight they mean business because the way we see money is not the way they see money and I sat there and I and I started thinking all of the security measures that I might have been casual about that I let my guard down oh I know this person you never know when someone's gonna turn you don't know that person's background where all of a sudden they decide you know what that's a lot of money I'm touching bills I do this week you don't know the conversation that they're having in your absence that's how the devil's acting don't let your security measures go down don't let your guard go down the devil's constantly watching and waiting for an opportunity you gotta constantly be vigilant don't become casual kiss Christians and we weren't thinking much about it we're just leaving this so I know so and so I know so and so do you come on somebody I'm just saying we gotta exercise discernment and constantly on God we can't let those little critters in that's the reason why the Bible says I you have dominion over the fish of the sea the beasts of the the fields the Falls of the air and the creeping things of the Earth because there are things that we've let go in our lives that are creeping back into our homes because we have become unguarded we let the devil put all kinds of images in our eyes and we don't care about that anymore come on somebody we need to repress that Lord I don't want to be comfortable in this world I want to be transformed man I left I came back I I tighten up security matchers I'm like we're gonna start doing this we're going to start it with the law of gene laughs because I realized that I gotta get back to my wife my family is dependent on me to get back home and I can't just be casual about things at work because some because of devil out there he he means business because while I saw just nothing but paper and transaction and have forgotten the value of what I was dealing with [Music] to the person on the outside that is extremely valuable and they are willing to take anybody out that's in the way the devil's willing to take you out the moment you let your guard down that's why I said Lord fortify me by your Holy Spirit protect me by your word be a shield and buckle unto me and my family press towards the mark of the prize of the High Calling I rounded up by saying there's a story in the scripture in Exodus I love this scripture just to kind of set the stage for us it's in Exodus chapter um 14 will read there but just to set the stage the children of Israel um were um about to where had left had just left Egypt and pharaoh kinda reflecting about how things didn't go according to how he had desired it and he started to feel the pressure of the people pharaoh what do you expect us to do now you're the laughing stock of this entire community you've let the people go how are we supposed to build this and build that and build this Pharaoh was beginning to feel the pressures he got up in the morning and he looked at the Egyptian times feral a big loss by letting the people of Israel go front page he was so disappointed his pride started to get in the way how could you let them people go there were people marching around his palaces he started feeling the political pressures the infighting how and meanwhile the children of Israel they're rejoicing praising God that they have left bondage they're no longer under the hands of the Egyptian and they're looking forward in the praising God and say hallelujah they're having a jubilee life is good they've never been so happy Redemption what the prophet Moses said is true and meanwhile Pharaoh's fighting with people like didn't you just see what happened in the last play we've lost children their God is far greater than our God Raw and people like we don't care you're laughing stuck so Pharaoh's heart hardens now I want you to pay attention to this and I want you to follow very carefully with me this is at that time one of the most powerful Nation in the world unrivaled By Any Other Nation no one can meet the military might of the Egyptians they were powerful fighting machine an army to be reckoned with powerful and Pharaoh got a hundreds not thousands chariots one of the most powerful military machines at that time powerful to go after who a people that didn't have a military a people that hardly had any weapons of people that were on foot to a Promised Land and Pharaoh felt he needed to equip himself so much to go after people that was not equipped as well as he was right what's our lesson about this the devil's afraid of you Saints the devil will gather all of his military might because he knows not of you but the God who stands for you in order to confront you he has to bring his best to fight your best because the devil knows that without God you're not anything but with God you're everything so he may not be afraid of you but he's afraid of what represents you my little daughter you know I could draw a lot of analogies being a father now I got a 190 pound Rottweiler at home pretty big thing my little daughter just as small as she want to be goes up to my Rottweiler and looks at her looks at my dog and says sit down my dog looked at me just as confused as like wish this little human trying to tell me she's like sit down dog looks at her the dog looks at me and as she's getting ready to say one more time sit down I just say sit and the dog sat she was so rejoicing she was happy because she said sit down listen let me tell you Saints speak the words and let God speak on your behalf and God will let you take the credit for it my child speak you listen [Music] she may not have the might she may not have the strength she may not have to physique but I stand behind her she speak you're obligated to listen [Applause] so exercise your voice and speak to the devil devil you don't belong in my house devil get out of my house get your hands off of my children get your hands off of my marriage get your hands off my job [Applause] and let God speak on your behalf so they started to pursue the Egyptians started to pursue after the children of Israel and they were you know that's the thing man the devil just have ways of kind of breaking or interrupting your glory you're either praising God and literas like Hallelujah they saw a host of people all of a sudden that Joy started to decipitate a little bit sorry to drop down a little bit you know that's just like the devil when you leave him alone he's not happy he comes after you he comes after you the world is constantly Chasing After You because they want you back it's not happy that you left it and so as they're watching the Egyptian come from behind they're like we ain't worried about it we're just gonna keep going straight and as they got far farther to the destination that destination they come across a massive Red Sea that could kill anybody's Joy the enemy at your tail and then you have no further way to go what do you do they start to cry that's when we pick up the Bible says is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt saying verse Chapter 14 verse 12. and he just said let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians for it had been better for us to serve the Egyptian then that we should die in the wilderness that's how the devil is you've seen the Miracles I mean they had just witnessed the Miracles that God had did for them while they were in Egypt and all of a sudden because of this circumstance the enemies at their back the Red Seas right there so they're stuck in the middle you know what the devil's attempt is sometimes is to stop you from pressing forward to stop you from moving to have you believe that there's no way out because by their definition and by their standards and by the way they were looking at situations they didn't see a way out that's many of us if not all of us we have come across certain situations in our lives like Lord how am I going to get out of this mess situations at the job I don't know how I'm gonna get out of it family situations I I don't know what I'm gonna do now oftentimes we say it doesn't seem like there's a way out that's what the devil wants you to think so Moses he goes to God and he begins to cry out onto God Moses done to the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord that was Moses message to the people stand still and see how God comes through for you and the Lord said unto Moses why cry unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they may go together forward that they may go forward God you see that Red Sea go forward God you see that the bills are due move forward God I just got laid off my job go forward I just had a falling out where my relative moved forward the note is through the car notice dude the mortgages to move forward God sees the same challenges that you see but what you don't see is that God has provided a way out he would not tell you to go someplace unless he hasn't gone there himself go forward lift up thyroid stretch out thy hand over the sea and divide it in the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea and I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians and they will follow them and I will get the honor upon pharaoh God says go forward but as they're pressing forward I'm gonna magnify I'm gonna intensify the situation for them I'm gonna put the Pharaoh I'm gonna put pharah's Army right there on the heels God intensifies the situation come on God has confidence in you God believes in you more than you probably believe in your own self he has confidence in you that's the reason why when the Bible says in in in job where God looks at saying it's like you know Satan was going to and for he's like have you concerned my servant joke I didn't know you got a hedge of protection running by them you know but then he says if you remove the hedge of protection I'll get him to curse you to your face God believes in his servant God has confidence in you the devil the God says to the devil I will remove the heads of protection you could make him sick you could touch your surrounding but the only thing that I tell you don't touch that life he will never denounce me come on somebody it's easy while we're sitting amongst Believers to say praise be to God but when you're out there under the pressures of the world and we're living in that time now where would you believe is becoming magnified there are things that I just don't agree with and I know within my job I could only go but a certain level right because there's certain things I just don't agree with faith is going to be challenged and let me tell you things it's gonna get worse praise the Lord go forward and the Egyptians were as high Pursuit and as they were closing in the Bible says verse 19 the angel of God which went before the camp of Israel removed and went behind them and the pillar of cloud went before their face that went before their face and when it stood behind them and it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel and there was a cloud and darkness to them but it gave light by night to these so that one came not the other all the night so God was leading the charge and when he saw that the people started to waver he says look I know what promises lays ahead you move forward but I will go and stand behind you what does that mean God has your back God has your back you don't need to look at your past you move forward you don't need to give the devil credit to your past you move forward and God stood between the children of Israel and the Egyptians you could sleep at night knowing that God stand between you and your enemy and he told the truth the truth is real don't look behind you no matter how treacherous the journey might be how challenging the journey might be press forward it's a long story but we're just kind of shortening it they get to the Red Sea Moses extends his arms because they don't know what's going to happen but they got to move by faith you don't know how you're going to get through certain situations you got to move by faith you don't even know what tomorrow looks like you gotta approach tomorrow like Faith tell you why because tomorrow's going to come anyhow there's no stopping tomorrow there will be a tomorrow unless we're in glory that's even better but as long as there is tomorrow I'm approaching it with faith I'm not certain in a lot of things but the Bible says be certain of God I'm certain in my Creator I'm certain of my deliverer I don't know what Tuesday looks like but I look forward to Tuesday pressing towards the mark and as it got to the Red Sea Moses spread out his arms in a wall of water comes between them separates and I don't know either just dry ground appears two million people marches through this Red Sea they're walking through what wasn't there their problem is no longer a problem what they were worried about is no longer a worry anytime the devil could get you to stop worshiping God we come to church so bogged down with our problems rather than give God the glory we're thinking about what we're going to do when we get home how are we going to take care of this what this week looks like what kind of conversation I'm going to have with my boss the doctor's visit we're so bogged down that when the when the preacher starts to say something we like praise the Lord rather than giving God the glory right now thank God for what he's already done he may not have done it yet but just thinking Lord thank you for taking care of this problem Lord I don't know how I'm gonna get through this but thank you for making me get through it having confidence start rejoicing now even as you're waiting for the promise to materialize he'll never leave you know forsake you press forward and Moses stood in position until every elect every elect every elect every elect passes through Jesus is holding position he died on the cross that blood is still bleeding for you and I before my children was born that blood was bleeding for them he's waiting for every elect to make it through all that the father has given me will come to me boy you might be looking at your brother and your sisters to get your life together and God's looking directly at you and saying get your life together because he says he's not Gonna Leave You so if I'm enduring it could be because I'm waiting for someone to get their lives together if you're enduring it could be that you're waiting for somebody to get their life together oh God's waiting for you to get your life together God's waiting for me to get my life together foreign Moses stood there and God was there watching every elect every promise Young old you name it went through so I'm wrapping up your way is only for you the devil cannot go the same path that you win your way is only yours when you're sealed in the only way that the devil can get to you is if you decide to step outside of that seal and then you're in trouble or if the devil decides to go through the same process that you went repent be baptized filled with the Holy Ghost at that time the prophet said you could call him brother but your path is your path the Egyptians were so bold they're like if it's good for the children of Israel then it's good for us to sound of the fellas we're going right to them with all their technology all their advances all their accomplishments they started to pursue after the children of Israel by that time they were already on the other side and God told Moses Moses close up your hands can you just imagine a wall of water Moses closed his hands a wall of water comes that force of that water crushing the Egyptians in breaking down all of their chariots drowning all of those spirits destroying all of the devils when you cross through that blood and you look behind you you can see the Carnage that God has taken care of for you every devil that was in your Hot Pursuit God's taking care of that destroyed every demon drowned every spirit that was so mighty but before God there were nothing the children of Israel now we're looking towards the promise God had taken care of the past now I want you to follow this because I heard a brother say this and I thought it was meaningful to me if the children of Israel wanted to go back they could not [Music] this was only a one-way path then when you want to go back give up I want to quit sometimes I want to stop sometimes I just want to just throw in the towel I can't God has taken away that way back I can only go forward even if you wanted to go back you cannot God has called you to go forward and like Paul I can say I press towards the mark of the prize of the High Calling a Christ Jesus so I'll Stand to our feet hello God has paved the way for you and it's only yours there's no way back you know what saint I don't know about y'all but I'm tired of this world I'm longing for a city with maker and Builder Builders God there's a land beyond the river that is called the sweet you know one of the most troubling sounds I hear at night when I look I put my kids to sleep soundly asleep my wife's comfortable I kind of walk around the house and in that same distance I hear the sound of a siren that troubles well I'm so appreciative that God has kept my household at peace someone's home is being disturbed now it's on the home church back up the other son that said you know I long for the day where certain sounds just doesn't exist that I no longer hear the sound of a sign I no longer have to live by putting security alarms in my home along for that day along for the day where certain occupations don't exist anymore I don't need a surgeon I don't need a doctor I long for a Day Saints but

a land that is sweeter than fair there's a land beyond the river that is called the sweet forever for some of you it might be imaginary for me it's everything that I'm fighting for every wound that I
