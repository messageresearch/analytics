[3:40] you be glorified amen and amen praise
[3:44] the Lord let's open our Bibles to Luke 2
[3:47] and we'll read verses 8 to verse
[3:51] 20 amen I was listening to the message
[3:54] why it had to be Shepherds and the
[3:57] scripture reading just struck me amen
[4:00] we'll start at verse 8 and says and
[4:01] there were in the same country shepherds
[4:04] abiding in the field keeping watch over
[4:07] their flock by night and lo the angel of
[4:10] the Lord Came Upon upon them and the
[4:13] glory of the Lord Shone round about them
[4:15] and they were sore afraid and the angel
[4:18] said unto them fear not for behold I
[4:22] bring you good tidings of great joy and
[4:26] shall be to all people for unto you is
[4:29] born this day in the city of David a
[4:32] savior which is Christ the lord and this
[4:35] shall be assigned unto you you shall
[4:36] find a babe wrapped in swaden clothes
[4:39] lying in a manger and suddenly there was
[4:42] a there was with the angel a multitude
[4:46] of heavenly hosts praising God and
[4:48] saying glory to God in the highest and
[4:52] on Earth peace Good Will toward men and
[4:55] it came to pass that as the Angels were
[4:58] going away from from them into heaven
[5:00] the Shepherds said one to another let us
[5:03] know let us now go even unto Bethlehem
[5:07] and
[5:08] see and that word sort of struck me said
[5:12] and see this thing which has come to
[5:14] pass which the Lord hath made known unto
[5:18] us and they came with haste and found
[5:21] Mary and Joseph and the Babe lying in a
[5:24] manger and when they had seen it they
[5:27] made known abroad the same which was
[5:30] told them concerning the child and all
[5:33] they that heard pardon me and all they
[5:36] that heard it wondered at those things
[5:39] which were told them by the Shepherds
[5:41] but Mary kept all these things and
[5:43] pondered them in her heart and the
[5:45] Shepherds returned glorifying and
[5:48] praising God for all the things that
[5:50] they had heard and seen and it was told
[5:54] as it was told unto them amen so the
[5:56] Lord God brought it to pass amen I
[5:59] thought it was a marvelous thing just
[6:00] reading over this little portion of
[6:04] scripture how the Lord had first told
[6:08] them then they saw the manifestation of
[6:10] it and they rejoiced and when it told
[6:12] others and it meant nothing to
[6:15] others so they went back praising the
[6:17] Lord so we want to praise our God this
[6:20] morning thank him for the gift of the
[6:23] Lord Jesus that he sent into the Earth

[1:05:38] your heart amen and
[1:05:42] uh um I just want to
[1:05:46] begin
[1:05:48] uh recently we just
[1:05:52] uh had the home going of our dear
[1:05:55] precious brother
[1:05:56] Wesco and uh you know during that
[1:06:01] time
[1:06:03] uh a gallant Soldier gone
[1:06:06] home and uh and I tell you what we sent
[1:06:10] them home right didn't
[1:06:12] we one of the most beautiful hom goings
[1:06:16] I've ever had the pleasure of
[1:06:20] attending and uh
[1:06:25] when
[1:06:27] we
[1:06:29] started there with brother Wesco we
[1:06:32] started in a
[1:06:35] school much like
[1:06:38] this and
[1:06:42] uh I
[1:06:45] appreciate him for being a
[1:06:48] true Christian and there was had to be
[1:06:53] something in brother Wesco
[1:06:57] that said there's has to be
[1:07:00] more and see he came from New York the
[1:07:04] original name of the church was
[1:07:06] Tabernacle of
[1:07:09] Prayer for all people
[1:07:12] absolutely and some years later well
[1:07:16] we'll get to that later
[1:07:19] but he had a
[1:07:22] sincerity there was a
[1:07:25] the
[1:07:27] unnoticeable sincerity about the word of
[1:07:30] God more of a Holiness type
[1:07:33] church amen and brother Wesco was very
[1:07:38] charismatic amen
[1:07:40] uh people being slayed in the spirit
[1:07:44] here and
[1:07:45] there oh we had a wonderful time in the
[1:07:49] Lord church was probably some like I say
[1:07:53] little B maybe 200 or so people
[1:07:56] it was held in the cafeteria and we
[1:07:58] pretty much filled up the
[1:08:01] cafeteria and with brother
[1:08:04] Westco in his heart couldn't have been
[1:08:08] settled that there's
[1:08:10] more and one Sunday he wasn't there
[1:08:14] that's all I can remember I was a little
[1:08:16] child I didn't know what was going on
[1:08:17] where he was I just all I knew the
[1:08:19] pastor wasn't
[1:08:20] here and uh when he came back the next
[1:08:23] service we saw all of these
[1:08:27] boards white man on the
[1:08:30] board Fire coming from his head
[1:08:34] and what is
[1:08:38] this so
[1:08:40] we sat there and during that service and
[1:08:44] you know as The Story Goes On the very
[1:08:46] next service there was only a handful of
[1:08:52] us the church had pretty much emptied
[1:08:55] out
[1:08:56] out now I got to give special thanks at
[1:09:00] this time
[1:09:01] to my
[1:09:04] mother your pastor brother Jack and
[1:09:07] I sister Tina was there sister Erica was
[1:09:11] there and a few others if I miss anyone
[1:09:14] forgive
[1:09:16] me because you know we we were we were
[1:09:20] still children
[1:09:22] following our parents
[1:09:26] but our parents came
[1:09:29] back they didn't
[1:09:33] leave thank you Lord amen amen well
[1:09:37] we're going to stay and
[1:09:39] see what this is all about never heard
[1:09:43] these things
[1:09:44] before what is this about a prophet what
[1:09:48] is this about a pillowy what is this
[1:09:52] message
[1:09:56] so there
[1:09:57] was just a
[1:09:59] handful probably less than
[1:10:02] 20 out of 200 that let you know so that
[1:10:06] you know just come back and just a
[1:10:08] handful said Lord have mercy but we we
[1:10:11] were
[1:10:12] there and we begin to just listen and we
[1:10:16] brother Wesco
[1:10:18] preached all he knew because remember he
[1:10:22] was new in it as well so he he he took
[1:10:26] what he knew from the word and and and
[1:10:29] with what he was learning and he
[1:10:32] delivered it as best he knew
[1:10:36] how
[1:10:38] amen so we stayed there and we listened
[1:10:40] attentively and then we began
[1:10:43] to uh go on the little trips and
[1:10:46] fellowship with other message
[1:10:50] Believers and lo and behold before you
[1:10:52] knew
[1:10:54] it think things begin to
[1:10:57] change we begin to to to to to uh uh uh
[1:11:02] Elevate our
[1:11:06] understanding now we had been uh from a
[1:11:09] Pentecostal background one grandmother
[1:11:12] was a
[1:11:14] Pentecostal Church of God in Christ and
[1:11:18] the other grandmother was a
[1:11:21] Baptist so we had this uh Foundation of
[1:11:26] what we figured church was supposed to
[1:11:29] be like
[1:11:31] right and when we we we we sort of begin
[1:11:35] to get uh affiliated with this thing
[1:11:39] called the
[1:11:40] message amen we we we we we we knew that
[1:11:45] there was something
[1:11:47] different see because we had seen a lot
[1:11:51] of
[1:11:54] foolishness and and things that we even
[1:11:58] as a child we was like this this ain't
[1:12:04] right folks fighting in the church and
[1:12:08] bickering and then you know uh uh get up
[1:12:12] and I like nothing
[1:12:16] happen and then on the other hand we uh
[1:12:19] on the Pentecostal side oh we we there
[1:12:23] was there was really there was wor
[1:12:25] there but the the the the the the the
[1:12:28] whole consensus was get down on the
[1:12:32] floor and say Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus
[1:12:35] Jesus Jesus Jesus Jes until you start
[1:12:37] frosting that the
[1:12:39] mouth when you begin to fro at the mouth
[1:12:42] you got
[1:12:47] it so that didn't set well with us cuz
[1:12:51] we had to clean up after everybody
[1:12:53] frosting at the mouth
[1:12:57] my grandma would have us pick that up
[1:12:59] boy that's oh Grandma yes
[1:13:05] ma'am but we
[1:13:11] had what a testimony see see me me me
[1:13:16] and and I'mma get to it I don't want to
[1:13:17] get ahead of
[1:13:19] myself but my even as a young man my
[1:13:23] life had took a series
[1:13:26] of sometime painful
[1:13:29] turns a
[1:13:31] direction and and and and and to put me
[1:13:35] in the right place at the right
[1:13:40] time even though I didn't know
[1:13:44] it I was just
[1:13:48] following my
[1:13:50] mother we we we we we went to Sunday
[1:13:53] school regular
[1:13:56] we come from a religious
[1:13:59] family but things begin to change once
[1:14:03] we were introduced to the message we
[1:14:05] begin to slowly tear away from what we
[1:14:09] call
[1:14:11] religion and
[1:14:13] begin to get an
[1:14:18] understanding even as
[1:14:21] children of what was going on that
[1:14:26] things was
[1:14:31] happening
[1:14:35] recently I went to the had to go to the
[1:14:38] mall I got this new
[1:14:41] iPad iPhone and I didn't know nothing
[1:14:45] about how to use these things I'm an
[1:14:48] Android
[1:14:52] man I see we have some Android people in
[1:14:55] here
[1:14:57] today so I was blessed to receive this
[1:15:01] iPhone and I didn't know nothing about
[1:15:03] it couldn't even I couldn't do
[1:15:06] nothing
[1:15:08] so I decide I said well I'm gonna go to
[1:15:11] the Apple store and see if I can get
[1:15:14] some help understanding this
[1:15:19] iPhone
[1:15:20] so in doing so I looked up where the
[1:15:25] nearest one and the only one was in the
[1:15:26] Wellington
[1:15:29] mall
[1:15:31] now I know my way around Home
[1:15:35] Depot
[1:15:37] Lowe's Bass Pro
[1:15:40] Shop Harbor
[1:15:42] Freight amen I I I know my way
[1:15:46] Publix I know what they say I know I
[1:15:48] know my way
[1:15:50] around but the Wellington mall is a
[1:15:53] little big for me
[1:15:56] so now I pull in the parking lot and it
[1:15:59] doesn't help that you know they have
[1:16:02] different the heels you can park on the
[1:16:06] second
[1:16:07] level and be and and it's it's just so I
[1:16:11] just parked I didn't know where the
[1:16:13] store was in the mall I just parked and
[1:16:18] went in now I'm going to I was a little
[1:16:22] distracted on the way in because as I'm
[1:16:24] going in
[1:16:26] I have to use the
[1:16:29] restroom so I said well I got to find a
[1:16:32] restroom so in looking for the first
[1:16:34] thing I have to do is for I get to a I
[1:16:36] got to get to a restroom so I'm walking
[1:16:39] around the mall looking for the restroom
[1:16:42] instead of looking for the Apple Store
[1:16:45] oh I finally find the
[1:16:47] restroom come out now I got to find the
[1:16:52] Apple
[1:16:53] Store so I'm walking looking around
[1:16:55] aimlessly
[1:16:56] looking look like stores all over the
[1:16:59] place upstairs I didn't know if it was
[1:17:01] upstairs downstairs I'm just walking all
[1:17:04] around this mall finally find the Apple
[1:17:06] Store get the information that I need
[1:17:08] now I'm trying to
[1:17:14] leave y'all know I am thoroughly
[1:17:18] lost I don't know what exit I came
[1:17:21] in I don't know how to get back there
[1:17:25] I'm just walking after you walk around
[1:17:27] the store and you pass the Apple store
[1:17:29] again for the third time I don't went
[1:17:32] upstairs downstairs I am
[1:17:39] lost and don't know how to get out of
[1:17:43] here so I call my
[1:17:47] wife and I said honey I'm in the
[1:17:50] mall and I'm
[1:17:53] lost she say
[1:17:56] what how you lost in the
[1:18:00] mall she says where are
[1:18:03] you and I said I don't know I'm in the
[1:18:09] mall and I start naming stores that I
[1:18:15] see and she couldn't help me because she
[1:18:19] didn't know where I was in the mall she
[1:18:22] said well where did you come in at I
[1:18:24] don't know why didn't you
[1:18:27] look well I wasn't paying attention
[1:18:30] because all I needed to do is find a
[1:18:33] bathroom so I wasn't really paying
[1:18:36] attention to the stores at the exit
[1:18:38] where I came
[1:18:40] in so generally you they find a a little
[1:18:48] box thing and it has
[1:18:51] directions and and it has a map of of
[1:18:54] the
[1:18:58] mall and in there you got to look for
[1:19:02] the place and it
[1:19:05] says there you
[1:19:09] go you are
[1:19:13] here so that brought me to this
[1:19:17] conclusion that and even in
[1:19:21] life on you have to know where you're
[1:19:29] at in order to be able to get out of
[1:19:41] here now we're going to read here a
[1:19:44] little bit from uh the church ages here
[1:19:47] the resume of the
[1:19:49] ages amen and uh I forget the page name
[1:19:53] of sister I
[1:20:00] uh guess you can look
[1:20:03] up this age
[1:20:05] started just after the turn of the 20th
[1:20:08] century something along those lines you
[1:20:10] should get you there okay now this age
[1:20:15] I'll read that again started just after
[1:20:17] the turn of the 20th century now that is
[1:20:23] around
[1:20:25] 1906 and we know that this is when uh
[1:20:29] the Revival or the movement of pinic
[1:20:32] cost hey man took off isusa
[1:20:37] Street
[1:20:38] uh as it was to be it says here I'm
[1:20:43] reading as it was to be the age in which
[1:20:47] the true church would return to being
[1:20:50] the bride she was at Pentecost now this
[1:20:55] is where things get a little bit
[1:20:57] confusing I would love to keep this song
[1:20:59] but I don't think the
[1:21:01] Al and
[1:21:09] uh uh okay this is where things get a
[1:21:12] little confusing
[1:21:15] because in in in in at the turn of the
[1:21:18] 20th century 1906 we had a Pentecostal
[1:21:21] movement to isusu
[1:21:23] Street and we also had at the beginning
[1:21:26] of the first century amen what is called
[1:21:32] Pentecost and sometime people confuse
[1:21:35] the two these are two different
[1:21:38] dispensations of
[1:21:41] time amen and what happened is uhh uh we
[1:21:46] begin to have a movement here uh uh uh
[1:21:50] this brother uh Seymour amen begin to to
[1:21:55] to to pray amen and he wasn't alone
[1:21:58] there was a there was something
[1:22:00] happening so what happened was it was
[1:22:04] time amen for a
[1:22:07] restoration amen so the anointing began
[1:22:10] to move on certain
[1:22:12] people amen but I'll read on and what
[1:22:16] happened we know that there must be a
[1:22:19] necessity of Return of dynamic power
[1:22:23] this is what the prophet said okay we
[1:22:25] knew that there must be a necessity of a
[1:22:29] return to Dynamic power the Believers
[1:22:34] sensed this in their spirits and began
[1:22:38] crying to God for a new
[1:22:42] outpouring such as was in the first
[1:22:46] century okay they knew that there was
[1:22:49] more just like brother Wesco just they
[1:22:51] knew that that that there had to be more
[1:22:54] amen so in that time there in the turn
[1:22:56] of the 20th century 1909 or 7 around
[1:23:00] that time they began to pray amen for a
[1:23:04] restoration amen they knew that there
[1:23:07] was something supposed to be
[1:23:11] happening we seen okay he says here uh
[1:23:15] the spirit began they uh and begin
[1:23:18] crying to God for a new outpouring such
[1:23:21] as it was in the first century what
[1:23:23] seemed to be the answer came as many
[1:23:28] began to speak in tongues and manifest
[1:23:32] gifts of the Spirit now listen to the
[1:23:36] wording here he said what seemed to
[1:23:39] be
[1:23:41] amen gifts of the Spirit it was then
[1:23:46] believed that this was indeed the long
[1:23:50] awaited
[1:23:52] restoration it was
[1:23:56] not for the latter rain can come only
[1:24:01] after the former rain which is the
[1:24:04] spring rain or the teaching
[1:24:07] rain the latter rain then is the Harvest
[1:24:12] rain and in another place he said that
[1:24:15] is rapturing
[1:24:19] Faith so there was the
[1:24:21] confusion that this is that
[1:24:25] that was uh uh and and and and and this
[1:24:28] movement and the next thing to happen is
[1:24:30] the
[1:24:33] rapture sincere
[1:24:37] people they just didn't know where they
[1:24:39] were in the
[1:24:47] mall there was still more you had to
[1:24:51] there was a see but they felt they knew
[1:24:53] that there was a turn there was a change
[1:24:56] happening sir but you weren't at the
[1:24:59] exit
[1:25:00] yet you were still lost in the mall of
[1:25:05] life
[1:25:10] amen the prophet Amen Let me see I don't
[1:25:15] want to lose my place teaching rain the
[1:25:17] latter rain and the Harvest rain how be
[1:25:20] sent to teach the
[1:25:22] people and turn the hearts of the
[1:25:26] children back to the Pentecostal fathers
[1:25:29] Malachi
[1:25:31] 4 and six
[1:25:35] amen Pentecostal fathers had not come
[1:25:39] yet thus what was taught to be the
[1:25:43] restoration and the final quickening
[1:25:46] unto the Rapture had not come
[1:25:51] yet amen th
[1:25:55] what was thought to be the restoration
[1:25:57] I'm sorry come come come in in it was a
[1:26:02] mixture now catch this in it was a
[1:26:05] mixture of righteous partaking of
[1:26:08] spiritual blessings and manifesting in
[1:26:11] the Holy Ghost as we have kept pointing
[1:26:15] out to you in it also was devil power as
[1:26:21] men were under the control of of devils
[1:26:26] yet no one seemed to realize it then to
[1:26:30] prove that it was not the real these
[1:26:33] people even before the second generation
[1:26:38] of that
[1:26:40] movement began to
[1:26:42] organize and wrote their unscriptural
[1:26:46] Doctrine and built their own fences as
[1:26:50] every other group ahead of them did
[1:26:55] Lord so they begin to to uh uh take the
[1:26:59] movement and begin to say things such as
[1:27:03] that this speaking in tongues was the
[1:27:09] evidence of the Holy Ghost and they
[1:27:12] begin to build a
[1:27:15] Doctrine around
[1:27:17] that and they begin to say this is that
[1:27:20] this is it so they Clos they off to what
[1:27:25] was coming now not long after this he
[1:27:28] talk about that second generation it was
[1:27:31] around that second generation where the
[1:27:33] Prophet was
[1:27:36] born are you with me this
[1:27:40] morning but they had already muddied the
[1:27:43] water yes sir
[1:27:47] see then they begin to build these
[1:27:49] fences you have uh Church of God Four
[1:27:53] Square
[1:27:54] uh Assemblies of God one had this belief
[1:27:57] and another one had this belief and
[1:27:59] another one and they built these fences
[1:28:01] and the fellowship see when they was all
[1:28:04] there in the soua street everybody came
[1:28:07] everybody was praying everybody was
[1:28:08] believing and the spirit of God moved
[1:28:11] mightily among
[1:28:14] them but they
[1:28:17] organized and the spirit left them now
[1:28:21] what's
[1:28:22] happening is because because like I said
[1:28:25] I had a
[1:28:26] grandmother one was Pentecost one was
[1:28:30] Baptist so they and
[1:28:34] sincere sincere now wasn't playing every
[1:28:38] time the church doors open she there
[1:28:40] encouraging you to go to church
[1:28:42] believing in the Lord uh uh get saved
[1:28:47] children but
[1:28:49] under a movement that of a day gone by
[1:28:54] but I still to this day believe it was
[1:28:56] her
[1:29:00] prayers amen that kept us amen
[1:29:04] until that faithful day brother Wesco
[1:29:08] came with the
[1:29:12] Billboards in the right
[1:29:14] place at the right
[1:29:17] time season just right tender T mine is
[1:29:22] still tender yes not bogged down with
[1:29:26] all kind of
[1:29:28] foolishness of
[1:29:31] religion and we had
[1:29:34] parents who knew that there had to be
[1:29:36] something more we had a pastor that knew
[1:29:40] that there had to be something
[1:29:48] more so it led us to that
[1:29:51] point amen so so we see here in the mall
[1:29:57] of
[1:29:58] life amen there I found myself walking
[1:30:03] around in this mall and there
[1:30:07] distractions well there's a store here
[1:30:11] maybe I'll just go into this store I'm
[1:30:14] trying to find my way out of
[1:30:16] here though I end up in the in in in in
[1:30:20] this
[1:30:21] store and I'm looking at stuff
[1:30:25] I don't know why cuz I ain't F to buy
[1:30:26] nothing I'm in the
[1:30:28] mall and I'm walking and here's another
[1:30:31] store I'm looking at this store see all
[1:30:34] of these
[1:30:36] distractions as I'm trying to find the
[1:30:40] ex now the Lord has flashing red lights
[1:30:44] sign of his coming that is leading me to
[1:30:47] the right exit but what happens and what
[1:30:50] the devil does he'll put other flashing
[1:30:53] lights
[1:30:55] to confuse you on the light that God has
[1:30:58] already set so now with so many
[1:31:02] lights so that he set a pair of Lights a
[1:31:05] set of Lights to lead me to where I'm
[1:31:08] supposed to be going but now I'm
[1:31:10] confused because there's lights
[1:31:13] everywhere that's just how the devil
[1:31:15] does things he confuse you by you he's
[1:31:19] gled you to a word but now there's so
[1:31:21] many distraction cuz there's a church on
[1:31:23] every corner saying this is right and
[1:31:25] that church saying this is right and the
[1:31:27] other Church saying this is
[1:31:31] right just to confuse the
[1:31:35] issue because see what the devil is
[1:31:38] trying to
[1:31:40] do amen is he is trying to pull
[1:31:46] worship from the
[1:31:48] Lord the Bible says that he he he wants
[1:31:51] to be worshiped as God
[1:31:56] amen so he uh try to confuse the issue
[1:32:00] to get you to worship on a false
[1:32:07] Doctrine when started out
[1:32:10] true but the minute they
[1:32:13] organized amen the devil got in amen and
[1:32:16] begin to sway the people in the wrong
[1:32:19] direction and they still shouting right
[1:32:22] on Dancing right on Triple
[1:32:27] clapping but you going the wrong
[1:32:31] direction that route is going to lead
[1:32:33] you to the pits of hell yes sir
[1:32:41] amen but you let me get to that I'll get
[1:32:44] to that part later so we're walking in
[1:32:47] this mall and there's distractions
[1:32:50] everywhere but we're trying to find the
[1:32:55] exit see
[1:32:58] when I come into the parking
[1:33:03] lot
[1:33:05] there I was
[1:33:07] in the mind of
[1:33:10] God see and this is what brother Smiley
[1:33:12] was talking about a few weeks ago we we
[1:33:15] in the mind of
[1:33:17] God
[1:33:19] perfect he had the right
[1:33:22] Doctrine we d that's right in the mind
[1:33:26] of God but once we got in the
[1:33:29] mall we begin to get
[1:33:33] distracted see because the mall is full
[1:33:35] of all kind of
[1:33:37] people there's
[1:33:39] Believers there's make
[1:33:42] Believers and there's
[1:33:45] unbelievers people are some are dress
[1:33:49] for the world and some
[1:33:51] are even some of them make Believers are
[1:33:54] dressed for the
[1:33:55] world Amen so now this confusion sets
[1:34:03] in we had to be first the prophet said
[1:34:07] first I got to clean them
[1:34:09] up how can I teach
[1:34:12] you
[1:34:14] algebra when you don't know your
[1:34:18] ABCs and they say well it's not about
[1:34:22] what's on the outside
[1:34:25] it's about what's on the
[1:34:27] inside now I've watched a few dishes in
[1:34:30] my life and when I have a dirty
[1:34:33] cup and I have to clean it on the
[1:34:37] inside I put it down in the
[1:34:41] solution so that the water and the the
[1:34:44] chemical get on the inside and as I'm
[1:34:47] scrubbing the inside and once the inside
[1:34:51] is clean and I bring it out the water
[1:34:54] the outside is automatically
[1:34:59] clean because it was submerged in the
[1:35:02] solution so to say well he's not looking
[1:35:05] at on the outside he's looking at just
[1:35:08] on the inside if your inside is clean
[1:35:11] your outside will be automatically
[1:35:17] clean if your outside is still false and
[1:35:21] dirty and take it all up with the world
[1:35:24] we need to go and get another we need to
[1:35:26] get rid of that soft sponge and get
[1:35:28] something a little
[1:35:35] harder got some scrubbing that need to
[1:35:38] be
[1:35:39] done you don't let that stuff set up so
[1:35:43] long it's all Caked Up and it done got
[1:35:48] stuck in places now we need to get that
[1:35:51] fork and dig in the
[1:35:54] corners and scrap and
[1:35:58] scrap cuz we can't pull the good wine in
[1:36:02] that dirty
[1:36:05] cup sir cannot do it it won't
[1:36:10] mix
[1:36:12] amen so you you you you don't get angry
[1:36:15] with the preacher for stying to
[1:36:19] [Music]
[1:36:22] scrub and has to be clean on the
[1:36:26] inside and the
[1:36:30] outside
[1:36:33] so we in this
[1:36:36] mall
[1:36:37] amen and we're going on and we're trying
[1:36:40] to
[1:36:41] find amen our way back to where we came
[1:36:46] from where were you when the sons of God
[1:36:50] shouted for
[1:36:52] Glory you were a thought in the mind of
[1:36:57] God
[1:36:58] Perfect
[1:37:00] Clean
[1:37:02] holy and we're trying to get
[1:37:05] back to the parking lot but we're
[1:37:10] lost we're lost in the
[1:37:12] mall and there's you you I'm walking on

[1:37:40] partake amen and eat of the
[1:37:42] food amen that the mall has to
[1:37:46] offer amen and what happened is we we we
[1:37:51] take in more ideas is and idolatry and
[1:37:55] uh uh uh now we we good we think we know

[1:38:45] blessing in the
[1:38:47] mall but the goal is not to stay in the
[1:38:51] mall the goal is to get get out of the
[1:38:56] mall in the
[1:39:00] Rapture I don't want to stay here in the
[1:39:04] mall cuz the mall going to
[1:39:10] [Applause]
[1:39:17] close you don't want to be stuck here in
[1:39:21] the mall

[1:39:26] morning and it's getting
[1:39:29] late it's getting late in the
[1:39:33] hour and I'm still
[1:39:36] lost I don't know where I came in that
[1:39:40] so I'm still
[1:39:42] walking walking around in the
[1:39:46] mall trying to find a way
[1:39:50] out let's go to the word
[1:39:56] amen now remember I said the devil is
[1:39:58] trying to get you to
[1:40:01] worship let's look at Revelations the
[1:40:04] 13th
[1:40:05] chapter 3 and
[1:40:08] 8 amen starting at the
[1:40:12] third verse it
[1:40:15] says and I saw one of his heads as it
[1:40:19] was wounded to
[1:40:21] death and his dead wound was
[1:40:28] healed and all the world wandered after
[1:40:32] the
[1:40:33] Beast you
[1:40:35] see and they
[1:40:38] worshiped the
[1:40:40] dragon which gave power unto the Beast
[1:40:44] and they worshiped the Beast saying who
[1:40:47] is like unto the Beast who was able to
[1:40:50] make war with him
[1:40:53] see this is the devil's plan this is his
[1:40:56] goal all
[1:40:57] along amen the dragon we know is Satan
[1:41:03] that old serpent amen and his his goal
[1:41:08] is to to get us to so confused and so
[1:41:12] despondent amen that we're trying to
[1:41:16] find our way out of the mall but here he
[1:41:20] comes I know the way
[1:41:23] come come follow me now you can't blame
[1:41:28] the people they trying to get out of the
[1:41:30] mall see so they they they have
[1:41:33] themselves in a real precarious
[1:41:35] situation because they they they they
[1:41:41] there haven't been a former rain and
[1:41:43] latter rain we'll get to that we'll get
[1:41:45] to that we'll get to that we'll get to
[1:41:47] that now five says and there was given
[1:41:49] unto him a mouth to speak great things
[1:41:52] blasphemy
[1:41:54] power was given to him to continue 40
[1:41:57] and two
[1:42:00] months and open his mouth in blasphemy
[1:42:04] against
[1:42:06] God to blaspheme his name in his
[1:42:10] Tabernacle and they that dwelt in
[1:42:14] heaven and it was given unto him to make
[1:42:19] war with the
[1:42:21] Saints and to over come them the power
[1:42:25] was given him over all kindreds tongues
[1:42:29] and Nations and all that dwell upon the
[1:42:34] Earth shall worship
[1:42:37] Him whose names are not written in the
[1:42:42] Lamb's Book of Life in The Book of Life
[1:42:46] of the lamb slain before the foundation
[1:42:49] of the
[1:42:50] world see before the foundation the
[1:42:53] world we were in the parking
[1:42:57] lot and there was already a lamb
[1:43:01] slain who was worthy to take the
[1:43:05] book and open the
[1:43:07] book
[1:43:09] amen and to release the seals
[1:43:13] thereof that lamb that was already slain
[1:43:17] you
[1:43:18] see I don't want to get ahead of myself
[1:43:21] amen
[1:43:29] so I want us to sort of switch gears
[1:43:33] just a little bit we still lost in the
[1:43:37] mall but we know amen that there's that
[1:43:42] the exit is
[1:43:44] somewhere so our heart is
[1:43:48] yearning to find the
[1:43:51] exit amen we're walking aimlessly
[1:43:54] looking for it we know that there has to
[1:43:58] be more to life than just this
[1:44:03] mall I want to get to where God
[1:44:06] is I want to get to the place to
[1:44:09] where when he saw me in his
[1:44:13] thoughts I was
[1:44:16] perfect but we have to be led out of the
[1:44:22] m this mall of
[1:44:25] confusion uh sickness and all kind of
[1:44:28] things go on in the
[1:44:31] mall there's all kind of things to be
[1:44:34] offered to you in the mall now listen
[1:44:37] here the prophet said in the message
[1:44:39] Christ is revealed in his own
[1:44:44] word now you must not three things you
[1:44:48] must
[1:44:49] not misinterpret the word you say well I
[1:44:56] believe it mean this it means just what
[1:44:59] it says it needs no
[1:45:06] interpreter and you must not misplace
[1:45:09] the
[1:45:10] word and you must not dislocate the
[1:45:15] word and if we would either do either of
[1:45:19] these things it throws the whole Bible
[1:45:23] into
[1:45:24] confusion and
[1:45:26] Chaos
[1:45:27] so this is what's happening in the
[1:45:31] M amen this is what happened in the
[1:45:37] beginning of this
[1:45:39] Century amen it was true but what
[1:45:43] happened is they
[1:45:44] misplaced the
[1:45:46] word they dislocated and what happened
[1:45:50] is confusion
[1:45:53] set
[1:45:54] in and they begin to organize and
[1:45:58] denominate bicker over doctrinal issues
[1:46:01] build fences and the spirit
[1:46:04] left
[1:46:07] amen
[1:46:09] so
[1:46:11] notice to misinterpret Jesus in the form
[1:46:15] of God and man in a man you would make
[1:46:20] him you would make him a god God out of
[1:46:25] three to misinterpret Jesus being the
[1:46:28] word you would make him one God out of
[1:46:34] three and you would make him the second
[1:46:37] person in the godhead and to do that you
[1:46:41] mess the whole scripture
[1:46:43] up you you'll never get nowhere so it
[1:46:48] must not be
[1:46:50] misinterpreted and if you say that a
[1:46:53] certain thing you you put an interpret
[1:46:58] interpretation on it and you apply it to
[1:47:01] another time or it's been applied to
[1:47:05] another time all you also make an
[1:47:09] incorrect
[1:47:12] interpreting if anybody misinterprets
[1:47:15] Jesus Christ in the Bible of not being
[1:47:18] God himself make him a second person or
[1:47:22] one God out of three this would upset
[1:47:26] every word in the entire Bible it would
[1:47:29] break the first commandment Thou shalt
[1:47:31] not have any other God before me all
[1:47:36] right it would make the whole it would
[1:47:40] make the whole Christian race a bunch of
[1:47:42] pagan
[1:47:44] worshippers worshiping three different
[1:47:46] gods and that kind of Bible would have
[1:47:51] then that kind of Bible you'd have then
[1:47:54] it makes us what the Jews say we are
[1:47:58] said which one of them Gods is your god
[1:48:02] see you can't you must mustn't in
[1:48:07] misinterpret the
[1:48:10] Bible amen you see down through the age
[1:48:13] we start off with the
[1:48:16] foundation from the found from the first
[1:48:19] church age when the seed went down in
[1:48:22] into the ground the complete seed then
[1:48:26] it comes out through the feet
[1:48:30] Luther now I want you to stay with
[1:48:33] because the in in the pyramid teaching
[1:48:35] it starts there at the first church and
[1:48:38] it goes all the way up into the
[1:48:40] Capstone okay now which is what the
[1:48:44] Capstone we'll get into that slow down
[1:48:47] let's just keep reading for a minute
[1:48:48] then we'll get into all of that
[1:48:50] interpret the Bible manifest the AG and
[1:48:52] part of his body being
[1:48:55] manifest uh did I go ahead of myself it
[1:48:58] will break the first commandment D and
[1:49:01] Jesus himself interpret the Bible made
[1:49:03] manifest in the Age part of his body
[1:49:06] okay I'll just take it from there part
[1:49:07] of his body is being made manifest we
[1:49:09] came out through the Lutheran age
[1:49:10] through the feet okay now what are we
[1:49:12] doing we we we're the mystical Body of
[1:49:18] Christ amen is being uh uh revealed
[1:49:23] amen starting there in the Lutheran age
[1:49:27] the feet amen uh uh and and and they
[1:49:31] went on okay it must
[1:49:34] be uh he made manifest in the age that
[1:49:39] the part of his body is being made
[1:49:43] manifest it's a hand age it must be a
[1:49:48] hand it can't be a head it if it's a
[1:49:54] voice age well it can't be a foot see
[1:49:58] and now we're at the I age I'm
[1:50:02] guaranteed I don't skipped a whole lot
[1:50:05] but what happened here let me see if I
[1:50:06] can go back because I don't want you to
[1:50:08] miss this um misinterpret Jesus if
[1:50:10] anybody
[1:50:11] misinterprets
[1:50:15] amen hold on down there the foundation
[1:50:18] at first age when the seed ground came
[1:50:20] complete it came up through the Luther
[1:50:22] come back out of the Wesley then to the
[1:50:25] Pentecost are you with me amen the
[1:50:29] tongue and the
[1:50:31] lips now see he said Luther was de feet
[1:50:35] then the Torso and the body came up to
[1:50:37] Wesley amen and then when the Pentecost
[1:50:41] came he said the
[1:50:43] tongues and the
[1:50:45] lips amen now it's in the
[1:50:50] eyes a prophet IC Malachi 4 and so forth
[1:50:56] and now there's nothing else to come but
[1:51:00] him himself step into that cause that's
[1:51:04] where the last thing is
[1:51:07] now we came up the gospel came up Luther
[1:51:12] age Wesley we building the mystical
[1:51:15] revealing the mystical Body of
[1:51:17] Christ amen and it must be it's a
[1:51:20] complete body amen get out of here and
[1:51:23] he said that they came there to a
[1:51:26] certain age their Pentecost amen and
[1:51:29] their thing was speaking in tongues why
[1:51:31] because it was the age of the time of
[1:51:33] the
[1:51:35] lips so they were saying Jesus Jesus
[1:51:37] Jesus Jesus Jesus Jes and the tong and
[1:51:39] everything but they didn't have the eyes
[1:51:45] yet which is the the rain amen the
[1:51:49] teaching rain
[1:51:53] amen he had to send a prophet a prophet
[1:51:56] is a sear one who can fly high as an
[1:52:00] eagle
[1:52:01] anointing amen and look way down the
[1:52:04] road in front of you and look way down
[1:52:06] in the road behind you tell you where
[1:52:09] you came from amen tell you where you're
[1:52:11] going that's right amen see in the mall
[1:52:16] I needed some
[1:52:18] eyes so I needed to go to the kios amen
[1:52:23] this is where I'm at so he needed to
[1:52:26] send a prophet amen with the ability
[1:52:30] Amen to see
[1:52:33] AAR
[1:52:36] now this is when I I I called my wife
[1:52:39] what what what she don't know where to
[1:52:41] go she don't know where I'm
[1:52:43] at that's the lip
[1:52:46] age that's the lip age I can call I can
[1:52:51] ask somebody
[1:52:53] but now we're in a whole different time
[1:52:56] I have the
[1:52:57] eye you see and that's where we were as
[1:53:00] little kids we begin to see things
[1:53:03] differently and there was a I think it
[1:53:06] was Brother Willie they say they they
[1:53:08] they they most people confuse us and
[1:53:10] they say Well they're so
[1:53:13] arrogant well it's hard to be arrogant
[1:53:16] when I can see not I'm I can
[1:53:20] see I'm telling you still in your lips
[1:53:25] your lips can't
[1:53:27] see now we're not doing away with the
[1:53:31] lips we still need the
[1:53:34] lips in the church because that's what
[1:53:38] keeps the church
[1:53:40] clean but we needed teaching on how to
[1:53:43] use the lips yes sir sometime you got to
[1:53:46] keep your mouth
[1:53:50] shut see without the Li without the
[1:53:53] eyes amen the the the the the teaching

[1:54:06] curse don't tell me they weren doing I
[1:54:08] heard
[1:54:10] them and speak in tongues right
[1:54:16] after so we needed something
[1:54:20] more we needed
[1:54:23] intelligence so after the
[1:54:25] lips I can read it but I'mma preach it
[1:54:28] if you don't
[1:54:29] mind after the lips what is
[1:54:34] next now ain't no nose we got to the
[1:54:38] lips the nose and then the eyes we had a
[1:54:40] Prophet come on the
[1:54:41] scene a sear one that could see a far
[1:54:46] off and what was it begin to rain down
[1:54:51] teaching
[1:54:53] but we weren done yet we still lost in
[1:54:57] them all we need the
[1:55:02] intelligence notice the lips it is a
[1:55:06] movement so we had a movement but now we
[1:55:10] are we we're in a we're at a point amen
[1:55:14] where the mind of God is coming back and
[1:55:16] brother Willie pointed this out we were
[1:55:17] there with brother gild are you ready to
[1:55:19] go into the mind what happened we were
[1:55:22] was learning and the Revelation was
[1:55:24] dropping that it takes the
[1:55:27] intelligence of almighty
[1:55:30] God to lead us out of this mall of Life
[1:55:35] the lips alone won't do it because all
[1:55:39] that's going to do is you're going to
[1:55:40] ask somebody you're going to ask the
[1:55:41] wrong person how do I get out of here
[1:55:43] and they got a way for
[1:55:46] you they don't even know we need the
