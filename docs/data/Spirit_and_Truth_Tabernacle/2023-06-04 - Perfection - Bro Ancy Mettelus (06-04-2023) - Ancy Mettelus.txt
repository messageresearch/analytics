that but uh God is able to deliver and you know oftentimes we see people get involved in that uh brother Branham told us that there is a a thirst that people have and uh the the thing of it is is that they'll never get that first satisfied until they come in contact with the person of the Lord Jesus amen when we talk about Jesus not some fiction story but he's a real person amen and you can have you can have a relationship with him amen and I tell you so we just want to pray for my cousin uh as well as we want to pray for her sister Zelma's brother uh Jerry teller let's let's bow Amen in a

in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ uh father we have a couple requests here that are dealing with some very serious situations Lord our sister Zelma is standing in the gap on behalf of her brother Lord who had a stroke and a suffering bleeding on the brain and God her request is the healing of his soul as well as the healing of his body Lord he's a backslider and she wants to she's praying that he would come to repentance through this Lord I I remember your Prophet praying of a man that had a stroke and he asked you to reverse the effects of the stroke father we asked you to do the same thing on Jerry's behalf reverse the effects of the stroke Lord and father he would come back to his right mind and that he would be able to Lord be able to repent amen and give his heart back to you Lord we we ask you to use this for your glory somehow some way Lord I have a cousin Lord that has also turned from you Lord Jesus and follow fall fell into some really dark places but Lord we know that you are a deliverer and father we know the doctors have given them only two weeks to live but Lord if he could come in contact with you then he could he could have life and have it more abundantly so father we ask that you would touch to Marcus right now we send the word right where he is May healing virtue flow and father may he feel the presence of God may he realize that you are a real person amen and he can have a relationship with you God so we act that you would move on the scene Lord and work a miracle in his heart and in his life father there's many saints that have lifted

[Music] [Music] amen amenities bless you I don't believe that you're here this morning by accident I believe that this service has been watching over this service since eternity he knew that we would be here this morning and he knew that you would be here individually this morning and in his promise he said I shall be with you all the days till the end of the world he's not here just to watch who has given us this opportunity the Lord is never late and we believe that he is a great planner I thank the Lord that I can be here I have my family that's here with me [Music] you can see the family you know not only that they were born man but I can see that God has given me the grace that they have accepted the message of the end time as well and we thank the Lord for that visit us you see my son translating amen the gospel you have to hear it in your native tongue all right I'm a teacher here in the United States if there's no translator I could have done it but your deliverance it can be in just one single word you might be waiting for that word but you miss it but that's where your deliverance was if he my name is everyone calls me by my middle name since I've been little they don't call me Mark yeah you called me they call me NC Okay police is only a few of my classmates actually call me Mark Amazon we will read together 19. [Music] verse 16 through 21. Matthew 19 verse 16 through 21 and behold one came and said unto him good Master what good thing shall I do that I may and that I may have eternal life and he said unto him why call us doubt me good there is none good but one that is God but if thou will enter into life keep the Commandments he said unto him which Jesus said Thou shalt do no murder Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false witness honor thy father and thy mother and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself the young man said unto him all these things have I kept from my youth up what lack I yet Jesus said unto him if thou were if thou will be perfect go and sell that thou has and give to the poor thou shall have treasure in heaven and come and follow me but when the young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions amen and then we'll go now to Mark 10. Mark tells the same story but we'll only read one verse from verse 17 down you will see it as the same story but we'll read verse 21. then Jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing thou lack is go thy way so whatsoever thou has and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and take up the cross and follow me amen amen amen let us bow our heads Vietnamese beloved Heavenly Father we thank you that you've allowed us to be here this morning you are here Lord not to just be here as a spectator but to operate all things that this scripture that we've read we know that the word is already blessed we ask that you increase just as you multiply the bread and the fish Naturally Speaking you fed the people foreign amen amen amen hallelujah glory to God you may be seated amen foreign do not forget you come to Christ but the random says we do not come to church to listen to a good speech we come to hear someone speak because and what is said whether you like it or you dislike it but if it is the truth what do you do don't chew Valley swallow all right what did John do yeah a type of the Bride he said he swallowed it if you chew it you might taste it because it's bitter but nonetheless it's medication for your soul that's the only thing that can transformed word of this hour amen don't you if you chew it you'll taste it you might spit it out no say no just swallow it it's not cracker that is why if God said it swallow it the world they walk based on what they see but us we walk by faith that means if God said something so we may not understand it we must do it we must believe it amen amen we will speak on Perfection this morning and we take that thought from Mark 19 verse 21. Matthew and we'll see what it says perfect he says if that will be perfect Mateo this morning God doesn't call you to just be good he requires you to be perfect he says be ye therefore perfect your heavenly father is perfect it's not something you're gonna make up says being the bride of Christ all things the price of our Earthly Journey has already been paid a full in full [Music] that is what is required that's why for you to be perfect he's not giving you a burden to carry he's not telling you to do something that's impossible he will provide you the way in this message and obey this man was a good man he's obeyed all the Commandments but he was missing something it was a new hour that's why and the message for your day recognize the day and the message for that day he was a good man very religious surely he never missed the service these I followed since my birth but he was still missing something let me tell you this morning there is no eternal life in a church there is eternal life in Jesus Christ but there's only carrier it's not that she will receive eternal life he says if one shall hear my voice not that the person shall have eternal life that person has eternal life let me tell you this morning there is a group right now that has eternal life called the bride of Christ [Applause] there are many here who are saved and have eternal life it says Jesus looked upon him and loved him Jesus wanted to save him Jesus loved him that's what the word says the world will perish in its conditions not from lack of God's love is here it's clear Jesus came he went to the Cross he paid the price the one thing you do it's very simple say acceptance accept that accept it that's all he says the world will perish he says the love of many shall wax cold that's what we find that's the prophecy for our age the world is perishing not because God doesn't love them the same way bodies what [Applause] he says will I find a building no is that what he says sister love must be reciprocated [Music] for it to withhold the word says Jesus looked upon him and loved him when you love someone you have to tell them the truth that is why every true Minister must speak the truth to the people that they lead Bhaskar because you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free right that means you must respond to God's love how much time do you spend with him how much time do you spend in prayer asked by the brand of questions how do I love the Lord more a simple answer he says read your Bible pray every day read your Bible pray every day if you read the word and you will fall in love more with the Lord a close connection with God it's a very simple answer read your Bible every day because the Bible says is God in the form of word that's what it is so let me know two thousand years ago Jesus projected his love again and no one cared for it wow the nominations of that day the religious leaders of that day you wish they rejected it your wish tell them more they rejected that love even those who walked with him Ministers of the message 70 of them they rejected him right 12th state because they understood he said if you don't eat my flesh drink my blood you will not have eternal life be it's not that he understood but there's one thing Peter had you had the revelation if I leave Jesus he will die he recognized that in Jesus is the carrier of eternal life there are things you don't understand in the message does that mean you leave no no ah let it up here go into prayer because you are beloved to the revelation Daniel didn't understand he went into prayer the angel came is he says I'm set to tell you that you are beloved Angela and the angels and gave them the understanding of the scripture so say attitude it is your attitude you don't understand something remember based on my experience in this message there are things I read say man that is tough to swallow the Holy Ghost is my witness God has always come down and revealed it to me the things that I didn't understand attributes of God manifested In the Flesh that's what we are we are part of the word so we can never deny the word the message the message said is God in the form of the word revealed for this hour we cannot deny it we will not deny it [Applause] is a lack of divine love we find this morning that's why you found in second Timothy 3. it speaks of the Prophecies of the end day right right [Music] an appearance of godliness does it hide to smoke no no yes but they're in the world no no you can't do it that way make a choice between guys Saturn and the devil [Music] [Applause] make a choice to serve the Lord one foot out he says they'll love you Pleasures they'll be traitors they'll be Slanders okay yeah they'll be prideful and so on you're fine he says meaning it's churches of course the lack of from a lack of divine love that will get to said conditions there are things that he says denying the power thereof the message has two principal goals first of all get you to the baptism of the Holy Ghost second of all to make you the love divine incarnated it's only love that can make it to the other side that's why you must love God with all your heart with all your strengths with all your soul and serve them amen [Applause] [Music] we immediat Ely let me tell you it is impossible it is impossible amen [Applause] you can't live it the amen say Amen when you say Amen this is the truth you will be able to live it [Music] if it's the truth but you're unable to live it don't be upset don't get angry with the preacher the amen just say Amen foreign amen amen it is impossible to reach perfection without Divine love that is perfect love words produces perfect faith and perfect faith is a limitless faith is a limitless Faith right and they shook the kingdom of hell later on Jesus spoke a word and they denied that word that's not perfect Faith you can cast out devils and not have perfect faith faith has levels faith has levels when Jesus said to Peter this is how many times you must forgive your brother when he trespasses again 70 times in just one day ah come on yeah work on that Peter recognized it needed more faith than he had it causes you to forgive your trespassers everyone no matter the level of offense what that means he needed a higher level of Faith speak in tongues Shake all the kingdom of hell but yet you still don't have perfect Faith perfect faith will forgive his brother forgive his sister leads a higher level of faith ah impossible it is impossible that without Divine love who reveal a perfect to reach perfection Perfection is Jesus Christ himself when you accept him once you are born again you are perfect but many times men have their own understanding of what Perfection is even with the Holy Ghost all right I'm gonna set this window with the Holy Ghost In You I've accepted with the Holy Ghost in you you will make mistakes and God will allow you to do so all of that you can always remember you're a man they will always remain in humility you are perfect perfect you're perfect Perfection is not how we understand it all right let's see what the prophet says a few quotes Israel and the church number two March 26 1953. God has argument paragraph 28. God has already glorified his church will be glorified God will glorify or has already already glorifies those who he justified he also glorified glorified in the church knowledge in Christ now Chris yes if you're justified in Christ you are glorified in Christ already as far as God is concerned Jesus said be ye therefore perfect yes even as your father in Heaven is perfect how could you ever be perfect but in the sight of Christ of Christ alone look at things and they see the mistake mistakes God's goggles see how God sees so you stop condemning others and have patience with people [Applause] wait Glory but in the sight of Christ tonight I swear every born-again Christian that's it brother is perfect I'm just as perfect in God as Christ was um you are too ah what do you say you are too you are two women too you are too every other believer for it's not my Holiness meaning Christ took your place at the cross it's not my Holiness it's not my Holiness he's he is amen hey [Laughter] let's go again another quote Yeah law or Grace October 6. you can't walk with both [Laughter] Jesus didn't make a mistake when he said therefore perfect Jesus was the word walking on this Earth the only man that's never said that's not what I meant that's not that's not what I meant um you can me even be preaching and you say something you didn't mean but Jesus he was the word when he says something that's what he meant to say he shall have a bride of the word you want to push power a pride of the words and that's what will happen amen he's never lied Jesus didn't make a mistake about 12 when he said be ye therefore perfect even as your father is perfect How could a human being be perfect he could be perfect by his perfect Faith uh is a child of love it's perfect love that'll produce perfect faith [Music] yeah resting in him maybe repossessedly saying he paid the price for me Jesus Paid It All I told you already said our wife is Jolly is fully paid on Calvary our Earthly journey is fully paid at Calvary amen he paid it all yeah man who is all to him I owe baby sin has left a Crimson Stain is he washed it white as snow my that makes us all shout that makes us all shouting methodists you should shout as well amen when you think of that what he's done for you at Calvary you believe it when you walk around outside even at work they should call you crazy foreign it's a good craziness when you're crazy for Jesus so before Lee it's a good craziness amen God needs people no you love him with all their heart all their strength and all their souls that's what he's expecting from you if it's not that way there's an idolaters idolatry somewhere hidden if you can't love him with all your heart your soul all your might yeah there's an idol somewhere [Music] you spend too much time on it all right there's an idol somewhere if you can be working three jobs and you have no time for service so you know that that's an idol forget them you need to make time for the Lord put time aside for him spirituality and to maintain a spiritual atmosphere you can set this week even if you have the Holy Ghost foreign [Music] who thirsts there's itself is a blessing he says even if you haven't drank the water yet means is a blessing why is it a blessing because The Thirst is sending a signal to the body tell the body I need water otherwise walking and you were just faint from dehydration they shall be filled amen this morning we need The Thirst in our heart if we're already filled as we with the Holy Ghost you're responsible to keep feeding them what does the Holy Ghost eat prayers meditation singing foreign [Applause] be thirsty this morning you go seeking for the Lord amen amen but God is asking foreign [Applause] accept Jesus Christ acceptance not half of the word accepted the entire word Jesus is the word we maybe so you'll see I want to paint a picture for you Luke said let's go to Luke chapter 7. Luke said Luke said Luke chapter seven let's go to verse 37. we're here this morning we are in this world no one has ever seen Jesus in the flesh look at you they should be able to see Jesus walking on this Earth they don't have time to read their Bible they don't read it you should be the Bible on this Earth so that means when they don't want Jesus they reject Jesus you should be elevating him even higher you should stand up for him this woman is a sinful woman Simon invited Jesus to his house the thing with Jesus if you invite him he'll come no matter the person but you invite him to elevate his name or you want him to come to your life to do what women for me I need the Lord Jesus every single day every hour every minute I need him even this breath that I'm taking in right now he's the one who allows me to do it that's why we need him you need him he lives the word through you that's what it is he says I will give you a new heart a new spirit what and I will take my spirit and put it in you in Rafael's and you shall keep my Commandments Jesus is the one who lives the word in you Jesus is the one who comes in you and lives you think you have the capacity to live the word no no Jesus chose you had you chosen him you would have abandoned him and the trial the tests don't you see there's times you even want to run [Music] since he is the comforter see you he whispers in your ears your husband Whispering you sweet nothings and that gives you strength and you keep moving forward it comes to put you on the ground but Jesus tell him he's the one let me tell you what happened we'll get back to that verse let's go to first John first John chapter 5. this is my favorite 19 and 20. we know that we are of God because and that the world is under the power of the wicked one is the whole world is under the power of wickedness you think you would be spared you're a liar from the crib the child is here you bringing them up they've never seen or their mother lied they do something in the house who moved this here not me not me I don't know I don't know shuck Papa every father has children in the house they have another child called I don't know everything I don't know did it from the crib that's right but the brand name says you're not responsible for being a sinner you're born that way you're born a sinner man you are responsible because you're rejected the Salvation you rejected Christ the world is condemned pressure not because they are sinners because they sing because they're born that way but they're responsible because they reject his love foreign [Laughter] if God Mateo if it's not for him you would be out there drinking like them smoking weed just like them doing whatever even if you were there this morning glory that he took you out what you see [Applause] intelligence had given us an understanding that we may know him that is true this is what you see me this is eternal life that's why no eternal life outside of Christ me follow me sell all that you have follow me there is no eternal life outside of Christ that is the true God the true God and eternal life he gave you understanding to choose him he chose you the success that's why he also holds you um when you fall he gets you up what let's go back it looks at Luke 7. my God Rick said was he Luke said Luke 7 37. you know the story but there's something I want to bring your attention to your family they're very precise a sinful woman what you see Simon invited Jesus to humiliate him God is never defeated he is the provider where'd this woman come from even the men don't know how she got in amen they ask themselves how did she get in yeah they invited Jesus to humiliate him [Music] someone must be there to stand for him this woman how did she get inside you know God blinds people this woman no one knows how she got it at Jesus feet her tears washing his feet and use her hair to wipe it what is based on the customer when you invite someone stand at the door and then you wash their feet from walking you take care of the person you welcome them and all these things Jesus did not receive such treatment he didn't receive that but since he is never defeated there's an elect somewhere it's not because you're in sin it's not because you're in sin you're a sinner what seed do you have that's what's important I've never condemned anyone for what they do no no what bothers me is when you fall when they bring you the word what is your reaction to the word that's the problem it's about so far not because of what you've done on your head you have no control the bird builds a nest that you have control over you can stop the bird from building a nest it's not cracker that's why I believe every sinner by grace who is a predestinated elect yeah they will overcome the world and they will overcome sin because they'll have that perfect face that overcomes this world our faith they will have their Victory every single elect will have their victory but the world's already conquered defeated knew some we are in our Victory our role as an elect as it was in the Old Testament when Abraham and so forth when they burn the sacrifice they have a staff in their hands so that animals don't come and eat their sacrifice you have the word in your hands don't let the devil yes I can come and eat your sacrifice their hands as they're offering their sacrifice they hit the bird don't let the devil whisper in your ears and tell you that you're not one of them it's because you're saved it's because you are awesome why is he telling the Sinners out there they're not saved some men but he comes to you who is accepted the message the devil is a liar s he's telling you you won't be raptured because he knows you will be he knows you'll be amen always think of it this way you know the devil North and South they'll never meet if God says something the devil will always tell you the contrary the word doesn't say you're saved the word says you're safe do you accept Jesus as your savior we yes so you're saved don't tell me that amen that's right brother they call they brought Jesus so that they can humiliate him Jesus use this if someone owes 500. someone owes 50. and you canceled out both of their debts who will appreciate you more who will love you more black person who owed more Jesus here is rebuking Simon of what he ought to have done that he didn't do let's look at what he says let's go to verse 45. press 45 he says thou gave us me no kiss es since the time I came in has not ceased to kiss my feet foreign love will produce persons which are many are forgiven for what she loved what um she loved much but to him whom little is Forgiven the Same Love is little he said to the woman thy sins are forgiven so you see Divine love you see what that produced It produced salvation by faith what verse 49. and they sat at me to say within themselves within themselves not with their mouth in their hearts who is this That Forgives sin also what level when President says faith is by Revelation this woman knew who Jesus was Simon did not know who Jesus was he gave us the understanding a revelation it's just by Revelation amen and he said unto the woman thy faith it has saved thee you see where she receive her salvation first of all she loved him much of course because of the love her faith so will saved her so perfect love perfect faith because she loved the Lord this morning if you love God with all your heart you cannot walk out the same way you walked in [Applause] God doesn't always tell you everything he just asked you to obey now behind that obedience there are many other things to come what about us who have already abandoned everything in the same chapter this man didn't know social business this was the one business that has never had a deficit brother Brandon says it if you want to invest in something invest in Jesus because Jesus his business has never had a deficit in fact he says for those who abandoned he didn't say after the Rapture in heaven he says I'll give you sisters I'll give you Brothers I'll give you mothers I'll give you houses he said I'll give you all things you will have to sit the tribes of Israel this morning invest in Jesus amen preparedness from the day of Pentecost till this day it has never fallen sorry bro Glory good system every system in this world you do that you know they've all fall into their knees capitalism has fallen communist communism has fallen oh yeah now they're coming up with the New World Order because when nothing's worked the one hopeful for this world the one medication has always been Jesus and it will continue to always be Jesus yeah as always been Jesus and it will always still remain Jesus everything else every system shall pass this is a stone that was thrown without any hand struck the statue the Statue turned to dust that's right your only hope is Jesus Christ that's what we offer you to finish okay five okay hey expected you perfect let's look at what God is expecting from someone who is perfect John 5 because what does God expect from someone whose purpose and what do you as a Christian no expect do what do we also expect from you someone who is perfect someone who's born again since God requires Perfection let's look at what he's expecting for that perfection John 5 verse 20. thank you [Laughter] John five sorry Matthew 6 Matthew 5. that's what I was saying yeah Jesus was standing here [Laughter] that's not what I meant to say is he [Music] for I say unto you that accept your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes in no case enter the kingdom of heaven you've received more so what you've received Baptists don't have it Catholics don't have it you've received more Japanese so God also requires more you've received more verse 23. it is that thy brother has ought against thee thy gift God he feeds of our worship you see this God is giving more oh he's important to our horizontal relationship then to his vertical relationship you come to worship God you come to offer your offering me but leave liquor he would rather fall back in me you not have enemies with your brother to be enemies with your brother foreign but you did nothing about it you did nothing about it no go and then you can come back and worship that is how someone who is perfect behaves verse 25. I agree with thy advert adversary quickly you know who's the adversary it was a friend someone who is now an adversary if I've never known brother Jackie come on how can he be my adversary he doesn't know me I don't know him if we knew each other we were close now he becomes my adversary how did the devil become God's adversary [Applause] how did the devil become God's adversary he was close to him [Applause] an adversary is someone who is possessed you can tame them let me say it again was possessed such a possibly someone who is possessed it could be a friend you used to talk you used to eat together now your adversaries it could be husband and wife from sweet your sweetheart from your sweetheart to an adversary how did that happen and you say you're perfect foreign quickly that's what he says meaning sit with that adversary put them even someone who is perfect and they go seek out that reconciliation they don't wait for someone to bring the reconciliation to him they move themselves they do Festival he says do it quickly while thou are in the way with him less at any time remember there's someone who's possessed with them and fix things the adversary will deliver you to the judge and the judge will deliver you to the to the officer and thou shall be cast in prison in other words someone who is perfect they can avoid scandals because if it gets even judged it gets to the Core at that point it's already a scandalia this could be husband and wife quickly by the brand name used an example a couple that wanted us they got lawyers [Music] and they're about to split up all their wealth and this one takes this one this one and then there was a little a little shoe shoebox they're both way to grab it this one wanted this one when they opened it they found there was little clothing from a baby that they had that passed away and then they got back to themselves and they didn't move forward with that divorce what God allowed to reconcile them they remember that baby that they had in common he says you heard that it was set by them of all time thou shall not come in adultery but I say unto you whosoever looketh up on a woman and to lust after her committed adultery with her already in his heart if uh you read the message I don't have time to read the quote but the random takes this is wearing the tight clothing that then caused mental lust after them so someone who is perfect today be a stumbling block for others someone who is perfect will not behave in such a man be ye therefore perfect as thou heavenly father is perfect and then he's now going down so when a sister accepts this message time there was a uh type of clothing they used to wear it was called Scandal skirts is you can't be perfect and you are causing skin regardless of the Scandal [Applause] you're both guilty both guilty 37 give me some time I'm closing it says let your communication be yay yay there's something you must never be guilty of someone who is perfect believes all the truth that is in Jesus Christ and they also we do it must speak all truth meaning if you fall you say something that isn't true fix it go ahead and fix it the reason being you can never bury the truth if you build if you bury it it'll grow it'll come out and when it comes out it'll be a scandal once it comes out there's a cracker that's why if you make a mistake pixel to Sweet fix it right away hey [Applause] to finish no salty cake no whiskey I want to go to verse 43. you have heard me that it has been said thou shall love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy that was the law of Moses if you talk with people out there that's what they say too that's the law of Moses but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you can you love your enemy that Divine love love feel your love can't go that far and pray for those who despitefully use you not a satanic prayer a hex [Laughter] you can only accuse two people you can accuse the devil and his demons and you can accuse yourself that will cause someone to act in a certain way come to me and plead if your sin or red as crimson meaning you must admit of your guilt if your sinner read as Crimson I will have to be white wider than the snow what foreign 45 resolution the righteous and the Wicked is he moves for if you love them which love you what reward have you ask him do not even the publicans do the same the Muslims do the same you don't have a Quran you have the Bible look Christian is Christianity is based on Grace founded on forgiveness if you only love people who love you that's filio love if you greed if you salute your brethren only more than others do not even the publicans do the same verse 48 everything that he was saying he was speaking on Perfection this is how someone who is perfect behaves may he keep you may help you to understand what was said this morning richly bless you amen amen foreign [Applause] [Music] I am convinced that Lord Jesus spoke to us uh this morning [Applause] I guess um I mean the message was full of nutrients and I believe just spoke to some very direct situations and um you know we um I think when we come into the house of the Lord because this is a place of Correction uh we're coming to the house of the Lord and we hear God speak to us in his tender voice it is up to us to do something about uh what God is spoken to us and um you know I I just I pray I just absolutely pray that that we would be responsive to the word of God don't just let this go in one ear and out
