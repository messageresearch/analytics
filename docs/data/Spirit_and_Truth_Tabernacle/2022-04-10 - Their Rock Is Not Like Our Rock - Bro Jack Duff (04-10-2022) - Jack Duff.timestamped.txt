[52:12] i mentioned that uh i want to give my

[52:20] me i want to read from matthew 27
[52:24] amen and then also a little bit from
[52:27] matthew 28
[52:29] um
[52:31] we'll we'll read here this morning
[52:33] uh matthew 27
[52:35] and starting at verse 62 and i trust the
[52:38] lord to just help us
[52:40] uh in
[52:42] in the thought today
[52:43] um
[52:46] here in
[52:48] matthew
[52:49] 27 verse 62 it says now
[52:52] the next day
[52:54] that followed the day of the preparation
[52:57] the chief priests and pharisees came
[52:59] together unto pilate
[53:02] saying sir we remember
[53:04] that
[53:07] that deceiver said
[53:10] while he was yet alive
[53:12] after three days
[53:14] i will rise again
[53:17] that is what they remembered
[53:19] yeah
[53:20] and um
[53:21] so command therefore
[53:24] that the sepulcher be made sure
[53:28] until the third day
[53:30] lester's disciples come by night so they
[53:32] already got in a mind what's gonna
[53:34] happen that the disciples gonna do this
[53:37] amen the disciples gonna come by night
[53:39] and steal him away and say unto the
[53:42] people
[53:43] he is risen
[53:46] we don't want the disciples to do that
[53:48] he is risen from the dead so the last
[53:50] error shall be worse than the first
[53:53] uh pilate
[53:55] said unto them you have a watch
[53:58] go your way
[53:59] make it
[54:01] as sure as you can
[54:03] as you can
[54:04] so they went
[54:06] and made the
[54:08] sepulcher sure
[54:11] sealing the stone
[54:13] and setting a watch
[54:15] you can imagine these guys can't even go
[54:17] to sleep they up on 24-hour shifts
[54:20] trying to make it as sure as they can
[54:24] let's turn over to matthew 28
[54:26] let's pick up verse 11.
[54:31] is now when they were going behold some
[54:34] of the watch the same ones that was
[54:36] assigned to watch some of the watch came
[54:39] into the city
[54:40] and showed them to the chief priests all
[54:43] the things that were done
[54:46] and when they were assembled with the
[54:48] elders and had taken counsel
[54:51] they gave large money
[54:54] unto the soldiers
[54:56] saying
[54:57] say ye so they're going to pay you
[55:01] to tell a lie
[55:05] saying say ye his disciples came by
[55:08] night
[55:09] and stole him away
[55:10] while we slept
[55:13] ain't that something now these guys had
[55:15] a they had an easy job they went out
[55:17] there to try to make it sure they then
[55:19] they come back and told the stories of
[55:20] what happened well they didn't want the
[55:22] people to believe what happened so we're
[55:24] going to pay you to lie
[55:27] tell them the disciples stole them away
[55:29] came by night and stole them away while
[55:31] we slept and if this come to the
[55:34] governor's ears we will persuade him and
[55:37] secure you
[55:41] look at these fellas so they took the
[55:43] money
[55:47] and did as they were taught
[55:49] and this saying is commonly reported
[55:52] among the jews
[55:55] until this day
[55:57] the lord of the blessing to the reading
[55:59] of his word let's pray
[56:01] father
[56:02] we
[56:03] thank you

[57:36] precious brother fred reverse whatever a
[57:39] man the effects of the stroke was and

[58:53] from another angle at a later date but
[58:56] uh but i'm still in this title from
[58:58] brother lincoln so if he hears the tape

[59:42] his servants job had lost his children
[59:45] job was even losing his health amen and
[59:48] there were many things that job was
[59:50] going through but it was during this
[59:52] tremendous time in his life that he got
[59:54] a glimpse of easter amen and i want to
[59:57] encourage us this morning that you might
[59:59] be going through some difficult things
[1:00:01] amen even at uh during this season but
[1:00:04] uh i pray that god will give you a
[1:00:06] glimpse of easter
[1:00:08] amen that that that that that that that
[1:00:10] you'll get a
[1:00:12] strength amen by what you see but here
[1:00:14] in job 19 verse 17 it says my breath
[1:00:18] is strange to my wife
[1:00:20] though i entreat it for uh the
[1:00:23] children's sake of my own body yay young
[1:00:27] children despise me

[1:00:32] going through some very very trying
[1:00:34] circumstances all my inward friends
[1:00:38] abhorred me

[1:01:01] the hand of god have touched me so so
[1:01:04] even while job is going through this
[1:01:06] amen rather than have friends there to

[1:03:22] uh you know he said that you know in the
[1:03:24] tents they had all the the wounded
[1:03:26] soldiers that were in there and and many
[1:03:29] of them you know they're falling on the
[1:03:30] battlefield and many just going through
[1:03:32] so much just land on cops and says this
[1:03:34] one morning on it happened to be easter
[1:03:36] morning and and uh and there was a nurse
[1:03:39] that came in to where these guys were
[1:03:41] laying and uh and the nurse uh reached
[1:03:43] and just gave a rose to each man just
[1:03:47] gave a rose to each man and as as the
[1:03:49] men just got a hold of one rose uh it
[1:03:52] caused them to just go into tears and
[1:03:54] just begin to cry because they knew that
[1:03:56] the roads that they had received amen
[1:03:59] was a rose that was coming from a land
[1:04:01] they were fighting for
[1:04:02] a man when they when they were looking
[1:04:04] around and and going through uh this
[1:04:06] particular battle and they looked around
[1:04:09] the battlefield and they saw how
[1:04:10] desperate the situation was the rose
[1:04:13] reminded them that you know things are
[1:04:14] better back home and if we can just get
[1:04:16] through this and get back home it's

[1:09:28] job was in the rock protected by the
[1:09:30] rock glory to god amen let's go on a
[1:09:34] little further here uh when we talk
[1:09:36] about
[1:09:37] easter
[1:09:38] talk about the resurrection you know the
[1:09:41] reason that we even go to church on
[1:09:42] sunday
[1:09:43] is because we are honoring amen the day
[1:09:46] of the resurrection he rose on the day
[1:09:48] after the sabbath amen which was sunday
[1:09:51] so every time we come into church on
[1:09:52] sunday we're honoring the resurrection
[1:09:54] and what the resurrection did it was
[1:09:57] proof
[1:09:58] that uh that a man can live
[1:10:01] after he dies
[1:10:03] the resurrection is proof
[1:10:06] that a man can live
[1:10:08] after he dies
[1:10:10] glory to god but in order to have a man
[1:10:13] that assurance you got to be in the rock
[1:10:17] glory to god amen you got you you're
[1:10:19] going to have to have covering from the
[1:10:21] rock
[1:10:22] all right all right this this this quote
[1:10:24] here and letting off the pressure
[1:10:26] brother branham makes a statement he
[1:10:28] says
[1:10:29] then there came
[1:10:31] another great warrior once
[1:10:33] it says jesus of nazareth
[1:10:36] jehovah made flesh dwelling among us
[1:10:39] it says he came down and told us told us
[1:10:42] that in my father's house
[1:10:45] there are many mansions
[1:10:47] and though you have a land you can raise
[1:10:50] your homes and raise your children and
[1:10:53] raise your uh raise your crops but
[1:10:56] there's a land where man doesn't die
[1:11:00] glory where you don't have to get old
[1:11:02] and die
[1:11:03] and he was the joshua for us and he came
[1:11:07] to his cadets barnea the judgment seat
[1:11:09] which kadesh was the judgment seat and
[1:11:11] there cadence barnea for him was calvary
[1:11:15] where he bore all of our sins says and
[1:11:17] then he crossed over what we call jordan
[1:11:21] death and come back on easter morning
[1:11:23] bringing the evidence to us that a man
[1:11:25] can live
[1:11:27] after death and man then he brought back
[1:11:29] a group of grapes too and he told them
[1:11:32] to wait up there
[1:11:34] uh to the day of pentecost they all got
[1:11:36] a bit a bite of it and got the evidence
[1:11:40] man can live again and we are living
[1:11:43] again amen we have raised from the
[1:11:46] things of death unto new life and we sat
[1:11:49] together in heavenly places already in
[1:11:52] christ jesus already in eternity i like
[1:11:55] that
[1:11:57] i'm already in eternity i already made
[1:12:00] it
[1:12:01] amen i'm already an overcomer glory it's
[1:12:04] already happened it ain't nothing i'm
[1:12:06] waiting for it's already done
[1:12:09] glory to god already in eternity because
[1:12:12] we become part of his life eternal life
[1:12:15] and eternal life is god's life god but
[1:12:17] we but because we're sons and daughters
[1:12:20] of god everything had a beginning has an
[1:12:22] end so it's those things that had no
[1:12:24] beginning has no end that's that was
[1:12:26] only god so we become part of his life
[1:12:30] easter
[1:12:32] east
[1:12:33] is what separates
[1:12:34] christianity from any other religion
[1:12:39] easter is where jesus proved
[1:12:43] who he was
[1:12:45] and who he said he was
[1:12:47] easter is the proof of that let's look
[1:12:49] at three scriptures matthew 17
[1:12:52] verse 20 through 22-23
[1:12:55] amen matthew 17 verse 22-23
[1:13:00] my god my god my god
[1:13:03] amen uh uh
[1:13:05] yeah it says and they i mean while they
[1:13:08] abode in galilee
[1:13:10] jesus said unto them
[1:13:12] the son of man shall be betrayed
[1:13:14] into the hands of men
[1:13:16] and they shall kill him
[1:13:19] and the third day
[1:13:20] he shall be raised again
[1:13:23] and they were exceeding sorry
[1:13:25] now now notice the disciples he's
[1:13:26] speaking to in this verse
[1:13:29] but
[1:13:29] i read to you earlier how the religious
[1:13:31] leaders
[1:13:32] came to pilate said now we heard
[1:13:35] that the deceiver said
[1:13:37] that in three days he was going to rise
[1:13:39] again but what we need to do is make
[1:13:41] this this tomb as sure as you can amen
[1:13:46] because we what what it wasn't that they
[1:13:48] were going to try to do everything they
[1:13:50] could to stop the prophecy

[1:13:56] thing you can do
[1:13:58] that will ever stop god's prophecy

[1:14:09] but god told us
[1:14:11] amen that if we were baptized in the
[1:14:14] name of the lord jesus christ he said
[1:14:16] the promise was unto us he said he would
[1:14:19] fill us with the holy ghost he said the
[1:14:21] promise was unto us

[1:14:27] lord our god shall call and let me tell
[1:14:29] you something your child can't do
[1:14:31] nothing

[1:17:36] verse john john chapter 2 and verse 19
[1:17:39] these are things that jesus spoke out of
[1:17:41] his own mouth what leader of any faith
[1:17:46] to speak words like this
[1:17:48] and actually keep them
[1:17:50] this is what makes christianity
[1:17:52] different
[1:17:53] from any other religion and easter east
[1:17:56] itself
[1:17:57] amen is the very proof
[1:17:59] that christianity is right
[1:18:03] hallelujah here in john 2 19
[1:18:06] it says jesus answered a sinner to them
[1:18:08] destroy this temple

[1:18:26] take it again
[1:18:28] i lay down my life
[1:18:30] that i might take it again this is why

[1:18:49] and i need you to understand some church
[1:18:50] if jesus
[1:18:52] is living on the inside of you
[1:18:54] you can stand before the government with
[1:18:56] the same type of conviction
[1:18:58] no you have no power over me
[1:19:00] god allowed me to walk into this
[1:19:02] situation for his glory but you have no
[1:19:05] power over me

[1:19:10] i'm going to be the one to pick it up
[1:19:12] again

[1:22:20] the rock
[1:22:22] that's beneath the rock
[1:22:24] now we know amen when you study the
[1:22:26] message we know that uh brother branham
[1:22:28] you know had the experience of uh
[1:22:32] you know going out west and the seven
[1:22:33] angels visiting him and and before he
[1:22:35] went amen there was a a a uh some dreams
[1:22:39] that was shared and one of the dreams
[1:22:40] talked about how brother branham took a
[1:22:42] crowbar
[1:22:43] and opened up this pyramid rock and it
[1:22:46] said light had never shined on that
[1:22:48] before revelation that revelation that
[1:22:51] never come before and it was the opening
[1:22:52] of the seals
[1:22:54] amen so when it when he when he took the
[1:22:56] crowbar and he opened it amen in the
[1:22:58] dream it showed that we were about to
[1:23:00] get something that we've never seen
[1:23:01] before and that was the rock the
[1:23:03] revelation
[1:23:05] amen that was beneath everything that's
[1:23:07] what we were getting uh brother eugene
[1:23:09] braun had made a statement he says
[1:23:11] this that opened us the rock beneath the
[1:23:14] rock this is hidden manna
[1:23:16] this rock beneath the rock is hidden
[1:23:19] manner glory to god when you go to other
[1:23:21] churches there's many of them you can go
[1:23:23] to they got public manner
[1:23:26] this bible here is public manner
[1:23:29] everybody can eat from this
[1:23:31] glory to god but when you look through a
[1:23:33] prophetic lens
[1:23:35] now you got hidden manna you got the
[1:23:38] rock
[1:23:39] beneath the rock
[1:23:43] can i go a little further
[1:23:45] jesus was a rock
[1:23:47] inside of a rock
[1:23:49] and one day the tomb opened
[1:23:51] and we saw the rock
[1:23:53] inside the rock
[1:23:54] come out hallelujah
[1:23:59] glory glory glory glory let's look at a
[1:24:02] couple more scriptures
[1:24:04] deuteronomy 32
[1:24:07] hallelujah
[1:24:09] deuteronomy 32
[1:24:12] hey
[1:24:13] man
[1:24:15] i just got to see if i'm i'm where i
[1:24:17] need to be
[1:24:26] lord jesus
[1:24:28] when i start putting this sermon
[1:24:30] together i just
[1:24:31] had it going a certain direction i just
[1:24:33] want to make sure i got it right
[1:24:36] lord just help us here
[1:24:38] oh there's uh there's much to say
[1:24:44] i'll just let it flow
[1:24:45] deuteronomy 32
[1:24:48] deuteronomy 32.
[1:24:50] look at this now
[1:24:53] uh moses is
[1:24:56] is is preparing to leave
[1:24:59] amen the children of israel
[1:25:02] and um
[1:25:03] he's rehearsing some things with them
[1:25:08] and it says in verse 1
[1:25:10] it says give ear
[1:25:12] o ye heavens
[1:25:14] and i will speak
[1:25:16] and hear o earth
[1:25:18] the words of my mouth
[1:25:20] this is my doctrine
[1:25:22] shall drop as the rain
[1:25:25] my speech
[1:25:26] shall distill as the dew
[1:25:29] as a small rain upon the tender herb and
[1:25:31] as the showers upon the grass
[1:25:34] and i love the way moses put it says
[1:25:36] because i will publish
[1:25:38] the name of the lord ascribe ye
[1:25:40] greatness unto our god and what moses
[1:25:43] said i'm gonna write out a praise report
[1:25:48] i need to let people know what god has
[1:25:49] done for me
[1:25:51] and even though moses is not going into
[1:25:53] the promised land he's still got a
[1:25:55] praise
[1:25:58] glory to god any he said he says i will
[1:26:01] he says uh i will publish the name of
[1:26:03] the lord ascribe ye greatness
[1:26:06] unto our god look at this
[1:26:08] he is the rock
[1:26:11] his words i mean his work is perfect
[1:26:15] for all his ways of judgment a god of
[1:26:18] truth and without iniquity just and
[1:26:21] right is he
[1:26:23] amen now moses identifies god as the
[1:26:27] rock
[1:26:28] glory hallelujah hallelujah amen at
[1:26:31] verse 18 we're going to skip down to
[1:26:33] that he keeps kind of referring to the
[1:26:35] rock here uh uh in um in this and let me
[1:26:39] go to verse 17 says they sacrificed unto
[1:26:42] devils
[1:26:43] talking about the people that was in
[1:26:44] this land that they get ready to go into
[1:26:46] they sacrifice unto devils it says not
[1:26:49] to god
[1:26:50] to gods whom they knew not to new gods
[1:26:53] that came newly up whom your fathers
[1:26:55] feared not it says of the rock
[1:26:58] that begot thee thou are unmindful
[1:27:02] glory to god a man and has and has
[1:27:05] forgotten uh god that formed these so
[1:27:08] he's warning the children of israel that
[1:27:10] sometimes you forget where you come from
[1:27:13] glory glory you were born underneath the
[1:27:16] rock
[1:27:17] amen you were protected by the rock
[1:27:20] amen amen he was i mean he was your
[1:27:22] healing while you were going through the
[1:27:24] wilderness and and and uh and you were
[1:27:26] bitten by snakes and you turned to look
[1:27:27] at that pole it's the rock that gave you
[1:27:29] that commandment it's the rock that kept
[1:27:32] his word god is the rock
[1:27:36] amen glory to god glory to god
[1:27:40] hallelujah god himself is the rock and
[1:27:44] if they say don't forget where you came
[1:27:46] from glory to god and it say of the rock
[1:27:49] they they that begot thee thou art
[1:27:51] unmindful so don't forget about the rock
[1:27:55] glory hallelujah all right now look at
[1:27:58] this go on to verse 30 amen in the same
[1:28:01] chapter i'm just kind of skipping amen
[1:28:03] but here here it is in 30
[1:28:06] my my my my mind how should one chase a
[1:28:09] thousand
[1:28:11] glory amen and two put ten thousand to
[1:28:15] flight
[1:28:16] how's that gonna happen
[1:28:18] except that rock
[1:28:20] had sold them
[1:28:22] amen and the lord had shut them up now i
[1:28:25] need you to just understand something
[1:28:27] and that that that their rock hat sold
[1:28:30] them it means to be given over to death
[1:28:33] the word soul means to be given over to
[1:28:36] death and our rock sold us
[1:28:40] our rock was given over to death amen he
[1:28:43] laid his life down so he could pick it
[1:28:46] up again
[1:28:47] oh i'm talking i'm telling you this
[1:28:49] morning their rock
[1:28:51] it's not like our rock
[1:28:54] glory to god
[1:28:56] glory now look at the next verse 31 says
[1:28:59] for their rock
[1:29:02] is not as our rock
[1:29:04] i told you brother brother lincoln
[1:29:05] didn't get this of himself amen it came
[1:29:08] from the scripture for their rock is not
[1:29:10] amen as our rock even our enemies
[1:29:13] themselves being judges
[1:29:16] i love this i love this amen this this
[1:29:19] rock in this
[1:29:21] uh portion of scripture
[1:29:23] it's uh i was just looking at it in this
[1:29:25] this little book that i got called keys
[1:29:28] to the bible
[1:29:29] amen uh sister michelle gave that to me
[1:29:32] years ago a lady i met by the name of uh
[1:29:34] uh miss dolly amen and her husband was a
[1:29:38] minister and uh he had this little book
[1:29:41] and just i mean just keys to the bible
[1:29:43] just little things you can go get a
[1:29:45] definition of and and every once in a
[1:29:47] while i'd go back to that book and just
[1:29:48] pull something out it's one of the first
[1:29:50] things i got
[1:29:51] starting out in ministry so i appreciate
[1:29:53] it but i got a little definition on that
[1:29:55] when we look at rock in the bible it has
[1:29:57] multiple definitions
[1:29:59] one of them is a man a vast mass of
[1:30:02] stone
[1:30:04] a rock is a vast
[1:30:06] mass of stone and and they use the
[1:30:09] famous rock of horeb
[1:30:11] amen just bear with me because i want to
[1:30:14] talk about that a little bit later amen
[1:30:17] they they use that the the
[1:30:19] famous rock of horeb amen this is where
[1:30:22] moses was told to uh to to to to
[1:30:26] smite the rock it was a rock of horup it
[1:30:29] was the rock of horp that's what he
[1:30:30] smoked and that's where the water came
[1:30:32] out so it's a vast
[1:30:35] mass of stone
[1:30:37] another definition especially in the
[1:30:39] scriptures that we just read out of
[1:30:41] deuteronomy 32 where it says their rock
[1:30:43] is not like our rock amen and that in
[1:30:46] that portion of scripture it means
[1:30:48] god as the author and source of all
[1:30:52] blessings
[1:30:53] so when i say that they're rock
[1:30:55] it's not like they're that like my rock
[1:30:58] i'm saying god is my source
[1:31:02] i'm saying god is my shepherd
[1:31:05] god is my help
[1:31:08] god is my salvation
[1:31:11] god is my provider
[1:31:13] god is my protector god is my king
[1:31:18] god is my hope
[1:31:20] god is my redeemer
[1:31:23] god is my way out of no way
[1:31:26] god is my burden bearer
[1:31:28] god is my heavy load sheriff
[1:31:31] god is my peace
[1:31:33] god is my keeper
[1:31:35] god is my healer
[1:31:37] god is my strength
[1:31:39] glory to god amen god god is everything
[1:31:43] i need and more
[1:31:46] god is my all
[1:31:48] when i say that a rock is not like my
[1:31:50] rock i'm saying god is the source of all
[1:31:53] my blessings
[1:31:56] and i don't forget where i got my
[1:31:58] blessings from
[1:31:59] and when i need a new blessing i just go
[1:32:03] to the rock
[1:32:09] glory to god
[1:32:13] i think david also tried to take an
[1:32:15] opportunity to explain this to us
[1:32:18] so let's look at what he says in second
[1:32:20] samuel 22
[1:32:24] hallelujah
[1:32:26] glory glory glory
[1:32:28] second samuel 22.
[1:32:31] uh let's look at this amen david is
[1:32:32] explaining
[1:32:34] uh what god is hey
[1:32:36] and and david was a man that went
[1:32:38] through some really really tough
[1:32:40] circumstances
[1:32:42] david um
[1:32:44] david was running from saul
[1:32:46] man trying to kill him uh uh over and
[1:32:49] over again he's trying to kill this kill
[1:32:51] saul is trying to kill him not only that
[1:32:53] we have uh you know he's uh he's in in
[1:32:56] battle with with some of
[1:32:58] the the
[1:32:59] uh he's in war even with the philistines
[1:33:01] he has to fight other nations i mean
[1:33:03] he's always constantly in battle always
[1:33:06] in trouble
[1:33:07] my god my god but david just began to
[1:33:10] think about the rock
[1:33:12] and he began to write some things here
[1:33:15] amen second samuel 22 says in david
[1:33:19] speaking to the lord
[1:33:21] the words of this song
[1:33:23] and the day that the lord had delivered
[1:33:25] him out of the hand of all his enemies
[1:33:28] and out of the hand of saul now the song
[1:33:30] could not come to david until after he
[1:33:32] had gone through the situation
[1:33:35] you get inspiration by the things you go
[1:33:37] through
[1:33:40] glory glory glory you get strength out
[1:33:43] of things that you go through
[1:33:45] hey look at david now it says he wrote
[1:33:47] this song
[1:33:48] amen the words of the lord
[1:33:50] david speaking to the lord the words of
[1:33:52] the son and the day that the lord had
[1:33:53] delivered him out of the hand of all his
[1:33:55] enemies and out of the hand of saul and
[1:33:58] he said the lord
[1:34:00] is my rock
[1:34:02] now you got to get this now because
[1:34:04] david you know as i was reading this i
[1:34:06] thought about david hiding in a cave
[1:34:09] and now one time he get in the cave he's
[1:34:11] hiding from saul and saul comes into the
[1:34:14] very cave that david is in my god amen
[1:34:19] here david is protected i mean now if
[1:34:22] david were to sneeze
[1:34:24] [Applause]
[1:34:27] if david would have just did anything to
[1:34:29] give his position
[1:34:31] and saul would have known that he was
[1:34:33] actually in the rock
[1:34:35] with david
[1:34:37] but but what happens that david sits
[1:34:39] there quiet doesn't say anything and
[1:34:41] before you know it amen the rock began
[1:34:44] to work
[1:34:45] on saul
[1:34:47] and the rock i'm talking about the lord
[1:34:49] jesus he calls saul to go into a deep
[1:34:51] sleep
[1:34:53] amen and while david is there somebody
[1:34:55] said david now look
[1:34:57] god has brought saul right into your
[1:35:00] hands
[1:35:01] so you can slam right now david said no
[1:35:02] no no no no no no don't touch god's
[1:35:04] anointing don't do anything with that
[1:35:06] just just let it be just let it be
[1:35:09] said what we'll do is maybe just take a
[1:35:11] little piece of his garment or something
[1:35:12] but but but just just let it be and
[1:35:14] david comes out of the cave runs to the
[1:35:16] other side and calls back and says saul
[1:35:19] what about this and what about that
[1:35:21] david saul says that your voice
[1:35:22] statement yeah it's my voice i was right
[1:35:25] there with you could have took your life
[1:35:26] but god god said not so
[1:35:30] david was finding protection in the rock
[1:35:35] i mean it was something greater than the
[1:35:37] cave that was his protection
[1:35:40] because in the same cave that he went in
[1:35:42] saul came into he needed a greater rock
[1:35:46] than the rock that he was in
[1:35:50] glory to god he had that he had to have
[1:35:52] a greater rock than that
[1:35:54] and god proved that he was david's rock
[1:35:57] that he was his protection
[1:36:03] i i know i know sometimes you want to
[1:36:06] depend on the doctor and there's nothing
[1:36:08] wrong with that we appreciate the
[1:36:10] doctors glory to god but sometimes you
[1:36:12] need something greater than what the
[1:36:14] doctor is saying
[1:36:16] and i want to let you know you can go to
[1:36:18] the rock
[1:36:25] there's a rock that's higher than that
[1:36:28] lead me to the rock
[1:36:34] man i want to go to the rock
[1:36:36] glory to god i get to talking about the
[1:36:38] rock i want to go to the rock
[1:36:41] my my mind
[1:36:43] he says this and he says the lord is my
[1:36:46] rock
[1:36:48] and he just didn't stop he couldn't
[1:36:50] couldn't stop himself and my fortress
[1:36:54] glory to god
[1:36:56] he had to put another car on it
[1:36:59] and my deliverer
[1:37:03] glory
[1:37:05] the god of my rock
[1:37:08] in him will i trust
[1:37:11] he is my shield
[1:37:13] glory to god
[1:37:14] and the horn of my salvation
[1:37:17] you know and i just i just love that see
[1:37:20] a horn
[1:37:21] amen is what is used to protect an
[1:37:25] animal
[1:37:26] right so so there are certain animals a
[1:37:28] man
[1:37:29] like a ram a ram has horns and when it's
[1:37:32] time for the
[1:37:33] for the for the rams to fight they fight
[1:37:35] with the horns
[1:37:37] hey man they just they back up and
[1:37:39] getting them heads going and as fast as
[1:37:41] they just go going ram against each
[1:37:43] other but his horn is his protection
[1:37:47] you know even in the scripture amen uh
[1:37:50] the lamb over in the book of revelation
[1:37:52] five had seven horns
[1:37:54] and the seven horns that was on the lamb
[1:37:57] was the lamb's protection
[1:37:59] and those seven horns represented the
[1:38:02] seven church ages
[1:38:04] oh i'm here to tell you something this
[1:38:06] morning you know the reason that people
[1:38:08] can't pull you out this message
[1:38:11] you want to know the re i mean they done
[1:38:12] talked about certain things and
[1:38:14] sometimes you even agree

[1:40:12] and he did hear my voice out of his
[1:40:15] temple

[1:42:02] have gotten
[1:42:06] god as god is moving we'll talk after
[1:42:08] service
[1:42:10] amen
[1:42:11] exodus 17
[1:42:13] amen verse 3 look at this
[1:42:17] and the people thirsted there for water
[1:42:20] and the people murmured against moses
[1:42:24] and said
[1:42:25] wherefore is this
[1:42:27] that thou has
[1:42:28] thou has brought us up out of egypt
[1:42:31] to kill us in our children and our
[1:42:34] cattle with thirst
[1:42:37] and moses cried unto the lord saying
[1:42:40] what shall i do unto this people
[1:42:43] they be almost ready to stone me
[1:42:48] and the lord said unto moses
[1:42:50] go on before the people
[1:42:52] and take with thee of the elders of
[1:42:54] israel
[1:42:55] and thy rocks
[1:42:57] he says taken thy hand and go
[1:43:01] behold i will stand before thee there
[1:43:03] upon the rock and horeb
[1:43:05] and thou shalt smite the rock
[1:43:08] and there shall come water out of it
[1:43:11] that the people may drink
[1:43:13] and moses did so in the sight of the
[1:43:15] elders of israel
[1:43:17] and he called the name of the place masa
[1:43:19] and maribel because of the tiding of the
[1:43:22] children of israel and and because they
[1:43:24] tempted the lord saying is the lord
[1:43:26] among us
[1:43:28] or not
[1:43:31] the question is is god among us or not
[1:43:34] and here moses takes his rod the same
[1:43:36] rod that brought him out of egypt night
[1:43:39] takes that rod and he smites the rock
[1:43:41] and water comes out the rock
[1:43:44] and they want to know whether god was
[1:43:45] with them or not
[1:43:47] now i want to read something to you all
[1:43:50] you know i said i said lord you know i
[1:43:52] uh you know i read the quote a little
[1:43:55] earlier where i said i said lord open to
[1:43:56] us to rock beneath the rock
[1:43:59] and there was something that i just
[1:44:01] found out about this story that i don't
[1:44:03] think i ever heard before amen this is a
[1:44:07] little rock beneath the rock
[1:44:10] look at this
[1:44:12] in the message ever-present water from
[1:44:14] the rock
[1:44:15] i want you to catch something that the
[1:44:16] prophet said
[1:44:18] it says now we find out
[1:44:22] that this calvary that they had
[1:44:25] the waters of life gushed forth for the
[1:44:27] people
[1:44:28] it says the waters of life gushed forth
[1:44:31] for the people now watch this
[1:44:34] now some people
[1:44:37] have upon their hearts and mind
[1:44:40] that all israel drank
[1:44:43] and then they packed up the camels
[1:44:47] and tied their hitches on their horses
[1:44:51] watch this
[1:44:52] and so forth now they were drinking from
[1:44:54] the rock glory to god and he said some
[1:44:57] people have in their mind some people
[1:44:59] having a mind that what israel did was
[1:45:01] just just uh uh have their horses and
[1:45:04] the animals drink from the rock
[1:45:06] he said some people had upon their
[1:45:08] hearts and minds that all israel drank
[1:45:11] and then they packed up the camels and
[1:45:13] tied their hitches on their horses
[1:45:16] and so forth and took their kids and
[1:45:19] journeyed on into somewhere else
[1:45:22] my god and left the rock there
[1:45:26] my it says sprinkling that is wrong
[1:45:31] he said that is wrong they didn't just
[1:45:33] have their animals in their their
[1:45:34] children go and drink water from the
[1:45:36] rock he say the rock followed them
[1:45:42] the rock followed them
[1:45:45] so they were asking the question is god
[1:45:48] with us or not the rock follows you
[1:45:51] wherever you go
[1:45:54] i need you to know you are never without
[1:45:58] the rock
[1:46:01] [Music]
[1:46:03] no matter what you going through
[1:46:05] sometimes you may feel like it sometimes
[1:46:09] it may seem like it but you are never
[1:46:11] without the rock
[1:46:16] the rock followed them
[1:46:18] they didn't just go and drink from the
[1:46:20] rock
[1:46:22] and just get a little water for the day
[1:46:24] but the rock followed them and kept
[1:46:26] providing water
[1:46:28] oh the rock is my provider the rock is
[1:46:31] my protector the rock is my healer the
[1:46:34] rock is my deliverer
[1:46:36] theorock is not like my rock
[1:46:41] my rock is the same yesterday today and
[1:46:44] forever
[1:46:46] [Applause]
[1:46:54] oh
[1:46:55] my
[1:46:59] let me just kind of finish reading this
[1:47:02] particular quote the rock followed them
[1:47:07] what a rock
[1:47:09] that's why i want to go to the rock
[1:47:15] [Applause]
[1:47:18] it says that rock
[1:47:21] followed them
[1:47:23] and that water followed them
[1:47:26] my god my god my god it's just i'm so
[1:47:29] sorry i i didn't give you this one
[1:47:32] did i give you this one
[1:47:35] ever present water from the rock and you

[1:47:41] 23
[1:47:43] m i want y'all to be able to see that
[1:47:45] special ones online i'm sorry i missed
[1:47:47] that y'all forgive me
[1:47:48] uh and and i and it might be paragraph
[1:47:51] 103 or you can just you can just type in
[1:47:54] the rock that rock followed them just
[1:47:56] put that in it'll come right up that
[1:47:57] rock followed them
[1:47:59] amen amen this is the one i wanted and i
[1:48:02] messed it up
[1:48:05] but the rock is still with me
[1:48:09] there it is there it is that rock
[1:48:12] followed them
[1:48:14] and that water
[1:48:15] followed them
[1:48:18] and he says now in first corinthians the
[1:48:20] 10th chapter i believe in the 11th verse
[1:48:22] you can find it that that rock followed
[1:48:24] israel wherever they went from that day
[1:48:27] henceforth
[1:48:29] that rock went with them
[1:48:32] and the waters followed them
[1:48:34] this is how the enemies could know
[1:48:37] that man there's something special about
[1:48:38] this group they got a rock
[1:48:41] following them
[1:48:43] and they can go to the rock at any time
[1:48:46] and get water
[1:48:51] anytime you can stop your complaining
[1:48:55] go to the rock
[1:49:01] he says what a beautiful type
[1:49:03] a beautiful hold and an anchor for the
[1:49:05] believer today
[1:49:07] that knows that the rock that was once
[1:49:09] smitten
[1:49:10] the water that once poured forth from
[1:49:12] calvary
[1:49:13] goes with us wherever we are
[1:49:16] oh my it's not
[1:49:18] it's not go back to a certain place and
[1:49:20] say well we did have water day before
[1:49:24] yesterday over there we got water today
[1:49:28] right here
[1:49:31] you know you don't you know i don't have
[1:49:32] to i don't have to amen i mean the the
[1:49:35] children of israel were in a place where
[1:49:36] they didn't have to actually go to a
[1:49:38] rock
[1:49:39] the rock went with them
[1:49:43] once they went to
[1:49:44] for the first time that rock began to
[1:49:46] follow them
[1:49:47] providing water all the time a rock
[1:49:52] a rock
[1:49:53] everybody would have to know this is not
[1:49:55] a normal rock
[1:49:58] their rock
[1:50:00] is not like
[1:50:02] our rock
[1:50:08] we got water today right here
[1:50:11] because that rock was christ
[1:50:13] and christ is the same yesterday today
[1:50:15] and forever see that rock followed
[1:50:19] israel
[1:50:20] they never followed the rock but the
[1:50:22] rock followed them amen israel went on
[1:50:25] their journey journey they had but one
[1:50:28] thing to do that's keep that keep the
[1:50:30] straight course right straight on into
[1:50:32] the promised land and the rock and the
[1:50:34] water followed them the rock following
[1:50:36] them first corinthians tells you so the
[1:50:38] 10th chapter all right the rock was
[1:50:39] christ let's look at first corinthians
[1:50:42] 10.
[1:50:44] verse 1 through 4.
[1:50:46] oh glory
[1:50:48] man the rock is not like our rock
[1:50:53] this is some rock
[1:50:57] here the bible says moreover brethren
[1:51:00] i would not that ye should be ignorant
[1:51:03] how that all our fathers were under the
[1:51:05] cloud
[1:51:06] and all pass through the sea
[1:51:08] and were all baptized unto moses in the
[1:51:10] cloud and in the sea
[1:51:13] and did all eat the same spiritual meat
[1:51:15] and it all drank the same spiritual
[1:51:17] drink paul
[1:51:19] says for they drank of that spiritual
[1:51:22] rock
[1:51:23] that followed them
[1:51:25] and that rock was
[1:51:27] christ
[1:51:29] god opened to us
[1:51:32] the the the rock beneath the rock
[1:51:39] and i want to tell you
[1:51:41] let me just bring it to a close on
[1:51:43] easter
[1:51:48] on easter god did just that
[1:51:51] he opened
[1:51:54] the seal that was placed on the rock
[1:51:56] they tried to make it as sure as they
[1:51:59] could
[1:52:01] see we don't want them you know and they
[1:52:03] had already conjured up in their mind
[1:52:05] the story that they wanted the people to
[1:52:07] know
[1:52:08] now we heard this deceiver say if you
[1:52:11] got that that much concern about the
[1:52:13] deceiver
[1:52:14] why would you be at the grave trying to
[1:52:17] ensure the grave can you imagine all the
[1:52:20] all the soldiers that are there amen and
[1:52:22] the guys that on 24-hour duty that they
[1:52:25] can't move that now look look nobody and
[1:52:28] i i know they had
[1:52:29] instructions you better not go to sleep
[1:52:32] you better not go to sleep you better
[1:52:34] keep your eyes because this is what they
[1:52:36] say and we don't want the disciples to
[1:52:37] come in here and steal the body these
[1:52:40] same disciples that were running
[1:52:42] from the soldiers why would these
[1:52:44] disciples get some courage to come and
[1:52:46] steal the body no it was a lie that they
[1:52:48] just wanted to tell they were afraid of
[1:52:51] the uh of the truth actually being
[1:52:53] manifested they were afraid of these
[1:52:55] things happening so they tried to make
[1:52:57] it as sure as they could
[1:53:00] i remember my brother my brother troy i
[1:53:02] thank god for him but he used to he was
[1:53:03] determined so he he just could not just
[1:53:06] come into a church
[1:53:08] a message church he know he just
[1:53:10] when he wasn't living right say i just
[1:53:11] can't come to church
[1:53:12] no i can't do that i say well you know
[1:53:14] what he said look there's an anointing
[1:53:17] that is inside the building and so he
[1:53:20] said if i get into the presence of that
[1:53:22] anointing i know i won't be able to hold
[1:53:24] on to the things that i'm holding on to
[1:53:26] so there was many times that he would
[1:53:28] dodge church
[1:53:30] run from church but i'ma tell you when
[1:53:32] when god got something in you
[1:53:35] you can't do nothing to get it out of
[1:53:37] you
[1:53:38] when god has placed it there
[1:53:40] before you even born god put it there
[1:53:43] and no matter how far you run
[1:53:47] eventually gonna run right into the rock
[1:53:51] [Applause]
[1:53:58] many of us can i mean i'm sure many have
[1:54:00] their own testimonies here how i came in
[1:54:02] contact with the rock and i found it was
[1:54:04] just better to yield to the rock
[1:54:08] the rock is bigger than me
[1:54:12] [Applause]
[1:54:13] glory hallelujah but here these fellas
[1:54:16] say we gonna make this thing as sure as
[1:54:18] we can
[1:54:20] say look look look look we want to hire
[1:54:22] some people to have them on guard we
[1:54:23] don't want them disciples to come and
[1:54:25] take his body and then they go around
[1:54:27] telling everybody he rose again make
[1:54:29] this thing as sure as you can
[1:54:31] pilots say okay y'all y'all ain't good
[1:54:33] enough y'all done y'all don't y'all
[1:54:34] don't kill the innocent man
[1:54:36] and i don't wash my hands before you i'm
[1:54:38] not guilty of this man's death
[1:54:40] say but y'all you know what y'all go do
[1:54:42] what you want to do they took out these
[1:54:44] soldiers took out whatever they could
[1:54:46] made it as sure as they could
[1:54:48] three days watching now let's pick up in
[1:54:50] the scripture
[1:54:51] what happened
[1:54:54] i can tell you
[1:54:56] but i'd like to read it
[1:54:58] matthew 28
[1:55:01] because i skipped some verses
[1:55:03] i read to you at the beginning matthew
[1:55:05] 27 verse 62 through 66
[1:55:08] and then i skipped to matthew 28 verse
[1:55:11] 11.
[1:55:13] and verse 11 says now when they were
[1:55:15] going
[1:55:17] behold some of the watch came into the
[1:55:19] city
[1:55:20] and showed them to the chief priests
[1:55:22] all the things that were done well when
[1:55:24] they were going well what was done what
[1:55:27] happened in matthew 28 verse 1 through
[1:55:29] 10.
[1:55:30] let's go back and pick it up they tried
[1:55:32] to make it as sure as they could
[1:55:37] in the end of the sabbath
[1:55:40] as he began to dawn toward the first day
[1:55:43] of the week
[1:55:44] came mary magdalene
[1:55:46] and the other mary to see the sepulcher
[1:55:50] and behold there was a great earthquake
[1:55:54] glory to god
[1:55:56] this is this is i just love god
[1:55:59] i love god you know earthquake is a
[1:56:02] grand interruption
[1:56:05] and let me tell you something when
[1:56:07] when a person is going through an
[1:56:08] earthquake
[1:56:09] all they can do is run for cover
[1:56:15] oh church
[1:56:17] all they can do is run for cover and i'm
[1:56:19] here to tell you that some of our loved
[1:56:21] ones
[1:56:22] about to experience
[1:56:24] a personal earthquake
[1:56:26] [Applause]
[1:56:28] [Music]
[1:56:29] [Applause]
[1:56:31] i mean when an earthquake happens it
[1:56:33] happens suddenly
[1:56:35] you can't plan
[1:56:37] for an earthquake
[1:56:39] you can't ensure your property amen
[1:56:43] for safety hey man you don't care about
[1:56:45] nothing in your house
[1:56:47] all you care about is you you yourself
[1:56:49] getting through the earthquake
[1:56:51] if the earth open up and swallow up this
[1:56:53] and swallow look as long as i'm alive
[1:56:56] i'll be all right
[1:57:01] god gotta open up and swallow up some
[1:57:03] relationships
[1:57:05] god gonna swallow up some friendships
[1:57:09] god don't swallow up some things that
[1:57:11] need to be taken out of your life
[1:57:13] you couldn't get rid of them yourself
[1:57:16] so he will send an earthquake
[1:57:19] a spiritual earthquake to take that
[1:57:22] thing from you
[1:57:25] [Applause]
[1:57:30] and
[1:57:32] i remember a few years ago there was a
[1:57:34] they had a little uh
[1:57:37] it was just a a like a sinkhole that
[1:57:40] opened up here in in florida and this in
[1:57:42] a way the cinco was in in a house
[1:57:46] in one room in the house
[1:57:50] man in his bed
[1:57:52] and and the earth just opened up from
[1:57:54] underneath him
[1:57:55] and all his brother heard is his noise
[1:57:58] and his brother ran to the room and
[1:58:00] stopped at the door
[1:58:02] let me tell you something when you see
[1:58:03] something like that you don't jump down
[1:58:05] there in it
[1:58:06] i'm sorry
[1:58:12] so when you see a spiritual earthquake
[1:58:14] hit somebody you can't jump in there you
[1:58:17] got to run for your own life
[1:58:20] hey
[1:58:22] god is doing that for a reason
[1:58:26] man i don't care what the devil does he
[1:58:29] can never make this thing as short as he
[1:58:32] can god will send a supernatural
[1:58:36] presence an angel to come down and open
[1:58:39] up the earth
[1:58:40] the very tomb that they're watching the
[1:58:43] very tomb that they got a guard around
[1:58:45] god sends an
[1:58:46] earthquake no they didn't go to sleep
[1:58:49] they the earth began to open up
[1:58:51] things began to happen the angels rolled
[1:58:54] the stone away and the rock that was
[1:58:57] beneath the rock the rock that was
[1:58:59] behind the rock came walking out of
[1:59:01] there praise god this is why
[1:59:04] christianity
[1:59:05] is the only religion that is right
[1:59:08] [Music]
[1:59:10] our rock
[1:59:11] is not locked in rock
[1:59:17] [Applause]
[1:59:20] i thought about even over at stonehenge
[1:59:23] they got all these big rocks
[1:59:26] and and on went to solstice and and also
[1:59:30] the spring solstice they they they go
[1:59:32] and have these little services and
[1:59:33] everything at the rock their rock is not
[1:59:35] like our rock
[1:59:37] and as i was just researching i i had
[1:59:40] you have to be careful when you start
[1:59:41] looking into things like that conspiracy
[1:59:43] behind it all right i just saw the name
[1:59:45] that the group of people that go are
[1:59:47] called druids and pagans
[1:59:50] you think i want to go to stonehenge if
[1:59:52] druids and pagans are there
[1:59:55] but i i can tell you this ain't nothing
[1:59:57] that stonehenge
[1:59:58] their rock is not like our rock
[2:00:02] our rock is alive
[2:00:05] it's a living rock and it provides water
[2:00:08] every day
[2:00:10] it sustains you every day it keeps you
[2:00:13] every day
[2:00:14] [Applause]
[2:00:20] my
[2:00:21] here the bible says in verse two and
[2:00:23] behold there was a great earthquake for
[2:00:26] the angel of the lord descended from
[2:00:27] heaven
[2:00:28] and came and rolled back the stone from
[2:00:31] the door
[2:00:32] and set upon it
[2:00:34] now what the soldiers gonna do with that
[2:00:38] religious leaders can't do nothing with
[2:00:39] that
[2:00:41] my god his countenance was like
[2:00:43] lightning
[2:00:45] and his raiment white as snow
[2:00:48] and for fear of him
[2:00:49] the keepers
[2:00:51] glory to god did shake and became as
[2:00:55] dead men now they didn't go to sleep
[2:00:58] this is a story that they were telling
[2:01:00] and they telling their own testimony but
[2:01:02] the religious leaders don't even want to
[2:01:04] hear the soldiers testimony
[2:01:08] and then they want to pay them
[2:01:10] don't tell nobody that story now don't
[2:01:12] tell them what happened to you but look
[2:01:14] look
[2:01:15] when god has done something for you
[2:01:17] can't help but tell
[2:01:19] what god has done
[2:01:21] [Applause]
[2:01:23] say you can't tell it
[2:01:25] let me tell it what the lord has done
[2:01:27] for me
[2:01:28] so so here somebody's paying them not to
[2:01:30] share their testimony at least not in
[2:01:32] public
[2:01:34] don't tell these people what just
[2:01:35] happened to you
[2:01:36] we're going to give you money so they
[2:01:37] took the money
[2:01:39] and i can i i have a feeling that they
[2:01:41] still could not get away
[2:01:42] from telling their testimony
[2:01:44] now they look they told us they gave us
[2:01:46] this money i don't spend the money now
[2:01:48] you know but look i'ma tell you what
[2:01:50] really happened
[2:01:51] i was there
[2:01:53] man it was a rock beneath the rock came
[2:01:56] out the rock
[2:01:57] [Applause]
[2:02:06] and for fear of him the keepers did
[2:02:08] shake
[2:02:10] and became his dead man
[2:02:12] and the angel answered and said unto the
[2:02:14] women
[2:02:15] fear not
[2:02:17] ye for i know that you seek jesus
[2:02:21] which was
[2:02:23] crucified
[2:02:25] oh my my my
[2:02:27] he is not here
[2:02:29] for he has risen
[2:02:32] as he says
[2:02:35] glory to god as he said he spoke it and
[2:02:37] he brought it to pass
[2:02:39] as he said come see the place
[2:02:42] where the lord lay
[2:02:44] and i've been there to see the place
[2:02:46] where the lord lay i'm here to tell you
[2:02:48] he is not there
[2:02:52] and go quickly
[2:02:54] and tell his disciples that he is risen
[2:02:56] from the dead and behold he goeth before
[2:02:59] you into galilee there shall ye see him
[2:03:03] amen lo i have told you
[2:03:07] and they departed quickly from the
[2:03:08] sepulcher with fear and great joy and
[2:03:11] did run to bring his disciples word
[2:03:14] and as they went to tell his disciples
[2:03:17] behold jesus
[2:03:22] the rock
[2:03:24] jesus met them
[2:03:26] sing all hell and they came and held
[2:03:29] them by the feet and worshiped him
[2:03:31] then said jesus unto them
[2:03:34] be not afraid
[2:03:36] go tell my brethren
[2:03:37] that they are going to galilee and there
[2:03:41] shall they see
[2:03:42] me
[2:03:46] i'm so glad he rose again
[2:03:49] i'm so glad that the rock could not hold
[2:03:51] the rock
[2:03:56] and i'm so glad that our rock is not
[2:03:58] like
[2:03:59] their rocks
[2:04:01] you know i i'll close with this this
[2:04:04] little statement here um
[2:04:06] i was just i'm going to the message
[2:04:08] god's
[2:04:08] chosen place of worship
[2:04:12] just bear with me just for a little bit
[2:04:13] yeah i'll read this and i'll close
[2:04:20] revelation 1 18 says i'm he that liveth
[2:04:22] and was dead and behold i'm alive
[2:04:23] forevermore
[2:04:25] amen and have the keys of hell and of
[2:04:27] death
[2:04:28] hearing this quote the prophet says now
[2:04:30] god told them
[2:04:32] when they before they established the
[2:04:34] temple and whatever they did
[2:04:36] i would choose a place of my worship and
[2:04:37] i put my my name in it
[2:04:40] and that's the only place that god could
[2:04:42] ever meet anybody was by his own
[2:04:44] choosing he chose his place
[2:04:46] and where he chose his place he put his
[2:04:48] name
[2:04:49] the second verse here tells us that he
[2:04:52] would put his name in the place god's
[2:04:54] chosen place of worship says he would
[2:04:56] put his name in the place that he had
[2:04:58] chosen for people to worship him in now
[2:05:01] the thing of it is we want to find
[2:05:03] where that place is
[2:05:06] says with 900 and something different
[2:05:09] ideas and actually today he said this in
[2:05:11] 1965 but today there's i think over 35
[2:05:14] or 40 000
[2:05:16] different beliefs
[2:05:18] you got to find truth because everybody
[2:05:21] ain't telling the truth some of them got
[2:05:22] part truth but you want the whole truth
[2:05:24] and nothing but the truth
[2:05:28] it says with 900 something different
[2:05:30] ideas being that
[2:05:32] that
[2:05:33] being that we're back bypass all heathen
[2:05:35] religion and just speaking of christian
[2:05:37] religion
[2:05:38] which i i have a feeling a feeling for
[2:05:41] the heathens or i would certainly or
[2:05:43] certainly wouldn't be going out there
[2:05:44] over there and talk to them but they're
[2:05:46] wrong the heathens they're wrong
[2:05:49] it says christianity is the only origin
[2:05:50] that religion that's true
[2:05:52] is christianity and i'm saying that not
[2:05:55] exactly because i am a christian
[2:05:57] because i believe that to be the truth
[2:06:00] it's the only religion that's right
[2:06:04] it says i've been to the grave
[2:06:06] where the white horses change every four
[2:06:08] hours where mohammed a great priest and
[2:06:12] leader uh right right after christ was
[2:06:14] supposedly to be a prophet and i don't
[2:06:16] doubt but what he was right after the
[2:06:19] maccabee brothers but when when he died
[2:06:21] he claimed that he would rise again and
[2:06:23] would conquer the whole world now about
[2:06:25] every four hours they change guards and
[2:06:27] they keep a white horse at his at his
[2:06:29] grave they have for two thousand years
[2:06:31] expecting him to rise again and conquer
[2:06:33] the world but you see now let me just uh
[2:06:35] just pause this just for a second
[2:06:37] you know um a couple of things i
[2:06:39] actually mean i i said you know what i
[2:06:42] want to go read about this um mohammed
[2:06:44] and the white horse changing the grave
[2:06:46] and and um
[2:06:48] i couldn't find specifically what that
[2:06:50] was saying but i did find amen some
[2:06:53] people that used to believe the message
[2:06:55] they posted something saying brother
[2:06:56] branham lied about this
[2:06:58] he said he went there to muhammad's
[2:07:01] grave and he never went there and and in
[2:07:03] this place where muhammad's grave is
[2:07:05] it's a big building there is no grace
[2:07:07] and you know they write about all that
[2:07:09] they said brother branham lied he did
[2:07:10] not go there and they say somebody in
[2:07:13] the message rise up and tell us you know
[2:07:16] uh if this is true or not because this
[2:07:18] is a lie and i'm telling you all this
[2:07:19] because when you read stuff like this
[2:07:21] you got to watch it
[2:07:23] you cannot approach god
[2:07:25] amen with your natural mind
[2:07:29] with a thought process like that
[2:07:31] amen it's going to be hard for you to
[2:07:33] believe the bible
[2:07:36] how can you talk about what happened in
[2:07:38] the garden of eden and the man that
[2:07:40] wrote about it was not there
[2:07:45] the man that wrote the book of genesis
[2:07:48] his name was moses
[2:07:50] moses was not even in
[2:07:53] uh he was nowhere near the garden of
[2:07:54] eden
[2:07:56] how does moses know that god gave eve a
[2:07:58] promise that hus uh he gonna put imagery
[2:08:00] between her seed and the serpent see how
[2:08:03] does moses know that he wasn't there to
[2:08:05] hear it
[2:08:08] here's the thing moses god had to catch
[2:08:10] up in a vision
[2:08:11] and show him all of the beginning and
[2:08:14] moses wrote that and that's how we got
[2:08:16] and i happen to believe what moses wrote
[2:08:19] and if i got faith enough to believe
[2:08:21] what moses wrote then i can believe what
[2:08:24] a prophet might have said he might not
[2:08:25] have gone there physically but a prophet
[2:08:28] has the ability to go into the spiritual
[2:08:31] realm
[2:08:32] see things that others can't see and
[2:08:34] come back and show it to us
[2:08:36] he did it when he went to that brother's
[2:08:38] house before he prayed for the baby he
[2:08:40] said does your house look like this your
[2:08:42] house looks like that does the house do
[2:08:44] you have this in the house do you have a
[2:08:45] chair over here do you have chair rail i
[2:08:47] mean the brother said when have you come
[2:08:49] to my house brother branham he said i
[2:08:51] just left
[2:08:55] and if you approach it from a natural
[2:08:57] perspective you'll miss that in the
[2:08:59] spiritual
[2:09:02] hallelujah so don't don't be questioning
[2:09:05] little things like that
[2:09:07] if this is what he said then praise the
[2:09:08] lord
[2:09:09] amen i don't belie i i don't believe uh
[2:09:12] muhammad gonna rise again
[2:09:14] i don't believe nothing about no buddha
[2:09:16] but i know christ rose again and that's
[2:09:18] all i'm that's all i'm focusing on
[2:09:20] so let's go a little further
[2:09:23] amen all right and it says
[2:09:26] and you got buddha you go you go to
[2:09:28] buddha buddha lived many hundred years
[2:09:30] about 2300 years ago the god of japan
[2:09:33] so he was a philosopher something like
[2:09:35] confucius and so forth but all these
[2:09:38] founders and so forth all of them died
[2:09:40] with their philosophy
[2:09:42] and is buried
[2:09:44] and in the grave
[2:09:45] but christianity
[2:09:47] which is established by jesus christ
[2:09:50] there is
[2:09:52] a empty tomb
[2:09:54] he was the only man that ever stood on
[2:09:56] earth and lived and said i have power
[2:09:59] to lay my life down
[2:10:01] and raise it up again
[2:10:03] and he did it
[2:10:05] and he lives today
[2:10:06] and we know he lives
[2:10:09] because he is with us
[2:10:11] and proves himself by physical signs and
[2:10:14] wonders
[2:10:14] that he promised that he would do to
[2:10:16] show it and so much as a pillow fire
[2:10:19] that led the children of israel through
[2:10:21] the wilderness
[2:10:22] it's with us today
[2:10:24] even having his picture taken performing
[2:10:27] the signs and wonders that he promised
[2:10:29] it would do in this day seeing all the
[2:10:31] words that he promised being made
[2:10:32] manifest this day therefore the rest of
[2:10:34] the healing world is out
[2:10:36] is christianity now we know about the
[2:10:39] the pill of fire above the prophet's
[2:10:40] head in houston amen the only
[2:10:43] supernatural being ever recorded on
[2:10:45] camera
[2:10:46] that they have in um
[2:10:48] the
[2:10:49] in washington dc at the library of
[2:10:51] congress
[2:10:52] we realized that but but you know the
[2:10:54] pillar fire is not just in the library
[2:10:57] of congress on a piece of paper
[2:11:00] where brother quentin was recording on
[2:11:02] his camera
[2:11:03] when we were in the old church a few
[2:11:05] years ago and he picked up on his camera
[2:11:07] a little light just moving throughout
[2:11:09] the congregation
[2:11:10] so when this quote says that the pillar
[2:11:12] of fire is here performing signs and
[2:11:14] wonders as he promised it would do in
[2:11:17] this day saying all the the words that
[2:11:18] he promised may manifest this day we can
[2:11:21] say amen to that because we've seen it
[2:11:23] on camera even in our midst
[2:11:26] oh the rock
[2:11:28] the rock will never run dry
[2:11:32] the rock gonna follow us wherever we go
[2:11:34] the rock was with us
[2:11:36] at 39 51
[2:11:38] and the rock is still with us
[2:11:40] at 3777
[2:11:43] and when we go to the next place guess
[2:11:44] what the rock gonna be right there
[2:11:51] who wouldn't serve a rock like this
[2:11:54] their rock
[2:11:55] is not like our rock

[2:20:48] you know as our pastor was preaching
[2:20:50] my mind went back to a sermon
[2:20:53] that was preached on easter once
[2:20:55] the lie that proved risen the lie that
[2:20:58] proved
[2:20:59] the resurrection
[2:21:02] and i never realized that back in those
[2:21:05] days
[2:21:06] the romans had a law
[2:21:08] if you fell asleep while you were doing
[2:21:11] your job
[2:21:12] it was a death sentence
[2:21:14] so when they ask those soldiers
[2:21:17] go live
[2:21:19] they are telling them i'm going to give
[2:21:20] you money
[2:21:21] to lie before the governor but if this
[2:21:23] comes to the governor's ears we'll lie
[2:21:25] to him
[2:21:26] and cover for you
[2:21:28] so that if you testify that you went to
[2:21:31] sleep you're a dead man
[2:21:34] but we'll secure you
[2:21:37] that money wasn't worth their lives
[2:21:41] they were crazy to take that money and i
[2:21:42] also thought you know
[2:21:44] brother mccues
[2:21:46] back in arizona he was the one his
[2:21:48] mother had the issue
[2:21:51] when you see that picture with brother
[2:21:53] brown and brother joseph had their hands
[2:21:55] up
[2:21:56] and they were standing on a rock
[2:21:58] brother branham told brother mccues
[2:22:00] that's the same rock that followed the
[2:22:02] children of israel
[2:22:04] so that rock was way over in arizona
[2:22:06] at the time the prophet got the message
