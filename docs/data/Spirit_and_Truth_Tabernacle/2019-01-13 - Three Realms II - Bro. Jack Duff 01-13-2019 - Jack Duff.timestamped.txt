[1:00:36] we do as outreach for the church and how
[1:00:38] everybody can be involved in helping
[1:00:40] make an impact in our community
[1:00:43] a man so praise Allah we thank God for
[1:00:45] all things let's go back to Joe - we
[1:00:47] started a path on Friday night and I
[1:00:50] felt that it would a man be
[1:00:53] good for us to kind of keep going down
[1:00:55] this path it must give a disclaimer amen
[1:00:59] as we get started here we are moving
[1:01:03] into some things that pertain to this
[1:01:07] day scriptures that pertain to the day
[1:01:09] that you live a man and now so we're
[1:01:12] gonna be kind of talking about some
[1:01:14] things and it might be very what I would
[1:01:16] call message centric a man but God sent
[1:01:20] a message in your day to get you
[1:01:22] prepared for a rapture and and I need to
[1:01:24] tell you about some of those things
[1:01:25] right Amen God sent a message and no
[1:01:28] one's day to get them ready to get in a
[1:01:29] boat all they had to do is listen and
[1:01:31] get in the boat right hey man God God
[1:01:34] always sends messages to his people so
[1:01:36] this gonna be very message centric my
[1:01:39] intention is to point you in the
[1:01:41] direction of the Lord Jesus Christ but
[1:01:43] understanding what God is doing in your
[1:01:45] day is extremely important
[1:01:48] a man we're not just going to church
[1:01:50] just to go to church not just going
[1:01:52] through the motions but we got a purpose
[1:01:55] we're trying to make a rapture a man and
[1:01:58] we need the food the necessary food to
[1:02:01] prepare us for rapture a man so we're
[1:02:05] gonna be talking a lot about that and
[1:02:07] I'm gonna do my best just to kind of
[1:02:08] take my time and let the Holy Spirit
[1:02:10] just have his way I'm not gonna rush
[1:02:11] we'll get as much as we can and then
[1:02:13] we'll go from there
[1:02:14] but here in Joelle to a man I'm reading
[1:02:17] two scriptures today Joelle - in
[1:02:19] Revelation 10 Joelle 2 verse 28 says and
[1:02:22] it shall come to pass afterward that I
[1:02:25] will pour out my spirit upon all flesh
[1:02:28] and your sons and your daughters shall
[1:02:31] prophesy your old men shall dream dreams
[1:02:34] your young men shall see visions a man
[1:02:40] and also upon the servants and upon the
[1:02:43] hand mates in those days will I pour out
[1:02:46] my spirit amen let's just slip over here
[1:02:50] to Revelation 10 a man and just verse 7
[1:02:55] - most of you this is a very familiar
[1:02:57] scripture Amen but it says this this is
[1:03:01] a scripture that was actually manifested
[1:03:03] in this time by God it
[1:03:06] we look at revelation and most churches
[1:03:08] run from it but this is something that
[1:03:10] actually happened during this time I'm
[1:03:12] talking about over the last you know
[1:03:14] within the last hundred years this was
[1:03:17] manifested a man a man says but in the
[1:03:20] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:03:22] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[1:03:25] of God should be finished as he hath
[1:03:27] declared to his servants the prophets
[1:03:30] let's pray amen over the Word of God
[1:03:32] father we thank you for the ability to
[1:03:35] read scripture but we trust that the
[1:03:38] Holy Spirit now will bring clarity to
[1:03:40] the things that we are reading help us
[1:03:42] Lord to enter in and receive from heaven
[1:03:44] even at this time we take control over
[1:03:47] every spirit that is against your spirit
[1:03:49] and father we ask that you would just be
[1:03:52] free to move in this place everyone that
[1:03:54] has come here today
[1:03:56] Lord you ordained to be here so father
[1:03:59] may you speak from heaven and may we all
[1:04:02] draw closer to you through the words
[1:04:03] that we hear today said in Jesus name we
[1:04:05] pray amen amen god bless you you can be
[1:04:08] seated so good to see brother Dave back
[1:04:10] there Amen haven't seen him in a while
[1:04:12] god bless you my precious brother good
[1:04:13] to see you a man we were talking on
[1:04:17] Friday night a man on the subject of the
[1:04:21] three realms three realms amen and we're
[1:04:25] going to continue in that vein today
[1:04:29] we're in that channel if I could put it
[1:04:30] that way just start me off with this
[1:04:32] quote from the message the Ark amen
[1:04:35] three realms is what we're talking about
[1:04:37] here today amen
[1:04:40] here this first quote just kind of says
[1:04:43] there's three elements that people live
[1:04:46] in and I want to call it realms right
[1:04:48] but three elements that people live in
[1:04:51] first is the humanistic second is divine
[1:04:55] revelation and third is vision amen
[1:05:00] these are the three realms that we're
[1:05:01] talking about humanistic divine
[1:05:04] revelation and vision now this like in
[1:05:07] prayer when you pray for anyone in
[1:05:09] humanistic we say well I hope you'll get
[1:05:12] well Oh hallelujah amen
[1:05:17] it's a difference when it's divine
[1:05:20] revelation but but and humanistic is
[1:05:24] always a prayer of just hope I hope you
[1:05:27] get well you know I'm just going back to
[1:05:30] the testimony I heard on yesterday amen
[1:05:32] one of the sisters was sharing you know
[1:05:35] just break that down just a little bit
[1:05:36] for me it's just sharing with me how you
[1:05:39] know I want to say this when God puts
[1:05:42] you in contact with people amen it's for
[1:05:45] a purpose right people that he bring
[1:05:47] into your life is for a purpose it's not
[1:05:48] just you know just wasted time or
[1:05:52] anything like that but but this system
[1:05:54] was telling me how you know she was
[1:05:55] working on the job and she used to have
[1:05:57] to take telephone calls from this person
[1:05:59] all the way out in Oklahoma and here
[1:06:01] she's standing in Florida taking
[1:06:02] telephone calls from Oklahoman and they
[1:06:05] the lady would be sending a fax and they
[1:06:07] have to stand there and guard a fax
[1:06:08] machine so they would you know talk on
[1:06:10] the phone before the fax was coming and
[1:06:11] and over time they built a relationship
[1:06:13] and the lady beginning to talk a man
[1:06:16] about you know just just some of the
[1:06:18] things she was going through and one of
[1:06:19] the things was her daughter couldn't
[1:06:21] have children because she had no room
[1:06:24] hallelujah is she had in a womb and so
[1:06:27] the sister just began to just kind of
[1:06:29] you know just take that and and just you
[1:06:31] know it's just kind of you know I mean
[1:06:32] being a you know if that lady would have
[1:06:34] told that to a man it might not have had
[1:06:37] the same impact that I had by her
[1:06:39] telling it to a woman right because a
[1:06:42] woman understand how to you know she
[1:06:44] desires to have this child she wants to
[1:06:45] have this child so she sympathizes with
[1:06:47] and she beginning to pray for the young
[1:06:49] lady and and and one day you know just
[1:06:52] standing there the Holy Spirit said tell
[1:06:55] that mother that her daughter will have
[1:06:58] a child when you get on the phone tell
[1:07:02] her she will have a child
[1:07:04] this says or pretty much right she will
[1:07:06] have a child now you got to understand
[1:07:09] this this girl ain't got no wound how
[1:07:11] she gonna have a child right so so but
[1:07:13] divine revelation came down it managed
[1:07:16] divine revelation say she will have a
[1:07:18] child right so so you know kind of got
[1:07:21] around and danced around a little bit
[1:07:23] and then you know when the when the
[1:07:25] mother got on the phone you know she
[1:07:27] just kind of didn't say too much then
[1:07:28] she say you know I just got to tell you
[1:07:30] you know you
[1:07:30] have that baby she's a UH she's got no
[1:07:35] woman why she gotta have a baby
[1:07:36] I say I'm just letting you know like the
[1:07:38] Lord told me to tell you that you look
[1:07:39] your daughter I don't have that baby and
[1:07:41] now she say okay alright we'll just see
[1:07:43] well time goes by and she never said
[1:07:47] another word to the lady who should take
[1:07:49] them faxes and never said another word
[1:07:50] but one day that lady didn't have a fax
[1:07:53] but she had a telephone call to me one
[1:07:58] day she got on the phone say I ain't got
[1:07:59] no fax today but I got some news to
[1:08:01] share with you my daughter is pregnant
[1:08:05] the world without the womb she's
[1:08:07] pregnant
[1:08:08] her final revelation dropped down into
[1:08:12] that situation and said tell your
[1:08:14] daughter now remember this goes back to
[1:08:16] last Sunday's message because Joshua
[1:08:19] when he stopped the son a man it was not
[1:08:23] simply because the Israelites was in
[1:08:25] battle the Israelites were helping the
[1:08:27] Gibeonites
[1:08:28] it's the Gibeonites that was in trouble
[1:08:30] right but God can anoint you to help
[1:08:33] your brother
[1:08:34] God can anoint you to help your sister
[1:08:37] hallelujah somebody here she's standing
[1:08:41] in Florida the other person in Oklahoma
[1:08:43] Maine even never met the person but God
[1:08:45] connected them hallelujah God don't make
[1:08:50] no mistake God don't make no mistake
[1:08:53] come on somebody
[1:08:55] amen amen IIIi believe God is own time
[1:09:01] God and he's a a man he's a God that has
[1:09:04] has he has structured or what he's doing
[1:09:07] he every time something happened he no
[1:09:09] one's getting ready to happen come on
[1:09:11] somebody a man but divine revelation can
[1:09:16] strike like that this quote goes on the
[1:09:19] city says like in a prayer when you pray
[1:09:22] for anyone in humanistic we say well I
[1:09:24] hope you'll get we'll see I'm hoping I'm
[1:09:27] believing with you trying to use all the
[1:09:29] faith I can that's human right you say
[1:09:32] second is divine revelation when
[1:09:35] something's revealed to you you just
[1:09:38] know in your heart it's going to happen
[1:09:40] yet there's nothing but just the
[1:09:43] revelation
[1:09:44] no sensation no emotion all you got is
[1:09:48] the revelation and can I tell you
[1:09:50] something that's all you need a man all
[1:09:53] you need is a revelation as Jesus says
[1:09:55] upon this upon this rock rock of
[1:09:58] Revelation I'll build my church and the
[1:10:00] gates of hell can't prevail against it
[1:10:02] hallelujah say I said nothing but just a
[1:10:06] revelation and third is a vision course
[1:10:09] that's thus saith the Lord that's
[1:10:11] perfect and positive now you know I
[1:10:14] share with you all last week how you
[1:10:16] know the Prophet got a man a divine
[1:10:18] revelation just to read in the scripture
[1:10:19] about about Joseph and it felt so in
[1:10:22] love with the character in the scripture
[1:10:23] that God told say I'm gonna give you
[1:10:24] Joseph and you know in due time he had a
[1:10:27] Sarah but a man we know that was all
[1:10:29] God's plan but but and even though
[1:10:31] people's criticized said I thought maybe
[1:10:33] you meant Josephine not Joseph no no God
[1:10:35] told me at Joseph and do time God gave
[1:10:38] him exactly what he said through divine
[1:10:41] revelation can I tell you something you
[1:10:43] all are sitting in this church today
[1:10:45] based on divine revelation i'ma just
[1:10:49] share quick testimony I'm gonna go to
[1:10:51] find it but you know I remember years
[1:10:54] before this church got started I was
[1:10:57] just reading my Bible and I was going
[1:10:59] through John 15 and as I was reading
[1:11:02] John 15 it was just talking about how
[1:11:04] you know a tree in order to be more
[1:11:07] fruitful a tree have to be cut a man and
[1:11:11] I say say even though the tree might be
[1:11:13] bringing forth fruit in order to be more
[1:11:14] fruitful it has to be cut it has to be
[1:11:17] proved right and I was like okay Lord
[1:11:21] watch what you try to tell me out of
[1:11:23] scripture like okay you're speaking
[1:11:24] something to me and I just I was like
[1:11:26] okay I'm holding on to that and I went
[1:11:29] to a convention maybe about a month
[1:11:30] after that and the first preacher come
[1:11:32] out of the gate
[1:11:34] turn to John 15 and he preached a sermon
[1:11:37] fruit much fruit more fruit I say Oh God
[1:11:41] say I know you speak him to me if nobody
[1:11:43] else is here to hear this this one is
[1:11:45] for me and as he preached that sermon i
[1:11:48] sat there a man listening to them preach
[1:11:50] and I said okay Lord I'm yielding I
[1:11:52] understand what you I mean you you're
[1:11:54] saying something here to me on yielding
[1:11:55] what do you want me to call
[1:11:57] name of the church now what he was
[1:11:59] telling me is that I was in a fruitful
[1:12:01] church but in order for me to bring
[1:12:03] forth more fruit I had to go through a
[1:12:05] purging hallelujah amen I know he's
[1:12:08] telling the truth because I'm looking at
[1:12:10] you today
[1:12:11] hey man and this is more fruit
[1:12:14] hallelujah
[1:12:15] can I tell you something amen sometime
[1:12:19] when God do that is because your
[1:12:20] ministry will will reach people that the
[1:12:23] other minister will never reach God got
[1:12:26] purpose for everything
[1:12:27] hallelujah some folk will grow better
[1:12:30] underneath your ministry they will
[1:12:32] underneath another ministry it's nothing
[1:12:35] wrong with you it's a very fruitful
[1:12:36] ministry but God want to bring forth
[1:12:39] more fruit that's all a man I hope you
[1:12:43] understand what I'm saying
[1:12:44] I'm sending away not to put nobody down
[1:12:47] I'm lifting everybody up huh God using
[1:12:51] everybody for his glory come on somebody
[1:12:55] but I said then that media and say Lord
[1:12:57] what do you want me to do with this he
[1:12:58] said I say what do you want the name of
[1:13:00] church be say spirit and truth
[1:13:01] Tabernacle after I read John 15 after I
[1:13:05] heard that Minister preached that's when
[1:13:06] God gave me spiritual tabernac now I had
[1:13:08] to wait on that I couldn't just go start
[1:13:11] immediately in strife feelings of
[1:13:12] spiritual time and I had to wait and it
[1:13:14] took about two years before I even told
[1:13:17] anybody before I even told my wife what
[1:13:19] God has said to me it took me about two
[1:13:21] years and you know we had about two
[1:13:23] years later she and I had this
[1:13:24] conversation in the car and and we knew
[1:13:27] God was transitioning us and you know
[1:13:29] and and and she said well what the name
[1:13:31] of the church gonna be I say Spirit of
[1:13:32] Truth type of that cuz you say well how
[1:13:33] you said why you said so fast like that
[1:13:35] I say because God did this and God did
[1:13:37] this and God I say old she say oh okay
[1:13:40] so when I knew that you know oh come on
[1:13:42] you got to have a wife that's gonna
[1:13:44] support you
[1:13:47] you ain't really got a ministry if your
[1:13:49] wife ain't supporting you
[1:13:51] somebody save me right but but but when
[1:13:57] God just beginning to do a third than I
[1:13:58] knew that we could do this thing right
[1:14:00] so but but the way that I got that in
[1:14:02] the way we got here is because God
[1:14:04] dropped divine revelation down and
[1:14:07] that's all I stood on I had no vision I
[1:14:10] had no emotion I had no feeling I had to
[1:14:13] find revelation and I stood on that
[1:14:15] thank God for the fruit of it so
[1:14:18] sometimes you're gonna have divine
[1:14:19] revelation you have to stand on that and
[1:14:22] it like I said on Wednesday night when a
[1:14:25] person a man has has faith or revelation
[1:14:28] because faith is a revelation when a
[1:14:30] person has faith and they can see things
[1:14:33] what they're doing amen they cannot they
[1:14:35] see things that other people can't see
[1:14:37] because the others are blind to it now
[1:14:40] in the natural if you have a person
[1:14:43] that's blind you don't fuss settle you
[1:14:46] don't you don't yell and scream say
[1:14:49] can't you see that watch where you walk
[1:14:52] him can't you see that bit the car
[1:14:55] almost hit you no you don't do that with
[1:14:58] a blind person but you're patient with
[1:15:00] them hold on to my arm walk with me and
[1:15:06] I'm gonna make sure you get through this
[1:15:07] thing safely huh it's the same thing
[1:15:11] spiritually you got to be patient with
[1:15:14] full and wait for God to bring them to
[1:15:16] the level where you ask can I taste them
[1:15:21] even if God show you something in a
[1:15:22] dream even if God show you something on
[1:15:25] vision you have to learn to be patient
[1:15:27] with others
[1:15:29] hallelujah somebody I got something to
[1:15:32] say here come on now I'm gonna say this
[1:15:35] let me see where I got this time limit I
[1:15:38] want to say it just right if a gift is
[1:15:42] not handled right
[1:15:44] it could destroy a family or even a
[1:15:48] church can I say it again if a gift is
[1:15:53] not handled right
[1:15:55] destroying family or even a church
[1:15:58] give me questions and answers part to
[1:16:05] see oftentimes dreams may be symbolic
[1:16:09] vision symbolic so you have to pray over
[1:16:12] interpretations amen and I want to say
[1:16:16] this before I get started we're not
[1:16:17] afraid to accept what God has promised
[1:16:19] us 1/4 - Joel - we simply want to align
[1:16:22] it with the word now watch this this
[1:16:26] goes along with that stop that statement
[1:16:28] gifts I'm not if they not handle right
[1:16:29] they could destroy families even
[1:16:30] churches look at this question brother
[1:16:32] branham what shall we do some something
[1:16:34] has settled over me that I cannot
[1:16:36] breakthrough last fall I dream I was
[1:16:39] lost in white saying it was getting dark
[1:16:41] I couldn't find it I couldn't find my
[1:16:44] way this dream has stayed with me since
[1:16:46] last fall now I am as one groping in
[1:16:50] darkness my son Irvin and wife are
[1:16:53] included in my dream now they are also
[1:16:56] in darkness we are in a desperate we are
[1:16:59] in desperation I believe God was show
[1:17:01] you what it is
[1:17:02] what is our hearts what is in our hearts
[1:17:04] now all right if we if we're wrong or
[1:17:07] sitting sitting places tell us we want
[1:17:09] to be right look at the answer now I
[1:17:12] don't know the lady but I just feel if
[1:17:15] you're here lady that here's your
[1:17:17] trouble you have let something happen to
[1:17:20] you that's made you nervous because
[1:17:22] being in white sands represents purity
[1:17:26] and righteous zcc I tell your dreams and
[1:17:29] things are sometimes symbolic you got to
[1:17:31] pray over
[1:17:31] amen it says being a white sand a man
[1:17:35] represents purity and righteous you're
[1:17:37] just letting Satan put one over on you
[1:17:39] your dream prove that there's nothing
[1:17:42] wrong come on now since you're only
[1:17:45] nervous and by doing this because you
[1:17:48] nervous by doing this and thinking this
[1:17:51] you're making the rest of your family
[1:17:53] nervous stop doing it I like that and
[1:18:00] then because she nervous she making a
[1:18:02] family nervous start doing it that's why
[1:18:05] I say a gift can destroy a family
[1:18:09] if it's not handled right right say
[1:18:11] start doing it
[1:18:12] hey man he says I'll say it's a claim
[1:18:15] your god-given rights your dream proves
[1:18:17] by the interpretation that you aren't
[1:18:19] white saying everything is all right
[1:18:21] it's you yourself nervous and you let
[1:18:24] one member of the family get nervous it
[1:18:26] goes to the next member and the next
[1:18:28] member and the first thing you're all
[1:18:29] fussing and going on and one member of
[1:18:31] the family gets kind of upset about
[1:18:33] something it upsets the other and the
[1:18:35] other and the other and the first thing
[1:18:37] you know the whole family is upset it's
[1:18:38] Satan since then if one member the
[1:18:43] family rejoices let the rest of them
[1:18:45] rejoice with it so everyone of the
[1:18:47] family try to do that try each one of
[1:18:50] you children to help you Papa a mama
[1:18:53] mama you papa
[1:18:55] Papa you try to help the children don't
[1:18:57] let that gloomy unbelieving spirits get
[1:19:02] around you can I say it again doubt your
[1:19:05] doubts
[1:19:06] don't let that gloomy unbelieving spirit
[1:19:10] take over your family a man you are
[1:19:13] Christians you are born of the Spirit of
[1:19:16] God you are the salt of the earth
[1:19:18] you have god-given rights and the Bible
[1:19:21] said if there be any plates if there be
[1:19:24] any virtue think on these things
[1:19:27] see put the dream back in the scripture
[1:19:29] think on these things don't think about
[1:19:32] the wrong thing and sister I think
[1:19:35] that's your trouble sister dear so all
[1:19:38] she needed just a little correction on a
[1:19:40] dream to understand what the what the
[1:19:42] purity what the white white represents
[1:19:44] she's drowning and white saying what
[1:19:46] means if she wasn't she was pure right
[1:19:48] and man it was pure was righteous in a
[1:19:50] devil trichter with our own drink
[1:19:52] hallelujah that's why you need people
[1:19:54] that can actually interpret these things
[1:19:56] glory to God and I'm gonna tell you if
[1:19:58] God has given people the ability to
[1:20:00] dream he's also giving somebody else
[1:20:01] two-bit liability to the turf it alright
[1:20:05] can we go a little further hey man I
[1:20:08] want to show you something here in
[1:20:09] Scripture we've been talking about Mary
[1:20:16] for a couple weeks and I want to pick up
[1:20:18] Matthew amen one 18 through 25 we read
[1:20:22] this
[1:20:23] few weeks ago I want to come back to it
[1:20:24] again a man Matthew one Oh God
[1:20:31] these three realms that God deals with
[1:20:33] people in humanistic aim and divine
[1:20:36] revelation and visions sometimes a
[1:20:40] vision can also of be a dream because if
[1:20:42] the dream is correctly interpreted it's
[1:20:44] a vision a man if the dream is correctly
[1:20:47] interpreted now every dream is not from
[1:20:49] God hallelujah okay and no matter how
[1:20:53] spiritual it is every dream is not from
[1:20:55] God
[1:20:55] sometime the devil wants to anoint you
[1:20:57] in that room as well right the devil
[1:20:59] will attack you why are you sleeping and
[1:21:02] y'all know it's the truth
[1:21:03] hey man that subconscious that you're in
[1:21:06] the devil would love to try to get into
[1:21:07] that you got that sometime that's why
[1:21:09] it's good just pray over your mind
[1:21:10] before you go to bed and man that way
[1:21:12] the devil don't look just don't run
[1:21:14] roughshod all over and have y'all up at
[1:21:16] night you're scared to go to sleep
[1:21:17] praise God if you having bad dreams put
[1:21:20] on a tape y'all didn't hear me
[1:21:24] if you having bad dreams put on a tape
[1:21:27] I'm talk about the word not music the
[1:21:30] word let the word play inside your
[1:21:33] bedroom and yet watch the atmosphere
[1:21:36] change in that bedroom you'll be
[1:21:38] surprised there are certain things that
[1:21:40] even go into your subconscious while
[1:21:42] you're sleeping
[1:21:44] hallelujah glory to God you'd be
[1:21:47] wondering the Prophet said this
[1:21:48] surprised how do I know that it went
[1:21:50] into your subconscious while you were
[1:21:51] sleeping get the word in there you want
[1:21:54] if you want the devil's I put the word
[1:21:56] in hallelujah glory to God I never see
[1:22:01] no devil overcome the word he always
[1:22:03] running from the word come on charge
[1:22:07] alright let's go on a little further
[1:22:09] here I'm in Matthew 1 verse 18 I want to
[1:22:12] just read this rather quickly but I want
[1:22:16] to just kind of substantiate these
[1:22:17] things a man this is this is another
[1:22:20] realm that God was using a man at this
[1:22:22] time look at this it says now the birth
[1:22:23] of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as
[1:22:26] his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph
[1:22:28] before they came together she was found
[1:22:29] with child of the Holy Ghost then Joseph
[1:22:32] her husband being a just man and not
[1:22:34] willing to make her a public example was
[1:22:37] to put her weight privily a man but
[1:22:40] while he thought on these things behold
[1:22:41] angel Lord appeared unto Him in a dream
[1:22:44] the angel Lord came to him how in a
[1:22:48] dream so the angel or could come to you
[1:22:50] how in a dream saying Joseph thou son of
[1:22:54] David fear not to take unto thee Mary
[1:22:56] thy wife for that which is conceived in
[1:22:59] her is of the Holy Ghost now and she
[1:23:02] shall bring forth a son and thou shalt
[1:23:05] call his name Jesus for he shall save
[1:23:07] his people from their sins now for me I
[1:23:10] believe that angels still talking in the
[1:23:13] next few verses I believe it's not an
[1:23:16] insertion by you know by the one that
[1:23:21] wrote this by Matthew I think this is
[1:23:23] the angel still talking look at this he
[1:23:25] says now all things was done that it
[1:23:27] might be fulfilled all what things she
[1:23:29] was pregnant she was pregnant by the
[1:23:31] Holy Spirit that it might be fulfilled
[1:23:33] which was spoken of the Lord by the
[1:23:34] Prophet saying behold a virgin shall be
[1:23:37] with child and shall bring forth the son
[1:23:40] and they shall call his name Emmanuel
[1:23:42] which being interpreted is God with us
[1:23:45] now I believe that angel took Joseph
[1:23:48] back to the scripture and by taking him
[1:23:50] back to the scripture with the dream
[1:23:52] hallelujah that could settle him when
[1:23:55] you can get the scripture involved with
[1:23:57] what God showed you then that should
[1:23:59] settle you come on somebody because now
[1:24:02] look at the next verse then Joseph being
[1:24:05] raised from sleep so after that angel
[1:24:07] shared amen what was going on how it was
[1:24:10] connected to prophecy then Joseph raised
[1:24:14] amen from sleep did as the angel of the
[1:24:17] Lord and bidding him and took him to him
[1:24:20] his wife let me just kind of just drop a
[1:24:24] couple of things in here and you can get
[1:24:27] this quote lined up for me God as its
[1:24:28] own interpreter I want you to understand
[1:24:31] a man something about that oh my god let
[1:24:36] me read this quote first before I say
[1:24:37] that a man look at this God is not his
[1:24:40] own interpreter the Prophet makes a
[1:24:41] statement says did you ever notice how
[1:24:43] God dealt with Joseph there in a
[1:24:46] secondary way so the dream was actually
[1:24:48] the secondary way this isn't
[1:24:50] the reason being is because if people
[1:24:53] don't get they don't get control over
[1:24:55] their gifts then they would try to use
[1:24:57] dreams to dominate the church the church
[1:25:01] saying with me they when you will use
[1:25:03] your gift to try to dominate and
[1:25:05] influence how things work in the church
[1:25:08] huh
[1:25:09] but that's not the way to supposed to go
[1:25:11] the Word of God is the thing that should
[1:25:14] dominate the church
[1:25:17] the dream is secondary all right we are
[1:25:22] we together now did you ever notice our
[1:25:25] God dealt with Joseph day on a secondary
[1:25:27] way in the way of a dream
[1:25:29] we know there's dreams we believe in
[1:25:31] dreams I believe in dreams God always
[1:25:35] dealt with people in dreams but dreams
[1:25:38] is secondarily see it could be right or
[1:25:41] wrong unless it's interpreted but he
[1:25:44] didn't need an interpretation it was God
[1:25:46] Himself speaking directly to Joseph
[1:25:48] because there wasn't a prophet and a
[1:25:50] lanthanum based interpret there had
[1:25:52] there hadn't had a plate of there hadn't
[1:25:55] had a prophet for 400 years so the next
[1:25:57] best that God cared for the welfare of
[1:26:01] his own son will speak to Joseph through
[1:26:04] a dream and without interpretation said
[1:26:06] the woman is right the holy thing which
[1:26:09] is conceived in her is the son of God
[1:26:11] didn't need any interpretation listen
[1:26:14] God does his own interpreting doctor -
[1:26:17] honest sincere hearts can I say that
[1:26:19] again God does his own interpreting -
[1:26:24] honest sincere hearts men and women that
[1:26:28] look upon this thing that's mysterious
[1:26:31] if you're honest and sincere and we
[1:26:33] believe God has a way of interpreting it
[1:26:37] to you if you stay honest you stay
[1:26:40] sincere God has a way of interpreting
[1:26:43] that thing to you oh my god gonna
[1:26:46] interpret something to somebody today
[1:26:49] let me go on a little further God gonna
[1:26:52] interpret something to somebody today
[1:26:53] and if you just send searing your weight
[1:26:56] on the Lord he has a way of showing you
[1:26:58] can I go a little further a man God has
[1:27:02] a way of interpreting G first
[1:27:04] find out if it's promised if Joseph had
[1:27:07] just went back and got away from the
[1:27:09] traditions and went back to the Bible
[1:27:11] and found out
[1:27:12] Isaiah said she was gonna do that and
[1:27:15] the things that were spoke of in his
[1:27:17] birth and all about it it was spoke by
[1:27:19] the scriptures by the holy prophets as
[1:27:21] Peter said and no man has a right to put
[1:27:23] any private interpretation to that it's
[1:27:25] just exactly what God said would take
[1:27:26] place
[1:27:27] he was the manifestation of the Word of
[1:27:29] God promised for that day God said it so
[1:27:31] there was that settled it now I want to
[1:27:33] say something here
[1:27:34] we know that dreams are a secondary way
[1:27:38] for God to get his reveal will to his
[1:27:41] people will to his people
[1:27:55] dreams are secondary way the primary way
[1:27:58] is through his word or through the
[1:27:59] sinning of a prophet the Prophet comes
[1:28:02] and it gives you the interpretation of
[1:28:03] the word that's not that's God's primary
[1:28:05] weight hallelujah now let me go in a
[1:28:07] little further we know that dreams are
[1:28:09] secondary wait for God to get his
[1:28:10] revealed will to the people but when God
[1:28:15] brought Christ to the earth during his
[1:28:16] first coming
[1:28:17] he used dreams and supernatural
[1:28:20] experiences to confirm his first coming
[1:28:23] the secondary way but God used a dream
[1:28:27] to confirm his first coming that's why
[1:28:29] he went to Joseph in a dream it was to
[1:28:32] confirm his first coming that a virgin
[1:28:34] would conceive
[1:28:36] hallelujah are you with me because I
[1:28:38] want I gotta say something here if God
[1:28:40] use dreams to confirm his first coming
[1:28:44] is it possible that God can also use
[1:28:48] dreams a secondary method of speaking to
[1:28:50] people can't God use dreams to confirm
[1:28:53] his second coming see now we just turned
[1:28:55] a corner now we just turned a corner
[1:28:58] y'all still with me I lose nobody at
[1:29:01] dinner because I'm not trying to lose
[1:29:03] you but I want you to stay with me
[1:29:05] because I'm bringing you I'm bringing
[1:29:07] you correct
[1:29:08] Amen I got you I mean everybody know
[1:29:11] about Joseph and Mary hallelujah
[1:29:14] everybody can read about that and we
[1:29:16] believe that
[1:29:17] but can I bring you father can I take
[1:29:20] you to Revelation 10 and show you that
[1:29:23] before that was manifested God whose
[1:29:26] dreams to confirm that all right Church
[1:29:32] hallelujah hallelujah what's the purpose
[1:29:35] of Dreams the purpose and never neck
[1:29:38] Nebuchadnezzar's day a man when he
[1:29:41] called for Daniel come forth and
[1:29:44] interpreted the dream because he was
[1:29:45] getting ready kill everybody
[1:29:47] he said don't man and not a man had a
[1:29:49] dream and he knew the dream was
[1:29:51] important but he forgot it he had no
[1:29:54] idea what he dreamed he liked now and I
[1:29:56] know it's important he said now you
[1:29:58] magicians y'all supposed to have gifts
[1:30:00] one of y'all better come tell me what I
[1:30:01] dream they say now this has never been
[1:30:03] heard of that a king tells the people to
[1:30:06] tell him what date you want us to tell
[1:30:09] you what your dream no you tell us what
[1:30:12] you dreamed them we'll give you an
[1:30:13] interpretation he say if you don't if
[1:30:15] you don't come up with what I dream I'm
[1:30:17] a kid I'm a hack everybody in pieces the
[1:30:22] man was serious
[1:30:23] he knew the dream was important the
[1:30:25] dream was actually a dream for the
[1:30:27] entire the dream was a dream for this
[1:30:30] day Nebuchadnezzar had it way back then
[1:30:33] but he was looking into a future day
[1:30:35] come on somebody sometime the dream is
[1:30:38] to help you see something that's coming
[1:30:40] in the future and God is using that to
[1:30:45] warn you about something
[1:30:46] oh my god my god hallelujah let me go a
[1:30:51] little further he say he say he say he's
[1:30:53] saying now y'all ready y'all better
[1:30:54] y'all better give me the interpretation
[1:30:55] my dream you've not only given
[1:30:57] interpretation tell me what I dream and
[1:31:00] give me the interpretation he wanted
[1:31:02] both so when they went to took the e-tag
[1:31:04] out to kill everybody and see this is
[1:31:06] why it's good to have relationships
[1:31:08] because Dania had a relationship and he
[1:31:11] kind of stopped the guy that was coming
[1:31:12] saying I'm going to just give me a
[1:31:13] little time out here why I was so why
[1:31:15] are you being so hasty so he said look
[1:31:19] now you can kill all them but not not me
[1:31:21] and my fellows over here these three
[1:31:24] Hebrew boys leave us alone you can take
[1:31:26] care of wrestling but but but but leave
[1:31:27] us alone give me a little time
[1:31:29] when he three now dad you say he say he
[1:31:32] got to the king and he taught to say
[1:31:34] just give me a little time my teeth and
[1:31:36] the Bible say Daniel begin to pray and
[1:31:38] seek Lord he act the extra you know this
[1:31:40] is why I even also acts the Hebrew for
[1:31:41] that's why I said on Friday night if you
[1:31:43] need something from God that's why we
[1:31:45] come and pray and then God can use a
[1:31:48] gift in order to give you the answer to
[1:31:51] what you need come on somebody
[1:31:54] amen the brought the Bible tells us that
[1:31:57] these things are going to happen in the
[1:31:58] last days so don't be afraid of them
[1:32:00] just get them lined up according
[1:32:02] description so so Danny and the Hebrew
[1:32:04] boys beginning to pray and then the
[1:32:06] Bible say in a night vision God brought
[1:32:09] that thing to Daniel and with Daniel
[1:32:11] heard he began to rejoice he beginning
[1:32:13] to thank God he went to the keys and I
[1:32:15] need to tell you what your dream and he
[1:32:17] told the King everything that he dream
[1:32:18] and he said yeah that's exactly what I
[1:32:20] dreamed and I it came back to him he
[1:32:22] said brother branham even said he can't
[1:32:25] give the interpretation unless God gives
[1:32:27] the vision of what you dream if you went
[1:32:31] to the Prophet with a dream he could not
[1:32:33] give you the interpretation of the dream
[1:32:34] until God gave him the vision of what
[1:32:37] you dream and there were many times that
[1:32:41] the Prophet would tell the people you
[1:32:42] forgot this part of your dream and you
[1:32:44] forgot that part of your dream and you
[1:32:46] forgot that part and this happened and
[1:32:48] that happened
[1:32:48] so yes that's exactly right because God
[1:32:50] was showing him the vision of what was
[1:32:53] in the dream it was God show Daniel the
[1:32:59] vision of what never kanessa hat in his
[1:33:01] dream then Nebuchadnezzar could get free
[1:33:04] he gave him a dream and then he also
[1:33:07] gave them the interpretation hallelujah
[1:33:10] let me go a little further here oh my
[1:33:13] god remember there's three elements
[1:33:15] three realms amen that people live in
[1:33:17] humanistic divine revelation and visions
[1:33:20] Oh glory now what's the purpose of the
[1:33:23] dream of Neven and Nebuchadnezzar's day
[1:33:25] they needed clarity hallelujah can I
[1:33:28] also say this a man and Joseph before he
[1:33:31] married Mary he needed direction anybody
[1:33:35] here need direction today God can use a
[1:33:37] dream to give you some direction
[1:33:41] I only had one person neither direction
[1:33:43] only one person in this church need
[1:33:45] direction all of us need some direction
[1:33:50] all of us lose okay which way should I
[1:33:53] you know you always operate like that
[1:33:57] right but sometimes God could give the
[1:33:59] dream to somebody that you wouldn't even
[1:34:01] expect him oh my god and here they come
[1:34:05] to you well you know the Lord said
[1:34:06] something like this to me and I don't
[1:34:08] know why he said that I and can I tell
[1:34:10] you something if God give you a dream
[1:34:11] just give the people what God gave you
[1:34:13] don't be fishing Oh y'all leg y'all they
[1:34:17] hurt me don't be fishing because God
[1:34:21] gave you gave you something now you
[1:34:22] fishing you know the Lord Gaming it's
[1:34:25] know what you think about that no they
[1:34:29] what God told you to see that what you
[1:34:32] think about that part is you keep that
[1:34:36] to yourself
[1:34:37] just give the people what God gave you
[1:34:39] and get out of the way you want to know
[1:34:41] why because it's not about you it's
[1:34:43] about God I'm going a little further I'm
[1:34:51] going further
[1:34:51] so to dream a man and Joseph date was
[1:34:55] for direction right and in
[1:34:58] Nebuchadnezzar's day he needed clarity
[1:35:00] and Joseph day he needed direction as to
[1:35:01] whether he should marry her a lot right
[1:35:04] so so the dream gave him it gave him
[1:35:06] direction it settled his heart it did
[1:35:09] all these things right the other thing
[1:35:11] hallelujah in the case of Joseph in the
[1:35:13] book of Genesis the dream that he had
[1:35:17] showed him future status the dream that
[1:35:24] Joseph had in Genesis of his of the 12
[1:35:27] stars coming to bow before him and all
[1:35:29] of this it was showing him future status
[1:35:32] now it did not show him what he was
[1:35:34] gonna have to go through to get to
[1:35:35] future status let the dream did show
[1:35:40] future status and if God ever shows you
[1:35:43] future status you can hold to that
[1:35:46] knowing that somehow someway God gonna
[1:35:49] bring you to it
[1:35:51] come on church make sure it's lining up
[1:35:56] with the Lord oh now come on now cause
[1:35:59] every dream ain't from God if it's
[1:36:00] against the word it's not from God but
[1:36:03] but the dream can show your future
[1:36:04] status now I want to tell you something
[1:36:06] amen oh my god
[1:36:09] God used after Joseph went through
[1:36:12] everything he went through God use the
[1:36:16] interpretation of dreams to actually
[1:36:19] bring him into future status he used the
[1:36:24] dream to show him future status and then
[1:36:26] when when when Pharaoh had a dream it he
[1:36:28] could interpret Lee when he got Joseph
[1:36:30] out of the prison God used the
[1:36:32] interpretation of trees to bring him to
[1:36:35] future status God can use a dream come
[1:36:42] on church all right all right let me go
[1:36:45] a little further here you know I let me
[1:36:47] just give you a quick testimony had a
[1:36:49] brother right here in our church that
[1:36:50] had a dream of future status and he had
[1:36:54] a dream about working for a particular
[1:36:55] company and he uh he didn't never
[1:36:58] thought about even applying applying to
[1:37:00] work for this company God gave him a
[1:37:02] dream didn't gave him second dreamed in
[1:37:04] a game of third dream and why would he
[1:37:05] give three dreams it's to confirm it
[1:37:07] right three dreams that he was going to
[1:37:09] work at this company now he went and uh
[1:37:11] he just kind of mentioned it to a
[1:37:13] brother because he knew brother in the
[1:37:15] church that was working that's like
[1:37:16] brother I wouldn't mind joining your
[1:37:17] team he's like you joining my team I
[1:37:19] never even thought that you would I
[1:37:21] would never even considered you to join

[1:37:24] said yeah when I went mine join your
[1:37:26] team you said well go ahead and apply
[1:37:28] for it then so he applied and you got to
[1:37:31] understand the job that he was applying
[1:37:32] for he had no credentials he would I say
[1:37:37] none was not qualified in the least bit
[1:37:41] for applying for this job
[1:37:43] so when HR got a hold of it no just a
[1:37:49] quick no it's not gonna even take us
[1:37:51] time to to call the committee together
[1:37:56] no this is not gonna happen
[1:37:59] send it right on back to email no thank
[1:38:02] you for applying but no
[1:38:04] but the brother was holding on to the
[1:38:07] drinks and see when I'm telling you when
[1:38:13] God speak through these means this goes
[1:38:16] beyond know this is why you want to get
[1:38:22] yourself in position which I can speak
[1:38:24] to you you got to stop watching north
[1:38:27] since that night on TV how you give your
[1:38:29] mind ready when you go to sleep with
[1:38:31] that nonsense get your spirit prepared
[1:38:35] for God to speak to you brother they sit
[1:38:46] back and said know that you know I want
[1:38:48] qualified they say they did he said okay
[1:38:50] hold on I'll call you back I'll call you
[1:38:53] tomorrow so he went to the the boss and
[1:38:55] went to the HR department say I want to
[1:38:57] interview that guy the guy ain't got no
[1:38:59] qualifications yes I want to interview
[1:39:02] him my god my god
[1:39:05] and and I'm gonna tell you you know
[1:39:07] sometimes it's good it was a book I read
[1:39:10] you know some years ago but sometimes
[1:39:11] when you're when you're looking for if I
[1:39:13] got any pop anybody here hiring some
[1:39:16] time are you looking to hire people hire
[1:39:17] people that might be outside of the
[1:39:19] skill set that you're looking for like
[1:39:22] this one job they needed somebody that
[1:39:24] was real good with filing they went to
[1:39:25] the library and got a librarian right
[1:39:29] because they had the skill set that they
[1:39:31] were looking for even though they might
[1:39:32] do it in the library no I want you to
[1:39:34] brain that that knowledge of that amen
[1:39:36] that no skills over into this position
[1:39:39] thank outside the box so here this
[1:39:44] brother he say say I'm gonna talk to him
[1:39:46] and I'm gonna get them the car you he
[1:39:48] went talk to him they say okay he said
[1:39:50] but the interview HR said at the
[1:39:52] interview same people that told him no
[1:39:53] and if he would have stayed with that
[1:39:54] rather than with the dream he would have
[1:39:56] never got a job you know where he got
[1:39:58] the job with no skills because God gave
[1:40:04] him the dream
[1:40:06] oh my god now I'm not talk about Martin
[1:40:08] Luther King type stuff here that's not
[1:40:10] one I'm tougher I'm talking about God
[1:40:12] speaking to you through a dream all
[1:40:16] through a vision because these are three
[1:40:19] rails that God uses two of the three
[1:40:23] humanistic is another room like that
[1:40:25] humans live in but God can use that to
[1:40:27] get his divine will reveal to people now
[1:40:30] can I go a little further a vision don't
[1:40:32] heal you I was you know looking at and
[1:40:36] I'm coming I'm coming here in a little
[1:40:38] second a man but a vision if God gives a
[1:40:40] vision of visions not what heals the
[1:40:42] person I was looking going back and
[1:40:44] looking at congressman Upshaw testimony
[1:40:46] and he was he walked into the meeting
[1:40:49] and the prophet said I see a man the
[1:40:53] young boy he failed and he heard itself
[1:40:55] and now he's in a wheelchair and you
[1:40:58] know but I see him he's coming into
[1:40:59] manhood and he's becoming a great man
[1:41:01] and now he's becoming a greater man and
[1:41:03] now he's becoming a greater man so I see
[1:41:06] this man but I don't know his name I
[1:41:08] don't know who he is that's all the
[1:41:09] knows this man and he's in a wheelchair
[1:41:10] so uh the people raised up real quick
[1:41:14] say sometimes I'm gonna tell you
[1:41:15] something God don't have to call your
[1:41:17] name he just got to call your condition
[1:41:22] and the people that was around say say
[1:41:24] that not that's that's uh that's
[1:41:25] congressman Upshaw that you're talking
[1:41:27] about and he's here in a meeting so he
[1:41:29] say he want to talk to you brother
[1:41:30] branham and say he say he say okay you
[1:41:32] say son how did you know that happened
[1:41:35] to me he said I'm just I'm just telling
[1:41:37] you what the vision said he say you know
[1:41:39] I've been holding on for 60 years that
[1:41:41] God went healed me do you think God will
[1:41:43] heal me he said I don't know the vision
[1:41:45] and show me that it just showed me this
[1:41:46] and he said you hold it on just keep
[1:41:48] holding on God to do something for you
[1:41:49] so he say he said okay I'm just holding
[1:41:52] on so he uh put the mic down and brother
[1:41:55] Brandon begin to pray for others Danny
[1:41:56] saw another vision of this young lady
[1:41:57] young girl that was operated on and the
[1:42:00] doctor did this and the doctor did that
[1:42:01] that's why you got to pray before you go
[1:42:03] underneath the doctor right because the
[1:42:06] doctor did this is the doctor did that
[1:42:07] and and and and the young lady lost
[1:42:10] something and then some ability to do
[1:42:12] something so the mother was there and
[1:42:13] brother branham just kind of calling out
[1:42:15] and and the mother said that's my
[1:42:16] daughter she didn't know the name but
[1:42:18] knew the condition that's
[1:42:19] my daughter that happened huh will she
[1:42:21] be here he said I can't tell you that
[1:42:23] all I saw was a condition so he went on
[1:42:27] in the prayer lines and also he saw a
[1:42:29] little girl standing there with a little
[1:42:30] baby walking down the street a little
[1:42:32] baby doll walking down the street he
[1:42:33] said mama
[1:42:34] auntie thus saith the Lord your daughter
[1:42:37] is healed and he says she said she say
[1:42:40] she say parson when is she healed he
[1:42:43] said right now when the vision came it
[1:42:49] was right then oh my god I hope y'all
[1:42:52] get that see I mean a vision came the
[1:42:54] sister shared last week I'm expecting
[1:42:56] things right now you say you see so you
[1:43:05] say right now and the girl drop whatever
[1:43:07] she said mama look at me say that girl
[1:43:09] jumped up and began to run around that
[1:43:11] place say they had to get had to get
[1:43:13] some muscles over there settle them down
[1:43:15] so then after that happened in the
[1:43:18] vision popped about the about

[1:43:38] old and congressman Upshaw said well
[1:43:41] when will I woke he said right now put
[1:43:45] your sticks down and get up and start
[1:43:47] walking in the Congress congressman put
[1:43:52] them sticks underneath them and before
[1:43:54] he could get them all up he dropped them
[1:43:56] down they start walking at 86 years old
[1:43:58] the vision is the set the Lord and it
[1:44:01] it's positive because you know if God's
[1:44:14] prophet was here giving you a vision
[1:44:15] you'd be all over that but the Prophet
[1:44:19] not here but those gifts are still here
[1:44:22] and if somebody else came to you with
[1:44:25] the vision are you able to accept that
[1:44:28] are you gonna look at them and say well
[1:44:30] nice coming from you
[1:44:34] and if you doubt it you might miss it
[1:44:37] I accompanied y'all had a meet how many
[1:44:42] y'all need direction God is able to use
[1:44:45] things like this to give you direction
[1:44:48] just satisfy the need but you gotta be
[1:44:52] in a spot where you can receive it and
[1:44:54] let me also say this if you gotta give
[1:44:57] your life got to be an income in
[1:45:00] alignment with your gift I tell you how
[1:45:04] long you know we don't want we don't
[1:45:06] want a game time game time Christians
[1:45:12] you know what I mean they only show up
[1:45:14] at game time they're not at practice we
[1:45:18] want we want we want we want people
[1:45:21] that's gonna be a practice and also at
[1:45:23] game time then we can trust you we know
[1:45:26] what you're doing when you get on the
[1:45:27] court because we've done practice we
[1:45:30] know what to do when we get on the field
[1:45:32] because we don't practice I ain't
[1:45:34] running some different routes and you
[1:45:36] throwing interceptions come on somebody
[1:45:38] we can avoid that if we just come to
[1:45:41] practice so we're not just looking for
[1:45:50] gifts just to be going run running why
[1:45:53] we want it we want to in control what
[1:45:56] the Holy Ghost come on somebody
[1:46:00] all right I'm going further I'm going
[1:46:02] further oh Jesus Jesus Jesus Amen all
[1:46:08] right now let me read a little statement
[1:46:11] here out of the sermon is this the sign
[1:46:13] of the answer I'm going to paragraph 237
[1:46:16] in this and we're turning this corner
[1:46:19] and trying to just I'll bring it home
[1:46:21] somewhere here but I need to get to six
[1:46:23] visions I mean six dreams in and one
[1:46:26] vision a man I want to get to this and I
[1:46:29] said God might answer somebody's I
[1:46:30] believe God gonna answer somebody's
[1:46:32] question even through this glory to God
[1:46:35] this is a this is a statement I need to
[1:46:37] read though I believe that the seventh
[1:46:41] angel of revelation 10 is
[1:46:46] church age messenger revelation 3:14 now
[1:46:49] this now this is what the Prophet is
[1:46:50] saying this is his quote he says I
[1:46:54] believe that the seventh angel
[1:46:56] revelation team is the set of angel or
[1:46:59] 7th aged messenger of revelation 3:14
[1:47:01] now I just read rebel I mean a
[1:47:03] revelation 10 7 in the days of the voice
[1:47:05] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[1:47:07] to sound all the mysteries of God will
[1:47:08] be finished I just read that but now if
[1:47:10] you want to know what angels he talking
[1:47:12] about you got to go back to revelation
[1:47:14] 3:14 hallelujah amen it's the seventh
[1:47:17] angel to the seventh church age which is
[1:47:19] leav SIA amen
[1:47:21] the first angel to the first church age
[1:47:23] happened to be Paul Ephesus but
[1:47:27] throughout the years to the Gentile
[1:47:28] Church ages a man not just to the
[1:47:31] Gentile church but to the Gentile Church
[1:47:34] ages from the time of Jesus coming to
[1:47:36] Earth and and them and the Jews rejected
[1:47:38] him to paul picking up and saying we
[1:47:40] turn to the Gentiles God has been
[1:47:43] dealing with Gentile people hallelujah
[1:47:46] glory to God amen his attention has been
[1:47:49] on the Gentile people all the way up
[1:47:52] until this time and amen at the time of
[1:47:54] the tribulation it goes back to the Jews
[1:47:56] come on now he's already started working
[1:47:58] a little bit with them
[1:48:00] amen but but when we will look at that
[1:48:03] there's what he's saying here revelation
[1:48:05] 10 amen he says I believe that the
[1:48:07] seventh thing to relation 10 is the
[1:48:09] seventh church age messenger of
[1:48:11] revelation 3:14 remember now let me read
[1:48:14] look where I can read now that this was
[1:48:17] a seventh angel now he goes on to say
[1:48:19] this song in Revelation Tim seven but in
[1:48:22] the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:48:24] angel he says when he shall begin to
[1:48:26] sound the mystery of God should be
[1:48:28] finished as he had declared to his
[1:48:29] servants the prophets that's revelation
[1:48:30] ten seven he says now notice this was an
[1:48:33] angel and it's the age of the seventh
[1:48:35] church age because it says here the
[1:48:38] seventh angel of the seven churches
[1:48:40] found that I found that if you want to
[1:48:42] see who that where that answer is
[1:48:44] revelation 3:14 the angel to the
[1:48:46] Laodicean church and that's the age in
[1:48:49] which we live in in right now this is
[1:48:51] the last age before Jesus will come amen
[1:48:54] this is the lair to see in church age
[1:48:56] Laodicea actually means people's rights
[1:48:58] and if we're not live
[1:48:59] age where everybody got rights not just
[1:49:02] people animals trees I never had never
[1:49:11] been sued by a tree but because somebody
[1:49:17] hugging the tree right hey man they
[1:49:22] upset and they want to bring a lawsuit
[1:49:23] in children can take their parents to
[1:49:26] court and the courts will listen to it
[1:49:29] when God told me in my Bible spare the
[1:49:32] rod spoil the child I told my girls me
[1:49:37] was coming out if I'm gonna go to jail
[1:49:39] it's gonna be for something good I got
[1:49:42] to be able to go to jail and smile i'ma
[1:49:49] give you something to call them for now
[1:49:53] glory to God but this is the age of
[1:49:57] people's rights so what was being spoken
[1:50:00] of a man in in the book of Revelation
[1:50:02] was symbolic to something that was going
[1:50:05] to happen in a future day do you realize
[1:50:07] John when he wrote revelation was caught
[1:50:09] up in a vision he was calling for a
[1:50:14] vision and he was writing from a vision
[1:50:17] so if John amen caught it by vision it
[1:50:21] would take a prophet to interpret the
[1:50:23] vision that's why in the days of the
[1:50:26] voice of the fourth angel then the
[1:50:30] mistress will be finished yeah me you
[1:50:31] don't have to stumble around and try to
[1:50:32] figure this out in law just listen to
[1:50:34] the voice of the seventh angel
[1:50:37] can I go further he made a statement if
[1:50:44] the vision was spiritual it must be
[1:50:46] interpreted by the scripture then he
[1:50:48] says or a continuation of the same
[1:50:51] scripture so the grip is if the vision
[1:50:54] is scriptural it must be interpreted by
[1:50:56] the scripture or a continuation of the
[1:51:00] same scripture now I'm not just I'm
[1:51:02] gonna take time and just drop this in
[1:51:03] here and then I'm going to do six dreams
[1:51:05] I'm watching my time because I know how
[1:51:06] y'all
[1:51:11] we read let's let's read revelation 10 7
[1:51:14] again if the vision was scriptural it
[1:51:19] must be interpreted by the scripture see
[1:51:21] when Joseph a man was told by the angel
[1:51:24] to fear not to take Mary as his wife
[1:51:26] that they were fulfilling Scripture with
[1:51:29] this Joseph could be settled in spirit
[1:51:31] once he knew scripture was actually at
[1:51:34] play can I tell you something when
[1:51:38] you're looking for a church you're
[1:51:42] looking for somewhere to just settle
[1:51:43] once you know scriptures come into play
[1:51:45] that's what settles you can I tell you
[1:51:49] that it's not it's not the feeling it's
[1:51:51] not the emotion I mean we if y'all
[1:51:55] wanted to shout there was a time in the
[1:51:57] service that you could have shouted when
[1:51:59] they hit that song of the early could
[1:52:01] well you could have broke out one but
[1:52:05] now we talk about settling you we talk
[1:52:10] about you talk we talk about you finding
[1:52:12] a man a place to settle you know you
[1:52:14] know the the doves could not find a
[1:52:17] place to settle when the flood came the
[1:52:20] crows could eat up everything they
[1:52:24] didn't come back to the art man they had
[1:52:26] a smorgasbord idea hallelujah
[1:52:29] they were going from church to church
[1:52:30] that's eaten anything and everything but
[1:52:35] the dog said I ain't built like that I
[1:52:38] can't eat that nonsense huh I need to
[1:52:45] get back to the ark i'ma just bring a
[1:52:48] little leaf back but the rest of the
[1:52:51] stuff I can't even touch they built
[1:52:56] different can I tell you the reason you
[1:52:59] sitting here today because you built
[1:53:01] different
[1:53:04] hallelujah you Eagles that was in a
[1:53:07] chicken coop trying to learn how to fly
[1:53:12] didn't even know what fly was all about
[1:53:15] but when your mama came screaming over
[1:53:19] what's your mama no word of God the
[1:53:22] truth that your mama gave birth to you
[1:53:24] the Word of God gave birth to you mama
[1:53:29] came screaming over the word say die set
[1:53:31] your wings this way and flying up here
[1:53:33] lead them chickens alone and when you
[1:53:38] heard from mama you start flying and
[1:53:40] your wings ain't settled down yet
[1:53:43] come on somebody glory to cut what I'm
[1:53:47] talking about you you flying into
[1:53:50] revelation ten seven you flying into
[1:53:53] revelation 3:14 you're planning to
[1:53:55] Malachi 4 this goes beyond Daniel the
[1:54:01] Lions tears come on somebody hallelujah
[1:54:06] is right here in the Bible ain't saying
[1:54:09] no not the Bible right here
[1:54:11] can I read a little bit glory to God I
[1:54:15] said a vision if it was scriptural it
[1:54:18] must be interpreted by the scripture or
[1:54:20] a continuation of the same scripture now
[1:54:24] revelation 10 7 just told us that but
[1:54:27] our days of the voice of the seventh
[1:54:28] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[1:54:29] mystery of God should be finished as if
[1:54:32] the clear to serve as the prophets that
[1:54:33] was being continued from revelation 3:14
[1:54:36] give me that one see that was a
[1:54:39] continuation of the same scripture
[1:54:42] revelation 3:14 let's pull that one up
[1:54:47] and then after after you get that one an
[1:54:48] extra gonna be Malachi 4 5 & 6
[1:54:50] revelation 3:14 says and unto the Angel
[1:54:53] of the Church of the lettuces and I see
[1:54:55] most people looking for a angel from
[1:54:57] heaven this was a human oh my Paul
[1:55:01] actually says that he was an angel to
[1:55:03] the church that's what the Bible's
[1:55:05] saying right so so so this ABC 7 angels
[1:55:08] were seven men messengers that God used
[1:55:11] their ministries what the purpose was is
[1:55:14] to bring the church back to his word
[1:55:16] that's that's all God used these
[1:55:18] ministries to bring the church back to
[1:55:20] his word and he used them supernaturally
[1:55:23] onto the Ange of the Church of the
[1:55:24] Laodiceans write these things saith the
[1:55:26] Amen the faithful the true witness the
[1:55:28] beginning of the creation of God so
[1:55:29] revelation 3:14 was continued in
[1:55:33] revelation to him 7 but God didn't just
[1:55:36] speak of it in revelation 3:14
[1:55:38] in Revelation 1070 also spoke of it in
[1:55:40] the Old Testament
[1:55:42] Malachi 4 or 5 and 6 the whole I will
[1:55:46] send you now notice that notice that you
[1:55:49] is very personal not behold I was sinned
[1:55:54] then that's why I still got friends in
[1:55:57] the old church that I left when when I
[1:56:02] read this scripture I thought God was
[1:56:04] talking to me all of us did see it so
[1:56:08] I'm just patient with them y'all still
[1:56:11] with me well I will seem you Eli to the
[1:56:16] Prophet can I say something
[1:56:18] not Elijah the prophetess Elijah the
[1:56:22] prophet now notice when Elijah comes how
[1:56:25] many know we live in an in town before
[1:56:28] the coming of the Great and dreadful day
[1:56:31] of the Lord
[1:56:31] that's when Elijah comes it's a
[1:56:34] continuation of the scripture but go on
[1:56:37] to the next verse and he shall turn the
[1:56:39] heart of the father's to the children
[1:56:41] and the heart of the children to their
[1:56:43] fathers lest I come and smite the earth
[1:56:44] with the cursed last two scriptures in
[1:56:46] the Old Testament Old Testament closes
[1:56:48] with this now we all know most people
[1:56:51] clearly see that John the Baptist
[1:56:53] fulfill the first part of that scripture
[1:56:55] pull that scripture right back up for me
[1:56:56] again he fulfill the first part where it
[1:56:58] says then he should turn the heart of
[1:56:59] the father's to the children John the
[1:57:00] Bible plainly says in Luke that John the
[1:57:03] Baptist did that but what we're looking
[1:57:05] for is the other part of the scripted be
[1:57:07] fulfilled and that was fulfilled in the
[1:57:09] Ministry of William Miriam Branham who
[1:57:12] was born in 1906 1909 his souza revival
[1:57:17] I mean a sudra Street happened to 1906
[1:57:19] he was born in 1909 died in 1965 already
[1:57:23] been fulfilled God sent a prophet I
[1:57:27] wasn't even born before he came
[1:57:29] but his ministry
[1:57:30] influencing me thank God for - I'm glad
[1:57:34] to be walking underneath this truth can
[1:57:36] [Music]
[1:57:38] we go a little further now you know
[1:57:41] before a man he could get into what his
[1:57:45] real ministry was because his real
[1:57:47] ministry wasn't just a signs wonders and
[1:57:48] miracles the real ministry was
[1:57:51] revelation 10 7 can we read it again
[1:57:56] the real ministry was revelation 10 and
[1:57:59] 7 that was the real purpose of God
[1:58:02] sitting her turn the hearts of the
[1:58:03] children back to the faithful Files
[1:58:04] which meant tear on hearts back to the
[1:58:06] word look we only do things in this
[1:58:08] church that's based on the word if it
[1:58:10] ain't in the word we ain't doing it I
[1:58:13] don't see praise dancing in the word I
[1:58:16] don't see it well we gotta you know let
[1:58:20] him minister minister hi only time I saw
[1:58:24] dancing like that was with Herodias and
[1:58:29] I prophet ended up losing his head over
[1:58:31] something like that
[1:58:32] praise God and you let that keep flowing
[1:58:35] on church a lot of other brothers gonna
[1:58:37] lose their heads you might as well say a
[1:58:42] man huh
[1:58:46] lust fear just running all over the
[1:58:48] church we want to keep that down we
[1:58:52] don't want we look and you know y'all
[1:58:54] just watch these brother they just
[1:58:55] tojust minister
[1:59:03] [Applause]
[1:59:06] hey brother I'm looking at your eyes my
[1:59:08] friend
[1:59:09] that ain't no ministry its ministering
[1:59:12] to the wrong spirit inside of you see
[1:59:15] can i i'ma just be so bold and say this
[1:59:17] it used to be you kit you only watch
[1:59:20] stuff like that on TV
[1:59:21] nine o'clock after nine o'clock you know
[1:59:24] what I'm saying it had to be on HBO or
[1:59:27] Showtime now you can go to church and
[1:59:35] see this nonsense not here
[1:59:40] praise God a man in anyhow I don't even
[1:59:51] know what what happened if you try to
[1:59:53] get up here in praise there's I don't
[1:59:55] even know what what happened praise God
[1:59:59] alright hey man not here I'm trying to
[2:00:03] go further in this y'all I really am I
[2:00:05] don't even know where oh ok revelation
[2:00:07] 10 7 is his ministry this his ministry
[2:00:11] revelation but in the days of the voice
[2:00:13] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[2:00:15] to sound the mystery of God should be
[2:00:17] finished as you have to clear to service
[2:00:19] the profits now now there's many
[2:00:21] mysteries that we're talking about here
[2:00:22] that the scripture is talking about and
[2:00:24] I don't have time to go through all of
[2:00:26] them but I can tell you one mystery is
[2:00:27] what what really happened in the Garden
[2:00:29] of Eden
[2:00:30] did they really eat an apple or an
[2:00:33] apricot like some say did they eat a
[2:00:35] fruit and this lady recognized she was
[2:00:37] naked not only recognized she was naked
[2:00:39] but also ate a fruit and had a child
[2:00:41] from it come on we know people don't eat
[2:00:44] no fruit and have children we know how
[2:00:47] people have children so that's if there
[2:00:49] is it wants something so supernatural
[2:00:51] boy this this fruit ain't even here no
[2:00:53] more it's still here
[2:00:56] it's still here cuz they still having
[2:00:58] children the same way right amen so what
[2:01:02] happened was adultery in the Garden of
[2:01:04] Eden and that's why the Bible even says
[2:01:06] to plate one place it says King was of
[2:01:09] that wicked one
[2:01:11] that's not Adam Adam was not wicked Adam
[2:01:13] was God's Son who willfully went into
[2:01:16] sin huh
[2:01:18] in order to not he couldn't redeem his
[2:01:20] wife but in order to be identified with
[2:01:22] his wife only Christ can redeem fallen
[2:01:26] man can't redeem right
[2:01:27] so Adam identified himself with his wife
[2:01:30] just like Jesus identified himself with
[2:01:31] us
[2:01:32] by leaving his throne of glory coming
[2:01:33] down the earth and dying for us right
[2:01:35] but but but but we know it was it was
[2:01:37] adultery she yes she got a man for the
[2:01:40] Lord do you realize that any woman that
[2:01:43] gives birth to a child naturally God had
[2:01:46] to be a part of that you know it'd take
[2:01:48] a miracle for her body to do what it
[2:01:50] does to bring forth that baby because if
[2:01:54] the body don't do it then they have to
[2:01:55] do some cutting come on somebody right
[2:01:58] so it'd take a miracle so whether you
[2:02:00] saved and not save it still take a
[2:02:02] miracle for God to touch your body to
[2:02:03] bring forth that time that's why you can
[2:02:05] use terms like I have got this child
[2:02:08] from the Lord she had twins Cain and
[2:02:14] Abel right Abel was from Adam Cain was
[2:02:18] from the devil the devil got into the
[2:02:22] serpent that's why in Genesis 3 you see
[2:02:25] when God called everybody to give out
[2:02:27] the punishments he'd come for no
[2:02:30] alligator he didn't call for a
[2:02:32] chimpanzee then call for a gorilla God
[2:02:38] called for Adam he called for Eve and he
[2:02:41] called for that serpent and the serpent
[2:02:43] the punishment for the serpent y'all
[2:02:46] remember y'all Bob the punishment for
[2:02:48] the serpents that the serpent had to go
[2:02:50] on his belly that tells us something
[2:02:52] that means the serpent stood on two feet
[2:02:55] at one time and the serpent was the
[2:02:58] closest thing to a man then man himself
[2:03:02] now you know what I didn't know that
[2:03:04] when I was at my Baptist Church I found
[2:03:06] that out when I found out God sent
[2:03:08] and reveal these things that was one
[2:03:11] mystery another mystery is how you how
[2:03:13] you really supposed to be about to us
[2:03:14] cuz we got church this baptized the name
[2:03:16] of the Father Son and Holy Ghost Jesus I
[2:03:18] said yeah I know and now you tellin me
[2:03:21] ten days later the same man that was
[2:03:23] walking with Jesus sleeping with Jesus
[2:03:25] talking with Jesus same man that got
[2:03:26] keys to the kingdom got it wrong when
[2:03:28] ten days ladies say baptized in the name
[2:03:30] of Lord Jesus Christ he didn't have it
[2:03:33] wrong
[2:03:35] he had the revelation right he didn't
[2:03:39] have a role C in it but it is people are
[2:03:41] lost to Revelation but but Peter say the
[2:03:44] name of the Father the name of the son
[2:03:47] the name of the Holy Ghost is Lord Jesus
[2:03:51] Christ how you gon pray and bind Devils
[2:03:54] in his name but can't get baptized in
[2:03:57] his name you don't you don't be praying
[2:04:01] that we know with you something happened
[2:04:03] on top.i something real go down you
[2:04:06] ain't said no in the name of the Father
[2:04:08] Son and Holy Angels
[2:04:15] like our Toria that plane was going down
[2:04:18] there fella spoke in two languages in
[2:04:21] the name of Jesus and ain't nobody Zeus
[2:04:30] make sure you get this but that truth
[2:04:34] had to be restored to the church
[2:04:37] otherwise we'll be walking around and
[2:04:39] darkness stumbling around still trying
[2:04:42] to find my way but God brought this
[2:04:43] truth back I'm trying to get somewhere
[2:04:46] there are so many other truths is I mean
[2:04:49] is it one God mm three gods no it's one
[2:04:52] God it was God the Father God the Son
[2:04:55] God the Holy Spirit but all those are
[2:04:57] just titles or offices of the same God
[2:05:00] in Old Testament he was God the Father
[2:05:03] the God above us in the New Testament a
[2:05:07] man Jesus Christ walked with the
[2:05:08] disciples he may email and many well got
[2:05:10] with us that was God with us it's the
[2:05:12] same guy all he doing was changing his
[2:05:14] mass it's the same God Alleluia and then
[2:05:19] in this day since Jesus is not
[2:05:21] physically walking with us he sent his
[2:05:23] spirit and not ask the same God dwelling
[2:05:26] in us not three gods one God but we
[2:05:32] don't got this all mixed up not
[2:05:33] Christianity look like it's pagan these
[2:05:40] are mysteries that had to be restored
[2:05:42] and and see brother Branham taught those
[2:05:43] truths there's a lot of healing
[2:05:46] campaigns porno but people teaching
[2:05:48] truth that was different his ministry
[2:05:52] was an administration after after a man
[2:05:56] all these I mean the scripture said in
[2:05:58] Revelation 10 7 there it says but in the
[2:06:01] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[2:06:02] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[2:06:04] of God should be finished all those
[2:06:05] truths were already finished as you have
[2:06:07] to clear to servants the prophets now
[2:06:09] let me let me also say only a prophet
[2:06:11] can give you truth theologians can't
[2:06:15] only a prophet can give you truth that's
[2:06:17] the way God speaks that was his primary
[2:06:19] way of getting his words as people is
[2:06:21] through a prophet
[2:06:22] alright here's what I'm trying to go so
[2:06:27] before he actually came to Revelation 10
[2:06:29] salmon and the manifestation of that
[2:06:32] scripture in his ministry he was
[2:06:34] continuing for Malachi 4 continuing from
[2:06:37] revelation 3 and coming all the way into
[2:06:40] revelation 10 7 and
[2:06:42] now God wants to do something with him
[2:06:44] sorry and I didn't read all this but it
[2:06:46] was the seven thunders other than their
[2:06:48] voices that was revelation one through
[2:06:50] I'm revelation 10 verse 1 through 7 it's
[2:06:53] talking about the seven thunders uttered
[2:06:54] voices which was the revelation of the
[2:06:57] seven seals that the Prophet brought us
[2:06:59] nobody else could bring that revelation
[2:07:02] so God used the Prophet to bring that
[2:07:05] revelation to his people and that's what
[2:07:07] settles to church all the revelations
[2:07:09] that are contained in the seven seals so
[2:07:11] it was a literal revealing of revelation
[2:07:15] five and six messages that God would
[2:07:18] give him but before he could give him
[2:07:20] these messages he had to prepare him to
[2:07:22] go a particular place now I told y'all
[2:07:25] Friday
[2:07:26] brother Branham when a vision come he
[2:07:29] couldn't he couldn't put people in
[2:07:30] certain places to make the vision happen
[2:07:32] if the vision say this person sitting
[2:07:35] here this person sitting here and then
[2:07:37] you're gonna pray for mundane gun that
[2:07:39] they had to be exactly according to the
[2:07:41] vision one time we went to pray for that
[2:07:43] boy and it wasn't according to the
[2:07:45] vision the boy almost died he had to
[2:07:47] wait for everything to get in place
[2:07:48] before the vision could be fulfilled now
[2:07:50] I want to tell you something that was
[2:07:52] training that was training getting him
[2:07:58] ready for revelation 10 oh that was all
[2:08:05] training to get him ready because he
[2:08:07] could not go West to get the seals until
[2:08:10] everything was in place
[2:08:11] and God you sent six dreams and one
[2:08:16] vision to get him out there to the west
[2:08:18] all I can do is give you the six dreams
[2:08:20] right now I'm trying my best to get out
[2:08:22] of here kid I'm a killer so just just
[2:08:24] stay with me and let me let me give you
[2:08:25] this let me give this six dreams this is
[2:08:29] all out of the message services just a
[2:08:30] time first dream brother Jackson had a
[2:08:37] dream in February of 1961 about the top
[2:08:40] of the rock they said brother Branham
[2:08:42] was interpreting the mysterious writing
[2:08:45] on the stones that was in the rock it
[2:08:47] says the Prophet picked up like a
[2:08:49] crowbar and ripped the top of the rock
[2:08:52] off and told the people light had never
[2:08:55] shined on this before look on this and
[2:08:59] the people began to scatter after the
[2:09:01] prophet went west
[2:09:03] he said only a few stayed to look on the
[2:09:06] stones that had never been interpreted
[2:09:08] so when brother Brennan was preaching
[2:09:09] the message services at the time he was
[2:09:11] actually trying to tell the people look
[2:09:12] I'm getting ready to leave my church not
[2:09:14] not leave Branum Tabernacle but I gotta
[2:09:16] go west because God got something else
[2:09:18] for my ministry he said but while I'm
[2:09:20] gonna stay with this night stay with
[2:09:22] this don't don't get up and leave just
[2:09:24] because I'm out west don't leave Church
[2:09:26] keep coming to the church when God gave
[2:09:29] me something I'm coming back but I got
[2:09:30] to go west according to a vision so this
[2:09:35] vision I mean this dream is connecting
[2:09:37] to the vision that God gave him and and
[2:09:38] brother Jackson saw this in a dream God
[2:09:41] use a second drew I mean six dreams
[2:09:42] here's a second brother Billy had a
[2:09:44] dream he says he dream he was going down
[2:09:47] a stream of water going west and C
[2:09:49] notice eyes everything is going west
[2:09:51] sending the Prophet west right he says
[2:09:53] you say he dream he was going down the
[2:09:55] stream of water going west it seems as
[2:09:57] if he was hunting for cattle he saw the
[2:09:59] Prophet rounding up cattle after he got
[2:10:02] them rounded up the Prophet was noticed
[2:10:04] motioning to brother bila to watch over
[2:10:06] the flock watch over the cat or I should
[2:10:09] say he says watch over them and he told
[2:10:11] him he told brother Billy in a dream
[2:10:13] keep the cattle on the right side in the
[2:10:18] dream a man he knew the cattle would
[2:10:20] want to get thought away of least
[2:10:22] resistance but they must stay on the
[2:10:25] right side of the river now what did
[2:10:27] that mean in the dream he said the
[2:10:29] cattle stand on the right side means
[2:10:31] stay out of denomination get him how to
[2:10:36] keep amount of denomination still the
[2:10:39] right side of the river amen and when
[2:10:42] brother Brent gave my brother Bill of
[2:10:43] the cattle he took off and went west so
[2:10:46] now so now you know here we see right
[2:10:47] here in this dream God speaking stay out
[2:10:49] of denomination how you're gonna go back
[2:10:50] in stay out I'm going to show you a
[2:10:55] courting dream how people go back in
[2:10:57] it's right here in these dreams
[2:11:01] the next 1/3 dream was brother Roy
[2:11:03] Robeson he had a dream that he and
[2:11:06] brother Brandon were rounding up cattle
[2:11:07] and all the brothers were eating eating
[2:11:10] dinner and brother brother soft been
[2:11:12] raised up while they were eating dinner
[2:11:13] and said he larger the great prophet
[2:11:15] will speak today at noon you know but
[2:11:18] unfortunately people heard that the
[2:11:20] people didn't wait around at noon to
[2:11:21] hear what the Prophet had to say they
[2:11:23] took off and did not hear he lied to the
[2:11:25] Prophet numbers number four this was
[2:11:30] sister Kalos the pastor's wife
[2:11:32] where actually she was the Deacons wife
[2:11:34] at this time but eventually became the
[2:11:36] pastor's wife so the college dream the
[2:11:39] dream of a wedding in the church and the
[2:11:42] bridegroom came in she said the
[2:11:43] bridegroom was perfect says but the
[2:11:46] bride under said but the bride didn't
[2:11:48] really look that good and it seems she
[2:11:50] said seem like a communion or a big
[2:11:53] dinner was being served in the church by
[2:11:55] brother Neville who was the pastor at
[2:11:56] that time and when she saw the big
[2:12:00] dinner Amen being served in the church
[2:12:02] sister Collins got upset but she said
[2:12:07] she said the food that was being served
[2:12:09] what's the best food that she'd ever
[2:12:11] seen but because it was being served in
[2:12:14] the church she thought that she should
[2:12:16] leave and go somewhere else she was
[2:12:18] upset and I just I'm talking about the
[2:12:20] dream and the dream she got upset about
[2:12:23] the food being served she influenced her
[2:12:25] husband to leave this is a dream
[2:12:30] she was influencing our husband to leave
[2:12:32] now notice what what happened now this
[2:12:34] is her dream now say if so so they were
[2:12:37] leaving to go elsewhere to eat since she
[2:12:39] was feeling it was wrong for them to
[2:12:41] have food in the sanctuary and this is
[2:12:43] this is a statement when they did when
[2:12:45] they was getting ready to leave her or
[2:12:47] go somewhere seat say the light on the
[2:12:49] right hand side went out this is the
[2:12:52] direct quote he said when when they did
[2:12:54] the light on the right hand side went
[2:12:56] out and now the prophets say man you
[2:12:57] didn't know what that is
[2:12:59] now set me up said we know what that is
[2:13:02] David get ready to leave because she was
[2:13:06] upset
[2:13:06] notice the wife was upset that they were
[2:13:08] serving food in her dream there she was
[2:13:11] upset that they were serving food in the
[2:13:12] church so she encouraged she encouraged
[2:13:14] husband and they would give it a leaf
[2:13:16] and as they were leaving the light went
[2:13:18] out
[2:13:21] now the prophets say you know what that
[2:13:23] is let me go a little further prophet
[2:13:28] said the bridegroom is perfect but the
[2:13:29] bride is not perfect yet it says and he
[2:13:33] said the food that they were eating with
[2:13:35] spiritual food and he also said we know
[2:13:37] what it was when the light went out in a
[2:13:39] dream I want to say this your light will
[2:13:42] go out if you stop eating the revealed
[2:13:44] word for your day so as they were
[2:13:50] leaving the reason the light was going
[2:13:51] out because they stopped feeding on the
[2:13:53] food for their day can I say it again
[2:13:57] your light will go out if you stop
[2:14:00] feeding on the word for your day can I
[2:14:03] go a little further to mow brother
[2:14:07] Parnell had a dream that he was coming
[2:14:09] to a meeting in a new church I like that
[2:14:13] brother Devin thank you you called it
[2:14:15] you called it glory to God a man he
[2:14:18] called it now all I need is one to agree
[2:14:21] with me if two of us touch and agree we
[2:14:23] can have anything because that's the
[2:14:25] same thing I said when I read it brother
[2:14:27] the brothers say he was coming to a
[2:14:29] meeting in a new church see he went
[2:14:31] somewhere else he went the same place I
[2:14:34] went to because I'm coming to a meeting
[2:14:37] in a new church brother partner had a
[2:14:43] dream that he was coming to a meeting a
[2:14:45] new church he was told and is is good
[2:14:47] it's gonna be good so he was told this
[2:14:49] is a closed meeting and it's only for
[2:14:51] the Deacons he felt stepped on the
[2:14:54] little and went out at the door but once
[2:14:56] he got outside he saw brother Branham
[2:14:58] standing there and looking westward see
[2:15:00] all these a lot of important westward
[2:15:02] westward this was before he could going
[2:15:03] fulfill revelation 2:7 he had to go out
[2:15:05] west that's where he met the seven
[2:15:07] angels 1963 come a man of seven angels
[2:15:11] and revealed to him told him to go back
[2:15:13] east and preach the stills before that
[2:15:15] happened he had to be out in the West he
[2:15:17] knew he had to be in Arizona God showed
[2:15:19] him that look at this he says says once
[2:15:22] he got outside he saw brother Branham
[2:15:23] standing there looking westward the
[2:15:25] Prophet told him not to feel stepped on
[2:15:28] I like this don't feel stepped on but I
[2:15:30] will direct you what you should do this
[2:15:33] is important the Prophet told him in the
[2:15:35] dream he would first come to Zipporah
[2:15:38] which meant - or stop he says but when
[2:15:42] you but but but pretty much but when you
[2:15:47] get to the pora don't stop there then he
[2:15:51] says his second stop will lead him to an
[2:15:53] old woman but don't stop there says
[2:15:57] brother Parnell go until you see my wife
[2:16:00] and when you find my wife
[2:16:02] stop there so in the dream brother
[2:16:06] Parnell looked back and he saw his own
[2:16:07] wife pumping water from a whale and he
[2:16:10] saw a minister trying to pull away from
[2:16:11] the pull away from the pump
[2:16:13] my brother Branham says Zipporah in this
[2:16:16] dream representatives of Zipporah and
[2:16:19] the old woman represented churches in
[2:16:22] the dream hallelujah look at this since
[2:16:24] no matter how old the organizations were
[2:16:28] they were not supposed to stop there but
[2:16:32] when you find the wife his wife which
[2:16:36] was the Church of God the church that
[2:16:39] God had called out in the last day stop
[2:16:41] there I said it because sometimes we've
[2:16:47] been looking and we've been we don't
[2:16:48] been a part of this organization that
[2:16:50] organization we don't stop that many of
[2:16:51] them and can't find what we're looking
[2:16:53] for but when you find Christ's wife his
[2:16:57] pride
[2:16:58] you can stop searching you ain't gotta
[2:17:04] wait for nobody putting a chair out for
[2:17:05] you to join the church you know where to
[2:17:08] stop stop there okay I want to say it
[2:17:12] again let the Holy Spirit let this one
[2:17:13] sink stop there stop searching stop
[2:17:18] there
[2:17:25] this is the last dream just a step he
[2:17:28] came to the prophets house she had a
[2:17:29] dream she said she came to the prophets
[2:17:31] house before prayer house for prayer
[2:17:33] before she went to surgery so it's a
[2:17:35] Stepford dream she was out west and she
[2:17:38] saw a really old man standing on top of
[2:17:40] the mountain looking eastward she
[2:17:41] couldn't understand who the old man was
[2:17:43] but she kept drawing closer and closer
[2:17:45] and let me tell you something you might
[2:17:47] not understand what I'm talking about
[2:17:48] just keep drawing closer closer it all
[2:17:52] makes sense
[2:17:53] she kept drawing closer and closer she
[2:17:55] then realized that the old man was
[2:17:57] Elijah the prophet she said I must see
[2:18:00] him and ran towards Elijah to speak to
[2:18:02] him and when she got his attention it
[2:18:04] was actually brother brother and brother
[2:18:07] Branham Acts assisted in a dream what do
[2:18:09] you want sister Steffi and seeing and so
[2:18:12] she woke up from the dream but the thing
[2:18:14] of a thing of it was is what she wanted
[2:18:16] was the prayer to be prayed for before
[2:18:19] she went into surgery and when she came
[2:18:22] to the prophets house before she went
[2:18:23] into surgery her dream was actually
[2:18:26] manifested but God gave her to dream
[2:18:28] about him being in the West to confirm
[2:18:30] some things to him before revelation 10
[2:18:33] 7 was fulfilled because he had to go
[2:18:35] west and then come back east to bring
[2:18:39] the seals
[2:18:46] brother branham had a vision and I'll
[2:18:48] close with this one here this vision
[2:18:53] went along with the dreams this is out
[2:18:54] of services just a time and this is
[2:18:56] going to be paragraph 114 I'll close
[2:18:57] with this year before revelation 10 7
[2:19:02] and I and I and I could just also go a
[2:19:05] little further to you amen that the
[2:19:08] fulfillment of Revelation 10 7 the
[2:19:11] fulfillment of Malachi 4 5 & 6 the
[2:19:14] fulfillment of revelation 3:14 all of
[2:19:16] those things are connected to our Lord's
[2:19:20] second coming
[2:19:20] all of those scriptures are connected to
[2:19:24] the second coming of the Lord just as
[2:19:27] john the baptist was sent to forerun the
[2:19:29] first coming God had another messenger
[2:19:31] in this day sent to forerun the second
[2:19:34] coming we're not here just quoting
[2:19:36] things just to be quoting things but God
[2:19:38] has a way of getting his word to his
[2:19:40] people before destruction strikes says
[2:19:46] one day coming down five years ago
[2:19:48] brother Norman from brother Norman's I
[2:19:50] was driving down the road he just had a
[2:19:52] meeting up there and the Lord God
[2:19:55] appeared to me in a vision I was sitting
[2:19:56] in front of my gate up up here at my
[2:19:58] house and it seemed to be bad weather
[2:20:00] many of you people will remember the
[2:20:02] vision as wrote in my book of visions I
[2:20:04] put them down so I'd be sure that I
[2:20:07] don't forget them and in this vision I
[2:20:10] saw there was something that had come
[2:20:12] through the lane and there were stones
[2:20:14] laying all over my yard and there was
[2:20:16] graders and scrapers up and down the
[2:20:18] lane and trees had been cut down and
[2:20:20] routed up and I started to turn in to
[2:20:23] the gate and it was all blocked off with
[2:20:25] stones I got out this is a vision now I
[2:20:28] got out to say to the man why this and
[2:20:30] he got very hostile shoved me backwards
[2:20:33] and said that's the way with you
[2:20:35] preachers I said I only asked you why
[2:20:38] did you do this you're coming over on my
[2:20:41] side of the street here why did you do
[2:20:43] this and he just almost slapped me and
[2:20:45] shoved me back and I thought I'm just
[2:20:49] gonna tell him that he doesn't know what
[2:20:51] he's talking about in the vision and a
[2:20:54] voice spoke and said don't do that
[2:20:56] you're a minister
[2:20:59] can I say something don't do that you're
[2:21:02] a Christian don't do that
[2:21:05] you're gonna destroy your testimony
[2:21:07] don't do that don't post that don't go
[2:21:12] there don't do that I can preach it just
[2:21:15] I can call it don't do that don't do
[2:21:27] that your Minister and I said very well
[2:21:29] and I turn around until my right sitting
[2:21:31] in front of the gate was an old Prairie
[2:21:33] schooner you know what a covered wagon
[2:21:37] now I told you dreams sometimes a
[2:21:40] symbolic the Prairie schooner actually
[2:21:43] represented his station wagon he owned
[2:21:46] the station wagon and so he at the after
[2:21:50] this event happened to his front yard
[2:21:51] they were getting ready to widen street
[2:21:53] come right down the lane he have to
[2:21:55] actually take his gate and move it it
[2:21:57] was it was a stone gate and you have to
[2:21:59] take it up and move it back a little bit
[2:22:01] so they can get the street in there and
[2:22:03] God has showed him when this comes to
[2:22:05] pass
[2:22:05] go west he says now turn he says says
[2:22:10] now turn around and to my right sitting
[2:22:12] in front of the gate was an old Prairie
[2:22:14] schooner you know what a covered wagon
[2:22:15] with horses hitched to it
[2:22:17] what's the horses representing
[2:22:19] horsepower in the car yeah y'all get
[2:22:22] that you know you know you know nay hum
[2:22:25] said he saw who uh carriages they call
[2:22:29] them horseless carriages in the city
[2:22:33] jostling in the street now that's how he
[2:22:35] that's how he described it he didn't
[2:22:38] know what to call it but we call them
[2:22:39] cars horseless carriages what they mean
[2:22:44] just in the streets accidents may harm
[2:22:48] saw at a profits order and start
[2:22:50] describing it oh my god hallelujah look
[2:22:55] at it he says in say the opposite the
[2:22:57] driver saw was my wife I look back in
[2:22:59] the back of my children was sitting back
[2:23:01] there I climbed up on the wagon I said
[2:23:04] to my wife honey
[2:23:04] I stood all I can stand and I picked up
[2:23:07] the lines and pulled the lead horse and
[2:23:10] started heading west
[2:23:12] and a voice said to me when this comes
[2:23:15] to pass then go westward
[2:23:18] now he had the other dreams that was
[2:23:20] also telling him go westward so he knew
[2:23:22] at the beginning of 1963 he had to go
[2:23:26] westward and he made some statements say
[2:23:28] if God don't speak to me while I'm out
[2:23:30] west and you know and in a short amount
[2:23:32] of time then I'm going further I'm going
[2:23:34] on up into Alaska
[2:23:35] he said God won't speak to him while I'm
[2:23:37] in Alaska then I'm going without food so
[2:23:40] it for a long time until God speak to me
[2:23:42] he knew he had to go west another thing
[2:23:44] that happened in some of the dreams one
[2:23:46] of the people said that after brother
[2:23:48] Branham went he pretty much disappeared
[2:23:49] they didn't see him no more and can I
[2:23:51] tell you that after he come back he went
[2:23:54] to went west March of 1963 got the
[2:23:57] Steel's brought him back here to the
[2:24:00] east start preaching them and now we got
[2:24:02] the revelation of what rebel I mean
[2:24:04] revelation five and six what it means we
[2:24:06] got that now you know within about two
[2:24:09] years after that God called him home it
[2:24:13] was finished the mysteries were finished
[2:24:16] but all of that happened and all it was
[2:24:19] connected just like Joseph had a dream
[2:24:21] at the beginning at the first coming of
[2:24:23] the Lord here got using all these dreams
[2:24:25] at the second coming the Lord to show us
[2:24:27] where we at and I'll bring you things
[2:24:28] that happened back in 61 62 63 how much
[2:24:32] coal are we now
[2:24:35] how much close are we now I can tell you
[2:24:38] this much have you been searching and
[2:24:41] trying to find this and trying to find
[2:24:42] that stop you found what you're supposed
[2:24:46] to be you know you now you know you're
[2:24:49] supposed to be and now let this get you
[2:24:51] prepared for this great rapture let's
[2:24:55] break
[2:24:59] father your word has been spoken these
[2:25:04] different rims that you deal with people
[2:25:05] in visions dreams sometimes in the
[2:25:12] humanistic realm of just believing that
[2:25:15] you will do it just hoping and believing
[2:25:16] that you'll do it my prayer Lord is that
[2:25:19] people are here the still small voice of
[2:25:24] the Spirit speak to help them O God to
[2:25:30] find peace and to settle them Lord in
[2:25:33] their searching and we know God that
[2:25:37] there's a place that you could have for
[2:25:39] us to go where we can fit Elijah when
[2:25:43] the famine was on and there is certainly
[2:25:45] a famine in the land a day is famine for
[2:25:47] spiritual things but Elijah had a place
[2:25:51] that he could go and be fed he couldn't
[2:25:53] go everywhere there was only one place
[2:25:55] that Elijah could go and be fed Lord is
[2:25:59] the same thing today it's only one place
[2:26:01] that we can go and that's where ever the
[2:26:02] reveal word is being spoken if we're not
[2:26:07] hearing the reveal word God we're
[2:26:08] missing it our attention should be on
[2:26:13] you you being the the great bridegroom
[2:26:16] you were perfect and as a dream said we
[2:26:20] weren't perfect yet but Oh God we're
[2:26:22] coming into that because the word is
[2:26:24] bringing us into it Lord my prayer is
[2:26:30] that to us help us to hear what the
[2:26:32] Spirit is trying to tell us in the south
[2:26:33] don't let us miss it please God don't
[2:26:37] let us miss it if there was ever time to
[2:26:41] hear the voice of God that time is right
