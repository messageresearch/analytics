she she was receiving some people into her home and somehow she contracted the virus and she was living in the same room with a granddaughter and both the mother and the grant the grandmother and the granddaughter ended up in the hospital together both of them ended up in a coma the grandmother did not make it she was called home earlier this week and I should say last week but the granddaughter

scripture together The Lost Prayer which begins with our Father who art in heaven so let's go to Matthew praise be to God let's look at Matthew chapter 6 we're gonna read Matthew 6 chapter 6 verse 9 to 14 to Anna our Father Jehovah who has become the Lord Jesus Christ we love our earthly fathers the lovers the kisses when we were born but then a time comes they leave us some were not even fortunate to have a carryin Atlee fathers maybe somebody's that he died when he walked before he was even born he or she was born well yes there's one father who doesn't leave you who never leave you all the days of your life even before you knew him as a father he loved you he showed that you he fed you he protected you he healed your sickness he put you together when we were falling apart amen and that is the father the Lord Jesus Christ himself so for his honor and glory let's say we together Matthew chapter 6 verse 9 to 14 amen or maybe let our pastor read and we listen amen because it's our earthly father he is our spiritual father here god bless you after this manner therefore pray ye and we should all do this together our Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen let's clap on to a father amen praise be to God he's such a father amen amen where will we be without the law Jesus Christ where will I be I might be at the bottom amen I remember had a vehicle accident after high school had prizes I was happy for prizes and had a terrible accident three people died on this spot the engine of the vehicle that collided with my vehicle the engine was roaming in the atmosphere my father wasn't there my mother wasn't there but I had a father above who showed me amen that was the law Jesus Christ himself amen and you can testify something similar to that that without him you wouldn't be standing here glory to be to his name Amen let's say take another scripture we what shall we be seated sorry we want to talk about unique blessings and shrouded in unique afflictions amen last week the Lord blesses I was a brother smileys please and the Lord put that topic on my heart to preach unique blessings and unique unique trials and unique blessings amen but I want to modify the title a little bit here we go to make the title unique blessing and shrouded in unique trials and affliction unique blessings and shrouded in unique trials and affliction the Aster in afflictions the acident blessings that a lot give it to us but before the blessings come to us the blessings are heralded by trials and affliction and we're gonna see a lot of examples in the Bible in our own lives amen because you are the scripture made flesh today we can talk about Abraham Adam Jesus of Nazareth 2,000 years ago but if it's not reflected in my life and in your life then it's just a bunch of history amen but we don't serve God of history Hebrews 13:8 says Jesus right the same yesterday today and forever more amen what he did for our fathers and our mothers hundreds of years ago or thousands of years ago he's really same thing in our lives and we are blessed with scriptures and examples which is recorded for us that when we are going through those afflictions and trials we know that is just a hair out of a blessings on their way glory hallelujah so that will help us to take courage there regardless of what we see around there's a father in us who loves you amen which bringing something out of your life and all those that are the affliction that we are going through it's a blessing son daddy's guys glory hallelujah Konev arose as brother Jack always said there's a blessing of coronavirus which we see in our lives amen when Cana started the government had a plan that you know what the economies are shut down millions of people are losing their job so before we are given a financial bonus is free money I had 1200 I don't know what you had I was I was doing exam so I did even had a time to apply for it my friend hood we die hey quick we got you I mean make sure you get make sure you put your put things in order you know get set it up so that you can get your money and I was so busy doing exam so one day I went to my account and I saw 1200 deposit and I said where's this coming from I always make sure that I'm not spending some money that's not meant for me because banks can make mistakes so that I remember oh okay this could be day because last year I did my tax and if you use the same account they will send it to us a glory hallelujah to the Lord then after a copy wish I saw a letter from do not Trump they've given some money and they want to make sure you receive it I said the money's already gone it's melted into thin air so that is a blessing a made even in the midst of calamities we acknowledge that life have been lost people have lost jobs properties government cannot balance the economy's the whole world is shut down people have to stay home we couldn't come for service and different things but God in the mess of it has blessings for us amen glory hallelujah and I want us to look at a phenomenon that happened during a pandemic April 7th and 8th to 2020 April just before Easter I think that was April 12 but on April 7th and 8th there was a supernatural phenomena or heavenly before God does something on earth God does it in a celestial dimension would you call heaven or six damnation or the six REM and God reveal it into the sky the atmosphere because in the olden days before before this we started reading Bible on purpose God had another Bible in the atmosphere which is the zodiac so God Bible is the one that man cannot other treats as for the Bible we have got so many people Bible King James Version name it New International Version what have you good news Bible and now which one message Bible and we've got so many Bibles you know so many probably thousands of them but there's something God did that man cannot alter that is the face Bible which is the zodiac which is gos own imprint it and that is what gasps oh God should a phenomenon called a super moon super moon is when the moon comes closest to the earth they call it also pink moon it doesn't describing pink but pink is the color of feminine amen is God doing something with his wife with his feminine feminine portion partner so on the seventh and the eighth moon there was the moon even the size of the moon was larger than its Israeli is the size was around true two hundred and twenty one thousand two hundred and twenty one seventeen seventy two thousand miles bigger than the normal size so the Saturday moon was larger and it was closer to the earth and then this phenomena took place on the seventh and the eighth of the amount April 7 is Animorph completion eight is a number of new beginning or the number of eternity God began a new cycle in life and apparently God is doing something new on this earth amen in my lifetime I've never seen a deal where the whole world is shut down everybody's stay home it's only this time amen and God is doing something upon the earth though people might not see everything do God a lot my nursery written all at once but is doing something upon the earth amen so he allowed this super moon phenomenon to occur on earth for us to know that the moon represent what the wife of christ the son is is that is their husband their stars represent gasps children every son and daughter of God was born under a sign under a certain a certain figure under a certain sign and a certain phenomenon a certain part and crocin of their son and under it god odin you that is where you have certain blessings in your life amen yes and a sign that you are born that when you know that son when God reveals it to you I'm not talking about astrological science I'm talking about God's own sign that my son was born and at his sign and when you stand at a sign nothing can defeat you amen when you'd see another sign of God which is the Holy Ghost sign there's nothing I can do future life amen like a Samson you know he was 100 assign his Cavanaugh was an asura covenant no research you touch his hair and as long as he was greener under the sign it doesn't matter and lion could not PA he can't Jess the Holy Ghost who just anoint him and who just grabbed a lion and Ted a lion into pieces and the same thing God has put you under a sign what is the spine the Lord Jesus Christ in you amen that is a greater sign God give it to you is that I'll be with you even in you on to the end of the world so on till you leave this world God who knows his being in you and being with you amen afflictions and trials who come tribulations who come but the law doesn't mean the Lord is not with you it means he's with you and it's been new things in your life he's breaking news psychos in your life is bringing new blessings in your life so he allowed looser affliction to open the door for those blessings in your life glory hallelujah to the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord amen so let's read a take our first example on the story of Joseph Joseph had a unique affliction he was born he had in his family Farah is just a Jacob as we know his mana was richer now he was the mother was barren so the mom went through affliction before he was born when his brother Benjamin was being born the mom passed away so he called him Ben Oni means bitterness offering pain disaster whatever but in his phallus which is named to Benjamin a blessing amen the monopoly was a prophetess the father was a prophet amen so the two of them were special to Jacob because their mom has gone to be with the Lord but then before I go unless read story fest maybe some of us are not acquainted with a story so let's go to Genesis chapter 39 and look at especially affliction the Lord allow in the life of Joseph to bring him to where he was he was supposed to be he was meant to go amen Genesis chapter 39 we're gonna read from the first verse probably about 20 verses Genesis 39 we must be skip some of them Genesis 13 I want to 1 to 20 and Joseph was brought down to Egypt and Potiphar an officer of Pharaoh captain of the guard and Egyptian bought bought him of the hands of the Ishmaelite which had brought him down thither and the Lord was with Joseph and he was a prosperous man and it was in the house of his master and the Egyptian and his master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord made all that he do all that he did to prosper in his hand and Joseph found grace in his sight and he served him and he made him an overseer over his house and all that he had he put it into his hand it came to pass from that time that he had made him overseer in his house and over all that he had that a Lord blessed the Egyptians house for Joseph's seek for your sake the Lord will bless somebody amen if you walk with the Lord for you see God will bless your children your family and your loved ones glory hallelujah so the Lord bless Potiphar for Joseph's sake and a blessing of the Lord was upon all that he had in the house and in the field verse 6 and he left all that he had in Joseph's hand and he knew not what he had safe the bread which he did eat and Joseph was a goodly person and wealth even so the bread was with what was the wife of Potiphar amen that was a Bible team Bible has got coots blessed be the name of the Lord so if you think about a man who trusts you and give you his business take care of his company his work has his servants what is bread what is a loaf of bread wheat and corn it's not that the bread is standing for his wife amen the wife is only ten does nobody his somebody cannot give it to you no that is just for the man alone and the man is for the wife alone amen so let's go on and see and it came to pass after this since that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph and she said lie with me and he refused and said unto his master's wife behold my master what not what is with me in the house he had committed all that he had to my hand there is none greater than in this house than I neither had he kept back anything from me but thee because thou art his wife how then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God and it came to pass as she speak she speak to Joseph D by D that he had came not unto her to lie by her or to be with her amen God has put something in you to become every trial the Holy Ghost amen and it came to pass about this time that Joseph went into the house to do his business and there was none of the men of the house there within and she caught him by his garment saying lie with me and he left his garment in her hand and fled and got him out and he came to pass when she saw that he had he had left his garment in a hand and was fled forth that she caught on to the men of the house of a house and spoken to them saying see he had brought in an Hebrew on Twista Maka's he came in on to me to lie with me and I cried with a loud voice and he came to pass when he had that I lifted up my voice and cried that he had left his garment with me and fled and got him out she laid and she laid upon his garment by her until his Lord came in and she's pick on to his on to him according to there were saying in the Hebrew servant which has brought on 2's came in on to me to mock me and it came to pass I lift up my voice or kill em skip to verse 20 and Joseph's master took him and put him into prison a place where the Kings prisoner were bound and he was there in prison amen if when you go home you can read the whole chapter now Joseph let me go back a little bit and give the buttress the story Joseph was we know the story he had a gift of God in his life he was spiritual amen he believed in a prophet is what I was a prophet so his father preached to him God ordained a gift of prophet in his life and used to see visions and dream dreams so he told his father and his brethren that is so a dream that the whole heaven and earth was bowing to him before and he's got another Premal ready that plants and different things were bowing to him and is what I say you you are the last but one are we going to bow to you no way it's not going to happen so now this begin to develop hatred for Joseph and then he had another dream that heavens and earth were bowing to him which is father even rebuked him said what do you mean me and your mama are good about to you what what kind of dream is this but it's what I've been a spiritual person kapnos dream and watch his son because he saw there's something special about his son so he made him a coat of many colors seven colours which is a table of the seven Church ages amen and now Joseph went about his business one day his father sent him that your brothers are keeping the Sheep so take this food and corn and differences and go give to them so he went and a brother said lo here comes a dreamer this is the time to do something about it this guy has been dreaming in telling us are we gonna bow to him why don't you just get rid of him you know kill him so his oldest brother Reuben made a plan that you know what he's my brother and sort of killing him lest he came with a plan that lets put him in a pit and his plan was like taking from the pit and taking back to the Father but the Lord had a purpose for everything I hop into your life whatever happens to you whatever trials the Lord has a purpose for it so before he could go and rescue his brother the sodium already to the Midianites he's gone and there was nothing he could do so they took him and that ended up in Potiphar's house a lot of the Egyptians and because he was a godly person even in the West time the Lord opens favors for him amen so behold lo and behold he was favored by Potiphar he put in charge of his business he saw that as God would with this men whatever he does his being blessed wherever his step is being blessed remember he was sold amen you might have been sold you might lose your job you might lose your family but the blessings of the Lord is with you amen and is all it will go into a psych cycle to bring you a blessing amen so Joseph is a began to prosper was elevated in charge of company Potiphar's business everything the only thing is his wife nobody give his wife - you know it's one-to-one ratio amen so his wife I don't know he was probably a young man and I don't know that I begin to I Jusuf the devil is always looking for something because there's something about you so the devil will always look for something to tempt you to bring reproach to bring trials to bring affliction but a lot would turn it around to be a blessing to you if you stay with the Lord amen so regardless of the trials Joseph could have given into that today - the lady but his first wife but instead oh how can I do such wickedness against God and against my master who is put everything in my KB's I do Joseph was innocent he kept in his business one day he went to his business and it got to the peak of the trial so this lady literally grabbed Yousef that there's nobody around here you are young and some man why don't you have a day have a nice day but he said no I cannot do this it even I give away the ages to trees flight took on his heels run for his life but in the olden days in the east in civilization they don't dress like the way we dress you way or your pantalone of pants and or you wear your skirts and blouson and shits know they have outer garment and inner garment just like maybe could they have the outer coat so they have a long group in a garment and a long group like maybe a mourning gown or something like that that we did dress so the lady grabbed he was running in the course of it because he grabbed him he left his outer garment and he ran for his life and now imagine in this day if I let it go to the police station that you rip hey he's got your garment who is going to be the witness what are you going to say to defend yourself there's no way about it but the almighty seat amen so he was locked in prison and all his dream was shattered again all his ambition and dreams and visions was gone and already that was morning his little brother Benjamin was mourning that I'm not going to see my son anymore and remember Joseph's life God had a covenant remember in the time of Adam he had a conditional covenant if you do this I'll do this if you tie the tree of knowledge of good and evil the data you touch it you're gonna die so there was condition attached to it but study from Abraham he began a condition of unconditional a covenant of unconditional love amen Abram was the father of faith God was showing feet his feet attribute of it through Abraham his son Isaac was an attribute of love he was a type of Christ he was a beloved son now Jacob was Greece amen so the Lord Greece was it his name Jacob means this meant deceiver but the grace of God was with him all the time and a lot has insurers profit everything the law shoe is providing his 7 things he want them to know and he wanted people to know so the Lord he showed you a Jacob that is son was still alive so Jacob was morning when they should be brought back the garment that they could have many colors and you know that he wasn't going to see son again but I was a Greece of God because God dealt with Joseph dealt with Jacob in a manner of Greece amen so Jacob certain times go to give you a blessing and that blessing is a transition a blessing Jacob sorry Joseph was an apostle Potiphar but I wasn't where the final destination God ordained for him the final destination was to be a prime minister of Egypt so God would give you a blessing let's say a job a business a position something and allowed himself will let something happen and scattered a blessing just like in the case of Joseph he was blessed at least he was consumed that if my vision doesn't come true I'm here got a company to be the CEO of the company or I'm the deputy CEO or I am the eius or whatever title they would give it to him he was assistant to Potiphar he was actually in charge he was running or the shoe but then the Lord allowed trial to destroy this blessing why because that was a transition a blessing it wasn't the ultimate blessing the ultimate blessing is not to be in the house of Potiphar God has got something higher for him glory hallelujah amen and in our lives you might live for I need a thousand dollars that is your plan e on this side but the Lord you from getting to plan a you may fight all your way out plan is blog you have done you have worked this job for

all my life to you I said with all my heart what did I do wrong why is this come upon me but so God has an answer plan is blocked but there's a little door opening Plan B and finally after fighting your way in plan a plan is blocked so you have no choice but to turn to plan B now when you tend to plan B begins to open wider for you it begins to open wider and open wider now the Lord loves you he knows that you want thousand dollars but a thousand dollars plus for you so when we moved to plan B here's your thousand dollars plus 1 million dollars you didn't ask for amen you lose your job whether you pay you pay to paycheck to paycheck now God give you a business gotta be a blessing that ran into millions of dollars which is not your strength but God ordained ordination now when you step into Plan B he's got a blessing right for you you are not going to struggle he allow you to struggle here I said transition to train you so that you can manage Plan B glory hallelujah to the Lord amen so in life certain things might not work for you you might blame yourself by God according or tinit its plan which is way higher than what you are thinking about glory hallelujah for you you might go to churches you might try certain things in life you might try everything it doesn't wake but the moment you find the preferable of God the Lord opened a blessings for you and it's opens and it opens and it opens and it opens for you glory hallelujah to the Lord amen blessed be the Lord amen glory to the Lord amen so Joseph as we know his life he was in prison and they the Bible said a gift of God the love of God was through with him Joseph was able to interpret dreams and two people had a dream day who was Pharaoh who was like the president of Egypt his chief Butler and chief Baker and in a dream the chief Butler was restored the one who give wine to the king but the chief Baker was killed so it took a battle Aadhaar when it come to pass please say something good about me grab a meter pharaoh in that way I also have some fever I've been locked in prison for I was innocent I didn't commit no adultery I didn't commit fornication I didn't do nothing wrong but our Jess I was a stranger I can't even afford to have a lawyer I can't afford to have a solicitor so here I am in jail nobody's going to speak for me only the Lord speak for me when the chief Butler was restored he forgot about Joseph he had a good time was restored his job and this was good they put out sometime you hope they do not remember you but a lot always remember you Amen but what are you did good it can't even return the good with Eve oh don't worry about it concentration on the Lord Jesus Christ don't said oh I did this to this person I help him I help you give me your children it could be your wife it could be your husband it could be your uncle could be your daddy those who I took her of much anybody have abandoned me don't worry about it they'll lose everything amen the Lord knows it all amen he work it around for you for your good now there was a time that pharaoh had a dream in the dream who was disturbing the dream and he caught all astrologists or the magician's they couldn't trance they couldn't interpret the dream then the chief Butler remember that oh I remember this Hebrew guy in the jail he interpreted my dream for me and said go get him they brought Joseph here he was in a Jill all his beard probably grown up to his feet his hair overgrown it even helped it couldn't afford achieve a stick but a lot to remember him the bubbles of the Lord was with him even the rest of your time when you can afford even your pocket is leaking if your pocket is you cannot go to hold money in your pocket there's holes in your pocket there's holes in your prayers sisters the sauce in your wallet brothers you cannot even afford a candy for your son or your grandson or your daughter but the Bible said the Lord is through with you amen so Laura how come I can't even afford ev3 square meal how you with me I'll be with you even in you on to the end of the world amen so don't let your afflictions don't think because of your affliction God doesn't love you he loves you Amen so when he came before Pharaoh as we know the story he gave everything that interpretation of the dream and first I why even keep this guy here I mean and for Joseph didn't ask for favor he said you need to put somebody in charge to take off the off of the head the famine that is going to come so that you can store food for the first seven years to be kept for the last seven years where there's gonna be famine on the land dry no rain and no water and it's always the best person to be in Chad and you Joseph so right away what God has for Joseph before the foundation of the world the dream that he had which was being hit at for the dream you could say this day this scripture is for food in my life you can say this day this vision is manifesting in my life you can say this day this word of God for me personally for my family for my children for my husband for my wife from appearance for my uncle for my area for my church whatever this day this blessing is manifested in my own life amen and Joseph was a prime minister he was over warm Wow from being super my brethren my mom died and my brother showed me I was falsely accused by a professor's wife put in jail in prison for being innocent and here I'm a prime minister nobody could see Pharaoh would have seen Jesus sorry could have seen Joseph and nobody could see Jesus without seeing you because you are Joseph of more of the modern day amen your name physical may not be Joseph but aspect of Joseph is upon you amen if you know who you are people cannot see Jesus without seeing you amen your neighbors when they want to see Jesus they will go to you but I brother brother Troy mr. Troy there's something about you I have this problem I know you pre can you pray for me you haven't even told him you a Christian you have not Tony but he could see the Lord let him know that there's a man in the area there's a man on the job there's a man in the company whom I can listen to many priests amen and that's why we have to open your eyes wider God will make you a testimony unto others God will use your testimony does we use your humility your laugh your obedience to bring souls unto Him amen glory because the whole world is hungry and thirst for God you are the one who is closer to the Lord amen so Joseph the Lord use that transition a blessing to bring yourself in let's go to another story let's go to Hanna First Samuel First Samuel chapter 1 blessed be the name of the Lord amen trials or blessings wrapped in affliction as humans even Jesus when he was on the flesh our human flesh is not made to enjoy afflictions the human nature the human spirit is not made to rejoice in affliction but a Bible said I rejoice even in your affliction that's why Jesus on before the cross he cried to the Holy Ghost in him the father is in him the father was in him is that father if it's possible let this cup let his suffering this affliction because you saw a vision of the devil been anoint anointed and anointing people to come and kill him his suffering was huge you could see them in vision you could see a a was the name you could see a he already Lazarus has been Oh Lazarus and Judas has betrayed him already and you could see everything being played before him and I've been a human being remember Jesus Christ was a hundred percent human being he was a hundred percent God and hundred percent human being blessing in affliction blessing and shrouded in a frisson Sevilla in the body of a human being amen so he said God Father if it's possible let this cup pass over me but then the voice said on to this course was I born he was born to take care of your sins and my sin so we cannot let back up that's off renew pass him by the same thing that some part of the sovereign has has been left for you and I that was suffering through those afflictions and trials the lot of bringing others onto you what does the sovereign do it as bring the attribute of grace of laughs of righteousness of the holiness of God of date amen you were born with a date in you we are born with a quality of Christ in you you are part of omnipotent God you are omnipresent amen if God is in you but I will not try us an affliction those glory will not be manifested so the Lord has allowed those trials to form your character like Joseph when he had this vision God didn't give him that it wasn't the first time he saw the vision that's when became a premise of of Egypt it took years it was some time for the vision to be manifested so your visions are not defeated no your dream is not defeated but a lot is forming the character to help you reign when he put you at a level amen because Carter without power without critize what satanic we see them all around in politics in religion in families people are in positions they abuse their power because they don't have the cut off Christ to go with it so Jesus himself came on earth to learn affliction to learn experience through their suffering he was able toward intercede for you and I when we pray he hears your prayer when you're going through afflictions because he has been through before amen glory hallelujah so let's read the story of Hannah from Fez Samuel glory hallelujah let's read samuel chapter 1 verse 5 glory hallelujah let's read from verse 5 up to maybe 10 or 14 rather think that would you glory hallelujah First Samuel chapter 1 verse 5 to 14 but on to Hannah you know Hannah was a woman who had no children he had prayed all these years but let's go on but on to Hannah he gave away that was a husband on - Hannah he gave a worthy portion for he loved her for he loved Hannah but the Lord had shut up her womb I want you to notice this it wasn't a devil - at the womb the Lord has shut up a wound the Lord blocks plan E amen it wasn't somebody oh I would have been in this position I did this person he's that which is that witchcraft is there he's my obstacle is my enemy he blocked me from going to this place but the Lord shut the womb of Hannah amen so my presence I don't have an enemy No nobody's my enemy not even the one who cut my throat but rom said if I should have an enemy the Wesen means me myself cuckoo so don't look at anybody ask your enemy don't have any me if somebody has done something against you just let it go if you had I didn't take of you to this far as this send him a message forgive him Amen if your mother did for Sookie forgive her Amen if somebody did you evil regardless of the Evo don't look it up as and look at Jesus Christ you just let me go amen the Lord made him to do it amen now with the scripture I want to finish with this one so the Lord shut hey whoomp not the devil for the Lord did it and so is it then and as he did sooo yeah but yet they go to a they go to shallow for sacrifice when she went to the house of the Lord sue she provoked hey that was a rabid ass man's wife her husband's a husband's wife right that is the other wife to Penina know oh I have to Elkanah she was always cousin Hannah because Hannah didn't have a child so there was always provocation insult abuse bhajana wasn't looking at arrival was looking up the Lord amen so she kept her focus on the Lord through what prayer prayer is the key to all the questions we have amen so a cana her husband said unto her on to Hannah why we pass down why it has down note and why is thine heart grieved am I not better to thee than ten sons so Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh and after they are drunk now elide a priest sat upon a seat by the puss of the temple of the Lord and she was in bitterness of Ceuta was Hannah she prayed unto the Lord and Webb saw verse 11 and she vowed a vow and said O Lord of Hosts if thou indeed look on my affliction of on the affliction of the Aisne handmade and remember me and not forget thine handmaid but will give unto thine handmaid a man-child this a specific blessing Pacifica requests from Hanna a man-child then will I give him on to the Lord all the days of his life and that she an erisa come upon his head amen let me let me stop right there Hanna when you need something from the Lord speak from your heart the Lord is not limited so Hanna cried unto the Lord she's been barren she's past menopause there was no hope for him if I want to read a Bible stories because his path is easy for us to think I okay it was easy Jesse desperate but put yourself a 17 year old woman praying for a child go into the doctor's office that I want to make appointment I'm gonna have a child what's wrong with you grandma I you psycho are you I mean that's something wrong here but Hannah didn't give up and she asked something specific say Lord if you give me a boy a man child nor is out dedicate him on to you and no reason touch his head his head but the Lord that was Hannah's plan II the Lord had planned before Hannah and Hannah was beyond gone past menopause there was no that's why the husband said that look I like you know I love you better than any other woman in do studies to marry one two three and so forth but there was something there was a fist that hasn't been fulfilled the Lord has suffer for that fist so Hannah cried and prayed unto the Lord so the Lord we think about the remembrance after being 67 70 years old Hannah came before the Lord today you on demand of God amen so the Lord call for a conference in heaven he called the angels he called a gay bro he called wormwood and all the angels in heaven kerubim seraphim's guardian angels that come let's have a conference today we need to take care of Hannah so all of the angels came said you know Hannah had been bearing for for since emeriti was maybe 16 year old girl he might do started he go to school they didn't I mean to what we do so they marry early you know the agriculture farming and steena two men raising case so maybe she might around 18 but I lock her womb and this woman didn't give up on she's been praying despite I locate womb she didn't forsake me she prayed all night she doesn't stop doing good to people she doesn't stop loving children she doesn't stop kitchen fighter people's children today I can't help it we need to do something for Hannah what do you suggest one of them is a lord and I said lovely woman you know give it a daughter you know to console a so that's a good idea what do you have to see the other angels suggest the Lord why don't you give their twins give it to lovely daughters you know identical twins now control it out make it happy that's a good idea a lot while she asked for her son give him a son so ok that's a good idea I think you are getting closer and a lot begin to look back you permit me to use your piano your instrument for example the Lord went we went to the instrument there were so many children and he said who do I send to Hannah the lobby need to look at their keys do I send him a son twins triplets what do I send him a king a pastor who do I send to Hannah a man of God a girl who be praying with her mother and Allah said in order she did ask for a prophet she asked for a man child granted she won't - that is her own desire she said I didn't Ellen she said she want to keep that charge no going to cut the child's hair in those that are not a nasara covenant that son is not going to drink alcohol is not going to do the things of the world he want to connect she want to consecrate that son on to me but she asked me for a pasta she asked for a prophet she didn't ask for a priest she asked when I Vangelis I'm gonna give her one of my greatest prophet of all time somewhat a prophet go to Hanna and after sheep read the Bible said at her countenance change had Amina change she wasn't sad no more the angel of the Lord touch her ally give it a blessing say let it be according to according to your desire right away the Lord the supernaturally there was something happened the Lord brought to phonic atmosphere and a Bible says she went to be with a husband there was a conception Hannah receive a baby she begin to rejoice in your affliction rejoice she begin to sing say Lord who are my woman that have been buried for years that you should visit me I'm four month pregnant not a mom to one pregnant that I've did a pregnancy test and is positive lord I can't even believe it she was rejoicing and praising the Lord and a lot give a what give a profit so now millions of people name their children after Samuel because of the character of Samuel so when God gives you enough permit enough affliction in your life don't worry about Satan don't worry about the devil don't worry about your boss your boss your destiny is not in the hand of your boss or your landlord is chasing you don't worry about those things don't worry about about your children God has everything any control Amen praise be to God glory be to the Lord let's look at a lot of scriptures to buttress this less good as a chapter 45 let's read from Isaiah 45 glory to the Lord so that in our trials we will keep our focus on the Lord as I chapter 45 verse 5 to 7 there 45 5 to 7 whatever happens in your life the Lord has a purpose for it verse 5 said I am the Lord and there is none else there is no God beside me I get at thee though thou hast not know me the Lord guides your footstep in trials though you may know understand six that day may know from the rising of the Sun and from the West that there is none beside me I am the Lord and there is none else verse seven I want you to take note I formed the light and create darkness I make peace and create evil I the LORD do all these things amen so who from the light the Lord who creates a vow the Lord the Lord does all of them for the glory of his name Amen because the whole purpose of us here on earth is to live for the priests and his glory so yeah you allow a big light in your path you rejoice in the light but then all of a sudden darkness comes in because the darkness is leading you to a bigger light to your ultimate blessing so the Lord used that darkness to cover that little light here your plan a so that you push you to Plan B where he's got ultimate blessings for you amen and what we need to do is be sensitive to the Lord when we are sensitive to the Lord you want to have his perfect wall amen don't close your mind to the Lord sometimes you pray you can prove a certain things four million times it doesn't mean a lot as I'm headed but it's going to do it in a way that you don't envisage in a way that you don't anticipate because his arms are written on your arms his blessings are more than what you are asking for what you're asking for is a peanut before the Lord but he want to give you the ultimate blessing amen that you don't have to struggle no more amen the acident blessing that God gives you to you that is not a struggling anymore the Lord will permit a struggling times you go through struggles to train you to transform you to show you his grace and his love then finally he bliss you to position of leadership and blessing and authority and reign Andrew amen and every one of us here has got position in a lot all of us have got leadership amen you might not be the pasta but it doesn't mean you don't have a leadership in your home a sister amen in your job please you might not be the boss you might be the list in their ranks but as a leadership of Christ in you I'm not talking about manmade leadership you can be a see you if you don't have a character is of no use you can't their president if you don't have the character to go with it is of no use but you can be their mop the one who mops the janitor the one who moves the ground but if got a cut off Jesus Christ your influence is greater than the president amen so because he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world blessed be the name of the Lord glory hallelujah let's look at Samson I'll give you the scriptures to you because of time let's read em I'll give you a scripture JJ's 14 1 to 9 judges let's see if I can read Samson went - what happened - Samson on his wedding day let's see judges 14 1 to 9 see how the Lord does in his room as 8:28 says all things work together for good to them that love the Lord cause one time they lost plan and his thinking is way beyond our planner our thinking Samson was born in us right just like Samuel Amen and no reason she touch his head no she didn't drink alcohol you can't even go near dead bodies who's not a close person so they have all kind of a covenant they have to do with vows and so but then Samson was a Jewish he was a Hebrew and a ghost covenant he was circumcised so he was supposed to stay within the confines of his word of his covenant and the Bible says in judges chapter 14 verse 1 said Samson went down to Timnath and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistine and he came up and told his father and his mother and said I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistine now therefore go get her for me - wife Wow then his father his mother said unto unto him is there never a woman among the daughters of the of thy brethren or among all the all my people that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised philistine AMSAT and Samson said unto his father get her for me for she pleased me well verse 4 but his father and his mother knew not that it was of the Lord that he sought an occasion against the Philistines for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel so sometimes the Lord does something out of your range out of your thinking verse 5 then when Samson Dow and his father and his mother - Timnath and came to the vania Sultanate and behold young lion rode against him that was on Sam since the lip let's put the modern time imagine today's your wedding day you come in for better job to pass your wedding you can't wait to have your wife now you are underway before you got up and come out of your room alignment in front of your door put yourself in a situation what I'm going to say probably might give up on the Lord why me why a lie on the day of my wedding when I'm dressed up in my in my in my brighter garment there's a lion in front of my door there's a bulldog who want to but I mean bite me where's this coming from this must be a witchcraft this must be the devil himself this might be sittin tried to destroy my wedding day but the Lord was up to something amen glory hallelujah the Bible said that the Lord came upon Samson glory hallelujah to the Lord let's see what did I get you verse 5 thank you verse 6 and the Lord came mightily upon upon him and he rent him as he rent have rent a kid and he had nothin in his hand but he told not his father and his or his mother what he had done verse 7 and he went down and talked with a woman and she pleased Sampson well then verse 8 and after a time he retained to take MC no let go to verse 7 give me one second I want to occupy seat and after a time he returned to take her and he turned outside to see the carcass of the lion and behold there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcass of the lion and he took them off in his hand and went on eating and came to his father and his mother and he gave them and they did it but he told them not that he had taken the honey out of the carcass of a lion God bring in affliction bringing blessings out of affliction the Lord brought blessing the trial data like Samson met meeting a lion he overcame the lion but a lot brought blessing of honey out of out of the lie on the carcass of the lion sometime your trials your affliction is a hair out of a lesson on their way and you did if you embrace those trials with a heart of Christ it will bring the manifestation of Christ if you run away from those challenges your blessing is going to be hindered amen Christians that hope like grasshoppers right when there's affliction here they jump here when oh there's something literally they jump here they always want the easy side when there's a lot of problem in the church oh no I'm going I'm going to leave when there's a little bit at home I'm leaving home I'm jumping here you are living the affliction you always jump in here you are not said to jump in here and jump in here and you never get bless but the one that will be stopped be still and know that I'm your Lord he's the one that is getting blessed amen there were fishes that call on the Lord fish in the river and big fishes are always trying to eat them up so those three fishes prayed on to the Lord one of them pray Lord give me give me the opportunity to be able to jump out of the water when the big fishes are coming the Lord give him his desire so when a big fishes are coming he pop up the water but of course fish cannot breathe in water they have to use their is what girls to take oxygen so when it comes out of the water there's no oxygen for that for the fish and it goes back to the water the big fishes are they so life was like jumping in the water coming out jumping in coming out no rest for this fish glory hallelujah the other fish pray that Lord give me eyes all over my body so I can see my enemies when a big fishes are coming I can just wear them move to another area so when a shark is coming he's running another bottom when you get to the bottom they say will he come to the top and it just running all around no peace the third free said or give me grace just protect me from this enemies praise be to God I don't qualify I don't have the strength to face this fish but just give me Greece and Allah gave him Greece he swim in the mouth of the will sometimes it's the the pieces of food in the mouth of the Wills and their shacks you don't eat it up it just remind them sit on top they will the grace of God was with him he passed two different afflictions the grace of God was there with him he was around with the big fishes they just look at him as a friend they don't eat him up sometime he sleep in their mouth the our mouth is open when they are taking a nap he sleep in their mouth and eat food the grace of God was with him and Greece is what we need amen when the grace of God is with you in the mess of the trouble you know I visit that trouble you wait and went through the trouble go your way and come back the Lord will protect you amen God's grace is way beyond way beyond because his grace is backed by his love amen when you seek Lord as for His grace amen that's why you should also be ready to give grease onto others the Bible's our forgive those who offend you so that your Father in Heaven can also forgive your trespasses so give grease onto others and the same grace in multiple form will come to you amen glory hallelujah to the Lord blessed be the name of the lord glory hallelujah let's look at Romans 8:14 18 we can read that later is that a trial so Paul was talking about the affection that we go through what's the time he's almost what the time can somebody tell me that I want to thank you so much god bless you so the a fish that we go through on this earth cannot be compared to the blessing that a lot has lead for us and affliction that you go through right now cannot be compared that glory that is being revealed in you right now not only at the other side but even now the Lord is blessing you he'll bless you and continue bless you amen so there's something in you that is why you are going through the affliction that we are going through look at Lisa card as Josh water prophet Joshua a warrior Jasha was fighting the lost battle and it gets night it gets the blackness begin to unfold and when is that your soldiers will not see the enemies so you're gonna you're gonna pay a price they're gonna kill more of your soldiers there was nothing the Lord do this was the lost battle just reading columns of the latke deemed after the departure of Moises to divide the land for the people and I also get rid of the enemies on the land the Philistines the Jew beside the Amalekites and all of them to be able to give each and every tribe their land and now here just a Joshua is fighting the lost battle darkness falls upon him and what did he do he's put their weight it's a Lord Sun still moon bestow in age alone until I find a lost battle and the Sun to throw the moon steed until he finished a battle of the Lord and about was that I wasn't there d like that the Lord Himself listen to a man and some Nietzsche because you have power over nature amen you have power over coronavirus amen the authority in you to protect pray for your family amen pray for your for your foyer for whoever you care for amen dip them in the blood of Jesus Christ amen pray for your nation prefer your people pray for your brothers and sisters prefer family that are being grieving pray for our loved ones who have been afflicted the father you are not afraid that doesn't mean somebody's not afflicted but it's on to you it's up to you and I to pray for them to hold them before the Lord to come for them amen so there's power in you because the omnipotent is in you if you take the sea water if you fetch a bucket for the same chemical element is in the same bucket of seawater if you take a spoonful of the sea water it's got the same chemical composition the same calcium the same potassium sodium and so forth and so on so the Almighty God the God who created the universe he listened you in your little vessel vessel he can do the same thing that Jesus of Nazareth could do in 2,000 years when it becomes needful amen when there's a need the Lord in you who come to the scene amen so don't don't don't be afraid of situation situations will come so well beyond your human comprehension but learn wanting to transfer your battle to the Lord Amen time oh no permit me ballast look at the story of David and Goliath and I want us to look at transferring the battle to the Lord what did we know the story of David and Joshua dividend a Goliath David wasn't even a soldier but a lot put upon his heart by his predestination so he could a bear that was his face pool he could a lion that was a second pool and it's what I just sent him to go and give food his brothers were on the warfare they were in the sauce army when he when he saw this big giant in the valley who come and cast a chain of Israel every day defied a lot of hosts and yes who is this guy they said well he's a warrior he's a Philistine who's got strength and whatever powers to be able to defy us there's nobody who could fight him and they said how can he defied the armies of the Living God is what as we are known with him that you your mouth your mouth you and your mouth why didn't even effort ascend you usually I've been having yet to be to begin with but it's a lot this man cannot defy the armies of the Lord so he came before Saul and so tried to salute you and young man this one has fought all his life and there's no way you can you be beautified this my don't lose your life I said I would do it I could I bear I get a lion and I can kill this man just like I did on today bend the lion so so so okay then let me try let me with my ammo put his I'm on him but when they we tried it it didn't fit God us give you a blessing TRAI Amen when you pray it could be a lot of slingshot just like this slingshot that's the weapon God has given to you and when you use it effectively in the name of Jesus Christ as us Jesus FA ith feed five letters grease grac number of grease everything will happen amen so David finally said no I'm not try this I want to use my slingshot and just my own I'm in my own dresses so he use it and he prayed when he came before that before a Goliath he didn't use his experience he also uses experience to convince so now we were to fight Goliath by one on the battlefront he transferred about her to his date even Goliath who is a giant giant ik when he came before David he said I'm going to he kiss him in the name of his idol god of the philistines he uses dates it is a giant who is probably taller than this burden but he didn't use his might he kissed David in the name of his idol uses might he transferred the battle to the Lord amen when affliction comes and he's beyond human capability beyond yours preacher capabilities transfer to the Lord Amen in in worship in preyus with the word Amen so he said in the name of the Lord of hosts the god I you defy or his father if I he will give cut your head off he will give you to me into the face stone stone is a revelation the first revelation oh is right a lot of your God is one have no idol worship no other God and we can do what our winged begin to put power in the revelation just one word of God and then he released the weight and a Wed me ended through and it hit the little place that goal editing cover hit him and fell on a post it on the ground the Word of God in you who defeat every enemy in track time don't cry don't let your mom go to depression don't go to anxiety cause entire camp resistance with this mind this man is limited but transferred to the Lord just pray and let the Lord have your own way amen because the law doesn't want suddenly given your power your hands can reach your mind can do it if there's food you want to eat you can just cook the food and if you don't have to pray again Lord give me food amen if the Lord has put money in your pocket you can just go to the grocery and buy groceries unless you a child unless a baby who cries so the Lord has already given to you but then if there's no food if there's nothing that situation is beyond your meas you don't have any way to me this situation this family issue this problem then it's time for you toward to transfer the battle to the Lord and the Lord who defeated Gilad for David they similar to take care of your goal ad it doesn't matter how toga lad is it doesn't how giant it the problem is the Lord Jesus Christ has specialized in things that are thought impossible you will replace the blessing for you amen you just believe that you have it fit is what a substance that we hope for though you don't cease physically is then the celestial dimension the more you pray the more you believe it the more you create it in your heart the more the thing become relative to you amen if the Lord saw you through yesterday he see you through today you see through tomorrow the Lord took of you you take of your children and is taking care of them amen if the Lord brought you through coronavirus up to this hour you take you to the Russell Crowe nas season Amen if you lost your job some time ago and you had another job the Lord will give you your daily bread amen there's nothing that is impossible with God and there's nothing impossible in you only believe all things are possible to them that believe amen let your heart do their job for you your heart is where Christ reigns this guy's not the one who controls a ship this guy makes a lot of noise but is limited so your mind cannot solve all the problems by your heart your faith can solve every problem that can be for you and so as I believe as a daughter of God son of God learn to transfer the butter to the Lord amen and that's what David did amen glory hallelujah to the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord look at Shadrach Meshach and Abednego they chose not to what to the air contaminated himself with the King's food scripture is Daniel Daniel chapter 3 verse 24 if you want to read the scripture they were challenged their faith was challenged to worship an idol they said no they are not going to worship that idol and three of them Shadrach Meshach Abednego is that even if the Lord doesn't deliver us we are not going to worship the idol there's a ton the Lord want to have confidence in you now you and I would take a personal stance for him that Here I am as a believer I love you Lord even if you don't save me from this situation I'll still love you amen our love shouldn't be called the love of God is not conditional and our love should be in condition now Lord if you don't give me this microphone I'm not going to come to church anymore I'm not going to worship the Lord anymore I'm going to start drinking tobacco and drinking alcohol because I prayed all night I didn't give you the microphone what kind of believe I you know faithfulness amen by just serving God because of material things Lord if you don't give me big big business if you don't make me the CEO of the company I'm not going to go to church no I'm not going to pay my tight anymore that is not the love of Christ amen the love of Christ should go beyond that Lord even if you don't give me I pray like Hannah all the years I pray like Abraham and Sarah but a lot even if you don't do this for me I still live obviously for Christ amen some time lock yourself in your room and dance and rejoice and be happy with the Lord don't let situation I mean overtake you Amen so and I'll do that just like yourself and dance rejoice nobody you see you just hang the Lord please God just do you're not in your own little room blessed a lot I love you all my life is for you and a lot I appreciate that amen the Lord is not far away from assisting you and it's watching you amen is God angels around you and they are watching over you amen he's reviewing every situation there's nothing that a lot who put you through the eyes not already gone ahead of you he may not show you all the time but is there in you because I'll be with you even you and to the end of your world amen your what is hundred years that's your world you'll be with you if somebody's here yeah what is fifty years he'll be with him on to that end if somebody's what is up to 120 years he will be with him in him or in here on to that point so you never forsake you if not today you take it from this earth so let don't let worry speed of worry because we are in a world that we see a lot of things in our mind and I worry bring anxiety the Christian and all kind of sickness and Lois are it affect our health and our faith but then when we able to surrender transfer like David just transferred to the Lord just like Shadrach Meshach and Abednego said Lord even if you don't do it we are not going to worship the idols and guess what you put them in a fire and the king who ordered for them to put in a fire so a fourth person and I said how many people did you put that fire three but I can see a fourth man I could see a few funny the greedy Turner the lla Elohim he's the light son of the Living God that was the Lord Himself he tended attended heat that killed the suja's themself we're trying to put them in and made it air conditioned for them that's how the Lord has the problem the very problem that you have the Lord tenants are round to be a blessing for you glory hallelujah he's the I am that I am amen as I said in Spanish you soy khao SOI that is the rest I am that I am I am ten deep remove Abraham to be a blessing for him he turned the problems of Sarah Baron has to be a problem for them to be a solution he turned their problems to be a blessing son to them so all the oppression that you are going through and create yourself that the Lord is leading me to a blessing this trials is just say it's a cover-up and shroud it just a cover-up it's a covering of my blessing so even in my dress I have to rejoice and dance and proofs go hallelujah even in my in my in my trials I have to rejoice and come to church with happiness and thank God after I mean a Saudi princes shot victory don't wait to see the victory I saw this on a friend say what's up Paige said don't wait to see their blessing before you give God fans and their praises don't wait till you get a microphone in your hands now I'm looking for a microphone I've got in my hands that's why we stand a lot for our church for the school amen we don't want to see that face we don't want to wait to see the physical school to see that church to get the money we need before we Thunder with Daniel oh we already need amen it doesn't matter corona we are going to go beyond corona and a lot is renew things bringing souls the Lord is saving people the Lord is a blessing his sons and daughters we on the other side of Karuna amen it doesn't matter you going to be on the other side and shout the victory amen so you might as well shut it written right now found a lot and rejoice and what has a daughter of God amen praise the Lord in everything that you do bless him and thank him with all your heart amen because he that is in you is greater than all the problems around the earth don't don't let it TV and things that we see on the news affects you don't let the riots and those political issues affect you you've got something greater in you and let that and that is Jesus Christ Himself let it go into power let it go into display and you take care of every situation god bless you amen glory hallelujah to the Lord amen blessed be the name of the Lord I'm closing in Paul was in prison he was jailed he couldnt have freedom of movement was restricted but his feet wasn't restricted he took painting and parchment and wrote letters and that letters became New Testament bases of the New Testament I reread so even in the your lowest ebb God can still use you when we are broken down to pieces that there's nothing good about you do everything good about you welcome to the broken pieces together and magnify his name glory hallelujah to the Lord the Lord Jesus Christ he had all the attributes in him he came on earth we know he was an atom or a prophet and women of God he came on earth to take off your sin and my son but I wanted to do a little than he has ever done so he made a statement that the son of man has no place to lay his head fowls of heaven have got nest what foxes have got hooves but a son of man he wasn't talking about physical place he slept in Peter's house he slept in Mary and Martha and you it wasn't him Lazarus house they fed him and they give me a place to sleep but I was talking about a deity dwelling in many men bad bodies because since their fallen Adam there's not been a perfect person there has not been the redemption has not taken place he's been in types in law of Moses killing lambs and bulls but the ultimate redemption hasn't taken place Adam started a Redemption by covering his wife God killed a lamb to cover them up there were all types and shadows but the ultimate redemption was when he came on Kaveri but until he died and his spirit that was in him come back into the church the mission wasn't for for yet it was select France it's not blessing so Jesus on earth was a transition a blessing because God complete blessing was to dwell in all his children glory hallelujah and dwell in me so one time Peter said Lord he was so happy with the lost Lord when the law talked about his disease is death he said he's gonna die don't don't see that I'm gonna die we are happy here with you you walk on water because of you I can walk on water why you took you can I change what time to wine why you talking about iron and Jesus said that sit and get behind me because his ultimate blessing is not just to be in a bit Jesus of Nazareth but I want to be Jesus in back but i guarante they want to be the Jesus sent by the Jack you want to be disease in sista sista tatianna brother brother but I Lou and his family and all of us they want to be that Jesus so he died on the cross and after his death look at the sovereign he saw fate he was he was disfigured so he couldn't be identified as a human being he was stripped naked there was nothing good but after that he became the lot of Lord and the king of kings and his dwelling in his church he came out to live in Peter to live in Paul to live in Braham to live in Mary to live in all the saints of God and now where is he living isn't a church house here no he doesn't live in this body but he lives in you and I the blood nahee prepared amen so his suffering ended up to become a blessing the ultimate blessing was looking for so whatever you go through know that God ordained it for you and you are more than able to go through just rejoice the moment you start to rejoice the program is over amen when you defeat yourself when you try to use this place all the time get defeated because this place can go so far but you use this guy here the Lord is the control tower it's in the heart of men and women so when he let a fit of Christ going to this plane everything is taking care of amen so God loves you and he's there for you and he's living in you and it's got more blessing than you have ever known human honest and everything God is in your life just like Jacob when he thought his son is lost forever he mono even see him I do he might seem at the other side one day he was there the same children who sued him came back and said daddy we went to buy one we went to buy food we saw Joseph Joseph but you guys brought a share that he was killed by a lion this wood to their light to their father when it's what I was grieving they didn't tell him the truth even when he was grieving they tried to comfort him but they'll handle the Lord wasn't in awe and one day Jacob who thought his son is gone her dad his son is a prime minister in Egypt and he's got a chair out to come and pick him to Egypt really and the Lord made it you know that story so things are you good through now you don't understand it overwhelm into your mind don't blame the devil leave that out of the picture the Lord opens the door the Lord closes the door the Lord does all things he do evil he create good he's the one who does all things so that the attribute in you will become manifest that it men god bless you let's be on our feet glory hallelujah shall we pray father of life we thank you for this day this
