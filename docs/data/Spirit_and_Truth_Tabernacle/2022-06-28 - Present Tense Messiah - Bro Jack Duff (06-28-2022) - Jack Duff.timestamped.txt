[46:17] this has been somewhat of a journey we
[46:19] just thank the lord for opening the door
[46:21] for her to be able to
[46:22] to go and and um
[46:24] uh very excited for and
[46:28] since jessica this morning i would just
[46:30] like to have a word of prayer over you

[46:34] and um
[46:35] we uh we're just we're happy for and you
[46:38] know even
[46:40] i think when we have um
[46:42] some of our young people to rise up to
[46:44] these levels i think it's really really
[46:46] good
[46:47] um jesus
[46:49] had a doctor with him
[46:52] a man by the name of luke
[46:55] and uh so so i mean i think it's a real
[46:58] blessing when we see it and what my
[47:00] prayer is
[47:01] is uh that as she goes forward amen into
[47:04] this next chapter of life that god will
[47:07] go with her
[47:09] man he's brought it this far and he'll
[47:10] go forward with her
[47:12] amen i know of many doctors
[47:14] they realize you know you medicine takes
[47:17] you so far
[47:18] but you still have to use your faith
[47:21] amen and
[47:22] and that's where you know sometimes a
[47:24] doctor has the opportunity uh when
[47:26] people at their and their their last my
[47:29] mom had had a doctor recently
[47:31] uh you know she was going through
[47:33] something she was a little concerned
[47:34] about it but this doctor said let me
[47:36] pray with you
[47:38] you know
[47:40] and and when the doctor said that it it
[47:42] just kind of settled the spirit like
[47:45] god you gave me a doctor that believes
[47:48] and understands that god still worked
[47:50] miracles
[47:51] and the doctors say i must still do the
[47:53] best i can
[47:54] but i know god is able
[47:57] right so so so i was just i was
[47:59] encouraged by that and we pray that the
[48:01] lord will bless you to be a doctor
[48:02] that'll be an impact
[48:04] a man to people in so many ways both
[48:07] medically and spiritually
[48:09] amen so sister jessica why don't you

[49:15] she went through it oh god and now you
[49:17] open up a door for her to be accepted

[55:06] the lamb of god
[55:11] behold the lamb of god and the two
[55:13] disciples heard him speak and they
[55:14] followed jesus
[55:17] then jesus turned and saw them following
[55:19] and saith unto them what seek ye
[55:22] they said unto him rabbi
[55:24] we're just to say being interpreted
[55:26] master
[55:28] where dwelleth thou
[55:30] he saith unto them come and see

[56:06] and when jesus beheld him he said thou
[56:09] art simon the son of jonah
[56:11] thou shalt be called cephas
[56:13] which is by interpretation
[56:16] of stone
[56:18] uh the day following jesus would go
[56:20] forth into galilee
[56:22] and findeth philip
[56:24] and saith unto him follow me

[59:30] want to take a title today
[59:33] uh present tense messiah
[59:37] amen and you know a few years ago
[59:41] there was a
[59:43] testimony that went out that um i was
[59:45] blessed by brother dave musgrove was
[59:47] sharing the testimony of how
[59:50] somehow
[59:51] i don't remember all the details but i
[59:53] remember there was a a jewish man that
[59:55] called him
[59:57] and began to ask questions about the
[59:59] message and everything like that and
[1:00:01] brother dave had a wonderful wonderful
[1:00:03] uh
[1:00:04] fellowship with him and i think in the
[1:00:05] midst of this fellowship he had
[1:00:07] mentioned
[1:00:08] uh something about present tense messiah
[1:00:10] and and i took that and i just kind of
[1:00:12] wrote it down and i've been holding on
[1:00:14] to it for a little bit and just just
[1:00:16] kind of waiting for the right time to
[1:00:18] just kind of share
[1:00:19] and uh you know and just just this week
[1:00:22] i was listening to a sermon
[1:00:24] and brother branham had made a statement
[1:00:27] there in the sermon that
[1:00:29] caused me to go back here and i was
[1:00:31] listening to the sermon crisis
[1:00:32] identified the same in all generations
[1:00:37] there's a message
[1:00:39] in the title of the sermon
[1:00:41] christ is identified the same
[1:00:44] in all generations amen so when we look
[1:00:47] back in scripture we see christ
[1:00:49] manifesting himself uh you know through
[1:00:51] uh those that have gone before us but
[1:00:53] now it's our time on the earth amen and
[1:00:57] jesus is the same yesterday today and
[1:00:59] forever so uh you know he we will see
[1:01:02] him manifest it even during our time
[1:01:04] glory to god so you know as um um uh i
[1:01:08] was just kind of reflecting on that um i
[1:01:11] wanted to you know just kind of maybe
[1:01:13] start here brother branham preached a
[1:01:15] sermon called the messiah
[1:01:18] and uh when he when he took his text in
[1:01:21] this particular sermon uh i'm going to a
[1:01:24] paragraph 13 on the messiah there is
[1:01:27] where i'm headed uh when he took his
[1:01:29] texts uh for this sermon the messiah
[1:01:32] i
[1:01:33] i noticed that he picked up out of john
[1:01:36] 1
[1:01:36] a man and he picked up out of john
[1:01:39] four
[1:01:40] and uh and he took his text and i said
[1:01:42] wow you know that is just um
[1:01:45] a blessing you know for me just to kind
[1:01:47] of see the prophet just kind of uh go
[1:01:49] there and and let me before i just i
[1:01:51] don't want to get ahead of myself uh let
[1:01:53] me just kind of just start with this
[1:01:55] little quote here and and that'll slow
[1:01:57] me down a little bit so i don't just
[1:01:59] just empty it all out in in about two
[1:02:02] minutes uh so so here this paragraph um
[1:02:06] 13 i'm actually kind of reading the very
[1:02:09] bottom of the paragraph here uh he's
[1:02:12] just reading the scriptures and i'm just
[1:02:13] coming like to the last part of this
[1:02:15] paragraph and he makes this statement
[1:02:18] amen he says i want to take
[1:02:22] five letter word from there for a text
[1:02:27] now he said five letter but it's
[1:02:29] actually seven letters amen it says m e
[1:02:32] s s i a s
[1:02:35] messiah right it says i want my subject
[1:02:38] tonight to be around the word
[1:02:41] the messiah it says the word itself
[1:02:43] means
[1:02:45] the anointed one
[1:02:47] hallelujah
[1:02:48] or it could be used
[1:02:51] the anointed
[1:02:53] king
[1:02:54] thank you jesus
[1:02:55] amen and it also means
[1:02:58] christ
[1:02:59] but we're going to use it uh first in
[1:03:03] this thought of the anointed king
[1:03:06] amen so when we we're talking about this
[1:03:08] messiah uh uh it's the anointed
[1:03:13] king glory to god brother branham is
[1:03:15] taking it from that from that angle and
[1:03:17] you know and for me uh when i hear when
[1:03:19] i just look at that that particular
[1:03:21] statement my my uh mind
[1:03:24] quickly goes to david amen because david
[1:03:27] was
[1:03:28] an anointed king actually i like to call
[1:03:30] him the pre-anointed king amen and he
[1:03:33] was anointed by the prophet i'm i'm take
[1:03:35] you can take that down says uh he was
[1:03:37] anointed by the prophet and um you know
[1:03:40] and before he actually came into his
[1:03:43] position
[1:03:44] he had already received his anointing
[1:03:47] oh glory to god amen before he actually
[1:03:51] became physical king
[1:03:54] hey i love this thought amen before he
[1:03:57] became physical king he had already
[1:03:59] received his anointing and with the
[1:04:01] anointing there was nothing
[1:04:04] that could take david out before he came
[1:04:07] to the manifestation
[1:04:09] of his
[1:04:10] anointing oh i want you to understand
[1:04:13] something today you have been
[1:04:15] pre-anointed for a specific purpose
[1:04:18] and there is nothing
[1:04:21] that can take you out until you come
[1:04:23] into the very purpose and plan that god
[1:04:26] has for your life
[1:04:29] you might have your own plan for your
[1:04:31] life but god somehow is gonna make all
[1:04:33] things work together for his good
[1:04:36] amen it's for his purpose
[1:04:39] hallelujah it's his breath that we
[1:04:41] breathe
[1:04:42] and we pour out our praise we pour out
[1:04:44] our praise
[1:04:45] amen because it's it's what he has done
[1:04:48] for us and this anointing is nothing
[1:04:51] amen it was nothing that david could do
[1:04:52] for himself the prophet was sent to
[1:04:55] david to give him the anointing even
[1:04:58] when nobody believed in him
[1:05:00] nobody believed in him even his daddy
[1:05:02] didn't believe in him but but yet yet uh
[1:05:05] god believed in him and i want to tell
[1:05:07] you god has believed in you
[1:05:09] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen
[1:05:14] you have already received your anointing
[1:05:16] for what god
[1:05:17] amen is calling you to
[1:05:20] hey
[1:05:21] thank you jesus
[1:05:22] all right let me go a little further
[1:05:24] here amen in this sermon uh go wake
[1:05:27] jesus
[1:05:28] uh we we're talking about present tense
[1:05:31] messiah amen let me let me try to
[1:05:35] coast just a little bit
[1:05:37] look at this now he says this in the
[1:05:38] sermon go wake jesus
[1:05:40] he says they should have known these
[1:05:42] disciples
[1:05:43] that he was
[1:05:45] the messiah
[1:05:46] and the word messiah means the anointed
[1:05:50] one
[1:05:50] see he says he had all god in him
[1:05:55] god was in him he said jesus the son
[1:05:58] said i do nothing in myself but what i
[1:06:00] see the father doeth the father dwelleth
[1:06:03] in me
[1:06:04] says now he was messiah by that with
[1:06:07] that anointing made him fully messiah
[1:06:10] and we
[1:06:12] praise god with the same spirit
[1:06:16] was upon him
[1:06:17] not in portion but the same hymn uh the
[1:06:20] same uh him fully messiah we with the
[1:06:23] same spirit was upon him not important
[1:06:24] but the same quality with a portion upon
[1:06:27] us would make us like messiahs
[1:06:31] hey man
[1:06:33] it would make us like messiahs
[1:06:36] would be little sons of god
[1:06:39] amen i don't care whether i was a big
[1:06:42] son of god
[1:06:43] or a little son of god amen what remains
[1:06:47] constant is that i am a son of god
[1:06:54] hallelujah
[1:06:55] amen let's put let's tell that devil he
[1:06:57] is a liar
[1:06:59] and he cannot hold any accusation
[1:07:02] against us
[1:07:03] even in our failures we are still sons
[1:07:08] we're still daughters
[1:07:12] glory to god amen
[1:07:15] amen
[1:07:16] even though adam partook of the tree
[1:07:19] it didn't change his status
[1:07:22] it might have changed just his dwelling
[1:07:24] place but it didn't change his status
[1:07:26] his status was he was still a son of god
[1:07:30] glory to god all right now amen look at
[1:07:33] this he says the same quality with a
[1:07:35] portion upon us would make us like
[1:07:37] little messiahs would be little sons of
[1:07:40] god adopted
[1:07:43] sons of god and his holy spirit has
[1:07:46] sealed us into his body and we are his
[1:07:50] children
[1:07:51] amen there should nothing bother us
[1:07:54] nothing worry us we're his
[1:07:58] if it ain't we're we're foster uh uh
[1:08:01] we're false accusers we've been
[1:08:03] testifying to something that's not even
[1:08:05] so i believe it i believe that now
[1:08:09] we are
[1:08:10] the sons of god not we will be
[1:08:14] glory to god
[1:08:15] now
[1:08:17] not uh right now and now we're seated
[1:08:20] together in heavenly places in christ
[1:08:21] jesus amen now it goes on a little
[1:08:23] further here and let me before i before
[1:08:26] i i i get that uh this next um
[1:08:30] statement here
[1:08:31] um
[1:08:32] i know i can i can go for it he says uh
[1:08:35] we don't have any power
[1:08:37] but we we have authority

[1:08:41] glory to god someone said you you got
[1:08:44] any power no but i got authority

[1:09:23] ghost

[1:09:26] and box kossia's letters with education
[1:09:30] but he has got authority from god that

[1:13:59] moses
[1:14:01] with that word speaking what was to be
[1:14:04] later put behind badger skin
[1:14:06] so that so is christ our moses
[1:14:09] christ is our moses he was god veiled in
[1:14:14] human flesh
[1:14:15] veiled in humanity and flesh that's
[1:14:17] right and he's the same yesterday the
[1:14:20] day and forever he was veiled by badger
[1:14:22] skins he was veiled and this time he was
[1:14:25] veiled in a man
[1:14:26] see now notice saying yesterday today
[1:14:29] and forever promised his word uh to this
[1:14:31] age he is still christ the promised word
[1:14:35] to this age amen veiled in human flesh
[1:14:39] the word is god
[1:14:41] look at this next statement the
[1:14:43] anointing is a person
[1:14:46] amen
[1:14:48] hallelujah
[1:14:50] amen we're talking about christ the
[1:14:52] anointed one the anointing is a person
[1:14:56] the word christ means an anointed one
[1:14:59] the anointed one then moses
[1:15:03] was christ in his day he was the
[1:15:06] anointed one
[1:15:08] glory to god jeremiah
[1:15:11] was christ in his days a man with a
[1:15:15] portion of the word for that day
[1:15:18] hallelujah but when jesus came he came
[1:15:21] as the redeemer anointed one and that
[1:15:24] was what uh and and uh and that was both
[1:15:26] moses and all that was in moses and all
[1:15:28] the word and all the godhead volley was
[1:15:31] in him that's the reason the whole
[1:15:33] temple of el rent and the mercy seat
[1:15:34] come in perfect view he was the anointed
[1:15:37] one now i just love the way brother
[1:15:39] branham is just kind of uh sharing this
[1:15:42] he said moses was christ in his day
[1:15:46] then he picked up jeremiah jeremiah was
[1:15:49] christ in his day he could have kept
[1:15:52] going isaiah would have been christ in
[1:15:55] his day daniel would have been christ in
[1:15:58] his day
[1:15:59] praise god malachi would have been
[1:16:02] christ in his day
[1:16:04] glory to god amen you can just go on and
[1:16:08] on and on throughout the scriptures pick
[1:16:10] up those old testament prophets they
[1:16:12] would have been christ for their day
[1:16:15] and that thought did not stop in the old
[1:16:18] testament
[1:16:19] amen it kept moving through the new
[1:16:21] testament when christ came himself
[1:16:24] amen he was christ of every day
[1:16:28] it was his anointing that was there
[1:16:29] among the prophets in the old testament
[1:16:31] it's his anointing that it's in the
[1:16:33] church even right now
[1:16:36] hey we would have said paul would have
[1:16:38] been christ in his day
[1:16:40] iranians would have been christ in his
[1:16:42] day luther wesley martin amen christ in
[1:16:45] their day
[1:16:47] brother branham would have been christ
[1:16:49] the anointing would have fell on him in
[1:16:52] his day
[1:16:53] but he's not here anymore
[1:16:57] but christ is still here
[1:16:59] and where is he veiled behind skin
[1:17:02] our skin praise god messiahs
[1:17:06] for this day
[1:17:08] [Music]
[1:17:10] oh glory to god
[1:17:12] amen i i i'm so glad i know who i am
[1:17:18] here you know
[1:17:19] people are always looking for the
[1:17:20] messiah
[1:17:21] they're looking for the anointing
[1:17:24] people looking for the anointing because
[1:17:26] it's the anointing that breaks the yoke
[1:17:28] it's the anointing that that that sets
[1:17:30] the captives free
[1:17:32] right uh you know uh many many would
[1:17:34] show up to brother branham's meetings
[1:17:36] and mighty they do on scheme and do all
[1:17:38] kind of other things to get prayer cards
[1:17:40] they want to get before that anointing
[1:17:43] hallelujah you know and um it ought to
[1:17:46] be the same today that there should be
[1:17:47] such an anointing in the church that
[1:17:49] people want to come
[1:17:52] not only that people want to come amen i
[1:17:54] believe the church has got to be in a
[1:17:55] healthy enough
[1:17:57] condition where you would want to invite
[1:17:59] people to your church
[1:18:01] glory to god come go to church with me
[1:18:04] see this is what happened with these
[1:18:05] brothers
[1:18:06] amen uh as we were reading there in the
[1:18:09] scripture
[1:18:10] um you know i just i just kind of love
[1:18:13] this we know the the woman at the well
[1:18:16] was full of sin
[1:18:18] this lady had a life that was full of
[1:18:19] sin as she was going to the well she
[1:18:22] actually could not go at the same time
[1:18:25] that the other women went out
[1:18:27] uh her being a prostitute living a
[1:18:30] ungodly life
[1:18:32] hallelujah now she might have been
[1:18:33] living an ungodly life but on the inside
[1:18:36] of this lady she actually wanted to be
[1:18:39] right sometimes you don't know how
[1:18:41] people end up in the positions that
[1:18:43] they're in
[1:18:45] that's why we can't be so quick to judge
[1:18:47] people
[1:18:48] we don't know how they got there you
[1:18:49] don't know you don't know where they
[1:18:50] come from
[1:18:52] hey man you amen if their seat of god we
[1:18:54] know where they're going but we don't
[1:18:56] know where they came from but here this
[1:18:58] woman's you know she had um
[1:19:00] this this life that was ungodly and um
[1:19:03] you know as she actually comes to the
[1:19:05] well that day and maybe just an ordinary
[1:19:08] day for her just another day she shows
[1:19:11] up in the well here's this man said give
[1:19:12] me something to drink now she never
[1:19:14] heard this pickup line before
[1:19:17] she heard this one before and so she was
[1:19:20] like she began to have a conversation
[1:19:21] with him it's like you know look you
[1:19:23] know um i'm samaritan you jew we don't
[1:19:26] even have anything to do with one
[1:19:27] another
[1:19:28] he said you know uh uh you know y'all
[1:19:31] say y'all need to worship over there and
[1:19:33] we say you worship over here and we
[1:19:35] don't have anything to do that
[1:19:36] segregation between our people no we
[1:19:38] don't have anything to do with one
[1:19:39] another he said you know uh you know if
[1:19:41] you knew who you was talking to
[1:19:43] you would be asking me for something to
[1:19:45] drink
[1:19:46] oh well wait a minute i heard nobody use
[1:19:48] no line like that before now now uh uh
[1:19:52] it's they say not in the water that i
[1:19:53] give
[1:19:54] you won't thirst again
[1:19:56] you're never thirsty and like wait a
[1:19:59] minute what kind of water is this
[1:20:01] so so he began to talk to him and she
[1:20:03] got a little desperate saying i want
[1:20:05] some of that water
[1:20:06] amen you say you got this what i need to
[1:20:08] have some of that water
[1:20:10] and he said now before you can get this
[1:20:12] water
[1:20:13] we got to deal with just one little
[1:20:15] thing
[1:20:16] say go get your husband and bring him
[1:20:18] here she's saying i don't have a husband
[1:20:20] he's saying you speak well he's saying
[1:20:23] he said you don't have five and the one
[1:20:24] you're living with right now is not your
[1:20:26] husband
[1:20:28] he said he's she said she say now now we
[1:20:32] know
[1:20:33] when messiah come
[1:20:35] he gonna tell us these things
[1:20:38] and he said and he said this
[1:20:40] and he said he said i am he that speaks
[1:20:42] to you
[1:20:43] glory to god and when that lady
[1:20:45] recognized she had been looking for the
[1:20:47] messiah she heard it in sunday school it
[1:20:49] was a promise that was a man that was
[1:20:51] dwelling in her and she couldn't wait to
[1:20:54] run into the messiah and here she had a
[1:20:56] purge so no one-on-one conversation with
[1:21:00] the messiah
[1:21:03] he says i mean that speech you see took
[1:21:05] off running dropped a water pot didn't
[1:21:07] care about other disciples coming seeing
[1:21:09] her talking to jesus she took off
[1:21:11] running into the city come see a man
[1:21:14] that's told me the things that i've done
[1:21:17] now now what what identified him as a
[1:21:20] messiah his messiah sign
[1:21:23] was that he could tell her these things
[1:21:25] about herself without even knowing her
[1:21:28] that was the messiahic sign
[1:21:32] [Music]
[1:21:34] oh hallelujah i want y'all to know that
[1:21:36] sometimes y'all walk into the church
[1:21:39] and y'all just dealt with something at
[1:21:41] home the week before
[1:21:43] and god begins to pick up right out of
[1:21:45] the pulpit the things that you just
[1:21:47] dealt with
[1:21:48] walk right into some of your
[1:21:50] conversations speak word for word
[1:21:55] hey man what about when uh brother ernie
[1:21:58] villanueva came here
[1:22:00] and was sick as i don't know what i was
[1:22:02] so afraid of the brother preaching i
[1:22:04] didn't know what was going on inside of
[1:22:05] brother ernie but he said brother jack i
[1:22:07] need to preach i want to preach i want
[1:22:09] to i said well let
[1:22:11] let me just read the scriptures for you
[1:22:12] he said you can read them but let me
[1:22:14] preach walked out here and said the
[1:22:16] exact same thing i said the week before
[1:22:19] messiah sign is in our midst
[1:22:22] amen
[1:22:26] i just love this but when that lady
[1:22:28] could identify with the messiah sign it
[1:22:30] changed her life
[1:22:32] and when you can identify
[1:22:34] with the messiah sign
[1:22:37] it will change your life
[1:22:41] them brothers
[1:22:43] amen over in john 1
[1:22:45] that we were reading about and and here
[1:22:47] they now i love this because they were
[1:22:49] following a prophet
[1:22:53] glory
[1:22:54] uh
[1:22:55] andrew
[1:22:57] they heard uh john say
[1:23:00] behold the lamb of god and evidently it
[1:23:03] must not have said it to everybody but
[1:23:05] these fellows heard what john said and
[1:23:08] when they when when they heard it glory
[1:23:10] to god amen they took off they left john
[1:23:14] and they took off the fall of christ
[1:23:17] and they said now where you where you
[1:23:18] sleeping at jesus said well come and see
[1:23:21] and when that when they got there and uh
[1:23:23] you know and began to uh you know just
[1:23:25] kind of fellowship with him and and
[1:23:27] everything andrew got a little excited
[1:23:30] andrew said now i can't hold this to
[1:23:32] myself it says i gotta go tell my
[1:23:35] brother and he went and got peter
[1:23:37] glory to god and when he brought peter
[1:23:39] he said he any and i just love the way
[1:23:42] uh he did it i just kind of wrote this
[1:23:44] note down
[1:23:45] amen uh andrew and told peter that we
[1:23:48] have found the messiah the anointed one
[1:23:51] glory glory glory and here's the thing
[1:23:54] that i want you to catch amen uh when
[1:23:57] they found the messiah not only did
[1:23:59] andrew find messiah another one philip
[1:24:01] found nathaniel we read that philip
[1:24:03] found the things that we found him of
[1:24:05] whom moses in the law and the prophets
[1:24:07] did uh write of jesus of nazareth the
[1:24:10] son of joseph
[1:24:11] now i like that because uh i put this
[1:24:14] they were not afraid
[1:24:16] to put a name to the fulfillment of
[1:24:19] scripture
[1:24:22] hey they were not afraid in their day
[1:24:26] to put a name with the fulfillment of
[1:24:29] scripture
[1:24:31] we have found the messiah
[1:24:33] what is his name jesus of nazareth
[1:24:37] do you mean the crazy man no to them
[1:24:40] he's crazy but to me messiah
[1:24:44] he's the fulfillment of the scripture
[1:24:48] what moses wrote about that's what we
[1:24:50] found
[1:24:52] glory to god i love this church because
[1:24:54] see you know here here john points them
[1:24:56] to jesus
[1:24:57] and we had a prophet that we not we're
[1:24:59] not we're not ashamed to identify his
[1:25:02] name with the fulfillment of scripture
[1:25:04] malachi 4 assigned to william marion
[1:25:07] branham
[1:25:08] revelation 10 7 assigned to william
[1:25:11] marion branham
[1:25:12] glory to god we're not ashamed to
[1:25:14] connect his name to the scripture
[1:25:19] glory
[1:25:20] amen i got some more scriptures here to
[1:25:22] read for you a little bit later on and i
[1:25:24] hope you can put your name in the
[1:25:26] scripture
[1:25:28] all right all right here you know they
[1:25:30] say we found messiah and again that
[1:25:32] messiah sign
[1:25:34] was demonstrated
[1:25:36] he told peter his name had never met him
[1:25:39] and they said we're gonna call you he
[1:25:41] says you know uh uh we're gonna call you
[1:25:44] little stone cephas which meant little
[1:25:46] stone with peter right there was a
[1:25:48] little note that i had here
[1:25:50] in my bible
[1:25:51] let me just see if i can just catch this
[1:25:53] really quick for you
[1:25:55] forgot to write this one down
[1:25:57] um
[1:25:59] okay i might not have it here but um
[1:26:03] actually his name that that name um
[1:26:06] let's say that we you know you we found
[1:26:08] uh you you're not going to be peter
[1:26:09] anymore i mean you're not going to be uh
[1:26:11] it says
[1:26:13] thou art simon
[1:26:15] that name simon actually had a a a a a
[1:26:17] meaning you know something like uh
[1:26:20] like rough and rugged
[1:26:22] uh personality something like that but
[1:26:24] but peter meant stone
[1:26:26] and made him solid
[1:26:28] right stable that's what that's what
[1:26:31] peter meant stable so when he changed
[1:26:33] his name it made him stable and you
[1:26:34] remember when when they um when when
[1:26:37] when it when when the the soldiers came
[1:26:39] to take jesus away that nature
[1:26:45] that that that old nature that was in
[1:26:47] peter
[1:26:48] rose up that's why jesus had to change
[1:26:51] his name right because there was a
[1:26:53] nature that was associated with that
[1:26:54] name and that nature rose up he was the
[1:26:56] one who picked up a sword and chopped
[1:26:58] the man's head off
[1:26:59] well he chopped his ear off he was
[1:27:01] trying to chop his head off
[1:27:03] but he missed and chopped his ear off
[1:27:06] my god but but it showed the nature that
[1:27:08] was there so he had to change his name
[1:27:10] from from simon to peter
[1:27:14] hallelujah
[1:27:16] all right all right all right all right
[1:27:18] all right
[1:27:19] but when when nathaniel
[1:27:21] uh was found by philip and then they
[1:27:23] think this behold the israelite on whom
[1:27:25] there is no guile that was the messiah
[1:27:27] sign being demonstrated amen right
[1:27:30] before the very eyes this is why they
[1:27:32] can say we have found the messiah the
[1:27:35] one moses was speaking of
[1:27:37] now let's go back and pick up moses
[1:27:39] deuteronomy 18.
[1:27:42] thank you jesus deuteronomy 18. you got
[1:27:45] to see how scripture is being
[1:27:47] fulfilled
[1:27:49] and it's one thing to see it fulfill in
[1:27:51] a day gone by but it's another thing to
[1:27:53] see it fulfilled in your
[1:27:58] day deuteronomy 18.
[1:28:03] this is the promise that moses was
[1:28:04] leaving amen with the children of israel
[1:28:07] and they waited for years for this to be
[1:28:08] manifested
[1:28:10] when the church listened to the rabbis
[1:28:12] uh teach teacher the priest teacher on
[1:28:14] it waited for years and then finally
[1:28:16] jesus shows up and say oh this is the
[1:28:18] messiah this is the fulfillment of what
[1:28:21] moses spoke about look the lord thy god
[1:28:25] will raise up unto thee a prophet
[1:28:29] from the midst of thee of thy brethren
[1:28:31] like unto me unto him ye shall hearken
[1:28:36] this was the very scripture that they
[1:28:37] were pointing to now i want to go
[1:28:39] forward in here because i can just stop
[1:28:41] that right there but i want to go
[1:28:42] forward because you know there's many
[1:28:44] people that take the rest of this verse
[1:28:47] amen and they use it as justification to
[1:28:50] stop following the message
[1:28:56] and completely misunderstanding
[1:28:58] right
[1:28:59] you you got to watch see it's one thing
[1:29:02] a man uh
[1:29:04] it's one thing to try to use a scripture
[1:29:06] to justify yourself in these things but
[1:29:09] if you i mean but but when you're using
[1:29:11] in in the way that you're using it then
[1:29:13] you have to apply it the same way in
[1:29:15] every circumstance
[1:29:17] hallelujah that ought to let you know
[1:29:18] that wait a minute if it don't apply
[1:29:20] this in this circumstance amen then i
[1:29:23] can't use it like that now you can't use
[1:29:25] it to try to go against brother branham
[1:29:27] and then not not also take the same
[1:29:29] thing and point it at moses
[1:29:31] let's go let's let's read this let's
[1:29:34] read it all right it says verse 16
[1:29:36] according to all that thou desirest of
[1:29:39] the lord thy god and horut in the day of
[1:29:41] the assembly
[1:29:43] saying let me not hear again the voice
[1:29:44] of the lord my god neither let me see
[1:29:46] this great fire anymore that i die not
[1:29:49] it says when the lord said unto me they
[1:29:51] have well spoken that which they have
[1:29:53] spoken
[1:29:54] i will raise them up a prophet
[1:29:58] from among their brethren
[1:30:00] like unto thee and will put my words in
[1:30:03] his mouth and he shall speak unto them
[1:30:05] all that i shall command him now here's
[1:30:08] another thing i want you to get because
[1:30:10] there's a there's this other little
[1:30:12] teaching especially when it comes to the
[1:30:13] book of malachi i think the very first
[1:30:16] few verses there in the book of first in
[1:30:18] malachi it says something to the the
[1:30:20] house of israel
[1:30:22] right it speaks something like that uh
[1:30:24] and most people interpret it
[1:30:26] as saying with this amen this particular
[1:30:29] book this whole chapter is for the jews
[1:30:32] is that right all right so we go back to
[1:30:35] the ten commandments are you telling me
[1:30:37] that's only for the jews
[1:30:40] right amen and the other thing i'm gonna
[1:30:43] tell you that you're not gonna take from
[1:30:44] me i'm gonna go back to malachi because
[1:30:47] i'm a faithful top pair and he told me
[1:30:49] he gonna rebuke the devil for my sake
[1:30:51] are you telling me that promise is only
[1:30:53] for the jews well i'm here to tell you
[1:30:55] too late
[1:30:56] because i'm walking in that promise i'm
[1:30:59] living in that every day
[1:31:02] i don't see them rebuke to devour for my
[1:31:04] sake
[1:31:05] you can't tell me that's not for me
[1:31:08] right so you just can't hack up the word
[1:31:10] of god and say part of it is for us part
[1:31:12] of us not not no it's all for us
[1:31:15] god just used the juice in order to get
[1:31:17] these promises through them
[1:31:20] gentiles have always been on his mind
[1:31:22] hallelujah
[1:31:24] glory to god with the apple of his eye
[1:31:27] amen but he had to use somebody he
[1:31:29] started with the jews
[1:31:31] glory to god but it just keeps flowing
[1:31:32] even in this scripture i'm sharing yes
[1:31:35] jesus christ was the very fulfillment of
[1:31:38] that scripture but i want to tell you
[1:31:39] scripture has a compound meaning
[1:31:43] brother branham's ministry was also like
[1:31:45] moses ministry
[1:31:46] paul's ministry was also like moses
[1:31:48] ministry
[1:31:50] glory to god
[1:31:51] all right let me just keep going you
[1:31:53] know god gave uh moses a revelation on
[1:31:57] the back side of the desert he gave paul
[1:31:59] a revelation
[1:32:00] on the backside desert and where was
[1:32:02] brother branham amen when he got the
[1:32:04] commission to go and preach the seven
[1:32:05] seals
[1:32:06] desert
[1:32:09] all right
[1:32:10] all right let me keep going
[1:32:12] verse
[1:32:14] 18 i will raise him up a prophet
[1:32:17] from among their brethren like unto thee
[1:32:18] and will put my words in his mouth and
[1:32:21] he should speak unto them all that i
[1:32:23] shall command him
[1:32:24] and it shall come to pass that whosoever
[1:32:26] will not hearken unto my words which
[1:32:28] will not hearken unto my words which he
[1:32:30] shall speak in my name now who's doing
[1:32:32] the speaking
[1:32:34] is god speaking through the man
[1:32:36] these this is this was god speaking
[1:32:38] through the man glory says
[1:32:41] he says but the prophet
[1:32:44] i'm sorry verse 19 and it shall come to
[1:32:46] pass that whosoever will not hearken
[1:32:48] unto my words which he shall speak in my
[1:32:51] name i'll require it of him there's
[1:32:54] judgment if you reject the prophet
[1:32:56] right it says but the prophet which
[1:32:59] shall presume to speak a word in my name
[1:33:02] which i have not commanded him to speak
[1:33:04] or that shall speak in the name of other
[1:33:06] gods even that prophet shall die
[1:33:09] watch and if thou say in thine heart how
[1:33:12] shall we know the word which the lord
[1:33:15] hath not spoken it says when a prophet
[1:33:17] speaketh in the name of the lord if the
[1:33:20] thing followeth follow not
[1:33:22] nor come to pass
[1:33:24] that is the thing which the lord have
[1:33:25] not spoken but the prophet has spoken it
[1:33:27] presumptuously thou shalt not be afraid
[1:33:29] of him people are using this to justify
[1:33:32] leaving because brother random said he
[1:33:34] was going to get a bear and he didn't
[1:33:35] get the bear
[1:33:38] what that guy do what that got to do
[1:33:39] with the word
[1:33:40] right ain't got nothing to do with the
[1:33:42] word right and what he did was i mean
[1:33:44] and and i have to tell him say now now
[1:33:46] you know moses
[1:33:48] the very guy that told us
[1:33:50] that if a man spoke something that
[1:33:52] didn't come to pass don't hear him well
[1:33:54] moses was told that he was the one to
[1:33:57] lead the children out of egypt and into
[1:34:00] the promised land now people say well
[1:34:01] now i'm not exactly into the prophecy so
[1:34:04] what you're saying is that moses will
[1:34:06] lead them to the wilderness
[1:34:08] was that god's promise to lead them to
[1:34:10] the wilderness or to the promised land
[1:34:13] and say now if moses even though it did
[1:34:15] not specifically say to the promised
[1:34:18] land it was intended that moses was
[1:34:21] going to take the people to the promised
[1:34:23] land how do we know it was intended
[1:34:25] because when moses struck the rock twice
[1:34:28] his punishment
[1:34:32] his very punishment was that he could
[1:34:35] not go into the promised land
[1:34:38] why was that his punishment if god never
[1:34:41] intended for him to go
[1:34:46] see sometimes we get a little bit too

[1:44:26] for my sister and and they told us that
[1:44:28] she was gonna be in that condition for
[1:44:29] for a long time but he went and prayed
[1:44:31] one simple prayer within a day she was
[1:44:34] out of there and been free ever since
[1:44:36] it says free to the day she died yeah we
[1:44:38] remember him very well he was a he was a
[1:44:40] very very wonderful man of god
[1:44:42] and uh he said you know also he made a
[1:44:44] comment that he used to go with your

[1:44:49] anything about that
[1:44:50] and i said yeah yeah she know you know
[1:44:52] she did tell us that you know before she
[1:44:54] had us that day she used to date brother
[1:44:57] branham he said he said she said you
[1:44:59] know why he broke up with
[1:45:01] my mama
[1:45:04] he said she said you ain't gonna believe
[1:45:05] this why he actually stopped dating my
[1:45:07] mama
[1:45:08] he said he told he the reason he stopped
[1:45:11] dating my mom was because she was
[1:45:12] wearing fingernail polish
[1:45:19] the prophecy i cannot have this woman
[1:45:21] for my wife
[1:45:25] went and prayed for her daughter
[1:45:27] but you can't be my wife
[1:45:32] let me finish reading
[1:45:38] [Music]
[1:45:39] we don't have time to lay too much of it
[1:45:41] tonight because we just got a few
[1:45:43] minutes left
[1:45:45] notice the word that's ordained for each
[1:45:47] age
[1:45:48] when that word is made manifest that is
[1:45:50] christ for that day
[1:45:53] just like it was in each of these days
[1:45:56] now we find
[1:45:57] a man jesus coming on the scene he was
[1:46:00] rejected yet he was the promised word
[1:46:02] now in deuteronomy 18 15
[1:46:05] most said the lord your god shall raise
[1:46:06] up a prophet like me
[1:46:08] and it shall come to pass that whosoever
[1:46:10] whosoever shall not hear this prophet
[1:46:13] will be cut off from among the people
[1:46:15] now there he was exactly the prophet for
[1:46:18] that age and the teachers of that day
[1:46:20] didn't see it
[1:46:22] they finally put him to death
[1:46:24] see and he done just exactly
[1:46:27] he was born of a virgin they didn't
[1:46:29] believe that
[1:46:30] that was a bunch of fanaticism
[1:46:33] but we believe it now
[1:46:35] after it's been proven
[1:46:37] and that's the problem people don't come
[1:46:39] to believe in this message after has
[1:46:41] been proven
[1:46:42] right and you know look uh i i can't i
[1:46:45] can't i cannot understand how
[1:46:48] um
[1:46:49] people have fallen away from this
[1:46:50] message
[1:46:52] and um uh i can't see how their hearts
[1:46:55] did not change after our last
[1:46:58] presidential election
[1:47:02] ain't no way i mean a prophet spoke this
[1:47:05] 80-something years before it happened
[1:47:07] and here it comes walking right before
[1:47:09] we live to see it
[1:47:13] and like you like you didn't remember
[1:47:14] that you didn't remember that that
[1:47:16] prophecy
[1:47:18] like you didn't remember that one
[1:47:21] you know that was nothing but god and
[1:47:23] let me tell you something since that
[1:47:25] time this time it's god's grace that's
[1:47:27] still going out to try to get people
[1:47:32] amen all right let's listen
[1:47:35] um i got i got i got a few things to
[1:47:37] read let me just y'all bear with me
[1:47:40] the sign of discernment
[1:47:42] was the messiah sign that's what that's
[1:47:44] what uh uh and andrew and peter they
[1:47:47] thank you philip all of them they saw
[1:47:49] that sign of discernment even that woman
[1:47:51] at the well saw the sign of discernment
[1:47:54] that was the messiah sign
[1:47:56] and i'm telling you we saw it and we
[1:47:58] heard it in brother branham's ministry
[1:48:01] amen and we all also have experienced it
[1:48:03] here while here while a word is being
[1:48:05] preached god has discerned conversations
[1:48:08] and home experiences and provided
[1:48:10] strength and guidance through his preach
[1:48:12] word
[1:48:14] the messiah sign is still on display
[1:48:17] amen amen look at this now
[1:48:23] i am trying to get through this
[1:48:28] look at this i want to go to questions
[1:48:30] and answers
[1:48:32] part three
[1:48:34] we saw it in brother branham's ministry
[1:48:36] now we're not here to exalt brother
[1:48:37] branham
[1:48:40] but we are exalting christ
[1:48:42] and we're showing you how christ was
[1:48:44] manifested through he's the manifest to
[1:48:46] work for his ministry was a manifested
[1:48:48] word for this day
[1:48:50] same thing
[1:48:51] we've become manifest the word for our
[1:48:53] day now look at this look at this this
[1:48:55] question that's being asked
[1:48:56] and questions and answers part three
[1:48:58] says please explain
[1:49:00] people are saying
[1:49:02] brother branham is more than a man
[1:49:05] he can create
[1:49:07] and jesus can look just like brother
[1:49:09] branham
[1:49:10] brother ramsay this is what people are
[1:49:11] saying so this is a question that comes
[1:49:13] up it says now the person said this
[1:49:15] whoever it might be i don't know
[1:49:17] but i'm your brother
[1:49:20] see jesus is your savior
[1:49:22] i cannot be your savior for he has
[1:49:24] already saved you
[1:49:27] now look at this now you're so close to
[1:49:30] being the truth there
[1:49:32] and yet so far from the truth
[1:49:35] so we kind of trying to get right in the
[1:49:37] middle
[1:49:39] in the middle uh we don't want people
[1:49:41] want to be fanatics but we don't want to
[1:49:43] be unbelievers either we're trying to
[1:49:45] get right in the middle
[1:49:48] you you're so close to being the truth
[1:49:50] there and yet so far from the truth
[1:49:53] the person that told this person this
[1:49:56] now looks like a woman's hand write very
[1:49:58] beautiful handwriting did not say that
[1:49:59] was a woman's hand right wouldn't you
[1:50:01] brother capps when you think that was a
[1:50:03] woman's hand right pretty hand right and
[1:50:05] i don't know who it is see says now uh
[1:50:07] brother branham
[1:50:08] now notice he just said i don't know who
[1:50:10] it is
[1:50:12] he can see the writing and he just
[1:50:15] assumed that it's the woman's
[1:50:16] handwriting he said but i don't know who
[1:50:17] wrote this you gotta understand he
[1:50:19] wouldn't know until god showed him
[1:50:23] he couldn't do nothing until god showed
[1:50:26] him
[1:50:27] any vision had to come from god
[1:50:30] that's why we worship god
[1:50:32] amen look at this
[1:50:35] now
[1:50:36] brother branham could jesus look like
[1:50:39] you or you be jesus or something like
[1:50:40] that
[1:50:41] one sense of the word
[1:50:43] that's exactly the truth
[1:50:46] another sense of the word it's and it's
[1:50:49] an antichrist it's depend on how you're
[1:50:51] leaning
[1:50:53] that's the difference between right and
[1:50:55] wrong to make me the person
[1:50:59] of the lord jesus christ would be an
[1:51:01] antichrist see for that person of the
[1:51:04] lord jesus is sitting at the right hand
[1:51:06] of majesty on high and will come again
[1:51:08] in great power and glory but for his
[1:51:10] life that was in him being upon me and
[1:51:15] upon you who have him
[1:51:17] is exactly the truth and you
[1:51:22] you
[1:51:24] become
[1:51:26] christ
[1:51:29] they didn't teach me that in my old
[1:51:31] church
[1:51:32] you become christ
[1:51:35] when uh when people are looking for
[1:51:36] messiah today
[1:51:39] they can point them to you
[1:51:42] the messiah
[1:51:44] it says you remember my message on
[1:51:46] messiah see there you are the word
[1:51:48] messiah means the anointed one now you
[1:51:50] are if you have the holy spirit you
[1:51:52] become the anointed one see
[1:51:54] then there's all kind of anointed ones
[1:51:56] now i cut that quote off there
[1:51:59] i cut that off there because this is a
[1:52:00] very long quote but i want to read just
[1:52:02] a little bit more in this amen so uh
[1:52:06] it says uh
[1:52:08] now watch if it's a bible anointed when
[1:52:11] many of them are knowing it see the
[1:52:12] whole thing in such a great
[1:52:13] conglomeration of every kind of a mix-up
[1:52:16] my and of satan with all of his
[1:52:18] cunningness and in an impersonated just
[1:52:21] to the dot almost to the dot there's
[1:52:23] only one way you can absolutely be sure
[1:52:26] check the word by word word by word
[1:52:30] that's the only way you can check it out
[1:52:32] of the scripture
[1:52:33] i believe the message because it's in
[1:52:34] the scripture
[1:52:36] amen i can read it right out of the
[1:52:38] bible what god promised amen he says but
[1:52:41] to me as a person william branham or any
[1:52:43] other man
[1:52:44] or woman to be the lord jesus christ our
[1:52:47] savior that is an error
[1:52:49] but to be anointed with his spirit
[1:52:52] which brings his own person of his life
[1:52:54] into you
[1:52:56] let's keep going
[1:52:58] it was it was uh it was so beautifully
[1:53:01] typed in elijah and elisha
[1:53:04] when elisha was taken when i was taking
[1:53:07] the uh uh taking up the elijah and the
[1:53:08] old prophet going home and he was tired
[1:53:12] and weary and there was a chariot hooked
[1:53:14] across the river there and he took him
[1:53:16] up home with horses of fire and did you
[1:53:18] notice then when elijah and elisha
[1:53:20] crossed the river the school of the
[1:53:22] prophets was up there watching him and
[1:53:24] elijah took his mantle or struck the
[1:53:27] river and when it did divide it and he
[1:53:29] went across and he said to the young
[1:53:31] prophet what are you following me for
[1:53:33] what do you wish
[1:53:39] you know i wanna i wanna just leave it
[1:53:41] there for a second
[1:53:42] even when uh john
[1:53:45] told a tor he just mumbled on his breath
[1:53:48] he says uh behold the lamb of god
[1:53:51] they were already following the words
[1:53:53] but what were they looking for when they
[1:53:56] left john and start following christ
[1:53:58] what were they looking for
[1:54:00] i can say the same thing he likes was
[1:54:02] looking for a double portion
[1:54:07] what do you wish he said that a double
[1:54:09] portion of your spirit come upon me a
[1:54:11] double portion of that mighty prophet
[1:54:13] come upon me he says you asked a hard
[1:54:15] thing but if you see me when i go away
[1:54:17] then i'll cut then it'll come upon you
[1:54:19] so you can imagine how he watched
[1:54:22] the prophet
[1:54:24] keep going
[1:54:26] says now in that day
[1:54:29] that prophet was the word
[1:54:32] for he was the manifestation of the word
[1:54:34] to the world see and he know there had
[1:54:37] to be a greater ministry
[1:54:40] come
[1:54:41] oh i'm i'm i'm just reading
[1:54:43] because they required a greater thing
[1:54:46] and when jesus was here on earth he was
[1:54:49] the elijah
[1:54:51] these things that i do say you do also
[1:54:54] greater than these shall you do because
[1:54:56] i go into my father now how you going to
[1:54:59] do it watch him who is he the word see
[1:55:02] watch them
[1:55:04] let me go on a little further
[1:55:06] now when it comes to creation of things
[1:55:09] it's true jesus
[1:55:11] never writes straight out created
[1:55:13] anything and brought it into existence
[1:55:16] he took a substance first he turned
[1:55:18] water into wine he had the substance
[1:55:20] first
[1:55:21] glory to god he took bread and
[1:55:23] multiplied it he took fish and
[1:55:25] multiplied it but actually just to
[1:55:27] create
[1:55:28] he didn't do that
[1:55:29] that was a ministry left for another day
[1:55:33] to fulfill scripture
[1:55:36] [Applause]
[1:55:40] look it was a ministry left for another
[1:55:42] day to fulfill scripture that he spoke

[2:02:20] were saved right there began to cry out
[2:02:22] underneath the anointing of the holy
[2:02:23] ghost
[2:02:24] and immediately god changed them
[2:02:27] it don't take god a long time to change

[2:02:44] that in my notes uh i was gonna skip
[2:02:46] around in this but there was something
[2:02:48] that i read in my office this morning i
[2:02:49] just wanna bring it says
[2:02:52] now when it comes to creation of things
[2:02:54] it's true jesus never writes straight
[2:02:55] out created anything and brought into
[2:02:57] existence he took a substance first he
[2:02:59] took water made wine he took bread and
[2:03:01] made more bread he took fish and made
[2:03:02] more fish but he promised that greater
[2:03:04] things than this would be done see you
[2:03:06] see now why it's it's in a more evil day
[2:03:10] than it was when he was here did y'all
[2:03:12] get that
[2:03:14] because we are living in a greater day
[2:03:17] of evil we gonna need more power
[2:03:23] so i'm telling you what to expect as you
[2:03:25] see the devil getting out of control
[2:03:28] you just expect that this gonna rise up
[2:03:30] in you
[2:03:32] when you have need of it it will be
[2:03:34] there
[2:03:37] it's more evil day than it was when he
[2:03:38] was here see it's still him but using
[2:03:41] your tabernacle

[2:04:47] y'all can go back and get that but uh go
[2:04:49] on to 110 this is where i want to go now
[2:04:51] remember we're not the word
[2:04:55] uh but we are the words
[2:05:02] remember we're not the word but we are
[2:05:04] the word
[2:05:05] right
[2:05:06] uh-huh
[2:05:08] now you gotta jesus was not god but he
[2:05:10] was god
[2:05:11] he was a man yet he was god
[2:05:13] he could cry and yet he could raise the
[2:05:15] dead he could cry for a man being dead
[2:05:18] and raise him back up again he was
[2:05:19] jehovah jairus over raphael jehovah
[2:05:21] manassas he was jehovah all completely
[2:05:24] he was jehovah and yet he was a man
[2:05:26] he owned the earth and made the earth
[2:05:28] and had not a place to lay his head
[2:05:30] all right now and they said the birds
[2:05:32] that i made has got nests and i haven't
[2:05:34] got a place to lay my head the foxes
[2:05:36] that i created has holes in the ground
[2:05:38] that i and i haven't got one myself even
[2:05:41] to be buried in that's right he had to
[2:05:44] borrow somebody's grave to be buried in
[2:05:46] he created a womb that was in a woman he
[2:05:49] had a wound to be born in he had to
[2:05:51] borrow a wound uh he had no woman to be
[2:05:53] born and he had to borrow a womb he
[2:05:54] created the earth and had not a place to
[2:05:56] be buried he had to borrow a hole in the
[2:05:58] ground to be buried and joseph of
[2:05:59] arimathea see they had to borrow a place
[2:06:03] yet he was god prove that he was god now
[2:06:05] you understand
[2:06:07] we are not then he says we are messiahs
[2:06:10] but not that jesus
[2:06:12] he is our father we're just anointed
[2:06:14] with the spirit and that's the reason
[2:06:16] it's life and that gets people see if
[2:06:19] you don't sit and think it through
[2:06:21] it gets people to believe well this guy
[2:06:23] would be the messiah
[2:06:25] sure he is
[2:06:27] this one over here could be
[2:06:30] oh see he didn't leave it on himself
[2:06:33] they would think man this guy could be
[2:06:34] the messiah sure he is it's the
[2:06:36] anointing that's on the guy
[2:06:38] that makes him a messiah and that same
[2:06:41] holy ghost anointing is dwelling inside
[2:06:42] the church
[2:06:44] amen says ashurius this one over here
[2:06:47] could be they both are and how can these
[2:06:50] be how can it be two of them there are
[2:06:52] thousands of them
[2:06:54] i i'm saying i'm so glad i can say i'm
[2:06:57] one of them
[2:06:59] thousands of them see but you see his
[2:07:02] life is separated on the day of
[2:07:04] pentecost when that pill of fire came
[2:07:06] down it separated like tongues
[2:07:09] and set upon each of them god divided
[2:07:11] himself among his people because the
[2:07:12] church and christ is one just as
[2:07:15] husband and wife
[2:07:16] is one
[2:07:17] all right
[2:07:19] i um
[2:07:20] i i had y'all just let me get
[2:07:23] one more quote and then i'm gonna leave
[2:07:24] you up with some scriptures and i'll let
[2:07:25] you go i
[2:07:26] i had some other things but i'll just
[2:07:28] out i'll forgo them i'm going back to
[2:07:31] the message of messiah going to
[2:07:32] paragraph 32.
[2:07:36] he says this
[2:07:38] no wonder elijah laid his body upon that
[2:07:40] dead baby and it come to life
[2:07:43] it was god in that man
[2:07:45] god it took over he he was anointed
[2:07:47] jesus
[2:07:48] said he was every prophet of god in the
[2:07:50] old testament was a was anointed with
[2:07:52] the holy ghost they were then they were
[2:07:54] lesser lights he was the fullness of god
[2:07:57] being messiah they was messiahs then
[2:08:00] smaller messiahs for they were anointed
[2:08:03] with the same spirit that he was
[2:08:05] anointed with only he had it in the
[2:08:06] fullness and every man today that's
[2:08:08] received the true baptism of the holy
[2:08:10] ghost is anointed with the same spirit
[2:08:13] that jesus of nazareth was that went
[2:08:15] about doing good and healing the sick oh
[2:08:17] my that makes me feel good to know he
[2:08:19] lives today
[2:08:21] look at this there's something
[2:08:23] about a man
[2:08:26] he is a god
[2:08:29] he was made
[2:08:30] to be a god
[2:08:32] his purpose here on the earth was to be
[2:08:35] a god
[2:08:37] to have a dominion over everything in
[2:08:39] the earth oh my now don't let that
[2:08:42] stagger you because i got some more
[2:08:44] scriptures wrote down here see
[2:08:47] so i love that statement man was made to
[2:08:50] be
[2:08:51] a god
[2:08:54] man and when we when we when we we pray
[2:08:56] and we seek god the reason that we're
[2:08:58] going to him is because we know that he
[2:09:00] can do something with the situation
[2:09:03] but the reason god called you is because
[2:09:05] he know
[2:09:06] him in you can do something with the
[2:09:09] situation
[2:09:11] he said he had some scriptures wrote
[2:09:12] down i'ma give y'all just a few of these
[2:09:14] scriptures genesis 1 26.
[2:09:19] god said let us make man in our own
[2:09:21] image
[2:09:22] after our likeness
[2:09:24] and let them
[2:09:27] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[2:09:30] know the fowl of the air and over the
[2:09:31] cattle and over all the earth and over
[2:09:33] every creeping thing that creepeth upon
[2:09:35] the earth let them
[2:09:37] that's male and female
[2:09:39] and i would you know i was early i
[2:09:40] forgot to mention this but when i read
[2:09:43] the quote i'm going to john 10 and next
[2:09:45] says when i read the quote about how a
[2:09:47] policeman can stand out there and stop
[2:09:48] the traffic he don't have power but he
[2:09:50] got authority and as i was reading that
[2:09:52] quote it just came back to me say even
[2:09:53] my wife and sister shonda thinks this is
[2:09:56] a tina i mean these sisters were
[2:09:58] were crossing guards
[2:10:00] amen they didn't even have uh the same
[2:10:03] um
[2:10:06] they didn't stand in the same place as a
[2:10:07] police officer
[2:10:09] but because they wore a uniform
[2:10:12] and they stood in that corner and they
[2:10:14] had to watch them kids in the crosswalk
[2:10:16] i don't care what you want to do if they
[2:10:18] were standing in a crosswalk with their
[2:10:20] hands up
[2:10:21] that meant stop
[2:10:24] don't i know you're in a hurry you got
[2:10:26] to go somewhere i i can't even write you
[2:10:28] a ticket but i still got authority
[2:10:31] i have to call the policeman to write
[2:10:33] you the ticket but i got authority you
[2:10:35] must stop
[2:10:37] as brothers and sisters we have that
[2:10:39] same authority
[2:10:42] let's use authority
[2:10:44] john 10 34 says this jesus answered them
[2:10:48] is it not written in your law
[2:10:51] i said ye are gods
[2:10:54] if he called them gods unto whom the
[2:10:56] word of god came and he and scripture
[2:10:58] cannot be broken say ye of him whom the
[2:11:01] father hath sanctified and sent into the
[2:11:03] world thou blasphemes because i said i
[2:11:06] am
[2:11:07] the son of god
[2:11:10] psalms 82 6.
[2:11:12] look at this
[2:11:14] even david wrote it
[2:11:16] i have said
[2:11:19] ye
[2:11:20] are
[2:11:21] gods not objects to be worshipped
[2:11:24] amen but you certainly have the
[2:11:26] authority of heaven backing you up so
[2:11:29] you can control situations
[2:11:31] i have said ye are gods and all of you
[2:11:34] are children of the most high
[2:11:37] john 14 12.
[2:11:41] verily verily i say unto you
[2:11:44] he that believeth on me the works that i
[2:11:46] do shall he do also
[2:11:48] and greater works than thee shall he do
[2:11:50] because i go unto my father
[2:11:52] also verse 19 and 20 and john 14
[2:11:55] yet a little while
[2:11:57] and the world seeth me no more
[2:12:00] but ye shall see me because i live ye
[2:12:03] shall live also look at this
[2:12:05] at that day
[2:12:08] ye shall know
[2:12:09] that i am in my father
[2:12:12] and ye and me
[2:12:13] and i
[2:12:14] in
[2:12:15] you
[2:12:17] and i just wanna i wanna leave you with
[2:12:19] this last scripture here out of
[2:12:20] revelation 22 and i just find it amazing
[2:12:25] that the very last chapter of the bible
[2:12:30] god would put the ministry of the bride
[2:12:33] in that chapter
[2:12:35] showing that this whole thing amen to
[2:12:37] get her abroad ready a bride to
[2:12:40] recognize who she was
[2:12:42] oh i i i
[2:12:44] i was thinking on this song and amen i
[2:12:47] i'ma leave but my my aunt wrote a song

[2:23:29] revealing lord you have spoken in your
[2:23:32] word throughout the years lord god
[2:23:34] father as our pastor was saying lord
[2:23:37] coming out of baptist church and out of

[2:23:41] these things preach lord it was never
[2:23:43] told to us who we
[2:23:45] truly are in you lord jesus
[2:23:48] but father we are messiahs sons and
[2:23:50] daughters of god and you have said we
[2:23:52] are god's lord
[2:23:54] father may we take this to heart lord
[2:23:56] god when the
[2:23:57] devil comes lord god and

[2:24:01] cast doubt on your word lord god may we
[2:24:03] take our position and take our authority

[2:24:23] not a finger like the king mutumbo but
[2:24:25] the word we can wave before him and take
[2:24:28] our authority and cast satan out of our
[2:24:30] house lord
[2:24:31] o lord god he can't fly in our house he
[2:24:34] has no place in us lord jesus for we are
[2:24:37] the word lord god yet we're not the word
[2:24:39] but father god we thank you for your
[2:24:41] divine truth
[2:24:42] the word we heard this morning is truth
[2:24:44] lord and we receive it as such and we
[2:24:47] take it and we feed on it lord and may
[2:24:49] it be applied to our lives may we
[2:24:51] meditate on this lord father may it not
[2:24:54] leave our hearts our thinking lord as we
[2:24:56] leave this place lord we want this word
[2:24:58] to be we want to be one with this word
[2:25:01] lord god it's the truth father
[2:25:04] may rest in our souls lord
[2:25:06] father we ask oh god that you continue
[2:25:08] to bless our pastor anoint them use the
[2:25:11] lord to fulfill your purpose not only he
