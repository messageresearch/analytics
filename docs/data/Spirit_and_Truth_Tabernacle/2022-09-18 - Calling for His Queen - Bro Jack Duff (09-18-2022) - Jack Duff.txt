that we helped lift his uncle nelson up in prayer before the lord he was admitted to the hospital this morning in a lot of pain and the report is that he is dealing with problems in his prostate so we

jesus himself was praying and to realize that uh our prayers have no limits no distance that uh blocks it from happening we can be here sending a word of prayer to a man that is in the hospital and his pain can stop right now that's the power of prayer so lord we we might not know nelson but you do he's a relative to brother jerry god and a man needs a touch from you father even right now we command this pain that is moving in his body to subside that he would be made whole that uh we we know lord that uh sometimes problems like this and lord cancer attacking bodies but father you even said in through your prophet that if we could just get the people to believe not even cancer would stand in the way of their prayer so lord we send this prayer faith towards nelson even right now that you would touch him if he does not know you in the partner's sin may he come to know you father in that way as well we ask that you would just deliver him from the pain deliver him from the sickness deliver him from anything that the enemy is attacking his body with lord we trust that you god will just move on his behalf it's in the mighty name of the lord jesus christ that we pray amen let's give the lord a hand of praise amen [Applause] amen praise the lord i won't keep you standing i'll have you join me in your bibles musicians thank you all so much for your service today and i certainly appreciate the specials amen from my brother and my daughter i was just sitting there listening and i said well you know i'm happy to have loved ones that are serving the lord a man that are using their talents for god uh it just means it means so much so uh we thank god in spite of all that we go through we have a made-up mind i believe last week we heard you gotta have a fixed heart a man has got to be fixed and you got to be nailed in where you can't be taken out no matter what comes no matter what goes you got to be nailed in and even if you nailed in sideways you still nailed in hallelujah somebody glory to god amen so good to be back in the house of the lord i uh uh want to um take a a couple scriptures here this morning and um the title that we're using for our sermon is a calling for his queen a man calling for his queen and um we want to go to the book of esther and read a few verses there praise the lord amen i saw sister jessica there and i just was good to see her amen this morning in the house of the lord um and i know that's um brother randy and sister celine's oldest daughter amen good to have her amen in the house of the lord as well amen god is good all right um just a couple verses that we'll read here out of um esther uh verse one says now came to pass in the days of a hazaris this is a hazarist which reigned from india even unto ethiopia over 107 and 20 provinces that in those days when um king hatred set on the throne of the kingdom which was in shoeshine and the palace in the third year of his reign he made a feast until his princess and his servants the power of persian media the nobles and princes of the governors being before him when he showed uh the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days even a hundred and four-score days and when these days were expired the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in shushan the palace both unto great and small seven days in the court of the garden of the king's palace where were white green and blue hangings fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble the beds were of gold and silver upon a pavement of red and blue and white and black marble uh and they gave them drink in the vessels of gold the vessels being diverse one from another and royal wine in abundance according to the state of the king and the drinking was according to the law none did compel for so the king had appointed to all the office of his officers of his house that they should do according to every man's pleasure also vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belong to king a hazaris on the seventh day when the heart of the king was mary when uh with wine he commanded mayhem bits the harbona bigthe and carcass the seven chambers that served in the presence of hazaris the king to bring vashti the queen before the king with with the crown royal to show the people and the princess her beauty for she was fair to look on but the queen vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlain's therefore was the king very wroth and his anger burned in him amen uh let's uh just look over here revelation 22 and 17 i believe praise the lord um the bible reads and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is a thirst come and whoso will let him take the water of life freely amen the lord of the blessing to the reading of his word let's pray father we thank you for the ability to read the scripture but we know that the holy ghost has got to come and help us to apply what we've read to where we are living right now so god speak to every heart take control over this portion of service thank you for all that you've done lord through the song leading and the worship and god just how our our hearts have been lifted up elevated so that we could come now father and i hear the word of god so speak lord in the only way that you can to each and every one those present those that are online speak god in jesus name we pray amen amen you can be seated amen again our our title today is uh calling for his queen amen calling for uh his queen and i'd like to just uh open by reading a couple quotes here uh one of them is our our prophet spoke here in our city here in west palm beach and and i'm just kind of picking up this quote out of the sermon testimony praise the lord praise the lord praise the lord but it says this in florence nightingale a very lovely woman they wanted to send they had two airplane tickets that already come in for me to come to durban africa i laid it on the floor and brother bosworth and i prayed and i said lord if you'll heal this woman i'll go to africa i can't go now lookie here so i just committed to the lord sent a handkerchief back to her and went on not long after that king george of england when a man by the name i forget at fort wayne you remember the meeting of fort wayne gospel tabernacle it was a businessman of the city he had multiple sclerosis and had been a bed patient 10 years and a vision came over the man and he was made perfectly whole uh lehman was his name uh walked up and he was a friend uh to the king's private secretary now this this is just somewhat um you know this this is a blessing the way that this this works out so a vision shows over this man by the name of lehman and and he's a a a friend to the king's private secretary amen and and it just so happened that the king was going through the same sickness uh at the time so here this man is sharing his personal testimony uh with the king's private secretary glory to god and the private secretary begins to share this with the king you know uh sometimes we'd be wondering how this gospel gonna get to different people and you just can't control how god works his network is so perfect god would have a man in fort wayne indiana that is a friend to the king's private secretary this man is healed of a man of uh of of this multiple sclerosis through a vision that god gave the prophet and you can imagine as the as a the secretary sharon my friend is healed my friend is healed it begins to anoint the faith of the king so the king does something when his faith is anointed let's read it amen it says and he was a friend to the king's private secretary and through their king george of england sent word to me i have his statements and have his letters of his fields in every uh he says to come pray for him of multiple sclerosis and so i couldn't go up that time so i just wired back and told the king that i would pray for him here now that sounds like to me if you would just speak the word only then my servant will be made whole now here the prophet has to tell the king i can't come i can't come amen to pray for you but i can pray for you hearing the same god that will answer my prayer there will also answer it here oh hallelujah says that god will hear here here uh here just the same as he would over there and so um then another telegram uh come through then yeah it's another telegram come through and wanted me to come over come on over immediately later when i went to england uh over there to see him the lord healed him he couldn't even stand up for over five five minutes at a time i believe the second day he played 18 holes of golf and never was bothered with it no more until the day he died and i was in africa when he died they found a little tumor here on his lung now brother random say that but if you go read your history you know that the man was a smoker praise the lord right and and see uh if brother branham would have got over there he would have to deal with the sin problem first all right amen they found a little tomb on islam they started to cut it open and air got to it some way i don't know how and cause a blood clot to go to his brain and killed him instantly so so a very fine man now king george that i am uh speaking of here the prophet had an opportunity remember that angelo told the prophet that he was going to pray for kings and potentates and and and important people in the earth and things like that and here king george is one of the people that brother branham prayed for not only prayed for but the man was healed of his multiple sclerosis and i died of something different but he was healed of his multiple sclerosis and king george happened to be the father amen of queen elizabeth so even the prophet had something to do in this household [Applause] [Music] let's look at a little something here door to the heart amen oh this message will go everywhere this message will reach places where you never thought it would reach but here the prophet prayed for her father and she and the man was healed amen before she became queen the man was healed now you know these testimonies all over the palace buckingham [Applause] glory to god who prayed for you who who had the vision what's his name william branham praise god well i need him to come pray not oh my amen not not no or robbers not billy graham get william branham have him come immediately and then the prophet has to check the king can i put it that way i can't come but the prayer of faith will be prayed and i still believe god will hear my prayer here just the same way he'll hear it there and if the king would just get a hold of faith he'll see his healing and he saw it all right let's look at this amen he's calling for his queen all right door to the heart there's a statement that is made here by the by the by the prophet he says just recently the queen of england made a visit to canada uh she also visited the united states now this is queen elizabeth the second and he's talking about now we do not live in her domain this is this is the the quote here i might i'm sorry if i didn't give you the right it's paragraph 20 i think there um but it says we do not live in her domain but if she would come to san jose and would come i'm sorry you know what i don't skip i'm sorry let me let me go back up uh yeah yeah that's where i want to be uh so if i or if i own dear beloved president dwight eisenhower the president of this great united states if he would come to the home of the best democrat democrat in this country it would be an honor to you though you would disagree with him in politics but it would be an honor to have president dwight eisenhower to call at your door all right amen uh my god i remember preaching this quote once before and i had some saints sitting here and i forget who was the president then they just did not agree with that president at all and i say it would be an honor for you to have them at your door they say uh uh uh uh uh uh and i just felt like saying you're lying it would be an honor for any president to come to your house it'll be an honor whether you agree with them or don't agree with them it would be an honor for a president to show up at your house amen not everybody make it to be president and and you're going to tell me you're going to show out in front of the president no you don't do nothing like that and that's another thing if you're going to the pope and they want you to bow down and kiss his ring and all that that's a different thing all right right but here you know here he says uh it would be it would be an honor to have a pres have president dwight eisenhower call at your door just a common order ordinary man like we are and if our beloved president would knock at the door you wouldn't you would you want everybody to know it amen you would talk about it the rest of your life it's the truth in the eye that the white eisenhower knocked at my door you'd almost want to build a shrine at your door because the president of the united states came to your door it says just recently the queen of england made a visit to up to canada and she also visited the united states now we do not live in her domain but if she would come to san jose and would come down to some little humble home and knock at the door and one of you women would would have went to the door she would have said i am the queen of england oh my let me get this before i uh go over my time i'm sorry let me just start that now i'll lower it just a little bit for you all right um but but he says uh says uh if she would come went to the door she would say i am the queen of england yet she has no jurisdiction over you but she's an important woman your home would have been honored to have her my you to say great queen because she is nationally speaking the greatest queen in the world watch what the prophet says now nationally speaking amen and you said coming to my home why to humble herself to do that to come to a humble home while all the newspapers would have packed it that she the great queen of england visit american to miss so-and-so's home it would have marked her always for being that humble the television would have sent it out it'd have been on national international news because she's important but who's more important than jesus hey who's any more turned down than jesus all right let's go a little further says he will knock at the door and you say oh oh some other time he's been turned away from more doors than all the great people that ever is on the earth says i say this very day that jesus has been turned away from ten of thousands of doors today and if the world stands before day breaks in the morning he will be turned away from tens of thousands of other doors amen we'd be all excited if a president came and we'd been excited if the preen if the queen would have come to our house but my we ought to be more excited because jesus is knocking at the door oh they have a song say oh won't you let him in amen heist up your windows open up your doors and let jesus come on in hallelujah amen amen so he goes on to say this he says uh uh uh if someone the queen might have might have might want something from you or our beloved president might want something from you he might have some message for you want to do something uh or want you to do something for him but the lord jesus the only thing that he wants in for is to do something good for you amen the only reason jesus is knocking at the doors because he wants to do something good for you amen he wants to bless you amen he wants to take away your evil and give you righteousness amen he wants to give you goodness and mercy that's all he can do and to get into the heart he knocks at the door and the people say oh some other time don't be that way this morning amen if he's knocking at your door open up and let him in amen says now it'll be nice for you to take in the queen or to take in one of the great people but you never do anything better than take in jesus because when he comes in he gives you eternal life and to think of turning him away from your heart but we do it you know so as i was just kind of pondering this i was uh just you know we we had the the recent passing of queen elizabeth and um you know i i love the way the brother branham made this statement she is nationally speaking the greatest queen in the world nationally speaking and and i like that because there is another queen in the world just in case y'all didn't know there there is another queen that's actually greater than queen elizabeth amen she's more important amen right uh she she you know they they the the news needs to keep up with her but this queen somehow they ignore her nobody got nothing to say about this queen amen but she's the greatest queen walking the earth hallelujah she's the queen from heaven she's married to the lord jesus christ she's his bride amen and that's the greatest queen that's walking there so nationally speaking she was a great queen but there's another queen all right i looked at just a few facts here that i i wanted to pull from queen elizabeth uh sharing for 70 years and just a few facts before we get into some other things um i was they were saying that her real birthday is april 21st but uh the country doesn't officially celebrate celebrating until june 11. so they said monarchs with birthdays in in colder months typically schedule an additional official birthday when the weather is likely to be better for a parade so elizabeth had one every june called trooping the color all right so uh here she was she was born april 21st right but they celebrate june 11th another thing is they say she reigned for so long that four out of five uk residents weren't even alive when she ascended the throne and they said eighty-one percent of the uk residents uh weren't even they weren't alive when elizabeth is sending the throne so 81 of people living in the uk right now was not even alive when she uh accepted the throne that's how long she's been raining him all right another thing they say she didn't have a passport or a driver's license and this is why brother random just said in a quote it says if she just came up to your house and say i'm the queen of eaglin england she didn't need no passport she didn't need no driver's license hey man you just let her in and not only would you let her in but every other nation just let her in no no passport no driver's license and they said they said nor does she need them both driver's license and passports are issued in the queen's name so she didn't need she didn't need either of them my goodness another little thing they said about her a 2020 reporting in the telegraph suggested that the queen uses a trusted handbag to subtly exit uncomfortable or boring meetings they said if the queen was at dinner and places a handbag on the table her staff knew that she wanted the event to end in the next five minutes right and if she put her bag on the floor it signaled that she would like to be rescued from her current conversation so she used that handbag another thing they said about her she had no last name uh the queen's official title was elizabeth ii by the grace of god of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland and of and of her other realms and territories queen head of the commonwealth defender of the faith what a name and i know another queen that's a defender of the faith the faith that was once delivered to the saints here's another thing they said about her she couldn't be prosecuted or compelled to give evidence in court i thought wow if god be for us then who can be against us because there's another queen in the land that can't be prosecuted there is nothing against this queen and and i'll tell you i think the devil he does not like this queen because he realized any accusation he brings about this queen will be shut down be covered in blood can't be prosecuted or compelled amen to give evidence in court another thing that uh that that i found here this is the last little statement and it says she was related to the man she married she was related to the man she married now i know another queen that's related to the man she's married to we we've been related to the to the lord jesus christ i mean he can only redeem those that he was related to she was related to the man she married philip was a third cousin said elizabeth is related to queen victoria on her father's side and philip was related to queen victoria on his mother's side so here you know we got these little facts about the queen but and you know and and brother branham said some positive things about her but i tell you there is another queen in the land amen amen amen and i want you to just kind of go with me here this is a quote out of perfection brother branham makes a statement here praise the lord it says this here some time ago when mr baxter was my manager when the king of england when we was there to visit when the queen come out and it's talking about uh king george right when when the queen come out lovely lady her pretty robe on her graying hair and the king said and so sick at that time he could hardly stand it he had a stomach trouble with and multiple sclerosis that was just before he was prayed for but he could hardly stand up but yet the royal blood of him stuck what little chess he had out and he rode down the street in the carriage mr baxter standing there and when he passed i looked at him his lips was quivering the tears was running down his cheeks he put his big arm around me and said brother branham i said yes brother braxton he says you know i'm a canadian yes he says the the man who's over our land the king him and his lovely bride and wife is passing by that's where i can't hold my emotions i have to give vent so this man was crying because he saw the king amen and his and his bride passing by my it just caused emotions just to kind of come out of him so brother adam took advantage of the moment and he says i put my arm around him i said brother baxter as a christian with you what will it be some glorious day when the king comes with his pride if a man could think that when seeing an earthly king which is mortal like we are what will it be when we see the king of kings coming in glory what a glorious time that'll be i say praise the lord you know uh you know i was just uh uh just kind of looking at this you know all over the world people are infatuated with the uh with the queen and the kings of england and all of that they're just infatuated with it even though they're not even under the jurisdiction they're still infatuated with it and i was just thinking to myself maybe the reason that people are so infatuated with is because they can identify amen hallelujah they can identify being the queen of heaven as the bride of christ we can identify with our position oh glory to god we can identify with our place we can identify we are the queen of heaven i just thought about this say man and you know there there there's been a number of queens that we can kind of look back to even in scripture uh you know and just one uh she was she was on the queen for a very small amount of time amen sarah was a queen sarah was given by abraham to the king my god that made sarah queen now she let her reign didn't last too long praise god amen but while she was in the house the house was cursed because she was married to another man and god had to protect sarah because he had made a promise that amen abraham was going to have a son through sarah he could not let sarah be touched by this other king he said now give that man back his wife and let him pray for you glory to god but here we see sarah is holding that that position as a queen glory to god amen we see other queens that we can find in scripture i read about esther and we'll talk about her in a little bit but another queen that i want to kind of pick up this morning amen uh is the queen of sheba glory to god look at matthew chapter 12 verse 42. amen matthew 12 42 the bible speaks to this queen the queen of sheba and it calls her amen says the queen of the south amen shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold a greater than solomon is here oh i just love i love this i love this this this thought here uh greater than solomon is here that lady pressed through a lot of things amen uh in order to get into the presence of solomon what we find there brother branham gives us a really really good picture you know how she had to kind of go through go go against some of the teachings of her date and maybe some of the priests that would have told us that now if you go over there to uh israel then you're gonna have to denounce your faith and how she have to stand there and say now you know you know your mother was this and your father would just say i understand what mama did and what daddy did but i can't i can't stay here when i hear god is moving over there in israel say god ain't i i ain't heard nothing about god moving here i want to go where to move is home and she began to press her way out of that condition say she had to make a a choice that she was going to leave the environment that she was in to go hear the wisdom of solomon she realized that god god had seen a revival amongst his people and she wanted she kept hearing testimony after testimony until it finally got her to a sponsor like i got to go and hear this man for myself praise god now um the thing that brother branham told say this woman would have to jump on the back of a camel and on the back of a camera she had to travel 90 days through the desert and i want you to try to get this in your mind you know uh they'll probably try to make it try to dress it up you gotta think about where was she gonna go and use the restroom 90 days one no one no hotels along the way right but but she had a uh uh something in our heart that no matter what i gotta go through i got a made up mind amen i'm gonna press to get into this man's presence so whatever whatever happens along the way that's what happens while she was on the journey brother branham say they were the the the sons of ishmael and they were they were robbers in the desert they were constantly looking for people that they could take advantage of and here this one queen coming by with all of our servants and amen they were easy target but somehow god protected them from the robbers [Music] amen i tell you when you got something in your heart to do for the lord god will protect you and make sure that you get to your destination glory glory glory the conditions were very very very rough very tough but over a three-month period she finally makes it into the presence of solomon and i just love the way the scripture puts it we're gonna pick up a couple things amen here in the uh in the scripture watch this out of first kings chapter 10 let's pick this up this this queen of sheba judgment will come to other generations because of how this lady pressed through so many things to get into the presence of god amen hallelujah hallelujah people don't press through nothing nowadays amen but this lady had to press through so many things just to get into the presence of god now i want you to catch this in scripture sec first kings chapter 10 verse 3. solomon told her all her questions there was not anything hid from the king which she told her not so she had some things she said i need to ask this guy some questions when i get there and when she got there everything she had in her heart was revealed to her through the wisdom of solomon she had never run into a man like this what an anointing that was on this king says when the queen of sheba had seen all of solomon's wisdom and the house that he had built good god and the meat of his table and the sitting of his servants and the attendants of his ministers i want y'all to get this this lady is observing all around it's one thing you know for her to observe solomon glory but she wanted to observe the people amen that were with solomon glory hallelujah amen uh there are some churches where when you go in uh the only person blessed is the pastor hallelujah amen but you're not looking for a church like that you're looking for a church where everybody everybody in the church is blessed hallelujah somebody right you know but by here you know this woman is looking at some things saying the the meat of his table the sitting of his servants the attendance of his ministers and their apparel my god and his cupbearers and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the lord oh my i can imagine the way that he went up into the house the lord is with his hands lifted and his voice raised and he's praising god because all the things god has done for him amen says uh and the way he went up to that sort there was no no more spirit in her look at this and she said to the king it was a true report that i heard in my own land of thy accent of thy wisdom how be it i believe not the words until i came in my eyes had seen it and behold the half was not told me thy wisdom and prosperity exceeded the fame which i heard glory to god look at this happy are thy men i like that happy are these thy servants which stand continually before thee and hear thy wisdom amen you want to go to church amen where the saints in the congregation are happy and want to be there you don't want to go to a church where you embarrassed right the pastor embarrasses you all the time hey man you want to go where everybody can be happy we're happy we getting the word the bread of life we're happy that we're getting the truth we're happy that we're blessed amen financially we're happy that we're blessed spiritually we're happy that we're blessed we're happy to be in the right place at the right time come to church and people got a sour look in the face they here because somebody made them be here no no no you don't want that no i'm happy to go into the house of god i just i just know when i get to church i'm gonna hear from god i don't care who preaching i know i might hear from god i'm happy to go to church oh i know what i'm talking about because i haven't been in situations where i i dreaded going to church i had a hard time putting my clothes on to get to the house of god i'm the only one like that i see i was i'm like lord i i know i'm not supposed to be like this i'm supposed to be enjoying the presence of the lord but while i'm having such a hard time to get out to the house of god it's hard for me to get in my car amen and i mean when when sunday morning come i'm like oh sunday's here i'm the only one like that i know it i'm i'll be the first one to admit it oh sunday is here oh lord let me just try to get through these few hours oh i'm the only one i know i'm the only one like that but but when god put you in a place where sunday morning come on my kids get ready everybody get ready we got to go to church we're going to hear from god when we get there amen i'm happy to be in the presence of the lord happy are thy men amen glory to god happy are these thy servants we stand continually before thee and that hear thy wisdom blessed be the lord thy god which delighteth in thee to set thee on the throne of israel because the lord loved israel forever therefore made he the king to do judgment and justice now watch this this woman i told you had to be protected on the desert she had to go through some real real trying things for a woman to take a 90-day journey on a camel think about the the the uh uh the conditions of her riding we won't even get in an air-conditioned car and go some places 90 days on the on the back of a camel moving very slow right but here she's making her way through the desert just to get into the present song and when she came hallelujah once she was convinced that god was god that god was in the midst of this this woman was carrying something very precious with her amen if he can answer all these questions that i got i got something to give him now look at what happens in verse 10 and she gave the king 120 talents of gold and of spices very great store and precious stones there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of sheba gave to king solomon now you know we have to uh convert a man into our language today what is this 120 talents of gold what she was carrying with her a man through the deserts on the back of a camel was 325 million 128 thousand dollars now if if that's in today's terms that's how much money she was carrying now i need to understand that that she was so excited about what she saw a man there in the kingdom of israel that she wanted to give everything that she had to it amen now i'm not asking you to give all your money don't don't don't empty out your bank accounts and things like that just your tithing offering that's all you give god but give god your heart give god your time give god your commitment give them 110 give god everything you can [Applause] but you know solomon got this offering from her and you know it didn't change him it didn't change him oh hallelujah amen it shouldn't change us like that because god bless us like that and i'm going to tell you why i didn't change i didn't i didn't hear this brother solomon sent me a video uh this week and i was watching you know it's just something people that uh that are underneath this um uh prosperity type ministries people that understand they see things in the scriptures that most of us just pass right over and i pass right over something you know in the chapter before there was a king by the name of hyrum read it in verse uh chapter 9 verse 14 glory to god actually i think i might want to read just a little bit ahead of that go maybe like start me at 11. okay now hiram the king of tyre had finished solomon i furnished solomon with cedar trees and fur trees and with gold according to all his desire that then the king solomon gave hiram 20 cities in the land of galilee next verse and hyrum came out of tyre to see the cities which solomon had given him and they pleased him not now i thought about this why this this man has he doesn't realize what he was given cities that were near or in the land of galilee is that what the next verse previous to that said amen in the land the city 20 cities in the land of galilee and when the man come and saw the cities it pleased them not i want you to understand what this man is looking at because you know later on there was a a a a a great person amen the king of kings the lord of lords he also came from galilee and remember they asked the question can any good thing come out of galilee right but but here here this man missed an opportunity to be identified with something but let's go on a little further even in this disappointment and he said what cities of these which thou has given me my brother and they call them the land of kabul until this day look at this look at this the next verse and hiram sent to the king six score talents of gold what is that six score it's 120 if i if i recall correctly it's 120. so what happened is that he gave the same exact offering that the queen of sheba gave so it didn't change solomon because he'd already seen it before and let me just put it like this to you amen when god blesses you and i say when because it's going to happen don't let the blessing change you [Music] and can i go a little further can i prophesy you know that one big blessing you're looking for god gonna double it [Applause] but don't let it change it see when you can handle it he can give it to you and he can give it to you again he can give it to you again because you can handle it [Applause] it just it didn't stop solomon he was still there serving and doing everything he was supposed to do even after the blessing some of us get a blessing next thing you know we're not found in church no mo where you at amen you came vacation every week [Music] all right but here you know we see this uh this queen of sheba who pressed away into uh into solomon's uh uh uh uh you know kingdom and all she wanted to do is just hear the word of the lord and see how god was using him and uh and and and and because of the way that she pressed the way that she got there and all the things the perils that she had to go through the scripture told us there in matthew 12 42 that the queen of the south was going to rise up in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold a greater than solomon is here don't let a testimony bring condemnation to you here's another queen that we see amen in the scripture and we picked her up as we read about esther and let's just kind of look at her just for a little bit amen uh esther is uh uh i don't want to call her a man a a secondary thought in god's mind she was the queen and god had to allow a certain situation to happen in the kingdom so esther can be brought to her position oh hallelujah what did god do amen he had a queen on the throne at the time by the name of vashti amen and and vashti uh during this great celebration with the women and and king hazardous had his own celebration going but at the end of seven days king of hazard said i want everybody to see how beautiful my wife is and here he calls for his queen glory to god he calls for his queen and what we find with vashti is that she rejected the call of the king hallelujah glory to god by her rejecting the call of the king she got rejected as queen oh hallelujah amen what we see is that vashti failed to obey the word of her king amen but here today god has a people in the land amen that will not fail to obey the word of their king hallelujah amen so so here we want to just kind of look at a couple things here amen um esther was what we would call the perfect type of the bribe she was an oddball amen this this lady was was very different in a lot of ways and and one of the things that uh that we found is that she had a situation that she'd gone through she lost both a father and lost a mother she was an orphan hallelujah she was raised taken in to be raised by her uncle and her uncle was a very very strict man this man has some some serious conviction hallelujah i love mordecai he had serious conviction he would not bow to haman amen whatever they was doing and whatever everybody else was doing he refused to do what everybody else would say i'ma have to do it this way and now he knew his he knew his position he knew who he was and he says now esther they're looking for a new queen he says now what you need to do is make sure you go in there don't tell him anything about you don't tell him where you come from who your people are don't say nothing hallelujah and i love the advice that he gave esther because amen just with her natural beauty she woo the king just with her natural beauty no no additions amen she woo the king amen and sisters the only way you gonna woo the king in this tower amen is with your natural beauty he will beautify the meek with salvation amen hallelujah you see esther raised up in a household like this it caused her to kind of develop some convictions of her own and uh you know mordecai uh what was the man that you know he gave with advice he checked on he watched out for and he did all the things that he needed to do but he raised and not only not only that i mean the king wasn't just looking for any kind of woman the king wanted a virgin hallelujah they were going through the land looking for the virgins amen so living in mordecai's house mordecai would have to tell him no you're not going to that party no you're not going to that person's house no you're not going to do this because in there you might get tricked into something and you got to keep yourself until you get married mordecai was a strict uncle but his strictness paid off in the end [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah parents you might have to pick up that level of strictness again your strictness will pay off in the end you don't know who god got for your daughter teaching the right ways keep yourself till you get married tell your son the same thing keep yourself till you get mad it'll save you a lot of headaches esther was an oddball esther a man here in this kingdom she was a israelite but here she's amongst all the the maybe the girls from india and amen ethiopia could have been people from all over because this kingdom spanned it for a long pla it was a long ways a lot of young ladies that come all these young ladies looking different you can imagine uh ethiopian standing if you if you ever been uh we had to pass through ethiopia one time and uh you know and i was kind of stuck in an airport there for about eight hours and just watching the people i'm like ma i've never seen people that look like this i've never seen people like i mean why what what what what i mean you see all kinds of things when you get into other other parts of the world right hey man but by here you can imagine a king seeing all these different women and everybody may be coming and not not not uh confident about their natural beauty come on somebody amen not confident with who god has made them so maybe when they get there and the chamberlain suggests put on this and and where it is and and put on that and and this might please the king has to say no i ain't win none of that if he don't like me the way i am then he just won't like me if this thing is of god and i'm supposed to be the queen and i'm gonna be the queen just like i am hallelujah thank god for an esther esther walks before the king and the king said yeah this is the one right here and here you know we're going to pick it up in in in a few quotes here uh marriage of the land brother branham makes a statement about esther it says esther purge her heart before god i like this walked up with a meek and humble spirit the church that's going to be the bride of christ now remember esther refused the worldly adornment i'm not putting no pain on my face i'm not putting no pain on my fingers i'm not putting no paint on my feet praise the lord on my toes no pain no pain no pain i wasn't born with pain god i was and wonderfully made i'm not going before the king with paint hallelujah it's just a natural beauty say ask the prayers are heart before god walked up with the meek and humble spirit the church that's going to be the bride of christ and remember esther refused the worldly adornment she took the spirit in her heart to go before the king look and the woman today the church that thinks she's going to get in because she's got more numbers she's the best dressed crowd she's got the biggest organization the biggest church in the city and things like that you'll miss it a million miles if you're depending on that look at this it's a sweet kind reverent spirit to the word i want to say that again it's a sweet kind reverent spirit to the word of god washed by the word of the word and the word in you it's a washing amen i i when i when i read that quote i got up and took off around the chair running it's a sweet amen kind reverent spirit to the word of god remember vashti did not have this kind of spirit vashti will tell the king no i'm not coming when you call for me to come i come when i'm ready to come vashti has her own party going on holly that she is doing her own thing but vashti did not realize by her doing her own thing she was gonna be rejected hey he is calling for his queen a queen that has a sweet kind reverent spirit not a reverend spirit to brother jack not a reverend spirit to just what the prophet said but a reverend spirit to what the word of god is saying because the prophet is saying what the word said and you know what brother jack is saying what the word said hallelujah glory to god you got to have a sweet kind reverent spirit to the word of god washed by the water of the world and the word in you it's a washing he's calling for his queen but now as this queen is coming amen she has to present herself a certain way she can't present herself like the world hallelujah amen i'm talking about a greater queen than the queen that everybody is talking about i'm talking about the queen of heaven this morning she has to present herself in a different way look at this it says that's uh that's right not just a part washing but a full gospel washing cleaned up made new creatures in christ jesus i like what he said here all right let me go on a little a little further uh here's another quote out of meanest man i know amen the meanest man i know look at this the prophet makes a statement and this in this uh in this message it says the church is a whole lot like it was in the days of esther he says esther didn't take the perfuming of the women she adorned herself with modest apparel the hidden man of the heart and the king said put the crown on her head amen esther was a type of the church today those who are ready to come out and adorn themselves with the sweetness of the holy spirit not the perfuming and the dressing of the world try to compare with them but that hidden man of the heart that's the one i'ma tell you you know uh they had a thing about you know the queen when she was younger queen queen elizabeth um she um her and her sister i think at the end of one of the wars they wanted to go out and be amongst the people and so they kind of took all their royal stuff off and uh and they just kind of dressed down so they just looked normal just like everybody else and as they went out a lot of people had no idea that the queen was in their midst my god now you know she's dressing down in order to try to achieve that but here as the bride of christ we always dress down we don't dress like the world we don't look like the world we don't i mean our dresses now look we still look nice but we just don't look like the world hallelujah amen our sisters ain't got to wear a dress with half half of this hanging out it's the truth in it this too tight and that now we ain't got a dress like that to get nobody attention you know a woman that wear makeup she only wear that to peace men praise the lord that's only to peace man that's not the peace god you don't do that for the glory of god you do that to appease a man and maybe sometimes it might not be another man you might appease other women it's the truth in it you just want compliments and the only people compliment you is is another girlfriend watch us she might have a spirit on them all right glory to god you just think about how many how many what men gave you compliments when you did that some wolf out there give you a compliment praise god but brothers ain't gonna say nothing to you a real son of god won't say nothing to you dressed like that and you wonder why he's saying that because he ain't looking for nothing like that he's looking for a real queen is this all right oh my so look you know uh we we see this amen in the story of esther vashti was a perfect type of the church that rejected the word in her day the word of the king amen and esther my god she uh uh she didn't go along with everything and everybody was doing she just took it the way god gave it to her you know like i say raised in a very strict home but my blessing is that she was chosen to be queen and not only was she chosen to be queen it was she was chosen at the right time to be queen because as soon as she was chosen to be queen this other guy heyman came up with a plan he says you know what i'm going to kill all the jews and the reason i'm going to kill these jews amen is because you know they just they they're not like us they don't handle themselves like us and they just do everything different maybe we want to have a party they refuse to come to the party we want to do this they refuse to do that we want to go to church and worship they won't go to church with us they just they just are strange people we got to get rid of all the jews then she had it was one specific jew that he really didn't like every time i ride through the city there's this guy by the name of mordecai he refuses to bow when he sees me coming and he knows i'm a man of uh uh with authority he knows he's supposed to bow but this man refuses hallelujah but remember as esther was saying esther was told don't tell him who your people are don't tell him amen that you're a jew don't even tell him who your uncle is don't tell him nothing but there come a time where she couldn't hold the secret amen mortar i mean here heyman decided to say i'm gonna i'm gonna slay everybody i'm gonna get some rule i'm getting uh uh uh uh something from the king to say i can kill all the jews he says i'm gonna get this thing written up and give the king signature i'm going to town on this jews and i'ma set it for a certain day you realize esther was only a queen for two months before this thing went out two months she was there but god had prepared it that she would be in place and she would have favor with the king that wherever she acts the king she could get when it came time for mordecai to say now esther you know there's a there's a there's a poster going out that all the jews gone down a certain day and i said we're going to need you to go before the king and stand in the gap i like this esther is standing as a redeemer esther is the only one that can go before the king este is the only one amen that can stand in the gap of her people nobody else could do it this thing has already been signed as to what you gonna do say she said you know what i i can't go because if i if if if i go and i'm not called is death it's death to me he says well don't forget you're a jew and even though you're in the house you're still a jew and the same guy that's coming after us out here he'll be coming after you in there so as to say that's good good advice y'all start praying y'all start fasting it says she says now uh and and i love it because these words amen still ring through history this queen stood up and she said she say now i realize it's a chance of me taking my life but she said if i perish let me perish she says but i'm going inside to see this king and she put on her best apparel and she got up and she walked into the presence of a hazardous and it says uh he says he said oh a king and king of queen esther what would you like she said i want you to come to my banquet that i got prepared and i want you and haman to come here and say oh yeah i'm going to the banquet with esther man i really been blessed has to go back another day so i want y'all to come back again tomorrow after she said do the baker i want y'all to come back again tomorrow and say he says okay i'll share with you what i want to share with you here here haman just thinking everything going and here mordecai still refusing to stand in his presence and still refusing to bow or whether in his presence he said he said i said i just can't stand this guy mordecai went in got up early one morning to go see the king say you know what i want to take mordecai out myself i got halo i got gaylo's gallows that i'm hanging in my house and i'm gonna i'm gonna hang this guy but as he's going inside the house i love the lord the king couldn't sleep he woke up that morning and here come haman knocking on the door and says uh king say before you say a word before you say a word let me say something to you it says anyone that you saw do something for the king uh you know something in the kingdom reward them what would you do for that person it says well if it was me i would put him on a horse and i would make some men walk before him and i would i was i'll make those men yell out in the streets this is what the king does for those that the king wants to honor hallelujah this is what the king does for those he want to honor and he said he said that's what i would do if it was me king he says is that right he says okay get your horse and he's thinking oh who are you going to make right before me lord i mean king who you gonna make right before he says no i'm nobody gonna ride before you you gonna walk before mordecai you're gonna put mordecai on your horse and you're gonna walk before mordecai and you're gonna say the same words that you just told me that you would say this is what the king does to honor those that honor the king glory to god and here he got the gallows built amen and he's already out honoring mordecai the very god that he's coming against he has to honor him god know how to make your enemies your footstool but you got to let god do it here here he comes and he's walking out amen and as as he's just going through the city this is how the king honors that on him he finally made it back home and he just fell on his bed just just in grief he could wife i can't believe i'm so embarrassed that the king made me do this and here come a knock on the door you're supposed to be at dinner didn't get a chance to say bye to his wife when they got to dinner esther revealed who she was that's to say you know there's a a edict that's been signed by your king and all the people the jewish people are gonna die on a certain day well who who gonna do something like that this guy mordecai came up with that plan what and say and king you didn't know i'm a jew so make you got to give me something that i can kind of reverse this thing say well i can't change what i wrote but i will let the jews fight for themself and that god that same guy heyman amen they said now he got he got gallows already in his house waiting to try to kill my uncle says well you know i'll tell you what let him be hung on his own gallows watch the devil now to think the trap that he's trying to set for you is the same trap he got about to fall into you know i just read to y'all early about queen queen elizabeth anytime she could not be called into law she can be called into court for anything she couldn't be charged for anything there was nothing against a queen esther kind of stood in the same place amen she her people not only up her but she stood for her people that they would not even die they'd be able to defend themselves what a queen i want you to look at a couple things here from the prophet vaster was a perfect type of the church i want to bring this out of legacy and church age she's the perfect type of the church but queen esther represents the bride here brother brandon makes a statement in the in the later scene church it says a momentary consideration of church history will prove how accurate this thought is in the dark ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people but god sent luther with the word and and when i look at god sending luther and sending these messages it's just like them seven chamberlains amen that went to queen vashti but she refused to listen my god god sent seven messengers amen to the gentile church in this day and we have received the word we have not rejected the word we have received the word god said luther with the word the lutheran spoke for god at that time but they organized and again the pure word was lost for organization tens toward dogma dogman creeds and you know i'm just looking at this how they organize vastly organized too she organized her own party for the women hallelujah i wonder why she organizing a party for the women and no men are there what is that telling the women maybe she's saying i i'ma tell y'all what now when he calls for me i'ma show y'all how we gonna do this glory to god amen look at this he says lutheran spoke for god at that time but they organized and again the pure word was lost for organization tense towards dogma and creeds and not simple words they could no longer speak for god then god sent wesley and he was the voice with the word in his day the people who took his revelation from god became the living epistles read and known of all men for their generation when the methodist failed god raised up others and so it has gone on through the years until in this last day there is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age i'm talking to that group of people this morning the church vashti the church is no longer the mouthpiece of god it is its own mouthpiece so god is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet amen hello somebody he will confound her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of god will be where in her praise god yes it is for it says in the last chapter verse of revelation verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come once more the world will hear direct from god as that pentecost but of course that word bribe will be repudiated as it as in the first age i thank god that the word is already in the bride you talk about a queen in the land there's a queen here and the king is calling for his queen to stand by his side but stand dressed according to this word hallelujah let me give you a couple more quotes here out of the breach between the seven church ages and the seven seals the prophet makes this statement oh yes lord it says but you see that sleeping virgin ain't receiving anything anyhow that's right and remember while they went to try to buy oil you remember the scripture doesn't say they got it but while they were out trying to buy it there come a sound what happened all those virgins that slept arose and trimmed their lamps and went into the supper is that uh is that right he says an arrest was left for the tribulation period right weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth that's the church not the bride amen the bride went in and i love this there's a whole difference between the church and the bride there's a whole difference between the church and the bride yes sir went into the wedding supper oh notice boys it says uh the seals was broke why in the last church age the seals was broke in the last church age to reveal these truths why the lamb broke the seals and revealed them to his church in order to collect his subjects for his kingdom his bride see oh my he wants to bring his subjects to him now what what is it out of the dust of the earth out of the bottom of the sea out of the pits out of everywhere in every place out of the regions of the dark glory to god i don't care where you at god is calling for his bride to stand by sight amen it says out of the duster out of the bottom sea out of the pits out of everywhere and every place out of the regions of the dark out of paradise wherever they may be he will call and they will answer amen amen he will call and they'll answer he come to get his subjects he revealed his secrets and they saw it and time is no more at that time time has run out it's finished all right look at this he leaves the throne to be an intercessor as a slain lamb to be a lion king to bring the world to judgment who has rejected his message he's not a mediator and see uh uh vashti re rejected the message of the chamberlains it wasn't the king that came and asked for vashti it was the chamberlain's that came to get vastly hallelujah and if i could put it this way it wasn't it wasn't the king himself that was coming to get his bride amen but he sent seven messengers hallelujah friends of the bridegroom and to reject the friends of the bridegroom is just like rejecting the bridegroom when vashti rejected it she got rejected all right stay with me here all right look it says he's not a mediator remember the old testament teaching now as we hurry when the blood went off the mercy seat what was it judgment seat and when the lamb slain walked forward from eternity out of the father's throne and took his rights it was a judgment seat then he become not a lamb but a lion king and he calls for his queen to stand by his side and i believe that's the season of time that we're living in right now don't let these things go over you don't get so amen enamored with what's going on naturally that you fail to miss your spiritual position hallelujah amen one king has died but another one has been born i hope you understand what i'm saying one queen has died but another one has been born born by the word amen all right and i'm not taken from what has happened i'm not but i am i mean the whole purpose is that you would know your position and god uses natural to type the spiritual glory to god don't miss your position you you are this great queen the queen of heaven that is on the earth right now just like they didn't know esther was there they didn't know it but there comes a time where god will god will use this bride to be the final voice of the final age don't fail to miss your part amen all right this last quote that i want to read here out of thy tier in church h oh he's calling for his queen to stand by sight god is calling for his queen to stand by sight hey hallelujah i'll tell you what when it was time for esther to be shown amongst the people she had no problem standing by her king's side vashti had a problem with it but but esther didn't have a problem with it and esther got favor with the king because of her her meek spirit look at this now authoritarian church age brother branham makes a statement let us go back to the beginning says in the original physical creation as we know it today god made everything in pairs look at this male and female there were two chickens rooster in hen because there were two cattle the cow and the bull he says and right down the line but when it came to man there was only one they were not a pair says adam had been made in the image of god he was a son of god as a son of god he could not be tempted and fall watch it he could not be tempted and fall adam as the son of god cannot be tempted and fall think about that you know the queen she couldn't even be brought to court right but as sons of god adam in the original condition he could not be tempted and fall all right watch this that would be impossible look at it so god took a byproduct of man to cause the fall stay with me woman never step fresh from the hand of god as a true product of god now let's catch this now let's make sure we catch this we're talking about a man uh the uh the physical part of the woman now the spiritual part was a part of god that spiritual part was also part of adam when he first brought adam he was both male and female so that spiritual part was there but when god took the spirit out of that feminine spirit let me say that again let me be very very clear god took the feminine spirit out of adam so if you see adam with a feminine spirit it's a perversion because god took the feminine spirit out of adam and then he also took a rib out of air adam and he formed eve praise god all right it says so god took a byproduct of man to cause the fall woman never stepped fresh from the hand of god as a true product of god she was produced from man and when god calls her to be brought forth from man she was vastly different from other females he had created she was able to be seduced no other female in creation can be immoral but the human female may be touched at almost any time look at this and that weakness in her allows satan to seduce her by way of the serpent and has brought the woman this is a very very important statement here amen uh it's brought the woman to a very peculiar position before god and his word watch it now she is the type of all things vulgar you having a hard time with that one just put that when type of all things vulgar just type type that in type t-y-p-e of all things vulgar v-u-l-g-a-r i think that should be only one and i'm reading from thy tier in church age all right want to make sure y'all get this one all right so he says now that weakness in her allowed satan to seduce her by way of the serpent and has brought the woman to a very peculiar position before god and his word she is the type of all things vulgar not only that foul and loathsome on the one hand now see that's that's that's that's that's very important that we get that on the one hand on the one hand because that's where some people preach it they always preach it on the one hand but we gotta preach it on the other side too it's two hands two hands to a body she's the type of all things vulgar fowl and lotion on the one hand and on the other hand she's the type of all things clean and beautiful and holy as the receptacle receptacle of the spirit and blessings of god on the one hand she is called the who is drunk with the wine of her fornication now let's talk about the catholic church on the other she is called the bride of christ on one hand she is called mystery babylon the abomination before god amen and on the other hand she is called new jerusalem our mother amen on the one hand she is so foul and wicked and lewd that she is summarily cast into the lake of fire as the only fit place for her but i want to talk about the other hand but on the other hand she is exalted to heaven sharing the very throne of god as the only place befitting such a queen who is this queen where this place is befitting i'm speaking to her this morning the pride of jesus christ and he is calling for his queen to stand by his side oh my i thought it was just very very appropriate for us to remind you of who you are you're not vashti your type is esther and everything esther did that's what you want to do hallelujah to the lamb of god amen by esther submitting herself to the word esther refusing to be adorned with the things of the world esther did all those things esther was blessed in the end and church this is what happened us there there there there's there's another voice in the land there's another voice in the land and that voice the voice of god is speaking through the through the bride in this last day that final voice to the final age will be the bride and notice what the bride gonna do the bride gonna say when the but when the bible says the spirit of bride say come it's because the the spirit the bride and the prophet will say the same thing amen the spirit gonna tell the prophet to say it the bride gonna pick up what the prophet said and the bride gonna keep echoing that i don't care how old-fashioned it may seem but we're going to say what the prophet said and we're going to live the way the prophet told us to live because there's a throne that's befitting for this type of lady amen it's the throne that he has prepared for us let's pray father we are so grateful lord for um all that you're doing in our midst we can see our place in scripture you can look at the life of esther even lord the life of the queen of sheba and all that she pressed through to get to your presence lord sometimes we have to press over a lot of stuff to get into your presence but we're determined to get there and father uh we want to live a life that is pleasing to you we don't want to please the world please our friends please our associates we want to please our god [Music] lord even as as as esther was there and lord didn't realize uh what her purpose was maybe i'm i'm pretty and i got selected to be king but within two months time she realized what a real purpose was she had to stand in the gap and be a redeemer for her people and lord she she walked into that responsibility with such a courage if i die let me die but i'm going to see the king you got to do it if he doesn't extend that scepter to me and give me grace then oh well but i got to do this for my people we thank you for a woman like that that would have that type of courage to realize what you had called it to help us lord to recognize what you've called us to in this hour not to let down amen the bars amen and things of this world but help us lord to hold the standard high to live according to the word of god not not just something that brother jack said or something you know what brother jack saying what the prophet said no no the prophet read it read it out of the bible brother jack read it out of the bible it is what you said god so i pray lord jesus that you would help us lord to come to this to hear your voice and may you lord jesus get all the glory and all the honor out of the lives that we would live thank you to call us to a place like this oh there is a throne befitting for such a queen a queen that will honor the word of god a queen that will live according to the truth there's a throne a place be fitting for such a woman thank you lord jesus for calling us it's in the mighty name
