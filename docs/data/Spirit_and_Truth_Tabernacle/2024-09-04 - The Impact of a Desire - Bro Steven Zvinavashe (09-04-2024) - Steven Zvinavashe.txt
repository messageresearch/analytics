Pulpit that hides our bellies Hallelujah amen praise the Lord am nothing wrong much with this one all right right today is a peculiar day all right today is a different day yes sir I I I believe as Christians sometimes we're always always on the defensive all right today we want to go on the offensive right we want to go into the enms camp yes and take that which he stole from us we are children of God who are destined to go to heaven all right one of these days when we are seated in heaven we will be asked by Brother Paul can we share your testimony all right what are we going to say if we don't have testimonies my brother my sister all right the only way we can have a testimony is to go on the offensive go into the enemy's Camp don't be afraid of the devil the devil is just a dog without any teeth Hallelujah he's just like thunder without lightning and we are here to tell and declare to him that tonight another night a different night all together praise be to God I am going to my message that I have is some kind of a message that is going to invoke mothers all right Hallelujah why am I saying so because the devil has found a place and little group that he can disturb so that they cannot hold on to this message and that little group is none other than our youths our children these are the Ministers of tomorrow if the Lord carries Hallelujah these are the deacons of tomorrow if the Lord teres these are the trustees of tomorrow if the Lord teres but he has targeted our children and we are want to adopt a stance like Moses did said not even a wolf is going to remain behind Hallelujah we will go with our young ones we will go with our old ones my brother my sister no matter if you have got a little baby it's time to make a claim to say devil touch not my anointed and do my prophets no harm hallelujah praise be to God thank you Lord let's turn our books to the Book of Mark Mark 11:24 oh it's very straightforward praise God hallelujah hallelujah amen praise be to God my Bible says therefore I say unto you we want us to read between the lines therefore I say unto you what things soever you desire When you pray believe that you have received them and you shall have them the equation is very simple let me just pray before I go on precious father we thank you this even for your grace and mercy we appreciate you Lord for bringing all the saints into this house oh God to commune with you not to listen to a man but to listen from thee dear God help those who are online oh God Almighty and those who are physically here may this seon be a testimony to somebody dear heavenly father we thank you we give you glory we give you honor this is the most sacred part oh Lord God Almighty that no human being is able to do father I invite your holy presence amongst us I invite you Lord God Almighty to come and circumcise the lips of the the the the hearer and the lips of the one who is speaking behind the desk oh dear God lord may we feel your presence at the end of the day and when we be like clas of old who said was it not good to be in the house of God as he spake unto us we give you glory we give you everything in the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ we pray and believe amen amen you may be seated the Bible is very clear yes sir therefore I say unto you right what things soever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them the equation is not complete when you only desire you have to take another step right of praying for your desire all right and when you have prayed for your desire it's not time to relax my brother my sister it's time to believe that you have received that which you have been praying for hallelujah hallelujah whatsoever you desire my brother my sister whatsoever mean whatsoever I don't care how many desires we have this tonight you might be having plenty of desires they are covered in this scripture the more you have the more God likes it because God says our Prophet teaches us that when you ask for anything ask big don't ask for small things which will make people doubt to say is this God or not God wants people to be convinced beyond measure and realize that that whenever he gives you something even the world must come to a stand still GL hallelujah hallelujah whatsoever means whatsoever whatever desire you have maybe somebody has been praying all along Lord I want a restoration of my business I want oh God my children to come back to the faith I want a restoration of my health my health is deteriorating Lord may you come into my business I want you to come into my business and prove beyond measure all these Philistines out there they must realize that I'm a Child of God because the word says we shall never be taals but heads God hallelujah hallelujah I want a little bit of noise my brother my sister don't wear that long face my brother my sister you have come to the house of God where you must be fulfilled with joy I have underlined it in red therefore I say unto you who you and me as I preach I'm preaching to myself as well right what things your ever you desire how many are Desiring tonight how many are Desiring tonight if you desire my brother my sister you at the right place because this is the place where everything will be sorted out I can hear somebody a mighty gentle Warrior coming to the pulpit and saying Pulpit Pulpit answer my prayers Pulpit Pulpit answer my prayers that's the kind of motive you have to adopt tonight praise be to God hallelujah hallelujah amen brother Peter Paul tells us we must have it is a must that we must he have some testimonies that's right brother Hallelujah that's right hallelujah amen he says here faith without works is dead amen amen amen Works can never come before you make a desire all right you need to make a desire to say I want to have this I want to have that and I want to have this I want to have that once you start to desire then when you kneel down my brother my sister God is bound to answer you because God is not a man who can lie neither the son of a man who can repent what he said you make it come to pass yes am it's his word that's right amen praise God when I'm put in between a hard place and a rock I normally go to God and say Lord you know me within and without amen I did not volunteer to be a Christian if I did not volunteer to be be a Christian it's your duty to look after me I Feast on your word day and night Hallelujah when you put God in such a situation my brother my sister you say my name of the war is Prince Michael I am standing up to go and deliver my son I will go down myself to deliver my daughter all the Angels Gabriel will come and say let me go you say Gabriel sit down wh would will come and say you know what I did during Noah's time I flooded the Earth let me go he'll say not you w let me go myself this is the eagle ede those children are like eagles so I am going myself to deliver them then you see God coming and when he comes on to you my brother my sister pandemonium takes place Doom devil they start to run Hallelujah no matter how many times how many days your prayer has been held up there remember Daniel himself he prayed for 21 days but his prayer was being held by the Prince of Persia until God said let me go and relieve my son then he said to him in Daniel chap 12:1 he said the moment you started to believe and pray I was with you yes you must have been praying some my brother the angels have been watching over you God was looking at you God was looking and weighing your desire my brother my sister this is the time to make exploitation amen there's no time any other time that we're going to exploit other than in this age when we go to Heaven There is no more about preaching the word it is only about singing and rejoicing not even in the Millennium Hallelujah my God hallelujah Glory oh praise be to God my my my my my my my my my Hallelujah my brother brother Branham says the church has got power to shake this world and he says he has invested he says God has invested his power in his word that's right that's right when he has invested his power in his word he needs some people who believes the word who can be the chief speaker who can use their mouth to release that power within the word if that power remains dominant my brother my sister we will be like slaves oh my Hallelujah faith without works is dead Paul even goes on to say we are justified by our works all right hallelujah amen if you have not exploited something along those those lines then there's something wrong something is lacking my brother my sister oh praise be to God hallelujah and I did not have that scripture let me just read it to you I want to justify the scripture that goes hand in hand with this scripture that I have read in in uh 1 John 5 verse1 15 it says and if we know that he hears us right whatsoever we ask we know that we the petitions that we desired of him thank Jesus there we are thank you Jesus Hallelujah yes hallelujah amen tonight I'm going to speak about the impact of a desire the impact of a desire where are you mothers I said I'll be speaking much about the mothers today because these mothers are the one who carried N9 months of the babies they know all the groanings and all the pains and now the devil has targeted our youths to destroy us once he destroys our youth we have got no future my brother my sister we are gr go getting old now the gray hairs are now mushrooming and now we need a cop of people who can stand in a Kimo and say devil you have come this way you can never cross this line anymore we are here to discomfit you and defeat you amen amen hallelujah amen hallelujah you know the power that you have my brother my sisters and so the prophet in the message he was to pass that way he says and so a good Praying Wife or a mother I have mothers in here I have good praying wives in here hallelujah it says can do more for the kingdom of God on your knees at home all right you don't need to come here my S my my sisters even at home when you kneel down you are damaging the the the the the kingdom of the devil God hallelujah he said can do more for the kingdom of God on her knees at home than sometimes the preacher can do on the platform that's right Hallelujah this is the power that God has invested in you my sisters this is the power that you need to exercise yes when you see s something is not going on all right in the homes you are the first ones to notice God I don't think my daughter is walking right I don't think my son is walking right there's something there's a connection between you and the children then you start to say okay devil I've seen you and I've recognized you from afar what I'm going to do is I'm going to write on you to get whatever I want you are going to be my hor because I know when the moment I kneel down I can do more damage to the kingdom of the devil hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah let me go to my first quotation Hallelujah message preached in 56208 is called Abraham I want you to listen to this my brother my sister brother branam is in a prayer line and here comes a certain lady brother Bram then starts to discern the lady you've been praying for God to help you of a severe NE case you've been having Hallelujah maybe you're passing through a difficult time in terms of your health I want you to put your name there maybe you don't have a severe case is something else but put your name there that's one first designment that's right you pray for that both day and night look at it my brother my sister this sister was praying about this situation every day and night so when you have got something that is bothering you my brother my sister don't cease to pray continue on and shoot the arrows shoot the arrows shoot the arrows remember in war we have a soul in here maybe when they want to throw a grenade they remove the cter pin and when they remove the cter pin they throw the grenade sometime the grenade does not explode right it lays Dom and silent but there it's it's not a duty for them to stop throwing those grenades they continue to throw when one is going to be thrown it is going to ignite all those grenades that have been thrown and it will be like boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom inating the enemy and the enemy will be destroyed the enemy wonder where are all these targets coming from Hallelujah the sister was praying both day and the night Hallelujah thankes you are praying for a son number two also and that son isn't here yes you might be praying for your loved one right now my brother amen who is not even here amen that person is not even here and you are praying for that person is still in order Oh Glory Glory Glory Glory And that son isn't here he doesn't even live in this city he's not in this westbound Beach all right maybe he's in Miami all right maybe he's in California God maybe he's in Africa all right and that son is suffering with a heart condition oh my Jes oh my not only that but one of the other things we are praying for for him he is not a Christian don't shine them when they are not Christians love them God project love to them those who are no longer worshiping with us extend your hand go to them put your arm around their their their shoulders tell them my brother I love you my sister I love you I know you might have come across an obstacle but we are here to join hands and when we join hands we pray for that we pray for this demon to depart and we want you to come back to to the ministry Hallelujah that's right those are wounded soldiers they are wounded soldiers all you need to do is to go and help them get their hands and bring them back to shine the devil it is not time to say yeah you see her I knew she wasn't going far oh you see him I knew he was going to fall that's not it the kingdom of God is for everybody God created us hallelujah to worship him my brother my sister per Adventure In Heaven There is houses and mansions like they say and maybe that person you have been shining is going to be your neighbor Oh Glory you open your door one morning you stretch yourself and that person as well opens and you look into their faces what then are you going to do my brother my sister Hallelujah GL let's go on let's go on not only that but one of the other things we are praying for for him he's not a Christian and that's the thing that's on your heart hallelujah how however listen to what the prophet is saying however I see another boy with you he is a kid about 10 years old and he is a preacher I'm still waiting to see a 10year old my God being a preacher my God hallelujah as we go on you realize that this was the desire of a mother all right my God this is a mother are representing a children in a prayer line one is not a Christian and is suffering from a heart disease and as well she has come she has got a severe case of nervousness wow she has brought yet another 10year old boy with her Hallelujah wow I see another boy with you and he's a kid about 10 years old and he's a preacher and here the one of the desires of your heart oh my one of the desires of your heart you be the judge I'm sure the prophet took a step back you wanting me to lay hands on that boy to bless that boy for his ministry h ah the devil has been working on these young boys to discourage them from coming to church to discourage them to hear the message but there's a boy here and a mother is called a mother a mother of proverbs 31 yes she's interceding for her children and there she is in the prayer line she's not feeling well as well but she says not even a w will remain behind not even my grand children are going to remain behind not my sister not my brother not my father hallelujah hallelujah she remembered that when you leave your mom and your father and everything behind for the sake of the gospel God is going to give you a 100 times more he's going to give you mothers he's going to give you fathers he's going to give you sisters he's going to give you brothers and even FS that's what the Bible says prise God hallelujah amen hallelujah amen thank you Lord and that's the thing on your heart however I see another boy with you and he's a kid about 10 years old and he is a preacher and here the one of the desires of your heart I'm talking about the impact of a desire amen hallelujah the one of the desires of your heart you be the judge you are wanting me to lay hands on that boy that was one of your desires if brother Bram can only lay the hands on that boy because that boy has got a Ministry wow wow Hallelujah yes sir listen to what the prophet says now he's answering the mother th thus say the Lord amen that say the Lord was never said Willy neilly when you hear the prophet saying that's say the Lord Brother it was coming direct from Heaven do you believe now you be the judge is that true come here s he's calling the little boy the little boy got his hair com back isn't it I seen him the little smooth faed boy come here s mother's prayer is to be answered tonight and I'm here to say as well the mother's prayer is going to be answered tonight not tomorrow but tonight before we leave here the mother's prayer must be answered if it is not answered then the word is a liar all you need to do is to believe and to be sincere the mother's prayer has to be answered tonight hallelujah hallelujah not even of a small Ministry boy but whatever you desire that desire must be answered tonight glory to God glory we have not believed this message for not that's right that's right I enjoy reading what brother Bram did during his time yes let there be and there was let there be in the was that's right you would speak things into existence things out of existence that's very good but we eat we feed on a fresh kill all right we want testimonies which are current you must have your own testimony the book of X must be Rewritten now we must reite the book of Acts Hallelujah we must rewrite the book of Acts my my my Hallelujah mother's prayer is to be answered tonight the prophet was specific he never said next week next month next year he said tonight God bless you my little brother now listen to the prayer that the prophet is now going to do he says our heavenly father I lay my hands upon this boy as your little servant as your little servant how many grown-ups are struggling to be in the message but the prophet is saying I lay my hands upon this boy as your little servant and perhaps someday I'll have to leave if Jesus stes and I pray that you will bless the child is the desire of his mother's heart and I pray that you'll anoint him may he never go into error but may he be a minister all the days of his life to preach the gospel to win songs to thee to God my brother my sister what more do you want he goes on and he says bless his dear Mother all right Hallelujah the mother is part of the equation the mother can never be separated all right Hallelujah yes praise be to God bless his dear Mother and the other things whatever it was that you reveal tonight that he has need of Amen what do you need tonight amen praise God Jesus amen when Solomon prayed to God that he needed wisdom God said I'm not only going to give you wisdom you buy one you get one free Hallelujah I am going to give you wealth Hallelujah and here the prophet is saying bless he Dear Mother and the other things I'm sure during that time when the mother was listening she started to add other things that she had not added I am encouraging you my brother my sister start adding other things as we read this quotation because the same anointing that was there during that time is here tonight we are speaking the Oracles of God we are reading what the prophet says I believe the prophet from ke to ke hallelujah hallelujah I pray that you will grant them and with my hand on the son and on the mother I pray that in Christ's name that you give to them the desire of their heart in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I ask it amen prise God my brother my sister we are in the same scenario amen that same lady was just like yourselves amen am if we don't emulate what the prophet did to that sister then we won't be able to get the benefits of the message my God my God my God he goes on to say God bless you sun and receive what you called for and God bless you and God bless you mother and give to you the desire of your heart go happy and I'm saying to you mothers tonight and fathers tonight go happy your desires have been answered your desires have been answered we have been we have been on this mountain too long we need to turn off hallelujah hallelujah I still come with the same message one day when I come back here you be a massive Church Hallelujah you be in a massive church I am throwing everything back to the devil the devil is a liar he can never stand in front of you for too long when we come back you'll be in a mansion of the church and you'll be praising God we are here to worship God and we are not selling drugs in here all we are doing is we are preaching the word of God yes sir whether the devil likes it or not we are going to a new [Applause] church with or without money we are going to the new church the Philistines have been standing in our way for too long but it is now time to kick them out and say move Satan move Satan move sat we are children of God we have got power Ed within us I am looking at atomic bombs as I look at you you are more than atomic bombs if the whole world need a solution the superpowers need a solution they should come and consult you to say what shall we do the moment you kneel down am I'm told even the feeble of all the feeblest of saints when that person kns them the devil takes flight hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen God bless you mother and give to you the desire of your heart go happy rejoicing the promise is yours amen God bless you honey if thou can't believe all things are possible now real Reverend just a moment as we are moving along in the meeting praise God hallelujah praise God now we come to the resurrection of Mo of of Lazarus my brother my sister these things you can only exercise if you're walking right all right yes sir amen if you're walking right brother Bram in the message the resurrection of Lazarus he says now if you want God to hear your prayer or send an angel to your home yes live right do right treat everybody right be right before God and God will grant that to you my God my brother this is not pretending if I go and shake my brother's hand here and say God bless you brother there must be something that Echoes to his heart amall amen hallelujah amen hallelujah it's not a question of pretending it's a question of being like David of old when he wanted anything David David will kneel down and say Lord you know me within and without if I'm wrong don't give me anything that I'm asking for and he would raise his arms and God would answer him that's why God says he was a man after my own heart amen hallelujah these things they need us to prepare a ground we need we need to do right amen if there was a time where you didn't like to greet another sister this is time to go to that sister and and hug her if there was a time where you were avoiding another brother this is the time to go and hug that brother so that the spirit of God can move freely within us remember the Holy Ghost is very timid when we come to those things the Holy Ghost will never come to to give you a blessing Hallelujah don't be like a magnet whereby the North Pole and the South Pole if you try to connect them they repel you want to bring the spirit of God in your homes or in the Church of God bring me a leak of fire from yourself another Le of fire from another brother another leak of fire from another sister when you bring it here it forms a big bow of fire where the devil can be defeated they say in English charity begins at home if you do right at your respective homes you bring in a good spirit in the home in the house of God the pastor won't even struggle to minister the word of God by just song service Alone song service alone you will say let's pick our bags and go home because the job has already been done hallelujah what am I saying tonight I am saying let's have a spirit of togetherness let's have love for one another let's say let's have that kind of empathy where if at all something wants to go to Sister Shar there you must jump inside and say before you go to Sister sharing you have got to pass through me first that is what we call laugh what brought the holy ghost in the upper room it was Oneness Hallelujah they waited for one day the Holy Ghost did not come waited for two days it did not come then another sister stood up she chewed a chewing gum before it ran out she gave it to another sister from there before the juice went out she gave it to another one there was Oneness there was Oneness no one thought this one is a disease or what there was equal sharing and when the Holy Ghost saw that he said I can now go down and he proved it by the way when he came in the Bible says even the cracks of the building they were filled with the power of the Holy Ghost why because of Oneness why because of unity until people started to speak in tongues Hallelujah and when they spoke in tongues and lady stood up and say oh brother ja daff by this time in two months we'll be in a new church the spirit of togetherness can bring God down and then we can now say d is no longer in heaven D is now within us we are small gods we can speak things into existence amen the people who are looking they started to say oh these people are drunk for sure they were drunk they were drunk with the Holy Ghost and they were say oh praise be to God praise be to God there's no sister who fell willyn when they fell down they fell in a gentle way to prove that it was the power of the Holy Ghost hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah in order for them to G that climax they had to live right they had to do right my brother my sister you are an ambassador of this church wherever you work wherever you go to school you are an ambassador of this church if you do anything wrong they will say you see that's Message Church you see their children how they behave hallelujah hallelujah praise be to God my I just tell me if I'm good on my time my brother I cannot close this without mentioning something I'm talking about sister Hannah sister Hanah had a desire am but she had a lot of penina around here praise God for the penas which are surrounding you my brother my sister don't worry about them our Prophet teaches us that whatsoever comes to a daughter or a son of God it is a taste before God so don't worry about all those things penina was pushing a push prom maybe a push prom that maybe accommodated one child she put three pushing it to anah she didn't want even to say good morning to annna but she was forced to go and say Hannah good morning oh son put your leg inside and Hannah was looking her heart was was bleeding penina was not coming to greet Hanah she was coming to show off Anna would say why are you squeezing the children in one push prom he said I'm I I have a lot of them I I have a lot of them my brother let them do that they don't

I'm I am saying prise God I want to find that word am that word is going to do you good that much I know hallelujah oh yes I've got it it is known as disruptive faith Hallelujah disruptive Faith disruptive Faith knows no protocol Hallelujah you can tell from the sister we had a blood issue she was restrained by the deacons she punched one Deacon the Deacon fell on his back she said let let me go the Tres went and she shook them around she climbed on top of the man because she was determined she had a desire to touch the H of Jesus Christ that's where her Revelation was she had a disruptive faith and that Disturbed Faith say to her if you don't act like this then you are not going to get what you want tonight my brother my sister I am inviting you to put on what is known as disruptive
