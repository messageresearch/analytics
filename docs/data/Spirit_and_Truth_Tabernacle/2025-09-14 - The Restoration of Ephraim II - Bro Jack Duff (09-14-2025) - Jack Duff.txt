Thank God for the specials that um have gone forth this morning as well. Uh just good to be back in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And um I just want to just kind of reiterate um the meeting with the the sisters after service. Some of you all may not be aware, but brother Troy lost his uncle um a couple weeks ago and they're doing the funeral on Saturday, which I'll be um uh preaching the funeral. And um so the family just needs our support with food and and things like that. brothers, we may need your help also with meat uh for this, but we'll just try to rally around the family to support them uh during this time of their loss. So, sisters, if y'all don't mind, uh please um see Sister Tina. They'll have a little meeting outside. You know, we kind of have to move out of the way, but we can do it outside. So, just make sure you you see her and and let's do all we can to support our deacon. Amen. um in in his loss. Praise the Lord. Um let me uh I think I think that's all I need to say. Let me let's go to the scripture and um we're going back to the book of Hosea and uh we'll read that chapter. And then there's a couple other passages that I'd like to read um after this, but I'll have you be seated and then we'll we'll we'll we'll navigate Amen. our way through this today. Hosea 14 is where I'm reading from. Amen. It says, "Oh Israel, return unto the Lord thy God, for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity." Uh take with you words and turn to the Lord, saying unto him, "Take away all my all iniquity." Say unto him, "Take away all iniquity." And receive us graciously. So will we render the cows of our lips. Asher shall not save us. We will not ride upon horses. Neither will we say anymore to the work of our hands. Ye are our gods. For in thee the fatherless findeth mercy. I love this. I will heal their backsliding. I will love them freely. Amen. For my anger is turned away from him. I will be as the dew um unto Israel. He shall grow as the lily and cast forth his roots as Lebanon. Uh his branches shall spread and his beauty shall be as the olive tree and his smell as Lebanon. They that dwell under his shadow uh shall return. They shall revive as the corn and grow as the vine. The scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon. Ephraim shall say, "What have I to do anymore with idols? I have heard him and observed him. I am like a green fur tree. from me is thy fruit found. Who is wise and he shall understand these things? Uh prudent and he shall know them. For the ways of the Lord are right, and the just shall walk in them, but the transgressors shall fall therein. Let's have a brief word of prayer. Father, we thank you for the reading of the word. We trust, oh God, that the Holy Spirit would uh help us, Lord, to to hear what the spirit is trying to say to us through this on today. That we would apply it and that our lives, oh God, would be pleasing uh unto thee. We thank you for all that has happened thus far in the service. What a wonderful anointing uh is here. And the anointing comes to destroy yolks. So, Father, we pray uh that you would do exactly what your word said that you would do. Take control of every thought, those that are being presented as well as those that are being received. And God, may you get all the glory, all the honor, and all the praise in this portion of the service. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Amen. You can be seated. Um the title, Amen. again uh is the restoration of Ephraim. Amen. The restoration of Ephraim. And um we started last week and um just kind of showing how Ephraim had gotten so um uh bound up in idols that in this book of Hosea um chapter 4 and verse 17 made a statement Ephraim is joined to idols let him alone and um and the previous verse talked about how Israel was backslitting and everything and you know it's it's it's it's you know just something to see and my thought was that you never want to get yourself to a spot uh with God where he say you join so much to the idols just leave them alone I I don't even want to deal with them no more you you never want to get to a spot like that. And and we tried to just uh as as I was, you know, um looking at this, I went and just looked at different um uh things that Brother Brandham identified as idols in our life and even in the dictionary. So, we we we brought all of that out on last week. But the other thing that that I didn't do last week, I I was I found that as I was bringing the sermon, even our daily Bible readings uh were actually dealing with Ephraim. So, I want to go back and read uh some of that this morning. We're going to go and just and catch um 2 Coronicles chapter 15 uh verse 1-9. Let's just kind of catch that. And you know, this is just where Ephraim was at the time that God said this. However, he did make them a promise that I'm going to heal their backsliding. Oh, what a promise. Oh, what a promise. Thank God for that. Amen. But 2 Chronicles chapter 15, let's just kind of pick this up and we'll see um a few things here. All right. Verse one, it says, "And the spirit of God came upon Azeriah the son of Oded, and he went out to meet Assa, and said unto him, hear ye me, a Assassa, and all Judah and Benjamin, the Lord is with you while you be with him." Now, that's that's that's the that's the that's the that's the critical part there. The Lord is with you while you be with him. Right? And it says, "And if ye seek him, he will be found of you, but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you." Now for as long season Israel hath been without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law. Uh but when they in their trouble did turn unto the Lord God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them. Amen. Uh verse 5 says, "And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries. And the nation was destroy and nation was destroyed of nation and city of city, for God did vex them with all adversity. Be ye strong, therefore, and let not your hands be weak, for your work shall be rewarded. I want to encourage you with that. Amen. Right out of the word of God. Be be strong. Don't let your hands be weak. Your work will be rewarded. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Sometimes it's just good read a promise from God. My work will be rewarded. That's right. Hallelujah. I'm reminded of a little candy bar that I received. Amen. Uh from one of the sisters here in the church and and she she she she uh bought a a Payday uh candy bar. That's a old candy bar. Not not not too many people remember them anymore, but she she she bought the Payday candy bar and she made a little note. She say, "Uh, brother Jack, keep on going because payday is coming after a while. That that's what we used to say in the old times. Payday is coming after a while. And that simply means your work going to be rewarded. God ain't forgot about nothing you have done. Your work shall be rewarded. Mama, your praying going to be rewarded. Daddy, your praying and your fasting going to be rewarded. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. God ain't forgot about his promises to you. Amen. Be ye strong, therefore, and let not your hands be weak, for your works shall be rewarded. Verse 8. And when Asa heard these words in the prophecy of Od uh the prophet, he took courage and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin and out of the cities which he had taken from Mount Ephraim. So look at where these idols were um that they had to get get rid of them out of the land of Israel. They were found in Mount Ephraim where the tribe of Ephraim was dwelling. All right. It says uh uh uh take had taken from Mount Ephraim and renew the altar of the Lord that was before the porch of the Lord. Let's skip here. We're going to go to 2 Chronicles chapter 25. This verse I mean 2 Chronicles 15 we just read. That was a scripture in our daily Bible reading that was on last Sunday. So I know we're in the right channel. Amen. And also uh 2 Chronicles 25. I think if it's not today, then it's going to be in tomorrow's weing reading. Uh but uh we find this over in 2 Chronicles 25:5. Amen. It says this. Moreover, um Amaziah gathered Judah together and made them captains over thousands. captains over hundreds according to the houses of their fathers throughout all Judah and Benjamin. And he numbered them from 20 years old and above and found them 300,000 choice men able to go forth to war uh that could handle spear and shield. Verse 6 says, "He hired also a 100,000 mighty men of valor out of Israel for 100 talents of silver." Uh, but there came a man of God to him, saying, "Oh king, let not the army of Israel go with thee, for the Lord is not with Israel to wit with all the children of Ephraim." So this man has hired this army from the children of Israel to go with him to battle. And a prophet has to come tell him say, "You better send Israel back." And the reason God is not with Israel is because of Ephraim. &gt;&gt; Oo Lord have mercy. that you wouldn't want that to be your story. &gt;&gt; That God had to tell people you need to separate from this one because you you about to be defeated in battle because this one's on your side. &gt;&gt; This is how bad Ephraim got &gt;&gt; that God had to send prophets to say you better you better not go to war with them because you going to lose if Ephraim show up. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that? Ephraim was bringing Amen. almost uh tragedy to amen to to the whole nation because of the sins that they were involved in. You know, we can go back and look at uh uh the story of um um the fell in the book of Joshua. Uh I can't think it Achen. Achen, you know, same story because Israel started losing men in battle because Achen had idol gods in his midst, &gt;&gt; right? I mean, he took money. He took Babylonian garments. He he had all these things that he was doing and it caused men to die, &gt;&gt; right? So, so we never want to find ourselves in a position like this with God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's not frustrate his grace &gt;&gt; and make his grace a disgrace. [Music] &gt;&gt; Let us go further here. Amen. Verse um verse 7. But there came a man of God to him saying, "Oh, oh, oh king, let not the army of Israel go with thee, for the for the Lord is not with Israel to wit with all the children of Ephraim." It says, "But if thou wil go do it, be strong for the battle God shall make thee, God shall make thee fall before the enemy, for God hath power to help and to cast down." And Amaziah said to the man of God, "But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel?" So, he done paid this money to get uh the army of Israel and and see maybe what he should have did was got some advice before he paid that money. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, his money lost because you done joined up with &gt;&gt; Ephraim. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right. And he said he says and and Amziah said to the man of God, "But but what shall we do for the 100 talents which I have given to the army of Israel?" And the man of God answered, "The Lord is able to give thee much more than this." &gt;&gt; Woo. Woo. Maybe you got some money tied up with Ephraim. &gt;&gt; And and that's the reason you want to let go certain things because you got money tied up somewhere. But God is God is able to give you more than the money that you got tied up with Ephraim. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just let Ephraim go. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. Ephraim is represented in so many things, right? I mean these idol worship it's it's represented. So sometimes it can be in a relationship. Sometime people can't go further in God because they tied to something that they shouldn't be tied to. &gt;&gt; Let go of Ephraim. What more do I have to do with these idols? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Here verse verse 10 says uh then Amziah separated them. And this is where God wants us to come to a place of separation. Then Amziah separated them to whip the army that was come to him out of out of Ephraim to go home again. Wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah and they returned home in great anger. Mhm. Mhm. When you separating from some stuff, folk going to get upset with you. &gt;&gt; You can expect that. Well, I don't want to make them upset when you don't make God upset. &gt;&gt; You understand? God is so upset. He said he says, "Ephim to his idols. got nothing to do with him no more. &gt;&gt; You don't want God to get upset with you. I rather for man to be upset with me than God to be upset with me any day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But this just kind of paints the picture for us to help us understand, you know, what happened here and how Ephraim got in this condition. And and today I'm going back and I I as we talk about the restoration of Ephraim because that's the title. But but in order to understand the restoration, you got to understand how far people had fallen, how far Ephraim had fallen. And um and we want to just take our time here today and look at uh I am going to slide 10. Uh we want to take our time and just look at something here. Praise the Lord. I want to go back and give some history here to to Ephraim. All right. The scripture said, "Ephraim shall say,"What have I to do anymore with idols? Is this restoration's going to happen?" And and and this was a scripture that I I was reading and I was I I don't know. I I've uh many people that I've talked to. I have read the Bible through and through uh for many years. I I don't I can't even count how many years it's been. Uh but uh I can tell you this much. No matter how much you read the Bible through and through, God gonna always have something that you ain't seen before. &gt;&gt; And and and it happened to me just a few weeks ago when I was reading here in Hosea, and I was like, "Oh, wait a minute. I've always known Ephraim to kind of be uh in a situation where they were isolated and separated, but I never saw the restoration side of it." Hallelujah. And what we want to look at here is just this frustration side because Hosea 14:8, Ephraim shall say, hallelujah. What have I to do anymore with idols? I have heard him. I've heard the Lord speak to me. I've heard his voice. And it and it says, I've heard him and observed him. I am like a green fur tree. From me is thy fruit found. So Ephraim comes to a spot where, you know, I don't want anything more to do with idols. Now, when we're looking at Ephraim in this particular passage of scripture, we're not looking at a individual, &gt;&gt; but we're looking at a tribe. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's very important that we understand that. Now, I'm going to take you back and show you because I got the question, who is Ephraim? Who is Ephraim? Let's go back and see this tribe. The tribe comes from an individual. &gt;&gt; Amen. But, but when we're looking at in Hosea, the the the individual is already long gone. But now, this is the tribe that came at them. and how they got in and and just engulfed in idol worship. Hallelujah. Let's go hit next on that on that slide for me. Uh here is the the beginning of Ephraim. It's uh the story of Joseph found in Genesis 41 verse 51 and 52. And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh. The God said, "He hath made me forget all my toil and all my father's house." Now, I mean, we got under just just a quick review. Amen. Joseph was sold by his brothers into slavery. Uh, ended up down there in Egypt and and as he's there in Egypt, uh, he, uh, he's working for this guy, Piper. And, uh, and Piper's wife decides to try to frame Joseph. Amen. Because she could not get him to, uh, to sleep with her. Hallelujah. Amen. and and and when uh when when when when when this happened, she frames him and and comes up with this lie and Joseph get thrown into prison, the man never did one thing wrong and all these seem to be bad things were happening to him. The thing I love about the scripture is that with all the bad stuff that happened to Joseph, y'all better hear me on this one. &gt;&gt; I said every bad thing that happened to Joseph, anybody got some bad stuff happening to them? But I got good news for you because this is what this is what the Bible say. With all the bad things sold into slavery, lied on by Piper's wife, ends up in prison, but all the bad things that happened to Joseph, the Bible says the Lord was with Joseph. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Even when it look like your life is being turned upside down, I'm here to tell you this morning, the Lord is still with you. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. But Joseph ends up in this situation and and and finally uh he he meets the butler and the baker in prison and he and he interprets dreams for them and he tells the the baker what would happen and tells the butler what would happen and and uh and the butler was going to be restored to his position, but the baker was going to lose his life. But he tells the butler say, "Don't forget me down here now. Tell tell them tell them where you you know tell them about me down here. I'm not supposed to be here in this jail. Two years go by before this man remembers that Joseph is in the prison. &gt;&gt; Joseph comes out of the prison when Pharaoh has some dreams that he cannot interpret. And then Butler says, "You know what? Forgive me. I remember a guy down in prison &gt;&gt; that interpreted my dreams &gt;&gt; and everything he told me happened. &gt;&gt; And everything he told a baker happened. I believe whatever this man tell you is going to happen. &gt;&gt; He down there in the prison. You better go get him out. And Joseph comes to Pharaoh's court and uh and he begins to uh they share the dreams. And Jo Joseph begins to interpret the dreams. And then he gave him some advice. After he interpreted the dreams, he said, "Now look, I would advise you to find yourself a wise man to prepare for this great famine that's about to hit the land. You're going to have seven years of plenty and then you're going to have seven years of famine. And the famine going to be so bad that the years of plenty going to look like it never even happened. &gt;&gt; So you going to need yourself a wise man to help sustain the entire country &gt;&gt; during this famine time. &gt;&gt; It says okay. And Joseph's on his way back to prison taking his walk &gt;&gt; and and Pharaoh said, "Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up. Wait before you go. Before you go, it says there in the man said we need a wise man &gt;&gt; that can help us. Amen. Uh uh sustain during this famine time. He's telling us what's going to happen. Say now is there anybody &gt;&gt; in this kingdom more wise &gt;&gt; than this this prisoner &gt;&gt; now? And now they was in a tough spot. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Cuz if somebody would have stood up and say, "Well, yeah, &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; I'm more qualified than him." &gt;&gt; If they would have stood up and said that, then the next question would have been, "How come you didn't give me the interpretation of the dreams?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See, God know how to fix it &gt;&gt; that you the only one that's qualified to do the job. [Applause] He eliminate all the other resumes. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So since nobody stood up to say I'm more wise than this man, he say well this fell ain't going back to prison. &gt;&gt; He just went from prison to vice president. [Music] &gt;&gt; Boy, God bypass processes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just got to let God do it &gt;&gt; because he he got a great way of doing it. And and and when he does it, he did it in front of everybody. So they knew what his title was, what his position was. You better not try to come against him. You better not try to set him up &gt;&gt; cuz Pharaoh be coming after you. &gt;&gt; God used Joseph during that time to help sustain. And and not only that, but Joseph was given a wife. She was a a priest's uh daughter and and when he was given his wife, this is where he has his children born and um the firstborn is by the name of Manasseh. Uh the Bible tells us Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh. For God said, "He has made me forget all my toil, &gt;&gt; everything I went through." &gt;&gt; See, and can I tell you something? Even when you when you gave your child a name, &gt;&gt; the name had a significance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When when when see when Joseph looks at Manasseh and even when he calls his name, &gt;&gt; what what what what Joseph saying, Manasseh, God made me forget about everything I went through. &gt;&gt; Now, at this point in time, Joseph is not looking at his he's not he doesn't know if his father's still alive. He don't know if his brother's still alive. He don't know nothing, right? But he but but when he looks at Manasseh, Manasseh, you tell me that God has caused me, Amen, to just for forget about all my toils. If &gt;&gt; if I could just sit down and and talk to you, Manasse, and tell you how I even got to Egypt. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But God has made me forget about all because he gave me you, Manasse. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. my firstborn. The name of the firstborn, Manasse, for God said, "He hath made me forget all my toil and and my father's house and all my father's house." The next verse says, "In the name of the second, call he Ephraim. For God have caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction." Now, now, now, now I have it on the screen there. Go back and look at Hosea 14:8 there on the screen. Because Ephraim shall say, "What have I to do anymore with idols? I have heard him and observed him. I am like a green fur tree. From me is thy fruit found." Now remember his name. Amen. meant that God caused me to be fruitful &gt;&gt; in the land of my affliction. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, what is going on here is Ephraim is recognizing, Amen. are coming into Amen. a full understanding of his identity. &gt;&gt; And as brothers and sisters in Christ, when we get away from the Lord, it's it's it's a good thing to come, amen, into our understanding of who we really are. Even the prodigal son had to come to that understanding. &gt;&gt; Amen. That no I can live better in my father's house as a servant &gt;&gt; than I can live out here with these pigs. But when it comes to a a grip, amen, within himself that I'm better than this, &gt;&gt; God may made me for more than this. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's then that God can begin to move &gt;&gt; and bring you back into a place &gt;&gt; of restoration. &gt;&gt; Ephraim Ephraim says that there the the tribe of Ephraim recognize their their their their their orin. Hallelujah. And they can say, I've heard him and observed him. I am like a green fur tree. for me is thy fruit found. We also find we pray uh uh next Genesis 48 and5 this is where Joseph's father has come and back into his life. the the famine has come and famine has driven uh people from even outside of Egypt back into uh back down into Egypt because they they people found out, you know, now look, there's famine all around, but but we found that they they had food down there in Egypt and and and and Jacob's boys come to him and say, "Now, now look, we're going to have to go down to Egypt to get some food." Say, "Okay, go on down there and get yourself some food and and bring it back to the family." And when he get down there, oh my, Joseph thought he had forgotten all his toil &gt;&gt; and that he had forgot about his father's house. But his brothers show up on one day &gt;&gt; and when he looks to see his brothers, he start counting and he knew he knew it. Now, now here's the other beautiful thing about all of this is that Joseph was in a different place at the time that his brothers showed up. He was at a different place in his heart, sir. Right? And and this is what need to happen to you. You you got to be in a different place when God is bringing restoration to somebody. You got to be in a different place where you can receive them. &gt;&gt; Now, Joseph had the power and Joseph had the authority to go here and try to Amen. and try to uh uh uh I mean, he could have wre some real havoc amongst his brothers. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. But but we can see that God had changed something on the inside of Joseph where he did not want to do these things. &gt;&gt; But he had to do things in a certain way &gt;&gt; that it would prove where these brothers were. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he began to ask him questions. Just talk to him a little bit and tell me a little bit about your daddy and tell me about your your family history and all of that and give me give me some give me give me something to work with here. We got this many brothers and our daddy is still alive and this that and the other and said we got one brother that died. &gt;&gt; Is that right? How did he die &gt;&gt; and he just working it and and everything and then he finally get them to the end and he says, "I tell you what, y'all going to have to prove to me whether y'all daddy's still alive and this other younger brother that you say is at the house. Y'all going to have to bring that younger brother here." And it was Joseph's physically blood brother. &gt;&gt; They had the same father and the same mother. Now these other brothers had the same father but not the same mother. But Benjamin was the brother that was the same father and same mother and and his mother had died. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So here you know uh he said I'm going to have to keep one of y'all back. And and I I I didn't I didn't get all this together but I I believe it was Simeon. Okay. All right. Simeon had to stay back and uh and when he stays back, you know, it say now now if if y'all want y'all this brother, y'all going to have to come back. &gt;&gt; Well, the brothers leave, camel's loaded with all this all the goods and to get back down there to the daddy and the daddy say, "Um, uh, I'm happy to have all the food, but I'm missing another son. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I'm missing another son. &gt;&gt; Every time y'all boys get together to do &gt;&gt; things just I don't know what it is with y'all, but why do I miss miss children? Y'all take off. &gt;&gt; They say, "Daddy, we he asked this question. He asked that question. We told him this. We told him that." Said, "Why did you even tell him that? &gt;&gt; Why did you tell him you had another brother? Why did you say these things?" said, "Dad," and the man asked us questions. We just We didn't know he was going to do this. And I believe now they kept Simeon, but now I think it's Judah that steps up and says, "You know, now uh he says now, you know, we going to have to go back when we run out of food, Dad. We got to go back down there." Say, "No, I don't." And and we got to take Benjamin with us. And I believe Judah steps up and he says, "Now, Daddy, you can take my sons, &gt;&gt; right?" I believe it's Judah, right? And he says, "You can take my sons if we don't bring Benjamin back." He's like, like, "No, I ain't. Uhuh. I I ain't sending Benjamin. No, I ain't sending Benjamin. I No. Uhuh. Uhuh. No. Y'all could just forget about it. Daddy, the whole all of us are dying here. We got no more food. We got to take Benjamin." He finally agrees. Y'all let Benjamin say, "But y'all don't let me go down to my grave with with I done lost three sons." &gt;&gt; And and blessed be the name of the Lord. Benjamin shows up with his brothers back into Egypt and Joseph sees them. &gt;&gt; And and when Joseph seized them, Joseph, he's about to lose it. &gt;&gt; This is this is my blood. &gt;&gt; You know, he thought that with Manasses first born again, I forget all my toil. at all my father's house. I'll forget all that. But but but now all this is being rehearsed in his mind of all that has happened. But but but but for some reason he can see through this exchange &gt;&gt; that these brothers have also changed from the time that they told the daddy that he was dead. They they've changed because they're they're willing now to put their lives out. Amen. On behalf of their brother Simeon. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And also bring Benjamin. Not knowing what would happen with Benjamin. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; They come down there and Joseph prepares them a meal and when he sits them up at the table, he puts them all from the oldest to the youngest. And they looking like, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Uh, why you got us sitting like this?" The brothers are blind to the fact that this is their brother. &gt;&gt; They still in their mind following that lie &gt;&gt; that he was dead. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's what they going with in their mind. But not even realize our brothers right here. And Joseph was always using an interpreter to kind of talk to them. He would never even let him know that I understand everything y'all saying. I hear everything you're saying and I can talk your language, but I'm just not going to do that just yet. &gt;&gt; They're going through and he just setting them all up and he gives Benjamin a greater portion than the rest of them. Like, why would he get a greater portion? What is going on around here? And finally it comes out. Joseph had to put every way put everybody out as he was breaking down in tears. I'm Joseph &gt;&gt; your brother you who &gt;&gt; I'm Joseph &gt;&gt; your brother. And then he says come near me. It's oh my goodness. And then they began, oh, what is this? They didn't know what the this man is in this much power &gt;&gt; and he can do whatever he want to do against us right now. But no, he didn't do none of that. &gt;&gt; He says, "I'm going to send you back home to your daddy and tell daddy to come down here and see me. Tell him you tell him his son liveth." &gt;&gt; Tell him his son liveth. and and see that dream that he had way back when he saw the the moon and the stars bowing down and and and and he say said now they when they interpreted you mean your mama and your me and your mama going to bow down to your brothers. Well, here it's happening right here. &gt;&gt; The dream was coming to pass. God has given you dreams and they shall come to pass. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Joseph said, "Go get daddy and bring him." He said, "I'mma do something else." Boy, this restoration is deep. They thought they paid the money for all the food and and all the other things as they're going back on the second trip. And Joseph restored their money and put it in their sacks. &gt;&gt; Now, he did that for a reason. and he puts it in the sack and and then he puts a a a cup inside Benjamin's bag. &gt;&gt; And and then he he he he says, "Now let him leave." He tells his servants, "Let him leave and go out the the city for a little bit. But then I want you to follow them. And when you follow them, find the one that got the cup and say he got to come back." Well, they out running away and uh going back to going back home, they surround them, come chase them down. Who stole my master's cup? We didn't steal no cup. We wouldn't do nothing like that. The one that we found the cup with, that's the one that's coming back. Well, they went from the oldest to the youngest. &gt;&gt; Got down to Benjamin. And here's the cup in Benjamin's bag. And actually this is where Judah stood up. Judah says, Judah says, "Please don't take my younger brother. My daddy would die if you take my younger brother, but take me." Why is it that Judah stands up? H. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; is the lion &gt;&gt; from the tribe &gt;&gt; of Judah. &gt;&gt; And he took your place. &gt;&gt; You should have died for the sins that you committed, but he took your place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When he found that you were in trouble, he took your place when you couldn't help yourself. He took your place. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Here they finally get back down there to daddy and they tell daddy everything that happened. And the best news that daddy could find or hear is that Joseph &gt;&gt; is alive. And and here's here's here's the other thing that that that the scripture says when when they told Israel or Jacob when they told him that the that Joseph was still alive, Joseph said, "Now, daddy, when you I'm I'm sinning for you, but regard not your stuff. &gt;&gt; Don't Don't worry about how much stuff you got. and and I got this and I got that and I've accumulated this and I've accumulated. No, regard not your stuff. When it's time to forsake your idols, forget about them business relationships you done made and you done did this and you done did that. God can bless you with more if you would just be obedient. &gt;&gt; Here comes Israel down there to Egypt. Jacob. He sees his son Joseph and he's just elated with what he sees and can't believe that my boy has risen to this level of power in this country at a time of this great famine. I I just man this is unbelievable. My family done made it to this level. My family my son &gt;&gt; oh my did something for him. So, so, so, so when Joseph gets there and his daddy's there, I'm talking about who is who is Ephraim. And he gets there, verse five and and and and um I'm sorry, go back to uh to the last slide. Genesis 48:5 says, "And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt, before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine, as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine." So, Jacob lays claims on these two boys. Now, notice in that scripture in verse five, he says, "Ephraim and Manasseh are mine." Now really it probably should have been Manasseh and Ephraim are mine, &gt;&gt; but he said Ephraim and Manasseh are mine. And the reason it should have been Manasseh and Ephraim because over there in in Genesis 41, Manasseh was firstborn. &gt;&gt; Ephraim was second born. So it should have been Manasseh and Ephraim is mine. &gt;&gt; It shows a respect &gt;&gt; to the firstborn. But Jacob says, Ephraim and Manasseh &gt;&gt; which are born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt are mine. H. Now, I don't want to dig too deep into that, but I don't believe it was any favoritism or anything going on, but there was something deeper there. Something similar to predestination. Oh, the power of it. The power of predestination. Because Ephraim was second born, there was there's a there's a there's a a a what we call a birthright and a blessing that goes to the firstborn. &gt;&gt; But Eve from being secondborn should not have been involved in any of this. But look, look at what the scripture says. Let's go on to the next slide. Genesis 48:9. This was time for Jacob to finally leave. Well, not not leave, but he he actually wanted to pray over um Joseph's sons. Look at this. Joseph said unto his father, "They are my sons whom God hath given me in this place." And he said, "Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them." Now, notice notice this this verse in verse 10. Uh it says, "Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age so he could not see and he brought them near unto him and he kissed them and embraced them." Now there's something I want you to catch there in that dim for dim uh for age. Now there was a uh hereditary issue happening in this family &gt;&gt; because uh Isaac also begin to lose his eyesight &gt;&gt; and his eyesight was so bad &gt;&gt; that when it was time to bless his sons, you know, Jacob stole that birthright &gt;&gt; and the blessing, &gt;&gt; right? And uh and when it was and and and when he stole the blessing, he tricked his daddy by getting dressed up in some Halloween costume, if I can just put it that way. Hallelujah. But actually, the mama helped him just kind of put on these certain clothes and amen certain skins so to make it seem like you're a hairy child because your brother got a bunch of hair and you ain't got no hair. &gt;&gt; But we going to trick your daddy. And the only way they could trick him is through feeling and thing like that because the man could not see. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Even even when when when Jacob shows up, he say uh it it's it it sound like it feel like uh Esau's skin, but it sound like Jacob voice. &gt;&gt; So something ain't right about this man. I I know I can't see, but it just say, "Are you really? Are you really Are you really really Esau? Yeah. How did you get the food so fast? How'd you bring this this this venison to me? How did you do that so fast? Well, the Lord blessed me. You just lying. It's all right. And he gave that boy a blessing. When he got the blessing, Esau come running in with the venison. Daddy, I got the venison. I said, "Son, well, who is that I just blessed? My brother done stole my blessing as well as he stole my birthright over over pottage or or or or uh lentils a pot of lentils. The man lost his whole birthight over a pot of lentils. He he was just too hungry. He just didn't care. So what we see here is this there's a uh both uh Isaac had this problem with his eyes and then we also see that uh Jacob uh is now having this problem with his eyes because the Bible says now the eyes of Israel were dimmed for age so that he could not see and he brought them near unto him and he kissed them and embraced them and Israel said unse I have I had not thought to see thy face I didn't think I'd ever see you again and lo God have showed me also thy seed. Not just you, but I see my grandchildren. &gt;&gt; This meant something. This is the the the history of Ephraim. Man, he's connected to some great people, right? But but but here in verse verse 13, and Joseph brought them out from between his knees and he bowed himself with his face to the earth. So Joseph has his face to the face to the earth and he brings the his sons to his daddy for the blessing. And look at this now. And and this I'm I'm going just say something here before I go further than that. Um back in back in those times, the fathers would always give a blessing. And I still believe that's something that's that's I think fathers should bless their children. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, let me I got a couple things I'm getting ready to say here. Y'all just bear with me. um few Christmases ago, we were all gathered there in um in in um Indiana at my daughter's uh for Christmas and all my children there showing up and grandchildren, everything. And um so at that moment it was a very special moment I felt for me because um my wife said something to the to to my girls and said something about how she was proud of them and uh my daughter's like well uh if you're proud of us uh can you be more specific about why you proud of us? I said boy that's something. and they set their mom up and uh they was playing with her but but I thought it was it was just one of those moments and uh and and my wife said, "Yeah, I I can be more specific on that." And so she began to go kid by kid why she was proud. Now, as a father and I'm sitting there listening to that, ain't no way I'mma let this moment pass without me saying something. So I went from each daughter saying how I was proud of them. Then I also brought in my son-in-laws and told them how I was proud of them. &gt;&gt; And we spoke blessings over our children &gt;&gt; in that moment. &gt;&gt; Now when my father was passing, we did something a little different. My daddy was in the hospital and all of us kids happened to be there at the same time. And I said, you know, if all of us being here at the same time, we going to bless daddy. They say when a person is passing, the last thing to leave is actually hearing. So I wanted daddy to hear. All of us bless him. So we all gathered around that bed. And I think we started from the youngest and went to the oldest. My brother Troy being the oldest, he was the last one to speak. But each one had a chance to tell daddy how grateful we was for him. We blessed our daddy before he left here. &gt;&gt; Joseph took them both. Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand. So Ephraim, it says, was in his right hand and he was moving it towards Israel's left hand. Okay. So, and then he takes Manasseh in his left hand and he's moving them towards the right hand and he brought them near unto him. Now, this was the proper way to do things, right? Because Manasseh is firstborn. However, verse 14 says, "Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand, praise God, upon Manass's head, guiding his hands willingly, for Manasseh was the firstborn." So rather than pray for these boys like this, he prays like this. And his right hand right signifies power and authority. &gt;&gt; So the right hand ends up over on Ephraim. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the left hand ends up on Manasseh. Now the um the issue, let's go on to the next slide. Verse verse 15 says, "And he blessed Joseph and said, God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God which fed me all my life unto this day, the angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads, and let my name be named on them." This is important. This is really important. I don't know if we're going to get to it today, but this is very important. I'mma just I'mma just go get get way ahead of myself. Let my name be named upon them. It allow Ephraim to be a part of the 12 tribes. &gt;&gt; Lord help us Jesus. I don't know if we can get all that today, but it allowed Ephraim to become part of the 12 tribes. &gt;&gt; Let my name be named among them. &gt;&gt; Named on them, named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac, and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth. And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, now Joseph's head was down to the ground, but he happened to look up and he said, "Wait a minute." He say he said he he saw he saw saw that this as father laid his hand uh right hand upon the head of Ephraim. It it displeased him and he held up his father's hand in the middle of a prayer. &gt;&gt; Daddy, take your hand off of Ephraim. No, don't don't do this, daddy. No, that's not the way it's supposed to be done. had his hands crossed. &gt;&gt; It says he and he held up his father's hand to remove it from Ephraim unto Manass's head. Oh my my my. The next verse says, "And Joseph said unto his father, not so, my father, for this is the firstborn. Put thy right hand upon his head." Remember, his eyes are dim, &gt;&gt; but he still knows what he's doing, &gt;&gt; but it's all for a purpose. He &gt;&gt; He does it this way. This is This is This is Ephraim's history. &gt;&gt; Oh my my my. Sometimes when you can go back and look at where a person come from. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; And and I like to say like this. it it I mean it you're going from point A to point B. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of things that happen in between those points, &gt;&gt; but you going to get to where you supposed to go, &gt;&gt; especially when it comes to God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's and and look at this verse. First verse verse 19 says, "And his father refused and said, I know it, my son. I know it. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great." And he just uh Can you just this old daddy? Uh-uh. Don't don't don't move my hands. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Imm No. I I got to do it this way. And I know he the firstborn son. And yeah, he going to be blessed, too. Oh my my. He also shall become a people, and he shall also be great. But truly his younger brother shall be greater than he and his seed shall become a multitude of nations which mean he'll be fruitful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 20 says and he blessed him that day saying and thee shall Israel bless saying God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh. And he said he from before Manasseh that let my name be named on them. It brought a future blessing over Ephraim because he was a part of the 12 tribes of Israel. And also that showed that there would be a restoration because Ephraim got to a spot, that tribe got to a spot in their journey where God said Ephraim to his idols. I got no more to do with them. &gt;&gt; All from this to now God don't want nothing to do with you. &gt;&gt; You better We got to watch what steps we take. I mean, you can be blessed at the beginning, but it's what you're doing in between. &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Don't be a one hit wonder. &gt;&gt; Be consistent in your walk with Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And how many We done had so many them testimonies throughout the years. We used to sing that song all the time. Restoration is finally come. &gt;&gt; And we But we sung it over and over again. Restoration has finally come for the same people. And like, uh, if if it's finally come, it should stay. &gt;&gt; They should only have to sing that song one time for you. &gt;&gt; But don't don't get so don't get so so so so engulfed in in in your idols and your sins and all that that you come on now. &gt;&gt; You ought to do things that get you closer to God. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to say this to all my young people. We got we got Sunday school on Sunday mornings at 8:45. Get yourself in that Sunday school class. Uh get to learning these church ages. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Do the homework assignments so that you can spend time with God. &gt;&gt; There's not just no Sunday morning, &gt;&gt; you know, thing that we do. &gt;&gt; This is going to be something that we do throughout the week. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; All right. So, uh, here we we we we see we see this, but let let's just kind of go cuz I could have just stopped and preached there, but I'm going to just read it to you from the prophet. This next slide, remember Joseph, I mean, Jacob crossed his hands while he was praying for Ephraim. And from Nasse, he should have prayed for Manasseh. He should have had his right hand over that first that firstborn son, but he had it on Ephraim's head. Now the reason that that was because it was symbolic. &gt;&gt; This was the only time in scripture that we see the crossing of the hands like that. &gt;&gt; But this was very symbolic of something that was happening for our day. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The prophet tells it to us. He says, "But notice another glorious revelation in this typing of Joseph. Joseph while in Egypt was given a gentile bride. And through her he received a family of two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh." Even the prophet puts the names the same way Jacob did. &gt;&gt; All right? Ephraim and Manasseh. Joseph asked his father to bless the two boys. He placed them in front of Jacob so that Manasseh, the firstborn would be on Jacob's right hand and Ephraim to the left. As Jacob was about to bless him, he crossed his hands. So that the right hand fell upon the younger, Joseph cried out, "Not so, father. This is the firstborn to your right." But Jacob said, "God has crossed my hands." Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Here in type &gt;&gt; we see that the blessing which belonged to the firstborn the Jew hallelujah was given over to the younger the gentile and through the cross. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hey, through the cross, through Jesus dying on a cross and the Jews rejecting him and putting him on the cross, that's how the blessing came to us, the Gentiles. It was through the cross. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my my my my. Amen. &gt;&gt; Here in type we see the blessing which belonged to the firstborn, the Jew was given over to the younger of the Gentile through the cross cross hands of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The blessing comes through the cross. &gt;&gt; And it says Galatians 3:13-14, Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us. It is written, "Cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree, that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the of the spirit through faith." The blessing of Abraham came through the cross to the Gentile. The Jews rejected the cross. Therefore, Jesus got the Gentile bride. Can you I mean, Brother Brandham told us that when we're when we're reading scripture, we ought to look in there, we have to see Christ in every scripture. in this whole story of Jacob actually crossing his hands &gt;&gt; while praying for Ephraim, the younger son, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Oh my my. And can you can you what what he's saying? Ephraim would have represented the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; And he's exactly right because we Gentiles were worshiping idol gods. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Before we came to Christ, &gt;&gt; we we were idol worshippers before before we knew anything about God. We were idol worshippers. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And and see that that here's the thing that that idol worship if the Gentiles kind of grew up that way, that thing would be in your nature. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And only the blood of Jesus Christ can get that stuff out of your nature. &gt;&gt; Cuz it's easy to go back to what you always was. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why you need the Holy Ghost to keep you out of them places. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's easy to get back into idol worship. Amen. &gt;&gt; We got to fight daily. &gt;&gt; Amen, church. &gt;&gt; Thank God for this blessing that came through the cross. Amen. Let me see where I'm at. All right. I got I got a lot more to give y'all. And I I don't have a lot of time. So, I I got 15 more slides. and um Lord help me Jesus. &gt;&gt; And I'm not going to rush through it. I'mma tell you that much. So I'm going just I'mma find I'mma find a place to to get out and um and it'll be a part three. &gt;&gt; Let me um let me just um come back to this next slide. So Ephraim just say what have I to do anymore with idols? I have heard him and observed him. I'm like a green fur tree. For me is thy fruit found. Now, um, in the Bible, the green fur tree or simply the green tree often symbolizes life, vitality, uh, the enduring presence of God. So, I'm like a green fur tree. It's like it it symbolizes life, vitality, enduring presence of God. And also, it's a metaphor for resilience. Oh my, I I I like that. And see as as a believer sometimes you have to demonstrate resilience. &gt;&gt; Brother Random preached a message perseverance, &gt;&gt; right? And I'm talking about when everything is against you, &gt;&gt; I mean the devil done threw the devil done threw the kitchen sink at you. &gt;&gt; Right? Throwing everything he can at you. But but but when you can when you can look the devil in the eye &gt;&gt; and say I am like a green fur tree. Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to understand these metaphors. &gt;&gt; I'm like a green fur tree. That mean I'm resilient. &gt;&gt; Quit ain't in me. &gt;&gt; Giving up. I don't even taught that kind of language. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It It's something in me that tell me to go ahead &gt;&gt; and I'mma keep pressing through everything. Like mama say I'm still still pressing my battle. &gt;&gt; I'm bound and determined to go on all the way. That's right. &gt;&gt; And and like auntie say, it's going to take a stronger wind than that, &gt;&gt; right? I mean, devil can throw everything at you, &gt;&gt; but I'm like a green fur tree. &gt;&gt; It's a metaphor for resilience, especially in the face of adversity, and can rep and and being like a green virtue can represent hope, divine blessing. And I like this one. And restoration. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. And and and look at it says the evergreen nature of the fur tree also connects it to the concept of eternal life and God's unchanging nature. So so you know and we all are familiar with this the the next uh thing. The evergreen trees are cor characterized by their year round foliage meaning they retain their leaves and needles throughout all seasons. and and and a evergreen tree. &gt;&gt; I'm like a green fur tree, which means I'm I'm an evergreen. Oh, come on, y'all. Y'all got it. &gt;&gt; I'm an evergreen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If I had to be tight to a tree, you know, they ask these questions. If if you could be, amen, a a tree, what tree would you be? If you can be this and what what would you be? If you could be an animal, what animal would you be? They ask all these kind of question. But but me, I'm going to tell you, I'm a evergreen. &gt;&gt; I'm like a green fur tree. &gt;&gt; You understand what a evergreen? The reason I choose to be evergreen is because I'm always green. &gt;&gt; In the summer, &gt;&gt; I'm green. &gt;&gt; Huh? In the spring, &gt;&gt; I'm green. &gt;&gt; When the leaves are falling off the other trees in the fall, &gt;&gt; I'm still green, &gt;&gt; brother. when the sap is going down and to the leaves of the other trees. Hallelujah. To try to preserve them during the winter season. I don't need that process because I'm green. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm not just green. I'm evergreen. &gt;&gt; This is what this is what the scriptur is telling us. He says, "I'm he says I I am like a green fern tree." &gt;&gt; When you begin to recognize who you are, &gt;&gt; right? I mean, it's No, no, no, no. I I've been through this. I've been through that. And this what this why they said Ephraim should say, "What have I to do anymore with idols? I've heard them. God, I heard you speaking to me. &gt;&gt; I hear your voice. That ain't just the voice of brother Jack, but Lord, that that's you speaking to me. &gt;&gt; And since I I heard you, not only did I hear you, but I observed, I mean, I'm really involved in this. And and and and I don't know about you, but as a God speaking to me something like this, I'm going to try to find ways to get rid of idols. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; I mean, I just start thinking in my mind, what what can I do, &gt;&gt; Lord? What can I do? I I like I told y'all when I I read the read the definition, they talk about idols can be like soccer and celebrities and stuff like this, but but uh for me, football is my it's a it's a problem. Basketball, it's a problem. That those are things that I really enjoy. And I'mma be honest, &gt;&gt; you know, you know, before um before I got to this age, I used to play all these sports, &gt;&gt; right? But uh but now I I can't play. So So you know, some you just sit around and you watch other people if you I I had to get rid of I had to get rid of my TV because I know what I what it would do to me. &gt;&gt; And and then then not not only that, uh we brought the TVs back, but disconnect the cable. That TV can't do nothing without no cable connection to it. &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. &gt;&gt; So, I disconnected the cable in my house &gt;&gt; on my TV. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's it's it's to protect me. &gt;&gt; It's to protect me from me. &gt;&gt; N I'm I'mma go a little further. I'm going just tell tell the truth and shame the devil. I ain't got no cable connected, but now I got a telephone. &gt;&gt; And the devil just keep overriding everything you trying every every road block you put up. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The devil got something else. And on my phone, soon as football season come, they just start sending me uh messages. This game and this game and and this game and and and this happened to this person and what happened? What? What? And as soon as you click on one thing, they gonna keep sending you more and more and more. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; You ain't got no cable, but you got a Hulu account. &gt;&gt; And you got you got a a ESPN account. &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. &gt;&gt; Sunday Ticket account. You you you you don't go to the movies, but you got Hallelujah. a Netflix account. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got uh Disney. &gt;&gt; Oh, how the church know about Abram and his idols. [Music] &gt;&gt; It's time to do an inventory. &gt;&gt; God, how do I get myself wrapped up in all this type of stuff? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Why don't you uh fasted for 30 days? &gt;&gt; Cut off your account for 30 days. &gt;&gt; You know what they say after 21 days, &gt;&gt; something become a habit to you. &gt;&gt; You can break a habit if you just a 30-day fast. I don't want no none of this for 30 days. &gt;&gt; And do it in the middle of the season. I know I'm asking something hard, &gt;&gt; but I think what the Lord Jesus did when he went to the cross &gt;&gt; was a lot, &gt;&gt; a lot harder, &gt;&gt; but we got to do our own personal inventories. And I might not have called out something that you you deal with, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But come on, let the Holy Ghost deal with you and and and help you through these things. Amen. Maybe you might maybe you might might need to fast Amazon. &gt;&gt; Oh, that hurt somebody. Lord, that hurt them. &gt;&gt; Packages showing up at your house every day. &gt;&gt; You You know the delivery people by name. You shop too much. And hey, it's the same technology when you shop. Have you ever noticed that when you click on buy, &gt;&gt; you might be interested in &gt;&gt; and they they have a way of persuading you and suggesting to you and before you know it, you clicking over here and you clicking over there and yeah, you bought this skirt and this dress. Guess what? This so and so got the same dress and now you're on their site for hours &gt;&gt; trying to get home before your husband get home to get the packages. and get them all unpacked and throw out them boxes because you don't want him to see all this stuff that you done bought. Can I tell you something? Some of us shop more on Amazon than we did just going to a regular store. &gt;&gt; You would have never even went to a regular store and did that. Now, some sisters used to do that and they would hide that stuff in their trunk and and give it to their sister and keep this until I &gt;&gt; Okay, I think we in there. We're doing all kind of things. But now Amazon done made this thing so so easy and just one package after the next package and the next package. Maybe just fast for about 30 days cuz you know in 21 days you can break a habit. &gt;&gt; I got to come out. this um &gt;&gt; this um I was looking at this and and and this when you hit next about this this evergreen tree and I put this this AI summary in a Google search. These are notes. I want y'all to also just be careful because when you go to Google and search out stuff and they give you the AI summaries, it's not all the time are they right. &gt;&gt; AI is pulling information from whoever put it out there. &gt;&gt; And it just presents to you what what it thinks everybody else is expecting. So don't don't don't ne you have to continue to do your research. Right? So here it says uh evergreens often symbolize immortality and eternal life because they retain their leaves through throughout the winter. It also symbolizes eternal life and the promise of ultimate restoration in scriptures. Look at that. This is what AI said that uh and the reason I'm saying that the scripture says Ephraim shall say what have I to do anymore with idols? I have heard him and observed him. I am like a green fur tree which means an evergreen tree. From me is thy fruit found. And it's saying this now. Now this is what Ephraim, the tribe of Ephraim is saying in the book of Hosea. But notice what the AI church says. It also symbolized the evergreen tree. The fur tree, the green fur tree. Evergreen tree. It's a symbol of a promise of ultimate restoration. So when he says this, he's turning from his idols and he says he says, "I'm like a green fur tree. From me is thy fruit found." It's it's man, I don't change with the seasons. &gt;&gt; I'm resilient. &gt;&gt; And and especially when it comes to adversity, that's when you see my true colors. But but when he when he when he identifies himself in this manner, it also says that there's a promise of ultimate restoration &gt;&gt; because remember when we looked at uh Hosea 4, I believe it was and and just kind of he was he God got God to God away with Let me go back to this slide and I'm I'mma end right here. Let me give you the slide here, sis. I think it's going to be slide five. Yeah, slide five. Let me just read that and I'm I'mma I'm I'mma just cut off right here. We'll come back and pick it up. Um I thank God for uh our full band this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. But this got to be put up. So, um I'll I'll cut off and that way we have time to do all we need to do and sisters can see sister Tina, you know, after and then I'll come back and pick this up. Um not next week cuz brother Caleb will be with us next week, but I'll pick it up. Amen. A little bit. But this scripture here when it's I'm a green fur tree. I'm a green fur tree. But go just go back one please. He um said here in Hosea 4, I mean before we got to Hosea 14, he said, "Israel slideth back as a backsliding hea." Now the Lord will feed them as a lamb in a large place. Ephraim is joined to idols. Let him alone. But Ephraim, how'd you get there? What happened in your life that got you to a spot where God had to say, "Just leave him alone. &gt;&gt; Don't even work with them no more." That's bad. That's bad. That's crossing the line. But in in in all of that, still God say, "I'm going to restore backsliding Israel." And when he says that he going to restore them, um, he sees himself as a green fur tree still bearing fruit. Remember that definition I just gave you? It says it that evergreen tree also meant ultimate restoration. That's one to write down because we're coming back to that &gt;&gt; ultimate restoration. cuz we're going to see something in scripture where it seemed like they were lost, but then we're going to pick up something else in scripture because uh Jacob said, I mean uh um yeah, Jacob said, "Let let their name be named. Let my name be named on them." Well, we're going to find in scripture where his name was named on them. &gt;&gt; Oh, we got we got a little ways to go. Let's stop there. Let's pray. Musicians, y'all can come. Father, we are grateful for the word. Thank you for God, your truth. Thank you for a prophet that helps us to be able to to navigate the scriptures, helps us to end up in the right place with the things that we see. But it's not just about seeing, but it's about doing. And Lord, uh, this is just a journey that we we trust that the Holy Spirit would just continue to take us through and that you would you would speak to us, that you would um help us, Lord, just to shine the light on the inside of us that we could find those areas that we we need to we need to just get better in. The scripture tells us to to lay aside every sin and every weight that so easily possesses us. And Lord, there are things that in our life, they might not be sins, but they are weights. So help us, oh God, to to hear the voice of the Lord. And as as as Ephraim said, "What more have I to do with idols?" God, let us have that same question. What more have I to do with it? I want to be free from that. And I believe the word of God is here to bring liberty. So I pray Lord for every heart that and every ear that has heard the word. Trust oh God that you uh will get glory from the words that have been spoken. It's in Jesus name that we pray. Amen. Let's stand to our feet and Amen. sing a song of worship.

Father, as we leave this place, Lord, may you ever abide in us, Lord Jesus, that we may bring forth your truth to the people of the world that will receive it, Lord. You still have children, Lord, out there, Lord, worshiping idols, Lord God, worshiping false gods, Lord Jesus. They need to hear what we've heard, Lord Jesus. So use us, Lord God, to minister to your people, Lord, to fulfill the great commission, Lord, that you gave your saints, Lord, when you were ascending. We love you, Father. Keep your people.
