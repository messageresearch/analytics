[12:30] Lord God that we may have victory in the
[12:32] precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen
[12:36] amen amen so I'll get right away with
[12:39] the message um the title of the message
[12:41] that the Lord inspired me inspired to
[12:43] give me was uh is a continuation in this
[12:46] in this uh series that I was preaching
[12:47] last time so last time it was in the
[12:50] valley and now this is expectations in
[12:53] the battle so we're going to uh turn to
[12:56] 2 Chronicles 20 uh we're going to read
[13:00] verses 11- 15 um as our opening
[13:06] verse and just say Amen once you get
[13:13] there and it says behold I say how they
[13:17] reward us to come cast us out of thy
[13:19] possession which thou Hast given us to
[13:22] inherit Oh Our God will thou not judge
[13:25] them for we have no might against this
[13:27] great company that cometh against us
[13:29] neither know what we to do but our eyes
[13:31] are upon thee and all Judah stood before
[13:34] the Lord with their little ones their
[13:36] wives and their children then upon jezel
[13:39] is the the son of Zachariah the son of
[13:41] Bah the son of Jael the son of matiah a
[13:46] levite of the sons of Assaf came the
[13:49] spirit of the Lord in the midst of the
[13:51] congregation and he said hearken ye all
[13:53] Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem
[13:55] and Thou King Jehosaphat thus sa the
[13:58] Lord unto you be Not Afraid nor dismayed
[14:00] by reason of this great multitude for
[14:03] the battle is not yours but God's the
[14:06] battle is not yours and it's such a
[14:08] beautiful uh type of what's kind of
[14:11] happening going on in Israel right now
[14:14] uh um with the battle that they're
[14:16] expecting because uh what the what the
[14:19] natural eye doesn't see is they're just
[14:22] possessing what's already theirs right
[14:24] and they don't understand that God has
[14:26] already given them that inheritance and
[14:28] they're just fulfilling their god-given
[14:30] rights so it's not them fighting but
[14:33] it's God fighting for them right it's
[14:35] God fighting for them so we're going to
[14:37] go through some quotes uh from the
[14:39] prophet to kind of um uh as we're going
[14:42] in the battles from day-to-day life to
[14:44] kind of see what this Christian life is
[14:45] all about so the first quote is going to
[14:47] be the angel of the Covenant oh you may
[14:49] be see it as well yes the first quote is
[14:52] the Angel of the
[14:54] Covenant uh
[14:57] 54310 paragraph 3
[15:00] 4 and it reads here starting from the
[15:02] 34th
[15:03] paragraph now let's break that down for
[15:06] a moment now the land belonged to him
[15:09] now God didn't say I'm going to go in
[15:10] there and empty up the land and put you
[15:12] in it he said I've give it to you now
[15:14] you go fight it out with them there you
[15:16] are God's give you healing tonight lady
[15:19] you every one of you he's give you the
[15:21] healing it's your possession so what the
[15:24] prophet is saying is this is something
[15:25] you've already possessed it's not a
[15:28] question of you whether you have it or
[15:29] not it's in your possession right he
[15:32] says it's all bound down with amorites
[15:34] and Canaanites and everything else of
[15:35] unbelief but go in take it over it's
[15:38] yours it belongs to you that's right I
[15:41] must fight if I should rign increase my
[15:43] courage Lord this is not a picnic ground
[15:45] this is a battlefield SE not a place
[15:48] where we lay back and say now Lord you
[15:49] just come force it right in me then I'll
[15:51] do it no no you don't do it that way God
[15:54] never did it that way he has a basis
[15:58] amen and we're going to read another
[15:59] quote from the message of deceived
[16:01] Church by the word 590 628 paragraph
[16:07] 8 and I'll go ahead and read it and it
[16:09] reads remember we are not on a picnic
[16:12] but we're in a battlefield right many
[16:14] people just think that when they become
[16:15] a Christian that that's all they need to
[16:18] do that settles it forever as they are a
[16:21] Christian and everything is going to
[16:22] come easy don't never get that in your
[16:25] head for I become a Christian to fight
[16:28] fight the good fight of faith I become a
[16:30] Christian to get in the battle lines we
[16:32] are Christian Soldiers and we got to be
[16:33] trained and brought up and know all the
[16:35] the techniques of the enemy to know how
[16:37] to fortify to know how to fight the
[16:38] fight and we can only do that as the
[16:40] holy spirit will reveal it to us we
[16:43] cannot take what some other Nation tells
[16:45] us when we go to war some other ideas
[16:47] but we got to take our own ideas the way
[16:49] the Holy Spirit would direct us and what
[16:51] ideas he would give us because he is the
[16:53] commander-in-chief of the army of
[16:55] Christians amen we're constantly in a
[16:58] battle yes right and we're going to go
[17:00] to uh the message Revelation 5 uh number
[17:03] two paragraph
[17:05] 37
[17:07] Lord right we want to really sink this
[17:09] thing down uh uh uh of this war that
[17:12] we're in amen and it reads now Satan
[17:14] will constantly punch at you until
[17:17] you're finished here on Earth true just
[17:20] remember that you'll never have a time
[17:22] but what there's a punching going on all
[17:25] the time because you're in a battle did
[17:27] you come to Christ did you come did you
[17:29] ask to come to Christ to go into a
[17:31] picnic where you're sure going to be
[17:33] surprised because it's a constant battle
[17:37] I've been on the field for 31 years and
[17:39] I fought every inch of the way that's
[17:41] right Israel had to fight every inch of
[17:43] the way they Palestine was given to them
[17:46] but they had to fight every inch of the
[17:48] way to get it am amen every inch of the
[17:50] way to get it and we're going to Le
[17:52] we're going to go to this last uh quote
[17:54] and the trumpet gives us uncertain sound
[17:56] it's paragraphs 107 through 108 this be
[17:59] our last
[18:00] quote and it reads now army war it's
[18:03] always been War we never join the church
[18:05] or come to the church to come to a
[18:07] picnic we must realize we are coming to
[18:09] a Battleground I never come for people
[18:11] to Pat me on the back and say brother
[18:13] brandom you're a wonderful person no sir
[18:15] I come there with a shield I don't need
[18:17] a shield for that I come with a helmet
[18:19] and the armor I come to fight fight
[18:21] every inch of the ground God told Joshua
[18:25] every place The Souls of your foot
[18:27] Treads upon
[18:28] that I give you so footsteps mean
[18:31] possession and God has not changed his
[18:34] mind about us and what our footsteps go
[18:37] every footstep we take is possession
[18:41] right and if it's a possession that
[18:43] means it already belong to us so get we
[18:46] have to get the thoughts out of our head
[18:48] that we're trying to get something no we
[18:50] already have possession of it right we
[18:53] just want the Holy Spirit to come and
[18:55] realize that possession for us so as the
[18:57] prophet was saying in these quotes we
[18:59] are constantly in a battle and that's
[19:02] the first thing we have to do every
[19:04] morning that we wake up is to realize
[19:06] that it's a fight going on and when when
[19:08] you're in the world you see all the
[19:10] movies and the TV shows and the reality
[19:12] shows and you see even people in the
[19:13] world they just live it seems they live
[19:15] a good life where you know they wake up
[19:17] and the sun shining and drinking coffee
[19:20] and just going on about their day and
[19:22] everything seems good and fine and I
[19:25] feel that the American culture and I
[19:28] used to argue with some of my African
[19:29] friends when I was younger cuz they used
[19:31] to talk so much bad about America and
[19:33] being American you know it's it kind of
[19:36] offended me because I was an American
[19:38] until I begin to realize that you know
[19:40] they're right about that because the Le
[19:43] the L this last age America is a very
[19:46] very big representative of that because
[19:49] the PE it says that the people are rich
[19:51] right and but but yet they're blind
[19:54] naked and don't know it and when I begin
[19:56] to think about it in America America has
[19:58] the highest GDP where we have an
[20:01] abundance of resources we have an
[20:03] abundance of entertainment and so it's
[20:05] made us comfortable to think we're not
[20:08] in a war right right and so I I I in in
[20:11] uh in history class I know I read about
[20:13] the Vietnam War and the soldiers there
[20:15] wouldn't even go to sleep sometimes
[20:18] because they realized they could die in
[20:19] their sleep so they stayed up all night
[20:22] every day because they were in a fight
[20:24] could you imagine them uh uh streaming
[20:27] Netflix
[20:28] or you know uh on social media all day
[20:32] right realizing that if they didn't keep
[20:34] guard their life would be gone and so I
[20:37] feel that American people we've kind of
[20:39] the enemy can kind of creep in and make
[20:42] us comfortable right make us comfortable
[20:44] to unarm us it's not that we don't have
[20:46] the weapons it's just he wants to unarm
[20:49] us and the weapon being the word so I
[20:52] went to this concert um I believe it was
[20:55] Sunday and this guy was talking about
[20:58] about this one girl this little girl
[20:59] there where these people were writing
[21:01] letters to the um these little uh kids
[21:04] uh and it was Christian people writing
[21:05] letters to these kids and these are
[21:06] these are people that don't have the
[21:08] Comforts and enjoyments of the world
[21:10] that we do they don't have beds they
[21:12] don't have you know they can't choose
[21:14] between a water bed and a a um uh
[21:17] Orthopedic nice bed or or they don't
[21:20] have a carpet they can't choose between
[21:21] these things they eat a piece of bread
[21:23] of day they don't have the comfort so
[21:25] when this guy said he saw this little
[21:27] girl when she was holding on to this
[21:29] letter because someone had written her
[21:31] some words of encouragement right it
[21:33] meant so much to her right because she
[21:36] didn't have these other things to
[21:38] distract her from those words and I feel
[21:41] as Christians that sometimes we can
[21:43] allow the Comforts of the word to
[21:44] distract us and our confidence in God's
[21:47] word right because the ultimate love
[21:49] letter that we have is the Bible you
[21:52] will not get any Victory outside of the
[21:55] word it doesn't matter how you feel I
[21:57] don't care how you think about about it
[21:58] I don't care how much you say you love
[22:00] God but there is no Victory outside of
[22:02] the word right so our first expectation
[22:06] uh especially as Americans uh is that
[22:09] outside of our dreams and plans because
[22:11] a lot of us you know we have some people
[22:13] have dreams they want to be doctors they
[22:14] want to be business people they want to
[22:16] raise a family they want to do all these
[22:18] things and it's all well and fine but
[22:19] our first expectation is that we are in
[22:22] a war right in the back of your mind and
[22:25] deep inside your heart you have to
[22:26] remember that you're in a fight and
[22:28] you're not just here to enjoy the things
[22:30] of the world when Adam and Eve sinned in
[22:33] the beginning in the garden they
[22:35] forfeited our right to have a picnic on
[22:37] Earth God told them because you've done
[22:40] this thing now you have to fight now you
[22:43] have to fight so we can't we can't put
[22:45] ourselves in the Millennium uh uh when
[22:48] we're currently fighting right now so we
[22:50] have to be diligent we have to be
[22:51] diligent we have to we have to uh wake
[22:53] up and uh uh seek the Holy Spirit early
[22:55] in the morning to ask him where is the
[22:57] battle at where is the battle today
[23:00] right and I I remember there's this one
[23:02] Bible verse when I was young and when I
[23:05] was a young Christian I read and I
[23:06] didn't really understand it but it said
[23:08] Jesus said take no thought of tomorrow
[23:10] for tomorrow will think of itself he
[23:13] said sufficient is the evil in the day
[23:15] that you have thereof and I and I didn't
[23:18] know what that meant but as you begin to
[23:19] grow in Christ he'll begin to open these
[23:21] things up to you and what that was is
[23:24] the battles that you're facing today
[23:25] that's what you need to focus on a lot
[23:27] of times we allow the past all right the
[23:30] past mistakes and stuff to distract us
[23:32] or we allow the future to try to
[23:34] distract us but there are battles that
[23:36] are going on currently in our life that
[23:37] we have to overcome and we're not going
[23:40] to do only way we'll overcome is by the
[23:42] revelation of the Holy Spirit and that's
[23:44] what the the prophet was telling us that
[23:45] the Holy Spirit has to give us the
[23:47] Revelation that one you're in a fight
[23:50] and then give you the revelation of what
[23:51] you need to do to overcome it so I
[23:53] thought that was a very very good Bible
[23:55] verse because it proves that every day
[23:57] we're fighting and we're looking to God
[23:59] to give us the word to overcome what
[24:02] those battles are for today right in
[24:05] this day and another expectation that we
[24:07] have to realize in this fight is that
[24:10] God always trains you before the battle
[24:12] fights God never sends a soldier into a
[24:15] fight unprepared right never never send
[24:18] you into a fight unprepared and I know
[24:20] that some of us have been in a situation
[24:21] where we've gotten new jobs and the
[24:23] onboarding process was horrible you know
[24:26] you're asking people to help you with
[24:28] this and that and they just say hey just
[24:29] read that just watch this video and then
[24:32] all of a sudden you just you just feel
[24:33] so overwhelmed right because we it's
[24:35] it's the mentality of a you know
[24:37] everybody for himself and so when the
[24:39] pressures of the job then become then
[24:43] then start to squeeze you you're always
[24:45] asking people for help right you feel
[24:47] frustrated you want to leave the job
[24:49] because you're not prepared to fight it
[24:51] uh and I know at my job I remember so we
[24:54] hired this one lady and um and she and I
[24:58] went up to her and she was just
[24:59] frustrated man she just seemed like she
[25:00] was just frustrated and stuff so I was
[25:02] telling some other the people and other
[25:03] the leaders of my job I'm like hey can
[25:05] someone go and Shadow her can someone go
[25:07] and like you know and what shadowing is
[25:10] shadowing is that you do the work first
[25:12] and let them watch you and then you step
[25:15] take a step back and then you let them
[25:17] do the work and as they're going through
[25:18] the pressures and stuff you're seeing
[25:20] how they react and you're you give them
[25:22] a word to say hey do this hey in that
[25:24] situation don't do that and then when
[25:26] they feel confident that's when you
[25:28] leave and then the and then now the
[25:30] person feels like I'm prepared right and
[25:33] if anything gets too drastic I can still
[25:35] call on someone from help right and so
[25:37] that's why I love that God doesn't think
[25:40] like man right God doesn't think like
[25:42] man like that no when God when God sees
[25:45] that a battle is coming up no he's
[25:47] giving you the best weapon that he could
[25:49] the army with which is his word right
[25:51] and it's his word and he'll prepare you
[25:53] before he sees cuz cuz the battles are
[25:56] are big and are small all and we don't
[25:58] know when they're going to come but God
[26:00] does know and when he sees the big
[26:02] battles coming down the road he starts
[26:04] to prepare you right he starts to
[26:05] prepare you right so that you can have
[26:08] Victory into that because the thing
[26:09] about it is when God sends you somewhere
[26:12] his name is attached to you that can't
[26:16] fail right it cannot fail uh a lot of
[26:19] times when we go into situations in our
[26:21] own uh uh our own thinking and our own
[26:24] will and then stuff just gets all messed
[26:26] up and and God so God can't attach
[26:29] himself to our thoughts right because
[26:31] then it would fail and it give the enemy
[26:33] a reason to mock God right so uh um
[26:38] David is a great example of this um I
[26:40] love reading about David um so you see
[26:43] Samuel Samuel had anointed David and uh
[26:47] anointed him the King right and so I can
[26:49] imagine David was happy he was out in
[26:51] the field watching the watching the
[26:52] Sheep sitting behind a tree sitting on a
[26:54] tree or something like that but he was
[26:56] just so happy that he was chosen
[26:58] uh not because of uh how good he was or
[27:00] how smart he was but because God just
[27:02] loved him right God just loved him then
[27:05] I can imagine you know a bear just came
[27:07] out of nowhere and took one of the sheep
[27:09] and David Rose up and started to go
[27:11] toward this bear and you know how it is
[27:14] when you're first doing something it's a
[27:16] nervousness right it's a nervousness so
[27:18] I can imagine you know David maybe
[27:20] running toward this bear and his knees
[27:21] were shaken but then I can see the Holy
[27:24] Spirit kind of overshadow David and say
[27:26] hey David Remember When when you was
[27:28] slinging that using that slingshot in
[27:30] your backyard and hitting that tree I
[27:31] want you to do the exact same thing and
[27:33] throw it at the bear all right right and
[27:35] so then David took that sling threw it
[27:38] at the bear hit the bear the bear
[27:40] dropped right bear was a a thlb bear 10
[27:43] foot pound bear and it just dropped
[27:45] before him right and and and the the
[27:49] prophet said that that was such a
[27:51] supernatural event to David because
[27:54] David was a ruddy guy he was small and
[27:57] he knew that it would have been
[27:59] impossible for himself to take on a bear
[28:01] like that so I believe that moment gave
[28:04] David confidence in God's word yes sir
[28:07] right in God's word this is before
[28:10] Goliath came on the scene right and so
[28:12] then I can see maybe you know now the
[28:14] lion came out of nowhere right and the
[28:16] lion just took a sheep right and he had
[28:19] the same he used the same exact faith
[28:21] that he used to take the bear and he
[28:22] took that slingshot threw it at The Lion
[28:25] and the Bible says that the lion drop
[28:27] the sheep and drop down but it Rose back
[28:29] up but when the lion Rose back up that
[28:32] didn't Shake David cuz a lot of times
[28:34] when we go through our trials and we're
[28:35] overcoming something we're overcoming
[28:37] something then something else comes that
[28:39] is not the same and then sometimes you
[28:41] can get all out of control just like if
[28:43] you're on the job and a situation comes
[28:45] up that you that you're not sure about
[28:47] so when this lion rose up David still
[28:50] have faith right cuz he had seen a
[28:52] supernatural event and the Bible says
[28:54] that he took the lion by the beard and a
[28:56] knife and slew him him right so he
[28:58] realized that he was no longer ordinary
[29:01] but that the god that anointed him even
[29:03] though he wasn't on paper he wasn't
[29:06] strong enough to fight against these
[29:07] things but this but this Supernatural
[29:09] vent that God had uh uh uh uh given
[29:12] David gave him confidence in the word
[29:15] and it gave him so much confidence that
[29:17] when he was going to fight Goliath he
[29:20] didn't know he was going to fight
[29:22] Goliath right it was it was an
[29:24] unexpected battle right and I'm telling
[29:26] you right now that there's going to be a
[29:28] lot of those coming in your life Goliath
[29:30] is not going to tell you he's coming
[29:33] he's just going to show up and so you're
[29:35] going to need to be prepared to be able
[29:37] to fight it or else you're going to run
[29:39] away but David was just walking just to
[29:42] give uh some of his I think some of his
[29:44] brothers lunch and he saw Goliath
[29:46] boasting in against the children of
[29:49] Israel and the Bible says that he said
[29:51] I'll go and fight him and everyone was
[29:53] looking at him like he was crazy cuz it
[29:55] was just little kid maybe uh the same
[29:57] size
[29:57] as Joseph they thought well what how
[30:00] what gives you confidence that you can
[30:01] do it he said well uh there was a bear
[30:05] there was a lion and I slew it right I
[30:08] threw I had a slingshock i slew it and
[30:10] it fell and this battle will be the
[30:12] exact same no matter how much Goliath
[30:15] was taller and bigger than these things
[30:17] he had faced but because God had
[30:19] prepared him right God had prepared him
[30:21] it gave him confidence that he would be
[30:23] able to take out Goliath what was God
[30:26] doing during that time he was preparing
[30:28] David for the great battle so you see
[30:31] the uh um it was the victories that that
[30:34] David had before that gave him
[30:37] confidence for this big victory and I'm
[30:39] telling you right now that it's it's the
[30:41] little victories that you have every
[30:43] single day that prepare you for the big
[30:45] stuff that's why a lot of times when
[30:47] people come across great trials and
[30:50] they're cowering and their F and and and
[30:53] they're afraid and they're praying and
[30:54] they're crying out it's because they
[30:56] didn't recognize what God was doing to
[30:58] try to prepare them for it right what
[31:01] God was trying to prepare them for it so
[31:02] it's just the small victories that you
[31:04] face every single day right uh uh that
[31:07] help you to uh overcome bigger ones
[31:09] because healing is easy victories are
[31:12] easy when when David saw Goliath it was
[31:14] a easy fight for him no matter how big
[31:17] he was it was such an easy fight for him
[31:20] right it was and he never fought someone
[31:22] that big before but he was confident in
[31:24] the word that he had so it's it's we
[31:28] have to we have to look at ourselves and
[31:30] our lives and our in our life and how
[31:32] can we expect God to give us the faith
[31:36] right to to heal a great disease or
[31:38] great situations uh when we can't even
[31:41] apologize to our brother that we've done
[31:42] wrong all right right you know small
[31:45] things like that or you know you uh uh
[31:48] um or you can't have patience with
[31:50] people on the job right and you're
[31:52] making let's say $20 an hour and you
[31:54] want God to give you $50 an hour and you
[31:56] can't even have patience at 20 or $15 an
[31:58] hour and you want God to give you a big
[32:01] increase which is just a bigger battle
[32:04] right so it's what you overcome what
[32:07] with what you have before you that helps
[32:09] you to prepare for that battle uh uh in
[32:12] the future so you know and everybody
[32:14] wants to move everybody wants to stop
[32:16] the sun when we read the Bible everybody
[32:18] wants to stop the sun everybody wants to
[32:20] walk on water everybody wants to cast
[32:22] out demons and all these things and I
[32:24] was thinking and there was a situation
[32:26] at my house uh when I was when I was
[32:28] with my dad I came home and he had
[32:30] accidentally opened up my mail and I
[32:32] just got all upset I was like why you
[32:35] open up my mail this is my stuff and I
[32:36] got all upset with him and I went back
[32:38] to my room and I sat down and the Holy
[32:40] Spirit came and said you know you
[32:42] shouldn't have talked to your dad like
[32:43] that and I said Lord you know in my
[32:45] heart I didn't mean to say that you know
[32:47] I did not mean to say that he said I
[32:49] understand that but you need to go up
[32:50] and
[32:51] apologize and there was a battle because
[32:54] Pride was in the way because I didn't
[32:56] want to get up and go and say that even
[32:58] though I knew I was wrong and I was
[32:59] sorry about it so there was a little
[33:01] battle there right we want to move
[33:03] mountains and stuff like that but can't
[33:05] even move our pride out the way right
[33:09] and so I had to I had I had to hunker
[33:11] down and the Holy Spirit still dealing
[33:12] with me and I had to get up out my chair
[33:14] that was a great Victory then I had to
[33:16] take steps and I started walking to my
[33:18] dad's room and I went to my dad I said
[33:20] Dad I'm sorry for saying that to you
[33:22] please forgive me what a great Victory
[33:25] because I can take that to a great
[33:27] situation now and I can look back into
[33:29] and say hold on a second if I Deni
[33:31] myself then I don't care what the doctor
[33:34] says because the doctor's going to come
[33:36] with you with specifics he'll say that
[33:38] your blood level is this you see your
[33:40] white blood cell count is small your
[33:42] losing strength there's no hope for you
[33:45] and if you don't know how to deny
[33:47] yourself you're going to believe it so
[33:49] it's those small victories that you get
[33:51] every single day that help you to fight
[33:54] the goliaths when they come right am
[33:57] amen so we're going to also so now let's
[33:58] go to the uh let's go to the New
[34:00] Testament now uh just to see some more
[34:03] examples of God preparing you for the
[34:05] fight uh and we're going to look we're
[34:06] going to take a look at our Lord and
[34:08] Savior Jesus Christ uh now Jesus had a
[34:10] friend in Lazarus right and Lazarus got
[34:13] sick one time and the family went to uh
[34:16] Jesus for assistance because they knew
[34:17] he could turn the situation around but
[34:20] God had something else for Jesus to do
[34:24] right and so when Martha went and told
[34:26] him all these things God had Jesus do
[34:28] something else right so another
[34:30] expectation you have to realize in the
[34:32] Battle Is God don't give you all the
[34:33] details for Stuff God doesn't give you
[34:36] all the details so you got to trust uh
[34:40] uh in his word and in his timing and
[34:42] when he says things right cuz Jesus told
[34:45] them that Lazarus doesn't have a
[34:47] sickness unto death right he didn't have
[34:49] a sickness unto death and then but uh um
[34:52] but as we as we read later on in the
[34:54] Bible verse Lazarus did end up dying so
[34:58] could you imagine the battle Martha was
[35:00] in at night time knowing that Jesus said
[35:03] oh no he's not going to die and then he
[35:05] died right that's when the enemy loves
[35:07] to come in your ear and say hold on a
[35:09] second Martha you know Jesus can heal
[35:12] you've seen him healed millions of times
[35:14] before can you imagine the battle in her
[35:16] head where she's wondering why why' you
[35:19] let him die Jesus right and all a sudden
[35:21] now she's in she she's in a great battle
[35:24] right and and and and maybe Jesus uh uh
[35:28] maybe Jesus so so the thing about it is
[35:30] Jesus before all this happened Jesus was
[35:32] in the will of God and doing the perfect
[35:34] will of God and God had maybe he was uh
[35:37] after a healing service or something he
[35:38] was out and about and God gave him a
[35:40] vision and that Vision was him standing
[35:43] before a grave crying out to Lazarus to
[35:45] come out so God already knew something
[35:48] was going to happen but God had given
[35:50] him the assurance and the victory that
[35:53] uh uh Lazarus would live but he didn't
[35:55] say all those things
[35:57] right and so sometimes God won't tell
[35:58] you all these things you just got to
[36:00] trust in what word he gives you right he
[36:03] knows exactly what's going on and that
[36:05] can be hard and it's it's and it's a
[36:07] trying time for our faith right it's a
[36:10] trying time for our faith right uh and
[36:12] so we have to uh um and so we're going
[36:15] to turn to uh uh turn our Bibles and you
[36:18] don't have to turn to I just go to the
[36:19] Bible verses just to uh kind of go
[36:22] through the situation we're going to go
[36:23] to
[36:24] John John 11
[36:27] just to kind of
[36:29] show John
[36:32] 11:20 and this is when this is when uh
[36:35] Martha was um Jesus was coming back he
[36:37] already had the vision that Lazarus was
[36:39] going to live and this was Martha coming
[36:43] and this is look at Martha's attitude
[36:45] after she had gone through those battles
[36:47] at night time where she uh uh was
[36:50] battling with hold on a second Jesus you
[36:52] could have heal you could have healed my
[36:54] dad the Bible says in John 11:20 then
[36:56] Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus
[36:58] was coming went and met him and I like
[37:01] that because she didn't run away from
[37:02] him right she didn't run away from him
[37:05] she still went to the word no matter how
[37:08] she was feeling no matter how she was
[37:09] upset she didn't understand what was
[37:11] going on but still ran to the word right
[37:15] but Mary sat still in the house then
[37:17] said Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou had
[37:19] been there my brother had not died but I
[37:22] know now but I know that even now
[37:24] whatsoever thou will ask God God will
[37:27] give it to thee now can you imagine like
[37:30] give me that kind of faith that uh even
[37:32] when a situation and you just don't you
[37:35] don't have all the answers and and
[37:37] that's another expectation in the battle
[37:39] like I said before you won't have all
[37:41] the answers and that in itself is a
[37:43] battle that in itself is a battle where
[37:45] you're looking to find a reason of
[37:46] what's going on and regardless of all
[37:49] that you still have to trust in God
[37:51] right you still have to trust in God so
[37:54] when we come down here to verse uh
[37:57] 33
[37:58] um it reads here when Jesus therefore
[38:02] saw her weeping and the Jews also
[38:05] weeping which came with her he groaned
[38:07] in the spirit and was troubled and said
[38:10] where have ye laid him they said they
[38:13] said unto the Lord come and see in verse
[38:16] 35 it says Jesus wept now this is a this
[38:19] is an interesting thing cuz um this is
[38:21] actually a short bible verse and we had
[38:23] from the youth I didn't know they
[38:24] answered that a question they said what
[38:25] is the shortest Bible verse
[38:27] now I knew right praise God but here it
[38:31] says that it says here that Jesus it
[38:33] says here that Jesus wept uh and if you
[38:36] read the message uh people tried to
[38:39] challenge the prophet and a lot of
[38:41] people still believe today in religion
[38:43] that Jesus was just a man and they use
[38:46] this Bible verse as a a proof to show
[38:50] how can God cry uhuh right how can God
[38:53] and it looks it looks very very conf
[38:56] convincing because he had the victory
[38:59] uhuh he knew Lazarus had the victory
[39:02] yeah so why is he still
[39:03] crying why is he still crying right uh
[39:07] um and but I love it and that's why you
[39:10] need the prophet you need the Holy
[39:11] Spirit to open the word to you I love
[39:13] that he wept the Bible says that he was
[39:16] tempted so he could help those that are
[39:19] tempted right he went through things
[39:21] that we did as a man so he could
[39:23] understand how we felt about things
[39:26] right how we felt about things he didn't
[39:28] just come on Earth and a lot of people
[39:30] thought he would come on Earth as like a
[39:32] king and just conquer everything and you
[39:34] know coming uh purple and gold and just
[39:36] Untouchable but he came just as us he
[39:39] was tempted like he was tempted as us uh
[39:42] uh he wept like us to understand what
[39:44] are these people going through so that I
[39:46] can give them a victory
[39:48] right and and and uh um and we have uh
[39:52] uh and we have the and and we have to
[39:54] realize that for our situations we also
[39:58] have the word we all it may have not
[40:00] been a vision but we also have the word
[40:02] to help us overcome in our situations
[40:05] right God has already given us a vision
[40:07] that we're coming out of our situations
[40:09] as our precious brother Jerry preached
[40:11] last week it was before the foundation
[40:13] of the world we already had the uh uh uh
[40:15] the Victory and stuff but sometimes the
[40:17] emotions can just overtake you right
[40:20] emotions just overtake you even though
[40:21] you got the word you know we get sad we
[40:23] get upset you know we question God why
[40:26] is it is happening to me right so it's
[40:28] and and and and and it's tough because
[40:30] you're just going through your life
[40:31] plans you may you know you may want to
[40:34] uh um you may some of the sisters you
[40:36] know you talk to some of the sisters and
[40:37] they want to start a family right it's
[40:39] in their heart for them to start a
[40:41] family God gave them the possession to
[40:43] be a mother and to have kids and then
[40:45] you go to the doctor and the doctor says
[40:46] well you'll never have kids right now
[40:49] they know the Bible verses where God has
[40:51] delivered people before they've all
[40:53] heard it before but this but because
[40:55] they're going through it the elves it's
[40:57] tough for them to see the
[40:59] word it's tough for them to see the word
[41:02] so that's why I appreciate how Jesus
[41:04] could cry could come to Lazarus grave
[41:07] and begin to cry and begin to uh and
[41:08] begin to weep even though he knew the
[41:11] victory was assured but sometimes when
[41:13] you're in the flesh it just overtakes
[41:15] you sometimes so I'm glad that God can
[41:18] himself be tempted and be and go through
[41:21] situations like that and still see the
[41:23] word through that right and and because
[41:27] we uh um because we all we all deal with
[41:30] those frustrations you know when a
[41:32] doctor gives you the report and says
[41:33] that you're not going to get better
[41:34] you're not going to get well it drops
[41:36] your heart right or when uh when you
[41:38] hear about someone uh uh a wayward kid
[41:41] the kid says you know I don't want to
[41:42] serve God no more right it just causes
[41:44] your heart to drop there's not enough
[41:46] word that can prevent that that feeling
[41:48] from coming even though you know you got
[41:50] the Bible verse that says th in the
[41:52] household shall be saved but nothing
[41:54] prevents those emotions from over
[41:56] overing you right so another expectation
[41:59] is in the battle is that no matter what
[42:01] you're going through the frustrations uh
[42:03] uh the sadness and and the tears and and
[42:07] and the questioning and stuff always
[42:09] speak the word after and that's what the
[42:12] prophet has said about Jesus when he
[42:14] said yeah he sure did wept he wept when
[42:16] he was a man but after that when he told
[42:19] Lazarus to rise about the grave it was
[42:21] God and so in our situations we have to
[42:24] recognize that we can still speak the
[42:27] word afterwards there was a man in the
[42:29] Bible who was uh he wanted to get healed
[42:33] right and he had leprosy or some some
[42:35] sickness on his skin or something like
[42:36] that and they were telling him to do
[42:39] this and do that and he was just
[42:40] frustrated he didn't want to do none of
[42:42] that they told him hey you need to go
[42:44] into this uh uh this um these these
[42:46] Waters over here he said these waters
[42:48] are dirty right and he was just
[42:49] frustrated all the time but the
[42:51] beautiful thing about that is he still
[42:53] believed the word after all those
[42:55] frustration
[42:57] he still belied the word after all those
[42:59] frustrations and God came through for
[43:01] him right so I'm and and and I like that
[43:05] typing and I like that um uh uh the
[43:07] typing for even for Christ himself to
[43:10] see Lazarus come out to see Lazarus die
[43:13] and then come out the grave so that one
[43:16] day when he would be on the cross right
[43:18] and he would be approaching death he
[43:20] could look back to what God had already
[43:22] did for Lazarus and have the confidence
[43:25] to come back out of the Grave right so
[43:27] that's the expectation is God always
[43:30] prepares you for a battle that's coming
[43:32] up right and so now we're going to turn
[43:35] to uh exodius Exodus I mean Exodus
[43:39] 3 uh we're going to read uh chapter
[43:44] 11 we're going to read chapter uh no
[43:48] chapter 3 verse
[43:50] 11 we're going to look at Moses someone
[43:52] else that God uh God had to prepare
[43:57] before A great battle was come right and
[44:01] we're going to yep so like so it says
[44:04] here and Moses said unto God who am I
[44:08] that I should go unto pharaoh and that I
[44:10] should bring forth the CH children of
[44:12] Israel out of Egypt and he said
[44:15] certainly I will be with thee and this
[44:17] shall be a token unto thee that I have
[44:19] sent thee when thou Hast brought forth
[44:22] the people out of Egypt ye shall serve
[44:24] me you shall ye shall serve God upon
[44:26] this mountain and another expectation
[44:28] have when you're in battle is it's
[44:30] already won amen it's already one when
[44:35] God told Moses that he said when you
[44:37] guys come out of here this is the
[44:39] mountain y'all going to serve me on the
[44:40] one that you standing on right now
[44:41] you're going to come right back here on
[44:44] this mountain right which was their
[44:46] possession right the battle had already
[44:48] been won when God has said that first
[44:51] word right and we're going to turn to
[44:53] chapter uh go to chapter chap 4 now to
[44:57] see another expectation right and we're
[45:00] going to go to verses uh 6-8 we're going
[45:02] to read verses 6 through 8 because a lot
[45:06] of times you know when God told Moses
[45:10] that it should have been
[45:12] enough right but you got to remember
[45:14] that we're in the flesh now right we're
[45:16] in the flesh and we struggle with these
[45:18] things you know so God has to build our
[45:21] confidence God has to show us uh uh uh
[45:25] in little victory that he is able to do
[45:27] what he said he would do because
[45:29] sometimes we we we just need that we
[45:31] need that uh uh uh experience to trust
[45:33] God for bigger things so verse four says
[45:36] and the Lord said unto Moses put forth
[45:39] thine hand and take uh um put forth
[45:42] thine hand and take it by the oh wait no
[45:45] it's
[45:47] uh yeah six yeah yeah verse six yeah
[45:49] yeah verse six it says and the Lord said
[45:51] furthermore unto him put now thy hand
[45:53] into thy bosom and he put his hand into
[45:56] his bosom and when he took it out behold
[45:58] his hand was lepos as snow so leprosy
[46:02] was a disease during that time that was
[46:04] like the cancer for our day right it was
[46:06] something that was uh uh people when
[46:08] they saw that you were lepos they kicked
[46:09] you out they didn't want nothing to do
[46:11] with you because they didn't want that
[46:12] spreading right this it was such a big
[46:14] deal in their day and here was God and
[46:16] if we could put our spiritual binoculars
[46:18] on in this single verse right here in
[46:21] the spiritual realm God was allowing
[46:23] that demon to come on to Moses
[46:26] right God allowed this demon to come on
[46:28] to Moses and then when he told him to
[46:29] take his hand his uh uh his hand out of
[46:31] his bosom he said the demon all right
[46:33] now you got to go he was trying to show
[46:36] Moses who was in charge right he was
[46:39] trying to show Moses who was in charge
[46:41] right right eight and it shall come to
[46:44] pass reading verse eight and it shall
[46:45] come to pass if they believe if they
[46:47] will not believe thee neither hearken to
[46:49] the the voice of the first sign that
[46:52] they will believe the voice of the
[46:53] latter sign and this is why other
[46:56] expectation comes into play right
[46:59] um You got to expect to get hit you got
[47:03] to expect that Satan's going to hit you
[47:06] Satan is not like a little um you know a
[47:09] a little nerdy kid and uh one of those
[47:11] nerdy kids in high school where bullies
[47:13] just pick on him and just do whatever
[47:14] they want to say no the Bible says he is
[47:16] a worthy adversary which means that you
[47:19] got to take him serious you got to take
[47:22] him serious right and the prophet said
[47:25] uh uh um the prophet preaching the
[47:27] message he says sometimes when God gives
[47:29] you the victory he says that you're
[47:30] healed from your sickness he says
[47:32] sometimes you get
[47:34] sicker when God gives you the victory
[47:36] over a situation that you have sometimes
[47:38] it gets
[47:40] worse right Prophet says sometimes it
[47:42] gets worse and when Moses went to the
[47:44] children of Israel uh uh and tried to
[47:47] and perform the signs and stuff like
[47:49] that there was one time where the uh
[47:51] Pharaoh caused them to do more work he
[47:54] took away the task Masters and he caused
[47:56] them to do more work than what they
[47:58] needed but God still had the victory in
[48:01] their eyes and they could not see that
[48:04] so that's why it's important to keep
[48:05] your focus always on the word uhhuh amen
[48:09] right always on the word right um so it
[48:13] was it's it's a um and and another
[48:17] another expectation uh uh in this fight
[48:19] is God does not need much in order for
[48:23] you to
[48:24] win and that's a big one and that's a
[48:27] big one because a lot of times we think
[48:29] we need so much and that's why God hates
[48:33] denominations right when you look at the
[48:35] denominational Spectrum on one end you
[48:37] have Catholics and Catholics you know
[48:40] they're not even allowed to read their
[48:41] Bible because you know the minister is
[48:43] supposed to uh minister is supposed to
[48:45] interpret that and then they have the
[48:46] confession box and things like that and
[48:49] it and it it puts God in the past
[48:52] because when uh when the children of
[48:54] Israel went before God he was in the
[48:56] temple at one time right and then you
[48:59] have uh the other uh spectrum of the uh
[49:02] denominations which is the Pentecostals
[49:04] and the Pentecostals they put themselves
[49:06] in the Millennium but with sin and it's
[49:09] like no you can't just yeah you may have
[49:11] experienced The Filling of the Holy
[49:13] Ghost and uh enjoyed the uh the gifts
[49:14] and stuff like that but you still have
[49:16] to live a clean life right so God hates
[49:19] denominations because it just it just
[49:21] spins you all over the place and it
[49:23] takes away how the Simplicity of the
[49:25] Gospel because a lot of times in some of
[49:27] your victories all you need is obedience
[49:30] right all you got to do is obey
[49:32] sometimes God says do that you do that
[49:35] the victory W right and a lot of
[49:38] Pentecostals don't get that right
[49:40] because they think they can do whatever
[49:41] they want live in sin and still have the
[49:43] victory all right and that's why they
[49:45] struggle with a lot of things uh on the
[49:47] Catholic side uh uh they need uh on the
[49:50] Catholic side they put their faith too
[49:52] much in men right but you can't follow a
[49:55] man and that's why uh even in this
[49:57] message like people try to bring the
[49:59] denominations into the message and
[50:00] that's why we don't bow down to the
[50:02] prophet we love brother Brandon right we
[50:04] love our Prophet right but uh uh if you
[50:06] read the story uh in the life of the
[50:08] Prophet you'll see when he was young I
[50:10] believe he shot himself in a foot or
[50:12] something and the Bible said that and
[50:14] not the Bible said but he said that he
[50:16] was falling down in the hill that's
[50:17] right and he said he was calling for his
[50:19] mom and dad when someone's going through
[50:21] hell you don't want to follow somebody
[50:22] that's calling for their mom and dad oh
[50:24] my you want someone that's calling for
[50:26] mommy and daddy when they're going down
[50:27] to hell cuz the Bible says that when
[50:29] Jesus descended into hell he was
[50:32] preaching right which is a type of Life
[50:34] which he was still living the standard
[50:36] in the region of hell you want to follow
[50:39] someone that has confidence that no
[50:42] matter what they're going through in the
[50:43] region of hell with all the tears and
[50:44] the horrors he was still keeping the
[50:47] standard he wasn't calling on God he
[50:49] wasn't afraid or nothing the prophet
[50:51] even said that he went right up to the
[50:53] throne of Satan took back the keys and
[50:56] kicked them that's somebody that you
[50:58] want to follow when you're going through
[50:59] a battle right and Jesus had the word to
[51:02] give him Victory through that but right
[51:04] because he knew Lazar had Rose from the
[51:07] gra rose from the dead he knew that uh
[51:09] uh Jonah was would be delivered out the
[51:12] uh uh the belly of of the fish right he
[51:14] had the word and that's why it's
[51:16] important for us sometimes that uh uh to
[51:19] deny ourselves denying yourselves gives
[51:21] you the victory right denying yourselves
[51:23] gives you the victory that's why a lot
[51:25] of times you know you're expecting God
[51:27] to do great things in your life but
[51:30] can't even wake up to read your
[51:32] Bible you can't even deny yourself to
[51:34] wake yourself to to read your Bible you
[51:36] can't deny yourself food to fast right
[51:39] fasting hasn't changed with American
[51:42] culture and current denominational
[51:44] preaching and stuff you would think
[51:45] these things don't exist no more but God
[51:48] hasn't changed his word amen sometimes
[51:50] you got to fast all right sometimes you
[51:53] got to put down the plate amen amen and
[51:56] in American culture it's real hard
[51:58] because we have an abundance of stuff
[52:00] you go into the store the candy aisles
[52:02] are full you go the public everything is
[52:04] full right so it's hard for you to deny
[52:07] yourself but sometimes you got to fast
[52:09] for a victory right another thing and
[52:12] brother Jack preached this sometimes you
[52:14] have to praise God when you're not when
[52:16] you don't even feel like doing
[52:18] it you got to praise God when you don't
[52:21] feel like doing it right all God all God
[52:23] is doing in these situations is teaching
[52:26] you how to deny yourself because just as
[52:29] much just as much as it is important to
[52:31] have faith in God oh I have faith in God
[52:34] it's just as important to deny the flesh
[52:37] amen it's important to deny the Flesh in
[52:39] order to get a victory and God does not
[52:42] need much God does not need much uh uh I
[52:46] can imagine that when David was going to
[52:48] fight Goliath right um I me let's say
[52:52] David went by a stream and he was going
[52:53] to go and let's say there was was a
[52:55] bunch of stones out there and David was
[52:56] going to pick maybe David was going to
[52:58] just a dramatization maybe David was
[53:00] going to pick up a big rock and God said
[53:01] no just pick up the small one pick that
[53:04] small one up yeah right pick that small
[53:07] one up right CU I can I can I can see
[53:09] you know maybe Jesus looking back cuz he
[53:11] said you know if you had the faith of a
[53:13] mustard seed it'll move a mountain which
[53:16] is and and what people what people uh
[53:19] the prophet taught us this thing is uh
[53:21] of having faith in mustard seed is just
[53:23] not having small Faith it's that your
[53:25] faith I mean that faith is completely
[53:27] unadulterated it's nothing but God's
[53:30] word ain't mixed with nothing that
[53:32] amount of Faith right can move a
[53:34] mountain and that's why the prophet was
[53:36] inspired to say that when the weakest
[53:39] Christian that's right even if you're in
[53:42] a situation and the enemy comes in your
[53:44] ear and says you're weak go ahead and
[53:46] agree with him because the prophet said
[53:49] when the weakest Christian gets on their
[53:52] knees hell trembles hell trembles
[53:55] there's still a victory right God
[53:58] doesn't need much but a lot of times we
[54:00] we in our minds and you think about it
[54:01] in the world today you know we got
[54:03] atomic bombs and you know in back in the
[54:06] 90s they talked about a space program
[54:08] where they wanted to create satellites
[54:09] to shoot uh shoot the missiles out the
[54:12] uh out the sky and we got all these
[54:13] bombs and stuff like that and it's like
[54:16] you don't need that much to
[54:18] fight if you have arms with if you have
[54:21] a problem with your brother just go and
[54:23] say sorry that's right one of the
[54:25] greatest weapons to cease all the wars
[54:28] just say sorry brother if I've offended
[54:30] you you're my brother and I love you see
[54:33] Christians don't need much to win and a
[54:35] lot of times and that's why a lot of
[54:36] times you see a lot of the Pentecost
[54:38] Pentecostals all the shouting they do
[54:40] and smacking people in the head and
[54:42] stuff on stage you don't need much to
[54:44] win Victory as long as there's faith and
[54:47] there's love right and even in a small
[54:50] abundance Satan doesn't like that right
[54:53] because it's a Living Word it's a living
[54:55] example it's it's showing him something
[54:57] that he's not and he can't stand and he
[55:00] can't stand against that right so in
[55:02] closing um you know
[55:05] it's it is important for us as
[55:07] Christians uh to recognize that we're
[55:11] living in a culture that is the opposite
[55:14] of what God thinks we're living in a
[55:16] culture that says it's okay to go
[55:19] through life and have plans and have uh
[55:21] uh uh uh uh try to try to plan your
[55:24] future and live in abundance things and
[55:26] just go you know going on vacation and
[55:28] stuff like that but sometimes when
[55:29] you're on vacation it's a battle may
[55:31] come up with family I know a lot of us
[55:33] have probably experienced that you're
[55:34] going on a vacation with your family you
[55:36] expecting to be relaxing and all a
[55:38] sudden somebody says something it's like
[55:39] oh
[55:42] man we supposed to be we supposed to be
[55:45] enjoying ourselves and all a sudden you
[55:47] in a battle and it's a reminder that
[55:50] you're constantly in a war right the
[55:52] world says you're on vacation God says
[55:55] you're in a war right no matter what
[55:57] you're going through God says you're in
[55:59] a war right so it's it's imperative as
[56:01] as Believers to take God and trust him
[56:04] uh uh uh in his word learn to deny
[56:07] ourselves recognize we are in a war no
[56:10] matter the situation no matter what
[56:12] we're no matter how good things look we
[56:14] can't fall to that deception right as we
[56:17] want uh pray to close
[56:20] out Lord Jesus Christ we thank you for
[56:24] your word oh Lord Lord God that has come
[56:25] oh Lord we thank you oh Lord God for the
[56:28] truth that you've placed in us oh Lord
[56:30] God it's a it's a confidence that we can
[56:33] stand on oh Lord Jesus Christ oh Lord
[56:36] God we know that we can't do the victory
[56:38] we can't we can't win the battle within
[56:40] ourselves oh Lord God that's why you
[56:42] that's why you told uh the children of
[56:44] Judah oh Lord in 2 Chronicles you said
[56:47] the battle is yours oh Lord God and Lord
[56:50] you prepare us oh Lord God and in that
[56:53] preparation the preparation is to deny
[56:56] ourselves so that you can shine through
[56:59] right and that's why people they didn't
[57:01] understand Christ yes he wept as a man
[57:04] that was to show that there was still
[57:06] there's still a man aspect there oh Lord
[57:08] but when that man aspect has gotten to
[57:10] the point where it can't do nothing else
[57:13] God you have to show yourself oh Lord
[57:15] God we're not depending upon our own

[59:32] practical uh things that he uh laid out

[59:39] we are in a war um and um God never
[59:43] sends us into the war
[59:45] unprepared and um you know and the other
[59:49] things that God's not going to give us
[59:50] all the
[59:51] details and um um and God doesn't need
[59:55] much for us to win so um that that was
[59:59] just a really really wonderful thought

[1:00:38] to hell brother brandom going to hell
[1:00:41] screaming for Mama and Daddy and God you
[1:00:45] know I mean he didn't say there was no

[1:00:53] hell he preached preach to the souls
[1:00:55] that were lost and the pre the souls in

[1:03:50] brother God bless you I actually have
[1:03:53] two pray requests um the first one is my
[1:03:57] one of my oldest Grands um is suffering
[1:04:01] from a constant nose bleed and today
[1:04:06] this morning it's actually gotten worse
[1:04:09] where where it's bleeding it's just
[1:04:12] running like water as blood clots so I'm
[1:04:16] not sure what the doctor's going to do
[1:04:18] with her as of yet she have to see a
[1:04:21] specialist when they talking about
[1:04:23] hospitalizing her
[1:04:24] to um take care of that issue and then
[1:04:29] the second one I have a
[1:04:31] um a patient that was diagnosed with
[1:04:35] breast cancer she asked for
[1:04:37] prayer um when they they diagnosed her
[1:04:41] back in August of breast
[1:04:43] cancer and they constantly was giving
[1:04:47] her
[1:04:48] medication and making it giving her more
[1:04:50] than what she was supposed to
[1:04:53] take and and um it burnt her skin real
[1:04:56] bad um her skin started peeling her face
[1:05:00] her hands she was hospitalized for a
[1:05:03] week this past week gone she couldn't
[1:05:06] walk her whole body had un swo up real
[1:05:10] bad so she was asking for prayer and if
[1:05:13] she's up to her she'll be in church with
[1:05:15] me on Sunday so just keep her in prayer
[1:05:18] um okay okay praise the Lord and um I
[1:05:23] know we have another the request back
[1:05:25] there but before I forget let me just
[1:05:26] share two things uh we'll pray for her
[1:05:29] tonight but if she does come with you on
[1:05:31] Sunday we'll anoint her with oil and
[1:05:33] pray for her uh again all right uh other
[1:05:37] thing is for your um
[1:05:41] granddaughter um you can either do this
[1:05:45] or you can have brother Jimmy do it but
[1:05:47] brother brandom said that anyone that
[1:05:49] had a nose bleed um what you do is you
[1:05:53] read
[1:05:54] Ezekiel 16 and6 three times over them
[1:06:00] and then you say a word of prayer so
[1:06:02] just make sure you read Ezekiel 16-6
[1:06:05] three times and then have a word of
[1:06:07] prayer over her okay before they take
[1:06:10] her to the hospital uh our daughter had
[1:06:12] the same thing one night and we I
[1:06:14] thought she was going to go to the
[1:06:15] hospital but I read that three times and
[1:06:18] prayed and she ain't had another nose
[1:06:20] bed since that time so not that I know
[1:06:23] of so um but just read that amen over
[1:06:26] your granddaughter yes brother you had
[1:06:28] um
[1:06:30] something pray I got an interview
[1:06:33] tomorrow and I just ask that the Lord go
[1:06:35] before me but also overshadow the
[1:06:37] interview just to make sure it goes well
[1:06:39] all right all right amen we will
[1:06:42] certainly certainly do that brother Jos
[1:06:44] here has his hand
[1:06:47] up um short testimony uh I thought it Go
[1:06:51] real good with the message um
[1:06:55] uh so a a lot of times like he was
[1:06:58] saying with David things that happen
[1:07:00] strengthen us strengthen our faith
[1:07:02] especially I think another message that
[1:07:04] he preached he said that even when
[1:07:06] something happens and you're you're uh
[1:07:09] uh strong through it and follow the word
[1:07:12] it actually also strengthen your faith
[1:07:14] you know it gives you better Victory so
[1:07:17] um uh recently I I had uh raised some of
[1:07:20] my prices and I made a letter uh stating
[1:07:23] that why my prices were going up and and
[1:07:27] and that my profit margin was staying
[1:07:28] the same was just the cost of uh Fuel
[1:07:31] and and and and and and stuff and there
[1:07:33] was two people this this one day I think
[1:07:35] it was last week on a Thursday um two
[1:07:38] people that that I needed hiding God in
[1:07:40] and I needed was going to them and I
[1:07:42] needed to let them know and it was kind
[1:07:44] of battling the devil was like kind of
[1:07:47] battling my head telling me don't don't

[1:07:53] it they're going to they're going to

[1:10:01] it cuz he helped me through that amen
[1:10:04] amen praise the
[1:10:07] Lord certainly appreciate uh that that
[1:10:10] testimony very very
[1:10:12] encouraging um all right um two things I
[1:10:16] want to ask prayer for my uncle I forgot
[1:10:19] to mention he um he lost his wife um
[1:10:23] want to say a week or so ago and um just
[1:10:26] want to remember my uncle James in
[1:10:29] prayer and uh my praise report is that
[1:10:31] I'm happy to be home uh we
[1:10:38] uh um we we made it there uh safely and
[1:10:41] and returned safely and I was um I can't
[1:10:45] say that you know when I when when I
[1:10:47] think about trips that long I I it's
[1:10:49] hard for me to get my expectations up uh
[1:10:52] because of just the the tra traving but
[1:10:54] we we didn't have we had one issue going
[1:10:58] where one flight uh was uh kind of like
[1:11:03] um not cancelled just delayed by an hour
[1:11:07] which would have caused us to miss our
[1:11:09] connecting flight which is you know that
[1:11:11] was a flight going all the way to Sydney
[1:11:13] but um uh we had prayer we asked for
[1:11:16] prayer Brothers prayed and God grounded
[1:11:19] the plane for us again and uh and they
[1:11:22] held they plane held up in Los Angeles
[1:11:24] and waited for us to get there from
[1:11:26] Atlanta before they would you know they
[1:11:28] would take off and there were 11 other
[1:11:30] people that were going with us but uh I
[1:11:32] believe it's because the two sons of God
[1:11:34] was on the plane uh that's why you know
[1:11:37] they they they did it but we uh we thank
[1:11:39] God for that and meetings were uh a
[1:11:43] great
[1:11:43] success um Australia is a nation that
[1:11:48] rejected or denied brother brandom from
[1:11:51] entering into their Nation
[1:11:54] uh he had filed his visa and they told
[1:11:56] him that he couldn't come and uh so you
[1:12:00] know when you have people that were re
[1:12:02] reject the prophet you can imagine just
[1:12:03] spiritually where uh where people are
[1:12:07] and most of the messages come into
[1:12:09] Australia through people that have moved
[1:12:11] there from other countries like
[1:12:13] Zimbabwe um um um New Zealand uh all
[1:12:17] kind of of the Philippines and people
[1:12:18] have come in and that's how the message
[1:12:21] is actually entered into uh the country
[1:12:23] but um you know when you get there and
[1:12:26] you see just um just the needs of the
[1:12:28] people spiritually you realize that hey
[1:12:31] if God has giv you something to be able
[1:12:33] to help somebody then you want to yield
[1:12:36] um whatever God has given you to be able
[1:12:38] to help so we were happy to be able to
[1:12:40] go and just be a blessing uh to the
[1:12:42] church they were certainly a blessing to
[1:12:44] us and and they're already talking about
[1:12:47] trying to do it again you know and this
[1:12:49] was not even the pastor I mean it was
[1:12:50] the people that came to the meeting the
[1:12:53] very first day of the meeting the very
[1:12:55] first day um they um they asked the
[1:12:58] pastor like are you going to do this
[1:13:00] again next year we need the next year
[1:13:02] and the year after that and you say well
[1:13:04] so I can't promise y'all uh that I'll be
[1:13:07] back but I certainly pray you know uh
[1:13:10] about it and we'll see what the Lord
[1:13:11] will do but um I say certainly we want
[1:13:14] to do all we can to be a help but uh we
[1:13:16] just got to wait on the Lord amen so uh
[1:13:19] but we thank God for a very very
[1:13:21] successful uh meeting there in uh
[1:13:25] Melbourne uh Australia amen uh so let's
[1:13:29] uh let's pray over the request that we
[1:13:31] have tonight and um and we will um

[1:13:50] people that were willing to pay right
[1:13:52] then uh on the price increase and Lord
[1:13:54] we just uh pray that just continue to
[1:13:57] bless his uh business um and and and and
