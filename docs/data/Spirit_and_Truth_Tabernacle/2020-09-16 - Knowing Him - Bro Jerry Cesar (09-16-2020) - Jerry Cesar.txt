come to feed on his word and by his grace and his mercy we shall see the salvation of the lord so uh we're going to turn into a scripture tonight we're going to read joe well chapter 2 verse 25. you could say amen when you're ready all right so it reads and i will restore to you the years that the locusts hath eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the palmer worm my great army which i sent among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that hath dwelt that has dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and ye shall know that i am in the midst of israel and that i am the lord your god and none else and my people shall never be ashamed and it shall come to pass afterward that i will pour out my spirit upon flesh all flesh and your sons and daughters shall prophesy your old man shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will i pour out my spirit and i will show wanders in the heavens and in the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the lord come amen may the lord has a blessing to his reading you may have your seats again it's uh it's an honor and a privilege to be before you tonight i trust that something will be said to encourage you and to inspire you just a little thought the lord placed in my heart and uh if i could use as a title tonight it would be knowing him i wish to also read um this uh so it says here uh it shall be one day that shall be known to the lord not day nor nights but it shall come to pass that at evening time it shall be light now we're certainly living in a time where it's both great and terrible and i believe brother branham himself even said if he had a chance to choose any day to live in he would choose this day this age uh though it's a terrible day it's also a great day for the believers and certainly the days of king david the days of what jesus even walked on the earth but never was a time like today and i realized that with bef within the uh before the found before the in beginning it was always a matter of knowing who god is and knowing that he he not he wasn't not only was but he is right he's the great i am and now through trials there's many ways you're going to know god you're going to know god through trials and as as david as david said uh david one that went through many trials now the enemy never attacks you to to know to get your life he's limited and he knows he can't get your life but he can try to take your joy and your joy is connected to what god is able to do in your life through you right now in the message everlasting life and how to receive it 54 12 31 the prophet says you'll go through trials and troubles and ups and downs and misunderstood now he said that doesn't have one thing to do with it so when israel backslid and went down to egypt they were black-slid but they never lost their covenant and that's the thing the devil is always trying to attack you with the joy that god has filled your heart with but he can't touch your she can't touch your life and if you can be if you can use god as a shield to not have still your joy you find yourself inspired now i wish to read here one who had stood the test one who went through many trials was job right job lost all that he had we know that he lost his family his uh his wife his daughters his sons uh all all of his blessings he lost all of that but god has such a confidence in job where he allowed he gave permission to the devil to attack him he said uh he said he said uh in the ninth chapter of the first joke of the first uh chapter of job he said now the sixth the sixth verse the first chapter now there was a there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before god and satan came also among them and the lord said unto satan winds come as thou then satan answered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it and the lord said unto satan as thou considered my servant job there is none like him in the earth a perfect and upright man one that feareth and issue with evil then satan answered unto the lord and said thus job fear god for naught has thou not made an edge about him and about his house about all that he has on every side that has blessed him the works the work of his hands and his substance is increased in the land but put forth down hand now and touch all that he hath and he will curse thee to thy face and i want to stop here but the the god had a confidence that he knew job was not going to curse him and if i can tell you god has the same confidence in you tonight he has the confidence because you are his creation you are part of him right now if joel's possession were in the power of satan he had the power to attack all that job had but job's greatest possession was his fear to god because his fear was surrendered was what he feared was that he was surrendered to god he had a fear to the lord and no matter what happened to his possessions his possession of predestination could not be compromised and all that mattered to god was that only upon himself which he told the enemy put not foot thy hand and once god speaks the enemy backs away once god speaks nothing else can stand against it and that was a direct order by by the lord himself so your greatest possession is that which your enemy cannot touch it's your victory and no matter what you go through in this lifetime the enemy cannot come close to your victory now through droves trials satan saw defeat but god saw victory satan saw losses but god saw opportunity satan saw sorrow but god saw strength satan saw discouragement but god saw inspiration and i wish to say job in the midst of his trial got so inspired that he started to prophesy he started to say things out of his experience with god at the time that no matter what the situation was he knew that his redeemer lives he knew though although skin though the skin worms destroy his body he would see god in his flesh and whatever you're going through tonight an inspired son or daughter of god is no match for motivated devil no matter how motivated the enemy is if you have the inspiration of god to strike your heart there's nothing that the enemy can do now job knew god through his trial his trial was to produce something greater out of him and job started looking around now when job couldn't look at his friends he couldn't look at his wife he couldn't look at his blessings he started looking around and as he looked around he saw nothing but life right he looked around in the seventh in joe 14 the seventh verse he said for there is hope of a tree if it be cut down that it will sprout again and that the tender branch thereof will not cease through the root thereof wax though the root thereof whacks oil in the earth and the stalk thereof die in the ground yet through the sin of water it will bud it will bring forth bows like a plant when job couldn't see or couldn't look at his blessings anymore when he couldn't look at his increase anymore when he couldn't look at his family or his good the things that made him happy the things that gave him joy when he couldn't look at those things anymore he just looked around so look around you tonight if you you don't have to look so far god is right there if you just look around you you'll find the inspiration now he then started to realize he said but in man he couldn't understand it he said in but a man dieth and wasted the way yea man giveth up the ghost where is he as the waters fell from the sea and the flood decayeth and drive up so man lies down and riseth and rest and riseth not till the heavens be no more they shall not awake nor be raised out of the sleep thou what is hide me in the grave thou what is keep me secret until thy wrath be passed that thou would disappoint me a set time and remember me if a man dies shall he live again so job at this point is identifying man with failure and dead things but when he got inspired he knew who god was when he got inspired he realized no matter what his situation was god had the final say now first peter chapter 4 the 12th verse it says beloved thinking not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened to you but rejoicing as much as you are partakers of christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed he may be glad who also with exceeding joy if ye be reproached for the name of christ happy are you for the spirit of glory and of god rested upon you and on their part there he is evil spoken of but on your part he is glorified now that's wonderful to know that whatever you're going through god is being glorified you may not see the glory but god is being honored and glorified through your trial it's getting to a place where you realize that god is not dealing with you as a sinner but as a saint this like job job was not a sinner he'd never sinned against god but but he had to come to recognition of that the prophet says this message for him will i accept now watch that man that had went through trials that man who had been purged god was not dealing with a sinner now he was dealing with a saint a man that's been purged by god proving to satan that there were mortals who would serve him in the face of conflict praise the lord amen now i'm gonna go to you also know god through faith you know god through faith when faith is revealed to you you know exactly who god is and and revealed faith is the inspiration of god being entrusted in you and that same inspiration produces the power of god so you are entrusted with the very power of god to do all the things that god did then what entrusted means to be entrusted with something is to be assigned a responsibility for doing something and someone that was entrusted with such a responsibility was moses and exodus the 14th chapter and uh this is this is where god was dealing with israel as a nation um and as he was dealing with israel he hardened the heart of pharaoh god heart in the heart of pharaoh so much so israel fled out of egypt went to the red went to the um they were cornered by a red sea and mo um pharaoh in his uh and his army rose up against them ran right after them now when israel was cornered by the red sea it was it was the end of the egyptians but it was the beginning of god and many times when you are pressured in this lifetime it's not your it's not your end but it's your beginning sometimes god will take you to a place of of of discomfort a place where you're not uncomfortable only so you can grow farther sometimes you may feel like you're taking a step backwards but you're taking a step backwards to take a greater step forward and that's where god can inspire you it's recognizing that you're getting to a place where you're nobody so he can be that somebody in you don't let that pressure don't let the pressure of the enemy discourage you tonight now many times many times god will allow uncomfortable situation to perform his miracle to bring you out and take you in and moses said unto the people this is the 13th verse of the 14th chapter and out of inspiration moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the lord which he will show you today for the egyptians whom we see whom you have seen today ye shall see them again no more forever the lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace now moses by in inspiration prophesied the end the end of his enemies by the spoken word of authority and god had to approve what moses said because he was entrusted with the responsibility and that responsibility was not the responsibility of his leadership it was not the responsibility of his position it was not the responsibility of of who he was but it was a responsibility of faith and as a believer you are entrusted with the responsibility of faith when you have the faith and god inspires you by his word uh in matthew 25 the matthew 21 the 21st 21st verse jesus answered and said unto them verily verily i say unto you if ye have faith and doubt not ye shall not only do that which is done to the fig tree but also if ye shall say to unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea it shall be done and if we just read that again it it never said if i say unto this mountain if you say unto this mountain and that's the responsibility that you have with faith tonight if you say you have to spoken word authority in your possession no matter what the situation is if you say it shall be done unto you now the children of israel went through the red sea and they witnessed the mighty miracle of god but now you can know god's blessings and not know who god is you can know god's miracles and wonders and all of his goodness and never come to who god really is and the what the only way you'll come to know god is by a true born-again experience and i once heard this but the new birth is not man coming out of earth to go to heaven for salvation it's the it's the god of heaven himself coming down and dwelling in men and when god himself can dwell in you and have his preeminence in you you have that same authority you have the same power of the word exodus 16 the first verse i wish to read this it says and they took their journey from ellen and all the congregation of the children of israel came unto the wilderness of sin which is between ellen and sinai on the 15th day of the second month after their departing out of the land of egypt and the whole congregation of chil of the children of israel murmured against moses an errand in the wilderness and the children of israel said unto them what to god we had died by the hand of the lord in the land of egypt when we sat by the flesh pots and when we did eat bread to the full for ye have brought us into the wilderness to kill the whole assembly with hunger now the these uh the children of israel did not know who god is they just experienced a mighty miracle a mighty blessings they saw the end of their enemies but never got to know who god really was and the only way you'll nev you'll know who god is is by a revelation the revelation comes through the blood the prophet says here christ is the mystery revealed but the revelation and this is paragraph 255 but the revelation come through the blood through jesus christ who is the blood of god created blood in the room and mary and paul knew him by revelation and that's how we know him today it's all it's the only way you can know him not say i'm a methodist that means nothing i'm a baptist that means nothing i'm catholic that means nothing but by the revelation that god has revealed a word to you he is the word and the word how you know it's revealed it lives itself and expresses his self through you and i believe somewhere brother branham mentioned that paul never walked the day with jesus he never saw jesus in the flesh face to face but he knew jesus more than all the apostles did right because he had a revelation of who jesus was he knew jesus the same way peter knew jesus upon this rock i'll build my church right jesus never jesus sitting there with with peter never told peter who he was but it took a revelation it took a time where where god g god himself from heaven had to reveal to peter this is who he is in paragraph 242 christ is the mystery revealed says did you notice paul never knew jesus physically paul never knew him the only way that paul knew him was by revelation by a vision following knew jesus by revelation peter had seen him in flesh but he didn't know him by inf by flesh because jesus said so flesh and blood didn't reveal it to you even my own life didn't reveal it to you but my father which is in heaven has revealed this thing to you that he is the word of god and upon this rock i'll build my church and paul who was persecuting christians thought he was doing right until he had a personal visitation from the lord and as he as as you go through this journey of life god is calling you to have us a personal experience where he can inspire you from day to day not today and gone tomorrow but an inspiration where you can be in his presence or he can be in his anointing in the chapter five i wish to read in acts the third verse paul says word says as he journeyed here as he journeyed here he came near damascus and suddenly there shine around him a light from heaven and he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying unto him saul saul why persecute this thou me and he said who art thou lord who art thou lord and the lord said i am jesus whom thou persecuted it is hard for thee to kick the against the pricks and he trembling and astonish said lord what will thou have me to do and the lord said unto him arise and go to a city and it shall be told thee what he must do and ever since that experience paul never remained the same now one of the many ways that paul knew the lord was through an all-sufficient grace paul in second corinthians chapter 12 where paul got to a place where he he recognized god was perfected in his weakness how many of us when we're going through a tough situation can glory in our infirmities paul got to a place where he had to know and recognize that he was completely nothing and this is where god would be able to lift them up this is where god himself who has the power can can fulfill his his word and paul's life now inspiration can only strike in the right atmosphere it takes the right atmosphere for you to receive the inspiration of god the inspiration of his word it's the it's the atmosphere of faith faith when that when you're in the atmosphere of faith it knows no defeat faith knows no condemnation faith only knows the word and when you're in the atmosphere of faith and only in atmospheric faith can you be inspired by the word of god i wish to use someone who was inspired by his word who was inspired by god himself abraham abraham was given a promise that he would have a son and even in his old age abraham did not doubt in genesis the 22nd chapter the seventh verse in that chapter abraham was put to the test after fulfilling what god said that he would have a son what was thought to be impossible and now after fulfilling that promise god's put god puts him to the test that take that same son and bring him to the altar and sacrifice him now what strike me in seventh verse it says and isaac spoke spake unto abraham his father and said my father and he said here i am my son and he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for a burnt offering and abraham said my son god will provide himself a land for the birth offering so they went both of them together and in the atmosphere of faith abraham believed that the lord would provide himself a lamb for the burnt offering god did not god did not tell him to say that but abraham knew that what god had promised god would fulfill and whatever you're going through tonight is the mere reality of a of you obeying god more important than what it's costing you is are you an atmosphere when you're looking at the cost of what is cost of what is what you're going through then the promise that god has given you abraham had his eyes fixed on what god had said what god had spoken and now he goes on to say the ninth verse and they came to a place which god had told of him and abraham did build an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood and abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel of the lord called unto him out of heaven and said abraham abraham and he said here am i and he said lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do thou anything unto him for now i know it that thou fears god seeing that hat seeing that thou has not withheld thy son but only son from me and abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in the thicket of his horns now what what are you withholding from god or what are you willing to withhold from god tonight where god can provide himself as your sacrifice himself as your lamb and to know him is to know life and in this hour it's gonna take a personal visitation from god where he's inspiring from day to day there's so many noise there's so many uh breaking news but at the end of the day that's all gonna fade away i think i said this before where we ought to just put the world on mute and put god on live where we can hear him daily where whatever god is saying we're in a position to receive we're in a position to to act we're in a position to go forward when abraham was given this order the bible says he woke up early in the morning and in the midst of his faithfulness god show up in a mighty way it's gonna take to know him abraham knew him moses knew him the prophets knew him and they knew this very day it would be a great and terrible day of the lord but yet in this hour there shall be light in the evening time and that's the hour that we live in we live in the hour where we will see the salvation of the lord the salvation of the lord lies in you you are his salvation because his life is living inside of you he just wants us to get to a place where we're wrecked where we understand and recognize that we're insufficient but his grace is sufficient for us his perfect his strength is perfected in our weakness and the inspiration strikes when faith is revealed and the faith is god's faith is not your faith we could never do it on our own we're unworthy to begin with but god himself came down took our place so that we could take his place so that his his faith could be could abide in us day by day another person who was inspired by god and who knew god by love was the samaritan woman now jesus was walking by and thought to to just stop at this time we'll just go and read it this is john chapter 4. all right john chapter four we'll start reading at the start reading at the sixth verse it says now jacob's well was there jesus therefore being wary with his journey sat thus on the well and it was about the sixth hour there cometh the woman of samaria to draw water jesus said unto her give me the drink for his disciples were gone away from the city to buy meat then saith the woman of samaria unto him how is it that some that be thou being a jew asking drink to me of me which am i which am ace woman of samaria for the jews have no dealings with the samaritans jesus answered and said unto her if thou knowest the gift of god and who it is that saith to thee give me the drink thou would has have asked of him and he would have given thee the living water now here jesus begins to speak things of this woman's life that no one else could she was in the presence of life never before was she in the presence of of life but at this very hour she prophet has said she may have gone grown up to hear the the word of the lord to know that there will be a day where the prophet has said a virgin shall conceive she had heard all of that but now she was in the presence of it and god strike her heart with inspiration by the spoken word she was able to recognize who he was and she knew him by love and because of the love that was in her she went and told everybody about this experience and this experience caused many to come running to god now my question what is your experience with god causing your french to do what is your experience with god causing your neighbor to do the scripture says yo my disciples will be identified with me by the love that you have with one another the experience that you have had with the lord has it renewed itself david never said restore to me my salvation but the joy of my salvation which means your experience needs to be renewed from day to day and when that experience is renewed the inspiration that god has given you you can inspire those around you you can inspire your neighbors and it's the experience the inspiration of the word and that inspiration creates it's the power of the spoken word dwelling in you and with the power of the spoken word there's nothing that shall be impossible it says if you say unto this mountain if you say not if i say if you say unto this mountain be thou remove it shall be done unto you god bless you [Applause] i was encouraged by that scripture matthew 21 the 21st verse if you say unto this mountain be thou removed and not doubt in your heart ye shall have what you have asked i pray who are watching online whoever you are it takes a personal experience with god to know who god is you can know god in many ways but if you don't know him by life where he has purged you from your ways where he has brought you out of darkness into his light then you don't know him yet the children of israel knew him in many ways but when it came time to enter into the promised land it was just joshua and caleb they went and came back and said we are more than able to conquer we're more than able to go it's it's to get to a place where we where you know that you are more than able to conquer that the enemy that had you bound you have him bound the enemy that had you chained up he's under your feet can we say man amen let us bound the word of prayer heavenly father lord we want to thank you god that you have you have called us that we may come to know you father lord we can only say we know you because you've knew us lord father i pray that your inspiration by your word would help us to know father what we have in our possessions that no matter how the enemy attacks there's one thing that he can't do you can't attack the life that you have given us heavenly father may you keep us inspired by a word may you father deliver us o lord whatever we may be going through tonight oh god may we come to know lord that you father are greater lord god i pray that those who don't know you yet lord that you would quicken their hearts by your word father they don't know you in the pardon of sin father may they know life can only come by jesus christ if they would believe and doubt not lord you shall give them salvation heavenly father may your word fall lord on every heart that it would inspire from the youngest to the oldest lord and god may we not keep the inspiration bottled in but may we also be an inspiration to our neighbors to those around us that from day to day the experience that we've had with you it would be clear to others lord just as the experience the woman at the well had with you lord she ran and told everyone and changed many lives heavenly father we thank you tonight that you will inspire us lord as you did before for you all the same yesterday today and forever we commit this time to your lord in jesus christ's name we pray amen [Applause] god bless you church i trust that you were inspired i'm inspired to know that god cannot fail and he's given us the greatest we the greatest victory the greatest gift and that's the gift of faith that we have the spoken word authority and it does not matter what the enemy presents he will come in like a flood he's come in like a flood to me and i have spoken the word and the bible says he shall flee so god richard bless you [Applause] tonight hey man get a lord another praise off how many enjoyed that amen knowing knowing him amen i was just looking for the quote i read a quote once where the prophet was saying it's not good enough to know your creed it's not good enough to know your catechism you know what is it called did i say that right catechism it's not good enough and this is the part that got me saying it's not good enough to know your bible and i had to stop and say whoa did he just say that it's not good enough just to know your bible you must know him an experience amen job had an experience with the lord amen paul had an experience with the lord that they knew him amen i believe we all had an experience with the lord that when times the
