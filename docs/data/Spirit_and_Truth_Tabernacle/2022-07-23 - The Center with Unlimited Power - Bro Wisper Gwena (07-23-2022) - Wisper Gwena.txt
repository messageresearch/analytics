attack them is that right so your pastors need your prayers is that right you promise to pray for your pastors the ministers in your church you know the bible says when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the lord will raise up a barrier against him is that right so god have you in under his protection under his care amen you have the best protectors that heaven can provide is that right you have angels that are encamped around those who fear the lord is that right when you're sleeping you have angels around you when you're driving in traffic you have angels around you no matter where you're at you have angels 24 hours a day taking care of you is that right amen he is wonderful amen amen amen uh we're gonna have the ministers stand up by name and then we will just honor them by clapping and letting them know we we appreciate them is that right amen you know the bible says that god has set five ministerial gifts in the church for the perfection of the church is that right

be gathered again in this place we thank god for such a privilege and for such an opportunity you know many times when we used to have meetings we would take them for granted isn't it and then kovi came and then we realized you should not take meetings for granted amen the opportunity that we get when we come to gathering together we have to take advantage of every single bit of it amen i am so happy to to be here and my special appreciation to our elder reverend wesko i call him the bishop and our sister west hey man and before i go verify i just also would want to appreciate those that have been behind this uh brother jack brother fredo brother mike and uh brother kobe um we really appreciate all your brothers for everything that you've done amen as brother jack said yesterday these meetings the way they came about was when i came for um sister rebecca's wedding and brother aaron amen oh yeah by the way we we have unresolved business [Laughter] amen he knows what that is he didn't pay lobola praise the lord so we we we just got to talking about this and um we were talking about brother weskos 80th birthday and how that you know it will be good for us to to come to be together and i really wanted to come for brother weskos 80th birthday but when we go to talking together with the saints in london because of our school calendar it was not possible for us to be here on the 4th of july because schools would not have been closed our schools were only closing i think on the 15th or 16th of july something like that so because of that we then made a request that if we can have this this weekend and we so glad that the brothers made a way for that to happen let's just appreciate them for that amen but the real event was really the best the celebration of a brother wesker and it's one birthday that i really really wanted to be around for so i want to say happy birthday reverend westgale [Applause] we we just want to unwind to go back to the 4th of july amen because that is when we were supposed to be here so we we we we kind of like shortchanged ourselves so because of that we want to take advantage of tonight amen now i first met brother wesko i think it's more than 20 years ago now when he came to minister for us in in zimbabwe and during that time i would drive brother wesker around take him to my house and we used to have fellowship and then when i moved over to to england he invited me to come over here so in the united states this was the very first pulpit i first preached in in the usa [Applause] and that to me is is not a small thing amen and again apart from our home church uh zimbabwe and the uk in our home church um this is probably the pulpit that i've preached the most from outside of the home church i've preached more services visiting out of this place than anywhere else in as much as i've gone in a lot of other places but this place just keeps repeating there's just something about it something about south florida amen we we call it our second home now the first time i came here is we're probably going back now about 16 years or thereabout so it's been a while and we we thank god for um how far he has brought us um when brother wesko would come to preach back then wow i saw this man come to the pulpit and i saw how he would take the quotations and how you just stay with the courts and then he would be ministering around those courts i said my i like this style i just want to say to the saints from london that that is what shaped me that's why i caught a lot i learned it from brother wesko amen it changed the way i approached the message we used to court but not that much but when brother wesco came i picked up a new dimension and that's how much the influence has been [Applause] that's why i call him bishop westfall amen praise the lord so on behalf of the saints of my my my country friends in zimbabwe the saints in london our church the spoken word ministries i want to say a very happy birthday to brother wesker again amen and just as an expression of our wishes i'm just going to invite our precious brother a bed nego he's one of our elders and we have a little something to just give to brother wesker before we get on with the ministration of the word so if would just ask our brother to come forward reverend wesko sister wesko you can just help him along amen praise the lord please come brother and all the saints from london together with your children if you don't mind standing this is just our better wishes for our elder for all the years that you have ministered to us the fellowship we have had this is an expression of all love god bless you so much amen praise the lord god bless you all amen brother joseph why don't you just help us sing happy birthday amen this is just special for us we missed the fourth so we said we just want to unwind if you don't mind you can just stand up and help a scene help a bad day till you happy birthday to you [Music] happy

happy birthday too happy birthday to you give the lord a hand of praise we appreciate the lord for the elder god bless you saints amen amen praise the lord that's special isn't it for a man that deserves it amen and on that we can come to the ministration of the word so i'm going to invite you to just stand to your feet i know the house is well fed with the sound if you just tweak my monitors just for me only just a little bit just my monitors praise the lord amen and once we've found the level let's just keep it right there amen whilst we're standing we just gonna start from the book of second corinthians chapter ten starting from verse three the scripture says for thou we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds what a scripture and then in the book of hebrews chapter 11 it says now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not sin for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh we may be seated as we bow our heads for a weight of prayer mighty god father we now come to that sacred time the time lord father that we gather for the time of the ministration of the word unable but looking to the able god feeble but looking to the o strong and mighty god father i confess my inabilities and i ask oh god that you can step right in now father is your children we are ready we ask you that you can speak to our hearts tonight lord we thank you father for bringing us yet again into this place but father our gathering will be in vain unless lord you speak to us we therefore ask that you the great one might take over now may we decrease and may you increase have preeminence in this place we'll be careful in all to give you the honor the glory and the praise and all the church shall say amen and amen praise the lord god bless you i mean under expectation how many is under expectation there's one thing that i know about south florida they know how to say amen that even if you came without a salmon when the brothers start to say amen the same one will come hey do we still have that are we still the same praise god in the highest i want to take a title and the title that i want to speak on i want to speak on the center with unlimited power amen just for us to get where i'm coming from i want to start by reading a statement that the prophet makes concerning this scientist that was called einstein how many of you have heard of einstein i'm sure a lot of us have heard of this scientist for those who do not know einstein he was one of the greatest scientists that ever lived a highly decorated scientist with walls plastered of qualifications remarkable scientists who made some remarkable discoveries now we we want to take our title and our inspiration off out of what the prophet says concerning this man the prophet of god says if ainston had only had the spiritual application as he had the physical application as he studied the laws of light and so forth he could have told us something as powerful when i heard his message on that great center some way into the skies that ever contracted with the center you could create earth and do anything and the power would be unlimited he had seen that now this is powerful but i want you to look at this saints though this man was a great scientist though this man was highly decorated with probably wars plastered of qualifications degrees and phds and whatever he had but we read here what the prophet is saying and the prophet is telling us of a limitation that this man had though great as he was but the prophet is telling us that the man had a limitation and the prophet is telling us that the limitation was because of the way and the realm in which he operated and the prophet is telling us here that the limitation was because the man was operating in a physical realm and the prophet says here if only he had the spiritual application as he had this physical application so we can begin to see here that man has got a limitation as long as they are still operating in a physical realm [Applause] and the only way to break out of that limitation it is for men to climb a little higher it is for men to live the physical side and get into the spiritual side are you with me church [Applause] the prophet of god says now if we who are acquainted with the supernatural would just take a man where the man in his senses is limited to his senses but a man and his spirit is unlimited now when we are talking about the senses we we're talking about the five senses here and we are talking about how we contact our earthly dimensions we're talking about the body here and the prophet of god says a man in his senses is limited to his senses but a man in his spirit is unlimited therefore let me say church that whatever you want to achieve in life if you want to achieve it from a physical realm you will always have limitations now the prophet of god tells us that any man that ever amounted to something had to set some goals they had to tie themselves to certain goals and say this i believe and thus i tie myself to it now many times those goals as we are going through this life's journey they are physical goals but i want to say that though your goal is physical but if you try and approach it from a physical perspective you're not going to get very far so no matter whether the goal is physical but let your approach be spiritual that's why paul writing in the book of corinthians he says for though we walk in the flesh we do not woe after the flesh yes we might leave in this flesh but let our warring amen let our fighting not be fleshly let it be spiritual though we walk in the flesh but we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare they are not canal but they are mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds so a christian strength hallelujah is not in the fleshly relying on the flesh is limited by how much muscle power you got relying on your intellectual power is limited to how much education and iq you have but when you come to the spirit praise god we step into a realm that is unlimited [Applause] now in order to understand why we end up with this limitation let's look at genesis chapter 1 26 and genesis chapter 2 7 because we have to look at how man was manifested upon this earth when we look at genesis 1 27 the bible says so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them so we find here that we have a created man but when we come to the genesis 2 7 man and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground so we have a created man and we have a formed man then god amen breath into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul now the first creation that god had what was the first creation it was a spirit man and then after the spirit man then we find that god then he formed man out of the dust of the earth but what god then did amen the mystery of the breathing of the breath of life into this man was when god amen then combined this man together with that man and man became a living soul are you with me saints praise be to god [Applause] that's how god did it but i want you to watch amen that this man when god originally created him when the spirit man and the body the formed man when they were different amen this here was what god created and this was what god formed and there is a difference [Applause] and the reason amen why this man is not limited it is because he is created in the image of god in the likeness of god here's the dna of god here's the capacity of god here's the capability of god he has the great abilities of god because he's the ship of the old block [Applause] now with that god ability this man amen all things are possible to him not some things or glory to god but all things that become possible to him cannot have what they are cannot how far they have gone cannot how impossible it looks but i want to say with god all things are possible [Applause] or we can almost begin to preach right here that when god's ability steps into a human being i don't care where you are i don't care how hard it looks i don't care how difficult it sounds but when god steps in praise be to god all things are possible it might be at the red sea and pharaoh is saying the god of moses is a poor general but what he does not know is that the core of moses hallelujah when he steps on the scene even when there is no bridge there shall be a bridge even an uncrossable red sea becomes crossable all things become possible it might be at the river jordan and it looks like it is flooded but when god steps in all things are possible it might be shadrach meshach and abednego that are in a fairy fairness but though they are in a very fairness all things are possible they are coming out or i don't know who is a shadrach today i don't know who is a mischief today i don't know who is in a bad today you might be sitting in a fire but i want to tell you you're coming out of it i got some good news for you you coming out of it say amen somebody hallelujah you might be in a lion's den but very soon the lions then will become the den of the of of daniel the tables will turn o praise the lord when satan puts you in prison hallelujah but when god is inside of you you end up imprisoning the devil that tried to put you into that prison [Applause] so church of the living god where we become powerful it is when we climb into the spiritual realm when we get into the spiritual realm we have territorial advantage when we are in the flesh we have a territorial disadvantage that's why paul says though i walk in the flesh but i do not woe after the flesh because i don't have an advantage in the flesh [Applause] i'm reminded of an ego that when an ego is attacking a serpent a snake no matter how big the snake is the ego comes from the highs and it comes sweeping hallelujah and he just comes and he picks up that snake and he takes it up into the air the moment the snake is in the air it is disoriented because it is not meant to be in the eyes the moment the snake comes up into the air it is completely disoriented the ego hallelujah a bird of the air now has territorial advantage it can do what it wants with that devil let me tell you you are an eagle of god if you take your problem into the spiritual realm you can do what you want or tonight you can do what you want with your situation when the eagle is up there with the serpent hanging on his feet amen then he just looks for a rock oh glory to god and when it identifies where the rock is then it drops the serpent and by the time it hits the rock the serpent is gone hey hey hey identify your serpent and identify the rock the rock is jesus and drop him right there he will be finished before the service is over [Music] let's learn to take it to the spiritual realm because that's where we have our advantage why because the spirit man this man here is a seventh dimension this one is the three-dimensional man this one he came from god but this one came from the dust glory to god now let me just come back to einstein now they say that einstein he had a very deep quest to understand how this world was formed it is said that he had a quest to know god's thoughts and i was reading an article that was published by another scientist highly decorated to call don lincoln and this is what the man says about ainston he says in 1925 instant went on a walk with a young student named esther solomon as they wondered he shared his co-guiding intellectual principle i want to know how god created this world this was ancient i'm not interested in this or that phenomena in the spectrum of this or that element i want to know his thoughts the rest are just details [Music] so this is what ainston this is what drove him he says i want to know how god created this world i'm not interested in this and that phenomenon this spectrum of this and that element all i want to know is his thoughts and he says the rest are details he goes on and he says the phrase god's thought is a delightful up metaphor for the ultimate goal of modern physics which is to develop a perfect understanding of the laws of nature what physicists call a theory of everything or the t-o-e and they say ideally a t-o-e would answer all questions leaving nothing unanswered like why is the sky blue it is covered why does gravity exist that's cover two stated in a more scientific way a theory of everything would ideally explain all phenomena with a single theory a single building block and a single force and he says in my opinion finding the t.o.e could take hundreds or even thousands of years this is what science is looking at and this is what science is trying to drive it and einstein made this famous statement and he says all i want a man i want to know god's thoughts the rest is not important no wonder why the prophet said these scientists shall find god before we the preachers show him to the people and the scientists they go deep into probing in science they spend sleepless nights they crack their brains they dig deep trying to understand trying to find out how was this world created they are looking at the thoughts of god and that's what ainston was looking for he was looking at the thoughts of god but i want to say church what science is looking for we already have what science is struggling to get we already know what it is we have the thoughts of god what are the thoughts of god the thought of god amen the prophet says a word is a thought expressed so now when you look at the evolution of the word or the end morphing of the word that's a new word right but the prophet taught us amen about god and murphy god changing form i'm talking about the enmorphing of the word when you look at the enmorphing of the word we look at the word stages the first stage that we find it is the thought of god in the back parts of the mind of god and then when god wants to reveal what is in the bad parts of his mind what does he do then god amen he makes his thoughts known in visions and in dreams to his prophets then when the prophet catches the vision then the next thing that the prophet does is he speaks the word habakkuk then says write the vision make it plain upon the tables so the vision amen it comes from the word form and it comes into the written form are you with me saints write the vision and make it plain way upon the tables but in this last day praise be to god god then says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel so in this days god made sure that his word was kept in voice form [Applause] the thoughts of god when you go to playing the message what you are listening to glory to god are the thoughts of god revealed in our day glory to god but let me say sayings that that is not the highest form of god can you see or this is blocking somebody all right the last stage amen it is the manifested word so in as much amen as we love the visions but that was not the highest form of god's word in as much as we love the written word but that is not the highest form of god's word in as much as we love the spoken word but that is not the highest form of god's word because god's purpose was not to keep his word here god's purpose was for us to eat the book and to become the book so when we become the book the book comes inside of you you become the manifested word of god let me tell you the highest form of the word i'm looking at it now when the word becomes flesh glory to god in the eyes amen and amen so what ainston was looking for i want to say things we already have and where is it amen we already have it and it is in the form of the spoken word it is in the form of the holy bible the thoughts of god what science is trying to dig into i don't have to go to university i don't need a phd i need to be in church and when i'm in church what i'm hearing is the thoughts of god [Applause] praise god in the eyes then paul comes along and he says for we who have known the mind of the lord that he may instruct sorry for who had known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of christ oh come on give the lord a hand of praise we have oh i wish i would leave in the days of einstein i'll say mr einstein what you are looking for we have oh come on saints shout it out we have the mind of christ [Music] [Applause] i don't need no book to tell me we have the mind of christ i only need one book that is the bible the spoken word the thoughts of god i don't need no physicist i don't need no scientific explanation i don't need no phd book i need the word we have the mind of christ [Applause] praise god in the hearts hallelujah hallelujah now why was einstein looking for the thoughts of god the reason why he wanted the thought of god is because he wanted to know how this world was formed is that what he said but we already know because paul tells us and paul says through faith glory to god we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god finished through faith we understand that the words were framed by the word of god hey mr einstein don't waste your time so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear but let's just get a little deep into this to me this scripture is a double entendre it is a scripture that has got a compound meaning because when you look at that scripture the scripture says through faith we understand that the world were framed by the word of god and the first meaning that you derive after out of that it is that through faith we who were not there when god framed the world we understand it by faith [Applause] our faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god that's the first meaning but the other meaning is through faith the words were framed by the word of god we have come to understand it let me say it again through faith the words were framed by the word of god we have come to understand it in other words the faith that framed the word of god is the faith that framed the world is the faith of god that god used his faith [Applause] through faith hallelujah that was the instrumentality through which god created the world let me bring you to the message the prophet of god says god said let there be and it was he believed his own words now when you believe your own word you have faith in your own words [Applause] and every material thing comes from the supernatural god spoke the world into existence when he said let there be he was anchoring it on his faith he said my word will not return unto me null and void but it will accomplish that which it purposes i have spoken it it will materialize hallelujah i don't need nobody to interpret that word the manifestation thereof becomes the interpretation of it so the faith of god hallelujah it is what created the world so science is looking for a single building block science is looking for a theory of everything but we are here to say we already know the theory that they are looking at what is that theory it is faith now ain't saying he believed that there is a center somewhere that if contacted that center would produce an unlimited power the prophet says here as he started the laws of light and so forth he could have told us something when i heard his message on that great center somewhere into the skies that ever contacted with that center you could create aids and do anything and the power would be unlimited so einstein believed that there is a certain center somewhere that if you contact that center you will have unlimited power or did you get what he said einstein is saying if you contact that center somewhere you will have the power to create another earth that's the power to create a brand new world but insane was looking at this power from a physical perspective and that is where his limitation was and that is why the prophet of god says if only he had the spiritual application of it because the signs they can only go this far the prophet of god says the tree of knowledge can only climb so far and it breaks back but the tree of life goes on forever so science can only progress until it gets to a certain place but science has a limitation so ain't saying was looking for the center amen that if it is contacted it will produce an unlimited power and he believed that that center was somewhere in the skies but i'm here to say no mr einstein it is not just somewhere in the skies we know where that power is it is resident with the god of creation it is resident with our creator [Applause] he created this first earth therefore he has the capacity to create any other earth if he so decides and how did he create this world he created it by faith through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that the things that which which are seen were not made of things that do appear are you with me saints god spoke his word and when god spoke his word his word could not return unto him null and void it had to accomplish that which it had been said to do so the center a man is not up in the skies but the center is in god but now that god who had that creative power he then transfers that power and to his own the very same power amen that created this earth hallelujah god transfers that power into his own children when you are born in the natural you are born with limitations but when you receive the second birth amen then god gives you another ability he plants inside of you another sense that is now a supersense can you say amen a sense that does not consider what the eyes are seeing a sense that does not consider what the body is feeling a sense that does not consider what is contrary to whatever you are trying to do when you have that super sense it does not matter how impossible a situation looks that super sense will speak and it will say shut up i'm a believer of the word and it will put the five senses of the body under subjection it is a super sense when the body begins to feel some excess that sense will rise and it will say i said shut up and the devil says oh you are not feeling well then the super saiyan say i say shut up i feel well let the weak say i am strong let the poor say i am rich speak contrary to what the eyes are declaring speak contrary to what the feelings are declaring speak what faith is declaring to you that's a supersense but i want to ask you sayings have you ever really studied the message to know what this supersense is we know the supersense is faith is that right but have you ever really studied to know what faith is that's super sense the prophet of god says in the message of supersense and the supersense is the holy spirit wow [Music] the supersense is the holy spirit the faith of god that dwells in you so supersense equals holy spirit holy spirit equals god [Applause] give god some praise right there [Applause] so the supersense which is faith is the holy spirit can i take it further in the message the supersense he says by that same sense god spoke when there was nothing what is that sense that supersense is god amen so faith is of finish it sense faith is then he says the faith of god in you the path of god that comes into you so faith is a part of god that comes in you oh glory to god by that same supersense god framed the world together with things which was not and did not appear he spoke his word and believed his word and the world shook into existence glory are you with me saints so faith is god faith is the holy spirit faith is that part of god that faith that comes inside of a believer or we can prove that faith is god we can get a little further into the scriptures and we can see that faith is indeed god because when we look at the stature of a perfect man the prophet of god came and he preached the stature of a perfect man and he says unto your faith ed but you start with what foundation faith but faith is the holy spirit did i just read that so faith is the holy ghost that is why when you read the message the stage of a perfect man the prophet of god says have faith and be born again is that what he says so have faith and be born again faith is the holy ghost faith is the foundation but when you climb high and go to the top of the stature of a perfect man then you come to life beloved let us love one another for love is of god and he that loveth is born of god but he that loveth not know it not god for god is faith is the holy ghost the holy ghost is god god is love so he is the alpha he's the omega faith is the same is love and it is all god can we look at any further in the book of hebrews amen chapter 11 verse number four the bible says by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain so we can see that this man as he was walking a man he had a faith and his faith manifested itself and amen he then ended up offering a more excellent sacrifice unto god but paul does not stop there because paul then carries on and he says god testifying of his gifts and by it what faith he being dead yet speaketh now come on church come on church this man is dead just take me to my diagram this man had faith when he was alive but when he died this was buried and when this was buried but yet through faith apple continued to speak [Applause] where is he speaking from in other words the faith was not buried with him when he was buried but the faith it went with him when the body when the ghost left that body the faith was here there therefore i give you to understand that that faith had to be zoey it had to be eternal it had to be a part of god and you can't bear god therefore when even when he is dead hallelujah he is still speaking amen because faith is yet alive [Applause] praise god hallelujah glory to god it is yet alive amen so you cannot bury faith once you have faith faith is eternal faith is that part of god that comes inside of you can we go a little deeper hallelujah romans chapter 10 how does faith come then amen romans chapter 10 the bible says so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god now what you are hearing is the word but as you hear the word o glory there is a mystery that takes place that when that word hits you then the word when it comes in you it is conveyed from being the word and it changes form to become faith [Applause] and the word they've got to be exactly the same thing as you are sitting here amen what you are hearing is the word but when that word hits your soul there is a mystery that is unfolding there is a change of what you are hearing and that is sitting in you as faith therefore the word and faith must be one john chapter 1 verse 1 then he tells me in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was now let's just look at this scripture again we read it so many times but in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was now is god playing with words here god cannot play with words but the scripture is saying in the beginning was the word and the word was with god now if i am with this word it means at a certain point there is an ability with what i have with me to be able to leave me but yet where it goes it still remains god oh get me right here church in the beginning was the word and the word was with god why is the word with god because it is the ability to live god but when it leaves god it does not change his form it remains god and that's why the bible says amen my word will not return unto me null and void in other words the word is the ability to leave god to go and carry out a mission [Applause] and when it goes to carry out the mission it does not return until it comes with an answer mission accomplished [Applause] and for re to accomplish the mission it has to be god [Applause] oh glory to god in the eyes so faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word of god now watch what is happening here we have got god which is the word amen but as the word is being preached something is taking place a word coming into the soul and as the word is coming into the soul word upon word word upon word at a certain point that word it now comes to live inside of you and it becomes a part of you [Applause] oh glory to god oh glory to god when god steps into you amen and amen now i can begin to preach when god steps into you you have now found that center praise be to god because this is the god that created the heavens and the earth this is the god that created this earth when that god steps into you you have now found that center of unlimited capacity of an unlimited ability you have now found that center that einstein was looking for and the prophet of god says and the power that will raise us up is right in us now we are now in heavenly places we are now in the power of the resurrection and if there wasn't a law to that sons and daughters of god would create them a world out there and go live a private life what is the prophet saying here he's saying what einstein was looking for it is inside those that have the baptism of the holy ghost there is enough power inside of them to create a brand new world and go live in it you have the power to do it oh let me speak until you believe it you have the power to create a brand new world [Applause] and it says if you have got a shadow of the power of god in you you've got power to do it god is omnipotent see what i mean the power that's in you will make you could speak a world into existence and go live on it hallelujah there you are what einstein was looking for that center that is out somewhere he said it is in the skies but i am here to tell you tonight it is not in the skies that center of unlimited power it is in the heart of the sons and daughters of god that which einstein was trying to find it is not in the skies it is in the heart of a true believer you could speak a world into existence and go live on it there you are that's what power is in the church now but it is controlled by a law and that law is not keeping a bunch of commandments it is a law of faith oh praise be to god when you have that amen when you have found that supersense when that god amen that portion of god that is called faith when it steps inside the heart of a believer now you are no longer a natural being now you are a supernatural being when that supersense comes the prophet of god says you walk by the sixth sense you talk by the sixth sense you live by the sixth sense you will die by the sixth hands and you will rise by the sixth sense that super sense something that's in you that's different from what's in the natural man oh come on church of the living god when that supersense steps in the heart of a believer when he's inside of you you now walk by that supersense you now live by that supersense you now talk by that supersense you will die by that supersense but you will rise by that supersense why because you can't bury god when he steps inside of you you can start to believe that all things are possible not some things but all things are possible can you say amen you can then start to believe that anything amen can be accomplished and i want to say anything tonight is possible oh let me repeat that anything tonight is possible the bible says in hebrews 11 1 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen but when you look at it from the amplified version it then says now faith is the assurance title deed confirmation oh glory to god faith is the title deed confirmation what is the title deed it is an evidence that you own that property hallelujah hallelujah when you have faith you have a title deed now it does not mean that when you have the title deed no one is living on your property there might be squatters there but i'm talking about who has the title deeds i'm not talking about who is staying at the house i'm talking about who the owner is when you have faith you have title deeds to that property i don't know what your property is tonight but i want to say you have title deeds to your health you have title deeds to your heart's desires you have title deeds to your children you have title deeds to your relatives you have title deeds to all that you ever need now if you have title deeds you have to take action and say now i'm serving notice for those quarters to vacate i want to say this evening you get ready to serve notice on any squatter that is living on what you have titled this for it is your right to tell the old man satan you don't have a right to live here this is my house this is my house i have a title deed to this place and when you cut title deeds you can give eviction orders and tonight i want you to give eviction orders oh let's not spare that devil you have enough power inside of you to create a brand new world i'm not talking about you creating a brand new world i'm talking about you possessing your property [Applause] satan is gonna let it go he's gotta give it up why because i have the title deeds and then it says divinely guaranteed in other words we are not talking about if you might get it it is divinely guaranteed we are only talking about when not if it's just about when and when you can decide you can decide tonight that tonight is the night i'm not waiting for tomorrow i'm saying tonight this is my when oh you say it according to the way that you believe it it is divinely guaranteed it is already a given it is yours if you desire it can you say amen somebody can you say amen somebody oh glory to god and the evidence of things not seen the conviction of their reality faith comprehends this fact what cannot be experienced by the physical senses though you are not experiencing it by your physical senses but faith declares it that it is possible now we can understand luke chapter 17. luke chapter 17 says and the lord said if you have faith as a grain of a mastered you might say unto this psychometry be thou plugged up by the roots and be thou planted in the sea and it should obey you now watch jesus says if you have faith as small as a mustard seed you can say to this psychomantri plugged up by the roots and be planted over there you can exercise the same ability that adam had in the garden of eden but though your faith is as small as a mustard seed why does the bible talk about a faith that is small and yet achieving big things the reason sayings it is because faith is a part of god and there is no weak part of god [Music] [Applause] there is no weak part of god if you have the tiny ounce of god brother that is enough because there is no weak part of god can you say amen if you have faith as small as a mastered seed when that faith praise be to god is anchored inside of your heart brother sister things begin to change you now have the center of unlimited power the moment god comes into you oh i wish somebody can get what i'm saying here when that steps inside of you it is unlimited what you can achieve but that faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word as you hear the word whatever your soul is led to believe the prophet says soul footprints of possession if your soul is led to believe that this is mine you can walk out of this church tonight holding that thing whatever it is call it your baby and say i'm walking out of this place with my baby in my hands i'm not walking out of this place empty-handed whatever god leads your soul to believe that he will give it to you [Applause] amen that's why saints when god wanted to give us the ultimate weapon by which we can destroy satan what did he give us he gave us the word faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word because god knew as you hear the word the word will convert in you to become a faith and that is the highest form of any weaponry that all god ever gave to human beings the prophet of god says now what is the word of god the word of god is god himself so god gave the believer himself amen it's god himself he gave the believer himself to attack the enemy by oh come on church of the living god god gave you himself that you can attack the enemy by or are you hearing me church are you hearing me church when the word comes inside of you god has given himself to you that you can attack the devil now that changes the picture it is no longer about you but it is about who is inside of you it is no longer about your height it is no longer about your complexion it is no longer about your accent it is no longer about where you come from it is no longer about your background it is no longer about how you were born you might have been born in timbuktu or whatever but brother sister when the word of god comes inside of you oh he that is born of god when she is born of god brother sister it changes the picture you can now go on the offensive you can now begin to say i'm not waiting amen for a problem to come my way i'm actually going out there to look for the problem because i have the solution i have god inside of me to attack the enemy by not to defend are you following me church many times as christians we are always fighting a defensive game but the tables have got to change tonight we are moving from a defensive mode to go to an offensive mode [Applause] when god comes inside of you you will start to take the initiative our god is not a reactive god no no no our god is an offensive god he attacks when he walked in the garden of eden and he saw before it was an eden there was chaos and he looked at that chaos and he says i am a god that takes initiative let there be and chaos started to ship until he produced the garden of eden when you find chaos in your life don't wait for somebody to tell you you address the chaos that is in your family you address the chaos that is in your church you address the chaos that is around you speak the word let there be peace let there be peace shalom let things change in this place when you've got god inside of you you step onto the offensive i look at david amen when david got to the battleground david skander and he saw a goliath that was busting us and everyone was afraid david did not wait for this man to come and attack him david went and he says what shall be done unto the men that shall tackle this giant and they all said oh yeah you will become the king son-in-law but bad bad but he says hey i did not ask about the bats i said what shall be done just tell me the price i'm ready to go and deal with that giant they say let's take you to saul so i said let me dress you in this armory he put it on but he says oh mr saul i ain't tried this i got something that i have tried i have tried it in the wilderness and it has worked for me my faith it gave me a bad want my faith it gave me a lie on one side my faith will give me that goliath i'm going on the offensive i'm going on the attacker oh come on daughter of god tonight let the table stand you go to the enemy's camp i want you to snatch back what satan saw from you i want you to go to the enemy's camp and i want you to say to satan enough is enough give me back i'm taking back i'm taking it back i'm taking it back by force and by order oh praise be to god in the highest when god steps inside of you it changes the picture paul then comes in the book of eclip of colossians and he says to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory what is the mystery christ in you the hope of glory what is glory glory speaks of splendor glory speaks of magnificence glory speaks of majestic glorious loaded with power and reputation without blame lacking nothing when god steps in you he becomes your hope of glory the very one that created the world when he steps inside of you he changes your situation he becomes the bowers in your ruth life the one that comes with the six measures to take a route from being a cleaner to becoming an owner oh am i speaking to somebody here god can lift you up from anywhere and change your position and plant you where you want to be can you say that is me preacher man god can take an esta from being an orphan to becoming a queen god can take you from florida can you say amen and give you a hope of life when life is done it blown you praise be to god in the highest hallelujah that's why john amen in the book of first john chapter 4 says ye are of god little children and you have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world who is he that is in you that is greater it is the faith of god it is that portion of god when he steps inside of you brother sister you become a paradox you will become the mystery yourself when you receive the mystery of god then you become the mystery yourself you become a knot for god you can walk as a crazy man but you can say praise god for the nuts because if it wasn't for the night it will all be a bunch of young [Applause] so praise god for the nuts or do i have a nut in here that says i'm crazy about god i'm crazy about believing i'm crazy about what god says to me what god promised in his word i'm ready to exercise it therefore let me say according to mach 11 for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt it in his heart but shall believe that those things which he said shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he said so when you are not for god you can begin to speak as a crazy person or tonight before we leave here i want to see some nuts for god i want to see some crazy people for god somebody that is determined to say i'm not walking out of this place the same way that i came in here i will be called crazy but let me be the nut for god for tonight hallelujah the prophet of god says when the strikes you ask what you will for tonight when the anointing strikes you ask what you will ask what you will how many is prepared now how many are getting ready now i don't know what your situation is but when the anointing strikes you ask what you will see it is in you speaking it is in you it's god it's you so submitted to god when he comes inside of you church of the living god you have that center of unlimited power you have found the thoughts of god you have found a man that great ability that will make things change in your life you have that power that can create a brand new world you have the thoughts of god that are now resident inside the soul of a believer or never never underestimate this church that when you know who is inside of you there is no giant that should make you afraid there is no situation that should make you hopeless there is no circumstance that you should say you know what i'm giving up on this when you have god inside of you it gives you options you become a jewish being because you are still in the body but inside of you is the power of heaven so when you are a jewel being you have an option of how to approach things when jesus was here the prophet of god says he was a jew well being and as a jewel being he had the ability to choose whether to approach things from a physical perspective or to approach things from a spiritual perspective what do you mean preacher man one day he wanted to preach and he had to look for a boat because he wanted to go in the middle of the water and start to preach from there so he borrowed the board and he stepped into a borrowed board but one day he was left with the disciples when he had gone up the mountain to pray and the sheep had gone away and there was no other boat to borrow what did he do he says i'm now choosing not to do what i did on that day this time around i'll step on the water and he started walking on the water that's what i call a jewel being can you say amen when jairus came to him jairus said i would want you to come and lay hands on my daughter jesus said aha if you want physical i will come and he started his journey and he started going but one day he became a centurion oh glory to god and the centurion said i don't want you to come physically just speak the word and my servant will be healed he had an option can you say amen it hallelujah he had the option after finishing baptizing the eunuch to jump into a car and go to the other place but in a moment in the twinkling of an eye he found himself preaching at the other place he was late to go to the next meeting because he had to preach to this unit which was out of the schedule but as soon as he finished preaching he just disappeared hallelujah and the next moment he jumped onto the pulpit and he says hey brother how come your clothes are wet he says oh no i was just baptizing someone where were you baptizing this person oh i was just in dallas now i'm in florida are you crazy with god all things are possible [Applause] oh what is it that the devil is trying to tell you it is not possible tonight i'm here to tell you it is possible it is possible it is possible we have seen far too much of god for us to begin to doubt god our god can do all things when i preached this message at our church i preached it in two series the first time on part one when i preached it we just had a testimony of a the sister was following our services when she was still out of the country and she was you know in south africa at that time and then the doctors diagnosed her of having a tumor in the spinal cord and they say that this tumor is an aggressive tumor and they said we need to have an agent operation on this tumor so they referred to a specialist and they say there's only one specialist you don't miss disappointment so she went to that specialist they did all their scans and everything and that specially says okay i have seen there is a tumor in your spinal cord we need to operate on this tumor as quickly as possible because it is an aggressive tumor they made preparations and they go there ready to be operated on that tumor and then they went to operating on here but when they opened it up on the spinal cord then they found that that tumor had now spread so much until they said we cannot do anything with it because it was on a very delicate place so they saw the up and they left here to go to palliative care and they said we can't do anything about it the sister of that sister is here she's right there that one called me and she said pastor my sister has got so much faith but how can god neglect someone with so much faith and she was crying i said okay let's call another brother that prays for the sick because i know he has got so many testimonies around cancer so we contacted that brother his name is brother mike modi and when he contacted that brother then the brother offered prayer over the phone when the prayer was offered over the phone then the doctor said let's take this sister back to an mri scan and let's see what is happening they took her back to the scan and when she was going through the scan the people that carried it because the neck had been operated and it would be so delicate you can't just move the body they have to be so careful how they are carrying this body around and then they lay there on there and then they put it onto the scan they took it out the doctor said he called and he said put it back in add some more died you know that which makes the tumor to show he said ed some more they added some more and the men she said they she heard them complaining to say doesn't this doctor know that this is a delicate someone that we are holding but the doctor said put it back in they put it back in and they took it out and then they took here to your hospital to to award when they took you to your ward the nurses said you are not supposed to move you are not supposed to do anything because now the next thing is you're gonna get a wheelchair they ordered a wheelchair for hair and then they ordered a wheelchair for her this was now gonna be a life until she dies and it wasn't going to be long after that because the tumor was aggressive but one morning one nurse walks in she found this sister standing up brushing her teeth and she was in a shock and she said hey what are you doing and she says i feel strong i can stand and i can brush my dis says you cannot do that with your neck says no but i can glory to god with god all things are possible hallelujah glory yes sir hallelujah amen that you create there praise be to god oh i like that [Applause] they took her there then when she was waiting amen she wondered what had happened one morning the doctor walks back and the doctor walks with a report and the doctor starts to read the report she the doctor woke her up and the doctor said hey mrs janna that was the name and she woke up and the doctor said i have some good news for you and they said what's the good news and the doctor said that tumor has disappeared i'm talking about a center with unlimited power that when doctors had failed when the doctors had said it is impossible when the doctors had said we can't do anything about this situation but god reaching mercy god rich in mercy he operated without any medical assistance he performed the bloodless operation [Applause] if you come to our church you will see her she's walking and she's free with an operation that was done by a miracle you can ask all these people that come from our church it's a reality all things are possible when you have found that faith you have found that center with an unlimited ability about the same time the daughter of this very brother called brother mike dory she she got married and they were expecting a baby they went to the doctor and they looked the doctor did a scan and when they did this gun the doctor said oh we have a problem the baby has got short limbs and the baby does not have a nose and they gave advice and they said let us terminate the pregnancy because this child will not survive but they said no let's carry on they waited and they thought by the time we got to the next car something will be about right they went and when they went still the baby did not have enough weeks went by it got to 38 weeks and they did another scan and the baby did not have a nose they brought the best doctors in uk and they started looking at this case and they said we are going to be we want to see what shall be the end of all this and as they were looking at the situation they wondered but how can this mother say i want to have the child anyhow one day the sister is listening to the message and i'm preaching in the church and as i'm preaching in the church i take the quotation where brother branham had this sister that came with a face tower or a hanky over her nose and brother branham said oh sister don't cry and she said i'm not crying and she lifted up the hanky and there was no noise brother branham prayed for that sister and then a few months later the sister walks back into church and said brother branham do you recognize me and brother branham says i don't recognize you and she produced the picture when she did not have a nose and now she's standing there with a brand new nose [Applause] as the sister was listening to the word she jumped up and she said my husband did you hear this quotation and the faith started getting boosted they prayed about the situation and they say this will not change we are not giving up on this they called on the father the father prayed and the prayer was there to holding 38 weeks the baby is about to be born they call for their finals karna and then they see the doctors they begin to turn they say oh ten this way they turn this way turn this way oh the doctors are looking surprised on the faces and after a little while they announced the baby has a nose [Music] the baby was born the baby is there and the baby has an ass our god is still able i'm talking about the center of an unlimited power of glory to god oh glory to god hallelujah that same power the prophet says that christ hallelujah let the fundamentalists let them people who deny the power of god say it's wrong but that same power that sparked the world into existence is in those people

believe that but he is a man fully surrendered to god is omnipotent and the prophet say what happens when two omnipotents meet when god and man comes together two omnipotents something has got to check whatsoever you say with that creative power of omnipotence of god knowing that he has promised and he said it in his word it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things to pass things

time before we see it but you have to just remember it was underneath that anointing that i spoke it because i know who lives on the inside of me the same god that created the the universe that god lives inside of me and i just love that because i was just sitting there thinking i said you know the same god that said let there be you know brother branham told us that when he spoke it it didn't come immediately he said it could have took billions of years before it actually came but you know what god never doubted one word he spoke at some point in time that sun was going to come some important time that moon was going to come but god never doubted and you can't doubt what you spoke tonight i don't care what you go through in your body what you go through your situation don't you
