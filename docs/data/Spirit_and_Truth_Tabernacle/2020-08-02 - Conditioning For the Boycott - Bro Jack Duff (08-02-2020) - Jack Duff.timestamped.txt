[0:00] god um it didn't get to hurricane status
[0:04] when it got to us
[0:05] just strong winds and rain and
[0:08] um we also miss the uh
[0:11] the brunt of the storm so we are feeling
[0:14] some effects but
[0:15] nonetheless we're able to bring online
[0:17] service to you on today and
[0:19] and we're certainly happy um to be able
[0:22] to do that
[0:23] amen we thank god for all things as we
[0:26] just
[0:26] opened the service on today i wanted to
[0:28] read from psalm 91
[0:31] amen seem like this is very very
[0:34] applicable
[0:36] to us here in florida as we
[0:39] face these various storms that come this
[0:42] time of year
[0:43] but thank god for his protection once
[0:46] again
[0:47] amen psalm 91 says he that dwelleth
[0:51] in the secret place of the most high
[0:53] shall abide under the shadow of the
[0:56] almighty
[0:57] i will say of the lord he is my refuge
[0:59] and my fortress my god and him will i
[1:02] trust
[1:03] surely he shall deliver thee from the
[1:05] snare of the foul and from the noisome
[1:07] pestilence
[1:08] he shall covet thee with his feathers
[1:10] and under his wings shalt thou trust
[1:12] his truth shall be thy shield and
[1:14] buckler
[1:16] thou shall not be afraid for the terror
[1:17] by night nor for the arrow that flieth
[1:19] by day
[1:21] nor for the pestilence that walketh in
[1:23] darkness nor for the destruction that
[1:24] wasteth at noonday
[1:26] a thousand shall fall at thy side and
[1:29] ten thousand at their right hand but it
[1:30] shall not come
[1:31] nigh thee only with thine eyes shall
[1:35] thou behold and see the reward
[1:36] of the wicked because thou has made the
[1:39] lord which is my refuge even
[1:41] the most high by habitation there shall
[1:44] no evil befall thee neither shall any
[1:46] plague come nigh
[1:47] thy dwelling for he shall give his
[1:50] angels charge over thee to keep thee
[1:52] and all thy ways they shall bear thee up
[1:55] in their hands
[1:56] lest thou dash thy foot against a stone
[1:59] thou shalt tread upon the lion and
[2:01] adder the young lion and the dragon
[2:03] shalt thou trample under
[2:04] feet because he has set his love upon me
[2:08] for therefore will i deliver him i will
[2:10] set him on on him
[2:11] because he hath known my name he shall
[2:14] call upon me and i will answer him i
[2:16] will be with him in trouble
[2:17] i will deliver him and honor him with
[2:20] long life
[2:20] will i satisfy him and show him

[24:17] the sanctuary so
[24:19] we're continuing to split the church
[24:20] like that and have the two services
[24:22] until um further notice i wanted to just
[24:25] make
[24:25] mention of an opportunity that has been
[24:28] given to our church
[24:30] uh i am i'm grateful this is something
[24:32] that we have been praying for you all
[24:33] know that we
[24:34] we're doing outreach services over at um
[24:38] pinnacle palms and we've been there for
[24:40] a number of years but uh what caused us
[24:42] to have to stop is this pandemic
[24:44] you know we couldn't go there in the
[24:46] midst of uh
[24:47] you know some of the elderly were there
[24:48] we wouldn't want to be the ones bringing
[24:50] in anything in we wouldn't want
[24:52] anybody to say well your church did this
[24:54] our heart
[24:55] is just to go and serve people take them
[24:57] the gospel
[24:58] uh that's the ultimate thing the gospel
[25:01] must be given
[25:02] to the people when we're giving when
[25:03] we're doing uh um
[25:05] fulfilling the the commission the great
[25:07] commission that the lord jesus gave us
[25:09] to go into all the world and preach the
[25:11] gospel
[25:11] uh you know that's that's what it's all
[25:13] about so you know there are certain
[25:15] things that we do
[25:16] just to get people's attention but
[25:18] ultimately we want to bring them
[25:20] the gospel amen the hope of salvation
[25:24] through
[25:25] our lord and savior jesus christ he's
[25:27] changed our lives and we ought to be
[25:29] willing to share that with others so
[25:31] he can change their lives as well uh but
[25:33] this new opportunity has been given to
[25:35] us as
[25:36] uh pinnacle palms no longer are we able
[25:38] to go there and preach the gospel the
[25:40] way that we desire to
[25:42] what has been given to us someone
[25:43] reached out to me and said you know
[25:45] uh we have this food pantry that we uh
[25:49] have and we don't have anybody to run it
[25:51] it runs
[25:52] pretty much by itself all you got to do
[25:53] is take the food and just give it to the
[25:55] people you know but we need someone to
[25:57] be responsible for it
[25:58] and uh they took me and showed me the
[26:00] little neighborhood right here
[26:02] you know within uh within about five or
[26:04] six miles of the church
[26:05] and uh they showed me a little
[26:06] neighborhood of where they do everything
[26:08] i say wow this is this is a really good
[26:10] opportunity
[26:11] and um you know so i was um start you
[26:13] know just looking at it and praying
[26:15] about it
[26:16] and uh and we we decided that we're
[26:17] gonna take this on and it's gonna be
[26:19] every thursday amen i believe about four
[26:22] o'clock we'll be going to this
[26:23] neighborhood and just kind of giving out
[26:25] food to the families but the lord also
[26:28] just kind of put something in my spirit
[26:29] that you know while we're giving out
[26:30] food i would like to kind of get some
[26:32] cards made
[26:33] and i want the cards i just want them to
[26:35] say we pray for the sick
[26:37] we pray for the sick we'll have the
[26:39] church address on that but i want to put
[26:41] that
[26:41] those words in spanish i want to put it
[26:43] in creole i want to put it in english
[26:45] and we want to just give people an
[26:47] invitation to just be able to come to
[26:48] the house of the lord
[26:49] to be prayed for but before they're
[26:51] prayed for uh they will
[26:54] have to hear the gospel they'll have to
[26:56] hear the gospel
[26:57] we want to preach the word of god to
[26:59] them and then after they've heard the
[27:00] gospel
[27:01] then we give them opportunity to pray
[27:03] for pray for them and and i'm going to
[27:05] put on there maybe some instructions
[27:06] that when they're coming to the church
[27:08] that they'll need to bring that card
[27:09] with them it's like a prayer card
[27:11] that they'll have so when our brothers
[27:13] recognize that they got the prayer card
[27:14] you know exactly why they're here you
[27:16] know they want to be prayed for right
[27:18] they come they want to be prayed for so
[27:20] we just get some information from them
[27:21] and
[27:22] and then after the service we want to
[27:23] just minister to their needs
[27:25] amen uh those that would need prayer we
[27:27] want to minister to their needs so
[27:30] uh we want to do that and and i believe
[27:32] that's something that the lord's just
[27:33] kind of laid in our laps i believe it's
[27:34] an
[27:34] answer to one of our prayers of just
[27:36] being able to do outreach and and when
[27:38] we talk about going into all the world
[27:40] and preaching the gospel
[27:41] uh that's right in our own neighborhoods
[27:43] we don't have to go to another country
[27:45] to do that
[27:45] we can do that right here in our own
[27:47] neighborhoods there are people right
[27:48] around us that need
[27:50] to hear about the hope that we have
[27:52] found
[27:53] in christ so i believe the lord has
[27:55] given us this and
[27:56] amen uh sister tina is going to be
[27:58] spearheading amen these efforts and
[28:00] and if you desire and you're able to
[28:02] just dedicate some time it might
[28:04] maybe you can come only certain
[28:06] thursdays of the month or something like
[28:08] that but we love for you just to be a
[28:09] part of it
[28:10] uh we need brothers we need sisters
[28:12] because they're separating of the food
[28:13] and then there's
[28:14] when we get the food separated we have
[28:16] boxes that we'll give to the people
[28:18] there's sign up sheets and things that
[28:20] that have to be done it's going to be a
[28:21] really really good operation and
[28:23] and if you desire to just be a part of
[28:25] it reach out to me also reach out to
[28:27] satina uh but uh but just find you know
[28:29] maybe you can commit to hey i can do it
[28:31] once a month or i can do it twice a
[28:33] month but it's gonna be every thursday
[28:35] at four o'clock we'll be meeting in this
[28:36] place about five minutes from here
[28:38] five five ten minutes from the church
[28:40] and uh it's
[28:41] centrally located so i think it'll be a
[28:44] real real blessing so
[28:46] looking forward to this outreach
[28:47] opportunity i'm trusting that we have
[28:48] we'll have a chance
[28:50] to impact lives not just giving them
[28:52] natural foods
[28:53] amen that's to get their attention we
[28:55] want to bring spiritual food
[28:57] because that was that's what matters
[28:59] most praise the lord so
[29:01] uh keep that in mind keep it in prayer
[29:04] and uh
[29:04] you know just just uh uh if you desire
[29:07] to help us with that
[29:08] we want to and just access you just
[29:10] reach out to me reach out to satan and
[29:12] reach out to my wife amen
[29:14] just let us know that you're interested
[29:15] and we will try to get our team together
[29:17] so we can do this
[29:18] with excellence amen praise the lord so
[29:21] let's uh
[29:21] just talk about our giving here oh my
[29:25] um i actually
[29:28] updated the uh building fund
[29:32] and um i do need to bring that out so
[29:35] let me
[29:36] uh just mention that really really quick
[29:39] praise the lord i totally forgot about
[29:41] that
[29:42] but god knows if you all just
[29:45] we'll just quickly just mention this on
[29:48] the building fun
[29:54] [Music]
[29:57] the lord is good the one thing i can say
[30:00] is that the building fund continues to
[30:02] move in the right direction
[30:04] uh and god is just providing for us and
[30:08] making ways a man
[30:11] [Music]
[30:16] yeah um
[30:19] i i unfortunately i don't have the exact
[30:22] information that i need but i'll give
[30:24] you this
[30:24] here um so our goal
[30:28] this year was to raise a hundred and
[30:30] five thousand dollars towards
[30:31] uh our building fund uh what was pledged
[30:34] of that goal was sixty thousand nine
[30:37] dollars
[30:38] a man and what has been received year to
[30:40] date
[30:41] is twenty thousand fifty eight dollars
[30:43] in nine cent
[30:44] uh we thank god for that and then also
[30:46] uh our interest
[30:48] for this year is 2 278.19 that's still
[30:51] positive
[30:52] even in the midst of this great pandemic
[30:54] and how
[30:55] the um uh the economy has been impacted
[30:58] but we're still moving in a positive
[31:00] direction
[31:00] so our net for this year is three
[31:03] hundred thirty six dollars and twenty
[31:04] eight cent that has been
[31:06] uh raised and the good thing is that we
[31:08] have not had to use any dollar
[31:10] from the building fund for any other
[31:12] expenses
[31:13] it's just going straight to the building
[31:14] fund and uh god
[31:17] has been good to us so we're very very
[31:19] grateful
[31:20] uh some people look at uh charts like to
[31:22] say well y'all didn't do this y'all

[31:51] three-year plan
[31:53] uh for raising money and for our
[31:55] building fund

[34:15] to try to get us back up and running so
[34:17] just keep that in mind um
[34:21] one of the other things i want to make
[34:22] mention of quickly
[34:24] uh two weeks from now we are planning to
[34:27] do
[34:27] some services brother nathan bryant a
[34:30] man there
[34:31] in uh indiana um uh
[34:34] he was uh we were talking i want to say
[34:38] oh probably a year ago about trying to
[34:40] get some services done
[34:41] uh for this time of year we were looking
[34:43] at our calendars and
[34:44] and he was going to bring a couple
[34:46] brothers with him and and then
[34:48] uh i said well that'd be great we'll
[34:49] we'll get that set up and
[34:51] and then you know uh the pandemic hit
[34:53] and we were just like well i don't know
[34:54] if it's going to work because i wouldn't
[34:56] want to bring them into harm's way from
[34:58] indiana
[34:58] um you know because i was just told we
[35:01] we've become an
[35:02] epicenter down here in south florida and
[35:04] i just don't want to put you all in
[35:05] harm's way but i said let me just keep
[35:07] praying and see what the lord just gives
[35:09] me
[35:09] uh and in the middle of praying amen
[35:11] brother nathan has sent us a testimony
[35:13] of his mother being healed from stage
[35:15] four
[35:16] cancer uh god just did something
[35:19] supernatural god did something
[35:20] miraculous brother nathan has a ministry
[35:22] where he prays for the sick
[35:24] uh and uh and god has heard his prayer
[35:26] we were praying here like lord
[35:28] brother nathan has come and prayed for
[35:29] different ones in our church we had my
[35:31] own sister-in-law that was healed of
[35:33] cancer
[35:34] my mother had a problem with the
[35:35] circulation amen of blood
[35:37] and and god touched her in her body and
[35:39] just so many different things i had a
[35:41] a uncle that came here to the church
[35:43] that couldn't
[35:44] i mean he could barely walk he hadn't
[35:46] driven a car and
[35:48] and i don't know how and quite quite
[35:49] some time but he come here to the church
[35:51] got into the prayer line that he prayed
[35:53] for and after he left church that night
[35:55] he got in the car and drove 45 minutes
[35:57] home and been driving ever since his
[35:59] his appetite has returned he's gaining
[36:01] weight i mean
[36:02] everything changed went through a mighty
[36:04] healing
[36:05] right here amen just a couple years ago
[36:07] there was another man that came to
[36:09] church and he was
[36:10] bringing a relative of his and he had a
[36:12] growth you know on
[36:15] on his wrist and they said he came into
[36:17] the prayer line and he went
[36:19] went back home to washington dc and when
[36:21] he got to washington he says
[36:22] pass i don't know what happened but the
[36:24] growth is not there anymore
[36:26] see god is is proving that he's the same
[36:29] yesterday today and forever
[36:31] hallelujah so as i was just processing
[36:35] this and thinking about what can we do
[36:36] here
[36:37] uh the lord just put in my spirit just
[36:39] go forward with the services
[36:41] amen let brother nathan and the brothers

[37:01] for our young people we'll have a young
[37:03] minister that'll be preaching that night
[37:05] and uh but we only want the youth again
[37:07] we're doing this because of
[37:09] social distancing amen we can't have
[37:11] everybody come to the church so
[37:13] only the youth will be invited uh you
[37:16] know those uh
[37:17] i mean you know you what i know that
[37:20] some of us might
[37:21] uh even myself i'm over 50 and i might
[37:23] consider myself youth
[37:25] but uh you understand what i mean by
[37:27] only the youth praise the lord glory to
[37:29] god we don't want
[37:30] we don't want to have to turn nobody
[37:31] away and i don't think you fit the
[37:32] category
[37:33] you know but but uh don't don't don't
[37:35] please don't do us like that but
[37:37] but if you know we want the young people
[37:39] to come you know 20s 30s
[37:40] teens you know things like that even
[37:42] even some younger than that
[37:44] uh they understand the gospel bring them
[37:46] on into the house of god you know
[37:48] so we want the youth only that night

[37:58] 30. i'll let you know
[37:59] i'll confirm that in a little bit uh but
[38:01] we'll get started and have a young
[38:03] people service and this is strictly
[38:05] for uh the saints that spirit and truth
[38:07] tabernacle i know we have other young
[38:09] people
[38:10] uh around that might be watching this
[38:12] even video today
[38:13] some of the other churches we can't
[38:15] bring everybody together because of the
[38:17] social distances so
[38:18] it will be available online but this
[38:21] only the ones that will be welcome to
[38:22] the sanctuary are those that are
[38:23] attending the church right now
[38:25] you know so uh we we want we want we
[38:27] want to do that so keep that in mind
[38:29] amen and uh sister tabitha you're
[38:31] certainly welcome to be a part of that
[38:33] all right
[38:34] amen and i gotta get brother leo and his
[38:36] uh his children as well we wanna we
[38:38] wanna make sure that they're they're
[38:39] they're here but uh we're gonna do that
[38:41] uh the 15th 16th
[38:43] uh weekend uh we'll have a saturday
[38:45] night service
[38:47] for the youth then we'll have a sunday
[38:48] morning service and then
[38:50] on sunday afternoon the 12 o'clock
[38:53] service
[38:54] we will actually uh brother nathan will
[38:56] be preaching that service so those that
[38:58] are attending that service those that
[38:59] that
[39:00] regularly attend the 12 o'clock service
[39:02] if you have
[39:03] uh something that you need prayer for it
[39:06] might not even be for you it might be
[39:07] for a loved one
[39:08] uh but if you have someone that you you
[39:10] want to stand in the gap for
[39:12] uh we will have a prayer line that
[39:14] service and and we want to pray for the
[39:16] sick
[39:16] now those that are not able to attend
[39:19] we're asking that you would do something
[39:20] uh
[39:21] unique for us send us a text or send us
[39:24] an email or something just let us know
[39:27] what what you need prayer for and we're
[39:29] going to have brother nathan still
[39:30] commit those prayers
[39:32] to god it would be what we call a
[39:34] virtual prayer line service
[39:35] amen so uh those that are that are on
[39:38] the other end we're asking that you
[39:39] being
[39:40] be in tune with that service make sure
[39:42] you're locked in online
[39:43] because when it calls out your request
[39:46] amen we want you to touch and agree with
[39:48] him and believe
[39:49] that god's going to do what god promised
[39:51] to do i i'm thinking of the scripture
[39:53] that
[39:54] uh jesus was told by the uh by the by
[39:56] the centurion said you don't have to
[39:57] come to my house you don't have to come
[39:59] and touch
[39:59] my servant but if you would just speak
[40:01] the word only
[40:03] my servant will be made whole so we
[40:05] we're gonna put that in practice there
[40:07] will be some here
[40:08] in the sanctuary that will have hands
[40:10] laid on them amen
[40:11] uh but there will be others that will
[40:13] join us online and we want to pray for
[40:15] your requests as well so
[40:17] there'll be kind of a hybrid a virtual
[40:20] prayer line as well as a metaphysical
[40:22] prayer line so those that might have a
[40:23] need
[40:24] i was at the hotel and i invited a
[40:26] particularly
[40:27] if you know anybody that fighting cancer
[40:29] fighting this
[40:30] i mean tell them to come you know just
[40:32] tell them to get online because we
[40:34] want to we want to pray for them we
[40:36] really want to pray for them we believe
[40:37] god
[40:38] is in the healing business we have a
[40:40] preacher that just
[40:41] experienced it with his own mother so we
[40:43] know that god is real
[40:45] amen he's not dead he's still alive
[40:48] praise the lord so
[40:49] get ready for that church amen that'll
[40:50] be coming uh in the next couple weeks
[40:53] god richly bless you thank you so much i
[40:55] appreciate you all
[40:56] amen on today uh i will uh
[40:59] just turn our attention to the word of
[41:01] the lord amen here
[41:03] uh this morning uh those of you
[41:08] that have um been with us since
[41:10] beginning of the year you know
[41:12] that we have been on a journey um
[41:16] i've been preaching to you uh from a
[41:19] prophecy that was given uh back in
[41:22] the 60s and man 1962 there was a
[41:26] prophecy given
[41:28] and that prophecy
[41:31] was written for this time
[41:34] and what i've been doing is just taking
[41:37] uh paragraph by paragraph and just
[41:39] preaching
[41:40] uh from you know just grabbing a little
[41:41] inspiration from that paragraph and just
[41:43] preaching that to the church and just
[41:45] trying to
[41:46] not just leave it as a prophecy for you
[41:48] know years ago but trying to make it
[41:50] very relevant to where we are
[41:52] right now um god's prophet was told pick
[41:55] up his pen and write
[41:56] and which is very very um uh
[42:00] significant or i should say scriptural
[42:02] because the prophet isaiah was told the
[42:04] exact same thing he told pick up your
[42:06] pen
[42:06] and write amen a particular thing so uh
[42:09] there was a need
[42:11] for god having his prophet write these
[42:13] things write these things
[42:14] and send that you know to us in our
[42:17] generation that we
[42:18] might have something to hold on to in an
[42:20] hour like this
[42:21] so i'm picking up amen from that uh on
[42:25] today and i want to read just a couple
[42:27] scriptures so those
[42:28] amen everyone in your home as well as
[42:30] those in the sanctuary let us stand as
[42:32] we read the word of god
[42:34] and uh we trust that the lord will just
[42:36] bless amen
[42:37] our uh thought amen i'm taking
[42:40] a title today uh conditioning
[42:44] for the boycott a man conditioning
[42:48] for the boycott amen uh
[42:51] let us read out of romans um
[42:54] actually let's read from uh revelation
[42:56] 13. uh
[42:58] verse 11
[43:01] and then also we will pick up from
[43:03] romans 1.
[43:24] i left my little timer on my desk you
[43:27] just grabbed
[43:28] my um phone off my desk and just thank
[43:30] you
[43:31] uh revelation 13
[43:35] and um uh verse 11 says
[43:39] and i beheld another beast coming up out
[43:43] of the earth
[43:45] uh and he had two horns like a lamb and
[43:47] he spake as a dragon now
[43:49] so that we're not too alarmed on this we
[43:52] see things like this in the book of
[43:53] revelation it just kind of
[43:55] throws us a little bit uh but
[44:00] the um um the good thing here is that
[44:05] by god sending us a prophet we actually
[44:08] have a little understanding of uh
[44:11] what this is saying and uh if you know
[44:15] i'll just read i'll read this and then
[44:17] i'll i'll go into that just
[44:18] just for a second um and he exercises
[44:22] all the power of the first beast before
[44:24] him
[44:26] uh and causes the earth and them that
[44:28] dwell therein to worship the first beast
[44:31] whose deadly wound was healed
[44:35] praise the lord uh and he doeth great
[44:38] wonders
[44:39] so that he maketh fire come down from
[44:40] heaven on the earth in the sight of men
[44:43] now what brother branham tells us this
[44:45] this beast that um
[44:47] is spoken of here in this section of
[44:50] revelation
[44:51] uh 13 is actually the united states of
[44:54] america beast represents a power
[44:57] all right uh so here this is the united
[44:59] states of america and if you notice
[45:01] this the united states of america
[45:03] started off with 13 colonies
[45:06] uh our flag when we first got it it had
[45:09] 13 stripes
[45:10] i believe it also had 13 stars when they
[45:13] first created the flag
[45:15] so he was able to show how this is
[45:17] really this is the united states of
[45:19] america
[45:19] uh prophesied in scripture okay it's
[45:22] prophesied in scripture
[45:24] now when when it talks about in verse 13
[45:27] he doeth great wonders so that he maketh
[45:29] fire come down from heaven on earth in
[45:30] the sight of men
[45:32] this was actually the bomb that dropped
[45:35] on hiroshima
[45:36] an atomic bomb that was that was coming
[45:38] down from the
[45:39] uh from from the heavens uh and that it
[45:42] caused great wonders people wonder what
[45:44] in the world they get this type of
[45:45] technology from right
[45:46] uh great wonders you you the united
[45:49] states of america so some of these
[45:50] things that
[45:50] that people waiting to be fulfilled it's
[45:53] actually already been fulfilled and
[45:54] actually in the process of being
[45:55] fulfilled
[45:56] revelation is upon us even right now
[45:58] right so he goes on he says in verse 14
[46:01] and deceiveth them that dwell on the
[46:03] earth by the means
[46:04] of those miracles which it power to do
[46:06] in the sight of the beasts
[46:08] saying to them that dwell on the earth
[46:10] that they should make an image to the
[46:11] beast
[46:13] and this this first beast that we're
[46:14] talking about here in this
[46:16] if you go back and read the first of uh
[46:17] revelation 13 it's talking about the
[46:19] roman catholic church
[46:21] okay that's the first piece the first
[46:22] power uh that was there it's the roman
[46:25] catholic church
[46:26] it says um and and that they should make
[46:28] an image to the beast which had
[46:29] the wound by a sword and did live and he
[46:32] had power to give
[46:33] life um unto the image of the beast that
[46:37] the image of the beast
[46:38] should both speak and cause that as many
[46:40] as would not
[46:42] worship cause as many as that uh
[46:45] as would not worship the image of the
[46:47] beast
[46:48] should be killed so if you didn't
[46:50] worship the image of the beast then you
[46:51] you die
[46:52] okay uh verse 16 says and he calls
[46:54] causeth
[46:55] all both small and great rich and poor
[46:59] free and bombed to receive a mark in
[47:01] their right hand
[47:02] or in their foreheads okay verse 17 says
[47:06] in that no man
[47:08] might buy or sell save he that had the
[47:11] mark or the name of the beast or the
[47:13] number of his name
[47:15] all right so you couldn't even uh if you
[47:17] didn't
[47:18] go along with this system you wouldn't
[47:20] be able to buy or
[47:21] sell okay uh and here it is verse 18
[47:24] says here's wisdom
[47:25] let him that hath understanding count
[47:27] the number of the beast
[47:29] for it is the number of a man and his
[47:31] number is 603 score
[47:34] and six i want to just also just go back
[47:37] to a
[47:38] quick scripture i will uh
[47:41] honestly this is romans 1 16.
[47:44] uh honestly uh i just mentioned i was
[47:47] trying to sidestep this particular
[47:51] sermon
[47:52] uh i was you know i was going and just
[47:54] looking at other things that i could
[47:56] preach
[47:56] but it just seemed like everywhere i
[47:58] turned god just kind of kept bringing
[48:00] certain things right back to the sermon
[48:02] so
[48:03] i'm yielding amen and i've learned that
[48:06] in my journey
[48:07] uh just yield to the lord he knows what
[48:09] he wants said and he knows
[48:11] when he wants it said so i'm learning
[48:13] that uh here in romans 1 16
[48:16] uh my declaration for i am not ashamed
[48:20] praise god of the gospel of christ
[48:24] amen for it is the power of god
[48:27] unto salvation to everyone that
[48:30] believeth
[48:31] to the jew first and also to
[48:34] the greek praise the lord let us just
[48:36] bow on a word of prayer father we thank
[48:38] you for the ability to read
[48:39] scripture the lord we know it takes the
[48:43] holy spirit
[48:44] to lord help us understand what it is
[48:48] that we are reading
[48:49] uh here especially when we start looking
[48:51] at the book of revelation
[48:53] lord you put it there you place it in
[48:55] scripture for a purpose
[48:56] and and god uh we believe that you
[48:59] uh through your anointing would help us
[49:02] god to understand and position ourselves
[49:04] appropriately
[49:05] that we would be ready lord for the
[49:06] things that we are
[49:08] about to face lord help us god take
[49:10] control of our thoughts
[49:12] speak to every heart uh lord and only a
[49:14] way to you candace in jesus name we pray
[49:18] amen and amen praise the lord you can be
[49:21] seated
[49:22] amen uh so just bear with us as we just
[49:25] kind of go through this i'm i'm talking
[49:27] a man about the conditioning for
[49:31] the boycott and uh as a as i'm looking
[49:35] here at revelation 13 these this is
[49:37] prophecy
[49:38] this is this is prophecy there there
[49:40] there comes a time
[49:42] a man where uh we realize that the
[49:45] united states
[49:46] is represented here in revelation 13 uh
[49:49] and as i just mentioned this the country
[49:51] started off with 13 stars
[49:53] 13 stripes uh represented in revelation
[49:57] 13. and
[49:58] you know just uh uh uh we we can we can
[50:01] see just through a prophetic lens and
[50:03] this is the key i'm not looking at
[50:05] things through a
[50:07] uh uh a theo a theological lens
[50:10] i'm looking at things through a
[50:11] prophetic lens when it comes to
[50:13] scripture
[50:14] scripture was actually written to us by
[50:17] prophets
[50:17] amen so when it comes to interpretation
[50:20] of scripture
[50:20] we're going to need a prophet to give us
[50:22] the interpretation if god allowed it to
[50:24] be written by a prophet
[50:26] then he's going to reveal it through a
[50:27] prophet amen so
[50:29] you know we we take that prophetic lens
[50:31] and we look at what that prophet might
[50:33] say
[50:34] about particular scriptures and then we
[50:36] have clarity then we have
[50:37] understanding then we know where we are
[50:40] standing and then we
[50:41] we realize we don't have to have a fear
[50:43] but we can have amen
[50:45] the fear that we have is a holy
[50:46] reverence for god hallelujah but but
[50:48] we're not fearing all the things that
[50:50] about to come upon the earth because
[50:52] there's a promise to us as believers
[50:55] hallelujah
[50:56] amen but but here there's a a boycott
[50:59] a man that that is promising scripture
[51:01] you won't be able to buy
[51:02] you won't be able to sail unless you're
[51:05] taking
[51:06] uh this mark in your right hand or in
[51:08] your forehead hallelujah
[51:10] amen now now we need to understand that
[51:12] we're not looking physically for a
[51:15] mark in somebody's right hand people
[51:17] have tattoos all over their bodies
[51:19] you know and and so so with a tattoo i
[51:22] mean people got tattoos all over their
[51:23] heads so it's not going to be something
[51:25] physically that you're going to be able
[51:26] to see but i can tell you this much it's
[51:28] going to be having more of a spiritual
[51:30] implication because uh the the hand is
[51:33] what we use to work with
[51:35] amen and then the forehead is what we
[51:38] use to kind of think with and
[51:39] and sometimes we commit our work we
[51:42] commit our our
[51:43] actions we commit everything to
[51:45] something that's actually against the
[51:46] word of god
[51:48] hallelujah so we want to be careful of
[51:50] this what we want to
[51:51] do what we want to do in the south align
[51:53] ourselves
[51:54] with scripture amen we want to align
[51:57] ourselves with what god says
[51:59] we can't align ourselves with a man of
[52:02] the newest movement because there's
[52:04] gonna be another movement come out right
[52:06] we can't align ourselves with with
[52:08] things that are just not uh
[52:10] that that that that go against the word
[52:12] of god we can't do that
[52:13] no matter how good it may seem you have
[52:16] to watch the spirit
[52:18] behind everything that you're aligning
[52:20] yourself with hallelujah so i want
[52:22] i want to encourage you align yourself
[52:24] with what god says
[52:25] in his word that's the only thing that
[52:28] matters
[52:29] i want to read amen a couple of quotes
[52:31] here just to kind of get us started out
[52:33] amen we're talking about conditioning
[52:36] for
[52:36] the boycott and this message the mark of
[52:39] the beast
[52:40] uh god's prophet amen makes a couple
[52:42] statements here that i want to just
[52:44] bring to our attention he says says then
[52:46] i think i'll announce
[52:48] uh tomorrow night maybe if the lord
[52:50] willing says
[52:51] what we'll talk on for saturday night
[52:54] he says now tonight is the mark of the
[52:57] beast
[52:58] and tomorrow night the seal of gods
[53:02] they're the most uh they're they're two
[53:06] it says they're the two most of i guess
[53:08] most vital subjects
[53:10] to be spoke on in this day for i truly
[53:13] believe
[53:13] that we're living in the time of this
[53:16] investigating
[53:17] judgment of god now you know i'm gonna
[53:20] just stop and just
[53:21] inject something there on this
[53:23] investigating judgment
[53:24] you know uh the prophet says that
[53:26] oftentimes what
[53:28] what our uh leaders call ufos
[53:32] right unidentifiable flying objects they
[53:36] say
[53:36] we don't we don't know what they are we
[53:38] have no idea what this
[53:39] is brother branham tells say these are
[53:41] angels
[53:43] actually coming into this atmosphere
[53:46] investigating
[53:47] what is happening here on earth
[53:48] hallelujah do you realize before
[53:51] sodom and gomorrah was destroyed
[53:54] god sent down two investigating
[53:58] angels before he came himself and we're
[54:01] we're living in a time like that again
[54:03] where god is sending a man investigating
[54:06] angels and what they're what they're
[54:07] investigating is their they're
[54:08] investigating is it time for god's
[54:11] judgment to strike the earth
[54:12] i want to tell you something amen it is
[54:15] time for god's judgment
[54:16] to strike this earth people don't want
[54:18] to hear that anymore right but it's the
[54:20] truth this is prophecy
[54:22] that must be fulfilled we cannot leave
[54:24] out this part of the scripture
[54:25] amen god will judge the earth for the
[54:28] sin that is committed
[54:30] on this earth hallelujah let's go on a
[54:32] little further here
[54:34] he says uh i truly believe that we're
[54:36] living in the time of this investigating
[54:38] judgment of god
[54:39] i believe we're right in the day of it
[54:41] and we don't want to be
[54:42] radical we don't want to be fanatically
[54:46] we just want to approach it just as
[54:48] saying as the bible was speaking here
[54:50] and that's perfect of course it says and
[54:52] now in doing this
[54:54] we hear so many people today talk about
[54:56] the mark of the beast
[54:57] you've heard it for a long time what is
[54:59] it what does it
[55:01] where who's going to have it and if if
[55:04] they do have it
[55:05] what's it going to do to them what what
[55:08] could it harm you is there any harm
[55:11] to it it says well now we want to find
[55:14] out
[55:14] from the word of god first thing if
[55:17] there is a mark of the beast spoke of in
[55:19] the bible
[55:20] and the next thing what age will it
[55:23] pertain to
[55:24] and who will be the people that'll have
[55:26] it
[55:27] that's very important right says and
[55:29] what would you do
[55:30] could you have it and not know it oh
[55:33] ain't that something
[55:34] you could actually have the mark of the
[55:35] beast and not realize it look at it says
[55:38] could you have it and not know it and so
[55:39] forth
[55:40] says suggest just those questions so to
[55:42] the best of my knowledge
[55:44] that this would be one of the most vital
[55:46] two subjects that i could think of in
[55:48] the bible
[55:49] the mark of the beast and the seal of
[55:51] god
[55:52] amen these are two very critical
[55:55] subjects that must be
[55:56] a man spoke of so people are prepared
[56:00] for what is about to happen amen you can
[56:02] actually
[56:03] have the mark of the beast and not
[56:05] realize it
[56:06] hallelujah look at this i'm going
[56:08] further in another message questions and
[56:11] answers
[56:12] amen the prophet tells us something here
[56:13] we want to know what the market obese is
[56:16] and you know we realize there's
[56:17] something in the hand and something in
[56:18] the forehead but
[56:19] what really is this let's go a little a
[56:21] little deeper he says the mark of the
[56:24] beast
[56:24] is owned today amen so if you want to
[56:28] know what
[56:28] time is this going to happen it is here
[56:31] today
[56:32] glory to god amen it said the mark of
[56:34] the beast is on today
[56:35] the seal of god is the holy
[56:38] spirit amen and i remember preaching
[56:41] that at the beginning of this pandemic
[56:43] you know about that seal of god and i
[56:45] said there would be no
[56:46] killing until there was a ceiling amen
[56:49] according to
[56:50] ezekiel chapter 9 there would be no
[56:53] killing
[56:54] until there was a silly and i believe
[56:56] god is in the midst
[56:58] of sealing his people with his spirit
[57:01] that's why corona virus couldn't take
[57:03] you out amen that's why
[57:05] none of the other things that's rising
[57:07] up on earth are going to be able to take
[57:08] you out
[57:09] because god is preparing his people for
[57:11] his coming
[57:12] amen no killing till there's a feeling
[57:15] of the holy ghost glory to god amen look
[57:18] at this
[57:19] says the mark of the beast is on today
[57:21] the seal of god is the holy spirit
[57:23] now this is the critical thing this is
[57:25] why you can you can actually take the
[57:27] mark of the beast and not
[57:28] even realize it people are looking for a
[57:31] physical mark
[57:32] but it's something spiritual that we
[57:33] need to we need to worry about the bible
[57:35] is
[57:36] a spiritual book not a physical and
[57:39] natural book
[57:40] it is a spiritual book so to understand
[57:42] scripture
[57:43] you must get in the spirit to understand
[57:46] what god is writing
[57:47] look at this it says the mark of the
[57:48] beast is on today the seal of god is the
[57:50] holy spirit
[57:51] to reject it is the mark of the beast
[57:54] so to reject the word to reject the
[57:57] spirit of god
[57:58] the seal of god that's to receive the
[58:00] mark of the beast look at this it says
[58:02] ever who sees the holy ghost that you're
[58:04] supposed to receive it
[58:06] and don't do it automatically you
[58:09] take the mark of the beast because
[58:11] there's only two classes to exist
[58:14] all that didn't have the seal of god
[58:16] have the mark of the beast
[58:17] so to receive the seal of god is to
[58:20] receive the holy ghost
[58:21] to reject it is to have the mark of the
[58:24] beast there's a whole thing that's
[58:26] exactly right
[58:26] very simple not something a man in your
[58:29] head or in your hand
[58:31] but it's just rejecting the holy spirit
[58:34] hallelujah amen to receive
[58:36] the holy spirit is to be sealed by the
[58:38] spirit of god
[58:39] but to reject the holy spirit is to take
[58:42] on
[58:43] the mark of the beast so a person can
[58:45] have the mark of the beast
[58:46] and not even know it you know they can
[58:48] still go to church they can still feel
[58:50] the blessings they can do all of those
[58:51] things but they have rejected the very
[58:54] god
[58:54] that came to change their lives let me
[58:57] tell you something
[58:58] you can't live right on your own
[59:01] amen you've tried that many times
[59:04] and it has failed the only way that you
[59:06] can live right
[59:07] is you get a new heart and then you get
[59:10] a
[59:10] new spirit and then you get his holy
[59:13] spirit
[59:14] so those three things must take place
[59:16] inside of you
[59:17] a new heart then you get a new spirit
[59:20] not your own personal spirit
[59:21] but then you get his holy spirit
[59:25] let me tell you another way that god
[59:27] ordained us to receive his spirit he
[59:29] says
[59:29] he says repent hallelujah and be
[59:32] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[59:34] christ
[59:35] he says you shall receive the gift of
[59:38] the holy ghost he says the promise is
[59:41] unto you
[59:41] and to your children those that are
[59:43] false as many as the lord our god should
[59:45] call
[59:46] that's according to the book of acts
[59:47] chapter 2 verse 38 amen
[59:50] god has given us instruction on how to
[59:53] receive
[59:53] him all we got to do is follow his
[59:56] instructions
[59:57] let's go on a little further here see to
[59:59] reject
[1:00:00] the spirit of god is to take the mark of
[1:00:04] the beast
[1:00:04] to accept the spirit of god is to be
[1:00:07] sealed
[1:00:08] with his spirit amen all right let's go
[1:00:11] on a little further here
[1:00:13] amen this is coming out of another
[1:00:15] sermon questions and answers part two
[1:00:18] glory hallelujah amen look at this
[1:00:22] it says we've got to get in the spirit
[1:00:24] because we understand that this is the
[1:00:26] last days this mark of the beast
[1:00:28] amen is something that'll be happening
[1:00:30] in this time
[1:00:31] we don't have to put this off to a man
[1:00:34] some some great day
[1:00:35] uh you know in the future it's gonna
[1:00:37] happen in this time
[1:00:38] there was a people that were living on
[1:00:40] the earth at the right
[1:00:42] time when they knew jesus was about to
[1:00:43] be born amen maybe some of those people
[1:00:45] had no idea
[1:00:46] what was going to happen but god in his
[1:00:49] uh
[1:00:50] in his economy of time he knew this was
[1:00:52] the time that this thing was going to
[1:00:54] take place
[1:00:54] that prophecy of christ coming to the
[1:00:56] earth it was going to be fulfilled
[1:00:58] and i can tell you what has been written
[1:00:59] in scripture we are
[1:01:01] underneath a prophecy amen
[1:01:04] we're underneath the prophecy the united
[1:01:06] states is in the midst of that prophecy
[1:01:09] we are underneath this we realize it is
[1:01:11] closer than it's ever been before
[1:01:13] we're living in this time right now to
[1:01:15] reject christ
[1:01:17] is a take amen the mark of the beast to
[1:01:20] accept
[1:01:21] christ is to take the seal of god it's
[1:01:24] just that simple look at this he says
[1:01:27] question and answer part two he says
[1:01:29] we've got to get in the spirit of the of
[1:01:31] the last day
[1:01:32] when the last days are here you go to
[1:01:34] the dance hall
[1:01:36] you gotta get in the spirit of dancing
[1:01:39] amen amen
[1:01:40] amen amen you know typically when people
[1:01:43] are getting in the spirit
[1:01:44] of dancing they already listening to the
[1:01:47] music before they actually get there to
[1:01:49] the hall
[1:01:50] so so as soon as amen the dj begins to
[1:01:53] play a particular song
[1:01:54] there's just something overtakes them
[1:01:57] they say that's my song
[1:01:58] you know and you go running out on the
[1:02:00] dance floor to just
[1:02:02] let loose people get into the spirit of
[1:02:04] it before they actually go out there to
[1:02:06] do it
[1:02:07] hallelujah look at this he says uh say
[1:02:09] you got to get in the spirit of dancing
[1:02:11] or they won't dance
[1:02:13] if they don't get in the spirit so you
[1:02:14] gotta get you gotta uh
[1:02:16] you gotta you gotta you go to the church
[1:02:19] you've
[1:02:20] got to get in the spirit of worship
[1:02:24] before you can worship right so if you
[1:02:26] at home
[1:02:27] amen you don't have a a big blow up big
[1:02:30] argument
[1:02:31] amen it's hard for you to come to church
[1:02:34] and worship
[1:02:34] because you're actually underneath a
[1:02:36] different spirit at that time
[1:02:38] but if you can come to church with your
[1:02:40] praise music on
[1:02:41] amen and maybe you listen to the word of
[1:02:43] god on the radio
[1:02:45] or you're listening to a tape or
[1:02:46] something like that amen somebody
[1:02:48] preaching the word of god
[1:02:49] you are getting yourself in the spirit
[1:02:52] to receive
[1:02:53] something from god hallelujah if you
[1:02:56] ever want to get something from god you
[1:02:58] got to get in the spirit
[1:02:59] to get it oh hallelujah look at this he
[1:03:02] says this
[1:03:03] he says you go to the church you got to
[1:03:05] get in a spirit of worship
[1:03:07] before you can worship the world's got
[1:03:10] to get in the spirit of the last
[1:03:11] days before the last days come
[1:03:15] now this is a critical statement that is
[1:03:17] being made
[1:03:18] the world has got to get in the spirit
[1:03:23] of the last days before the last days
[1:03:27] can come
[1:03:28] so there has to be a conditioning
[1:03:31] hallelujah
[1:03:32] there has to be certain things take
[1:03:34] place in order for the world to get into
[1:03:37] the spirit
[1:03:38] of the last days in order for a great
[1:03:40] boycott to come
[1:03:42] there's some other things that's got to
[1:03:43] happen before and what i'm here to share
[1:03:45] with the church
[1:03:46] watch these things spiritually
[1:03:49] hallelujah
[1:03:50] i'm going to get into some things today
[1:03:52] amen that and i'll be honest this is
[1:03:54] it's not something that i usually do
[1:03:56] from the pulpit
[1:03:58] but uh and in light of this sermon
[1:04:01] in light of the prophecy that you know
[1:04:04] when brother branham was told to pick up
[1:04:05] his pen and write
[1:04:06] in light of some of that i had to
[1:04:08] address certain things
[1:04:09] amen i felt compelled as a pastor to
[1:04:13] address certain things
[1:04:14] hallelujah but but i'm trying to get you
[1:04:16] to see from a spiritual side
[1:04:18] amen i i'm not i'm not i'm not falling
[1:04:21] on this side of that side
[1:04:23] i'm standing on god's side i
[1:04:26] stand with the word of god hallelujah
[1:04:29] that's where i stand
[1:04:30] so so spiritually i want you to try to
[1:04:33] see
[1:04:33] that we're being conditioned for a great
[1:04:36] boycott
[1:04:37] hallelujah amen and this boycott goes
[1:04:40] against you
[1:04:42] you understand that because you're the
[1:04:44] one a man that refused to take the mark
[1:04:47] you've taken a man the seal of god
[1:04:50] therefore you're not taking the ark of
[1:04:51] the beast
[1:04:51] when i say you taking the seal of god
[1:04:53] that means you've been filled with the
[1:04:54] holy ghost
[1:04:56] hallelujah you pressed him in a man not
[1:04:58] only been filled you want to be refilled
[1:05:00] with the holy ghost
[1:05:01] you're constantly pressing into christ
[1:05:04] amen
[1:05:04] and with that constant pressing in the
[1:05:06] christ not only that you have revelation
[1:05:09] of the end time
[1:05:10] so you refuse to take the mark and no
[1:05:12] guess what the boycott will come against
[1:05:14] you
[1:05:14] you're the one that can't buy and you're
[1:05:16] the one that can't sell
[1:05:18] they're standing against you what are
[1:05:20] you going to do then
[1:05:22] hallelujah what are you going to do then
[1:05:24] you got to have something greater than
[1:05:25] what you got now
[1:05:26] amen let's go on church let's go on
[1:05:28] let's go on let's go
[1:05:30] that's nothing to be afraid of i mean we
[1:05:32] serve a god that would take two fish
[1:05:35] and five loaves of bread and feed five
[1:05:38] thousand just by prayer
[1:05:42] right and if he can do that showing us
[1:05:44] what the power that we have with
[1:05:46] with with within us when we have a need
[1:05:48] it will manifest
[1:05:50] itself nothing to be running from
[1:05:52] nothing to go try
[1:05:53] try to hide from this and no no no no
[1:05:55] they'll find you anyway
[1:05:57] amen but i i will tell you some really
[1:05:59] good news
[1:06:00] uh when it when the pressure really come
[1:06:02] down jesus
[1:06:04] is coming to take us home
[1:06:07] i got good news when the pressure really
[1:06:10] comes down
[1:06:11] jesus is coming to take us home that is
[1:06:14] part of the prophecy let's read let's
[1:06:18] read let's read
[1:06:19] the world's got to get in the spirit of
[1:06:22] this of the last day before the last
[1:06:24] days can come
[1:06:25] and we're in the spirit of the last days
[1:06:26] and god promised that these things would
[1:06:28] be here
[1:06:29] and that's what we got we're in the last
[1:06:31] days and men and women
[1:06:33] are setting asleep and don't realize it
[1:06:35] now why
[1:06:36] i'll you can take it down there i'm
[1:06:38] gonna stop there
[1:06:39] i i there there's a term that people
[1:06:42] even use
[1:06:43] today right and you you
[1:06:46] you sleep you need you need you need to
[1:06:49] stay woke
[1:06:50] they use these terms they don't even
[1:06:53] realize
[1:06:54] they're being conditioned right don't
[1:06:57] even realize they've been conditioned so
[1:06:59] so here the
[1:07:00] prophet tells us men and women are
[1:07:01] setting sleep
[1:07:03] and don't realize it sleeping don't
[1:07:06] realize don't even realize what's going
[1:07:08] on we just we just
[1:07:10] we hashtag anything
[1:07:13] don't even realize what we're
[1:07:14] hashtagging ain't done
[1:07:16] no research at all just sitting out
[1:07:20] there
[1:07:20] be careful what you do church hallelujah
[1:07:23] be careful who you identify yourself
[1:07:25] with amen
[1:07:27] be careful who linked to your page all
[1:07:30] right
[1:07:30] amen all right let me go a little
[1:07:32] further i
[1:07:34] i i i want to just i want to i want to
[1:07:36] show
[1:07:37] i i'm trying to show the spirits that's
[1:07:39] in the land
[1:07:41] amen and and when i when i start showing
[1:07:43] these things
[1:07:44] i don't believe that churches should use
[1:07:48] some of the things that's happening in
[1:07:49] our world today they shouldn't use that
[1:07:51] to draw division
[1:07:53] amen because sometimes a a minister can
[1:07:56] go into the pulpit and say things a
[1:07:57] certain way
[1:07:58] and it creates more division but what
[1:08:01] we're trying to do is bring a unity
[1:08:03] only in the body of christ amen
[1:08:06] hallelujah
[1:08:07] and i can tell you this right now amen
[1:08:10] the body of christ as a whole
[1:08:12] denominational church as a whole will
[1:08:14] never unite
[1:08:16] i'm gonna tell you why because the only
[1:08:18] thing that can bring unity is when we go
[1:08:20] back and agree
[1:08:21] with the word if we're not going to
[1:08:23] agree with the word
[1:08:24] there will be no unity so this is for
[1:08:26] individuals that
[1:08:28] are willing to say lord i say amen
[1:08:31] to what your bible say i heard what this
[1:08:33] man said and i heard what that preacher
[1:08:35] said but i say amen to what the bible
[1:08:38] says
[1:08:39] hallelujah stay with me here i don't
[1:08:42] think the church should use these
[1:08:44] things that are happening amen in our
[1:08:45] world today to draw division
[1:08:47] i want to say this separate from the
[1:08:50] world
[1:08:51] and stay with the word i encourage you
[1:08:54] separate from the world but stay with
[1:08:56] the word
[1:08:58] stay with the word and it's just one
[1:08:59] letter in that that changed
[1:09:02] those two words one we add that l in
[1:09:04] there
[1:09:05] separate from a world but stay with the
[1:09:07] word
[1:09:09] look at this a couple of scriptures i
[1:09:11] want to just
[1:09:12] mention because we align ourselves with
[1:09:14] all kind of stuff and
[1:09:15] i want y'all to remember this amen first
[1:09:17] john 2 15
[1:09:19] amen it tells us hallelujah in first
[1:09:22] john 2 15
[1:09:24] love not the world
[1:09:27] neither the things that are in the world
[1:09:31] if any man love the world the love of
[1:09:34] the father
[1:09:36] is not in him john 2 1 john 2 15.
[1:09:39] we're supposed not when we're not
[1:09:41] supposed to love the world
[1:09:42] or the things of the world so i want to
[1:09:44] encourage you separate from the
[1:09:47] world amen but find yourself a line or
[1:09:50] stay aligned
[1:09:51] with the word amos 3 3.
[1:09:56] i'm leaving this out here for you amen
[1:09:58] before you hashtag anything
[1:10:00] check your sources hallelujah
[1:10:03] check these things out don't just just
[1:10:05] don't get wrapped up
[1:10:07] hallelujah amen and just what
[1:10:09] everybody's doing
[1:10:11] there is a spirit underneath and i'm
[1:10:14] going to show you some spirits here
[1:10:16] underneath some stuff today praise the
[1:10:18] lord glory to god
[1:10:19] hallelujah amen i realize that this is
[1:10:22] something that is going
[1:10:23] that's broadcast on on social media i
[1:10:26] realized that you know
[1:10:27] but uh but nonetheless uh that's why i
[1:10:30] said i'm not ashamed
[1:10:32] of the gospel of jesus christ right i
[1:10:34] mean as a believer i want people to know
[1:10:36] i stand with the word of god
[1:10:39] look at this amos 3 3 can two walk
[1:10:42] together
[1:10:43] except they be agreed right so as we
[1:10:47] hashtag are you agreeing with this
[1:10:50] glory to god hallelujah and some things
[1:10:52] you don't have an opportunity to explain
[1:10:54] so you got to watch what you what you
[1:10:56] align yourself with you can always
[1:10:58] align yourself with the word of god all
[1:11:00] right watch this now
[1:11:02] this is a prophecy when the prophet was
[1:11:04] told to pick up his pen and write i'm
[1:11:06] going to spoken words the original seed
[1:11:09] it says uh pick up your pen and write
[1:11:11] and he said this message that you're
[1:11:12] writing 1962
[1:11:14] the angel of the lord comes and says
[1:11:15] pick up your pen write this out because
[1:11:18] this message is for the bride
[1:11:20] amen this message is for the bride this
[1:11:22] is talking about the spirit and the
[1:11:23] bride
[1:11:24] it says so so he wrote it in 1962 and
[1:11:27] here we are
[1:11:27] you know um you know well over 40 years
[1:11:30] later
[1:11:31] almost 50 years later and here we are
[1:11:33] seeing amen manifestations of many of
[1:11:35] these things oh glory to god
[1:11:38] amen do you realize that when jonah went
[1:11:41] down into nineveh
[1:11:42] and he and he prophesied to them that if
[1:11:45] they didn't repent god was going to
[1:11:46] destroy
[1:11:47] nineveh well it was one of the greatest
[1:11:49] repentance
[1:11:50] uh uh uh uh it was it was the greatest
[1:11:54] repentance that was recorded in
[1:11:55] scripture
[1:11:56] not only did the king repent but as
[1:11:59] people around him repented they even had
[1:12:01] the
[1:12:01] animals repenting that that that's some
[1:12:04] serious repentance when the animals have
[1:12:07] to go with sackcloth and ashes
[1:12:09] that's serious opinion i say only if the
[1:12:12] u.s could be
[1:12:12] or the whole world could be brought to
[1:12:14] repentance like that
[1:12:16] you know it they it delayed jonah's
[1:12:18] prophecy
[1:12:19] for 100 years repentance
[1:12:22] delayed a prophecy i want you to get
[1:12:26] that
[1:12:26] repentance delayed a prophecy
[1:12:29] now then stop it it came to pass a
[1:12:31] hundred years later
[1:12:32] hallelujah but you know what there's
[1:12:34] been some things that's happening we
[1:12:36] probably would've you know the rapture
[1:12:37] would have took place a long time ago
[1:12:38] but maybe repentance has
[1:12:40] has caused god just to kind of let me
[1:12:42] give a little bit more grace just a
[1:12:43] little bit more grace
[1:12:44] at some point in time we're going to
[1:12:46] extend all the grace that we can
[1:12:47] hallelujah we're going to frustrate as a
[1:12:50] nation
[1:12:51] the grace of god as a world will
[1:12:53] frustrate
[1:12:54] the grace of god look at this quote the
[1:12:57] angel told the prophet pick up his pen
[1:12:59] and write this is what he wrote
[1:13:00] a portion of what he wrote i'm not
[1:13:01] giving you the whole thing i'm preaching
[1:13:03] to you just section by section
[1:13:05] now look at this elijah's behavior
[1:13:08] moses behavior john's behavior
[1:13:12] leaving their field of service many of
[1:13:13] the people didn't understand them it was
[1:13:15] because they was rejected and their
[1:13:17] message
[1:13:19] right the seed had the seed had been
[1:13:21] sown now when you look at it elijah
[1:13:23] elijah was out there in the
[1:13:24] in the wilderness and you know serving
[1:13:26] god but god called him out of the
[1:13:28] wilderness to come back and
[1:13:30] challenge jezebel and ahab
[1:13:33] you know these false prophets that they
[1:13:34] they raised up jezebel paying for him
[1:13:37] he said let the god that answered by
[1:13:38] fire let him be god
[1:13:40] that was the judgment of god striking
[1:13:43] amen
[1:13:43] israel because them serving a false god
[1:13:46] hallelujah amen when moses went down
[1:13:50] into egypt he came with the
[1:13:52] judgment of god when he was calling for
[1:13:54] those plagues
[1:13:55] hallelujah we're in the midst of one of
[1:13:57] the greatest plagues that the world has
[1:13:58] ever seen
[1:13:59] and people don't realize we're
[1:14:00] underneath judgment
[1:14:03] hallelujah you know it gets so common
[1:14:07] it's so easy right you know
[1:14:10] when this thing first started people
[1:14:12] couldn't find toilet paper but when the
[1:14:14] toilet paper got back on the shelf
[1:14:15] everybody calmed down
[1:14:17] right they don't even realize they're in
[1:14:19] the midst of judgment
[1:14:20] can't even i mean actually what happens
[1:14:23] is that we're so
[1:14:24] unspiritual that we become desensitized
[1:14:28] to when god is moving hallelujah
[1:14:31] god help me to be spiritual so i can
[1:14:33] catch when you're moving in my midst
[1:14:35] hallelujah now watch this watch this
[1:14:38] there's rejected and their message
[1:14:40] the seed had been sown judgment was next
[1:14:43] and they
[1:14:44] was a sign to the people from god that
[1:14:46] judgment was at hand
[1:14:47] planting was over now this is the
[1:14:49] statement that i'm bringing to us today
[1:14:51] this is the part that i'm really
[1:14:52] preaching this is where i'm getting my
[1:14:54] inspiration from
[1:14:55] i believe someday
[1:14:59] the real bride of christ will be
[1:15:02] forced to stop preaching
[1:15:06] i believe oh hallelujah now you know
[1:15:09] they already do it
[1:15:11] certain things that they don't agree
[1:15:13] with amen
[1:15:14] on these social media platforms they
[1:15:16] would just take your video down
[1:15:18] i'll do but they already started these
[1:15:21] things say so so so he says
[1:15:23] i believe that the real bride of christ
[1:15:24] will be forced to stop preaching now
[1:15:26] i'm going to tell you if you're going to
[1:15:28] a church and they're actually forced to
[1:15:29] stop preaching something's right about
[1:15:31] that church
[1:15:32] but if there's a church that can still
[1:15:33] preach to the midst of this this uh
[1:15:35] amen the the mark of the beast being
[1:15:37] manifested something's wrong
[1:15:39] if that church can keep preaching
[1:15:41] evidently they have not said
[1:15:43] anything hallelujah that would go
[1:15:46] against the grain
[1:15:49] let me tell you when jesus went to the
[1:15:50] cross it's because
[1:15:52] jesus went against the grain
[1:15:55] when jesus went to the cross it's
[1:15:57] because jesus went against the grain now
[1:15:58] i'm not saying
[1:16:00] amen that we just try to find things
[1:16:02] that we can just stand against people on
[1:16:04] but no what i am saying is that your
[1:16:06] faith will be challenged
[1:16:07] and when your faith is challenged are
[1:16:09] you going to stay with the word
[1:16:11] or you're going to stand with the world
[1:16:13] popular opinion is not good enough
[1:16:15] i want to stay with see the world does
[1:16:17] not have a heaven or a hell to put me in
[1:16:20] hallelujah but god does
[1:16:23] look at this now look at this i believe
[1:16:26] that the real bright someday the real
[1:16:28] bride of christ will be forced to stop
[1:16:30] preaching
[1:16:31] the word of god the bible prophesies of
[1:16:34] it in revelation 13 16
[1:16:36] if you want to put it down denominations
[1:16:38] will
[1:16:39] force it to stop or take its mark
[1:16:42] then when the lamb would take his bride
[1:16:45] and
[1:16:45] say this is that's that's that's the
[1:16:47] part that i want to make sure we catch
[1:16:48] then the lamb will take his bride
[1:16:52] and judge the for this the
[1:16:54] he's referring to is the catholic church
[1:16:56] right he says denominations will
[1:16:58] actually force us denominations will
[1:17:00] come
[1:17:00] into amen this world council they will
[1:17:03] agree they've already
[1:17:04] they got a document that they've already
[1:17:05] signed in the past few years that all
[1:17:07] the church is going to come together and
[1:17:09] agree
[1:17:09] on on on a few things and stand together
[1:17:13] to try to
[1:17:13] try to have what we call a uh a forced
[1:17:16] unity
[1:17:17] it's not real amen but we're gonna sign
[1:17:20] this document and because you signed the
[1:17:22] document
[1:17:23] hey man you got to agree to stay unified
[1:17:26] for
[1:17:26] certain things that we're just gonna
[1:17:27] stand on now when it comes to
[1:17:29] amen uh even even if it goes against
[1:17:32] scripture they'll stand unified
[1:17:34] i can tell you there's a few people that
[1:17:35] was not a part of that signing
[1:17:38] few churches that was not there we
[1:17:39] weren't there
[1:17:41] and we'll never be invited i can tell
[1:17:43] you that much right now i want to i want
[1:17:45] to get you to see
[1:17:46] that boycott is that they'll
[1:17:49] they'll they'll stop they'll be forced
[1:17:52] to stop preaching the word of god
[1:17:54] amen and i'm not ashamed of the gospel
[1:17:56] of christ they'll be
[1:17:57] they'll be forced to stop preaching the
[1:17:59] word of god as the bible prophesied
[1:18:01] according to revelation 13.
[1:18:03] there's the prophet bringing that in
[1:18:04] there that the boycott is actually
[1:18:06] coming against you
[1:18:08] coming against the church but the good
[1:18:10] thing about it is that
[1:18:11] when that occurs the lamb which is
[1:18:14] christ
[1:18:14] will come and take his bride and he'll
[1:18:16] judge the
[1:18:18] for what she's done hallelujah thank god
[1:18:21] that we got something we can look to
[1:18:22] even in a time like this let's talk talk
[1:18:25] about this a little bit more
[1:18:26] this boycott amen i said we're being
[1:18:30] conditioned
[1:18:31] for the boycott now what a boycott is i
[1:18:35] look this up
[1:18:36] is to withdraw from commercial or social
[1:18:39] relations amen withdraw from commercial
[1:18:43] or social relations with a country
[1:18:46] organization
[1:18:47] a person a punishment or protest you
[1:18:50] know
[1:18:51] years ago some brothers was telling me
[1:18:53] amen
[1:18:54] that uh uh on the previous president
[1:18:58] over and over in in in uh one of the
[1:19:01] countries in africa uh the president
[1:19:04] told them
[1:19:05] that uh if you all would just agree with
[1:19:09] uh uh um same-sex marriage if you will
[1:19:12] accept that
[1:19:13] then we'll provide funding to you we'll
[1:19:16] provide certain funding to you
[1:19:17] and uh and the leaders of the country
[1:19:19] say no that's against what we believe
[1:19:21] according
[1:19:22] to the bible we will not sign an
[1:19:24] agreement like that
[1:19:25] so they got boycotted they were not they
[1:19:28] were not able to get
[1:19:29] services from the u.s because they
[1:19:32] refused to sign an agreement like that
[1:19:34] hallelujah and when they refused to sign
[1:19:36] an agreement then all of a sudden there
[1:19:37] was an uprise in their nation
[1:19:40] and and and the news report said a
[1:19:42] particular way to us
[1:19:43] but the people that said no it's because
[1:19:45] we refuse to sign that agreement
[1:19:46] now they created this uprising our
[1:19:48] nation but you know what
[1:19:50] the people found a way to get the
[1:19:51] ammunition that they needed they went to
[1:19:53] other countries
[1:19:54] and they got the ammunition ammunition
[1:19:56] they needed and they they were able to
[1:19:58] to satisf i mean to get the people that
[1:20:00] was rising up they was able to squelch
[1:20:02] them and get them calmed down again
[1:20:03] hallelujah
[1:20:04] had they had the ammunition initially
[1:20:06] they would have never had an uprise but
[1:20:08] because they refused to sign an
[1:20:10] agreement
[1:20:11] that said they agree with same-sex
[1:20:13] marriage
[1:20:14] hallelujah now it's not just them saying
[1:20:16] that they they they disagree with
[1:20:18] same-sex marriage
[1:20:19] the bible disagrees with it
[1:20:22] hallelujah i i know people that say you
[1:20:25] know i don't want to go to that church
[1:20:26] anymore
[1:20:27] because they preach against same-sex
[1:20:29] marriages
[1:20:30] well i'm not sure what church you was
[1:20:32] going to in the first place
[1:20:33] because the other uh if you don't if you
[1:20:35] if you're a christian and don't see that
[1:20:37] in the bible we need to have a
[1:20:38] conversation
[1:20:40] praise the lord it's clear that god
[1:20:42] himself is against it
[1:20:44] so as christians we also stand against
[1:20:46] it all right i'm going further
[1:20:48] amen a boycott is withdrawn from
[1:20:51] commercial or social relations with a
[1:20:54] country organization or person
[1:20:56] as a punishment or protest
[1:20:59] is to refuse to buy or handle goods and
[1:21:02] that's to be as a punishment
[1:21:03] of protest now remember according to
[1:21:06] revelation 13 16
[1:21:08] there's a refusal there is a refusal
[1:21:11] uh you know to be able to buy or sell
[1:21:15] if you don't take the mark of the beast
[1:21:16] and we've already identified
[1:21:18] the mark of the beast is to reject the
[1:21:20] spirit of god or the word of god
[1:21:22] to reject that it's all ready to take
[1:21:24] the mark of the beast hallelujah glory
[1:21:26] to god
[1:21:27] amen you got to choose which side you're
[1:21:28] going to be i'ma stay with what the
[1:21:29] words say
[1:21:30] look see so so a boycott is to refuse to
[1:21:34] buy or handle
[1:21:35] goods or as a punishment or protest uh
[1:21:37] to refuse to cooperate with
[1:21:39] or participate in a policy or event
[1:21:43] now i was looking at another definition
[1:21:46] the purpose of a boycott
[1:21:48] is to inflict some economic loss on the
[1:21:51] target
[1:21:52] a man to indicate a moral outrage and
[1:21:56] it's also to try to compel the target
[1:21:58] to alter an objectionable behavior
[1:22:03] oh my hallelujah now i'm going to tell
[1:22:05] you something when you're standing with
[1:22:06] the word and you're saying
[1:22:07] same-sex marriage is wrong you're gonna
[1:22:10] be boycotted one day
[1:22:12] amen they're coming against you one day
[1:22:14] but i'm gonna tell you when that happens
[1:22:15] it's because it was prophesied that it
[1:22:18] would occur and when when the pressure
[1:22:19] get too
[1:22:20] tight jesus christ will come for his
[1:22:23] pride
[1:22:24] but i'll tell you what until then we're
[1:22:25] going to stay with what the word of god
[1:22:27] says now let me go on a little further
[1:22:28] there was uh some some some fellas in
[1:22:31] scripture i was just you know just
[1:22:33] thinking to myself
[1:22:34] lord can we just go back in scripture
[1:22:36] and see where
[1:22:37] where your people were come against
[1:22:39] because of something that they stood for
[1:22:41] and as i was just kind of meditating on
[1:22:43] this on this sermon and i was you know
[1:22:44] going in different directions the
[1:22:46] brother sent me a little video last
[1:22:48] night and i knew that i had this
[1:22:50] you know thought in my mind say where
[1:22:51] where can we get you know
[1:22:53] uh somebody in scripture that might have
[1:22:54] been boycotted because they were
[1:22:56] standing with the words
[1:22:58] and i said lord i i the lord had given
[1:22:59] me uh two two boys down and
[1:23:02] i'm in two situations down in babylon
[1:23:05] glory to god and what i want to tell you
[1:23:08] is that the spirit
[1:23:10] that was in babylon that would force
[1:23:13] people to do things a certain way oh i
[1:23:15] hope we get this
[1:23:17] it would force people to do things a
[1:23:19] certain way
[1:23:20] amen and if you didn't do it the way
[1:23:22] that they were telling you to do it amen
[1:23:24] they would come against you
[1:23:26] i want to tell you that same spirit
[1:23:29] is living right now
[1:23:32] oh just let me let me just take my time
[1:23:34] to get there that same
[1:23:36] spirit that was in babylon is here today
[1:23:39] the media puts it out and don't even
[1:23:41] realize that they under the
[1:23:42] influence of the same spirit that was in
[1:23:44] babylon
[1:23:46] let me just let me read this let me read
[1:23:48] this
[1:23:50] uh just line me up uh
[1:23:54] on uh on the handwriting on the wall let
[1:23:56] me read this and i want to just kind of
[1:23:57] go into the story that was in babylon
[1:24:00] praise god just let me take my time that
[1:24:02] same spirit is here today church
[1:24:04] it's here it's here right now we are
[1:24:06] being conditioned
[1:24:07] for a boycott don't even realize it amen
[1:24:10] we hashtag it put it all over
[1:24:12] and don't even realize what we're doing
[1:24:13] to ourselves amen
[1:24:15] we got to be spiritual look at this
[1:24:18] handwriting on the wall
[1:24:19] he preaches the sermon he makes this
[1:24:20] statement says now i want you to notice
[1:24:22] as soon as the king saw the vision
[1:24:26] he saw this vision he made it he forced
[1:24:28] every person in his kingdom and his
[1:24:29] domain to worship the image
[1:24:31] he made an image and it's believed by
[1:24:33] scholars i do
[1:24:35] uh which i do believe that a
[1:24:37] spirit-filled person would see it
[1:24:39] see it that uh he worshiped daniel is is
[1:24:43] what he did and he made an
[1:24:44] image to daniel now there this is two
[1:24:46] different things kind of going on here
[1:24:49] even in this message you got people
[1:24:51] trying to have you worship brother
[1:24:53] branham we're not
[1:24:54] doing that here i will i will tell you
[1:24:57] what the prophet said
[1:24:59] i believe brother branham was god's
[1:25:00] prophet but we will not
[1:25:02] worship a man here we worship
[1:25:05] jesus christ praise the lord that's
[1:25:08] where our faith is
[1:25:10] uh our hope is in jesus christ
[1:25:13] amen so anybody come and try to i'm
[1:25:15] gonna just be honest we don't even sing
[1:25:18] songs in this church
[1:25:21] that don't glorify jesus we don't sing
[1:25:24] songs to uplift the prophet
[1:25:26] amen we said because the prophet told us
[1:25:28] he says if you read your bible
[1:25:30] i mean every scripture if you read your
[1:25:31] bible you don't see christ you need to
[1:25:33] go back and read it again
[1:25:35] amen he said the main purpose should be
[1:25:37] to glorify christ
[1:25:39] that's what we put our attention on
[1:25:40] jesus christ and what his
[1:25:42] what he has done for us amen i will re
[1:25:45] i'll quote a prophet
[1:25:47] oh hallelujah amen i i know i'm in the
[1:25:50] right spirit because the prophet prophet
[1:25:52] went to rome one time
[1:25:53] and when he went to rome they had they
[1:25:56] had an interview set up for him to go
[1:25:57] meet the pope
[1:25:58] and say yeah i would love to go meet the
[1:26:00] pope what do i have to do
[1:26:02] he says when you go you just gotta bow
[1:26:03] down and kiss his ring
[1:26:06] they say bow down and kiss his ring
[1:26:09] he said uh and when you when you walk
[1:26:11] out just
[1:26:12] walk backwards don't turn your back on
[1:26:14] the pope he says uh
[1:26:16] cancel my appointment
[1:26:20] can you imagine that you had an
[1:26:22] appointment with the pope
[1:26:24] right and you tell now the pope didn't
[1:26:26] cancel on you
[1:26:27] you canceled on the pope can you imagine
[1:26:30] somebody doing that he said cancel my
[1:26:32] appointment he says
[1:26:33] he say that is out i will not bow down
[1:26:35] to
[1:26:36] a man and kiss his ring at all if he
[1:26:38] want to be called brother
[1:26:39] if you want to be called reverend he
[1:26:41] won't this he want that i'll shake his
[1:26:42] hand but i am not bound down and kissing
[1:26:45] his ring
[1:26:46] so cancel my appointment and they
[1:26:47] canceled it too see i'll tell you what
[1:26:50] if a prophet wouldn't bow down and kiss
[1:26:52] a pope's ring
[1:26:53] and a prophet wouldn't buy it wouldn't
[1:26:55] wouldn't allow a man to be exalted in
[1:26:57] any other place
[1:26:59] hallelujah hide in christ then i believe
[1:27:01] i'm in the same spirit by saying i
[1:27:03] will not bow down and worship a prophet
[1:27:07] now you know what john tried to do that
[1:27:10] in the book of revelation
[1:27:11] john tried to do that and you know the
[1:27:13] prophet told say get up
[1:27:14] i'm of your fellow servants to brethren
[1:27:17] so you can't worship
[1:27:18] me worship god hallelujah and that's
[1:27:21] what we do here
[1:27:22] we worship god hallelujah
[1:27:27] glory to god man so don't don't get me
[1:27:30] don't get me wrong i might quote the
[1:27:32] prophet a lot but i'm not worshiping him
[1:27:34] amen my worship goes to jesus amen amen
[1:27:38] now the prophet the reason that i quote
[1:27:40] the prophet a lot is because
[1:27:42] uh it's just like in the days of moses
[1:27:44] when god gave moses
[1:27:45] a man the uh the word gaming the law as
[1:27:48] moses was taken off the scene
[1:27:50] god knew that the children of israel was
[1:27:52] going to get further and further away
[1:27:53] from what moses said
[1:27:55] as long as moses was there they stay
[1:27:57] they stayed true
[1:27:58] but as soon as moses left the scene they
[1:27:59] start getting slack even
[1:28:01] joshua's generation they got more and
[1:28:03] more slack this is why
[1:28:05] joshua had to stand before the children
[1:28:07] and say
[1:28:08] say uh uh uh uh me and my house we're
[1:28:12] gonna serve the lord
[1:28:13] right this is why joshua made that
[1:28:14] statement because the people were
[1:28:16] getting away from the word of god
[1:28:19] hallelujah our prophet's job is to bring
[1:28:21] the people back to the word of god
[1:28:23] that's what god used brother branham to
[1:28:25] do to bring us back to the word
[1:28:27] we don't worship him we will quote him
[1:28:29] to keep the people in line with what the
[1:28:30] prophet said
[1:28:32] just like joshua kept him in line with
[1:28:34] what moses said all right let's go
[1:28:35] i want to read this a spirit uh i do
[1:28:39] believe that a spirit-filled person
[1:28:41] would see it that uh he worshipped
[1:28:44] daniel
[1:28:45] it was what he did and he made an image
[1:28:47] today and he called it
[1:28:48] belshazzar he called daniel bell to
[1:28:51] cezar
[1:28:52] which was the name of his god and he
[1:28:55] made an image and forced
[1:28:56] every person to worship that image i
[1:29:00] want you to notice that the beginning of
[1:29:01] the gentiles when god dealt with them
[1:29:03] they got haughty in their heart and
[1:29:06] forced every man to worship the
[1:29:08] image of a holy man and the gentile age
[1:29:11] was issued in with that so
[1:29:13] here the gentile age is coming in like
[1:29:16] that watch this
[1:29:18] and it will go out the same way
[1:29:23] it says the same way a boycott of the
[1:29:26] mark of the beast
[1:29:27] that will force people to work worship
[1:29:30] images
[1:29:30] and to do this do the things that we've
[1:29:33] been taught that was contrary to the
[1:29:35] word of god now look at this
[1:29:36] a boycott hallelujah of the mark of the
[1:29:40] beast
[1:29:40] that will force people to worship images
[1:29:43] and
[1:29:44] to do things post and and
[1:29:47] and and and and and post things that you
[1:29:50] shouldn't post so
[1:29:50] or actually put uh hashtags in that you
[1:29:53] shouldn't put in
[1:29:54] do things that we've been taught that
[1:29:57] was contrary
[1:29:58] to the word of god
[1:30:02] brother it'll be so slick see that's why
[1:30:04] we need spiritual eyes
[1:30:06] it'll be so slick and sly until it will
[1:30:09] deceive the very elect if possible
[1:30:12] so you better purpose in your heart
[1:30:14] tonight and be filled with god's hope
[1:30:15] filled with god's holy spirit that
[1:30:17] you'll be able to discern the right and
[1:30:18] wrong thing when the proclamation is
[1:30:21] issued
[1:30:22] hallelujah i told you the spirit that
[1:30:23] was in babylon
[1:30:25] is in the world today the spirit that
[1:30:29] was in babylon was in the world today
[1:30:31] you know the hebrew boys as i was you
[1:30:32] know just meditating on the sermon and
[1:30:34] last night a brother sent me a little
[1:30:36] little clip and he said only about two
[1:30:38] or three minutes long and i said
[1:30:40] typically i don't be watching all the
[1:30:41] videos that everybody give me your phone
[1:30:43] just get inundated with so much stuff
[1:30:45] and
[1:30:45] you just can't keep up with all the
[1:30:46] information so this brother said it's
[1:30:48] just only two or three minutes i said
[1:30:50] let me watch it and as i watched it i
[1:30:53] saw all this you know they had all the
[1:30:54] people there
[1:30:55] on the video and they had the
[1:30:57] nebuchadnezzar standing there
[1:30:59] and they start playing the music and uh
[1:31:02] and
[1:31:02] and and the camera zoomed in on them
[1:31:04] hebrew boys
[1:31:05] and say all the you know they start
[1:31:07] playing the music and and as they're
[1:31:09] playing the music because the
[1:31:10] the edict was that you know if uh once
[1:31:13] you hear the music
[1:31:14] right once you hear the music then what
[1:31:16] we want you to do is bow down and
[1:31:17] worship
[1:31:18] amen this image that we just created
[1:31:21] right and uh so so here the hebrew boys
[1:31:23] are standing there
[1:31:24] and they know that they're not supposed
[1:31:26] to worship any other god but their own
[1:31:28] god
[1:31:29] right and here they're standing in a
[1:31:31] foreign land
[1:31:32] amongst foreign people not sure what
[1:31:34] would happen to them but they had a
[1:31:36] determination in their heart
[1:31:38] that they would not bow to this image
[1:31:41] and see here they standing there and and
[1:31:43] they say they say as soon as we play
[1:31:44] this music we want everybody to bow
[1:31:46] and on the video you can see everybody
[1:31:47] just falling prostrate everybody going
[1:31:50] down like dominoes they were going down
[1:31:52] but them hebrew boys were standing up
[1:31:53] their hands lifted up to god like this
[1:31:56] i said lord that right there is is is
[1:31:59] you know that's what we're coming back
[1:32:00] to this is where we have to find
[1:32:02] ourselves
[1:32:03] identified with people like that now let
[1:32:05] me tell you something when they got
[1:32:07] thrown
[1:32:07] into the fire first not only did they
[1:32:09] get thrown in and when you go back and
[1:32:11] read the scripture
[1:32:12] the hebrew boys were very important
[1:32:14] people in the kingdom
[1:32:15] they weren't just anybody's these guys
[1:32:17] were in in high
[1:32:19] uh positions of authority in the kingdom
[1:32:21] and so so
[1:32:22] so when they when they got called before
[1:32:24] amen nebuchadnezzar they said
[1:32:26] never connected and i heard that y'all
[1:32:27] wouldn't bow say i'm gonna give you
[1:32:29] another chance i'm gonna give you some
[1:32:30] grace
[1:32:31] i want you to bow when you hear the
[1:32:33] music he said look let me tell you
[1:32:35] something king
[1:32:36] he said if i said well we got a
[1:32:38] confidence that our god is
[1:32:39] able to deliver us that's our confidence
[1:32:41] i mean we ain't never seen no trial like
[1:32:43] this
[1:32:44] we never read about anybody going
[1:32:46] through anything like this but we got
[1:32:47] confidence that our god is
[1:32:49] able to deliver us but if he chooses
[1:32:52] not to deliver us we want you to know
[1:32:55] that we
[1:32:56] we we wanted to be written in your books
[1:32:58] that we did not bow
[1:33:00] to this thing that y'all set up before
[1:33:01] us nebuchadnezzar said we're gonna heat
[1:33:04] this fire up seven times harder than
[1:33:05] ever been
[1:33:06] ever ever been heated up so we we can't
[1:33:08] we can't stand to have this round
[1:33:10] heat the fire up seven times
[1:33:11] nebuchadnezzar sent men down
[1:33:13] to take the hebrew boys into the fire
[1:33:15] you know the men that
[1:33:16] they took down took the hebrew boys down
[1:33:19] those men
[1:33:19] died just by the heat of the fire
[1:33:23] his strongest men died through the
[1:33:26] hebrew boys into the fire and i love
[1:33:28] this because the prophet gives us this
[1:33:29] great
[1:33:30] picture he says when god was looking at
[1:33:32] this
[1:33:34] and heaven say wormwood stepped up said
[1:33:36] god i go out there and
[1:33:37] i'll throw some water on this fire it'll
[1:33:39] be blown out

[1:33:42] said no no no don't worry about it one
[1:33:44] more i appreciate you wanting to go and
[1:33:45] do that he said he said look at this
[1:33:47] look at this gabriel look at my boys
[1:33:48] down here look at him standing for me

[1:33:54] permission i go change
[1:33:55] i'll change the whole situation around
[1:33:56] because they standing for you i want to
[1:33:58] do something for them
[1:33:58] god said no no no no no no don't worry
[1:34:00] about it gabriel i don't need you i
[1:34:02] don't need to
[1:34:02] they say god what you're gonna do it's
[1:34:04] all i said god reached over and put on a
[1:34:06] robe
[1:34:07] he said he said i can't have y'all go
[1:34:09] because this is a god-sized job
[1:34:12] this is something that i'm gonna take
[1:34:13] care of myself they standing for me now
[1:34:15] i'm gonna stand with them
[1:34:17] and he entered as the fourth man into
[1:34:19] the fiery furnace
[1:34:21] praise god amen but notice the fourth
[1:34:24] man did not come
[1:34:25] until they got into the trial
[1:34:28] that's when they experienced amen in the
[1:34:30] presence of the fourth man
[1:34:32] is when they were in the heat of the
[1:34:33] trial sometimes you might not experience
[1:34:36] the presence of god
[1:34:36] until you're in the midst of what you're
[1:34:38] going through that's when he
[1:34:40] shows himself so strong on your behalf
[1:34:44] those those there they were just
[1:34:46] worshipping and their
[1:34:47] clothes were not burned the the the the
[1:34:50] the things that they bound with burned
[1:34:52] off but their clothes are not burned
[1:34:53] they didn't even smell smoke on them
[1:34:57] nebuchadnezzar looked down into the fire
[1:34:59] said now i thought i put three in
[1:35:01] what y'all tell me how full got in there
[1:35:04] he said the fourth one looks like the
[1:35:05] son of god
[1:35:07] brought him up out of the fire furnace
[1:35:09] fire cannot touch him this is what god
[1:35:11] can do
[1:35:11] when the boycott sets sin because the
[1:35:14] boycott was against
[1:35:16] those hebrew boys because they would not
[1:35:18] bow they wouldn't take the mark

[1:40:12] i
[1:40:13] am a christian and i won't apologize i'm
[1:40:15] not ashamed
[1:40:17] of the gospel of jesus christ right
[1:40:20] i don't hate you i love you enough to
[1:40:22] tell you the truth
[1:40:24] see it's very you know you go to church
[1:40:27] and you have to preach things like this
[1:40:28] it's not easy and i mean preacher get
[1:40:32] out here he's standing alone a lot of
[1:40:33] times we have to say things like this
[1:40:35] but it's the truth and how god still got
[1:40:37] some shad racks of meshach
[1:40:39] and some abandons on the earth that will
[1:40:42] not bow
[1:40:43] to these images all right i'm going
[1:40:45] further
[1:40:49] now i just want to ask this question
[1:40:52] could you just pull up john 3 16.
[1:40:56] because i know we got people standing on
[1:40:57] all kinds of sides
[1:40:59] but i just want to ask this question in
[1:41:01] light of scripture
[1:41:04] john 3 16 in light of scripture
[1:41:09] because i know it says this for god so
[1:41:11] loved the world
[1:41:13] that he gave his only begotten son that
[1:41:16] whosoever believeth in him
[1:41:19] should not perish but have everlasting
[1:41:22] life in light of scripture
[1:41:24] which life matters
[1:41:29] yeah everlasting life matters that's
[1:41:31] true you can you can put that out there
[1:41:33] i'm telling you he died for the whole
[1:41:35] world right so all
[1:41:36] lives matter to him praise the lord amen
[1:41:39] as a christian all life should matter
[1:41:41] all right let me go a little further
[1:41:44] nowadays we have this thing especially
[1:41:47] start
[1:41:48] you know the pandemic has wiped out
[1:41:50] sports but now they're trying to
[1:41:51] resurrect it again
[1:41:53] but in the midst of uh resurrecting it
[1:41:55] they're doing all kind of things to show
[1:41:57] their solidarity praise the lord the
[1:42:00] wnhw
[1:42:01] nba teams walked off the floor when the
[1:42:03] national anthem
[1:42:04] was being played in basketball and
[1:42:08] baseball
[1:42:09] teams have now they start kneeling
[1:42:11] during the
[1:42:12] playing of the national anthem but we
[1:42:14] also
[1:42:15] find that there are a couple people
[1:42:18] that refuse to actually kneel they stand
[1:42:20] with their hand on their heart and you
[1:42:22] know this is what kind of gets me
[1:42:24] that a man standing with his hand on his
[1:42:25] heart in honor of the flag
[1:42:27] becomes an issue why is that
[1:42:30] news to be reported why is the media
[1:42:34] picking that out
[1:42:35] and trying to present that to people to
[1:42:37] try to create a problem it creates
[1:42:39] division
[1:42:40] not unity pray for it it was never a
[1:42:44] problem
[1:42:44] six months ago it was not a problem for
[1:42:47] people to stand with their hands on
[1:42:48] their hearts
[1:42:49] and and and sing the national anthem but
[1:42:52] now if you're caught
[1:42:53] singing a national anthem or with your
[1:42:55] hand on your heart and you're not doing
[1:42:56] what everybody else doing you stand out
[1:42:57] like a sore thumb
[1:42:58] just like the hebrew boys all right
[1:43:02] one brother one of the guys in baseball
[1:43:04] that did this
[1:43:05] they asked him why he didn't do it he
[1:43:07] says uh
[1:43:09] when he was questioning said as a
[1:43:11] christian
[1:43:13] i could not bow to any other god no this
[1:43:16] happened in baseball
[1:43:17] this happened in baseball and uh and
[1:43:19] then it followed up in basketball
[1:43:21] right but he said he says as a christian
[1:43:23] this man said as a christian
[1:43:25] i could not bow to any other god that's
[1:43:28] why i didn't do it now he used the term
[1:43:30] as a christian i want y'all to watch
[1:43:32] this i'm going to go a little further
[1:43:34] as a christian i would not bow now now
[1:43:36] when he said that
[1:43:38] uh i said to myself many people may
[1:43:40] disagree with his position
[1:43:42] but i can appreciate his conviction
[1:43:49] i need to read to you all something you
[1:43:52] know black lives matter
[1:43:54] is a separate movement but there is a
[1:43:57] group
[1:43:58] behind them that actually has their own
[1:44:00] website and they got some stuff on the
[1:44:02] website that i think most christians
[1:44:03] would actually differ with
[1:44:05] black blacklivesmatter.com i want to
[1:44:08] read just from their website
[1:44:10] watch this i i said how could two walk
[1:44:13] together
[1:44:14] except they'd be agreed hashtags and
[1:44:16] everything else how you gonna do it
[1:44:18] if you ain't really studied this you
[1:44:19] don't really know what you're getting
[1:44:20] yourself in
[1:44:21] there is a spirit underneath all of this
[1:44:24] watch this
[1:44:25] it's conditioning for a boycott because
[1:44:28] as a christian
[1:44:29] if christians gonna stand up and say are
[1:44:30] we not gonna bow christians gonna stand
[1:44:32] up saying we're not gonna do this
[1:44:33] christians we're not gonna
[1:44:34] they're gonna come against the christian
[1:44:36] religion at some point in time
[1:44:39] praise the lord all right watch this
[1:44:41] look at this statement
[1:44:43] i i got it right off the website we are
[1:44:47] unapologetically black in our
[1:44:49] positioning
[1:44:50] in affirming that black lives matter we
[1:44:52] need not qualify opposition
[1:44:54] to love and desire freedom and justice
[1:44:56] for ourselves is a pre-prerequisite for
[1:44:58] wanting the same for others
[1:45:00] keep going most people get that's that's
[1:45:02] right let's keep going
[1:45:04] we see ourselves as part of the global
[1:45:06] black family and we are aware
[1:45:08] of the different ways we are impacted or
[1:45:10] privileged as black people who exist
[1:45:12] in different parts of the world people
[1:45:14] read that oh that's right that's right
[1:45:15] let's keep
[1:45:16] reading we're guided by the fact
[1:45:20] that all black lives matter regardless
[1:45:21] of actual or perceived
[1:45:24] sexual identity now why where how did
[1:45:27] this get in here
[1:45:29] watch this now where'd that come from
[1:45:31] right watch this
[1:45:32] it says we're guided by the fact
[1:45:35] that all black lives matter regardless
[1:45:38] of actual or perceived sexual identity
[1:45:42] gender identity gender expression
[1:45:46] economic status ability disability
[1:45:50] religious beliefs or disbeliefs
[1:45:54] immigration status or location let's go
[1:45:57] on we
[1:45:58] make space this is blacklivesmatter.com
[1:46:02] we make space for transgender brothers
[1:46:05] and sisters to participate and lead
[1:46:12] go a little further we are
[1:46:14] self-reflexive
[1:46:16] and do the work required to dismantle
[1:46:20] dismantle cisgender privilege and uplift
[1:46:23] black trans folk
[1:46:26] especially black trans women who
[1:46:29] continue to be dis
[1:46:30] disproportionately impacted by trans
[1:46:34] antagonistic violence
[1:46:37] now there's a homosexual agenda in all
[1:46:40] these words
[1:46:42] that they're promoting underneath
[1:46:45] black lives matters
[1:46:49] a homosexual agenda that goes completely
[1:46:52] against
[1:46:53] what we as christians believe to be
[1:46:55] right in the word of god
[1:46:57] but yet we hashtag it all the time watch
[1:47:00] this i'm going further
[1:47:03] we build a space that affirms black
[1:47:07] women and is free from
[1:47:09] sexism misogyny
[1:47:13] and environments in which men are
[1:47:15] centered
[1:47:16] uh oh now i want you to watch that word
[1:47:20] misogyny
[1:47:22] because that's defined as being a woman
[1:47:24] hater
[1:47:26] and it's found in certain religious sex
[1:47:29] so you know when they read things about
[1:47:32] what paul wrote
[1:47:33] can we just pull up the scripture in
[1:47:34] first timothy too i'm just i'm reading
[1:47:36] the bible
[1:47:38] i'm reading the bible right now when we
[1:47:40] read the bible
[1:47:41] what paul wrote you know they actually
[1:47:43] changed these things in scripture this
[1:47:44] is why we
[1:47:45] we got rid of the king james version and
[1:47:47] we're using other scriptures that
[1:47:48] actually are more
[1:47:49] inclusive watch those words this is the
[1:47:53] devil
[1:47:54] this is the devil behind all this look
[1:47:55] at this now as a christian
[1:47:57] i read this in the bible and i choose to
[1:48:00] believe what i see in the bible
[1:48:02] first timothy chapter 2 verse 12 says
[1:48:04] but i suffer
[1:48:05] not a woman to teach nor to usurp
[1:48:09] authority over the man
[1:48:11] but to be in silence now that's in your
[1:48:12] bible that's in your bible
[1:48:14] for adam was first formed then even adam
[1:48:16] was not deceived but the woman being
[1:48:18] deceived was in the transgression
[1:48:19] now this was the reason that women were
[1:48:21] not able to preach because of what paul
[1:48:23] wrote in scripture of what happened in
[1:48:25] the garden of eden
[1:48:26] when eve got deceived that's what
[1:48:28] actually eliminated her ability to be
[1:48:31] able
[1:48:31] to preach it wasn't it wasn't somebody
[1:48:35] trying to put a thumb on women it's just
[1:48:37] this is what god established
[1:48:39] from the very beginning and we're trying
[1:48:41] to hold on to everything god said
[1:48:43] now you know what this new movement that
[1:48:45] has these underlying tones
[1:48:47] says they're you know they want to uh
[1:48:49] they want to free people from misogyny
[1:48:54] and what do you think misogyny is found
[1:48:56] with people
[1:48:57] that believe scripture
[1:49:01] the boycott is coming to you
[1:49:06] if you still believe scripture
[1:49:09] the boycott is coming to you right be
[1:49:13] careful because you've been conditioned
[1:49:14] for something that you don't even
[1:49:16] realize
[1:49:16] but the good news about this when it
[1:49:18] turns
[1:49:19] because i'm standing just like the
[1:49:21] hebrew boy stood i'm standing the way
[1:49:23] daniel stood down there before he went
[1:49:25] into the lion i'm standing the same way
[1:49:28] god delivered daniel god delivered the
[1:49:30] hebrew voice
[1:49:31] that same god is gonna deliver his pride
[1:49:34] in this hour let me just read
[1:49:40] questions and answers part two i want to
[1:49:43] show you these spirits
[1:49:44] church and i want you to understand that
[1:49:45] this is a spiritual battle that we're in
[1:49:47] this is not a natural battle
[1:49:50] uh you we we we allow these things to
[1:49:52] kind of catch us in our emotions but
[1:49:54] there's a spirit underneath this
[1:49:56] that is driving us to places that we
[1:49:57] never thought that we would be going
[1:50:00] even as christians
[1:50:03] god help us to remain true to the word
[1:50:04] of god
[1:50:06] questions and answers i want to say this
[1:50:09] here as i've often
[1:50:10] said i believe in the church here
[1:50:12] there's a role
[1:50:14] here like and here lives mortal beings
[1:50:17] and he's talking about where we're
[1:50:18] living at right now
[1:50:19] there's this there's a there's a above
[1:50:21] world there's spirits from an above
[1:50:22] world and their spirits from underneath
[1:50:24] the world
[1:50:24] and we're in the middle of it so even
[1:50:27] when you look at a scripture say god so
[1:50:28] loved the world
[1:50:29] that he gave his only begotten son's
[1:50:30] like what world that god love i can tell
[1:50:32] you it's that world that's above that
[1:50:33] heavenly atmosphere
[1:50:35] because this world that we're in right
[1:50:36] now this is a sinful world god don't
[1:50:38] love it god gonna judge this world
[1:50:41] god gonna judge this world but there are
[1:50:43] some people caught
[1:50:44] in this world that he died for he needs
[1:50:46] them to know
[1:50:47] that he loves them watch this
[1:50:51] in here lives immortal beings and each
[1:50:53] one is in this great conglomeration of
[1:50:55] getty of blackness and darkness
[1:50:57] mortals living here now they are influen
[1:51:00] they're either influenced from this away
[1:51:02] or from that away as you read the media
[1:51:05] as you read the news
[1:51:06] let me tell you you're being influenced
[1:51:07] from one way or the other as you read
[1:51:09] the word of god i can already tell you
[1:51:11] where your influence is coming from
[1:51:12] your influence is coming from heaven
[1:51:15] stay with the word
[1:51:17] you cannot be here a spiritual being
[1:51:20] sinner or saint
[1:51:21] without having an influence from the
[1:51:24] underworld or from the above world
[1:51:27] if you're influenced from here you're
[1:51:30] from above your celestial body is
[1:51:32] waiting up here
[1:51:33] but if you're wicked and hypocritical
[1:51:35] and indifferent your celestial body is
[1:51:36] down here
[1:51:37] regardless of how much you think is up
[1:51:40] there because the fruit that you
[1:51:42] bear before people proves where you're
[1:51:44] from
[1:51:46] so you are here what you are somewhere
[1:51:49] else
[1:51:49] your life that you live here is just
[1:51:51] reflecting what your inheritance is
[1:51:53] when you leave here do you understand
[1:51:55] and all i'm saying here church is
[1:51:57] ultimately people are being conditioned
[1:52:00] to fulfill a prophecy
[1:52:03] they don't realize it but they're
[1:52:04] stepping right into
[1:52:06] a vision they're stepping right into
[1:52:09] what god told
[1:52:10] a prophet to pick up his pen and write
[1:52:12] about they're stepping right into it and
[1:52:14] don't realize it they're being
[1:52:15] conditioned
[1:52:16] be careful what you align yourself with
[1:52:19] be careful what you're lying stuff
[1:52:21] align yourself with the word of god
[1:52:25] amen god will god will stand for you
[1:52:28] if you'll stand for him i remember a
[1:52:31] story that brother branham told us
[1:52:34] about this evangelist that was on earth
[1:52:37] and
[1:52:38] man did a great work for the lord but
[1:52:40] when he got to heaven um
[1:52:44] he was told that he couldn't go in
[1:52:47] and he says oh mom i'm i'm evangelist
[1:52:50] so-and-so and i did this and i did that
[1:52:52] it was like yeah i realized it but he
[1:52:53] said your name is not on the list and
[1:52:55] you can't go in
[1:52:56] it's like what i can't go in he says uh
[1:52:58] he says there anything i can do he says
[1:53:00] oh yeah you can make your appeal
[1:53:01] you can make your appeal to the great
[1:53:03] white throne judgment
[1:53:04] and he says okay uh i'll make my appeal.
[1:53:08] and it says um it says he went over
[1:53:10] there and
[1:53:11] went stood in line waited the white
[1:53:13] great great white throne judgment and he
[1:53:15] said
[1:53:15] he heard the voice of god call his name
[1:53:17] and say did you ever steal while you on
[1:53:19] earth
[1:53:20] it says he thought he thought for sure
[1:53:23] that he had never stole
[1:53:24] on earth but but when he was in the
[1:53:26] presence of that great light he said he
[1:53:28] realized he'd done some things that he
[1:53:30] shouldn't have done
[1:53:30] he said yeah yeah i stole say uh
[1:53:33] so and so did you uh did you ever lie
[1:53:37] while you on earth it says oh i thought
[1:53:39] i'd never lie
[1:53:40] but when i when i got that great
[1:53:42] presence i realized that i
[1:53:44] i worked some shady deals and i lied i
[1:53:47] i i realized i i was done
[1:53:51] he said yeah i lied you know while i was
[1:53:54] on earth
[1:53:54] they asked him another question about
[1:53:56] something that he did you know while he
[1:53:57] was on earth he's like
[1:53:58] they thought for sure i don't think i
[1:53:59] ever did that i oh
[1:54:02] i said man i'm guilty of everything that
[1:54:04] they just
[1:54:05] asked me they say stood there before the
[1:54:08] the
[1:54:08] the presence of god at the great white
[1:54:10] throne judgment and then he heard a
[1:54:11] a voice just come out of nowhere and he
[1:54:13] said father
[1:54:16] father on earth this man stood for me he
[1:54:20] preached my gospel he he
[1:54:22] held to my truth he he did the best he
[1:54:24] could with what i had
[1:54:25] he says on on earth this man stood for
[1:54:29] me
[1:54:30] he says but now in heaven i want to
[1:54:33] stand
[1:54:34] for him see we we
[1:54:38] we need a god that's going to show up
[1:54:39] and be on our side when it really
[1:54:41] matters most
[1:54:42] i'm going to tell you what we're going
[1:54:44] through on this earth it don't matter
[1:54:45] because there's a life
[1:54:46] after this and we have to live for the
[1:54:50] life that's coming after this
[1:54:51] that life that we're living must be a
[1:54:54] life that's patterned
[1:54:56] with the word of god stand
[1:55:00] for the word we've been conditioned
[1:55:02] watch these spirits
[1:55:04] watch every movement because there's a
[1:55:06] spirit behind the movement
[1:55:08] i i i even watch where you know
[1:55:10] different saints just
[1:55:12] you know we get into arguments over
[1:55:14] these things that's a
[1:55:15] devil causing us to argue it's a devil
[1:55:18] that makes us do that
[1:55:20] right that's not the spirit of god you
[1:55:22] cannot say that's the spirit of god
[1:55:25] i'm gonna educate so and so educate for
[1:55:28] what
[1:55:29] educate for this world is not our home
[1:55:33] amen there i can tell you this right now
[1:55:35] it will never get better in this
[1:55:37] life until people come to a place of
[1:55:39] repentance
[1:55:41] if they can't come to christ they'll
[1:55:43] never be free from these things
[1:55:45] so just be one movement after the next
[1:55:47] movement and those movements will be
[1:55:49] tied
[1:55:50] and i'ma say this because this is what
[1:55:51] the lord told me
[1:55:53] being born a particular
[1:55:56] color is not a sin
[1:56:02] i'ma say that again being born
[1:56:05] a particular color no matter what color
[1:56:08] you are
[1:56:08] being born that color is not sin
[1:56:12] it is very natural
[1:56:15] but the homosexual agenda is sinful
[1:56:18] in god's eyes so i don't care how much
[1:56:21] people try to equate it
[1:56:23] it cannot be equated because in god's
[1:56:26] eyes one is a sin
[1:56:28] amen
[1:56:37] this last quote i want to read maybe
[1:56:39] last two and i'll close here
[1:56:41] do you now believe do you not believe
[1:56:44] the prophet makes a statement here in
[1:56:45] this message do you now but
[1:56:47] now believe
[1:56:56] he says and he's talking about when he
[1:56:59] went to finland and he prayed for these
[1:57:01] two boys and one
[1:57:02] both of them lived one was they were in
[1:57:04] a terrible accident god
[1:57:05] showed him years ago how this one boy
[1:57:07] was going to be raised from the dead he
[1:57:08] didn't show him where it was going to
[1:57:09] happen
[1:57:10] but it happened in finland it just gave
[1:57:12] him the vision and he saw
[1:57:13] saw they saw this boy race from the dead
[1:57:15] but when he got there god didn't show
[1:57:16] them that another boy was in the
[1:57:17] accident
[1:57:18] parents would call and said we saw you
[1:57:20] raise that other boy from the dead what
[1:57:21] about our boy he was in the hospital
[1:57:23] probably i don't know what to do i don't
[1:57:24] know what to do he said please you gotta
[1:57:26] pray for our boy so i'm just waiting on
[1:57:27] the lord i'm waiting on the word from
[1:57:28] the lord and
[1:57:29] god showed him so if you eat this this
[1:57:31] candy
[1:57:32] i'll raise that boy from the dead if you
[1:57:34] would do this i'd do that
[1:57:35] so so sometimes we have to stand in the
[1:57:37] gap and do things for others
[1:57:38] in order for them to receive life uh
[1:57:40] here the prophet you know
[1:57:42] it was was referring to this in the
[1:57:43] squad he says the other little lad
[1:57:45] i just haven't the time to catch that
[1:57:48] i will tomorrow night on what happened
[1:57:50] to the other little lad i remember one
[1:57:52] thing
[1:57:52] i would have time the second night from
[1:57:54] then i seen something sweet happen
[1:57:56] i was going into a place and coming down
[1:57:58] the road city uh six city blocks now
[1:58:01] where in finland also there was uh the
[1:58:03] russians and the finlands
[1:58:04] they were they were against one another
[1:58:06] there was some tremendous division
[1:58:08] in their midst but what brother brown is
[1:58:10] bringing out here is that
[1:58:11] when the power of god moved there were
[1:58:13] some russian soldiers that were there
[1:58:15] watching that boy raised from the dead
[1:58:17] they would finish people on one side
[1:58:19] russians on the other side when they saw
[1:58:21] that boy rise from the dead they say
[1:58:23] those those finish
[1:58:24] finish people and russian people just
[1:58:26] begin to embrace one another
[1:58:28] people just want to see a real god
[1:58:30] that's what lets down the walls when
[1:58:32] people see a real god
[1:58:34] look at this it says i seen something
[1:58:36] sweet happened
[1:58:37] i was going into the place and coming
[1:58:39] down the road for city blocks
[1:58:40] there was about 30 30 abreast
[1:58:43] and people standing in russia you can't
[1:58:45] leave your home
[1:58:47] place where you're born with over 40
[1:58:49] miles you can't even go 40 miles from
[1:58:50] your house
[1:58:51] right in russia that's what he was
[1:58:52] saying at that time and it says uh
[1:58:54] without having a visa
[1:58:56] says now when they tell you there's no
[1:58:58] churches in russia
[1:59:00] that's wrong he says they got churches
[1:59:04] they they got the communist boy the
[1:59:07] communists
[1:59:07] boycott them and everything but they
[1:59:10] still got christians
[1:59:12] glory to god like this look at look at
[1:59:14] this statement what if you killed
[1:59:16] all the christians out of america you'd
[1:59:18] have
[1:59:19] no america
[1:59:22] same way in russia i'm gonna tell you if
[1:59:25] america want to stay america
[1:59:27] we christians gonna have to stay here do
[1:59:28] you realize that as christians we
[1:59:30] actually hold off the
[1:59:32] the judgment of god sometime just by
[1:59:35] being here god won't allow it to come
[1:59:36] because you're here
[1:59:38] oh that is powerful you actually hold
[1:59:42] back the judgment of
[1:59:43] god sometimes judgment would strike if
[1:59:45] the christians were not around
[1:59:48] sometimes your family be in a worse
[1:59:50] situation if it was not for you
[1:59:53] we don't realize the authority we had as
[1:59:55] believers
[1:59:57] but one day he's coming to take us home
[1:59:59] and then all
[2:00:03] all all hell will truly turn loose at
[2:00:06] that time
[2:00:06] praise god but we won't have to deal
[2:00:08] with it let me go back to this i'm
[2:00:10] bringing back the end of this
[2:00:12] quote this is out of programming church
[2:00:14] age
[2:00:15] uh just take me right to paragraph 175-2
[2:00:18] and we'll finish it right here this is
[2:00:21] the prophecy
[2:00:22] the people don't realize that angel that
[2:00:26] told brother branham pick up your pen
[2:00:27] and write was writing a prophecy even
[2:00:29] for this day
[2:00:30] and if people don't realize that we're
[2:00:31] moving in the midst of it with
[2:00:33] all the things that are happening around
[2:00:35] us we don't realize we're moving right
[2:00:37] into the midst of a prophecy
[2:00:39] where we can't buy or sell because we
[2:00:41] won't take the mark
[2:00:42] because we're protesting we're standing
[2:00:44] against amen denominational teachings
[2:00:47] and
[2:00:47] and catholic teachers we're standing
[2:00:49] against that the great taught this
[2:00:50] but
[2:00:51] the great actually had children
[2:00:53] harlots the bible speaks that
[2:00:54] we stand against that we will not accept
[2:00:56] that we only stay with the word of god
[2:00:58] just like the hebrew voice look at this
[2:01:01] i believe according to
[2:01:03] revelation 13 16 the bride will have to
[2:01:06] stop preaching
[2:01:07] for the beast is demanding the mark in
[2:01:09] the hand or forehead
[2:01:10] if permission to preach to be granted
[2:01:13] denominations will take the mark
[2:01:16] or be forced to quit preaching i love
[2:01:19] this
[2:01:20] then the lamb will come for his bride
[2:01:23] and judge the great harlot so as the
[2:01:26] the pressure comes as the squeeze comes
[2:01:29] we have something to look forward to
[2:01:30] our our lord is coming to take us home
[2:01:34] this world is not a home it says i go to
[2:01:37] prepare a place for you
[2:01:38] that where i am you may be also
[2:01:42] i'm looking forward to that church i
[2:01:44] don't know about you but i'm on the
[2:01:45] expectation
[2:01:47] that i'll be going home someday soon
[2:01:50] praise god shall we pray
[2:01:56] dear god lord just a
[2:02:00] thought that you've given me to what
[2:02:01] conditioning for
[2:02:03] the boycott it's prophesied according to
[2:02:06] the book of revelation 13.
[2:02:09] ordering just some of the things that we
[2:02:11] see in our world today god is
[2:02:14] certainly conditioning people and they
[2:02:16] don't even understand what's going on
[2:02:18] there's a spirit of underlying spirit
[2:02:20] behind all of this oh god and
[2:02:23] lord i just prayed it as believers that
[2:02:26] we could
[2:02:26] catch the vision your vision of what you
[2:02:30] have for us lord not get so wrapped up
[2:02:32] and caught up
[2:02:33] things that's where you told us to love
[2:02:35] not the world or the things of the world
[2:02:38] he said if we did then the love of god
[2:02:39] would not be in us
[2:02:41] lord we're gonna love you and we're
[2:02:44] gonna demonstrate and show your love to
[2:02:45] others
[2:02:46] we'll be bold enough to be able to tell
[2:02:48] people that no that's wrong
[2:02:50] that's wrong that's not what god is
[2:02:52] pleased with god destroyed sodom and
[2:02:54] gomorrh
[2:02:55] for some of this and i i recall your
[2:02:57] prophet even telling us that
[2:02:59] if god does not destroy
[2:03:02] the us or even the world today for the
[2:03:05] same sins
[2:03:07] that were committed in sodom and
[2:03:08] gomorrah then he would have to raise up
[2:03:10] sodom gomorrah and apologize to them
[2:03:13] forever doing it the lord because you're
[2:03:15] just god
[2:03:17] because you're a righteous god we
[2:03:20] realize judgment is on the way it's
[2:03:22] actually already begun and
[2:03:24] people don't even realize it god but as
[2:03:26] christians help us as the bride of
[2:03:28] christ help us to recognize
[2:03:31] lord what you've called us to in this
[2:03:32] hour not to be ashamed of the gospel
[2:03:37] for it is power unto salvation
[2:03:41] to everyone that we believe
[2:03:44] god we want to just stay with the word
[2:03:48] that's what we want to do keep our eyes
[2:03:52] mine our heart on the word
[2:03:55] that's what matters most the word is
[2:03:57] what changes just the word is what
[2:03:58] transforms it

[2:04:02] do what the word
[2:04:04] has done and will continue to do

[2:11:20] just that much we realize
[2:11:22] that because of the sin that we're in
[2:11:24] that the world is in god that you do
[2:11:25] have to try to get people's attention
[2:11:27] and
[2:11:27] sometimes it comes through pandemic
[2:11:30] sometimes it comes through great storms
[2:11:32] uh god it comes to all kind of ways amen
[2:11:35] you try to get people's attention
[2:11:36] you got jonah's attention and a great
[2:11:38] storm lord you can get others that might
[2:11:41] be running from your presence and doing
[2:11:42] other things you can get their attention
[2:11:44] in a great storm not that you god you
[2:11:47] send it but you certainly allow
[2:11:49] all these things to happen for purpose
[2:11:50] and for reason you can stop it but you
