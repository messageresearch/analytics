[52:08] revelations chapter 19 verse 7 it's good

[52:21] morning so we just want to make you all
[52:22] welcome I want to speak on this morning
[52:26] by the grace of God make preparation
[52:30] make preparation so revelation 19 verse
[52:36] 7 says this let us be glad and rejoice
[52:40] and give honor unto Him for the marriage
[52:43] of the lamb has come and his wife hath
[52:47] made herself ready and his wife has made
[52:53] herself ready may the Lord at his
[52:55] blessing to the reading his word this
[52:57] morning you can have your seats now he
[53:01] says this the prophet of God says this
[53:03] the hour has come his bride has made
[53:06] herself ready Oh made herself ready
[53:10] she laid aside all the things remember
[53:13] Esther was chosen and the others was
[53:16] rejected and only those that's born
[53:18] again that's got the Spirit of God will
[53:21] be chosen that day that the crown of
[53:23] glory will be set upon her head and all
[53:26] others will be rejected my so what he's
[53:31] saying here is the selected the one that
[53:34] has been elected and selected by
[53:36] Almighty God that clean-living little
[53:39] lady that's put on the robes of his
[53:41] righteousness not anything that she
[53:43] could offer him is that right
[53:45] we know that Cain tried that very same
[53:47] thing he tried to bring his fruit he
[53:50] tried to do it his way
[53:51] and we find that many churches are doing
[53:53] that today they're saying God we're
[53:55] gonna serve you our way friends it don't
[53:58] work that way you've got to come
[54:00] God provided way and we know that that's
[54:02] through Christ and Christ is the word
[54:05] you can only come Christ's way amen the
[54:11] way of the word let's just turn in our
[54:13] Bibles this warning to Matthew 25 very
[54:16] very familiar passage of Scripture
[54:20] nonetheless it's very very beautiful
[54:24] Matthew 25 verse 1 then shall the
[54:32] Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten
[54:34] virgins which took the lamp and went
[54:36] forth to meet the bridegroom in front
[54:39] and five excuse me five of them were
[54:41] wise and five foolish and they that were
[54:44] foolish took their lamps and took no oil
[54:46] with them but the wise took oil in their
[54:49] vessels with their lamps while the
[54:52] bridegroom tarried they all slumbered
[54:54] and slept and at midnight now notice it
[54:58] was at midnight there was a cry made
[55:00] behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out
[55:04] to meet him then all those virgins arose
[55:07] and trimmed their lamps and the foolish
[55:09] said unto wise give us of your oil for
[55:12] our lamps have gone out but the wise
[55:15] answered saying not so lest there be not
[55:18] enough for us and you but go ye rather
[55:23] to them that sell and buy for yourselves
[55:26] and while they went to buy the
[55:28] bridegroom came and then and and they
[55:32] that were ready went in with him to the
[55:34] marriage and the door was shut afterward
[55:38] came also the other virgin saying Lord
[55:40] Lord open to us but he answered and said
[55:44] verily I say unto you I know you not
[55:47] watch therefore for you know for you
[55:51] know neither free I'm sorry
[55:55] what watch therefore for you know
[55:57] neither the day nor the hour wherein the
[56:00] Son of man cometh so our subject manner
[56:05] this morning is be prepared
[56:08] now in this parable Jesus is talking to
[56:12] two different groups of people is that
[56:14] right he's talking to two different
[56:15] churches no doubt the one was a good
[56:18] living lady the Bible says she was a
[56:19] virgin she had received through the
[56:21] world in the things of the world she was
[56:24] brother Brandon was very clear he said
[56:25] she's a clean living lady so he's
[56:27] talking to two different groups here no
[56:30] doubt good I want to get that through
[56:32] your mind this morning she was good she
[56:34] was a girl right but friends she had
[56:37] something lacking in her life she was
[56:40] lacking something she was lacking that
[56:42] token that would take her from here and
[56:44] get her to there although she was good
[56:46] she was lacking the oil and we all fully
[56:48] understand that the oil is the typify
[56:50] does the Holy Ghost is that right so
[56:53] although she was good she didn't go all
[56:55] the way in with God and received the
[56:57] baptism but the Holy Ghost in her life
[57:01] friends without the Holy Ghost
[57:04] without that token without the new birth
[57:06] without being adopted sons and daughters
[57:08] of God you stay right here and go
[57:10] through the tribulation that's all there
[57:12] is do you say brother Joel that's
[57:14] awfully hard preaching my friend's dad
[57:15] is none other than but the Word of God
[57:18] there was one that God laughed friends I
[57:21] pray with all of my heart this morning
[57:22] that I'm talking to a group of people
[57:24] the heeding the call of God in your life
[57:26] if you've not made that decision if
[57:28] you've not gone all the way in with
[57:30] Christ do it now while you still have a
[57:32] chance while there's still breath in
[57:36] your body you have a chance to serve
[57:37] Almighty God you know I grew up in this
[57:41] message my great-grandparents were
[57:46] message believers my grandpa's my
[57:48] parents raised me in church some of the
[57:51] same church meetings of brother Jack was
[57:53] in I was in as a young man didn't know
[57:56] brother Jack then he didn't know me you
[57:58] know probably literally thousands of
[57:59] people back then but you know what that
[58:01] did for me it made me a good boy I'm not
[58:04] saying that it made me a real good boy
[58:06] but that wasn't good enough at that
[58:07] point in my life I was foolish virgin at
[58:10] best foolish virgin the best but when I
[58:13] was 20 years old the Lord Jesus Christ
[58:15] dropped down into my car where I was I
[58:17] wasn't looking for God he
[58:19] was looking for me he says you're my and
[58:21] you're not going down that path anymore
[58:22] Joel you're gonna serve me from this day
[58:25] forward now I'd like to tell you from
[58:26] that day forward I never send another
[58:28] day in my life
[58:29] I'm glad like to tell you I never made a
[58:31] mistake I never did nothing wrong but
[58:33] that means that'd be a lie you know why
[58:35] cuz we're still in flesh we're still in
[58:38] Tabernacles the flesh that are never
[58:39] born again when you live here you don't
[58:41] take that with you
[58:43] aren't you glad you don't oh my you've
[58:46] got a glorified body one like it under
[58:48] his old body man that ought to do
[58:52] something for us glory to God a word
[58:55] body one was wise one was foolish
[59:01] although a good person so many people
[59:04] tell you today I'm a northerner I had a
[59:14] brother introduced me one time he says
[59:16] if you ever never seen a ganky this is
[59:18] what they look like and he pointed at me
[59:19] I felt that we're all brothers and
[59:23] sisters you know the foot of the cross
[59:24] is level when we get there friends I'm
[59:26] gonna be with you you're gonna be there
[59:28] with me we're gonna be with all the
[59:30] saints globally from every Church age
[59:33] all the way down through in that right
[59:35] hey man
[59:37] and at that point we can all say that we
[59:39] came from the mind of God there was not
[59:41] some geological place we came from here
[59:43] we're up do we have eternal
[59:45] representation we were with him in the
[59:47] beginning and if I was with him then
[59:49] I've got to go back so the Bible says
[59:58] that Christ bride has made herself ready
[1:00:01] you understand there's something you've
[1:00:02] got to do you've got to do something
[1:00:05] the bride has made herself ready now I
[1:00:10] love the story that he tells about the
[1:00:12] armoire company you're familiar with the
[1:00:14] story the rich man from Chicago his
[1:00:16] daddy owned all these different ranches
[1:00:19] and things like that and this young man
[1:00:21] he come of age and he was quite frankly
[1:00:24] seeking a wife and he wanted somebody
[1:00:27] that reflected his innermost being
[1:00:30] somebody that would be like him
[1:00:32] have his same values have his same goals
[1:00:35] somebody that would raise his children
[1:00:37] in a christ-like manner somebody that
[1:00:40] would have that token applied over her
[1:00:42] door and there would be us a soldier
[1:00:44] with him and work alongside of him so he
[1:00:47] goes on this journey he goes on this
[1:00:50] search he says I've got to find her if
[1:00:52] God put this yearning inside of me she's
[1:00:54] out there somewhere so I'm going to look
[1:00:56] for he goes out west and they knew he
[1:00:59] was coming they knew he was coming to
[1:01:02] look for his wife and boy they all
[1:01:04] dressed stopping oh my back in the Old
[1:01:07] West and they oh brother Branham says
[1:01:09] that they just really had their six
[1:01:11] shooters on their sides and the ladies
[1:01:13] hall painted their faces and did all
[1:01:15] these things and look just like the
[1:01:17] world and tried to attract this boy
[1:01:20] because he was rich he said to himself
[1:01:26] not gonna have this back in Chicago I
[1:01:28] didn't come looking for that he was
[1:01:31] walking the streets of the town one day
[1:01:33] and he sees this little girl come out of
[1:01:36] the back of the place dressed in rags
[1:01:38] she was an orphan there was nothing to
[1:01:41] look upon her her visit she would say oh
[1:01:44] she's beautiful
[1:01:45] oh man that's the one that Hill for sure
[1:01:48] pick she's an orphan she couldn't say
[1:01:50] that my daddy owns this and my mama has
[1:01:53] such a social standing or anything like
[1:01:55] that she comes out with the wash water
[1:01:57] dishpan hands maybe water downer that's
[1:02:01] how I get when I'm washing dishes just
[1:02:02] water done just wetting and she walks
[1:02:05] out with that pot of dirty dishwater and
[1:02:08] she throws it out something caught his
[1:02:10] eye so whoo that's what I'm looking for
[1:02:13] somebody that's not afraid to just get
[1:02:15] down and dirty in life and to raise a
[1:02:18] family and to ratio now something that's
[1:02:20] worried about breaking oh we gotta have
[1:02:23] a nanny that's not what he was looking
[1:02:25] for he was looking for real true
[1:02:28] character and character real truth

[1:02:33] wanted a lady that would rule his home
[1:02:35] well the next day he didn't say anything

[1:09:12] stuff's called yeah he even wore that
[1:09:14] because he wants to look good all
[1:09:16] dressed up in his rental tux he don't
[1:09:18] even realize that half the pictures he
[1:09:20] ain't even
[1:09:20] be in but there he stands ready
[1:09:26] everything's completely ready the the
[1:09:28] piano player the sisters and different
[1:09:31] ones are softly playing the wedding
[1:09:34] music and everything is in order
[1:09:38] but it's time for the bride to enter the
[1:09:40] building but think about this maybe she
[1:09:44] didn't prepare maybe she didn't prepare
[1:09:47] for this wedding maybe she slept in that
[1:09:49] day and comes to the church with her
[1:09:52] hair just sticking up every which
[1:09:53] direction that's kind of a style
[1:09:54] nowadays but it shouldn't be her hair
[1:09:57] just sticking up everywhere she's
[1:09:59] wearing an old jeans skirt that looks
[1:10:01] like she slept in the thing and a
[1:10:02] t-shirt maybe on backwards and oh what
[1:10:05] sneakers look like she walked on top of
[1:10:07] him that walked in him and shows up at
[1:10:09] the back of the church in town don't it
[1:10:11] on they open the doors
[1:10:12] and there she see his popping bubble up
[1:10:17] she didn't come prepared know that boys
[1:10:22] standing here may hate me presented his
[1:10:24] best he's got a place to take her he
[1:10:27] done worked hard everybody every bit of
[1:10:29] money that he's made the last six months
[1:10:32] is going to prepare a home for her and
[1:10:34] to put everything in it that he thinks
[1:10:36] she likes he's gonna find out shortly
[1:10:37] that there's some things that he missed
[1:10:39] I missed a can opener I thought I had it
[1:10:44] all I had two forks I had two knives I
[1:10:47] had two spoons where she can't hurt me
[1:10:51] she's like but he's done everything and
[1:10:58] here she comes maybe he begins to think
[1:11:00] to himself what kind of home I thought I
[1:11:04] knew her what cut if she didn't prepare
[1:11:07] this for me she didn't prepare any
[1:11:09] better for me how's she gonna care for
[1:11:11] my children
[1:11:12] what kind of wifey what kind of soulmate
[1:11:14] is she gonna be how is it gonna be our
[1:11:17] life together because you understand
[1:11:19] marriages till death do we part and that
[1:11:22] vow binds you to one another forever
[1:11:26] that's what he said
[1:11:32] he's gonna think what am I getting
[1:11:36] myself into what am I doing here if she
[1:11:39] didn't prepare but no he wants to see
[1:11:42] her in that gown I'll never forget I've
[1:11:44] been married almost 16 years
[1:11:45] my oldest son Jonathan sitting here with
[1:11:47] me today my traveling buddy I'll never
[1:11:50] forget the day that they open that door
[1:11:53] now you may look at my wife use most
[1:11:55] most of you've seen her you may look
[1:11:57] here and say well that's just sister see
[1:11:58] whatever you know 36 year old lady
[1:12:00] whatever three children but when I see
[1:12:03] her when I see her I see her the day I
[1:12:09] did on our wedding day I see when that
[1:12:12] door opened and I saw the most beautiful
[1:12:14] thing I've ever seen in my life and I
[1:12:16] can say like she's not even here I'm a
[1:12:17] trying to flatter the most beautiful
[1:12:19] thing I ever seen in my life they opened
[1:12:21] that double doors and there stood her
[1:12:22] daddy one of my best friends loved
[1:12:24] brother John Stephen he's gone to be
[1:12:25] with the Lord now but though I see her
[1:12:29] that way and you know Jesus Christ sees
[1:12:32] you that way like he did at the very
[1:12:35] beginning of time before time ever began
[1:12:37] before the foundation of the world is
[1:12:39] that right you were with him amen
[1:12:47] now the Bible is very clear what kind of
[1:12:51] a bride the Christ is gonna come back
[1:12:53] for when he returns it's very clear what
[1:12:56] type of a lady was she will be in how
[1:12:58] she will be dressed and how she adorns
[1:13:00] herself she loves him therefore she is
[1:13:03] obedient to his word no denomination no
[1:13:06] preacher no friend no family member no
[1:13:08] child can convince her to leave this
[1:13:11] word she is abiding by every word that
[1:13:17] God spoke is that right not compromising
[1:13:20] on any part of it you see when you
[1:13:22] compromise on the Word of God now listen
[1:13:25] to me when you compromise on the Word of
[1:13:27] God you take away the fact of the word
[1:13:30] in your life you can't just obey part of
[1:13:33] it you've got it
[1:13:34] the whole book John a type of the bride
[1:13:37] a revelation tan he was to take not just
[1:13:40] the parts of the book that he wanted he
[1:13:43] said take the book and eat it up in
[1:13:45] friends it was an open book it was
[1:13:47] revealed is that right let me say it
[1:13:50] like this a hybrid word cannot produce
[1:13:53] the Bride of Christ I've had so many
[1:13:56] tell me how many people tell me that
[1:13:58] they just didn't think that God meant
[1:14:00] what he said in his word friends that's
[1:14:02] sad jesus said I will have a bride this
[1:14:05] without spot or wrinkle her sins washed
[1:14:08] completely away in the depths of his of
[1:14:11] the depths of the sea friends in his
[1:14:14] friend and his forgetfulness you know he
[1:14:16] cannot even reveal your sin was forgiven
[1:14:20] he cannot even reveal your sin to his
[1:14:22] prophet he can't there was a little girl
[1:14:25] one time going through the Prophet the
[1:14:27] prayer line and man she'd been going
[1:14:29] behind her mom and dad's back smoking
[1:14:30] cigarettes and she didn't want her mama
[1:14:32] to know that what kid does is doing
[1:14:35] things like that and uh she sees the
[1:14:38] discernment take place and and brother
[1:14:40] Brandon begins to tell the person in
[1:14:42] front of her all about her life and she
[1:14:44] says oh my oh my is for him to tell mom
[1:14:48] in this little church what I've been
[1:14:49] doing so she kind of repents in her
[1:14:51] heart dear Jesus please forgive me I
[1:14:54] don't ever want to do that no more God
[1:14:56] please forgive me you know what you
[1:14:58] stood before the Prophet it was gone he
[1:15:01] never once brought it up you know why
[1:15:02] because he can't it is gone friends
[1:15:06] that's a revelation I talked to a man
[1:15:08] one time and he believed in God he
[1:15:10] believed thing you know on his level he
[1:15:12] believed things pretty good but he told
[1:15:14] me because I'm trying to get him to come
[1:15:16] to church and man it seemed like he was
[1:15:17] grasping things he says but you know
[1:15:19] what he says I can't come I've been too
[1:15:20] bad I can't come
[1:15:23] he says I've just done too many things
[1:15:24] in my life I said don't you believe in
[1:15:26] the power you brothers sing about it
[1:15:28] this morning there's power in the blood
[1:15:30] of Jesus he says yeah I believe there's
[1:15:32] power in the blood of Jesus for you but
[1:15:34] he couldn't believe it for me he
[1:15:35] believed it for me
[1:15:36] but he couldn't believe it for himself
[1:15:38] and I thought to myself how sad a life
[1:15:41] how sad him in existence is that
[1:15:43] thinking that he's just gone too far
[1:15:46] friends you can't go too far
[1:15:48] as a predestinated seat of god you can't
[1:15:50] go too far your children if they leave
[1:15:54] this assembly they can't go farther than
[1:15:57] what the arm of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:15:59] who reach out turn them around and bring
[1:16:02] them back you've got loved ones out
[1:16:05] there you've got children that have left
[1:16:08] you hold on to that profession you hold
[1:16:10] on to your faith in Jesus Christ you put
[1:16:12] them before the blood put them under the
[1:16:14] blood of Jesus Christ
[1:16:15] apply the token for them before they can
[1:16:18] apply for themselves you be their Holy
[1:16:20] Ghost until they get it for themselves
[1:16:24] and then watch God move friends it may
[1:16:28] not happen when you want it oh you want
[1:16:31] to hear right and I do too but friends
[1:16:34] when that eagle flies over speaks right
[1:16:37] to that one it's like I'm coming home
[1:16:39] I'm coming home I was that one that's
[1:16:42] how I know talking to a man recently now
[1:16:48] we're construction I was talking to a
[1:16:50] man recently but it was talking about
[1:16:51] the tribulation and he said that uh he
[1:16:55] says you know the tribulation is about
[1:16:56] to start are you ready I said yeah I'm
[1:16:58] ready and I didn't realize he was one of
[1:17:00] these prepper people that him got
[1:17:01] himself three and a half years worth of
[1:17:03] food I'll tell you what I don't know
[1:17:05] it's gonna be like six months after
[1:17:07] eating cold peas but that's what he's
[1:17:09] planning on doing got him a generator
[1:17:12] and gasoline stocked up and he lives out
[1:17:14] in Timbuktu and he says I said brother
[1:17:18] that is not how I'm preparing I'm
[1:17:20] preparing right now my time I purging is
[1:17:22] right now he says you're going through
[1:17:24] the tribulation I said no no the Bible
[1:17:27] promises a rapture he says now Isis I
[1:17:29] just can't hardly wrap my mind around a
[1:17:30] rapture he says yeah I ease as I can
[1:17:33] kind of see but he says I think it's
[1:17:34] more spiritual I said yeah it's
[1:17:36] spiritual but watch me go well watch me
[1:17:38] go cuz there's gonna come a day when I'm
[1:17:40] gonna walk with God and I'm not gonna be
[1:17:43] any longer that's what's God's promise
[1:17:45] to me you see that was a personal
[1:17:46] revelation to Joel when I was 20 years
[1:17:49] old that there's gonna be a rapture take
[1:17:51] place and I'm going with that and he's
[1:17:54] talking to the wrong person he says now
[1:17:56] you're going through a tribulation I
[1:17:57] said excuse me
[1:17:58] what for when the Bible says that I'm
[1:18:01] washed in the blood of the Lamb that I
[1:18:04] my sin are not there any longer that my
[1:18:06] Senate are gone why do I need to be
[1:18:08] purged from this is why I never thought
[1:18:11] about that I said brother you need to
[1:18:13] start thinking hey just a second I don't
[1:18:18] need to go through the tribulation for
[1:18:20] my purging I'm being purged right now
[1:18:22] you know brother Branham said to take
[1:18:24] the inventory every day of your life you
[1:18:27] take inventory every day you're passing
[1:18:30] everything continually through that
[1:18:32] thinking man's filter the devil's gonna
[1:18:34] drop all kinds of stuff in your head you
[1:18:36] know I know it does it to you cuz he
[1:18:37] does it to me too I'm gonna drop all
[1:18:39] kinds of things but you pass it through
[1:18:41] that thinking man's filter and you know
[1:18:43] what's the devil and what's not
[1:18:45] basically when he tells you you're not
[1:18:47] saved Jesus wouldn't say you're not
[1:18:49] saved Jesus would just say get saved
[1:18:50] Jesus would say get the Holy Ghost Jesus
[1:18:53] would say you need healing get your
[1:18:55] healing he's not gonna ever tell you
[1:18:56] you're sick and you're gonna stay sick
[1:18:58] and you're never gonna be healed that's
[1:19:00] not God my God did not tell that to you
[1:19:06] but I told him that I'm going in a
[1:19:10] rapture you might say that's bold God
[1:19:13] wants us to be bold you know once you
[1:19:16] couldn't even enter into the Holy of
[1:19:18] Holies it was death if you did that
[1:19:20] under under the Tommen of bulls and
[1:19:22] goats you understand that but now under
[1:19:24] the Tommen of the blood of the Lord
[1:19:25] Jesus Christ
[1:19:26] it's deaf not to go into the Holy of
[1:19:28] Holies it's been open to you you can go
[1:19:31] in and receive the whole book every
[1:19:34] mystery everything of God that the rest
[1:19:36] of the world all of they they cannot
[1:19:38] understand it's not mysteries to you
[1:19:40] it's not thunders to you any longer
[1:19:42] it's voices friends we are not living in
[1:19:45] a day of silence
[1:19:46] God is not silent any longer but he's
[1:19:49] speaking to you he's saying it's me I'm
[1:19:52] Jesus I'm right here from Genesis to
[1:19:54] Revelation there I was and I'm the same
[1:19:57] yesterday today and forever it shows you
[1:20:03] who you were but he also shows you who
[1:20:07] you are and he also shows you where
[1:20:09] you're going
[1:20:09] amen
[1:20:11] let's turn in our Bibles to first
[1:20:14] Corinthians I've completely lost all
[1:20:16] track of time I'm sorry Bibles to first
[1:20:21] Corinthians 1 1st Corinthians 1 for
[1:20:33] tonight we'll speed along this morning I
[1:20:39] know some of the brothers are kind of
[1:20:41] tired talk to brother Troy he drove
[1:20:44] farther and I did this morning she
[1:20:49] appreciated her brother amen
[1:20:51] 1st Corinthians for 1st Corinthians 1
[1:20:55] rather verses forward and 9 he says I
[1:20:58] thank my god always on your behalf for
[1:21:01] the grace of God which is given you by
[1:21:04] Jesus Christ that and everything he are
[1:21:07] enriched by him in all utterance and in
[1:21:12] all knowledge even as the testimony of
[1:21:15] Christ was confirmed in you the
[1:21:22] testimony of Christ was confirmed in you
[1:21:25] so that you come behind in no gift
[1:21:28] waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus
[1:21:32] Christ who shall also confirm you unto
[1:21:35] the end that ye may be blameless in the
[1:21:38] day of our Lord Jesus Christ God is
[1:21:41] faithful by whom you were called unto
[1:21:43] the Fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ
[1:21:45] our Lord
[1:21:48] now I'll read verse 7 to you in the
[1:21:51] amplified it really was really meant a
[1:21:53] lot to me says the GR not consciously
[1:21:57] falling behind are lacking in any
[1:21:59] special spiritual endowment or Christian
[1:22:03] grace he's given it all to you the
[1:22:07] reception which is due the power of
[1:22:10] divine grace operating in your souls by
[1:22:13] the Holy Spirit while you wait and watch
[1:22:17] constantly living in hope for the coming
[1:22:20] of the Lord Jesus Christ and his being
[1:22:24] made this
[1:22:24] to all the Bible says that every knee
[1:22:28] shall bow every tongue shall confess
[1:22:30] that Jesus Christ is Lord and there that
[1:22:38] bride is looking to the coming of the
[1:22:40] Lord Jesus which that secret secret
[1:22:44] coming of Christ shall come and catch
[1:22:46] away his bride in the night the Bible
[1:22:50] says that he'll come as a thief in the
[1:22:52] night and just like the third pole of
[1:22:54] brother branham's ministry it will not
[1:22:56] be a public show only the bright now
[1:22:59] listen to me only the bride
[1:23:00] Oh know anything about it only the bride
[1:23:03] will understand that revelations six and
[1:23:08] eight have been opened but these aren't
[1:23:10] mysteries any more that it's open only
[1:23:12] the bride is going to understand that
[1:23:14] why because just like the little girl he
[1:23:17] came back and told her it wasn't the
[1:23:20] public show and neither is your going
[1:23:22] away Enoch walked with God he walked
[1:23:25] with God alone and you know the name
[1:23:26] enoch means dedicated it means dedicated
[1:23:30] he was dedicated to God he lived 365
[1:23:32] years
[1:23:33] the Bible says 300 of that he walked
[1:23:35] with God and you know that word took if
[1:23:39] you look it up and the Greek and
[1:23:41] different things like that I'm not one
[1:23:42] of these deep spiritual teachers I'll
[1:23:44] let your pastor do that he he preached
[1:23:46] some services back in Sarasota I'm
[1:23:47] telling your brother they were wonderful
[1:23:49] but that word took means he married they
[1:23:54] got married he was dedicated he believed
[1:23:57] God took God at His Word and then God
[1:23:59] married him he just took him away
[1:24:01] there's a Bride of Christ
[1:24:02] your example Amen now I'm just gonna
[1:24:07] read this to you for times sake this
[1:24:09] morning it's a Matthew chapter 13
[1:24:11] starting to verse 10 if you want to read
[1:24:12] along and the disciples came and said
[1:24:15] unto him why speakest out to them in
[1:24:17] parables he answered and said unto them
[1:24:19] because it's given unto you know to
[1:24:21] giving unto you to know the mysteries of
[1:24:23] the kingdom of heaven but to them it's
[1:24:25] not given for whosoever hath to him
[1:24:27] shall be given
[1:24:32] and he shall have more abundance but
[1:24:35] whoever but whosoever hath not from him
[1:24:37] shall be taken away even that he hath
[1:24:39] therefore speak I to them in parables
[1:24:42] because they seeing see not and hearing
[1:24:45] they hear not neither do they understand
[1:24:48] and then them has fulfilled the prophecy
[1:24:51] of Isaiah switch's says but hearing you
[1:24:53] shall hear and shall not understand and
[1:24:56] seeing you shall see and not perceive
[1:24:58] for this people's heart is waxed gross
[1:25:02] in their ears are dull of hearing and
[1:25:04] their eyes have they closed lest at any
[1:25:08] time they should see with their eyes and
[1:25:10] hear with their ears and should
[1:25:11] understand with their heart and should
[1:25:13] be converted and I should heal them now
[1:25:17] listen right here 4:16 but blessed are
[1:25:21] your eyes for they see and your ears for
[1:25:24] they hear for verily I say unto you that
[1:25:26] many prophets and righteous men have
[1:25:29] desired to see those things which you
[1:25:31] see and have seen them and have not seen
[1:25:33] them and to hear the things which you
[1:25:36] hear and have not heard them my-my-my
[1:25:42] many righteous men and prophets all down
[1:25:45] through the Old Testament have desired
[1:25:47] to see your days you know brother
[1:25:49] Branham said if I'd have been given the
[1:25:50] opportunity to live in any age he said
[1:25:53] how to make this day the most glorious
[1:25:55] of all days you think that Oh what would
[1:25:58] it have been like to walk with Jesus in
[1:26:00] his earthly ministry Oh am I to see the
[1:26:02] lame walk to see the Deaf hear to see
[1:26:05] the vine
[1:26:06] received their sight what would that
[1:26:09] have been light but friends it's a
[1:26:11] greater hour right now because jesus
[1:26:13] said these things that I do shall you do
[1:26:15] also and also greater which means more
[1:26:18] why because there's more of a science
[1:26:21] little Jesus's Jesus Christ going out
[1:26:24] and doing the very same thing she's
[1:26:26] taking him at his word and saying God
[1:26:28] you said I believe that settles that I
[1:26:31] was talking to a man recently he was
[1:26:33] just plan to praying for somebody the
[1:26:35] man had a hearing problem and he
[1:26:36] couldn't hear he says do you mind if I
[1:26:38] pray for you the man says sure go ahead
[1:26:41] and pray for me
[1:26:42] you know God honored his faith right
[1:26:44] then and at that very moment the man he
[1:26:47] was playing for received perfect healing
[1:26:49] and he says I was kind of shocked it
[1:26:51] happened he says no you know what he
[1:26:52] kind of reveals himself he says I should
[1:26:55] not have been shocked Jesus Christ is
[1:26:57] the same yesterday and today and forever
[1:26:59] he worked in his ministry he's working
[1:27:01] his ministry and you right now don't be
[1:27:06] surprised when he does it Prince you see
[1:27:15] it's only the elect that will know the
[1:27:17] mysteries of God the world and the
[1:27:20] denominations are another thing about it
[1:27:21] why not I just got back from up north
[1:27:25] and just pick something up there but I'm
[1:27:28] giving it back I'm not claiming that one
[1:27:30] it's because they've added to the Word
[1:27:33] of God it's a hybrid word at that point
[1:27:36] and you know what a high drop come from
[1:27:38] corn country up north that hybrid corn
[1:27:40] it grows up it looks real good it's real
[1:27:43] big juicy ears but if you take one of
[1:27:45] those kernels out and put it in the
[1:27:46] ground it ain't gonna produce nothing
[1:27:48] you know why cuz it's dead it's because
[1:27:50] a man took a good seed that had real
[1:27:53] life in it and he began to tamper with
[1:27:55] it he began to post up in there that God
[1:27:58] did not intend to be there and he made
[1:28:00] something that not only is it dead but
[1:28:03] when we eat it it brings death upon us
[1:28:05] - is that right find our bodies fall I
[1:28:10] remember my grandpa he was just a little
[1:28:11] man probably way stronger than I've ever
[1:28:14] been because he ain't real good food I
[1:28:17] grew up on all this trash hybrid corn
[1:28:21] and all this garbage and you know but
[1:28:26] the Branum said if it's doing that to
[1:28:28] the body
[1:28:29] what's it also doing to the mind that's
[1:28:32] why we hear about all these shootings
[1:28:33] and all these horrible things their
[1:28:35] minds are gone Jesus said let this mind
[1:28:38] be in you the same spirit that raised
[1:28:40] Christ from the dead if it dwell in you
[1:28:42] it'll quicken your mortal body and also
[1:28:45] quicken your mind to the things of God
[1:28:48] you see that's why you're the only one
[1:28:51] that's saying you're the only one that's
[1:28:53] normal because you have the
[1:28:55] mind of Christ and you and it a hybrid
[1:28:59] with man anything man has to offer it's
[1:29:06] not the Word of God and no and as a
[1:29:09] conjunction where you could add
[1:29:10] something to it it's the Word of God
[1:29:12] only amen the Word of God is that seed
[1:29:15] now that's the same position position
[1:29:18] that we see tonight we have heard about
[1:29:20] God we've been taught about God through
[1:29:22] the years we've had churches great
[1:29:24] churches great men great evangelists but
[1:29:26] I believe we're living in the shadow of
[1:29:28] the coming of the Lord Jesus when this
[1:29:30] church has come from justification under
[1:29:32] Luther sanctification under Wesley and
[1:29:35] to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:29:37] coming to the perfect church without
[1:29:40] spot or wrinkle that through that church
[1:29:43] that God might redeem back all the blood
[1:29:46] wash Saints and take them home down
[1:29:49] through the ages we're becoming more
[1:29:53] christ-like and I love this statement
[1:29:55] right here he says we're becoming more
[1:29:57] christ-like and more in the minority all
[1:30:00] the time wow what a statement that is
[1:30:04] you become like Jesus Christ you're
[1:30:07] going to be different you're gonna
[1:30:09] become more and more and more in the
[1:30:11] minority every time Wow
[1:30:14] I used to work in a great big Factory up
[1:30:16] in Ohio thousands of people work there
[1:30:18] probably heard of it called Honda and we
[1:30:21] built the cars for Honda and you know I
[1:30:23] wore the same uniform or the same
[1:30:25] hardhat I wore the same Red Wing boots
[1:30:27] and everybody else I had no idea then I
[1:30:31] stood out I had no idea but you know
[1:30:35] friends you stand out there's something
[1:30:37] different about you like I said the
[1:30:39] world glitters you glow and you know my
[1:30:42] last day of here at that place is about
[1:30:43] 12 years ago I quit move down I said I'm
[1:30:45] gonna fellowship with some believers in
[1:30:47] Florida there's believers in Ohio too
[1:30:48] but I chose to live here my last day
[1:30:53] there and a factory so the whole time if
[1:30:55] any of you work in effect but you know
[1:30:56] it's kinda like being back in a public
[1:30:58] high school again
[1:30:58] you got your proper the people you got
[1:31:00] your unpopular people you got those that
[1:31:02] are just in between
[1:31:02] you got those I want to be popular it's
[1:31:04] just like being in school all over again
[1:31:05] all that politics all that craziness all
[1:31:08] again but I said that to say that the
[1:31:12] most popular guy on my sembly line the
[1:31:14] one that everybody liked who wanted to
[1:31:16] be like him cuz he drove a Corvette not
[1:31:17] a Honda and he came up to me with tears
[1:31:23] in his eyes I had no idea that's my name
[1:31:29] and had big green happens at Hunt across
[1:31:33] the top dorky pocket protector with an
[1:31:36] ink pen in it but you know what the ego
[1:31:42] never fits it in with the chickens
[1:31:44] you're not looking back but for a good
[1:31:46] reason last day I was there he came up
[1:31:50] to me with tears in his eyes he says I
[1:31:52] want you to know that I respect
[1:31:53] everything you stand for
[1:31:54] I told him all about this message that
[1:31:56] taught him about everything I believe
[1:31:57] with tears in his eyes he came up to me
[1:32:00] and said that I respected you know he
[1:32:03] still calls me once in a while with his
[1:32:04] prayer requests 12 years later he still
[1:32:06] calls me so-and-so said would you pray
[1:32:07] for him I said oh absolutely there's a
[1:32:09] line of people formed in front of me
[1:32:11] like I said I'm nobody I'm just an
[1:32:13] assembly line worker the line form I'm
[1:32:15] reading my Bible today because of you
[1:32:17] I'm going to church today because you my
[1:32:20] aunt mom I want to tell me tell you
[1:32:22] thank you because I come back to church
[1:32:24] but it's because of you talking to me
[1:32:26] about the Lord Jesus that I'm going back
[1:32:27] friends I had no idea they felt the need
[1:32:29] to tell me that my last date because I
[1:32:31] knew that they probably never see me
[1:32:32] again
[1:32:32] but friends no matter where you go I
[1:32:34] don't care if you flip burgers at Burger
[1:32:37] King if you're there is because Jesus
[1:32:39] Christ wants to be there you have a
[1:32:41] greater calling than what your job is

[1:32:46] money in this life you got your call to
[1:32:50] display Jesus pride your call to emulate
[1:32:53] Jesus Christ to world this lost and
[1:32:56] dying you may say I bought my shirt my
[1:32:59] shoes at Goodwill you at the goodwill
[1:33:01] that day because Jesus Christ wanted to
[1:33:04] display his light to the world the Bible
[1:33:08] says that the footsteps of a good man
[1:33:10] are ordered of the Lord and he delights
[1:33:12] your way nothing happens to you by
[1:33:14] chance you say well I'm going through
[1:33:18] great trial
[1:33:19] I have heavy things that I'm dealing
[1:33:21] with the Bible says that all things all
[1:33:25] things work for the good for those who
[1:33:28] love the Lord and who are the called
[1:33:30] according to his purpose
[1:33:32] amen amen
[1:33:39] as a believer no matter where you go

[1:34:30] that family but you know what if there's
[1:34:35] a seat of God in there that light will

[1:34:50] same mm wore out forward with 80,000
[1:34:53] miles on it my drive with everybody else

[1:35:03] Christ my if God could open her eyes and
[1:35:07] get us to realize you young people you
[1:35:09] are called to live for Jesus Christ not
[1:35:13] to act and to be like the world he
[1:35:16] doesn't want you to be like that he
[1:35:19] bought doesn't want you boys with your
[1:35:20] pants all the way down here to where you
[1:35:22] can hardly walk he wants you to be a
[1:35:24] gentleman he wants you to be
[1:35:26] a real true child of God living for
[1:35:30] Jesus Christ he didn't want you
[1:35:32] be-bopping to rap and R&B you know all
[1:35:34] that met back in my day it was a Whitney
[1:35:36] Houston and Bobby Brown anybody
[1:35:38] forty-two in here you know who those
[1:35:39] people were
[1:35:40] that's who I liked boys too man
[1:35:44] yeah I think they stayed boys but that's
[1:35:50] what I like to Bobby Brown man he was
[1:35:52] his prerogative it was I don't think his
[1:35:55] prerogative got him where he wants to be
[1:35:57] today
[1:35:57] his wife and his daughter are dead what
[1:36:03] they might be in church today serving
[1:36:06] God using their talents for Almighty God
[1:36:10] might say oh she's saying yes jesus
[1:36:13] loves me once in a while I mean live for
[1:36:15] the devil the rest of the time that's a
[1:36:17] sacrifice your God can't receive the
[1:36:20] Bible says the humble can tried hard
[1:36:22] there's a sacrifice your God will
[1:36:24] receive and had she given it to Jesus
[1:36:27] Christ I hope in her last moments she
[1:36:29] did I don't know I'm not her judge
[1:36:30] that's Jesus Christ very talented people
[1:36:39] Church nominal they want to build these
[1:36:41] big old cathedrals and fill them up with
[1:36:43] thousands of people I had a guy tell me
[1:36:45] he had out of pride he was dumb that
[1:36:47] goes the biggest Church around your baby
[1:36:48] Shore Community Church he said have you
[1:36:51] heard of it who hasn't signs everywhere
[1:36:54] trying to get people to show up there
[1:36:56] you are God's eyes friends you are this
[1:37:00] is Jesus is sign the world reads you
[1:37:06] glory thousands of people but our lives
[1:37:12] change and I asked him that my life
[1:37:15] changed because I met other people that
[1:37:16] went to that same megachurch you
[1:37:19] couldn't tell him from the world that's
[1:37:25] even higher yet walk along like about to
[1:37:28] fall over on her face hi I'm pastor
[1:37:31] so-and-so
[1:37:34] what a mockery what a mockery I thought
[1:37:39] you know there's nothing about that that
[1:37:40] draws me to Jesus Christ because their
[1:37:43] mind I know him and he don't look like
[1:37:46] that
[1:37:47] but you see that church you can't tell
[1:37:49] them from the world no I see you and I
[1:37:52] see a difference a huge difference in
[1:37:54] the world the Bible said the brand says
[1:37:58] this and the flashing red light of his
[1:38:00] coming I'm closing friends flashing red
[1:38:02] light of his coming right after he
[1:38:04] preached the seals he says in the days
[1:38:06] of lot they built they sold look at it
[1:38:09] today is the days of Noah women becoming
[1:38:11] pretty the sons of God
[1:38:13] falling human flesh being worshipped in
[1:38:17] the form of females and all these things
[1:38:20] has taken place
[1:38:21] that were talked about tonight the flash
[1:38:24] the lights of flashing the coming of the
[1:38:27] Lord is at hand you know brother Branham
[1:38:29] made that statement 1963 that they would
[1:38:33] worship females and you know I listen to
[1:38:37] that as I became a more mature adult but
[1:38:39] there was a time like I said a moment
[1:38:41] ago I didn't always worship God like I
[1:38:43] said like I should have rather went to
[1:38:45] church but I've got caught up in music
[1:38:47] and friends music isn't just something
[1:38:49] light I feel led to tell you that this
[1:38:51] morning music is just as powerful as any
[1:38:53] drug out there I want to tell you that
[1:38:55] right now what before they go out and
[1:38:57] play their basketball games and things
[1:38:59] like that what do they do they get up
[1:39:00] early what's the first thing they do
[1:39:02] they put on their music they begin to
[1:39:04] get pumped up you know that music raises
[1:39:06] your heart rate I want to say 30%
[1:39:07] something like that I read a statistic
[1:39:09] on it it raises your heart rate it gives
[1:39:11] you pumps so where you can just go out
[1:39:12] there and brother Jack preached a sermon
[1:39:14] one time on invincible we are invincible
[1:39:16] they think there invent
[1:39:17] Cybil now music works just like a drug
[1:39:20] I'll tell you what I remember driving
[1:39:22] down the road is he my son's here how
[1:39:24] member driving down the road just as
[1:39:26] fast as I could drive in the name of the
[1:39:28] song was I can't drive 55
[1:39:31] I wasn't going 55
[1:39:33] I going 105 stupidity absolute stupidity
[1:39:37] but it was under the anointing of that
[1:39:40] music
[1:39:40] you say oh I don't affect me I can
[1:39:42] listen to this I can listen to that it
[1:39:44] don't affect me well listen to this
[1:39:46] friends as I read this quote it reminded
[1:39:49] me I think the group was called off for
[1:39:50] one or something like that and I had to
[1:39:54] look up the lyrics to the song and I
[1:39:55] actually watched a portion of it and it
[1:39:57] was just beyond I'd forgotten that it
[1:40:00] was that bad you know because in that
[1:40:01] state I was in I was in line with it I
[1:40:04] was in the groove of the thing if that
[1:40:06] makes sense it and I was like just all
[1:40:08] swaying and going along with it and this
[1:40:10] guy begins to sing these eyes who
[1:40:13] worship and adore you these arms won't
[1:40:16] let your heart break you know and I
[1:40:18] began to read those lyrics begin to come
[1:40:20] back to my mind and then my prophet said
[1:40:23] if the flashing red light of his coming
[1:40:25] at the end of all time that would
[1:40:26] literally worship a woman's flesh and I
[1:40:30] begin to think yes they're doing that
[1:40:32] they're doing that they're openly doing
[1:40:34] that you know the saw the words of that
[1:40:36] song as I begin to read them seem like a
[1:40:38] praise in a worship song like somebody
[1:40:40] would be worshiping their God the one
[1:40:43] that died on the cross and shed his
[1:40:45] blood but it wasn't that it was because
[1:40:47] of some adulterous relationship that he
[1:40:50] said these I will worship and adore you
[1:40:53] such filth such filth that's not popular
[1:40:58] preaching today but it's the truth
[1:41:04] worshipping other people and and ever
[1:41:07] even says they got married never it
[1:41:10] wasn't a marriage relationship with some
[1:41:12] fornication relationship and you know
[1:41:14] I've been working in a dentist office
[1:41:16] and they have that light music playing
[1:41:19] all day and I'm with customers and
[1:41:20] things like that I cannot wear my
[1:41:21] earbuds that I like to wear because I
[1:41:23] listen to some good gospel music I'm
[1:41:25] gonna listen to brother Jack
[1:41:27] I'm gonna listen to some of these good
[1:41:30] godly brothers and sisters some of our
[1:41:32] church music or listen to the prophet or
[1:41:34] something like that and you know every
[1:41:36] single song has the same undertone if
[1:41:39] you think about it those of you that
[1:41:41] have come out of the world every single
[1:41:43] one of those songs has the same
[1:41:44] undertone the pinnacle of your happiness
[1:41:47] is found in another person and once you
[1:41:49] get to that relationship all of your
[1:41:52] needs every all everything they'll be
[1:41:54] satisfied you'll be satisfied for the
[1:41:56] rest of your life oh it's empty lies
[1:42:00] because would you get in that
[1:42:01] relationship its emptiness its
[1:42:04] hollowness their true happiness the joy
[1:42:06] the peace the satisfaction you were
[1:42:09] looking for can only be found in Jesus
[1:42:10] Christ another person going to let you
[1:42:13] down you brothers and sisters you young
[1:42:15] ones out there looking for a wife or a
[1:42:17] husband you go out to the world and pick
[1:42:20] the one but the biggest shoulders are
[1:42:22] picked the one with the prettiest eyes
[1:42:23] it can move the world things like that
[1:42:27] friends you're setting yourself up for
[1:42:30] heartbreak that's all I've got to say
[1:42:32] you've got to have the Holy Ghost in
[1:42:35] your life it must be the Holy Ghost in
[1:42:37] him drawing you to her and the Holy
[1:42:39] Ghost in her drawing you to him
[1:42:41] that's a relationship they don't last
[1:42:43] till death do we part cuz trial problems
[1:42:47] are gonna come the Rays gonna par but
[1:42:51] it's only if you're anchored in Jesus
[1:42:53] Christ and have the Holy Ghost abounding
[1:42:55] in your life that you won't separate and
[1:42:59] go out to the world you say brother Joel

[1:43:06] broken homes boy goes out to the world
[1:43:09] he bet some pretty little girl come to
[1:43:11] your church and she came and acted like

[1:43:19] thought he was gonna be so she goes back

[1:43:45] Jesus Christ too sure who he's gonna
[1:43:47] marry you better be sure who you're
[1:43:49] married to the Lord is not slack
[1:44:02] concerning his promise as some men count
[1:44:04] slackness but is rather long-suffering
[1:44:07] to us-ward not willing that any should
[1:44:09] perish but that all should come to
[1:44:12] repentance let's think of the latest
[1:44:15] thing in church age in its condition
[1:44:16] today as far as I know I don't see
[1:44:19] anything to hinder at this time the
[1:44:21] coming of the Lord Jesus outside the
[1:44:24] readiness of his church outside of the
[1:44:27] readiness of his church you see friends
[1:44:29] I've heard people say oh we're waiting
[1:44:32] on Jesus to return no he's waiting on
[1:44:35] you he's waiting on me you know I've
[1:44:38] been listening to the sermon and I
[1:44:39] listened to it on the way your
[1:44:40] desperations God will honor a desperate
[1:44:44] heart and unfortunately my brother
[1:44:46] branham said the only thing that puts us
[1:44:48] in desperations as mortal human beings
[1:44:50] it's emergency it's trial and turmoil go
[1:44:55] to cnn.com sometime friends you want to
[1:44:58] be put in desperation see what's going

[1:45:02] us up blown America up they're talking
[1:45:04] about doing it in according to science
[1:45:06] they have the capability now you know
[1:45:09] how to put us in desperation did get out
[1:45:12] of here but you know what you don't have
[1:45:15] to worry about that because you have a
[1:45:16] bomb shelter the Bible says in Psalms 91
[1:45:19] that you can be hid under the wings of
[1:45:21] great Jehovah Eagle you've got a bomb
[1:45:23] shelter and that's in Jesus Christ he
[1:45:26] said I will protect you I will care for
[1:45:28] you you are mine all that little woman
[1:45:32] he loves oh my he's not gonna put her
[1:45:35] through all that he just gonna gently
[1:45:37] say come home the rest of the world's
[1:45:39] not gonna see it but you are it's gonna
[1:45:42] mean something to you
[1:45:52] just a couple more clothes if that's all
[1:45:55] right and what are we coming here for
[1:45:57] what are we doing are we coming here
[1:46:00] playing a game are we coming here
[1:46:02] meeting people is a lot Christ can't
[1:46:05] come until his church is perfectly right
[1:46:07] he is waiting on us I believe we're at
[1:46:10] the end believe the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:46:13] for your house applied the token to your
[1:46:16] house then what do you do when you apply
[1:46:19] that token to your house move out all
[1:46:21] the trash get the short skirts the
[1:46:23] shorts the cards the cigarettes might
[1:46:25] you go through a list here the
[1:46:26] cigarettes the television and what more
[1:46:29] he says kick it out the door when you go
[1:46:31] apply the token he says it won't stand
[1:46:33] for it yes sir take it all out all the
[1:46:36] dances the parties the rock and roll the
[1:46:38] old vulgar newspapers and stuff that's
[1:46:41] of the world and kick it out the door
[1:46:43] and say we're cleaning out this house
[1:46:45] around here right now we're cleaning the
[1:46:47] place up you see full obedience to the
[1:46:50] full Word of God
[1:46:52] entitles you to the token you say
[1:46:55] brother toal you started preaching on
[1:46:56] being prepared and you end up with the
[1:46:58] token that's exactly right you must have
[1:47:01] the token in your life in his ass
[1:47:03] preparing this sermon the devil begin to
[1:47:06] talk to me you say does he talk to you
[1:47:07] he absolutely does he says old there you
[1:47:09] go again talking about that token don't
[1:47:12] you know the church is sick of hearing
[1:47:14] about the token and that's what he began
[1:47:16] to say in my mind I begin to reason with
[1:47:18] me and I got to thinkin to myself you
[1:47:20] know what that's not God told me that
[1:47:22] the Church of Christ wants to hear about
[1:47:25] the token he's the one that don't want
[1:47:27] to hear about the token anymore because
[1:47:29] when the token supply he cannot enter
[1:47:32] death was stopped at that token when the
[1:47:36] Bloods there he cannot go across that's
[1:47:39] why it's up to you daddy's new mommies
[1:47:42] to apply the token to your home and that
[1:47:45] devil cannot come near your dwelling
[1:47:49] death has to pass over you the Passover
[1:47:52] happens on your street wherever you live
[1:47:56] we'll pass over because life is on
[1:48:00] display there and today
[1:48:02] the token is the Holy Ghost today that
[1:48:05] token is his life and you you say can I
[1:48:10] be so surrendered to God he said you
[1:48:12] could he said you could let's just stand
[1:48:22] this this morning do the do we know this
[1:48:27] song in Jesus name we press on
[1:48:29] if the musicians would gently play that
[1:48:34] god Bless You Heavenly Father the Lord
[1:48:38] we love you with all of our hearts Lord
[1:48:41] we believe dear God that what you have
[1:48:44] put in this book to be true and if there
[1:48:47] would be something more powerful that
[1:48:49] you could have given us Lord you would
[1:48:52] have done it but Lord
[1:48:54] you've given us overcoming power and
[1:48:59] what is overcoming our prophet said it's
[1:49:01] recognizing the devil in his tactics
[1:49:04] it's recognizing what he's doing
[1:49:07] Heavenly Father especially to your young
[1:49:10] sheep Lord give them the eye salve of
[1:49:15] the Holy Spirit to recognize how the
[1:49:17] devil's coming against them because
[1:49:19] that's soul that's embodied in that
[1:49:22] young person maybe that teenager whoever
[1:49:24] they are
[1:49:26] is worth 10,000 world's to our God Lord
[1:49:31] Jesus you would have gone up the Via
[1:49:34] Dolorosa that way to Calvary for that
[1:49:37] one little child
[1:49:39] Heavenly Father my prayer is that you
[1:49:42] would just open their eyes just now may
[1:49:44] they not wait till they're 20 like I did
[1:49:46] but they have the greatest opportunity
[1:49:49] right now to never go get the scars of
[1:49:52] the world to never go back out there and
[1:49:54] come back Oh as a child of God they come
[1:49:56] back we know that but may they not go
[1:49:59] get the scars come back with all this
[1:50:01] shame and this guilt
[1:50:03] Jesus you offer a way that that could be
[1:50:06] avoided and my prayer is I my heart
[1:50:08] cries to that one it's not surrender
[1:50:11] dear God the two would just reach out
[1:50:13] you would leave the ninety-nine and go
[1:50:15] out to that one and drawn to your fold
[1:50:17] Lord Jesus let them know how much
[1:50:20] they're loved how much they're cared for
[1:50:22] all the rest of the world wants to tell
[1:50:24] them they're alone you're alone or you
[1:50:26] you you don't have any worth you don't
[1:50:28] have but that's not the truth their
[1:50:31] value is high Lord you're not alone
[1:50:33] Jesus Christ said I will be with you I
[1:50:36] am a friend that sticketh closer than a
[1:50:38] brother I will be in you until the end
[1:50:41] of the world Lord that was your promise
