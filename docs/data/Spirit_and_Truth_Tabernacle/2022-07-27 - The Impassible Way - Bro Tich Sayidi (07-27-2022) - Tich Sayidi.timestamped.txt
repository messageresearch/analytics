[13:32] and when he was when he was come to the
[13:36] other side into the country of the
[13:38] genesis
[13:39] they made him
[13:41] to possess with devils coming out of the
[13:44] tombs exceeding fears so that no man
[13:48] might pass
[13:49] by that way
[13:51] and behold they cried out saying what
[13:53] have we to do with the jesus the son of
[13:56] god and thou come he that determined us
[13:58] before the time
[14:00] and there was a good way off from them
[14:03] in head
[14:04] of many swines feeding
[14:07] so the devil besought him saying if thou
[14:09] can
[14:10] if thou cast us out suffer us to go away
[14:13] into the head of this wine and he said
[14:16] unto them go
[14:18] and when they were come out they went
[14:20] into the head of this wine
[14:22] and behold
[14:23] the whole head of swine ran finally
[14:26] down a steep place
[14:28] into the sea and perished in the waters
[14:31] and there that kept them fled and went
[14:33] their way into the city entered
[14:36] everything

[16:43] i
[16:44] i would have preferred i normally just

[17:22] i left my wife mother two children
[17:25] uh shamga in bethel so i come with joel

[17:34] yes
[17:37] so yeah
[17:39] so
[17:40] god knew that when i get old i always
[17:42] forget the anniversaries
[17:44] so god made sure that he comes on our
[17:46] anniversary
[17:48] so
[17:49] praise god amen
[17:51] um i have enjoyed my my time here the
[17:54] fellowship
[17:56] ministers and everything you guys have
[17:58] treated us very very well am i clear
[18:02] yeah and
[18:03] you know i think
[18:06] this was more than hospitality
[18:08] if my brother here would have said
[18:11] they would have been put into into a
[18:13] hospital
[18:14] with intensive care so we have been
[18:17] intensively cared for
[18:19] by by west palm beach and for everything
[18:23] god bless you
[18:25] there's no way that can express the
[18:26] prophet said the best ways you can say
[18:28] is god bless you and god richly bless
[18:31] you
[18:32] uh
[18:33] tonight we just want to just go on a
[18:36] little
[18:38] text
[18:39] that i've entitled the the impossible
[18:42] way
[18:43] i know it's uh
[18:46] english it's not my first language so
[18:48] please please forgive me
[18:49] uh
[18:50] but i think uh it makes sense
[18:53] the impossible way
[18:55] or in another ways it's a blocked way
[18:58] so it's a way that has been blocked
[19:01] so but we want to speak on the
[19:03] impossible way
[19:05] but for for for a little thought at the
[19:07] end we want to say once is not enough
[19:11] so
[19:12] so this road has been blocked if we are
[19:14] to take the journey into the scriptures
[19:17] in matthew chapter eight
[19:19] in the we hear the story that there was
[19:21] two maniacs and they say these people
[19:25] they said they blocked the way
[19:27] until people they wanted to pass but
[19:30] this is no man could pass that way
[19:33] so regardless of if you wanted to go you
[19:36] could not go through there because they
[19:38] say those maniacs they were there and
[19:40] they said
[19:41] no men could do anything
[19:43] they say they tried to tell them they
[19:45] could not tell them
[19:47] they tried to the nurses the
[19:49] psychiatristic want to to section them
[19:52] and they could not section them
[19:54] there was no hospital that could be able
[19:56] to contain them
[19:58] so that way you know that way it was
[20:02] this these money they stood in the way
[20:04] right the operation was in the way
[20:08] until that way was impossible
[20:11] so if it is coming to church this way in
[20:14] the maniac sign that way you knew that
[20:16] you have to go the long route
[20:18] regardless how much the shorter it is
[20:21] now you have to divide
[20:23] you have to real you say what reroute
[20:26] right so you have to go around it you
[20:28] can't you can't go there because that
[20:30] way has been blocked
[20:32] and everyone knew that if you go there
[20:35] you are a dead man
[20:37] because they say they tied with faith as
[20:39] they tried with chains and those maniacs
[20:42] they were breaking them
[20:43] so they didn't intention that no man
[20:46] they are coming short way every man has
[20:48] to go the wrong way
[20:50] whether you like it or you don't they
[20:52] impose their authority
[20:54] but this story is so important that even
[20:58] jesus hate about it
[21:00] that there is a way that is blocked and
[21:02] no man could pass it and at that time if
[21:06] you look in in matthew chapter 7 he was
[21:08] already on a healing campaign he was
[21:11] already preaching and he heard about
[21:13] this way and the prophet said he had to
[21:16] cross
[21:17] the commercial sea
[21:19] to make sure that he comes and addressed
[21:21] that impossible way
[21:24] brother i want to tell you there is a
[21:25] way that is blocked all right there is a
[21:28] way in your life that may be blocked
[21:30] there may be things that you want to
[21:32] achieve today but you could not achieve
[21:34] it today
[21:35] there are things that you want to
[21:37] achieve you want your healing today but
[21:39] your healing has been blocked
[21:41] but because it has been blocked you are
[21:43] going the wrong way you are going the
[21:45] right way you are going the wrong route
[21:48] so that you can be able to make your
[21:49] destiny i want to tell you when god
[21:52] blesses you you are blessed
[21:54] if god says i viewed you you are healed
[21:57] but why you are not healed it's just the
[22:00] devil he's delaying
[22:02] the devil is good and delaying and he's
[22:04] good at delaying tactics so he can delay
[22:07] he cannot take you brother jake i want
[22:09] to tell you
[22:10] the chest cannot be taken from you no
[22:12] he can only delay it
[22:15] so he's just taking the long routes
[22:17] because there are maniacs that are in
[22:19] the way
[22:20] so we want to deal with the maniacs that
[22:22] are in the way today because they are
[22:24] blocking because if you're going to
[22:27] school it's five minutes to go to school
[22:29] it will take you 30 minutes because
[22:31] someone is sinister someone has got no
[22:34] intentions for you to enjoy life he says
[22:36] why were they standing there
[22:39] they said the people they tried to bind
[22:41] them the people they decided to to to to
[22:44] to to give them some psychiatric
[22:46] treatment but they could not do it right
[22:48] they said they failed every way
[22:51] but god did a good way i want to tell
[22:54] you that regardless of you're gonna get
[22:57] somewhere by the devil he keeps on delay
[23:00] you need to watch the delaying tactics
[23:02] of the devil
[23:04] because you're already healed
[23:06] why does he want you to be huge tomorrow
[23:09] because that's pharaoh that's pharaoh's
[23:11] idea when do you want healing tomorrow
[23:14] because we know we don't walk by faith
[23:16] walk by sight
[23:17] and faith is now
[23:20] faith is not tomorrow faith is what it's
[23:22] now
[23:24] healing is not tomorrow healing is want
[23:26] it's now so but the devil keeps on
[23:28] telling you he wants to give you a
[23:30] painkiller solution
[23:33] he doesn't want you to get healed he
[23:34] just wanted to give you panadol it says
[23:36] we take two a day you'll be fine for two
[23:38] hours after six hours the pain is back
[23:41] again and gives you he doesn't want you
[23:43] to get healed he tell you that i give
[23:45] you a painkiller solution and i want to
[23:47] tell you the people what they had for
[23:49] those maniacs was a painkiller solution
[23:51] they said they let us bind them so that
[23:54] we can go they didn't care about the
[23:56] people
[23:57] they didn't care about the two minors
[23:58] they said no the people must be bound so
[24:01] that we can go what happens to them we
[24:03] don't mind
[24:05] but i want to tell you you are so so
[24:06] important in god that he does not pay
[24:10] any cost about your life
[24:12] when it comes to you god does not spay
[24:15] costs
[24:18] church can you hear me
[24:19] when it comes to you god does not spare
[24:22] he breaks the bank of heaven to make
[24:25] sure that you have your
[24:27] your
[24:28] you have your heart's desire good does
[24:30] not stay but the prophet he says in the
[24:32] mind if you give me the next quotation
[24:36] the prophet he says
[24:38] that about the maniac of god
[24:43] he says and we find him now out in a
[24:45] little ship coming across the sea
[24:47] because over in another land in gadara
[24:50] one soul was calling for him thing
[24:52] across the sea in a mighty storm all
[24:55] through dangerous peru as he went that
[24:57] night to save one soul and to heal one
[25:00] person he came from one side
[25:06] he came from one side of the lake
[25:08] through the storm all night long to the
[25:10] next to the storm that great tide that
[25:13] might to heal one person
[25:17] he traveled all that long just to heal
[25:20] one person
[25:21] because god he wanted a solution for the
[25:24] people
[25:24] that the people that you know that have
[25:26] not been working to change that people
[25:28] that have not been going that way is
[25:31] possible
[25:32] i want to tell you in your life you
[25:34] might have a situation maybe you are
[25:37] sick and your way to healing has been
[25:39] delayed i want to tell you that way is
[25:41] possible
[25:43] because the doctors they say stage
[25:45] cancer full stage cancer for it cannot
[25:48] be healed so they now put an impossible
[25:50] way they impose it and it says you
[25:53] cannot make it they tell you that the
[25:55] statistics of this disease you cannot
[25:57] make it they make sure that that way is
[26:00] impossible but i want to tell you jesus
[26:02] he still got you in your mind
[26:04] jesus you are an investment of god
[26:08] god cannot lose you because god is not a
[26:10] poor investor that cause you today and
[26:12] lose you tomorrow right
[26:14] god is the only that's the only business
[26:17] that is in profit today if you want
[26:19] shares don't buy tesla don't buy another
[26:21] i want to tell you you need to buy
[26:23] good shirts
[26:24] because those shades they never go down
[26:26] they never depreciate they are always in
[26:29] profit every day so you might as well
[26:32] buy as many as possible because you can
[26:34] live an inheritance for your children i
[26:36] want to tell you there is an impossible
[26:38] way tonight not tomorrow because the
[26:41] faith is now
[26:43] because it says let us go
[26:45] and he says he says he traveled the
[26:47] stomach so that he can only heal one man
[26:51] brother i want to tell you we are
[26:52] servants of god but you are the children
[26:55] of god
[26:56] because we you are the most important
[26:58] and we we minister we work for you we
[27:01] wake we are servants of your father so
[27:03] you are the son you are the daughter of
[27:05] god so you so much while he says i'm not
[27:07] a preacher i'm not a singer but no you
[27:10] are the most important because we are
[27:12] here to save you god did not spay any
[27:14] course he says i have to fly here i have
[27:17] to come here at my own course so that i
[27:19] can come and preach to you so that your
[27:21] healing can be ministered so god is not
[27:24] saving and sparing any cost about this
[27:27] way that's why he's making a way is
[27:30] regardless of who is there regardless of
[27:32] how much they are posting regardless of
[27:34] how many there are but i want to tell
[27:36] you you are more important don't worry
[27:39] you may be a little flock but i want to
[27:41] tell you god's people they are not
[27:42] numbered oh hallelujah god's people they
[27:45] are not numbered but i want to tell you
[27:47] god's people they are weighed by what is
[27:49] inside of them because the greater is he
[27:52] that is in them than he that is in the
[27:54] world because the bible says you have
[27:57] come on to mount zion you have come
[27:59] under the face into the church of the
[28:00] first born you have come to innumerable
[28:03] campaign of angels when we gather in
[28:06] this place they will the one with us
[28:08] they are modern with the enemy the one
[28:10] that are in us they're more than the
[28:12] ones that are in your way brother i
[28:14] wanna tell you healing is in the way for
[28:16] you healing is you you are in the
[28:18] touching distance with healing you might
[28:21] have this you might be discouraged all
[28:23] along but i wanna tell you healing is
[28:26] now
[28:27] because that way tonight is possible
[28:30] because jesus is here
[28:33] regardless of how many how many tables
[28:36] are they they may be they may be a
[28:38] maniac they may be they may be a true
[28:40] point on care because there is more with
[28:43] us than with them
[28:45] there is innumerable campaign with us
[28:47] tonight to make sure that every promise
[28:50] in the bible is fulfilled
[28:53] i want to tell you tonight there is a
[28:55] numerical campaign and we are going to
[28:59] make it regardless
[29:00] we are not here to negotiate no we are
[29:03] here to take what belongs to us
[29:06] we are here to talk about it because the
[29:08] faith
[29:09] is the biggest is the biggest occurrence
[29:12] that never goes down
[29:13] it buys any shades at any time and we
[29:16] know our faith is this nature
[29:19] faith is a bully it does not negotiate
[29:22] it's just nations i want to tell you we
[29:25] are not going to negotiate your healing
[29:27] we are finishing your healing we are not
[29:29] negotiating your blessing we are
[29:31] snatching your blessing because faith is
[29:34] destination because when we take by
[29:36] faith then we maintain by prayer because
[29:39] we know that prayer it keeps every
[29:42] blessing the prophet says you don't need
[29:44] to live a clean life to be healed he
[29:47] says you need you need just faith to be
[29:49] healed but you need a clean life to
[29:51] maintain healing so i want to tell you
[29:54] that way that healing whatever you want
[29:57] you are you you are just two you're just
[29:59] too close brother sister your day zero
[30:02] and eight are numbered so you know your
[30:04] days are numbered by months you don't
[30:06] have time to waste
[30:07] you don't have time to be huge tomorrow
[30:09] you don't have time to be old next week
[30:11] no because your days they are so short
[30:13] you might as well enjoy
[30:16] i want to tell you there is a there is a
[30:17] possible way tonight during the time of
[30:20] moses in the book of exodus chapter 14
[30:22] we hear about the red sea they say the
[30:24] god of moses is a poor general because
[30:27] they said the red sea he just laid them
[30:30] into the red sea because the red sea was
[30:32] an impossible way they said for you to
[30:35] cross the red sea they say they had to
[30:37] open for two million people to go
[30:39] through the red sea they need to open a
[30:42] cable five kilometers and they said the
[30:45] people it would take them four hours to
[30:47] cross it and they said it's impossible
[30:50] that these people will be able to make
[30:51] it they said pharaoh started
[30:54] rejoicing and says and now i have caught
[30:57] them now i have cornered them i'm
[30:58] bringing them my cheap labor is coming
[31:01] back home but they surprised they they
[31:04] surprised that that way that was
[31:06] impossible that day it become possible
[31:09] that way that one seems as if no one do
[31:12] they will make it everyone just told the
[31:14] probability of making it was zero
[31:18] but that way was possible in that day
[31:20] because god of moses was in them and
[31:23] they said when they were crossing they
[31:25] say the sheriffs of pharaoh they started
[31:27] coming and they started riding furiously
[31:30] and they say the angel of the lord
[31:32] removed their wheels oh hallelujah they
[31:35] said the wheels of the chariots they
[31:37] were removed and they started making a
[31:39] lot of dust brother i want to tell you
[31:42] when you hear so much that's when you
[31:43] hear the screaming of the devil don't
[31:45] worry he doesn't have to run flat sir
[31:48] he's running on wheels the wheels are
[31:50] gone that's why the dust that's why the
[31:52] noise when you see sickness just keep on
[31:56] bouncing on you when you see situation
[31:58] keep on binding and squeezing you
[32:00] brother just know just he's just running
[32:02] on no wheels he's just running that's
[32:05] why the dust is making that's why the
[32:07] noise because he's running off no wheels
[32:11] why because gold has made a way that is
[32:14] possible brother god is going to take
[32:16] care of you if he took care of 2 million
[32:19] people
[32:20] brother you took care of 2 million
[32:22] people
[32:24] for 40 years
[32:25] and people in transit look you didn't
[32:28] take people to me it didn't take care of
[32:31] people 2 million people in west palm
[32:33] beach no you took care of people 2
[32:36] million in transit
[32:38] people that to manage and to heal and to
[32:42] provide for 2 million people that are
[32:44] working for 40 years
[32:46] you change the budget
[32:49] america will run bankrupt
[32:52] by just maintaining the healing just
[32:54] those people they were huge they were
[32:56] fed they had water from the rock they
[32:58] had miracles they the pillar of fire
[33:01] they the pillar of god
[33:03] they were a blessed people
[33:05] and god made a way for you
[33:07] i want to tell you if only these red sea
[33:11] would be thinking per adventure god
[33:13] chanced it
[33:14] but the next thing we hear about jericho
[33:17] we hear about joshua when he took over
[33:20] from from from moses
[33:22] praise be to god
[33:29] amen if you can go to the next slide
[33:31] please
[33:39] okay okay okay okay joshua chapter 3 18.
[33:45] joshua the same two million people they
[33:47] came to the red sea they came to to
[33:50] jericho
[33:51] and it shall come to pass as soon as the
[33:52] souls of your feet of the priest that
[33:54] bear the ark of the lord the lord of the
[33:56] air of all the earth shall rest in the
[33:58] waters the jordan the water jordan shall
[34:01] be cut off from the waters that come
[34:03] down from above in the shall stand up
[34:06] upon him
[34:07] now we hear that god
[34:10] jordan they said at that time it had
[34:12] overflown his banks
[34:14] and it was impossible
[34:16] no one knew that that road was blocked
[34:18] and they could not make it but they say
[34:20] god says you send you send the priest
[34:24] let them take the word and that way was
[34:26] possible
[34:28] he with two million people joshua he
[34:30] learned something from moses and he said
[34:33] regardless of what is in there what's in
[34:35] our way we are going to make it and the
[34:37] sure is anything he went through them
[34:40] and if they stop on there then the next
[34:42] target
[34:44] you know the devil just keep on throwing
[34:46] these blockades blockades after
[34:47] blockades
[34:48] you know for you just to come to the
[34:50] message you are blocked here you are
[34:52] blocked there they were blocked by the
[34:54] red sea they were blocked by jordan
[34:57] and the next stop
[34:59] was jericho
[35:05] my my ipad is just playing up here
[35:11] praise the lord
[35:20] joshua chapter five
[35:22] and he said nay but he kept as the
[35:24] captain of the lost horse am i come and
[35:26] joshua fell on his faith on his his face
[35:29] on the earth and did worship and said
[35:31] what saith my lord unto his servant the
[35:33] captain of the lost was said unto joshua
[35:35] loose thy shoe from the effort for the
[35:38] place where to understand this is a holy
[35:40] ground and joshua said and lord the lord
[35:42] said unto joshua i've given into thine
[35:45] hand
[35:46] jericho and the king thereof and the
[35:48] mighty men of hell
[35:50] now
[35:51] jericho they said it was so wide
[35:55] the wars that they could they could do
[35:57] some drug racing on top of it
[35:59] but they said it was in the way no one
[36:02] knew that that way it was going to be
[36:04] possible
[36:05] but it was only brought down just by a
[36:07] shout out so sometimes when you see that
[36:11] the devil is trying to just keep on
[36:13] shouting
[36:14] when sometimes when you are here when
[36:15] you are sick and you don't see the way
[36:17] out just keep on shouting because in
[36:20] that shout there is a victory
[36:22] so you just keep on praising god and
[36:24] praising god they were in the first time
[36:27] the second the third fourth sixth day
[36:29] and on the last day they said they went
[36:31] seven times
[36:33] and the walls of jericho came tumbling
[36:35] down
[36:36] even yours and the challenge that is
[36:38] before you i want to tell you tonight
[36:40] he's a victim
[36:42] tonight good is looking for the victim
[36:44] and i want to tell you the reason why we
[36:46] are here is to make sure that if as if
[36:49] he has done it before he's going to do
[36:52] it again
[36:55] then this jericho jericho corn
[36:58] we find that jordan has been crossed
[37:01] and then came elijah
[37:03] and elijah said no i have heard about
[37:06] this
[37:07] and this river is standing in my way
[37:09] again
[37:11] and what does elijah do
[37:13] in the book of kings
[37:14] all right
[37:17] and elijah took his mantle and roped
[37:19] together and smote the waters they were
[37:21] divided heather in this so that they
[37:24] they too went over on the dry ground
[37:27] brother red sea was crossed once
[37:30] by this river jordan
[37:32] is now being crossed for the second time
[37:35] amen
[37:37] so to prove jesus christ the same
[37:38] yesterday today and forever
[37:40] so sometimes then elijah had that it was
[37:43] it was done then he says if it was
[37:45] daniel yesterday it can be done again
[37:48] then he came and he smote it and he
[37:50] crossed it
[37:51] and as if as it is not enough oh my i
[37:54] felt sorry for jericho for for jordan
[37:57] elisha
[37:58] on the same chapter
[38:00] praise god
[38:04] second kings chapter 2 18 and he took
[38:06] also the amendment of elijah that fell
[38:08] from him and went back and stood by the
[38:10] bank jordan and he took the men of
[38:12] elijah and fell from him and they smote
[38:14] the waters
[38:16] and said why is the lord god of elijah
[38:18] and when he when he also had smith in
[38:21] the waters they parted he the entity
[38:24] and the elijah window
[38:26] and the prophet he says
[38:29] jordan simpler symbolize death sometimes
[38:32] death comes and knocks on your door
[38:34] sometimes death comes and knocks on the
[38:36] church
[38:37] but the church now needs to know that
[38:40] this river has been crossed before
[38:43] this river has been closed before
[38:45] because you find the prophet he says he
[38:48] said one time there was a sister or a
[38:50] believer that died they bring him
[38:52] tabernacle and they said the prophet was
[38:54] not in the place but the elders of the
[38:56] church they have heard that the
[38:58] jordanians raised the storms again
[39:01] and they said they went to the
[39:02] undertaker and says give us our our
[39:04] believer don't empower me and they
[39:07] prayed for that believer and he rose up
[39:10] again and we have seen it over and over
[39:13] again so as long as you see death
[39:15] knocking brother sister i want to tell
[39:18] you that way is possible
[39:21] don't worry about how much it is
[39:23] overflow don't worry about the
[39:25] statistics just look on the weight of
[39:28] god
[39:29] as the children of israel told you look
[39:31] and live
[39:33] look to jesus and live
[39:35] there's a simple solution don't look at
[39:38] the snake whether it's a python whether
[39:40] it's a black mamba where there is white
[39:42] just look and live
[39:44] so you did not need to look at what the
[39:47] statistics no
[39:48] just look on the scripture if you look
[39:50] on the scripture
[39:51] your possible your impassable way
[39:54] tonight is possible
[39:56] the only need you just need the only
[39:58] small small currency
[40:00] you don't need to have money in your
[40:02] bank the only thing you need is faith
[40:07] faith is a current that you can purchase
[40:09] anything
[40:10] in any country and at every good rate
[40:13] praise be to god
[40:16] i want to tell you that
[40:19] the prophet he says um sometime you know
[40:22] we as christian
[40:25] and
[40:26] along the way some we make mistakes
[40:29] and sometimes the devil he tells us
[40:31] there's no way for you to go to church
[40:33] there's no way you can come back to
[40:35] church there's no way you're going back
[40:37] to god
[40:38] and he says he's the same person that
[40:40] made you to sin
[40:41] he's the same person that influenced you
[40:43] to do the sin and he's the same person
[40:45] that prosecutes you
[40:47] but you need to tell him tonight there
[40:50] is a way begged for me because jesus
[40:53] died on the crew of cross of calvary to
[40:55] make way for sinners
[40:57] brother if you know a brother a sister
[41:00] that is far away of whatever the
[41:02] condition whatever whether they are in
[41:04] drugs whatever they're in what just
[41:06] going to them there's hand in the hook
[41:08] there is a way to come back to god god
[41:10] is calling you god is ready to forgive
[41:13] god is ready to give you a chance
[41:16] the prophet in the message over jaire he
[41:18] says
[41:19] now you talking about someone that you
[41:21] think you've got a little something that
[41:24] you can't get back to god
[41:27] look at abraham out there what he had
[41:30] done he lied about his wife setting out
[41:33] to one side any man would act like that
[41:36] too about his wife
[41:38] there he was out here out there he was
[41:42] backslid you say but brother branham i
[41:44] made a mistake last week or last month i
[41:47] don't care how many mistakes you make we
[41:49] have all sinned and come short of the
[41:51] glory of the lord if you are a child of
[41:53] abraham you are ready to realize to
[41:56] recognize that is sin and come back to
[42:00] god again god's messy steals hangs to
[42:03] you
[42:05] straight away the lord the prophet he
[42:06] says no matter how far you got and you
[42:09] think this way to come back is
[42:11] impossible he says god he says our
[42:14] father abraham he even lied about his
[42:17] own wife
[42:18] but the lord said that's my prophet let
[42:21] him pray for you
[42:22] brother regardless you are my brother
[42:24] regardless of your condition
[42:26] i saw an advocate he says he is my brand
[42:29] that says my brother has got cancer but
[42:31] he said he's still my brother
[42:33] whether your brother is big sweden he's
[42:35] still your breath
[42:37] whether he is so he has done so many
[42:39] things but his blood is ready to forgive
[42:42] and give him because the lord does not
[42:44] want the death of a sinner
[42:46] scriptural
[42:48] god does not want the death of a sinner
[42:50] that's the reason why he makes a way in
[42:52] the provision to make sure that that
[42:54] impossible way become possible
[42:58] in jeopardy he says
[43:01] and i thought oh god how can you look at
[43:04] such
[43:04] is that i thought my little sarah and
[43:08] rebecca are going to have to be raised
[43:09] up in a world like that you know the
[43:11] situation the prophet said when he went
[43:13] to a restaurant and he saw the old lady
[43:16] that was not dressed well and the
[43:17] policeman playing on the slot machine
[43:19] and they said the the the the teenagers
[43:23] doing what teenagers do and he said when
[43:26] you look at that the prophet condemned
[43:29] this is not a pastor this is not a
[43:30] brother like me this is the prophet
[43:32] himself he says wow
[43:33] lord my my daughters are they going to
[43:36] raise up in this and says i don't see
[43:39] how you can stand in to look at such a
[43:41] thing
[43:42] i was standing there criticizing the two
[43:45] drunks with the hair caught up and i
[43:47] went out
[43:49] i went out to to be going just for a
[43:51] while just then i felt something moving
[43:53] on me
[43:54] i went back and i sat down a little bit
[43:57] to the side nobody had a pay attention
[44:00] to me yet it was kind dark in the corner
[44:03] and the and there god gave me a vision
[44:07] and changed my mind and things
[44:11] now the prophet he says
[44:12] god gave me a vision
[44:15] that changed my mind you say those
[44:17] people you did not give them a chance
[44:20] he had already condemned them but he
[44:22] says god changed my mind and things that
[44:25] there is a way back
[44:27] he didn't know how they're going to make
[44:29] and he was given the vision of the blood
[44:31] bomber i want to tell you there is a
[44:33] blood that speaks better things than the
[44:36] blood of abel
[44:37] because it will never cry versions it
[44:40] always creates mercy messy messy so no
[44:43] matter what you must be able to outreach
[44:45] and tell the violence of sin there is
[44:47] room for you
[44:48] we need to be able to preach and tell
[44:50] west palm beach that there is room in
[44:52] the end there is a room for everyone
[44:55] this is the place that each and everyone
[44:58] is
[44:58] pastor here is the pastor to the
[45:01] community
[45:02] the man here is his pastor
[45:05] that drunk that you see on the street
[45:06] that's his pastor the man that you see
[45:09] that behaves misbehaves that's his
[45:11] pastor so you need to tell them that you
[45:13] must come to where you belong because
[45:16] the prophet says elijah was jesus pastor
[45:20] regardless regardless whether they like
[45:22] you they don't their pastor is here
[45:25] their church is here so you must be able
[45:27] to tell them and says brother you need
[45:29] to come back home amen you are not a
[45:32] visitor but you are coming back home
[45:34] because this is where you belong
[45:38] maybe in closing because today is
[45:40] wednesday just to keep our time
[45:43] i want to read
[45:45] in the message mighty congress
[45:50] he says
[45:52] there is so little spoke of this
[45:54] ascension
[45:56] is one of the greatest days
[45:58] when he ascended up
[46:01] because
[46:02] all over the earth since the day
[46:04] in the garden of eden that sin was
[46:07] committed
[46:08] all heavens was shot off from mankind
[46:13] the prophet he says
[46:15] since the days of eden the heavens were
[46:18] shut off
[46:19] and they said this ascension is not
[46:21] spoken too much about
[46:23] but he says but it is one of the
[46:25] greatest days when he ascended up the
[46:28] sea
[46:30] christ with his own blood
[46:33] is a high priest anointed with the power
[46:35] of god raised from the dead and he tore
[46:38] down the dominion of satan
[46:41] and he broke the domain and went through
[46:43] the heavens beyond heavens and he was
[46:45] come to the lowest one earth
[46:48] every angel archangel every principality
[46:50] and power you tore down and spoiled it
[46:55] it is
[46:56] crucifix and resurrection everything
[46:59] saturn head he broke through the veil of
[47:02] scene he tore it apart with
[47:04] with the high priest's blood and of his
[47:07] own body
[47:09] now
[47:10] there was an impossible way that when
[47:12] people want to pray remember daniel he
[47:15] was with stood for 21 days
[47:17] because they said the scene like
[47:19] pollution it was polluting and polluting
[47:22] until people could their prayers were
[47:24] not hindered they were being blocked by
[47:27] the sins of the world but they said the
[47:30] lord jesus christ when he ascended they
[47:33] said that impossible way they said he
[47:36] pulled a hole so that my prayer
[47:39] and your prayer cannot be hindered
[47:43] so now when we pray
[47:44] there is nothing that can hinder there
[47:47] because that impossible way is already
[47:50] when he ascended he made a way for our
[47:53] prayers so no matter what the devil can
[47:57] say or how much he can shrink it does
[48:00] not matter because that way is already
[48:03] being put that way has already been made
[48:06] so my prayer today cannot be hindered
[48:10] whatever i've requested the lord has to
[48:12] give you to the prophet said the lord
[48:14] has answered all my prayers if you
[48:17] didn't tell me you told me why
[48:20] he said so your prayers he said if you
[48:22] agree with anything if you bound
[48:24] anything when it is bound in heaven so
[48:26] if you pray your prayer cannot be
[48:29] stopped
[48:31] brother when you prayed when a little
[48:33] girl your prayer is still violent
[48:36] okay let me explain this
[48:39] there was a president called eisen
[48:45] and the english word yeah that one thank
[48:47] you faster
[48:49] praise be to god they said he said when
[48:52] you fire a shell
[48:54] he says if he does not best what do you
[48:56] do he said you fire another one
[48:58] right and he says if you fire a shell
[49:01] and it does not base what you do you
[49:03] fire another one
[49:04] he says at the end one of them is going
[49:06] to what is going to best so in other
[49:09] words your prayer is just like a bomb so
[49:13] when you release the girl says lord i
[49:14] want a good marriage that was firing a
[49:16] pump so when you seek you fire you will
[49:19] pray
[49:20] remember that it's a law of ammunition
[49:24] that if you fire a bomb a bomb is a bump
[49:28] whether it's is the either say is
[49:31] exploded or unexploded but it's still a
[49:34] what a pump
[49:36] you cannot take it and put it in the
[49:37] display you cannot take it home it
[49:40] becomes a what a prompt so when you pray
[49:42] in the morning you are just chilling the
[49:44] place when you pray in the evening you
[49:46] are standing the prayer brother sister i
[49:48] want to tell you that impossible way is
[49:51] full of your bombs so your bombs are
[49:53] lengthy you have prayed for the past two
[49:55] years your bombs are lazy you fasted
[49:58] your bombs are lengthy i want to tell
[50:00] you your prayers is your a bomb is a
[50:03] bump
[50:04] ah brother i want to tell you a bomb is
[50:07] a bomb regardless wage length even up
[50:10] today we're still in london we're still
[50:12] dealing with the bombs of truth of world
[50:14] war one

[50:18] like like like artifacts no
[50:20] we even if i killed houses and
[50:22] accommodation they are left people they
[50:25] run away because a bomb is a what is a
[50:27] bump so your prayer regardless when you
[50:30] pray just make sure that you are bombing
[50:32] yeah just bombing that place i want to
[50:34] tell you your prayer is not in vain your
[50:37] prayer every day is hitting the target
[50:39] it's hitting the target the devil is
[50:42] just telling it's an exploited bomb it's

[50:52] is going to land
[50:53] when one bomb explodes the rest of them
[50:57] are going to explode
[50:58] when you all we need tonight is to fire
[51:02] that last one igniting bomb we want to

[51:49] it may be too nice
[51:51] it may be tonight that we are firing the
[51:53] last bomb oh i want to tell you moses
[51:57] he fired the bomb first time and he says
[52:00] let my people go
[52:01] they say detain the water into into
[52:04] blood
[52:05] that was the first bomb pharaoh says i'm
[52:07] not going
[52:09] but that bomb it landed hallelujah and
[52:12] they said when he turned it into blood
[52:13] that says all the fishes they were
[52:15] destroyed
[52:17] and moses said okay hold on i fired the
[52:20] bomb here
[52:21] and the pharaoh is not moving
[52:23] but i want to tell you
[52:25] one thing that was happening to the
[52:26] egyptian he took away
[52:29] fish from the table
[52:31] the fish industry he already closed it
[52:34] so the egyptian the fishing industry was
[52:36] closed and he says oh they don't hear
[52:38] that let me fire the next bomb
[52:41] he fired the next bomb
[52:43] he sent the frogs
[52:44] and they did not hear says okay
[52:47] let's fire the let's send the next bomb
[52:50] he fired the next bomb it was the locust
[52:52] they said they ate all the greeneries
[52:55] they ate all the vegetables so the
[52:57] egyptian the pharaohs they are no longer
[53:00] eating any greens because it was removed
[53:03] from their table but moses didn't see
[53:05] the effects of his bombay brother it did
[53:08] not stop there so the agriculture was
[53:10] now put to settle the fishing industry
[53:13] was gone and he says okay let's keep on
[53:15] firing and he says let me fire the next
[53:18] bomb they say there was hailstone they
[53:20] said every animal that was out there
[53:22] they said it was hit and destroyed
[53:25] brother by the time that moses left
[53:27] egypt the fishing industry was gone the
[53:31] the agriculture was gone the animal
[53:34] industry was gone and the next thing he
[53:37] said okay let me kill all their first
[53:39] bones so that was the last igniting
[53:42] problem until pharaoh says okay let me
[53:44] tap out you win you can cope brother i
[53:47] wanna tell you tonight
[53:49] let's make sure we hit the table so that
[53:52] he can tap out
[53:53] we are tapping out make sure that nice
[53:56] you fire the bomb until he taps out
[53:59] if he doesn't turbo don't stop just keep
[54:01] on firing
[54:03] in the morning fire it's evening fire
[54:06] just keep on praying because i wanna
[54:08] tell you moses he fired and the last
[54:11] time he says okay
[54:13] i'm going to put you on your knees he
[54:14] says i'm taking all your ship labor
[54:17] he says i'm going with him brother when
[54:19] he left egypt there's no resources to
[54:22] follow each israel after that
[54:25] they never followed that that was the
[54:27] end of being a superpower brother so
[54:30] when you pray when you're so discouraged
[54:32] you don't know what your prayer is doing
[54:34] he's destroying your enemy so that they
[54:37] cannot follow your children so that they
[54:39] cannot follow your current shooting so
[54:41] we need to make sure tonight we fire
[54:44] enough to protect the future generation
[54:47] we fire enough to make sure that we save
[54:50] something for our children to make sure
[54:52] there is a worshipping place for our
[54:54] suit
[54:55] to make sure that our children they have
[54:57] some way to go i want to say you don't
[54:59] get science don't get tired that
[55:01] impossible well tonight it is possible
[55:04] in the book of corinthians it says in
[55:06] the amount of two or three witnesses let
[55:09] everything be accomplished i want to
[55:11] tell you if god has done it yesterday he
[55:13] has to do it again
[55:16] because doing it once is not enough if
[55:18] god feeling with the holy ghost
[55:20] yesterday he has to do it again
[55:22] lest last time people say it's his
[55:24] emotion
[55:25] if god heals you he must heal you again
[55:28] because when he healed you lasted time
[55:30] lest the people say it was chance lest
[55:33] you think it was it was yes you think
[55:35] that it was a pineapple unless he think
[55:37] it was a medication no if he did it
[55:39] yesterday he must do it to say brother
[55:43] jake because god gave you a house
[55:44] yesterday he must give you twice because
[55:47] to prove that it was him
[55:49] because he must repeat it because it is
[55:53] it is hebrew stating this age which is
[55:55] the same yesterday today and what
[55:58] forever so that means he must be
[56:00] repeating repetition is powerful
[56:04] brother you cannot call yourself a
[56:06] musician because you've played once you
[56:08] must play twice you must play three
[56:10] times you must play in different
[56:12] conditions you must play you must sing
[56:14] in england you must stay in london you
[56:17] must sing in your shower to prove
[56:18] because doing it once per adventure we
[56:21] say it's a chance i want to tell you a
[56:23] preacher cannot preach once he has to
[56:26] preach twice because we think the first
[56:28] time he's taught that knows how he's a
[56:30] chance but the repetition is what is
[56:32] powerful i want to tell you tonight we
[56:35] are here to break records because it has
[56:38] already been done because there is no
[56:40] new thing under the sun so what has been
[56:42] do it has already been done you're only
[56:45] breaking the record how many times it's
[56:47] been down cancer has been healed so many
[56:50] times we are here to break the records i
[56:53] want to tell you
[56:54] people have good homes but you are here
[56:57] to break the records so we are here to
[56:59] make sure there is a standing record
[57:02] that the children was crossed two times
[57:05] and elisha said i have to break that
[57:07] record and make it number three because
[57:10] we are the elijah we are the elijah of
[57:12] the dead elijah is gone and we are here
[57:16] what the what he did with the prophets
[57:18] we need to make sure we break that
[57:20] record because there is many of us like
[57:23] dvdq the giants by the mighty gender
[57:27] warriors they started breaking the
[57:29] records so tonight i wanna tell you
[57:31] church we must break records we must
[57:34] break records of healing in west palm
[57:36] beach we must break hair records of
[57:39] deliverance we must break records of
[57:41] having young people in church i want to
[57:44] tell you we must see young people in
[57:46] church that record must be broken
[57:49] because there must be a sustainability
[57:52] there must be future ministers those
[57:55] children that belong to isa they are our
[57:58] children we claim them another talking
[58:01] by the vicaria suffering and the
[58:03] argument of the cross of calvary i want
[58:05] to tell you once is not enough i wanna
[58:08] tell you once it's naughty enough if you
[58:10] did it yesterday if you prayed and
[58:12] breakthrough yesterday i wanna tell you
[58:14] once it's not enough because yesterday
[58:17] it might be better when it was chance so
[58:19] you need to make sure that you pray at
[58:21] home and break through you need to make
[58:23] sure when you come to church like this
[58:25] you must make sure you break through if
[58:27] you have been filled with the holy ghost
[58:28] you say lord feel me again
[58:31] even because the one man was they said
[58:33] he was healed they said he said i
[58:35] started seeing people as trees he was
[58:38] already seeing the vision was there and
[58:40] jesus said once is not enough he touched
[58:42] him again
[58:43] jesus one time he
[58:45] he raised someone from the dead and they
[58:47] said ah that person we don't think he
[58:49] was dead we think adventure they dragged
[58:52] him he was dust
[58:54] next time he said okay you waited for
[58:56] four days whenever i need proof of it
[58:59] that this man was dead until some people
[59:01] they said you stink it and he said once
[59:04] is not enough he raised lazarus out of
[59:06] the dead no matter your situation no
[59:09] matter what you are going through i want
[59:10] to tell you that god
[59:14] all things are possible with god
[59:17] they said in the book of something said
[59:19] they spoke evil of god that says god
[59:22] cannot
[59:24] so when you say god cannot provide for
[59:26] you that's when you are speaking evil
[59:29] they say you cannot finish temples in
[59:31] the wilderness god said what
[59:34] you know the moment you limit god that's
[59:37] where the problem starts
[59:39] because they said one king one king he
[59:41] said he said he said god of israel is
[59:44] only god of the mountains
[59:46] and god had him
[59:48] and god took it personal
[59:50] you know when when the doctor said you
[59:52] cannot be healed god takes it personal
[59:55] he says what
[59:56] this is my daughter i bought you i put
[59:59] it with my own blood and this man says
[1:00:01] god just do it to prove their point
[1:00:05] we are here i want to tell you brothers
[1:00:07] and sisters victory is so addictive when
[1:00:10] you when you got healed once
[1:00:13] you can stand on that platform and says
[1:00:15] god can do it again
[1:00:17] if he has if he ever provided for you
[1:00:19] yesterday all it is is building your
[1:00:21] faith every day is building your faith
[1:00:24] that's how it works because once is not
[1:00:27] enough if he heals you of a toothache
[1:00:29] next time when you have a headache you
[1:00:30] know that god can hear me the next time
[1:00:32] when you have god when you've got cancer
[1:00:34] you know that god can heal me because
[1:00:36] doing it once is not enough i want to
[1:00:39] tell you west palm beach there is more
[1:00:41] you are here to see what god can do with
[1:00:44] people your blessing you know
[1:00:47] it's
[1:00:49] you know it does it does not make god
[1:00:51] rich to keep your blessing
[1:00:56] he doesn't increase in value because he
[1:00:58] didn't give you a blessing
[1:01:00] he is still good
[1:01:02] neither does he make him poorer to that
[1:01:05] he gives the way
[1:01:06] it doesn't make him rich to keep it
[1:01:09] neither does it make him poor because it
[1:01:11] gives it away
[1:01:12] so he has no reason why he has no grudge
[1:01:15] why he cannot give to you it's only you
[1:01:18] that needs to realize that good is more
[1:01:21] willing
[1:01:23] and the prophet said there is a craving
[1:01:26] god is so they say the god is is paining
[1:01:29] inside
[1:01:30] he's just looking for a crevice where he
[1:01:32] can just a way he can explode and empty
[1:01:36] out himself good he wants to bless
[1:01:38] someone beyond measure he wants to feel
[1:01:40] someone beyond measure but he's only
[1:01:43] looking for someone who can believe it
[1:01:45] because he has damaged in the past and
[1:01:48] he's here to do it again
[1:01:50] as dwight mood says he says the world is
[1:01:52] here to see what god can do with
[1:01:55] empirement that is fully surrendered to
[1:01:57] god i want to tell you if you're fully
[1:01:59] surrendered to god you're here to see
[1:02:01] what god can do in this place regardless
[1:02:03] of the impossible way no
[1:02:05] don't look at the circumstance look at
[1:02:07] the promise
[1:02:09] look at the promise of god he is more
[1:02:11] than able to fulfill each and every
[1:02:14] promise in this book
[1:02:17] every promise
[1:02:18] every chapter every verse it belongs to
[1:02:21] this church and this whole book is a
[1:02:24] love letter full of promises to you
[1:02:27] that is send a prophet messenger so that
[1:02:30] he can explain it and break it down to
[1:02:32] you that the bible healing and
[1:02:35] everything else to know that god is a
[1:02:38] god of souls of power you do not only
[1:02:41] save your soul but it is here to save
[1:02:43] your soul and to heal your bodies to
[1:02:46] make sure that you have got plenty
[1:02:49] god does not want you to beg no god he
[1:02:52] wants you to be you you should be
[1:02:53] plenteous in good and what the prophet
[1:02:55] says
[1:02:56] he says i wish you to be prosperous
[1:02:59] spiritual material physical

[1:05:32] my what a bomb that was dropped tonight
[1:05:41] i think brother brother teach start out
[1:05:43] by saying
[1:05:44] high risk high returns
[1:05:47] and what a return amen on on um just you
[1:05:52] know the the
[1:05:54] thought to have him speak tonight and
[1:05:56] i certainly leave here uh encouraged
[1:05:59] just just
[1:06:01] seemed like a faith has been elevated to
[1:06:03] another level
[1:06:05] through
[1:06:06] these meetings and and everything and
[1:06:09] i know as a brother teach was just
[1:06:11] speaking there i just thought about i
[1:06:13] always kind of joke
[1:06:15] about uh getting married and um
[1:06:19] and um when we got married i bought a
[1:06:22] ring for my wife and thought okay this
[1:06:24] is good
[1:06:26] and i think we hit the
[1:06:28] 15-year
[1:06:30] ten-year 10-year warrant 10-year mark
[1:06:33] and um she started looking at some other
[1:06:35] rings
[1:06:37] and uh and i thought to myself like oh
[1:06:39] my i thought the first one was uh you
[1:06:41] know i thought that was it
[1:06:43] that was
[1:06:44] so you know and you know
[1:06:46] over time i'm like okay all right let's
[1:06:49] let's let's let's get the ring you know
[1:06:51] when
[1:06:52] and uh and then we hit the 25-year mark
[1:06:55] praise the lord and we start having
[1:06:57] those conversations again
[1:07:00] amen once is not enough
[1:07:03] [Music]
[1:07:04] [Applause]
[1:07:09] and as a husband i'll just be honest
[1:07:11] with you
[1:07:13] uh when a husband's able to provide for
[1:07:16] his wife when she has a desire like that
[1:07:18] it just it just
[1:07:20] it puts something a little smile on his
[1:07:23] face
[1:07:24] uh it's just an accomplishment that okay
[1:07:26] we we did it you know we did it and uh
[1:07:29] and and i just i just began to think if
[1:07:31] i can feel that way as a normal man
[1:07:35] what does god feel like
[1:07:38] when he provides for every one of our
[1:07:40] needs amen it puts a smile on his face
[1:07:44] it it don't it don't make him less i
[1:07:46] mean uh more poor i think uh richer or
[1:07:49] poorer it doesn't make him poor to give
[1:07:51] it and it don't make him richer to keep
[1:07:53] it
[1:07:54] but i think it puts a smile on his face
[1:07:57] when he sees his bride bless
[1:08:01] oh i tell you the truth amen i just feel
[1:08:04] like dropping bombs
[1:08:06] amen every prayer is another bone glory
[1:08:10] and
[1:08:11] man one of these bombs gonna go off
[1:08:14] and when that gonna go off it triggers
[1:08:16] all the other bombs
[1:08:17] so i i tell you just keep dropping
[1:08:19] church whatever just keep dropping bumps
[1:08:22] brother branham told us that the weakest
[1:08:24] christian when they hit their knees
[1:08:27] all hell begins to shake
[1:08:30] glory to god brother teach god richly

[1:09:43] um just just just just you know
[1:09:47] so many things since um even you know
[1:09:49] last wednesday just the supernatural god
[1:09:52] came down and spoken
[1:09:53] and i i told the church there that we
[1:09:56] had a building that we were we had four
[1:09:58] brothers that were scheduled
[1:10:00] we're not lepers but uh
[1:10:02] but it was four of us scheduled to go
[1:10:04] and visit a building and um and we went
[1:10:07] to see the building
[1:10:08] and you know just um
[1:10:10] um sister tanya just randomly sent me a
[1:10:14] text she'll say brother jack this
[1:10:17] building's available
[1:10:18] we gotta look at it i say it's just the
[1:10:21] tiny that's the very building that i was
[1:10:22] talking about last night
[1:10:25] and i say well you know i said here that
[1:10:28] all i can tell you all churches we're
[1:10:30] dropping bombs
[1:10:32] and uh one of these bombs gone gone
[1:10:35] it's gonna explode
[1:10:37] and we we we are moving by faith we're
[1:10:39] engaging the different people that we
[1:10:41] need to engage we're doing everything
[1:10:43] we're just getting in action
[1:10:45] amen and i just love what he said you
[1:10:48] know it's don't don't you know when when
[1:10:50] you're looking for god to bless you with
[1:10:51] something
[1:10:52] you don't necessarily need to look at
[1:10:54] the price tag that you know why that's
[1:10:57] not your concern
[1:11:00] that's god's concern
[1:11:03] so so don't say no
[1:11:06] don't don't don't don't say no because
[1:11:08] you looked at a price tag
[1:11:10] now give god an opportunity to do
[1:11:11] something great
[1:11:15] hey
[1:11:16] the same god that provides five dollars
[1:11:20] is the same god to provide five million
[1:11:22] dollars
[1:11:23] it's not a different god amen we don't
[1:11:26] go to one god to get five dollars and
[1:11:28] another god to get five no it's the same
[1:11:31] god
[1:11:33] the earth is the lord's in the fullness
[1:11:34] thereof
[1:11:36] the world and they that dwell therein so
[1:11:38] it's his responsibility
[1:11:40] amen we just leave it all in his hands
[1:11:42] but we uh we're just moving by faith and
[1:11:45] and uh and we accepted the challenge uh
[1:11:47] last week brother brother steve we
[1:11:49] accepted that challenge now this week
