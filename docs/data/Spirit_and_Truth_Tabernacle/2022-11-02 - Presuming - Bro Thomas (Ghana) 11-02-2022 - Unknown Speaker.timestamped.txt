[5:22] since brother Thomas has been with us
[5:24] there's been a couple times he's passed
[5:26] through and and uh he would call me and
[5:28] we just weren't able to get things
[5:30] sorted out so a couple weeks ago he was
[5:33] gonna was coming and and he was uh going
[5:36] to uh I thought he was going to be going
[5:39] to brother Gene to preach but he said
[5:41] things have changed and I'll be open to
[5:43] speak on a Sunday morning uh for you I
[5:46] said oh that would be great we'd love to
[5:48] have you and uh while we're there
[5:50] talking about it
[5:51] um I also just kind of talking with
[5:53] brother Mike and I told brother Mike
[5:55] brother Westco know that brother Thomas
[5:57] is here and uh you know just mentioned
[6:00] it to him and if he decides that he
[6:02] wants to use brother Thomas on Sunday
[6:04] morning we'll gladly allow him to go and
[6:07] uh and and and be in Fellowship there at
[6:10] Rapture Faith so that's that's that
[6:11] happened a couple weeks ago and so he
[6:14] kept us on the schedule just trying to
[6:15] get things worked out so we got it
[6:17] finally for tonight and uh I think he
[6:20] was with brother Bernard on Sunday and
[6:22] um and just with brother Gene and you
[6:24] know just through
[6:25] um with the different the different
[6:26] churches and my brother Gene went to
[6:28] church last night and he says um is
[6:30] there anybody that would be willing to
[6:33] take brother Thomas to service their

[7:01] as much time as as we possibly can uh
[7:04] tonight just want him just to take his

[7:08] hearts and uh and I just believe that um
[7:11] sometimes God sends a minister bar to

[11:06] even those men
[11:09] that did bring up the evil report upon
[11:12] the land died by the plague before the
[11:15] Lord
[11:17] but Joshua the son of noon and Caleb the
[11:21] son of Josephine
[11:25] which were of the men that went to
[11:28] search the land live still
[11:32] and Moses told these sayings unto all
[11:36] the children of Israel
[11:38] and the people moaned greatly
[11:42] and they rose up early in the morning
[11:45] and got them up into the mountain into
[11:49] the top of the mountain saying Leo
[11:53] we'll be here
[11:55] and we
[11:57] and they will go up onto the place which
[12:01] the Lord has promised
[12:03] for we have sinned
[12:06] and what he said wherefore now do you
[12:10] transgress the Commandment of the Lord
[12:14] but it shall not prosper
[12:18] go not up for the Lord is not among you
[12:22] that ye be not smitten before you are
[12:27] enemies all right may the Lord add
[12:29] blessing to read of his word

[12:35] [Music]
[12:39] did you want to put anything in them
[12:46] I salute each one of you in the name of
[12:49] the Lord Jesus Christ
[12:51] and uh I'm very glad also to set my eyes
[12:54] on my good friends
[12:57] at the
[12:59] we're in a church
[13:02] broadcasting was here
[13:04] in Washington DC
[13:06] anytime I come around I visit the church
[13:09] and I preach for them all right and it's
[13:12] wonderful to meet them here so I've been
[13:16] coming to Florida I've not had not even
[13:18] come across any Ghanaian in the world
[13:20] but it's good to have my brothers here
[13:24] with me
[13:27] oh
[13:28] he's not here tonight okay that's great
[13:34] it's good to have somebody here in
[13:36] Florida that's great so we are very
[13:39] grateful to be together and then those
[13:42] of you that has been with that for a
[13:45] long time at least you you can recognize
[13:47] the face that way I've spoken to you
[13:49] once and you attend the law and brother
[13:51] also has been to Ghana although I
[13:52] couldn't get opportunity to know him
[13:54] when he came to our country but I come
[13:57] to know him here and we have become
[13:59] friends anytime I'm coming around I give
[14:00] him a shout out brother but it looks
[14:03] like God has Wicked this season for me
[14:05] today amen God bless each one of them
[14:07] now we want to just speak on the subject
[14:10] the message that you said 62.
[14:15] and I step number zero four zero eight
[14:17] this program preach presuming
[14:21] presuming I want us to talk on that
[14:23] subject all right
[14:25] now the way presuming you are Americans
[14:28] we are we are African so you you you are
[14:31] English people so you understand what
[14:32] you are talking about presuming
[14:36] he said the dictionary said that's to
[14:37] venture without authority to do
[14:40] something that you don't have what it
[14:41] takes to do it right but you anyhow your
[14:44] persistent you you will force yourself
[14:46] to do it and eventually you force
[14:49] yourself to but it will come up it won't
[14:51] come out right because you don't have
[14:54] any technical know-how you don't have
[14:55] the the knowledge to come or to do it
[14:59] better but you are just persistent you
[15:01] are you are presuming or you are
[15:03] assuming that you can do it better all
[15:06] right so that is presumption and
[15:08] anything anything that comes with
[15:10] presumption there is consequences it is
[15:13] dangerous to presume yes you might be
[15:15] very certain what you are doing right if
[15:18] you are certain you know for sure that
[15:20] it will surely come out right yes
[15:22] because you see the end from beginning
[15:24] right
[15:26] you know what you're doing but this
[15:28] subject that we read in the scripture
[15:31] we know God has shown his kindness to
[15:34] Israel he wanted to prove his love to
[15:37] them that's why he allowed them to stay
[15:39] in Egypt they stayed in Egypt because
[15:42] God wanted to prove to them that he's a
[15:44] savior amen amen just to prove to them
[15:46] that he loves them so whatever you are
[15:49] going through is not that God has denied
[15:51] you or decided you no God sometimes
[15:54] permit you to go into a situation that
[15:56] he want to express his love amen that is
[16:00] why that boy that was born blind day
[16:03] asked Jesus a question what happened who
[16:05] sin in this situation say nobody right
[16:08] nobody don't attribute anything to any
[16:10] man here this is the purpose of God God
[16:13] wanted to show his glory god wanted to
[16:16] prove that he has come to open people's
[16:18] eyes amen so that guy he was there for a
[16:21] purpose amen
[16:23] so that is exactly how God works right
[16:26] you might go into a difficult situation
[16:29] but God is in it all glory the prophet
[16:32] said it is the people that left The Rock
[16:34] The Rock will never leave you right God
[16:37] will never leave his child right amen it
[16:40] has never recorded in a Bible so
[16:43] whatever we are going to remember he is
[16:45] watching you it is it depends on your
[16:49] attitude all right God is looking at
[16:51] your attitude towards the situation amen
[16:54] are you going to I tell God that
[16:57] regardless of whatever is happening you
[16:58] still love him yes that is where that is
[17:02] the problem comes people are sometimes
[17:05] disappointed when small things just fly
[17:08] up and then you see them just throw
[17:10] their hands in the air yes no
[17:14] it's right God has brought them from
[17:17] Egypt's really
[17:19] and they are going to the promised land
[17:21] and he told them that my angel will lead
[17:25] you yes that is Exodus 23 20. I will
[17:30] send an angel you are not going alone
[17:32] that angel that Pillar of Fire that make
[17:35] Moses will never leave you amen he will
[17:39] surely lead you and bring you to the
[17:40] promised land right amen so it is not
[17:43] you you just lost I am doing it all
[17:46] right it is not your business to go to
[17:48] the promise it is my business to put you
[17:50] there
[17:51] the prophet said it is not your business
[17:53] how you are going to cross the river you
[17:55] are businesses you must walk to the
[17:57] river
[18:00] not your business
[18:02] imagine how do I cross that is not your
[18:05] problem
[18:05] your problem is to obey that is God and
[18:09] move forward
[18:10] praise God to Israel
[18:14] they try to figure things out
[18:17] how could we really come into the
[18:20] Wilderness and suffer all these problems
[18:22] all disturbing we don't have food we
[18:25] don't have water we don't have this
[18:26] stuff why God was looking at their
[18:29] attitude God you mean God doesn't know
[18:32] that people supposed to drink water you
[18:34] mean God doesn't know that people should
[18:36] want to eat
[18:37] hold on amen
[18:41] but so that he leave his people in such
[18:43] a situation so that he can express his
[18:46] love he wanted people to show that that
[18:49] kind of appreciation that Lord we love
[18:51] you regardless of whether we know we
[18:54] have to really wait on God and when we
[18:57] wait on the Lord we shall see God
[18:59] manifesting his love so now Brethren
[19:02] Israel they started to Rebel they were
[19:06] talking things that they were not
[19:08] supposed to against Moses the prophet
[19:11] the Lord is stayed on the mountain when
[19:14] they go to that is a mountain cell they
[19:17] stayed there for quite a long time
[19:19] why because God wanted to prove them God
[19:23] wanted to work on them if they could
[19:25] really repent and then come to that that
[19:28] their right senses that the god that
[19:31] brought them from Egypt is the same God
[19:33] that will take them to the promised land
[19:36] Moses told them you guys are sin against
[19:41] God although you are carrying the ACT
[19:43] although the ACT is still in in the camp
[19:46] but I want to tell you God is annoying
[19:49] with you you have come to Academy God is
[19:53] annoying because I ask you guys to go
[19:56] and spread the land right you came with
[19:58] a bad report right none of you could
[20:01] really come with any good save Caleb and
[20:04] Joshua right amen and these people
[20:06] stayed in line they stayed with the
[20:09] promise they stay with the pillar of
[20:11] fire their focus was set on the promise
[20:13] right and these are the people that can
[20:16] come to the promised land but you guys
[20:19] God is going to waste you all off he's
[20:22] going to deal with you regardless of
[20:24] what you have really
[20:26] presuming that you can make it it will
[20:29] not work amen so stay away don't go God
[20:33] is not with you this is almost
[20:40] we are Israel we are Abraham children
[20:42] all right so God cannot do that God
[20:45] cannot be nice
[20:46] so please you go you go to the battle in
[20:49] the house say don't go
[20:52] God is not with you
[20:55] but the Bible said they presume that as
[20:59] long as they have a good history it is
[21:02] not you yesterday we are talking of you
[21:04] today you understand people lean on
[21:07] yesterday's experience amen people think
[21:10] of you yesterday I was a good Christian
[21:13] I was this I prophesied yesterday I was
[21:16] did I did that what about today amen we
[21:19] want to see God today not God yesterday
[21:21] all my friends God bless you
[21:24] you see wow that is what we want to see
[21:26] that these people they were just leaning
[21:30] always on their past experience thinking
[21:33] that God will stay with them but brother
[21:35] you must examine yourself in the
[21:38] situation the environment that you have
[21:39] come to if indeed God is with you amen
[21:42] God was not with them but they presume
[21:46] they will go in the house
[21:49] let us see what Peter said here
[21:54] that's second Peter
[21:57] foreign
[22:29] this thing
[22:32] he said wherefore the radar burden give
[22:35] diligence to
[22:37] make your calling and election sure
[22:40] for if you do these things he shall
[22:43] never fall make your calling an election
[22:46] sure right it is not something you must
[22:49] presume it's not something that you must
[22:52] be very sure right that you are calling
[22:55] praise God it's really in line with what
[22:59] your confession is you don't confess
[23:01] things that you don't have amen amen so
[23:04] you must make sure that you are election
[23:07] and your confession is perfect amen so
[23:10] Israel
[23:11] look at what they did they say Moses we
[23:14] are going in hell and brother said they
[23:17] made a fatal mistake
[23:19] trying to work with god without face
[23:23] bringing God on the sin wow God has
[23:26] really deserted Israel because they have
[23:30] failed him they have denied God they
[23:33] have sinned and really brother said they
[23:36] confess oh they Cry Oh Lord yes you have
[23:38] sinned but it depends on your approach
[23:41] sometimes people make confession it's
[23:43] not right confession is that they were
[23:45] crying unto the law oh Lord we have
[23:47] sinned but it was not a genuine
[23:49] repentance because they still insisted
[23:52] that they would do things without God
[23:54] God was not with them and the prophet
[23:57] Moses is the one they have to listen to
[23:59] Moses told them if you have really
[24:02] repented I am telling you that sir the
[24:04] Lord don't go amen
[24:06] don't go God is not with you
[24:10] but the Bible said they they refuse the
[24:13] warning they say we will go anyhow and
[24:16] when you read they were beaten they were
[24:18] seriously beaten Israel was big and it
[24:21] is not God's promise that his children
[24:23] will really be beaten by their enemies
[24:26] no that's right amen God never made a
[24:29] promise nothing can destroy a son of God
[24:37] and nobody can take you for your place
[24:40] amen if only you will believe and stay
[24:42] with the word of God nothing can root
[24:45] you yes amen so Israel
[24:48] you know the brother said the men of old
[24:51] the the the the great Fighters God has
[24:55] to destroy them all that is where today
[24:58] we have a new generation this message is
[25:01] the new generation that is being born
[25:03] out of Pentecost we are coming out of
[25:06] Pentecost this is the new generation
[25:07] that is why Pentecost the Bible said we
[25:11] must walk through their land that's the
[25:12] mobias and the edomers don't really
[25:15] meddle with them we are moving to our
[25:18] promised land that is the fact that they
[25:21] can go they cannot move yes that is why
[25:24] we are crossing over we are crossing the
[25:25] land and exactly this Israelite for them
[25:29] to stay with the word of God they refuse
[25:32] to stay with Moses word they presume and
[25:36] the Bible said they were completely
[25:38] destroyed by their enemies
[25:42] anytime someone presume without getting
[25:45] the actuals or would that get a a proof
[25:48] that God is in the picture brother you
[25:52] destroy every program yes that is why
[25:56] are we suffering today if he she
[25:59] presumed he told you it was okay oh a
[26:02] little bit of this a little bit of that
[26:04] there's nothing wrong with that oh it's
[26:06] okay it's okay let us miss it a little
[26:08] oh God said we we will surely that but
[26:11] we'll come with a fantastic that is news
[26:14] you should not you will not surely die
[26:18] it's not good news to you you anything
[26:21] that really makes God's word
[26:25] contrarily to God it is something that
[26:28] you have to stay away from but if
[26:31] thought
[26:32] it will give knowledge it will give
[26:35] understanding and to give him some that
[26:38] he will come to some category or some
[26:40] startups just like God and that when
[26:43] Pride set in and he said that is a good
[26:46] message uh and that is what the bible
[26:49] let us pull Paul Paul said
[26:53] Brethren that's the second Corinthians
[26:55] chapter 10.
[26:57] second Corinthians chapter 10 verse four
[26:58] it's a for for the weapon of our welfare
[27:01] is nocturnal but Mighty true God to the
[27:06] pulling down of strongholds casting
[27:10] their imaginations
[27:12] and every heightened that exalted itself
[27:15] against the knowledge of God
[27:18] and bring into captivity every thought
[27:20] to The Obedience of Christ and having in
[27:25] a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience
[27:30] when you or your obedience is fulfilled
[27:34] do ye
[27:36] look on things after the outward
[27:40] appearances If any man trust to himself
[27:44] that he is Christ let let him of himself
[27:48] think this again that as he is Christ
[27:52] even so are we Christ for though I
[27:56] should boast somewhat more of our
[27:59] Authority which the Lord has given us
[28:02] for edification and not for your
[28:05] destruction I should not be ashamed
[28:09] he has the authority that is why we are
[28:12] talking of presuming Paul he knew what
[28:14] he was holding he knew that he God has
[28:17] given him a Ministry and that is why you
[28:20] come you sit here you listen to your
[28:22] preachers God has given you ministers to
[28:25] preach to show you the way of God to
[28:28] establish you in your position because
[28:30] you don't you you cannot move to your
[28:33] position right away when they got to the
[28:35] promise that it will Joshua that divided
[28:37] alive
[28:38] you cannot go and move until I I want to
[28:41] claim this area amen right that is the
[28:44] wake of this ministers here they have to
[28:46] position you in your Promised Land wow
[28:49] blah blah says sometimes when they are
[28:52] cutting you and fixing you right there
[28:53] is painful when there is a captain if
[28:56] they cut in his favor but we have to cut
[28:58] you yes if you don't cut you cannot fit
[29:01] into it
[29:03] so sometimes you see that people oh why
[29:06] why the pastor is against me this
[29:08] message is yes it's for you because it
[29:11] has to slim it has to cut and then get
[29:14] that Surplus flesh do stuff that
[29:16] hangings it has to be cut off
[29:20] because you have a place and the pastor
[29:23] he knows he is the mercy you know how to
[29:25] cut the rock praise God he knows amen
[29:29] and put you in your appropriate Place
[29:30] amen so you must really appreciate when
[29:33] you are being cut
[29:34] [Applause]
[29:38] the prophet said
[29:40] when you are doing anything remember it
[29:43] is you and God only you understand it is
[29:46] not you and anybody you and God so
[29:49] everything that you are doing be very
[29:51] certain that God is with you right amen
[29:54] let me read what the prophet said
[29:56] be certain that God with you if you amen
[29:59] amen
[30:25] that's it now
[30:28] he said if you any perhaps any room it
[30:34] can only contain only two
[30:36] it contains you and God only all right
[30:40] it is you and God it cannot accommodate
[30:42] anybody when you are dealing with God
[30:45] make sure that that room can only
[30:48] accommodate you and God
[30:51] you don't need anyone you don't need any
[30:54] reason you don't need any consultation
[30:56] the room can only accommodate two of you
[31:00] it is you and God so you must stay and
[31:04] then reason with god without reasoning
[31:06] with any other person
[31:08] Israel they try to listen among
[31:11] themselves that they can make it and
[31:13] that is why they made the Fatal mistake
[31:14] because the prophet in the campus want
[31:17] them not to do it but they say no we are
[31:19] going to do it anyhow we will surely
[31:21] Venture and you'll Venture without
[31:23] Authority it is very disastrous it is
[31:26] really death when you want to venture
[31:27] without Authority that's right no so we
[31:31] have to cast all imaginations anything
[31:33] that comes to you blah blah says if
[31:35] anything comes to your mind warningly
[31:38] anything that is not according to the
[31:41] message he said consult your pastor
[31:46] people want to really Venture do things
[31:48] without consulting their pastors their
[31:51] ministers the pastor God has already
[31:53] ordained him he has lifted him to a
[31:55] higher Dimension you cannot be there in
[31:59] a message in his presence said no nobody
[32:01] can be in the in the level of the pastor
[32:04] wow wow because he is the Watchman of
[32:08] the place so he's always on the tower
[32:11] amen that is why it is important to
[32:13] really stay and conserve your part ever
[32:16] any movement you want to make if it is
[32:18] business if it is Mary consult your
[32:20] pastor let him go to the Tower and pray
[32:23] for evil the Lord this your shape this
[32:27] your daughter want to go this way father
[32:29] what is it and God will really let your
[32:33] pastor know what is good for you but
[32:35] today people want to venture they want
[32:37] to build their own thing and when the
[32:39] problem said do not come to God when it
[32:42] is Battle come to God God when it is
[32:44] good time all right but after people has
[32:47] messed up then they bring the problem to
[32:48] the pastor all right you ventured
[32:50] without Authority all right
[32:52] all right
[32:57] you understand
[32:59] the prophet said
[33:01] listen
[33:04] I'm reading from uh who do you say Jesus
[33:10] they followed the pillar of fire to the
[33:13] promised land
[33:14] those that went all the way through did
[33:16] you remember Caleb and Joshua they are
[33:20] this perish notice they wanted the word
[33:23] mess with the world
[33:26] call them to error and notice what did
[33:31] uh what what it did to them
[33:34] they miss it because they wouldn't
[33:37] accept the anointed word you see you
[33:42] have to have the content feed if you
[33:45] refuse the original they got the
[33:47] contents the first you have to have the
[33:50] real one
[33:51] to make a Content fit or out of it and
[33:55] the day they had it and God showed that
[33:59] he wasn't with them we were present with
[34:02] it
[34:02] they had the original word
[34:04] Moses told them don't do it God is not
[34:08] with you but they really insisted that
[34:10] they would do it and they brought a
[34:12] contemplative idea which is contrary to
[34:15] dance here the Lord and that is what
[34:17] messed they come and they all perish in
[34:20] the wilderness they all died
[34:22] the prophet said Satan has thrown all
[34:26] kind of content feats
[34:28] of shaking hands and evidences and
[34:32] everything like that forget it the hour
[34:35] has arrived that the token itself not
[34:38] some content feed not to make believe
[34:41] not substance
[34:44] substitute anything no you don't
[34:46] substitute anything it might be the
[34:48] genuine holy ghost that is why you must
[34:51] not Venture be very sure to yourself
[34:54] that you don't come you sit on this seat
[34:56] because you want to be a member Brian
[34:58] said if you want to be a member of a
[35:00] church you can be a member and you
[35:02] remember right but when you come to
[35:05] church don't stay as a member move
[35:07] further and be a member of Christ all
[35:10] right you don't come here to be a member
[35:12] of this church all right you are here to
[35:14] be a member of Jesus Christ amen so if
[35:17] you stay you want to remain a member you
[35:19] will stay here and be a member and after
[35:22] you have been a member you remember you
[35:25] you you you you your membership will
[35:27] remain in here and the others will go in
[35:30] the Rapture are they because
[35:32] you are not part of Christ
[35:37] so what we have to do you don't stay and
[35:40] play membership here all right but go
[35:43] right to your position
[35:46] that is you see me are set in Heavenly
[35:49] places in Christ there you know what uh
[35:50] that is a Ephesians said set in Heavenly
[35:54] places in Christ what is the believer's
[35:56] position that is your position is in
[35:59] Christ amen that is your position in the
[36:02] word so when you come to church I don't
[36:04] stay there move further and enter into
[36:07] Christ
[36:08] yeah
[36:11] look at it we are talking of presuming
[36:15] the Bible says that is uh first Samuel
[36:19] first Samuel 13 verse 8 and he carries
[36:23] seven days that was uh Samuel according
[36:26] to the set of time Samuel had appointed
[36:30] but someone came out to gigal and the
[36:35] people were scattered from him and Saul
[36:38] said bring him that event offering to me
[36:41] and a piece of friend and he offered the
[36:44] bent offering and he came to pass that
[36:47] as soon as he had made an end of the
[36:50] offering that Ben offering behold Samuel
[36:52] came and Saul went out to meet him that
[36:56] he must salute him and someone said what
[36:59] has that done and so said because I saw
[37:02] that the people were scattered from me
[37:04] and that that came out not within the
[37:07] days appointed and that Philips
[37:10] Philistines gathered themselves together
[37:12] at a
[37:14] match
[37:16] therefore said I the Philistine will
[37:19] come down now upon me in Giga and I have
[37:23] not made supplication unto the Lord I
[37:26] forced myself therefore and offered a
[37:29] bent over it
[37:31] is this all
[37:33] right I force myself you see
[37:36] it can't be you can be me
[37:38] forcing yourself to do things that we
[37:40] are not supposed to do
[37:42] amen he was not supposed to make any
[37:44] sacrifice
[37:46] someone has delayed but it is not your
[37:49] business it is his spirit that gives I
[37:53] right it was someone that's supposed to
[37:55] offer the secret he is a he's a prophet
[37:57] amen you are a king that is not your
[38:00] business right so if someone has delayed
[38:03] God is taking care of the problem let
[38:06] the Philistines gather let problem
[38:08] gather let all the problems come against
[38:11] you and test on your problem it is God's
[38:14] problem yes only have faith in God Don't
[38:18] Run Away around and say Lord because the
[38:21] problem was so tense I thought this this
[38:23] YouTube man can help me I thought this
[38:25] man can help you you remember I did it
[38:28] one time when he fell down and he broke
[38:30] his uh uh
[38:33] he sent
[38:35] to consult Akron
[38:38] why should he do that because he thought
[38:42] maybe Elijah will come and then just
[38:46] just put fire you know Elijah was a
[38:48] no-nonsense man when you sin Elijah will
[38:51] get to rebuke you right there so he
[38:53] didn't want to hear any rebook so he
[38:55] said go to Akron
[38:56] then consulted the woman for me brother
[38:58] Saul was not supposed to do what he did
[39:01] but he said oh someone I forced myself
[39:04] why should I force yourself all right to
[39:06] begin why should I force yourself you
[39:08] know what is right but deliberately you
[39:10] are doing what is wrong there is nobody
[39:13] here that doesn't know what is wrong we
[39:16] know what is wrong because the whole
[39:18] does God in you will always let you know
[39:20] what is right and what is wrong
[39:23] so when we sin it is not somebody that
[39:27] you tell you that you are in wrong your
[39:29] heart if you have any conscience it will
[39:31] condemn you that it is wrong
[39:33] and then you put it right it is not a
[39:35] pastor Justin oh sister come and confess
[39:38] nobody will pull you here to come and do
[39:39] confession praise God nobody will pull
[39:42] you here praise God if indeed you're a
[39:44] child of God
[39:45] the Holy Ghost will rebuke him your
[39:48] heart will be broken down and then you
[39:50] put it right
[39:52] he said
[39:54] someone else told him oh soul
[39:57] I'm sorry for you God wanted to
[40:00] establish your kingdom but now it's
[40:03] finished that's right he's finished amen
[40:06] because he couldn't wait amen wait
[40:09] when you read the book of her that is a
[40:11] Sam say wait on the Lord I say
[40:14] wait on the Lord if you cannot wait on
[40:16] the Lord then it means you are going to
[40:18] miss that's a golden opportunities you
[40:21] miss it
[40:23] again he said
[40:26] I just read it that is a festival
[40:30] 15
[40:32] .
[40:38] you see he has gone he he has made
[40:40] sacrifice and now he's going to battle
[40:43] and someone told him my friend when you
[40:46] go utterly destroy everything he say
[40:48] okay that's fine and someone came to
[40:51] Saul and Saul said unto him blessed be
[40:54] that of the Lord I have performed the
[40:57] Commandment of the Lord and someone said
[41:00] what minute then this bleeding of the
[41:04] sheep in my ears
[41:08] and the lowering the lowering of The
[41:12] Oxen which I hear and son said they were
[41:17] brought from they were they have brought
[41:21] them from the amalekitis uh for the
[41:25] people spared the best of the sheep and
[41:29] of the ozin to sacrifice unto the Lord
[41:31] Our God and the rest we have utterly
[41:34] destroyed and someone said and and
[41:37] someone said unto Soul stay and I will
[41:41] tell thee what the Lord have said to me
[41:43] this night and he said unto him stay on
[41:47] yeah what is he going to tell you your
[41:49] kingdom is finished
[41:52] it's finished
[41:54] that's right brother beloved
[41:57] we must obey the voice of God stay in
[42:02] God's word do not try to mix anything
[42:04] that is why we have this message there
[42:07] have been a lot of mixture all the ages
[42:10] they could not get this original message
[42:12] like this but we have come out with
[42:15] Grace Malachi 4 has given us the whole
[42:18] staff this is what Paul said when that
[42:21] is perfect is come now we have received
[42:23] Perfection this message is profession
[42:25] this is Christ so all the days of error
[42:28] is finished we are no more in error we
[42:32] have the true message that is correcting
[42:35] every arrow all right so Paul uh someone
[42:38] is telling a soul
[42:41] go and destroy everything he said okay
[42:45] when we went we found that this ship
[42:48] they were very very good for sacrifice
[42:50] and we thought it is not good to destroy
[42:52] these ones so we brought them in for
[42:54] sacrifice
[42:56] let me tell you
[42:58] when someone got there they were
[42:59] bleeding of the ship he he got he said
[43:02] he said why this bleeding let me tell
[43:04] you your sin will be bleeding you you
[43:06] cannot hide wow wherever you have said
[43:09] it will be bleeding
[43:12] foreign
[43:14] amen so somewhere
[43:16] told him my friend to obey is better
[43:19] than sacrifice to sacrifice yes
[43:23] why should we presume
[43:25] blah blah said the the sky is full of
[43:29] that is good things why should you take
[43:32] account of it listen friends he said
[43:36] listen friends let me tell you this will
[43:40] take a substitute when the Pentecostals
[43:43] are loaded with the written
[43:46] where I try to lay upon some fanaticism
[43:49] of a or some
[43:51] fantastic well try to rely upon some
[43:56] little emotion on some latest something
[43:59] another there is nothing today when
[44:02] Pentecostal skies are just crowded with
[44:07] the written don't take a substitute when
[44:10] you can get delayed amen you understand
[44:13] when we can get the wrist up the true
[44:16] word of God without mixture where do
[44:18] they take things that is contrary things
[44:20] that is not original why do you think
[44:23] those things but that is Satan's really
[44:25] a lie he won't be really oh just drop
[44:28] all those kind of stuff upon the people
[44:30] and if you are not
[44:33] vested grounded in the word of God
[44:35] you'll be swerved they will give you
[44:38] that is stuff that is not original and
[44:41] that is what all the ages Satan
[44:44] succeeded to do that but at this end
[44:46] time it will be difficult for him let it
[44:49] be difficult for Satan let it be
[44:51] difficult because you have Christ the
[44:54] original word and when he attacks you
[44:56] any Dimension you can use their weapons
[44:58] it is written
[45:01] it is written because we have the what
[45:04] it is to defeat Satan we have it blah
[45:08] blah said brother well take a substitute
[45:11] when the genuine
[45:13] is here why should you
[45:16] something different when the reaction is
[45:19] here at hand then when you get that
[45:23] mainspring working within you Christ the
[45:27] love of God your heart working within
[45:30] you then it will begin to express these
[45:33] kinds of uh taken
[45:36] love joy peace long suffering goodness
[45:40] gentleness patience Faith Mercy oh man
[45:44] it will just take right with those
[45:47] because the Holy Ghost has come to its
[45:50] right place it is encoding your soul it
[45:54] will be pushing all this kind of fruits
[45:56] it will come automatically you are not
[45:59] going to really force yourself to Bear
[46:01] the fruits it will come automatically
[46:04] so you must not take anything content
[46:07] for it you must take the original take
[46:10] the original why we should not presume
[46:15] I mean Moses
[46:17] look at Moses Moses a prophesied Moses
[46:22] the only thing he could do was to kill
[46:24] one Egyptian he presumed Moses thought
[46:27] he could do it by himself you remember
[46:29] he thought he could do it by himself and
[46:32] when he went to the camp
[46:34] let us see what happened he saw Egyptian
[46:37] and then
[46:39] an Israelite any problem and she said no
[46:42] no I would not allow this to happen in
[46:44] my presence
[46:45] in The Exodus chapter 2 verse 11 and he
[46:49] came to pass in those days when Moses
[46:50] was grown
[46:51] that he went out into his burden and
[46:55] look on their burdens and he is pride
[46:59] and Egyptian smiting and Hebrew one of
[47:03] his burden and he looked this way and
[47:05] that way and when he saw that there was
[47:08] no man he slew the Egyptian and hit him
[47:11] in the Sun
[47:13] Moses he knew that he was anointed for a
[47:17] job brother you must know you don't sit
[47:20] here without knowing you are calling
[47:22] every one of us you should know where
[47:24] God called you for you must know what
[47:26] why you are in this church where are you
[47:29] brother why are you in this church you
[47:31] are in this church for a purpose there
[47:34] is a reason God put you here and you
[47:37] must really exercise everything that it
[47:39] takes for you to be a good that is
[47:42] Christian here you must really adopt it
[47:44] you must do it here because that's the
[47:47] reason God placed you here amen now
[47:50] Moses knew his anointing so when he went
[47:54] to the camp he said no I will not allow
[47:56] an Egyptian to to to destroy an
[48:00] Israelite and the Bible said he killed
[48:02] the Egyptian hit him with the son and
[48:05] his own Brethren betray him his own
[48:08] breading this message you see the betray
[48:10] us it is not somebody coming from
[48:12] outside it is within people in this
[48:14] message they are betraying this message
[48:19] they are really putting all those stuff
[48:21] against the prophet
[48:23] so the same They Carried a a wrong
[48:26] message
[48:27] that is Pharaoh that that your boy has
[48:30] killed an Egyptian
[48:32] but let me tell you sometimes you'll be
[48:34] in your comfort zone
[48:36] God will let something happen to you so
[48:38] that you run to God all right Moses was
[48:41] just in the palace God was wanting him
[48:43] God was wanting him but message okay
[48:47] well I will let you be declared wanted
[48:49] so when they kill an Egyptian he became
[48:52] a wanted man all right so he has to run
[48:54] away right so sometimes God will put
[48:55] something on you and then you become a
[48:57] problem and you will run to God you
[49:00] write to God so one Moses in the process
[49:02] of running for his life because they
[49:04] were looking for him then God was loving
[49:06] after this guy now I've gotten you you
[49:11] were staying your comfort zone now you
[49:13] kill Egyptian now you are running to me
[49:15] and in the wilderness the prophet said
[49:18] there was something that Moses lack
[49:20] he lacked The Authority he wanted to
[49:23] venture without so it was presumption
[49:25] Moses presumed that he could do it by
[49:28] himself that was his his mind but he got
[49:33] to know that it was not his within his
[49:35] capacity to do it
[49:37] and what did he lack
[49:39] he like
[49:40] The Authority he lacked the power to do
[49:44] it and brother said that power was in
[49:46] the burning bush
[49:49] that's where the Burning Bush was
[49:51] pulling him what Moses like was in the
[49:54] burning bush amen that is exactly what
[49:57] you like what I like brother what we
[49:59] like is in the upper room if you don't
[50:02] have any power to operate there is a
[50:05] stance you must climb go to the upper
[50:07] room
[50:08] the Holy Ghost is waiting is available
[50:11] the powerful print is available that is
[50:14] where Peter gives Peter Peter
[50:18] is the the part of that manner empty
[50:21] Peter said it's never empty
[50:24] it is available this part this manner is
[50:27] for you and for your children children
[50:28] and as many as the Lord shall call so
[50:31] brother it is not empty go inside and
[50:34] receive your portion every priest you
[50:36] remember in the Old Testament Every
[50:38] Praise that come to the priesthood they
[50:40] have to carry a handful of that original
[50:43] Manner and give to him so that he will
[50:46] eat and understand what the original
[50:48] manner was that is what we have to do
[50:50] you will ask something the reason you
[50:53] like you cannot overcome is because you
[50:55] don't have the power to do it and that
[50:58] power is invested in God going to the
[51:00] upper room go on your knees pray and let
[51:02] God give you the power and when you
[51:04] receive the power you will be a true
[51:06] Witness
[51:09] hey
[51:11] you understand so Moses
[51:13] the prophet said
[51:15] by faith
[51:17] Faith by experience and one day when
[51:21] this old man was back there on the
[51:24] backside of they just said heading his
[51:27] father-in-law ship Jethro he saw a bush
[51:31] on fire and he went up in the presence
[51:34] of this bush now he was 8 80 years old
[51:38] and he knew more about God in five
[51:43] minutes in the presence of that bush
[51:46] that he learned
[51:48] in 80 years in the school of Egypt you
[51:52] see sure what Moses lack
[51:56] the burning bush had it
[51:59] and what the seminaries like tonight the
[52:03] Holy Ghost has got it amen the same fire
[52:07] of God
[52:08] what the schools need is fire Holy Ghost
[52:13] Fire in the presence of the fire he had
[52:17] an experience he was running from Egypt
[52:21] before now he was going back to Egypt
[52:26] that problem you were running from that
[52:29] sickness that you thought you were
[52:30] running from it you will come and pacify
[52:33] that God has given you power to conquer
[52:36] that sickness
[52:37] Moses he was running from the person he
[52:40] was running from the princess of pharaoh
[52:42] but when he made the pillar of fire what
[52:46] he lack was vested in him sometimes
[52:49] dramatized he said look at Moses he was
[52:52] just on a meal or maybe a donkey with a
[52:54] baby with the wife and then with just a
[52:57] a a a a Shepherd staff yes just as
[53:00] stakeholding and say Moses where are you
[53:02] going to say I'm going to conquer
[53:04] I'm going to conquer Egypt with what are
[53:08] your soldiers I don't need it so yeah
[53:11] why you have your machine I don't need
[53:12] any machine
[53:13] what do you have I have a steak
[53:17] amen half a stick
[53:20] brother when you meet God
[53:22] that is why it is important to go away
[53:24] the lacking is what is causing the
[53:27] problem you lack
[53:28] but go in the presence of God and when
[53:31] you are filled with the Holy Ghost when
[53:33] Peter came out from Empire brother he
[53:35] was not presuming he was not just a put
[53:38] on he has really met with God and the
[53:41] pillar of fire he has got a portion in
[53:43] his heart Christ in him there was no
[53:46] fear there was no doubt he knew that
[53:50] what God told him to do he would do it
[53:53] not by him but God will do it so when
[53:56] you when you meet the Holy Ghost sister
[53:57] and the Holy Ghost is right in your soul
[54:00] you are a dilemma Force there is nothing
[54:04] that you fear because you know God will
[54:07] surely operate even in difficult times
[54:09] he will prove that he is with you so
[54:12] that is where you cannot really Venture
[54:15] without the actress or without the
[54:16] authority you know that you know what
[54:19] you are doing when they came to the the
[54:22] gate beautiful it was not a trial Peter
[54:24] was not making a trial don't make a try
[54:26] be very very certain what you are doing
[54:28] that it will really go in Conformity
[54:31] with what you are holding the Holy Ghost
[54:34] in you will operate perfectly to bring
[54:36] the beauty of God and Peter he said my
[54:38] friend we don't have money to give oh
[54:41] I thought I'm going to get some view
[54:43] guys say no no we don't have that but I
[54:45] am coming from upper room
[54:47] I am coming from the bedroom and I am
[54:51] not by myself Peter is dead I'm dead in
[54:53] the upper room it is Jesus that is alive
[54:55] so in the name of Jesus Christ rise up
[54:59] brother
[55:01] from Apple room you are a dead man
[55:04] and that descend from epic we were dead
[55:06] amen that is why Peter was not afraid of
[55:09] death when they said okay it's okay you
[55:11] can hug me put my head down no problem
[55:13] go and kill me right tell me right
[55:18] brother they were Fearless because a Son
[55:21] of God a child of God you are already
[55:23] dead
[55:24] the life you live now is not you it's
[55:26] Christ that is the life that is where we
[55:29] have to come to and when you come to
[55:30] that place you will be Fearless you
[55:32] don't care whatever happened to you
[55:34] because you know who you believe
[55:41] presuming you don't presume anything be
[55:44] very honest be very sincere what you did
[55:46] and when Moses got that Pillar of Fire
[55:51] he was different Moses
[55:53] when he went to Pharaoh he was a
[55:56] different the same muscles that they
[55:57] were they were looking to arrest when he
[56:00] went to Pharaoh Pharaoh could not see
[56:01] that Moses again it was a different
[56:03] Moses Hallelujah it was a different
[56:06] Moses praise God
[56:07] that was like Jacob
[56:09] Jacob when Jacob met Esau he just he was
[56:13] a different Jacob he was Israel
[56:16] yes
[56:18] and so thought he was meeting Jacob but
[56:21] he met Israel
[56:24] so beloved when you meet with God
[56:26] something change things change
[56:30] there was one time
[56:31] to kill Hosea
[56:34] he also wanted to make that he take the
[56:36] prince office
[56:38] he has been blessed when God blesses you
[56:41] it doesn't make any room for you to come
[56:43] and preach because you have money
[56:48] this message I am very honest to you
[56:51] this even Ghana many places people has
[56:53] got money to support the ministry or
[56:57] have money I can build my church and
[56:59] there may be too many streamers they
[57:00] build a big church he has the money and
[57:04] then he jumps into the puppet preaching
[57:07] rabban said if a business might remain a
[57:09] businessman
[57:11] stay in your business
[57:14] and support the work of God
[57:16] because that's why he said why is it why
[57:18] why why why is it that it's always
[57:20] Shepherd God always take igorithm people
[57:23] he always the people that you don't put
[57:25] you don't place any value on them that's
[57:27] the people God use God doesn't use
[57:30] people that are really that is
[57:33] in the community people that has got big
[57:37] name blah blah said if you have a name
[57:39] God cannot use you
[57:41] God wants to use people that have no
[57:44] name all right only Jesus has a name so
[57:47] if you want to have a name brother step
[57:49] out you God cannot use you praise God
[57:53] he was blessed listen in the book of
[57:56] second chronicles 20 says he said but
[57:58] when he was strong his heart was second
[58:02] chronicles 26 16 but when he was strong
[58:06] his heart his heart was filled up with
[58:10] his destruction
[58:12] for he transgressed against the Lord his
[58:15] God and went into the Temple of the Lord
[58:17] to burn incense upon the altar of
[58:20] incense and
[58:22] Azaria the priest went in after him and
[58:26] with him first called Praise of the Lord
[58:29] and that day that were valid Valiant men
[58:34] and they withstood ozia the king and
[58:38] said unto him it opportunity not unto
[58:42] thee ozia to bring incest unto the Lord
[58:45] but to the priest the sons of Aaron that
[58:48] are concentrated to burn incense go out
[58:52] of the sanctuary for that has trespass
[58:55] neither shall it be for that honor from
[59:00] the Lord God then uzia was rough he was
[59:04] rough and had a sensor in his hand to
[59:10] Bear insects and while he was rough with
[59:13] the priest the leprosy even rose up in
[59:17] his forehead before the prince in the
[59:20] house of the Lord from besides the
[59:23] incense Altar and
[59:25] Azaria the chief priest and all the
[59:29] priests look upon him and behold he was
[59:32] leprous in his forehead and they trust
[59:35] him out of dance yet he himself hasted
[59:38] and also hasted also to go out because
[59:42] the Lord has smitten him amen that's
[59:46] right he was a king he was prosperous he
[59:50] has many inventions when you look at his
[59:53] story he was prosperous but he just
[59:56] don't pretend for it but he presumed as
[59:58] long as God has bless me I can also be a
[1:00:01] place as long as God has blessed me I
[1:00:04] can also preach it is
[1:00:06] I can also preach
[1:00:09] like
[1:00:11] a brother told me in Washington
[1:00:14] we can also know I said nobody is saying
[1:00:17] you can't preach go and preach
[1:00:23] what something that you can jump in and
[1:00:26] do it it is a Ministry it is God's
[1:00:28] Ministry this ministry is the ministry
[1:00:31] of God himself that is why brother
[1:00:34] William Brothers if you're not careful
[1:00:36] and then people are speaking dangerous
[1:00:39] things that they don't know brother
[1:00:40] Ministry is the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:00:42] all right now so if you're speaking
[1:00:45] against this you might be very careful
[1:00:48] very very careful otherwise it will not
[1:00:51] be forgiving you in this world and in
[1:00:52] the world to come and pardonable sin
[1:00:55] don't speak again this message if you
[1:00:58] don't agree
[1:00:59] you stay here
[1:01:01] there's nothing wrong with that but to
[1:01:04] speak against the message brother is
[1:01:06] dangerous
[1:01:08] I can preach I can preach people
[1:01:11] let me warn you and I say I've got a lot
[1:01:13] of money keep it to yourself
[1:01:16] if you don't want to support the
[1:01:18] ministry keep it but to jump into the
[1:01:20] minister I can preach I can pray brother
[1:01:22] that you see what happens
[1:01:23] here I can also preach I can also preach
[1:01:26] I can also burn he says he went and in
[1:01:29] the process he became leprous
[1:01:32] Jesus you know the story any leprosy
[1:01:34] cannot stay in Israel he he run away to
[1:01:37] the to be on the camp you have to run
[1:01:39] away because God has touched him you
[1:01:41] understand amen presume we know the
[1:01:45] story of Samson go SS anointed him God
[1:01:48] anoint you when the anointing leaves you
[1:01:50] brother you must go for that feeling
[1:01:51] don't think you are the same man people
[1:01:54] think they are always the same but you
[1:01:56] must know where you are you must look
[1:01:58] back make inventory and know if you are
[1:02:01] still the same man the same woman if
[1:02:04] anything is wrong if you fix it if you
[1:02:07] don't face it and you presume that you
[1:02:08] are oh like Israel you remember
[1:02:11] when
[1:02:13] God went to the king of Adam and the
[1:02:16] king of Judah and he fetched the three
[1:02:19] kings let us go and walk again that is
[1:02:23] the serials because the lamb belongs to
[1:02:25] us
[1:02:26] problem said they took a compass
[1:02:28] and they looked seven days
[1:02:32] you know what they were doing they were
[1:02:34] looking seven days oh we are Israel
[1:02:38] we are chosen Nation we conquered these
[1:02:42] people we conquered just people we
[1:02:44] conquered that Nation we conquered this
[1:02:46] one so we are still Israel brother but
[1:02:49] God was not with them they have come to
[1:02:51] a Wilderness they have come to a desert
[1:02:53] that God was not with them but they they
[1:02:56] presumed yes it's just presumption they
[1:03:00] presume that is the level Something did
[1:03:02] Samson God has made a covenant with you
[1:03:05] there is a comment between us and God
[1:03:07] and that confidence is the only the Holy
[1:03:09] Ghost the Holy Ghost is the Covenant
[1:03:12] said God making Covenant with his people
[1:03:14] what did God do he cheered Jesus apart
[1:03:18] and he gave us the best of the land
[1:03:20] what's the best of the land the Holy
[1:03:21] Ghost go to the body and give him the
[1:03:24] best you understand so he gave it the
[1:03:26] Holy Ghost he took the body of Christ
[1:03:28] and he gave it the best of the land
[1:03:31] the Holy Ghost
[1:03:33] so you must be very careful anytime the
[1:03:36] Holy Ghost take his flight you must look
[1:03:39] for him call him back before you venture
[1:03:42] don't try to do anything without him
[1:03:45] that's right
[1:03:46] in a message he's that's a a deceived
[1:03:50] Church by the world
[1:03:52] that is right to do
[1:03:54] he thought he was the same Samson
[1:03:58] when the Holy Ghost he's very timid he's
[1:04:01] very very scary he's afraid he doesn't
[1:04:04] he doesn't want to see any kind of a
[1:04:06] error when you do anything that is wrong
[1:04:10] he runs away
[1:04:13] but he has never deserted you he has
[1:04:16] never gone away brother said you'll be
[1:04:18] sitting on a tree something or a storm
[1:04:21] looking at your attitude if you call him
[1:04:23] back he cannot leave you forever because
[1:04:26] he is your comfort your comforter cannot
[1:04:30] leave him you understand so you'll be
[1:04:33] staying there right there watching your
[1:04:34] attitude yeah
[1:04:36] watching you
[1:04:38] and when you come to the altar oh Lord I
[1:04:42] am sorry I did it how I spoke to my
[1:04:44] pastor how I spoke to my wife how I
[1:04:46] spoke to him oh no it wasn't right it
[1:04:48] wasn't right to do it Lord forgive me
[1:04:50] I'll go and make it right I'll go and
[1:04:52] face oh brother I'm very sorry I was not
[1:04:55] supposed to speak address you it was the
[1:04:56] wrong thing I actually addressed you in
[1:04:58] that manner that was wrong brother can
[1:05:00] you forgive oh sister I forgive you you
[1:05:02] see the sickness of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:04] coming back to you again because you put
[1:05:06] it right you understand then go and
[1:05:09] Venture one time I think you remember
[1:05:11] when he was he wanted to pray for that
[1:05:13] that that sick person and when he he's
[1:05:16] tried to lay he said God said you are
[1:05:18] not fit to do it
[1:05:20] benefited it not why
[1:05:23] he said you were condemning somebody
[1:05:27] you were condemning somebody
[1:05:30] you're not free to do it
[1:05:32] you understand then blah blah has to go
[1:05:35] and fix it put it right praise God he
[1:05:38] has to go and visit
[1:05:40] put it right
[1:05:43] you understand yes he went to the
[1:05:46] attachment
[1:05:48] fix it right Amen on the telephone wrong
[1:05:52] I was right in the home
[1:05:54] but it was too much on me the questions
[1:05:57] too much so I just walk out and I told
[1:06:00] my wife tell them I'm not around
[1:06:03] you understand yes if it were you it was
[1:06:06] it is a white light there's nothing
[1:06:07] wrong with that
[1:06:10] eating is okay
[1:06:13] but to the prophet very sensitive he God
[1:06:16] said you are not fit to pray for that
[1:06:18] baby you are not Faith
[1:06:20] amen
[1:06:23] and then he confessed to him
[1:06:27] sorry I did it oh my wife said we were
[1:06:30] just going out yes
[1:06:31] I told her to tell you that I'm wrong
[1:06:35] so forgive me that's right you look at
[1:06:38] my mom
[1:06:40] I've respected you oh despite I respect
[1:06:44] you them all that's right brother better
[1:06:46] sometimes when you are confessing you
[1:06:48] think that it will degrade you you think
[1:06:51] that it will bring him to you but it
[1:06:52] will bring glory to you amen yeah
[1:06:55] Hallelujah
[1:06:58] to glorify God anything that glorified
[1:07:01] God it brings glory to you as well so if
[1:07:04] you confess yourself God is glorified
[1:07:10] but what is sad because we try to really
[1:07:13] cover our sins we presume nobody saw
[1:07:16] this we presume it's okay we presume
[1:07:18] it's okay sister it is not okay
[1:07:21] if your heart doesn't condemn you then
[1:07:24] there's something wrong with you
[1:07:25] let God come in and condemn us every
[1:07:29] moment every time we make error and when
[1:07:32] we are condemned we will fix it and put
[1:07:34] it right you see so Samson here he is
[1:07:38] the anointing is on this man look at a
[1:07:42] Jawbone he held it when and the the
[1:07:44] Bible said he looked for when the
[1:07:47] feeling sent by a thousand of them came
[1:07:48] upon him he looked for a tool he looked
[1:07:51] no two he grabbed a job bone he said
[1:07:54] well it's enough brother blah blah
[1:07:56] whatever is in your hand is enough if
[1:07:58] it's a special whistle it's enough if
[1:08:01] it's clapping it's enough whatever you
[1:08:05] have use it to the glory of God it is
[1:08:08] enough
[1:08:09] you don't need an organ you don't need
[1:08:12] if it is traffic club and everybody will
[1:08:15] know that God is you are worshiping God
[1:08:16] you understand
[1:08:18] amen
[1:08:19] it is not how many Organo how many drums
[1:08:22] you have but if the worship is coming
[1:08:24] from your heart we will know that we are
[1:08:26] worshiping God
[1:08:28] worship people what we have so when you
[1:08:30] got the the
[1:08:32] wow and when it got anointed man's hand
[1:08:35] blah blah said it depends upon the
[1:08:37] person with the bow
[1:08:38] it depends upon the person with the
[1:08:40] sword
[1:08:41] when the sword gets into an audition you
[1:08:44] will see how it will drive you see how
[1:08:46] it works you will need the Holy Ghost to
[1:08:48] push the word of God when the Holy Ghost
[1:08:50] is fixed right and then you are
[1:08:52] operating in that confound brother I
[1:08:54] want to tell you there is nothing that
[1:08:56] can stand against you
[1:08:58] but something one day he stood up
[1:09:00] something there on you again he shook
[1:09:03] himself I am Samson
[1:09:05] I'm going to do it again
[1:09:09] the loss were not there
[1:09:11] oh
[1:09:12] you have destroyed the Covenant the
[1:09:15] coming between you and God is completely
[1:09:17] out you are a naked man you are just
[1:09:20] something there is nothing with you
[1:09:21] again you understand but he presumes I
[1:09:26] will stand up again as something brother
[1:09:29] let us not presume let us be very honest

[1:12:19] God said behold my master has spared
[1:12:23] name and this Syrian

[1:13:39] you understand
[1:13:40] presumption
[1:13:42] I will make money from this ministry
[1:13:44] why should I follow Elijah and then
[1:13:47] there's just a bountiful and she said
[1:13:49] your Bounty just these goodies has come
[1:13:52] right in my face look at money I
[1:13:55] followed this man of God for several
[1:13:56] years look at money and you allow this
[1:13:58] man to go with that that no no that is
[1:14:00] wrong right that's wrong he chased him
[1:14:04] and then he said the prophet said
[1:14:06] Prophet never said anything that's right
[1:14:11] that's what people are doing today
[1:14:13] professor professor sometimes they are
[1:14:15] quoting wrong they are cutting wrong the
[1:14:16] prophet never said anything
[1:14:18] the prophet said just to make money
[1:14:21] Prophet said
[1:14:23] he said why if if
[1:14:25] Prophet there is everything for you I
[1:14:29] gave everything to you he said no no
[1:14:30] then he wrote that even the Lord was too
[1:14:32] much that he has he could not carry he
[1:14:35] has to help him to carry the stuff
[1:14:39] he became a rich man overnight
[1:14:41] presumption yes
[1:14:44] they really stay and
[1:14:47] just have faith in God God knows your
[1:14:52] level any stage that you get to God know
[1:14:54] what he has to give to you that you'll
[1:14:56] be able to cope with
[1:14:58] some people can be rich and then they
[1:15:01] will run away from God that's exactly
[1:15:02] right some people can get money and then
[1:15:05] they will never think about God again
[1:15:06] some people can get a good job and that
[1:15:09] job will take them from God that's right
[1:15:11] brother
[1:15:12] so mostly God knows what is good for you
[1:15:16] you are his child he's giving you maybe
[1:15:20] Millions will really make your soul
[1:15:22] perish he'll give you hundreds all right
[1:15:25] all right
[1:15:27] so that he can maintain your soul
[1:15:30] otherwise he is going to lose you
[1:15:33] blah blah blah said there was a minister
[1:15:35] he tried to cheer his old nose I will
[1:15:38] not preach again he started drinking
[1:15:40] because ah
[1:15:42] [Music]
[1:15:44] he's not going to hell but he was trying
[1:15:47] to bring reproach to the name of God
[1:15:49] that's right so God took him so God
[1:15:52] cannot lose a child so brother let us
[1:15:55] not really think that we can really make
[1:15:58] it in our own way stay in line with God
[1:16:02] don't presume anything don't think you
[1:16:05] are smart just stay with God God knows
[1:16:09] what is best for us and let us obey the
[1:16:12] voice of God and let us humble ourselves
[1:16:14] and let us respect this ministry
[1:16:17] this message that we have really got is
[1:16:20] really it it is the best that we can
[1:16:23] talk about
[1:16:25] because this is our destiny amen this is
[1:16:28] what is to put us in the kingdom of God
[1:16:30] and right as you sit there with the
[1:16:33] message in your heart you are already
[1:16:34] set in Heavenly places let us not
[1:16:36] presume anything may God help us to walk
[1:16:40] with God regardless of whatever
[1:16:41] circumstances whatever the problem might
[1:16:43] be stay with God God is looking or he
[1:16:46] knows everything he knows all our
[1:16:48] problems he know everything that we are
[1:16:50] going through don't think God is not
[1:16:53] looking on but what God is required from
[1:16:56] you is your faith in his promise just
[1:16:58] have faith in him and tell God lord I
[1:17:03] wait for the appointed time whatever it
[1:17:06] is I am waiting on you and I believe you
[1:17:09] come on the scene let nothing just kick
[1:17:13] you out Satan is the kicker you want to
[1:17:15] kick you from your territory but stay
[1:17:17] and be very persistent because God will
[1:17:21] really take the glory let us really give
[1:17:24] glory to him let us not bring shame to
[1:17:26] this message let us not allow people to
[1:17:29] laugh at God because by by so doing our
[1:17:34] attitude our Behavior will make people
[1:17:38] to really reproachfree speak against
[1:17:41] this message let it not be you
[1:17:45] like you remember what David said
[1:17:48] I know Nathan told David he said David
[1:17:50] by so doing this thing that you have
[1:17:52] done it has given room
[1:17:55] for evil people to speak against the
[1:17:58] Lord
[1:17:59] this thing that you did you did it but
[1:18:02] you have repented anyway God has but it
[1:18:06] is has become a scar it has become that
[1:18:09] is a a a a a band on the name of God
[1:18:13] that this thing that it has given room
[1:18:15] for any Miss to speak against God may
[1:18:19] God help us let us not presume sisters
[1:18:21] Brethren whatever we are doing let us
[1:18:24] get the authority let us consult God
[1:18:27] speak to your pastor that's the course
[1:18:30] are there in the Revelation
[1:18:33] Revelation chapter as in chapter four
[1:18:35] part two problem said anything that
[1:18:37] comes to you consult your pastor Don't
[1:18:41] Do Anything by yourself and when it
[1:18:43] escalates it gets off hand then you will
[1:18:46] come with tears oh Pastor I was trying
[1:18:48] to do this and no don't do that all
[1:18:51] right come to him let him give you
[1:18:54] advice because he is the man
[1:18:57] that can really
[1:18:59] encourage you to the problem unless you
[1:19:01] don't have confidence in your pastor if
[1:19:03] you have confidence in him know that he
[1:19:06] is the anointed to lead you to the
[1:19:09] promised life may God have mercy on us
[1:19:11] we are going to close now I want to
[1:19:13] encourage somebody here we are going to
[1:19:15] just make sure that we have godliness
[1:19:19] the Holy Ghost is not something that is
[1:19:22] just a put one on your flesh it is
[1:19:24] something you have had to do to get
[1:19:25] inside your soul so if you come to
[1:19:28] church to warm yourself and then the
[1:19:31] next day you are in problem you I think
[1:19:34] that that was what I was talking about
[1:19:35] yesterday
[1:19:36] you see like the people at the actor
[1:19:39] called
[1:19:40] they always come to warm themselves in
[1:19:42] the church but after warming and you see
[1:19:46] when problem comes oh my next Sunday
[1:19:50] they come hallelujah praise God
[1:19:53] you're gonna mind the problem oh why me
[1:19:55] oh listen Hallelujah
[1:20:00] brother
[1:20:01] the Holy Ghost has not settled at the
[1:20:03] right place let the Holy Ghost settle in
[1:20:05] your soul
[1:20:07] Monday there will be Joy Tuesday there
[1:20:10] will be Joy Wednesday they'll be dry
[1:20:12] because you don't care whatever
[1:20:15] opposition that rises you are certainly
[1:20:18] sure that the Holy Ghost in you is an
[1:20:21] overcomer that is what we need let us
[1:20:24] not really come and be Perpetual or a
[1:20:27] frequency that come you warm yourself
[1:20:29] next day you are off you go no don't do
[1:20:32] that let the Holy Ghost get a place to
[1:20:35] live and then it will settle in your
[1:20:37] soul and you'll be Overcomer every day
[1:20:40] people will really admire your faith
[1:20:43] people will come to you and then you can
[1:20:46] is zero
[1:20:49] people will come to you and then you can
[1:20:51] advise them because anybody that's a
[1:20:54] filled with the Holy Ghost go around
[1:20:55] that person
[1:20:57] he has got what it takes
[1:20:59] to give you the green light
[1:21:02] he can advise you he is filled with the
[1:21:04] Holy Ghost so anyone that you see that
[1:21:08] the Holy Ghost is really vested in him
[1:21:11] said when you meet that person he has
[1:21:14] got the solution
[1:21:16] advisable we are going to talk to God I
[1:21:19] want to ask you what what what what have
[1:21:22] you been doing all this time that it has
[1:21:25] not clicked or it seems not receive you
[1:21:28] are not being Overcomer why the reason
[1:21:31] is this you are making that Venture
[1:21:33] without Authority don't presume again
[1:21:36] let us go to where we can get what we
[1:21:40] lack after music got what is like after
[1:21:43] Peter got what he left Peter that denied
[1:21:45] God he got what is he lack at the upper
[1:21:48] room he came and he was a different
[1:21:50] person now we are going to pray what do
[1:21:53] you like tonight why have you been
[1:21:55] failing why have you not been being
[1:21:57] successful why is it that there's
[1:21:59] problem in home why is it that problem
[1:22:01] in marriage why is there a problem
[1:22:03] that's a husband and wife why why why
[1:22:05] all this problem why why is it that
[1:22:08] children you are disobedient to parents
[1:22:10] why
[1:22:11] the problem is that you need God you
[1:22:14] must go back to God say Lord I cannot
[1:22:17] really make it I need what it is to be
[1:22:20] an obedient child and need what it takes
[1:22:23] to respect my parents I knew what it
[1:22:25] takes to respect my husband any what it
[1:22:28] takes to love my wife we need it it is
[1:22:31] the holy God that will help you when my
[1:22:33] brother said when you go to any place
[1:22:35] when you see kicking kicking kicking
[1:22:37] around it means there is a problem the
[1:22:40] the problem is that the Holy Ghost is
[1:22:43] not there wherever the Holy Ghost is
[1:22:45] there is peace there is Joy there is
[1:22:49] forgiveness there is love you understand
[1:22:51] you love your brother you love your
[1:22:54] husband you love your wife you love your
[1:22:57] daddy you love your children you learn
[1:22:59] how to forgive and then forget but most
[1:23:03] of the problem because we don't we don't
[1:23:05] have the Holy Ghost let us not deceive
[1:23:08] ourselves anyone with Holy Ghost will
[1:23:10] always forgive
[1:23:12] right every body with Holy Ghost will
[1:23:14] always forgive when you see any person
[1:23:17] holding holding tight no no no no I
[1:23:21] cannot leave this I can't I can't
[1:23:22] forgive him okay brother if you cannot
[1:23:25] forgive him forget about heaven all
[1:23:27] right forget about heavy you you can
[1:23:30] never be a candidate
[1:23:31] if you cannot forgive you can never be a
[1:23:33] candidate
[1:23:35] let God help us
[1:23:37] that is why we have found a lot of
[1:23:40] problems even in this in the church the
[1:23:42] message people fighting
[1:23:45] people doing things that you're not
[1:23:46] supposed to do
[1:23:47] the reason is the Holy Ghost is not
[1:23:51] operating in their hearts we are going
[1:23:53] to pray that God should help you tonight
[1:23:57] let us talk to Jesus the Lord
[1:24:01] we are not going to make this Venture
[1:24:03] without having there

[1:24:13] have made some mistakes if we have
[1:24:15] really registered a lot of failures the
[1:24:18] reason is that we don't have what it is
[1:24:20] and now today we have really come to
[1:24:23] realization that what we lack is in the
[1:24:26] upper room so tonight Lord I'm climbing
