[2:22] Hallelujah.
[2:26] Hallelujah. Happy Mother's
[2:29] Day. It's good to see you again. Thank
[2:32] you for being a blessing to the
[2:38] children. Let's open our
[2:41] Bibles. Psalms
[2:48] 42. We read Psalms
[2:51] 42. We invite brother and gentlemen to
[2:56] come open the service with the word of
[3:00] God.
[3:03] Amen. Psalms 42. As the de as the heart
[3:07] panth after the water
[3:09] brooks. So panth my soul after God. My
[3:13] soul thirst for God for the living God.
[3:17] When shall I come and appear before God?
[3:20] My tears have been my me day and night.
[3:23] While they continue to say to me, "Where
[3:25] is thy father?" When I remember these
[3:28] things, I pour out my soul in me. For I
[3:31] had gone with the multitude, I went with
[3:33] them to the house of God, with a voice
[3:35] of joy and praise with multitude that
[3:38] kept holy name. Why art thou cast down,
[3:41] oh my soul, and why art thou disqued in
[3:44] me? Hope thou, oh God, for I shall yet
[3:48] praise thee before the help of his
[3:50] countenance. Oh my God, my soul is cast
[3:53] down within me. Therefore will I
[3:55] remember thee from the land of Jordan
[3:58] and of and of the hermites from the hill
[4:01] of the
[4:06] deep. Oh th waves, thy bowels are gone
[4:09] over me. Yet the Lord will command his
[4:12] loving kindness in the daytime and in
[4:14] the night his soul shall be with me and
[4:16] my prayer to unto the God of my life. I
[4:20] will say unto God, my rock, why hast
[4:23] thou forgotten me? Why go out mourning
[4:25] because of the oppression of the
[4:28] enemy? As with a sword, in my bones my
[4:31] enemies reproach me. Why they say daily
[4:34] unto me, where is thy God? Why art why
[4:38] art thou cast down, oh my soul? Why art
[4:40] thou disquire within me? Hope thou in
[4:43] God for I shall yet praise
[4:46] him for the health of my calvance. He my
[4:50] God.
[4:51] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord, brother.
[4:58] [Music]
[5:06] Oh most gracious Lord God, we come
[5:08] before you Lord and we just want to
[5:09] thank you oh Lord God. Oh Lord, before
[5:12] the foundation of the world, Lord God,
[5:14] before the struggle and the strife that
[5:16] we face in our daily lives, oh Lord God,
[5:18] and the questions and the wondering
[5:20] stuff, Lord, you placed in us, oh Lord
[5:23] God, you deposited deep inside of our
[5:25] souls, oh Lord Jesus Christ, your own
[5:28] image, oh Lord Jesus Christ, oh Lord,
[5:31] before the fighting started, oh Lord
[5:33] God, we were already victorious, oh Lord
[5:36] Jesus Christ, before the day we were
[5:38] born, Lord Jesus Christ, we had the
[5:40] victory inside of us, oh Lord. Lord
[5:41] Jesus Christ, so that no matter how much
[5:44] the the winds blow, when the storms try
[5:47] to push us to the side, Lord God, and
[5:49] sickness, oh Lord, tries to take our
[5:52] focus off of you, oh Lord Jesus Christ,
[5:54] when the problems of the world just
[5:56] crush us and pressure us, oh Lord God,
[5:58] that sometimes we just can't we can't
[6:00] seem to focus. We can't get up, oh Lord
[6:03] God. Uh it's been described as a bed of
[6:05] affliction. Affliction. Oh Lord God,
[6:07] where it feels like we just can't move,
[6:09] oh Lord God, we can't think. Oh Lord
[6:11] God, we can't pray. Oh Lord God, we
[6:13] can't we can't we can't love you like we
[6:16] should love you, oh Lord God. We can't
[6:17] give you all the glory, Lord. But Lord,
[6:19] you placing us, oh Lord God, your own
[6:22] image, oh Lord, before the foundation of
[6:24] the world, oh Lord. Lord, there's
[6:26] something inside of us that is drawn to
[6:28] you, oh Lord Jesus Christ. Lord, Lord,
[6:30] before we started to come to church,
[6:32] before we knew what church was and and
[6:34] before we knew what uh prayer was, Lord
[6:37] God, and before we knew what prophets
[6:38] were, Lord Jesus Christ, before we knew
[6:40] what the mysteries were, Lord God, and
[6:43] what the Bible means in this verse and
[6:46] that verse, before we could quote,
[6:48] before we could memorize any Bible
[6:50] verse, oh Lord Jesus Christ, your image
[6:52] was inside of us, oh Lord God, drawing
[6:55] us to you, oh Lord Jesus Christ. Lord,
[6:58] help us to focus on what matters, oh
[7:00] Lord, and that's your grace, oh Lord
[7:02] Jesus Christ. So no matter how sick we
[7:05] are, Lord God, no matter how much we're
[7:07] going through, oh Lord God, your love is
[7:10] deep inside of our souls, oh Lord God,
[7:12] it's something that doesn't change, oh
[7:14] Lord God. Lord, you said you are your
[7:16] word and the and the word is you, oh
[7:19] Lord God. And Lord, we've become your
[7:21] word, Lord Jesus Christ. Lord, that
[7:24] means we can't be shaken, oh Lord God.
[7:26] Though this body uh tear though we have
[7:29] so many issues in this body oh Lord
[7:31] Jesus Christ that revelation oh Lord
[7:33] that we were in your mind before the
[7:35] foundation of the world Lord God Lord
[7:38] that is our anchor oh Lord Jesus Christ
[7:41] Lord while Job was going through his
[7:43] trials oh Lord God on every hand his own
[7:46] family his friends oh Lord God
[7:48] everything was against him oh Lord but
[7:51] Lord when your word came oh Lord when
[7:53] your servant came to him and he realized
[7:55] eyes that his redeemer liveth, oh Lord
[7:58] God. Lord, it was while the skin worms
[8:01] were in his body, oh Lord God, that he
[8:03] had a praise, Lord Jesus Christ. It
[8:06] wasn't when the trial was over, oh Lord
[8:08] God, but it was during the trial, it was
[8:10] during the test, oh Lord God, it was
[8:12] during what he was going through, oh
[8:13] Lord, that he was able to still see who
[8:16] he was inside of you, oh Lord God. Lord,
[8:20] give us that revelation today, oh Lord
[8:22] God. Lord, as the as the minister comes
[8:25] forth, oh Lord, to give a word, Lord
[8:27] Jesus Christ, may it may it go deep
[8:30] within our souls and take root, Lord
[8:32] God. Lord, in your love, oh Lord God. Oh
[8:35] Lord, we're trying to build our faith,
[8:37] oh Lord. Lord, we're trying to hang on
[8:39] to hope, oh Lord God. But the prophet
[8:41] said if we would just fall more in love
[8:43] with you, love would produce faith.
[8:46] It'll produce hope, oh Lord God, it will
[8:48] produce these things, oh Lord God. Lord,
[8:50] help us have a closer walk with you, oh
[8:52] Lord God. Lord, we may not understand
[8:55] why we go through the things we do, oh
[8:56] Lord God. Lord, we may not understand
[8:58] that while we're when we're going
[9:00] through different things and we pray and
[9:01] you don't hear and you don't you don't
[9:03] answer us right away, oh Lord, Lord, we
[9:05] don't understand, Lord God. Oh Lord, we
[9:08] can still love you, oh Lord God. We can
[9:10] still praise you, Lord. We can still
[9:12] worship you, oh Lord God. And so here we
[9:14] are gathered, oh Lord, to lift your name
[9:16] up, oh Lord. The one true God, the one
[9:20] that was worthy, oh Lord, the one that
[9:22] was that that that died a death. He
[9:24] didn't. You didn't deserve it, oh Lord
[9:26] Jesus Christ. You took our place, oh
[9:28] Lord God. So Lord, we just want to thank
[9:30] you, oh Lord God. Lord, we want to say a
[9:32] special prayer for the mothers, oh Lord
[9:34] Jesus Christ. Lord, bless each one of
[9:37] them, oh Lord Jesus Christ, for the
[9:39] sacrifice, oh Lord God. We tend to
[9:42] always uh focus on uh the men, but the
[9:45] the uh the Bible says that you're both
[9:47] male and female, Lord Jesus Christ.
[9:50] Everybody has a role, oh Lord God. Every
[9:52] has a everybody has a place with this
[9:54] side. Lord, be with the ministers who
[9:57] brings the word, oh Lord God, and be
[9:58] with the the musicians, oh Lord God. May
[10:01] you accept our praise, oh Lord. Be with
[10:03] the sound equipment, oh Lord Jesus
[10:05] Christ. If there's someone on the
[10:06] stream, oh Lord, that needs a word from
[10:08] you, oh Lord God, may it reach them, oh
[10:10] Lord Jesus Christ. Lord, we just want to

[10:13] faithfulness. Lord, we just want to
[10:15] thank you for your everlasting love for

[31:01] recall. They're borrow for a
[31:06] [Music]
[31:08] while. In all the
[31:11] things of us that cause her
[31:18] trouble,
[31:19] remember
[31:21] there will only be a smile.
[31:29] But until
[31:31] then, my heart will go on
[31:38] singing. Until
[31:41] then, with joy I'll carry
[31:47] on. Until the
[31:51] day, my eyes behold the city.
[31:58] until the
[32:01] day God
[32:03] calls me home.
[32:06] [Music]
[32:08] This weery
[32:11] world with all its toll and
[32:17] struggle may take its
[32:21] toll of
[32:23] misery and
[32:27] strife. The soul of
[32:31] men is like a waiting
[32:36] eagle when it's
[32:40] released is destined for the sky.
[32:47] Oh, but until
[32:50] then my heart will go on
[32:56] [Music]
[32:57] singing. Until
[33:00] then, with joy I'll carry
[33:06] on until the day.
[33:11] My eyes behold the
[33:16] city until the
[33:19] day God
[33:22] calls me
[33:25] home. Oh, but until
[33:29] then my heart will go on singing.
[33:36] But until
[33:39] then, with joy I'll carry
[33:45] on until the
[33:49] day. My eyes behold the
[33:55] city. Until the
[33:58] day, God
[34:01] calls me
[34:04] home. Until the
[34:08] day my eyes behind.
[34:15] until the
[34:18] day. God
[34:20] calls me
[34:24] home. Until the
[34:27] day my eyes be
[34:31] open to
[34:33] see until the
[34:37] day God
[34:39] calls me
[34:51] home. Praise the Lord. I love the words
[34:54] to that song. It means so much. Until
[34:58] then, we'll keep pressing on. It won't
[35:00] be long. Amen. I was speaking with
[35:03] brother Quinton back in the back, you
[35:05] know, talking about this new
[35:07] pope and we realized that it's is right
[35:10] at hand. You know, in December of
[35:15] 1954, Brother Brandham made that
[35:17] prophecy about the pope coming out of
[35:20] America.
[35:21] [Music]
[35:23] September the 14th, 1955. 9 months
[35:27] later, the man was
[35:29] [Music]
[35:32] born. 9 months
[35:34] later, the man that's there now was
[35:38] born. God's prophet don't miss. God
[35:42] doesn't miss. Amen. Amen. He knew that
[35:45] he was coming on the scene. Amen. Praise
[35:49] the Lord. May I have the announcement,
[35:50] sister? I don't think we have any prayer
[35:52] requests. We want to continue to pray

[35:58] with us. Amen. Praise the Lord. We want

[36:27] thought that uh nobody could love my
[36:30] children like I do. But the prophet of
[36:32] God said, "The closest love to God's
[36:35] love is a mother's love." So, I knew I
[36:37] was
[36:38] wrong. Naomi got me beat. Praise the
[36:42] Lord. But happy Mother's Day. Praise the
[36:44] Lord. Today is Sister Isabella's

[39:33] you, to be more like you, Lord. Father,
[39:36] we need a refilling of the Holy Ghost,
[39:38] Lord. And Father, we just ask that you
[39:41] would shower down upon us, Lord, even
[39:43] now. Father, we want to thank you for

[39:48] Jesus. Lord, it help mold us to the
[39:50] people that we are. And Lord, we're
[39:53] we're just so grateful, Lord, for those
[39:55] who are still with us, Lord. We pray a
[39:58] special blessing to them. May they see
[40:00] their heart's desire, Lord, come to
[40:02] pass. Those, Lord Jesus, who desire that
[40:05] the family will won't be broken, Lord
[40:07] Jesus, that all of their children will
[40:09] come to the faith or be restored to the
[40:12] faith, Lord Jesus. Grant their heart's
[40:14] desire, Lord, for those who desire,
[40:16] Lord, to be mothers, Lord. Blessed them
[40:19] Lord abundantly Lord Jesus is our
[40:21] sincere prayer. Father, be with one of
[40:24] our mothers, Sister Dixon, where she is,
[40:26] Lord. Touch her body, Lord. Give her a
[40:29] complete restoration, Lord Jesus. Heal
[40:31] her body, Lord Jesus. May she come,
[40:33] Lord, dancing in the sanctuary once
[40:36] again as she does, raising those hands,
[40:38] singing the praises of God, Lord. It
[40:40] encourages us, Lord Jesus. So, we pray
[40:43] that you will bless her where she is,
[40:44] and let her know that she's loved and
[40:46] that we have covered her with prayer,
[40:47] Lord Jesus. Be with Brother Jean, Lord.
[40:50] No doubt, Lord God, he he's back to his
[40:53] old self, Lord Jesus. And we pray a
[40:55] special blessing upon him. A complete
[40:57] restoration, Lord. A complete reversal
[41:00] from the stroke, Lord Jesus. Bless him
[41:02] indeed. Lord, be with our pastor, all of
[41:04] our brothers and sisters that could not
[41:06] be be here with us, all those online,
[41:08] Lord. Continue to have your way in the
[41:10] sanctuary, Father. Touch Brother Jerry,
[41:12] Lord. Help them, Lord, as he makes ready
[41:15] to bring the word of life to your
[41:16] people, Lord. Oh father, we believe Lord
[41:19] Jesus that you have a word for us each
[41:21] one. Father, we pray now your blessings
[41:24] upon our giving. Lord, you told us to
[41:26] bring into the storehouse and you would
[41:28] open the windows of heaven and pour our
[41:29] blessings that there would not be room
[41:31] enough to contain it that you would
[41:33] rebuke the devourer for our sake. We
[41:35] have done our part, Lord Jesus, and we
[41:37] know that you will fulfill yours, Lord.
[41:39] We thank you for every blessing. It's in
[41:41] Jesus Christ's precious and holy name we
[41:43] pray. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[41:47] Sister Shondaanda, will you

[42:16] God bless you. Um I just uh first want
[42:19] to say I hope my mom is watching. Um but
[42:22] I just thank God for her. Um she as we

[42:33] kids of the neighborhood always came.

[43:27] [Music]
[43:30] You can't see
[43:32] ahead the danger lurking
[43:37] there. If you're not being
[43:41] fed, then you can't
[43:45] prepare. The squeeze is coming
[43:48] down and I may not be around. I gotta
[43:54] make sure you're ready when he
[44:01] calls. Listen, my
[44:05] [Applause]
[44:07] child. I've got to let you
[44:10] know we're being
[44:15] changed. And away with him will go.
[44:20] There is no time to
[44:24] waste. We've got to run this race with
[44:28] haste. I got to make sure you're ready
[44:34] when he
[44:38] comes. You can't see
[44:42] ahead the danger lurking there.
[44:47] [Music]
[44:48] If you're not being
[44:51] fed, then you can't
[44:56] prepare. The squeeze is coming
[44:59] down and I may not be around. I got to
[45:05] make sure you're ready when he
[45:12] calls. Listen, my child.
[45:19] I've got to let you
[45:21] know we're being

[46:21] my mother's heart. Amen. They don't want
[46:24] the family will to be broken on that
[46:26] day. I want to make sure their children
[46:28] are ready when Jesus comes. Amen. Will

[46:36] sang it
[46:37] sometime. Praise the Lord. Will you all
[46:39] stand to your
[46:43] feet? Amen. We want to thank the Lord

[47:04] Amen. God bless you. Amen. We're going
[47:05] to invite Brother Jerry to come at this
[47:08] at this time. Let's sing Amazing Grace.
[47:10] How sweet the sound as Brother Jerry
[47:12] comes this morning.
[47:15] [Music]
[47:19] Amazing
[47:21] grace, how
[47:25] sweet the
[47:29] sound that
[47:32] [Music]
[47:36] say like
[47:44] Oh, I
[47:47] once was
[47:50] lost, but now
[48:02] [Music]
[48:13] God bless you. Blessed mine word of
[48:17] prayer. Oh precious heavenly
[48:20] father. Lord Jesus, we thank you God for
[48:23] this great and mighty time that we're in
[48:28] Lord. Father God, not everybody could
[48:30] say they can be in the presence of the
[48:32] Lord. But God, we can say this morning
[48:36] that we are in the presence of the
[48:39] Lord. Oh, Father God, your scripture
[48:42] says, "Oh, magnify the Lord with me and
[48:46] let us exalt his name
[48:49] together." Father God, I believe we have
[48:52] exalted your name this morning. We have
[48:55] exalted your name above all. We have
[48:58] exalted your names above how we feel. We
[49:01] have exalted your name above what we are
[49:03] going through. And Father, we are under
[49:06] expectation this morning, Lord. That
[49:09] that name that has been exalted would
[49:11] come down, oh Father
[49:13] God, and just prove once again, Lord,
[49:16] that you are the same yesterday, today,
[49:18] and
[49:19] forever. Oh, heavenly father, may you
[49:22] have the preeminence now, Lord. May you,
[49:25] Father, circumcise the hearts of your
[49:27] people, Lord, in my lips, oh Father God,
[49:29] that I may be a vessel unto you, Lord,
[49:32] that you can use to speak the things
[49:34] that are eternal to your people. Father
[49:37] God, I pray you have your way, oh Lord.
[49:39] Speak to those that are watching online,
[49:40] Lord. Those that are far and near,
[49:42] Father God, may you have a word for them
[49:45] that is in due season. Father, we thank
[49:48] you now and we ask for your anointing.
[49:50] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we
[49:52] pray. Amen.
[49:54] God bless you church. I greet you all in
[49:57] the precious name of the Lord Jesus
[50:00] Christ. I'm very honored and privileged
[50:03] to be before you. Uh it's a wonderful,
[50:06] wonderful day. Uh but this day is even
[50:09] more special because I have my own
[50:11] mother here and uh praise the
[50:16] Lord and I say happy Mother's Day to you
[50:20] mothers. Uh it is truly uh for me I grew
[50:24] up uh I I probably touched a little bit
[50:27] on this but um I would be what you would
[50:30] call a mama's boy. Uh I love my dad but
[50:35] mama just has a special place in my
[50:36] heart. So I with the with the with the
[50:41] thought of today uh hopefully uh Lord
[50:43] willing we just uh look to encourage the
[50:45] mothers here this morning. And how many
[50:48] believes that we have the oldtime
[50:50] mother, the breasted God, the El Shadia.
[50:53] Is that right? Praise the Lord. So, if
[50:55] you will, like to turn our Bibles this
[50:58] morning to a few
[51:02] scriptures, Proverbs chapter 3 verse 15-
[51:09] 18. And we'll also read in Proverbs
[51:14] 31 28- 29.
[51:18] Praise the
[51:21] Lord. Say amen when you're there.
[51:25] And uh just before we start the reading,
[51:27] it looks like our precious brother
[51:28] Solomon had a release on that song
[51:31] earlier. Uh so I pray that God will give
[51:35] us that same release in this in this
[51:37] time.
[51:39] So the scripture reads, "She is more
[51:42] precious than rubies, and all things
[51:45] that thou canst desire are not to be
[51:48] compared unto her. Length of days is in
[51:52] her right hand, and in her left hand
[51:55] riches and honor. Her ways are ways of
[51:58] pleasantness, and all her paths are
[52:01] peace. She is tree of life to them that
[52:04] lay hold upon her. And happy is everyone
[52:08] that retainth her. And Proverbs 31 28
[52:13] reads, "Her children arise up and call
[52:17] her blessed." Amen. Her husband also,
[52:20] and he praiseth her. Many daughters have
[52:23] done virtuously, but thou excelst them
[52:27] all. Praise the Lord. You may all have
[52:29] your seats. May the Lord add a blessing
[52:31] to his
[52:33] reading. And as you had might have seen
[52:36] as a title this morning, I just want to
[52:38] use a mother's reward.
[52:41] A mother's reward. And as a subtitle, we
[52:44] want to key in on the greatness of
[52:47] motherhood. The greatness of motherhood.
[52:50] Now, how many believe that motherhood
[52:52] should not just be celebrated one day,
[52:55] but every day? Every day should be
[52:58] Mother's Day.
[52:59] It's a great honor and privilege. Uh but
[53:03] you know through the scriptures you know
[53:04] I believe God allows us to see how
[53:06] special a mother is and our brother
[53:09] mentioned earlier how the love of God
[53:11] the closest thing to it is a mother's
[53:14] love to her child. So we'll start with
[53:16] this quote here. The prophet goes to say
[53:19] now friends I know them each one is the
[53:23] prettiest baby in the world. I know
[53:25] that. I know better than to say anything
[53:28] else about that. And that's the way you
[53:31] should feel. There are little treasures
[53:33] that God has given you the
[53:34] responsibility of raising. And I've
[53:37] always said and made this kind of saying
[53:39] to mothers, we know written of the four
[53:42] gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
[53:45] But there is a fifth gospel unwritten.
[53:48] That's mother. She gets them before
[53:50] Matthew. Mark, Luke, and John's
[53:53] teachings gets them. So the
[53:55] responsibility is placed upon you
[53:57] mothers and you fathers to raise these
[53:59] children for the kingdom of God. And I'm
[54:02] sure that's your heart's desire. Praise
[54:05] the Lord. So you see a mother has a
[54:07] special responsibility, right? And uh
[54:10] believe someone mentioned brother DJ was
[54:12] here. I I don't know if this DJ I know.
[54:14] Oh, God bless you, my brother. Good to
[54:16] see you. So the mother has a special
[54:18] responsibility and it's it's one that
[54:21] certainly can't be overlooked. uh one of
[54:24] the greatest times of this the history
[54:26] of this world what the prophet called
[54:28] the golden age uh it was the attribute
[54:31] of a true mother that was used to set
[54:33] the foundation for what would be the
[54:36] greatest time of of our of our history
[54:39] uh up until now. Uh so we want to pick
[54:42] this up in the book of first kings
[54:44] chapter 3 and verse 24. Uh but it just
[54:48] shows how important motherhood is and uh
[54:52] in this time we can see the the very
[54:54] king that was appointed was King
[54:56] Solomon. Uh but it was uh it was a
[55:00] decision that he had to make. Uh and it
[55:03] was a strategic decision because the
[55:05] purpose of it all was to point out what
[55:08] true motherhood is. So we read this in
[55:11] verse 24. It says, "And the king said,
[55:14] um, bring me a sword." And they brought
[55:17] a sword before the king. And as you all
[55:20] know the background of this story, this
[55:23] was two mothers where one of the mothers
[55:26] happened overnight to lay upon her
[55:27] child. The child uh died and the other
[55:30] child lived. And this other mother uh
[55:34] had such a a desire for her child to
[55:37] live. So she decided to plot this to
[55:40] create this situation to create this
[55:42] problem so that she can uh uh uh get the
[55:45] other mother's child. Uh so the king the
[55:48] this was brought to the king's attention
[55:50] and the the king with the wisdom that
[55:52] God gave him uh decided to go about it
[55:55] this way. Verse 25 says and the king
[55:58] said divide the living child in two
[56:01] right and give one half to the one and
[56:04] the other half to the other. Then spake
[56:06] the woman whose the living child was
[56:08] unto the king, for her bowels yarn upon
[56:12] her son. And she said, "Oh my lord, give
[56:15] the living child and no wise slay it."
[56:18] But the other said, "Let it be neither
[56:20] mine nor thine but divided." So you see,
[56:24] truth has a way of prevailing
[56:28] in any situation. And the thing about
[56:30] truth is that it's unseen because you
[56:33] have to truly uh uh uh believe in
[56:36] something that you have no control over.
[56:39] You see, and this mother was willing to
[56:41] let the very thing that was precious to
[56:43] her, she was willing to let it go. Is
[56:45] that right? Yes, sir. So, it goes on to
[56:47] say, "And the king said, king answered
[56:50] and said, give her the living child and
[56:54] in know why I slay it. She is the mother
[56:57] thereof. And all the Israel heard the
[57:00] judgment which the king had judged. And
[57:02] they feared the king, for they saw that
[57:04] the wisdom of God was in him to do
[57:06] judgment. So this started this great uh
[57:10] this this great attention that God was
[57:12] doing something great, right? Because of
[57:15] the wisdom of God in that hour. But you
[57:18] see, it was the it was it was the uh uh
[57:20] focus on what a true mother would do for
[57:23] her child. And you see this false mother
[57:25] is like the world if I could put it this
[57:27] way. She creates a problem so she can
[57:30] manufacture a solution. And that's what
[57:33] this world does. This world creates a
[57:35] whole lot of problems. But when you
[57:37] manufacture something, it only causes
[57:39] more pain. It only causes more hurt. It
[57:42] only causes more sorrow. So at the end
[57:45] of the day, this mother had to live with
[57:46] the reality of knowing that her son was
[57:49] dead. But because the true mother
[57:52] decided to act in faith, she was her son
[57:55] was restored back unto her. Hallelujah.
[57:57] Praise the Lord. So I like that in the
[58:00] midst of death, she became life to her
[58:02] son. Praise the Lord. And the reward
[58:05] that she received in this instance was
[58:07] the life of her son. So I want to read a
[58:10] few quotes uh from uh some Jewish
[58:14] traditional proverbs. And these quotes
[58:17] uh just kind of want to they're they're
[58:19] meant for mothers. And uh as I read
[58:22] them, I also want to read just another
[58:24] quote just the Lord that is uh that has
[58:26] inspired of me to to also add here as
[58:29] well. So the first quote that I have is
[58:31] God could not be everywhere so he
[58:34] created mothers. That's a Jewish
[58:36] proverb. I'm going say it again. God
[58:38] could not be everywhere so he created
[58:41] mothers. And and by reading this, I was
[58:44] just inspired to say a mother's love
[58:46] fills every empty space, right? And and
[58:49] we'll go ahead and see how God allows
[58:51] this to come to pass in the in the
[58:54] unique of ways. Praise the Lord. Because
[58:57] a mother is God's special agent. God has
[59:00] a way of using mothers to reach places
[59:02] other people can't. Is that right? Their
[59:05] care will reach places that you can't.
[59:07] their compassion, their gentleness,
[59:09] their patience, their longsuffering. All
[59:12] these things are things that mothers can
[59:15] attributes of mothers that can reach
[59:16] other places that other men can't reach
[59:20] sometimes. Praise the Lord. And and and
[59:22] you know, the nature of motherhood is is
[59:24] one that God often time uses to express
[59:27] his love, care, and compassion. We can
[59:30] see that through his word. So as we
[59:33] continue here, we want to turn to the
[59:34] book of Isaiah in uh 66:12. It says,
[59:39] "For thus sayeth the Lord, behold, I
[59:43] will extend peace to her like a river."
[59:48] So mothers, I want to encourage you this
[59:50] morning that because of what you do,
[59:53] because of what you sacrifice on a daily
[59:55] basis, day and night, God has a promise
[59:58] to you that he will extend your peace.
[1:00:01] Praise the Lord. He will not just give
[1:00:03] you peace but extended peace. Is that
[1:00:05] right? And one of the things I like
[1:00:07] about this is when you have extended
[1:00:11] peace, you can expect your children to
[1:00:13] also have extended peace. Praise the
[1:00:16] Lord. And I just believe that your
[1:00:18] children can't go beyond that which God
[1:00:20] has extended to you. If God has extended
[1:00:23] to you peace, then your children can
[1:00:26] only go so far. Amen.
[1:00:29] Praise the Lord. You know, there was a
[1:00:31] Solomon that remembered the instructions
[1:00:33] of his mother, right? And there was a
[1:00:35] Moses that refused to be called the
[1:00:39] children of of the daughter the the son
[1:00:41] of do the daughter of Pharaoh. Is that
[1:00:42] right? So, he didn't just make a choice
[1:00:44] to choose God. He he actually had to
[1:00:46] refuse the beauty that was before him.
[1:00:50] And it was because what his mother has
[1:00:52] instilled in him. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:00:55] Come on, brother Jerry. So it says I
[1:00:58] will extend peace unto her like a river.
[1:01:02] And you know that word river represents
[1:01:04] life, prosperity and peace. So you can
[1:01:07] expect that. And it says in the glory of
[1:01:09] the Gentiles like a flowing stream. So
[1:01:12] the glory of the Gentiles, wealth,
[1:01:14] honor, and a overflow of blessings.
[1:01:17] Praise the Lord. And they shall then
[1:01:20] shall ye suck and ye shall be born upon
[1:01:23] her sides and be dandled upon her knees.
[1:01:26] As one of whom his mother comforted, so
[1:01:29] will I comfort you. And ye shall be
[1:01:31] comforted in Jerusalem. And when you see
[1:01:34] this, your heart shall rejoice and your
[1:01:36] bones shall flourish like an herb. And
[1:01:38] the hand of the Lord shall be known
[1:01:41] toward his servants and his indignation
[1:01:43] toward his enemies. So mothers, God has
[1:01:46] given you a reward to have peace
[1:01:48] regardless of what the situation is. You
[1:01:50] can go to you can go to bed at night
[1:01:52] knowing that you have peace. You can
[1:01:55] wake up in the morning knowing that you
[1:01:56] have peace. And not just peace, but
[1:01:59] extended peace, which means when your
[1:02:01] peace run out, there's just a little bit
[1:02:03] more for you to get. Is that right? So
[1:02:06] you can enjoy and dwell in that extended
[1:02:08] peace. Praise God. Amen. You know, with
[1:02:13] my mother, I I I always in our home
[1:02:16] growing up, it it it of course we had
[1:02:20] everybody had their own rooms and the
[1:02:22] living room. The living room was off
[1:02:24] limits, you know.
[1:02:27] Uh so so we we only had a few places we
[1:02:30] can go. Of course, we have the patio,
[1:02:32] but there was just something special
[1:02:34] about mother's room. And you can go to
[1:02:37] mother's room and you can just find
[1:02:39] things there that you just where was
[1:02:40] this this whole time? You'll find
[1:02:42] wrapped gifts. You'll find different
[1:02:45] treasures. You and you'll just think,
[1:02:47] "Wow." And mother always locks her room
[1:02:50] because she knows there's treasure in
[1:02:52] her room. Amen. So, so you know, mother,
[1:02:55] when when it seems like things are
[1:02:57] running out, maybe in your room, there's
[1:02:59] a little bit more where mother
[1:03:01] is. When it seem like you don't have
[1:03:04] much left, you can go to mama for a
[1:03:07] little bit more cuz she's always has
[1:03:09] some. And don't get me started with
[1:03:11] going out and in and mama's handbag, she
[1:03:14] always has a little bit of food or
[1:03:15] snacks in her handbag.
[1:03:18] Mother is always prepared. Praise God.
[1:03:21] Amen.
[1:03:23] So,
[1:03:25] you
[1:03:26] know, the prophet had a had a time in
[1:03:30] his life when he the prophet loved
[1:03:32] hunting. That was his thing. That was
[1:03:34] his one of the things he did just to
[1:03:36] kind of get himself um uh really in
[1:03:39] fellowship with God in the in the woods.
[1:03:41] Uh but often times he would also go
[1:03:43] hunting with a few a few different
[1:03:45] folks. Uh but in particular, there was
[1:03:47] this man that he went hunting with. His
[1:03:49] name was called Bert Call. Bert Call.
[1:03:51] And uh he said Bert Carr was a real good
[1:03:54] man. Bert Carr was a nice man. He was a
[1:03:56] man of the woods. He could depend on
[1:03:58] Bert for almost anything cuz he was a a
[1:04:01] a expert there, you know. But he says
[1:04:04] Bert had a cruel heart. He just had a
[1:04:07] cruel heart and and it went so much so
[1:04:09] that he created this this little whistle
[1:04:12] that sounded just like a crying baby
[1:04:14] deer, you know. And and he went to the
[1:04:17] woods and he was with brother Brandham.
[1:04:18] And brother Brandham said, uh, you know,
[1:04:20] uh, they didn't think it was morning
[1:04:21] time and they didn't catch anything.
[1:04:23] They didn't find anything at all. But it
[1:04:25] came noon and they were eating lunch and
[1:04:27] he pulled this whistle out and brother
[1:04:29] Brandon says, "Bert, I know you're not
[1:04:30] going to use that. I know you're not
[1:04:32] going to do." But he started blowing it
[1:04:33] and it sound just like a mother's cry,
[1:04:36] just like a baby deer's cry. So, so he
[1:04:39] goes and he says, "Brother Brandham,
[1:04:40] your preachers are so chicken-hearted.
[1:04:42] That's the problem with you preachers,
[1:04:44] you know." But brother Brenam says, "No,
[1:04:46] it's it's it's not that. You just have
[1:04:47] to right to have to have the right
[1:04:49] attitude because you're you're you're
[1:04:50] you're not just you're you're trying to
[1:04:52] kill these these these these these baby
[1:04:55] deers and and we're not we're not here
[1:04:57] for that. Uh you know, you can kill one
[1:04:58] of them, but to just kill them for fun,
[1:05:00] that's not the way it goes. So anyhow,
[1:05:02] brother Brandham goes on to say here in
[1:05:04] the message the mother's dear um uh
[1:05:06] hearing him about this mother dear. So
[1:05:10] he says he pulled this little whistle
[1:05:12] out. He says, "I thought, oh my." And he
[1:05:14] cried like the baby, the little baby
[1:05:16] fawn crying for its mammy. And when he
[1:05:19] uh gave this cry just across the way,
[1:05:21] about 40 yards away. Oh, hardly so far.
[1:05:24] A big mother though. That's the mother
[1:05:26] deer. Stood up. Oh, she looked
[1:05:29] beautiful. Great big ears, big brown
[1:05:31] eyes, big veins in her face. Why? I was
[1:05:34] looking right at her. What was it? She
[1:05:37] heard a baby cry. She by nature was a
[1:05:40] mother. She wasn't a hypocrite. She was
[1:05:42] a mother. She wouldn't raise up at any
[1:05:45] other time. What did she do? Oh, Bird. I
[1:05:48] looked at uh Bert looked at me with the
[1:05:50] sheepest grin and he pulled back the
[1:05:52] bolt on the rifle and throw the shell up
[1:05:54] onto the chamber and he was uh cracked
[1:05:57] shot. I seen him level down the scope,
[1:05:59] then crossed hairs across that mother's
[1:06:02] heart. And she here she come walking out
[1:06:05] into the open looking. She never walk in
[1:06:08] that open in any other way. She was
[1:06:11] scared. But what was it? She was a
[1:06:14] mother. The baby was crying. Where he's
[1:06:16] at, he's in trouble. She'd take a
[1:06:19] chance. And mothers will always take a
[1:06:22] chance for her baby regardless of the
[1:06:24] situation. Amen. Praise God. It goes on
[1:06:26] to say, "She walked right into the open
[1:06:29] and I seen her turning sideways. When I
[1:06:32] seen that steady hand of Bert, I
[1:06:34] thought, oh God, don't let him do it.
[1:06:36] Oh, Bert, how can you be so cruel? that
[1:06:39] mama looking for her baby and you're
[1:06:41] going to blow her heart out. How can you
[1:06:43] be so wicked holding that rifle? I
[1:06:45] turned my head. I said under my voice, I
[1:06:47] said, "Lord, how can that man be so
[1:06:49] wicked? I know that in the touch of the
[1:06:51] trigger and that bullet will blow her
[1:06:53] heart, plum out of her." Then there she
[1:06:56] was. She saw the hunter. Did she stop?
[1:06:58] Did that stop her? No sir. Any other
[1:07:01] time she had been like Houdini, an
[1:07:03] escape artist, she had been gone. But
[1:07:05] what was it? She was a mother. Something
[1:07:07] in her, inside of her, meant more than
[1:07:10] life. Baby was in trouble. She was
[1:07:13] looking to see where that baby was. I
[1:07:15] waited and waited. The gun never went
[1:07:17] off. I looked around and there the wife,
[1:07:20] the rifle going like this. I looked at
[1:07:22] him, the tears was running down his
[1:07:24] cheeks. He threw the rifle on the ground
[1:07:26] and grabbed me around the legs and said,
[1:07:28] "Billy, I've had enough of it. I can't
[1:07:31] do it. God, be merciful to my wicked
[1:07:33] heart." right there in that snow drift.
[1:07:36] I led that cruelhearted man to Christ,
[1:07:38] which today he's roaming the woods up
[1:07:41] there, a real sweet, meek-hearted
[1:07:43] Christian. Why? Not because I was there,
[1:07:46] but because he's seen the display of a
[1:07:48] real love of not a hypocrite, not a
[1:07:51] pretending to be that that'll run at
[1:07:53] every little scare, but a real mother
[1:07:55] who could display a real genuine love.
[1:07:58] Praise the Lord. So we thank God for a
[1:08:01] mother that can genu that can that can
[1:08:04] produce such a love. And you know the
[1:08:06] thing about this love it it's not a it's
[1:08:08] not a love that you manufacture. It's
[1:08:10] not a love that you put on. You you are
[1:08:12] born with that because of what's in you.
[1:08:15] God has predestinated a certain material
[1:08:18] in you to have that kind of love for
[1:08:20] your children. Praise the Lord. So a
[1:08:23] woman's purpose is something that we
[1:08:25] want to look at here because it many
[1:08:28] people have different views of what a
[1:08:30] woman's purpose is, right? Especially
[1:08:33] when you when you come to a place of
[1:08:35] just really identifying woman. The world
[1:08:38] around us can't even identify what a
[1:08:40] woman is, right? Uh if you talk about
[1:08:43] what is a woman, they'll tell you a
[1:08:45] woman is is she or he and uh they'll
[1:08:48] have different names. So they're all
[1:08:51] over the place, but just 50 to 70 years
[1:08:53] ago, that wasn't even a question. So the
[1:08:57] thing about it is everyone wants to be
[1:08:59] either politically correct, culturally
[1:09:02] correct, right? They want to be socially
[1:09:04] correct. But I just like to ask, how
[1:09:06] about being biblically correct? Amen.
[1:09:09] How about how about being correct by
[1:09:11] what God has said? Right? And and I
[1:09:14] think if we can focus on what God has
[1:09:16] said, a lot of our a lot of our mothers
[1:09:18] today will understand the true value of
[1:09:21] being a mother and what it means to have
[1:09:24] that in their lives. Praise God.
[1:09:27] So, we want to go ahead and read this uh
[1:09:31] and um before we continue here, we'll
[1:09:34] just go real quick to Revelation 18. Um
[1:09:37] but you know when I think about
[1:09:39] womanhood uh I think about how God has
[1:09:43] uh chosen uh this specific nature for a
[1:09:48] woman to be clothed in. Right? God could
[1:09:51] have God God used a very a dear uh to
[1:09:54] have this type of nature that would
[1:09:56] attract a man to recognize what the love
[1:09:59] of God is. Praise the Lord. So, so I
[1:10:02] think it's important to note that God
[1:10:05] puts a lot of value on motherhood. God
[1:10:08] puts a lot of importance on a mother
[1:10:11] recognizing that that's her purpose.
[1:10:13] Amen. Because I don't believe that when
[1:10:16] you lose that, you you go to
[1:10:19] compromising. And when you compromise,
[1:10:21] you lose what it means to be a mother.
[1:10:24] Amen.
[1:10:25] So while you have mothers, we can see it
[1:10:28] all through scripture that God has
[1:10:30] promised will be blessed. God will have
[1:10:33] promised that he would seat uh sit
[1:10:36] seated on his right throne right next to
[1:10:38] him. Right? But you have mothers um that
[1:10:41] God had in his word has pronounced not
[1:10:44] only judgment but mothers where the
[1:10:47] Bible says God had remembered her
[1:10:48] iniquity. And we find this in Revelation
[1:10:51] 18 where it says, "For her sins have
[1:10:56] reached unto heaven, and God had
[1:10:58] remembered her iniquity. Reward her even
[1:11:02] as she rewarded you, and double unto
[1:11:04] her, doubling according to her works."
[1:11:08] So, so you have a different kind of
[1:11:10] mother here, right? A mother that is
[1:11:14] really building herself up instead of
[1:11:16] her children. a mother that's looking at
[1:11:19] what what's important to her versus what
[1:11:21] is important to her children. Right?
[1:11:24] This same mother, the Bible says says
[1:11:25] she sits as a queen and she has no need
[1:11:28] of nothing. Amen. So what's so what what
[1:11:34] what's so sad about this this this this
[1:11:36] reality is not that she's this kind of
[1:11:39] mother, but that she has children that
[1:11:42] is coming up under her. She has children
[1:11:45] that deems this to be normal or
[1:11:47] acceptable. Is that right? So you have a
[1:11:51] a line of of generations that is now
[1:11:54] being influenced by this kind of mother.
[1:11:57] And the Bible says that he remembered
[1:12:00] her iniquities. How much more will he
[1:12:02] remember her daughter's iniquities.
[1:12:05] Right? And he said, "Reward her even as
[1:12:08] she rewarded you." Praise the Lord. It
[1:12:11] goes on to say in verse 7, how much she
[1:12:13] has glorified herself and lived
[1:12:16] deliciously. So much torment and sorrow
[1:12:18] give her. For she said in her heart, I
[1:12:20] sit a queen and am no widow and shall
[1:12:23] see no sorrow. So I just want to
[1:12:26] encourage the maybe maybe uh whether
[1:12:28] it's the young people or maybe it's it's
[1:12:31] it's any individual that if you are
[1:12:33] under the wrong mother this morning, you
[1:12:35] can change motherhood. You can change
[1:12:38] mothers. You can go from the queen of
[1:12:40] heaven. Um, you can go from the queen of
[1:12:42] this of of this world that says she sits
[1:12:45] as a queen to the queen of heaven,
[1:12:46] right? To the very creator of heaven and
[1:12:49] earth. Praise the Lord. In verse four,
[1:12:53] it says, "And I heard another voice
[1:12:57] saying from heaven, come out of her, my
[1:13:00] people, that ye be not partakers of her
[1:13:03] sins, that ye receive not of her
[1:13:06] plagues." Praise the Lord. So, brother
[1:13:09] Brandham says this statement. He says,
[1:13:11] "A son of God can go a long time before
[1:13:14] he recognizes he is a son." Which means
[1:13:18] you might be under the wrong mother for
[1:13:21] a long time until you recognize that
[1:13:24] there is more for you at some point.
[1:13:27] There is more for you to do. Praise the
[1:13:30] Lord. And and I believe that when you
[1:13:33] hear that cry, it's important for you to
[1:13:36] take action towards it. Because when we
[1:13:39] come to church, it's not just another
[1:13:40] church service, right? It's it's not
[1:13:42] just for us to uh hear the voice of men,
[1:13:46] but it's to hear the voice of God.
[1:13:49] Right? Because that's that was the diff
[1:13:51] that was the difference between the
[1:13:53] eagle and the chicken is that the ego
[1:13:55] heard a cry and she had one thing to do.
[1:13:59] that was to jump a little higher. Yeah.
[1:14:02] If she could just jump a little higher,
[1:14:04] she would leave her earthbound condition
[1:14:06] and go to a heavenly place where she can
[1:14:09] be lifted up higher. Is that right?
[1:14:11] Amen. So, there's so many things that
[1:14:14] can keep you earthbound.
[1:14:16] Right? Your friends can keep you
[1:14:18] earthbound. Your job can keep you
[1:14:20] earthbound. Your career, whatever it is,
[1:14:22] these things can keep you earthbound.
[1:14:25] But God has a purpose for you. when you
[1:14:28] hear that cry for you to act upon it.
[1:14:31] Praise the Lord.
[1:14:34] Now, the prophet says this in a
[1:14:37] message, the eagle in her
[1:14:40] nest. He
[1:14:42] says, she said, "Just take the first
[1:14:45] jump and flop your wings." And he made
[1:14:48] the first jump and flopped his wings. He
[1:14:50] found out he wasn't earthbound anymore
[1:14:52] cuz he sat on a barnyard post right in
[1:14:55] the corner of a Pentecostal
[1:14:57] organization. His mother said, "Son,
[1:14:59] you've got to come higher than that or I
[1:15:01] can't get you. Just give another jump
[1:15:04] and I'll bear you up on my wings. If
[1:15:06] there's anything the church of the
[1:15:08] living God needs to do is another jump
[1:15:11] from all the barriers of denomination,
[1:15:13] from all isms, just cut loose every
[1:15:15] life, every line, and go free and jump.
[1:15:18] He will bear you away on the wings of a
[1:15:20] great speckled bird. Praise the Lord. So
[1:15:24] we want to continue
[1:15:26] here. A mother understands that her duty
[1:15:29] to love, to care, to have compassion is
[1:15:33] not an option but her calling. Is that
[1:15:35] right? She understand that she is the
[1:15:37] first voice and the last voice of
[1:15:40] compassion. Oh yeah. In 1 Timothy verse
[1:15:43] 2A 2:9 it says in like manner also that
[1:15:48] woman adorned themselves in modest
[1:15:50] apparel with same face facedness and
[1:15:53] subriity not with brooed hair or gold of
[1:15:55] pearls or costly array but which cometh
[1:15:59] woman professing godliness with good
[1:16:01] works. Let the woman learn in silence
[1:16:03] with all subjection. But I suffered not
[1:16:06] a woman to teach, nor to assurp
[1:16:08] authority over the man, but to be in
[1:16:10] silence. But for Adam was first formed,
[1:16:12] then Eve. And Adam was not deceived, but
[1:16:15] the woman being deceived was in the
[1:16:17] transgression. Notwithstanding, she
[1:16:20] shall be saved in childbearing, if they
[1:16:23] continue in faith, and charity, with
[1:16:25] holiness, and soy. So you see, a woman
[1:16:28] has a special purpose in just bringing
[1:16:31] forth child and being a mother, right?
[1:16:34] The Bible says she shall be saved in
[1:16:36] childbearing. Which means there's
[1:16:38] something that changes about you. You
[1:16:40] might not understand who you are now,
[1:16:42] but when you become a mother, there's
[1:16:45] certain things that that that releases
[1:16:47] unto you that God can bring out of you,
[1:16:49] attributes that has been hidden that God
[1:16:52] can use to show you the greater value of
[1:16:55] what your purpose is. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:16:59] Praise the Lord. The prophet says here,
[1:17:02] "The wife isn't saved by bearing a
[1:17:04] child." But let's turn now to uh 1
[1:17:07] Timothy 2:8. Just a minute and let's
[1:17:10] just find out what the Bible says about
[1:17:11] the child. Now, I realize that's a
[1:17:13] Catholic doctrine that the child that
[1:17:16] the Catholic says the woman is saved in
[1:17:17] childbearing by bearing a child. I don't
[1:17:20] believe that. Notwithstanding, she shall
[1:17:22] be saved and childbearing. He's not
[1:17:24] talking to the woman of the world having
[1:17:26] babies if he if she continues in faith.
[1:17:30] See, if she continues, she's already
[1:17:33] that's the woman he's talking about. The
[1:17:35] woman that's already saved in charity
[1:17:37] and holiness with all sri. And you see,
[1:17:40] I say this to our young sisters. You you
[1:17:43] you are in a great prime place of just
[1:17:47] being um in in in in this uh great uh
[1:17:51] congregation of where the truth is being
[1:17:53] taught to you where you can receive what
[1:17:56] it means for you to be a bride of
[1:17:58] Christ. You see, but you do have a
[1:18:01] responsibility to continue in that
[1:18:04] faith, to continue in that same line,
[1:18:07] right? because there's going to be many
[1:18:09] things that will tempt you, that will
[1:18:11] try to get you to uh to go off, but you
[1:18:14] have the responsibility as the Bible
[1:18:16] says here, if you can continue, you
[1:18:18] shall be saved. Praise the Lord. It goes
[1:18:21] on to say uh not by having a baby makes
[1:18:25] her save but because she is raising
[1:18:27] children doing her duty not raising
[1:18:29] cats, dogs or what more to take the
[1:18:31] place of a child as they do today.
[1:18:34] Giving it a mother's love so she can go
[1:18:36] out and run all around all night. Some
[1:18:39] people do that. Sorry, but they do it.
[1:18:42] That's awful rude for me to say, but
[1:18:44] it's the truth. They don't want a baby
[1:18:46] to be tied down with it. But in
[1:18:48] childbearing, if she continues in faith,
[1:18:50] holiness, and soy, she will be saved.
[1:18:54] Praise the Lord. So the next quote I
[1:18:56] want to just mention here is a mother's
[1:18:59] prayer pierces all gates. A mother's
[1:19:03] prayer pierces all gates. So you see, a
[1:19:05] mother's reward is a long list of
[1:19:09] answered prayers. I'm going to say that
[1:19:11] again. A mother's reward is a long list
[1:19:13] of answered prayers. So if you have a a
[1:19:16] things you've been praying for or things
[1:19:18] that you're eventually going to be
[1:19:20] praying for, God has remembered your
[1:19:24] prayers because it is a a long list of
[1:19:27] answered prayers. When the mother prays,
[1:19:29] there's something that just connects to
[1:19:31] God because she has a way of of of just
[1:19:34] connecting to that child or that need
[1:19:37] more than anyone else can. Praise the
[1:19:39] Lord. So a mother often times she just
[1:19:43] doesn't pray for her own child. She's
[1:19:45] praying for generations. She's praying
[1:19:47] for others situations that that child
[1:19:50] might not see. Amen. So a mother is is
[1:19:54] always on her knees praying. And when
[1:19:56] she prays, the prophet says that a woman
[1:20:00] that can pray um can do more than a
[1:20:04] minister that stands behind the pulpit
[1:20:05] sometimes for the kingdom of God. Praise
[1:20:07] the Lord. So, it shows how much power
[1:20:10] there is in a mother's prayer. Amen.
[1:20:13] Amen. Praise the Lord. We want to turn
[1:20:15] to Matthew 15 here, verse
[1:20:19] 22. It
[1:20:21] says, and we'll just look at a a
[1:20:24] mother's cry for her, for her child.
[1:20:27] And behold, a mother, a woman of Canaan,
[1:20:30] came out of the same coast, and cried
[1:20:32] unto him, saying, "Have mercy on me, O
[1:20:35] Lord, thou son of David. My daughter is
[1:20:38] grievously vexed with the devil." But he
[1:20:41] answered her not. And his disciples came
[1:20:43] and besought him, saying, "Send her
[1:20:45] away, for she crith after us." But he
[1:20:48] answered and said, "I am not sent but
[1:20:50] unto the lost sheep of the house of
[1:20:52] Israel." Then came she and worshiped
[1:20:55] him, saying, "Lord, help me." But he
[1:20:58] answered and said, "It is not meat to
[1:21:00] take the children's bread and cast it to
[1:21:03] dogs." And she said, "Truth, Lord, yet
[1:21:06] the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from
[1:21:09] the master's table." And I just like
[1:21:11] this mother's response because she was
[1:21:15] willing to accept, right, what was
[1:21:18] deemed to be no value, right? But
[1:21:22] because of what her need was, it
[1:21:25] produced something that no matter what
[1:21:28] she was going to get in return, her need
[1:21:31] was going to be met. Praise the Lord.
[1:21:34] And you know, I remember having this
[1:21:36] conversation one time with uh brother
[1:21:38] Simba. He said that Jesus was always
[1:21:41] like the comeback king. You know, he
[1:21:43] always had a comeback for almost
[1:21:45] anybody. But when this mother responded,
[1:21:48] "Truth, Lord, even the dogs eat the
[1:21:51] crumbs that falls from the master's
[1:21:53] table." You see, this was a response
[1:21:56] that Jesus was was looking at her and
[1:21:58] says, "Whoa, wait a minute. I have to
[1:22:01] give us a different response now, right?
[1:22:04] Because I have to change course. It's
[1:22:06] not just that the bread is for the
[1:22:08] children because the the the the bread
[1:22:09] is the healing for the children, but now
[1:22:11] I have to pay special attention to this
[1:22:14] mother's need." Praise the Lord. And
[1:22:16] goes to say, then Jesus answered and
[1:22:18] said unto her, Oh woman, great is thy
[1:22:21] faith. Be it unto thee, even as thou
[1:22:25] wilt. And her daughter was made whole
[1:22:27] from that very hour. Praise the Lord.
[1:22:30] And I just like how this whole thing
[1:22:32] played out because in today's world,
[1:22:35] many people are often looking for uh
[1:22:37] ways to experience greatness, right? You
[1:22:40] can look at your career to experience
[1:22:42] greatness. You can, if you're like me,
[1:22:44] you're looking at sports, right? And
[1:22:46] you're looking how you can experience
[1:22:47] greatness, right? They like to say the
[1:22:50] the greatest of all time. Praise the
[1:22:52] Lord. But this mother did something in
[1:22:55] the presence of the greatest of all
[1:22:57] eternity that would change her situation
[1:23:00] forever. Amen. And she was able to
[1:23:04] experience this because of what faith
[1:23:07] she had. Amen. And I just want you to
[1:23:10] understand saints that uh every time you
[1:23:13] see a praying mother you are
[1:23:14] experiencing greatness. Every time a
[1:23:17] mother goes to her knees, greatness is
[1:23:20] taking place. Praise the Lord.
[1:23:26] Now we want to continue
[1:23:29] here. Praise the
[1:23:35] Lord. All right. We want to
[1:23:40] read. Yeah. The prophet says, "A good
[1:23:43] praying wife or a mother can do more for
[1:23:45] the kingdom of God on her knees at home
[1:23:48] than sometimes the preacher can do on
[1:23:49] the platform." Praise God. So you see
[1:23:52] this mother was was was a special
[1:23:54] special type of mother, you know, and
[1:23:57] and I just like how she has this
[1:24:00] interaction with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:24:02] to where because of her of her position,
[1:24:05] she was able to get supernatural power
[1:24:08] from the crumbs that fell from the
[1:24:10] master's table. Amen. Now the prophet
[1:24:14] says in the message perseverant he says
[1:24:17] this poor little woman she had all kinds
[1:24:20] of things to hinder her when she got to
[1:24:22] Jesus he called her a dog it's not meat
[1:24:25] to take the children's food and cast it
[1:24:27] to dogs and watch if that had been one
[1:24:29] of us Pentecostals well I'd never go
[1:24:32] back here and hear that holy roller
[1:24:34] again. Yes sir. People was right. But
[1:24:37] what was it with her? Not her. She had a
[1:24:39] hold of faith. She had something that
[1:24:42] she was going to achieve. The healing of
[1:24:44] her daughter. No matter what she said,
[1:24:47] the truth and humility will always admit
[1:24:50] the truth is right. She said, "It's
[1:24:52] true, Lord. I am not of your people. I
[1:24:54] am not a Jew and I am nothing but a dog.
[1:24:57] That's exactly right, Lord. And it's not
[1:25:00] meat for you to take the children's
[1:25:02] bread and give it to dogs. But Lord, the
[1:25:04] dogs eat the crumbs under the children's
[1:25:06] table." She was only after crumbs. And
[1:25:10] we're not invited to crumbs. We're
[1:25:12] invited to the table. But she was after
[1:25:15] crumbs. Praise the Lord. And I want you
[1:25:18] uh young people to know that although
[1:25:20] this is Mother's Day, right? Uh uh still
[1:25:23] on the day like this, a mother's willing
[1:25:25] to put herself to the side and says, "I
[1:25:28] want my children to be fed. I want my
[1:25:30] children to be invited to the table."
[1:25:32] Right? A mother wants to be invited, but
[1:25:34] a mother is more concerned about her
[1:25:36] children being at the table. Praise the
[1:25:38] Lord.
[1:25:39] Amen. So, there's one thing that I like
[1:25:42] about this is that a mother has been
[1:25:45] inviting you all her life because of how
[1:25:47] she's nurtured you, because of how she's
[1:25:49] raised you. Praise the Lord. And and
[1:25:51] when you when you at the table, there
[1:25:53] might be gifts and certain gifts that
[1:25:55] you might not recognize. Uh but only
[1:25:58] when you have the right character and
[1:26:00] your the mothers are are trying to bring
[1:26:02] you to have the right character so the
[1:26:04] right so the right gift can come forth
[1:26:06] out of your life. Amen. But I want you
[1:26:09] to know that you might have a gift, but
[1:26:12] God has the package. And which means he
[1:26:15] has so much more where that gift comes
[1:26:17] from. So it's important to surrender and
[1:26:21] submit to the character that the mother
[1:26:23] is trying to bring out of you. Praise
[1:26:24] the Lord.
[1:26:26] Amen. The Bible says in Hebrews 11:6,
[1:26:29] for without faith, it is impossible to
[1:26:32] please him. For he that cometh to God
[1:26:34] must believe that he is and that he is a
[1:26:37] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:26:40] him. A mother is always diligently
[1:26:42] seeking the Lord. In Acts
[1:26:46] 16:31 it says, "And they said, believe
[1:26:49] on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt
[1:26:52] be saved and thy house." So mothers, you
[1:26:55] can apply the token to your home this
[1:26:58] morning. Whatever condition your home is
[1:27:00] in, wherever whether you have a wayward
[1:27:04] child, whatever that situation is, you
[1:27:06] have a promise for you to apply that
[1:27:08] token. And God is obligated to meet that
[1:27:11] token this morning. Is that right? The
[1:27:14] prophet says, "If you've got faith
[1:27:16] enough for your own self to be saved,
[1:27:18] have faith enough. No matter how weward
[1:27:20] that boy is or that girl is, they'll be
[1:27:23] saved anyhow."
[1:27:25] God somehow if he has to lay them on
[1:27:28] their back laying there in a hospital
[1:27:30] dying they'll be saved. God promised it
[1:27:34] the inheritance and they shall be there
[1:27:37] said Isaiah and all their offspring with
[1:27:39] them they shall not hurt nor destroy in
[1:27:42] my holy mountain say the Lord. Praise
[1:27:44] the Lord. This next
[1:27:47] quote from the Jewish proverb says a
[1:27:49] mother understands what a child does not
[1:27:52] say. A mother understand what a child
[1:27:54] does not save. And just want to say
[1:27:57] mother's reward is generational. It's
[1:28:00] eternal. So you a mother is one of those
[1:28:04] things and I've experienced this even
[1:28:05] with my wife as our children is growing
[1:28:08] up. Uh maybe even at the seventh or
[1:28:12] eighth month age, they'll start
[1:28:13] murmuring different things. And some way
[1:28:16] my my wife has a way of knowing what
[1:28:18] that child is saying. And I'm saying,
[1:28:20] how do you understand that's what that's
[1:28:22] what that child mean? That's what my
[1:28:23] daughter means. She just gets it because
[1:28:26] she has that connection with that child
[1:28:28] where she understands what that child
[1:28:30] either does not say or what that child
[1:28:33] is saying even if it's in a different
[1:28:34] language. Praise the Lord. So mother
[1:28:37] understands baby language very well.
[1:28:41] Amen. Praise the Lord. So Matthew
[1:28:44] chapter 4,
[1:28:46] uh we want to pick up these two sons.
[1:28:49] Um, and these two sons were called to be
[1:28:52] a follower of Jesus Christ, right? But
[1:28:55] there was a time in their lives where
[1:28:57] they had a certain desire. And in this
[1:29:01] desire, it was their mother that stepped
[1:29:04] in and and and asked of the Lord what
[1:29:06] that what that desire would be. So it
[1:29:09] says in 20 verse 21, and going from
[1:29:11] hence he saw other two brethren, James
[1:29:14] the son of Zebedee and John his brother
[1:29:16] in a ship with Zebedee their father
[1:29:18] mending their nets and he called them.
[1:29:22] Amen. This was the beginning of Jesus
[1:29:24] ministry. And in Matthew 20 20 it says,
[1:29:28] "Then came unto him the mother of
[1:29:30] Zebed's children with her sons
[1:29:32] worshiping him and desiring a certain
[1:29:35] thing of him. And he said unto her,
[1:29:38] "What wil thou?" She said unto him,
[1:29:40] "Grant that these my two sons may sit,
[1:29:44] the one on the right hand and the other
[1:29:46] on the left in thy kingdom." So this was
[1:29:49] a special request because this place
[1:29:53] that sister Zebedee was asking for
[1:29:55] wasn't even in existence yet. Right? So
[1:29:58] she had not only revelation but faith is
[1:30:01] the revelation. And because of that
[1:30:04] faith that she had, she was able to tap
[1:30:06] into something that was way far ahead of
[1:30:09] her. But you see, she wanted victory for
[1:30:12] her children. She wanted her children to
[1:30:14] have a life of overcoming power. Praise
[1:30:17] the Lord. And let's look at the response
[1:30:20] of Jesus. He says, "Ye know not what ye
[1:30:24] ask. Are you able to drink of the cup
[1:30:27] that I shall drink of, and to be
[1:30:29] baptized with the baptism that I am
[1:30:32] baptized with? They said unto him, we
[1:30:35] are able. This is James and John. And he
[1:30:38] said unto him, Ye shall indeed drink of
[1:30:40] my cup and be baptized with the baptism
[1:30:42] I am baptized with, but to sit on my
[1:30:45] right hand and on my left is not mine to
[1:30:48] give, but it shall be given to them for
[1:30:51] whom it is prepared of my father. Praise
[1:30:54] the Lord. If I could put it like this,
[1:30:56] the mother of James and John saw you
[1:30:59] because you are the ones that God has
[1:31:02] reserved that place to be s sitting on
[1:31:05] the right hand of God. Right? So the
[1:31:08] mother of James and John had a such a
[1:31:10] special desire for her children. And
[1:31:12] that's the thing about mothers is God
[1:31:15] has made them a way to be
[1:31:16] spiritual because they have a
[1:31:19] sensitivity that sometimes even the
[1:31:22] fathers are not quick to be added to. So
[1:31:25] they have a way of having that spiritual
[1:31:27] eyesight to see what God has required or
[1:31:31] what God is able to do in the midst of
[1:31:33] their situation. Right? Praise the Lord.
[1:31:36] Now in Revelation 3 21 it says to him
[1:31:41] that overcomemeth will I grant to sit
[1:31:45] with me in my throne even as I also
[1:31:47] overcame and am sat down with my father
[1:31:50] in his throne. Praise the Lord. So young
[1:31:53] people that is your mother's desire is
[1:31:56] for you to have a life of overcoming
[1:31:58] power. Is for you to have a life where
[1:32:00] no matter what the en enemy brings your
[1:32:02] way you can overcome. All right. And how
[1:32:06] do we overcome? We want to talk a little
[1:32:08] bit about this. And first John verse uh
[1:32:11] chapter 4 verse 2. It says, "Hereby we
[1:32:15] know ye the spirit of God. Every spirit
[1:32:19] that confesseth that Jesus Christ is
[1:32:21] come in the flesh is God." So let's stop
[1:32:25] here for a moment. It's important that
[1:32:27] you understand that God is come to be in
[1:32:31] your flesh in this hour, right? God is
[1:32:34] wanting to operate in your flesh. Right?
[1:32:37] The Bible says to who you yield your
[1:32:39] members to, that's whose servant you
[1:32:41] are. Is that right? So you have to yield
[1:32:44] your your members to God. God wants
[1:32:47] control of your mind. He wants control
[1:32:49] of your heart. He wants control of your
[1:32:51] hands. He wants control of your body. He
[1:32:54] wants control of your soul and spirit.
[1:32:56] Is that right? So the a mother is able
[1:32:59] to connect with that same desire that
[1:33:02] God has for you. Praise the Lord. It
[1:33:05] goes on to say in verse three, "And
[1:33:07] every spirit that confesseth not that
[1:33:09] Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not
[1:33:12] of God. And this is the spirit of
[1:33:15] Antichrist, whereof ye have heard that
[1:33:17] it should come, and even now already is
[1:33:20] in the world. Ye are of God, little
[1:33:23] children, and have overcome them." And
[1:33:26] this is the re this is the reason why
[1:33:27] you can overcome them. This is why God
[1:33:30] can call you an overcomer because he
[1:33:32] says greater is he that is in you than
[1:33:35] he that is in the world. So no matter
[1:33:37] where you go, who are you taking with
[1:33:39] you? You're taking greater that is in
[1:33:41] you with you. When you go to work,
[1:33:43] you're taking greater that is in you.
[1:33:46] When you're going to a friend's house,
[1:33:48] you're taking greater that is in you.
[1:33:50] When you're going to a little
[1:33:51] fellowship, you're taking greater that
[1:33:53] is in you. Right? because he is able to
[1:33:56] keep you in any situation. And that's
[1:33:59] your mother's desire this morning.
[1:34:01] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:34:04] Amen. The mother has a way uh of of of
[1:34:10] being satisfied. And and and and the way
[1:34:12] I have it here is the way to a mother's
[1:34:15] heart is a clean home, but the joy of
[1:34:17] her heart is all her children being
[1:34:19] there. So a mother's home must always be
[1:34:23] clean, right? If a mother's home is not
[1:34:26] clean, she won't sleep right. She won't
[1:34:30] operate right. I mean, you'll have all
[1:34:32] sorts of delays. Uh uh I mean, I've I've
[1:34:35] seen my mother stay up all night just to
[1:34:37] make sure the home was clean. Praise the
[1:34:40] Lord. But you see, in the home there,
[1:34:42] the spiritual tabernacle that the mother
[1:34:44] wants clean also. That is your
[1:34:47] tabernacle. The mother wants to make
[1:34:49] sure that your mind is clean, that your
[1:34:51] spirit is clean, that you're not
[1:34:53] defiling yourself with the things of
[1:34:55] this world. Is that right? The Bible
[1:34:58] says if you love the things of this
[1:35:00] world and the the things of the the love
[1:35:03] of God is not in you. Praise the Lord.
[1:35:05] So, mother wants you to have a clean
[1:35:07] home. Praise the Lord. And even when you
[1:35:09] move out of mother's home, mother wants
[1:35:11] your home to be clean. Praise the Lord.
[1:35:13] Mother will come and without even
[1:35:15] asking, she'll start brooming and
[1:35:17] sweeping and mopping and washing dishes
[1:35:20] because mother wants a clean home. Is
[1:35:22] that right? And mother wants your
[1:35:24] spiritual home to be clean as well.
[1:35:27] Praise the Lord. So you have to watch
[1:35:29] what you see, watch what you look at,
[1:35:30] watch what what watch what you hear,
[1:35:33] watch what you allow yourself to be
[1:35:35] privy to because mother wants you to
[1:35:37] have a clean home. Praise the Lord.
[1:35:39] Amen. Amen. and her joy is for at the
[1:35:42] end of the day for you to be there with
[1:35:44] her. Amen. Praise the Lord. So, we want
[1:35:48] to just touch a few mothers in the
[1:35:51] scripture that had uh just great
[1:35:53] sacrifices, right? Because, you know,
[1:35:56] mother goes through more than anybody
[1:35:58] else can see. Um and and and and they're
[1:36:01] the first to rise in the morning and the
[1:36:03] last to sleep at night many times.
[1:36:05] They're the first to be tired and the
[1:36:07] last to rest. So, so we want to just
[1:36:10] look at a few areas in the scripture.
[1:36:12] First one here is Hagar. I don't have a
[1:36:15] the scriptures for them, but Hagar was a
[1:36:18] single struggling mother in the
[1:36:20] wilderness. She was handpicked to be a
[1:36:23] concubine, but she was predestinated to
[1:36:25] be a mother. Amen. Sarah waited 90 years
[1:36:29] before she could become a mother and
[1:36:31] endured shame due to her barness.
[1:36:34] Joabed, the mother of Moses, gave up her
[1:36:37] son to the persecuting enemy. Hannah
[1:36:40] diligently prayed for her son and gave
[1:36:42] him back to the Lord. The widow of
[1:36:45] Zarapath in the midst of famine and gave
[1:36:48] up the very last meal she and her son
[1:36:50] had to eat the pro to feed the prophet
[1:36:53] Elijah. Mary had to watch Jesus, the son
[1:36:58] she bore, the the son that that she
[1:36:59] carried for nine months, watch him get
[1:37:02] crucified, whom she carried in the womb.
[1:37:05] Praise the Lord. So, mothers go through
[1:37:07] a lot. And when you consider all that a
[1:37:11] mother goes through, it can bring up a
[1:37:13] lot of questions. It can make it can
[1:37:15] sometimes even bring confusion. Right?
[1:37:18] Instead of asking why not me, you might
[1:37:20] say why me? Right? But I want you to
[1:37:22] know God has made you a special and a
[1:37:25] peculiar people. God has chosen you to
[1:37:28] stand the test. God has chosen you for a
[1:37:31] specific reason. Right? And with that
[1:37:33] question, the prophet says here in the
[1:37:35] message, Mother's Day, the question
[1:37:37] that's been in our minds is how can he
[1:37:40] do it? What would this somehow
[1:37:43] mysteriously they'll all fade away? The
[1:37:46] knots that's been tied in the back of
[1:37:48] our minds, will it be this? How could it
[1:37:51] be? Somehow or another, majestic fingers
[1:37:55] will just untangle, unravel those knots,
[1:37:58] and it'll all fade into one big crown of
[1:38:02] love. Praise the Lord. So, what an
[1:38:04] assurance you have this morning,
[1:38:06] mothers, to know that regardless of what
[1:38:08] the question is, even the soontobe
[1:38:10] mothers. Amen. You might ask yourself,
[1:38:13] why did I have to wait so long? But God
[1:38:16] says mysteriously the majestic fingers
[1:38:20] will unravel those knots, right? And it
[1:38:22] all fade into one big crown of love. Is
[1:38:26] that right? It says, "Then we shall see
[1:38:28] him. Then we shall be like him. Then we
[1:38:31] shall worship him. Then we shall see
[1:38:34] mother as God wants her." Mother would
[1:38:38] not be complete there without her
[1:38:39] family. Cuz the greatest time of all of
[1:38:42] her life is to see the children around
[1:38:45] the table and all of them healthy and
[1:38:48] happy and to see her pour out coffee or
[1:38:51] whatever she does and fix a supper and
[1:38:53] her and sit and dad sit down. Why?
[1:38:55] That's the happiest time in mama's life.
[1:38:58] See her kitties all at home now. Don't
[1:39:00] miss Don't be missing that day. And
[1:39:03] that's to the young people. Don't be
[1:39:06] missing that day. You know, young
[1:39:08] people, I just want to say it's not
[1:39:10] worth it to miss that date, right? No.
[1:39:13] No matter what the world seems to offer
[1:39:15] you, right? It might be a friend, it
[1:39:17] might be a boy, a girl, whatever it is,
[1:39:21] you can turn down that invitation cuz
[1:39:23] it's not worth it to miss it. Mother
[1:39:26] will not be complete. If you want mother
[1:39:28] to be complete, then you need to make
[1:39:29] sure you're there. Is that right? You
[1:39:32] need to make if you want you don't want
[1:39:33] to go there and see mother not complete
[1:39:36] because you didn't do your part. Is that
[1:39:38] right? So you have a part to play to
[1:39:41] stay in the straight and narrow path. Is
[1:39:43] that right? Praise God. The prophet goes
[1:39:47] on to say, "Let the great chain of your
[1:39:50] family be hooked together link by link."
[1:39:54] I'm going to say that again. Let the
[1:39:56] great chain of your family be hooked
[1:39:58] together link by link. Young people that
[1:40:01] have a family, a godly mother and a
[1:40:04] godly father that believes this message,
[1:40:08] I want you to know it's a special thing.
[1:40:10] See, I didn't grow up in this message. I
[1:40:13] grew up, my mother can testify, we grew
[1:40:16] up in a in a some
[1:40:19] semi-pentecostal denominational, right?
[1:40:22] And I was under a woman's ministry,
[1:40:24] right? My pastor was a woman, very
[1:40:27] gifted, very spiritual. Is that right?
[1:40:30] But as a young man, I was confused. And
[1:40:34] when I came to this message, God opened
[1:40:36] my eyes and I had brothers that I was
[1:40:40] that I got close to, brothers that I
[1:40:42] became connected to. Is that right? And
[1:40:44] I began to admire them because they grew
[1:40:47] up in the message. I began to look at
[1:40:49] them like, man, I wish I was you. You've
[1:40:52] had all this food all these years, and
[1:40:55] I'm just the newbie trying to catch up.
[1:40:57] Is that right? But you see, some of
[1:40:59] those brothers have turned away from
[1:41:02] this message. And and young people, you
[1:41:05] might be tempted to turn away, but I
[1:41:08] want you to know that regardless of what
[1:41:10] efforts your mother and dad is doing,
[1:41:13] this message is that message of this
[1:41:16] hour. Is that right? You have something
[1:41:19] to stand on that other people can't. Is
[1:41:22] that right? Hey, the the the the the
[1:41:24] brother just said how we have a 70 71-y
[1:41:27] old prophecy that just came to pass. Is
[1:41:30] that right? People might want to tamper
[1:41:32] with it, right? But we have a message
[1:41:34] that's undefeated. We have a message
[1:41:37] that's unstoppable. We have a message
[1:41:39] that's never missed a beat. Is that
[1:41:41] right? And it should be your desire this
[1:41:44] morning to uphold this message with
[1:41:47] everything that you have. Is that right?
[1:41:50] That's the mother's desire this morning.
[1:41:51] And if you want mother to really be
[1:41:54] rewarded, she'll be rewarded with your
[1:41:56] life. She'll be rewarded with the life
[1:41:59] that you surrender to the Lord Jesus
[1:42:02] Christ. Amen.
[1:42:04] Amen. In
[1:42:06] closing, I'll say this. In a message,
[1:42:09] the serminian church age, the prophet
[1:42:12] says, "Every time the Lord uses those
[1:42:14] words," fear not, there is an engagement
[1:42:18] at hand which will involve great danger
[1:42:21] and suffering and deprivation. Now, he
[1:42:24] does not say it in a blunt curt manner,
[1:42:27] tribulation is coming. That would
[1:42:29] frighten one. But like a mother who is
[1:42:31] about to turn out the light says gently
[1:42:33] to her child, lest he be frightened. Now
[1:42:36] don't you be afraid, for the light will
[1:42:38] go out and it will be dark. But remember
[1:42:41] that I am here with you. So he says,
[1:42:44] don't be afraid of man or woman of what
[1:42:47] man and woman can do to you. I am with
[1:42:50] you and my grace is sufficient for you.
[1:42:52] When you pass through the waters, they
[1:42:55] will not overflow you. Not even in death
[1:42:58] are you defeated, you are more than
[1:43:01] conquerors.
[1:43:03] Amen.
[1:43:05] And I want to just read a series of
[1:43:07] scriptures. Mothers, regardless of the
[1:43:10] situation, the prophet says every time
[1:43:12] you see those words, fear not. There is
[1:43:16] an engagement at hand. Hallelujah. So
[1:43:19] church, mothers, fear not. In Isaiah 54,
[1:43:23] it says, "Fear not, for thou shalt not
[1:43:26] be ashamed, for thou be thou confounded,
[1:43:29] uh, for thou shalt not be put to shame,
[1:43:32] for thou shalt forget the shame of thy
[1:43:34] youth, and shall not remember the
[1:43:36] reproach of thy widowhood anymore."
[1:43:40] Daniel 10:19, "Fear not. Peace be unto
[1:43:44] thee. Be strong. Yay, be strong." Exodus
[1:43:47] 20:20, "Fear not, for God is come to
[1:43:51] prove you." And that is his fear that he
[1:43:55] may go before your faces that ye sin
[1:43:57] not. Praise the Lord. Joel 202:21, "Fear
[1:44:01] not, O land. Be glad and rejoice for the
[1:44:05] Lord will do great things." How many
[1:44:08] believe that this morning? Judges 6:23,
[1:44:11] "Fear not, thou shalt not die."
[1:44:14] Ruth 3:11, "Fear not, I will do to thee
[1:44:18] all that thou requireest, for all the
[1:44:21] city of my people doth know that thou
[1:44:24] art a virtuous woman." Isaiah 41:13,
[1:44:28] "Fear not, I will help thee." Isaiah
[1:44:32] 43:1, "Fear not, for I have redeemed
[1:44:35] thee. I have called thee by thy name,
[1:44:38] thou art mine." Amen. Luke 8:50, "Fear
[1:44:41] not, believe only, and she shall be made
[1:44:45] whole." Luke 12:7, "But even in the very
[1:44:50] hairs of the the head of all, but even
[1:44:53] the very hairs of your head are all
[1:44:55] numbered. Fear not, therefore, ye are of
[1:44:58] more value than many sparrows." Praise
[1:45:02] the Lord. I really like that one because
[1:45:04] it goes to show that your actions can
[1:45:06] never outnumber the numbers of your the
[1:45:09] very hair that's numbered on your head.
[1:45:11] So regardless of how much trials come
[1:45:14] your way, God is saying to you, "Fear
[1:45:16] not, because you are more value in his
[1:45:19] eyes, you are precious in his eyes."
[1:45:23] Luke 12:32, "Fear not, little flock, for
[1:45:26] it is your father's good pleasure to
[1:45:28] give you the kingdom." Amen. And the
[1:45:31] last one here, Revelation 11:17, fear
[1:45:34] not. I am the first and the last. So the
[1:45:39] reason you can have peace at night, the
[1:45:42] reason you can rest is because there's
[1:45:44] one that rises before you. And there's
[1:45:46] one that goes to sleep after you, is
[1:45:48] that right? There's one that does not
[1:45:50] slumber, but he watches over you day and
[1:45:53] night. He is the first and the last. So
[1:45:57] you can take rest in that, saints. And
[1:45:59] mothers, when you're at home, you can
[1:46:02] fear not. When you're on the job, you
[1:46:05] can fear not. When you're at work,
[1:46:08] regardless of where it is, when you're
[1:46:09] on the road, you can fear not. Amen.
[1:46:12] He's the brakes when your brakes run
[1:46:14] out. He's the stop sign when you don't
[1:46:17] see one. He's the light when there is
[1:46:19] none. Amen. And he's the life when your
[1:46:22] life is done. Amen. Amen. And he's the
[1:46:25] keeper of your life when your children
[1:46:28] are gone. So regardless of what the
[1:46:31] situation is, fear not. Amen. Look at
[1:46:35] your neighbor and say, "Fear not." Fear
[1:46:37] not. Amen.
[1:46:40] So mothers, you have something to hold
[1:46:43] on to. And and and and young people, I
[1:46:46] want to remind you once again, if you
[1:46:48] want mother to be complete, make sure
[1:46:51] you're there. Amen. Make sure that
[1:46:54] nothing is stopping you from being there
[1:46:56] because that's mother's greatest desire.
[1:46:58] As much as we can celebrate Mother's
[1:47:00] Day, mother still wants her children to
[1:47:03] be recognized. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:47:06] God bless you. Amen.
[1:47:15] [Applause]
[1:47:17] Oh heavenly
[1:47:18] father, Lord Jesus, we thank you, oh
[1:47:21] God, for this great opportunity to
[1:47:24] minister into the purchase of your
[1:47:26] blood. Oh father god, you have reminded
[1:47:30] us once more, Lord, that we have nothing
[1:47:32] to fear. Father God, we see wayward
[1:47:35] children, yet we have nothing to fear.
[1:47:38] Father God, we see disobedience, yet we
[1:47:41] have nothing to fear. Father God, we see
[1:47:44] temptation rising in this generation,
[1:47:46] yet we have nothing to fear. Oh, Father,
[1:47:49] you said you are the first and the last.
[1:47:52] And Father God, we take great rest this
[1:47:54] morning, knowing that you have
[1:47:56] everything under control. Father God,
[1:47:58] you said it, Lord, that your ch our
[1:48:01] children's, Father, the the very
[1:48:03] children of our mothers cannot go beyond
[1:48:05] that which you've extended unto them,
[1:48:07] Lord, which is that peace that passes
[1:48:09] all understanding. So, Father God, I
[1:48:11] pray that you would continue to
[1:48:13] strengthen our mothers, Lord. Continue
[1:48:15] to uplift them, Father God. Continue to
[1:48:18] use them, Lord God, because they're the
[1:48:20] backbone of this church, Lord. They're
[1:48:22] the backbone of this nation, Father God.
[1:48:25] Lord, while the motherhood of this world
[1:48:27] is failing, oh God, but we know true
[1:48:30] motherhood through your word has pre is
[1:48:32] prevailing, oh God, where we can hear
[1:48:34] the crying of that mother eagle, Father,
[1:48:36] to say, "Come out and come up." And
[1:48:39] Lord, we can hear that cry, Father, and
[1:48:41] we can jump a little higher, Father God.
[1:48:44] So Lord, may you cause us to jump even
[1:48:46] higher than where we are, Father. Jump
[1:48:48] to higher grounds, Lord. jump to higher
[1:48:51] heights, Father God, where we can hear,
[1:48:54] oh Lord, you speak to us from lip to
[1:48:56] ear, Father God. Lord, we pray that you
[1:48:58] would bless our children, Father God.
[1:49:00] Bless each young one, Father God. Lord,
[1:49:03] we know it's a evil age, Lord God. And
[1:49:06] God, the God of this evil age is is
[1:49:09] doing a a chaos, Lord. He he he is
[1:49:11] creating havoc all over, Father God. But
[1:49:14] Lord, you said the gates of hell would
[1:49:16] not prevail, Father God. You promised
[1:49:19] that, Lord God. So, Lord, we stand on
[1:49:21] your promises this morning, Lord,
[1:49:23] believing that our children will
[1:49:26] experience that great victory of
[1:49:28] overcoming, Lord God, because greater is
[1:49:31] he that is in them, than he that is in
[1:49:33] the world, Father God. So, Lord, let our
[1:49:36] mothers take courage, Lord. Let our
[1:49:38] mothers take comfort, Lord God, knowing
[1:49:40] that greater is he that is in them than
[1:49:43] he that is in the world. Oh, Father,
[1:49:45] bless each one, Lord God. May the word
[1:49:47] continue to strengthen us and minister
[1:49:49] into our hearts. Father God, it's in the
[1:49:51] name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray.
[1:49:53] Amen. Amen. God bless you saints. We
[1:49:57] thank the
[1:49:59] Lord.
[1:50:01] Amen. I just wanted to encourage you
[1:50:03] mothers this morning. Uh it's certainly
[1:50:06] a a grand uh opportunity to have uh not
[1:50:11] just a mother uh but a godly mother, a
[1:50:14] mother that truly cares. And we know
[1:50:16] that we have the mother of mothers. That
[1:50:19] is our Lord Jesus Christ. As our brother
[1:50:21] prayed this morning, he is both male and
[1:50:23] female. He is the breast of God. Amen.
[1:50:26] So we can take rest this morning. God
[1:50:29] richly bless you.
[1:50:35] [Applause]
[1:50:40] Praise the Lord. God bless you, brother
[1:50:42] Jeremy.
[1:50:44] Praise the Lord.
[1:50:46] Amen. Give the Lord another hand. Clap
[1:50:48] for
[1:50:49] praise. My
[1:50:51] Lord, what a message. Uh you know, just
[1:50:55] listening to Brother Jerry preach and
[1:50:57] you know, you think back over your life.
[1:51:00] I remember when I got
[1:51:03] converted and
[1:51:05] uh you know I I I never really needed
[1:51:08] friends because I had three brothers. We
[1:51:10] were very very
[1:51:13] close. But when I got converted, we
[1:51:16] separated. I didn't separate from them,
[1:51:19] but they separated from me. When I would
[1:51:22] walk in a room, they would leave. I
[1:51:24] follow them into the other room, they
[1:51:26] would leave. And mama saw that. So when
[1:51:30] she saw that, she was like, "What did
[1:51:33] this boy get into? Let me read some of
[1:51:36] these
[1:51:37] books and listen to some of these tapes
[1:51:40] that, you know, he's been listening to
[1:51:42] and
[1:51:44] reading." And as she did
[1:51:46] that, I can now call mama sister.
[1:51:57] and just thinking, you know, how she
[1:52:00] just wants to see all of us together.
[1:52:02] She'll do everything she can just to get
[1:52:04] me and my brothers together. She'll have
[1:52:07] me praying for them. She'll have me
[1:52:09] praying with her. A mother loves never
[1:52:12] stop. Amen. She don't want that family
[1:52:14] circle to be broken. She want to see all
[1:52:16] of her children together here on the
[1:52:18] earth. Amen. And on the other side.
[1:52:21] Amen. So children, just understand mama
[1:52:24] loves you. Amen. Every every man can
[1:52:28] testify that if you want a man to fight,
[1:52:30] you talk about his mama.
[1:52:35] You're going to get a fight.
[1:52:37] I I sort of took advantage of that
[1:52:39] playing
[1:52:41] sports. If you know, I was always on
[1:52:45] offense, guys, they would, you know,
[1:52:48] talk noise and I was a very quiet
[1:52:50] person. But if I wanted them to get out
[1:52:52] of character so that I can take
[1:52:54] advantage of them, I would say, "Your
[1:52:57] mother's a man."
[1:53:02] And they would try and kill me.
[1:53:05] So they would be angry coming at me all
[1:53:07] out of control and I'm scoring
[1:53:09] touchdowns all because of the
[1:53:11] psychology. I know how you feel about
[1:53:13] your mama. Wow. And I can take advantage
[1:53:16] of you. So mothers know that you're
[1:53:19] loved by your boys.
[1:53:21] No matter what, they got your back.
[1:53:23] Don't Don't talk about nobody, mama.
[1:53:26] Praise the Lord. Will you stand to your
[1:53:27] feet? I don't have a song for mother,
[1:53:31] but just God bless you. I just wanted to
[1:53:34] mention uh my wife and I, we brought a
[1:53:37] few roses for the mothers in the back.
[1:53:39] So, as you're walking out, feel free to
[1:53:41] take a rose. Happy Mother's Day. Praise
[1:53:43] the Lord.
[1:53:45] Praise the
[1:53:48] Lord. Amen. Amen. So, what we'll do,
[1:53:51] we'll sing uh what he got into at the
[1:53:54] end. Greater is he that is in me than he
[1:53:56] that is in the world.
[1:53:59] Greater is he that is in
[1:54:03] me. Greater is he that is in
[1:54:08] me. Greater is he that is in me than he
[1:54:15] that is in the world. Come on, let's
[1:54:17] sing it again.
[1:54:19] Say, "Greater is he that is in me." Oh,
[1:54:24] greater is he that is in
[1:54:28] me. Greater is he that is in me than he
[1:54:34] that is in the world. Come on. Satan
[1:54:38] like well Satan like a roaring
[1:54:43] lion roaming to every seeking whom he
[1:54:47] may devour seeking whom he may
[1:54:52] devour. Bible tells us so many souls
[1:54:56] have been his prey. Many souls have been
[1:55:01] his prey to fall in some weak. God has
[1:55:06] promised us today. God has promised us
[1:55:11] today his
[1:55:13] overcoming power. Say, "Greater, greater
[1:55:17] is he that is in me." Oh, greater is he
[1:55:23] that is in
[1:55:25] me. Greater is he that is in me than he
[1:55:31] that is in the world.
[1:55:35] Well, on the day of pitching costs, a
[1:55:40] rushing mighty
[1:55:43] wind blew into the upper room and
[1:55:49] baptize all of
[1:55:53] them with a power greater
[1:55:57] than any earth before.
[1:56:01] [Music]
[1:56:03] I'm so glad that I've got it, too. I'm
[1:56:07] going to let the whole world know.
[1:56:11] Gater, greater is he that is in me.
[1:56:16] Gater is
[1:56:19] he. Gater, greater is he that is in me
[1:56:25] than he has in.
[1:56:28] Say, "Greater, greater is he that is in
[1:56:33] me." Oh, greater is he that is in
[1:56:38] me. Greater is he that is in me than he
[1:56:44] that is
[1:56:45] in the
[1:56:48] world. Praise the
[1:56:50] Lord. Hallelujah. Let's bow our heads
[1:56:53] and our hearts. Father God, we thank you
[1:56:56] so much, Lord God, for being both father
[1:56:59] and mother to us, Lord Jesus. Father, we
[1:57:02] know as a father, sometimes you have to
[1:57:04] be stern, Lord Jesus, and correct us.
[1:57:07] But as a mother, Lord God, you can
[1:57:09] nurture us and comfort us in our times
[1:57:12] of need. Lord Jesus, we're so grateful
[1:57:14] for the great grace that you've given
[1:57:16] us, Lord, blessing us, Lord, with
[1:57:18] mothers that care, with mothers that
[1:57:21] would would teach us, Lord Jesus. and
[1:57:24] Lord know how we're doing Lord.
[1:57:25] Sometimes when we don't have the words
[1:57:28] to say about certain things that hurt
[1:57:30] us, Lord, but mother knows, Lord Jesus,
[1:57:33] she she can get into that channel with
[1:57:36] us, Lord God, and bring us out. So,
[1:57:38] Father, we pray that you answer every
[1:57:41] prayer of the mothers, Lord. We ask
[1:57:44] almighty God that you'll bless them,
[1:57:45] Lord, for all that they have given us,
[1:57:48] Lord Jesus. They pour out their lives,
[1:57:50] Lord. They put their lives in jeopardy,
[1:57:52] Lord, that we might live. Lord, they
[1:57:55] sacrifice, Lord, being hungry that we
[1:57:57] might be fed. Oh, Lord, they'll
[1:57:59] sacrifice, Lord, something that they
[1:58:01] want, Lord, that we may have our hearts
[1:58:03] desire. Lord, you're so good to us,
[1:58:06] Lord. Thank you for the mothers that
[1:58:07] you've given us. And Father, we have
[1:58:10] sisters that desires to be mothers and
[1:58:13] those, Lord, that have yet to get
[1:58:15] married. Lord, look into motherhood down
[1:58:18] the road. Father, bless them, Lord. Oh
[1:58:21] father, may they be the greatest upon
[1:58:23] the earth, Lord. For in this age that
[1:58:25] we're living in, motherhood is fading,
[1:58:28] Lord Jesus. Mothers allowing their
[1:58:31] children to drink with them, smoke with
[1:58:33] them, run around, and all these
[1:58:34] different things. But holiness, Lord
[1:58:37] Jesus, is what you want for us. So,
[1:58:39] Father, we ask that you would bless the
[1:58:41] the future mothers. Lord, bless your
[1:58:43] people as we prepare to leave this
[1:58:45] place, Lord Jesus. Oh God, go before us
[1:58:48] and and and may we be a blessing, Lord,
[1:58:51] to all those we come in contact with. We
[1:58:54] love you, Father. We pray, Father, that
[1:58:56] you'll bless Brother Jerry, everything
[1:58:58] that he gave us, the preaching of the
[1:59:00] gospel, Lord, the giving of his time.
[1:59:02] Oh, Father, in giving of himself this
[1:59:05] morning, Father, thank you for using him
[1:59:07] to speak to us. We love you, Father.
[1:59:10] Commit all things to you now. It's in
[1:59:12] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen.
[1:59:16] Praise the Lord. You can have your seats
[1:59:19] and our brothers will come and dismiss
[1:59:21] you at this time.

[2:00:20] you. Thank you
