[52:23] that mushy
[52:25] they just want you to tell it to them
[52:26] straight up you know
[52:28] and uh but uh nonetheless we we did want
[52:31] to
[52:32] you know try to encourage our fathers in

[52:35] and uh just tell them how much we
[52:38] appreciate them
[52:39] uh everyone that is here within the

[53:04] took me through
[53:05] amen through my life it made me who i am
[53:08] amen i i could not um
[53:13] just settle on the scripture psalms 51
[53:16] is where i want to
[53:16] go to and um
[53:20] i couldn't settle my heart on a
[53:23] particular verse here so
[53:25] just let me read most of it
[53:29] um this
[53:33] is written by david and uh i think it
[53:36] would be just
[53:37] a blessing on this father's day it says
[53:40] have mercy upon me o god according
[53:45] to thy loving kindness according
[53:49] unto the multitude of thy tender mercies
[53:53] blot out my transgressions
[53:58] wash me thoroughly from my iniquity and
[54:01] cleanse me
[54:02] from my sin for i acknowledge my
[54:05] transgressions and
[54:07] my sin is ever before me
[54:11] against thee the only have i sinned and
[54:14] done this evil in thy sight that thou
[54:16] mightest be justified when thou
[54:17] speakest and be clear when thou
[54:20] judges behold i was shaping
[54:24] and iniquity and and sin did my mother
[54:27] conceive me
[54:29] but behold thou desirest truth in the
[54:32] inward parts and
[54:33] in the hidden part thou shalt make me to
[54:35] no wisdom
[54:37] purge me with hyssop and i shall be
[54:41] clean
[54:42] wash me and i shall be whiter
[54:46] than snow make me to hear joy
[54:50] and gladness that the bones which thou
[54:54] has
[54:54] broken may rejoice
[54:58] hide thy face from
[55:01] my sins and blot out all mine iniquities
[55:06] create in me
[55:10] a clean heart oh god and renew a right
[55:13] spirit
[55:14] within me cast me not away from
[55:18] thy presence and take not thy holy
[55:21] spirit
[55:23] from me restore unto me the joy
[55:27] of thy salvation and uphold me with thy
[55:32] free spirit then will i teach
[55:35] transgressors thy ways and sinners shall
[55:38] be converted unto thee deliver me from
[55:40] blood
[55:40] guiltiness o god now god of my salvation
[55:44] and my
[55:44] tongue shall sing aloud of thy
[55:46] righteousness o lord
[55:48] open thou my lips and my mouth shall
[55:51] show forth
[55:52] thy praise for thou desirest not
[55:54] sacrifice else would i give it
[55:56] thou delightest not and burn offerings
[55:58] the sacrifices of god
[56:01] are a broken spirit
[56:04] a broken and a contrite heart
[56:07] oh god thou wilt not despise do good and
[56:11] thy
[56:11] good pleasure unto zion build thou the
[56:13] walls of jerusalem
[56:16] then shalt thou be pleased with the
[56:18] sacrifices of righteousness
[56:20] with burnt offerings and whole burnt
[56:22] offering then shall they offer bullocks
[56:24] upon thine oil to the lord and a
[56:25] blessing to the reading of his word
[56:28] let's just bow uh in a word of prayer

[56:45] happened thus far in the service and as
[56:47] we come and turn our attention towards
[56:50] the word of god
[56:51] speak to us through your word speak
[56:54] words that would change us from the
[56:56] inside
[56:57] out and god reacts that you would give
[57:00] life to those that need
[57:01] life bring deliverance to those that
[57:03] need deliverance bring healing to those
[57:05] that need healing
[57:06] salvation to those that need salvation
[57:08] got whatever the need is this morning we
[57:10] pray that you would
[57:12] meet each one at the point of their
[57:15] need bless the fathers that are in the
[57:17] house those that are online
[57:19] bless them abundantly god is our prayer
[57:21] in jesus name we pray
[57:23] amen amen amen you can be seated in the
[57:27] house of the lord
[57:31] praise the lord uh we want to
[57:36] use for our title today uh
[57:40] sovereign grace from our sovereign
[57:45] father amen
[57:48] amen and um
[57:54] i'll just uh start out with
[57:57] maybe just reading a little something
[57:59] here
[58:01] from the the sermon leadership and
[58:04] fathers are are very very important uh
[58:08] very very important and uh we we don't
[58:11] want to ever take that
[58:13] for granted and um um
[58:17] let's just kind of show a few things
[58:18] here that god's prophet said says it's
[58:20] usually a mother
[58:22] that gets to lead a child to its first
[58:24] step
[58:25] it says because she is home while the
[58:28] daddy is out working now
[58:30] uh i know somehow society is changing
[58:33] this uh it used to be daddy was the one
[58:37] out working providing for the family
[58:40] praise the lord amen but society
[58:43] and we got to be careful uh it's one
[58:46] thing if you're sick and can't work and
[58:47] your wife has to do
[58:48] whatever it's that's that's that's
[58:50] totally understandable but
[58:52] but but but but but but if i can be
[58:54] honest men are getting lazy
[58:58] right and and and um you know
[59:01] the scripture says a man
[59:04] not a woman but a man that don't work
[59:09] don't eat right so so so so
[59:13] as men we have a responsibility we have
[59:15] to stand up and
[59:17] accept that a father is the protector
[59:20] amen and provider uh you know he he's
[59:24] supposed to
[59:24] you know do all of those things in his
[59:26] house so we want to make sure we keep
[59:28] men
[59:28] held to a standard amen
[59:32] so it's usually a mother that gets to
[59:34] lead a child to his first step because
[59:35] she is home
[59:37] uh while daddy is out working trying to
[59:40] make a living
[59:41] uh he says but it's uh they they make
[59:45] their first step
[59:46] and at night time when they come in the
[59:48] father he is
[59:49] always saying uh
[59:53] he's always saying oh dad she said
[59:54] johnny and mary
[59:56] the little boy girl can walk come and
[59:58] look in just
[1:00:00] one step maybe mother
[1:00:03] had to whole had to hold uh mother's
[1:00:05] finger
[1:00:06] let me give you the the quote it's 65
[1:00:10] i'm sorry let me i didn't write
[1:00:12] something down 65 65-1031
[1:00:15] a and then the paragraph number is 22.
[1:00:20] okay sorry about that says um um
[1:00:24] and just one step maybe mother had to
[1:00:26] hold had to have the whole mother's
[1:00:27] finger
[1:00:28] because you was kind of weak and kind of
[1:00:31] turned sideways you know and
[1:00:33] and fall down a little so you had to
[1:00:35] hold mama's hand to make your first step
[1:00:38] and
[1:00:38] some of y'all can go back in memories
[1:00:40] and think about holding mama's hand
[1:00:42] says now now somebody help you when you
[1:00:45] made your first step
[1:00:46] hallelujah and your last step you ever
[1:00:50] make in life
[1:00:51] somebody will be leading you
[1:00:55] so somebody was helping you when you
[1:00:57] made your first step
[1:00:58] and somebody's gonna be leading you when
[1:01:00] you make your last step
[1:01:01] now hallelujah right so see that's right
[1:01:04] i want you to remember that your first
[1:01:06] step somebody led you and your last step
[1:01:08] somebody will be
[1:01:10] leading you all right says we have to be
[1:01:13] led
[1:01:14] you know god liking us unto sheep and
[1:01:17] did you know a sheep can't lead itself
[1:01:20] amen he'll wander away and stray he just
[1:01:24] can't lead himself and he has to have
[1:01:26] somebody
[1:01:28] to lead him hallelujah
[1:01:31] amen the shepherd is supposed to lead
[1:01:34] the sheep
[1:01:35] now that was back in the days of the
[1:01:37] lord jesus he was the good shepherd that
[1:01:38] led the sheep
[1:01:39] but today you see we're living in
[1:01:41] another day everything is
[1:01:43] changed and perverted that's what i was
[1:01:45] saying early about
[1:01:46] father's not going to work anymore men
[1:01:48] find it very
[1:01:50] gratifying to be at home taking care of
[1:01:52] kids
[1:01:54] and and some wives love it that way
[1:01:56] hallelujah they run into some real
[1:01:58] problems and realize that man ain't got
[1:02:00] what it takes
[1:02:01] on the inside to do what really need to
[1:02:03] be done
[1:02:04] he's built differently hallelujah
[1:02:07] designed differently by god
[1:02:09] and he has a role that he needs to play
[1:02:10] but what we need what we need to do
[1:02:13] in christendom is stay in our lanes
[1:02:18] hello somebody if everybody just
[1:02:21] standing lane it'll run real smooth
[1:02:24] all right hallelujah church
[1:02:28] right amen and like i say there are
[1:02:30] times where that might happen but that
[1:02:31] should not be the norm
[1:02:33] amen it shouldn't be the norm god god
[1:02:35] god made it just go back and look at
[1:02:37] what happened in the garden of eden
[1:02:39] when the punishments came down who did
[1:02:41] god send to work
[1:02:43] adam went to work adam had to work by
[1:02:46] the sweat of his brow that was god's
[1:02:48] original plan
[1:02:51] and let me tell you something god don't
[1:02:53] change his mind now we might change but
[1:02:55] god don't change
[1:02:57] hallelujah and sister make sure you find
[1:02:59] yourself a man that's willing to work
[1:03:04] all right now i'm going on a little
[1:03:07] further
[1:03:08] amen it says uh um but you say uh
[1:03:12] but you see today you see we're living
[1:03:14] in another day
[1:03:15] everything is changed and perverted you
[1:03:17] know what man
[1:03:18] has to lead sheep today a goat
[1:03:22] and it sees a shepherd's job before but
[1:03:24] 90 years ago it says
[1:03:25] and you know where the goat leads them
[1:03:27] to right into the slaughter
[1:03:29] them little sheep don't know where
[1:03:31] they're going so the goat goes up a pen
[1:03:33] up up at the slaughter and the sheep
[1:03:35] don't know no more than to follow a
[1:03:38] leader
[1:03:38] so it goes in and gets killed see uh
[1:03:41] i'm sorry follow leave so it leads him
[1:03:43] right up into the slaughter
[1:03:45] and then the goat jumps over the track
[1:03:47] and the sheep goes in and gets killed
[1:03:49] see
[1:03:49] the goat a wrong leader
[1:03:52] hallelujah but jesus the good shepherd
[1:03:55] who led the sheep he led them to life
[1:03:57] and held their hand
[1:03:59] but somebody has to leave the sheep
[1:04:02] let me go a little further in this quote
[1:04:04] it says the first
[1:04:05] is mother's kindness then
[1:04:09] the father's after the mother gives you
[1:04:13] your first step
[1:04:15] then you look to your daddy hallelujah
[1:04:19] all of us for wisdom because he is the
[1:04:23] head of the house who's the head of the
[1:04:24] house
[1:04:26] all right that is the head of the house
[1:04:29] he's saying you look the daddy for you
[1:04:31] for wisdom and usually not that he's
[1:04:34] any smarter i love the way this is put
[1:04:37] not that he's any smarter but he's just
[1:04:40] made
[1:04:42] a leader of his family now every man
[1:04:46] in here that has a family is the leader
[1:04:48] of that family
[1:04:49] hallelujah that's why you gotta have you
[1:04:51] got to watch how you lead them god
[1:04:54] made you the leader of that family you
[1:04:57] have to lead
[1:04:58] financially you have to lead physically
[1:05:01] you have to lead emotionally and you
[1:05:03] have to leave spiritually
[1:05:07] right hallelujah he says uh uh just
[1:05:10] made a lead of his family so we follow
[1:05:12] what our daddy says do
[1:05:14] when he says now son i would like for
[1:05:16] you to do a certain thing
[1:05:18] then we listen to him because it's
[1:05:21] wisdom
[1:05:23] oh i just want to break in there just
[1:05:25] for a few seconds you know because
[1:05:26] sometimes in a household
[1:05:28] and it just happens on both sides both
[1:05:31] sides
[1:05:32] sometimes a mother may not understand
[1:05:34] why the daddy is saying
[1:05:36] do something to the kids why tell the
[1:05:38] kids to do a particular thing the
[1:05:39] mothers don't understand that
[1:05:41] and sometimes the mother might feel like
[1:05:43] you know that's just that's just too
[1:05:45] mean
[1:05:46] that's just to this and that's just to
[1:05:48] that you got to understand your role is
[1:05:50] to bring the nourishment
[1:05:52] and that soft side but daddy has to lay
[1:05:56] down
[1:05:57] law and i'm going to tell you something
[1:06:01] if you if you will allow
[1:06:02] daddy to lay down law it'll keep your
[1:06:05] kids out of jail
[1:06:10] sometimes you got to back off and and
[1:06:13] and the whole hallelujah
[1:06:14] you you sometimes you're just not going
[1:06:15] to have to say nothing i remember uncle
[1:06:17] mine told me
[1:06:18] he said don't argue a man in front of
[1:06:21] the kids
[1:06:22] say if y'all got a disagreement try to
[1:06:24] go behind closed doors and argue
[1:06:25] because them kids when they see you
[1:06:28] disagreeing
[1:06:29] then them kids gonna use that to their
[1:06:31] advantage
[1:06:33] come on somebody right and that kid will
[1:06:35] find a way to get around daddy
[1:06:37] because they can go to mama all the time
[1:06:39] mama you gotta understand his
[1:06:41] responsibility is to lay down some law
[1:06:44] hallelujah all right all right let me
[1:06:48] keep going let me keep going now
[1:06:50] i'm coming to a few points that i want
[1:06:52] to make here it says um
[1:06:54] he's just a leader of his family so we
[1:06:57] we follow what our daddy says do when he
[1:06:58] says now son i would like for you to do
[1:07:00] a certain thing
[1:07:02] uh then we listen to him because it's
[1:07:04] wisdom
[1:07:05] but listen see he has learned a whole
[1:07:08] lot and we've got to ask him
[1:07:10] to see what he learned and then we can
[1:07:12] profit by his what he has learned to
[1:07:15] tell us
[1:07:15] now don't go and do this because i did
[1:07:17] that my father told me not to do it but
[1:07:19] i did it
[1:07:20] and it caused this to happen to me
[1:07:22] you're learning from daddy's experience
[1:07:24] and something back see so see then then
[1:07:26] he daddy tells us how to do it and what
[1:07:28] to do
[1:07:28] right i had a daddy like that i had a
[1:07:31] daddy like that i'm finished with that
[1:07:32] but my my my father you know a couple of
[1:07:35] times i
[1:07:36] just my mind goes back amen and i think
[1:07:39] about a couple things but
[1:07:41] you know i remember there were certain
[1:07:42] friends in my neighborhood that
[1:07:45] my daddy just didn't want me running
[1:07:47] with people that he just didn't want
[1:07:49] hanging around the house and
[1:07:51] you know and we would sneak to try to
[1:07:52] try to run with these guys but
[1:07:54] my daddy was absolutely right this one
[1:07:56] guy that he was telling us watch out for
[1:07:58] him
[1:07:58] so he's he's uh probably 10 or 15 years
[1:08:01] older than y'all but he want to hang
[1:08:02] with y'all something wrong with this guy
[1:08:06] hallelujah and later on in life we found
[1:08:08] out there was something wrong with that
[1:08:09] guy
[1:08:10] right i mean my daddy had a way of i
[1:08:12] mean what he was doing was just kind of
[1:08:14] using his his experience to try to share
[1:08:17] with us if we could just catch what he
[1:08:18] was saying
[1:08:19] not that he was being mean but he was
[1:08:21] being a protector
[1:08:24] right hallelujah i remember him trying
[1:08:26] to instill structure
[1:08:28] you know in in the household and and i
[1:08:31] remember one time
[1:08:32] uh we were just real caught up on on
[1:08:35] wrestling
[1:08:35] and we wanted to watch some wrestling on
[1:08:37] tv i believe it was
[1:08:39] and uh you know they had to you know
[1:08:40] back though back in those days
[1:08:42] andre the giant and dusty rose and sweet
[1:08:45] brown sugar and
[1:08:46] and all these other wrestlers and
[1:08:48] everything that was you know i mean
[1:08:50] right then
[1:08:50] west palm beach auditorium and man we
[1:08:52] would be watching that wrestling and one
[1:08:54] day
[1:08:54] we got so engrossed in that wrestling
[1:08:57] but then to say feed the dog
[1:09:02] but uh you know like what daddy would
[1:09:03] get to it and and uh
[1:09:05] we're just sitting there watching and
[1:09:07] going from commercial to commercial just
[1:09:08] watching that and say
[1:09:09] feed the dog and uh so you know we
[1:09:12] sitting there
[1:09:13] nothing we didn't move and and uh we
[1:09:15] were just so overtaken
[1:09:17] by what we was looking at on television
[1:09:19] i would say we'll get to the dog later
[1:09:21] really all what he was instilling was
[1:09:23] responsibility
[1:09:25] right and that it but before we knew it
[1:09:27] daddy came down the hallway
[1:09:29] hallelujah and uh and all we heard is a
[1:09:33] belt
[1:09:33] wrinkling and you talk about somebody
[1:09:37] that
[1:09:38] stopped watching you know wrestling real
[1:09:41] quick we ran out the house to get to
[1:09:43] that talk
[1:09:44] my cousin didn't understand what was
[1:09:46] going on and he was the last one to get
[1:09:49] out the house he felt the wrath of daddy
[1:09:52] but he was just stealing something you
[1:09:54] gotta you gotta learn responsibility
[1:09:56] before you got wrapped up in that
[1:09:58] program the dog needed to be fed
[1:10:02] and i told you nicely
[1:10:05] i told you twice nicely but now i got to
[1:10:09] be the enforcer
[1:10:11] and households daddy have to be the
[1:10:13] enforcer
[1:10:15] daddy when mama come to you with a
[1:10:16] problem and this kid did this this kid
[1:10:18] did that sometimes you got to step up
[1:10:20] and enforce some things
[1:10:22] don't let them children run over mama
[1:10:30] because we got it perverted you know
[1:10:32] children raising parents
[1:10:37] it should be parents raising children
[1:10:39] but the children tell us what they want
[1:10:41] to do
[1:10:42] and see in my house it didn't it didn't
[1:10:44] go that way we didn't
[1:10:46] tell what we i i don't want to do this
[1:10:47] now you don't want to do what
[1:10:50] you don't want to eat what and i'm
[1:10:52] slaved over the stone no you're going to
[1:10:54] eat this
[1:10:55] and you ain't going to get up from the
[1:10:57] table until it's all gone
[1:11:01] that's the house i grew up in and i
[1:11:03] thank god i grew up in a house like that
[1:11:05] because it kept me
[1:11:07] from eating at a jail table
[1:11:14] some stats i just love to give stats
[1:11:16] like this on
[1:11:18] father's day and and uh i i i reached
[1:11:22] and grabbed some stats from
[1:11:23] multiple sources here amen uh i
[1:11:27] used a website life is beautiful uh
[1:11:30] modern gentleman.net touchstone
[1:11:34] mag.com and uh nickcaddy.org so i'm just
[1:11:38] pulling you know just
[1:11:40] different articles from these these uh
[1:11:42] these um
[1:11:43] different websites and i just want to
[1:11:44] give you just some qualities here
[1:11:46] or some stats about about fathering uh
[1:11:49] they said in one
[1:11:50] only 68 of children will spend their
[1:11:53] their entire childhood with an intact
[1:11:57] family only 68
[1:12:00] of children will spend their entire
[1:12:04] childhood with an intact family all
[1:12:07] right and and and one of the causing
[1:12:09] i mean one of the the biggest causes for
[1:12:12] a child not being able to spend their
[1:12:14] entire childhood with the
[1:12:16] with an intact family is because divorce
[1:12:19] a man is one of the leading leading
[1:12:21] causes of a fatherless home
[1:12:24] divorce is the leading cause of a
[1:12:26] fatherless home
[1:12:27] all right um they have this and this is
[1:12:30] a spiritual thing when both parents
[1:12:32] attend
[1:12:33] bible study and watch this
[1:12:36] listen to this listen real good and and
[1:12:39] and some of y'all might want to elbow
[1:12:40] the person next to someone listen up now
[1:12:42] listen up listen up
[1:12:43] all right says when both parents
[1:12:46] attend bible study in addition to sunday
[1:12:50] service
[1:12:51] listen up elbow i'm not listen up amen
[1:12:55] when they attend bible study
[1:12:56] in addition to sunday service 72
[1:13:00] of their children will attend sunday
[1:13:02] school when they're grown
[1:13:05] that's by just going to a wednesday
[1:13:07] night service you got a 70
[1:13:09] 72 chance that your children will also
[1:13:13] not just go to church but they'll go to
[1:13:15] bible uh a sunday school when they get
[1:13:17] older
[1:13:18] watch that now another stat stat here
[1:13:20] says 90
[1:13:22] of the youth in the united states who
[1:13:25] decide to run away from home or become
[1:13:27] homeless for
[1:13:28] any reason any reason originally comes
[1:13:31] from a fatherless home
[1:13:33] so it's good for daddy to be there all
[1:13:36] right it says if
[1:13:37] if a father does not go to church
[1:13:40] no matter how faithful his wife's
[1:13:44] devotions are
[1:13:45] only one child and 50 will become a
[1:13:48] regular
[1:13:49] worshiper only one child and 50 children
[1:13:53] will become a regular worshiper if the
[1:13:56] father does not go to church
[1:13:59] hallelujah the reason that is is because
[1:14:00] the children equate church to being
[1:14:02] something that only a woman does
[1:14:05] it's for women and children but not for
[1:14:07] men that's why i take men that come up
[1:14:09] get up out of the bed and lead your
[1:14:11] family to church no this ain't just
[1:14:12] something that women and children do
[1:14:14] that's something that
[1:14:15] all of us do hallelujah
[1:14:18] amen son i go because i need god's mercy
[1:14:22] i need god's grace and i want to lead by
[1:14:24] example
[1:14:25] and i don't want to just go to just
[1:14:26] sunday morning i want to come wednesday
[1:14:28] night as well
[1:14:30] it has an impact on your child when they
[1:14:33] see you
[1:14:34] go to church you know
[1:14:37] i'm a uh you know i always tell this
[1:14:40] story but i remember
[1:14:41] uh and these are things that happened
[1:14:43] that shaped my memory
[1:14:45] my daddy won a church going man you know
[1:14:48] all
[1:14:48] all of our years of growing up we i
[1:14:51] remember
[1:14:52] we all had the family church that my
[1:14:53] daddy attended
[1:14:55] but i didn't realize why he stopped
[1:14:57] going just and one of the reasons my dad
[1:14:59] stopped just because of some of the mess
[1:15:01] that he saw in church
[1:15:03] right and and i can understand that but
[1:15:05] uh but i remember
[1:15:06] you know there was come a time we were
[1:15:08] becoming teenagers and
[1:15:10] and uh we didn't really want to go to
[1:15:12] church either we didn't want to be
[1:15:13] known as church boys right and uh and i
[1:15:17] remember
[1:15:18] you know daddy one day decided that he
[1:15:20] gonna go to church but on this day he
[1:15:22] did something different
[1:15:23] he said we gonna walk to church
[1:15:26] i say oh as a teenager walking down the
[1:15:30] street and
[1:15:31] all my boys see me walking to church i
[1:15:34] thought that was gonna be the most
[1:15:35] embarrassing day
[1:15:36] of my life i cannot walk to church with
[1:15:39] the family
[1:15:40] so me and my brother came up with a plan
[1:15:43] daddy we'll meet y'all there my dad will
[1:15:46] say okay
[1:15:47] i'ma hold you to your word my daddy got
[1:15:49] up the road a little bit
[1:15:51] got him rolled a little bit he saw that
[1:15:53] we was not behind him
[1:15:55] daddy showed up he had a key to the
[1:15:58] front though
[1:15:59] he opened his door and we heard that
[1:16:00] belt again
[1:16:03] you want to see how fast we got dressed
[1:16:05] to get ready for church
[1:16:07] and daddy walked with us right on down
[1:16:08] there to the church i don't care how
[1:16:10] embarrassed we might have felt
[1:16:12] daddy instilled something in us that day
[1:16:14] that
[1:16:15] church was important thank my god for a
[1:16:21] daddy like that
[1:16:23] hallelujah listen um
[1:16:26] if uh this other stat here says uh
[1:16:30] children who live in a father's home are
[1:16:32] 279 percent more likely
[1:16:35] to deal drugs or carry firearms for
[1:16:38] offensive purposes compared to children
[1:16:40] who live with their fathers
[1:16:42] hallelujah think about these stats the
[1:16:44] father is extremely
[1:16:46] important all right uh here you know
[1:16:49] another stat that says 85
[1:16:52] of youth who are currently in prison
[1:16:55] grew up in a fatherless home
[1:16:58] and i said if a father does go regularly
[1:17:01] church
[1:17:02] if he goes regularly to church
[1:17:03] regardless of the practice of the mother
[1:17:06] so even though the mama don't go but the
[1:17:08] daddy decide to go
[1:17:09] says between two thirds and three
[1:17:12] quarters of their children
[1:17:14] will become church goers
[1:17:17] when that when the children see the
[1:17:19] daddy going to church it affects them
[1:17:21] uh mentally it affects them they will
[1:17:24] want to go to church hallelujah
[1:17:25] look at this uh another statement
[1:17:28] children from father's homes are twice
[1:17:30] as likely
[1:17:31] to drop out from school before
[1:17:33] graduating than children who have a
[1:17:34] father in their lives
[1:17:36] and this last stat that i want to give
[1:17:38] you um
[1:17:40] if a child is the there
[1:17:44] is the first person in a household to
[1:17:46] become a christian
[1:17:48] there is three or 3.5 percent
[1:17:51] probability
[1:17:52] that everybody else in the household
[1:17:54] will follow
[1:17:56] if the mother in the household
[1:17:59] becomes a christian first there is a 17
[1:18:03] probability that everybody else in the
[1:18:06] household is gonna follow
[1:18:08] hallelujah however if the father
[1:18:12] is the first to fall to start following
[1:18:16] jesus
[1:18:17] there is a 93 percent
[1:18:20] probability that everybody else in the
[1:18:23] house is going to follow
[1:18:26] you can see the impact of daddy's
[1:18:28] serving god
[1:18:30] the data shows that when daddy serves
[1:18:33] god
[1:18:33] it has an impact on his family not just
[1:18:36] that family but
[1:18:37] generation after generation after
[1:18:39] generation
[1:18:40] is impacted when daddy is serving god
[1:18:47] i was looking at this amen scripture
[1:18:51] i i want to read re have you read with
[1:18:54] me ephesians 6
[1:18:56] amen verse 1 just giving you these stats
[1:18:59] amen is one thing and it just shows the
[1:19:01] the importance of daddy being involved
[1:19:05] spiritually and naturally daddies need
[1:19:07] to be involved
[1:19:09] hallelujah glory glory glory
[1:19:12] and uh here you know we we want to look
[1:19:14] at something in ephesians
[1:19:16] six verse one
[1:19:19] says this children
[1:19:22] obey your parents in the lord
[1:19:27] for this is right now if your parent
[1:19:28] trying to get you to do something that's
[1:19:29] against the word of god
[1:19:31] that's not what the bible tells you to
[1:19:32] do but it's in the lord
[1:19:35] for this is right notice this verse 2
[1:19:38] says
[1:19:38] honor thy father and
[1:19:41] mother which is the first commandment

[1:21:11] going to follow that's that's that's
[1:21:12] some
[1:21:12] great stats to me hallelujah but but on

[1:22:09] and i'm learning this i'm i'm a work in
[1:22:12] progress
[1:22:13] it might be decisions that they make
[1:22:14] that i might not agree with but what i'm
[1:22:16] learning to do is
[1:22:17] hush my mouth don't say a word
[1:22:21] hallelujah because i don't want to
[1:22:22] provoke my children to wrath
[1:22:25] hallelujah amen if i live the right kind
[1:22:27] of life before i'm there follow that
[1:22:29] example

[1:22:33] gonna have to say something
[1:22:34] but then you're gonna get to another age
[1:22:36] drama just let you figure it out

[1:23:12] children around

[1:23:22] you'll learn that
[1:23:23] you know as as you go forward all right
[1:23:25] here i want to just bring in a
[1:23:27] another little quote here and i want to
[1:23:29] kind of change gears just a little bit
[1:23:33] this is going to come from the message
[1:23:34] the waters of separation i was reading
[1:23:36] this some time ago and
[1:23:38] and it just kind of struck me and i said
[1:23:41] you know i
[1:23:41] i think i want to save that for father's
[1:23:43] day
[1:23:46] says this and the message the waters of
[1:23:47] separation says many times in dealing
[1:23:49] with spiritual things
[1:23:52] you see them when they move out someone
[1:23:54] was just speaking
[1:23:55] uh just asking me here not long ago i
[1:23:58] was at calgary canada

[1:24:06] this boy they had him in a straitjacket
[1:24:10] and they come in the back of the room

[1:24:13] and carrying on and i never heard such
[1:24:16] in my life
[1:24:18] and the father was trying to hold him
[1:24:23] and when he got on the inside he looked
[1:24:25] over to me and said william branham you
[1:24:27] ain't got
[1:24:28] nothing to do with me now this is a
[1:24:30] spirit speaking out of this boy
[1:24:33] calling brother branham's name called
[1:24:35] his full name
[1:24:36] don't play with demons don't play with
[1:24:39] demons this is real
[1:24:40] this is re reality and i'm gonna tell
[1:24:43] you
[1:24:44] as as as a father you want to make sure
[1:24:46] you're in a position that
[1:24:47] if a devil attack attack your child
[1:24:50] you got you got representation in heaven
[1:24:53] right you got you got you got you got a
[1:24:55] connection with god that you can pray
[1:24:57] and know that in the name of jesus that
[1:24:59] devil got to get off your child
[1:25:01] you got to have that type of
[1:25:03] relationship with god
[1:25:05] right now i need to call the pastor i
[1:25:06] need to call no you need to call
[1:25:10] jesus
[1:25:12] all right so look at this boy's
[1:25:13] condition now he says looked over to me
[1:25:15] and said william branham you ain't got
[1:25:16] nothing to do with me
[1:25:18] oh the father looked at him and said he
[1:25:20] don't even know his own name
[1:25:22] i know his own name how'd he know your
[1:25:24] name
[1:25:25] right i was standing off a great
[1:25:27] distance from
[1:25:29] oh how he was cursing me and carrying on
[1:25:32] and
[1:25:32] he said you ain't got nothing to do with
[1:25:34] me and i asked the audience if they'd
[1:25:36] just be reverent
[1:25:38] the ushers come to take him out just
[1:25:41] then i seen the holy spirit move out the
[1:25:43] angel lord said now

[1:25:48] when they went to bring him he started
[1:25:51] kicking
[1:25:52] and frothing and biting he was in a
[1:25:55] straitjacket
[1:25:57] look at it since they brought him up
[1:25:59] close and then when the vision
[1:26:01] come and told just what it was
[1:26:05] a sin that had been committed
[1:26:09] by his father that caused a child
[1:26:13] to be in that condition the sun
[1:26:17] is in a straitjacket the boy
[1:26:20] is kicking and frothing and cursing and
[1:26:22] doing everything
[1:26:23] and the reason is boys in this condition
[1:26:27] is because something that his daddy did
[1:26:31] oh we need to catch this now we need
[1:26:34] something that his
[1:26:36] daddy did caused this boy to be in this
[1:26:39] condition
[1:26:40] listen listen listen some of our
[1:26:42] children are where they are
[1:26:44] because of what daddy has done
[1:26:52] hallelujah just stay with me here
[1:26:55] listen it says this uh uh committed by
[1:26:59] his father calls the child to be in that
[1:27:01] condition
[1:27:01] the father fell down and repented
[1:27:05] oh i like that right see the daddy
[1:27:07] handled this thing right
[1:27:09] when his sin was exposed the daddy made
[1:27:12] things
[1:27:13] right before god hallelujah
[1:27:16] and when he made things right before god
[1:27:18] let's let's read on
[1:27:20] says when the evil spirit went from that
[1:27:22] boy thousands times
[1:27:23] thousands of people in the stampede
[1:27:25] grounds there that night
[1:27:27] looked and like a great big spot and a
[1:27:29] black shadow floating around
[1:27:30] oh my was really uh it was uh really
[1:27:33] quite
[1:27:33] and and it went around out of the place
[1:27:35] out through the building and went away
[1:27:37] the boy got delivered once his daddy
[1:27:39] repented
[1:27:43] hallelujah there was sovereign grace
[1:27:46] given to this boy by a sovereign father
[1:27:50] once the daddy repented
[1:27:54] daddy we don't realize the impact that
[1:27:56] we have on our families
[1:28:01] i thought about how many boys out there
[1:28:02] right now struggling
[1:28:04] with pornography because they saw
[1:28:07] something underneath the daddy's
[1:28:08] mattress
[1:28:11] i mean they're struggling with
[1:28:12] pornography because they saw something
[1:28:13] inappropriate on television
[1:28:16] or on the daddy's telephone see we don't
[1:28:18] realize the things that we do
[1:28:20] impact those that follow us
[1:28:23] that's why i want to impact them the
[1:28:25] right way
[1:28:26] hallelujah as i thought about this this
[1:28:29] little vision
[1:28:30] amen that brother branham just shared
[1:28:32] the vision opened up and
[1:28:34] and just said hey uh told the daddy you
[1:28:36] did this you did that and immediately
[1:28:38] man repented the man repented
[1:28:40] and by him repenting it it caused his
[1:28:43] family
[1:28:43] to go free his boy went free a boy was
[1:28:46] in a straight jacket can you imagine
[1:28:48] that
[1:28:48] you you kind of want to ask yourself
[1:28:51] well what did the
[1:28:52] what did the daddy do that caused the
[1:28:54] sun to get that bound
[1:28:57] what did the daddy do hallelujah that's
[1:29:00] why i want to be careful about what i do
[1:29:04] glory to god and here's the other part
[1:29:06] to that if if i
[1:29:07] recognize that i've done something wrong
[1:29:10] that could have
[1:29:11] affected my family i want to quickly
[1:29:13] repent
[1:29:19] i thought about this and you know we we
[1:29:21] read this scripture i read this out of
[1:29:23] psalms 51 this is this is david
[1:29:27] repenting
[1:29:29] this is david uh recognizing that he'd
[1:29:32] done something wrong
[1:29:34] and and quickly he goes to repentance
[1:29:36] let's let's just kind of pick it up
[1:29:38] again have mercy upon me
[1:29:40] oh god according to thy loving kindness
[1:29:44] according to the multitude i attend the
[1:29:46] mercies
[1:29:47] blot out my transgressions glory to god
[1:29:51] it says wash me thoroughly from my
[1:29:53] iniquity and cleanse me from my sin
[1:29:56] for i acknowledge my transgressions and
[1:29:58] my sin is
[1:29:59] ever before me this is daddy you got to
[1:30:01] recognize amen
[1:30:02] maybe it's because of me that my
[1:30:04] children are where they are
[1:30:06] hallelujah glory it says against thee
[1:30:10] thee only have i sinned and done this
[1:30:12] even that sight that thou mightest be
[1:30:13] justified when thy speakers
[1:30:15] and be clear without judges behold i was
[1:30:18] shaping
[1:30:18] in iniquity and then and seeing that my
[1:30:21] mother conceived me
[1:30:22] behold thou desires truth in the inward
[1:30:25] parts i want to tell you that
[1:30:27] god want truth coming from the inside
[1:30:31] it's one thing to be acting a certain
[1:30:33] way on the outside but god wants truth
[1:30:35] coming from the inside
[1:30:37] hallelujah thou desires truth from the
[1:30:39] end with parts and in the hidden part
[1:30:41] thou shalt
[1:30:42] make me to know wisdom
[1:30:45] glory to god look at this it says purge
[1:30:47] me with hyssop
[1:30:48] and i shall be clean wash me and i shall
[1:30:50] be white in the snow
[1:30:52] make me to hear joy and gladness that
[1:30:54] the bones which thou has broken
[1:30:57] may rejoice it ain't amen it ain't
[1:30:59] nothing
[1:31:00] cowardly about repenting
[1:31:04] i want to say that he is nothing
[1:31:06] cowardly
[1:31:08] about repenting repenting can actually
[1:31:12] change the course
[1:31:15] of somebody's fate
[1:31:18] and and in the case of this little boy
[1:31:20] his daddy's repentance
[1:31:23] is what brought the boy freedom
[1:31:27] i want you to look deeper at this today
[1:31:30] amen you i mean sometimes we don't know
[1:31:31] lord is it what it may be something that
[1:31:33] i've done god that could cause my child
[1:31:36] to be in this place hallelujah
[1:31:39] god if if it is short to me have a heart
[1:31:42] and say lord show it to me so i can make
[1:31:44] that thing right because it just don't
[1:31:47] impact just that one child but when that
[1:31:49] child has children
[1:31:50] they still dealing with stuff generation
[1:31:53] after generation after generation still
[1:31:55] dealing with stuff
[1:31:56] because the one thing that i did
[1:32:00] let me keep reading here verse 8 it says
[1:32:03] make me to hear joy and gladness that
[1:32:04] the bones which thou has broken may
[1:32:06] rejoice
[1:32:08] i'll rejoice by seeing all my children
[1:32:10] serving the lord
[1:32:12] amen i've seen them all serve the lord i
[1:32:15] can rejoice in that
[1:32:16] but i want to make sure i haven't done
[1:32:18] anything to offend them
[1:32:20] something that would cause them that
[1:32:21] that they can't certainly on account of
[1:32:23] me
[1:32:24] and sometimes you know maybe uh maybe
[1:32:26] it's just a misunderstanding sometimes
[1:32:28] like i said daddy gotta lay down law
[1:32:31] there are some laws that i laid down
[1:32:32] amen uh as a father and i knew some man
[1:32:35] this is tough
[1:32:36] kids don't realize they they put you in
[1:32:38] tough positions
[1:32:40] they put you in places where you got to
[1:32:42] make some real hard decisions
[1:32:44] and let me tell you something i don't
[1:32:45] care um
[1:32:48] let me put it this way if you ain't got
[1:32:52] children it's hard for you to tell
[1:32:53] somebody how to raise
[1:32:55] children right
[1:32:59] and i'ma tell you there there is no no
[1:33:02] no no no no book that you can just go to
[1:33:05] that deals with every circumstance
[1:33:08] and gives you the insight that you need
[1:33:10] when this happened do this
[1:33:12] when this happened do that you got to
[1:33:13] depend on god
[1:33:15] through each and every one of them
[1:33:17] circumstance that rise up
[1:33:19] and you hoping that you're doing the
[1:33:20] best that you can
[1:33:23] but i've had to make some real tough
[1:33:25] decisions
[1:33:26] being a parent real hard decisions
[1:33:31] things that i probably didn't want to do
[1:33:32] at that time but but you put me in a
[1:33:34] place
[1:33:35] you make me have to keep my word
[1:33:42] you're gonna make me have to keep my
[1:33:44] words i don't wanna do this but you're
[1:33:46] gonna make me do it
[1:33:48] your actions and your your everything
[1:33:50] you all these decisions that you're
[1:33:52] making is making me do this
[1:33:55] and then i gotta trust god that at the
[1:33:57] end of all this that i haven't provoked
[1:33:59] them
[1:34:00] where i can't win them but
[1:34:03] as a father i got to be a father
[1:34:07] and notice god is a father not a
[1:34:09] grandfather
[1:34:12] when we get granddaddy duty everything
[1:34:15] changed
[1:34:16] i mean i i had the the privilege of of
[1:34:19] of having granddaddy duty this week
[1:34:22] amen i i had to watch my little grandson
[1:34:25] i'm just sitting there watching them
[1:34:26] just run back and forth and
[1:34:27] having all this fun and i'm like man
[1:34:29] whatever that fella wanted to do i was
[1:34:30] willing to do
[1:34:32] but if if it was his mama one of the
[1:34:35] other girls what nah
[1:34:36] get in that out you know that's
[1:34:39] where father talked but grandfather
[1:34:41] i'm in a different mode now
[1:34:48] but but but but as a father i realized
[1:34:51] that there's a there's a there's a tight
[1:34:53] line that i'm walking
[1:34:56] right i'm not trying to offend but i am
[1:34:58] trying to protect
[1:35:00] hallelujah right i i am trying to do
[1:35:03] something that's going to help
[1:35:04] help you in the future now when we
[1:35:07] when we look at david look at let me
[1:35:09] just keep reading here in verse 9
[1:35:11] it says have thy face from my sins and
[1:35:13] blotted all my iniquities creating me a
[1:35:15] clean heart see
[1:35:16] it's not a you're not a coward because
[1:35:18] you repent
[1:35:20] david did this says creating me a clean
[1:35:23] heart oh god and renew a right spirit
[1:35:24] within me casping out away from my
[1:35:26] presence take not thy holy spirit from
[1:35:29] me restore
[1:35:30] unto me the joy of thy
[1:35:33] salvation and uphold me with uh
[1:35:37] free spirit david found himself in a
[1:35:40] critical
[1:35:41] spot in his life david
[1:35:45] was amen just based on this scripture
[1:35:47] alone you can see why david was called
[1:35:49] the man
[1:35:50] after god's own heart um
[1:35:53] david was a perfect type of the lord
[1:35:56] jesus christ
[1:35:58] david was both a prophet and a king
[1:36:02] jesus is the prophet of all prophets and
[1:36:05] the king of all kings
[1:36:06] amen david was the one that was willing
[1:36:10] to take on this
[1:36:11] this this this uh um this giant
[1:36:15] circumstance that nobody else was
[1:36:18] willing to take it on
[1:36:19] david went out with a slingshot and and
[1:36:22] it's lou goliath
[1:36:24] hallelujah jesus was willing to take on
[1:36:27] death hell and the grave
[1:36:30] and this little giant that nobody else
[1:36:32] could slay
[1:36:34] hallelujah david opened a sacrifice to
[1:36:38] stay the plague of death
[1:36:40] at the thrashing floor of our man christ
[1:36:43] offered his life on a cross at that same
[1:36:47] area
[1:36:48] where the threshing floor was a perfect
[1:36:50] type of christ
[1:36:52] david was a pre-anointed fugitive
[1:36:58] while running from saul amen he was
[1:37:01] fugitive something
[1:37:02] it's something that's refused that's
[1:37:04] what a future is he was a pre-anointed
[1:37:06] king
[1:37:07] but he was a feuded of running from saul
[1:37:09] hallelujah
[1:37:10] christ is also amen he's been refused
[1:37:15] he is a future fugitive today because
[1:37:17] he's on the
[1:37:18] outside of his church trying to get back
[1:37:21] in
[1:37:24] this is what the book of amen revelation
[1:37:26] tells us in revelation three
[1:37:27] it says david i wrote out david was a
[1:37:30] rejected king
[1:37:32] running from his own son
[1:37:35] hallelujah absalom he was criticized by
[1:37:39] cheme as he was on the run
[1:37:43] shemayu was throwing rocks and sand and
[1:37:46] and all kind of words that david
[1:37:48] hallelujah i want y'all to catch this
[1:37:51] father now this father this dave david
[1:37:53] his father
[1:37:54] david is running from his own son
[1:37:58] sometimes fathers go through things in
[1:38:00] their life where their children
[1:38:02] turn on them
[1:38:06] their children turn on them but you know
[1:38:07] a real father you know what he does
[1:38:10] when that happens he prays for his
[1:38:12] children
[1:38:14] now david knew he could have whipped
[1:38:16] absalom as soon as absalom would have
[1:38:17] stepped on the battlefield
[1:38:19] but i i don't want to do that to my boy
[1:38:22] oh
[1:38:22] hallelujah i don't want to hurt my boy
[1:38:25] like that he'll he'll never recover from
[1:38:27] that
[1:38:27] right he'll never recover so let me just
[1:38:30] run
[1:38:30] let me let me get out of here this is
[1:38:33] what david decides to do
[1:38:34] right hallelujah but while david was
[1:38:37] running
[1:38:38] uh brother branham makes a statement
[1:38:39] says 800 years from there the son of
[1:38:41] david was climbing the same
[1:38:42] mountain looking out over jerusalem's
[1:38:45] weeping over jerusalem
[1:38:47] and as a rejected king saying you know
[1:38:49] jerusalem jerusalem
[1:38:50] how oft you know would i have hovered
[1:38:52] you i would have brought you to myself
[1:38:54] like a hand brewing i would have just
[1:38:56] brought you to myself but you rejected
[1:38:58] me
[1:38:58] david ran the same mountain that jesus
[1:39:01] ran up
[1:39:03] david was a great king but david had a
[1:39:07] problem with passion
[1:39:09] his passions is what caused him to have
[1:39:12] to write
[1:39:13] psalm 51. and i want to just kind of
[1:39:17] pick up something here in
[1:39:18] second samuel 12 because this is where
[1:39:20] we get
[1:39:22] amen some insight on why david had to
[1:39:25] write
[1:39:25] psalm 51. i appreciate him being a
[1:39:28] father
[1:39:29] amen that could repent just like this
[1:39:32] man that i just read to you this man his
[1:39:34] son is in a straitjacket because of
[1:39:36] something he did
[1:39:37] but the man was able to repent and
[1:39:39] through that repentance he saw a son
[1:39:41] set free last week as we were
[1:39:44] you know in church and and uh um
[1:39:47] i was just blessed by you know our
[1:39:50] sisters wanting to stand in the gap for
[1:39:52] their loved ones and as i announced it
[1:39:54] after the service after the preaching of
[1:39:56] the word we'll have a prayer line
[1:39:57] there was a few uh uh that a few people
[1:40:01] came up and
[1:40:02] and i was so pleased to see their dad
[1:40:04] father standing
[1:40:05] in the gap for their children i thought
[1:40:08] to myself i said you know what about
[1:40:10] that nobleman
[1:40:11] that came to jesus and said you know my
[1:40:13] son is at home
[1:40:14] dying would you do something to help my
[1:40:16] son jesus said go on back you'll find
[1:40:18] him
[1:40:19] amen well just based on your faith and
[1:40:22] the very same
[1:40:23] hour that the boy got well is when jesus
[1:40:26] told a man
[1:40:27] go home and find it the way you believed
[1:40:28] it
[1:40:30] this father's willing to stand in the
[1:40:32] gap on behalf of his son
[1:40:36] as fathers we've got to stand standing
[1:40:38] gap on behalf of our children look at
[1:40:39] this in
[1:40:40] second samuel 12. now
[1:40:44] before i give you a man this scripture
[1:40:49] a little bit more history about david
[1:40:52] david great king david
[1:40:57] had a problem with passion couldn't get
[1:41:00] control of his passion
[1:41:03] one day david was there while the arm is
[1:41:06] out battling he's at home and
[1:41:08] goes outside and when he walks outside
[1:41:12] he saw something that he probably should
[1:41:14] not have saw
[1:41:15] there's a woman a few houses over
[1:41:19] having happened to be taking a bath on
[1:41:22] top of her roof
[1:41:24] and david sees this woman taking the
[1:41:26] bath and and he uh he says um
[1:41:29] who is that and he started asking
[1:41:32] questions around the
[1:41:33] town who is this woman and they told
[1:41:36] david that she is the wife
[1:41:38] of uriah her name is bathsheba and they
[1:41:41] use the word
[1:41:42] wife well david saw this woman one too
[1:41:45] many
[1:41:46] times and he said i don't care who wife
[1:41:47] she is go
[1:41:49] get her for me now david did this at a
[1:41:52] time that he already had 500 wives
[1:41:56] and with passion like that there was no
[1:41:58] need for him to go after this woman
[1:42:01] hallelujah he already had a wife
[1:42:05] they're getting quiet in here right now
[1:42:08] now i'm going to tell you something else
[1:42:10] the reason that we believe the bible
[1:42:12] is because the bible have stories in
[1:42:14] this i mean they tell you the good
[1:42:16] and the bad it ain't hiding nothing from
[1:42:19] you it's giving it to you straight
[1:42:23] that's how you can get delivered when
[1:42:24] you get it straight
[1:42:28] david goes after this woman and bible
[1:42:30] says that he
[1:42:31] uh you know he got her pregnant and when
[1:42:34] he gets her pregnant he decides saying
[1:42:36] because you know she left the house that
[1:42:38] night and she said word said tell david
[1:42:40] i'm pregnant
[1:42:41] no no now her husband ain't there how is
[1:42:44] she pregnant when her husband ain't home
[1:42:46] so you know the husband's out of that
[1:42:48] battle david say uh
[1:42:50] send a letter by somebody by courier
[1:42:51] said go tell uh
[1:42:53] uh joab to send you ryan home he bring
[1:42:55] your ryder home
[1:42:57] you're in say uh and he had a battle
[1:42:59] going oh they doing this they doing that
[1:43:01] and i can't wait to get back out to the
[1:43:02] battle
[1:43:03] well man i'm calling you here for a
[1:43:04] little vacation you need a little
[1:43:07] vacation
[1:43:07] okay king he said here here's something
[1:43:09] to drink and just relax yourself and you
[1:43:12] know he got he got the fella so drunk
[1:43:14] and then at the end of getting him drunk
[1:43:16] he say now go on home with your wife
[1:43:18] enjoy enjoy some time with your wife the
[1:43:20] man went outside
[1:43:22] stopped at the at the entrance of the
[1:43:24] doe found himself a rock
[1:43:27] laid down went to sleep
[1:43:30] david went to bed and i said okay he's
[1:43:32] going to get home with his wife he's
[1:43:33] drunk and
[1:43:34] things going to happen and you know we
[1:43:35] going to put this off on him
[1:43:38] the man never went home so david wake up
[1:43:40] the next morning and walk out and have
[1:43:42] to step over you riley man what you
[1:43:44] doing at the house
[1:43:46] you're right your eyes say i couldn't i
[1:43:48] couldn't dare go home and have pleasure
[1:43:49] with my wife
[1:43:50] knowing that the soldiers out there
[1:43:52] battling no
[1:43:53] king i'm ready to go back i mean the man
[1:43:55] didn't even want to come home and go see
[1:43:56] his wife
[1:43:59] dedicated so today david said i'm going
[1:44:00] to try it again i'm going to get them
[1:44:01] drunk again i'm going to
[1:44:03] man did it a second time will not go
[1:44:05] home to his wife
[1:44:06] they would say okay i got to come up
[1:44:08] with something else wrote a letter
[1:44:11] wrote a letter and say now go get to the
[1:44:15] thickest part of the bottom
[1:44:16] uh the battle put this man uriah at the
[1:44:19] front
[1:44:20] and when you got him in the front and
[1:44:21] the thickest part about at a battle
[1:44:23] y'all withdraw yourself from him
[1:44:25] and let him get killed out on the
[1:44:26] battlefield
[1:44:29] and then not only this wrote the letter
[1:44:32] sealed it gave it to uriah
[1:44:38] to deliver to joab uriah never even
[1:44:41] opened a letter you talk about a man
[1:44:42] dedicated to the king brother adam say
[1:44:46] when you get to heaven that's the first
[1:44:47] person you want to go meet us uriah
[1:44:51] what a man here here david
[1:44:55] has this thing executed uriah loses his
[1:44:58] life
[1:44:59] when he loses his life on the
[1:45:01] battlefield
[1:45:03] they sent word back to david say this is
[1:45:05] what happened on the battlefield uriah's
[1:45:07] dead
[1:45:07] they would say well you know can't win
[1:45:09] them all
[1:45:15] nobody knew what was going on david
[1:45:17] thought he hid this thing
[1:45:19] and then here comes here comes uh uh
[1:45:22] bathsheba she's in mourning and
[1:45:24] and david say you know what as soon as
[1:45:25] she finished morning i'mma call her to
[1:45:27] to me again and and i'm gonna marry her
[1:45:29] because her husband's dead
[1:45:31] thought he could hide this sin
[1:45:37] we pick up in second samuel 12
[1:45:41] where his sin has been revealed now i
[1:45:44] need you to understand
[1:45:46] is when his sin is revealed in second
[1:45:48] semi-12
[1:45:49] this is where psalm 51 is birth
[1:45:53] sometimes some good stuff can come out
[1:45:55] some bad stuff
[1:45:58] ii samuel 12 look at this and the lord
[1:46:02] sent nathan
[1:46:03] see nobody told nathan this but god
[1:46:06] revealed it to the prophet
[1:46:09] oh hallelujah and the lord sent
[1:46:12] nathan unto david
[1:46:15] and he came unto him and said unto him
[1:46:18] there were two men in one city
[1:46:21] the one rich and the other poor and i
[1:46:23] can just imagine y'all just get on the
[1:46:24] scene with me because
[1:46:26] nathan probably come up and hey uh david
[1:46:28] how everything going oh everything's
[1:46:30] going well how about the battles well
[1:46:32] and we win and we got this i got the
[1:46:33] report about this got the report you
[1:46:35] know
[1:46:35] everything going real good prophet thank
[1:46:37] god says okay
[1:46:39] then the prophet has to drop in and give
[1:46:41] him a little parable
[1:46:47] it says uh there were two men in the
[1:46:49] city the man
[1:46:50] the one rich and the other poor the rich
[1:46:52] man had exceeded many flocks and hurts
[1:46:55] uh but the poor man had nothing save one
[1:46:58] little u lamb
[1:46:59] which it brought uh and nourished up and
[1:47:02] it grew up together with him
[1:47:04] and with his children and it did eat of
[1:47:06] his own meat
[1:47:07] and drank of his own cup and lay in his
[1:47:10] bosom
[1:47:10] and was unto him as a daughter brother
[1:47:12] branham say uh
[1:47:14] this poor man was feeding this lamb with
[1:47:17] the same spoon he was eating
[1:47:21] can from imagine that you know people
[1:47:23] feed their animals cats and dogs and
[1:47:25] stuff like that now they do that
[1:47:26] but this i mean to me i'm like oh no i
[1:47:28] don't know about that but but but but
[1:47:30] this is what brother man say this is how
[1:47:31] close this lamb
[1:47:32] was to this man he's feeding him with
[1:47:34] the same spoon that he's
[1:47:36] eating out of
[1:47:39] look at this verse four uh verse verse
[1:47:41] four
[1:47:42] and there came a traveler unto the rich
[1:47:45] man this traveler is david's passions
[1:47:49] a traveler unto the rich man and he
[1:47:51] spared to take his own flock
[1:47:53] and of his own herd and to to dress for
[1:47:56] the wayfarer man
[1:47:57] that was come unto him but took the poor
[1:47:59] man's lamb and dressed it for the man
[1:48:01] that was come to him look and davis
[1:48:04] anger
[1:48:05] was greatly kindled against the man
[1:48:09] and he said to nathan as the lord liveth
[1:48:12] the man that hath done this thing shall
[1:48:16] surely die now i want you to notice
[1:48:19] something
[1:48:20] david has pronounced death on himself
[1:48:25] oh hallelujah but sovereign grace
[1:48:29] was given from a sovereign father to
[1:48:32] stop
[1:48:33] stop death from happening to david
[1:48:37] watch this watch this watch this watch
[1:48:38] this and he don't he don't he don't you
[1:48:41] know he
[1:48:42] he thought he was something good i mean
[1:48:44] i got judgment on this uh
[1:48:46] uh oh prophet i got the man that did
[1:48:48] this gun die
[1:48:50] okay look at it look at it and he keeps
[1:48:52] on saying he should restore the lamb
[1:48:55] fourfold because he had no pity
[1:49:00] now he did this thing and because he had
[1:49:02] no pity now first he said the man should
[1:49:04] should die and then he got to restore
[1:49:06] the lamb fourfold
[1:49:08] this is david's own prophecy against
[1:49:12] himself
[1:49:14] let's keep reading let's keep reading
[1:49:17] and remember that verse 6 because i want
[1:49:18] to come back to it
[1:49:20] hallelujah and nathan said that david
[1:49:23] thou art the man
[1:49:28] thus saith the lord god of israel i
[1:49:31] anointed thee king over israel
[1:49:34] and i delivered thee out of the hand of
[1:49:36] saul and i
[1:49:37] gave thee thy master's house and thy
[1:49:40] master's wives
[1:49:41] into thy bosom and gave thee the house
[1:49:44] of israel
[1:49:45] and of judah and uh uh if it had been
[1:49:48] too little i would have
[1:49:50] i would moreover have given unto thee
[1:49:52] such and such things
[1:49:53] whatever you would have asked me for
[1:49:55] david i would have gave it to you
[1:49:58] look at this wherefore has thou despised
[1:50:02] oh lord have mercy he got busted on this
[1:50:04] one
[1:50:05] wherefore has thou despised the
[1:50:07] commandment of the lord what's the
[1:50:08] commandment of the lord thou shalt not
[1:50:09] commit adultery
[1:50:12] thou has despised the commandment of the
[1:50:14] lord to do evil in his sight and not
[1:50:16] only that that's
[1:50:17] not commit adultery and thou shalt not
[1:50:19] kill because he had the man killed he
[1:50:21] just breaking all the commandments
[1:50:24] look at it says in uh uh thou has killed
[1:50:27] uriah the hittites with the sword
[1:50:30] and has taken his wife to be thy wife
[1:50:32] and has slain
[1:50:34] with staying with the sword of the
[1:50:36] children of mind
[1:50:38] now i just i wanted to just kind of
[1:50:40] catch this because this is david's
[1:50:41] problem his
[1:50:42] problem is with his passions and because
[1:50:45] he had a passion problem
[1:50:48] he don't you know he done committed
[1:50:50] adultery with this woman bathsheba
[1:50:51] got her pregnant and then had a husband
[1:50:53] killed in the process
[1:50:54] all this because he couldn't control his
[1:50:56] passion
[1:50:58] now i need you to catch something here
[1:50:59] because i'm gonna keep just read just a
[1:51:01] little bit further and i'm i'm gonna
[1:51:02] break into something
[1:51:03] says now therefore the sword shall never
[1:51:05] depart from thine house because those
[1:51:07] despise me
[1:51:07] and has taken the wife of you right the
[1:51:09] hittite to be thy wife thus saith the
[1:51:11] lord behold i will raise up evil against
[1:51:13] thee out of thine own house
[1:51:14] and i will take thy wives before thine
[1:51:16] eyes and give them unto thy neighbor
[1:51:18] and he shall lie with our wives in the
[1:51:21] sight of the son
[1:51:22] of the son for thou didst it secretly
[1:51:24] but i will do this thing before
[1:51:26] all israel and before before the son
[1:51:29] look at this verse 13 and david said
[1:51:31] unto nathan
[1:51:32] i have sinned see it i it it it helps
[1:51:36] when you can repent
[1:51:38] david realized that i'm wrong and this
[1:51:40] is this is why i read
[1:51:42] psalm 51 because that's what it was
[1:51:44] birthed from this experience
[1:51:47] david said nathan david said he said i
[1:51:50] have sinned against the lord
[1:51:52] and nathan said unto david the lord also
[1:51:53] hath put away thy sin
[1:51:55] thou shalt not die see
[1:51:58] sovereign grace sovereign grace
[1:52:02] from a sovereign father david deserved
[1:52:06] to die for what he did
[1:52:08] but grace stepped in and stopped death
[1:52:11] from from from from overtaking him
[1:52:14] however we
[1:52:17] sow something we have to reap it
[1:52:22] and david made a statement in verse 6.
[1:52:28] he should restore the he shall restore
[1:52:30] the lamb fourfold
[1:52:32] because he did this thing and because he
[1:52:34] had no pity this is david's words
[1:52:37] david said he gonna have to restore the
[1:52:39] lamb fourfold
[1:52:40] even though david did not die his
[1:52:42] children suffer from his decision
[1:52:46] now i'm gonna tell you he had four sons
[1:52:48] to die
[1:52:50] the first son was the son from bathsheba
[1:52:54] the first one of his boys to go and and
[1:52:56] david i mean
[1:52:57] after she had uh uh uh uh gave gave gave
[1:53:00] birth to the baby
[1:53:02] david saw all these problems and he
[1:53:03] wouldn't have fasted and praying and
[1:53:05] doing everything he could
[1:53:06] but god allowed the baby to be taken
[1:53:08] that was his first son
[1:53:09] and and they said we couldn't get him to
[1:53:11] eat while uh while the baby was living
[1:53:13] how are we going to get him to eat not
[1:53:14] at the baby dad he said
[1:53:15] he saw him all talking he said you know
[1:53:17] what y'all y'all didn't want to tell me
[1:53:19] this but the baby's dead ain't it he
[1:53:20] said i'm gonna get up and eat i'm gonna
[1:53:21] refresh myself
[1:53:22] he said i'm gonna go to church i'm gonna
[1:53:24] do all these things i need to do i'm
[1:53:25] gonna get my heart right with god

[1:55:05] as you start talking things like this in
[1:55:07] church it get quiet
[1:55:09] but it's the bible anyhow and i want to
[1:55:11] tell you if people don't get control of
[1:55:13] their passions
[1:55:14] fathers if they don't get control of
[1:55:17] their passions they'll have
[1:55:18] worse problems than this in their houses
[1:55:23] the best thing you can do is repent to
[1:55:25] god
[1:55:29] i'm on i'm on just raped assistant and
[1:55:32] she'd come out from there and she saw
[1:55:34] her brother absolutely said what
[1:55:35] happened to you what happened don't tell
[1:55:37] me i'm not
[1:55:38] she just couldn't even talk i'm not i
[1:55:41] mean absalom waited two years
[1:55:44] sheep shearing time great celebration
[1:55:47] time
[1:55:47] and he went to the king and said daddy
[1:55:50] let all the king's sons
[1:55:53] come and fellowship with me we gonna
[1:55:55] have a nice big fellowship
[1:55:56] and and i got this thing all worked out
[1:55:58] nice barbecue and
[1:56:00] everybody gonna eat well and we gonna do
[1:56:01] this we gonna do that and say why you
[1:56:03] want all the sunsets i just want
[1:56:04] everybody to celebrate
[1:56:05] and while he was while he said let i'm
[1:56:07] not come i'm not get out there
[1:56:11] there's a gang already got a plot after
[1:56:14] i'm saying when you get it whenever we
[1:56:15] get them drunk i want y'all to slay him
[1:56:17] now absolutely i'm not gonna slam
[1:56:18] himself
[1:56:19] he say but i want y'all to take him out
[1:56:20] for what he did to my sister
[1:56:22] they got him i got i'm not so drunk
[1:56:24] absalom called for the boys
[1:56:26] to attack and they attacked amnam was
[1:56:29] dead just like that
[1:56:30] his second son remember he said 4-4
[1:56:35] david has lost the baby from bathsheba
[1:56:37] david's lost amnon
[1:56:39] i'm not and then after that you know
[1:56:41] absalom takes off and he
[1:56:42] he runs and he's gone for about three
[1:56:44] years now you know that's the next son
[1:56:46] that
[1:56:47] that david loses amen is absalom himself
[1:56:52] because when he comes back from being in
[1:56:54] in um
[1:56:56] hallelujah just being in exile he comes
[1:56:59] back from being an exile and when he
[1:57:00] gets
[1:57:01] back you know he's coming up with all
[1:57:02] these plots and one of these days he say
[1:57:04] i see all the people coming to my daddy
[1:57:06] to get wisdom and
[1:57:07] and get this he said i just wish they
[1:57:08] would talk to me
[1:57:10] because if y'all would talk to me i
[1:57:11] would do it this way i would do it that
[1:57:13] way y'all
[1:57:14] pretty much we don't need that anymore i
[1:57:15] can take care of this
[1:57:17] and he got a few people on this side
[1:57:19] hallelujah to the lamb of god
[1:57:22] because this happens in families
[1:57:26] he got a few people lined up with him on
[1:57:29] his side
[1:57:31] come on somebody y'all i'm talk
[1:57:34] this is father's day and father's got to
[1:57:37] deal with these spirits from their sons
[1:57:41] just a few people to follow them we say
[1:57:44] you know what you know what we're going
[1:57:45] to take over this kingdom
[1:57:47] here come absalom with his great plan
[1:57:49] and you know absalom reigning now and
[1:57:52] and
[1:57:52] david's taking off running from absalom
[1:57:55] shammay is throwing rocks at him and
[1:57:57] words at him and everything and
[1:57:58] you know you was never good king in the
[1:58:00] first place and all the stuff you did
[1:58:02] god getting you back for it now
[1:58:06] just going off on them and and one
[1:58:09] fella said should i let his his head
[1:58:11] stay on him let me take his head
[1:58:12] david said no god let him talk like that
[1:58:15] for a reason
[1:58:19] leaves and goes to battle and tells all
[1:58:21] it gives all the
[1:58:22] the the soldiers uh uh he said when
[1:58:24] y'all find absalom please don't kill him
[1:58:28] leave my son let me let my son live but
[1:58:30] don't kill him when you find him please
[1:58:33] after i'm in battle and
[1:58:36] and when the boys say i s he went to
[1:58:38] told joe episode i saw absalom hanging
[1:58:40] in a tree
[1:58:41] he had this nice long hair
[1:58:44] and he went running through a tree
[1:58:46] hallelujah that nice long hair he
[1:58:48] shouldn't have had it in battle
[1:58:50] he got held up by some branches horsten
[1:58:53] ran from underneath him
[1:58:54] and he just he just he's at everybody's
[1:58:57] mercy
[1:58:59] man say uh man say i saw him in the tree
[1:59:01] he hanging in the tree
[1:59:03] by his hair he said where you saw him
[1:59:05] man how come you ain't kill himself
[1:59:06] cause if i would have killed him and
[1:59:07] then they would have told you that i
[1:59:08] killed him then you'd be killing me
[1:59:10] so i'll show you where you're at when
[1:59:12] the show joe ab way was and joab took
[1:59:15] some hearts right
[1:59:16] through absolute heart this is david's
[1:59:18] third son
[1:59:20] it says the man's got to pay fourfold
[1:59:27] and you would think after all this
[1:59:32] bad stuff that's happening to david that
[1:59:36] maybe he'd just be discouraged
[1:59:39] but no it's because he had
[1:59:41] self-fulfilling prophecy
[1:59:44] coming forth out of his mouth this is
[1:59:45] why these things had to come to pass
[1:59:48] and not after he was dead while he was
[1:59:52] living he saw four sons go
[1:59:56] well the fourth one was when david got
[1:59:59] real sick
[2:00:01] and he's on his way out of here he's
[2:00:02] leaving
[2:00:05] he's dying
[2:00:09] while he's dying there's a a report
[2:00:11] comes to him
[2:00:12] from the prophet and from also best she
[2:00:15] would say now you know what
[2:00:16] didn't you say that solomon was going to
[2:00:18] be the next king
[2:00:20] yeah i said that so why is ada niger
[2:00:24] rising up saying that he the king david
[2:00:27] had to do something real quick and
[2:00:29] and and got got to the anoint at uh uh
[2:00:32] anointed solomon made him king and sent
[2:00:34] sent word out that solomon's king and
[2:00:35] then while they out there during the
[2:00:37] ceremony
[2:00:38] somebody got to add a night and say you
[2:00:39] know what they just anointed your
[2:00:40] brother to be king
[2:00:42] say oh lord he comes back and he says
[2:00:46] you know what
[2:00:46] just i know i shouldn't have did it he
[2:00:48] kind of barely repented
[2:00:50] i said no i shouldn't have did that say
[2:00:52] but you know just don't take my life uh
[2:00:53] solomon don't
[2:00:54] say okay long as you do what you're
[2:00:55] supposed to do you you know you're gonna
[2:00:56] be all right
[2:00:57] well a few days go by and you know what
[2:01:00] adonij's problem was
[2:01:06] passion
[2:01:08] see this thing will take over families
[2:01:12] from one son to the next son to the next
[2:01:14] son his problem was a
[2:01:15] passion he wanted abhishek the concubine
[2:01:18] to be his wife and they said anytime
[2:01:22] you took a king's concubine as your wife
[2:01:25] that meant you had claim to the throne
[2:01:29] he says he says he says he said he says
[2:01:31] uh um
[2:01:34] ask solomon cannot have abhishek he said
[2:01:36] but bathsheba acts solomon can have
[2:01:38] episode
[2:01:38] and solomon says no sons he won't he
[2:01:40] won't claim to the throne that's what he
[2:01:41] wants
[2:01:42] so he got he got he got a greater
[2:01:43] problem than passion
[2:01:46] now you're going to lose his life
[2:01:47] because of that request and he calls
[2:01:49] somebody to go follow my brother
[2:01:51] his fourth son dead because he said
[2:01:55] fourfold
[2:01:56] now the grace part the sovereign grace
[2:01:58] is that he didn't lose his own life
[2:02:01] and another part of sovereign grace
[2:02:04] is that the woman
[2:02:08] that he had a passion problem with
[2:02:12] god gave her a second son and that boy
[2:02:15] became king
[2:02:18] see sovereign grace from a sovereign
[2:02:23] father
[2:02:24] and i'm gonna tell you something about
[2:02:25] sovereign grace it don't have to ask
[2:02:27] anybody
[2:02:28] for permission
[2:02:32] does whatever it wants to do when it
[2:02:35] wants to do it
[2:02:36] without any explanation let me tell you
[2:02:39] something you fathers that have repented
[2:02:43] your fathers that might have done some
[2:02:44] things wrong but you have repented that
[2:02:46] is under the blood
[2:02:47] and you don't have to let nobody hold
[2:02:49] nothing over your head
[2:02:51] because you have sovereign grace from a
[2:02:54] sovereign father
[2:02:57] and your sovereign father didn't have to
[2:02:59] ask anybody
[2:03:02] what they thought about it
[2:03:08] [Applause]
[2:03:12] i want to just read a little bit from
[2:03:13] this message of grace
[2:03:20] i'm going to skip a little bit um
[2:03:23] paragraph 123 is where i want to start
[2:03:26] at
[2:03:28] thank god for his sovereign grace when
[2:03:31] david recognized
[2:03:35] that god knew exactly what he had done
[2:03:37] wrong he repented and psalm 51 was
[2:03:39] birthed from that experience
[2:03:42] there's a man that had a son in a
[2:03:44] straitjacket coming before the prophet
[2:03:47] to be prayed for but when he realized
[2:03:50] the reason this boy was in the
[2:03:51] straitjacket
[2:03:53] the reason this boy was in this really
[2:03:55] uh uh terrible conditions because
[2:03:57] something that the daddy did that he
[2:03:59] never repented of
[2:04:00] as soon as the daddy repented the boy
[2:04:03] went free
[2:04:07] look at this god had revealed it to that
[2:04:10] prophet
[2:04:12] said david there was a rich man lived on
[2:04:14] this side of the road and a whole lot of
[2:04:15] sheep
[2:04:16] he had a whole lot of sheep oh he was
[2:04:17] very rich a man lived on this side of
[2:04:19] road was poor
[2:04:20] he had one lamb he treated like a
[2:04:22] daughter he fed it out of the same spoon
[2:04:25] he eat with
[2:04:26] he slept with the lamb it was just like
[2:04:29] a daughter to him and one day a visitor
[2:04:31] came so instead of the rich man taking
[2:04:33] one of his own
[2:04:34] sheep and making a feast for the visitor
[2:04:35] well instead of that he went over and
[2:04:37] took the poor man's lamb
[2:04:38] and by force took the lamb and slayed it
[2:04:40] and made a fist made a feast
[2:04:42] now that was david's passions he had 500
[2:04:45] wives but when he seen
[2:04:47] uriah's wife instead of taking one of
[2:04:49] his 500 wives to peas
[2:04:51] or satisfy his passions he went took
[2:04:54] this other man's wife then he killed
[2:04:56] uriah when she become a mother
[2:04:59] david didn't know what he was doing why
[2:05:01] david was ready to pronounce judgment
[2:05:03] that's the way we
[2:05:04] are we can always judge the other fella
[2:05:07] but when it comes to us oh that's
[2:05:08] different david said the man will pay
[2:05:12] with his life
[2:05:13] that'll profit them eyes narrowed down
[2:05:15] said david
[2:05:17] surely you'll not die watch grace
[2:05:21] then go to work right quick the spirit
[2:05:24] struck the prophet said david's life
[2:05:26] grace surely you'll not die
[2:05:27] but the sword will not leave your house
[2:05:29] till it's thoroughly purged
[2:05:31] your heart for you you are that rich man
[2:05:35] or it was different wasn't it uh uh what
[2:05:38] what saved david
[2:05:40] when his own judgment said the man will
[2:05:42] die he'll pay
[2:05:43] to the utmost and he'll pay for it with
[2:05:45] his life and the prophet said surely
[2:05:47] grace
[2:05:48] surely you'll not die you'll not die
[2:05:50] david grace
[2:05:52] has saved you it was grace to save david
[2:05:56] david it was grace to david that saved
[2:05:59] him oh my
[2:06:00] if it hadn't been for grace where would
[2:06:03] we all be
[2:06:05] is that right certainly sovereign grace
[2:06:09] is from a sovereign one sovereign grace
[2:06:14] from a sovereign one sovereign what can
[2:06:18] it do
[2:06:18] sovereign can do whatever it wants to
[2:06:21] listen to this now sovereign grace can
[2:06:23] only be given
[2:06:24] by one that's sovereign and god is
[2:06:28] sovereign
[2:06:29] so he can he can he can give sovereign
[2:06:31] grace therefore
[2:06:32] being sovereign grace don't have to ask
[2:06:35] anybody
[2:06:37] it does what it wants to isn't that
[2:06:39] wonderful it don't it don't
[2:06:41] has to ask can i do this or shall i do
[2:06:44] this
[2:06:44] can i must i will i doesn't do it it
[2:06:47] does it itself
[2:06:49] grace is suffering therefore he can save
[2:06:52] the violence
[2:06:54] he can save the worst he can save the
[2:06:58] impurities he can save the immoralists
[2:07:01] he can heal the sickest hallelujah
[2:07:07] i thank god for his sovereign grace
[2:07:12] i think we have many fathers here that
[2:07:14] would certainly tell their sons watch
[2:07:15] out for this watch out for that because
[2:07:17] of this and even tell their daughters
[2:07:18] watch out
[2:07:20] don't don't be like a bathsheba but she
[2:07:23] even knew where she was taking a bath at
[2:07:25] she knew where the house was located
[2:07:28] and she knew the king would be up there
[2:07:30] she went all innocent herself
[2:07:33] hallelujah so a father able to kind of
[2:07:36] tell his sons watch out for the
[2:07:37] bathshebas
[2:07:39] amen right hallelujah a father that goes
[2:07:43] through and makes mistakes and has
[2:07:44] repented
[2:07:45] a sovereign god has given sovereign
[2:07:48] grace to that father and there is
[2:07:50] nothing against him
[2:07:51] i thank god for grace like that
[2:07:54] but i want to i want to forewarn you on
[2:07:56] this father's day be careful

[2:17:59] gave you that testimony the pastor took
[2:18:01] me to her brother who is about 62
[2:18:03] 65 he was crying like just a baby who's
[2:18:07] been beaten up
[2:18:09] he was just crying he had this pain at
[2:18:12] the spine
[2:18:13] and he was just crying and crying and
[2:18:15] crying nothing could stop the pain so
[2:18:17] the person asked me to pray we prayed we
[2:18:20] read
[2:18:20] sorry james 5 to 13-17
[2:18:24] and we prayed and in about five minutes
[2:18:26] he stopped crying
[2:18:28] and he held my hands and started
[2:18:29] blessing me in spanish and prophesying
[2:18:32] and i think rajah gave that already the

[2:18:48] dimensions came around the lord was
[2:18:50] blessed and we didn't have service just
[2:18:52] in their home and we prayed and
[2:18:55] sang with the old pastor so i went to
[2:18:57] coahuila
[2:18:58] and we had some services over there in
[2:19:00] my hotel room the lord did something
[2:19:01] wonderful
[2:19:02] there in the morning the people come and
[2:19:04] clean your hotel room so around 11
[2:19:07] 30 the lady knocked and she said can i
[2:19:10] come and clean your room and say yes

[2:19:14] even in the place they have
[2:19:15] two beds even in the single rooms they
[2:19:17] have two beds so i have
[2:19:18] my bible and other stuff on one bed so
[2:19:21] she saw my blue bible on my bed and said

[2:19:34] used to live in a
[2:19:35] he's a grand rapids michigan for five
[2:19:37] years so she was happy talking english
[2:19:39] and i said well let's talk about the
[2:19:40] bible since you asked me
[2:19:42] if i was a christian so we talk about
[2:19:44] the lord a little bit we talk about some
[2:19:45] scriptures about baptism
[2:19:47] and i give the word of the lord to him
[2:19:49] that lord made the way she received
[2:19:50] everything with her heart
[2:19:52] and before i went by the judge gave me
[2:19:53] some message book he gave me cod in
[2:19:55] spanish
[2:19:56] and the resume of the church ages in
[2:19:58] spanish so i gave one to her
[2:20:00] and i asked her do you want me to pray
[2:20:02] for you she said yes we prayed
[2:20:04] and then i let it go i had another lady
[2:20:06] also
[2:20:07] the next cleaner i gave the word of the
[2:20:09] lord to her i gave her the message
[2:20:11] and that way too and one security guard
[2:20:14] who walks around
[2:20:15] i give one of the books and i prayed for
[2:20:18] for him as well so the lord was very
[2:20:21] gracious
[2:20:22] and one family that i prayed for his
[2:20:25] father actually was taken by the
[2:20:26] chronovirus
[2:20:27] and he had a four-month-old baby girl
[2:20:30] and the baby was on on the verge of
[2:20:32] dying with some respiratory problems
[2:20:34] so we prayed actually i prayed for him
[2:20:36] on the phone before i left
[2:20:38] and by the grace of the lord when we
[2:20:39] went the baby was completely healed
[2:20:47] another brother too he had cancer of a
[2:20:50] prostate cancer
[2:20:52] and it was a bad situation so he had a
[2:20:54] surgery
[2:20:55] we prayed and he sent me a message about
[2:20:58] 15 minutes message he was blessing me
[2:21:00] and preaching to me and rejoicing
[2:21:02] talking about the goodness of the lord
[2:21:04] and the lord has done it already the
[2:21:05] lord
[2:21:06] gave him the healing we thank the lord
[2:21:08] and one old pastor he passed away around
[2:21:10] the age of 86
[2:21:12] his wife is in this 1775 somewhere and
[2:21:15] when we visited visited
[2:21:16] her we prayed with her and she had
[2:21:18] colitis and she was in tears and crying
[2:21:21] so we prayed for her we went back the
[2:21:23] next day
[2:21:24] and the lord has healed and she was
[2:21:26] rejoicing and thanking the lord for her
[2:21:28] healing
[2:21:29] and one sister they actually dropped me
[2:21:32] at the airport when i was coming
[2:21:34] the sister said the sister and the
[2:21:36] brother is called daniel and the wife is
[2:21:38] called
[2:21:38] malta in spanish martha so she said
[2:21:41] brother after your same one
[2:21:43] the lord gave me a dream i was sleeping
[2:21:45] last night
[2:21:46] and i saw the lord jesus christ come and
[2:21:49] all the body of christ
[2:21:50] we were raptured and we were moving up
[2:21:52] higher i said i can
[2:21:54] he said it's so real to my heart and i'm
[2:21:56] so happy for that dream because
[2:21:58] we've been praying for you to come and i
[2:22:00] know the lord was going to do something
[2:22:02] for me especially
[2:22:03] because she was praying for the baptism
[2:22:04] of the holy ghost she wasn't sure
[2:22:06] whether she's been born again or not so
[2:22:08] she asked me to pray for her and the
[2:22:09] lord gave her that
[2:22:10] dream and i believe to confirm that the
[2:22:12] lord has given it the best
[2:22:14] amen the lord is so good there were a
[2:22:16] lot of healing
[2:22:17] uh in places a lot of testimonies i'm
[2:22:19] still receiving testimonies
[2:22:21] and i will keep you updated ask the lord
[2:22:25] amino as i received a testimony a lot of
[2:22:27] families there's one
[2:22:29] family that were actually devastated by
[2:22:31] the coronavirus

[2:22:38] brother his nephew died of chronovirus
[2:22:41] two weeks
[2:22:42] his mother died four weeks
[2:22:45] his uh his brother also died so three
[2:22:48] people were taken and they were
[2:22:50] devastated so we prayed on phone and i
[2:22:52] went to visit them
[2:22:54] the lord sent us around his family his
[2:22:56] daughters were they were in a message
[2:22:57] but they were not going to
[2:22:59] services for years the daughters were
[2:23:01] reconciled to the lord
[2:23:02] his son gave me a church book in spanish
[2:23:05] i gave it to his son
[2:23:06] he's got three girls and had son so i
[2:23:08] give it to his son and all his family
[2:23:10] now want to come back to the word of the
[2:23:12] lord
[2:23:12] and so sometimes the lord can use
[2:23:14] adversity to bring blessing
[2:23:15] unto his people so just i don't want to
