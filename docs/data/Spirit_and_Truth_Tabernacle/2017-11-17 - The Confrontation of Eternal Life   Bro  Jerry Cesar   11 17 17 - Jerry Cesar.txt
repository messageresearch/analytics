him it man he's everything that we need everything we need you can be seated man praise the Lord [Music] man we want to just give opportunity tonight for anyone that wouldn't want to share a testimony here man just something that the Lord has done for you the Bible tells us to make known his deeds among men man so if God's done something special for you for your family or something you want to share we want to give space it man for you to do that on tonight yes I'm an axe that you just had this microphone because when we do this and they have the video going nobody came here god bless you I just want to thank God for I think God for his love he's concerned about me he is caring about me and his divine protection probably a couple of months ago I went in for my annual exam and they called me back within a few hours that I had left and said that my exam was abnormal and I needed to go get another exam so when they rescheduled it they rescheduled it about three weeks out and in this three weeks time I I just had so many my own battles I went through so much I found myself just filled with fear I was so afraid I was so worried I was so concerned I was I was literally scared and I just didn't know what to do but I wanted to be able to lean on God for myself I didn't want to tell anybody because when you ask for prayer you got to believe yourself or it won't work as far as I'm concerned and I was so afraid and so scared when I say afraid that's a whole different thing than being scared and I was so afraid that I didn't even want to say it out loud so I just kept trying to just get in touch with God for myself and I I found myself crying I felt alone I felt like I just didn't want to say it everything and so all those three weeks going on I was going through this so finally I went to the the doctor had the exam she had me sit down she said let me let the back to read it so while I was sitting in the waiting room I was there all by myself and I was really I was praying the whole time I was scared those three weeks I was praying as well but this time I was in the waiting room and I was just praying so hard but what it happened was in the meantime brother Jack had preached the sermon those two sermons on fear and they were right on time because they really just gripped my heart and I just went through my Bible and I found all of the scriptures that I could find on fear and I just covered myself covered myself with those scriptures and while I was sitting in them in the waiting room I just was praying and praying and just asking God to just wouldn't leave the fear I don't even know if I even I don't know if I asked him to take care of the situation I just asked him I remember asking him to relieve the fear so they called me back in again I had to do another exam the same thing and she say sit out there they're gonna check it and everything so I set out and I waited and I was praying again I I'm telling you I have I can't really count the number times on my one hand how close I felt to God at that time I just felt such a peace and I just felt like everything was gonna be okay and so that's why while I was sitting out there praying and just meditating she called me back again and this was the fourth time that I went in there for the first time was the the original time and then three more times his fourth design this time and I went in and the lady was just talking to me you know and then and I was nervous but she was just talking to me and talking to me and just teasing and stuff like that and while I was talking back to her I was just so relieved and so happy I didn't know what was going to happen I didn't know any results but I just felt so relieved and so happy the thing about it is those that whole time that I was going through I went through a lot of stuff a lot of mind battles in different situations but I just thank God so much for bringing me through and for just letting me know that he really is real and I know within myself I didn't need anybody to to qualify it for me I didn't need anybody to reassure me I knew within myself that I reached God for myself and I think I think brother Jack for just listening to God and just bringing those those sermons right on time I don't know who else it helped but it sure helped me right on time god bless you man certainly thank God for that and a man just bringing a conference trip to assist a copy man during her trial his word is a man is real it's real and all we have to do is apply it anybody else want to share tonight all right don't say you wouldn't ass god bless you um it's short and sweet I just want to thank God for just watching over me last night I hit a deer yeah didn't see it driving down jog it was dark and if anybody's driven down job at night the lights are out and they've been out for months and huh and the lights have been out for months and so it's it's literally in some areas just pitch-black dark and and and it was raining as well so I something was going on on the other side of the road and I looked over there because two cars have pulled over and I thought maybe they had an accident or something so I looked over to kind of just see what was going on and when I look back deer was right in front of me and so I just thank God because I didn't I didn't I didn't panic you know I just turned the wheel just a little bit so I wouldn't hit him head-on and he he just sideswiped the car and really if you looked at it you wouldn't even know that anything happened so I I just thank God because all the different things that you hear you know about people hitting animals and stuff and you know large animals and how either they're killed or the car is totaled or things like that and none of that happened but I mean I was just in complete and total shock because who hits a deer in Florida I just but uh but I just thank God for just um protecting me and and also if there were no other cars around me so I didn't you know um you know it could have actually hit somebody somebody else I could have ran up on the sidewalk or the um the median where it's full of trees so I just think God for just being there for me because I don't know how you I mean people and other you know kundur countries people in other states deal with it all the time you know I've never dealt with anything like that you know so just thank God for just giving me a clear head and just allowing me to walk out of that situation god bless praise the Lord certainly thank God for watching over a man's sister Erica during that time brother Troy say he should want a dog I was a deer it was a deer yeah but we we thank God for just watched over her anybody else want to share amen tonight all right sis get something so I went to the mall I got what I needed to get and then I had to go somewhere after that so I'm like let me go get something to eat so I got my food and then I then I left then as I was leaving the mall I just see police cars just

later on because of course I'm not gonna find out what's happening now so then I forgot about it and then I went home to my family and then my sister she mentions like she's like oh there was a shooting at the palm beach garden more and I'm like really I'm like oh my gosh like I was like soon after I left like something happened so I'm happy I wasn't like there when it happened cuz I think

shooting like just hearing a gunshot I people probably was going crazy you know a panic cause of that but I'm happy I wasn't there when it happens like I was able to leave yeah man certainly something

for me please do my best to be myself but I pray for me as I'm here I send it's a great privilege for me to just be able to present this word to you what the Lord has placed in my heart so I know you guys are my family so I'm home so I have nothing to worry about all right if you would just turn me to mark mark mark chapter 10 verse 17 just say man when you get me there and when he was gone for it and to the way that come one running and kneeled to him and asked him good master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life and Jesus said unto him why call us down me good there's none good but one that is God they'll know it's the commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honour thy father and mother and he answered and said unto Him master all these things have I observed from my youth then Jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever that has and give it to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me and he will say at that same and went away grieve for he had great possessions may the Lord add a blessing to his reading so I don't know about you guys but if the Lord told me to give up everything I had I wouldn't even have thought about it if God just told me to let him enter into my heart article let go of everything that I had that wouldn't be a thought but see if I could use as a title tonight it'd be the confrontation of eternal life see there's only one form of eternal life and that's his word and that's exactly what was presented to this young man I like to also go to Matthew 7 verse 13 Matthew 7 verse 13 says enter ye and after straight gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be which go in thereat because Strait is the gate and narrow is the way see he was speaking of a narrow path and just to dissect the scripture here the narrow path is telling us that few there be that find it see many are called but few are chosen see this narrow path understand that you can't walk on this path with with two people you can't walk on this path with three people you can't you can't turn left or turn right this crisis to lead you to Christ this path is to give you life see while there's a path that leads to destruction there's many people that's gonna find it but this path that's narrow it's an individual walk with Christ see the life is presented in two forms two roads two different journeys to different destinations see what all things being said there's one important aspect all that you have the choice of choosing choosing which road you want to take see if I can go to Strait is the gate and year 59 0 301 would you see a little bit what the Prophet says see he says he in paragraph 58 lot didn't know he was going to backslide see he went looking toward Sodom when things were easy and there's many times we look towards the easy way see this when you're on the right path the devil has one goal it's to lead you off it's to lead you off the right path so if the devil's attacking you tonight that means you on the right path so this lot didn't have any idea that he was gonna be lost but can I say this to you you have to be lost sometime to find the right road to take and many of us in here have been lost is that right we've been lost but now we're saved that's why we're here because we understand that we were walking on that right path and Christ out a hold of our hearts see understand when you're on this path you're not gonna have too many friends now a lot of people is not and I allow people's gonna like you and verse impatient of paragraph 59 it says if you follow Christ you'll be hated by people for all that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution and if you come to Christ you'll not come by any church or anything nomination or creed you'll come by the blood that's the only Avenue and you cannot bring no one with you you come alone and you stand on your own confession and your own thing and just to just to say this also your confession actually gives God permission see you have to confess what your situation is you have to confess what it is that you're expecting from God because if you're not confession what your need are you're not allowing God permission to move you see God standing at the door knock but you have to allow him to open up you have to allow him the permission to come in paragraph 60 says what if lot when he's seen everything he saw where there was where there was money much popularity because he had a strange because he'd be a stranger and smart man educated a lot of psychology and he'd do certain things and yet maintain his religion he thought I've got faith in God so I'll just go down into Sodom and I'll make some extra money and I'll become a great man we become power may be wonderful preacher see you you have to make a choice you you can't compromise your way to get to the life if you compromise your way your actions in your life will louder than what you have to say and it's gonna bring you to the path that leads to destruction and that's exactly what lot dad si la try to compromise he try to find the easy way while trying to find the easy way he find himself being lost see there are two roads but only one leads to life and you have to choose you have the decision to choose which road you want to take see if we can go back to the to this rich young ruler one thing that that uh that I came to see is he came to God and he kneeled to God and asked him good master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life and Jesus said up to him why have you called me good right there's no good but God and don't know it's the commandment see this young man came to God with a need he realized yes I've observed everything from my youth but I still have a need there's still something that I need that'll make me complete that was eternal life and if I could just say this as he approaches Jesus right this this was actually a form of prayer he prayed to Jesus and his prayer was answered right on the spot because he asked God what he shall inherit and God told him well go Vout go that way one thing that lack is go thy way sell whatsoever that has give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven his answer his prayer was answered right there and he didn't even realize it matter of fact he was talking to the answer cuz Jesus is eternal life is that right so he didn't realize what he had but but sometimes when you pray you don't know you're not ready for the answer you're not you're not ready for God to move and you have to you have to understand when you pray God is ready more than you are and that's exactly what happened see if God told me to let go and let God I would even I thought about it it wasn't even a choice and if I could just go here leadership passive leadership year 65 the Prophet says this young man this rich man when he come down a young ruler we talked about all religious and belong to the church and everything fine educated fine businessman and everything when he come to the end of that road he began to scream see he did all that he had to do he was a good man he had good education he went to school respected his parents right he kept the commandments but but in all of that there was an end to that road there was an into that road and he realized he needed eternal life to complete that road for him right he had nowhere to step so he'd been led by many other things he'd been led by the church he's been led by his education he's been led by his parents but they won't think he liked that he wasn't led by Christ and and here we find that Jesus seeing all the good that he's done loved him so it was something good about him he loved them there was something good about him and Jesus Jesus looked at him and told him what well young man all you have to do is give up all you have and give it to the poor right so if Jesus looked at him and loved him there was something real about the boy for the Bible says we found him in mark and jesus beholding him loved him so therefore there must be something real outstanding about this young fellow he had a good character he had a good character rating he was a man that raped I was raised right intelligent smart intellectual successful in business and a religious man had a lot of good characteristics that was outstanding but so much that it attracted the attention of Jesus Christ to save her but when he was confronted being successful in all of these things nothing had wrong he was perfectly cut out right measured up right intelligent right educated his success he was smart a fine businessman probably belonged to a businessman group somewhere there in Palestine he might have belonged to a businessman fellowship like we have no doubt about it because businessman has always had their fellowship with one another and when he was religious as he could be because Jesus had questioned him he said I have kept these commandments observed them from my youth that's right see he had been brought up right did this young man had everything that he mean but but he liked one thing and and and that's when you when you were confronted with eternal life the question is are you ready you you have to be ready to receive it because your life is what receives eternal life not now what you say not not not your faithfulness to going to church but it takes more than that to attract the attention of Christ you your heart has to be ready to receive it and I like I like how the word goes as we find it was one that rejected eternal life we also find someone else that accepted eternal life right so this young man living in this world thought he had everything he needed he had all the treasures of this world he was rich he had money he had nothing to complain about yet we found somebody else if we can this go to Hebrews 11 praise the Lord Hebrews 11 23 so we see by faith Moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the Kings commandment by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for the season esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the wrath of the King for he endured as seeing him who is invisible through faith he kept the Passover and sprinkled of blood less that less he that destroy the firstborn should touch him so so we see Moses by faith accepted the the promise of God he accepted the offer that God was giving to him and in all that he forsook Egypt he forsook everything that he had and and he accepted eternal life see Moses was rich he was a young ruler and he was to become Pharaoh he had everything that he needed he was filled with the knowledge the education but he realized that wasn't enough he realized that was a net and as he forsook that God dealt with him and took it took all of that away led him to a place where he had nothing but only to only forgot to lead him in the work of his of his fulfillment see and paragraph 250 the first thing when we had accepted to take the reproach of Christ and forsake his education that's the first thing he had to do he was thought in all wisdom of Egyptians and all of his popularity has thrown his Skepta his ski his crown everything he had he rejected it and this other fellow wanted it and refused Christ and this man refused that and accepted Christ and quickly what happened he Moses how to separate himself the minute that he rejected the things of the world he had to separate himself the scripture says if you have love for the world then the love of God is not in you see you you have to have the right kind of love if you don't have the right kind of love is going to lead you to destruction it's going to lead you to do things that aren't the will of God she claiming to be a Christian is is is like I said the life that you live that shows what you are it's this old rock LeMay ssin of the reflection of Christ but you can't be identified with Christ and be identified with the world at the same time Christ crucified the world he he dealt with that overcame the world and see being identified with the world but Satan doesn't always mean featuring yourself with with things like a highly offensive crime or things that are so out in the open but but what it is is complete disobedient to God if your life is not holding up to the obedience of the word then then you're not walking in a line of price you're identified with Satan and disobedient to the word is it's simply not having the love of God because the love of God is what draws you to be obedient to be faithful disobedient is what entices sin when you are when you when you find yourself in the midst of temptation right you have a choice to make you you have a decision to decide whether you're gonna go to the road that leads to destruction a little the road that leads to life it's your choice but disobedient is gonna be the very thing that places you in the midst of temptation when you're obedient in church in church how can a devil attack you when you're obedient in your prayer how can the devil attack you when your obedient and your fasting and your meditation on the word how can a devil attack you see you're leaving no room for sin and when you're on this road that leads to life see you you have to have eternal life and to have eternal life you have to be sealed you have to be sealed with the Holy Ghost see it isn't enough for you to say yes I've been enlightened by the Word of God and I've tasted the good fruits but but you have to be able to be sealed with the Holy Ghost see the Prophet says something interesting he says something interesting here it says and the breach between the seven churches in the seven seals in paragraph 74 he says you all have heard me say that people said the devil made me do this no no the devil didn't do it you just wasn't sealed in because when you were sealed in he was sealed out now you went to him he couldn't get to you because the only way he could get to you is to come to the same process that you have he would have been saved sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost if you went to the same process you went through and he'd be your brother see he didn't do it no you just went borderline and come back let's sing for the things of the world you never went all the way into Cannon you you you see Jordan and you just never went on way to begin with that's what that testifies see you have to be sealed by the Holy Ghost when you see about Holy Ghost you you leave no room for the devil operate you you leave no room for him to do anything that he desires because the devil has only one goal one plan the minute you testify what God has done for you he's already working on how he can destroy that of how he can eliminate your victory but see if I could just say sometimes we don't realize not closely out of victory because see oftentimes we we don't really not close to out the victory but if for just one second we were to open our eyes and and and I can put it as this activate your faith right we'll see how close we are to victory see in the midst in the midst of any doubt fear darkness right when you have when you have that kind of faith it bring immediate victory see it sends your greatest temptations that you find yourself having your greatest rewards right because you have to overcome something you have to put the activation of your faith and you have to allow God to be God in the midst of the temptation that's how you overcome so so see you when you're dealing with such you you should never try to give up but you should try to keep going your endurance in the midst of of your pressure only brings forth your faithfulness when you can keep moving the spite of what's holding you back you begin to be the very victory see victory isn't what you've done or what you are able to do but victory is simply exceeding and overcoming every doubt that tries to hold you down every time so you have to have that kind of faith when you're on this road this road has to be able to lead you to life it has to be able to produce the same fruits of the spirit you have to be sealed in and if you if you're not if you're not sealed in then then you have to you have to pray about it you you have to be in line with God's Word in obedience so that God can fulfill because God is waiting for you he stands at the door not but what is your confession tonight what what what what is your confession what about you is bringing glory and honor to Christ because Christ is raiding but he needs your permission he needs your permission so that he can bring forth the victory so that he can step in and give you eternal life god bless you [Applause] thank the Lord for brother Jerry a man confrontation of eternal life I like that two rows two choices to different destinations and just a real good comparison air of the rich young ruler and Moses both of them being well established but one made the right choice and one one didn't how brother branham even brought out the point that when when the rich none really got all the way down to the end the quote said he had nowhere to step he had nowhere to step you got all the way down to a knee I had nowhere else to go right no else to step in and I tell you what you don't want that to ever be your testimony that you get all the way down to me and you just got nothing else to do I want to go directly into the presence of God I want that to be my last step take me right into his presence right but but I tell you I just I just appreciate that that was that was wonderful Amen let's give the Lord another hand of praise for our precious brother man well let's just sing a little song before we dismiss I want you to continue to keep a man brother Jerry in prayer you know I just I'll tell you I'm this year just seeing out and just what the Lord is doing here in our midst brother Jerry his first time in Troy was his first time and when I heard both of them a man speak for the first time I said well my lord you know they got something that they need that you know that they can say and you know and I'm just grateful just to see how the Lord is just elevating one of the things that I have been praying for and asking the Lord for its help right we need help and and you know the other thing about that is that when you see things like this my biggest concern is that I let me put it this way all the brothers that since spirit and truth are not called administer I wouldn't want it to be that way I would want to be that way because we got a whole bunch of chiefs and no Indians we got problems y'all understand what I'm saying right what what we're trying to do is find where everybody fits in their place right and when you when you get into your place and you're anointed and what you're doing then the church just run they're very smooth right but but I don't want a spirit of jealousy to rise up or any of that you know I just I mean if somebody got an anointing you work with them with where that anointing is but but please you know you don't want it to be where man I'm gonna go do what I got it don't God will God does it in his own time right the Bible say a man's gift make room for himself and bringing him before great man and and and one of the other things is I never like to have anybody you know like my uncle told me that there's a man went to church one time and they say he went to told my uncle say I'm going to my past on something I'm gonna tell him to let me preach my uncle say no don't don't don't do that say no i'ma let him know I've been sitting here for a long time tell him to let me preach she said no no no when it's time for you to preach God will speak to your pastor and then tell you when it's time for you to go forward that's the way it work but you don't go and tell nobody this is what I'm gonna do cuz that's not God actually doing it that's you doing it right so well you know church let's be let's pray for one another right let's pray for each other and and and I want next year I'm looking to just kind of see these brothers just keep moving on and you don't just see God just use them and and I look up there everybody to get behind him push him on a little further a man encouraged their hearts and totally said something encouraging to you right and a man will just see what God got in store cuz it's I tell you what it's not a one-man ministry it's not a one-man ministry and that's that's not what it's all about but the other thing is we look for a life and the first thing if you can get you can have a gift but you ain't got no life we can't use you that's just bottom line there's got to be a life verse right so we thank God for you know what we've seen and a man and our precious brothers and and y'all just continue to keep them in prayer that the Lord will just continue to bless them and anoint them a man and just use them for his glory amen but let's not let's just sing a little bit of this a man I had a another clean heart song a man in my spirit but I like this one better amen and let's let's just sing this tonight before we before we depart and

to do this alone by ourselves it's not based on the next person it's the individual relationship that we have with you so help us God to keep our eyes focus keep our attention on you not to look at the left or the right the troubles of travels and distress is of life but to look to the promised Word of God to know Lord that if you brought us this far then certainly you will take us home so we pray God that you just continue to anoint and that you would continue to speak to the heart a man a brother jerison and Lord I'm just grateful for how I see you raisin up these men Amen here in this
