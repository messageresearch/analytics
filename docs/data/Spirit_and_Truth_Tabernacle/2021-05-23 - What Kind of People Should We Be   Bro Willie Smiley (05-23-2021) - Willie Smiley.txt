know ain't a lot of tricks and you know the young the youngsters they got a lot of tricks the ones that really singers you know they got a lot of tricks with their voices and all that and it'd be sounding good now don't misunderstand me but it's just something about some old school singing y'all know what i'm talking about sister erica when we used to go to them concerts and stuff me troy sister ty all all of us used to be young folk you know we go to them concerts and everything and boy i'll tell you what the brothers be singing in the head we shaking man we'd be right into it riding whether we gonna get in trouble or not the next service we get back we we we was we was about going to hit some good old-fashioned singing amen i tell you i appreciate the lord it's still good to know that you know some of us is still in the way still still got that same kind of anointing bringing down that same kind of presence of the holy spirit amen let us just buy our heads for a word of prayer this morning gracious father we just thank you once again for allowing us this opportunity to be in the house of the lord this morning we just want to remember uh brother jack this morning we want to remember all of the sick and shut in this morning no doubt they would have a desire to [Music] be in the house of the lord this morning uh we pray that father you touch the bodies and uh just keep them we appreciate amen what you're doing father this hour that we're in and we're just looking to you help us to hide ourselves behind the cross um use the gift this morning we just thank you for all things in jesus name amen amen amen let's just get our bibles out this morning it's it's good to be in the house of the lord let's remember the bishop this morning and i i was surprised to see sister erica when i walked in this morning i thought she would be with him but so remember him amen sometimes it's good to have your wife with him because depending on what you preach that might be the only amen you get in the service so it's always good saint john chapter 1 and philippians chapter 2 but remember him in prayer remember us we preparing to do a meeting together uh fourth of july weekend and uh it's been a minute since i've done much of anything but i'm looking forward to it and uh so y'all just keep me in prayer we thank god for the prayers of the righteous i'm feeling uh better i'm not where i want to be at in the flesh but i know by faith i'm already there i'm claiming it i'm i'm i'm walking like and i'm acting like it you know sometimes we talk about healing and people like i'm healed but you still got that frown on your face if you hear you're supposed to be smiling through it all moving through it all amen i appreciate having brother solomon with us this morning hey man thank god he was able to make it amen ain't nothing like that boy i tell you what i'm glad i got two cars i drive my dirty truck the church on a sunday morning before i miss miss church boy i tell you that's that's hard you just look forward to um getting to church appreciate brother troy troy got out of the way this morning boy y'all make it hard for a preacher to stay in that back room when y'all get to cutting up like that i'm like lord i ain't finished looking at my little nose but i'm ready to come on i don't know what's going on i can't see but troy like he tearing the building down by his cell all right when i came in he was looking tired there's something about when you get back here that anointing strikes you boy you'd be wanting to tear up something you could hardly contain yourself let's look at uh uh the book of saint john chapter one we'll we'll read the first maybe two verses skip down to the 14th and then we'll look in the book of philippians it says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same in the beginning with god 14 verse and it says in the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth and now let's just look over in the book of philippians chapter 2 we want to read the fifth and sixth verse it says let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation that took upon him the form of a serpent was made in the likeness of men and being fashioned as a man he humbled himself and became obedient to even the depth of the cross may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word this morning you may be seated um i want to use this morning as a as a topic uh what kind of uh people should we be now i i've kind of uh gone back and forward uh this week i thought i'd preach on a thought pertaining to the rapture this was my kind of my initial thought but then somebody wrote me a little something early part of the week and then i thought maybe i'll go that direction but you know when i started studying uh it just wasn't flowing so i said well i'll kind of um come back to our original thought now y'all just kind of bear with me for a little minute you know brother jew who used to talk about being a helicopter i've never been a helicopter i'll start out a little slow and then i pick up steam and then i just kind of ride and then i just float us on down so y'all just bear with me because we want we want to we want to um try to bring something that will help us um we i'll tell you what i don't know about you all but we've been having some wonderful services it's been some some wonderful uh word preach we appreciate brother um kwaku um on last week and you know brother jack has been doing a tremendous job and and just trying to transform uh our thinking right help helping trying to help us to you know uh really understand who we are and redemption and really what what this this word that's been given to us us in this hour is really all about uh we've we've made it about a man right we me y'all don't stop on me now we've made it about brother branham and things of that nature but i believe god used the messenger to to bring us something to show us who we are amen and and what what really this is all about we we messed it up he didn't mess it up humanity has done this and i thank god for the inspiration of the holy spirit is trying to uh straighten things out and keep a balance we because see one thing about the devil right if he if he can't get you on one thing he'll just try to push you overboard on something else and things of that nature so we we we thank i thank god for the inspiration of the spirit of god trying to help us to keep it keep a balance right uh uh and and keep things right down the middle of the road so that we can understand uh really spirits from a spiritual standpoint uh who we are right so often i i'm reminded of brother wes can he he used to always talking about talk about us living beneath our privilege and i and i believe that right i believe that that you know uh two things i believe that we're living belief uh privileges but i also believe that uh we're transitioning we're moving into something that's tremendous boy that didn't go over well how many people can say imagine that i believe now i want you to believe with me no this is not a trick i believe we're moving into something by revelation that's tremendous something that's taken us to higher heights and deeper depths right glory to god this is what i believe that's taking place uh and and why we've been we've have been given the word of god in the hour that that we're living right amen and and another scripture that i i constantly hold on to is is that faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of god so uh i believe the more we hear these things i believe the more we're becoming come on what we're hearing i'm becoming what i'm hearing as as god quickens the the revelation of what's being preached i am becoming that i'm not becoming what the devil tried to tell me i'm becoming what the word is telling me i am who the words say that i am i'm a king this morning i'm a priest this morning i'm the head and not the tail i'm above and not beneath amen i'm a lending not a borrower because that's what the words say that i am this morning hey man uh i you know i just refuse to feel sorry for myself walk around and have a pity party don't pity me pity the devil brother browner makes a statement in the seventh church age he talked about pitying pitying the lay out of sins right come on but don't pity brother smiley this morning cause i ain't pitying myself is that right i believe by the revelation of the word i'm becoming what uh the word has has for ordained for all of us to become we we we're becoming whether whether we fully some of us on different levels this morning right amen and may not fully comprehend some of these things but don't worry about that because you're gonna understand it i remember i remember 30 years ago and i i remember being in a meeting and brother coleman he made that statement he says you know he he read it from the message and even the scripture talks about it you know uh uh he says you you're gonna understand it and this this is during a time in our life where we shouted we we cried we had a good time and and we would go to the meetings and we would exhaust our resources and everything else and come back you know and didn't fully understand sister burns she know what i'm talking about mr burroughs um years and years ago we used to work for the same company and uh we had went to a meeting and uh we shouted we had we always had a good time at the meetings and uh we came back and i was i was at a break and i guess she was going on break and i was standing out there and i'm a newer convert than what they were you know and uh she said uh she actually said brother somalia i i i i want to ask you something and i said okay go ahead she said uh she she stunned me she said what is what is seven to seven thunders i stopped for a minute and i could just repeat what everybody cried sister she kind of smiled to herself but then you know but but you know break it down a little bit i can do it now but back then but the prophecy is what i'm getting at right he said we're going to understand it and we can say we understand this morning right it's it's it's not a mystery it's a revelation divine mystery truths contained that was contained in the seal and this is what we're feeding on listen church the word of god is not in a mystery to the believer y'all keep praying for me i ain't even got where i want to go at y'all might change my whole message this morning it's not in a mystery it's something that's been revealed and constantly unfolding to us giving us strength okay let me let me let me change change direction because i don't want to go that way um i i was i was thinking about this and i was studying this and i preached this years and years ago um in okeechobee and it struck my heart this week and i thought we bring it out because it's it's a a tremendous tremendous thought uh one of the things even the prophet of god he he he made a statement talking about uh jesus christ and the disciples and you know in his ministry he was just trying to really uh uh show them what he was trying to bring them into right and i thought it's the same thing it's the same thing today it's the same thing that when brother branham was on the scene he was only trying to uh bring us to a understanding of who we are because because we down through down through the age understanding had gotten lost and it was so much error in the scripture that that the only way that we could ever you know really come back to uh uh or manifest we got the cat to come back to the world because if if the word produced a certain kind of church in the beginning right it would take that same kind of word uncompromised pure to produce the same kind of church listen church let me tell you something god is not looking amen for a different kind of church than what he started out with if he started out with a pentecostal church he's going to end up with a pentecostal church not a denomination though experience the same kind of signs the same kind of wonders the same kind of miracles the same kind of order the same type of everything this amiga church because of the word seed that was sown will come to fruition amen right how many believe that brother branham he takes uh saint john chapter one all right and he he brings out a tremendous thought here he he talks about you know uh theologians and seminary teaching um um they could only bring you to genesis one and one in the beginning god created you know this that in the other six days of creation but in his in his his thinking he takes us beyond uh the spoken word right because we know the spoken word is the original seed but then he brings this understanding but it's going to get good after a while he he brings us an understanding to show us before the the word was right it had to be a thought now i'm gonna take my time this morning i'm gonna read a little bit um so y'all bear with me i want to set it up and and if if we have to pull off for the reading and preach it's in my heart we'll do that but sometimes and and if we have to do that go back to the word may flesh 1954 uh tremendous read maybe pick up round you know versus uh 160 something and and really read it i'm telling you do it anyway because it's going to bless your heart because i know sometimes i talk fast and i inspiration takes us uh different places but he says um in in breaking into this scripture and taking us beyond genesis one and one back to the the thoughts of god right everything that we see was was was a thought of god expressed god thought it god spoke it and it materialized and i started thinking it's like what what is brother branham trying to get us to you know see here i'm like this this is powerful right now remember what we've been we started out with we're we're kind of living below our privileges and he being he being the mouthpiece of god is trying to elevate us into a place that we can operate differently right we can we we can express something a life that's on a greater level right amen church i'm telling you i'm i'm be can i be real with you not just me included we're not operating where we're supposed to be operating i'm telling you i was thinking on another thought that i had um stand still and see the salvation of the lord uh i got so many different little thoughts and i was thinking you know the the moment something happens in our life the first thing we do is we we approach things carnally first we approach things in our feelings and in our emotions and our this and that we don't we don't necessarily operate as as as masters [Music] we don't we don't because if if if you say something or you offend me i automatically first right because you know uh of the gates us being triune beings and things of that nature right uh the the outside the inside automatically my ears and my eyes and those are the inlets right even though i'm a son of god i haven't fully conquered those realms yet right see jesus jesus one thing about it too jesus jesus uh he came in a different form than we did we bypassed our theophany to be tested and tried right amen to be become overcomers but uh when when things happen automatically i i automatically operate calmly a lot of times before the spirit got to come in and talk to me after a while right but we should be as christians now we still going somewhere uh operating from a different place because we supposed to be mastering circumstances and situations if something is happening right or it's something that's been said it's it's happened and been said because god allowed it right amen for our benefit right for our benefit to just really because sometimes we think more highly of ourselves than we ought to y'all know what i'm talking about sometimes we think we we're super spiritual until you know especially if it's happening to somebody else we get real super spiritual until the thing comes to our door and then we lose all spirituality all right y'all gotta preach with me this morning when it's happening to brother smiley we super spiritual but when it starts happening to you oh praise god please church break with me where your spirituality at now it's at your house it's at your door it's your it's your children come on i'ma leave that alone this morning i believe that ain't that ain't my mess but see y'all get quiet on me y'all start pulling that gift will go to operate uh but but i'm trying to i want to try to bring us into something that i i i think that's tremendous and and brother branham and and uh bringing this out he he makes a statement he starts to show us the kind of church that we ought to be because because he he he makes a a a statement you know as as he's bringing these things out in in verse 81 he said what kind of people should we be right if the whole if the very holy spirit has us so embodied or empowered that then he start but uh talking about thought but i'm getting ahead of myself and so and and thinking about you know the thought and and us coming to this place it's like what's the vehicle that that we must take to bring us right to bring us to a place that that we operate the way uh uh that we're supposed to be operating that we can bring what he's talking about into fruition right so so let's let's look at let's look at that uh for for uh a moment right um you can't get around it right it's kind of like the tower of babel you know you you can't bypass the atonement right uh you you just got to come god's provided way this this is this is something that i'll hold on my entire ministry since virginia tell you i say this at least a couple of times a month i don't know if they ever got tired of me saying it but it's always been what i believe you you you can't come your own way i've heard people kindly say you know uh there's there's many ways to god it's not he said i'm the way i'm the door and that you can't get there if you try to bypass me even in one scripture says you know he sit down invitation and one fella he thought i could slide in a window and and and and you know uh the the individual was like look wait a minute how did you get in here right he felt like he could bypass the process and he'll be all right y'all gonna preach with me but then he was found out see he thought that he could he could come another way and and and and he was exposed because everybody that came through the door got a rope everybody in there looked the same he was odd because he came amen another way right brother that's right right and he was kicked out see so so you can't bypass the processes you know i hear i you know sometimes i i listen to how much time do i have sometimes i listen to young preachers nowadays and and and we've we you know i don't tell people what to do with their time and i know we got all these different resources but i thank god for the holy spirit you know you you look a lot of the younger guys especially around the revealed word that had raised up you know you you start getting inspired from the from the outside right and and to me that has been the detriment of the young ministers that were coming up because they were inspired contrary to the word right you you got to come back to the bible right this is what the prophet of god uh taught us back the pentecost back to the beginning you gotta find out amen uh uh um he's god or he don't change what god did in the beginning was sufficient right but we've gotten to the place where we you know this is the millennial i don't care what generation this is no matter what generation this is it does not supersede the world we're talking about we're dealing with an infinite god a god that could predestinate who who knew what what what uh a year that i would come come to him knew amen the day i would be born the hour of the very minute he knew i was gonna be bald head brother solomon before i lost all my head he knew you would me too i remember when i met brother solomon years and years and years ago before he went to uh uh carolina he had a head full of hair like me now we both bought here all our hairs on our chin and around our face praise the lord it'll grow right here i had to cut that thing off last night i said man it won't do nothing but we we have these ideas that because we're dealing with millennials what makes millennials uh any different than baby boomers a lot of priests whitman now or any other the named generations that uh we have huh what what makes them because the bible says really not much uh new under the sun right maybe things might have a different twist to it but and we're dealing with an infinite god god knew and this is why god knew that what he he give the people would would transcend and and stand the test of time amen right right if it brought a conversion and a change in a transformation in this individual and this is what the prophet taught right it'll do the same thing when the next cause there's another generation coming on every day right we get we millennials what that got to do with it then what about the generation after y'all i don't even know what the name is i looked it up a while back but i don't forgot right huh ginzi okay then they're saying well you you you millennials we we the ginseng the jesse or ginseng or whatever we're we're in they strutting around amen with agency huh y'all gotta talk to me up in here glory to god and and and and you know we we more advanced than you millennials and they get their arguing back and forth and and with we're talking about the author of the book we talking about an infinite law we talking about a knowledge that supersedes all generational knowledge the bible says men will be running to and fro and knowledge is increasing but they ever learning and never able to come into the knowledge of the truth [Applause] right boy y'all preach with me today so let's let's let's let's look at look at this this morning because it hasn't changed that's right we cannot ever get too deep right to where we we stop preaching the new birth right every generation must be preached the new birth right you'll see how important this is because we'll get into it if god's grace god's thoughts versus our thoughts right because see it was god's thoughts that came from a pure source right and and all of this and that that brought this everything into existence right and then if we if we're to uh be little messiahs and amateur gods right then then if anything is going to be done our thinking right our thinking has has to be coming from that same place but i'm just kind of setting this up but i want to go here because to me this is important it's something that you can't get around i know we don't got deep now but a lot of folk ain't even born again come on i'm cool with our singing i'm cool with us shouting but we we we gotta be born again that's the only thing that's gonna keep us oh glory to god that's that's the only thing that that um is going to keep us there's an understanding that we we we gotta know right brother bannon um on verse 213 he says talking about as a man thinketh right he said it it has to become a thought before it can become a word he says and a word express materialize but i'm just kind of reading that because it's there he says i believe in my heart that um i'm a christian right that's important that's important when i'm struggling that's important when i'm uh uh messed up that's important when you don't cut somebody out oh glory to god y'all got quiet on that yup y'all open your mouth at the wrong time don't tell me don't try to sit here cute and sanctimonious and all that yeah praise the lord you might not just cuss but hey if you ain't careful and this thing ain't something y'all don't go to sleep on me now this sunday morning we shouldn't be going to sleep sunday morning amen now i got the longest drive i thank seth for brother solomon they wild awoke they whipped me so all the rest of y'all don't be nah all right amen so so he says i believe in my heart that i'm a christian because i've accepted the lord jesus christ if i don't cry and see this these things to me this is good because we get messed up i've watched so many young people teeter back and forth right that had genuine experiences and see here's the thing god can't save you today knowing he gonna leave you to mar lose you tomorrow he ain't that kind of god right it's it's just that you got we gotta know uh and believe in our heart as a man because as long as you think in your heart that you're a christian you're a christian see he says uh if i don't cry if i don't move if i don't do a thing in my heart first i believe come on in my heart first i believe that christ died for me in my stead amen i accepted it as a christian i believe it as a christian come on y'all come on y'all now now i know some of y'all been around a while but these things i think sometimes we need to go back over for for our younger generation it's what you believe right it's i believe it as a christian then it's in my heart right because that was once upon a time man i i wasn't never good at being a thug but i was trying i'm better off believing this than i ever was a man as as a as a a gangster i never wasn't really that good at being a gangster you know i used to try to tell myself that i was a tough guy but now don't bother me now you push you push any animal in a corner he'll come out fight right but but it's in his heart then i express it in in a word right see i'm a christian see no matter i make mistakes right right but i still i'm a christian amen because i must make my mistakes in the flesh not from the soul i'm i'm i'm i've been born again down in here i just got to keep this subject to the world right you know i'm like the chief the chief was all right brother troy you know he was in the ballot just like whatever one i feed the most that's the one that's the strongest if you don't feed the white dog the black dog be crazy y'all know what i'm talking about he says then i start he says um you start expressing it in the word i'm a christian right hallelujah then i start walking as a christian talking as a christian living as a christian see i ain't straddling the fence cause you can't love god and mammon right you ain't in certain places you're not gonna see me come on you ain't gonna see me in the club yeah i mean post it up on the corner and and all that you're not gonna see me that i remember when i was a young convert and uh um like i said i kind of grew up where i grew up in revere and everything and uh i remember once i got a car and uh uh uh i was uh figuring i'd go on the corner one day and and i would i would um i would uh try to show the guys that i i'm a christian now and something spoke in my heart and said you know what you don't know what these guys is doing and and and you standing up here here up here because most of these guys can't shoot you end up getting shot for something that you didn't even do right i said oh that makes sense that makes sense that was the last time i ever tried to go hang out on a cone right i'll haul that up with the homies if i see them in a neutral territory in the mall at the store or oh and i ain't trying to go to your house i ain't trying to do all of that right because we we different i remember back years and years ago when i lived in riviera beach for a short period of time and uh before i became pastor but jane was the pastor and all of that and uh you know i lived i lived in our old house in the hood right and you know my boys one day they was happy when they found out i was back you know they came down the street smiley what's up why you know y'all know how they do y'all know how we do y'all watch hot why they got their little cups of honey and and everything and uh while i start on boy i let them get all that out then i told him i said listen bro i'll tell y'all something uh and this time we used to have some bible studies at the house and uh i used to do a little cooking back in them days and man look at here i told them i said listen man you know i'm different i'm a christian now i say i don't do that he said i would i told him i said i would appreciate if y'all don't ever ever come to my house with cups i say cause in a few minutes i i'm gonna have a bunch of believers coming to my house for bible study now y'all welcome that's the last time i seen him right that was the last time i seen him you know come to my house i moved right why because i was a christian i was walking like a christian i was acting like a christian i was living like a christian now this is the long way i don't know if i'll get to fully but maybe this is just maybe what we need today because we we gotta we we got to have an absolute right right he says about and by uh he's saying then by my fruits i'm recognized by the world as a christian right old globe see that that's not a bad thing that's a good thing right the world recognizes you as a christian right uncompromised here christian praise the lord yes i'm a christian i i i'm sad because i'm a christian this has been the best light the best thing that ever happened to me like they say jesus is the best thing gotta wake y'all up jesus is the best day i know that was a change over jane cleveland changed that over gladys knight but it's the truth anyhow jesus is the best thing that ever happened to me i wouldn't even know y'all if i hadn't become a christian [Applause] let me pull my glasses off for this huh i wouldn't know brother troy i wouldn't know my mother-in-law i wouldn't have never married her daughter huh i wouldn't know sister erica's sister tina they wouldn't be my nieces sister virginia never would have came in contact with her sister kyle wouldn't know this clown up here if it wasn't for being a christian that's my little brother right there god god took my baby brother from you he gave me another one huh i i wouldn't know y'all y'all wouldn't see think about something when when folk is sad you wouldn't know who you know you wouldn't be erica wouldn't be married to brother jack right come on so i never would have met sister tonya if she hadn't been a christian her mother brought her to church huh into my recollection he put in work he wasn't her first choice they said tanya had a big bodybuilding type dude trump said he put in what he put in work changed her mind glory to god huh but it wouldn't be no opportunity if she hadn't became a christian is that right glory to god let me tell you something when i when i think about what god has done for me i'm happy i ain't sad man i you know what church i've been to places that i never could have even imagined going six countries so far i don't know how many states i'd have to count them up the people that i know people call sometimes i'll be out and people be god bless you brother smile i'd be like i don't know their name but people know me ain't nobody but you know they think i am so i'll take i'll take that from them right glory to god the devil tries to sometimes get me wrestling with the thought of what i don't have and who i right but watch let's keep moving he says y'all just weighed a red flag if i'm taking too long he says we're christians by faith by faith through the grace of god we are christians god in his infinite mercy cause called us this 216 uh in that same message everything will come out that same message call us to be reconciled to him through his son christ jesus settles it not what we done what he did he changed my soul from the things of the world until the things of god from the horse races gambling well i was who i showed up was a gambler back in the day but i wanted to get on my bank boy boy i see you down there at that park shooting them dice like mama we po that was my excuse we ain't got no money you got five children this is the only way i can make money halfway without going to jail i'm gambling but god thank god he took that out adultery line stealing right he changed my soul chain watch this now we coming into something powerful right he changed my thoughts right because because as a sinner right you think as a sinner right especially based upon your surroundings i when i grew up in in florida and and in new jersey and and based upon my surroundings that that molded a character in me my thinking i thought a certain way right i thought a certain way right and and so by my thinking right uh i expressed things a certain way because it was my thinking the way the way that i thought because of my surroundings it molded me my actions see brother branham taking us on a journey right showing us that our thoughts has got to be changed right in in order in order to really become the kind of church that god is looking for this had to take place right y'all can keep that back up okay he said he changed uh my soul changed my thoughts then my thoughts became so real till they became words in my lips and they materialized now i'm a christian it made me a different person that's what made you we all could say man i know i'm a dis different person because i'm okay so boy i think i thank god i'm a different person because if you cross me you pay for it believe me i i remember when i first got saving they started meeting me and all that they just say boy you just look mean that was more than just looks you cross me oh why why thank god for jesus it made me a different person huh i'm but i'm glad for the person that i am i'm happy for the person i ain't perfect but i'm but i'm on my way things i used to do ah don't do no more places i used to go on and go tomorrow right he says now watch he said paul said though i speak with tongues um this is 2 22 22 22 22 20. paul said though i speak in tongues a million men and angels and have faith to move mountains though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor have my charity i'm nothing right it's got to be a change right it's got to be a change see this is just a simple but it's a revelation that everybody got to have it's got to be a change you can do all of these works and there's no change it don't mean nothing the change the transformation right of our thoughts be transformed by the renewing that's right huh of our mind aren't y'all glad for a renewed mind i am see anything else is just the devil trying to maybe fly over and make a a nest and that's what people wrestle with they didn't let the devil land oh glory he done built them a little nest up there he just sitting there but the bible said we cast that stuff down anything that tries to rise above the word of god i cast it down amen but you say what are you what are you getting that this is the vehicle right this is the understanding that you must have see when this drops in the heart of every individual that that comes to choke church that's the game changer that's the game changing right glory to god uh he says um it's got to be a change it is he said a change of heart not of this physical thing but the heart of your soul in something something anchors to watch this your thoughts do that way is dull you don't see that no more see you you just see the lord jesus you see righteousness holiness purity and love and grace that's when you've been changed right what is a convert convert means to change something over and your thoughts your habits your being has been changed from a sinner to a christian first thing you know in your heart right then you express it with your lips and then it materialized and that's what you are that's first we can't get around that right oh my now if you think that uh um he's going to get into something here right he says um 22 2 2 2 2. now if you think that you think it what a word but you imagine you think it and you express it and it doesn't materialize then you're on the wrong road see here's the thing right church for us i might bypass a few things and god knows y'all go back and read it i i well i'll tell you lord have mercy um these things are so important this this change is so important for us church right amen in in order to to get us to a place where we begin to really express the thoughts of god now i'mma hit this little little bit and then i'm gonna go cause i think i'm wearing y'all out i don't know y'all looking a little weary on me right lord maybe troy took it all out us with the singing y'all shouted too much now you know how that go we sit down and you know everything leaves us but in in the thought what what what i gathered from the message that brother brown was preaching and simplicity he was just really trying to show us by taking us back the kind of church that we should be so he starts to talk and we kind of started out what what is a word right uh 172. see a word is the manifestation of a thought is is expression of a thought he says that right before you can say anything subconsciously you think it before you speak it so so you say well all that you was talking about what was that all about your thinking has got to change right you you in order to express the thoughts of god you can't think like the world come on now see you you i i'll give you for instance it was it was some brothers doing some things when when the disciples was on the scene they was following the son of man they were caught they was trying to they they look at their thinking they saw somebody doing something that wasn't in their camp they wanted to man let's rain far down jesus say lord have mercy y'all don't even know what y'all doing come on church yeah see that that type of thinking was not coming from a pure source right that thought i wrote some things down on my tablet see i thought this is why the birth is important and and the change is important so that our thoughts could be running from this pure source right our thinking has got to be changed our character right see this is why jesus jesus could do what he he he did right it's because of the thoughts right and the channel that it was coming through it was pure we go back to genesis in the beginning right pure thoughts right pure thoughts everything that he did was was righteous was right right when he thought about a family and he spoke of family that was right wasn't nothing ill about that let there be and and everything that came into existence because he had fatherhood in his mind glory to god when he let there be this let there be that that was because in his thinking amen he had fatherhood and being a father he had to be a provider a protector oh y'all ought to preach with me come on ain't gonna be long amen so it was it the the expression of god wasn't nothing ill faint nothing demonic come on church see you say well why you say this because we got to watch our thoughts huh we we got to be able to differentiate between the thoughts of god and the thoughts of amen satan when you get because the devil is a good adversary and when things happen right you you got to you you got to know now this is coming from the devil right and and i cause we love creators the power of life and death is in the tongue and so we cannot be a man expressing satan's thoughts right look at look at for instance the children of promise when they crossed over and the 12 spies came back right look at their thoughts right man we like grasshoppers look what they was expressing right right amen through through this that the eye gate they were like boy these boys big these fellas is big right man we like grasshoppers in their sight they couldn't there was nothing about them that was like but we the people they big the bigger they are the harder they fall huh all that they could do because of that gate we say boy and then they start expressing it they start going through the church y'all ought to preach with me man let me tell you something boredom guys over there boy they big they big boys boy we small compared to them but see they fail to realize they had a big god on their side come on come on church see that they was they was looking at the natural and carnal and how they were going to defeat them amen through through carnality instead of we're going to defeat them because of the promise that's been given to us by god see but you know here's two individuals that came out saying shut your mouth don't you say another word in the church oh y'all got to preach with me you see how timid we be around church we we'd be acting like a bunch of cowards but let me tell you something joshua and caleb say man caleb like shut your mouth right now y'all have been y'all have probably been trying to kick them out the church they were they were they were uh uh expressing amen uh something that was not coming from the word or through the word right amen when they was like look they knew listen joshua and caleb knew what they were standing on right amen glory to god yeah they might be big what that got to do with it what what that got the the big the bigger the trap wait i got to go with it i'm a son of promise god made abraham a promise and that that through this promise his seed shall possess the gates of his enemy right glory to god but look at their thinking and because of that thinking look what they expressed but we've been changed come on church we we've been changed give me do i have 10 minutes glory to god if we got any visitors this morning who ain't familiar y'all just forgive me my mama said i'd be long-winded on sunday morning my momma tried to look at me a couple of times on video she's i talked to her she said boy i was with you for about an hour but you were still going after an hour and say mama forgive me i be ha i have so much bottle bottle up in me and i ain't got no outlet now i have to wait on brother jack because i ain't started getting out yet so i'll be loaded i'm i'm like i'm like i'm like i'm like brother brother he said he got anointed and woke his wife up and start preaching the heart so the erica know what i'm talking about but jack probably get fooled and just preach our head oh amen okay so he says and and just trying to bring us an understanding and y'all give me five minutes i'm gonna go he said uh so in the beginning was the word and and and that's as far as we can go back by this theology he said but before the word it was a thought and the thought was made manifest you see what i mean now that's how that he said first he thought so you see why i i think in his thinking has got to be thinking based upon the word he spoke the word and the word was made manifest he said oh how infallible god is right notice every thought when it is spoken you see why why our thoughts has got to be the thoughts of god right because there's a difference i thought versus and i'm skipping over right but i'm just going to say it uh for time sake i thought brother brown say run different right because see we we could think one thing and say another that's hypocritical praise the lord i love you it's mine y'all gotta talk to me now animosity and all everything else in your heart right glory to god just get that thing right just get things right don't be a hypocrite praise the lord y'all got quiet but that's in the in the message he said brother i'm excited he said our thoughts right different but out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh right amen he said you shouldn't do that that's hypocritical i wrote you tell me uh uh uh uh you don't like me or something then to be a hypocrite with me amen right glory to god cause we can work on that part maybe maybe it's just the devil come on because i you know i'm i try not to be an offensive person right i try not to you know i try to be good sometimes i might say things silly acting up or something but i don't if i can help it i ain't trying to hurt nobody cause i don't want to be hurt i don't want people coming up saying all kind of foolishness to me right because i first off might get in my feelings i i may not say something to you but i might have a struggle right but but he brother branham is trying to get us to see something bring us to a place and he says now he says when jesus no wonder when he come off the hill that night he looked around that the tree for food there was no was no that's 175 there was no food on the tree he said no no man eat it from thee and he went on the way and the next day coming back the tree withered see watch this god's mind like this mine right the mind that in the beginning that was a thought before it was a word that expressed jesus christ watch this and the same one was expressing the word back again that's why the tree withered away he says and every word in the bible is god's thought that's why we got to study to show ourself approve god starts laying in seed form this this just gets rich that if that if received into the human being and spoke by the same thought that manifested the bible that's deep church because people ain't talking like that we just trying to put it on on the preacher no uh-uh yeah that's not what he's talking about we talking about a bride it's a bride thing right christ in bright form by the same thought that materialized the bible brings the thing to pass right and that thought was pure that's why things came to pass the way that it did see when it's not right and you express it forget about it forget about it right amen he says spoken by the same thought materialize the bible brings the thing to pass see what i mean how powerful could the church be think about it the bible said let this mind uh that was in christ being you as a man think it's in his heart so is he watch this now your thoughts what's our thoughts right if they become expression see what's our thoughts this morning i'm just read this and i'm gonna go what what's our thoughts right our thoughts has got to be be right right they got to be positive come on church they got to be positive because we're talking about god fell behind skin the word made flesh if it's the word made flesh then it can't be all this animosity and hatred and this and that and this and that and backbiting and evil surmising and all this kind of stuff right these things weaken the church right glory to god but when the thoughts of god is coming through his church right that's positive amen right this positive this pure that's that's honorable oh my my my my my my he said what uh uh um he says your guiding a a direct place or a direct inspiration of the holy spirit that's moving your more to be he says oh my he says what kind of people should we be that's verse 81 what kind of people should we be if the very holy spirit have us so embodied or empowered that you don't even use your own thoughts you don't use your own mind you don't use your own opinions and we're very opinionated but it's mad they should have said this brothers probably should have did this i don't even know why he got that on opinionated it ain't out of your business i did this for me right i just used that it don't even bother me okay but but he's bringing us a point right if if the holy spirit have a soul embody or empower that you don't even use your own thoughts you don't even use your own mind you don't need to use your own opinions but the holy spirit has you so built until your thoughts and your being is is god's spirit not yours expressing itself through you what kind of church would we be every now and then i come back to this message and i'll be like lord where am i come on because because he asked the question him brother branham looking at this scripture and looking at the church and in his understanding right if we are born again we're children of god god have a soul in body and it's just the direct inspiration of god flowing through the church man let me tell you something it wouldn't be a devil that peop they would they wouldn't even try to come through the door huh the devil would now let's go to these guys right over here and over here they be like fellas don't go in there don't go in there you have to beg for your life whatever you do man i know i got to go but uh i just don't want to be out here in of space somewhere ah can we even just go into pigs or something huh amen amen direct inspiration so embody i i think about these things church amen amen he says 83 and and they are sons of god are led by the spirit of god then when the human element goes out and the spirit of god fills that vacancy where you and see we need to empty it out you empty yourself then then we'll be when the church in its power the resurrection of the lord jesus will walk in his steps in in his power in his thoughts in his being in in his moving you see what i mean then your thoughts will become words and your words will become material that's when the church is in his power see right now god can't hardly trust us we got he got to be so embodied in us right we're moving by the spirit huh we're moving by the spirit of god we've emptied out our self opinions and this and that and i realize you know what i ain't got will you see something you ain't got no opinion on that mind your business come on we so opinionated we got an opinion that ain't your business what do you think ain't got no thought hey god no why why why would you say that because you

request here detroit like right like you got to write it down because i'm still learning the protocol you should have been doing that yeah i know but i you know he put that up from brother solomon the next day i could feel the difference from the prayer see the bible is still real the prayers of the righteous you know what i one day this weekend i'm gonna shut my mouth i was telling the lord you

i ain't got nothing to hold on to i ain't set myself up for retirement i ain't worrying about retiring when i get to that point god'll have it all worked out huh come on church come on we sit round word man we serve a big guard i've heard brother jack say this asks for big things same faith same faith hey man i don't know about y'all i'm operating i'm living in in in and faith you know i can't figure a whole lot of things out but i ain't sitting around trying i'm just this this this you know what this is the season is just i'm just walking into everything that god has in store for me [Applause] and don't nobody get to hatin ain't no sense in hating you just keep walking too we'll all just walk right into what god has for us if god got new cars and houses and clothes and money you just won't ain't listen we ain't got to be jealous of one another for what my man god bless him with a car i ain't no that was his new vehicle won't he do it won't to do it hey many many many men god has smiled on me he has set me free smiled on me he's been good to me [Music] smile on me he had set me free [Music] amazing grace amazing grace how sweet the sound of joy the shade the rich [Music] i once was lost amen amen [Music] i see [Music] amazing grace a sweet son that saved [Music] i once was lost i was blind [Music] god has [Music] oh yes he has [Music] god has he's been mighty good to me amen you love the lord this morning [Music] i really appreciate brother willie you know a lot of times you he you don't really know what you're when you're up here you know i struggle with that myself and uh i go to the past and i'll be laying it on him man i should have said this i should have said that oh that didn't come out the way i wanted it to and then i dump it on my wife when i get home and pastor say that's the devil trying to get you in your thoughts instead of you just yielding and saying his thoughts because see you don't know what the people need so you're saying things under inspiration but you're on the back of your mind you said i should have said this i should have said that no just let go let god [Music] let him say what he wanted to say but see flesh always try to come up so i should have said oh that would have been so much better no god said guess what he wanted to say that's what he wanted to say and you know i'm you know these fellows veterans i i'd be up here just like god i i i go home and i toss and turn stomach stomach being knots for three four days nothing to play with man you know why because you're speaking to the bride of jesus christ see when it started out he thought who are you you have to understand who before you can have victory i understand who you are see that was the problem with w with the children of israel when they they didn't understand who they were they came back speaking the devil's thoughts what god thought oh they're too big because see the devil's whole plan is to be worshipped as god man see and we're a small group and there's a lot of big churches they're big a lot of money and a lot of influence god is with us we are more than able amen why because we understand who we are we understand who we are willing made a point and he was saying how uh he he said [Music] we have to understand how to master the circumstance jesus he was able to master every circumstance that we come up against a lot of circumstances in our christian journey and sometimes we we we our first thought oh cattley just died but we have to be able to settle down and pray stay in the channel of god master the circumstance because he's the only master he made another point that that really that really stood out to me he was talking about being at the wrong place at the wrong time he went down to that corner and god hadn't took him from the corner and gave him uh uh uh started beginning to change his thoughts and his mind because see his he he grew up from the things he saw we we all we all do we get our understanding from from our habitat the things around us and we just sort of develop see but we have to be re-transformed see he was going down now in the wrong place at the wrong time i'm going to share a quick testimonial ain't going i gotta preach about i i want to judge somebody it was real powerful i had a friend of mine when i was in high school i used to we used to sit get to class early before class i would open up my bible and share scripture with him [Music] i was middle not middle school i was a junior by the junior house 11th grade 10th 11th grade he's called me preacher boy in the hood you know i came from guys running around slugging dope people without watching and i know i wasn't no gangster because boy i cried a minute the police get on my tail boy i'm like i'm one time i got in trouble they came and put them cuffs on me the police had to pull me to the side saying listen young man you need to wipe your nose a quick crowd you can't go in this jail cell with lucky that snot running blah blah [Music] they happen to be having a meeting brother robledo will preach it i went up and got saved i realized the streets ain't for me i ain't no thug i ain't no gangster no i don't want to go to jail but you know what redemption is in two parts she said we we we have to change our thought process my thought process had to change see the devils was telling me i was this but i was never there [Music] but my thought process had to change i'm feeling offered to drop it on you know i had to come out of prison [Music] to go to prison did you get what i said i had i had to come out of prison i was in jail i was imprisoned in a prison of sin and debauchery he delivered me out of prison then i had to get my mind renewed to become a prisoner of christ so i had to come out of prison and then choose to go into another prison see we just which prison you gonna be in all of us in prison just who the warden are you there by choice [Music] i choose to be a prisoner of christ see and then we treat we we our thoughts are not our thoughts that the his thoughts [Music] see i had to walk out i had to walk out on the double now let me let me you this testimony this young man i was witnessing to i talked to him all the time he began to get saved [Music] i'ma just use his first name raj roger roger would come come to school all of a sudden roger told me bob but he's voice louder than mine man [Music] roger made one mistake he couldn't quit hanging on the corner hanging out there up on blue hair right there at at the buster store right there imperial and got shot got shot got killed in the wrong place at the wrong time see so what i'm what i'm going to drop now today you're in the right place at the right time god has smiled on you because you made a choice to be in the right place at the right time [Music] to show you the way out of prison our redemption is in two parts you come out of prison and there's one provided way to go into prison you in the right place at the right time now don't leave the right place at the right time to go to the wrong place at the wrong time and you know what the double tricky it may not be a club it may not be the corner it could be a touch church nice heaven what do you mean man make it out from these churches and everything but remember the devil's desire is to be worshiped like the most high you know when those fellows went over there and came back with the wrong testimony had the devil thoughts they were religious that was church they were preaching the wrong thing right they were preaching they had a wrong doctrine they were religious they looked good dressed good spoke well but the devil's thoughts he he's sneaking [Music] this is why willie was saying how it had to come from a pure place it has to come from a pure place from the mind of god see he was preparing a perfect place for adam and eve so from his mind he did all of this through this those six days of creation and all of a sudden it went off [Music] the devil came with his own thought and began to take it in a whole different direction see it would be so close out of the sea to very lit if it was possible but the lord have you at the right place at the right time [Music] open your heart see he started out talking about the eyes of our understanding [Music] see so that we can be changed from glory to glory understanding who we are let me tell you something well i'm a good christian or just a good christian we're good christians we are we good christians but if until you understand really in my revelation of who you really are you can never walk in complete victory you never walk in i'm my last one he he he brought out the thing about my wife yeah i had to go get him i had to go get him why god gave it to me i knew that by revelation and god confirmed it [Music] maybe i shared that testimony sometime you know a little later but god confirmed it you know i don't care how big he would i'll look for him i prayed god told me yeah i know it gave me strength to move mountains [Music] you know i just believed and god just kind of came in and just worked a miracle he just did the work but listen that what he went to we talking about a husband and wife relationship that was yours it was a shotgun he had that she had to we were in a shotgun with go to you know go not married to the wrong but he changed our attitude our thought process and everything it was him coming to redeem us so that we can make ourselves ready for a wedding [Music] see so that we can be married to the word of god mrs jesus christ and that's where we're at in this house he was talking about that he made a statement about sometimes it all depends on what vehicle what vehicle you you you he made that statement he said uh uh uh where is that i wrote it down here uh the vehicle that bring you into into a certain place so you can you can never the horse and buggy not gonna get you where you're trying to go even the automobile won't get you where you're trying to go [Music] the airplane won't take you out the atmosphere but see we're in a time now where we have to have a we we in the rocket we got to leave the gravitational pull of the world we gotta get into a ship that's got enough power to take us beyond the gravitational pull of the world [Music] there's no more desire for the world we're only going up into another atmosphere another stratosphere where we can't even this becomes that the things of this world become so small and insignificant where we just look to the glory and the majesty of almighty god that's where we're going we're no we're not we're not we're not creatures of this world we're not creatures of time we're creatures of eternity how big is that eternity big word huge eternity creatures of eternity i appreciate brother willie give him the lord a praise offer i really do appreciate you for getting yourself out of the way and for god giving you that that that message i believe somebody was blessed somebody was truly blessed if you don't take nothing you're in the right place at the right time [Music] not the wrong place at the wrong time you you coming to a service like this you're going to leave change everybody is going to leave here changed either for the better or for the worse nobody no one's neutral no one's neutral you're either going to leave this place better or you're going to leave a little bit more worse than often when you came because you're rejecting the word of god listen to what the spirit is saying you know sometimes we can hear things with our natural ears listen with your heart you have to listen with your heart if you love him and you want more him and your desire is him let me tell you what will it say that that that that that struck and then i'll care i'll put it in my pocket he said it's all about the baptism of the holy ghost without the baptism of the holy ghost you'll never get it you'll never understand it because he has to take control of your thoughts and your being let's pray [Music] most gracious heavenly father lord we thank you this morning [Music] lord for your your grace and your mercy [Music] lord god you you you didn't let us down
