[58:25] amen
[58:26] therefore
[58:28] whosoever heareth
[58:31] these sayings of mine and do it to them
[58:35] I will liken him
[58:37] unto a wise man
[58:40] which built his house upon a rock
[58:46] and the Reigns descended and the floods
[58:49] came
[58:50] and the winds blew
[58:52] and beat upon the house
[58:54] and it fell not
[58:58] for it was founded upon a rock
[59:01] and everyone that hears these things of
[59:04] mine
[59:05] and doeth them not
[59:07] shall be locking unto a foolish man
[59:10] which built his house
[59:12] upon sin
[59:15] may the Lord add a blessing to the
[59:16] reading of his words you may be seated
[59:20] amen
[59:27] this morning
[59:32] amen I like to
[59:35] take a
[59:37] Texas morning
[59:41] on preparation
[59:45] preparation
[59:47] and I'm taking this
[59:49] started out here I'm going to read a
[59:52] little bit and go straight to a quote
[59:53] from the prophet on the oncoming storm
[59:56] and I thought it was just real
[59:59] timely on sister Melissa song
[1:00:03] that she sang this morning
[1:00:05] amen and being the
[1:00:09] the way the Lord was leading me on this
[1:00:10] morning
[1:00:11] on this message
[1:00:14] us being here from Florida
[1:00:17] we know about making preparation
[1:00:20] and uh
[1:00:23] this message was inspired by a
[1:00:25] conversation
[1:00:27] that I was having at some point with a
[1:00:29] young lady and she was having
[1:00:31] some difficulty on
[1:00:33] housing
[1:00:35] you know and that's that's that's going
[1:00:37] going on a lot right now with
[1:00:40] home prices going up the way they have
[1:00:43] been in rent
[1:00:44] skyrocketing and things like that
[1:00:47] there's more homeless people now than
[1:00:49] there ever been
[1:00:51] and uh
[1:00:54] so
[1:00:56] we see things are
[1:00:58] things are tightening up
[1:01:00] things are tightening up for everybody
[1:01:04] but we have to make preparation
[1:01:08] I was speaking with her and
[1:01:12] just out of inspiration it just hit me
[1:01:15] and I told her told her that I say
[1:01:20] well you you failed to make the proper
[1:01:23] preparations
[1:01:26] to maintain an Earthly home
[1:01:29] say but don't make that same mistake on
[1:01:32] your heavenly home
[1:01:35] don't fail to make the proper
[1:01:38] preparation
[1:01:40] see God has already provided everything
[1:01:43] you need
[1:01:45] he provided
[1:01:47] the land
[1:01:48] he's giving it to you as an inheritance
[1:01:52] he provided the material
[1:01:54] he provided everything you need
[1:01:58] he said I go to prepare a place for you
[1:02:01] that where I am you may be also
[1:02:04] he said your body I have prepared for
[1:02:06] you I said don't fail
[1:02:08] to make the proper preparation
[1:02:12] for that
[1:02:14] Eternal home
[1:02:15] that's more important than anything
[1:02:18] you're talking about an Earthly home and
[1:02:21] things of that nature that's important
[1:02:23] on this side but these things will fade
[1:02:25] away these things have passed away it's
[1:02:27] important that you don't fail
[1:02:30] to prepare for that Heavenly home
[1:02:34] I want to read a little
[1:02:36] um a little bit here from the oncoming
[1:02:38] storm
[1:02:41] message was
[1:02:43] preached uh
[1:02:46] let's see here
[1:02:49] 1960.
[1:02:51] February 29th
[1:02:55] the oncoming storm
[1:02:58] and it might be a little bit lengthy to
[1:03:00] start out here but but it is I want you
[1:03:02] to get a lot of what he's saying here
[1:03:05] amen it's important to prepare
[1:03:09] we live here in Florida and we go
[1:03:11] through hurricane seasons
[1:03:13] and uh and and it's important to make
[1:03:16] preparation
[1:03:18] go out and uh and and get my tarps and
[1:03:21] different things like that and make sure
[1:03:24] I have enough water in the house before
[1:03:27] the storm hit I make sure I have all of
[1:03:30] the things that we might need just in
[1:03:32] case something happened we out of power
[1:03:34] I remember uh one storm there we were
[1:03:37] out of power for almost a month
[1:03:39] and uh we had generators all of us
[1:03:42] huddled up in one room I had to go run
[1:03:44] the FPL man down and gave him a 50 tip
[1:03:47] to come turn my power back on
[1:03:51] he came too and he came and turned it on
[1:03:53] I said that's what it takes
[1:03:55] but you have to make preparation
[1:03:58] because if you fail to make preparation
[1:04:00] for these kind of things then what
[1:04:03] happened is two things
[1:04:06] you end up depending on someone else
[1:04:09] to risk their life to come and rescue
[1:04:12] you
[1:04:15] because of your lack of preparation
[1:04:19] and you not only put you in danger but
[1:04:21] you put other folks in danger
[1:04:24] your loved ones and those other people
[1:04:26] and it's hard for people sometimes to
[1:04:28] just tell you no but I got just enough
[1:04:30] for for me my family here I mean why
[1:04:34] didn't you make preparation
[1:04:36] you know
[1:04:37] and I would hate to come to the end of
[1:04:40] the road in this life and you failed to
[1:04:44] make preparation
[1:04:46] and and and and and and and and and and
[1:04:47] things just go sideways on you
[1:04:51] so don't fail to make preparation
[1:04:54] starting here from 40 it says
[1:04:56] uh let's see here
[1:04:59] on coming store middle or add a blessing
[1:05:01] start from paragraph 40 sister may the
[1:05:04] Lord add a blessing
[1:05:08] now to the reading of his word
[1:05:11] he says I wish to speak a few moments
[1:05:15] upon the subject of the oncoming storm
[1:05:19] I trust to God
[1:05:21] that we will be able to yield ourselves
[1:05:24] to the Holy Spirit
[1:05:26] for anyone knows that I am not a
[1:05:29] preacher
[1:05:31] that's there is preachers behind me here
[1:05:34] I never got an education to be a
[1:05:37] minister
[1:05:39] but in my old slow ways
[1:05:43] but the lord gave me something else to
[1:05:45] do
[1:05:46] but I love to take a time so I can
[1:05:50] explain what I know about the Lord
[1:05:54] about his goodness and try to tell
[1:05:57] others about it and now we're speaking
[1:06:00] tonight on the oncoming storm
[1:06:02] and if I fail in words to express what I
[1:06:07] feel in my heart I pray that the holy
[1:06:08] spirit will reveal it
[1:06:11] Jesus was speaking here on the oncoming
[1:06:13] storm
[1:06:15] which has got to strike every man every
[1:06:20] woman that's born in the world
[1:06:24] every man and every woman that's born in
[1:06:27] the world
[1:06:29] there is just no way out of it the storm
[1:06:32] will strike you sometime
[1:06:35] or another
[1:06:38] and depends on what kind of foundation
[1:06:41] that you have whether your house
[1:06:45] will weather it or not
[1:06:49] there has been many lives saved
[1:06:52] because of preparation for storms and
[1:06:56] there has been many of lives lost
[1:06:59] because of failure to take heed to the
[1:07:02] warning of the storm that's coming
[1:07:07] he says not long ago
[1:07:12] not long ago I was told of a story that
[1:07:16] happened I believe I read the newspapers
[1:07:18] down in Florida
[1:07:20] they have many storms that sweeps
[1:07:22] through Florida typhoons coming up
[1:07:24] they're coming off the sea and bring
[1:07:26] water for city blocks
[1:07:28] up to the city and it sweeps out
[1:07:30] everything but I'm told that their
[1:07:32] weather profits are always on the
[1:07:34] lookout for such storms and some way
[1:07:37] through the elements they can contact
[1:07:40] and change contact the changing of the
[1:07:43] weather and the atmosphere that which a
[1:07:47] way this weather is gathering that will
[1:07:50] bring forth one of these storms
[1:07:54] because they made it a life study by
[1:07:58] certain instruments and Sciences have
[1:08:02] provided them uh and then by calling
[1:08:05] ahead and hearing of which a way the
[1:08:08] storm is coming how much wind it's got
[1:08:12] behind them and uh which way other
[1:08:15] storms are coming them winds whether it
[1:08:18] be to combat to shove shove the storm
[1:08:21] away
[1:08:23] I could stop here and preach on that
[1:08:28] that it takes a greater storm
[1:08:31] that's coming it takes a higher win to
[1:08:35] turn that storm
[1:08:39] it takes a higher win to turn that storm
[1:08:44] so sometime there's storms a man that
[1:08:47] may be coming in our lives
[1:08:51] but it takes a higher win to push that
[1:08:55] storm away
[1:08:57] they talk about now we talk about the El
[1:09:00] Nino and the uh what's that other thing
[1:09:03] they got now that that that changes the
[1:09:05] the weather and sometimes they work in
[1:09:07] our favor here in Florida and it pushes
[1:09:10] the storms away
[1:09:12] many times we've been threatened by
[1:09:14] storms and something happened that just
[1:09:16] a high come in and a stronger wind
[1:09:19] pushes the storms away
[1:09:23] and I listen at what the prophet said
[1:09:25] and all we know that we have got an
[1:09:29] oncoming storm
[1:09:31] and the only wind that I know that can
[1:09:35] turn the storm now he's talking about
[1:09:37] the storm in your life
[1:09:39] will be the rushing wind that fell at
[1:09:43] the day of Pentecost
[1:09:45] I'm told that there is men even in the
[1:09:49] city now speaking against communism they
[1:09:51] should be
[1:09:52] but just speaking against it is not
[1:09:54] enough
[1:09:56] we've got to find how to turn that thing
[1:10:01] and then there is only one thing that
[1:10:04] can turn that storm
[1:10:06] that's a more powerful storm that can be
[1:10:10] said it and change its course
[1:10:15] amen
[1:10:16] so when we we slow down just a little
[1:10:19] bit here we the prophet said that we
[1:10:22] know storms are going to come
[1:10:25] and a little bit long a little bit
[1:10:26] further down I I'll show you how how the
[1:10:29] Lord uses these things
[1:10:32] he uses troubles in our lives Amen to
[1:10:36] push us in the direction he wants us to
[1:10:38] go
[1:10:40] amen we have many examples in the Bible
[1:10:43] how God has used storms amen and when
[1:10:48] you see a storm it usually represents
[1:10:51] trouble
[1:10:53] trouble in your life things that you
[1:10:56] have to go through and sometimes we
[1:10:58] don't understand it but we have to trust
[1:11:01] in the Lord
[1:11:03] Lord why is this happening to me
[1:11:06] well well maybe you didn't prepare
[1:11:10] maybe your preparation was just a little
[1:11:12] bit off
[1:11:14] but that's okay all it takes is a
[1:11:17] stronger win
[1:11:18] Amen to derail the storms in your life
[1:11:24] amen
[1:11:25] we know that there is a wind that comes
[1:11:28] amen and see God is the master of the
[1:11:32] Wind
[1:11:34] he stood on the bow of the boat and he
[1:11:36] spoke to the wind and he said peace be
[1:11:39] still
[1:11:41] so it's in God's permissive will
[1:11:44] sometimes that the storms come
[1:11:47] Amen to push us where he wants us to be
[1:11:52] amen
[1:11:54] now let's continue on here
[1:11:59] Prophet says I was reading
[1:12:02] I forget just now I believe it was in
[1:12:05] the newspaper of a storm a few years ago
[1:12:10] that was on its way across central
[1:12:13] Florida
[1:12:14] and all the regions around Okeechobee
[1:12:17] was warned
[1:12:19] and I just left there about five weeks
[1:12:22] ago
[1:12:22] and there was a neighbor man who kept
[1:12:26] contact
[1:12:27] with radio all the time because these
[1:12:31] storms and he was a very renowned
[1:12:34] Christian I want you to pay attention to
[1:12:36] that now
[1:12:37] he was a Christian man
[1:12:40] and he heard that the great typhoon was
[1:12:42] coming
[1:12:43] that way twisting down the trees and
[1:12:46] everyone was warned to get to safety
[1:12:55] jumping around on me again
[1:12:57] and the people was warned to get the
[1:12:59] safety
[1:13:02] and he thought of his neighbor
[1:13:06] who had a chicken farm
[1:13:08] and some light buildings
[1:13:10] where their chickens in them were
[1:13:13] broader houses
[1:13:15] and so forth and their pins were all
[1:13:20] that they had in life
[1:13:22] was tied up with these chickens and
[1:13:26] they're living
[1:13:28] and he rushed quickly in front
[1:13:30] frantically up to the gate and stopped
[1:13:34] his car and he jumped out and said to
[1:13:36] this fellow take all the chickens and
[1:13:39] put them
[1:13:40] in your storm shelter
[1:13:42] and you rush over to mine because there
[1:13:47] is a coming a typhoon or a storm that's
[1:13:51] going to twist everything down
[1:13:55] and the man stood
[1:13:57] and looked at him
[1:13:59] the face and laughed at him
[1:14:02] and said nonsense
[1:14:04] I've heard them predict such things
[1:14:07] before
[1:14:09] and it never happened
[1:14:12] and the Christian neighbor was so
[1:14:14] excited he said but what if it does
[1:14:17] happen
[1:14:19] see we've been told for years
[1:14:22] that Christ is coming soon
[1:14:25] we've heard it I've heard it all my life
[1:14:30] that Jesus is coming soon
[1:14:33] but I'm here to tell you this morning
[1:14:35] Jesus is coming soon amen
[1:14:39] amen it's sooner than it was now than it
[1:14:43] was then
[1:14:46] amen
[1:14:47] every time uh
[1:14:50] brother Mike just had to bury a nephew
[1:14:54] was it
[1:14:55] my wife
[1:14:57] co-worker
[1:14:59] just lost
[1:15:01] a brother
[1:15:03] one week and in the very next week lost
[1:15:06] a sister
[1:15:09] death is all around us
[1:15:12] it's by the grace of God
[1:15:15] that we have an opportunity
[1:15:19] that we have an opportunity one more day
[1:15:23] Lord
[1:15:24] to make preparation
[1:15:29] you ought to be thankful this morning
[1:15:32] but one day
[1:15:35] the storm is going to be upon you
[1:15:39] have you made preparation
[1:15:43] we hear remarks like that all along the
[1:15:47] line
[1:15:48] have heard of these going this is going
[1:15:51] to happen
[1:15:54] and things to happen can you get me a
[1:15:56] water please brother
[1:15:59] and they're going to happen but
[1:16:02] it is going to happen one of these days
[1:16:05] and it behooves us to listen
[1:16:09] to the warning
[1:16:11] this man said I have no time for such
[1:16:14] foolishness
[1:16:15] I raise chickens and I have no such time
[1:16:18] for that
[1:16:19] and he cried out the neighbor said in
[1:16:22] the name of God
[1:16:24] he said leave those chickens alone
[1:16:29] then John and come quickly
[1:16:32] you and your family
[1:16:34] if you don't
[1:16:37] want to believe it let your family come
[1:16:41] the man wouldn't let his family come
[1:16:45] the man was giving him a warning this
[1:16:48] Christian man
[1:16:50] say that the storm is coming
[1:16:55] he refused to make any preparation
[1:17:00] it's about like us today
[1:17:06] we've had
[1:17:07] five-fold Ministry
[1:17:10] a Prophet come and tell us that the
[1:17:12] storm is coming
[1:17:15] and some people fail to make preparation
[1:17:19] still fail to make cause they don't
[1:17:21] believe it
[1:17:23] you can't believe it if you're not
[1:17:25] making preparation
[1:17:28] because if you believe that you'd be
[1:17:30] making preparation
[1:17:35] he will definitely deliver you from the
[1:17:37] storm
[1:17:38] he's provided a way of Escape
[1:17:43] we see now that Florida
[1:17:47] when a storm is coming and it's a bad
[1:17:50] one Dale's reroute all of the southbound
[1:17:53] traffic
[1:17:54] and everything going one way
[1:17:58] they made a way of Escape
[1:18:02] but because of the arrogance
[1:18:06] of men
[1:18:08] they ignore the warnings
[1:18:11] that we're going to ride it out
[1:18:16] we gonna ride it out we gonna take our
[1:18:18] chances
[1:18:19] don't take chances with this
[1:18:25] there's a storm coming
[1:18:28] and it behooves you
[1:18:30] to make sure you're ready
[1:18:33] and prepare
[1:18:36] for the storm
[1:18:39] he says
[1:18:44] amen you can't stop this storm from
[1:18:46] coming
[1:18:48] he said the man wouldn't even let his
[1:18:51] family
[1:18:53] come
[1:18:54] and he said I will not have my children
[1:18:58] to be excited over a few radio warnings
[1:19:02] I would not have my children be excited
[1:19:06] over some man preaching
[1:19:10] standing up and
[1:19:12] at The Forum
[1:19:13] screaming at the people
[1:19:16] tried to warn him who is he
[1:19:19] what makes him
[1:19:21] know everything
[1:19:24] this was a man telling them the storm
[1:19:26] coming
[1:19:29] I'll not have him be excited over a few
[1:19:31] radio warnings
[1:19:32] my children and I decided we'll live as
[1:19:36] I live
[1:19:41] and my wife would listen to me because I
[1:19:43] am the breadwinner
[1:19:45] of this home and she must listen to me
[1:19:49] I'm the boss here
[1:19:51] and I'll not have my children all
[1:19:53] excited and tore up about some nonsense
[1:19:59] and the neighbor was turned and he went
[1:20:01] to his home into his shelter
[1:20:06] all of a sudden
[1:20:09] the clouds was upon him
[1:20:14] before
[1:20:16] they even knew it
[1:20:18] not
[1:20:20] we are here
[1:20:22] in Florida
[1:20:24] he's talking about the 1928 storm
[1:20:27] many of you that lived here for a while
[1:20:29] know that there's a grave right over
[1:20:32] there across the street from Brother
[1:20:33] Westco Church where all of those people
[1:20:35] this person probably made over there
[1:20:39] because all those people that they
[1:20:41] couldn't that just died they went and
[1:20:42] scooped up bodies and they didn't have
[1:20:43] enough they couldn't bury him now called
[1:20:45] the water table was so high so they
[1:20:46] brought them over here to West Palm
[1:20:47] Beach and there's a mass grave
[1:20:51] right here
[1:20:54] in West Palm Beach
[1:20:57] and we've had a profit
[1:20:59] and this day that came here

[1:26:01] this thing is this thing is over with
[1:26:07] how can you raise the children like that
[1:26:12] got folks teaming up fighting
[1:26:16] for
[1:26:18] crazy rights
[1:26:20] it's over
[1:26:22] says as it was in the days of so shall
[1:26:26] it be in the coming of the son of man
[1:26:28] that's a warning and we ignore it
[1:26:31] we see all of the side everything is
[1:26:34] there
[1:26:38] but we fail to go to the grocery store
[1:26:41] and make preparations
[1:26:47] we fail to make sure that our shutters
[1:26:51] are up and they're tight
[1:26:55] we have to make sure that we have
[1:26:58] everything we need
[1:27:00] to weather the storm
[1:27:12] the scripture said
[1:27:14] in Matthew
[1:27:16] whosoever Hearth my sayings
[1:27:19] endorse them I would liken them to a
[1:27:22] wise man which builds his house upon a
[1:27:25] rock
[1:27:27] and Reigns this sin and floods came and
[1:27:31] the winds blew and beat upon the house
[1:27:32] and it fell not
[1:27:35] for it was founded on a rock
[1:27:38] it was founded on a rock that rock is
[1:27:41] Jesus
[1:27:44] it had your anchor has to hold
[1:27:48] and grips a rock
[1:27:52] now if you fail everyone that hears
[1:27:55] these sayings
[1:27:56] of mine and doeth them not
[1:28:00] shall be likened until a foolish man
[1:28:02] would build his house
[1:28:04] upon saying
[1:28:08] your house must be built upon the
[1:28:11] revelation
[1:28:12] of who he is
[1:28:15] your house must be built upon a
[1:28:18] revelation of Who You Are
[1:28:22] who he is to you
[1:28:27] and who you are to him
[1:28:31] amen
[1:28:33] it must be built upon the true word of
[1:28:36] this hour
[1:28:37] other than that nothing else to hold the
[1:28:41] winds and the and the storm is going to
[1:28:42] come your house going to be floating
[1:28:43] down the river
[1:28:45] because it's no stabilizer
[1:28:49] it's built upon shifting Sands
[1:28:53] dogmas and Creeds
[1:28:55] but we've had a prophet he came right
[1:28:58] here
[1:28:59] he's talking about right here
[1:29:03] see back then this was all swampland
[1:29:06] let me give you a little history
[1:29:09] this was all swamp
[1:29:11] the water came up the hill this led all
[1:29:14] the city was back there
[1:29:17] anything Western military was swamp
[1:29:23] this school is built on Swamp it ain't
[1:29:26] even steady
[1:29:29] news flash
[1:29:31] the ground the very ground we have in
[1:29:34] church on right now
[1:29:36] build upon swamp land
[1:29:40] and you think the storm ain't gonna come
[1:29:44] Prophet said it's common
[1:29:49] now I hope you can see the types I'm
[1:29:52] talking about a natural storm but I'm
[1:29:54] trying to type it with a spiritual storm
[1:29:56] that's coming
[1:29:59] and you've heard all your life
[1:30:01] get ready
[1:30:03] he's coming one of these days
[1:30:06] he's coming soon
[1:30:09] but we're closer now
[1:30:11] yeah then we wear it in
[1:30:13] and you still ain't getting ready
[1:30:16] you still fail to get ready
[1:30:24] so
[1:30:31] demand here all of a sudden the clouds
[1:30:33] was upon him before he knew it
[1:30:36] that's the way judgment strikes
[1:30:39] it comes so sudden
[1:30:41] you wonder how can their how can it be
[1:30:45] here so quick
[1:30:48] how I have seen cruel men
[1:30:52] who once cursed God
[1:30:54] and fall and scream and say how could
[1:30:57] you treat me this way
[1:31:01] the whole Foundation was swept out from
[1:31:05] under him
[1:31:07] in a moment
[1:31:09] it pays to take warning
[1:31:13] he says oh you might laugh at the
[1:31:15] messenger
[1:31:16] you might be able to even Kill the
[1:31:18] Messenger
[1:31:19] but you cannot kill the message
[1:31:23] it'll go on just the same God's message
[1:31:26] is eternal his word never fails
[1:31:34] amen
[1:31:36] I want to go on down to 59.
[1:31:39] he says here
[1:31:43] while the storm swept through the
[1:31:45] country
[1:31:46] it caught the chicken house and the
[1:31:48] farmer
[1:31:49] and they never found his body
[1:31:53] like I say it might be right over here
[1:31:57] and his wife frantically fighting
[1:32:01] and they lived close to the great
[1:32:04] Okeechobee Lake
[1:32:06] and the water began to rise as a typhoon
[1:32:08] lifted the waters all the way
[1:32:12] from the bottom of the lake
[1:32:15] he says that's what makes it so
[1:32:16] dangerous because the lake is shallow
[1:32:19] and the boats Rock and how the waves
[1:32:22] just come and turn the boats beneath
[1:32:24] them
[1:32:25] the storm comes and just whirls up
[1:32:29] the water and pack it for miles
[1:32:32] and the water is sweeping
[1:32:36] until the mother knows there was no hope
[1:32:39] but to get her children on top of the
[1:32:42] building
[1:32:44] and she got her children
[1:32:46] and got them on top of the building
[1:32:48] this old they're hanging on to this old
[1:32:51] chimney house
[1:32:55] and then the wildlife
[1:32:58] the cottonmouth moccasins
[1:33:01] he says I believe more deadly than your
[1:33:04] diamond bike rattlesnakes
[1:33:07] they were crawling for safety
[1:33:10] and they come on the roof with her
[1:33:14] and by listening to her husband and not
[1:33:17] taking heed to the warnings she had to
[1:33:20] stop
[1:33:22] and she beat but she had to stand and
[1:33:25] watch
[1:33:27] those vicious snakes bite her children
[1:33:30] until they died on that roof
[1:33:33] and the mother herself Was Bitten so
[1:33:36] much
[1:33:37] until she finally died he said that's
[1:33:40] the only way we got the story
[1:33:43] After the Storm had quieted and the
[1:33:45] search parties hunting for bodies and so
[1:33:48] forth they found her laying on top of
[1:33:51] the roof with her children laying by her
[1:33:53] side
[1:33:56] oh it pays to take warnings the first
[1:34:01] thing to do before there can be any
[1:34:04] warning
[1:34:06] there has to be preparation
[1:34:12] we must fail not we must not fail
[1:34:16] to prepare for this oncoming storm
[1:34:23] amen
[1:34:24] I want to shift a little bit
[1:34:27] God is always preparing us
[1:34:32] you see because he he works on both ends
[1:34:34] of the spectrum
[1:34:37] he's preparing a way of Escape
[1:34:42] for us we look back at Moses there and
[1:34:46] the children of Israel coming out of
[1:34:48] Egypt he made a way
[1:34:50] through the Red Sea
[1:34:52] he provided the way he prepared the way
[1:34:56] for them to go
[1:34:57] but first before he had to do that he
[1:35:00] had to prepare a prophet
[1:35:04] he had this he took Moses it took him 40
[1:35:07] years
[1:35:09] to take all of the things that he had
[1:35:11] learned that he was preparing him
[1:35:15] for the great task at hand
[1:35:18] Amen to lead them that the way that he
[1:35:22] prepared
[1:35:23] see God prepared the way but he needed a
[1:35:25] prophet to lead the people
[1:35:28] but he had to prepare the profit
[1:35:34] amen
[1:35:36] so the people had to recognize
[1:35:40] that this was the prepared man
[1:35:44] and once they recognized
[1:35:47] that they spare
[1:35:48] has forgot the preparation God has
[1:35:52] prepared him
[1:35:53] to lead us to Freedom
[1:35:57] then they had to get prepared themselves
[1:36:01] amen
[1:36:02] it was Moses that dealt with pharaoh
[1:36:07] he said let my people go
[1:36:10] and these different things happen we
[1:36:11] know the story
[1:36:13] but at the end he thought the People Get
[1:36:16] Ready
[1:36:18] grab everything that's your own
[1:36:22] get your children ready
[1:36:24] we fitting to go
[1:36:26] we finna leave Asia
[1:36:31] now I was up to them see that's three
[1:36:34] preparations God prepared to wait
[1:36:37] Danny prepared a leader
[1:36:39] then he prepared the people had to get
[1:36:42] ready
[1:36:43] to follow the leader
[1:36:48] amen
[1:36:50] so here we have
[1:36:58] amen
[1:37:00] we have here five ways
[1:37:05] amen
[1:37:06] that God uses our problems
[1:37:10] in our lives to prepare us
[1:37:15] God uses problems
[1:37:18] a man to direct us
[1:37:22] he also
[1:37:24] uses our problems
[1:37:27] to inspect us
[1:37:31] he also uses problems
[1:37:36] amen
[1:37:41] I'ma get to it in a minute
[1:37:49] he also uses our problems Amen to
[1:37:53] perfect us
[1:37:56] so he uses problems to direct us
[1:38:00] he uses problems to inspect us
[1:38:03] he loses problems to direct us
[1:38:08] I say correct us correct us
[1:38:11] he uses problems to perfect us
[1:38:20] inspect us
[1:38:22] amen that's four
[1:38:26] he uses problems
[1:38:29] to direct us
[1:38:31] amen that's fine
[1:38:34] okay
[1:38:36] so it says here we'll look at the first
[1:38:39] one he uses problems to direct us
[1:38:42] amen we see
[1:38:44] and in Psalms 37 24
[1:38:49] the steps of a good man
[1:38:51] are ordered
[1:38:54] by the Lord
[1:38:55] and he delighteth in his way
[1:38:58] though he fall
[1:39:01] he shall not be utterly cast down
[1:39:04] for the Lord upholdeth him
[1:39:08] with his hand
[1:39:10] who is wise
[1:39:12] so sometimes we see that
[1:39:15] God must light a fire under us
[1:39:19] to get us to move
[1:39:21] problems often motivate us to change
[1:39:26] problems often uh uh uh often get us
[1:39:31] amen get our attention
[1:39:35] God is sometimes just trying to get your
[1:39:37] attention
[1:39:39] sometimes it takes a painful situation
[1:39:42] to make us change our ways
[1:39:45] to make us change our thinking
[1:39:49] speaking on the young lady that didn't
[1:39:51] have any way to live
[1:39:52] she's thinking a little bit different
[1:39:54] now

[1:40:06] preparation

[1:40:12] come and bail you out
[1:40:15] I'm hitting you I wish there was
[1:40:18] something I can do
[1:40:20] but see when you sometimes
[1:40:23] when you get to a point where you have
[1:40:25] been warned
[1:40:27] when you have been warned and you fail
[1:40:29] to met preparation and you have ignored
[1:40:32] the warning

[1:41:47] of all to have it's going to be a more
[1:41:50] Dreadful day

[1:44:41] now you can really hurt something
[1:44:46] you know why because you get that you
[1:44:49] think you'd undone something
[1:44:51] you get the smell in yourself
[1:44:54] I can put a quote together
[1:44:57] I I I I I can do this and I can do that
[1:45:01] and you fail to set up under some
[1:45:03] experience
[1:45:07] until you get out of order
[1:45:09] but I said I had this one guy in
[1:45:12] particular
[1:45:13] guy named Bucky
[1:45:15] was the he was if the prophet talked
[1:45:18] about that what's the man know with the
[1:45:20] beady eyes and the real mean fella

[1:45:29] that man was so ornery
[1:45:32] drank a thermos of coffee in the morning
[1:45:35] and smoked cigarettes Just Smokes that
[1:45:38] but he was a I still to this they say
[1:45:41] the best electrician I ever worked with
[1:45:42] that man was good
[1:45:44] but I followed behind him like a little
[1:45:46] pup
[1:45:47] and he would challenge me and he knew
[1:45:49] how to get me to work he intentionally
[1:45:51] made me mad
[1:45:54] he'll make me mad that man knew how to
[1:45:56] get up under my skin and the matter I
[1:45:59] got he he realized he'll get me mad and

[1:46:11] you a word like a boy you work like a
[1:46:14] machine when you get mad
[1:46:16] but one day we I and he knew I was a
[1:46:19] Christian because I would I would I
[1:46:20] would get to the job site and doing
[1:46:22] lunch everybody be sitting over there
[1:46:23] talking I'll be in the corner reading my
[1:46:25] Bible
[1:46:25] and he said he wanted them fine
[1:46:27] Brimstone preachers not a young guy
[1:46:31] I see Willie that's what you call it
[1:46:33] and so I even got him even more
[1:46:36] and so we got into it
[1:46:39] he got on me just got under my skin he
[1:46:41] had me dig a ditch
[1:46:43] he had me dig the ditch
[1:46:46] about a 40-yard ditch
[1:46:49] not the other thing I came back over and
[1:46:51] I told him I'm done he said not cover it
[1:46:53] up
[1:46:54] I said cover it up he said I was just
[1:46:56] playing we needed over here I said why
[1:46:57] you play you play like that man
[1:47:05] he walk away laughing that's how he was
[1:47:08] he walk away laughing
[1:47:10] so I finally got to him and I he said
[1:47:13] he was messing with me he said what you
[1:47:15] want to be you want to be an electrician
[1:47:17] I said imma be whatever God want me to
[1:47:19] be and we ended up going back and forth
[1:47:22] and back and forth and we yelling and
[1:47:24] fussing at each other he said that's it
[1:47:26] get in the truck I'm taking you back to
[1:47:29] the shop I see that's fine with me let's
[1:47:31] go cause you are unable to work with
[1:47:33] anybody
[1:47:34] and we got in the truck and we drove all
[1:47:37] the way back to the shop
[1:47:38] and he looked at me last said you ready
[1:47:40] to go to work now
[1:47:45] I said why'd you be playing with me man
[1:47:47] my emotions all worked up
[1:47:51] and the last thing
[1:47:53] I ever worked with him we was working at
[1:47:55] a place called an Eye Brand Farms
[1:47:58] and we was actually racing
[1:48:01] he had one bait that he had to wire and
[1:48:03] I had the other bit that I had to work
[1:48:05] and I wanted to beat him so bad
[1:48:08] and I didn't know that he was going on
[1:48:10] vacation that day
[1:48:11] and I was working working up and down
[1:48:14] the ladder working pulling wired and
[1:48:16] doing everything and I finally finished
[1:48:18] and I seen the getting ready to leave
[1:48:20] another gentleman had came to take his
[1:48:22] place
[1:48:23] and I seen him pulling off and I jumped
[1:48:25] off the ladder and I ran down the road I
[1:48:28] say I'm finished and I beat you and I
[1:48:31] see him at the river mirror waving and
[1:48:33] laughing and that was the last time I
[1:48:35] see him he died the next week
[1:48:38] he was cutting his grass up until he had
[1:48:40] a property in Tennessee that he was
[1:48:42] leaving to go to and it was on a hill
[1:48:44] and he cutting the grass on the hill and
[1:48:46] had a heart attack and died
[1:48:49] that was the last time I ever seen her
[1:48:51] but he taught me a lot
[1:48:54] he taught me a lot
[1:48:56] he made me a good electrician
[1:48:59] but you know
[1:49:02] my point in all of that was saying that
[1:49:04] a lot of times we think we know
[1:49:06] something
[1:49:08] and we fail
[1:49:10] to just wait
[1:49:12] we fail to just be even if you know you
[1:49:16] know what when I was when I was when I
[1:49:17] was an apprentice even if I knew I was
[1:49:20] right
[1:49:21] I wouldn't say nothing
[1:49:23] out of respect for my job even if I knew
[1:49:25] I was right
[1:49:26] I know I'm right
[1:49:28] ain't gonna never disrespect him
[1:49:31] I'm not going to jump in the man move
[1:49:33] you don't know what you're doing and
[1:49:34] argue with him and this with him this
[1:49:36] man taught me what I know that is
[1:49:39] even if I knew I was right
[1:49:41] ain't gonna say nothing
[1:49:43] and he could never jump in no ditch
[1:49:45] around me
[1:49:47] it's ironic now that I'm working at the
[1:49:48] airport we did a lot of work around the
[1:49:50] airport
[1:49:51] and uh he'll be in there he wasn't
[1:49:53] afraid of that shovel he'll get in that
[1:49:54] ditch with that shovel and dig that
[1:49:56] dictionary thing I would jump in the
[1:49:57] ditch and take the shovel from myself no
[1:49:59] journeyman of mine never gonna be
[1:50:00] digging and I'm standing up on the bank
[1:50:03] got in there got with it
[1:50:05] ain't gonna happen
[1:50:08] and that's what we're losing with these
[1:50:10] youngsters today
[1:50:14] they're losing their place
[1:50:16] but this is our future
[1:50:19] this is our future
[1:50:25] the warning signs all around us
[1:50:29] we have to be ready
[1:50:32] so we see that we have a a he uses
[1:50:37] problems
[1:50:38] to get us ready
[1:50:40] to direct us we see amen uh um Jonah
[1:50:45] Jonah was commissioned by God
[1:50:49] amen
[1:50:50] to go
[1:50:52] Amen to Nineveh
[1:50:54] but I want you to look here
[1:50:57] In Jonah the fourth chapter
[1:50:59] says but it just please Jonah
[1:51:02] exceedingly and he was very angry
[1:51:05] and he prayed unto the Lord and said
[1:51:07] pray thee O Lord
[1:51:10] was not this my saying when I was yet in
[1:51:14] my country therefore I fled
[1:51:17] before unto tarnish tarshish
[1:51:21] for I knew that thou art a gracious God
[1:51:25] and merciful slow to anger
[1:51:28] and of great kindness
[1:51:31] and repentance thee of the evil
[1:51:33] therefore now O Lord take I beseech thee
[1:51:38] my life from me for it is better for me
[1:51:41] to die
[1:51:43] than to live then the Lord said then
[1:51:47] said the Lord do us thou well to be
[1:51:51] angry so Jonah went out of the city and
[1:51:54] sat on the east side of the city
[1:51:57] and there made him a booth and sat under
[1:52:01] it in the shadow till he might see what
[1:52:05] would become of the city
[1:52:09] and the Lord God prepared a Gore
[1:52:12] and made it to come up over Jonah
[1:52:16] that it might Shadow over his head
[1:52:20] to deliver him from his grief
[1:52:23] the Lord prepared a gourd
[1:52:26] to Shadow him
[1:52:28] Amen to deliver him from his grief but
[1:52:32] God prepared a worm
[1:52:36] when the morning Rose the next day
[1:52:39] and it smoked the gourd that it withered
[1:52:43] and it came to pass when the sun did
[1:52:46] rise that God prepared a vehement East
[1:52:51] Wind
[1:52:52] the Sun Beat upon the head of Jonah and
[1:52:56] he fainted and wished himself to die and
[1:53:00] said it is better for me to die than to
[1:53:03] live God said to Jonah do us thou well
[1:53:06] to be angry for the God and he said I do
[1:53:11] well to be angry even unto death then
[1:53:14] said the Lord thou Hast pity upon the
[1:53:17] God for which thou has not labored
[1:53:21] neither made it grow which came up in a
[1:53:25] night and perished in a night and should
[1:53:28] not I spare Nineveh that great City
[1:53:32] wherein more than uh six four thousand
[1:53:36] persons that cannot discern between
[1:53:38] right hand from their left hand and also
[1:53:42] much cattle
[1:53:45] he didn't want to go to Nineveh
[1:53:48] but God had to prepare a prophet
[1:53:52] had to prepare him
[1:53:54] so he prepared earlier he prepared a
[1:53:57] great fish
[1:54:00] then he prepared the guard
[1:54:03] then he prepared the worm
[1:54:06] all to prepare Jonah
[1:54:09] so he going through all of this to
[1:54:11] prepare profit to go to a people that
[1:54:13] don't know that don't know nothing don't
[1:54:16] know they left hand from their right
[1:54:18] hand but God was thinking about Nineveh
[1:54:22] why because she knew that they had a
[1:54:25] repentant heart
[1:54:29] so he went through all of that to
[1:54:31] prepare the prophet
[1:54:33] prepared to fish
[1:54:35] prepared the guard
[1:54:37] prepared the worm
[1:54:39] just to prepare him
[1:54:41] to save a people
[1:54:46] God prepared all he did all my God
[1:54:50] to get them ready
[1:54:52] he did the same thing for us my brothers
[1:54:54] and sisters God also uses problems to
[1:54:57] inspect us
[1:54:59] Prophet said at one point he said people
[1:55:00] are like tea bags if you want to know
[1:55:03] what's inside of them just drop them in
[1:55:04] hot water
[1:55:07] and see what come out
[1:55:09] see sometimes God drops us in hot water
[1:55:12] why just to see what's going to come out
[1:55:14] of us
[1:55:18] you know
[1:55:23] the prophet said God allows things to
[1:55:26] come up in church
[1:55:29] let me find that quote
[1:55:32] he allows things
[1:55:36] possession negated me anyway
[1:55:38] he said was only a few years later when
[1:55:41] the Trials come in the church got All
[1:55:43] Shook Up
[1:55:45] as it is so easy for a Congregation of
[1:55:47] people to do
[1:55:49] when something just don't seem to happen
[1:55:52] the way it's supposed to be
[1:55:54] God makes it that way God brings tension
[1:55:59] into the church
[1:56:01] every son that cometh to God must be
[1:56:03] tried proven tested
[1:56:07] he lets sickness strike you he lets
[1:56:10] disease come upon you God now
[1:56:13] allows these things
[1:56:15] to prove you
[1:56:18] to show the world that you're truly a
[1:56:20] Seed of Abraham
[1:56:22] he permits it by his own will
[1:56:26] he permits disaster
[1:56:28] he permits the friends to turn against
[1:56:31] you
[1:56:32] he permits all these things and turns
[1:56:36] the devil loose to tempt you
[1:56:39] he'll do all of that but take your life
[1:56:43] but could throw you on a bed of
[1:56:45] Affliction he could turn your neighbors
[1:56:48] against you he could turn to church
[1:56:50] against you he can do most anything
[1:56:55] and it's God's will for him to do it
[1:56:58] we are taught that it's more precious
[1:57:01] than gold
[1:57:02] but what is he doing he's permitting
[1:57:04] these things for a purpose
[1:57:07] see I thought it was just ironic you
[1:57:10] know and just wonderful how brother
[1:57:11] smiling a couple weeks ago was talking
[1:57:13] about how the diamond must be cut
[1:57:17] Amen to show forth that light that's the
[1:57:20] cutting of the diamond
[1:57:23] so be not dismayed rejoicing your trials
[1:57:27] rejoice in the problems
[1:57:30] a lot of people are afraid to preach
[1:57:32] those kind of messages and things but I
[1:57:34] want to be ready
[1:57:36] he uses these problems and different
[1:57:39] things now if you go through the travel
[1:57:41] right way
[1:57:43] it's going to build character
[1:57:46] it's going to be a character in you
[1:57:49] he wants to be proud of you and say look
[1:57:52] at my son look at my daughter
[1:57:55] they're not potted plants they're solid
[1:57:58] they're not going anywhere he would
[1:58:01] allow problems to come up in the hole
[1:58:04] he would allow problems to come up at
[1:58:06] work just to see how you're going to
[1:58:08] handle it
[1:58:11] sometimes we get to a place where just I
[1:58:14] quit
[1:58:17] quit
[1:58:19] no you need to go back to the altar you
[1:58:21] ain't ready yet
[1:58:22] you need some more preparing to do
[1:58:25] you need to get to the preparation house
[1:58:28] you need to be beat on some more
[1:58:31] and beat on some more why because she
[1:58:34] wants you to be rugged
[1:58:36] he wants you to be prepared because
[1:58:38] there's a storm coming
[1:58:40] and it ain't gonna be nothing nice
[1:58:43] you know even the people that's prepared
[1:58:45] have to go through some things in the
[1:58:47] storm
[1:58:48] you put the shutters on you got all of
[1:58:50] the stuff prepared you got your
[1:58:52] generator gas and all of that kind of
[1:58:53] stuff and you're sitting in the house

[1:59:04] drinking and carrying on you end up
[1:59:07] praying Lord let this storm pass Us by
[1:59:10] so just because you prepared don't mean
[1:59:12] you're not gonna go through something
[1:59:15] amen but you are prepared to go through
[1:59:17] it
[1:59:18] and he's preparing us to go through the
[1:59:20] storm that's coming
[1:59:23] amen there is a squeeze going on
[1:59:26] hey man it's only going to squeeze us
[1:59:28] right on up out of here
[1:59:30] amen but we're going to stand the test
[1:59:33] amen we're going to stand the pressure
[1:59:35] amen they're going to come forth it's
[1:59:37] pure gold
[1:59:39] amen but we must
[1:59:41] make preparation
[1:59:43] we must be prepared
[1:59:47] amen
[1:59:48] I have another quote here this message
[1:59:51] called inspiration
[1:59:53] and uh
[1:59:56] here we noticed the shooter might woman
[1:59:59] paragraph 39
[2:00:03] inspiration
[2:00:05] and I'll read this it says notice how
[2:00:08] and this shoot of my woman
[2:00:11] she said to her husband
[2:00:13] you know there's a holy man that comes
[2:00:15] to see us
[2:00:17] and let us pray thee bill just a little
[2:00:19] chamber on the side of the house for him
[2:00:22] in other words
[2:00:23] we want to be just as close to him when
[2:00:27] he's in the neighborhood as we can be
[2:00:31] we know he's a Jew we're Gentiles but
[2:00:35] yet he's a holy man
[2:00:37] and we recognize him to be that way
[2:00:40] we believe he's a truthful man
[2:00:42] and so we got enough money to do that so
[2:00:46] let us build us a chamber on the side of
[2:00:49] the house
[2:00:51] and put a stool in there and a little
[2:00:54] bed in there that when he come some
[2:00:57] water in the picture and so forth he can
[2:00:59] refresh herself and lie down and stretch
[2:01:02] out uh how God foreknows all things and
[2:01:06] making preparation
[2:01:09] you see they were making preparation put
[2:01:12] this on this lady's heart
[2:01:14] amen that was God making preparation for
[2:01:17] the man of God there
[2:01:18] God knows all things he's omnipotent
[2:01:21] he's omnipresent he's I'm omniscient he
[2:01:26] knows all things the he knows all things
[2:01:31] when the world better forever was a star
[2:01:35] in heaven before there ever was a light
[2:01:39] in the firmament God knew every Prophet
[2:01:41] ever lived on in everything that men and
[2:01:46] women would ever do
[2:01:49] he's infinite and how that he wants his
[2:01:54] people to get things ready
[2:01:57] like in the Antelope and destruction
[2:01:59] he's getting people ready today like he
[2:02:03] got that woman ready watch
[2:02:05] what that little bit did later
[2:02:12] notice she built the bed because she was
[2:02:16] inspired
[2:02:17] to do so
[2:02:19] and when God gives you a revelation to
[2:02:23] do something and if it's the right thing
[2:02:26] for whatever you do do it don't wait
[2:02:29] till tomorrow
[2:02:31] do it when God says do it she was able
[2:02:34] to do it now the first thing you just
[2:02:37] don't want to be a fanatic but it's but
[2:02:40] if it's according to the word do it if
[2:02:44] God is speaking to you now
[2:02:46] or will tonight or tomorrow or any time
[2:02:50] in your life
[2:02:51] you know you have to live where you
[2:02:54] should live you know you have to be how
[2:02:57] you you know you're you're professing
[2:02:59] something that you really don't possess
[2:03:02] in your soul
[2:03:04] and you're not hiding it from God and
[2:03:07] you should be right you should live in a
[2:03:10] place with God where every day the sun
[2:03:12] is shining then go down to God and ask
[2:03:16] God to give you that and God will do it
[2:03:20] for its inspiration leading you that way
[2:03:24] because that would be the will of God so
[2:03:28] we see we have trouble
[2:03:30] God is trying to get us ready
[2:03:34] and he says when when when when you hear
[2:03:37] it when you hear the word of God
[2:03:39] like this shooter Mike woman
[2:03:41] she was pre she had an inspiration
[2:03:45] to do something
[2:03:47] he says when you feel that way and that
[2:03:49] Revelation do it quickly
[2:03:51] or the devil will come and talk you
[2:03:53] right out of it
[2:03:55] when you're sitting in the church and
[2:03:56] you hit a man of God and that thing hits
[2:03:58] your soul
[2:03:59] and you've got that inspiration do it
[2:04:02] quickly
[2:04:03] don't wait
[2:04:05] because the devil will come and take it
[2:04:07] right out
[2:04:08] he'll begin to speak mind battles into
[2:04:10] your ear
[2:04:11] he'll begin to lean on you just a little
[2:04:13] bit
[2:04:14] by the time you leave if you don't if
[2:04:16] you don't move quickly
[2:04:18] he'll take that desire he'll take that
[2:04:21] thirst because God is going to come and
[2:04:23] he'll that nudge that seed a little bit
[2:04:26] move quickly
[2:04:27] move right away
[2:04:29] yield to him
[2:04:31] surrender to his will if you wait the
[2:04:35] devil will come and take it out
[2:04:38] I see it so many times
[2:04:40] the atmosphere is just right sit there
[2:04:43] and I know God is speaking to an
[2:04:45] individual
[2:04:46] no God is just tugging on them and you
[2:04:49] quench it and hold on and allow the
[2:04:53] devil to take your place
[2:04:55] move quickly
[2:04:56] God is preparing you
[2:04:58] he's nudging you in that direction you
[2:05:01] know you got problems in your life he
[2:05:03] uses the problem no doubt because of the
[2:05:05] problems you're here today
[2:05:08] no doubt because of the problems things
[2:05:11] you could I thought I got nowhere to
[2:05:13] turn
[2:05:15] ain't got nowhere else to go
[2:05:19] Lord if you don't help me I won't be
[2:05:21] helped
[2:05:24] he uses those problems to drive you
[2:05:26] where he wants you to be
[2:05:28] he's making he's preparing you
[2:05:31] but you got to prepare
[2:05:34] you got to be willing to make
[2:05:36] preparation
[2:05:37] he's done everything that he said he
[2:05:39] would do
[2:05:40] he's made everything he's laid
[2:05:42] everything out for you he's provided the
[2:05:45] way of Escape he's provided all of the
[2:05:48] materials he provided the prophet to
[2:05:50] Legion he provided the pastor to see you
[2:05:53] through you know the prophet said the
[2:05:55] church don't make you a Christian
[2:05:58] just don't make you a Christian but
[2:06:01] what it does do is help you maintain
[2:06:03] your Christianity
[2:06:09] ain't nowhere in the world you gotta
[2:06:11] tell your heart you'll come and you say
[2:06:13] Lord take my life I want to be a
[2:06:15] Christian but if you don't never follow
[2:06:17] up
[2:06:18] you don't never come to church you'll be
[2:06:20] a Christian for a good hot week
[2:06:23] you can't maintain it that way
[2:06:26] every time the daughter of the church is
[2:06:28] open I want to be there
[2:06:29] cause I done been out there in them
[2:06:31] streets
[2:06:32] and it ain't nothing nice
[2:06:35] ain't nothing out there for you but
[2:06:37] death to spell
[2:06:39] another thing he uses problems for is to
[2:06:42] correct you
[2:06:44] now he done gave you away he'd done all
[2:06:46] of these things when you get out there
[2:06:48] on your own and then problems here
[2:06:50] ain't nobody's fault but yours
[2:06:53] because you fail to make preparation
[2:06:57] you find yourself on the bottom skin
[2:06:59] real how do I get here

[2:08:04] you better yield to his will
[2:08:07] you better yield to his way
