[46:13] uh brother wesko and we were there at
[46:16] the time
[46:17] and i remember the first time she came
[46:20] we wondered how did she get there
[46:24] and she called a taxicab
[46:28] she thought that she called the taxi cab
[46:30] to every service
[46:32] and all and uh all i could say was that
[46:35] sister wiz was a beautiful beautiful
[46:37] christian
[46:38] lady
[46:39] you know and um when we moved from here
[46:43] in 1986 we moved to okeechobee

[46:49] and uh she was working for
[46:51] the family
[46:53] of the pulitzer family

[49:25] he told me he said
[49:26] you know jeep go through the water so so
[49:29] i got a chance to take out to the
[49:31] hunting camp
[49:33] and we got out to the hunting camp i
[49:34] didn't say nothing to her at first just
[49:36] got down so when we got done camp uh we
[49:39] rode around
[49:40] and uh because the
[49:42] the the camp
[49:44] the only cameras in this
[49:46] humongous is
[49:49] 10 miles
[49:50] square 10 miles
[49:53] and so i told the sister way said we're
[49:54] going to go over certain places but we
[49:57] got to go through a little water you
[49:58] know and she kind of tightened up you
[50:01] know
[50:03] and i said but don't worry i see you're
[50:05] making so we're in the jeep and i took
[50:07] us which got to the flat to go through
[50:11] and uh it was about i guess maybe about
[50:14] a couple of about 200 feet that we had
[50:16] to go through water and the water's
[50:17] about
[50:18] uh almost like two foot high
[50:22] and so i told they said are we going to
[50:23] go through we're going to ease through
[50:24] here you know i said but you probably
[50:27] have to hold your feet up because you
[50:29] won't get wet you know
[50:30] so we got her through them we got come
[50:33] back through that and that was the
[50:35] greatest thing that ever happened to her
[50:38] she said oh my she said when i get home
[50:40] i'm going to write my brother
[50:42] and tell him i said yeah that's possible
[50:44] because i i've done it i've been in the
[50:46] shelter
[50:47] and that's
[50:48] that was the highlight of her whole
[50:51] career out there
[50:53] but anyway sister waiting was a
[50:55] beautiful person
[50:56] and i'll say this and i'm gonna get out
[50:58] of your way uh i i know i know that the
[51:02] the devil glad to see her go
[51:08] the devil was glad to see sister west go
[51:11] because she was a thorn in his side
[51:18] everything he tried to give her she she
[51:20] rejected anything that didn't look like
[51:23] the words she didn't have nothing to do
[51:24] with it
[51:25] you know so she
[51:27] she
[51:28] oh my god
[51:30] she had a fight all right she had a
[51:32] fight she had a fiber sheet she stood
[51:35] the grounds with the devil
[51:36] you know so i'm i'm happy to to have
[51:39] known her
[51:40] and to be with her for the years that we
[51:43] had together and everything you know
[51:45] i'll just say this
[51:47] uh
[51:49] she's in a greater place
[51:52] a place that
[51:53] there's never
[51:55] a sad goodbye and has never uh
[51:58] it's great you know so but uh
[52:01] one thing she
[52:03] didn't let the devil do
[52:05] he couldn't he couldn't
[52:08] convince her to live
[52:10] like the world
[52:12] he couldn't convince her to talk like
[52:14] the world talk
[52:15] he couldn't vince
[52:17] to live like the world
[52:19] he couldn't convince her to dress like
[52:21] the world right so when she left the
[52:24] deputy paul i'm so glad she gone
[52:27] so let us be praying for one another to
[52:29] pray but i'm gonna leave you with this
[52:31] though every every one of us in here has
[52:34] a chance
[52:35] to see her again
[52:38] but now let us not miss that
[52:41] chase amen praise god
[52:46] [Applause]
[52:51] [Music]
[52:54] appreciate uh brother and sister capers
[52:57] at this time we'll also have
[52:59] as a sister in christ also friend
[53:02] sister teresa brown she's going to come
[53:04] and have words
[53:21] wow
[53:26] i considered
[53:28] barrel eureka
[53:30] wayson
[53:33] it was an honor to be called her friend
[53:37] beryl
[53:38] was very firm in what she believed
[53:43] and
[53:44] she definitely was a master of
[53:46] clearliness
[53:48] um through the years i've been knowing
[53:51] beryl about maybe about 35 years
[53:55] and basically
[53:57] i mean we have
[53:59] spent a lot of time together
[54:02] whether it be say on the road going back
[54:06] and forth to church
[54:08] um back and forth to work to the mall
[54:12] um even
[54:14] say traveling together
[54:17] we traveled a lot
[54:19] and
[54:20] barrel
[54:23] was she taught me quite a bit
[54:26] um my children was very fond of her she
[54:29] was like a grandmother slash godmother
[54:32] to them
[54:33] um
[54:35] bell really liked fine things
[54:39] and
[54:40] i could appreciate that
[54:43] beryl i tell you i've tasted some of the
[54:46] finest of cheeses from merrell
[54:49] and she
[54:50] where others would maybe go to the deli
[54:52] she go to the gourmet cheese section
[54:56] and cheese and crackers pickles just
[54:59] different things of that sort daryl
[55:02] i tell you
[55:04] a real soldier of the cross
[55:07] um
[55:08] i really enjoyed her sense of humor she
[55:11] had a great sense of humor and i loved
[55:13] to hear a laugh
[55:16] uh but most of all beryl
[55:18] beryl really was a prayer warrior
[55:21] i'ma tell you you to get i really
[55:25] enjoyed hearing her pray
[55:28] it
[55:29] was so consistent it felt she was a
[55:32] consistent person anyway
[55:35] and uh she was a dedicated person to
[55:38] whatever she believed
[55:41] her prayers just flowed
[55:44] but most of all beryl loved the family
[55:47] of god
[55:49] um
[55:50] she asked a lot of questions we would
[55:52] tease her
[55:53] i mean why is this what is that where
[55:55] where are you going how did you get
[55:57] there how did they do this but it wasn't
[55:59] to be nosy it was so that she can
[56:02] basically
[56:04] get an understanding of how to pray
[56:07] and um it just
[56:10] this is really tough
[56:14] because oh
[56:17] she's just really someone special in my
[56:19] life
[56:20] really special and it's such an honor to
[56:24] me to be able to speak as a friend
[56:27] and a sister
[56:29] [Music]
[56:31] as a church member
[56:33] someone that have been with her through
[56:36] a lot
[56:37] i mean
[56:38] all of my ups and downs over and unders
[56:41] whatever barrel has been right there for
[56:43] me and with me
[56:46] uh she was an encourager to
[56:48] everybody i mean if she talked to you
[56:51] she encouraged you
[56:53] when you left her presence
[56:55] you felt like you can you know do what
[56:58] maybe you thought you couldn't do but
[57:00] she really wasn't encouraging
[57:02] and i like to say this uh truly your
[57:05] life was a blessing
[57:07] your memory or treasure
[57:10] you are love beyond words
[57:13] and you are sure enough
[57:15] miss beyond measure
[57:18] i love you so much feral
[57:20] i have a um tribute that i was asked to
[57:23] read
[57:24] from her auntie ruth
[57:27] she's in trinidad she's her
[57:31] mother's sister and she sent this and
[57:34] it was too late to get into the book but
[57:36] i told her i would read it
[57:39] i remember in 2001
[57:42] when i spent six months in florida at
[57:44] barrels
[57:45] she was very accommodating generous and
[57:49] kind
[57:50] she took me around
[57:52] showed me places shops stores and most
[57:55] definitely church
[57:58] she without fail would take me to church
[58:01] every sunday morning
[58:03] and thursday evening
[58:05] she was not much for talking at home
[58:08] but was a peaceful pleasure to be around
[58:13] she would listen to brother branham
[58:15] tapes and enjoy every minute of them
[58:19] and the
[58:20] revelations barrel was a stickler for
[58:23] the truth
[58:25] even if it was from her own point of
[58:28] view
[58:30] and in all
[58:31] the name of god
[58:33] she was a true christian
[58:35] and although she might may not
[58:38] have say been ready for this
[58:42] a very painful event for us
[58:45] she was well prepared
[58:48] for she lived a good christian life
[58:51] she would make me chuckle whenever we
[58:54] chatted on the phone
[58:56] she always said auntie ruth
[58:59] it's good to hear your voice
[59:01] now that she is gone i can truly say
[59:06] beryl
[59:07] i would surely miss your voice
[59:11] i treasure the memories my dear barrel
[59:14] rest in peace and god's power your
[59:17] loving auntie ruth
[59:22] i love you bill

[1:00:59] and she always spoke fondly
[1:01:02] of her church sisters

[1:01:05] and that is something that i was very
[1:01:07] impressed with
[1:01:09] and i always make an effort when i come

[1:01:48] brother justin smiley will have a solo
[1:01:49] from sister ashley williams
[1:01:55] good afternoon
[1:01:58] if i could just share really briefly as
[1:02:00] i pulled this up a couple years ago
[1:02:03] at an event much like this i saw sister
[1:02:05] wayson
[1:02:06] and i hadn't seen her
[1:02:08] in a little while
[1:02:10] and uh the first thing she did she
[1:02:11] looked me you know when she when she
[1:02:12] hadn't seen you know why she kind of
[1:02:14] gave that little look she kind of
[1:02:16] squinched up her eyes a little bit she
[1:02:17] looked at me she didn't say hello
[1:02:19] she didn't say good to see you first
[1:02:20] thing out of her mouth was
[1:02:23] brother you need to buy a bigger suit
[1:02:34] i just said how you doing sister weisse
[1:02:36] [Laughter]
[1:02:40] i found out that she could be
[1:02:43] very very sharp but she was she was very
[1:02:46] funny
[1:02:47] uh so we we appreciate sister wayson i
[1:02:50] did end up getting a bigger suit
[1:02:54] this letter reads as follows it's titled
[1:02:57] our tribute to beryl
[1:02:59] it says beryl wayson was born the fourth
[1:03:01] of 13 children to cecil and euleen
[1:03:03] wayson may 20th 1948
[1:03:07] in trinidad west indies
[1:03:10] being one of the older girls she was
[1:03:11] tasked with assisting her younger
[1:03:13] siblings i rupert the 12th child was
[1:03:17] truly impacted by the actions of my
[1:03:20] older sister
[1:03:22] beryl's sense of order and hard work was
[1:03:24] seen early on with the effort she showed
[1:03:27] in getting us younger ones ready for
[1:03:29] church or school
[1:03:30] she insisted on cleanliness and neatness
[1:03:33] i believe her love of children and their
[1:03:36] development sprang from the soil of a
[1:03:38] large family
[1:03:40] hair must be properly combed
[1:03:43] teeth brushed closed neatly ironed she
[1:03:46] did the ironing
[1:03:48] shoes cleaned
[1:03:49] barrel worked hard at helping our
[1:03:51] parents take care of their large family
[1:03:55] in my early pre-teen years beryl
[1:03:57] migrated to the u.s during the late 70s
[1:04:00] she worked as a nanny for several
[1:04:02] families before ending her work career
[1:04:05] at a local nursing home
[1:04:07] working for her was not just a job but a
[1:04:10] calling a call to serve
[1:04:12] to give to heal
[1:04:15] it is this servant's heart that made
[1:04:16] beryl so special
[1:04:18] whatever the occasion or crowd beryl was
[1:04:21] most comfortable
[1:04:23] helping and ministering to those around
[1:04:25] her in the homes of the families she
[1:04:27] worked for beryl brought light and life
[1:04:31] to the surroundings
[1:04:32] she would single-handedly bring
[1:04:34] freshness
[1:04:35] into an area that once looked jaded and
[1:04:38] drab
[1:04:39] not by
[1:04:40] the purchase of something or remodeling
[1:04:43] but by her sheer presence and hard work
[1:04:46] her surroundings too on her personality
[1:04:51] of order and calm her ability to raise
[1:04:54] and nurture children was an extension of
[1:04:56] her large family upbringing
[1:04:58] tough love and gentle touch was her mo
[1:05:01] she did the work singing and playing and
[1:05:04] loving those entrusted to her care
[1:05:07] her example
[1:05:08] of joy and consistency made the little
[1:05:11] ones feel safe and loved bringing out
[1:05:13] the best in them being well behaved and
[1:05:16] clean as a child was the way to beryl's
[1:05:18] heart
[1:05:20] presents were a big deal with her the
[1:05:22] giving of gifts for no reason made us
[1:05:24] feel
[1:05:25] valued and loved
[1:05:28] one such time occurred when i was a
[1:05:29] teenager
[1:05:31] beryl visited trinidad and she brought
[1:05:32] me a pocket watch
[1:05:34] i was totally bowled over by the beauty
[1:05:37] and uniqueness of the gift no one my age
[1:05:40] owned or must have even seen such a
[1:05:42] thing her sense of style and fashion was
[1:05:45] traditional with a heavy emphasis on
[1:05:48] modesty
[1:05:49] this just added to her persona of order
[1:05:52] and calm
[1:05:54] beryl enjoyed things of quality and
[1:05:56] beauty be it clothing or decor simple
[1:05:59] but unique
[1:06:01] timelessness
[1:06:02] took precedence over the latest fad
[1:06:05] her things bore the stamp of order and
[1:06:08] taste with an enduring quality that made
[1:06:11] it appear more sophisticated than
[1:06:14] extravagant
[1:06:16] beryl's strength and fortitude was born
[1:06:18] from the source within barrel was a
[1:06:20] believer and follower of the god of the
[1:06:22] bible the maker of the heaven and the
[1:06:25] earth
[1:06:26] she surrendered her life to her savior
[1:06:28] at a young age and continued growing in
[1:06:31] his grace she was fearless and devoted
[1:06:34] in her faith
[1:06:36] undeterred by the sway of the times
[1:06:39] her heart for the lover of her soul
[1:06:41] increased as she aged
[1:06:43] the barrel of my teens has been eclipsed
[1:06:46] by the barrel of today
[1:06:48] the servant's heart she possessed
[1:06:50] through a mustard seed
[1:06:52] as though a mustard seed as a youth has
[1:06:54] grown into a mighty tree for others to
[1:06:57] find shade under its branches the idea
[1:07:00] of serving others and being a servant is
[1:07:03] not often spoken of today
[1:07:05] being known recognized and celebrated is
[1:07:08] the heights to which most aspire
[1:07:11] to be unseen by some is like a death
[1:07:14] sentence
[1:07:16] beryl took a different path
[1:07:17] the path of a servant
[1:07:19] on february 2nd 2022
[1:07:22] beryl sat at her at her table having
[1:07:24] breakfast when the cry of every
[1:07:26] servant's heart was realized she heard
[1:07:29] her master's voice saying
[1:07:31] well done thou good and faithful servant
[1:07:33] enter thou unto the joy of the lord love
[1:07:36] always
[1:07:37] rupert wayson brother
[1:07:40] [Applause]
[1:08:09] okay
[1:08:11] um
[1:08:14] man a lot can be said about system lacy
[1:08:18] two hours twice a week that's a
[1:08:21] that's a lot of time
[1:08:24] um
[1:08:26] i started to reflect this morning and
[1:08:28] just thinking
[1:08:29] when you when you grow up you don't you
[1:08:31] think the people in your life are going
[1:08:32] to be there
[1:08:33] forever
[1:08:35] and i sure didn't think uh we'll be
[1:08:37] standing here today i was telling my mom
[1:08:40] being an ignorant little girl
[1:08:43] i thought wasting was her first name for
[1:08:45] the longest time and i'm like what kind
[1:08:46] of name is wayson but okay you know this
[1:08:49] is the ways and then she finally said
[1:08:51] her name was beryl and that made it
[1:08:52] worse i was like barrel
[1:08:54] and i said b-a-r-r-e-l
[1:08:58] and she said no
[1:09:03] so i remember going home and actually
[1:09:05] looking up what barrel means and i
[1:09:07] realized it was a precious stone so i
[1:09:08] was like okay she can talk me a little
[1:09:10] something
[1:09:12] and then i looked up this morning and
[1:09:14] it's amazing how much a name can be
[1:09:17] attributed to a person
[1:09:20] when i looked it up it says beryl has
[1:09:22] been said to have the power to keep
[1:09:24] demons away
[1:09:27] to promote happiness
[1:09:29] and marital love
[1:09:31] increase sincerity cure laziness because
[1:09:34] she couldn't stand that
[1:09:36] protect travelers it's no wonder how we
[1:09:38] got home safe every time
[1:09:41] from danger and maintain youthfulness
[1:09:44] she loved children
[1:09:47] man did she love the jenkins children
[1:09:50] two out i used to get jealous like if
[1:09:52] you don't stop talking about them
[1:09:55] but those were her kids
[1:09:56] uh she was never a mother and and i
[1:09:59] always mother's day come around and we
[1:10:00] always get her something she said well
[1:10:01] i'm not a mother i said well your mother
[1:10:03] to many you mother minnie
[1:10:05] and i'm definitely going to miss her
[1:10:06] mothering she loved him
[1:10:09] so i pray that i'm able to
[1:10:11] do her justice this afternoon
[1:10:17] tis so sweet
[1:10:20] to trust in
[1:10:22] jesus
[1:10:24] [Music]
[1:10:25] just to take
[1:10:28] him at his word
[1:10:32] just to rest
[1:10:36] upon his promise
[1:10:39] and to know

[1:13:54] amen we want to ask
[1:13:57] uh brother glenn roy wasting he's going
[1:14:01] to come at this time and speak as an
[1:14:02] aunt
[1:14:03] and man god bless you
[1:14:14] [Music]
[1:14:23] i just want to first and thank everybody
[1:14:26] for coming here
[1:14:28] means a lot to me and my cousins and my
[1:14:31] family
[1:14:33] thank you for her church family thank
[1:14:35] you for her friends and family
[1:14:40] this hit hard it really was tough for
[1:14:42] the family uh most of us
[1:14:45] most of the families in trinidad so they
[1:14:46] weren't able to be here in person but
[1:14:48] they were able to be here in spirit and
[1:14:50] also through video
[1:14:53] for my cousins they remember auntie
[1:14:55] barrel as a strict art
[1:14:57] we kind of got a little bit of that
[1:14:59] sense here today but you know when
[1:15:01] you're a kid you feel everybody is
[1:15:04] strict and auntie barrel she really
[1:15:06] wanted the best for us
[1:15:07] you see time and time when
[1:15:10] you know your aunts or your uncles would
[1:15:12] just let you stare down the wrong path
[1:15:14] but that wasn't really her vision her
[1:15:16] vision was although you view me as
[1:15:18] strict when you're a child you would
[1:15:20] greatly appreciate that when you become
[1:15:22] an adult and that's so true for most of
[1:15:25] my cousins where looking back they're
[1:15:28] like yes she was strict but
[1:15:30] the success and the impact that she's
[1:15:32] played in so much of our lives
[1:15:35] it speaks uh volumes
[1:15:40] she would always be a gibbon on as well
[1:15:44] besides the life lesson she would always
[1:15:46] give us pocket change or sweeties as my
[1:15:48] cousins in trinidad would call it i was
[1:15:51] born in brooklyn new york
[1:15:53] most of my cousins
[1:15:54] are in trinidad so
[1:15:57] i would call it candy they would call it
[1:15:59] sweeties but that was always auntie
[1:16:01] barrel she will always be giving
[1:16:07] for me personally it's tough um i never
[1:16:10] envisioned myself being here under these
[1:16:12] circumstances
[1:16:14] um
[1:16:16] when i got the call from my uncle
[1:16:19] on wednesday last wednesday and he told
[1:16:21] me that she went to the hospital i'm
[1:16:24] like okay i mean auntie barrel is tough
[1:16:27] so she's definitely gonna pull through
[1:16:29] it and you know we talked about in
[1:16:32] december that i was going to come down i
[1:16:34] like currently live in new jersey
[1:16:36] and i talked to her last december and
[1:16:39] said you know what once covered and
[1:16:41] everything kind of subside
[1:16:43] i'm going to be on the first plane to
[1:16:45] come and spend time with you and
[1:16:47] whatever you want to do i was willing to
[1:16:49] do anything if she wanted to skydive
[1:16:51] that's not anti-barrel but i was
[1:16:53] definitely willing to do anything that
[1:16:55] she wanted because
[1:16:57] you know after my father passed away and
[1:17:00] when my father passed away before he
[1:17:02] passed away they had like a grand trip
[1:17:05] that
[1:17:06] she went with my father and my father
[1:17:08] was so impressed with the trip and he
[1:17:10] was so happy and i was so happy that
[1:17:12] before he passed away he was able to
[1:17:14] experience it with auntie beryl and
[1:17:17] after he passed away we became more
[1:17:19] close where
[1:17:21] you know the calls of probably talking
[1:17:23] once every three months we talked every
[1:17:26] month
[1:17:27] and
[1:17:28] the way how she would just say honey
[1:17:30] it just it's different
[1:17:32] and
[1:17:34] for me this is really tough um i had
[1:17:38] you know as a young man and still
[1:17:40] growing i thought i had so much time to
[1:17:42] just show gratitude to my aunt
[1:17:45] i really wanted to do so much for her
[1:17:47] because she's done
[1:17:49] so much in the lives of so many other
[1:17:51] so many
[1:17:55] she's done so much for so many people
[1:17:58] and i just wanted to do whatever i can
[1:18:00] it's just a way of showing her gratitude
[1:18:02] she never cared about the spotlight on
[1:18:05] her she was always
[1:18:06] asking people how they were doing and
[1:18:09] people would ask her back but she never
[1:18:11] truly wanted to focus on herself
[1:18:14] and as i become a man i i just
[1:18:17] after my father passed away i just
[1:18:20] wanted to show him gratitude and when he
[1:18:21] passed away i was going to shift that
[1:18:23] focused anti-barrel
[1:18:26] because she lives in the u.s so it
[1:18:28] become more easier versus my aunts and
[1:18:30] one uncle lives in the u.s and she just
[1:18:33] meant so much to me personally where
[1:18:36] i just wish i had more time
[1:18:43] but as we all realize she was a fair a
[1:18:46] god fair woman
[1:18:48] and although she will definitely be
[1:18:50] missed here on earth
[1:18:52] we know that she's currently rejoicing
[1:18:54] in heaven
[1:18:58] it's very hard to say that because i
[1:19:00] really wish she was here a person
[1:19:03] but i have to live with that reality
[1:19:05] that you know this is god's will be done
[1:19:08] thank you
[1:19:11] [Music]
[1:19:12] [Applause]
[1:19:17] praise the lord we certainly appreciate
[1:19:20] that from her nephew
[1:19:22] um
[1:19:23] says as a nanny
[1:19:26] brother james jenkins he's gonna come at
[1:19:28] this time praise the lord
[1:19:31] [Applause]
[1:19:42] good afternoon and it is a privilege to
[1:19:44] be here and talk a little bit about a
[1:19:47] lady that i have the utmost respect for
[1:19:50] and love
[1:19:52] brother keepers uh
[1:19:54] i'm glad you failed too because i got
[1:19:56] her behind in
[1:19:57] behind the steering wheel twice
[1:19:59] and we never got it in the
[1:20:02] drive but we tried
[1:20:07] um
[1:20:08] good afternoon a little history
[1:20:10] literally 30 years ago
[1:20:14] beryl came into our lives
[1:20:16] i had a four-year-old daughter amanda a
[1:20:19] two-year-old son colt and edward was
[1:20:23] literally born
[1:20:24] about a month before
[1:20:26] and
[1:20:27] my wife was a practicing cpa i traveled
[1:20:30] a lot for work and wanda made the
[1:20:33] decision that she wanted it both ways
[1:20:35] she wanted to be a mom and she also
[1:20:37] wanted to work
[1:20:38] and the the solution was
[1:20:40] barrel manny and i don't panically don't
[1:20:43] know how we found beryl
[1:20:45] clearly i know now that god had a hand
[1:20:47] in that
[1:20:49] but it's
[1:20:51] barrel showed up and wanda and beryl
[1:20:53] bonded very quickly both the significant
[1:20:56] women of faith
[1:21:00] what's interesting is that
[1:21:03] barrel had worked with several other
[1:21:04] families and i now know grew up in a big
[1:21:07] family
[1:21:08] and neither wanda or i did that we had
[1:21:10] very small families and even though
[1:21:13] beryl called wanda madam
[1:21:16] it was pretty clear that madam was not
[1:21:18] in control
[1:21:21] and it started it started out madam
[1:21:24] should we do this and then it became
[1:21:26] madam we will do this and uh
[1:21:30] but it was uh it brought some
[1:21:31] organization to a uh a very loose
[1:21:34] household uh cleanliness improved and uh
[1:21:38] you know for me that was on the road it
[1:21:40] worked out great
[1:21:43] in beryl we found a woman of great faith
[1:21:45] and she prayed
[1:21:47] for our family constantly
[1:21:49] she did a good job with the kids the
[1:21:52] kids loved her and she loved on the kids
[1:21:56] it uh you know
[1:21:58] she knew where how to set boundaries and
[1:22:01] needless to say what kids do they if the
[1:22:04] boundaries here they will stick their
[1:22:06] toe over that boundary and it was
[1:22:08] usually met with a stern stare
[1:22:10] barrel was
[1:22:15] and then in perfect king's english she
[1:22:18] would uh
[1:22:19] remind them what their transgression was
[1:22:21] and what
[1:22:22] and what the appropriate uh
[1:22:25] response uh should be and that was you
[1:22:27] know that was good but i asked amanda uh
[1:22:30] i was talking to her the other night
[1:22:32] said give me a great barrel story and so
[1:22:34] she recounted that when she was 12 or 13
[1:22:36] years old we were building a class float
[1:22:40] one of those things you take for the
[1:22:41] homecoming and you decorate it in our
[1:22:43] backyard and we did a lot of that kind
[1:22:45] of thing
[1:22:46] and
[1:22:47] the girls the 13 year old girls they had
[1:22:49] on these very tight very small shorts
[1:22:53] and they were contorting themselves
[1:22:56] hammering stapling painting all those
[1:22:58] things you do a float and barrel pulls
[1:23:02] her inside and says
[1:23:04] a lady keeps her legs together
[1:23:07] or crossed
[1:23:08] and doesn't wear outfits like that
[1:23:11] uh and uh amanda was a little
[1:23:14] embarrassed uh but the fact that she
[1:23:16] would remember the story today
[1:23:18] uh his evidence of beryl's impact
[1:23:23] you know looking back what a fabulous
[1:23:26] job she did with the kids she prayed for
[1:23:28] them she prayed with them she modeled
[1:23:30] how to be a christian lady
[1:23:32] somebody mentioned uh
[1:23:35] pastor
[1:23:36] that was always on the tapes
[1:23:40] she lived in our garage apartment for
[1:23:42] years and
[1:23:43] that's what was coming out of those
[1:23:45] windows whenever she was there and she
[1:23:47] was either listening to uh music uh him
[1:23:50] or she was listening to pastor brandon
[1:23:54] so any event thank you for letting me
[1:23:56] speak uh what an amazing lady
[1:23:59] what a gift to our family um i do think
[1:24:03] we had a hedge of protection around us
[1:24:04] because of her prayer and you know you
[1:24:07] know what's what's really special is
[1:24:09] that she and wanda are together in
[1:24:10] heaven now and at the feet of jesus and
[1:24:13] uh i never saw beryl dance but i hope
[1:24:16] she is
[1:24:17] thank you
[1:24:18] [Applause]
[1:24:29] what a wonderful testimony
[1:24:31] you know it's one thing when you live a
[1:24:34] certain way in church
[1:24:36] but when see people see you on the
[1:24:37] outside on your job
[1:24:40] living the same way it leaves a
[1:24:41] wonderful impression thank you so much
[1:24:43] for sharing
[1:24:44] amen
[1:24:46] brother jenkins
[1:24:47] at this time we're going to have a
[1:24:49] another tribute

[1:25:00] virginia williams
[1:25:12] god bless everybody

[1:25:16] tribute
[1:25:17] from
[1:25:19] sis wayson's nephew john it says
[1:25:21] remembering baron wayson by john edmund
[1:25:25] warren nephew
[1:25:28] pleasant good day to everyone as we
[1:25:30] gather together to celebrate the life of
[1:25:33] beryl wayson
[1:25:35] my name is john edmund
[1:25:38] warren and i am the nephew of beryl
[1:25:41] wayson
[1:25:42] she was my mother's big sister
[1:25:45] my heart's desire was to be there in
[1:25:48] person to bid my aunt a feral a final
[1:25:52] farewell but due to travel restrictions
[1:25:56] i am forced
[1:25:57] to look on back home in trinidad and
[1:26:00] tobago with the rest of the family
[1:26:03] members
[1:26:04] i was privileged to be a guest at
[1:26:07] auntie's home
[1:26:08] on two occasions
[1:26:10] my experience with her as an adult is a
[1:26:13] vast contrast to the memories i have of
[1:26:17] her as a child growing up
[1:26:19] that woman was strict yes i said that
[1:26:23] woman
[1:26:24] she was a disciplinarian
[1:26:27] though i don't think
[1:26:29] she ever physically reprimanded anyone
[1:26:32] her scolding was enough to bring fear in
[1:26:35] a child's mind
[1:26:37] she had a stern look
[1:26:40] sharp eyes and a fearless
[1:26:43] tendency
[1:26:45] for rowdy little children
[1:26:48] that woman was stripped
[1:26:51] but i remember receiving a birthday
[1:26:54] birthday cards with a little usd in it
[1:26:59] regardless of how strict
[1:27:01] who would not be happy to hear that
[1:27:04] auntie barrel was coming home
[1:27:07] we know she was come she was not coming
[1:27:09] alone
[1:27:10] her luggage would contain sweets and
[1:27:13] other goodies
[1:27:14] that were destined for our greedy
[1:27:16] bellies
[1:27:18] she walked very quickly
[1:27:21] i remember her as an older youth
[1:27:24] leaving our home walking down
[1:27:27] i'm not i'm not pronouncing this right
[1:27:28] bill
[1:27:30] bellew role in belmont
[1:27:33] she walked with authority
[1:27:35] i remember thinking to myself
[1:27:38] them americans feel like they own
[1:27:40] everything
[1:27:42] as she walked in the middle of the
[1:27:43] street as there was nothing as there was
[1:27:46] no sidewalk
[1:27:48] her steps were filled with confidence
[1:27:51] shoulders upright
[1:27:53] and a stern look
[1:27:55] she was the boss
[1:27:57] it is a vivid memory of her commanding
[1:28:00] steps
[1:28:02] i remember
[1:28:04] clear
[1:28:05] i remember the clash
[1:28:07] i remember quite clear i remember the
[1:28:10] clash of personalities as an adult
[1:28:14] i was an adult or so i thought
[1:28:17] i was quickly reminded of my place
[1:28:22] granny had just passed and she was back
[1:28:25] home
[1:28:26] it was over a book granny had said i
[1:28:28] could take
[1:28:30] she was not aware of our agreement
[1:28:33] i ended up leaving the book right there
[1:28:36] i believe the book is still on the shelf
[1:28:40] undisturbed i mentioned
[1:28:45] that i was her guest on two occasions
[1:28:47] the first time i visited with my wife
[1:28:50] stacy and it was a pleasant experience
[1:28:53] looking at her now
[1:28:55] with matured eyes she wasn't that bad at
[1:28:58] all
[1:28:59] in fact she was very loving and proud of
[1:29:02] me and the wife i had chosen
[1:29:04] within two years we were there again
[1:29:08] this time i carried my son zion
[1:29:11] she fell in love with zion
[1:29:13] the strict disciplinarian
[1:29:16] had
[1:29:17] but all vanished
[1:29:19] she was still stern
[1:29:20] but gentle at the same time
[1:29:23] we had good talks through our visits
[1:29:26] she shared her experiences we had good
[1:29:30] dialogue
[1:29:31] we were all looking forward to visiting
[1:29:34] a third time
[1:29:35] but covet
[1:29:36] 19. she had good friends in the persons
[1:29:41] of sister brown and sister virginia
[1:29:44] i know she has other good friends but
[1:29:47] these are the two that i know
[1:29:49] she spoke well of her young pastor as
[1:29:52] well
[1:29:53] she loved her church family she had many
[1:29:57] a spiritual conversation we had many a
[1:29:59] spiritual conversation
[1:30:01] this was our family upbringing
[1:30:04] to be close to the lord
[1:30:07] it is indeed sad
[1:30:09] to lose her suddenly but her memory
[1:30:12] lives on
[1:30:13] i feel robbed
[1:30:15] her stern look is replaced with a
[1:30:17] pleasant
[1:30:18] smile she had a way she used to kind of
[1:30:22] blush i would say
[1:30:24] i will remember that
[1:30:27] always
[1:30:28] virtuously dressed like her other two
[1:30:31] sisters my mother and aunt dolores
[1:30:35] never seen any of them in pants to walk
[1:30:37] the street
[1:30:38] always in a skirt
[1:30:41] we all have that hope
[1:30:43] in christ jesus to live again
[1:30:46] until that time i bid thee farewell
[1:30:56] amen certainly appreciate the tribute
[1:30:58] from her nephew
[1:31:00] john warren
[1:31:01] at this time we'll have acknowledgements
[1:31:04] i believe from the bell and clark

[1:32:13] technology can do
[1:32:15] during these days
[1:32:17] i'm reminded of the spirit of god that
[1:32:19] says
[1:32:21] that the law will never will not come
[1:32:23] back until all
[1:32:25] has heard his words
[1:32:28] so i'm
[1:32:30] often
[1:32:31] caught up
[1:32:32] as to say that god is surely soon to
[1:32:35] come
[1:32:35] because technology
[1:32:37] has a way of connecting us
[1:32:40] each and every day
[1:32:42] so if you're not ready
[1:32:44] i invite you
[1:32:46] to get ready
[1:32:49] our sister bella
[1:32:51] has done her job
[1:32:54] she's ran the race
[1:32:57] she's fought the fight
[1:32:59] but most of all
[1:33:01] she kept the faith
[1:33:03] and to that
[1:33:05] is a testimony to say
[1:33:07] god is surely
[1:33:09] a good god
[1:33:11] i say to you
[1:33:13] on behalf of the bell and clark family
[1:33:14] this family will have me to say to you

[1:34:22] each and every time
[1:34:24] that we meet

[1:34:33] and his promise is to never leave you or
[1:34:36] forsake you
[1:34:37] this word
[1:34:38] comes
[1:34:39] from the word
[1:34:41] that god says to each and every one of
[1:34:43] us
[1:34:44] i am with you wherever you may be

[1:35:06] this time to read each and every one of

[1:48:46] opening up his doors and
[1:48:48] appreciate uh
[1:48:49] brother jack
[1:48:51] i guess she got three pastors this
[1:48:54] morning
[1:48:55] up here
[1:48:56] uh brother wesko and
[1:48:59] had brother james as a pastor
[1:49:02] and then i came in i think i might have
[1:49:04] passed the longest
[1:49:06] 23 years and
[1:49:09] we transitioned and we kind of combined
[1:49:11] our churches
[1:49:12] uh with spirit and truth and so
[1:49:15] brother jack
[1:49:16] is actually a pastor but um
[1:49:19] i would have felt good if he went on and
[1:49:21] took it this morning
[1:49:23] but uh i was supposed to be in arizona
[1:49:26] this weekend uh preaching out there but
[1:49:30] um i knew that i could not go
[1:49:33] uh once i heard that sister waiting that
[1:49:36] passed it
[1:49:37] that just the whole thing kind of threw
[1:49:39] me off a little bit uh
[1:49:42] seeing her that that sunday and she was
[1:49:45] fine and you know every sunday she
[1:49:47] always kind of made it a business to uh
[1:49:50] shake my hand and we would have a small
[1:49:53] conversation and and uh she said god
[1:49:56] bless you to ask me about the family
[1:49:59] you know my kids are uh adults now and
[1:50:02] different ones is gone justin is
[1:50:04] married and william is out of state
[1:50:07] working andrew moved the way christine
[1:50:09] is a man but she always
[1:50:11] uh made it a business to inquire about
[1:50:14] them my wife and my children and we just
[1:50:17] have a little quick conversation and i'm
[1:50:19] jetting towards my car because i'm like
[1:50:22] man that's a little drive to get get you
[1:50:24] know
[1:50:25] to chobe before i get tired and uh
[1:50:28] so so i took a hand i'm still
[1:50:31] uh
[1:50:32] just thinking about you know sunday it
[1:50:34] was a little bit a little bit cool in
[1:50:36] the church and she had this little tan
[1:50:38] hat on and she had a little trench on
[1:50:41] you know one thing you if you know
[1:50:43] anything about uh situation i always
[1:50:46] admired her because she met she kind of
[1:50:48] reminded me of my my grandmother she had
[1:50:51] this certain elegance about her and and
[1:50:54] just her her style and her attire she
[1:50:57] wasn't flashy
[1:50:59] but but you could tell that she was
[1:51:01] influenced by influential people
[1:51:04] and uh it kind of has strutting
[1:51:07] everything and she always really kind of
[1:51:10] because my grandmother maybe was a
[1:51:12] little bit taller than that but my
[1:51:13] grandmother was a thin real classy lady
[1:51:17] real classy lady and and you know uh you
[1:51:21] i just i think everybody had the same
[1:51:23] testimony about sister wayson she was
[1:51:26] elegant elegant and she was all that but
[1:51:28] sister weiss was tough
[1:51:31] so sis waste was a tough lady
[1:51:34] and and my reminder my grandmother she
[1:51:36] was cool but she was tough don't get her
[1:51:38] wrong
[1:51:40] hey man sister wait situation was always
[1:51:43] something else but uh she was always
[1:51:46] special to me uh i always look forward
[1:51:49] to her kind of coming in church and uh
[1:51:53] just sitting there and just just kind of
[1:51:55] uh
[1:51:56] uh maybe watching i maybe want to read
[1:51:59] the scripture and i'll talk a little bit
[1:52:00] and we're just kind of move in and try
[1:52:02] to get out of your way this morning we
[1:52:04] want to read a little passage of
[1:52:06] scripture from the book of ephesians
[1:52:09] chapter one it says uh verse four accord
[1:52:12] as he has chosen us in him before the
[1:52:15] foundation of the world
[1:52:17] that we should be holy without blame
[1:52:19] before him and love having predestinated
[1:52:21] us to the adoption of children by jesus
[1:52:24] christ to himself according to
[1:52:27] the good pleasure of his
[1:52:28] will to the praise of the glory
[1:52:32] of his grace when he has made us
[1:52:34] accepted and beloved in whom we have
[1:52:37] redemption through his blood
[1:52:39] the forgiveness of sins according to
[1:52:42] the riches of his grace when he has made
[1:52:45] he has abounded towards us in all wisdom
[1:52:48] and prudence
[1:52:49] having made known unto us the mystery of
[1:52:52] his will according to the good pleasure
[1:52:55] which he has purposed in himself that in
[1:52:58] the dispensation of the foolish of time
[1:53:00] he might gather together and won all
[1:53:03] things in christ
[1:53:05] both which are in heaven and which are
[1:53:07] on earth even in him
[1:53:10] in whom also we have obtained an
[1:53:12] inheritance
[1:53:13] being predestinated according to the
[1:53:15] purpose of him who worketh all things
[1:53:18] after the council of his own will
[1:53:20] that we should be
[1:53:22] uh to the praise of his glory who first
[1:53:26] trusted in christ
[1:53:27] in whom he also trusted after you heard
[1:53:30] the word of truth the gospel of your
[1:53:32] salvation and whom also after that ye
[1:53:36] believe you were sealed with the holy
[1:53:38] ghost of promise which is the earnest of
[1:53:41] your inheritance
[1:53:42] until the redemption to purchase
[1:53:45] possession until the praise of his glory
[1:53:48] amen may the lord have a blessing to the
[1:53:51] reading of his word
[1:53:52] probably a strange scripture to read and
[1:53:56] read at a funeral was a lot of things
[1:53:58] that we thought about talking about i
[1:54:00] maybe want to use as a topic this
[1:54:02] morning god's purpose
[1:54:04] uh his plan and his
[1:54:07] and um
[1:54:09] just to kind of uh backtrack just a few
[1:54:12] seconds um
[1:54:14] like we say we we saw sister wayson and
[1:54:17] i think our nephew said it uh you just
[1:54:20] figure sometimes that you got time you
[1:54:22] you got time we we don't think about uh
[1:54:25] a lot of times people uh transitioning
[1:54:28] and things of that nature and and as far
[1:54:31] as i i saw uh swayze was fine
[1:54:35] you know she kind of strutted back there
[1:54:36] but but she was she always been kind of
[1:54:39] cold nature even even back in okeechobee
[1:54:41] she'd always say pastor boy this place
[1:54:44] is cold
[1:54:45] [Music]
[1:54:46] it's called butter smiley
[1:54:49] uh but uh we we really appreciate it but
[1:54:52] but just hearing of her transitioning it
[1:54:55] just kind of uh
[1:54:57] threw me just a little bit because it
[1:54:59] was something that you know i wasn't
[1:55:01] expecting and pastoring like we say um
[1:55:05] for for 23 years uh it's just certain
[1:55:08] people
[1:55:09] uh that you look forward to them uh
[1:55:12] coming to church when they walk in you
[1:55:14] just feel it's just it's just something
[1:55:17] about it that as a as a servant of god
[1:55:19] as a minister of god and the preachers
[1:55:21] know what i'm talking it's just certain
[1:55:23] people when they show up you know that
[1:55:25] they're going to pull on the word of god
[1:55:27] they go they're going to help you get
[1:55:29] through it no matter what you're saying
[1:55:31] amen how you might be cutting what
[1:55:33] you're saying they're going to be riding
[1:55:35] with you and sister wayson was that kind
[1:55:37] of church member
[1:55:39] one of the things that you know i'm
[1:55:41] reminded of i remember you know when i
[1:55:43] started pastoring i was really really
[1:55:45] young in the ministry
[1:55:47] and and oftentimes i used to tell god
[1:55:50] you know why me you know i ain't ready
[1:55:53] for this he said you might not be ready
[1:55:55] but you got to do it all right and and
[1:55:57] and i'll say this and and pastoring and
[1:56:00] pastoring
[1:56:01] uh uh matured people in the gospel puts
[1:56:05] a lot of pressure on you especially
[1:56:07] especially when when you're young in the
[1:56:09] gospel and you you don't have the
[1:56:12] confidence and i ain't that individual
[1:56:14] in mo all right but at that time amen
[1:56:17] you know as a young convert i mean a
[1:56:20] young minister and and you know having
[1:56:22] to just kind of preach to people like
[1:56:24] you know
[1:56:25] sister burrs and sister lewis and
[1:56:28] crossed over and and sister wasting and
[1:56:30] sometimes you know uh sister joseph
[1:56:34] uh would come from trinidad and she'd be
[1:56:37] in the congregation boy put pressure on
[1:56:39] you as a young man i tell you and and
[1:56:42] and you know you just you just looking
[1:56:45] for a nod
[1:56:46] you're looking for some kind of response
[1:56:49] uh or something uh uh from them but you
[1:56:53] know it it it was a blessing being able
[1:56:55] to pass to them and preach to them you
[1:56:58] know because because they were
[1:57:00] instrumental in my growth amen as a
[1:57:02] servant of god because they constantly
[1:57:06] pulled on the word of god they
[1:57:07] constantly uh uh encouraged me uh in the
[1:57:12] gospel through through my many my just
[1:57:14] many ups and downs being there support
[1:57:17] that means a lot for any shepherd
[1:57:21] to just find people that's supportive of
[1:57:24] you amen when when you're just trying to
[1:57:26] preach christ to the people and and
[1:57:29] trying to bring the people to a place
[1:57:31] where they just really understand what
[1:57:33] amen god's plan and purpose actually is
[1:57:37] and and you know thinking about her her
[1:57:40] her death you know uh in in the flesh
[1:57:44] it's still difficult you know it's going
[1:57:46] to take a little minute to kind of get
[1:57:48] over it but but by understanding what
[1:57:51] god's purpose and plan
[1:57:53] and promises are that helps me a man as
[1:57:58] an individual
[1:57:59] realizing amen um um the deaf angel
[1:58:03] couldn't have took her
[1:58:05] until god was done with her right no
[1:58:07] matter no matter how it looked
[1:58:10] god god's amen uh uh was done with her
[1:58:14] service on this earth on this side it
[1:58:17] was done it was finished
[1:58:20] is that right
[1:58:21] death death was just was harmless it was
[1:58:24] just her transportation
[1:58:28] from this dimension to that dimension
[1:58:31] said right now now as a believer
[1:58:35] it was just her transportation
[1:58:38] because because
[1:58:40] amen
[1:58:41] in the mind of god god said this is the
[1:58:44] time
[1:58:45] way before she ever even got here this
[1:58:48] will be the time
[1:58:49] this will be the date
[1:58:51] is that right that she'll transition
[1:58:54] regardless of what anybody think
[1:58:57] regardless of what anybody feel
[1:58:59] this is the time
[1:59:00] this is the date this will be the moment
[1:59:03] and i'm gonna tell you something i was
[1:59:05] thinking about something
[1:59:07] because we had we kind of have a pretty
[1:59:09] uh praying church and and we gotta get
[1:59:11] some results when we start praying
[1:59:14] and and and you know i was just thinking
[1:59:16] about something i said god said you know
[1:59:17] what i'm gonna take a soul swift
[1:59:21] i'm gonna take out of here so fast
[1:59:24] i ain't gonna give them time to start
[1:59:26] praying
[1:59:29] i ain't gonna give him time to start
[1:59:31] moaning and and groaning and and
[1:59:34] pleading with god
[1:59:36] i'm gonna take the soul swift
[1:59:38] i was at work and and troy brother troy
[1:59:40] called me and and and he said you know
[1:59:43] jack jack called you and i said no he
[1:59:46] said situation in the hospital and i
[1:59:48] looked and i saw where jack had sent me
[1:59:50] a text and i was like what
[1:59:52] then we you know kind of the day went on
[1:59:54] and got off work and you know talked
[1:59:56] about jack and everything and then by i
[1:59:58] then went to bed and
[2:00:00] got up next morning i seen the text i
[2:00:02] was like oh wow
[2:00:04] mind blowing
[2:00:07] but it was god's plan
[2:00:10] amen
[2:00:12] it was god's plan
[2:00:14] it was god's it was god's plan
[2:00:17] it was god's purpose to do it
[2:00:20] right
[2:00:21] not for not right you know one of the
[2:00:23] things i realized and i ain't gonna be
[2:00:25] here but but a minute right but one of
[2:00:27] the things i realized we we we are under
[2:00:30] this notion that we're going to be here
[2:00:34] amen uh forever
[2:00:37] but what we don't realize this world is
[2:00:39] falling apart
[2:00:42] is that right there's there's something
[2:00:44] that's there's a shift
[2:00:47] there's a transition that's taking place
[2:00:51] is that right
[2:00:52] this has got to give way so that could
[2:00:55] come in
[2:00:57] is that right
[2:00:58] when we we we understand the principles
[2:01:01] of scripture
[2:01:03] right we we realize amen uh the the call
[2:01:08] of god was for a purpose
[2:01:10] god calling situation had a purpose a
[2:01:13] redemptive purpose
[2:01:15] something that goes far beyond
[2:01:18] amen all of the things she did in the
[2:01:21] natural
[2:01:23] is that right
[2:01:25] amen
[2:01:27] you know god had her name placed on the
[2:01:30] land book of life before the
[2:01:31] foundational world
[2:01:34] is that right god called her she heeded
[2:01:37] the call
[2:01:38] amen she fulfilled scripture
[2:01:41] she lived the life on this side is that
[2:01:44] right but that ain't it
[2:01:47] is that ain't it i'm always reminded of
[2:01:50] the song my mother-in-law sings you know
[2:01:52] somebody tell you that i'm dead and gone
[2:01:54] don't believe them
[2:01:57] is that right in another part say my
[2:02:00] life
[2:02:01] still
[2:02:03] going right on
[2:02:05] is that right
[2:02:07] see see here's the thing here's the
[2:02:09] reason i really can't be sad because i
[2:02:11] realize amen god had a plan and a
[2:02:14] purpose god has a plan and a purpose
[2:02:17] and and and that's only going to be
[2:02:20] somebody going to be alive and remaining
[2:02:23] going to be changed
[2:02:25] but everybody else got to come this way
[2:02:27] also
[2:02:30] is that right but you know what i
[2:02:32] realize it's going to be all right
[2:02:34] but for the believer
[2:02:37] it's all right
[2:02:39] right amen there was there was a time in
[2:02:42] scripture where where people feared
[2:02:45] death
[2:02:46] job questioned about it he could see
[2:02:50] nature having a resurrection
[2:02:52] but he couldn't see it in humanity
[2:02:55] right
[2:02:56] to god gave him a revelation
[2:02:59] right but but
[2:03:01] under under grace and truth
[2:03:05] we we can see clearly by scripture
[2:03:10] is that right amen the bible said let's
[2:03:12] just know that if this earthly
[2:03:14] tabernacle be dissolved i got another
[2:03:16] body
[2:03:18] this this
[2:03:19] scripturally
[2:03:22] scripturally description lets us know
[2:03:26] that there's
[2:03:27] the best is yet to come
[2:03:29] i remember we used to sing that song all
[2:03:31] the time brother west coast the best is
[2:03:33] yet to come
[2:03:34] is that right
[2:03:35] amen we ain't seen nothing yet
[2:03:39] the best is still yet to come
[2:03:43] when when we when we transition
[2:03:46] right as believers from from this
[2:03:49] dimension to that next dimension it gets
[2:03:52] better
[2:03:54] is that right
[2:03:56] oh my
[2:03:58] you know i like bible i just like the
[2:04:00] bible yeah the bible lets me know you
[2:04:02] know what when i transition
[2:04:05] i ain't got to worry about crying no
[2:04:06] more
[2:04:09] amen i ain't got to worry about worrying
[2:04:11] about bills no more
[2:04:15] i ain't got the i ain't got to worry
[2:04:17] about the aches and pains no more
[2:04:21] huh in my other body my hair is there
[2:04:26] come on when i get when i got converted
[2:04:29] in 1988 i had hair i you know the little
[2:04:32] half i had in here it was black
[2:04:35] all right
[2:04:36] now now it's great
[2:04:38] it it it gets better
[2:04:41] is that right according to god's plan
[2:04:44] and its purpose
[2:04:46] it all gets better
[2:04:48] is that right i watched situation over
[2:04:51] the years like like people say she just
[2:04:53] had a strut man walking behind sister
[2:04:56] waiting you had to have some be in good
[2:04:58] shape she
[2:04:59] she'd strike out and probably leave you
[2:05:01] yeah you know huh and brother west go
[2:05:04] back in the day brother wesker used to
[2:05:05] move so fast it was like my god you the
[2:05:08] long strides
[2:05:11] but you know what we're we're all
[2:05:13] getting older
[2:05:15] we're all getting older we're all
[2:05:18] getting uh uh closer to
[2:05:23] what what we we've been preaching about
[2:05:27] what we've been talking about
[2:05:29] what what we've been shouting about here
[2:05:32] since the way she just beat me there
[2:05:35] right she she she just beat me there
[2:05:38] said right you know god god was just
[2:05:41] finished with her life on this side
[2:05:44] god said you know what hey man go get
[2:05:46] her is that right
[2:05:49] he left us because a lot of us probably
[2:05:51] just need to get ourselves together
[2:05:54] y'all don't talk to me
[2:05:57] i'm free to go but
[2:05:59] right he realized she she lived a life
[2:06:01] worthy of the gospel

[2:06:36] calvary
[2:06:38] accepting accepting his plan and his

[2:14:12] sisters were taking care of her and she
[2:14:14] had some problems with her with her feet
[2:14:16] there
[2:14:17] and um you know she could barely walk
[2:14:20] barely put shoes on
[2:14:22] uh it was a real real struggle for and
[2:14:25] you know she was just saying pray for me
[2:14:26] i want to i want to be in church and not
[2:14:29] only just be in church she wanted to be
[2:14:30] in the prayer meetings that we were
[2:14:31] having at church you know that was 7 a.m
[2:14:33] in the morning on sunday mornings we'd
[2:14:35] be there
[2:14:36] and uh for years sister wayston was
[2:14:38] always there even if she was a part of
[2:14:40] the church in okeechobee she still since
[2:14:42] she lived right down the street from the
[2:14:43] church she said i just want to come go
[2:14:45] to prayer and then i'll go back home and
[2:14:47] get ready and you know going over to
[2:14:49] okeechobee so for years you know it's
[2:14:50] been fellowship like that
[2:14:52] but uh last year when she came and she
[2:14:54] was having problems with the feet just
[2:14:56] really couldn't walk and uh there was a
[2:14:58] lot of things going on and you know and
[2:15:01] and the saints just began to pray and as
[2:15:03] they began to pray we saw god touch
[2:15:07] uh sister
[2:15:08] and uh and i remember one morning uh i
[2:15:11] was
[2:15:12] coming to prayer and walking through the
[2:15:14] parking lot and i see sister wayson
[2:15:16] jumping out the car
[2:15:18] and uh and just i mean look like she
[2:15:20] took off almost running trying to get
[2:15:22] inside the church before the clock
[2:15:24] struck seven
[2:15:25] and uh and i was just so blessed and i
[2:15:27] told my wife i said look at sister ways
[2:15:29] and look at how god done touched to look
[2:15:31] at that you know and it just something
[2:15:33] that uh just really blessed my heart and
[2:15:34] like brother smiling and saying had god
[2:15:36] not taken her the way he took her we
[2:15:39] would have been we then prayed her right
[2:15:40] on back in amen and and i'm quite sure
[2:15:43] sister wayson's in a place that had we
[2:15:46] prayed her back she might have had a
[2:15:48] stern look for all of us
[2:15:51] come on somebody amen she graduated
[2:15:56] amen so we rejoice with our sister and
[2:15:58] you know as he talked about you know
[2:16:00] just just death is nothing but a driver
[2:16:06] transportation
[2:16:07] to take into the presence of god
[2:16:10] uh you know they told you the story i
[2:16:12] and i want you to think about i want you
[2:16:13] to get this in your mind because what
[2:16:15] you've heard here today will actually
[2:16:17] bring judgment to some of us
[2:16:19] she
[2:16:20] would catch a cab from coral springs
[2:16:24] all the way here to west palm beach to
[2:16:26] this church and and i want you to go
[2:16:28] maybe go on google and find out how much
[2:16:30] it costs
[2:16:32] for you to catch a cab to come to church
[2:16:35] and she did it faithfully never asking
[2:16:38] anything of anybody
[2:16:40] but i believe some saints found out that
[2:16:42] she was doing this and they decided that
[2:16:45] they would begin to pick her up and
[2:16:47] drive her and and one of those things
[2:16:49] that found out about it was my mother
[2:16:50] who sung earlier
[2:16:52] and uh and at that time i was just a
[2:16:54] young man
[2:16:55] uh a teenager
[2:16:58] and i was just learning how to drive and
[2:17:00] you know so mama uh uh and employed
[2:17:06] um a driver
[2:17:08] and uh our responsibility was to you
[2:17:10] know get in the car with mama and we
[2:17:12] would drive from here to coral springs
[2:17:15] to pick up sister wasting and then we
[2:17:17] would drive back to church and then we
[2:17:20] have two services on sunday and we'd
[2:17:22] drive back home that night and then
[2:17:24] drive back to west palm beach and we did
[2:17:27] this for for a number of years
[2:17:29] i was her driver
[2:17:32] praise the lord
[2:17:34] i was her driver
[2:17:38] and um
[2:17:41] within the last year you know many of
[2:17:43] you all i i won't let me let me just
[2:17:45] also include some of you all were
[2:17:47] responsible for driving her from here to
[2:17:50] okeechobee and bringing her back i
[2:17:52] believe sister ashley was talking about
[2:17:54] early but there are other families in
[2:17:55] here that were responsible you were her
[2:17:58] driver
[2:17:59] you were her driver the reason that they
[2:18:01] couldn't get her to drive because she
[2:18:03] needed some drivers
[2:18:10] about a year ago um a little over a year
[2:18:13] ago
[2:18:14] uh the churches merged and uh i had the
[2:18:17] opportunity to pastor and we've had many
[2:18:19] conversations just about the word of god
[2:18:21] and just a real blessing a man to have
[2:18:24] sister wayson in our
[2:18:26] uh congregation but through the
[2:18:28] preaching and the teaching
[2:18:30] of the word of god i still was her
[2:18:35] driver
[2:18:36] and the purpose of driving now is to try
[2:18:38] to drive her closer to god
[2:18:41] through the preaching and teaching of
[2:18:42] the work we were trying to drive her
[2:18:44] closer to god and i had the awesome
[2:18:46] privilege
[2:18:50] to stand at her bedside
[2:18:52] on the night that she passed
[2:18:55] and when she called me and they took her
[2:18:57] to the hospital we went and we prayed
[2:18:59] over her and
[2:19:00] prayed with her and some of the saints
[2:19:02] were there sister michelle and
[2:19:04] sister brown sister virginia
[2:19:07] uh uh her cousin errol hey man they were
[2:19:10] all there and you know just visiting her
[2:19:12] at the hospital and we
[2:19:14] we we knew that it would take a miracle
[2:19:16] for god to raise her up
[2:19:17] and uh you know we just kind of watched
[2:19:19] we prayed and we just waited on the lord
[2:19:21] and you know we said lord it's all in
[2:19:22] your hands he's the one that
[2:19:24] gives life and he takes it away it's all
[2:19:26] it's all up to god so you know we just
[2:19:29] prayed we had the church praying at
[2:19:30] night i left the hospital went to the
[2:19:32] church and did our teaching for the
[2:19:34] night and and then i got a call you know
[2:19:36] after uh service was over got a call say
[2:19:39] hey we're not sure she's gonna make it
[2:19:41] through the night and and uh so i said
[2:19:43] okay i'm i'm on my way back to the
[2:19:45] hospital and we went there to the
[2:19:46] hospital and um and what we got there is
[2:19:50] me and sister brown and sister virginia
[2:19:52] and sister ashley
[2:19:54] a man uh four four of us that were there
[2:19:57] and uh the nurse was telling us you know
[2:19:59] everything that was going on and i was
[2:20:01] just watching just watching my precious
[2:20:03] sister and and i have to tell you um it
[2:20:06] was one of the most peaceful transitions
[2:20:09] i ever saw in all my life
[2:20:11] uh seeing her just look like all she did
[2:20:13] was just fall asleep
[2:20:15] and i couldn't believe what i was
[2:20:16] witnessing and i said man this is this
[2:20:19] is what the bible uh when the bible says
[2:20:21] precious
[2:20:23] in the sight of the lord
[2:20:25] is the death of one of his saints i said
[2:20:27] this is
[2:20:29] precious
[2:20:31] and and as the nurse began to test it
[2:20:33] now look uh you know we we you know they
[2:20:35] had a connected to the machines that
[2:20:36] were supposed to be given a life but a
[2:20:38] life is just slowly fading away and we
[2:20:41] knew this was the hand of god so as we
[2:20:43] were there in the hospital i reached
[2:20:45] real quick and i got my bible because
[2:20:47] the nurse the nurse came and she said
[2:20:48] look i don't think it's gonna be much
[2:20:50] longer i don't think it's gonna be much
[2:20:52] longer i say okay okay so i reached and
[2:20:53] got my bible and i said i think i'm
[2:20:55] gonna need to drive
[2:21:00] because i was a driver earliest and i'm
[2:21:01] gonna be a driver at the end too i say
[2:21:04] while i'm on this side i want to drive
[2:21:05] her right into the presence of god
[2:21:08] so i reached over and i got my bible
[2:21:10] and i picked up my bible and i began to
[2:21:12] drive
[2:21:13] i say the lord is my shepherd
[2:21:18] i shall not want
[2:21:21] he maketh me to lie down in green
[2:21:23] pastures
[2:21:24] he leadeth me beside steel waters
[2:21:27] he restoreth my soul
[2:21:30] he leadeth me in the path of
[2:21:31] righteousness for his namesake
[2:21:34] and i kept driving i say yes oh i walk
[2:21:37] [Music]
[2:21:38] through the valley of the shadow of
[2:21:40] death
[2:21:41] i will fear no evil
[2:21:43] for thou art with me thy rod and thy
[2:21:46] staff they comfort me thou prepare us a
[2:21:49] table before me in the presence of my
[2:21:52] enemies
[2:21:53] thou anointed my head with oil my cup
[2:21:57] runneth over surely
[2:22:05] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[2:22:09] me
[2:22:10] all the days of my life
[2:22:12] and i shall dwell
[2:22:15] [Music]
