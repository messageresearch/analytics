uh brother smiley spoke at uh brother lee blues church uh on last sunday and they had a wonderful time and i spoke at brother jason watkins church and we had a wonderful time and and the lee blue wanted me to mention he said bro jack uh kind of when things settle down because this covet thing is just with us right it's just with us and uh but they say when things settle down we want y'all to

we will i'll make sure i make the announcement you know and uh but you know it was it was a real real blessed time there of fellowship and just looking forward to what god has in store uh as we go forward so um also we when we say a word over the the prayer over the scripture we also want to remember sister wayson uh and our prayers amen she's been battling uh for a little bit here and we we just want to come against the enemy uh on behalf of our precious sister amen the devil is still a liar all right he's still a lion no matter what and uh you know i mean god just so so so precise uh my wife was calling me while we were waiting just telling me just you know feed me all the information i was okay okay and i could just hear you know just um not only in her voice but i can hear in some of the saints voices that was giving my wife the information the concern and and i was telling my wife i said it's gonna be all right it's gonna be all right and uh you know there was a a a testimony i'm gonna try to let y'all sit down in a second just just bear with me uh testimony my brother shared that um a man walked out the hospital they gave him a diagnosis he walked out the hospital to brother jason watkins church there in beaufort and he said i got the diagnosis of what's going on but i want to just go to this church because i heard they pray for the sick and uh it says let me go down and get prayed for first and then i'll come back to the hospital so he said he went and kind of got there walked to church and i got there towards the end of the service and you know he said look i'm just tell y'all my testimony why i'm here because they diagnosed me with this this and this and he says uh i just want to come here and get prayed for and then i'll go back to the hospital let them do whatever they're going to do so he said i just want to be prayed for first so they laid hands on him prayed for him he walked back to the hospital didn't even take a ride just walk back when they got there and re-ran the test his problem was taken care of [Applause] so when we when we come into contact with different things i want to encourage church only belief only believe our god is is faithful you know and we just we're just going to come against the devil on behalf of her and and i found out while she was taken to the hospital there was a lot of concerns and things like this and and we got got when she got there there happened to be one of us on on duty all right one of the one of the saints on duty and and that that that saint of doctor you know was there to kind of see some things through so god know what he doing and just leave it all in god's hands amen amen let's read a second uh i mean acts chapter 2 verse 15 uh for these are not drunken uh as he supposed seeing it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel and it shall come to pass in the last days saith god i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and what we need to gather from this uh passage is that it's pretty much saying god is gonna move in the last days and uh and however he decides to move that's up to him but he is going to move that's a promise a man through scripture so verse 18 says and on my servants and on my handmaidens i will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy all right and i will show wonders in heaven above and signs in the earth beneath and blood and fire and vapor of smoke uh the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before that great and notable day of the lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved so the lord had a blessing to the reading of his word shall we just bow in a brief word of prayer god we thank you for the uh privilege and opportunity we have to come into the house of god uh how we appreciate the spirit of the lord that has been um moving in this place through from the first note that was played even to this point god we have felt your spirit and we can say it's good to be in the house of god it's good to feel the presence of god and good to feel the spirit of god and lord we just know that you have more that you want to do in our midst so we ask that you would just take complete control of the thought and that you would establish us on the word uh realizing heavens and earth will pass away but the word will remain forever so establish us here thank you for each and everyone that's come into the house of god and may you bless uh every ear that we hear the word of god maybe something that we could all apply to our lives and live after we leave this place today god we give you all the glory all the honor and all the praise it's in jesus name also father i want to remember uh sister wayson and uh god the enemy just been attacking her body but you told us in your word that you were wounded for our transgressions you were bruised for our iniquities you said the chastisement of our peace is upon you and with your stripes uh we declare healing so our sisters just been fighting lord for some time now and and no matter uh father the doctors may say it's related to this related to that we don't know but we know it's a devil that's attacking the body and we have authority as sons and daughters of god uh to bind the devil you told us that what we bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and what we loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven so save him we bind you in every demon that you have assigned to our sister and in between her and her condition we place the blood of the lord jesus christ and father we loose your healing virtue to flow from the crown of our head to the souls of our feet may she be completely made whole in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen somebody give god praise for it already being done [Applause] [Music] praise the lord you can be seated in the presence of the lord um we started uh this year off with uh um the just in this little series on the junction and uh today we want to title this sermon the second junction a man pulling from the sermon a junction of time that brother branham spoke on and i i did also want to mention uh last sunday brother quaker we appreciate the word of the lord that came forth from you and just uh just so much there and i'm like wow god has a way of just using his different gifts and and i've come to just appreciate how god uses each one you know we're we're all different and uh but all made by god and uh and just what a gift brother kwaku is to the body a man of christ so uh thank you so much brother uh so we're we're starting a man uh this uh uh sermon today the second junction i will just read a couple quotes uh from the first message to kind of bring us forward if we can so that everybody's on the same page and uh and we will just go from there this is my first quote's coming out of the message the junction of time and lord knows we are in a critical hour knows this is a critical season uh you know and everybody uh if you are a message believer i'm coming back to that sis uh if you are a message believer uh you've been looking at certain prophecies amen for a long time i'm coming back to that sis amen you've been looking at certain prophecies for a long time and um and we just had this week a very direct prophecy come from the prophet 87 years ago come to pass and uh and and you know a lot a lot a lot a lot a lot of people uh you know have looked at this from different angles but you know i looked at it from the angle of the catholic church looked at it from the angle of other powerful women that rose up but he said thus saith the lord he said a woman will be vice president or president amen uh pretty much before jesus come he said if it don't happen he says i am a false prophet and he said thus saith the lord right he said it twice right and we saw it manifest itself and then not only that he said i saw a woman she was decked in purple right this is what i'm just telling this division and here she comes out in the inauguration decked in purple even saying she had pearls on i mean this is very precise for a prophet right and uh 87 years you know he said seven things would happen before the coming of the lord jesus and that was the sixth of the seven things the next thing that happens before the coming of the lord he said he said there would be debris all over the land of america so we are we are headed for some things and uh and i don't know about you but i am i i i i know that we're closer now to the coming of the lord than we've ever been and uh and i'm on the expectation amen to get out of here i'm i'm looking forward to it praise the lord it wasn't just a a political something i i told the church here months ago and i wan i want to be very clear i am not a follower of politics i don't follow politics but i do follow prophecy amen right so it don't matter to me who win i ain't leaving the country on who win and who lose i'm not leaving praise the lord i'ma stay right here it don't matter all of them are of the devil you don't believe that read your bible matthew chapter four amen because satan told jesus if you were bowed down i will give you the kingdoms of this world so satan is in control only because god is allowing him to be in control but for us as the bride we're not shook by nothing that happens the scripture has to be fulfilled you your vote can't stop that's prophecy even if they have to uh rig the machines this prophecy gonna be fulfilled hallelujah somebody glory to god you know things was rigged in the days of esau and jacob the mama rigged some stuff but it did not stop prophecy come on somebody the devil may be trying to rig some things in your life but it won't stop prophecy come on church we got to know where we stand when it comes to this word we're not shook by nothing why because this world is not my home i am a citizen of another kingdom praise god glory to god heaven is my home church glory to god i act funny i look funny i do all kinds of things because this is not my world this is going to be changed amen burnt up glory to god hallelujah let me try to read a little bit for you today if i can but you know just you know as we as as believers we ought to be excited for the hour in which we live amen god just vindicated this message once again once again all right let's uh let me start here the junction of time um it says my subject this morning if we should call it such will be the message to the church is the junction of time it says and always in the days gone by the dispensations has always come to their end and we hit a junction amen we hit a junction uh you know and he says um uh there's junctions on the highways glory to god they junction on the roads that we travel in this world so so so so there's junctions on natural highways if i can put it that way and there's also junctions on spiritual highways [Music] glory to god and i can just put it like this everybody that is in this church right now starting from the pulpit to the back door hit a spiritual junction every last one of us had to hit a spiritual junction and there's things that have to happen when you hit the junction glory to god if we make the wrong decision at the junction it can create havoc glory to god church amen glory so let's go on says it says there are junctions on the highways the junk they junction on the roads that we travel in this world they junction on this grand old highway that we travel to glory and always it takes the miraculous to speak of omnipotence omnipotence is the all-powerful and it takes the miraculous to vindicate the omnipotence and really what i get from that is that at a junction we look for god to vindicate the decisions that we make hallelujah and i'm trusting that god will vindicate every decision that has been made when you hit the junction god vindicates oh glory to god i i just this quote just hits me i don't i don't remember amen the exact word but you know um uh uh brother branham was preaching and after he finished preaching brother walked up to him and said brother that could be the 23rd chapter you know of the book of revelation and uh he said i don't want to be sacrilegious and add to the word say but that could be the 23rd chapter of the book of revelation and uh and and he said as the brother was talking the holy spirit came upon the brother he began to speak in tongues the man had never spoken tongues one day in his life but he began to speak in tongues and while he was speaking in tongues after the sermon glory to god he was speaking in tongues he say uh there was three people standing in the area and the three people say oh that don't need no interpretation they say why because it's perfect prince the man didn't know french he said but that is perfect french that don't need no interpretation brother brandon said wait wait wait wait before y'all say a word you go over there you go over there you go over there and write down what he said each one came back with what they wrote down and each one was exactly the same hallelujah and i believe in there he says uh he says uh you know you chose the heart away you know it was and it wasn't easy but when you got to the junction come on somebody you chose god didn't make you do it but you chose the hurdle way and then an interpreter say this is my way and because you chose the hardaway it will bring to pass a tremendous victory in love divine i'm expecting the miraculous a man to speak of omnipotence all right he says and only the miraculous can do that he says teach another word is a very fine thing he says and uh it comes faith comes by hearing and hearing the word but it always takes miraculous to vindicate that the omnipotence still lives and reigns we must have the miraculous glory to god i'm expecting that in this church glory to god amen if you have to use sister wayson to prove that he's miraculous then let him use sister wayson but i'm expecting that all right now another thing that i want to point out here because this is going to be important as we go forward i'm going to the message here you him uh as we go forward in the sermon we're just laying the foundation amen for this it says every uh every junction of time god sends forth prophets then angels and gives a warning so in every junction of time god sends forth prophets then angels and gives a warning like in uh before the antediluvian destruction before every other time god always sends warnings first amen and then he says um uh he cannot put punishment on the earth without and be just without first sending warning all right glory to god so he has to send a prophet then he says angels and that's to give a warning to the people glory to god glory to god we have received our prophet for this day amen god always does it that way before uh when a junction occurs all right i'm gonna stop right there in that particular quote and uh and this will i'm gonna move on down to uh when their when their eyes were open all right so just just bear with me because i believe that this is where we are now also as as i just kind of define this a junction is a point where two or more things are joined and i preached this amen the first sunday of the year this is my first message the first junction and i said a junction is a point where two or more things are joined right come on church i don't have to be that basic i mean that that basic with you right i mean it's not it's not there's not no uh no big revelation that's going over anybody's head this should be very simple i said a junction is a point where two or more things are joined and i told the church on on that sunday now we're at a junction and then i had to announce something to him after service and brother smiley announced something after his service and can't y'all see two or more things joined what does that tell you if ain't no other church there we are there we're at a junction and decisions have to be made at the junction and god has to confirm the decisions god has to prove that he is in the decision and i i am i'm telling you right now i don't want you to be alarmed i am expecting god to prove that he that that the right decision has been made i'm looking for god himself to confirm some things i'm looking for god himself to vindicate some things hallelujah church i'm looking for the supernatural i'm looking for the miraculous i'm looking for omnipotent to do something i'm omnipotence must speak the miraculous will take place all right watch this and christ is identified in uh and it's in in these ages now um i want to bring this in because a junction is also a place where we might have sometimes we have to turn corners and sometimes they have to keep going straight you know you ever been into like you get over to england they don't have a lot of stop lights they have the roundabouts right and then a roundabout you still kind of have to slightly make a a turn to get through that roundabout and you better know if you you get lost in a roundabout you can oh my god it might be some trouble but you got to know exactly which turn to take if you don't if you're not careful you'll find yourself right where you started and now you now you're starting all over again because you got lost in the roundabout sometimes they have some real large roundabouts traffic coming from all directions but you better know how to squeeze your car into if you want to get off there you got to squeeze that car in to get it off there otherwise you stuck in the roundabout trying to oh what am i you can't be like that you got to sometimes be a little bit aggressive and with the devil church sometimes you got to be aggressive you can't always be on the defense you need to go on the offense praise god amen as believers we don't always run from the devil when the season change we chase devil [Applause] hallelujah glory to god wanna chase a thousand and two will put ten thousand to a flight i told you i don't even understand that mathematics i don't realize i have no idea what three will do and what fool will do and what five will do i know this much we won't be defeated [Applause] glory to god so when we get to terms we get to junctions and then we have to make turns sometimes it's difficult for some people it's difficult for some people right and this is what the prophet said in christ is identified the same in all generations it says and now we find that in each one of those ages ages usually people don't want to believe it because they're already set in their way ain't none but the truth right and and the reason that people can't make the turn with you because they already set in their way they already in a made a decision before they come to the pastor and actually the the coming to the past is really not to get any counsel it's not to get advice it's just to inform [Applause] i'm just coming to inform you i'm coming to let you know so when you stand before the church you can tell them that i talk to you all right no problem i got the information i'll share with the church but if you wanted uh you wanted somebody to give you counsel godly counsel now that's a different approach come on somebody pastor i like to talk i like to get some godly counsel i like to get maybe what the lord might be sharing with you right hey man this rifle get lost in the roundabouts you know all right now i'm just i'm just going i'm going forward amen but but we don't want to see nobody lost in the roundabout right just just follow just follow some some of us or a man uh like like in in the duck family there's one duck anointed to lead everybody else follows if we had all the ducks trying to lead we would see no ducks in the south but some duck had to submit and say you know what i'm a follower i hear what you're saying come on when that duck say hunk i hear what you're saying it sounds pretty good all right i think god is in the duck all right it says uh usually people don't want to believe it because they're already setting their way you're turning a corner you're turning a corner you're building a building and then get to the corner everybody's running this way and they don't want to turn that corner but the building goes that way if the word says it goes that way see there's where we get those junctions of time that's where it's hard that's where men had had to sweat it out all right so when we hit a junction sometimes things get a little difficult adjustments have to be made praise the lord and if you're not prepared for a junction you know things can happen to you along the way you can become what we call a casualty yeah we don't want that to happen to you what we're trying to share with you by the spirit is that we are here at a junction this is a time of change for everybody it's a time of change for the nation even if you don't want change [Music] they can have a chair set for you for you to be a part of a certain event you don't show up to sit in your chair they still gotta have the event i hope you can read between the line they don't have the event glory to god you don't stop nothing that that's the problem all right we feel like we're the ones that can you don't stop nothing i've learned a long time ago somebody will replace you fast [Music] my brother taught me that they say you think you're the only one somebody will replace you you come back to church with somebody sitting in your chair [Applause] praise the lord anyhow just stay stay connected during this junction all right so let me go on a little further this message when their eyes were open um i want to bring this in uh and then we'll kind of slip on down a little further here okay uh how many read the sermon when omnipotence speaks miracles happen did you you believe that certainly omnipotence spoke at every junction and when the church cooled off and then omnipotence spoke miracles take place and this is the junction of all junctions this is the end time the end of the whole history of the world is right now at hand i want to tell you you're not waiting on the future you're actually living in it right there's a lot of churches they waiting on things in the book of revelation to be fulfilled don't realize it's already been fulfilled right hey man you stick around here long enough we can show you where these things have already happened right you look at that that this this chart over here the seven church ages that's revelation one two and three completed already completed amen and at the end of you know leaders in church age which is the age that we're living in right now right we're we're living in it but we're not of it so i'm not allowed to see him and i'ma say you're not allowed to see it you are the bride of jesus christ who happens to be living in laodicea glory to god but there's a there's there's many things that we can look at from a scripture standpoint and realize we we're at the end of the end there's nothing else coming after this and when we look at them seven different visions we know and six or seven already fulfilled like that we already know it ain't much it's not much left i i'm my prayer is even so come lord jesus right so so church i tell you uh we got to recognize where we are we're not we need to get in our hurry for god amen we need to get in a hurry uh brother west could you say get all you can and can't all you get amen with the new administration i would not doubt that we might not be able to meet like this i wouldn't doubt it that the church doors could get shut i wouldn't doubt it amen we saw just a little bit of it but it might get greater than that all right so you better take advantage of what you got now glory to god all right all right let me go it says uh the church cooled off and then omnipotence spoke miracles take place and this is the junction of all junctions this is the end time the end of the whole history of the world is right now at hand so you can expect omnipotence to speak and you can expect the greatest and mightiest miracles that's ever happened on the earth will happen in the next few years to come can i just inject something there you know and in the past few years we saw you can take that one down uh uh and i'm gonna come right back to in a second uh but in the past few years we have saw some of the greatest triumphs that we ever saw i mean if somebody would have told us 30 years ago that we'd be going through some of the things we've gone through right now we would have told them you're a lying prophet you know ain't no way that's going to happen impossible right we were just told there ain't no way you know but but when we look at it now we have been hit with some of the hardest stuff that that that i think anybody in scripture might have been hit with we we had to endure it glory to god but but here's the good thing about it if we seen satan act up amen if we see satan cut loose then it's time for god also to cut loose so since we weathered the storm why not expect omnipotence to do something miraculous in our midst praise god he said so you can expect omnipotence to speak and you can expect the greatest and mightiest miracles that's ever happened on earth will happen in the next few years to come if jesus tears it will be he says then watch for satan to raise up raise up his two when all heaven turns loose all hell turns loose too so he's telling us we need to be watchful of that the devil's going to try to do something and this is why brother branham says just stick that closer together you have to be under you know satan gonna try to do something when brother branham was told by the you know the angel already saying now there's a trap set for you now i just just recently as i was thinking on this if the angel can tell them there is a trap can't that same angel tell them what the trap is not not just there is a trap tell me what the trap is right but the angel didn't do you say just be careful there's a trap now the reason that the angel didn't tell him what the trap was because we all must walk by faith and not by sight so even the prophet had to walk by faith and he had to listen to what they said now there's a trap set for you he says okay i don't know what this is but he told the church he said told some brothers say the the spirit lord told me there's a trap set for me i don't know what the trap is but it's one set for me and he going to church he starts preaching he's preaching and the next thing you know this young man this young woman in church and they start making out and they say uh just stop y'all that's that's not the right time the right place for nothing like that please don't do that stop he goes on the preacher the man just looked at him and laughed at him just kept on you know doing what he was doing with his girlfriend brother man i'm saying now if y'all want to go get a room or something go get a room but don't don't do that in the house of god and uh you know you're just getting fed up with them and the guys start you know it was like a challenge you know the guy started looking and laughing at him like oh lord you know and it just struck him this is the trap it's like oh there's the trap say okay uh and then they say heard a voice say if you say blindness they'll be blind if you say death it'll be death right now whatever you say is going to be just like that challenging him hallelujah glory to god so brother branham looked at the situation he said oh lord i don't i don't know what to say and god wouldn't tell him what to say but he said then he looked at the situation like uh uh i forgive you not death and that thought didn't the come was death or blindness something evil something wicked to show how much power you got huh but no but but but he said i forgive you and and and then he said god said he was pleased with that decision that he made it was showing the character of christ that was inside the prophet and we got to have that same character being manifested inside of us so you're gonna go through some trials you're gonna go through some temptation but you have to be ready as a junction to make the right decision amen watch with satan to raise up his two when our heaven turns loose all hell turns loose and it's prophesied that there be a janison james on the earth in the last days who would almost impersonate the real thing so close it'll deceive the very elect if possible see we're looking for all of that all right now i'm i'm slipping down a man here because we talked about there was brother branham brought out in scripture he said he looked in scripture he found seven different junctions and uh one of them was noah in the ark another was moses and the children of israel uh the third he says abraham and lot now uh when you look at that amen uh according to scripture the story of abraham actually came before you know the story of moses all right but this you know so we don't we're not necessarily listening to the junctions chronolog chronologically we're just saying the seven junctions all right and i but i'm preaching it the same way the prophet brought it right so so we got knowing the ark moses and the children of israel abraham and lots that was another junction the fourth junction he says elijah in the 450 prophets of baal the fifth junction he said jesus came at the fifth junction so the first coming of christ would have been the fifth junction glory to god and then he says the sixth junction was martin luther and john wesley now we're gonna have to dig in there and when we get there we will dig a little a little further just to kind of show you uh just even in the book of revelation just when you look at revelation chapter two and when you look at revelation chapter 3 revelation 2 amen was what we would call the open door to the false vine amen and and brother branham said that the false violence had their revival first it's all laid out in revelation 2 where the false vine went into the dark ages and it looked like the church was lost it looked like things was hopeless it looked like the church wouldn't be able to live through a condition like that but all of a sudden here comes luther nailing his 95 thesis to the catholic church door and light began to come sprout up a little bit life began to come back forth and when you look at revelation 3 you can see the restoration work has begun till we get to the end where god sends a prophet hallelujah and restores everything that was lost in the in the previous ages we're going to see that so martin luther and john wesley was the sixth junction and brother branham said the seventh junction will be the second coming of christ now we're gonna we're gonna take our time and get into all of that but uh you know just i was just writing some notes on that and just kind of thinking about it because there was a prophet that was sent to every junction yeah and and the second coming of christ we know that there was a prophet sent but i i have to you know just preserve a little bit of that because i want to i want to see how the bride types and some of that because the bride is supposed to prophesy again amen hallelujah we'll get there we're not there today but we'll get there can i go back and just touch a little bit on the first junction this was a quote that would share a man in our brother's chat group and and uh you know and and and uh i was just blessed when brother solomon put this out there and this is coming out of a junction of time paragraph e16 and this is talking about that first junction in noah's day noah a man hamming away building that ark even though everybody else did not see what he saw his family didn't see what he saw they didn't understand his vision but he yet stayed true to what god showed him in that first junction that shows that we're gonna have to have the same type of determination even when people don't understand why we make the decisions that we're making why we do what we do but we got to be just like noah keep hammering away amen my daddy told me son if you hit the rock and you keep hitting the rock say one day the rock gonna break praise the lord so we want to just keep hitting church amen now here um in that in that in that and there's a number of things that i i could say here let me just see if i just brought in the notes when we look at the days of noah uh there was a great building programs that went on a lot of building and and we see that right now i was saying sharing some brothers it used to be where we're having church at right now this was way out of town where we live that on the east side like this was way out of time i mean man you you in the middle of nowhere now it's becoming the heart of the city great building programs right people multiply on the face of the earth uh also as the people multiply sin and wickedness multiply hallelujah brother branham said sin and wickedness set in men's hearts begin to wax coal from god amen and this is another thing that just kind of struck me in the days of noah there was little to no repentance little to no repentance you want to know how hard it is to have a altar call i mean you know that the the spirit of god is moving in the church and you know god then spoke to some people but they refused to move from their seats right if this is not the days of noah all over again i don't know what it is man back in billy graham's day he didn't have to say much for people to go to the altar but now you can preach one of the most powerful sermons where you know god is moving on the hearts of the people nobody moves to go to the altar we are back in the days of noah again all them years of preaching couldn't get nobody to come on the ark nobody nobody out the city wanted to go in that arc the only only only people that the man could get was his own family and now today our families fight against us if this ain't the days of noah i don't know what it is [Music] hallelujah brother branham said god's calling for another zeal and saying that's a zeal to cry i am wrong be zealous to say i'm wrong be zealous to repent in the days of noah there was a lot of violence in the land i was driving down the street a few weeks ago and um you know and you know they they they things gonna change there too i know it's gonna change you know some some of y'all have guns but you know they're gonna be coming for them they're gonna be coming for you i'm just letting you know that and you know but you know these fellas they they were supposed to be at a gun show and selling guns but now they didn't want to go to gun show they put a big big huge truck on the side of the road when you pass by and they say we got guns for trump i say wait a minute what is this and when i say violence in the land i mean come on church y'all can see it you know whether whether it's somebody being shot by the police or somebody shooting the police violence in the land so bad to one of the things that have never happened people stormed the capitol and people got shot at the capitol right i mean it's just it's violence in the land uncontrollable in what we call lawlessness in the book of judges the bible said that it was like that say every man did what was right in his own eyes they didn't they stopped following the law didn't care who was putting up laws violence in the land afraid to just step out our front door don't know what's gonna happen glory to god who would have thought fights would happen in the streets because somebody voted for somebody else violence in the land church we are we are we're living in the days of prophecy jesus said as it was in the days of noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man amen amen and then he stopped they said as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the coming of sun man i i you know i'm i'm i might one day end up in jail because of preaching like this we had the new president come in and new administration and some of the people he done already promoted and one guy that he put on the team in a very high profile position is is known no nation not nationally known to be a man a transgender guy so one of the reporters is trying to report it's like uh yes sir uh sir can i sir can i ask you this sir he said don't call me sir call me ma'am uh sir right ma'am sir [Applause] now i'm gonna tell you that reporter gonna lose his job but but what did god call you yeah when you were born sir look can i just put it this way your gender is not based on how you feel that's a spirit that's not your gender it's very simple to know what a boy cat and what a girl cat is very simple to know a boy dog and a girl dog it's very simple and a human anatomy to know what a boy is and what a girl is it ain't based on how you feel but see this is this is the days of noah and this is the days of lot all at the same time [Music] just trying to move a little just let us know but this is this is a junction this is this is this and you got to make the right turns at the junction you know and even even when you're taking a stir a turn for the spiritual you have to stand stand for the word of god i'm i'm gonna go as far as say this some of us may get misplaced on our jobs and i i i use the word misplace because i'm saying that you're gonna get another job god gonna make a way god gonna provide when you take your stand amen praise the lord amen all right here i'm going back to this quote uh this lines up with the days of noah e16 says notice uh as noah began to warn the people and preach many of them laughed at him scoffed at him because his message seemed entirely out of reason and today how could people today when they say we got the best doctors in the world we got the best clinics we ever had we got all this that and the other way and why do we need he says listen today we need divine healing worse than we ever needed it he says and as the days go on and on and on so will it be more and more needed it says it'll come to pass after a while that unless a man is sealed with the holy ghost his heart until he's laid himself open to all kinds of things come not not any of those who has the seal of god in their forehead then them tremendous plagues begin to fall we're at the junction the crossroads now now brother random say tremendous plagues will begin to fall in another place they say plagues that they won't have a remedy for and and what was this what was this we had to wait for the remedy people died waiting for the remedy and when a new strand comes what do we do then we keep depending on god the same god that brought us through this one god bring us through the next one amen all right it says notice and see know how he went about warning the people saying there was coming to rain the people didn't even know that they know what the rain meant that that's we take it for granted but in noah's day they had never ever seen rain right that was a you know i i could put it this way that was a new word it wasn't even in the dictionary there was no definition for rain none whatsoever so when noah come out and preach like it's gonna rain then you gotta imagine what the people wait uh right break the word down for us noah we i mean you know we've we've been in school we've been educated we got all this but where'd you get rain from it came from heaven praise god and we're preaching things that people have never heard before in all their life but this message has come from heaven as a warning to the people before the second coming of the lord jesus [Applause] just as they had to listen to noah's message in his day we better listen to the message in our day it'll never rain there's people in the world today after two thousand years of gospel preaching don't know what it means to be born again of the spirit of god they don't know what omnipotence means what that god and this great omnipotent power that can transform a soul from a street to angelic position in god's kingdom as a son and daughter of god they don't understand it they're too uh taken up infatuated with the things of the world glaring flirting with the world so many people doing that glaring and flirting with the world praise god we got some sampsons out there amen samson sam says stop running out to delilah don't women like her because you already had an experience with a woman like her they are trying to destroy you sampson but god raised you up to destroy them oh good god almighty okay now let me just let me jump in this brother quaker was sharing his testimony with me i'm gonna come back to that saying that uh uh brother branham had gone to a restaurant to eat him and some other brothers they were sitting there um eating and saying when when the waitress would come brother brandon would always just drop his head keep his head down every time she came over he just put his head down look at the at the menu or look at something like this he always just keep his head down see but the other brother when the waitress come he put his head up and he looked at the waitress and you know whatever says now after they left that that that that that restaurant um the brother that put his head up snuck around and went go back to the restaurant to get to know this sister you know what i'm saying yeah and uh you know brother random had already saw what was going to happen but he just kept his head down right so then the uh so the brother got wrapped up in a relationship that he should not have been involved in right an adulterous relationship and here he uh he so finally gets to the point where he wants to repent so he come back to brother brown and say brother branham i got something to say i'm sorry say uh say what is it brother say you know i you know remember when went to that restaurant and you know that that waitress i said he said yeah brother i knew about it he said remember we was at that restaurant if you notice i kept my head down rather than lifting my head up he said because i knew that lady had an adulterous spirit on her and if i would have looked on the eye i would be the one in your condition say but i had to put my head down what i'm telling y'all there's some things that y'all gonna have to there there are some posts out there on the web right oh and social media you're gonna have to don't get yourself involved in it right you got you got to be very careful because the devil is sneaky [Applause] don't flirt with the world samson flirted with the world and he got himself in all kinds of trouble yeah all right he says uh infatuated with the things of the world glaring flirting with the world and don't realize that that's an evil spirit and a great marking signpost for the people of this day to watch and be ready jesus said when these things begin to come to pass lift up your head your redemption's drawn now not only that but god showed signs through enoch he showed signs through noah and the world laughed at it but one day there come a thundering lightning there come fire out of heaven and a lightning and thunders began to roar that was a miracle in itself and rain began to fall it goes on but here is the great miracle it says the miracle was of how god had his believing child tucked away in the ark of safety so when you're looking for miraculous things that happen sometimes we with the simple things that are happening are the great things i say the simple things are the great things this simple thing of them these few believers tucked into a spot amen that while uh destruction was at hand they was protected that was the miracle and i want to tell you why the structures all around these there's a group of people that's been protected that's a great miracle it says god had his believing child tucked away in the ark of safety all the time the thunder was going on the rain was falling noah was resting the ark of god predestinated for ordained to walk into that ark when the plagues was falling noah was at rest and safety who had been laughed at have then entered into the rest those who they laugh and make fun of today because you desire to live a full surrendered life to the lord jesus they don't realize uh they don't realize is you are tucked away under his everlasting arms don't realize that you're resting just as safely as you can be in the omnipotence and nothing nothing can harm you glory to god hallelujah amen we'll leave that there just bringing them noah but now let's start let's strike the second junction and we'll slip down to uh paragraph e19 in the same uh message but moses moses and what happened with the children of israel amen in egypt uh would have been the second junction and um when we when we look at you know what what happened there with moses uh the miraculous took place in that day god allowed moses to come and and uh and speak things into existence uh call for flies and lice and and all this god was the omnipotent power god was moving in moses day god was bringing his people to a place of deliverance god had made a promise in abraham's day that the people would be in that land for roughly 400 years but they would be brought out with a mighty hand and not only that he said that they weren't going to leave the land poor hallelujah but they would actually be rich as they were leaving land and when the children of israel start leaving you know leaving egypt they borrow from the egyptians they borrow gold and they burn all these things and and and the bible said they borrowed it but i can tell you this much they were never going to give it back amen amen they weren't going to give it back god wanted to make sure that they that the promise was secured to them if not only are you not only going to leave each other but you're not going to leave egypt poor right i hope you get that i mean some of us have gone through some things in our life amen but god sees everything that you've gone through and god is willing to make a way out of no way for you he said you're gonna leave but you won't leave paul oh glory to god glory to god amen if i'm getting ready to walk on streets ago i might as well enjoy some of some things while i'm here that's where i'm getting ready to go you know they're they're they're uh uh you know we would look in this daily bible study that i do you know we're looking at some of the the material that's in the city some of these gems are gems that we don't see in the earth today some of these gems are not gems that you see so many things i mean god described like but where have you seen that so some things that we're going to have that we you know eyes have not seen ears have not heard what god has in store for those that love him church i'm on the expectation i won't leave paul amen amen amen amen i won't leave paul that's my revelation anyway amen amen amen i'm not that i'm putting it all on my own money it's not it's not uh uh what they call that uh prosperity teaching amen it's just a prosperity thought but it's not prosperity all right but in the days of moses uh and pharaoh pharaoh had a question there in exodus five one and two and let's just maybe pick up a couple of these scriptures and and we'll we'll bring these out exodus five one and two uh the bible amen declares this praise the lord says and afterward moses and aaron went in and told pharaoh thus saith the lord god of israel let my people go that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness verse two it says and pharaoh said who is the lord that i should obey his voice to let israel go and look at pharaoh he's a he's a rough fellow i know not the lord since i don't know him neither will i let israel go i'ma tell you god had to make a man like pharaoh god had to design a man like this in order to release these types of words out of his mouth and what we find is that like brother whisper told us god has to make a dirty man for a dirty purpose hallelujah and it's some it's going to be some some dirty folk that show up in your life but remember god let a dirty man a dirty woman be made for a dirty purpose pharaoh wanted to know who was the lord who is this you know i don't i don't know the lord you you're telling me the lord said i don't even know the lord and neither am i gonna let his people go man that's some ru that's rough that's rough they hear something like that but you know as we as we read and you know these other scriptures here uh you know i i i give me exodus seven one and two you know as we read in other scriptures we won't read all this every time a plague was dropped on egypt pharaoh got to know the lord [Applause] he didn't know the lord before but every time a plague dropped [Music] and when his magicians could not get rid of the plagues that's when pharaoh got to know the lord see the miraculous took place omnipotence was speaking amen every time a plague dropped now i need you to understand it was omnipotence hiding himself in moses it wasn't moses doing this on his own but it was omnipotence veiled in moses i want to tell you something omnipotence is also veiled inside of you [Applause] oh glory to god i i just i got i got a bit before i before i go to uh uh seven uh uh chapter seven verse one let me slip back to uh chapter six and verse verse one exodus six i want you to see this is god in in in in moses god and moses give me just a little bit of your time glory to god here in exodus 6 and verse 1 says then the lord said unto moses now shalt thou see what i will do to pharaoh but with a strong hand shall he let them go and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land verse two it says and god speaking to moses said unto him i am the lord so moses knew who the lord was pharaoh didn't know him because pharaoh had not had an experience with it see when you have experience then you can tell people who he is glory to god verse 3 says this and i appeared unto abraham unto isaac and unto jacob by the name of god almighty but by my name jehovah was i not known was i not known to them see so so um if i could just kind of break into that god needed other attributes released out of him yeah so god had to allow a certain situation amen to exist in the earth so that he can see that attribute express see y'all don't know me about jehovah you know you know me by god almighty but you don't know me by jehovah right i want you to know me as jehovah gyra so in order for you for for you to know me as jehovah jireh your bills might have to get a little tight you're going to be trying to figure out how things going to get worked out but when jehovah jairus steps in come on somebody then you know him as jehovah maybe your body might get a little sick but you haven't understood him as jehovah rapha lord's your healer so he allows that sickness to attack your body so he can make a way out of nowhere and he becomes jehovah rapha hallelujah glory to god maybe amen you were so wrapped in sin that you didn't think you could ever be righteous but you realize that he provided his righteousness for you then you understood him as jehovah tits canoe come on somebody and if you ever been in trouble didn't know how you was gonna get out of the fight come on somebody he had to surround you it may look like i'm surrounded but i'm surrounded by you he had to come to your rescue so you can get to know him as jehovah neesee maybe some of y'all been having some sleepless nights didn't know how you was gonna go to bed that night couldn't get no peace but then you begin to understand him when he gave you sleep that night he became jehovah's summer [Applause] thank you actually i gave him the wrong title he was jehovah shalom when they gave you peace he gave he was jehovah shalom but when you ever felt alone felt lonely you needed a presence you got the presence jehovah shaman amen god he had to prove himself as jehovah he had to have a situation there so he could a man demonstrate these attributes and he's doing the same thing in your situation let me read this quote out of the message adoption amen glory glory glory glory hallelujah this message out of the uh uh this this quote says but in genesis 2 when he made man he said i am [Music] y-a-h-u-j-u-v-u-h yahuwah jehovah what did it mean he says i am the all-existent one who has created something off of myself i ain't i'm not junk i'm telling you that right now i was created all for gods i know who my father is right it says i am the all-existent one who has created something off of myself to be a son of mine or a temporary or an amateur little one of mine you mean i can be a temporary on this earth i can be a temporary one well i am going to be a temporary glory to god he said he says uh a temporary or amateur little one of mine oh glory why he gave man jehovah means that he gave man to be an amateur god that's what jehovah means we need to know him as jehovah he gave man to be an image of god because he is father god and he made man an amateur god so he isn't self existence anymore he exists with his family the jesus in me loves the jesus in you it's so easy easy to love amen says he made man in him to god so he uh he isn't self-existent anymore he exists with his his family amen eli eli elohim now he is jehovah jehovah meaning the one who exists with his family now god made man to predominate over all the earth god made man to dominate pre-dominated waldos he had dominion and the earth was man's dominion is that scripture then if that's his domain he was god over the earth he could speak and it would be so he could speak this and it would be so there he is god jehovah the one who once existed in self-existence but now exists with his family and his little ones with him there you are he wants to be known as jehovah but not just a man in those seven compound titles that i gave you he wants to be in you expressed as jehovah sometimes situations will present themselves and and god wants you to take control of it realize when you know you know the the the the prophet told us that when the weakest christian right hits their knees all hell began to shake so sometimes news be coming at you and just be rattling what the devil trying to get you to do is not hit your knees but if you would just hit your knees that that don't mean if you call this person and i don't mind you can call me but i want you to know that you also have the same power and authority that i have you can drive a devil out with one simple prayer it's not what you say is how you say it from your heart the only thing i'll tell you whatever you ask just ask it in his name always put in the name of jesus don't be like the fell at the inauguration and they does everybody think they something who is this man that come up with amen amen and a woman where is that in the bible [Music] call yourself a preacher get up there and you just i mean you sold out christ for something like that and now you got to write your speeches i mean write these prayers down write them down because they got to go over them before you actually said you don't want me to pray in the name of jesus don't invite me i i ain't saying in in in your son's name in in your holy name your beauty i'm going to use the name and then in the name of your holy magnificent almighty son alvin alpha omega the lord jesus christ [Applause] the people afraid to use the name when they get in trouble they ain't got no problem using the name but when they try to impress people they don't want to use the name of jesus no in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray just pray in his name because he say whatever you ask in my name i'll give it to you so i'm going to tell you prayer is going to be coming so fast you're going to have time to call nobody but as the prayers are coming that fast the testimony is also coming that fast my did i hear the testimony from a little niece mama just sent me a text say you know she's not feeling well in the stomach she just she afraid she gonna miss church and i was telling some saints about you last night kennedy i'ma just brag on youth just for a little bit i was telling some things i'd say my my my niece is adamant about coming to church i mean and i'm i'm talking about seven she's seven or eight just turned eight my my niece be figuring out ways that she can get here [Music] all on and out of her own mind nobody telling her she said okay you're gonna get your hair done on this day okay okay okay she start calculating all right if i got to get my hat done on that day then i'm gonna need to get it done by this time because i got to be at church [Applause] i think typically typically it's saturday is the day she get her hair done well she knew that we was having a saturday night service a few weeks ago and she'd say saturday i get my hat done but saturday there's church i'm gonna tell you i'm i'm i'm gonna put it this way her testimony gonna be judgment to other folks god had a kennedy in your midst that would do everything she moved everything to get to church and what you doing she said i got i said she said church on uh on thursday i mean on saturday all right all right friday can you do my hand on friday because if you can't i'ma have to go like this [Applause] she come here with an expectation every service and and it ain't see this this is see when we was coming along can i just talk a little bit i'm i got to come back to my subject but but when we was coming on my mama had to make us come to church but when the tide turned for mama because of the seeds that she sold in her children now she see one of her grandchildren she ain't got a makeup come actually the grand trial make the grandma come [Applause] that's what happened when god turned the table amen just be faithful to god amen glory to god i don't know where i was i lost myself here i lost myself here but that's all right god knows all things uh i was let me just drop this about about moses then i i'm gonna slip out of this i gotta change gears amen uh for the day and now i'm gonna go a little over time just so y'all know i thought for sure y'all praise god we're going to overtime glory [Applause] i mean at a football game of basketball high five and over time um we read exodus 5 1-2 exodus 7 1-2 i want to read that really quick it wasn't moses it wasn't him that was doing this jehovah that was in moses that did these things and that same jehovah wants to live in you to manifest himself in this hour in exodus 7 verse 1 it says um this and the lord said unto moses see i have made thee a god to pharaoh and aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet verse 2 he says thou shalt speak all that i command thee so this was not moses speakingness when when a fly came it was god telling moses call for flies it wasn't like moses calling for life is god telling moses what to do god inspired moses but he still made moses the the he says i'ma make you a god to pharaoh and i'm gonna make your brother your prophet that's powerful since then shalt uh then then shall thou shalt speak all that i command thee and aaron thy brother shall speak unto pharaoh that he send the children of israel out of his land and i'm just i'm gonna just drop something here real quick when moses got to leave in egypt right and they were they were on the way out and pharaoh's army had been you know i mean decimated pretty much by everything that was happening but yet there was enough to still try to fight the children of israel so here they come chasing him and caught him at the red sea right now when moses got to the red sea god had already been telling moses say this say that say this say that and what it was it was a training process oh y'all ain't with me yet when moses when god was telling him say this said that that was a training process he needed to know that god was already in him and that whatever he spoke was gonna come to pass so by the time he got to the red sea god didn't tell him this come on somebody but he said the egyptians that you've seen today you will see them no more forever god didn't tell moses to say that but because he said it god had to back it up there might be some things you will speak on the inspiration but because you said it god gonna have to back it up [Applause] glory to god moses called for frogs lice flies locusts that was all the spoken word of god moses knew him as jehovah moses demonstrated the power to bind and loose moses did all these things uh i'm just gonna have to skip some of my notes here but uh but the one thing that we do know amen that according to exodus nine and five and six let's pull that up nine five and six it was still one moses even though moses might have uh said the egyptians that you've seen today yes he said it but it wasn't moses doing it omnipotence was in moses doing all this how do we know that exodus nine five and six look at this it says uh and the lord appointed a set time so god's saying i mean this thing gonna be over god got a set time right the lord upon a set time saying tomorrow the lord shall do this thing in the land and look at this the next verse it says and the lord did that thing on the morrow i'm telling you the lord god do that thing all over again hallelujah all the cattle of egypt died but of the cattle the children of israel died not one church i'm expecting for the lord to do that thing all over again it's not it's it's not us doing this god doing it in us all right all right all right let me just read this last quote out of the papa's vision these are things that happened at the second junction a turn glory to god took place in amen and one of the big things that happened there in the days of moses which i don't have time to go into but the biggest one of the big things that they had to apply the blood of the lamb on the door yeah the token had to be applied and today it represents being filled with the baptism of the holy ghost now the uh brother jason watkins made the statement this morning and i was blessed by say the baptist holy ghost don't just come just for you to have a good feeling uh just for you to speak in tongues or you know just for you to interpret you know that's that's not the those are secondary reasons but the primary reason that the holy ghost comes is so that you can walk in all truth that's the primary reason the holy ghost came because when he the holy ghost comes he will lead you and guide you to truth all truth that's the primary purpose of having the holy ghost so you can walk in truth for your day not just a hiccup messiah a honda prelude no that ain't it that's good but that ain't it all right um patma's vision i want to just read this amen cut every obstacle from human beings that they might be connected like in the garden of eden i mean i was gonna choke it but i'm gonna say it and i'm so glad the prophet decided to say it man is omnipotent why because you cut from the same cloth man is omnipotent that means all powerful right man is man is omnipotent you don't believe that but he is a man fully surrendered to god is omnipotent amen hallelujah then he said in mark 11 22 whatsoever things you say and don't doubt in your heart it'll come to pass you can have what you said now can i just inject a little something notice what the quotes say you it doesn't say what you can have what you say the quote actually said you can have what you that mean you don't already spoke some things amen hallelujah and you can have what you already done spoke amen you can have what you said what happens when two omnipotents meet when god and man comes together through omnipotence something's got to shake whatsoever you say with that creative power of omnipotence of god knowing that he's promised it and he said it in his word it creates a power that goes out young and brings things to pass things that is not it makes them as though they are because two omnipotents have met there he stands oh isn't he wonderful i say yes he is wonderful wonderful wonderful jesus is to me amen now bringing it to a close but i wanted to just share something here in acts 2 peter's referring back to joelle 2. brother ramsey notice how it's put in the second chapter of acts and in the second chapter of joel god just you know confirming some things but in acts 2 it says um we read verse 17 i believe it shall come to pass the last day saith god i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and i was when i when i i was trying to not figure it out but you know i was i was trying to understand the prophet when he took this scripture to preach on junctions yeah it just i'm like wow where you get junctions out of that but that's the scripture that the lord gave him to preach on these seven junctions so i'm using this scripture it's gonna be our foundation because that's what the prophet used and there was a purpose that he would use that it's not nothing don't happen by accident about chance hallelujah see he talked about the omnipotence he talked about the miraculous talk about the spirit of he talked about all this and we see this as a promise for this day right it says so and it should come to pass in the last day said god i will pour out of my spirit upon flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and all my servants and all my handmaids i will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy glory to god so um at the beginning of the year the lord just kind of put in my my spirit to uh for us to just talk on the subject of dreams and i took the first two wednesdays and actually this was a sermon that i had from last year but i was in a i was can i put it this way i was in a vision i stepped into a vision and i just kept preaching about stepping to the vision and i i i was in a series of sermons and i just wanted to stay there but god had given me this on dreams and i'm like i know i need to share this with the church i'm just kind of waiting on the right time and you know a lot of things was happening at that time i was getting dreams from everywhere you know but i'm like i i'ma share with the church and one time i shared it with a particular person say look they're sharing a dream with me saying now do it this way for me i want to hear the dream but i got a certain way that i'm kind of doing things the lord has led me to do things say you know we got we got people with the gift of discernment that's gonna look over that dream and pray over that dream and then i'm gonna talk it over with them and we're gonna see what the lord say i said just just just do it that way for me but please you know i don't mind listening but you gotta understand as a pastor there's a lot of things going through this head a lot going through and and i know your dream important i know it is i can't comprehend it all right you know how much information just flying through every day you get a text just coming through a prayer request and not only just the prayer because of church people send you prayer requests from all over the world your phone never stop pray for this pray for that okay okay okay okay we'll stop and pray right now amen i got the prayer the prayer request i just father touch kennedy in the name of jesus that's all i can say that's always needed but uh but but you know things just come like that so we have to set up a certain order we had a junction right so we're you know and and at a junction you know the the the the stop sign is put there so that people don't run into each other right the stop light is to control the traffic at the junction and you have to have brother zion came and told us that we needed these three things right he said he said you needed the joyous where you just do whatever you want to do right you say but then you go to ethical stage he said that's when structure rules and regulations come in he's saying when you get through that now you can go to the next level he said which is spiritual and he said when you get to the spiritual level now you can take a leap of faith but someone's taking a leap of faith without going through structure you preach it so i you know i say this is just the way we want to do it now i weighed it to the lord just kind of gave me all the things and i heard brother troy use a quote i said okay that's a quote that i want to use and and it was out of church order and maybe i'll read this real quick and then i'm gonna go into something y'all don't mind right i'll tell you just a little over time today but it'll be all right church order this has come out of church order it says now may the lord bless you all and i trust that this will be carried out to the very best of your knowledge and may the lord may the holy spirit watch over each one of you and may every officer of the church feel his post of duty knowing this that god is going to hold you responsible for how you held your office i'm going to tell y'all something i take my office seriously because i know god gonna hold me responsible right it says that in every and may every officer of the church feel this post of duty knowing this that god is going to hold you responsible how you held your office in the church each one will have to give an account he says unto the laity and the dear gifted saints that's in our church those who prophesy or speak in tongues or interpret or have revelations brother rahm say you can have revelation and ain't going to be higher than your pastor but you can have revelations all right amen say you don't have revelations we are just so happy to have you in the service i say the same thing the problem i'm so happy to have gifted people but i'm gonna tell you who the who the devil like to attack gifted people the devil really attacks gifted folk you got to watch out for a gift amen the devil attacked moses with his gift right the devil even brother branham when i gave you that example a little earlier he was being attacked that was a trap hit how how was he gonna use the gift that god gave him see so so so here you know he says um uh we're just so happy to have you in the service and we will give you full cooperation and everything that the holy spirit shall prove not the stuff that you prove we talk about the stuff that the holy ghost proves and the way that the holy ghost approve it is he has spirit the spirit of discernment is that all right he says um he says uh and and and uh uh shall prove as he said to you and we love you we we welcome you we love you and we believe that these gifts are in you we actually believe you got a gift amen and if you have a right opportunity that means every opportunity ain't gonna be the right opportunity but if you have a right opportunity and a scripturally presentation of it that you will make great workers and i miss don't be trying to use this to to do something on your own well just let's bring the body together amen you say may the lord bless you all is my sister prayer now i talked this a man uh just two weeks ago in and and after i taught it i got five different dreams that came through five what does five represent grace five different dreams came by uh three different people what's three okay we can see god in this so i'm taking the church and i'm putting you right now back in acts 2 verse 15 through 21. and it shall come to pass in the last days says god i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh of your sons that's verse 17 your sons and daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men should dream dreams and all my servants and on my hand means i will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy so i'm taking us back and i'm placing the church at the junction inside the scripture first tree now i'll tell you this also the way that these dreams came the way that i'm reading to you are not the exact way that they came but the holy spirit through discernment had me put it in this order okay i had a dream early this week in it we seem to be at another church you and i were getting ready to go into the church and you were telling me that they wanted me to sing and they wanted three songs for me i was flustered because it was unexpected and now this dream is just that simple right and uh and i told y'all that every dreamer god deals with dreamers differently just like he does with uh ministers differently praise god he deals with singers differently everybody can't sing the same song your voice made for something else y'all stay with me right so so so it just said that i was uh um uh when this came back to the sister that shared this with me i made a comment that i was gonna be going to um uh brother paul's church i think next uh not next month but in march and i was gonna be i was actually saying three songs when i made that announcement the dream came back to the system so she shared it with me and uh now i it was three songs in the dream and she was flustered because it was unexpected amen now the rest of these dreams were also unexpected but i told you three songs but i told you three different people gave five dreams unexpected all right y'all stay with me the next dream brother had a dream and stated that there were about 15 saints from the church assembled but not at our specific church now wait a minute i keep hearing this not at our specific church in these dreams there's some gear and change of destruction as the saints were fellowshipping he noticed one of the sisters would stand in line and she had a bump you know that mean this sister was pregnant now when you see a woman in a dream you have to think church but also sometimes you see a woman in a dream it's for that specific person you don't know what they're going through so the dream said i saw the sister with a bump amen and uh and she was expecting so you know we look at these things both naturally and spiritually i believe it's for that sister now you don't need to know who the sister is just know that before it happens the dream was shared amen praise the lord amen and i believe also that the church is expecting amen we believe that the church is also expecting great things will come forth in this season all right third uh the the uh the third dream says i had a dream and then this dream we were in church didn't seem like it was our present building we were in worship and i looked at a distance from me and noticed that my daughter had come in and was getting settled in her seat now this meant something because a daughter don't necessarily come to church so this is a dream of restoration let's go on hallelujah says i noticed that my daughter had come in and was getting settled now notice it was unexpected for that daughter to be coming in to sit in that seat it was unexpected but yet it was being manifested hallelujah glory i'm going to just share some other things god gonna do some unexpected things in this season things that you have already been praying for god getting ready to do some unexpected things right it says uh uh i looked at looked the distance from from me and noticed that my daughter had come in and was getting settled in her seat my heart was overjoyed but i didn't go over to her as we continued in worship i turned around to find that she had moved to the seat right behind me and embraced me tightly she had not come with a husband but had driven by herself after attending her church and leaving disappointed after the service i followed her home and stayed there talked with her don't know where her home was but this was different home all right we're expecting restoration and we're also expecting a different home since i dream i left home and somehow ended up in africa no one knew i was going i wanted to get back home i i went to a brother and sister's house to figure out how i could get back home it says uh and once i realized i could not get home i text back to say i won't be in church i then met a sister whom i know but i don't remember who she was she said she was going to church so i decided to go with her when we got there she went in and i noticed it was like a convention i walked in and saw brother jack and we spoke i did not know he was there servants was about to start and the choir was getting ready to sing assisting the cry again to praise god and everyone in the convention started to worship i was at a table getting ready to eat a piece of bread and then brother wesco walked over to me and looked at me with surprise i said you didn't know i was here huh he said no with surprise i asked him he wanted a piece of bread and he said yes i cut the bread and held up the pieces for him to choose which one he wanted he chose his piece and began to walk off and as he as he did he stumbled and stumbled a little and disappeared into a room i was worried about him so i began to look into the different rules for him when i found him he was sitting at a desk preparing to speak i asked him are you okay he said yes i said are you really okay he said yes but it comes and goes but i'll be okay and i woke up after that hallelujah now uh as i'm speaking these uh different dreams and i know some of some of us like you know what this mean that to me this mean that me that's fine i'm not here to debate any of that right i believe god is using this to speak to us hallelujah and i'm not going some of this i'm not going to put an interpretation on i'm just sharing with you the dream i know something spiritual to it but i'm just sharing with you the dream and this last one was his brother and his family were in a car riding with someone else driving you notice the black cloud ahead and realized had the driver made the turn the black cloud would have been right over the top of he and his family he says he stayed he stated that the driver rather than making a turn see i say sometimes you got to know whether to make a turn or whether to go forward when you get at a roundabout you got to know which which decision to make he said the driver you know rather than make the turn he went forward and by going forward this allowed him to steer clear of the storm sometimes we get to a situation we want to turn around go forward praise the lord amen now god has sent this and and this is where i just want to drop this because as i was just sharing this with you know a few that i feel like the lord has given us to to to help us with these things uh we were just kind of discussing and one of the things that came up is that uh we had tongues and interpretation in the church recently in the church now we just had three different people share a total of five dreams this confirms that god is moving in our midst amen and and what i want to ask of the church remain spiritual remain sensitive to the spirit don't allow the enemy just to kind of come in and cause all kinds of things we got to be watched with this because he wants to he wants to get in there and mess up something and and and i'm i'm i'm saying follow the instruction that we gave when it comes to sharing this please don't leave the church go out to the parking lot you know the lord gave me don't do that we trying to keep order we welcome the gifts that's why i read them because i want to let you know we welcome it and i believe at this time with three coming from i mean uh three different people having five different dreams i believe god's speaking to us through i believe it has both a natural and a spiritual meaning some of the natural things like you know and in this last one you know you got to be careful what decisions you make as a church we got to be careful what decisions we make if we make the wrong turn it could be destruction a black cloud represents death and it could be spiritual death not natural death but the wrong turn can cause spiritual death in somebody's life hallelujah so god could be saying just just keep going straight the lord is i was telling somebody you know and you know there's a lot that that we can we can look at but uh i'm gonna just put it like this i i'm not focused and i can't be focused on anything else but spirit and truth tabernacle that's where my attention is but i know god is doing other things and we're just watching god but you can i can i said this earlier all of us here at spirit and truth we came here because we hit a junction i hit a junction i i'm just talking about myself i hit a junction and when uh on wednesday i mean on friday night when we come to the business meeting i'll share more with you you know on that you know how did this church get started how did this get started right what happened here you need to know the story the history of your own church but the reason i'm here is because i hit a junction there was a there was a a turn that i had to make in my life and i can look back now and say god has blessed and vindicated the term you all have the same experiences same you come to the same conclusions and i can tell you god has already blessed and vindicated your terms they're going to do more church this is a critical hour it's a serious hour it's a lot to be expecting expect the unexpected say that again expect the unexpected i believe family's going to be restored i i believe that [Applause] don't be surprised you're sitting here in somebody i ain't even know you expect the unexpected somebody getting tired of watching online and you know and people do watch you'll be surprised that he'll be watching us like how you know about the service they know everything can tell you what happened i didn't think you believe this no more it's because you can't get away from it right i mean you think if somebody don't believe it they would just cut ties at least that's the way i would be i'm cutting ties with it but no people still connected why because they was never disconnected [Music] amen amen church be on the expectation god bless you amen [Applause] praise the lord let's just have a word of prayer lord jesus we are mindful of your very presence your anointing that is in this room to destroy the yoke of the enemy mindful that you are in our midst that you are moving lord just a few months ago you let us experience a very powerful service here and brother quaker just brought it back to our attention on last week lord and helped us to see lord just how just even the people that you chose to speak through god had significance and father um as you've led us to just kind of talk on the subject of dreams and god immediately after that
