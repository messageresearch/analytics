before the foundation of the world and no demon no devil knows it and know nothing considering from your hands Lord father as they are going to be experienced Lord let them come to see the other side as they have gone through the negatives Lord have gone through the wall there's nothing in the world Lord but in crisis everything to gain Lord Jesus Christ bless our precious pastor father brother Jack in Haiti for bless a pressure brother Jerry and it's why father as they go through this wedding Lord God let the Holy Ghost be the centerpiece lot far less than for the bind them together as one

founded on Christ you to reign in Christ you to bring glory to your name it will be a blessing to your son say your minister coming up Lord you Father commit all of us into and Sloan up their prevalence to glory for your name they're sick set the captive free and for a brief for the portion of eternity you have for this hour we love you we bless you in Jesus Christ we pray amen praise be to God shall we give a clap or no to up shall we be seated the Lord is with God bless you brothers and sisters for the songs amen the Lord blesses the Lord as his ministry is a different fold sometimes we think about the preachers but every one of us has a role to play amen when I see my sisters and brothers singing I see eternity reigning a man is a portion of Christ it's a portion of the word that comes in the form of songs and music to lift us up amen sometime you could be down but when you hear just one song from Zion it lifts your spirit from solo from defeat into glory into joy into blessing into the celestial dimension so god bless you sisters and brothers for what you do for the Lord we appreciate you amen we want to just talk a little bit on the power of prayer the overcomers to the power of prayer the overcomers - amen the Lord gave us so many tools to overcome the world that we live in he gave us the word the word is himself now within the word that's a portion let me use a family in a family we have the head of the family the husband we have their queen or we have the backbone of the family the mother we have got a children we have got maybe seven we've got different ones who play different rules with what may be the one who drives maybe not everybody drives in their family maybe only the father drives only one of the kids drive only the the mother drives so each and every one play a role the father can be the head of the family but now without a mother the family is not complete we're not eight children the family is not complete so each and every one has a role to play amen many a time we look at the kingdom of God as Jesus who died on Calvary 2,000 years ago praise God without him we wouldn't be here so he is the centerpiece now but is what portion which is the wife which is you and I which is important just as Jesus on Calvary because Jesus on Calvary has finished what was supposed to do on Kaveri but there's a part of part of the drama that has to be played by you there's part of the redemption story that as we unfold by you has been unfolded by you amen do you know you are also a messiah do you know you are Christ so you also said to redeem amen you mono redeem or the people in the on the planet but you might redeem your family you might not redeem or be proven in West Palm Beach Megara has put maybe to 310 for 1400 whatever and I or umbrella the umbrella of the Holy Ghost in you not you as a human being you can do nothin even for yourself you can read you couldn't redeem yourself but there's something new Christ in you is the Redeemer amen so Christ in you is doing the rhythm is doing a redemptive work just as Jesus Christ on Calvary did is portion even when his children were crucifying him he prefer them as a father the one who see me forgive them for they don't know what they are doing amen there might be some people time I crucify you the map is on who dama BIA gives you but you prefer them that Lord forgive them they have not sinned Eid and their message yet if they see who they are they will of the kingdom of God Amen so you have been set as a redeemer and your family to bring those that are under your umbrella on to cry Jesus amen some of us might not be sitting here may not be pretty had I not been a messiah that God put in a family to pray for us to teach us the Word of God amen let me use myself for example when I was coming up as a child my mother was my role model my dad used to cite scriptures but it wasn't that of much of a prayer person he proved over over food and stuff like that but my mother was a prayer warrior in the family so my mother could will kneel down we had a little Hoffman head of Christ that picture and we pray we just got around it in three that said me as a beginning of my Christian life I don't remember the same oath about that way preach but I remember the phrase that I pray with my mother amen so my mother was a redeemer for me until my bro took over my brother knew the word of the Lord a message of William Branham so the Lord lifts us from this brain to something higher than praise Amen with a wait we through a preen but a lot added something more to it so through your prayer something that you are desiring God will add it to it for you amen so prayer is the most important to God give it to to my let's look at some scriptures and just say the basis glory hallelujah let's look at James chapter 5 the story of Elisha you want to read where men of God preached and a lot answer shall we be enough it if we can James chapter 5 let's start from verse 13 to about 18 James chapter 5 13 to 18 praise be to God right so James 5:13 to 18 is that is there any among you afflicted let him pray is anyone here afflicted are you going to some affliction happily most of us right and if you don't you don't have any affliction then before you even stand in a better position pray for somebody who's been afflicted if you don't have nothing to worry about everything is cool and cozy and rosy for you OhLaLa fred wanna see all allah proof for somebody else come and join me come and join brother Troy join your sister some way so is that is there any one among you afflicted let him free or let her free is any merry let him sing Sam's is any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord and the prayer of faith I want you to know that prayer of faith pray with faith amen private revelation don't look at the situation look at the Christ in you amen and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord raised him up and if he has committed sins they shall be forgiven him glory hallelujah confess your faults one to another when you have something in you that is blocking your prayer confess it to the Lord if you've done something against somebody confess it to the Lord there's nothing God cannot forgive you God can forgive you and your brother you're stuck and forgive you everyone for another that you may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much seventeen Alliance which is Elijah was as a man subject to like passions as we are Elijah had fought and mystic he was Moody person and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on earth by the space of three years and six months and he prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the earth brought forth her fruits amen shall we end over the father may you add blessing to the reading of your word shall we be seated the power of prayer we want to look at some scriptures and how God use men of God and women of God to bless to change situation Elijah was a human being just like you maybe you couldn't say like I said prophet God walk with Him or closely to him maybe then he was with me so that's why God had his prayer he could tell the rain the ho he wasn't in the clouds he didn't physically good to stop the hydrogen and the oxygen to stop the affirmation of water and Klaus but it's put their way through praise and what is life the what is Christ Jesus the way that is in you is not a word of a human being you can talk one side as a human being you can eat as a human being you can play as a human being you can do certain things as a human being but there's somebody in you if you have the Holy Ghost in you Christ in you is not just a human being but it's attended himself amen so when the situation's that you need to speak you need to pray then it's not your human side speaking it is Christ's side who is bringing for the attribute of the word M prayer and when you pray regardless of the condition it is not your way it is Christ himself amen and Christ will bring his way to pass in your life in your praise so when they light up read that let it not be rain for three three years an hour and half there was no rain in the land of Israel Anto Elijah prayed again Lord let it rains fall and the rain fall amen the element of this earth is under your control if you can see your position that you are Atena amen if you have Christ on the inside of you you have the creative portion of God in you you can speak into creation and you can speak this out of creation glory hallelujah I think there was a testimony of a prayer warrior once inste in Colombia that she prayed for her cousin my cousin had a cancer and she preached was good have a surgery tomb or something like that to do surgery and remove the cancer or to mow when she prayed I think they do take a couple of days she has a cousin how was how did he go he said I didn't have to do the surgeries at why so the doctors couldn't find a cancer they couldn't find a trace of it so they didn't have to do that cancer she's the sister is not a prophet she's not a brother she's not a preacher she's not ready jack is not a quick who's not a Troy but she just say her sister but there's something on the inside of her the same Christ that was in Jesus 2,000 years ago the same cried that was in John Wesley some years ago the same cried that was in william brangham years ago the same pricing but a jack but Abela troy the same but i can't the same crisis in you amen and when you know your position who you are that you are a lot of cardio a christ in a feminist form all of us a feminist portion of christ amen Christ is our head the body is the female portion so that's what we call a sub right or wife of Christ or we are the Queen of Heaven amen Christ is the king the Holy Ghost is the king and with a vessel the temple the tabernacle is the flesh that Monaco's the omnipotent amen so knowing your position that is when you can pray by faith if you don't you can be have the courage to Bree you give in to the situation that there's nothing going to nothing's going to happen this disease has killed all my ancestors come my grandmother it come my grandfather so there is come i mom it's call my dad I there's no way I can come out of it because you don't know who you are so you believe what the devil tells you you believe what the situation tells you but if you know who you wanna Hey I am NOT just quick cool crack whizz assistant element here he is a 5 foot 11 guy but as somebody on the inside this antenna you can't be here and can be there amen and what is the situation that you need to speak is not this guy but as somebody on the inside the one in sticks is ready and amen glory hallelujah the same thing for you sisters amen you might be a sister you might not be the richest person on the planet you might not even be recognized by nobody but there's something on the inside of you that is eternal that is Jesus Christ that when you speak it's not you sister where is no your sister or the sisters here is Jesus Christ in you that is speaking and when you speak your word is he an amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen glory well known blessed be the name of the Lord amen glory hallelujah blessed be the Lord the Lord is good amen is good the power of prayer amen the Lord is good he is good let's just look at some things here before you go forward the Lord is good I want us to look at a weapon that God give to overcome situations the power of prayer the weapon of the overcomer or the victress weapon is a paw of prayer now let's look are we ready Elijah right Elijah let's look at a little called Hannah in the Bible so let's go to 1st Samuel because you might say oh brother I'm not a prophet how can I have that power like Elijah I'm not brother Jack how can I pray and customers I'm not a quick walk and I preach how can I do this no the same power is in you amen the same power in Jesus Christ a great one who's put this working into existence is in you my sister and when we recognize who we are nothing can stand before us amen because the victory is not coming from the skies the victory is in you the kingdom of God is in the heart of men and women amen the kingdom of God is not strong is not effective what is in some dimension some way by one day cannot descend in the Sistine element of your flesh then the kingdom begin to have effectiveness on the earth amen so let's look at Hannah First Samuel Chapter 1 praise be to God the Lord is good let's look at a woman that the Lord Freya's got two portions is got a Tunde yoosu and a rip in time so let's look at Hannah's situation First Samuel Chapter 1 I'll be jumping back and forth so forgive me because a lot I can't read Tom wouldn't permit us to read I wish we can read verse 1 to the whole the whole of it but it's a lot so first summer chapter 1 now chapter 1 verse 1 let's read a verse phase phase now there was a certain a certain man of Ramat Rama's Safin of mount ephraim and his name was al cana the son of Jarrow ham the son of le who the son of to who the son of zeus and every sight he was from the tribe of ephraim and he had two wives the name of one of his wife was hannah and the name of the other was pnina pnina had children but hannah had no children I want you to take notes now is the negative contrast amen Hannah the other rival who has children and she had no children let's see why and verse 3 and this man went up out of his City yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the Lord of hosts in Shiloh and the two sons of Eli hophni and Phinehas the priests of the Lord were they and when that time was and when the time was that a kind of offered he give to pnina his portion his wife and to all his sons and her daughters portions but on to Hana he gave a wedding portion for he loved Hannah but the Lord had shut up him amen sometimes we give we blame the devil for certain things yes the devil does it but a lot give him permission to do it for a purpose so don't let s give glorified don't let us glorify the devil let us give glory to God amen the Bible said I think Isaiah chapter 5 someway said and the Lord I create evil and do good idolo to orphans amen the lot is the one that created the devil so the Lord does all of them good and evil so the Lord does only good the Lord good and evil he does it so I mean you use it as an instrument to do some evil to bring some negative to shut a room of Hannah and I were to be a model that you could go to the hospital you know what there's no chance for you've got this fibroid in the room you've got this one so maybe you can adopt maybe you can get a cat or dog and maybe use the dog as your daughter or your child or whatever the dog can inherit you know not Hannah amen she knew her position amen so yes so that was the negative contrast now let's go let's go on and verse verse 6 and her adversary also provoked a saw for to make her fret because the Lord has shut up a wound so the Lord does it and as in this he did sue year by year when she went up to the house of the Lord so she provoked her therefore she wept and did not eat then said conahey husband onto her onto Anna why we passed down and ye tests are not and why is thine heart grieved am I not better than better to live than ten sons the other interns don't nobody can help you your husband might love you to the core he might love you to help from heaven and earth but the in a situation he can you be not be the answer your wife will love you to death your children can love you to death but there's a situation the answer lies on the inside the God on the inside of

it for you I can do this you that is laughs amen eternal life is living for others Jesus Christ didn't live for himself he said he might be nothing he wasn't a human being let me split this no way I'm going in but let me keep going in Jesus Christ when he was on earth when he knew he was going to die for us even when Peter tried to stand in his way Lord are you going to die you are do not this miracle your ministry so agreed you can die you have to I mean keep this ministry you know and Allah said no that is sit and sit and get behind me because its purpose is to do the will of the Father in him so when it was about time for him to go he went through struggles he was preening garden of gethsemane right the twelve hour of his life was horrible his was sweating blood have you sweated blood before no blood was coming out of his sweat see the agony was going through the painful death he's you consider dimension when certain trials come the lot of repeated that trash for you to know that this trial is coming we all go through it it's so tacky why Lord why me why don't you take the strap for me but a lot of that you can bear it amen so Jesus praise the Lord if it's your wall let this cup pass over me he could come and NGOs he could speak and mankind would be changed but that was not the route he also got through suffering so I want you and I asked suffering he can feel in his blood he can feel in the selected dimension so he went to the suffering human form not in angelic form an angelic form is put last rose come up from the grief that was easy that was just a coup that was a good deal that wasn't a rout this time he was a full-blooded human being full-blooded mama like you and I he was going through pain painful depend I was going through child pain and the Lord he said not my war but your war not all of the flesh but all of the father that lives in me and the Bible said that angels came to minister to him Moses and Elijah whereas a Lord if you don't go to Kaveri all of us are doomed right from Adam to the last son of yours all of us are doomed that that I was going to ruin the hood the whole creation and it's a lot get up and go to Kaveri so look at

grief you saw in pain just like childbirth when a woman is gonna have a child is not a fun they go through pain you don't even know what I gonna make it or not because some people die in delivering children they die and a baby dies so also not a baby dies so it's a life-and-death issue by yes women I have that collision brief I mean courage to go and good I mean conceive children and deliver children because without them they will be no preacher they'll be no prophet will be no presidents there will be nobody on this earth God gives our ministry to them and God has given ministry a

six is a sewing in tears I can even see it's a can somebody read for me okay it's right here let us sow in tears shall reap in joy amen he that goeth forth and weepeth bearing precious seed shall

children you are suing for your loved ones who you've seen something they have not seen the picture and they are running away from the picture the enemy has blinded them from the picture they don't

for whom story before the church amen for your brother and as you keep swimming in tears you are going to remember a good rip in rejoicing amen Hannah stood in tears by the ripple rejoicing esta let's

King's house over against the king's house and the King sat upon sat upon his royal throne in royal house over against the gate of the house and it was so when the King saw Esther the Queen standing in the court that she obtained favor in his sight and they keen held out to Esther the golden skepta that was in his hand so as that junior and touched the top of the Skepta they said the King onto a what-what withou Queen Esther and what is thy request I want you to put yourself in this place what then set a keen on to her what would thou Queen Esther and what is that petition thy request it shall be given thee today to the half of the kingdom Amen I want you to know this part mark it down your request your petition even if you want half of the konami to be given to you amen what are that mean when the Lord was teachin is people her to free he taught them not to pray our Father was in heaven and he said that as it is in heaven so he shall be on earth so heavenly part is settled already

have to pay bills no they don't pay bills in the other side to funnies don't pay bills no they don't pay taxes they don't do tax refund they don't go to school but now the flashiest in element has to feed has to have clues how to raise children has to do things at least things that we need and that is a half of the kingdom that Eston eat amen how many Queen Esther's are here we all can ask this we have idli need from the Lord amen whatever you need maybe Esther's need was to they were having persecution against the Jews and they needed akin to protect them because Haman has started persecuting the Jews they want to estimate the Jews get rid of all the Jews so esta and Hank omaticaya were standing in the gap for the whole of the Jewish people sometime we could take one person in the family to bring all the family to Christ remember I said that you are a messiah you are Christ you are omnipotent and when you recognize who you are situations will come under your control you don't have to fight you don't have to box you don't have to take again you don't have to fight but just go on your knees and pray amen as simple as ABC just transfer your problems to the king of heaven and you've been the queen of this queen of heaven on earth your king your husband Jesus Christ who lives in your heart will answer your petition what do you need half the kingdom whatever adlet is that you desire when you pray believe that you receive and you shall receive them amen what about prayer is faith God because we are not just ordinary human beings just like kids you don't you don't kiss a kiss oh you just hand things over to them because they don't know better but I want to get adult you cook you put a food that you serve them you put a mini prawns around them sometimes even feed them when they are under certain age they can feed themselves you feed your children but as the children grow you teach them how to use spoon how to use your hands to eat you tell them how to take things from the refrigerator you tell them even how to the girls how to operate the stove because they are going to be an adult they are going to be and they are going to be wives they are going to be mothers and so forth the same thing is the spiritual dimension the Lord sometimes gives us Indian twists right take it you don't have to breathe through your mother through your father through your parents you get a certain age you see that the difficulties are setting in you have to make choices for yourself your friends all your friends are going this route all your friends have got boyfriends

Jesus Christ I'm concentrated on to the Lord it doesn't matter if the whole world or the people on the planet billions good this route I am going right to Jesus Christ amen if everybody give up on God I will stand for the Lord amen if everybody falls seek the church I will stand for the church amen I will be on the loss despised for you so when you take that decision and you three the Lord knows that you have an earthly need they have the kingdom it will be given to you amen that is the portion that God has got for the Queen Esther's praise be to God let's look at em let's because Matthew chapter 6 verse 9 to 13 the Lost prayer Matthew 6:9 and 13 if we can project it on the ball on the screen Matthew sees and said after this manner therefore pray our Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven right there give us this day our daily bread God knows you need deliberate now the kingdom is already settled in heaven before the foundation of the world Samuel is meant for Hannah Hannah didn't know nothing about it so on earth Hannah didn't know everything on earth you don't have everything you have a need but then you

three weeks now God can do something for you that would be a Bible to that person your friend amen that's why we need to write our testimonies our prayers our Thanksgiving the inspiration the Lord gives it you write them in your prayer book and it reminds you when the trouble comes that all sit and you can have which over me you under my foot amen the Lord is the one who close my womb is no you and I grounded a lot to open my womb the Lord is the one who shut it off against me the Lord has got seven and eight other doors open for me somewhere I only need to discover those those Amen when one door is closed here God already has another door before you but you have to preyas you gonna discover new sprays and do say doors open for you if you don't free when I stand here and cry over the door that I've been Kalu's he's been shot it's not it's not going to change but as you pray the Lord keep you you don't even know the Lord bring you to this position and you don't know the laws bring you here oh wow that's oh thank you thank you Lord you have opened a door for me oh I never knew praise be to God and that's what a lot does for us amen through their prayers little bit some time it doesn't open all at once you produce a little leeway you step into it and you keep praying Oh somebody let me I don't have money I don't know this guy I've been in the neighborhood for three years she's never we don't even know but she brought me food for my children oh the Lord is the Lord and you keep praying you had a letter in the mail some money from no way you overpaid something $1500 Wow Lord this is your hands and you keep praying and then your rent is being paid somebody pay for it you don't even know who paid for it or there's some something happen $1,200 pay your rent that's exactly what you need and Allah give you a job within two is record a job and a job is even paying twice more than your previous job because what you prayed because what you prayed because you fasted because you trusted the Lord and cause you to the weapon or prayer and utilize this amen if you don't utilize that weapon is not is useless why do you buy a vehicle and put in a garage for 20 years is of no use you might as well not buy the vehicle if you buy it and you have to put it on the route and use it for movement amen so the prayer is our weapon praise be to God let's look at a couple of adults other ones let's look at mark 11 20 24 and 25 mark 11:24 25 when you pray pray with faith that a lot has already answered your prayer and you see your prayer can we can we project it on the board for us Mike 11 I think okay Mike 11 24 therefore I say unto you whatsoever things that you desire how many have desires in their heart is anybody have a desire that you want a lot to do for you okay now let's go on what what Stratton's are you desire when you pray believe that you receive them I want you to soak it in what sort whatsoever things or whatever you desire when you pray believe that ye receive them or you have already how even go back you have already received them and ye shall have them amen remember that your desire is already answered in Cilicia dimension heaven when I say having to look to the skies look to your heart the heart is crying out of for can you lend me your Bible please thank you the heart is crying for this Bible the Bible is already there for you it might not be physically in your hands but as you have desire in your heart I need Bible to read I'm a new Christian I've never read Bible before I went to better just church and they talk about something in my heart I need a Bible but I don't have money to buy a Bible and ask you free as you pray out maybe the next time you come to church the pasta or a brother or sister welcome to church you can have this Bible and read it wow you didn't have money to buy a Bible but as you prayed as you desire the Lord welcome brother who's we work on sister Berry's work on somebody to buy you a Bible certain things will come from your prayer is not come from your labor certain things you pray and you live as well to get it but a certain things that you pray the Lord one knowing somebody somewhere to do for you delivering so all the Levi you need to do is your praise a and so when you pray believe cousin time we pray and we don't believe it's a prince preacher principle when you prefer something do look at the situation God made the situation that for a purpose Luke and Hannah he whom has been closed if it were to be did a lot I said that you can have your infant ah you are sterile your husband is sterile you can have children for such and such and such reason and Hannah was past age she wasn't a young young lady she was an older lady a temper ramming one visit mention a age I don't remember but Hannah wasn't a young lady but she had she didn't look at the situation she knew that I'm a creator the critter lives in me I'm a son of the Messiah MMS ayah amen I'm a son of King Jesus I'm the one that is representing here the low close my womb for a purpose but I'm not going to be barren forever so she prayed as she preached the Holy Ghost in Hell was Keenan the Holy Ghost was bringing as desperation amen and then she move it to the temple to three because blood always want to line you up where your blessing is amen your blessing will exchange could be in the author right here your blessing we come in there we're coming from the pastor's mouth and when you come and hear it and you receive it that let it be on to me you already got your blessing amen so the Lord has a place to bless you the Lord Allah bless you had a drinking bar the Lord will not bless you when you're sitting home and listen about and watching TV the Lord will not bless when you don't come to church but when you come to church and hear they're worried because what is already in you it means that what is half and half remember the idiot Indian Indian laundry when you make your laundry when they came to you as they didn't know how to read and write so the only way to run their laundry businesses when they give you you bring your clothes they give you a prophetic cut in a certain way so when you come for you to identify that is from but a caliph they don't have like computers we have now they have you have a piece of a piece so that the trip is up to dovetail when it dovetails then it's for you you take your clothing and go away so it's half and half you got the Lord has got 1/2 which is in the celestial dimension and you your prayer and your weight has the other half the two house has too much God want to give you the blessing but Duprey if I know steadfast in the word of the Lord your blessing is today's in your heart you deserve to have their Bible it's in your heart you can't go over it always is you're in your mind when you go to sleep I need a Bible I need a lot to do this for my family I need to do this and if this happened in certain way it's in your heart you can get it with God want you to have it but you have to believe do what believe and you pray in faith you pray with all your heart I don't care about conditions I'm speaking with person you speak the dimensions Krishna's to take care of the rest amen blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus Christ God has put elements on earth water here and here fire and other elements the other yeah they came from you and I you don't have to pray about what goes on in the world you don't have to worry about Russia you want to worry about Putin what do you call it an order watch China and the US no you don't have to fear those atomic weapons no before any bomb would drop you already broke in this element into pieces and moving on amen before any disaster will strike the Lord has already done it for you in Haiti that said a minister in Haiti and there was add in two thousand eight or ten that was the earthquake ten thank you so during a Haitian earthquake she I said they don't have much so she gave us a house story a school rada and he gave the story to this to smaller sisters to live live there and they were seen the story building going this way and away right before them people were dying in so the sisters wanted to jump from the story and the pastor said sister stay right that don't jump and he said earthquake I command you stop and the earthquake stopped for a while it begin to even be more aggressive the house was moving and SSS one that resisted stay right there and the earthquake in the name of Jesus I command you to stop and the earthquake earthquake start none of them not even one sister none of them parish what is 100 are random did but the Lord the pasta is a human being but it's a date in him and this is his sister's his judgment base he was a savvy she was a Silvia at that time for them he was Jesus Christ to them and his weight has to be a creation has to go for to stop the earthquake earthquake is coming from under different different things physics and chemistry Anderson terrific can explain but there was so the earthquake has to obey its master amen just like Jesus on the on the river when the devil brought a storm and his book and the storm ceased the same street is in you so when pistache I think Shadrach Charles when he spoke to the earthquake that earthquake I command you in the name of Jesus Christ obey me this is Jesus Christ speaking this is a modern day Jesus Christ amen now what is the skies in the east in government but it might be Jesus Christ in shed or in skates or in dress and his spoke and creation obeyed him and the earthquake stopped amen that power is in you and that part comes to prayer let's look at one character less really good from here if you can I want to learn this really a bit about Susanna Wesley the mother of John Wesley you mothers and sisters how to I wanted to make it as a part of your life to inculcate in the children about the Word of God about power of prayer amen so let's read something about a John Wesley's mom Susanna Wesley if you can go to the message 55 208 10 e Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever blessed be the Lord you subscribe the same yesterday today and forever more okay okay a message at 5:00 208 10 e d subscribe the same yesterday today and forever more paragraph Lam read from paragraph 15 this shot said now my brand was given a prayer cut and was insulting the people so now we are just going to pray for the sick I'm not here to entertain as I see I'm here to pray for the sick there's no greater power in the world than prayer do you believe that there's no greater power in the world than prayer the greatest power they'll all give it to his sons and daughters is what prayer I mean I live in then go to a lemon read another another listen to emphasize let's read a the hand of the Lord came upon me five four oh four OH three the hand of the Lord they may see the hand of the Lord came upon me let's read paragraph 14 Ramos talking about Jehoshaphat when he made a wrong alliance with a hub it was an ungodly person you better watch who you work with amen if you don't work with the word somebody who want to take you as tree from the word then you're gonna go as tree so Jewish effort was a believer true believer buddy walk align himself with the wrong king whose wife was just a bell didn't want nothing to do with the Lord they were idol worshipers and I plant himself in a situation but because it was a believer when he prayed a lot had his prayers who is that another thing as soon as Joseph had ordinary now if we would have prayed over the subject would have thought about it face God what must I do but being you with unbelievers he to the oblivious way and that's the way many spirit-filled Christians after revival fall because they give themselves up amongst people that said well I go to church we ask good as the rest of them and you lose your experience still right in the road no matter what the rest of them does you know where you belong you know who you belong to still right under the power of prayer all the time still another power of prayer all the time don't let them call you off to something else in amusement there's no harm in it it has a question don't do it stay away from it amen stay Ana down on the pole prayer now let's see a Susanna Wesley John Wesley's mom let's see how the Lord used this room and let's look at the message influence 6363 11:14 Susanna Wesley was say I think she came from a family of 25 she would her parents have 25 children and now she and her husband husband was a preacher they had 19 children John Wesley was their 15th but let's see how this woman even artificial like is COO of our own a children was like a class it's even bigger than his Cruz you know I've taught before I've had a class of 910 and class of 20 but this one had a class of 19 which is quite a number to deal with boys and girls somewhere somewhere kids so is that I think of Susanna Wesley I think she had 17 years on messages a 19 when you go to if you read is 19 sometimes it's 1970 but I think it's 19 I think that's right but she found two hours or more every day to pray she prayed three hours every day with 19 kids so how did she do it she didn't have a technology to to entertain the children she didn't have a children's something to kind of entertain this one's to have a cell phone to give them to play video games okay you deny yahoos can play video games and this ones can do this as I pray as I cook no she didn't have any of any of those things but said she found two or more hours to pray every day down at the end of address with a lot of children what a little boy is not around out of their produce at John and it John and a Charles Charles that chat sorry that changed the course of the world save the world in that day she didn't have a washing machine and a dryer as we have today a dishwasher and so forth or a meet she didn't she did it all herself but yet she found she find time because she was putting on in to some children that finally changed the course of the world I think that is the old-fashioned mother the old-fashioned home where prayer and understanding of the Bible is amen that is what we as mothers we ask fathers we ask brothers we have to inculcate inculcate in our life frist because you can give something that you don't have when you have it then you can give it to others if you don't pray how you going to tell your child to pray the product the church will induce appear in spring the don't see plain prints is all about job and making money so how are they trained go to learn how to free but when they print is good this city friends will kneel down and pray or the city parents pray over food on table or parents I pray and other children also to pray then the children eat you might not see but indirectly without use not noticing you are in call kitchen you I planted something in this children and they gonna grow up with it they can run away from amen let me read a little bit about this room one that is a Philadelphian Church age the messenger the message the messenger to the age was without doubt John Wesley John Wesley was born at Epworth June 1770 no three that was like maybe foreigner years back or 300 and was one of the nineteenth one of the nineteenth nineteen children born to Samuel and Susanna Wesley his father was a chaplain in the Church of England but it was more than likely that the religious chain of John's mind was based upon more upon his mother's exemplary life than upon his father's theology I like this one here is what I was a preacher but Brahma see that his influence was not done by from his father but it was exemplary prayer life got the life of his mother that is where he pick his influence that's why the Lord used to bless him and I said like for me my mother was my influence when it comes to prayer amen so what you are planting in your child today you don't know that you do not know for you do our gift of God to you and God place them in your hands to train them when the time comes a lot is going to be called a children from you to use them door tests or sons God is going to make
