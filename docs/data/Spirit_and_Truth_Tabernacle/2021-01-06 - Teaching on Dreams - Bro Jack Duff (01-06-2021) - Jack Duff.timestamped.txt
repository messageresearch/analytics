[1:35] tonight that you would just reveal
[1:37] yourself to us through your word that
[1:38] you'd help us lord
[1:40] to see what it is that you want us to
[1:42] see
[1:44] in god that we would just align
[1:45] ourselves
[1:47] accordingly and father um
[1:50] just want to also whisper a prayer
[1:54] for our nation and all the things that
[1:57] are going on here
[1:58] in our nation and god i pray that you
[2:00] just keep
[2:01] your people covered you would um um
[2:04] keep them under the cover of your wings
[2:07] that no evil
[2:08] would come their way and uh lord we uh
[2:11] we know that we're citizens of
[2:12] another kingdom and lord you are our
[2:14] king you are
[2:15] our lord you are our master you are
[2:18] our leader and we thank you for that god
[2:21] so help us lord jesus just to navigate
[2:24] in these troublesome times in which we
[2:26] all live
[2:27] lord we're looking for for today that
[2:29] you will come for us
[2:31] and now take us home now our prayer is
[2:34] just as john prayed at the
[2:36] end of the book of revelation even so
[2:39] come
[2:39] lord jesus so father we just pray
[2:41] tonight as we come
[2:43] and gather here that you would just
[2:44] minister to all of our hearts in jesus
[2:46] name
[2:47] we pray amen amen uh i want to go to
[2:51] the book of acts and um
[2:55] we'll read and um start at verse 15
[2:59] this is the verse that we actually read
[3:02] on sunday and um
[3:06] i wanted to just uh uh read this again
[3:11] as we uh just get started in this
[3:13] teaching
[3:14] uh tonight teaching on dreams
[3:18] here in acts 2 verse 15 it says
[3:22] for these are not drunken as ye suppose
[3:26] seeing it is but the third hour of the
[3:28] day
[3:29] but this is that which was spoken by the
[3:32] prophet
[3:33] joel and it shall come to pass in the
[3:37] last days saith god
[3:39] i will pour out of my spirit
[3:42] upon all flesh and your sons and your
[3:46] daughters
[3:47] shall prophesy and your young men shall
[3:50] see visions
[3:51] and your old men shall dream dreams
[3:55] now we want to make that clear as uh is
[3:57] these are not the only people
[3:59] that would dream dreams uh are the old
[4:02] men
[4:02] uh but what we hear what we gather from
[4:04] the scriptures that god
[4:06] will use dreams now god will use
[4:09] prophecy god will use all of those
[4:11] things uh in these last days so this is
[4:14] something that we should look forward to
[4:16] in the body of christ it says verse 18
[4:18] and all my servants
[4:20] and on my handmaidens i will pour out
[4:23] uh in those days of my spirit and they
[4:26] shall prophesy and i will shall wonders
[4:29] in the heaven
[4:30] in heaven above and signs in the earth
[4:32] beneath blood and fire
[4:34] and vapor of smoke the sun shall be
[4:36] turned into darkness
[4:38] and the moon into blood before that
[4:41] great and
[4:42] notable day of the lord come and it
[4:44] shall come to pass that whosoever shall
[4:47] call on the name of the lord
[4:48] shall be saved so thank god for his word
[4:53] my first quote is going to come out of
[4:55] the message
[4:56] moses um i have it listed there on the
[4:59] on the page
[5:00] and as we're just getting that prepared
[5:03] i wanted to
[5:04] first just start off by saying when
[5:06] we're talking on this subject i realize
[5:08] that this is what we would consider a
[5:10] delicate
[5:10] uh subject especially if you're gifted
[5:13] in this area
[5:15] this could be a delicate subject and uh
[5:17] you know i do understand that
[5:20] but i also want to say that i really
[5:22] believe that god
[5:23] uses dreams and he uses visions
[5:27] according to scripture according to joel
[5:30] 2
[5:30] what we read in acts 2 is actually a
[5:32] fulfillment
[5:34] of what joel to spake
[5:37] and um you know so joel 2 speaks it and
[5:40] prophesies it
[5:41] and then acts 2 as a fulfillment but
[5:43] what joel 2
[5:44] said is that in the last days so what
[5:47] was fulfilled
[5:49] at pentecost is still being fulfilled
[5:52] uh even today i mean even today so we
[5:55] have to be very careful uh we don't want
[5:57] to have
[5:57] a um an approach where we don't welcome
[6:01] gifts no we
[6:02] welcome gifts in this body
[6:05] we welcome gifts there's just a certain
[6:07] way things must be
[6:08] done in order for god to be glorified
[6:12] all right so uh so here we what we're
[6:15] looking to do is
[6:16] try to establish both a scriptural
[6:18] approach
[6:19] and uh even also using uh information
[6:22] from
[6:23] the message you know the prophet has
[6:25] given us very clear instructions so we
[6:27] want to try to bring all those things
[6:29] together
[6:30] as we teach on dreams amen so our first
[6:34] quote is coming out of the message
[6:36] uh moses and the prophet says this he
[6:39] says now
[6:40] um it's to my humble belief that gifts
[6:43] gifts are not handed out you know i
[6:46] forgot to read a scripture
[6:48] um let me hold on one second
[6:52] romans 11 29 i forgot to read that
[6:56] amen romans 11 29.
[7:02] amen all right romans 11
[7:06] 20 11 29 it says this um
[7:10] for the gifts and calling
[7:13] of god are without repentance
[7:17] for the gifts and calling of god are
[7:20] without repentance so
[7:23] uh let's just go now into this quote
[7:25] it'll it'll bring out
[7:26] um that scripture it says now
[7:30] it's to my humble belief that gifts are
[7:32] not handed out
[7:34] with hands amen that that means
[7:37] i can't pray over you and give you a
[7:40] gift
[7:41] especially when it comes to dreams or
[7:43] visions and all that
[7:44] you we don't pray these are things that
[7:46] people are born with
[7:47] amen so to my humble belief that gifts
[7:50] are not handed out with hands
[7:52] gifts are for ordained of god
[7:56] gifts and callings are without
[7:59] repentance so you know oftentimes
[8:01] people have gifts uh before they even
[8:04] come
[8:05] to know the lord like you if you were a
[8:07] dreamer or a person that could see
[8:09] visions i know people that see visions
[8:11] and don't
[8:11] even know jesus praise the lord right
[8:14] don't even know jesus
[8:15] but they see all kind of visions they
[8:17] just be perfectly right
[8:19] right and there are people that could
[8:20] have dreams that don't know the lord
[8:22] that have not surrendered their life to
[8:24] the lord so
[8:24] you know uh gifts and callings are
[8:26] without repentance you know the
[8:28] scripture tells us but brother branham
[8:29] says
[8:30] gifts are for ordained of god gifts and
[8:32] callers are without repentance
[8:34] you can say things and try and make
[8:37] these things
[8:37] act right and believe right and to work
[8:40] right
[8:41] but they are not uh but they are not
[8:43] unless
[8:44] but they are not unless god himself is
[8:46] behind
[8:47] it right so we don't get anything from
[8:49] it unless god himself is behind
[8:52] the gift he said it's nothing it's not
[8:54] nothing you try to bluff
[8:57] a man you can't bluff satan he won't be
[9:00] bluffed you've got to know where you're
[9:02] standing that's right
[9:04] and gifts and callings are without
[9:05] repentance they're born into the world
[9:09] god foresees things and knows his
[9:12] prophecy
[9:13] what's coming to pass and he starts
[9:16] something here to meet it up there
[9:18] and when he's seeing that the time of
[9:19] the people's going to need this he had a
[9:22] little boy born peculiar
[9:24] at birth by the name of moses he was
[9:26] given the name
[9:27] name of moses from pharaoh's daughter
[9:29] because he was taken from the water if
[9:30] you know the bible
[9:31] uh sunday school story of it so you know
[9:34] brother branham's just using the life
[9:36] of moses and saying how that gift was
[9:37] for ordained of god
[9:39] uh god could see certain things but
[9:40] getting ready to come upon the earth
[9:42] certain things given to come upon his
[9:44] people and he ordained the gift to be
[9:46] there to
[9:47] actually help assist the people praise
[9:49] the lord
[9:50] uh if we can catch this a gift is
[9:53] actually that comes to actually help
[9:55] assist
[9:55] god's people amen
[9:59] if we can get that a gift comes to
[10:01] assist
[10:02] a gift does not come to magnify itself
[10:06] but a gift comes to assist the body of
[10:09] christ
[10:10] hallelujah brother branham when he came
[10:12] on the scene what did that do it
[10:14] assisted
[10:15] the body of christ glory to god when god
[10:18] gives you
[10:18] a man a pastor that's to assist you
[10:21] amen god gives you an evangelist that's
[10:24] to
[10:24] assist you and any gift that god gives
[10:28] to the body a teacher
[10:29] you know uh uh you know all the fivefold
[10:32] ministry
[10:33] any of that god uses to assist his
[10:35] people
[10:36] bring the people to perfection right so
[10:38] gifts are are
[10:40] are without repentance but gifts are
[10:42] used once they're surrendered to god
[10:43] they're used to actually
[10:45] help the people they're used to help the
[10:48] people
[10:49] glory to god amen amen amen
[10:53] little um as i i'm a go to this next
[10:56] quote out of palmer worm locust and
[10:57] cankerworm caterpillar
[10:59] uh just something that recently um was
[11:01] shared with me and
[11:02] and and i had to just evaluate this you
[11:05] know brother branham
[11:06] made a statement about um the threefold
[11:09] mystery of christ
[11:10] he says that there was three things that
[11:12] god had in his mind that he wanted to do
[11:14] one he wanted to reveal himself to his
[11:16] people
[11:17] uh two he wanted to have the preeminence
[11:21] in his body of believers and three he
[11:23] wanted to restore the people back to
[11:25] eating conditions again
[11:27] and the minister said his brother eugene
[11:29] braun he said you know what i found in
[11:30] my ministry is that
[11:32] you know um most of my sermons are going
[11:35] to always deal with one of these three
[11:37] folds right whether it's to reveal
[11:41] god to the people whether it's to help
[11:43] people get to a spot where they're
[11:45] allowing god to have the preeminence in
[11:47] them
[11:48] or to just share with them how we're
[11:50] going back to eating conditions again he
[11:52] said most of the time
[11:53] my message is going to always kind of
[11:55] deal with that area
[11:56] glory to god one of those three areas
[11:59] and i think you know when when we look
[12:00] at this
[12:01] because this is what's important to the
[12:02] body of christ you know uh
[12:04] that threefold mystery is what's really
[12:06] important to the body of christ so
[12:07] you know let's go on a little further
[12:09] here amen in uh in this
[12:11] uh he says the palmer worm out of the
[12:13] message pomegranate cankerworm
[12:15] caterpillar
[12:16] he says i've seen a lot i've seen a lot
[12:20] called discernment right so sometimes
[12:24] people
[12:24] think they have discernment but it's not
[12:27] really discernment
[12:28] amen right he said i've seen a lot
[12:31] called discernment i don't believe him
[12:34] he says but i
[12:35] know there's truly a discerning spirit
[12:38] of god
[12:39] he says uh the gift of knowledge
[12:42] that calls and speaks and it's perfect
[12:46] every time now i want to tell you
[12:49] something
[12:50] this is what we're desiring uh that's
[12:53] something that's going to be
[12:54] perfect every time
[12:58] hallelujah you don't want to miss with
[13:00] this you know uh
[13:02] i was um uh sharing with you all
[13:05] you know just uh she told me i could
[13:08] call her name but i don't i don't want
[13:09] to call her name
[13:10] um a relative of mine was just sharing a
[13:13] dream with me that she had and
[13:15] and the dream was saying uh the portals
[13:17] of heaven are open the portals of heaven
[13:18] to open and
[13:19] you know and um you know really didn't
[13:21] take much much to interpret that but
[13:24] you know the the thing of it is is that
[13:26] what i got from is that the portals were
[13:27] open for her
[13:29] right and uh you know because she kept
[13:31] telling people in the dream can't you
[13:33] see the portals are having to open
[13:34] the portals i say yes see see god is
[13:36] showing you that the portals of
[13:38] heaven are open for you so you got to
[13:40] get in wise
[13:41] open you got to get in right and i say
[13:43] but now since you
[13:44] shared it with me praise the lord i'm
[13:47] going to claim that the portals of
[13:49] heaven are open for me
[13:50] because the bible says the secret things
[13:53] belong unto the lord our god but once
[13:56] they
[13:56] are revealed then they belong to us
[13:59] so i'm taking it personally since you
[14:01] gave it to me i'm gonna say the portals
[14:03] are
[14:03] open for me so you know she was uh
[14:06] saying how her pastor also was
[14:08] uh uh giving you know different comments
[14:10] and and everything
[14:12] about this and you know and uh and then
[14:15] um you know from there
[14:16] the pastor went to sharon about some
[14:18] other dreams and you know
[14:19] some of the things that i was listening
[14:20] to i said i don't know if i agree with
[14:22] that
[14:22] you know and and then the pastor went on
[14:24] to kind of say that
[14:26] you know the lord told the pastor that
[14:28] uh it was going to be president trump
[14:31] well when the election went the other
[14:33] way the lord i mean the pastor stayed by
[14:35] stood by the lord told me and then the
[14:38] bishop
[14:38] started going against the pastor
[14:40] hallelujah they husband and wife
[14:43] praise the lord and they start going and
[14:45] the bishops say now they ain't what god
[14:46] told me i'm saying wait a minute
[14:48] we want something that's going to be
[14:50] perfect
[14:52] every time right we don't want we don't
[14:54] want confusion in the body of christ
[14:56] because the bible plainly states that
[14:58] when people get things wrong like that
[15:00] they supposed to be stoned now that's
[15:02] the bible but now
[15:03] my grace is extended today so brother
[15:06] branham say
[15:06] go to the altar and get that evil spirit
[15:10] off of you praise the lord
[15:13] because do you realize that evil spirit
[15:15] can get in the midst
[15:17] of a gift i want you to catch that
[15:22] a evil spirit can get in the midst
[15:25] of a gift that's why it's so important
[15:28] that we
[15:29] align these things according to
[15:30] scripture because we don't want an evil
[15:32] spirit on us now i can tell you
[15:34] real quickly how you how you know you
[15:35] got an evil spirit if you get offended
[15:37] by what i'm saying
[15:39] you got a bad spirit because i'm giving
[15:41] you the words
[15:43] praise the lord all right i'm going on
[15:46] it says this
[15:48] it says uh uh but i know there's
[15:51] truly a discerning spirit of god the
[15:53] gift of knowledge
[15:54] that calls and speaks and is perfect
[15:57] every time he says we're
[15:58] earnestly contending for
[16:01] that amen i almost
[16:05] i i embolded that and wanted to
[16:08] highlight it in my notes we are
[16:09] earnestly contending for that
[16:11] that i mean wears perfect every time
[16:13] look he says that faith that was once
[16:15] delivered to the saints
[16:16] i know there's dreams and and stomach
[16:20] uh and stomachs full of fresh meats are
[16:23] all
[16:23] uh are are or are full of something
[16:26] other another that causes you to have
[16:28] nightmares now
[16:29] think about what he just said
[16:32] you can get your stomach full of
[16:34] something and it'll cause you to have a
[16:36] nightmare
[16:38] amen and you actually think it's coming
[16:40] from god
[16:41] but your stomach was full of something
[16:43] oh my
[16:45] right it says uh uh caused you to have
[16:48] nightmares and you jump up and call it a
[16:50] vision
[16:51] but there's a real genuine vision of god
[16:54] that's right
[16:55] god promised it amen jesus christ the
[16:58] same yesterday today and forever
[17:00] he does that and it never fails the
[17:02] bible says if there
[17:04] be one among you who's spiritual or
[17:05] prophet and let him speak
[17:08] and what he says if it comes to past and
[17:10] hear him
[17:11] for i'm with him if it don't don't
[17:14] hear him amen this is this is this is
[17:18] all right to me
[17:19] i mean uh you say something the lord
[17:20] told you this lord tell you that and
[17:22] that thing don't come to pass the bible
[17:24] tells us not to listen to you
[17:26] amen now that's not that's not uh
[17:29] you know a thing where you know people
[17:31] are disassociating themselves no no the
[17:33] bible says don't listen
[17:35] you can't keep coming up saying the lord
[17:36] said this lord no the last thing did not
[17:39] come to pass
[17:40] now i'm i'ma just be honest with you you
[17:42] know we watched
[17:43] somebody say the lord said this lord
[17:44] said that we start
[17:46] documenting especially you give dates
[17:49] and times
[17:50] we document when did you say that was
[17:52] going to happen praise the lord
[17:54] because when it don't happen now you're
[17:56] looking for ways out of it
[17:58] no and what we just found out that's an
[18:00] evil spirit
[18:01] praise the lord amen look at this he
[18:04] says
[18:04] uh let him speak and what he says if it
[18:07] come to pass and hear him from with him
[18:09] if it don't don't hear him because he's
[18:11] a false prophet
[18:13] god can't lie
[18:16] god tells the truth all the time
[18:20] amen let it be so now we find that
[18:23] that's the truth
[18:24] there's those things right so he goes on
[18:27] in this next quote
[18:28] and i'm just i'm gonna just kind of
[18:30] share a number of things here just to
[18:32] lay our platform
[18:33] uh on this and you know i pray that this
[18:35] be something that you know if there's
[18:37] ever a question you can go back to this
[18:39] tape and
[18:40] listen to it this is how we want to
[18:42] handle things here you know in some
[18:43] churches
[18:44] uh gifts just completely just all just
[18:47] about
[18:47] rule the church praise the lord i might
[18:51] as well just be honest
[18:53] gifts rule the church i know some
[18:56] churches
[18:57] certain people that have a dream a
[18:59] vision or whatever
[19:00] they get up and said before the church
[19:02] and the church just
[19:03] stop everything they're doing because
[19:04] this person said nobody checked it to
[19:06] see
[19:07] if it was accurate nobody praise the
[19:10] lord
[19:10] so you got to have we got to have this
[19:12] thing in order a gift can't run the
[19:14] church
[19:14] and then if that gift if people don't
[19:16] accept that gift
[19:18] amen then they end up leaving the church
[19:20] praise the lord that's the truth in it
[19:22] huh
[19:23] i i i'm telling the truth you know i you
[19:26] all know
[19:26] uh you well i'll i'll tell you maybe you
[19:28] don't know this but
[19:29] the the story i'm going into this uh
[19:32] greater than solomon is here that's my
[19:33] next quote
[19:34] uh but there's a story of a man in the
[19:36] bible he was an advisor to the king
[19:40] his name was a hitherfail and a
[19:42] hitherfail had a tremendous role
[19:45] by being the advisor to the king but uh
[19:47] but one time a hitherfail
[19:49] came out and gave some advice and uh and
[19:52] when he gave the advice
[19:54] um another guy i forget his name he
[19:56] stood up and said no
[19:58] i don't think that's the right advice
[19:59] let's do it this way
[20:01] right and uh and and everybody agreed
[20:03] with the other guy so hitherfail got so
[20:05] offended that people did not accept his
[20:09] gift can i put it that way people did
[20:12] not accept his advice people did not
[20:13] accept his gift that a hitherfail
[20:16] went home and hung his self
[20:19] all because his gift was not accepted
[20:22] now there's something wrong when you
[20:24] when you when you get that
[20:25] upset that you'll leave a church because
[20:28] your dream wasn't accepted
[20:31] hallelujah right amen your vision wasn't
[20:35] accepted
[20:36] amen don't don't allow your your your
[20:38] your
[20:39] your uh your gift to get that high
[20:42] right that it's above the word of god
[20:45] amen
[20:46] look the bible actually tells you that a
[20:48] man's gift
[20:49] makes room for itself so you don't have
[20:53] to get mad about a gift
[20:54] never get mad about a gift never never
[20:57] allow that to happen to you
[20:58] it shows that there's something wrong
[21:00] there all right i'm going further
[21:02] i'm going further praise the lord it
[21:05] says um
[21:07] in this message of greater than solomon
[21:08] is here he says prophets have the word
[21:10] of god
[21:12] and are born the prophet now um and now
[21:15] i'm gonna just tell you some people like
[21:17] to use this quote the wrong way
[21:20] because you know when a prophet don't
[21:22] actually have to have
[21:23] his um his prophecy
[21:26] checked by nobody amen
[21:30] a gift of prophecy has to be checked
[21:33] a gift of prophecy has to go through
[21:35] discernment
[21:36] so what people do to try to bypass
[21:39] discernment
[21:40] they say i was born a prophet
[21:44] praise the lord i'm i know what i'm
[21:46] talking about here tonight
[21:47] they they say i was born a prophet no no
[21:50] no no no no no no no what you're trying
[21:52] to do with that statement
[21:53] is bypass the order that the prophet
[21:55] established for us
[21:57] amen amen amen glory to god
[22:00] prophets have the word of god
[22:03] amen so if you're born a prophet what's
[22:05] the word that's coming forth
[22:07] amen right prophets have the word of god
[22:10] and are born a prophet a gift of
[22:13] prophecy
[22:14] is different that's a gift
[22:18] amen now there's uh nine he said there's
[22:21] five ordained gifts in the church
[22:22] apostles prophets teachers pastors
[22:24] evangelists
[22:25] now that is the five gifts that god
[22:27] places in the church by his for
[22:29] knowledge then there's nine gifts
[22:33] that's locally in the church speaking in
[22:35] tongues
[22:36] interpretation of tongues a gifts of
[22:38] wisdom
[22:39] amen and knowledge and prophecy and so
[22:42] forth
[22:42] them's nine spiritual gifts that
[22:44] operates through the church
[22:46] but there's not five offices that god
[22:48] puts in the church
[22:49] and oh how we love to see them all
[22:51] operating
[22:53] he says one of them is a pastor teacher
[22:56] and those things
[22:57] then the other comes along and
[22:59] confirmation
[23:01] hallelujah so see what what happens
[23:03] first god establishes by giving
[23:06] the fivefold ministry and then the other
[23:08] gifts come along in confirmation
[23:11] to those gifts all right church glory to
[23:14] god
[23:14] hallelujah let me i want to make sure i
[23:17] nail
[23:17] that one down the other gifts come
[23:21] along in confirmation to that gift
[23:24] not to lead that gift
[23:29] praise the lord because people will use
[23:31] their gifts in order to try to lead the
[23:34] pastor
[23:35] that's not the way things are supposed
[23:36] to go it your your gift comes on
[23:39] in confirmation hallelujah
[23:42] i'm reading what the prophet said amen
[23:46] all right it says one of them is pastor
[23:49] teaching those things and
[23:50] i mean even even you can't you you
[23:52] cannot supposed to leave any of the
[23:53] five-fold minister
[23:54] with it with a dreaming gift you're not
[23:57] supposed to do it
[23:58] it's supposed to come and confirm all
[24:00] right
[24:02] he says one of them is a pastor teaching
[24:04] those things then the other comes along
[24:06] in confirmation
[24:07] gifts are to magnify that's what the
[24:10] prophet said
[24:11] gifts are to magnify and god's
[24:14] just got got it so even a fool
[24:17] will not be excused i like that
[24:21] god got it god got the thing so right
[24:23] that even a fool
[24:24] can't be excused from this he says
[24:27] willie it says
[24:28] it's so simple the way god has made them
[24:30] and i like that
[24:31] look at this statement the more simpler
[24:34] you become
[24:36] the greater you'll become before god
[24:40] if you ever want to be exalted make
[24:43] yourself humble
[24:45] hey man make yourself humble if you ever
[24:47] want to be exalted just make yourself
[24:48] humble
[24:50] i can give you all an example just
[24:51] somebody that that's that's that that
[24:53] that
[24:53] that's very humble very humble and and
[24:56] god exalted them
[24:57] in our midst i'm gonna use brother kwaku
[24:59] for an example
[25:00] you all know how brother kwaku came here
[25:02] to the church didn't even know there was
[25:04] a message church here in the area
[25:06] didn't even know happened to see sister
[25:08] amanda in school and had a conversation
[25:11] you know and she told them about the
[25:13] church and brother quake who came and
[25:14] when
[25:15] when he came the brothers uh you know
[25:18] his first time here
[25:19] and and that's what you're supposed to
[25:20] do you you're watching we don't we
[25:22] didn't know brother kwaku
[25:23] so the first time here we don't put
[25:25] people on the front row their first time
[25:26] here
[25:27] they might have a gun right
[25:30] they might shoot the passer right out of
[25:31] the pulpit and you got them on the front
[25:33] row
[25:34] no you don't do that i'm just i'm giving
[25:36] you all the business tonight i'm giving
[25:38] you all the business
[25:39] right i mean you know everything got to
[25:42] be anointed
[25:43] i mean the the you know the the the the
[25:45] people that's in position to watch they
[25:47] got to be anointed they got to know what
[25:48] they doing
[25:50] right so so so you know brother brother
[25:52] quake who come no they didn't put him on
[25:53] the front row they put him right back in
[25:54] the back
[25:55] where everybody can see him but the
[25:57] quick will come the first week sit back
[25:58] there
[25:59] amen the word sit quietly second week
[26:02] come back amen the word
[26:03] but by the third week brother quaker
[26:05] stop making this up
[26:06] to his making himself to making his way
[26:09] toward the front and say i'm a part of
[26:10] this body
[26:11] this what i've been looking for right
[26:13] i'm a part of this body and then from
[26:15] there
[26:15] we didn't even know that he was a
[26:16] preacher sat here for months
[26:18] never even never announced i mean
[26:22] been missionary all over south america
[26:25] and we didn't even know he just amen to
[26:28] the word
[26:29] amen to the word amen just a little
[26:31] conversation that he had with
[26:33] uh i think brother josue and brother
[26:34] jose say what you a minister
[26:37] brother jose called me so quick he said
[26:39] brother jack i say well brother
[26:41] okay all right all right i got in touch
[26:43] with brother quiku right away i said
[26:44] brother
[26:45] on uh new year's eve night we want you
[26:47] to give 15 minutes
[26:49] 15 minutes say we got to preach it that
[26:51] night but just give us 15 minutes just
[26:52] exalted
[26:53] 15 minutes by the way brother quake who
[26:55] came up here exalted in 15 minutes and
[26:57] dropped the mic
[26:58] i said see this is a brother that we can
[27:02] trust
[27:05] see if you humble yourself god will do
[27:08] the exalted
[27:10] hallelujah hallelujah
[27:15] the more simpler you become
[27:19] the greater you'll become before god
[27:23] that's right don't never
[27:26] now that's that's two negative words
[27:29] that's that you
[27:30] according to the english language you're
[27:31] not supposed to use it like that but
[27:34] i think the point actually is driven
[27:36] home even
[27:37] more when we use it like that don't
[27:39] never
[27:41] don't never try to lift
[27:44] yourself up when you do
[27:50] you bring yourself down
[27:54] we're not bringing you down you're doing
[27:55] that to yourself because you're lifting
[27:57] yourself you're bringing yourself down
[27:59] amen he that exalts himself shall be
[28:02] a base that's bible
[28:06] so gifts are to magnify
[28:10] and uh and the first thing i want to i i
[28:12] want to bring in
[28:13] another quote here i want to say this we
[28:16] actually welcome the gifts here at
[28:18] spirit of truth tabernacle gifts are to
[28:20] magnify especially the gift of dreaming
[28:22] that's what we're dealing with tonight
[28:23] and we welcome that gift here at spirit
[28:25] and truth tabernacle
[28:26] brother branham makes a statement here
[28:28] in the message church order
[28:29] and and i thought this was very very
[28:32] appropriate
[28:34] he says now may the lord bless you
[28:37] bless you all uh it says
[28:40] and i trust that this will be carried
[28:43] out to the very
[28:44] best of your knowledge and may the holy
[28:47] spirit watch over each one of you
[28:49] it says and may every officer of the
[28:51] church feel his post
[28:53] of duty knowing this that god is going
[28:56] to hold you responsible
[28:58] for how you held your office in the
[29:00] church now you see that
[29:01] pastor know who you're responsible but
[29:03] god holds you responsible for how you
[29:05] hold your office in the church
[29:06] he says each one will have to give an
[29:09] account
[29:10] amen amen praise the lord
[29:14] each one whatever office you hold in
[29:16] church you have to give an account to
[29:17] god for how you handle
[29:18] what god gave you amen and i
[29:22] and i want to take that further than
[29:23] just people in office i want to see each
[29:25] one of y'all with
[29:26] a gift that god has given you and you're
[29:29] not using it for his glory you'll give
[29:30] an account to god
[29:32] for the gift that he gave you let me go
[29:34] further
[29:35] and to the laity and the dear gifted
[29:38] saints look at that word that he uses
[29:41] the dear gifted saints that's in our
[29:43] church
[29:44] now i'm speaking this i'm i'm borrowing
[29:46] the prophet's words
[29:47] to speak this the spirit and truth
[29:48] tabernacle the gifted saints that's in
[29:50] our church because i believe we got
[29:52] gifted saints right here
[29:54] i believe that and i thank god for the
[29:56] gifted saints
[29:58] amen he says the dear gifted saints
[30:00] that's in our church
[30:01] those who prophesy or speak with tongues
[30:05] or interpret and look at this or have
[30:08] revelations
[30:11] gifted saints can have revelations
[30:13] praise god
[30:14] now we got to watch that too because you
[30:16] know you the prophet did tell us that
[30:18] um you can't live higher than your this
[30:21] revelation
[30:24] the prophet said that amen so sometimes
[30:27] folk want to
[30:27] go a little higher amen especially you
[30:30] know we
[30:31] we drop you know maybe maybe the lord
[30:32] used us to say something in the sermon
[30:34] on
[30:34] on sunday then at the church we get what
[30:36] we call parking lot preaching
[30:39] can i talk about it just for a little
[30:41] bit parking lot preaching and parking
[30:44] lot preachers always trying to show
[30:46] something
[30:47] different than what was just spoken
[30:50] that's the wrong spirit that's the wrong
[30:53] spirit
[30:53] amen hallelujah glory to god
[30:57] uh i before i became a a
[31:01] minister a pastor anything i just
[31:03] fellowship around the word i didn't i
[31:05] never went outside in the parking lot to
[31:06] try to tear down somebody's sermon
[31:08] now if you have to tear somebody else
[31:10] down to build yourself
[31:11] up something wrong
[31:15] amen hallelujah
[31:19] all right he says um or have revelations
[31:22] we have j
[31:23] he said this we are just so happy to
[31:25] have you in the service and i want to
[31:27] say the same thing
[31:28] we're happy to have gifted people in the
[31:31] service
[31:32] he says and we will give you
[31:35] i'm speaking on behalf of spirit and
[31:37] truth tabernacle to gifted people
[31:40] we will give you full cooperation
[31:44] in everything that the holy spirit
[31:47] shall prove i want to make sure we get
[31:51] that on the line
[31:52] the holy ghost got to prove it amen
[31:55] all right everything that the holy
[31:57] spirit shall prove
[31:58] that he has said to you and we love you
[32:02] and we believe that these gifts are in
[32:04] you and if you have a right opportunity
[32:08] and a scripturally presentation of
[32:11] it see all this the right opportunity
[32:14] cause sometimes it's the wrong
[32:15] opportunity i'm gonna get into that a
[32:16] little bit later on
[32:18] sometimes sometimes you don't need to
[32:20] share that
[32:22] you gotta know when to share when not to
[32:23] share praise look
[32:25] sometimes some things are for you and
[32:28] you alone
[32:29] praise the lord so nobody else need to
[32:31] know that that's god speaking directly
[32:34] to you amen right he said he said so so
[32:38] he says
[32:39] uh uh if you have a right opportunity
[32:41] and scripturally
[32:43] presentation of it uh that you will make
[32:46] you will make great workers in our
[32:50] midst and may the lord bless you all is
[32:53] my sincere prayer so i want to say right
[32:55] now that we welcome
[32:56] gifted believers gifts and callings are
[33:00] without repentance
[33:01] we know that but once you become a man a
[33:04] christian and you're
[33:06] surrendered to the lord and god
[33:07] continues to use the gift that he gave
[33:09] that you were born with uh we welcome
[33:11] that here we're welcome it's just a
[33:13] certain way that we think we need to do
[33:15] things
[33:15] that's all that's all we're trying to
[33:17] say we we don't we don't we don't bind
[33:19] it we want to see gifts we want to see
[33:21] them freely used
[33:22] but there's a way that that it must
[33:24] happen it must happen that was got to
[33:26] come that way if it doesn't come that
[33:28] way
[33:28] then we can't use it all right all right
[33:31] so we have a scriptural approach when
[33:33] dealing with this
[33:34] i'm using this message uh uh
[33:36] expectations
[33:38] i'm going here just stay with me i'm
[33:41] gonna certainly take my time on all this
[33:43] tonight and
[33:44] and like i said we'll we may have a part
[33:46] one and part two of this
[33:47] but uh let me just read these quotes it
[33:49] gives us a foundation for how
[33:51] things will be done praise the lord hear
[33:54] the message expectation
[33:56] the prophet says in the old testament
[33:58] there was two ways
[34:00] they had they they have of having a
[34:03] message
[34:03] one of them was by a dreamer it says the
[34:06] other one
[34:07] by a prophet and then they have the urim
[34:10] thummim
[34:11] it says you ministers know what i'm
[34:13] speaking of of the urem
[34:15] urim thummim what's on the breastplate
[34:18] of aaron
[34:19] now if a dreamer dreamed a dream
[34:23] look at this now if a dreamer dreamed a
[34:27] dream
[34:28] and it was told and it didn't flash them
[34:30] lights the lights that was on the urine
[34:32] thumb
[34:33] so you know he tells his dream and if it
[34:35] didn't flash them likes on the urim
[34:36] thumin
[34:37] it wasn't right he says
[34:40] and if a prophet prophesied and the
[34:43] lights didn't flash on the urem thumb
[34:45] it was wrong it says but if it did flash
[34:49] it was right now since the going away of
[34:52] the urim thumb
[34:53] this is what the prophet said god's
[34:55] bible
[34:57] is the urum thummim if a dreamer dreams
[35:00] a dream or a prophet prophesies
[35:02] and it ain't in the word of god what are
[35:05] we supposed to do
[35:07] let it alone if it ain't in the word of
[35:10] god
[35:10] so anytime somebody shared a dream the
[35:12] first thing you
[35:14] thinking about is how does this fit with
[35:16] the word of god
[35:18] if it does not connect with the word of
[35:20] god don't even consider it
[35:22] and what i find oftentimes that people
[35:24] try to put it in the word of god they
[35:26] want to make it fit the word of god
[35:28] no don't do that don't do that i mean i
[35:30] tell you what just share your dream
[35:31] the same way that they would bring it
[35:33] here to the urim thumb the urine thumb
[35:35] is the one that kind of you know that
[35:36] the priests were the one that actually
[35:37] held the urine thermal let me put it
[35:39] that way too
[35:40] the priests are the one that actually
[35:41] held the urine thunder so they brought
[35:43] it before the priest
[35:44] and then they had to flash them praise
[35:46] the lord so
[35:47] what what what we i mean eventually and
[35:49] i'll share this with you but what we
[35:50] want to do
[35:51] if it's something spiritual for the
[35:53] church bring it before the pastor
[35:55] before you take off running with it to
[35:56] everybody else
[36:00] hallelujah bring it before the pastor
[36:02] before you take off running with
[36:03] everybody else
[36:04] amen all right so he says uh
[36:08] god's bible is the euro thunder if a
[36:11] dream of dreams
[36:11] a dream or a prophet prophesied and it
[36:14] ain't in the word of god then let it
[36:15] alone
[36:16] that's right but if it's on here god's
[36:18] speaking
[36:19] that's right this is god's your thumb it
[36:21] is his word
[36:23] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[36:24] word shall not
[36:26] now i want to just kind of go back and
[36:28] and pick up a scripture out of
[36:29] deuteronomy 13
[36:31] uh here you know uh the the prophet
[36:33] tells us clearly
[36:34] that they used the urim thumb to to to
[36:37] determine whether dream was
[36:39] accurate or not whether it came from god
[36:40] or not if it flashed under your thumb
[36:42] if a prophet prophesied and it flashed
[36:44] into your thumbnail if those lights
[36:46] flashed
[36:46] then it was from god if it didn't flash
[36:48] then it wasn't from god and the urine
[36:50] thumb today
[36:51] is the word of god we see how it
[36:53] compares with the word of god
[36:55] amen all right now here in deuteronomy
[36:58] 13
[36:59] verse 1 says if there arise among you a
[37:02] prophet
[37:03] or a dreamer of dreams and giveth thee a
[37:07] sign or a wonder
[37:09] it says in the sign of the wonder come
[37:11] to pass wherever he spake unto thee
[37:13] saying let us go after other gods which
[37:16] thou has not known
[37:17] and let us serve them now look at this
[37:20] the sauna wonder actually comes to pass
[37:23] where they speak unto thee saying let us
[37:25] go after other gods which thou has not
[37:27] known and let us serve them now we
[37:29] already know
[37:30] no matter how supernatural this is this
[37:33] is against the word
[37:35] because they're not supposed to have no
[37:36] other gods before him so no matter how
[37:39] supernatural it is
[37:40] right if it's against the word you do
[37:42] not go after that
[37:44] now here verse 3 says thou shalt not
[37:48] hearken unto the words of that prophet
[37:51] or that dream of dreams for the lord
[37:54] your god proveth you
[37:55] oh what a statement what a statement
[37:59] so sometimes what happened god will
[38:00] allow you to hear things
[38:02] to see how you respond because god wants
[38:05] to prove you
[38:08] see if you'll stay with the word or not
[38:10] are you going to get caught up in the
[38:11] emotion of it
[38:13] no the word must be first
[38:16] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[38:19] word
[38:19] will remain forever look at this it says
[38:22] thou shalt not hearken unto the words of
[38:24] that prophet or that dream of dreams for
[38:25] the lord your god proveth you
[38:28] to know whether you love the lord your
[38:30] god with all your heart
[38:31] and with all your soul so sometimes a
[38:34] gift will come
[38:35] to prove you to see where you stand
[38:39] amen i'ma tell you right now where i
[38:41] stand i stand with
[38:43] the word of god all right
[38:46] so i wrote a note here a dream could be
[38:48] perfectly right
[38:50] but if it leads us away from the word
[38:52] then the dream was a test to see what we
[38:54] would hold to
[38:56] and i will always hold to the word of
[38:58] god and i wrote this in my notes heavens
[39:00] and earth will pass away but my word
[39:02] will remain forever
[39:03] and uh so here's a another statement the
[39:05] prophet said them gifts
[39:06] are given to you not to play with not to
[39:09] say glory to god i speak with tongues
[39:11] hallelujah
[39:12] you're you're degrading yourself when
[39:13] you do things like that you're degrading
[39:15] yourself
[39:15] they're given to you to work with not to
[39:18] play with
[39:19] amen i'm going further if we can get
[39:22] everybody
[39:24] to put the word of god above their gift
[39:28] we will be a blessed and spiritually
[39:30] prosperous
[39:31] church i'm going to say that again if we
[39:34] can get everybody
[39:36] to put the word of god above their gift
[39:40] we will be a blessed and spiritually
[39:45] prosperous church
[39:48] can i say this also every dream
[39:52] is not of god
[39:56] every dream is not of god now let me
[39:59] just read a little bit more for you just
[40:00] to kind of prove these things so every
[40:02] dream is not
[40:03] of god this is coming out of the message
[40:06] of paradox
[40:08] and look at this man sharing his dream
[40:10] with the prophet
[40:11] he says uh let me stop just a minute a
[40:13] man come to me not long ago come from
[40:15] overseas
[40:16] the man was wrong that's all brother
[40:20] brandon said the man was wrong
[40:21] he says he had three or four children
[40:23] and a wife
[40:24] and he was running around with a woman
[40:26] over here i don't say anything immorally
[40:28] but
[40:29] it just didn't look right amen you see
[40:33] you have to watch what you're doing in
[40:35] the eyes of the public
[40:36] you're written in pistols so this man
[40:39] just running around with this sister
[40:40] you know and his wife and his kids back
[40:42] home he's just running all over the u.s
[40:44] brother ramsey that don't look right
[40:46] that don't look right but you run around
[40:47] with that sister like that
[40:49] amen amen amen amen you know i i i i
[40:54] i question you know because sometimes
[40:56] you get gifted people together
[40:58] and they just run with each other the
[41:01] little text messages go back and forth
[41:04] email messages go back you got to watch
[41:05] that you got to watch that
[41:08] i mean you know and this you know and
[41:11] it's like a church that's happening
[41:13] within a church
[41:16] i've seen it i've seen it with my own
[41:19] eyes you get a real gifted person people
[41:21] start
[41:21] leaning on that gifted person what the
[41:24] lord tell you
[41:25] what the lord tell you the lord ain't
[41:26] told me nothing well they won't
[41:28] move until the lord speak to that person
[41:30] like god can't speak to you
[41:33] right don't don't don't you we want the
[41:35] word first
[41:36] church amen amen hallelujah if we didn't
[41:39] learn
[41:40] nothing we should have learned that that
[41:41] and pentecost that was not the way to do
[41:43] things by leaning on
[41:44] different people that was gifted don't
[41:46] do that lean on the word of god
[41:49] all right let me go here so he says um
[41:52] he was running around with a woman over
[41:54] here i don't say anything immorally but
[41:55] it just didn't look right you see
[41:57] you have to watch what you're doing in
[41:58] the eyes of the public your written
[42:00] epistles
[42:01] and he said i kind of called his hand on
[42:03] it i said sir
[42:05] i hope you don't think i'm rude but i
[42:07] just like to say something as a minister
[42:10] don't you think that the people here
[42:12] will think oh he said no
[42:14] no that's all right in my country see
[42:17] now but you ain't in your country
[42:19] you're here that's all right in my
[42:21] country
[42:22] i said but you're not in your country
[42:24] see you
[42:26] you're over here and a people will and
[42:29] and if people will think something about
[42:31] that he said
[42:32] i said do you know the woman yes
[42:35] i said do you know her background i
[42:38] he said i did brother man i said he knew
[42:40] her background it says he said
[42:42] yes said brother branham i know she's
[42:45] living right now with her fourth husband
[42:47] said and brother branham you know what
[42:50] she is
[42:51] she's such a sweet woman said i went to
[42:54] the lord
[42:54] and i said lord tell me what's the
[42:57] matter with this woman
[42:59] oh lord have mercy jesus just look at
[43:03] his prayer
[43:04] lord tell me what's the matter with him
[43:06] the prayer don't even sound right
[43:10] lord you ought to know what's the matter
[43:12] with it she on her fourth husband
[43:14] amen and they the others ain't dead
[43:18] you don't need you don't need to go to
[43:19] god and ask you what's the matter with
[43:21] this woman
[43:22] amen it's pretty obvious what's the
[43:24] matter with it
[43:26] he says uh uh uh she's living right now
[43:28] with her fourth husband said
[43:30] brother random you know uh what she's
[43:31] such a sweet woman i went to
[43:33] said i went to the lord i said lord tell
[43:35] me what's the matter with this woman
[43:36] said
[43:38] why
[43:40] why would you bless her with the holy
[43:43] ghost and everything and
[43:44] living in adultery now first of all she
[43:47] ain't got the holy ghost my brother
[43:49] just because she's showing all these
[43:51] emotional signs don't mean she got those
[43:53] the holy ghost gonna get in line with
[43:54] the word of god
[43:57] amen right it says why
[44:00] uh would you would you bless him with
[44:01] the holy ghost and everything and living
[44:03] in the daughter he said
[44:04] well said you know the lord give me a
[44:06] dream
[44:09] you can't blame god for all these dreams
[44:12] the lord gave me a dream he said
[44:14] i seen my wife living immorally
[44:18] with another man and i said and i said
[44:21] and said
[44:22] then she come up to me and fell down and
[44:23] said will you forgive me
[44:26] uh and said shu and said then the lord
[44:29] said
[44:29] i forgive her
[44:32] said uh you see no matter if she has
[44:35] done
[44:36] the the way she's doing i forgive her
[44:39] brother random said i said sir your
[44:42] vision
[44:42] or your dream was sweet
[44:48] but it don't line up with the word of
[44:50] god
[44:51] it says that's right god can't say one
[44:53] thing and take it back over here
[44:55] he's gonna say one thing and stay with
[44:57] it till it's accomplished
[44:58] and that which it was purposeful then
[45:01] you see the paradox
[45:03] so if that thing don't line up with the
[45:04] word of god you got to say uh uh uh
[45:06] i'm not gonna agree with you brother
[45:08] random toaster brother that i don't care
[45:10] how
[45:10] how how sweet that dream is you probably
[45:12] sold that to so many other people but
[45:14] now you don't run into somebody's gonna
[45:15] tell you that is off the word
[45:19] and if that's off the words you're off
[45:21] the word
[45:22] and really i i can imagine the advice
[45:24] was go back home to your family
[45:26] and stop running around with this woman
[45:29] now if he didn't want to do that
[45:31] praise the lord he would forsake that
[45:33] counsel and he would go hang himself
[45:36] if you get what i'm saying spiritually
[45:39] amen
[45:41] all right i'm going a little further
[45:46] this is out of the message god
[45:47] testifying of his gifts
[45:53] he says look here how many in here ever
[45:56] dreamed a dream
[45:58] can i just see hands if anybody's ever
[45:59] dreaming to me
[46:02] all right so that's what the prophets
[46:04] say let's see your hand
[46:07] if you dream the dream let's see your
[46:08] hand and i know i've dreamed i've
[46:10] dreamed
[46:10] you know some dreams but i i am really
[46:13] not a dreamer
[46:15] i'm not uh i sleep hard
[46:18] and uh as i read this quote for the
[46:19] brand i'm gonna kind of tell us that you
[46:21] know people that sleep uh
[46:22] hard like that they typically don't
[46:24] dream dream a lot but
[46:26] people that uh that are what we call
[46:28] light sleepers anything
[46:31] anything move just a sheet of paper move
[46:33] in the room at night
[46:34] stay up right if the fan catch a sheet
[46:36] of paper they up
[46:38] if a fan catch a sheet of paper and i'm
[46:40] sleeping
[46:41] i don't hear it don't hear it people can
[46:44] be breaking in the house
[46:48] i mean they're gonna have to almost come
[46:50] and shake me
[46:52] sir i'm in your house oh okay but i i
[46:55] just i don't i i sleep hard
[46:57] when i go to sleep you know so so
[46:59] typically people like that they don't
[47:01] dream
[47:02] they don't dream but others that that
[47:04] sleep light they dream
[47:05] quite often now let me just put it this
[47:08] way
[47:09] god made me the way that i did
[47:12] i am he made me to sleep hard
[47:16] god made the light sleeper the way that
[47:18] they are he made them the sleep life
[47:21] god the gift and the calling is without
[47:24] repentance
[47:25] that's just the way it is so i tell you
[47:28] this much
[47:29] when i do dream i take it seriously
[47:34] when i take when i when i when god give
[47:36] me a dream i take it very seriously
[47:37] because i know
[47:38] that it's nothing but the lord i don't
[47:40] know if i have time to share this
[47:42] and i i'm not sure if i if i i want to
[47:45] you know there was a dream that i had
[47:48] before um even starting truth tabernacle
[47:52] it was a dream that the lord gave me um
[47:56] uh and i and i had to take it seriously
[47:58] i had to
[47:59] um you know and
[48:03] i won't i'll just leave it i won't share
[48:05] it i'll just leave it like that
[48:06] but uh but what i'll say like this when
[48:08] god does give me a dream i always take
[48:11] it
[48:11] quite seriously because i just i don't
[48:13] have them that often i really don't
[48:15] i'll tell you one that i had about
[48:20] two years ago i was uh praying over
[48:24] we want to have the easter services
[48:28] and i said you know we got these
[48:29] brothers in the church we want to use
[48:31] them and
[48:31] i said i want to one of these real
[48:32] quaker i want to use brother troy
[48:34] i want to use brother jerry said lord i
[48:36] just don't know how to line up these
[48:37] services i don't know what what what to
[48:39] do
[48:39] you know just just which way to go with
[48:41] this and um
[48:43] and then while i was sleeping one night
[48:45] uh
[48:46] i had a dream it was a sunrise service
[48:48] and brother jerry was preaching the
[48:50] sunrise service
[48:51] so when i had that dream i got up at the
[48:53] next one i got in touch with
[48:55] jesse brother jerry i had a dream last
[48:57] night
[48:58] uh and that you were preaching the
[49:01] sunrise service
[49:02] i say so i know you supposed to be on
[49:05] sunday morning
[49:06] i know that much the other brothers will
[49:08] figure out but you supposed to be
[49:10] sunday morning sunrise service he said
[49:12] pastor if you had a dream about it i'll
[49:14] be ready
[49:16] praise the lord and we had those
[49:17] services but god gave that to me
[49:19] in a dream that that he was supposed to
[49:21] be preaching that sunrise service so
[49:23] sometimes the lord will speak like that
[49:25] and you know we you know it's pretty
[49:27] clear so you just move out with what god
[49:28] gave you
[49:29] but here let me just kind of bring this
[49:31] quote in and maybe i'll bring a
[49:33] scripture in right after this if i can
[49:35] it says um out of the message god
[49:37] testifying of this gift he says
[49:39] look here how many in here ever dreamed
[49:41] of dream let's see your hand well
[49:42] the bigger percent of you well what if i
[49:45] say it
[49:46] you dream your dream now
[49:51] could you do it no sir it's impossible
[49:56] right if i come up here and tell you
[49:57] since you had dreams before
[49:59] dream me a dream right now that's
[50:01] impossible
[50:02] that's impossible it says so it's
[50:04] impossible to me
[50:06] to see a vision for this woman or that
[50:08] man
[50:09] ever who gives you that dream is up to
[50:12] them
[50:13] praise god it's not up to you no matter
[50:16] how much you want it i want
[50:17] i want to really drive this home i
[50:20] really do
[50:20] no matter how much you want it and and
[50:23] can i just put it this way
[50:25] i don't think we should be going around
[50:28] praying
[50:29] asking god to give us a dream
[50:34] i don't think there's something wrong
[50:36] with that when i'm going and i'm asking
[50:38] lord give me a dream about this god give
[50:40] me a drink you know the devil hears that
[50:42] prayer
[50:44] the devil can hear that prayer so the
[50:46] devil can also
[50:47] get into your subconscious and cause
[50:50] something to happen you think it's god
[50:52] right when you have the gift of dreaming
[50:54] it's not you controlling the gift
[50:56] god controls it god drops the drop
[50:59] drops the dream down when he wants to
[51:02] not when we want it i mean i you know i
[51:06] was
[51:06] reading the scripture a little earlier
[51:08] in the the psalm
[51:10] and i'm gonna come right back to this
[51:11] quote but saul was making a statement
[51:13] um he couldn't get a dream he couldn't
[51:15] get urum you know he couldn't get a word
[51:17] from a prophet so he went to the witch
[51:19] of endor
[51:20] you got to be careful see because if you
[51:22] don't get it from the lord then you'll
[51:24] kind of make something up
[51:26] and and then then the question has to be
[51:27] asked why do you want that dream so bad
[51:31] what's the purpose praise the lord
[51:34] amen look at this
[51:38] says ever who gives you that dream is up
[51:40] to them it's not up to you no matter how
[51:42] much you want it
[51:42] it's what they say whether god gives it
[51:45] to you or not is that right that's the
[51:47] same way it is here
[51:48] he says well there's there's people here
[51:51] in here
[51:51] that i notice hands while ago that never
[51:54] dream dreams
[51:55] they just sleep sound they don't dream
[51:58] at all
[51:58] now i'm gonna try because i know there's
[52:00] people here that know don't try to argue
[52:02] with me i know there's people here that
[52:04] doesn't understand
[52:05] see does not understand he says here's
[52:08] what it is
[52:09] here's a man's conscience conscious
[52:11] right here
[52:12] the conscience you live in and live in
[52:15] now
[52:15] we're taught by science that you're
[52:17] dreaming you're in your subconscious
[52:20] all right he says did you ever see a
[52:22] person dreaming
[52:24] you think you dreamed all night it isn't
[52:27] that long
[52:28] it says uh he says just a moment a
[52:31] little bit
[52:32] you've done dream hours of dreams
[52:35] you think you actually think you done
[52:39] dreamed hours of dreams some of y'all
[52:40] you know you you know you woke up you
[52:42] can you know exactly what time you woke
[52:44] up
[52:44] fell back asleep and by the time you
[52:46] felt you had a dream that seemed like it
[52:48] was lasting for
[52:49] forever and you only had it for a few
[52:51] minutes
[52:53] my god he says um he says you've done
[52:56] dream hours of dreams you think but just
[52:58] a moment a flash
[53:00] while it's going through the person
[53:02] that's dreaming is
[53:03] not sound asleep but you people here
[53:07] who does not dream dreams your
[53:09] subconscious
[53:10] will be way back to a place where you do
[53:13] where you do
[53:14] not reach reach to it and sleep he says
[53:17] you can't help that you can't help it
[53:19] he says you were born that way something
[53:21] that has root has a rulership of you
[53:24] and made you and made you that way so
[53:26] you can't help it and you people who
[53:28] dream dreams you can't help that it
[53:31] wasn't uh you don't have no control of
[53:33] it it's your subconscious
[53:36] so you know you don't have a control
[53:38] over these things and
[53:39] um i mean whether you are a dreamer or
[53:41] you're not a dreamer
[53:42] you don't have control over it it's god
[53:44] made you that way for a purpose
[53:46] now those that god made and he he's
[53:48] blesses them to be able to give them
[53:50] dreams
[53:51] um you just surrender it to the lord but
[53:53] you know as he was saying here
[53:55] you don't have it rules you you don't
[53:57] rule it
[53:59] i was thinking on this person that had a
[54:01] dream
[54:02] and joseph dreamed in genesis 37.
[54:06] um and his dream he dreamed that his
[54:09] sheath
[54:10] rose above the sheath of his brothers
[54:13] now
[54:13] i mentioned to you that sometimes you
[54:15] have to watch when you share in your
[54:17] dream
[54:18] you need to you need to you know
[54:19] sometimes it's not appropriate you just
[54:21] need to hold on to
[54:23] it god gave it to you
[54:26] that's him dealing directly with you now
[54:28] joseph had a dream in genesis 37 that
[54:31] his chief
[54:32] rosa his chief rose up above his
[54:35] brothers
[54:36] and that their sheets would make obesity
[54:38] to his
[54:39] and as i was reading it i thought to
[54:41] myself first
[54:43] he didn't uh first of all he didn't pray
[54:46] and ask god for this dream
[54:47] that's not what happened to joseph god
[54:49] just showed joseph dre but he wasn't
[54:51] praying lord show me a dream where
[54:53] i'm gonna be greater than my brothers
[54:55] that's not joseph's attitude
[54:57] praise the lord right you know he just
[54:59] he just went to sleep god gave him a
[55:01] dream
[55:02] and then he came by his shed so first of
[55:04] all he didn't pray and ask god for the
[55:06] dream
[55:06] it was just given to him secondly
[55:10] i want to say with joseph's dream his
[55:12] timing
[55:13] on sharing the dream may have been a
[55:16] little
[55:16] off now why because before
[55:20] he actually had a dream his daddy had
[55:23] just
[55:23] given him that rainbow coat and his
[55:26] brothers was already upset with him
[55:29] hallelujah his brother was already a
[55:32] little jealous of him
[55:33] of getting this rainbow coat and now
[55:34] he's going to go to sleep and get this
[55:36] dream and tell his brothers how you know
[55:37] what i saw
[55:38] all y'all was bound down worshipping me
[55:41] now
[55:42] his timing was a little off that really
[55:45] got his brothers upset
[55:46] hallelujah but you know the other thing
[55:49] that
[55:49] that that happened here you know and i
[55:51] want to say this i believe he was
[55:53] operating under enthusiasm because he
[55:56] was quite young when these things was
[55:57] happening to him glory to god
[55:59] nevertheless genesis 37 9
[56:02] god gave joseph a second dream
[56:05] and this time he sees the sun the moon
[56:07] and 11 stars
[56:09] bound before him joseph goes immediately
[56:11] out and he begins to share
[56:13] this second dream with his brothers and
[56:15] that is what created problems
[56:17] this is why he ended up in a pit
[56:20] because he operated a little bit too
[56:23] early
[56:25] but you know what god was going to bring
[56:26] in the past anyway god gave him the
[56:28] dream god was going to bring it to pass
[56:30] and it took a number of years before
[56:31] that dream came to pass and i
[56:33] i believe i believe
[56:36] that the reason god had to wait a number
[56:38] of years because he had to shave a
[56:40] little joseph
[56:40] off of joseph
[56:45] and there's some things that we go
[56:47] through in life that god has to actually
[56:48] shave a little bit of us
[56:50] off in order to keep us humble
[56:54] right see when it when by the time
[56:56] joseph's brother showed back up into his
[56:58] life
[56:59] and he started seeing the dream
[57:00] manifested joseph
[57:02] was a different man and if your
[57:06] gift ain't changing you there's
[57:09] something wrong
[57:12] your gift does not exalt you your gift
[57:15] actually exalts god
[57:18] hallelujah right and i mean but you look
[57:20] at joseph's uh
[57:21] joseph's life and and everything yes the
[57:24] dream certainly came to pass but before
[57:26] it actually came to pass joseph had to
[57:27] go through a lot of stuff
[57:31] thrown in the pit raised up out the pit
[57:33] sold into slavery
[57:35] working in you know in egypt and and
[57:38] somebody's house and
[57:39] and and i mean just being promoted from
[57:42] one position to the next and
[57:43] now he's like almost second to charge in
[57:45] part of his house and
[57:46] then politics wife had to come against
[57:48] him and lie on him
[57:50] he run away from the lie and left his
[57:52] coat behind and then was told that
[57:54] uh he he tried to take advantage of
[57:55] politics wife and they threw him in
[57:57] prison
[57:58] got in prison and uh and his gift was
[58:00] still operating
[58:02] in prison he was actually interpreting
[58:04] dreams praise the lord
[58:06] hallelujah glory glory glory see that's
[58:09] i think i think that's something that we
[58:11] miss you know here um
[58:13] typically a person that actually has the
[58:15] ability to dream dreams
[58:17] is a person that god can use to
[58:19] interpret dreams
[58:20] amen god can use them that way if
[58:24] they're humble enough to be used that
[58:25] way
[58:26] amen but we got to watch even how that
[58:28] happens because you know you get people
[58:29] in you know like
[58:30] like was it absalom that was in the
[58:33] church
[58:34] he was in uh in his daddy's church and
[58:37] he got to the spot he's like you know i
[58:38] i just wish that the people would bring
[58:42] their
[58:42] issues to me because i could handle it
[58:47] we ain't got to bother daddy with that
[58:50] we ain't got to bother the king with
[58:51] that i can handle it
[58:53] you got to watch that because see aslam
[58:56] reason that he wanted to handle it
[58:57] because apps don't have ulterior motives
[59:02] amen you know i'ma say this
[59:06] uh now and and i'll i'll come back and
[59:08] say it again
[59:09] uh i i i and and i'm gonna set the
[59:12] platform for it i'm gonna give you some
[59:14] more
[59:14] more quotes and all that i won't do it
[59:16] tonight i set myself a timer we'll go so
[59:18] far and then i'll pick up again
[59:20] but i won't say this now i i think if
[59:22] it's something really
[59:23] related to the church it should always
[59:25] pass through the pastor
[59:27] if it's actually if it's related to
[59:29] somebody in the church
[59:31] let it go through the pastor amen now
[59:34] i'm gonna tell you this
[59:35] as the church grow pastor can't handle
[59:37] all that
[59:38] i'm be honest with you but what the lord
[59:41] is what the lord's just kind of led me
[59:42] to do is just kind of set up
[59:44] just you know the bible saying the mouth
[59:46] of two or three witnesses let every word
[59:47] be established
[59:48] i got some people that got the spirit of
[59:50] discernment and we're gonna use that
[59:52] spirit of discernment
[59:54] right so as that dream passed through
[59:55] the pastor the pastor's gonna give it to
[59:57] some people that got the spirit of
[59:58] discernment
[59:59] and then we're going to pray and see
[1:00:01] what the lord say about it
[1:00:03] then we'll give an answer and if the
[1:00:05] lord don't give an answer
[1:00:07] we won't give an answer we won't make it
[1:00:09] up as we go
[1:00:11] if god don't give nothing we just didn't
[1:00:13] get nothing praise the lord
[1:00:16] right and i'm gonna read you a quote
[1:00:17] because it was a little young lady she
[1:00:19] got upset with brother branham
[1:00:20] now you've been interpreting everybody
[1:00:22] else's dreams but you ain't interpreted
[1:00:23] mine
[1:00:24] he told the sister look here you say
[1:00:27] look
[1:00:27] let me just tell you your mom and daddy
[1:00:29] got confidence in me and i want you to
[1:00:31] have the same confidence in me
[1:00:32] he says if god don't show me the dream i
[1:00:35] can't show it to you
[1:00:37] and he had to give this us just just
[1:00:39] calm down relax just wait because
[1:00:40] everybody think every
[1:00:41] you know my dream is really important no
[1:00:43] just wait on the lord
[1:00:44] we let it pass through the pastor and
[1:00:47] and the lord just kind of already led me
[1:00:48] to you know different ones that he want
[1:00:50] me to start out with
[1:00:51] you know as far as being able to you
[1:00:53] know let's let's just passage through
[1:00:55] let them pray about it
[1:00:56] and then let's see what god says about
[1:00:58] it if god don't say nothing we don't say
[1:00:59] nothing
[1:01:00] amen right but but i think you got to
[1:01:03] have
[1:01:04] you know as gifts come you got to have
[1:01:07] uh
[1:01:07] two or three witnesses because the bible
[1:01:09] say let every word be established
[1:01:11] in the mouth of two or three witnesses
[1:01:14] amen amen they balance that with the
[1:01:18] word of god see how
[1:01:19] how it connects with the word of god and
[1:01:21] if it don't connect with the word of god
[1:01:23] we don't see nothing here we don't see
[1:01:25] nothing here
[1:01:26] now you might get upset well i see
[1:01:28] something
[1:01:29] okay that's up to you we don't see
[1:01:32] nothing
[1:01:33] amen hallelujah so i think you know the
[1:01:37] only person that wouldn't be able to
[1:01:38] have to go through a process like that
[1:01:40] would be the prophet himself the rest of
[1:01:42] us
[1:01:42] need to go through a process all right
[1:01:46] have it checked by the urine thumb bring
[1:01:48] it before the priest
[1:01:50] i was telling how joseph was given the
[1:01:51] ability
[1:01:53] to actually interpret dreams and god was
[1:01:55] using that while he was even in prison
[1:01:57] but while while he was there in prison
[1:01:59] he had been stripped
[1:02:01] of everything he was by the time his
[1:02:04] brothers came back to him joseph was a
[1:02:06] different man
[1:02:08] joseph was a completely different man he
[1:02:10] won he won
[1:02:11] and actually you never even heard joseph
[1:02:14] when his brothers came back you never
[1:02:15] heard joe say
[1:02:16] remember that dream no remember them two
[1:02:20] dreams
[1:02:21] that the lord said he didn't have to say
[1:02:23] nothing like that i guarantee
[1:02:25] the brothers remembered i guarantee the
[1:02:28] daddy remembered
[1:02:29] but joseph didn't have to remind them
[1:02:32] but what joseph did want to do
[1:02:34] is test their spirits glory to god
[1:02:38] and when they stuck the little cup
[1:02:39] inside benjamin's back
[1:02:41] then he finally got a re he got a way to
[1:02:43] see how his brothers had changed as well
[1:02:46] gloria over over the years we all should
[1:02:48] have been changing by now we
[1:02:50] i feel like you know we've had this the
[1:02:52] the message for
[1:02:53] uh quite some time and uh uh the word of
[1:02:56] god has been given to us and now it's up
[1:02:58] to us to apply
[1:02:59] what what has been given to us uh the
[1:03:01] church should be so much further up the
[1:03:02] road spiritually mature to be able to
[1:03:04] handle these things
[1:03:06] amen but if we don't i felt that it was
[1:03:08] very important let's
[1:03:09] let's get a structure around it because
[1:03:11] um
[1:03:12] if we got a structure around it then
[1:03:14] it'll keep the church together
[1:03:15] a gift can divide a church
[1:03:20] a gift it can divide a church i don't
[1:03:23] want to see a gift divide us
[1:03:25] i want to see the gifts you know used by
[1:03:27] god and
[1:03:28] and you know like i said we welcome it
[1:03:30] here at spirit and truth tabernacle but
[1:03:32] there's a process that we want to do
[1:03:34] things there's a way that we want to do
[1:03:35] things
[1:03:36] sometimes god give you something and you
[1:03:38] know sometimes not it's not for you just
[1:03:40] go
[1:03:40] you know what i had a dream about you no
[1:03:42] don't just wait you don't know what's
[1:03:44] going on there
[1:03:46] just bring it to the pastor or you know
[1:03:48] and it's it's easier just send it to me
[1:03:51] text me
[1:03:51] or or what's at me or something like
[1:03:54] that because you know
[1:03:55] i get all the details and i can just
[1:03:57] kind of look at the details then i pass
[1:03:58] it on to
[1:03:59] you know some others that i know that
[1:04:00] are gifted with with discernment let it
[1:04:02] let
[1:04:03] what do you see in this pray over this
[1:04:05] tell me what you see in this
[1:04:06] and i and i always want people to pray
[1:04:08] first
[1:04:10] sometimes it's obvious but pray anyway
[1:04:14] pray anyway look at this
[1:04:18] joseph when he got the second dream he
[1:04:20] was not seeking the lord asking him for
[1:04:22] that dream
[1:04:24] and the reason that he wasn't is because
[1:04:26] the prophet says we don't have control
[1:04:28] over the gift
[1:04:29] god is the one that has control over the
[1:04:31] gift and he gives it to us
[1:04:33] as he sees fit so um
[1:04:38] let me stop there for tonight
[1:04:41] and i will pick up i got some more notes
[1:04:43] and things like that that i want to
[1:04:44] share
[1:04:45] uh and also just the structure around
[1:04:48] what i just shared
[1:04:49] i'll bring that structure and some
[1:04:51] quotes around that on next week
[1:04:53] but we just want to get started talking
[1:04:55] about this and and i just
[1:04:56] i'm i'm really excited about what god
[1:04:59] has in store
[1:05:00] if we can get everybody amen operating
[1:05:03] in this channel i believe
[1:05:04] god gonna bless this church uh he's
[1:05:07] already blessed the church he already
[1:05:09] has
[1:05:10] but let's get a structure around what
[1:05:12] we're doing let's let's let the holy
[1:05:14] spirit
[1:05:15] uh just just guide us lead us you know
[1:05:17] through
[1:05:18] uh this this this next season that we
[1:05:20] have
[1:05:21] let's let's let the holy spirit do it
[1:05:24] amen let's pray
[1:05:27] father we are uh grateful for the word
[1:05:31] of the lord
[1:05:32] that you have given to us lord as we're
[1:05:35] just embarking upon this teaching on
[1:05:37] dreams
[1:05:39] god i i pray that you
[1:05:42] would direct us and know lord that
[1:05:46] sometimes when you get to talking about
[1:05:48] these things
[1:05:50] um lord is is it's a it's a difficult
[1:05:54] subject
[1:05:55] and lord we just want to say it in a way
[1:05:57] where we welcome gifts
[1:05:59] with god but we also just keep the order
[1:06:02] that you've given us god that we could

[1:06:53] able to interpret dreams
[1:06:55] god let them rise up they might have
[1:06:57] that spirit of discernment uh

[1:08:57] very full life and we thank god for that
