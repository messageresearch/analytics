to see you in the house Lord today find somebody then greet them in Jesus name I was so good to see a house of Lord today praise the Lord man my god my god my god they'll give me seated how we just love the Lord just a couple of things I need to make mention of here we're grateful to have and brother-sister earnest with us from Wichita Kansas he was there passing through they got a family here in Florida up in Northwest Florida but kind of passing through a little vacation and aside and it all worked out from the commnity men on this stone this weekend and we're just just happy and meant to have them pass through once more under expectation for what the Lord wants to say to our hearts on today amen I just wanted to also just welcome sister Brittany Blake amen god bless you I invited my sister Felicia sodid to have you with us on today amen god bless you we I know last week we had a few visitors as well and thank God for those that were able to come and just just appreciate what the Lord is doing you know anytime somebody gets started down this little path where they where they're serving the Lord and and trying to do things right you know the devil gonna be right there to find them amen and we've seen some come and we don't see you know everybody this morning so y'all be in prayer especially for those newcomers be in prayer and then people that think they might have walked in here by mistake God don't make mistakes he predestinate and he for ordains things to happen and you just pray that God would just give revelation and understanding to his people that's one of the things that we want to see God do in this hour just just sell their hearts with with Revelation and we we can't help but preach truth that's what we all about spirit and truth amen so sometimes people have not heard some of the things that we share but we don't want it to be anything - a man started and we wanted to be something that draws them closer to the Lord Jesus so we think no more for that as we're approaching Eastern there's a little project a man that we wanted to do with the just with the families here in the church and after church today there would be a little little area there that you can get a little cross and and what you're doing with the cross is it's just a way for you to come and sit down maybe have some family devotion and talk about what does the cross really mean to you what was what is a crucifixion mean to you personally right and you know you kind of talk about it maybe write some things on the cross and then we're gonna take it and put it together and just kind of have a little display here even as to what the cross meant for us as as individuals it's not just amen just another holiday Amen it's not just something that we do get some new suits and a man who dresses and and all of that that's not what Easter is all about but we should think about what our Lord and Savior did for us there's some 2,000 years ago I'm recalling the scripture says why while I was yet a sinner he died a man I I don't know about you but I am grateful for love like damn Amen before I knew him he knew me come on somebody then he had already died for me you know what mistakes I was gonna make in my failures he and he had already paid the price hallelujah so when I come to him and I had already repented he said I got this covered don't worry about it my blood with shame man it's covered all your sins and I think God for love like that so so as you as we're approaching this Amen I want you to just take it you'll have out there in each one we have an opportunity just kind of put on the cross and decorate your cross however you would like to decorate we're just gonna kind of bring it and put it all together and you know just until Easter time and so Sunday April 14th would be the last thing that you have to be able to return your cross so you get in a man of the 14th we want you to bring it back by the 14th so we can put all together for Easter Sunday amen the Lord Lord I believe Lord of less than just got a little card here also says a special thank you every kindness as a part and bringing joy to someone's heart is sometimes easy to forget that there are nice people out there doing nice things for others thanks for being such a special reminder this is coming from sister Verna and the Jemison family in the loss of their loved one just thanking the church amen for their love and their support during this time of their loss and continue to keep the family in your prayers that God will just continue to give them strength and direction through this time amen so praise the Lord we just we certainly think God I was on a Thursday night at a church there in Ohio and I was just you know we passed ahead done some things they had us choir get up to sing waymaker and he's like he wanted me to kind of come and sing along with them and then that church got into talking about even when I didn't see him he was working you know you're always working whatever that part is I mean they got till I said boy they singing up in here on the Thursday night they had the truth lit up Thursday night I see if it's lit up like this on Thursday what y'all do on Sunday yeah I got to get back you know and I was just you know just really blessed by the service and you know there was he has a piano player is believed was his mother that plays piano I was just kind of sitting there and I heard you know I was listening to the music and and then I just heard somebody say hallelujah that came from I say I know what it's coming from in front of me better where where they come from and they say no glory what in the world is gonna be on fire glory to God praise God I tell you what I said man I'm plan on coming back and I plan on bringing some of the church back to this man we need to go I said before was on Thursday night can I put it this way something y'all understand what I'm sayin shopping on Thursday night not waiting to Sunday but they jump on first yes I need some more it is hallelujah Manny Manny Manny Ben but I tell you I was just I was just really really enjoy myself there and and you know just our brother Sam Browning's our pastor so I told say yeah we will we will be back so I some point in time we might have to look at getting us a bus again and and getting on that throw high on the bus you know and just just going out there for the weekend or services I know that y'all would be blessed say man I know you'll be blessed oh praise the Lord let's then talk feet and I am let's just prepare to welcome her brother Tom earnest amen to the Pope in Philippi amen as he comes a man in his own special way just looking for God to use him to speak to our hearts amen own this song says Amazing Grace how sweet the sound saved a wretch like me I once was lost but now I'm found and our CV has lived in your eyes closed let's just sing a course of his son only two days of rain comes see [Music] like well I [Music] god bless you [Music] that brother Jack he just higher octane than I am that's all I think about when it had high levels in ever pick up the scraps and remain and [Music] you know some cars need that high-octane stuff to keep running because I think it's always sing this one I couldn't even couldn't do justice those songs bring you greetings from Wichita our pastor there brother Pinkston they are in service at this moment as we are and so just remember them we're gonna just read a couple of verses of Scripture out of the book of Acts chapter 27 we have been much in prayer for our service upcoming that we have now got upon us here asking the Lord to give us something out of his word that'll just just encourage our hearts Acts chapter 27 and verse will pick it up this is in the middle of a Paul's journey to Rome he was of course a prisoner on this journey and we find that as the journey eclipsed wonderful wonderful lessons to be learned out of this this journey he had to get there it had been prophesied that he would go go to Rome so it was no question about him arriving safely but this hey just a little excerpt out of that journey acts 27 and verse 13 and when the south wind blew softly I want you to notice that next word these are these are the ship people these are the people that are escorting him when the south wind blew softly supposing that they had obtained their purpose loosing thence they sail close by Creed everybody with me say that one word supposing you know these people got under uh that soft wind from the South coming calmly rocked him right to sleep I just want to point that out for we go any farther because it was it was a soft south wind was blowing on and and because of that comfort level that they had reached they were supposing that they had found their purpose but look at Burt what's the next word but if you get rocked too much asleep but something might happen but not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind called Yurok Ladon that sounds like a dinosaur so you Rock Ladon come up against that south wind that was blowing softly yeah and you know why it rose it was to get Paul where he was supposed to let's pray together Heavenly Father today as we go into the word our hearts are always encouraged to see these little things that the word has for us and holds for us it keeps our hearts steered in the right direction we pray today that we can every one find some some comfort some strength some joy some peace some long-suffering that all belong to you that it'll come our way to death we always enjoy coming I have to come out and sit in on the songs and the ministry of our brother in the psalm service and the specials and the choir and every one of them that participated Lord rained down a special blessing upon them today we ask these things in your name amen and amen god bless you may be be seated he says I've got a hold this so I'm gonna do it last time y'all experimented with the time of the pill Mike but easy says that thing that went by the way too grave I always enjoy coming by just everybody that I talked to that gets to come by there's something about the the Fellowship of our brother and your saints that come and it's just it's just a privilege to be here with you short little stay this time just passing through we're actually going to to fly out of here and make a little journey up to Baltimore Maryland on on Tuesday and then come back and rejoin our vehicle and pick up our chariot and go further on the journey so but it's just a pleasure to have this time my wife's been a little we spent a few days of vacation over around Port Charlotte area I know some friends from Canada they would like to come down there and so we went over and stayed with them for a week and now we're making this little journey north back to our children in in Navarre Pensacola area before we get home and then by Memphis for some services there Memphis on the way home so that's our journey and and you are here it was gonna be here he knew exactly exactly who would be in the service it's it's a it's it's just never a disappointment when you when you see something in the word that that strength comes out of areas you know people ask me a lot of times especially young people been in the message a long time now I'm in my 40th year ministry right if I preached his heart his brother Jack I'd be finished by now because I'd only got about twenty one or two years down there not have been done yeah but I space myself out a little bit I'm in my 40s Peter this guy's high-octane that's all I can say about that you know you pull up to the pump so these new cars need that hot stuff my wife my boyfriend got her another car needs that high octane it just it just breaks my heart every time I see the difference in regular and high octane so I always think of brother Tom just being regular gas just being regular but it's just a joy it's it's wonderful to feed off of that energy I've known the pastor he was just mentioning in Ohio I didn't know I didn't know they ran that hot either but I'll have to get by there myself and see that maybe you just fed off of him but it's just a pleasure it is a joy I see some of your faces over and over again and you're continuing in the word that's how you know you're truly a disciple indeed a lot of people start the journey but those who continue in my word these are my disciples and then and and we pray today that that if you're new to the journey if you're just joining the battle if you're old-timer like us you know I got the got years old me now I'm turned 60 years old this past year I know you're surprised your brother Tom you don't look a day over 35 you can I can read it see I'm not a prophet but I feel that coming in I feel it coming in actually we lived in Canada nine years my wife is Canadian and and of course I'm not quite old enough to draw us Social Security yet but I found out when I got up to Canada in December on a visit that you can start drawing your Canadian pension at sixty I was just overjoyed I never thought I'd draw a pension shape here I'm 60 years old it ain't gonna let me retire but it was we lived there nine years and I had no idea the brother that I was visiting there says you need to go down and just see what you can get cuz y'all done paid it in I mean get it back you know wander down to the pension office there and the Canada Pension Plan I work nine years while it was up there and contributed and found out they're gonna give me a whole 133 dollars 95 cents a month that's only about 75 bucks Americans the exchange rate ain't too good right now but but it's still good to have so I just opened me a little Bank of Montreal account and I'm just just laying up some Canadian treasure but I'm just sharing that with you so if I go slow it's cause I'm old I once was young but now but I am a pensioner so I look at these young guns on the drums and the music over here and it's just wonderful to say God bless you down here I enjoy coming I can't even can't even sit in the back I always want to come out and be a part of the service with you sit in on the songs and enjoy that with you here you got a new neighbor behind I don't know if you can I'll do my best overrun that neighbors our neighbors sometimes you're not allowed to choose your neighbors just like your family you can't choose your family sometimes you don't get to choose good but today we're gonna just take a little little thought for you something I've had on my heart to bring for several days now and I keep looking at it and and you know people in this age you especially have trouble finding their true purpose my purpose is an easy thing to preach on because because we're not really interested in our purpose of what we want out of life but we're always searching for what he wants what our true purpose is take some people a long time to find it I wanted to read you a little quote from the Prophet if I can and of course we look back to Abraham last time I was here I know we spoke quite a bit about Abraham and his journey and his life and but the Prophet tells us in a message called faith is our victory that Abraham was just a man with no hairs his words Abraham was just a man with no certain purpose in life that was until he turned 75 years old see we always as young people all of your counselors in school all of your advisors your parents your pastors your your guidance counselors they are always always steering you trying to as it take a young person and steer them into a particular area of life kids go get their degrees in agriculture and they end up being bankers you know they'll they'll spend four years studying criminal science and they'll end up nailing the roof on a house it's it's just we do our best to take what this world has to offer work with it apply ourselves but God has a way of as with Abraham as brother branham says here Abraham was just a man with no certain purpose in life you remember last time we were here we were talking about brother Branham letting us know he was actually down there in Babylon helping build away on that Tower of Babel his early journey he was spent in in the heathen land he wasn't even Abraham Abraham wasn't raised righteous he wasn't raised by any kind of a godly standard as there was back in that day he was down there with his his father laboring away on the Tower of Babel with Eze brother branham says just a man with no certain purpose in life just with his father and his friends coming down from babylon they settled there and Shinar they had a tower built and so forth one day while abraham was praying no doubt he prayed through till he struck the end of god how did he do it perhaps he felt like this if there is a God who made the ark and let Noah float through he still lives today somewhere in the land of heathens where he was sojourning he touched the hand of God I think every one of us could say that's our testimony in the land of heathens he touched the hand of God and in there God give him a revelation that there was a city whose builder and maker was God and we read that all of Abraham's life he was a pilgrim and a stranger to the world because his one ambition from not having any certain purpose in life his one ambition was to find that city whose builder and maker was God he struck something he he caught God in a faith in that God that he first saw the New Jerusalem and he put his pack on his back and he became a wanderer not just floating about with any purpose but he had faith that there was a city whose builder and maker was God he had a purpose in life to find that place do you see he was just he was a farmer he hadn't done the end of bad I mean if you read some of the the history of Abraham he had cattle he had possessions came down to the place at him and lot had to divide it up and go separate ways but but we know that he hadn't really done bad in life but he had not found his true purpose he had not found his calling until one day we find out he met a stranger coming up over the hill but he knew who he was three men come walking up on the tent door and he met a man named hesitate and the profit lets us know that once he met Melchizedek it changed his whole his whole ambition he knew there was a city it was confirmation that there was a city to be had because he had met the king of that city and he knew by that acquaintance he knew by that visitation of the the king of that city coming to him I can't do nothing now but look for that city oh the Prophet goes if I can just finish this quote out for you you can't purpose anything of God's promise in your heart without finding the reality to it if your soul has been tormented by sins and doubts and ups and downs and frustrations and there's something down in you that's telling you there's somewhere you can overcome that why do you float around them from church to church and place the place just kneel down to you strike heaven and go beyond the sound barriers then you'll have a purpose in life you'll have a purpose in life he says you'll have a purpose and belonging to the church you'll have a purpose in being baptized you'll have a purpose in what you're seeking for not just doing it we don't come this morning just because it's Sunday morning we don't come because it's a habit we don't come because it's a routine we come because there's a purpose in us in a message called that day on Calvary that's what that's what all people has to do is find out what you are and what's the purpose Church isn't going to church just to play music and sing songs church is a place where corruption correction and judgment begins at the house of God he tells a little story about Abraham Lincoln here I was reading a story one of our greatest presidents I think the nation ever was was Lincoln not because he come from Kentucky but because he was a great man he was deprived of education but something was in his heart some purpose brother Branham says I like a man of vision I like people this something they're fighting for just not lay around well whatever comes we'll be all right Oh be up and at him Lincoln never let his education stand in the way he had something to do and I think every Christian ought to be that way find your purpose and go do it amen and amen let it not be the next best car the next best house the next best church the next best any of that let it be the purpose that God puts you here for now we've learned many lessons through these years learning it from from the the words of our prophet so often he would he would instruct us and let us know that that the trouble with people is they always think that in order for them to be serving God that their purpose has to be a large one right it's got to be something magnificent it's got to be got to be something spellbinding but we find out that the Prophet let us know that there were people who were were even in the days of our Lord he said Joseph of Arimathea was in the in the region he was enough of a disciple then he had enough money to be able to buy the tomb for our Lord that was his purpose oh you know he kindly hurt our feelings there along the way you'll find him saying in one place that God puts some people in the church you ready now some people are a part of the church just to help pay the power bills that is we don't have those folks around these lights is gonna go off soon and maybe the connection next door will get shut down too I'm just saying maybe it's all on the same breaker I don't know that y'all been around long I don't bother y'all but here this yes we all but but everybody thinks and you know what what troubles me and again I'm just gonna be a little evangelistic this more it as evangelistic as I can be now people think evangelism is sweating and running and hollering and tap-dancing on the back of the benches for a little while an evangelist can stand still if it's something that that evangelizes an area of your life I'm always happy let me just confess something to you I've witnessed it many times and I've told many of the churches that I go to I'm always happy if I'm done and one person got a little bit closer to the throne because of that sir I don't have to go into a church and have everybody all worked up in the ladder have everybody all raving about what a wonderful so if one person who's a little closer to the throne because this body is being made up little by little day by day in his own way if there's one thing that is said that inches you a little closer to the throne into your the fulfillment of what God has placed you here to do then it's been a wonderful morning but people get it in their mind they always feel like I hear it so awful well I could serve God better if you ever get you ever get around those folks that's all they want to talk about well I could serve God better if if we had more young people in the church I hear that one a lot well we're gonna up and relocate over here we're gonna relocate from this church to another Church because over there they got more young people well young people have problems see I'm gonna get in trouble now got a lot of young people here and listen to an old fellow saying I once was young I remember but they all there's always something well I could serve God better you know I was listen to a fellow the other day preaching a guy on radio he had a good thought he said you know he said I he said well we always got some reason that if this was different I could serve God better he said you know we I was getting on the airplane to come to this meeting the other day and and I'm walking by all those folks in first class rows 1a and 1b and and my wife and I experience this too you know what is something about walking on an airplane and folks up front when your seats all the way in the back they won't look at you now because because you belong way back there and you walk by Rho 1 a and 1 B and you're in 27f yeah and you're sitting back there you think well I could serve God better I could serve the Lord a little better my attitude would be a little better I stopped in on brother Stevens ear that he made one of the best statements I've heard a preacher say in a long time he says we're always wanting power to move a tree or to move a mountain but we don't ever worry about enough power to move a grudge out of our lives I told him after I said that's the most profound thing I've ever heard everybody wants want something bigger and more glamorous and something that others can see and something that others can participate in and can talk about later yeah but it's not location that's what real estate people have taught you and I know y'all have trouble with real estate down here the prices of things we took a little bus tour the other day we were over in Naples Florida there is more rich folks live in Naples then the whole state of Kansas they're all conglomerated together down there and the fellows giving us a little bus tour and he's showing us the town and he's telling us now on this side of the street and all these big fine houses that's where two millionaires live and they don't get to cross the street because over here this is where the billionaires live and they got Judge Judy and all them kind of people living there Elton John's got him a house there all these money people of the world fabulous wealth I never you know we get into a trap sometimes and we think man if I could just why does it always go back to money why does it always have to go back to money Jesus taught us so many lesson but he you know he actually taught more or less is more parables about money than he did about any other area prayer or faith or anything else he took that little woman that cast all she had into the offering plate he's a baby I hate to let you fellas know this but she gave the most because it was all she had it was all but that's that's the trouble with people they I find in this message especially you know I've been around long enough we came into message in 1969 and I remember a little community there in Tennessee where was was going to church there were actually people that would leave their jobs in other states there wasn't there wasn't a church on every corner like there is now it was it was lean Pickens back then but there were people that would meet move from two and three states over to come where the word was they would quit their jobs and come to the word I remember that I remember families moving in picking up their children to coming in and looking for for work in our location just so they could be in church but it's all different now now you hear of it all the time well I got to move over here because my job is taking me over there the first course question needs to be asked that person is there is there an assembly there is there a church there is there a fellowship there for you to continue your walk with the Lord is there well no I'll just I'll just taper I'll do it we'll do whatever I can do that's the opposite of the way it was people used to leave their jobs to come to church now they leave the church to go to their jobs they don't believe that God can provide a table in the wilderness do it he will prove you you'll prove himself to you that he is able to take care of your needs I know all the psychologist wants you to bloom where you're planted and all those things that you see on the internet you get on Facebook and they'll just have you doing all kind of stuff I'm not interested in that I'm interested in being where the Lord has placed me to be if my job gives out guess what he has another job for you he has something better in mind for you if your heart knows if you are convinced in your heart and soul in mind that this is the place that God has brought you to fulfill this earthly journey because this is just an earthly journey this one ain't gonna go on forever folks our purpose is much like Abraham's was to look for that city whose builder and maker was gone but people get it in their mind it's just again in the old days back in the late 60s and early 70s when we came into the message there wasn't churches on every corner there wasn't there wasn't houses of worship that you could just relocate from one to the other at will now it's just it's just church hoppers something will go wrong somebody done somebody wrong right I could have served the Lord better there if that sister hadn't cleared at me from the other side of the aisle and if she could have just had some in her I don't know what caused that flinch but all of a sudden we become prophets I'll suddenly become diviners of a human nature how is that why is it that we let such little petty things get between us in the word I'm not a big fan of TD jakes but I heard him say one of the most profound things that I've ever heard I do listen to a lot of preachers on the radio I can't stand to look at a lot of them so I do listen on the radio I tried looking to Joel Osteen one time he blinded me with those teeth the light reflecting off of those teeth I just couldn't do it but I do I listen on the radio and TV Jake's made a very good observation he said we allow people sometimes and he was he was using the scripture talking about redeeming the time listen to this now he said he said we'll allow a 15-second conversation with a brother or a sister something they say to us in 15 seconds we will walk away and let that ruin our lives for years listen just something they say something that we thought they meant that maybe they didn't even mean it at all and we will let that ruin our lives for years and years that will haunt us in our dreams and then our when our heads are on our pills that brother said that to me that sister said that to me and his whole point was this we need to go out and redeem those 15sec give them over into the hand of God and let him deal with that in your life erase it buy it back you know what redeem means it means to buy it back well you don't know how bad I've been hurt everybody's been hurt and everybody to say no session for who got hurt the most that's what the country-western people sing about somebody done somebody wrong we're not interested in that oh my goodness sometimes we let the enemy rob us robbed us of a true liberated I love the songs you sing the the comfort that they bring to you but we let the enemy rob us so many times of the victory because of those petty little things in our lives we have to find the purpose and once you know what the Prophet says you that's all you have to do is find out what you are and what's your purpose that's what he's encouraging us to do we're not even getting to our text yet let me get out two things running smooth we get rocked to sleep sometimes we get you know we think that we think that our Christian walk you know we didn't join no picnic you know that already it ain't gonna be easy all the time that's what I especially liked about our text when the south wind blew softly things that things was rolling along pretty smooth things had calmed down for them and by that comfort by that little rest period that they had been given it led him astray let me tell you something too brother that brother branham said about that he says he said I believe it was Lincoln that said one time in the time of peace prefect prepare for war he stops there he says now it might not have been him but it sounds like it was him that made that say me well actually it wasn't him that made it it was that that statement is contributed or attributed to George Washington all right and it wasn't even his he borrowed it as well I did a little research for you there brother I said I think it was Lincoln said this but it wasn't Lincoln everybody else sent in a mirror who thought it was George Washington but it was a fella by the name of you ready for this his name was Publius Flavius for genius rene das I'm gonna give you all the quiz on that afternoon in the four in the fourth century AD he was a Roman military writer and he wrote about the conquest of the Romans and and it was a Latin expression which meant if you want peace prepare for war but brother brems gonna teach us a little lesson out of this old expression even though he gave it to Lincoln we can all make those kind of mistakes family yeah sometime I might be quoting brother Jack and it could be somebody else you know we're all plagiarist let's face it everything I know about plagiarize I borrow from the best I'm borrowing from Paul and John Peter and I'm going to the message and I'm telling you what he said because the things that that are that are revealed belong in to us and to our children I don't have you know I've never had a little corner that you got to know you got it from me that's the trouble with preachers today the Lord will give them a little inspiration also there's got to be their doctrine it's got to be their teaching got to be their instruction it's got to be their view on the scripture that that you remember it doesn't matter where you got it from if it's the truth his truth will march on I know God used a donkey one time to get the message across if God can use a donkey he can use anybody to get his message across but brother Branham is talking about this he's a attributing this to Lincoln and to enna in the time of peace prepare for war that would be a good thing for us to think about in time while everything is running smooth you better get ready for Satan isn't going to let it run smooth very long he says you're in a convention now and everything he was in he was in Southern Pines North Carolina when he was preaching this you're in a convention now and everything will just pour a long fun but you're gonna leave here in a few days and you're gonna meet the enemy he might not even wait till you get ready to leave listen what he says he might attack any time he's wicked he's ruthless he just carries on whenever he can whatever he can say or do he does it so it's best to be dressed all the time you might meet him talking about the enemy in the mail you might meet him out on the street you might meet him in your car hard telling where you meet him or he'll meet you right in the seat there and me right in the pulpit here anywhere he's just wicked and he doesn't care so we want to be prepared for it what's the message that the Prophet is giving us in the time of peace prepare for war in the time of smooth sailing prepare for what God might be allowing to come your way you know it's not it's not it's not calm calm winds and and bliss that that marks out the truth the true designation of what a Christian life is we appreciate the times of rest the times of refreshing that comes from the throne but it's a battle my dear brothers you might meet him in your car could be on the way to church could be something the wife said that you need to go back and redeem that time are you with me might meet him on the street it's not in in the calm of the wind sometimes God deals with us and in this instance we took our scriptures back to the word there where we looked you find that that that that restful little time that they had when the southern winds were blowing softly when God had allowed him to find a little place of rest a little a little place where they we just wasn't fighting the battles so hard it deceived them supposing they had found their purpose now Paul had already told him Paul had already let him know we need that we need to win her right here there's gonna be some harm if we don't win it right here let's stay but brother Graham's words was the ship captain thought he'd know better than Paul thought he had more instruction on the matter thought he understood the soft southern breezes that was blowing in his face better than Paul and so he went ahead and cut loose but right after that a confession wind called Yurok Ladon I like to say that word I could just stand here and say it about a half a dozen times and be ready to go home you Rock Ladon came away like I said it sounds like a dinosaur don't it but here's one thing you'll learn about the troublesome winds when there's when the trials and the test comes and our weather service has taught us this they like to name everything you know he's doing the old days you just had hurricanes now you got a name to a hurricane you can probably name all the ones that's blowed through here since you've lived in West Palm Beach brother Brown talked about those those storms let's read one other scripture together Matthew chapter 7 I like what we were taught on this verse Matthew chapter 7 Jesus is going to give us a little parable here concerning concerning your foundation in Matthew the seventh chapter we'll pick it up in 24 therefore whosoever you know this parable very well I know you've heard it preached on many times therefore whosoever hears these sayings of mine and doeth them I liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock the rain descended the floods came the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock and every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand the rain descended the floods came the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it and it came to pass when the entity says the people were astonished at his doctrine it doesn't seem like a real hard lesson right there this is pretty easy build your house on a rock ins gonna be able to withstand just shows and folks hadn't been taught much at all they were still back in some ABCs right there in that early day here Jesus was giving him a little simple lesson on foundations building on a solid foundation but but the Prophet took up these verses and he gave us a little a little admonition here and I hope it strikes your heart today Jesus was speaking here of a coming storm which has got to strike every man and every woman that's born in the world you're in that verse you are in those verses this lesson on the foundation you are there he was speaking of a coming storm which has got to strike every man and every woman that's born in the world there is just no way out of it that storm will strike you sometime or other if you can look back in your past and and you've already weathered it god bless you today maybe it's this maybe it's that we don't even want to get into what how that could manifest itself in your life I do know for the body itself for this broad elect body there is a coming storm still out there ahead of us we get all worried about our fellow that lives near y'all over here in Marlo go go I don't really care whether you like it or don't like it God somehow has orchestrated all these players to be in the right place at the right I could care less about the politics though I don't care if you like the wall or don't like the wall I don't care if you like guns or don't like guns I don't care I don't care about any of those going ons out there but he's not gonna help you build a foundation that'll weather this storm is coming [Music] I could just I always got accused of stumping for Trump before he won I remember being in a lot of churches and every one of us thought there was no way he was gonna get there what many wasn't many prophets that could foresee mr. Trump being the president he had a powerful woman running against him they just got done with that Russian thing and there were two years I wasted their money finding out he didn't have nothing to do with it or so they say but if we got all political we could discuss that I don't care whether whether the Russians influenced our election or not I'll tell you who put the right man in office if he's if he's the devil incarnated himself he's there in office to help this thing there you are back to if I was sitting up there rolling one a I could serve God better than back here in 27c and see if you get in the mindset that it's where you are is what's the problem is then everything's gonna go wrong around you to even make it worse if you're in 27 see the guy in 27 D and and on the other side of you they're gonna both of them gonna weigh about 400 pounds and your life could even be more miserable finding yourself back there it's not location we are sheltered that we have a shelter my dear brothers and sisters but brother branham is talking about this oncoming storm every man has to weather it every man's gonna face it that storm will strike you some time or another depends on what kind of a foundation you have you'll like this little quote I know you've probably read it but it's sir it's involved in your area here in fact he was in he I think he might have been in West Palm Beach when he was preaching this I'm not sure didn't get that down he says this he says not long ago I was told of a story that happened I believe I read it in the newspaper down in Florida they have many great storms that sweep through Florida typhoons that come in off the sea and bring the water four city blocks up into the city and sweeps out everything I like what he says there I'm told that their weather prophets are always on the lookout for such snores they call the meteorologists today yeah call them weather prophets they get it right just a part of the time it's not a true gift that's for sure and some way through the elements they can contact the changing of the weather in the atmosphere which away the weather's gathering that'll bring forth one of those storms because they made a life study of it and by certain instruments things that science has provided them and then by calling ahead and hearing of which way the storms coming how much wind has got behind him which way other storms are coming in or winds whether it's able to combat it or to shove away the storm he stops there said I could stop here and preach on that for an hour that it hears this point it takes a greater storm that's coming it takes a higher wind to turn that storm what a point he's making here I know we lived up in the panhandle of Florida and we watched that ourselves we we lived there for 21 years right a couple of miles off the coast those hurricanes would be barreling up the the Gulf there right towards us and the weather prophets were all glued to the radio and we're listening and they're telling us where it's gonna hit and we're moving an inch to the left or an inch to the right trying to get out of the way and the thing that would always either turn them to the left or the right was another storm way back over here somewhere another a higher wind it takes a higher wind to turn that storm it takes a higher wind to turn the store and you know we we always wanted to think ourselves very spiritual let me show you how spiritual we were for all those years we would sit there in Navarre we lived right out on the coast not for not just a few miles off of the coast and we'd sit there and those storms would be coming up they'd be coming up the Gulf and they'd be racing right towards us and we'd all be praying Lord turn that devil away from us and we'd be holding on because we didn't want our fences to blow down and a rooster be gone we didn't want it and we'd be praying and we'd be we was sure it was of the devil well everybody be saying turn that turn that devil away from us well I remember one year it turned and it went in over in New Orleans remember the big woman went in you know what everybody was saying that was God judge in New Orleans for all that filth and sodomy the same folks that was turning the devil just before was now saying it was of the Lord the same storm we're not spiritual at all we're situational Christians and I only bring that up for this point whenever you see a brother or sister struggling or having a battle or a fight we always want to be the first ones to race to the front of the class say I know why it's happened to ma'am he must be doing something wrong you gotta have something wrong in his life and not knowing that it could be the tender handed Jehovah leaning a little bit closer at the atrocities that was taken out on the Jewish people and have a prophet come along in our day and tell us that that was the tender hand of Joe leading them back to the promised land you're not gonna find that on a holocaust memorial wall because of the atrocity the look of it the atrocity of it the the apparent but in the mind of God he he's the one in fact the Prophet goes on to tell us it takes a higher wind to turn that storm and we all know that we've got an oncoming storm and the only wind that I know that can turn that storm will be the rushing wind that fell on the day of a rushing mighty wind is an answer to that storm that's coming your way it goes on talking about communism it takes a higher wind it takes a higher storm a greater wind to turn and this is what Paul found in his day they they the men let loosen that in that journey they suppose they had found their purpose but God brought in a higher wind called you Rock LaDonna when you see your brother or your sister what kind of instructions that we've been given I know this sounds so simple and plain but what kind of instructions have we been given through the word and through this message but when you see a brother or a sister struggling beat down beat up battered and bruised and tired don't rush to the head of the class and declare I know why that happened don't be the first to don't push him under it was the instructions we were given don't take a stick and try to push him under give him a helping hand and lifting back helping through that journey it could be a storm that's in his life that's come his way that he's fighting we all want we'd all want that rapture and faith we all want faith to move a mountain we want faith to move a tree I want to have faith for you and i for my beleaguered and beat-up brother you know I'm gonna stand with our prophet in one state but he said if you tell me you're a Christian I'm gonna believe that I'm gonna accept that but he said I'm gonna watch for the word to keep growing in your life and feeding you and bringing you along the way I'll tell you brothers and sisters we've got an oncoming storm there is another we have an area of time ahead of us we hear the atrocities of it we read about what it looks like it could be closing up the buildings shutting down our sanctuaries us meeting in our homes a time of pressure a time of the mark of the beast the squeeze the pressure that's gonna come on the church if you go back and look almost every time the prophet referred to those oncoming storm this pressure that the church would be under he always had a little caveat right there at the end you know what it was watch that third pull then when you see this happening when you see this happening what you see manifested temporarily will be manifested in this fullness then watch it then watch it win when that storm is on when the pressure is on when the trust stress is on when the tribulations is on trouble is we got folks running around now trying to manifest it before the time we had a felon in Florida there what time he came over from Alabama and he was visiting us and we had foot washing that night and it was pouring down buckets I mean one of the biggest rain storms you could ever been in and and he took it upon himself to almost announced to us that he was going outside because our sisters had to go out of the church building and go over to a fellowship hall for foot washing and he pretty well let us know that he was going to go out there and stop that storm for these so they could pass in safety so we all were all peeking through the windows we want to see what this fellas doing he's shaking this fist and he's been you know what he got out of it that night very wet what you got wet it's not something we're gonna be able to think or manufacture or fabricate it's when that pressure comes something's gonna come back to you then what you see manifested temporarily will show itself English noticing you're not gonna need to announce its residency in your life you don't need have time to call it brother Jack say you're knocking I gotta need me to do this you're just gonna speak and it's gonna I believe it I believe that's the kind of power that rests in this church but sometimes it takes those you Rockland odds to manifest sometimes it takes those pressures it takes those tribulations sometimes we have the word of a prophet that tells us a man will come into your church and he'll sit under the meekness and the quietness and then you'll begin to shoot that poison stuff I tell you we've already been told they'll be able to drink anything deadly thing and it won't harm them I'm not worried about that poison [Music] we're looking for a show of rapturing faith we're not looking for a show of third pulp our looking for to to learn of it now to taste of it now to witness of it now to know what it is and in its time in this season it will be there man nobody may even know about it but you I know the biggest thing in my years are growing up in the message the pastor we had it's all he ever talked about it just can't wait for the day when I speak food on the table it's a promise I believe it if your family needs food and you can't buy or sell and the mark of the beast is on I believe that I believe the privilege of that will be there if that's what God's portion for you is but I ask my own family and our church at home there one time I said let's just suppose that there is no food and God just don't let you get hungry she's not as supernatural is it I know I know there's something about Daniel going on around here now this he was explaining it to me as he explained it I was glad I lived in Wichita but I admire y'all for people to do that I was shared with him some things that brother Brown said about Daniel during that time he wouldn't eat of the Kings meat he didn't want the finer things he wanted a pulse right that's all he wanted to eat you know what the Prophet said he got fatter than all the rest on following what was in his heart to do it we're away he said if one place he said the buttons was popping off of his robe don't you see brothers and sisters we serve a mighty we it's just we got to stop figuring out how he's gonna do it that's that's always been our trouble Lord how I want to get saved how am I gonna do well we had so many preachers you gotta come down an altar you got a you got to do this you got to do that you got it you got you know there's no there's no formula there is no pattern there is no certain way that everybody has to come there is one way and that's through the blood of Jesus Christ but we were taught through our Pentecostal years that you got to come to an altar you got to do this and we we help people remember is helping people speak in tongues we help people you know I've been through all this yeah I've been kneeling down in an altar now got one fell on one side of me yelling in my ear hang on hang on hang on hang on I got another down this side he's hollering turn loose turn loose turn loose give up one guys want me to hang on the other guys want me to turn loose how can I do both it's because of traditions we have traditions made up our minds if I have a grievance with with youth camps youth camps have to go through the same scenario every year I actually stood in a youth camp in Ohio I used to preach him and I stood in the youth camp under a tent before meeting one night and it was a Thursday night usually the the big the big the climax is the last night I actually stood there and the brother that was going to be preaching that night asked the host pastor a question and I've never hardly felt more offended by hearing that then I hear in this question he asked me says do you want the climax to be tonight or do you want to wait until Saturday night when another brother is preaching I walked away I couldn't even fathom a question like that what is his climax in his mind is his ability to stir and drum up and and build an emotion or a crescendo I walked away in my heart and I said God why don't you decide what night why don't you pick the night that you want the climax of the meeting to be sometimes we've done churched ourselves so long we've we've lost sight of what God wants God leads his dear children some through the waters some through the flood some through the fire but all through the blood don't ever let anybody else short change your path of life I know brother Moore sunburn a dear friend of mine I still go by what's with the remnants of his little church there Memphis when I go and one thing the Prophet told him he was kindly lamenting he didn't do this in his life brother Brad said never look back on your life and be disappointed at what God led you through he brought you through it he taught you a lesson through it don't ever grumble and moan and complain about this happened or that happen every one of them was a life lesson for you just come out on the other what would I have done things different now that sure we all we can't help but being human I've had brothers say things to me in my young days of the ministry that I didn't have an answer for I wish they would come and ask me now I've learned a little better answer than what I had back then but I'm saying to you brothers and sisters God leads us and in the time when this when that storm is coming against us the answer to it will be there one thing about about this storm that hit the ship the Yurok Ladon when it came his way and I'm almost done let's have a musicians come several musicians come as they will when you rock Ladon hit that boat if you go back to the book of Acts you'll find there that you know there was 276 people on the boat how many of you knew that 276 people and the scripture accords for us that all hope was gone that means Paul was the only one among them there wasn't nobody else on the boat thought they were gonna get out of it except Paul and he came down and he stood in the face of those other 275 men I mean if you go back and read the history of it they were trying to jump out of the boat and they were letting down the life rafts trying to get away Paul told the Centurion said if these guys get off of the boat we're all gonna be lost we're all supposed to hang on we're gonna hit up on this island over here of course when Paul walked ashore unharmed everybody thought he was it he was of the devil you know that they thought he was a demon that come among them how could a man live through a storm like that he's out picking up some sticks for the fire and the snake bit his hand and they thought he was of God must be a god that's what I'm telling you about being spiritual and knowing wouldn't which way the winds blowing not always doing though you can't base it on what you see but here they came though it says all hope all hope was gone all hope the storm was that aggressive 14 days and 14 nights I think it blew no stars no Sun just nothing but soon it was called you rock LaDonna you know the trouble with most storms that we face in our life is we even take time to name them I tried to get to that point earlier we try to name them this is what's wrong with me that's what's wrong with me try to put a handle on it put a name on it if I had more money this wouldn't happen if I had more prestige that wouldn't happen if I had a better car this wouldn't happen if I God leads his dear children mommy we try to put a name on it we won't identified rather than look to the deliverer in the midst of the storm quit trying to name your troubles don't try to put a name on it might find you it's like I said he might be throwing a brother or sisters name on there she's the problem he's the pastor's the problem tragically too many churches have their pastor for lunch when they go and I don't mean over for fried chicken either I mean they they having for lunch when they get home on Sunday if he comes up limping next week you know somebody did a big bite out he's just a man too all hope was gone you know what Paul came down he said I got one thing to tell you be of good cheer how can you be of good cheer in that kind of a storm because he said as long as we all remain ship I must go to Rome you're riding with a man that's got a his journey mapped out I must go before Caesar as long as you stay in the boat there gonna be no lives lost be of good cheer you know the first time that God told him he was going to Rome you know what the very words the angel told him two years before that Paul be of good cheer because you must go before Caesar he told him that two years before this this accident happened with the boat and there's Paul rehearsing those same words to be of good cheer when the storms come when the raging seas around about you just hang on
