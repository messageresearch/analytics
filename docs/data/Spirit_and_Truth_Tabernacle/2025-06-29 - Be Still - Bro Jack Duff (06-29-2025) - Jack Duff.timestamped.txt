[0:00] God has Yes, he has smiled on me.
[0:08] He has set me free.
[0:17] God
[0:18] has
[0:20] he has smiled on me.
[0:25] He's been good.
[0:29] to me. Let's sing it one more time. Say,
[0:32] "God has God
[0:36] has
[0:38] he has smiled on me.
[0:43] He has set me free.
[0:52] God
[0:54] has
[0:55] he has smiled on me.
[1:01] He's been good
[1:05] to me.
[1:09] Say, "God
[1:11] has
[1:14] smiled on me.
[1:19] He has set me free.
[1:24] Our God has
[1:27] God
[1:29] has He has smiled on me.
[1:36] He's been good. He's been good. He's
[1:41] been
[1:43] Oh, God's been good.
[1:47] He's been so good.
[1:51] God has been good.
[1:56] Won't
[1:58] to me.
[2:03] Praise the Lord.
[2:06] Hallelujah.
[2:07] Amen. We all have that testimony.
[2:10] Hallelujah. I don't care what you've
[2:11] been through. God saw you through it.
[2:15] Amen. Let's turn to Psalms 119.
[2:19] We'll start at verse 89. It's good to
[2:21] see each one of you. It's good to be
[2:23] back in the house of the Lord. Amen. You
[2:27] I know every time I come into the house
[2:29] of the Lord, I leave blessed. Amen. So,
[2:32] I know there's a blessing that's coming.
[2:35] It's in store. Hallelujah.
[2:37] Amen. Praise the Lord. Before we read
[2:41] this, there's a
[2:43] there's a word in this this psalm.
[2:47] I think it's a key that once you get an
[2:50] understanding of this word, this psalm
[2:52] will mean a little more to you. It's the
[2:53] word precept. I thought I knew what
[2:56] precept means, but it says in the Bible,
[2:58] a precept
[3:00] generally generally refers to a
[3:02] commandment, instruction or principle
[3:05] intended as a rule of action or conduct.
[3:08] Ex it signifies a divide guideline given
[3:12] by God to direct the behavior of his
[3:14] people. Amen. And I think that's
[3:17] something special especially coming from
[3:19] David when we saw him in the younger
[3:21] part of his life. It always said that he
[3:24] behaved himself wisely. Amen. So as we
[3:27] read this keep that definition in your
[3:29] mind. Praise the Lord.
[3:33] Says forever oh Lord thy word is settled
[3:36] in heaven.
[3:38] Thy faithfulness is is unto all
[3:40] generations. Thou hast established the
[3:43] earth and it abideth. They continue this
[3:47] day according to thine ordinances. For
[3:49] all are thy ser servants. Unless thy law
[3:53] had been my delights, I should then have
[3:55] perished in mine affliction.
[3:57] I will never forget thy precepts.
[4:01] For with them thou hast quickened me.
[4:03] his precepts. His guideline for your
[4:06] behavior has quickened me. I am thine.
[4:10] Save me, for I have sought thy precepts.
[4:13] I have sought thy divine guidelines for
[4:16] my behavior.
[4:18] The wicked have waited for me to destroy
[4:20] me, but I will consider thy testimonies.
[4:23] Amen. I've seen you work in others. I
[4:26] need you to work in me.
[4:28] I have seen an end of all perfection,
[4:31] but thy commandment is exceeding broad.
[4:34] Amen. Let's bow our hearts. Heavenly
[4:36] Father, we have entered these gates once
[4:39] again, Lord, to give praise to the
[4:41] mighty one in our midst, the Almighty
[4:44] God. Father, you have done marvelous
[4:46] things in times of old, Lord, but we've
[4:49] seen you move mightily in our midst,
[4:51] Lord. And father, no doubt your people
[4:53] have entered these gates, Lord Jesus,
[4:56] Father, with different situations and
[4:58] circumstances in their lives that they
[5:00] need your your leadership and your
[5:02] guidance. And Lord, they need you to
[5:05] help. So, Father God, we ask, Almighty
[5:07] God, speak through your servant this
[5:09] morning. Meet us at the point of our
[5:11] needs. Almighty God, Father, and as we
[5:14] lift up our voices in praise, Lord God.
[5:16] Oh, Father, when the praises go up, your
[5:18] blessings come down. We don't just want
[5:20] the blessings. We want you, Father. We
[5:23] want you to enter into this place and
[5:24] fill our vessels, Lord. We need more of
[5:27] you, Lord. Forgive us of all wrongs,
[5:29] Lord. Every sin, every iniquity, Lord,
[5:31] that we may stand before you perfected
[5:34] by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[5:36] pure and clean, Lord Jesus. For you are
[5:38] a holy God, Lord. You want to dwell in
[5:41] holy people, Lord, that you have made
[5:42] holy with your righteousness. So,
[5:44] Father, we ask you to move, Lord. have
[5:47] your way in this service, Lord, as we
[5:49] commit ourselves to you. It's in Jesus
[5:52] Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. Let's

[41:58] minister coming on, Brother Gideon,
[42:00] that's coming on Wednesday.
[42:03] Is it the 16th? Okay. Also on Sunday the
[42:08] 13th, Brother JZ. Brother JZ, we got two
[42:13] ministers coming to us from Nigeria
[42:17] and uh we're happy to have them come to
[42:21] see us. There's many places that they
[42:23] could go uh but they wanted to come and
[42:27] see Spirit and Truth Tabernacle. So, uh
[42:30] we thank God uh for that musicians.
[42:33] Thank y'all so much. Appreciate y'all.
[42:36] Amen. We're grateful for you.
[42:41] Amen. We also thank God for the specials
[42:43] that went forth this morning, Sister
[42:45] Shalom and Sister Tina.
[42:49] Amen. We
[42:51] appreciate the Lord Jesus.
[42:54] Uh if you could just grab your Bibles,
[42:57] uh we will read a
[43:03] um a scripture
[43:05] and um
[43:11] uh the the scripture may not seem to go
[43:13] well with my title, but but nonetheless,
[43:17] we trust the Holy Spirit to just bring
[43:19] this all together. Amen. Um, I'm
[43:25] going to the book of Luke, chapter uh 23
[43:31] and starting at verse 27.
[43:34] Amen. Luke 23 and starting at verse 27.
[43:41] Amen.
[43:43] The scripture says, "And they followed
[43:45] him, and there followed him a great
[43:48] company of people and of women, which
[43:52] also bewailed and lamented him." But
[43:55] Jesus turning unto them, said,
[43:58] "Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for
[44:00] me, but weep for yourselves and for your
[44:04] children. Uh for behold, the days are
[44:07] coming in the which they shall say,
[44:09] "Blessed are the barren, and the wounds
[44:11] that never bear, and the paps which
[44:14] never gave suck." Uh then shall they
[44:17] begin to say to the mountains fall on
[44:19] us, and to the hills cover us. For if
[44:22] they do these things in a green tree,
[44:27] what shall be done in the dry? And there
[44:31] were also two other malfactors led with
[44:35] him to be put to death. And when they
[44:38] were come to the place which is called
[44:41] Calvary, uh there they crucified him and
[44:45] the malfactors, one on the right hand
[44:49] and the other on the left.
[44:52] Then said Jesus, "Father,
[44:55] forgive them for they know not what they
[44:59] do." And they parted his reignment and
[45:02] cast lots. And the people stood
[45:06] beholding.
[45:07] And the rulers also with them derided
[45:11] him, saying, "He saved others. Let him
[45:15] save himself. If he be Christ, the
[45:18] chosen of God." And this is where our
[45:21] inspiration's coming from this verse. He
[45:23] saved others. Uh let him save himself if
[45:28] he be Christ. the chosen of God. And the
[45:31] soldiers also mocked him, coming to him
[45:34] and offering him vinegar and said, "If
[45:38] thou be the king of the Jews,
[45:42] save thyself."
[45:44] And a superscription
[45:46] uh also was written over him in letters
[45:48] of Greek and Latin and Hebrew. This is
[45:50] the king of the Jews. I'll just uh go a
[45:54] little further because this statement
[45:55] keep being made. Um in verse 39 it says
[45:59] and one of the malfactors which were
[46:01] hang railed on him saying if thou be
[46:04] Christ.
[46:06] Um save thyself
[46:10] and us. Uh but the other answering
[46:13] rebuked him saying not thou fear God
[46:18] seeing thou art in the same condemnation
[46:21] and we indeed justly but we receive the
[46:24] due reward of our deeds. But this man
[46:28] have done nothing a miss.
[46:31] Amen. And he it goes on to say and he
[46:33] said
[46:35] unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou
[46:39] comest into thy kingdom. And Jesus said
[46:43] unto him, verily I say unto thee, today
[46:46] thou shalt be with me in paradise. Amen.
[46:51] The Lord added a blessing to the reading
[46:52] of his word. Uh let's just bow in a word
[46:55] of prayer. Father, we are grateful
[46:58] for the privilege to gather in the house
[47:00] of the Lord. And as we gather, we
[47:04] realize there are many that come with
[47:06] various needs here to the house of God.
[47:10] And Lord, our prayer is that you would
[47:11] meet every need. Uh it starts
[47:14] spiritually. The need has to be met
[47:16] spiritually first and then it flows uh
[47:20] through the other areas of our life. So,
[47:21] I pray that you'd help us to tune in and
[47:24] hear what the spirit is speaking to us
[47:26] through uh these words that have been
[47:28] read. Um, and God, we just ask that it
[47:31] would come alive and live in every
[47:34] heart. Father, we take control over
[47:36] every spirit that's against the spirit
[47:37] of God uh at this time and ask that you,
[47:40] Father, would be glorified and magnified
[47:42] in our midst. Thank you for everything
[47:44] that's happened thus far in the service.
[47:46] But Lord, now Lord, we come to the most
[47:48] important aspect and that's the word of
[47:51] God. So Lord, make the difference in our
[47:53] lives. Not just those present, but those
[47:55] that are listening online, those that
[47:57] will listen later. In Jesus' name we
[47:59] pray. Amen. Amen. God bless. You can be
[48:03] seated. Amen. Um I'm taking for a title
[48:07] today. Be still. Amen. Be still. Praise
[48:13] the Lord. Amen. And then just allow me
[48:16] uh for a little bit just to coast uh to
[48:20] get into um the uh to get into this
[48:24] topic. I want to read uh from the
[48:29] greatest battle ever fought. Now it is
[48:33] um uh
[48:36] it is a a a fact
[48:39] um that everybody in here is going
[48:42] through something. Amen. Everybody got
[48:45] some trial. Everybody got some test. Uh,
[48:50] everybody got something that they
[48:52] dealing with. Sometimes it's financial.
[48:55] Uh, sometimes it's physical. Uh,
[48:58] sometimes it's mental. Sometimes it's
[49:00] spiritual. I mean, you name it, we all
[49:03] got something that we dealing with.
[49:05] Amen. And we need God. We simply need
[49:08] God. We We can't do this without God.
[49:12] And uh the often times when you're
[49:14] sitting there uh depending on God to
[49:17] move, what God tells you to do is just
[49:21] be still.
[49:23] Be still. And and and and and so help.
[49:26] We we just pray the Lord will help us
[49:28] through this. But uh the greatest battle
[49:30] ever fought um the prophet makes a
[49:33] statement. It says, "This great first
[49:35] battle that was ever fought began in
[49:39] heaven when Michael and his angels
[49:41] fought against Lucifer and his angels.
[49:45] It first started, the first battle was
[49:47] in heaven. So sin did not originate on
[49:51] earth. It originated in heaven. He says
[49:55] uh and then it was thrown down from
[49:58] heaven, cast out of heaven to the earth
[50:02] and fell on human beings. And he says
[50:06] then the battle from angels
[50:09] become human battles. Amen. So your
[50:13] battles are actually happening in a
[50:15] spiritual realm. And therefore you have
[50:18] to use uh spiritual weapons to overcome
[50:21] in this realm. And I want to tell you,
[50:24] uh, if if if if Satan can be cast out of
[50:26] heaven, he can also be cast out of your
[50:28] situation.
[50:30] Glory
[50:32] to God. You just got to know who's
[50:33] living on the inside of you. Amen.
[50:36] Praise God. He says this, then the
[50:39] battles from angels become human battles
[50:42] and Satan come to destroy God's
[50:46] creation. Uh, what God had created to be
[50:48] for himself. He had Satan come to
[50:51] destroy this. And that's what his
[50:54] purpose was was to destroy it. So that's
[50:56] that's the devil's purpose is to try to
[50:59] steal, kill, and destroy.
[51:02] Oh my. Hallelujah. Says, "Then the
[51:05] battle began here on earth and began in
[51:08] us and has been raging ever since." So
[51:12] we all been in a battle. We realize that
[51:15] uh you know and when we look at this
[51:17] this this this statement that the
[51:19] prophet's making here that it started in
[51:21] heaven but it come down to earth. We saw
[51:25] uh you know a battle. Oh let me uh also
[51:28] just mention this uh my my title is uh
[51:31] be still but I have a little inspiration
[51:34] of oneuped
[51:37] oneuped. All right. So, if you hear me
[51:39] using that a little bit, that's my
[51:41] little inspiration. Uh, one up. But here
[51:44] we we we we see a battle that started in
[51:47] heaven. Uh, uh, Satan, you know, uh,
[51:50] pulling majority of the angels to try
[51:53] to, you know, get on his side because he
[51:54] wants to get more glory than God. Um,
[51:57] you know, and and and and you know, this
[52:00] this battle that starts there is is it's
[52:02] cast out of heaven. It comes to earth.
[52:04] We find it in the Garden of Eden. God
[52:06] has his two uh uh I mean his man and his
[52:10] woman there. I mean this was God's
[52:12] perfect creation uh when he created Adam
[52:15] and uh just took that rib out of Adam's
[52:16] side. But now he has this this perfect
[52:18] condition in the Garden of Eden. But
[52:20] Satan comes into the Garden of Eden and
[52:22] his job is to destroy what God has
[52:25] placed there. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[52:28] And uh he knew he could not get Adam. So
[52:31] he he went straight he went straight at
[52:33] Eve and uh and he began to work these uh
[52:37] uh emotions and and all kind of other
[52:40] things that he started working with Eve
[52:42] and and look Eve didn't fall in just one
[52:44] day. This was a conversation that
[52:47] happened over time. Amen. And just days
[52:50] and days go by and they just keep having
[52:52] this conversation till they finally work
[52:54] her and and get something in her mind
[52:57] and and when she get into her mind she
[52:59] she she she thinks she got a better
[53:01] revelation than Adam. Right. She thinks
[53:04] she got a better revelation than Adam
[53:05] and and don't realize that it's the
[53:07] devil behind the serpent that is
[53:09] tricking her to do the things that she's
[53:11] about to do. Yes, sir. Amen. Hallelujah.
[53:14] Glory to God. And and we know the
[53:17] scripture. We know that there was a
[53:19] great fall, amen, there in the garden.
[53:21] It was not the eating of some physical
[53:24] fruit, but Amen. It was uh it was
[53:27] adultery that took place in the garden.
[53:30] Eve had uh committed a sexual act with
[53:33] the serpent. Amen. And and and then she
[53:36] took this that she learned and
[53:38] introduced it to Adam. My God. Look like
[53:41] the devil's winning, my friends. It
[53:44] certainly look like the devil's winning
[53:46] with this. His job was to destroy and
[53:49] man he has totally interrupted
[53:52] everything God put because he heard God
[53:54] make a tell tell Adam and Eve will tell
[53:56] Adam and Adam had to tell Eve he say now
[53:59] the day to eat you eat thereof that's
[54:02] the day you die destruction sir
[54:08] Satan say oh my okay um I got Eve to do
[54:13] this I got Eve to also take this over
[54:16] here Adam now God, let's look back and
[54:18] see what you going to do.
[54:22] He thought he had God in checkmate.
[54:26] But in Genesis 3:15,
[54:29] as God is giving out all the punishments
[54:32] to everybody that's involved,
[54:34] uh, Adam gets a punishment. Uh, he's
[54:37] going to work from the sweat of his brow
[54:39] and and have to teal the the the ground
[54:41] and all these things. And and the
[54:43] serpent gets uh taken. He he he loses
[54:46] his his feet.
[54:48] Hallelujah.
[54:50] And he's cast on his belly. That's
[54:52] right. Right. And Eve has to bring forth
[54:55] children in hard labor. Right. But but
[54:58] in the midst of all of this, God makes a
[55:01] promise.
[55:03] And I like to say it like this. He
[55:04] oneups the devil.
[55:08] Hallelujah. Yes. In Genesis 3:15, he
[55:11] says, "And I will put enmity
[55:14] between thee and the woman and between
[55:16] thy seed and her seed." And and we
[55:20] realize the woman does not carry seed.
[55:23] The woman carries an egg. Amen. It's the
[55:26] It's the man that carries the seed or
[55:28] the sperm. So, so, so, so, so, so when
[55:31] when when we look at this scripture and
[55:33] it's talking about a woman having a
[55:35] seed, then this could speak of no one
[55:37] else than the Lord Jesus Christ. Because
[55:40] he's the only one that was born of a
[55:42] woman, hallelujah, that did not require
[55:45] sexual intercourse, virgin born son of
[55:49] God. Hallelujah. I will put enmity
[55:53] between thee and the woman and between
[55:56] thy seed and her seat. It shall bruise
[55:58] thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel.
[56:03] Here uh we find that God would bruise
[56:05] the head of Satan through the death, the
[56:07] burial and the resurrection of our Lord
[56:09] and Savior Jesus Christ. And uh God
[56:12] himself took on the flesh of man. He
[56:15] made us righteous through his
[56:16] sacrificial act on the cross and there
[56:19] he bruised his enemy. Right? So this
[56:23] battle uh that that started in heaven is
[56:26] now on earth. We have to understand the
[56:28] prophet tells us that if there's going
[56:30] to be a battle, then there has to be a
[56:33] battleground. Yes, sir. Blessed be the
[56:36] name of the Lord. You just can't say
[56:38] we're going to have a battle and have no
[56:39] battleground. We got to meet somewhere.
[56:43] Amen. Amen. To fight this thing out, we
[56:46] got to meet somewhere.
[56:48] And and God decided for the
[56:50] battleground. Amen. Where the prophet
[56:52] says the human mind was chosen for the
[56:56] place of the battle where it was to
[56:58] begin. And that is because uh decisions
[57:02] are made from the mind.
[57:06] So, so, so we we're we're all in a
[57:08] battle. And it's something that's there
[57:10] in the mind. But I'm here to tell you
[57:12] this morning, I don't care what battle
[57:14] you in, be still.
[57:21] Glory to God. Be still.
[57:26] Your mind going here and it's racing
[57:28] over there. You don't know which way to
[57:30] turn. I'm telling you what to do this
[57:33] morning. Be still.
[57:42] Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[57:46] Please let me coast just a little bit.
[57:51] The the the prophet says in the message
[57:54] when their eyes were open.
[57:56] Oh glory.
[57:58] Amen. Amen. And when their eyes were
[58:01] open, hallelujah, it says, how many read
[58:04] the sermon, when omnipotence speaks,
[58:09] miracles happen.
[58:11] It says, did you you believe that?
[58:13] Certainly. Omnipotent spoke at every
[58:16] junct at at at every junction. It says,
[58:19] "And when the church cooled off uh and
[58:22] then omnipotence spoke, miracles take
[58:25] place. And this is the junction of all
[58:27] junctions. This is the end time. The end
[58:31] of the whole history of the world is
[58:33] right now at hand.
[58:36] So you can expect
[58:40] I mean uh uh uh modern events are made
[58:45] clear by prophecy. And the prophet is
[58:49] telling us here that that this is the
[58:50] the end of the whole history of the
[58:54] world. And he says it's right now at
[58:58] hand.
[58:59] We we know that's nothing but the truth.
[59:01] He says so you can expect
[59:05] my God omnipotence to speak and you can
[59:10] expect
[59:11] the greatest
[59:14] and mightiest miracles that ever
[59:17] happened on the earth will happen in the
[59:19] next few years to come. Oh my. I want to
[59:23] there's a that's a prophecy. I want I
[59:25] want us to make sure we get that. You
[59:27] ain't got to be afraid of nothing, but
[59:29] you can be under expectation for
[59:31] something. And what you can expect is
[59:34] the greatest and mightiest miracles
[59:38] that's ever happened on the earth will
[59:41] happen in the next few years to come.
[59:45] Yes, sir. Boy, big things getting ready
[59:47] to happen. We we looking at sometimes we
[59:51] get our eyes on what the devil is doing,
[59:53] but it's time to get our eyes on what
[59:55] God is doing. Big things are about to
[59:59] happen.
[1:00:01] Amen. And let me just make it personal.
[1:00:04] Big things for me are about to happen.
[1:00:09] Great things for me are about to happen.
[1:00:14] Amen. Glory to God. He says you can
[1:00:18] expect the greatest and mightiest
[1:00:19] miracles that's ever happened on the
[1:00:21] earth will happen in the next few years
[1:00:23] to come. If Jesus terries, it will be.
[1:00:27] It says this now then watch for Satan to
[1:00:31] raise up his tooth.
[1:00:33] When all heaven turns loose,
[1:00:37] all hell turns loose too. and is
[1:00:40] prophesied that there be a Janice and a
[1:00:43] Jambas on the earth in the last days who
[1:00:45] would almost impersonate the real thing
[1:00:47] so close it'll deceive the very elect if
[1:00:50] possible. So we're looking for all of
[1:00:52] that. Amen. And and I just love this
[1:00:55] promise that when we see all hell turn
[1:00:58] loose,
[1:01:00] brother. We got to expect all heaven.
[1:01:02] Yes, sir. We got to expect all heaven.
[1:01:05] And I'm under expectation
[1:01:07] that the greatest and the mightiest
[1:01:09] miracles that ever happen will happen in
[1:01:12] the next few years. Glory to God. Let me
[1:01:15] give another one. Brother Jerry
[1:01:17] encouraged us. Amen. This week with a a
[1:01:21] quote that I want to just kind of put
[1:01:24] in. You know, I was um I was uh
[1:01:31] this sermon. Let me just say this. I I I
[1:01:34] I went back and looked at when I start
[1:01:36] doing the notes for this and it was
[1:01:39] September
[1:01:40] 2nd, 2019
[1:01:44] that I started doing notes on this
[1:01:45] oneuped
[1:01:47] and um and you know, as I was just going
[1:01:50] throughout the week because I I I have a
[1:01:52] a little something in my heart that I
[1:01:54] want to do and I'll probably get a
[1:01:55] chance to do it next week. Just trying
[1:01:57] to get the church prepared for our
[1:01:59] meetings and, you know, the inspiration
[1:02:01] behind that. And uh I just you know just
[1:02:04] some things I want to kind of share in
[1:02:05] that that direction. I said well uh Lord
[1:02:08] I thought this week would be the week
[1:02:09] that I would do. And I'm like no for
[1:02:11] some reason that's not the direction.
[1:02:14] And uh just little things start
[1:02:15] happening throughout the week. Uh and
[1:02:18] and and as it started happening I'm like
[1:02:20] okay I think this is the way that God
[1:02:22] wants us to go. And uh so one of these
[1:02:25] things is this quote that brother Jerry
[1:02:27] sent. And then I want to read that. And
[1:02:28] then I want to I want to uh uh I'm
[1:02:31] trying to just coast. I'm trying to
[1:02:32] coast. Uh but uh something else that I
[1:02:35] want to tell you that happened this week
[1:02:37] that got me to this. Be still. So let me
[1:02:39] coast. Y'all mind? Y'all don't mind.
[1:02:41] Right. All right. Uh in this message, be
[1:02:44] certain of God. I Now remember, we're
[1:02:46] all in a battle and the battleground is
[1:02:49] our mind. We're all going through
[1:02:52] something in in our minds. But but but
[1:02:54] when you're going through and you've
[1:02:56] been pulled in every direction, sometime
[1:02:59] you don't know which way to go, the best
[1:03:01] thing you can do is be still.
[1:03:04] Be still. Be still. Be still. Amen. God
[1:03:09] God is up to something. When when you
[1:03:11] get quiet and you get still, God, you
[1:03:13] give God something to work with.
[1:03:16] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:03:20] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Uh here here in
[1:03:24] this message be certain of God. It says
[1:03:27] then remember uh if he is uh his word
[1:03:32] has to be true. It says and if he
[1:03:35] required you to meet these circumstances
[1:03:37] and you did he's obligated to take care
[1:03:40] of his word. I I like this. Right. So,
[1:03:44] um, when you are, and if any, any of you
[1:03:47] ever heard this sermon, be certain of
[1:03:48] God, you know, Brother Brandham uses
[1:03:50] this just to encourage the believers.
[1:03:52] Uh, if you ever gone through a
[1:03:54] situation, especially a trial in your
[1:03:57] life where, man, Satan just got you even
[1:03:59] questioning whether you're a Christian.
[1:04:03] Well, you know, uh, if if he loved you,
[1:04:06] then this would happen. And if he loved
[1:04:08] you, then that would happen. you done
[1:04:10] paid your tithes and you done did this
[1:04:12] and you done did that and look at you
[1:04:15] devil just just working your mind
[1:04:19] and and this is where brother Brandham
[1:04:20] says when you get into a moment like
[1:04:22] that you got to be certain of God so not
[1:04:26] not not sometime it's not being certain
[1:04:28] of you but it's being certain of God hey
[1:04:31] I know he made me a promise when he
[1:04:34] going to bring that promise to pass I
[1:04:35] can't tell you that but I do know he
[1:04:37] made me a promise and it will come to
[1:04:39] pass. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Sometimes
[1:04:42] you got to look at uh look at your trial
[1:04:44] and say uh uh this came to pass.
[1:04:48] Hallelujah.
[1:04:49] This trial came to pass. That mean I'm
[1:04:54] I'mma get I'mma get through this. I'm
[1:04:55] going to get over this because this came
[1:04:58] to pass.
[1:05:00] That's right. Glory to God. You got to
[1:05:03] learn to be certain of God in and and in
[1:05:05] in these difficult situations that you
[1:05:07] face. It says then remember if if he is
[1:05:10] his word has to be true and if he
[1:05:12] required you to meet these circumstances
[1:05:14] and you did he's obligated to take care
[1:05:17] of his word. Don't back off and say oh I
[1:05:20] I'll never get healed. Oh you poor weak
[1:05:23] faith don't believe that if everything
[1:05:27] is confessed
[1:05:28] hallelujah and everything's out and you
[1:05:31] you met God's requirement faith
[1:05:35] holds right there. It says there's
[1:05:38] nothing will move it. He is and you're
[1:05:41] sure. Not he was, not he will be. He is
[1:05:46] and you're sure. Right. It says they
[1:05:48] that wait upon the Lord.
[1:05:51] My be still. They that wait upon the
[1:05:54] Lord shall renew their strength.
[1:05:57] Hallelujah. I pray God will put some
[1:05:59] spiritual vitamins in you today and your
[1:06:01] strength will be renewed.
[1:06:04] They shall renew their strength. They
[1:06:07] shall mount up with wings as of an
[1:06:09] eagle. They shall run and not be weary.
[1:06:14] They shall walk and shall not faint.
[1:06:17] Wait when you've met his requirements
[1:06:20] that brings your faith to a showdown. If
[1:06:23] you've met God's requirements and has
[1:06:25] been made or met and you have re you
[1:06:28] have fully considered it and you have
[1:06:30] done everything that God required you to
[1:06:32] do then your faith rests right there
[1:06:35] that he is
[1:06:37] be certain of God.
[1:06:39] He goes on to say it says you know he
[1:06:41] loves
[1:06:43] to test us.
[1:06:45] God loves this. God loves to test us.
[1:06:49] And and now you all you all know this is
[1:06:51] nothing but the truth. You think about
[1:06:52] the story of Job. I mean, it was God
[1:06:56] that suggested
[1:06:58] to Satan, have you considered
[1:07:02] that? That that let that let you know
[1:07:03] that God actually like the test.
[1:07:07] That's right.
[1:07:09] I mean, it and let me let me let me just
[1:07:11] let me just help you understand your
[1:07:14] story is an opportunity for his glory.
[1:07:21] Hallelujah. Hey, I say your story is an
[1:07:25] opportunity for his glory.
[1:07:29] So, he like doing these type of things.
[1:07:31] Amen. Just to see how we going to
[1:07:33] respond. Amen. Hallelujah. But he's what
[1:07:36] he's getting ready to do is get some
[1:07:38] glory out of what's going on here. Watch
[1:07:39] this now. Watch it. It says this. It
[1:07:42] says, "Did you know God likes he loves
[1:07:45] to he loves to see the reaction of your
[1:07:47] faith?" Did you know that God likes to
[1:07:50] see how you react when you say, "Oh
[1:07:52] Lord, I believe you. Thou art my savior.
[1:07:54] I believe that you are are the healer. I
[1:07:56] believe that you are the one who gives
[1:07:58] the Holy Spirit and the things that I'm
[1:08:00] requiring you are the God who gives
[1:08:02] that." And and then when you confess all
[1:08:04] your sins and promise God what you'll do
[1:08:06] if he'll let you get well, then because
[1:08:09] it don't happen, you run off like a
[1:08:11] coward somewhere. God can't use that.
[1:08:15] Look at this. It says there's no way for
[1:08:17] him to use you. There's no way for him
[1:08:19] to answer you because he only answers by
[1:08:21] faith. Then all of a sudden you go away
[1:08:24] and he can't answer. But real true faith
[1:08:26] stands there being sure that God is be
[1:08:29] certain that he is. Amen. And God seeks
[1:08:33] this thing to uh seeks this thing to be
[1:08:36] done to confess your sins and so forth.
[1:08:38] You've done it. Faith says that he is
[1:08:41] certain that it's going to happen. You
[1:08:43] you you you uh your request has to be
[1:08:46] granted. I hope you don't miss that. He
[1:08:49] said I hope you don't miss it. What he
[1:08:51] said that you shouldn't miss is your
[1:08:53] request
[1:08:55] has to be granted.
[1:08:57] Right. When you met all the conditions,
[1:09:00] you did everything God told you to do.
[1:09:02] Yes, sir. Ain't no I mean, you didn't
[1:09:03] live leave no stones unturned. Your
[1:09:06] request has to be granted. That's right.
[1:09:09] All right. He says, "If you're sure of
[1:09:11] God, God's sure of his word, he's only
[1:09:14] waiting to test you." This one up
[1:09:19] uh the definition of it is to have a
[1:09:22] psychological advantage over someone.
[1:09:25] And there's so many different examples,
[1:09:27] you know, of this, but I'll use um just
[1:09:31] basketball in one place. There's a um
[1:09:34] there's a game that we used to play when
[1:09:36] we played basketball and and um
[1:09:41] it was called uh uh horse
[1:09:45] and um and what it is is that you would
[1:09:47] do all these shots
[1:09:49] um you know you and you're trying to
[1:09:52] always best your opponent. So we might
[1:09:55] start with a little right-hand layup. If
[1:09:56] you right-handed, that was no problem.
[1:09:58] But if you was left-handed, that might
[1:10:00] have been an issue, right? And we go and
[1:10:03] run a a right-hand layup. And then,
[1:10:05] okay, you you did that. Now, I'm going
[1:10:07] to do a left-hand layup. And and then
[1:10:08] I'm going to do it a certain way. You
[1:10:09] got to dribble with your left hand to
[1:10:11] get there to do that left hand layup.
[1:10:13] Cuz some guys that were right-handed
[1:10:14] couldn't dribble with their left hand.
[1:10:16] And now, if you make it past that, okay,
[1:10:17] I'm going to pull you back just a little
[1:10:19] bit and we're going to just hit a a
[1:10:20] little small jump shot, right? And I'm
[1:10:22] always trying to one up and and if you
[1:10:24] miss that shot, you get the first letter
[1:10:26] H, right? Until we spell the word horse
[1:10:29] by you missing all these shots, uh, it
[1:10:32] means I won the game. So, and we just
[1:10:34] take it from one level to the next level
[1:10:35] to the next level. We're going to start
[1:10:37] with this little jump shot. I'mma take
[1:10:38] you to the foul line. Okay, you made
[1:10:40] that. Now, I'mma pull you back to the
[1:10:41] three-point line. Okay, you made that.
[1:10:43] I'mma take you to half court.
[1:10:46] Right? and and I'mma just keep moving
[1:10:48] all around the place and and until I get
[1:10:50] you to get all them letters because what
[1:10:52] you're trying to do is one up your your
[1:10:54] your opponent and you're trying to win
[1:10:56] that game. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And
[1:10:58] here here's here's what I I want you to
[1:11:00] understand that no matter what Satan
[1:11:02] brings into your life, God is always
[1:11:04] going to one up the devil.
[1:11:07] Amen. Amen. That's right. God gonna
[1:11:09] always one up him. He God will never be
[1:11:11] defeated.
[1:11:14] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. I mean,
[1:11:16] here's a I want to just kind of show um
[1:11:20] this man. Amen. Uh
[1:11:25] yeah, this this this out of the maniac
[1:11:27] of Gada. And this is a a a story about
[1:11:31] this man that the devil got just in
[1:11:34] complete bondage.
[1:11:36] Uh but but he don't realize when he
[1:11:38] brought the man into bondage once this
[1:11:40] man came into the presence of Jesus. It
[1:11:44] showed that bondage was not strong
[1:11:46] enough to hold him. That's exactly
[1:11:47] right. Oh hallelujah. I don't care what
[1:11:50] you're facing this morning. Amen. God
[1:11:53] wants to one up the devil in your
[1:11:55] situation.
[1:11:57] Woo. Hallelujah. Just to show the devil
[1:12:00] he does not have that kind of power. The
[1:12:02] power of God is more powerful than the
[1:12:05] power of the devil. Amen. Look at this
[1:12:08] in Maniac of Gadair. He says, "And I see
[1:12:10] him in his work as he was tossed there
[1:12:13] in the little old sea." He says, "If one
[1:12:15] soul was in need over there and and we
[1:12:18] never had record of anyone else being
[1:12:20] helped in that land of the Gatherines
[1:12:22] but this one maniac." He says, "Poor
[1:12:26] fellow. I think of him being out there
[1:12:28] in that condition perhaps one time a
[1:12:31] good citizen a good man right he says
[1:12:34] less dramatized a moment in his
[1:12:36] character I can imagine seeing him as a
[1:12:39] fine fellow right taking care of his
[1:12:42] home and and taking care of the bills
[1:12:44] and taking care of the family but
[1:12:46] something happened to this man's mind
[1:12:48] somewhere along the way it says I can
[1:12:50] imagine seeing him as a fine fellow but
[1:12:52] the first thing you know some of the
[1:12:54] crowd come along and got him to get away
[1:12:57] from church or go away from God. Right?
[1:13:00] It says next thing you know the devil
[1:13:02] had him on the next step. He started
[1:13:04] drinking. It says one drink, one devil.
[1:13:10] Hallelujah. Just kept on backsliding and
[1:13:13] going away. It says, "And after a while,
[1:13:15] the devil drove him insane."
[1:13:19] Hallelujah. It says, "And there the man
[1:13:21] was out there. He must have been a
[1:13:24] terrible character. He lived out there
[1:13:26] in those rough places and they bind him
[1:13:28] with feeders. He was twice his strength.
[1:13:31] He could break them little old fedters
[1:13:34] and move out just like there was nothing
[1:13:36] holding him. Even the army or the
[1:13:38] officers that would would bind him up,
[1:13:41] they he just break them apart and go on.
[1:13:43] He's a real rough
[1:13:46] he's a rough rough guy. It said brother
[1:13:48] Brandham say it wasn't his human
[1:13:50] strength. Right. Right. It wasn't this
[1:13:52] man human strength that did that that
[1:13:54] got him to this condition. He said it
[1:13:56] was the devil's strength that was doing
[1:13:58] that. So that mean the devil got power
[1:14:01] but God got greater power. Amen. This I
[1:14:06] mean look at the condition of this man.
[1:14:08] He was a solid man at one point in time
[1:14:09] but got going with the wrong crowd. Stop
[1:14:11] stopped going to church. Stop getting
[1:14:14] being in fellowship. Started drinking
[1:14:16] and every time he take a drink
[1:14:19] a devil step in him. And then maybe he
[1:14:22] start smoking.
[1:14:24] Another devil step in him. And then he
[1:14:26] start lying. Another devil. I mean, this
[1:14:28] man had so many devils. The Bible say he
[1:14:30] had 2,000 demons inside of him.
[1:14:35] Now, that looked like a really rough
[1:14:36] condition.
[1:14:38] But one man like that coming into the
[1:14:41] presence of Jesus,
[1:14:45] he get oneuped. Yes, sir.
[1:14:49] That's right.
[1:14:50] That's right. Look at this. Brother
[1:14:53] Brandham goes on to say, says it wasn't
[1:14:54] his human strength. It was the devil's
[1:14:56] strength that was doing that. And the
[1:14:58] devil is powerful, but God is more
[1:15:02] powerful. Hallelujah. Amen. I mean, when
[1:15:05] you look at your kids and you see how
[1:15:06] the devil done run rough shot, God is
[1:15:08] more powerful. You just keep remembering
[1:15:11] that. And he says, "Now I thought if a
[1:15:12] man completely surrendered to the devil
[1:15:14] would have two or three times his
[1:15:16] strength, what would a man do that was
[1:15:19] that that lay so weak he can't get up or
[1:15:21] crippled so so so bad that he can't get
[1:15:23] up? What will he do when the strength
[1:15:25] and power of God comes into him? How
[1:15:28] much more strength God has than the
[1:15:30] devil has?" That's right. I love that.
[1:15:34] When we're going through, there's this
[1:15:36] scripture
[1:15:38] in Psalms 46 that is very important and
[1:15:41] and you all know I've shared it many
[1:15:44] times. This is Psalms 46 is where my
[1:15:47] daughter wrote that song, though the
[1:15:48] oceans may roar and mountains be shaken,
[1:15:52] I'm not forsaken, you are with me. Every
[1:15:55] step that I take and uh I don't have to
[1:15:57] worry because you are with me. Right. uh
[1:16:00] she gets her inspiration from Psalm 46.
[1:16:02] But there there's something that that
[1:16:04] David tells us here and I'm going just
[1:16:06] read just verse 10. It's a very short
[1:16:08] chapter, but I just want to read verse
[1:16:09] 10 11. Um this is where our title comes
[1:16:13] from. When we're going through uh earth
[1:16:16] shaking and uh I mean just everything
[1:16:19] every seem like everything going wrong.
[1:16:21] Good God Almighty. This is a time where
[1:16:23] David tells us be still. Psalms 46:10,
[1:16:28] it says this, "Be still
[1:16:33] and know that I am God." Now, here's the
[1:16:36] here's the beautiful part to me.
[1:16:39] While you still,
[1:16:41] God says in the same verse, I will be
[1:16:47] exalted.
[1:16:48] I That does not mean he going to be
[1:16:50] defeated. He's not going to be defeated
[1:16:52] in you.
[1:16:54] I will be exalted among the heathen. I
[1:16:59] will be exalted in the earth. God wants
[1:17:01] to use your story for his glory. Yes,
[1:17:03] sir. The Lord of hosts is with us. The
[1:17:06] God of Jacob is our refuge. Salah. This
[1:17:10] week
[1:17:12] I was uh actually it was Friday. I was
[1:17:14] at home and was actually on the phone
[1:17:17] with my daughter and we were talking
[1:17:18] about a little something there and and
[1:17:20] uh and I say, "Hey, I got to go. I got
[1:17:22] another call coming in and um you know
[1:17:25] and typically if I'm talking to someone
[1:17:28] uh I won't just
[1:17:30] um excuse myself like that unless I feel
[1:17:33] like it's you know this this is a unique
[1:17:36] call and and and and I I need to I need
[1:17:39] to take this and when I'm looking at my
[1:17:41] call ID it says brother DJ Rudolph.
[1:17:48] So I told my I told my daughter said I
[1:17:49] got to go brother DJ calling me and I
[1:17:51] don't I he he don't call me like that so
[1:17:53] let me let me take this call. So I I I
[1:17:56] put her on you know I said I'll call you
[1:17:57] back. I didn't know how long I would be
[1:17:58] with with him. So he he he he calls me
[1:18:01] and he says brother Jack
[1:18:04] uh I know I ain't talked to you in a
[1:18:06] while but I just want to say God bless
[1:18:08] you and hi to you. And brother Jack I
[1:18:11] just want to say be still.
[1:18:16] They say, "Brother Jack, I don't know
[1:18:17] what you're going through, but I just
[1:18:19] want to tell you, be still."
[1:18:23] And I say, "Uh,
[1:18:26] I say, huh?" He started talking a little
[1:18:28] bit more and he he took me a little deep
[1:18:30] in the conversation. And DJ is a is is a
[1:18:34] real farmer by trait. I mean, by just
[1:18:36] that's that's his character. The man's a
[1:18:38] farmer. And he was telling me says it
[1:18:40] says um it says uh recently somebody
[1:18:43] given me some female chickens.
[1:18:46] And he says um it say now typically you
[1:18:49] know it's hard to get female chickens. I
[1:18:51] mean and when you get them they they
[1:18:53] cost more than the males. It says
[1:18:55] because you know the females have the
[1:18:57] ability to lay eggs, right? So so there
[1:19:00] there are things that they can do that
[1:19:01] the male can't do and and and so it's
[1:19:03] harder to get them and when you get them
[1:19:05] you got to you got to really take care
[1:19:06] of them. He says, "So he says, he says,
[1:19:08] I um they gave me these female chickens
[1:19:11] and you know when when you get the
[1:19:13] chickens, Brother Jack," he just broke
[1:19:14] it all down for me. He said, "I don't
[1:19:17] know nothing about all this." He said,
[1:19:18] "But when you get the chickens now, you
[1:19:20] just you just can't bring these female
[1:19:22] chickens and just sit them in the yard."
[1:19:24] He says, "Because they they'll try to
[1:19:25] fly away, right?" He say, they they're
[1:19:28] not used to the environment and things
[1:19:29] like that and and they're a little
[1:19:31] afraid of of what's going on. So he
[1:19:32] says, "So what I have to do is I have to
[1:19:34] clip their wings." Hallelujah.
[1:19:37] He start talking to He was preaching to
[1:19:40] me, y'all. He Brother DJ was preaching
[1:19:44] to me. And I said, "Go ahead now. Keep
[1:19:46] on talking, brother. Go ahead on." He He
[1:19:49] said, he say, he say, "You got to clip
[1:19:50] their wings." He say, "Nah, no, no." He
[1:19:52] said, he said, "Now, now like like like
[1:19:53] he said, like brother Sharm say, I'm not
[1:19:55] I'm not picking on you. I'm picking off
[1:19:58] you."
[1:20:00] Right? He he say so when I'm clipping
[1:20:02] the wings to say I'm not doing this to
[1:20:04] hurt the chicken. I'm actually doing
[1:20:06] this to help the chicken. He said
[1:20:08] because there's other things out there
[1:20:10] that want to destroy this chicken. If I
[1:20:12] let it fly that really can't fly that
[1:20:14] high and if it just get out my backyard
[1:20:17] then maybe a dog might get it or maybe a
[1:20:20] cat might get it and maybe even worse
[1:20:22] maybe a human might get it and put it in
[1:20:25] a plate.
[1:20:28] Amen.
[1:20:32] He says, "I got the chickens and I'm
[1:20:34] clipping their wings and they just
[1:20:36] jumping and they trying to get away from
[1:20:39] me." So, and and and what I what I have
[1:20:40] to tell the chicken is
[1:20:46] I kept telling the chicken, "Be still."
[1:20:49] He say, "I I just I just over and over
[1:20:52] just just be still. This is this is for
[1:20:54] your good. This this this going to help
[1:20:57] you out if you can just be still. Don't
[1:21:00] don't don't don't get flustered. Don't
[1:21:01] get frustrated. Don't try to run off
[1:21:03] here and run off there. No, no, no. Be
[1:21:05] still.
[1:21:09] See, as the farmer, I know what I'm
[1:21:10] doing. This going to be for for the
[1:21:12] chicken's betterment. If he can learn to
[1:21:15] just be still, it's going to help him
[1:21:16] out or help her out. It's not It's not
[1:21:18] going to damage. It's going to help her
[1:21:20] out. And as as believers, if we can
[1:21:22] learn that God got everything under
[1:21:24] control, all we need to do is just be
[1:21:28] still. Amen.
[1:21:34] I
[1:21:36] began to think about that and we just
[1:21:38] kept talking and fellowshipping and
[1:21:42] you know
[1:21:44] DJ said you know even Job had to be
[1:21:46] still.
[1:21:50] He said he said Moses
[1:21:54] Moses had to be still.
[1:21:58] He said
[1:22:01] them them Hebrew boys had to be still.
[1:22:05] Daniel
[1:22:08] had to be still. Every He just started
[1:22:10] going. He said he said he said he said
[1:22:12] Jesus
[1:22:14] oh my
[1:22:16] had to be still. And and and here's what
[1:22:19] I as as he was going through and I just
[1:22:21] began to process this. I said, you know,
[1:22:23] I when you when you come to that place
[1:22:25] where you're being still, God is up to
[1:22:29] something.
[1:22:30] Yes, sir. Amen. And here's the thing. I
[1:22:34] if if you if you if you get too uh too
[1:22:37] busy, you know, where you you here and
[1:22:39] you're there, you know, you you're not
[1:22:41] giving God an opportunity to work. But
[1:22:44] when you stealing and the devil can't
[1:22:46] figure out what you doing, when you
[1:22:48] begin to make the devil wonder what what
[1:22:51] you doing, why they should have acted
[1:22:53] that they should have responded this
[1:22:55] way, but they didn't respond. They they
[1:22:57] still in the presence of God and and the
[1:23:00] devil don't know where the hit getting
[1:23:01] ready to come from.
[1:23:04] But I'm telling you, God going to be
[1:23:05] exalted in your stillness.
[1:23:09] Can I say that again? God will be
[1:23:11] exalted
[1:23:13] in your stillness.
[1:23:17] As he said, Moses had to be still. It
[1:23:19] took me back to this scripture, Exodus
[1:23:21] 7.
[1:23:26] So, that that that that be still is I
[1:23:29] don't know what to do.
[1:23:31] I can't figure this out. I'm I done did
[1:23:35] everything I was supposed to do
[1:23:38] and now I'm I'm just lost.
[1:24:01] Your battery went dead. Get your next
[1:24:04] device.
[1:24:06] Be still.
[1:24:09] Be still. Don't don't don't What am I
[1:24:11] going to do now? No, I I had some
[1:24:13] backup. And you got backup.
[1:24:17] You got backup. All heaven is backing
[1:24:20] you up.
[1:24:22] God is backing you up. I mean, just
[1:24:25] calmly just get the next device.
[1:24:30] Praise the Lord.
[1:24:33] I went to um Exodus 7 and let's just
[1:24:36] read this verse and verse one says, "And
[1:24:39] the Lord said unto Moses, see I made
[1:24:42] thee a god to Pharaoh, and Aaron, thy
[1:24:44] brother shall be thy prophet." Now, this
[1:24:46] is this is these are big words. Yes,
[1:24:49] sir. I made you a god to Pharaoh. Wait a
[1:24:51] minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
[1:24:52] Lord, Pharaoh is the mightiest man in uh
[1:24:56] in in not just Egypt, but the whole
[1:24:58] world at that time. This man is the
[1:25:00] greatest man. And you telling you you
[1:25:03] telling me you made me a god to Pharaoh?
[1:25:10] And and you get Moses gets words like
[1:25:13] this from God and then goes through a
[1:25:15] tremendous trial. Oh Lord have mercy.
[1:25:19] After he gets these words, let's just
[1:25:20] read it.
[1:25:24] Thou shalt speak
[1:25:26] all that I command thee. And Aaron, thy
[1:25:28] brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that
[1:25:30] he send the children of Israel out of
[1:25:32] his land.
[1:25:33] And I will harden Pharaoh's heart and
[1:25:35] multiply my signs and my wonders in the
[1:25:38] land of Egypt. Now, notice notice what
[1:25:40] what God just said. I'm going to be the
[1:25:42] one to make this man say no. Right? I'm
[1:25:47] going to be the one to actually, you
[1:25:49] know, uh, cause this man not to even
[1:25:51] think properly. I'm going to be the one
[1:25:53] to do this to him. And and the reason
[1:25:55] I'm doing this because I want to
[1:25:56] multiply.
[1:25:58] I want to multiply. God want God want to
[1:26:01] get glory out of the story.
[1:26:05] Hallelujah. I'm going to multiply my
[1:26:07] signs and my wonders in the land of
[1:26:10] Egypt. They going to see things they
[1:26:11] never seen before.
[1:26:15] Look at this now. Next verse.
[1:26:18] But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you
[1:26:21] that I may lay my hand upon Egypt and
[1:26:23] bring forth my armies and my people, the
[1:26:26] children of Israel, out of the land of
[1:26:27] Egypt by my by by great judgments. And
[1:26:31] the Egyptians shall know that I am the
[1:26:34] Lord when I stretch forth my hand upon
[1:26:38] Egypt and bring out the children of
[1:26:40] Israel from among them.
[1:26:43] And he told that he first told Moses
[1:26:45] that you're God to Pharaoh. Now, now
[1:26:46] you're thinking of God to Pharaoh that I
[1:26:48] I'm going here with some power.
[1:26:51] Watch now. And Moses and Aaron did as
[1:26:54] the Lord commanded them. So they did.
[1:26:56] Verse seven. And Moses was four score
[1:26:58] years old and Aaron fourth score and
[1:26:59] three years old. And uh when they spake
[1:27:01] unto Pharaoh and the Lord spake unto
[1:27:04] Moses and unto Pharaoh, saying when
[1:27:06] Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying,
[1:27:08] "Show a miracle for for uh for you, then
[1:27:11] you shall say um then you shall say unto
[1:27:14] Aaron, take thy rod and cast it before
[1:27:16] Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent."
[1:27:19] Verse 10. And Moses and Aaron went in
[1:27:21] unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the
[1:27:23] Lord commanded. And Aaron cast down his
[1:27:26] rod before Pharaoh and before his
[1:27:28] servants and it became a serpent.
[1:27:30] Hallelujah. Then Pharaoh also called the
[1:27:34] wise men and the sorceress. Now the
[1:27:38] magicians of E uh magicians of Egypt,
[1:27:40] they also did in like manner with their
[1:27:43] enchantment.
[1:27:44] Now here Moses goes throws down his rod
[1:27:47] like God told him, turns into a serpent.
[1:27:51] Pharaoh look at him say, "Man,
[1:27:55] come on, bro.
[1:27:57] We've been doing this for years. Call."
[1:27:59] And he called not just not just one, but
[1:28:02] everybody. All his magicians and y'all
[1:28:05] show him what y'all what y'all do. They
[1:28:08] throw down their rods. All them become
[1:28:10] serpents.
[1:28:13] Now, if you if you ever had to be still,
[1:28:19] this was a time that you had to be
[1:28:20] sitting like, "God, you told me I was
[1:28:22] God to this man." Yeah. This man doing
[1:28:25] the same thing we doing. Yeah. But you
[1:28:27] say, "I'm God to him." Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:28:30] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:28:31] That's exactly what I said. He didn't
[1:28:33] explain nothing to Moses. And let me
[1:28:35] tell you, when you going through them
[1:28:36] still moments,
[1:28:38] God ain't going to explain nothing to
[1:28:40] you either.
[1:28:42] But you got to be still and know that he
[1:28:44] is God. Hallelujah. When when Moses did
[1:28:48] everything that God told him to do, huh?
[1:28:51] And when you know you done everything
[1:28:52] God told you to do, just be still and
[1:28:55] watch God do what he said he going to
[1:28:56] do. Watch the next verse. Watch the next
[1:29:00] verse. Moses didn't do this. Moses
[1:29:03] didn't do this. Verse 12 says, "For they
[1:29:06] cast down every man his rod,
[1:29:09] and they became serpents, but
[1:29:14] Aaron's rod
[1:29:19] swallowed up their rods." What this mean
[1:29:23] is that they came to the battle with a
[1:29:25] rod, but they left without one.
[1:29:31] Can I Can I put it this way? God know
[1:29:33] how to one up.
[1:29:38] That's right, brother. When the devil
[1:29:41] thought he I mean that look at all these
[1:29:43] snakes. God then then God knew exactly
[1:29:46] what they're going to do. I'mma swallow
[1:29:47] all of them. They won't be able to use
[1:29:48] this trick no more.
[1:29:51] Hallelujah.
[1:29:54] God will one up the devil every time.
[1:29:57] And the oneup happens when we are
[1:30:02] still.
[1:30:04] When you learn to be still, that's when
[1:30:06] the oneup you give God an opportunity.
[1:30:08] You give him something to work with.
[1:30:11] Oh my. You know, cuz cuz look, sometimes
[1:30:13] we want to do it. We want we want we
[1:30:15] want to we want to bring glory to
[1:30:16] ourselves. But that that ain't how this
[1:30:18] thing work. God want to bring glory to
[1:30:20] himself, and he's using your trial to do
[1:30:23] that. Amen. Oh, blessed be the name of
[1:30:26] the Lord. Let me give you um that's
[1:30:29] Moses having to be still and I and I
[1:30:31] like I like I like that. I like God
[1:30:33] showed that he was not going to be
[1:30:34] outdone by Satan. Not not at all. Um
[1:30:39] DJ told me all these different ones that
[1:30:41] had to be still. And I thought about
[1:30:43] another another time where brother
[1:30:45] Brandham himself had to be still. I want
[1:30:48] to read a a little quote here
[1:30:51] and then uh I want to tell you a little
[1:30:53] story.
[1:30:56] Now, the problem is is that had my timer
[1:30:59] on it and I don't know how long I'm
[1:31:01] going to be preaching.
[1:31:06] So, let me just keep going and we'll
[1:31:08] find we'll find the Holy Spirit will let
[1:31:09] us know when to get out.
[1:31:13] Believe from the heart. This sermon,
[1:31:15] believe from the heart. Brother Random
[1:31:16] says this.
[1:31:20] Now then when Peter asks this question,
[1:31:24] behold how quick the tree witherth.
[1:31:28] Then he said to them, if thou should say
[1:31:30] to this mountain, be thou move be moved
[1:31:33] and cast into the sea. And don't doubt
[1:31:35] but believe that what you say will come
[1:31:38] to pass. And I mean recently that
[1:31:40] scripture just really rose up in me.
[1:31:42] something I was going through and and
[1:31:43] and I say I I don't care what this
[1:31:45] mountain is. I'm I'm telling the
[1:31:47] mountain to move right now in the name
[1:31:49] of Jesus.
[1:31:51] And and and after I finish speaking
[1:31:53] that, then DJ, Brother DJ calls and say,
[1:31:55] "Now, Brother Jack, I don't know what
[1:31:56] you're going through. Be still." I say,
[1:31:59] "Okay, brother DJ, you're going to hear
[1:32:00] that one again."
[1:32:04] So, uh, if if thou shalt say to this
[1:32:07] mountain, be moved and cast into the
[1:32:09] sea, don't doubt, but believe that what
[1:32:11] you say will come to pass, you'll have
[1:32:14] what you say. Now, listen, that's part
[1:32:17] of the material and in this great
[1:32:19] economy of God, this great ship that
[1:32:21] we're in, the old ship of Zion in the
[1:32:23] body of Christ. Now, to the testimony,
[1:32:25] it had it has been some time. I've
[1:32:28] watched this and now listen close now
[1:32:30] for a little teaching. There's been
[1:32:32] times in life when all when I look at
[1:32:36] the suffering and see those who were
[1:32:38] afflicted and tormented with demon
[1:32:40] powers, my heart just bleeds for them.
[1:32:43] And yet I've I've had to I've had them
[1:32:46] to call me on the telephone and uh in
[1:32:49] the meetings that clamor and move and
[1:32:51] draw and pull and it's so hard to say no
[1:32:54] to those people. And brother Brandon
[1:32:56] talk about he he just wanted to pray for
[1:32:58] everybody. remember one time he was in
[1:32:59] the prayer line. It lasted all through
[1:33:01] the night in Arkansas. I mean, just he
[1:33:04] prayed for everybody. He fell asleep in
[1:33:06] the pull pit praying for people and and
[1:33:08] God told him, "You can't do it that way.
[1:33:10] You can't do it that way. You hurt
[1:33:11] yourself trying to do it that way.
[1:33:13] Trying to meet everybody's needs. You
[1:33:14] cannot do that." Hallelujah. You need
[1:33:18] other people to help you do that. You as
[1:33:20] yourself, you cannot meet everybody's
[1:33:23] needs. Right? So here, brother Brandon
[1:33:25] was trying. He said it's he said he
[1:33:27] actually it was hard for him to say no
[1:33:29] to people. He says frankly I can't do
[1:33:31] it. He says so somebody has to do has to
[1:33:34] say it for me. I can't get to them. My
[1:33:37] how my heart just bleeds for them. He
[1:33:40] says day after day I go through the
[1:33:42] tortures of that and I wonder sometimes
[1:33:45] and then I console myself by going back
[1:33:47] to scripture seeing him going through uh
[1:33:50] that place of Bethesda and seeing all
[1:33:52] those crippled and afflicted. went over
[1:33:54] to one man and healed him lying on a
[1:33:56] pallet and walked away and left the
[1:33:58] rest. It says, "But still down in my
[1:34:01] heart," he says, "that makes me, it
[1:34:03] doesn't take away that burning." Oh, how
[1:34:06] I wish there was something that could
[1:34:07] happen. Then I noticed yonder in
[1:34:09] Portland, Oregon, when that maniac that
[1:34:12] night run to the platform to kill me. I
[1:34:14] remember there was something happened
[1:34:16] and it wasn't in the intellectuals at
[1:34:18] all. Intellectually, I would have run
[1:34:21] like the rest of the preachers did, but
[1:34:24] I didn't run. There was something. God
[1:34:28] was getting ready to display his power.
[1:34:33] One time he said, "Be still and know
[1:34:36] that I am God."
[1:34:39] So, here the prophet is in a meeting.
[1:34:42] The Lord has sent him to Portland,
[1:34:44] Oregon to preach the gospel.
[1:34:47] And as uh you know he gets there and and
[1:34:50] and and see you know as ministers we we
[1:34:53] come here and we don't we don't know
[1:34:54] what we going to run into. We we assume
[1:34:57] it's just going to be a normal service
[1:34:59] but sometimes you don't know what you're
[1:35:01] going to run into.
[1:35:03] I remember preaching that sermon
[1:35:04] invincible and I'm thinking yeah I'm
[1:35:07] going to just preach this sermon. I love
[1:35:08] it. Our church loves it. and we go up
[1:35:09] there to uh to to uh um uh Brother
[1:35:13] Fred's and while I'm preaching, all of a
[1:35:15] sudden the sister come out the back of
[1:35:17] the church right up to the front and and
[1:35:20] um and and she had lost her mind. I
[1:35:22] didn't know what what was going on. So,
[1:35:24] I just told everybody just bow your
[1:35:25] heads and let's pray, you know, and and
[1:35:27] and you bow your heads because if this
[1:35:30] spirit come out, I don't want it jumping
[1:35:31] on somebody. So, keep your head bowed,
[1:35:34] be reverent, right? And I mean, I'm I'm
[1:35:37] just preaching. I had no idea that was
[1:35:39] going to happen in the service. You
[1:35:40] know, uh, brother Brandham, you know,
[1:35:42] has this. He's there in Portland and um,
[1:35:45] and he's preaching and and while he's
[1:35:48] preaching, a fella rose up in the back.
[1:35:53] Fella looked at him and say, "I'mma
[1:35:55] break every bone in your body." Said,
[1:35:57] "What you mean, man? I'm just I'm just
[1:35:59] here to preach to God. I'mma break every
[1:36:01] bone in your you snake in the grass." It
[1:36:03] start hissing at him. You snake in the
[1:36:05] grass. you know who you think you is
[1:36:08] coming here and you know and and he just
[1:36:10] boy he was upset and and and actually he
[1:36:12] got to going uh he walked from the back
[1:36:15] all the way to the front right towards
[1:36:17] the prophet and say and brother Random
[1:36:19] say all these preachers
[1:36:22] behind them on the pull pit them
[1:36:24] preachers looked and saw what was
[1:36:26] happening I mean people that's supposed
[1:36:27] to bind devils
[1:36:31] loose devils I mean all the preachers
[1:36:34] took off running
[1:36:36] The only help brother Brandham had was
[1:36:39] police officers. They were they were not
[1:36:41] afraid to go at this guy. And brother
[1:36:43] Brandham said they said, "You want to?"
[1:36:44] He said, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[1:36:46] no, no, don't don't don't don't do them.
[1:36:47] Don't don't touch him. Just just let him
[1:36:49] be." Man kept coming closer, closer,
[1:36:52] closer, closer. Got all the way up in
[1:36:54] the prophet's face. I'm talking about he
[1:36:55] got close this like this.
[1:36:59] And you know what he did when he got
[1:37:01] this close?
[1:37:03] He spit in his face.
[1:37:07] You say, "Don't do that to me.
[1:37:19] You know how hard
[1:37:25] Do you know how hard it would be
[1:37:29] to be still?
[1:37:47] spitting brother Brandham face and I can
[1:37:49] I I wasn't there but I can just imagine
[1:37:51] the prophet just take out his
[1:37:58] look that demon in the eye
[1:38:03] because he was still
[1:38:05] not not and brother Brandham was a boxer
[1:38:08] so he he could have hit him with a
[1:38:10] one-two combo you know
[1:38:14] he had learned some things from from a
[1:38:16] six-second Smith
[1:38:19] that's right right he could have hit him
[1:38:20] with a couple combos and and that would
[1:38:22] have been I but he was a big fella right
[1:38:25] but brother Brandham said brother I can
[1:38:26] just see him just maybe wipe the spit
[1:38:28] out and then he say the Holy Spirit came
[1:38:31] over from and he said uh because you
[1:38:36] challenge the spirit of God today you're
[1:38:38] going to fall over my feet.
[1:38:41] That man say I'mma fall over your feet.
[1:38:44] And see the man had been known for
[1:38:46] beating up other preachers.
[1:38:49] That's why the preachers were running
[1:38:50] because they oh you know your your buddy
[1:38:53] from the other church over there around
[1:38:55] the corn.
[1:39:03] Well, brother Ram said, "Because you
[1:39:04] challenged the spirit of God. You didn't
[1:39:06] challenge me. You challenged the spirit
[1:39:09] of God. You're going to fall over my
[1:39:12] feet. Thus saith the Lord."
[1:39:17] Well, that man looked at him say, "Fall
[1:39:19] over your feet?
[1:39:21] I'mma show you who feet I'mma fall
[1:39:23] over."
[1:39:24] rared back,
[1:39:27] went to throw that fist
[1:39:29] before he could get anywhere near his
[1:39:31] face,
[1:39:34] down on his feet.
[1:39:39] All the preachers saw that. And see, let
[1:39:41] me tell you, this this only happened
[1:39:45] this only occurred in Brother Brandham's
[1:39:47] life simply because he had the power
[1:39:53] to be still in a moment like that.
[1:39:59] See, you're going to have to exercise
[1:40:00] some power, some self-control. You're
[1:40:03] going to have to learn how to just be
[1:40:04] still. You're going to have to learn how
[1:40:06] to hush your mouth.
[1:40:08] Yes, sir. You ain't got to say something
[1:40:10] all the time.
[1:40:15] I keep telling you, keep giving the
[1:40:17] people piece piece of your mind. You
[1:40:18] ain't going to have no more mind left to
[1:40:20] give.
[1:40:22] keep your mind
[1:40:26] because he had the power to be still.
[1:40:30] Then God had an opportunity to work and
[1:40:32] show his glory in the midst of
[1:40:34] everybody.
[1:40:36] You know, after he fell like that, the
[1:40:38] the I think the policeman said, "Oh, oh,
[1:40:41] oh, let me I got to read something
[1:40:42] there. I got to read something there."
[1:40:45] um go to the sermon um
[1:40:50] faith and then go to paragraph 13 when
[1:40:53] you get there. Just pull up that
[1:40:55] message. Faith and then go to paragraph
[1:40:58] 13. Um
[1:41:01] let me just see. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:41:02] Let me let me read this. Let me read
[1:41:04] this part. Oh, glory.
[1:41:09] He says, "And when I looked at the man,
[1:41:13] I heard myself taken, and I don't know
[1:41:16] whether it may sound strange."
[1:41:20] It says, "Uh, just just scroll down to
[1:41:23] paragraph 13." There you go. Says, uh,
[1:41:25] but it was it was the Holy Spirit
[1:41:27] speaking. The Bible said, "Take no
[1:41:29] thought what you what you shall say.
[1:41:30] It'll be added then." And it said,
[1:41:33] "Because thou hast defied the spirit of
[1:41:36] God, tonight you will fall over my
[1:41:38] feet." He said, 'Well, I'll show you
[1:41:40] whose feet I fall over.' And he drew his
[1:41:42] great big arm back and and started to
[1:41:44] hit me like that. And I said, "Satan,
[1:41:45] come out of the man just about like that
[1:41:48] in the name of the Lord Jesus." And he
[1:41:50] had his arm back like that to strike.
[1:41:54] And it started going, "Ooh, ooh." And
[1:41:55] his eyes rolled back. He started going
[1:41:57] around and around like that and fell
[1:42:00] down till he just laid across my feet.
[1:42:02] and I couldn't move anyway. So there
[1:42:05] both uh both had made a challenge. The
[1:42:08] spirit of God and the spirit was in him.
[1:42:11] Right? See God one up the devil. Both
[1:42:14] both of them made a challenge. So then
[1:42:16] something had to happen. The audience
[1:42:18] was wanting and the fellow and the
[1:42:20] policeman said, "Is that man dead?" I
[1:42:22] said, "No sir." They asked, "Is he
[1:42:25] healed?"
[1:42:27] I said, "No, sir.
[1:42:30] He worships that spirit."
[1:42:34] He says he won't give up. He won't give
[1:42:36] it up. Oh, Lord have mercy. Some folk
[1:42:39] got spirit that they refuse to give up.
[1:42:42] They worship that spirit. That's why it
[1:42:45] stay on it for year after year after
[1:42:46] year after year. They don't want freedom
[1:42:48] from it.
[1:42:50] He worships that spirit. He won't give
[1:42:51] it up. See, but would you move him off
[1:42:54] my feet?
[1:42:59] And so when they got over there, I just
[1:43:00] turned around to the audience. I said,
[1:43:03] "As I was saying,
[1:43:07] faith
[1:43:09] is the substance of things hoped for."
[1:43:12] And a man sitting in a wheelchair just
[1:43:14] raised up. Hallelujah. And a lady on the
[1:43:17] stretcher nowhere. See, God going to get
[1:43:19] glory out the story. Yes, sir. All this
[1:43:22] happened because he was able to be
[1:43:23] still. All right. But the devil lost a
[1:43:26] lot this on this and this. He lo he lost
[1:43:28] a I mean a lost a man to a wheelchair.
[1:43:30] Another lady sick. Everybody getting
[1:43:32] healed.
[1:43:34] Good God almighty.
[1:43:36] My he said he says um uh uh uh
[1:43:40] everything he says wheelchair raised up
[1:43:41] in lady on the stretch of nowhere.
[1:43:43] Everything in in there was healed right
[1:43:46] there. And they just packed them away.
[1:43:49] And the next morning was a great big
[1:43:50] truck down the street. people singing
[1:43:52] only believe walking behind a big truck
[1:43:54] full of stretches and wheelchairs and
[1:43:55] everything said now what this is the one
[1:43:57] I want to get to you what was it the
[1:44:00] chief
[1:44:02] of that tribe of demons
[1:44:05] you don't realize sometime you going
[1:44:07] through a whole tribe of demons
[1:44:10] but the when the chief of the tribe of
[1:44:14] demons is defeated
[1:44:16] the rest of them going to run too yes
[1:44:18] sir
[1:44:20] brother we going after the chief.
[1:44:24] When you when you can be still, you
[1:44:26] going after the chief. Amen. Glory to
[1:44:29] God.
[1:44:34] My my my chief of that tribe of demons
[1:44:37] had made the challenge and lost it. You
[1:44:40] see, that's when the spirit of God
[1:44:42] struck the building and everything
[1:44:46] was healed. Amen. All because the
[1:44:49] prophet could be still.
[1:44:53] You know, I I I I got I got two more.
[1:44:55] I'm going to read this. I'm I'mma slip
[1:44:57] over to I want to talk about the Lord
[1:44:58] Jesus. Um Mark Mark 9 verse 17. Mark 9:1
[1:45:06] 17.
[1:45:10] Jesus himself had to be still.
[1:45:13] often
[1:45:15] times you just can't get
[1:45:18] all upset when things are going a
[1:45:20] different a particular way. You just
[1:45:22] just just roll with it. Amen. Be stay
[1:45:25] calm.
[1:45:27] Amen. God got everything under control.
[1:45:30] Be still and know that I'm God. Here in
[1:45:33] Mark 9:1 17, let me just read this. Um
[1:45:39] it says um and one of the multitude
[1:45:42] answered and said, "Master,
[1:45:45] I have brought unto thee my son which
[1:45:47] hath a dumb spirit.
[1:45:50] And where wheresoever he taketh him,
[1:45:54] he teareth him, and he foamth and
[1:45:57] nasheth with his teeth, and pineth away.
[1:46:00] And I spake to thy disciples that they
[1:46:02] should cast him out and they could not.
[1:46:06] He answer him and saith, Oh faithless
[1:46:10] generation, how long shall I be with
[1:46:13] you? How long shall I suffer you? Bring
[1:46:16] him unto me. I just something about
[1:46:18] that. I mean Jesus ready to take the
[1:46:21] challenge. Bring him unto me. I I got
[1:46:24] it. And they brought him unto him.
[1:46:28] And when he saw him, straightway the
[1:46:31] spirit tear him and he fell on the
[1:46:33] ground and wallowed for foaming. Wall up
[1:46:37] foaming. Now you can see it's the devil
[1:46:39] that's upset when it comes into the
[1:46:41] presence of the Lord Jesus. When the
[1:46:43] devil know he about to lose something,
[1:46:44] he get all flustered and frustrated. You
[1:46:48] know, I I mean you you have to you have
[1:46:50] to learn that you are in control of the
[1:46:52] situation. Somebody else coming to you
[1:46:55] yelling and screaming and all. No, no,
[1:46:56] no. Don't lift your voice like that. No.
[1:46:58] Bring your voice down. See, a soft
[1:47:01] answer turns away wrath. I remember fell
[1:47:04] one time took me into the office with my
[1:47:06] boss. He He just And we sitting there in
[1:47:08] the office and and he just he did this
[1:47:10] and he did that and he shouldn't do
[1:47:12] this. He shouldn't He called us a
[1:47:13] Christian, too. And he was just going to
[1:47:15] town. My boss just sitting there
[1:47:16] listening to him. I said, "Well, you
[1:47:18] know, um this is why I did what I did."
[1:47:22] And yeah, and it was based on this. And
[1:47:24] you know, it was, you know, and I talked
[1:47:26] so so so calm, so soft. My boss just
[1:47:30] looking at me and and next thing you
[1:47:31] know, that fell, he uh came, he was up
[1:47:34] here. He came all the way down. And when
[1:47:37] he finished, he he left the office say,
[1:47:39] "I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that uh that
[1:47:42] my Christian testimony didn't show in
[1:47:45] that that situation. I'm so sorry. I
[1:47:47] watched how you handled yourself. I'm
[1:47:49] sorry." sorry. And not only was he
[1:47:50] sorry, uh, he he actually found another
[1:47:53] job.
[1:47:55] And I didn't fire him. It it was just
[1:47:58] when light shows up darkness, they'll do
[1:48:02] that on their own. Look, you ain't got
[1:48:03] to work to try to get rid of people.
[1:48:06] They will leave on their own.
[1:48:08] I'mma tell you what you do.
[1:48:12] Be still.
[1:48:15] What verse am I on?
[1:48:17] Okay. 21. Um,
[1:48:21] and he asked his father, "How how long
[1:48:23] is it ago since this came unto him?"
[1:48:25] Now, you can see the way Jesus asking
[1:48:27] questions, he's very calm in this
[1:48:30] situation. He's not all, "Oh, Lord, what
[1:48:32] we going to do?" No, no, no. Just stay
[1:48:34] relaxed. Now, we getting ready to go
[1:48:36] have meetings, y'all. You don't know who
[1:48:38] going to come into them services. You
[1:48:41] don't know what their conditions going
[1:48:42] to be. People come with demons and
[1:48:45] sometimes they manifest in in in in
[1:48:48] meetings like that. You can't be
[1:48:51] what we going to do? I'mma tell you what
[1:48:53] to do. I'm Jesus going to give us an
[1:48:55] answer here, too. Start fasting and
[1:48:57] start praying. Get yourself prepared for
[1:48:59] the meetings.
[1:49:01] Glory to God. Oh, Lord have mercy. I
[1:49:05] done seen devils tell people,
[1:49:08] "You can't cast me out,
[1:49:10] you watch too much TV.
[1:49:16] Devils untold folk that you watch way
[1:49:18] too much TV, you can't cast me out.
[1:49:24] Amen. The devil put you to shame.
[1:49:27] What would the devil say to people
[1:49:28] today? What you just you was on social
[1:49:31] media that post that you just you can't
[1:49:34] cast me out.
[1:49:38] Hello, somebody. Don't let the devil
[1:49:40] embarrass you. He will.
[1:49:43] All right. Look, look at look at look at
[1:49:45] this. Um, how long is it ago since this
[1:49:50] came unto him and he said of a child and
[1:49:54] all times it cast him into the fire and
[1:49:57] into the waters to destroy him. See the
[1:49:59] devil coming to try to destroy to
[1:50:01] destroy him. But if thou can't do
[1:50:03] anything, have compassion on us and help
[1:50:06] us. I love this. Jesus said unto him,
[1:50:09] "If thou can't believe, all things are
[1:50:12] possible to him that believeth." And
[1:50:15] straight straightway the father of the
[1:50:17] child cried out. I like his emotion
[1:50:19] because this man remind me of me, right?
[1:50:22] He said he said straightway the father
[1:50:24] of the of the child cried out and and
[1:50:26] said with tears, "Lord, I believe.
[1:50:33] Help thou my unbelief."
[1:50:35] And he said it with tears. This man is
[1:50:37] really really I mean the reason I'm here
[1:50:39] Jesus is because I believe. Amen. I
[1:50:43] think you can do something about this. I
[1:50:45] tried your disciples. They couldn't get
[1:50:46] it done. But Jesus, I'm here to see you.
[1:50:48] Please, I believe God, but help my
[1:50:51] unbelief. When Jesus saw that the people
[1:50:54] came running together, he rebuked
[1:50:58] the foul spirit,
[1:51:01] saying unto him, "Thou dumb and deaf
[1:51:05] spirit,
[1:51:07] I charge thee,
[1:51:09] come out of him, this part to get me,
[1:51:13] and enter no more into him."
[1:51:17] So this devil would come and go and come
[1:51:22] and and the father say sometime it come
[1:51:24] on him and they throw him into a fire
[1:51:25] try to kill him then to get off of them.
[1:51:28] We think we we good for a little bit.
[1:51:30] All of a sudden it show up again and now
[1:51:32] he's trying to drown him in water. We
[1:51:35] just trying to have a good family
[1:51:37] function and and he and the devil just
[1:51:38] just just just running rough shot in his
[1:51:40] life. We don't know what to do with this
[1:51:42] boy. But when when he comes in contact
[1:51:45] with Jesus,
[1:51:48] not only come out,
[1:51:55] you can't come back no more.
[1:51:58] You talk about God one up in the devil.
[1:52:02] Amen. This house is off limits.
[1:52:06] You can't do anything here anymore.
[1:52:08] Let's keep on reading what Jesus tells
[1:52:10] the disciples here. Verse 26 he says
[1:52:16] and the spirit cried and rent him a
[1:52:19] sword and came out of him and he was he
[1:52:21] was as one dead in so much that many
[1:52:24] said he is dead. Now that's what they
[1:52:26] asked the police officer asked about
[1:52:28] that that that one fella the the the
[1:52:30] maniac. No, he wasn't dead. He wasn't
[1:52:33] dead and he also wasn't delivered right
[1:52:36] because he worshiped that spirit.
[1:52:39] So he was going to go go to another
[1:52:40] church and do that until he got
[1:52:41] delivered.
[1:52:44] My God. My God. Look at this. He says uh
[1:52:47] verse 27. But Jesus took him by the hand
[1:52:48] and lifted him up and he arose. And when
[1:52:51] he was coming to the house, his
[1:52:52] disciples asked him privately, why could
[1:52:54] not we cast him out? And he said unto
[1:52:56] them, this kind
[1:53:01] can come forth by nothing but by prayer
[1:53:05] and fasting. As we approaching these
[1:53:08] meetings, I want to encourage the
[1:53:09] church.
[1:53:11] Fast and pray. Get yourself in condition
[1:53:14] because you don't know what you might
[1:53:15] run into. But I tell you, we want to an
[1:53:18] environment where the bound can be set
[1:53:21] free.
[1:53:24] When you're going through things like
[1:53:25] this, you got to learn how to be still.
[1:53:27] Another verse that uh I read earlier out
[1:53:30] of Luke 23, and we'll bring this to a
[1:53:32] close. Uh the people stood beholding and
[1:53:35] the rulers also with him derided him
[1:53:37] saying he saved others let him save
[1:53:39] himself if he be Christ the chosen of
[1:53:42] God. Now, everybody kept saying, "If he
[1:53:44] be Christ, if he be Christ," the rulers
[1:53:46] saying, "If he be Christ," uh the
[1:53:48] soldiers, they're saying, "If you really
[1:53:51] the Christ, then do this." And even the
[1:53:53] malfactor, the thief on the cross, man,
[1:53:55] if if you if you really the son of God,
[1:53:58] you know, and you done saved all these
[1:54:00] people like like we done heard, save
[1:54:03] yourself
[1:54:04] and us. Now, that man had no intention
[1:54:07] of being converted. If he would have got
[1:54:10] off that cross, he would have still been
[1:54:11] stealing. He would have he would have
[1:54:12] kept on stealing and everything else.
[1:54:14] But but like like his friend said, "Man,
[1:54:15] what you doing? This man this man ain't
[1:54:18] done nothing wrong. We done did
[1:54:20] everything that and we deserve the
[1:54:22] punishment that we getting. I only got
[1:54:24] one request. Lord, when you when you
[1:54:25] come into your kingdom, would you
[1:54:27] remember me
[1:54:29] and he got remembered?"
[1:54:32] Now,
[1:54:33] here's the thing, and I want to read a
[1:54:36] little something here. At this moment
[1:54:38] where they're they're telling Jesus,
[1:54:42] if you be the Christ, come down off the
[1:54:43] cross. It's not that he didn't have the
[1:54:46] ability to do that.
[1:54:49] He could have come down off that cross
[1:54:51] if he wanted to.
[1:54:54] But this was a moment where he had to be
[1:54:59] still
[1:55:01] because in being still something greater
[1:55:04] was about to happen. Oh my goodness. I'm
[1:55:08] glad he didn't come down because that
[1:55:11] allowed him to come up.
[1:55:15] Hallelujah. Had he come down, then he
[1:55:19] would not have been able to come up. And
[1:55:22] because he did not come down and he came
[1:55:25] up, he gives us the ability now to come
[1:55:28] up.
[1:55:37] here in
[1:55:40] in the message um
[1:55:43] blind Barnameus.
[1:55:47] Oh, I'm so glad. I'm so glad he had
[1:55:49] self-control. I'm so glad that he was
[1:55:51] able to pray through in the garden of
[1:55:53] Gethsemane and say, "Lord, let this, you
[1:55:55] know, this if you just let this cup pass
[1:55:57] and say, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1:55:58] Okay, I'll tell you what. Not my will,
[1:56:01] but thy will be done." When he can bring
[1:56:03] himself to a place like that, that's a
[1:56:05] place of being still.
[1:56:10] He says when they had him in the
[1:56:12] courtyards of the Roman courts, they put
[1:56:14] a rag around his face and took a stick
[1:56:16] and hit him on top of the head. Now they
[1:56:19] say you're a prophet. You can you can
[1:56:21] tell things what people has done and
[1:56:23] what people will do. Now tell us who hit
[1:56:25] you. We'll believe you. He could he
[1:56:28] could have done it, but he'd been
[1:56:30] minding the devil. If he would have did
[1:56:33] it, then he'd be minding the devil. He
[1:56:35] didn't do it. He just sat there. See,
[1:56:39] being still, he sat there and never
[1:56:42] opened his mouth with a rag around his
[1:56:45] face and hit him and said, "You're a
[1:56:47] prophet. Uh, tell us who hit you now and
[1:56:50] we'll believe you." That same devil
[1:56:52] lives in people today. See, he says,
[1:56:55] "Say, if you're if there's a God, a
[1:56:57] healer, if this guy's got a gift of
[1:56:59] divine healing, go down and heal this
[1:57:01] one here. Let me see it. I believe. Let
[1:57:03] me see." You know, churches put out that
[1:57:05] kind of propaganda. You just remember
[1:57:06] that's the that's the same spirit. Then
[1:57:10] priests, if thou art the son of God,
[1:57:12] come down off the cross now. Pull pull
[1:57:14] pull your pull your hands loose and come
[1:57:16] down. We'll believe you. Why he could
[1:57:18] have done that if he wanted to, you
[1:57:20] know, they paid him the greatest honor
[1:57:22] there he ever uh uh he ever uh uh played
[1:57:27] to they they ever played to him. He says
[1:57:29] Kaiaphas the high priest said he saved
[1:57:30] others himself he cannot save. That was
[1:57:34] an honor. If he saved others if he if he
[1:57:38] saved himself he could not save others.
[1:57:41] So he gave himself so he could save
[1:57:44] others. See he had to give himself so he
[1:57:48] could save us. Amen. if he saved
[1:57:50] himself. Like Billy Sunday said, one of
[1:57:54] uh his writings, one of the tech, one of
[1:57:56] his textbooks I was reading here some
[1:57:57] time ago, angels was setting in every
[1:58:01] tree saying just pull your hand off the
[1:58:04] cross and point to one of us will change
[1:58:07] this scene around here. He could have
[1:58:09] done it too, but if he would have done
[1:58:11] it, where would we be today? It says,
[1:58:16] "But he hung there with spit in his face
[1:58:20] and nails in his hands, thorns on his
[1:58:22] head and blood running down with tears
[1:58:25] mingled, dying as a malfactor because he
[1:58:29] loved us." That's right. And giving us
[1:58:32] the chance for salvation, giving us the
[1:58:35] chance to pray for the sick that and
[1:58:36] they be made well. Giving us that
[1:58:38] opportunity, he did it for us. The
[1:58:42] reason he was still is because he was
[1:58:44] thinking of you.
[1:58:47] Oh, he could have changed everything,
[1:58:48] but he didn't. He He He decided to
[1:58:52] remain still.
[1:58:56] This last quote I want to bring you from
[1:58:57] that time.
[1:58:59] I want you to see the Lord Jesus in the
[1:59:02] this time of his crucial trial in his
[1:59:04] life, but yet he remained still in the
[1:59:07] midst of it all, knowing that there was
[1:59:09] a greater purpose behind this trial. It
[1:59:12] says, could that be God?
[1:59:16] Could that be God's son going there,
[1:59:18] Jehovah made manifest in flesh, going up
[1:59:21] there with handfuls of beard pulled out
[1:59:23] of his face? Why? No one could stand
[1:59:25] that mockery spitting his face.
[1:59:28] uh mockery spitt in his face. My agent
[1:59:31] smoked him on the head and said, "Now,
[1:59:33] if you be a prophet,
[1:59:35] you got some kind of makeup work. You
[1:59:38] got some kind of hoax you put on the
[1:59:39] people. Now, if you be a real prophet,
[1:59:41] tell us who hit you and we'll believe
[1:59:42] you." Nah, he couldn't be God. Here he
[1:59:45] goes on up and when he gets up there on
[1:59:48] the cross, they nail him to the cross
[1:59:49] and the devil said, "I got him now."
[1:59:52] And while weakness began to set in from
[1:59:55] the loss of blood, what was it? The bee
[1:59:58] of death was buzzing around him, fixing
[2:00:01] to sting him. That bee of death coming
[2:00:04] around him and saying, "Oh, I doubt
[2:00:06] that. How could he be virgin born? How
[2:00:09] could God dwell like that great Jehovah
[2:00:12] God who has all power and heavens and
[2:00:15] earth? Let somebody spit in his face and
[2:00:17] and take take him on like take him on
[2:00:19] like that. He couldn't be. I'll suck the
[2:00:22] stinger
[2:00:24] into him, brother."
[2:00:27] He didn't know what he done when he put
[2:00:30] his stinger into that flesh.
[2:00:33] It took
[2:00:36] his stinger out.
[2:00:39] And when a bee once stings deeply,
[2:00:42] it loses
[2:00:45] its stinger. A honeybee insect that's
[2:00:48] that's got a stinger, when it stings,
[2:00:50] the flesh anchors and pulls the stinger
[2:00:52] out. And when death met God, oh, one up,
[2:00:57] one up, one up.
[2:01:00] Death lost its stinger. And now death
[2:01:03] has no stinger. It can't buzz and make a
[2:01:06] He says it can buzz and make a noise and
[2:01:08] say, "I'll take you. I'll kill you. I'll
[2:01:10] do this, that, or the other." But it has
[2:01:12] it has no stinger. It lost it yonder in
[2:01:16] Calvary.
[2:01:17] No wonder Paul could say when he was
[2:01:21] coming down to the end of the road. Oh
[2:01:23] death,
[2:01:24] where is your stinger?
[2:01:27] Oh grave, where is your victory? But
[2:01:30] thanks be to God who gives us the
[2:01:33] victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:01:36] How that from that time death has no
[2:01:40] stinger for the believer.
[2:01:43] Christ took the sting of death out for
[2:01:46] the believer. There is where he was
[2:01:48] wounded for our transgressions.
[2:01:51] He was bruised
[2:01:54] for our iniquities. The chastisement of
[2:01:57] our peace upon him. And we declare with
[2:02:01] his stripes
[2:02:04] we're healed. Amen. From that time,
[2:02:07] Satan was stripped
[2:02:09] of everything he had. Can you imagine
[2:02:12] that? Where he's sitting there
[2:02:14] wondering, is this is this this the son
[2:02:15] of God? Oh, I got him now. He thought he
[2:02:18] had won a won a victory, but he didn't
[2:02:20] realize he lost a great war.
[2:02:25] He was stripped of everything he had.
[2:02:28] And and here here's the here's the
[2:02:29] beautiful part. I don't care what you're
[2:02:31] going through. I don't care what the
[2:02:32] devil got you got your mind playing
[2:02:35] tricks on you. The devil ain't nothing
[2:02:37] but a bluff.
[2:02:40] Hallelujah.
[2:02:43] Death is just a bluff.
[2:02:46] It has no stinger. I mean, devil lost it
[2:02:49] all, y'all. When he when he when he when
[2:02:52] he when he let this one die, this was
[2:02:53] one he probably should have kept alive.
[2:02:56] But this one, he died,
[2:02:59] he went to the devil's house
[2:03:01] and he did something so bad to the devil
[2:03:04] that nobody else could do.
[2:03:06] You know, he took his keys
[2:03:10] to his own house. Jesus got the keys of
[2:03:12] death, hell, and the grave. And and here
[2:03:15] here here
[2:03:17] I'm sorry. Oh, look at that.
[2:03:21] Let me know. That's that was that was my
[2:03:22] tongue. But he took the keys of death,
[2:03:25] hell, and the grave. And Satan ain't got
[2:03:28] keys to his own house no more.
[2:03:31] I like that. Yeah. So, if you find
[2:03:34] yourself in a prison of mind battles
[2:03:37] this morning, push the door open.
[2:03:40] The devil ain't got no keys.
[2:03:45] Push the door open cuz the devil ain't
[2:03:48] got no keys at all.
[2:03:53] There is there is something powerful
[2:03:56] about being still.
[2:04:00] It gives God an opportunity to work. If
[2:04:02] Jesus had not been still, then we would
[2:04:05] not be where we are today.
[2:04:07] Thank God for him being still. And he
[2:04:11] encourages you to do the same. Be still
[2:04:14] and know
[2:04:17] I am God. And you know what else? I will
[2:04:21] be exalted.
[2:04:24] God richly bless you, church.
[2:04:28] Hallelujah.
[2:04:32] Let us have a word of prayer. Father,
[2:04:38] we are so grateful
[2:04:41] Lord for
[2:04:43] your voice speaking to us
[2:04:47] that you're aware of everything that we
[2:04:49] face, all that we go through. And
[2:04:52] there's nothing that catches you by
[2:04:54] surprise.
[2:04:57] But as we read here earlier, the prophet
[2:04:59] say you you you love
[2:05:02] for us to have the test. Actually
[2:05:05] another statement, the greatest thing
[2:05:07] that could ever happen to the believer
[2:05:10] is for them to have a test. Sometimes we
[2:05:13] don't want it, we don't enjoy it, but
[2:05:16] God, in the midst of it, you're bringing
[2:05:19] glory to the story.
[2:05:23] So Lord, help us to be still. Help us to
[2:05:25] just to patiently wait on the Lord.
[2:05:28] David would encourage us there. Wait on
[2:05:30] the Lord. Wait, I say on the Lord.
[2:05:34] Father, when we wait, you're you're
[2:05:36] always up to something so much greater.
[2:05:38] Those Hebrew boys waited.
[2:05:40] Because they waited, they got they got a
[2:05:44] front row seat with the fourth man.
[2:05:49] Daniel waited. He couldn't do anything
[2:05:52] but God because he did. How you shut the
[2:05:55] mouth of lions and gave a a beautiful
[2:05:57] testimony out of that. Moses waited. Job
[2:06:02] waited. So many had to be still. And
[2:06:05] God, this is our turn. We're on the
[2:06:07] earth now going through the trials and
[2:06:09] we have to learn to be still.
[2:06:13] You are God. You will be exalted
[2:06:16] and we love you. It's in Jesus name we
[2:06:20] pray. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's
[2:06:24] give the Lord a hand of praise.
[2:06:27] I'll turn the service back to brother
[2:06:29] Solomon. Amen. God bless you church. God
[2:06:32] bless you.
[2:06:34] God bless you.
[2:06:46] Praise the Lord. How many appreciate
[2:06:48] that message? My God.
[2:06:53] I believe the Lord deposited a seed in
[2:06:56] our in our souls this morning. Amen. You
[2:06:59] know, uh I know Brother Capers can
[2:07:01] identify with this. When a seed is
[2:07:03] planted, it grows two ways.
[2:07:07] When it's put in the ground, it's in
[2:07:08] darkness. And that's where you are in
[2:07:11] your prayer life. You're praying before
[2:07:13] the Lord and you're doing things in
[2:07:14] secret. He promised to reward you and
[2:07:16] openly. So that's when the roots go
[2:07:18] down. That's your test and your trials.
[2:07:22] But then it also grows upward and it
[2:07:24] brings forth fruit. So in your darkest
[2:07:27] times is when you are being rooted and
[2:07:29] grounded in Christ and then he'll bring
[2:07:33] forth the fruits and your blessings come
[2:07:35] forth. So you got to be still. When you
[2:07:38] commit that seed to the ground, the seed
[2:07:40] has to be still. We all got to be still
[2:07:43] in the midst of our trials. God has
[2:07:45] something wonderful he wants to do for
[2:07:46] us all. Amen. Will you stand to your
[2:07:48] feet? Amen. Let's sing this little song
[2:07:51] together. In my life be glorified. Amen.
[2:08:03] In
[2:08:05] my
[2:08:07] life.
[2:08:09] Lord
[2:08:12] be glorified.
[2:08:16] Be glorified
[2:08:21] in
[2:08:23] my
[2:08:25] life.
[2:08:28] Lord
[2:08:30] be glorified
[2:08:34] today.
[2:08:36] Say in my life,
[2:08:39] in
[2:08:41] my
[2:08:44] life,
[2:08:45] oh Lord,
[2:08:48] be glorifi
[2:08:51] be glorified
[2:08:55] in my life.
[2:09:00] Oh
[2:09:04] Lord
[2:09:06] be glorified
[2:09:11] Lord in this church
[2:09:16] in
[2:09:18] this
[2:09:20] church.
[2:09:22] Lord
[2:09:25] be
[2:09:28] glorified.
[2:09:31] Oh
[2:09:33] yes,
[2:09:35] this church.
[2:09:38] Oh Lord. Oh Lord,
[2:09:43] be glorified
[2:09:49] in your bride.
[2:09:52] In
[2:09:54] your
[2:09:57] bride,
[2:09:59] Lord
[2:10:01] be glorified.
[2:10:04] Be glorified.
[2:10:09] Oh,
[2:10:13] you're
[2:10:15] right.
[2:10:17] Oh Lord. Oh Lord.
[2:10:25] In my life.
[2:10:29] In
[2:10:31] my
[2:10:33] life.
[2:10:36] Lord
[2:10:38] be glorified.
[2:10:43] Be glorified
[2:10:47] in
[2:10:50] my
[2:10:52] life.
[2:10:54] Lord
[2:10:56] be glorified
[2:11:01] today.
[2:11:03] Bless my hearts.
[2:11:05] Father, thank you for your word, Lord
[2:11:08] Jesus. I know sometimes, Lord, we get a
[2:11:11] little antsy, Lord, and try want to try
[2:11:14] to make things happen, Lord. But we only
[2:11:16] need be still, Father, that you may move
[2:11:20] in the way that you want to move, Lord.
[2:11:22] Lord, sometimes we have to get ourselves
[2:11:25] out of the way that you may have your
[2:11:27] way. So, Father, help us to be still.
[2:11:32] Check us, Lord God, when we're getting
[2:11:35] out of line, trying to do things
[2:11:36] ourselves, Lord, that we may only
[2:11:39] surrender to you. Father, thank you for
[2:11:42] the word that you have given us, Lord.
[2:11:44] Thank you for the seed that you planted
[2:11:45] in our souls, Lord, not to be anxious,
[2:11:48] Lord Jesus, but to be mindful that you
[2:11:51] are God. Father, we pray for our pastor,
[2:11:54] Lord. We thank you for using him this
[2:11:56] morning. Bless him, Lord Jesus, for the
[2:11:59] lessons learned. Thank you for allowing
[2:12:02] Brother DJ, Lord, to speak to him. We
[2:12:04] pray for our brother, Lord. Lord, he's
[2:12:06] supposed to be fellowshipping amongst
[2:12:08] us, Lord Jesus, but Satan drew him out
[2:12:11] of line, Lord, but we realize there's
[2:12:13] still a seed there for him to come and
[2:12:16] be able to be used of you, Lord, to
[2:12:19] speak to our pastor, Lord. So, we pray
[2:12:20] for brother DJ. Restore both he and his
[2:12:24] family, Lord Jesus. They belong in the
[2:12:27] house of of God, worshiping you, Lord,
[2:12:30] and feeding on your word and growing.
[2:12:32] Lord, it's going home time. The bride
[2:12:35] must make herself ready. So, Father,
[2:12:37] bring them back, Lord. Again, Father,
[2:12:39] strengthen our pastor. Bless him, Lord,
[2:12:42] for his ability to get himself out of
[2:12:44] the way and continue to bless all that
[2:12:46] he put his hands to. And Lord, bless
[2:12:48] this congregation, Lord. Father, every
[2:12:51] test, every trial, Lord, they are
[2:12:53] victorious, Lord. And Father, I pray
[2:12:55] that you'll go before them, make their
[2:12:57] way prosperous. May your blessings,
[2:12:59] Lord, rest upon each one. Bring us all
[2:13:02] back at the appointed time, Lord. And
[2:13:03] may the Holy Ghost have his way in our
[2:13:05] lives. We thank you for all things in
[2:13:08] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[2:13:11] God bless you, saints. You may be
[2:13:12] seated.
[2:13:22] be glorified
[2:13:31] in
[2:13:33] my
[2:13:35] life.
[2:13:38] Lord,
[2:13:40] be glorified.
[2:13:45] Be glorified.
[2:13:49] in
[2:13:51] my
[2:13:53] life.
[2:13:56] Lord
[2:13:58] be open
[2:14:02] to
[2:14:07] in
[2:14:09] my
[2:14:11] heart.
[2:14:14] Lord
[2:14:16] be glorified.
[2:14:20] Be glorified.
