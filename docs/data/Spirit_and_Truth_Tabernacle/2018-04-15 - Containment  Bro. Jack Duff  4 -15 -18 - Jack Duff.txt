Tina will appreciate that Amen on today we have a couple of announcements that we want to make mention of is also there was a prayer request that I wanted to just mention found out about this on the on the Lifeline application there was a gentleman that was a lack of missionary for voice of God a father of couple children and young man and they were on vacation and they were his son got caught in a Riptide and the father went out to save the son and he got his son's life spared but when the father got his son out the father got swept in and and he ended up losing his life there in a Riptide and you know this is like the second event that I'm aware of in the last year or so where some men of God have been swept away by water and you know we want to pray for his family a man that got would just give them strength and everything as they go through this this season I have a friend of mine his wife just had back surgery and and they've been having all kind of complications from the surgery it's fluid metal leaking and things of that nature and they just you know the doctors are doing everything they can just to kind of keep her you know but they're asking for prayer we want to remember them in prayer her name is Gwen a man so we'll take those requests before the Lord that we have any announcements we wanna make mention of here quickly [Music] sister Zion be celebrating the birthday on Wednesday so happy birthday that's just a Zion a man we certainly thank the Lord for that also brother Quentin he's actually coming back on Tuesday he'll be back home on Tuesday and his birthday is on Thursday the 19th so will we certainly thank God for allowing both of them to see another year a man that this this Tuesday night sisters will be here at prayer amen at 7:30 all the sisters are invited to come a man and participate in the prayer service and man on Tuesday at 7:30 also don't forget next Sunday the pinnacle Palms service will happen at 5:30 next time get pinnacle Palms and I forgot to mention this but just yesterday they did change to combine services that will be held at rapture and faith they've changed it it's gotta happen on Sunday the 29th rather than next Sunday so to be the last Sunday this month that they're going to be doing that at brother westcoast church sunday the 29th and don't forget the 10th meetings that's coming up we'll be going out to Okeechobee Florida there with brother smiley and the church their Bible truth tabernac we'll be having our first 10 meeting to be held there on a Friday night and on a Saturday night it's Friday 27th and saturday 28th at 7:30 we have invited a number of churches around so we're expecting this believers as well as we're expecting amen those that don't know the Lord to them come walking through there and you know we want to be very attentive to that and I'll be praying for that because we want to see God just bring deliverance to his people our theme a man for these services is light the fire again amen light the fire again and there's a quote that I've listed on the back of our forms there that I had first to give out and it just kind of talks about how you know God moves in a particular generation and then you know I mean that generation is on fire and then that fire is actually affecting the next generation but once it gets to about the third or fourth generation down he says the fire begins to go out until it's just embers it's just this embers until God likes to fire again and and I feel like we have entered into the season where we see just embers and we're doing everything we can in order to see God like the fire again a man we need Holy Ghost fires a man it keeps us all clean keeps the church clean over when we're all amen operating underneath and man the presence of God so just keep that in mind amen and whether it's whether it's backsliders that come let not light the fire can even some of us need to go and get on fire real it again all right and you know and even for the church there's no controlling more like the fire again so we were just under expectation that God's going to do something mighty force and we want to approach those services with prayer if you want to fast a man for them I'm sure that that would be appreciated they men but we're just expecting God to move in a very special way praise the Lord so that's thumb that concludes the announcements will have the brothers also prepare to come for this morning Tizen offering and while we're praying over the Tizen off from a previous request amen that we have as well on today and man praise the Lord thank you Jesus not right after the offering sister Sarah we'll have you come in and do your special for us [Music] praise the Lord let's just bow a father we are grateful for the opportunity we have to give to you as we give Lord we pray to to receive this and let it be used for the furtherance of your kingdom here on earth thank you for continuing to meet the needs of this church thank you for continuing to meet the needs of your people thank you for providing a ways that go beyond our expectations father we just commit our giving father into your your hands even right now we also want to remember these prayer requests God miss Gwen who just had surgery on her back and got going through so many complications the husband is sharing this from one thing to the next and there's this frame that you would touch her if you raised her up that you God would just intervene on her behalf and and Lord we just commit her down to your hands we also want to pray for this family this father that has gone home to be with you a accident with a riptide Lord he saved his son but losses on life and thank God we're praying that you it just gives strength to his family - it helped them there they were on vacation a time just to enjoy themselves and such a tragedy a man occurs we know that it didn't catch you by surprise we know that you knew all about it beforehand but God surround them with the love of the Saints and God give them strength just to keep persevering and pressing on they are certainly in need of you and God we remember amen the church there is in Bob way that lost her pastor got continue to give them strength and amen help them got through the season so much is happening this happening so fast so that helped us all to keep our eyes on you and Lord just to make make sure that you're first in our hearts and in our lives just in Jesus name we pray amen a man raised alarm [Music] [Music] strong in the right room and I believe this is gonna take [Music] bless my version yearn for the darkness and from blood I want away yes I ever tried this perfect routine ah save me from my every we saw me to the thing I play this is that I love so but in time their faces can be found fifty waves is out they just cleaned up and it seems it's my mother dog and I wore away it's perpetual to deal I say before [Applause] [Music] [Music] my for the time Oh Hey unless my sugar the time and and way we don't be sorry [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah oh my thank you for that song sister Sara spoiled into the faith that brief think about the words of that song again knowing that my mom wrote it and when I look at just where things are you know you know you know you know you know God sometimes and I was just reading this recently I don't know exactly where it was but there was a person talking about how when you're going through trials and tribulations if you're a songwriter that's where God actually gives you your your songs is through your trial and often times a man you think the song is for you during your trial but actually what variety it was let you go through something to give a song for a trial that become a much later alright maybe 20 years later but that song would be right there to minister to the need that some say restore me to the failure you know just think about the words from this truth that I walk away I mean mama didn't know what she was writing way back then but from this truth I walk away notice notice how I know the spirit just bring it right back around safe we scared me to new faith not just a faith but they think restore it to that faith I pray God is a good God God is a good God come on give him a hand of praise [Applause] all Jesus please line up walk away this time this perfect route to the math restore me to the food I pay me to play and sing it with this perfect route 59 [Music] [Music] from the likes I work away and a try this will be true to be my chain oh wait let's sing it one more time she this right Oh ever try this'll be true to thee miss Toby to the bay it's new me too whilst I will be too somebody most of them somebody please somebody thank you Jesus just bad with being a word of Prayer now that song ministers to our hearts take our minds just go on under so many God that struggling right now and just thinking about the song Lord how it was birth and Lord not even realizing what those words would mean to us today but God it means so much of this menace is all over to us again we thank you for it and God our hearts just go out to your bride that's all a little bit of place sometimes they're in the messes churches best you got bride also in denominational churches that you're trying to bring out not we pray that they were here that horse of the low marks and God that you restored to the faith many enough turned and walked away but restore so the faith you promised God that I will restore saith the Lord and we hold you to your word fathers we just prepare our hearts to enter into a little bout here today we trust that the Holy Spirit would just take complete control thank you for all the specials that have been brought forth thank you for the anointing that is in this place father as we've entered into the worship now let us enter into the words and God speak to our hearts today in the name of Jesus we pray amen amen god bless you let's get a look at another hand a place a man man thank you musicians we certainly appreciate you man y'all stand with me as we read the word of God I was learned something as I was away last week and this pastor made a comment and and I'm still in his comment because I believe it he said I got the best Church in the message I said no no no no I got the best Church and the message and we got the best singers we got the best musicians we got the best in every area that's what we got we got the best brothers we got the best sisters we got the best a man we thank God for that so god bless you all we really really appreciate amen everything that's happened thus far in the name of the Lord I just remember the Johnson family predict they got themselves away for a little vacation and I think that's that's needful amen for for everybody at different times try to get yourself a little rest or vacation a man and you know I think I think it's it's just always very appropriate just just only thing I accept you don't do is when it's like a big service get ready to come up don't plan for vacation on the big service time right that's one we want all hands on deck so you can take the vacation after the big service right or before the big service but don't do it oh you know the same week that we've been announcing this for 14 weeks all right so don't don't do it like that aid man praise the Lord but but we just thank God for all things I'm gonna read a man a couple scriptures I feel the sermon that I'm a priest today is something that I know the Lord Lord have didn't want me to preach this a long time ago and and I felt like I might have failed the Lord and not preaching this a man but uh but now I want to just kind of touch this but there's so many different angles a man that we can hit from this and I'm just praying that the Lord help us to find where where where we supposed to be but I've been telling you all for a while that I had a sermon on containment a man containment and I want a minister on that today so I'm gonna read this out of numbers 12 and verse 10 through I think I got 10 through 16 praise the Lord numbers 12 verse 10 through 16 a man and it says this and the cloud departed from off the tabernacle and the whole Miriam became leprous whitest know and Aaron looked upon Miriam and behold she was lepers and Aaron said unto Moses alas my lord I beseech thee late not to stand upon us wherein we have done foolishly and wherein we have sinned let her not be as one day of whom the flesh is half consumed when it cometh out of his mother's womb and Moses cried unto the Lord saying heal her now o God I beseech thee and the Lord said unto Moses if a father had but spit in her face should she not be ashamed 7 days let her be shut out from the camp seven days and after that let her be received in again and Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days and the people journey not til Miriam was brought in again and after what the people removed from hazarat and pitched in the wilderness of Iran a man the Lord and a blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated Amen here in the presence of the Lord I have a couple things that I just want to try to make mention we'll see how the Lord just kind of brings this all all together a man we want to talk on this this thing of containment and just quickly you know looking at the scripture that we just read this you know there was there was something happened here where Miriam a man ended up actually becoming leprous alright that this uh and and just so that we we we understand what calls the leprosy and Miriam's case was that Miriam began to criticize God's servant a man I want you all to stay with me on this Miriam begins to criticize my like Miriam but Aaron also began to criticize God's servant now now understand Moses was Miriam's younger brother Moses was Aaron's younger brother a man but but what they fail to be able to do a man is actually separate right their younger brother from being the servant of God not just the servant of God but being a prophet of God right and here they are you know if you were read that the beginning part that chapter they were they were talking amongst themselves criticizing and and one of the things that that was said a man in verse two of that stain chapter they said half the Lord indeed spoken only by Moses happy not spoken also by us and the Bible say the Lord heard it right so so here here there there there they're criticizing Moses now now I want y'all to catch something here this is numbers 12 a man that Amen that this is spoken and they're saying half the Lord indeed spoken only by Moses hath he not smoke spoken also by us and yes God they used him yes there were there were plenty of times where I mean I mean Miriam was actually considered a prophetess so God didn't use or God they used air and God God used them but gosh they had a special place for Moses amen now now here's the thing that I want you to catch this is numbers 12 but when you get over amen in the Book of Numbers amen you get over into amen I believe it might be us chapter 16 and and things like that you know Cora comes up and Cora makes a similar statement and in verse three in chapter 16 verse 3 Paul says and they gather themselves together against Moses lie and against Aaron and said unto them you take too much upon you seeing all the congregation are holy and then every one of them and the Lord is among them let wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation a man of the Lord so now here what color is doing if it's kind of trying to put Moses on the same platform a plateau as everybody else hallelujah I hope y'all stay with me on this the car car is trying to a man belittle Moses as ministry and then cross trying to counter dumb it down and make it make it seem like it's nothing but but but I want you understand in numbers 12 that spirit started and more and Moses family numbers 12 Korah got ahold of it Oh God Korah got hold of it but that thing started with Miriam and with Aaron you see and notice now when it started with Mira Nair Aaron God came down corrected man and Aaron he told sin now now and you know back over in numbers 12 let me just you know just kind of will work with this here just a little bit just the Bible say this a man I want to I want to just stay with me here a man says I'm a verse 5 I'm back at numbers 12 verse 5 it says so the Lord came down in the pillar of the cloud and stood in the door the tavern I can call Aaron and Miriam and they both they both came forth now before I go too much further net I wanted all we're always we also remember they are criticizing Moses for the woman that he married right they're criticizing Moses because he married an Ethiopian okay and him being an Israelite they're criticizing his marriage okay now now now you know not his revelation not-not-not is understanding of alert - teaching own godheads night is teaching on water baptism but but they got they got other little things that they coming up with but they're criticizing that God heard it stay with me here today all right you know because the same spirit is repeating in the land today okay and I so so here in verse five says and the Lord came down in the pillar of cloud and stood in the door of the tabernacle call Aaron and Miriam and they both came forth and they said here now my words if there be a prophet among you I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and will speak unto him in a dream but says my servant Moses is not so who is faith when all my house so no matter how much the other people trying to belittle Moses ministry God was exalting it they said my servant Moses is not so was faithful on my house with him will I speak mouth to mouth even apparently and not in dark speeches and the Simla tune of the Lord shall be about behold well for them were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses and the anger of the Lord was kindled against him and he departed as we just read what happened after dang the Lord was kinder pon them when the glory to lifted up they looked install a Miriam was lepers now she wasn't left wrist before the pallet that this was the Spirit of God came down but when the Spirit of God came down and lift that they found out that she was left with Aaron diagnosed that she was lepers and here God you know God had that upside now what when a person is leprous what you have to do is actually isolate them alright now why why are they being isolated why it's containment Oh y'all stay with me here I I want to just kind of talk to y'all just a little bit about this if I can its containment its containment because leprous well I mean when a person was actually full of leprosy what I mean they became just right and in order to contain it so that other people are not introduced to it right then they had to isolate the person now notice notice now here another person goes into isolation they meant they not to stay there they they may have to go there but they're not to stay there if you notice down the scripture God did not even move the camp God did not even move the children of Israel until and until our medium came back in now she had to go through a period of time where she had to be isolated but the isolation is not amen it's not to keep you there eventually we want to see you made home and go back into the circle bear with me here today right containment was the reason that she was placed out of the camp and anytime a person had leprosy they was placed outside of the camp right this is this is just what the law was and in the law that that whole thing on containment it was not a punishment to the person it's not a punishment to them but but what we're doing is because you got with you because you've been infected in order to protect everybody else then we have to contain you it's not just this I mean I you know what you know just a few weeks ago my wife was uh was was feeling a little sick a man and you know when she was feeling a little sick she she would avoid you know every every morning before we leave the house and everything we gather round and we have a little word of Prayer and and and I give my wife a kiss she give me a kiss and you know we and we part for the day and but when my wife was feeling a little sick a man she would she would avoid kissing me you know she pretty much just picked me on the check on the cheek I should say she'll pick me on the cheek cuz she want me to pick him see but don't don't kiss me in my mouth because because I'm sick and I don't want you to get what I got now when she tell me to peck on the cheek it's not that she upset with me it's not that she mad at me right it's not it's not that she feel indifferent towards me but but the reason she said no no kiss me right in the mouth because what I'm trying to do is prevent you from getting sick so just pick me on the cheek but it's not a punishment a man it's a protection right and when you can see it from that angle a man then you can do you can really help somebody because because sometimes we think that that's just but no it's not punishment or glory because I'm not following you on facebook that's not punishment because I'm disconnecting from your Instagram that's not punishment get a mix I'm trying to protect myself and I'm trying to protect you let me let me let me work with it here a little bit a little bit you know a little bit more you know I was I was thinking about when I preached the sermon I was gonna get myself a little table and put it out here and all my computer man that at that in the church they're gonna understand you know this but as I was thinking on this from the sermon you know I'm just I was like man how can i really bring this out so that everybody can understand and I thought about sister Tonya being in the medical field and as some of the things that she have to deal with in the medical field right and some of the people that got certain cases you know when they find out that the person got it they try to isolate and they have to go through certain protocols right and let me let me also just just just interject this certain people are qualified to go through the protocols so when they sit in the nurse out to visit they know the nurse has been properly trained or y'all gotta stay with me the nurse has been properly trained to be able to deal with that right don't just send anybody in there because they might come back with the same disease sometime they come in have no stuff all over they face that stuff that that's not you know from the you know be be be mean to you anything like that but but I got a family that I'm going back to my gosh I got some funk that I need to tend to at home and I can't take what you got back to them so I gotta come in in a protective way you can't expose yourself to everything [Music] hello somebody you can expose yourself to everything you gotta know how to handle it and the reason that they have to approach it that way sometimes lewd area insensitive let them look like they don't have any feeling look like they just don't have any emotion I could start but no it really is concern the reason that I'm acting this way is I gotta protect some other people now I'm using a natural type but I hope you can follow me spiritually then disturb this topic this ain't got nothing to do that I don't love you yes I do love you and the reason I love you is I got to contain what you got because I don't want other people to get it I thought about so now you know I'm a computer guy and I have to I have to look at things from a computer perspective so I said man I've thought about this bringing me a table and having y'all bring y'all laptops and I was going to plug your laptop's into our network don't create a little network so yeah with a network I don't have I wish I would have all the props here for y'all I wish I would have but the network you have a hub oh my god you have a hub and and and in order to plug your computer this is before Wi-Fi before Wi-Fi they have what we call wired connections and it'll be a cable that looks something like this it's an Ethernet cable it's about this thick and when you plug one end into your computer and then you take the other end you have to put it inside the hub or the switch and in order for you to get the information off my computer you're gonna have to be connected to the hub huh yeah I'll talk about the full Wi-Fi not now with Wi-Fi you know they still have you with Wi-Fi you can still get connected because we all get on the same router right and and you have some that you have to know the name the network halleluyah not only know the name of the network but you have to know the password through the network and once you get the password in the name of the network and you can get onto the Wi-Fi hallelujah some us a man we're so attached to Wi-Fi a man but when we walk to a person's house and we've never been to before praise the Lord we walk in a man with this you know why God bless you how you doing yes yes you sit down and pull your phone out and and the first question that's your mouth you know they got Wi-Fi because you see it pop it all up right you know what you know they got a network in there but you want to know what is the password because you're trying to get home oh you're trying to get connected right and then this this is the you know the society which we live today everybody want to be connected but but when you're on the network and in my day we have these things you know I'm just y'all just bear with me I wanna I wanna I want to give you just a couple of things here you know in my day when you got on the network right in your computer got a virus what we would have to do in order to contain the virus we actually have to take you off the network we have to disconnect your computer now look we want to use your computer there's a lot of processing power there and you've been you've been able to get some work done amen but but but when you get infected it's a possibility that they think is sprayed onto some of the other computers alright y'all y'all bear with me here let me let me let me let me go into this just a little deeper for you if I can anybody ever been impacted by malware now let me just tell you let me give some to some definitions now where is malicious code a software that secretly insert it itself into the system to compromise the confidentiality malware compromises the competition malware compromises the integrity and malware compromises the availability I wish I could preach all that but some of the stuff that's been released only on the internet about this message that we believe it's compromising the integrity of our messenger you see CC chief of the intelligence is doctrine nearly came against things that that that that devil is integrity the person that he married and what these people come up with is things that deal with the integrity of the puppet I'm talking about the doctrine but when you recognize this spirit then we gotta do certain things to contain it and whether he is his ways to contain something is disconnect from I'm gonna tell you something I'm gonna change something I want to change some only a priest dealt with leprosy only a priest that's in Leviticus 13 and 14 only the priest could pronounce whether you had it or didn't have it and then they have different forms of leprosy they had they had leprosy that be in the skin and in Miriam's case she got it enough for hint no no no no is that right no I'm sorry oh my it wasn't her - Gavin forehead I want to see this Lord has his name Uzziah used I got it in his forehead now I want you to know something about about values aiya the way that he obtained leprosy and this is why only a priest should be able to deal with this state and this is a statement on they preach to deal with it because Uzziah try to usurp the position of a priest and when he tried to take the place of a priest he ended up with leprosy and yelling get it when you're trying to correct everybody and get them straight on the word before you know it you can infect it with leprosy that's why you turn that thing over to peace and let the priests and lit the way he had it brother Troy so y'all alone from Wednesday night and I was I mean there's been things I've been able to detect because I get a call from out of nowhere I better call them and you know I got questions about the message you know I don't mind answering people's questions one thing that I'm I'm not gonna say that because I don't want the devil to get ahold of that and did start creating some problems around here I'll say this that our church has been blessed so far and I thank God for that but I know that the more we keep entertaining this stuff somebody gonna end up with some leprosy around here spiritual leprosy yeah hallelujah the more we keep entertaining it it's gone it's gonna come right but but so what we're trying to do is you know when you recognize something I got a lot to say here right when you recognize something there's certain ways that you should handle lips right because because you got to get it back to the police and let the priests be the one to judge whether it's Darren I'm not there you know it's bad leprosy in your clothing the priests were the one to say that that piece of garment has to be destroyed burn it they they they whether was in the skin wear those in the fire wherever it was the police gonna want to diagnose it and the priest wouldn't want to deal with it hallelujah oh my god cuz you know people tell you oh you know this brother hearing them this and he ain't done that hearing them missing than that and and see next thing you know you start sympathizing with them can I tell you all something evil spirit gets few fuel from when people sympathize with it y'all ain't going with me today I got I got things to read I got some things to read I got a lot to read here but when you're with it all right you know I'm trying let me let me read y'all just at least this one quote here give me this is a resurrection of Lazarus and this is the second one 1950 0 813 8 I got something to read here I just want to read this ayah y'all just bear with me here just for just for a few minutes glory to God look at this now it says if you keep your stomach empty and it's talked about fasting you said the blood is that your ring if you keep your stomach empty the blood is at your brain and you must be ready right and if you if you're all full that's the power of fasting this was 1950 0 813 amen it says he said that's the power fashion when you're full the blood goes into your stomach to digest your food you see and then when you're empty it's in your brain so so you can be custom because them two spirits are so close they could deceive the very elect if possible hallelujah now listen is he says and many times you hear it cry I've heard people shout now as I told you I hope God that has let me find favor with you that you believe me I've heard people shout when it wasn't God I've heard people cry when it wasn't God see in their sympathy sometimes look at what they say their sympathy sometimes the devil wants to be paid you came back pebbles you cache pebbles notice notice notice how you pet the devil simply you know y'all getting that it's due sympathy they won't sympathy I'm gonna tell you how you know sir evil spirit as soon as this is asking for sympathy I would say Christians Christians are rugged if y'all don't believe that go back to David David was rugged David when when a man that should have been crying out for sympathy is when he got back to the camp and not only was the man's family gone but his family was gone right rather than each man all band together with David these men decide we gonna kill you thinking and the Bible say David encouraged him so nobody was dead in curse painted David encouraged himself Christians are rugged so when you don't you know the first thing that some men say what you know I went through this today nobody called me well now you know you put yourself through that you know that right you did that to yourself that's not that's not on me that's on you and if and if you got leprosy think too many people couldn't call you cuz leprosy is contagious alright alright it says and that's tripathi sometimes the devil wants to repent it now look now look at what he says here and it takes a real sheep razor to know the difference between the blade of a goat and the land a goat puffs and sound just like a lamb but they bucking the word hallelujah if you give a person the word and they can't receive that you know something wrong with this spirit right here but restore me to the faith I pray listen it takes a real sheep razor to know the difference and I've been you know i'ma just say this because people been said we're brother Jack you don't call and you don't do this you don't do that well I call she it takes a real cheap razor to know the difference between the blade of a goat and a lamb they're so close together you see prese love somebody I'm just trying to contain some things I don't we other one other one see stuff sweet little touch everybody get infected let's go back to this malware cuz we all but we've all experienced if you got a computer a new units based malware you know what what happens up to time with with malware is that especially when you're trying to surf the Internet and you go to click on something and then just something just pop up out of nowhere I then click on that and then you try to get that off the screen into your going and eventually what happened yep computer can't even be used because of the infection you need a specialist you need somebody knows something about computers to help you get rid of that hallelujah alright now let's talk about some of these there's pierce malware also is categorized a certain different ways you know and I won't use all of them but I'll just I'll just mention and one is viruses and others worms and others Trojan horses and others malicious mobile code and then another's tracking cookies alright these are things that happen on the computer you know and this is how how viruses spreads glory to God hallelujah have y'all ever noticed that you can be on the Internet I'm doing a little something just surfing this net and then all certainly trying to sell you something that that you just looked at a couple days ago they tracking your cookie I understand in tracking your cooking you don't put some information in because you saw something that you really liked and you put your information in there oh and then they know what even though you didn't go through with buying it you put your information in there so not a tracking and they keep presenting it to you keep throwing it at you keep throwing it and the only way you can get rid of that is you've got to delete your cookies I'm preaching but here here I want you to understand what a virus is a virus is a self-replicating code that inserts copies of of itself into other programs and data files right so it's a virus or something that's self-replicating all right so so it's self-replicating you get it over here and you click on something here and that reproduces itself over there and then it reproduce itself over here you drop you just trying to find where this thing at on your computer and you need special software to go onto your computer try to identify all the areas that have been infected all the files that have been affected and clean that up you need you need special software you can't do that on your own that's why they call it virus protection in order to contain it a worm is a self-replicating self-contained program that executes without user intervention so if you get a worm on your computer you don't even have to click nothing to be infected that's why you got to be very careful as to what to do with your computer and who you let you should confuse all right let me go a little further now this is this is one of the worst ones that can happen to a computer this one's called the Trojan horse and the Trojan horse is is self-contained it's non-replicating amen and the thing about the Trojan horse it appears to be benign but it actually has a hidden malicious purpose now Lord would you ignore me to help the people understand what I'm saying now in our history what happened is that there was a nation that was just dominating the southern nation every time they would go to battle they were they would constantly of defeat this nation well well what the nation decided to do is that we don't create a gift and we don't give them this gift you know sometimes even when you click it on gifts gif when you're clicking on them they have horses I mean they have they have stuff behind them that's why you got to be careful what you'll be posting you got to be careful and you'll get everybody everybody that you send it to will end up with the infection because they clicked on all right stay with me but but this nation was defeated this nation and in this upper nation and I saw the nation that was confident and he said oh we gonna give them a gift and they built this horse huge horse and they went up to the gates of the city they knocked on the gates of the city and then said we got a gift for y'all with all these walls and everything we've been having we can't penetrate these walls and we just got we just got a gift for you please please take this difference bigger a huge choice they're like well wonderful when I saw who the horse inside the gates of the enclosing gates and when they closed the gates not normally there were warriors inside the horse and when they opened up the roster warriors came out and just went to town and that nation got defeated because they allowed something in that should've never came here well know how people get viruses spiritually leprosy they allow things in that should have never came in and you want to know how they start it they allow it sympathy now you know I let me try to make this plain cuz I don't think I'm plain enough y'all I used this example many times before I told you all the story is my my my family going to this hairdresser and it was all going to the hairdresser enjoying the headdress I saw already had like what yeah that looked good well yeah that looked good yeah everybody's feeling good about themselves and one day one of them one out of our house seven over seven of them something like that one of them had a bad experience who did you that so-and-so oh do you I mean out of all the others that had good experiences one of them had one bad experience and you know what you know what happened after that after one not six or seven one had one bad experience do you know all of them stopped going I'm saying it for a reason ain't done nothing wrong to you what's your talk about going somewhere fun leave it what have I done to you what you're doing is connecting with sympathy oh yeah okay you you connect it with sympathy or somebody else and what and you know and oftentimes oftentimes you know I have to do what I have to do with certain people I see something there and I got to work with them where there but don't allow you to get connected with sympathy and that's not just me that's just with any of us I'm gonna tell you I'm going somewhere with these things that that's with any of us right if somebody tell you something about somebody else you start connecting with sympathy and trying to take up for them you don't realize you invite the Trojan horse in and before you know it you're in the church don't know either so Jesus give us a way to handle these things let's go let's go and see what Jesus said let's see what Jesus says 8:2 Matthew 18:15 this is what Jesus safe and it you know and what you when you hear this type of stuff its containment y'all right because if you if you if you don't contain it just spreads out and just keep spreading then so many people are infected and let me tell you something about a story if I tell you something and you tell us somebody else you are not going to see it exactly the way I said it and guess what the person that you tell comes tell somebody else they not gonna see it exactly the way you think and before you know it we got a rumor weed and when you get it all the way back to you know the person where I started I'm like nah that ain't even the truth and everybody is its operating under a lie Oh y'all and got it everybody is functioning and you come to church with a bad spirit because you actually controlled by Allah right right and you got you got what I call spiritual leprosy hallelujah you've been influenced by somebody else you don't dance on I mean and it should never be that way if we follow Jesus the churches taste safe we can contain it now look at this look at this Matthew 18 verse actually 15 yeah moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee go and tell him go and tell him that's not what we do just saying what we do we would tell everybody else before we actually tell him or her right so if your brother your sister a man trust bats against thee go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone i'ma just i'ma just say these things I you know somebody that called me one time and they were still just just you know they they had they had all these issues about this person had all these issues I said would you meet with me and this person just to kind of go over the issues and I said no I think the way that we supposed to do that is that since you have issues that a person you're supposed to go directly to them and you're supposed to get that straightened out and and then you know then we go from there so it's say well I don't mind going to them but would you go with me I say I don't mind going with you after after you've done what Jesus see it do so I don't mind going with you but it's gonna be after I ain't going with you before right but after you do what Jesus saying can I be glad to be right there and join you because what you find out is that the thing has already been settled they just rehashing something or trying to and and if they call them me without going to that person first I already know it's a spirit behind it this is leprosy Oh y'all I hope y'all with me we've got to contain things let's go on let's go on see that and let me tell you another thing when you contain a leprosy you can't be there well I got them both together I got this one again I got that one together maybe maybe you like the one that should be getting everybody together maybe maybe you need to get the past involved I'll tell you what we're gonna do I'm want to stay out of this but I will I'm a car brother Jack and now if you say I'm a car brother Jack no no we'll need to go there you all that that should be a dead giveaway and when if this is a dead giveaway don't you entertain that conversation anymore you let them know right then the buck stops here we ain't talking about that no more you don't call my phone no more to talk about that we're gonna contain that now we can talk about other things but not that and as soon as they start going down that path and you know you can tell when they get ready to go they start working all the way around in here they come back so I did not tell you that I ain't talking about that number with you keep people on the word and you call me one more time me and you gonna go to brother Jack all right don't talk about containment this hot this how we keep the church clean that's the one moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone if he shall hear thee thou hast gained thy brother but if he will not hear thee then take with thee one or two more that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established now you know sometimes what we want to do is take people that we know gonna agree with us don't do that if you want to get to the bottom of the thing you want to sell it get somebody don't know nothing at all like the pastor because the pastor's the last one to know everything it's the truth in it hi I know what I'm talking about the past is the last to know leacy act like it you'd be surprised at what the pastor knows and just and and sometime you just got to hold it in just and sometimes it just be wondering just just bladedge you know right no don't see just just just just just let it go and the other thing you have know about a pastor the pastor is a person that can't start with nobody he's not supposed to you see a pastor side of something wrong somewhere right but a pastor supposed to be able to take both parties together listen to both sides and then come right down the middle amen all right all right y'all still here okay listen verse 16 right says but if you were not here thee then take with thee one or two more that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established and if he shall neglect to hear them telling them to the church but if he neglect to hear the church let him be unto thee as a heathen man and as a publican so what were they pretty much saying that you got personal I guess that don't want don't want to make things right in the church do you let them go that's what let me be is a key to the puzzle and I don't even you know you don't even want to make things right here we've gone through of the proper protocols and you don't want to make things right you won't you don't create problems here so we're gonna have to just let you go and we have to isolate you put you in containment our hope is that why you've in contained that you'll come to yourself I want to make that thing right and now we can come back and receive you you know when a person has done that way you know that the church not even supposed to pray for you know why because when you pray for them the blood of Jesus is actually covering them and can't actually get to them to do what need to be done we don't we don't we don't hear these things over but it's the truth anyhow so let me um you know when we talk about containment all right Jesus gives us how we spoil the handle things even amongst ourselves because you know that's not leprosy even spread through the church don't pet no devil don't pet a devil cast the devil out okay now let me just read a couple of things you know even if there's a terrorist attack citral intelligence will do all they can to contain the source of the attack if there was an oil leak out in the ocean they gonna do everything they can to contain the oil leak they're not just gonna let it keep spreading and you know and I have to be I have to come and preach sermons like this because I don't want stuff that just keeps keep spread so we gotta try to contain stuff listen when it's an outbreak of a flu or any other type of virus we isolate the infected person and isolating them amen what we're trying to do is just contain the virus so that it does not spread to anybody else now I'll talk to you about computers and with the computer world when I disconnect your computer I got to come and work on your computer in order to be able to get you reconnected but there are certain protocols I got to take your computer through before I feel comfortable about being able to get you back on the network now sometimes if you're if you're if you're if you're viruses is it's just a little bit too much the best thing for me to do rather than just put a program on there and try to clean it up and get the virus get the virus off and put you back on the network the best thing for me to do is actually to reimage your computer oh my god brother Devon you understand even man but I have to reformat start all over with your computer again and you know what that takes time sometimes you can't clean up viruses overnight so in your sympathetic ways don't be well I won the win no no no what you keep doing is praying but don't try to be the priest because you might get leprosy when you try to become the priest sometimes you ain't got to be the one to let people know where you stand they know where you stand they know where you stand you got to be the one I just I need to let them know they gonna throw something at you envy what you don't invited a Trojan horse in and you're trying to figure out why you feeling the way you feeling there's certain ways things need to be handled now when when a person realizes that they have been infected with malware there are actually six steps that they go through one is preparation where they develop a malware specific incident handling policy and procedure another is detection and analysis where the you deploy and monitor antivirus anti-spyware a spyware software and when you're monitoring it you're reading all the malware advisories and they're telling you all the new stuff that's been released that then how to protect yourself from it so as the detection and announces that happen and then the third thing that they said this is this is right off the internet all right the third thing they do is containment all right and and and and in the containment stage say be prepared to shut down a server or a workstation or block services like email web browsing the Internet access to contain a malware incident no let me be that in the containment phase you need to be prepared to shut down so so remember I came here a few weeks ago and I said some of y'all allow to go for seven days off of off of social media just take a break seven days off Assoc mean especially artists stuff that was spreading at the time and again people won't simple and you you just right there sympathize with no no no no a devil can't be petted and I'm not telling you to be the one I better you know you got a devil million I'm catch that mouth ain't betting the way you handle nothing ain't ain't no what you do I'm praying for you and I'm a Tina I'm not saying that you got to completely avoid people can't talk to know that it's just you got to know what to talk about and what not to talk about that's what containment is right you know not to go on that no we're not gonna go in there there I see that that's gonna be a problem let's just find something else to talk about the man the weather pretty good I've been enjoying this weather needed some rain on my grass and thank God for sin and rain talk about something else praise the Lord all right but but in the containment stage you need to be prepared to shut down or block services some calls you should just block some emails you shouldn't respond to hallelujah all right another one is eradication be prepared to use a variety of rear a dication techniques to remove the malware from infects the infected systems another fifth stage is recovery and in the recovery phase what we're trying to do is restore the confidentiality restore the integrity and restore the develop availability so so we have to restore that first we got to get you to a man do you do you do you have you been restored back to the faith amen oh no we're not talking about some of these other stuff that people Bri I'm talk about the faith you believe God sent a prophet do you believe it what was his name we got to restore that because that's what recreates the fellowship Amen church glory to God hey man listen in the last the last stage of this four year when you when you're recovering a man from malware the last stage is is report and what the report is you gather the lessons learned after each malware incident to avert you gather lessons learn in order to avert similar future infant so we got to get you you know what did you learn from that and now you see you can't be going every website reading everything how about you you're going deeper but then we got something beat for you all right I want to read something here for you a man Oh a couple things I want to read for you this is out of the message influence yes yes just give me give me just a little bit more of your time the will will bring this home I'm talk about containment don't pet no Devils once you recognize that they Devils you got a this separate amen that's that's in order to protect yourself and to protect others all right and the message influence the Prophet says God said preach the gospel demonstrate the power of the Holy Ghost these signs will follow them that believe not go make organizations have schools and so forth nothing gainst it but that don't take this offices place and we see now that men and women who try to take the anointed office when they were deign when they're not ordained to do it we see what happens to them I'm gonna say something here I'm gonna say something here when Uzziah being a king was supposed to stay a king when he tried to usurp his authority as a king and then take the priests office that's when he got struck with leprosy now you know you can be anointed to do a particular thing but don't mean you in order to do everything can I say that again you can be in order to do a particular thing but don't mean you learn it to do everything now I'm gonna give you a couple examples now when I was a song leader right and I was serving the Lord just as a song leader it was never my intention just to try to take the pulpit and start preaching God had to force me into that right but oftentimes what you get is a man that stands up before the people even in the anything of just your song sir he actually feel that well doc got me here doing songs every night to be able to go further start preaching the gospel and then you get everything all confused within two years a person that might be a good singer don't mean that they're going to be a good preacher a person that might be a good news musician before the people don't mean they're gonna be a good preacher but you see often times a lot of musicians try to take the position of being a preacher's well don't mean that don't mean that you got the same anointing on you a man Church right you know so so so we got it we got we gotta kind of watch that it's best just to stay humble before God God don't need you God don't need me God don't need nobody God can do this thing all by himself right but but we got to understand that you know uh sometimes when we start to exalt ourselves that's what that's what this venue sided he lifted himself up took a position that he was not supposed to have ended up with leprosy let me keep reading don't don't exalt yourself let God exalt you let God exalt you I'm standing a lot and I hope y'all can read between the lines I know what I'm saying I know exactly what I'm saying if we learn from these things in Scripture then we can prevent them from happening again and you know you know you I got a quote here brother branham talk about how you know people just came to church yesterday and two days three days later date date but Jack I was at home I was reading and boy who something that I'm ready ready for what getting ready for nothing ready to keep reading your Bible right but people think that they got one of the revelations they rather just do whatever they were they ready to preach the gospel no you ain't you sit there and overcome some stuff then but then we can talk about you preacher's son amen all right but here you know he goes on to say this not gonna make organizations have schools and so forth nothing against it but that don't take this office its place and we see now that men and women who try to take that anointed office when they're not ordained to do it we Steve what happens to them there's our example ministers we see it in the teenage life we see it everywhere that's don't watch man watch God take your eyes from man put it on God not influenced say old glory to God the Lord tells me thus that the Lord do so-and-so and it never happens so you're trying to impersonate something that you know nothing about don't do that it's dangerous you'll be stricken with leprosy with spiritual leprosy unbelief your denomination trying to build trying to build up get a feather in your hat to be a Presbyterian I'm saying some things there and I'm just I'm just you know one person that called me and was mentioning something about a brother that felt that God had called him to be an apostille Oh was that right he's called to be an apostille and I said do they even know what the word apostille mean you know that you know what apostille does and say it's a yeah yeah you go around they set up churches well where have they done that when and where have they've done that to happen they just feel like they've been called to be an apostle okay let me tell you something it don't work that way right I mean typically if a person has a call and they life they already been operating in that before they got the title before the title comes they've already been operating like that you can see it already on them before brother Troy you know became deacon y'all already saw certain things on him right amen before I became a pastor I can tell you people certain things on me as a little boy this just didn't happen overnight praise the Lord right a minister you can sit down you've just been sitting there talking to them and certain things that there's a certain way to conduct themselves you know that there's a call in there people can identify it let's see you got you got you got you got a problem in the church some was called and sent others just got up and went and the ones that got up and went end up with spiritual leprosy alright let's go ball a little bit further y'all stay with me I want to preach Ramin reform respects respects respects as a Miriam failed to have that respect for the office of the Prophet a man and many people today are also felling to have the respect for the office of the Prophet they try to make him just like any other minister but God had a very unique ministry for him and we thank God for that listen so there stood Miriam God said call Miriam and called Moses I'll call Aaron here your brother and sister to stand before me and when they come in before God God said don't you fear God said that to the high priest and to Miriam the prophetess said if there be any man among you spiritual a prophet I the Lord will make myself known to him I'll speak to him in visions and reveal myself and dreams to him and so forth if he's spiritual a prophet but say my servant Moses I speak lips to ear with him said don't you fear God in other words look at this in other words you talk about Moses you're talking about me if you can't respect Moses you don't respect me so haven't I proved among you that he's my servant and you have no reverence for him at all what that would be a lesson for people of this day no respects no Hana now he said him because you didn't do that that's the reason you got leprosy that's the reason these things as wimps that because you ought to have know that this was my servant you do know it look at that you're not just you all don't know it you do know it so when you say something against him you're saying it against me so Moses great for her life to be spared and God spared her life she didn't live very long afterwards she died but she did get cleansed of her leprosy and was out of the camp for seven days you know for having a for purification getting herself clean clean again from her left seat God healed her but what he was trying to get them get to them was this you got to respect what I do and if that was the attitude of God in that date and God can't change God wants us to respect what he's doing he demands it said you either respect that but something else is going to happen all right let me just slip back up here to this I was telling you all earlier I was blessed by a sermon recently the brother Whisperer grip when I had preached and he the title for the sermon was delivered from demonic black streets and he was talking about you know in that sermon how you know people just get a demon on them and to say in order for that demon to get strength when it's been getting ready cast out in order for the demon to get strength it has to get sympathy from another demon right and that's that's why I say you got to be watchful that don't pet no devil that double look at the sympathy and when you give it sympathy you've given the devil strength the only way you go defeat Devils is not by sympathizing with them only way you're gonna defeat them about casting them out amen all right let me uh let me there's one other quote here that I want to read for you maybe it may be two more we're talking about these uh oh yes yes right in here somewhere oh my let me just find it okay this is a to one out of the Church of the Living God and then the last one would be out of exhortation I believe the church and living God stay with me here we're talking about how these demons and see brother Branham could tell us these things he's working there from the platform casting out Devils and praying for people and he can see the demons now watch this this is over this way how many believe how many of you believe God just a moment way back with your hands up who has not prayer cars back there have faith believe now there's so many you're sitting here looking so strangely at me with with a tie ohm you've been praying haven't you sir yeah I see you knelt in a room and you pray if you could ever get near me you be healed is that right you suffer with a kidney trouble isn't that true Jesus Christ makes you hold my brother you stand to your feet right so the brother you know stands to Speedy's he'll do kidney trouble he says now there goes that spirit a blackness of darkness leaving that man seemingly you could see it watching it's got a sympathizing partner just a moment don't be a sympathizing partner to no devil I'm telling it amen it's got a sympathizing partner just a moment they're false just just just a moment yes they're false over man sitting there with a white t-shirt on black headed man his hands in his face stand up young man you suffer with kidney stones isn't that right accept Jesus now as your healer that healed you nineteen hundred years ago have faith in God don't doubt so here brother branham count the spirit cast out at one man this man having kidney trouble the

hit on the man there you see there and sympathy one with another you understand what I mean now see it's kindred spirits so you can have kindred spirits both good and or bad kindred spirits hey man we're trying to contain them you know what I mean dogs stay with doves scabbard I see it's like brothers you know they're together and that's the way this kindred spirit that cancer cancer is a demon it's a devil and I'll be real reverent and believe with all your heart all right I like the way you just said that does stay with doves brothers stay with buzzers you don't find them fellowshipping together they their diets are different and i'ma tell you since I just say they guys are different one other ways of actually obtaining leprosy is through what you eat you can actually get leprosy from what should be spiritually all right church be watch would be careful what you eat don't allow the devil to come in and give you the spiritual leprosy we want to contain that with everything we can and in the way that you contain it it's just follow what Jesus said a man just there's a problem go get the thing worked out and let's move on but don't let stuff just keep spreading all over the church and you know you know what this was said you know no no no we trying to contain leprosy amen when a person gets leprosy the other thing that you need to understand is leprosy can only be cured by God they cannot they I mean Ollie God can can fix that and if God don't fix it then it's over so everything that you try to do it ain't gonna work but if you put it in God's hands he can do great things and church I am like I said at the beginning when Miriam was called Amen - she's caught with the leprosy she had to leave the camp for seven days but they didn't move until she came back so the objective is not to keep them there the objective is to restore them back but understand there's a way that we have to do things and the reason that we do it that way is because we're trying to contain and protect everybody else praise the Lord god bless you god bless you hey man let's let's pray whispering father this little thought that you just put in my heart some time ago I first I want to apologize to you for failing to deliver this to the church god I ask that you would forgive me maybe Lord it could have helped somebody look earlier God helped me to be more sensitive to your voice into your spirit because you would just put things in my heart lord help me God just to share it I pray that today Lord that the church would be spiritual enough to really catch what you're trying to say when we look at the life of Miriam we see her actually Lord she she she she developed this leprosy because of her attitude course Moses your servant and God even though she went through this you still you still have mercy you still had grace and you brought it through you you did bring healing Moses pray for her healing and God you did bring healing and I know that your God that don't respect persons and I know today Lord that there's so many that has been impacted with this spiritual leprosy they have also rejected your word through your prophet some are confused don't even know why they feel the way that they feel but God I pray just as Moses prayed for Miriam I pray for so many that you would help them to see that's why that strong meant so much restored me to the faith I pray Lord has so many got this turn and walked away but God made you restore them to the faith give them understanding and revelation of your work Lord give them something that the devil can't take from them you said Lord upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell will not prevail against it so build it father on the revelation of who you are and what you're doing in this hour Lord let us be sensitive to the Spirit of God let us be mindful God of what what you're doing but also mindful what the devil is trying to do oh god don't let us miss it in this hour thank you for your love thank you for your mercy thank you for your grace it's in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus that we pray amen amen amen praise the Lord thank you Jesus thank you Jesus [Music] just give me the horses to this stuff [Music] just want you to just think about those words and so we just sing them to date maybe get in your heart somebody that you know this might be again confusion just don't know how to handle certain things maybe they're innocent situation where they're they're pulling from this word pulling away but just let's pray in our own way for that person as we sing this to the glory of God just pray from your heart for somebody we want to see people free we want to see them deliberate we want to see everybody make it they may less my heart's ignorant alas my heart again for the darkness from this like unless they ever tried this perfect roof to be back say become mine every way restore me to the face stick it again last my sugar from the dog as for the darkness Infernus right ever tried this perfect routine baby but my every way - sugar for the darkness Oh God - right this baby will shave my homie way mr. tuna for the story to defame Harvey mr. B to the face me too come on give the Lord a head the phrase [Music] thank you Jesus more they got up and just do something real quick mama could you just share the testimony of how that song was perfect [Music] praise the Lord you know coming into this perfect word after going through denominational system all my life I searched and searched and searched and God brought me to it and when he brought me to it it was like new life took hold of me I found myself in a place that I've never been in before spiritually for the better I've ridden some little songs a little I call them little Diddley songs before but once I came into this message it just anointed a gift that was in me that I didn't know and it just there was a song I believe the line is just a saying everything you touches a song and that's the way it became for me the messages would go forth and it was a place I was in and I had to experience this joy this joy and been in this message and is that it was revealed to me I could never imagine welcome lately I could never ever and this power of thinking that I could leave this message just better take them hating on that the words begin to come they just begin the confident Psalm formed in my heart and I remember I had no confidence in myself as a singer a new Lord was given these songs to write but I didn't know whether they were for me and for somebody else and I would sing the song I get in my car and I rolled the windows up real tight it was just so in me just so in me I just rolled those windows up real tight and I just blast with everything I said but nobody with me in the Lord heard it so one particular day I was on my lunch hour and it was a co-worker that was driving beside me and I didn't notice because I was just so caught up in the song and when I got back to work he came up to my desk I said what are you singing I said what do you mean he say ours beside you and he said you were just going at it you would just go and add it and he said I just want to know what was it that had gotten ahold to you like that oh it's just a little song I was singing that did there try to explain it to him but it stayed pretty much like that and during that time I was a part of the Okeechobee Church and we were talking about getting together put into putting the CD together and the Lord had given me quite a few songs at that and I introduced that one to the group and immediately they loved it they really really loved it and sister Judy Williams was the one that recorded it first did a beautiful job on it it's a really beautiful job and those kind of things begin to give me confidence in the gift the Lord had given me and I was really really really blessed happen to be up in Ohio was this Luis and we were going to do a recording a live recording with brother as a Brooks and Galante's were very much a part of that product project and sister sherry LaFontaine she came up to me and she was talking about what a blessing the song was this was after this CD was actually done and she just shared with me what a blessing and she asked me she said would you mind if I record that song I really thought there highly of the la Fontaine's and ii wanted them to ask to record that song and she did record it she introduced it to a whole new area people because she was involved with the gaze of singers and she went all over singing it as well and sings it so beautifully she does and I've heard many many many different ones sing it through the years and it blesses my heart it really blesses my heart I don't know one thing I might sing and I don't know I'm blessed is hearing the other ones all over God took a simple thought from my heart I never dreamed that would mean today what it meant then to see some of my loved ones walk away from this world some will were right there part of the recording of it and it just grew richer and richer to me as the years go by but I still have the testimony I couldn't walk away from it I couldn't it's a part of who I am it's made me who I am I can never deny those songs and Lord gave me and I'm looking for him to give me more I'm looking for more I just think God could be an investor just reuse it me birthday [Music] [Applause] just want to encourage you all different gifts your yield and let the Lord use your gifts man sometimes it's not for you but it's for others to bless others a song that mama wrote and when she said at the concert there she actually never sung the song itself but as pinna song has been taken by others and sing it and they've singing they've done you know really good jobs and it's one of those classics that just kind of stayed you know with you have been around for well over 20 years I believe still just you have an anointing that goes with it anybody that seems that just there's something there and I certainly for the season in which we live the words are very important Church keep keep your other brothers and sisters in prayer a man that got would just somehow let them see their airing way and be restored back to the truth amen sometimes you just get caught up in what everybody else is doing but got got a way of getting this people out of the middle and I believe that I believe that let's have a word of Prayer say man before we depart for today father we are grateful for your spirit God that we even feel right now in this place thank you for your anointing that destroys yokes thank you God for what you're doing thank you that on what even as this video was seen by others Lord that maybe something will strike the heart of a believer you just begin a talk you begin the pool God you pull them right out of the condition that they're in and begin to restore them back to truth but we believe that containment is not Lord to completely shut off and never never receive again but God is to restore is to protect us to restore is to do all of those things God that would just just help everybody Lord and that's that's our desire so I pray father that you would discipline to receive it in the way that you were trying to give it to us bless us as we prepare to leave this place but not your presence may we go rejoicing and meditating on the words that we've heard here today may you bring us back at the point of time Wednesday night Lord the hours late time is winding up Lord let us be let us be ready Jesus in prayer let us be ready it's in the name of Jesus that we pray amen I didn't get a chance to say this earlier but Church please please know that we we're closer now than we've ever been to the coming of the Lord things are happening so fast around us we got a stain amen in a state where we're ready you all may be aware of the United States dropping bombs there on Syria Russia has you know made a comment that they you know once they determine everything that they found out the United States is to understand you know they they they want to involve themselves with something and church when you start getting big nations like this talking you could wake up in the morning things of changes you know I mean you thinking that is going to be one way of the things that change so fast from you if you don't know Jesus you better get to know Jesus real quick right but don't play games with this you know I just believe God is just giving us all fair warning and amen and we need to make things right with God if we need to repent repent you know get right with God but don't don't get caught amen in this season with your work undone so I just want to encourage you all they then to be ready when he comes before it gets too bad God has promised in a rapture a man would take his bride away so we're under expectation for that we want to live every day ready a man for that rapture so the Lord bless you brothers will come at this time amen and they will dismiss you it man god bless you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you
