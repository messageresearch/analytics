praise we are people of god we came from the mind of god we are walking in the mind of god and when we finish we go back to the mind of god so nothing can take us away from the man of christ and what is the man of christ eternity we are just eternal as eternal can be amen glory hallelujah last week or a week after we spoke on a little title the land of beulah and we want to progress from the same thought we want to just say part two want to just twist it a little bit uh to give us more breaking amen more understanding we're going to title it bill at the land of blessing the land of lesson and we want to read the same scripture that we read plus a couple other scriptures so we want to without much ado let's take our bibles and those listening we want to open to the book of isaiah chapter 62 and we read from verses 1 to 5. isaiah 62 verse 1 to 5. and the prophet of god said that when you read every scripture and you don't see jesus christ go back and read it again and we read the scriptures and you don't see yourself in those promises of god go back and read it again so we are not talking about zion a mountain somewhere in israel we are talking about you the body of christ the wife of jesus christ amen so isaiah 62 1-5 for zion's sick i will not hold my peace in other words for your sick the lord will not rest until he brings you to the land of promise the land of blessing beulah for zion's sake i will not hold my peace and for jerusalem sick i'll not rest until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness and the salvation thereof has a lamp that burns and the gentiles shall see thy righteousness and all kings thy glory and thou shalt be called by a new name when the lord calls you he gives you a new name amen just like your father abraham the lord added a ham to his name the hand brings the blessing that is the beulah land and all the kings sorry this and and the lord shall call you by a new name which the mouth of the lord shall name when we are born our parents gives us name john david uh daniel and what have you but then the lord has a name for you that is the name of jesus christ that name may not be a physical name that is registered on your birth certificate but that name is inscribed and imprinted and embodied in in ink in your heart amen name is a deity name is a nature name is authority amen verse three thou shalt be thou shall be a crown of glory in the hand of the lord and eroya died them in the hand of god thou shalt no longer no more be termed forsaken neither shall thy land be tempt desolate but thou shall be called hefzeba and thy land beulah for the lord delight in thee and thy land shall be married for us a young man marries a virgin so shall thy sons marry thee as the bridegroom rejoice over the bride so shall thy god rejoice over thee amen god bless you shall we take our seed glory to the lord so we did break some of the terms here zion refers to the wife of christ the body of the lord on earth which the lord has redeemed peace of course pieces shalom the hebrew word hebrew word for peace is shalom peace of christ be unto you and then jerusalem is the jews plus the gentiles together the brethren of jesus christ and his wife together when a man redeems his family he redeems completely he redeems his family his wife his brothers and sisters mother father and then when he marries he redeemed a wife because they are one family amen so the lord had a portion of his family called the jews and a portion called the gentiles and they all the family of christ so the lord redeems the jews and the gentiles together and we want to break the word gentile gentile actually comes from the hebrew where the word from hebrew is or which means a nation a nation that needs to be redeemed so gentile is a nation that the lord is calling his people from we are nation we are not nation like united states we are not nation like you know another kingdom we are no nation like canada but we are a nation that descended from above we are from the new jerusalem that is our mother that descended from above amen now bella the templar means ownership means a master means lord married and claimed as a wife the heavenly zion so when the lord put a wedding ring which is the holy ghost in your heart you become a nation of the lord you've got a master the lord jesus christ himself who reigns in your life with love you are ownership you belong to someone you belong to me sir jesus christ you are married how did you marry by the holy ghost baptism that is the wedding ring the lord put in your heart that is put a new creation he destroyed the old creation of sin sin means satan in your nature god consumes that old creation and brings a new creation in your heart so that you become a new create a new creation amen now hefzeba means my delight is in her who is her zion beulah the land the lord has married to the wife of jesus christ so the light of the lord is in you amen when the lord created the lord brought three principal creation and we've experienced all the creation what the first creation was what we call the adamic creation that is from the garden of eden when the lord created uh the natural adam was initially a theophany a celestial body but then the lord wanted to manifest in earth he wanted to marry the land of beulah the earthly land so the theophany put on flesh by the spoken word adam put on the existing element the cosmic light potassium phosphorus sodium ion iodine and what have you all the 16 elements put together magnesium and so forth and so on so adam became a flesh amen adam became the garden of eden everything was perfect now but the lord had more attributes than being a father than being a god of being worshiped he wanted to become a healer he wanted to become a redeemer he wanted to become a savior but then in the adamic creation there was nothing to redeem because everything was perfect there was no sickness there was no dryness there was no desolation there was no case so the lord has to bring a contrast by letting a lucifer bring in the contrast so the lord created a lucifer for that contrast if you read the book of isaiah 45 verse 1 to 5 7 there where he said i'm the lord isaiah 45 verse 5 he said i form light i create evil i the lord do all these things amen there's nothing that will happen to you that the lord doesn't know about that the lord didn't permit yes job went through trials very difficult trials but the lord permitted those trials so that you bring the job to his next revelation to his next manifestation to a higher grounds amen so when you have you're a christian you're a child of god a son of god and you are going through trials it doesn't mean the devil is the one in control of your life no the devil doesn't control the life of a son of god you have got christ in your life is the pill of fire that is bringing you to a higher level amen so he allows the brokenness first so that you can create a new masterpiece in your lives glory hallelujah so whatever to happens to you is for a good cause it might not look at the present time but the lord has a purpose for it then we have what you call the birth through sex sex birth that is the creation that brought forth king and abel right good and bad knowledge of good and bad the tree of knowledge of good and bad we're not no we are not talking about a physical tree truly present a person amen jesus is a tree of life by the tree of good and bad this and that god is not about good he's about eternity amen satan doesn't do bad things only you know the satan has got good things too a lot of things that i mean that is very good you couldn't have traveled without satan's vehicle that is civilization came from the uh what fifth dimension yeah jet planes the instrument that we use is satan civilization and they are good we use them we use cell phones the element is god but then the creation sorry not the creation the perversion is what satan did amen and the lord use it for a good cause because the lord ordained satan for that purpose so don't blame satan don't blame the devil the lord is the one who allows the devil to do what he does so that the lord will glorify himself amen glory to god then the third creation is the creation of jesus christ that is the lugus that is by the spoken word which brings life eternal amen so we experience all of them we experience the first creation we experience the second creation the fall and the third creation eternity where the creator himself speak his life into you glory hallelujah by the new birth glory to the lord jesus christ also we broke certain ways let me take a cup of water we're just trying to go over what we did last week to take off from there we broke some of the uh hebrew west uh the words that we used last week jerusalem means gas city of peace that is the rest where the wife of christ plus the remnant of the jews now god is calling you or has already called you to abdullah land what is abuela land bula is the earthly land that you dwell in i'm not talking about the physical land in israel it's a type the natural types are spiritual your land your sistine element is the land of beulah when you have the holy ghost baptism you have been redeemed you are a son or a daughter of christ you are working on beulah land now before the holy ghost baptism you are living in desolation desolation means a desert a land of cases a despised place where nobody wants full of suffering and pain but then when the lord calls you he changes your heart how does it change your heart he doesn't do a physical surgery but he does a supernatural surgery he consumes the old person and then he comes to dwell on the inside the lord is a thought before even you were born again that thought was already in you amen the day you draw from your mother's womb you are you had something eternal about you regardless of how you were born regardless of your sins regardless of anything there's a portion of christ in you and that lord that we call it the mind of christ the seed of god is in you all the days of your life and throughout time and eternity but then there's an appointed time and season for everything else ecclesiastes solomon preached the preacher preached that there's a time to be born and a time to die a time to gather stones a time to disperse things so there's a time the lord take fucon through control that's the time he allows the enemy to rule your life he can push you through pervasion desolation and you become a forsaken land now there's a time the lord allows the word the word man the theophany the celestial being in you to quicken your your terrestrial body and then it brings you into a land a condition called beulah land amen so billa land is a land of blessing we also talk about a hebrew alphabet that the hebrew alphabets are not just alphabet like the english alphabet that we use but now the hebrew alphabet have got a crowns they've got diadem as we read from the scripture the lord the creator will die at them that is gold decoration it signifies it signifies deity authority and the power and redemption amen when you remember the story about the prodigal son when he went out on his own took his property and went out you know in sin and unbelief and in destruction he came back broken he ended up eating with pigs it's a type i don't think anybody would like to eat with pigs you want to eat with human beings because you're a human being by now the product prodigal son made their own decision and went all the way into into hades hedis means hell hell i'm not talking about a physical hold you thinking you can be on earth and be sinking in sin sinking in wretchedness thinking in brokenness sinking in unbelief but then when you go the furthest you can go the love of god you can oh i mean you can't go beyond the love of christ you can't go where the love of christ will not reach you the love of christ reached the polygam and brought him back home and he came back he knew his his i mean he did the wrong thing he said father i don't even deserve to be called your son i just want to be a servant i want to just get my daily bread but what did the father do he called the family to bring gold jewels to bring a a ring and put it upon his son because he's always a son regardless of his fallen estate so even when mankind fell we didn't fall away from the sonship of god we fell away from our position as a son but we are so sons and daughters of god amen the glory of the lord was there so the letter uh alif which is the jewish letter for e that letter signifies the omnipotency of of elohim lord himself the great creator he's the source of life and every existence thereof satan is not a creator no the lord is the one who created jesus christ is the creator of heaven and the earth he create his another meaning of alif means someone who can create something or world out of nothing and i want you to uh we're going to lay some emphasis on that hold on to this one the one who can create something or world different world and i'm not talking about this cosmic world i'm talking about a condition what condition do you want in your life at this time you can create your own desire amen if you have elohim so he can create something out of nothing he can create great things out of emptiness because that is his attribute now when you come to the letter b the hebrew letter b is not uh is quite different from our letters that our english letter the letter b is called beth b e i-t-h or b-e-t beth means a house a tent a tabernacle god multiplying himself because the lord elohim didn't want to remain elohim and in the theophany forever he wanted to have an earthly manifestation so begin to he push adam on earth adam came to earth and then cain and abel and noah and all of them begin to multiply so the lord wants to multiply himself eternity is a multiplication he can divide himself and he'll still be one amen there's only one eternal life it doesn't matter how many billions and trillions and gazillions of sons and daughters of god they only have one life eternal life the life of jesus christ amen so now the letter b represent the creator and the creation because the creator wants to occupy his peace he wants to bring himself into creation he wants to manifest himself into nothingness so he spoke his word and the word is life amen it doesn't matter he didn't live in time he was a timeless speechless being he was a self-existent and so he spoke just by thought he progressed his thoughts and the thought moved and created earth created florida brought a beautiful palm trees in florida brought lakes and rivers and alligators and different beautiful creations in florida he spoke into into um into all the world you can think about all the forests and the beautiful things the sky the moon the planet by creation by the spoken word and the same creative power is in you amen the same spirit is in you amen you might not need the land of uh florida you might not need mercury as a planet to live in you might not need a jupiter as a planet to live on but you might need something in your life right now amen and it doesn't matter what you need it doesn't matter the weight it doesn't matter how it looks unreachable to your human self there's something in you beyond this human flesh and that is why the word said the lord said to moses why cry speak the word amen speak your land into creation manifest from your heart into creation because you are not just a human being you are a daughter and a son of god and you are christ jesus in manifestation amen glory hallelujah to the lord so that is the lord bringing bringing manifestation remember the bible said that adam was created was made a god on earth how was other made god on earth the ethnic creation that we see the lord used adam to bring it into manifestation because he wants his son to manifest that deity in him like when you see animals when they train their young ones take for example an ego the iglesias are born as little bitty things they don't know what to do they don't even know about flying when they are born they don't even have feathers every time they grow feathers they don't know the use of the feathers they come a point where the the the the ego their mother ego has to train them so what it does is they are living in a comfortable nest and the ego has got a sharp velocity very forceful spirit in him it's one of the most powerful heavenly uh creation that is the ego so the ego goes away far away from from from uh from the nest and it comes with a very terrific speed and hit the nest boom and now the nest is scattered now the eggless they are sometimes the nest could be on a rock could be on a tree so now here's the eagles falling down they've never flown before they don't understand the concept of flying but now a storm pushes them away from the comfort zone and now they begin to stretch out their hands because they have to they have to i mean hold on to something the next is broken they can't hold on to the nest so now that forces them to stretch their their wings [Music] by flopping their wings okay wow i've never seen it before it's a miracle i never know i could fly so now they're forcing them it's already in them but they didn't know so through their mothers destroying destroying the nest now they are pushed to bring an attribute that they have never experienced on this earth it's been in them through time and eternity but there's a time that attribute has been manifested that's what happens when the lord brings trials in our lives yes the trusts are not pleasant i'm not saying trust a pleasure and nobody called for trials nobody pray lord give me one more trial no wonder you pray lord deliver me from temptation i don't want to go into that trials but sometimes the lord give us trial to bring us bring the attribute out of us because we are him and he is us glory hallelujah so these eaglets begin to now push out their wings and flop them and begin to fly and the mother is there to guide them and direct them pick them when they are falling down and then push them again fly so now they get begin to get comfortable okay flop their wings and fly but i said time he has to give them another training push them to the second pool amen what does he do he has to now train them how to how to face a clouds they could be flying just on the surface of the earth but now there's going to fly in the clouds so no matter what when thick clouds just like if you have flown in jet plane before you know what is meant by cloud when they say storm storm is the third pool but let me use just clouds so the clouds has got the speed but not as bad as the storm so their mother pushed them to to go into the clouds and then because they are they are created to be a heavenly creation they've got eyes that can see can see more than any other uh heavenly heavenly creatures they can see beyond human being so now when the mother pushed them to flow through the clouds and the class has got velocity you get they get jake and they get pushed around but then they make it and they realize that wow i never seen this before glorious i never saw the earth is so beautiful they could see the trees the mountains they could see rivers they can't they can i mean spot the fish in the sea the further the eagle goes the higher it goes the more it can see it doesn't make sense how can you see when you are further away if i can see this uh this uh riding on the wall but the hour has come and now john 4 23 in new zealand read it anyways the hour but the hour has come sorry but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father second search to worship him john 4 23 if i go i will begin to go away maybe out of that building i'll get to a point i can't read it i get to say if i can't see it again but the ego the further away he goes from the writing the better he can even see it's the things of god doesn't make sense it's not by reasoning it's by revelation amen if you reason around it it's not going to make sense how can i see something better when i'm further away from it that is the ego spirit amen when the storm gets stronger when the trust gets tougher that is when great miracles happen in your life glory hallelujah because you are an eglet you are an ego amen so they go through their training in the clouds then the third pool is when they say stone the mother went to there's a hurricane there's a storm somewhere it's okay now we are going to you guys have passed the first pool you've done the second pool now we have to go to the third pool where you guys are going to face storm greet torrential storms you are going to face the east winds the trials of the world you are going to face uh disasters catastrophes sickness whatever failure but there's something in you to overcome and conquer all those afflictions so the mother to them when there's a storm you take them through the storm and the storm can sweep them and kill them but there's something in an ego that he can stretch out his wings at a certain direction and he can let the storm take him where he want to go the storm would that that storm will kill any other heavenly bed it will kill a buzzard it will kill a a crow it will kill every other creek heavenly bed beside the eagle because the eagle was ordained and made for that amen there's a trial you go through that when someone goes through that person will not survive but the lord trusts you and he permitted that trial in your life amen the lord knew that you can overcome and bring the attribute out of your life so you permit those trials to bring you to where you are amen there's a proverb in a a ghanaian proverb that there's a a trial that hits a cat and the cat will still be staring and looking and be cheerful when they try to hit a dog everybody will hear that oh dog is going through the don't be backing all over whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa everybody will know that the dog is having a trial but when they say when the same try hit the cat the cat will be just looking at the trial there's nothing to me i don't care i'm overcomer amen so a trial that will cause somebody to flop or somebody to backslide it to move you further closer to christ because you're a son and a daughter of god amen a trial that will push someone away from the word it will push you more closer to the lord because you are you are christ in manifestation jesus had tries to amen when he was born they have to even take him away and hide him in egypt because not pharaoh herald wanted to kill him he went through trials but then the trials brought the attribute he was a king when he was born he was worshiped as a king but he couldn't manifest as a king as in a childhood when he grew up at age of 30 he began to preach his gospel his gospel was so weird he was a weird nobody wanted that gospel someone who could say that i can break i can destroy destroy the air i can destroy the temple of solomon in three days and and raise it in three days no no way this temple was born in it was built 40 years how can you do such a thing his gospel said that i am the son of god that live on earth and in heaven how can you live in two dimensions so they say no we got to kill this guy he said demon but is the son of the living god is god himself the almighty god in flesh amen and so are you amen you are jesus christ of this day you are christ in flesh because when the lord finishes a ministry at the age of 30 33 or 33 and a half he said i'll go but i'll never leave you comfortless i'll be with you even in you and you shall do more works greater work shall you do greater manifestation are you going to bring out amen glory hallelujah to the lord so birth we've gone far away from it beth is how the lord build a tent where tanaba tabernacle and i want to go to a little quote here we read from um frisbee to god i want to read tabanac we are talking about beulah the land of blessing i want us to read uh if brother simba can help me christ is revealed in his own way 65-0822 m65 i don't remember exactly how the paragraph but then it starts with 6 5-0 8 22 m christ is revealed in his own word he said that is the way moses was he was so in the spirit passed out of the dimension that he was living in and threw their face to face in that burning bush talking to god himself or we can say elohim himself take off your shoes the ground you are standing is holy ground i imagine when moses left there he thought what happened what taking place what was it moses has to come face to face with god he had to come face to face with god before you can inherit the land of beulah you have to come face to face with the king of beulah amen you might enjoy trekkos or the blessings from beulah through somebody who is living in villa land but when you yourself want to dwell in the land of beulah you have to come face to face with the king of billah the lord jesus christ you have to come to a land of holiness a land of purity a land of righteousness a land of celestial dimension amen moses had an attribute in him he was born a promise a promised son he was a type of christ he was moses mistaken out of water he was he had all the blessing his mother taught him his his big sister miriam taught taught him about his promise he knew that he was a jew he knew that he was going to be a savior but he hadn't come face to face with the lord so moses tried to deliver on his own and he landed him in big trouble he ended up being a runaway moses but the lord had everything perfectly set up for moses in his runaway condition he met his wife that was odin for him so he settled for his wife and just keep the ship of his father in law there was greater things for him to do so moses was working in his own intellectual mind in this dimension he was a prophet he saw vision the day he was born the pill of fire was there came to the room that he was born in but he hasn't come face to face with the lord so there was a time that the lord appeared unto moses in a burning bush and remember moses was a scientist he was a doctor he was a military general he was a lawyer he was he has all the specialties combined in him so he was somebody was intellectual age of 40. he knew that medicine way beyond the medicine that we have he knew that the physics and way beyond the effects that we have he knew the astronomers way beyond he could read the zodiac he had all the blessings he had all the gift in him but at the same time he had not come face to face with the almighty god amen spanish business with the lord that's where all of us have to come face to face with the lord jesus christ and that is where it's going to change your dimension it's going to change your land onto a holy land a land flowing with milk and honey i've got so many scriptures but i'll leave them for now so the moses saw a bush burning and in his intellectual mind he was trying to reason how how come okay if the bushes maybe somebody set a fire but it's not it's not being consumed what is this he begin to reason and a voice came from the bush from an abundant fire say moses the land that you are dwelling on is a holy land remove your shoe amen the natura is a type of the spiritual things the natural shoe is not just the sanders he was wearing but move from the terrestrial thinking and move to the celestia move to the celestial dimension move from from the second dimension thought as a human being you are limited by your element the earth that you weigh the space around you the time that you are living in things that you could see around your job your grand vision and and your family your riches you want to make riches you want to get your car gay or the best house you can build or you can buy get a company get get money that is what a human being can go as far as human is concerned but there's a greater vision and a greater purpose and a greater reason for the lord putting you here and when the time comes the lord take those things that we do things are good you can keep them as a human being but then they say something way beyond uh riches and money and houses and and and those natural things that is where the lord wants you to change dimension move from the second dimension onto the celestial dimension so the law told moses moses take away the cup that you're wearing take away your earthly mind put on the thinking cup of jesus christ put on the mind of elohim put on the mind of jehovah that is the only way you can understand why the bush is burning and it's not being consumed amen when you think you reason you're gonna find you're gonna think like what am i going through am i a christian and i go to trials why am i christian and i go through problems my family is going to do problems why am i a christian i'm going through maybe financial problem i'm sick maybe somebody passed away in my family but the lord has got something way beyond your your reasoning and thinking it's got the mind of christ he turned himself to manifest in you amen glory hallelujah to the lord and the land of biula is a land flowing with milk and honey glory hallelujah to the lord i want to read i'm still on the the second alphabet that is beulah i want to read a quote from fellowship by redemption 55-0403-550403 fellowship by redemption and it's going to be a little longer a little long reading let's start from uh paragraph 9 98. the prophet was talking about a house in salon the letter b house tent tabernacle and the prophet progressed in their revelation there was a time the lord gave me a revelation preacher sometimes don't drop revelation as long as soon as the lord give them they pray over it they ponder over it and they even think how other people receive it and when the lord is time for the lord the lord give them the the leeway to give the revelation the lord give them the anointing then they bring that anointing he said i've never believed that heaven was a place where there's a bunch of buildings where there's a bunch of houses up there made with water dabbed with paper paint paint on the wall i've never believed that a supernatural being will have to live in a little house in other words literal house means an ugly house we are physical beings we are second dimensional beans we are time beings so we need to live in houses we need to have a roof on top of us we need to have clothes shoes cars and what our view but then the supernatural theophany doesn't need to live in this house no he doesn't need to have decorations no they've got a different house and that's what the prophet is talking about is he said john the lord said in john 14 in my father's house is many mansion he meant a body a dwelling place for the scripture very verified the same thing and said if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting you see mortar beans is the only one who lives in a mortar habitation human beings live in this mortal flesh then the place that we go into until we return back is not a place of brick and mortar no thank you brothers and a clay or preciousness or jewels it is a place of condition and i want you to know the word condition the place that celestia place it's not like a house that we are in we've got seats and chairs and bed and pillows and dining tables no that is not the type of house we go into that's not the type the lord created but then we go into a condition so let's look at the condition he's talking about we're going to a condition that we move out of this dimension that we live into into another dimension it's a house a tabernacle a dwelling place said i got a revelation the other d paragraph 103 i'm just jumping up and down the paragraph so 103. i got a revelation the other day standing up there on mount paloma at the observatory and seeing the time the space over to mars and to the last continent and so forth and light traveling at so many thousands miles per second 104. if an angel started from the father's star coming here it will take it will take it billions times billions 10 billions of years to get here if you started from mass and come here flying at a speed of light of light space or light speed it will take him billions of years to get here is that if an angel lives on mass and that angel wants to travel like the way human being travel but it's not traveling by jet flight is traveled by astronauts and they can go the speed of light now still going to take that angel billions of billions of billions of years you can imagine billions of years to get to earth is so way far beyond our human what your human consumption can grasp is that i cannot believe that there's a house way out yonder but i believe that the house that god was speaking of is right present here now and i want us to take note the house the lord is talking about the condition he said when we go to the other side we live in a house but not this house it's a condition it's a dimension and it's right here now it's not in the future it's not in the past it's right here now that is the place where the mortar beans when we cease to be mortar we step into immortal immortality yonder into a place and i believe that where jesus is today the resurrected lord jesus not out yonder somewhere a million miles away but right here paragraph 106 but right here present with us now the resurrected jesus christ hasn't gone into mass or mercury jupiter venus or another planet somewhere but it's right here in a celestial dimension all right let's go we said 107. in the fourth dimension people can prove right through people can prove that right through this room is coming radioactivity we are using instrument i'm speaking through a microphone i'm far away from maybe people in in their homes in west palm beach some in different states but yes they can hear me they can see my picture is the power is the dimension of their forth that is their tv width tv waves radio waves gamma waves the scientific dimension our body cannot detect it we are not made to detect those dimensions we cannot detect electronics we can see them in images when they become victoria but we cannot detect those dimensions they belong to their fourth dimension glory hallelujah to the lord so coming through this building is now coming television pictures but it's too fast for our eyes by graph 10108 now you go millions of miles beyond that dimension and you get into a place just as real as television pictures is in this room this morning there is the lord jesus christ the resurrected son of god standing here and the reason that you can't see him is because our heart hasn't become tuned down to it and i want us to note that word our heart hasn't become tuned down to it if you can go to the lamppost here if you can go to a and the old time when they used to use radio right this is everything is internet so you can use you can listen to radio on internet but i'm talking about the old-fashioned radio where you have to tune in to free use frequencies you have to tune into maybe a certain frequency 107. maybe you want to listen to a certain radio a christian radio broadcast from let's say miami but then when you are driving you go to a place you don't hear because it's out of tune but then when you get to that frequency and your reduced frequencies go the radio has got magnets and crystal and when that frequency line up with the frequency incoming frequency you can hear everything crystal clear that is the dimension that is the dimension which is the what the fourth dimension all right and now the prophet is saying that the reason why we don't see jesus christ we put him far away from us it's because we have no tuning to him we are still being troubled by the things of the world we are so battling the world so we don't have the mind of christ to tune into that dimension but then we have the mind of if we empty ourselves if we like moses moses was stripped from all his scientific knowledge all his medicine all his military powers and then he had to come face to face with the lord jesus christ that is when the lord transformed moses to make him a god amen the lord said that moses i'm going to make you he said i can't speak he said no i make the mouth of a person i am the one who put the voice in you so you go and you mostly your brother will be your prophet i'm not going to make you a prophet you're already a prophet you are born a prophet but i'm going to make you a god i'm going to make you god because you are going to create things amen and what did moses do did what did he do he come face to face with uh the red sea there was no way in between the red sea he's got two million people on his hands that he needed to deliver pharaoh and the army with the military with horses and and if it's modern time with ak-47 with bullets with a atomic powers with nuclear weapons and moses had only a piece of stick in his hand how is he going to fight the military might of egypt with a stick in his hands moses now became a creator in that moment the guard in him came out amen moses spoke resc open and they see open left and right fitha and heather and moses and the people of god went through it amen now the lord has put the same attributes in you by the holy ghost baptism when you come face to face with your condition which is adversity what do you do christ in you the expression of glory christ in you the hope of glory speak the word in your heart if you don't have the word in your heart you can speak the word of a man nothing is going to happen but when you've got the holy ghost in your heart when you speak the holy ghost in you christ in you will manifest his glory amen now so he said the reason why many people cannot see christ is because they are not tuning onto him let me read a little more further glory to the lord okay let me read from i think i go to where he said there's the lord jesus christ the resurrected son of god standing here and the reason that you can't see him is because our heart hasn't become tuned down to it and the reason we can't see the television picture we are our bodies are not set as instrument to pick up mechanical things 109 but when our body becomes in tune with god in other words in tune with our creator become a part of him then our soul can pick up the power of the holy spirit to vindicate the presence of the lord jesus christ in all of his power and omnipotence this is so powerful when our body become in tune with the lord himself then we can pick up all the power in the selection the power that we threw in mercury the power that we threw in heaven somewhere the power that we put in the future the power that we put back away in the time of moses the power that we put on willie abraham the power that we put on isaiah the power that we put on hannah and so i'm nothing i remember hannah was able to speak cried out and he had a son when she was 17 years old when she has gone through menopause but i cannot do it but when you get in tune when the lord tunes you to himself then you can speak like hannah you can cry out like esther you can go to the king and instead of being killed get redemption for your people amen glory hallelujah he said then become part of him i will so come pick up the power of the holy spirit to vindicate the presence of the lord jesus christ in all his power and omnipotence he has risen from the dead he lives among us today and he wants fellowship back with him back with his people again his great majesty his glory is now spreading forth and his desiring to fellowship again with his people like he did in the garden of eden amen the lord is desiring to fellowship with you there's one thing between worshiping and fellowshipping when you're dealing with worship you are talking about a higher power and a lower power you worship a king you worship people worship president people worship flags people worship vehicles people worship other human beings because they deem those people higher than them so they worship them but now the lord wants fellowship what is the meaning of the word fellowship two fellows in one word sheep the lord wants to be on the same boat with you he doesn't want to be somewhere way high and you are way down here oh lord this is me i'm poor i'm broken lord help me give me one one one one what one dollar give me my lunch oh lord give me pay my rent for me oh lord please change my condition tend my home tell my children tell my parents lord turn my wife around turn my husband around he want to be fellowship with you what is fellowship two fellas in one shape worship are you talking about your flesh is the shape of zion amen you live in this flesh as a human being and the holy ghost lives in this place as a human being and instead of crying out instead of i mean moaning around instead of getting worried about situation remember that there are two fellows on the same ship you are not alone the lord jesus christ is in your ship and when the ship is sinking what do you do call on the lord speak as a lord just as a peter when the sheep was sinking peter remembered that this tomb is going to kill us so he woke the lord from there says lord don't you care and the lord spoke that spoke into creation support that went out of creation brought peace into creation amen but there was a time the lord wasn't with with moses sorry it wasn't with peter as he was with them on the ship the lord said i'm going to die i'll leave you but i'll be in you unto the end of the world there's a ministry has to continue i'm not done with it i've just scratched the surface for you you guys are going to continue and other people are going to continue so there was a time when uh peter got in tune with the lord at the day of pentacles that's when the tuning came in you don't get tuned until you receive the baptism of the holy ghost that's when you get the frequency of the supernatural so there was a time that people were sick there were sick people they saw that no peter peter is tuned with the lord this wasn't the same person who was casting around and cutting people's ears and fighting and battling with his now there's something in him he's like the lord jesus christ so what did they do they lay sick people on the streets this is not jesus christ this is peter delays people that are sick people with leprosy people work with cancer people with whatever sickness you can name it they lay them on the road coronavirus cancer everything they lead them on the streets and then when peter is passing by they say prayer adventure by chance there's a probability that he'll pass on a 17th street he'll pass on a half a hill street he'll pass on 45th street and his shadow will pass on this people and they will get well what happened and it happened people get got well by the shadow of peter was it a shadow of peter no it was a theophany it was a christ himself because he promised that i'm going but i'll be back i'll come and reign in your heart because he's a king of sins it's not a king of white house the lord jesus christ is here reigning in your flesh by the baptism and when you tune in with a word when you tune in with your message your day and your message the word becomes ye and amen the word becomes life it becomes quicken to you and when you speak you don't speak as brother troy you don't speak as brother who you don't speak a sister rebecca you don't speak assistant tina you don't speak us brother jerry or a brother quentin or brother simba but you speak as jesus christ speaking and your word is ye and amen glory hallelujah that is the land of villa that is where the lord is bringing us to that's the way the lord wants us to be he doesn't want us to be on the desert anymore no we finish with a desert life he wants to bring you to a land where our bodies are in tune with him glory be to the lord now let's look at the another alphabet i won't hold you too long glory hallelujah let's read one scripture here let's read ephesians chapter 3 verse 14 to 15 efficiency efficient 3 14 to 17 rather or 18 sorry let me read from 14 to 18 ephesians 3 14 to 18. for this course i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ this is paul speaking verse 15 is my my point of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named the whole family in heaven and earth is named that he will grant you according to the religious of his glory to be strengthened with the might by his spirit in the inner man that christ may dwell in your heart by faith that you being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all sins what is the breath and length and death and height of christ so now we put god in measurement now verse 15 said that of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named we've got a last name our last name is what jesus christ our last name is eternity our last name is heaven our last name is celestia dimension our last name is uh the great eterna el ella elohim so that name name is what name is a deity name is not just something right on paper and spell it on paper or you put on document there's a life in a name there's a spirit in a name so the whole heaven the power in uh in uh the the the angels in heaven that power comes from the lord jesus christ the sins on earth that power come from the lord jesus christ the life in heaven in the celestial dimension the saint in the theophany and the saints here on earth they have the same name that is the name of jesus christ in other words they have the same spirit the holy spirit amen because christ dwells in our hearts the inner man amen so the christ dwelling in you is the spirit of christ it's a name that is above all names it's a name that is above every condition on the earth it's a name that is above poverty above sickness above sin above a suffering above pain that when you have that name on you that name brings you to a land of promise a land of blessing that is abuela land glory be to the lord you want to look at um let go to the third alphabet glory to the lord the third alphabet in hebrew is called gimel gimel is the third alphabet in the hebrew now gimel brings harmonizes the two alphabet that is christ the singleness of god omnipotence and god manifesting himself so gimel can be seen as the holy spirit baptism there's this great almighty god and there's his sons and subjects on earth now for him to unite his people he united them by the word by the holy spirit baptism amen without the holy spirit baptism you are limited to the senses of the flesh you've got uh five senses in our flesh we can hear feel this smell and touch that sense is earthly senses we've got five senses of the spirit we've got a memory affection reasoning imagination and conscience that is your spirit the senses or outlets of the human spirit but then we've got the eleventh sense or the sixth sense that is a sense of faith that leads you to the supernatural dimension amen that is what the third letter does for you bring you to a dimension that you can manifest as the omnipotent christ glory be to god blessed be the name of the lord so that letter bridges the simple man who is falling from greece onto his maker not only that to manifest the attribute of his maker in him now the fourth letter is called dalith that is in hebrew in greek is the letter delta d in english english we call it d now the letter d represents weakness it represents need a needy person a broken mankind who is nothing without his creator you cannot do nothing of yourself without the father being with you even jesus when he was on health he said the sun the flesh his human spirit cannot do nothing until the holy pill of fire in him does it so he said the sun does not do nothing of himself but whatsoever the father doeth likewise the sandwith amen what the father shows you in your heart the holy ghost shows in your heart that is what you manifest in your flesh so if the father has ordained you to speak into creation if the father has ordained you to speak things out of creation nothing can change that because that is what the la the lord the holy ghost in you is bringing out out of your life amen now we want to look at the fifth letter the letter is wonderful the fifth letter is called hey it's like h h-e-y or it's also spelled h-e-i-o-h-e-l it's later means hey look or behold and that is the god creative power now that letter is the outpouring of the holy spirit and now without that letter you dwell in land of desolation and that letter feminizes you like abraham abraham and sarah were dwelling in the land of the land of desolation they were barren mana when the letter when the lord added hey to abraham's name abraham became he was abraham sorry he used to be abram without he without harm without christ in his life he was seen visions but the lord hasn't added his deity upon abraham so ibrahim was barren he couldn't have a child his wife was barren he was sterile his wife was barren however you put it but now the lord made an announcement it's abraham i'm going to feminize you i'm going to make you fruitful so the letter h which is the fifth letter of the hebrew feminizes you what is the feminine the feminine brings life amen without the feminine the man cannot bring life without his wife the man cannot bring life and without you without the land of beulah jesus christ cannot bring life upon the earth amen so he add his name hey the faith letter which is harm unto you so that you become what fruitful who prune you to bring bring more fruits amen then you become the land of bula land or blessing by adding the letter each or harm to your name like sarah like abram abraham couldn't manifest nothing of the promised son there was something in him that he was he has a promised son and here he was 100 years old his wife 90 years old way beyond menopause no there was no hope there was there was a time abraham lawson he said lord my servant i was born in my house is going to be my uh my head when i die it's going to inherit me and the lord said no you your servant your son that will come from your loins is going to be your inheritance is going to inherit you but there was nothing to prove the lord wanted abraham to know that hey abraham you are my son you can speak out of nothingness you can speak conditions that are way adverse you can speak conditions that are impossible to man because i am in you and so when the lord makisadek came on the scene and added his name unto abraham abraham abraham become abraham abram hey behold the beauty of abraham abraham has become the beautiful land with a son isaac glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be the name of the lord jesus christ so now the crown the lord has given to you is the word is the life the lord didn't give you a sword to fight he didn't give a physical crown like the queen of england or like in africa kings were gold and diamonds he didn't give you a presidential palace like the white house or russia or birmingham palace in england but it's giving you more than white house it's giving you a tent it's giving you a house a beth that is the builder land the land where blessings are flowing that is the holy ghost land and what do you do with the land you get in tune as we read from the prophet redemption uh by presentation he said get in tune the reason why we don't bring those attributes because we are not in tune with the lord we are way out of tune we are out of work so we can manifest it but then when we get out so we we tune ourselves the holy ghost tune yourself into that dimension and everything becomes possible things just flow normally just like a human being you eat and you build your body you eat and you build your strength you eat and you build your body so the word is given to you to eat and build your body to tune yourself into your creator amen if anybody's listening is out of tune with the lord if you don't know where you are if you think your life is just about walk upon the earth make money live a life of riches or a life that you want so called and when you die you go away that is not what the lord made you for the lord made you for a heavenly dimensional purposes to be in tune with him to line your heart to him so that he will come and dwell in this heart deceit in you will be quickened and take over your flesh so that you'll be in tune with the celestial dimension that when you speak it's not the word of a woman it's not a word of a man but it's the omnipotent speaking into creation and whatever you need why cry why are you dismayed why are you troubled why are you wavering why is your face shaking because of sudden condition remember last was it a couple of weeks weeks ago the lord allowed the torment he was training the disciples so he let satan raise atonement and the torment was something that was going to drown them and kill all of them peter was shaken because he wasn't in tune and so he woke the lord up lord and the lord said why do you why are you crying say ye of little faith speak and move forward he spoke as a demonstration to them because the same thing is what they were going to do greater works and the lord asks you here for you to do a greater work it's not only one person it's not a one-man ministry it's not only for ministers it's only for the pastor it's not only for the deacons it's not only for trustees but it's for everyone every member of the body of christ everyone who is in tune with the lord everyone who has got harm he on his name you become a beater you become a beth that is a house that the lord dwells in a house which is their promised land which is the land of blessing which is a villa land full of flowers roses lilies and everything else amen the water lily when the water lady has to go through those uh what they call it those air soil and come up with a beauty it's not it's not a punishment but those distressing times bring the beauty out of the water lily and when the water lily emerges it's the most beautiful flower along the stream along the river the same thing what you are going through now is not the punishment of the lord unto you it's not because you have sin but because the lord is bringing a beauty out of you is moving you into another dimension you want you to see things beyond what you've seen already you want it to come a point where you don't even have to pray there should be a condition that you just by your heart and your imagination as you imagine let it be so let this person be healed in your heart it breaks in your heart you don't even have to pray for him but your heart goes because there's something in you that direct to brother troy that directed sister rebecca and when you direct that to him it brings whatever they need into creation amen because we travel by what by thought we don't travel by reasoning but the thought is the man of christ eternity manifesting in you amen you can create whatever you desire in your life i don't care what you are going through satina whatever you need at this hour whatever you are praying for whatever you call upon the lord for is for you nothing can take it from you and you speak it and stand as a daughter of god like military well military people they don't military people don't even smile when they are in what war front they are just standing there like military i'm ready to fight because they are dead to defeat the enemy when they defeat the enemy then after they come and have party the same thing when you stand as the daughter of christ as a son of god let everything in you all the faith in you comes out that's what the lord the lord allows adversity so that what is in you will come out amen like samson here he was he didn't have an eye remember he had seven locks that was what the lord gave it to him for his protection whenever he comes into problem he he can just fill the seven locks woven by his mom or bias by his sisters and he can rush in the anointing of the lord would be upon him to destroy the enemies here was samson no seven locks saving changes are gone the eyes of the prophet were gone but the intelligence itself was a manifestation so samson has to come to has to be in tune and begin to get in tune and the head began to grow it wasn't woven into seven lost no more no it grew as one a leaf the oneness of christ and samson spoke he said lord i want a little revenge here i want to destroy my enemies before i leave this dimension and the bible said moses destroyed more enemies than he did in all his lifetime regardless of your condition regardless of what you are going through regardless of your challenges there's more for you to manifest than what you have already manifested the lord has more for the church than what we have seen already the lord has not despised us no the lord is bringing us into another dimension remember when a jet plane is london i was going through the clouds there's turbulence and begin to shake and people get scared what's going on but then they go over the clouds it's just like sitting here you eat your lunch go to the restroom walk around until you get to your destination the same thing the lord is bringing us to another face of the ministry and the lord allowed things to happen here and there it doesn't mean the lord has the lord never forsake his people he's still leading them amen the people of fire that spoke into creation that gave their promises here that give tongues the symbol of fire is in each and every one of the sons of the lord is now a precious pastor by the jack it's in every one of you and whatever you desire why cry why remember why get complain but speak why gossip but speak the word in prayer whatever way you want to speak it if you want to go on your knees do it if you want to create in your heart do it if you bring it as a thought do it because eternity himself is living in you but acquaintance a tendency is living in every one of sons of god and when you speak you understand you stand as omnipotent standing every son and every daughter of god is omnipotent amen the attribute of your father is in you don't let the physical condition dismay you no it's there for you to bring what is in you out amen here was jesus people were coming to arrest him it wasn't time for him for him yet what could he do he just by the way he spoke he vanished and he appeared where he's supposed to appear that power is in you you are the rapture don't put away god away from you the problem we do is we we put the lord as we read the prophet said we look at him as he's in mass somewhere like mass way billions and trillions of lives peace and i'm way here poor me here on earth poco portina portroy no it's not that way the same god is that if you can tune the lord help us to tune our supernatural eyes see the lord jesus christ in brother quentin it doesn't he doesn't have to be a giant no the lord jesus christ is my sisters and my brothers and when they speak is heaven speaking when they speak creation manifests and the lord is moving us politically socially economically the world move the lord is moving us to that direction where we're going to speak into creation the third point is not in the future don't wait to oh i can't wait to the third period manifest the third pool has always been here since creation how did adam come into manifestation by the third pool the lord didn't take a claim begin to weave no adam was in the celestial dimension and as there was time there was a time and moment adam has to come on earth the earth gathered around him he didn't have to have a mother like you and i he just came as a man around 30 years old and adam began to walk the lord wanted to taste the waters few funny doesn't taste waters so the holy spirit in him with a body with a human spirit a piece of him in the human spirit a piece of him in the flesh because the lord was bringing shadows getting closer to the earth and now adam comes scoop the waters and drink it and said it's beautiful it's delicious it is good what is the waters it's life when the holy ghost comes into you the lord tastes you this is my son this is my daughter she is me when you speak it's me speaking when she speaks demons bow to her when she orders she's the queen of heaven who rules in earth the earthly uh a clay doesn't define you what is on the inside is what defines you it doesn't matter how much i get sick yes we get sick yes we can have challenges yes we can cry yes we can fall and rise it doesn't matter when you fall the ground is not for you get up and if you can't get up call a sister to pick you up call her brother to pick you up amen don't lay on the ground oh i've fallen i'm going to lay here and die no the ground is not for you you've got food to walk so this is not where i'm supposed to be i need to get up i'm trying to get her but i can i can cover that troy i can call my sister rebecca i can cause his attitude i can call for that simba to help me i can cover the jerry i can copy the jack so whatever you go through god has you has helped for you amen amen the same christ in you is in your brothers and sisters and when they speak or you speak is christ speaking it but that troy priests for me is god speaking to me ibrahim prays for me god speaking to me if sister wrecker pray for me god speaking to me everybody prays for me god speaking to me if the little ones pray for me god speak praying speaking to me amen because the deity in them speaking into creation and it's it's time now is the time of tuning into that sixth celestial dimension is the time of tuning don't get so accustomed to the second first third fourth and the fifth dimension let's move over to the sixth and seventh dimension let's move up over to the promised land let's move over to tubular land where there's milk and honey where you can you can drink all you want when you've got good fat meat and and and vegetables and whatever you want is there in abundance amen where you can walk and speak where your thought can bring healing onto people where your imagination can bring creation where there's peace all around you amen because that attribute is in you and i you are a son of god you're a daughter of god you are a villa land you are the very very purpose and the motive of jesus christ take it enough you are the motive of jesus christ a man's wife is purpose and motive in earth because without his wife he cannot bring forth himself so without you jesus christ will not be seen so but i'm broken i'm just a broken mess there's nothing good about me without you jesus christ can be manifested your brokenness is for him to manifest remember the letter d delta dalit in hebrew is weakly can do nothing he's not married he said bachelor is a single but when the man the lord jesus christ the king of heaven step on that land he said this is my daughter this is sister tina my daughter this is rebecca my daughter this but i trod my son and he stepped in your earth what have you become you have become the manifestation the motive that elohim had way before time will be for billions and trillions of years you are his motive today you are his manifestation and when you are walking i know that i am the motive of jesus christ what contained the man of god what demon cancer if the lord want to put this little tambourine here no i won't allow it no you are not fighting your battle there's somebody way beyond you way beyond your physical conditions way beyond your problems and you have to transfer your problems to him that is what david did david give a testimony before goliath he has to give a testimony he went through the first pool he said i killed a bird okay second pool i kill a lion so when he came before goliath now he wasn't talking about he didn't give out testimony to goliath but it transferred the battle to his deity because goliath was cursing him uh through his idols the demons because god had a deity he was demons in him but now david has the lord of hosts elohim the name of jesus christ written in his heart and so david little david was just about maybe 18 years old he was looking at goliath he was charging himself he was tuning himself he said i'm going to kill you and give your body to the best of heaven and go let doesn't say the same as you you little young man you want to come and fight me you are joking you want to you want to risk your life on earth i'm going to murder you begin to case him in the gospel of philistines and the gospel of demons of akron so the battle was changed from flesh into the celestial spiritual battle and the pillar of fire just moved david to pick five smooth stones j-e-s-u-s-u-s f-a-i-t faith jesus grace grace and all another attribute and begin to hold them tuning himself tuning his slingshot and he threw the first one straight hit goliath on the head it was it wasn't david david was just an instrument it was a six dimension become bit you become one with god so you've got two and one you are not alone the lord is in you and when you can tune yourself switch yourself yes you can act as a human being as a human you can sleep go to work do whatever you do as a human being but always get in tune with the other man in you that when the situation arise you just jump aside transfer to him and let him take over let him anoint your flesh let me announce your brother let me know your pastor your word let one not your sisters and your brothers and you see heavens who reign in your life god bless you we are not defeated people we are eternal people a man you are being you are christ and it's high time we let christ manifest by tuning to that celestial dimension let the natural spiritual as we tune radios we tune computers we give frequencies to bring certain things that we desire let's tune into him more go into the inner man don't let the noise of the world political anoints ecclesiastical noise religious noise by tuning to christ tune into the ministry the lord has given to you come to church hear the word pray read your word read the message because that's the way to tune into him let him say one thing i'm close if you want to tune into god let me give you one key take one day right probably we all have something to do all of us work school whatever appearance parenting different things get a one day that you don't have to go to work maybe saturday and lock yourself you can in your room it doesn't work for you if you can go to the us go but if you can lock yourself in a room turn your cell phone off it's not the day you go to work it's not the day you talk to friends turn your cell phone off put it somewhere and tune yourself lock yourself in a room if you live with people just get let them excuse you that i'm tuning in with the lord i'm tuned out and i'm tuning with the lord and take your bible take whatever message book and read and say lord i want to tune with you i want you to move me further and higher i want you to take a deity i'm your daughter i'm your son i'll see you in my life but i want to see you more in my life i want to have that one-on-one with like moses like hannah like esther i don't want to go back to preaching esther has to put a life in their hands to go before kinahi soros because if you are not invited by the king and you go they will kill you you could be executed but esther was tuned and said pray for me for three days or whatever three weeks or whatever prayers they had tune yourself in god and pray if you want if you can fast let it be a fasting day if you want to eat if you come fast eat whatever i want to do but i want to have that day where i don't even talk to anybody get up in the morning don't by making calls and listening to course and whatever just shut everything away from you and take yourself in a way and go into prayer and see what the lord will do to you god bless you god bless you glory hallelujah amen the lord has a lord for you and as you do your do or you pray you read your prayer journal that musicians can help us we can tune into the lord jesus christ by the word the lord has more for us than we have ever received the lord has more for through the ministry through our pastor for us the more that we can ever receive the lord has gifts sitting here just like moses didn't know he had a gift he thought he has to fight with military might the lord has got gifts and blessings sitting right here and the more we tune in individual individually and as a group as a body of christ the more the lord manifest things in our life the third policy you don't throw it away from you the lord is in you don't cast him away don't say i'm going to die before i see the lord no you don't need villa land on the other the villain is right here you need your blessing right here when you get to the other side it's beyond blessing you don't need money to pay bills over there as a professor you don't need these houses and if you need a house here speak it into creation if you need your family redemption speaking to creation god bless you shall we be on our feet heavenly father we thank you for this day we give glory and honor to you thank you for the little broken pieces of word father bless this bread into the heart of your people lord jesus christ have your prominence lord heal the sick lord bring glory unto your name every desire upon the hearts of your people father give it to us lord jesus and take all the glory from your name bless our dear pastor brother jack bless his family lord jesus christ bless our brothers listening from different areas home and dear friends citizen state lord bless them and give them their portion bless this week lord father i pray that we bring testimonies of your goodness and mercy we love you father we bless you and we give all our glory to your name jesus christ amen god bless you oh only believe but a troy only believed all things are possible oh [Music] all things are possible only [Music] amen let's just uh give the lord amen a praise offering amen we really appreciate brother kwaku for [Music] allowing the lord to use his lips to speak to our hearts this morning amen so much was said amen and just amen if we just sat and just ate amen of a seven course meal amen just what a beautiful message your beulah land oh my just never quite seen it that way or just so many different types you know one of the things three things we lost in the garden of eden [Music] eternal life [Music] fellowship with god and dominion and the redemption is supposed to bring back eternal life fellowship with god [Music] and dominion everybody just usually look for eternal life but it's also supposed to bring back divine fellowship it's also bring back where we where adam stood in a place of dominion before the fall and when you receive the baptism of the holy ghost you receive your eternal life fellowship with god and dominion [Music] amen amen amen your beulah land amen what a wonderful wonderful scripture just tune in my god tune in i was reading just this week in that very same message fellowship by redemption and in there the prophet was talking about say true fellowship is when your thoughts and god thoughts become one [Music] when you can just get to a place he was talking about there get find a time where you can disconnect from the fourth and fifth dimension [Music] get away from um the cell phone get away from uh uh radio and television and all these other distractions news programs get away from that to find the time to tune out and tune in nothing but the word of god and prayer and allow your thoughts to become one with his thoughts good god almighty whoo that's powerful absolutely powerful then you get your place to appoint the prophet preached a message led by the spirit he asked a question he was talking about how the time when he had to go to the hotel and he went on the walk and met the the old lady the the the the lady there and the son you know the story that was uh a secret of venereal disease but he had asked a question he said has any of you ever been led by the spirit [Music] he said remember that time when you were sitting there under the anointing and something was pulling on your heart to go to the altar and you got up and you obeyed that spirit you were being led by the spirit the very fact that you come here today to hear the word of the lord you were being led by the spirit so when anything that we do we got to get into the spirit of the thing you go to a football game a basketball game what do you do you get into the spirit of the uh the event that's taking place if they say raise your hand to the left you wear your hand to the left they say go to the right you you go to the right you you get into the spirit and you do what they say and you scream and you and you have a wonderful time so in order to tune in you have to first get into the spirit allow yourself to disconnect from whatever see people go out and they go out to these clubs and parties and different things what they do they disconnect from their regular life and just want to go say i want to go have a big fun so i'm going to disconnect from my other responsibilities and all of these kind of things that got me bogged down i'm going to go home and just kind of let my hair down and get into the spirit but we don't want to get into a worldly spirit we want to get into the heavenly spirit so we disconnect from the world and go into a secret place amen and let our thoughts become in line with god's thoughts so how do we tune in when you do that and god began to speak to your spirit and the brother said you go in to take your bible and you begin to read a little scripture or something that god began to deal with you there in private and then you come to church and god speaking from the pulpit now you're in tune because see to be in tune it takes two things coming in line tuning up perfectly and see if you never try to get yourself into that place on the other side here you just got this floating ball by itself there's nothing to line it up with [Music] that's why it's important on your own and in your own time going in with god he speaks to you shows you things and then from the pulpit the minister speaks and it lines right up now you know you in tune with god [Music] now it becomes a revelation now it becomes a revelation spend time with god get away from your own thoughts worldly thoughts from that other dimension amen and let's tune in like the brothers say let's tune in to this sixth and seventh dimension amen the lord is so good hey amen amen the lord is just wonderful hey man let's say one more course of that song as we prepare to leave [Music] believe all things are possible [Music] only believe [Music] [Music] believe all things are possible only [Music] most gracious heavenly father [Music] lord we just say thank you [Music] thank you lord god for your eternal word lord oh god i was just feel so good to eat of the bread of life what a fellowship what a joy defined leaning on the everlasting arms [Music] oh lord god we pray father god for as the brother said our trials and tribulations lord god and our calamities lord goddess it's just for your glory o father god you for you to bring forth o father god in us lord god you say why cry speak the word of the lord oh lord god may we recognize

wings and and and just ride the current of the holy ghost lord up into the heavenlies and lord the closer the further away we get from the world into you lord god the clearer we see the clearer our eyes of understanding become open the clearer our revelation it's lord sometime when you're amongst the the trees you the old saying you can't see the forest for the trees the lord we rise above these things of this world lord god so far above that that that that cares that if life no longer even affect us politics no longer even affect us [Music] for we are uh uh uh feasting in heavenly places we're looking lord god to the word of god and the promises of god to a better land a better place in another dimension we look beyond this dimension lord god we don't live in this dimension we're all of this mission but our minds hearts and everything is already left as a red wizard we're potentially in the resurrection right now we're being resurrected lord god if there's any that may be listening that need to know this salvation [Music] who may question it why why are they so excited in a time like this and they're seeking salvation lord to be saved to be rescued the yoke of bondage be broken in their lives oh god i pray right now father that you touch them may they be led by the spirit right now father fall to their knees and repent and call on the name of the lord oh god and may you begin to do a work lord god and lead him oh father god to a better land lord a better place father god show them a better way a better way of living o lord we pray o father god for those that
