it was impressive for you to come really tried to get away from it but the Lord I think he's I like to just give a testimony how it came about it was from one of the messages that brother Branham preached where he was given an account of the Lord telling him to speak to the storm and of course he did he follow it through and the elements obeyed him and he was on his way back down the hill as he described it and the Lord spoke to him again and said why don't you walk through the wilderness with me take a walk with me and that just really affected me just hearing that and as I meditated on it I I could just sense the brother branham's excitement and his aw of the Lord speaking directly to him in that manner and as I thought about it I said you know he's given me the same invitation mm-hmm he's given us the same invitation in walking in the light of the gospel that he has given us for this day and I just like to share it with you and I pray a blessing to you I pray you can

his name a man I'm gonna appreciate being in the house of the Lord on today y'all be seated just for a quick moment man so grateful for everyone being here today and know we have some saints that will be travelling amen after service to head back to their different homes and I can't wait for the day we can have a meeting and never have to return home again man but we'll be going to our heavenly homeland glory to God and they'll be looking for you if working can't find you what happened to a raptor took place glory to God I can't wait for that day church no more bills to pay rent man ain't calling you mortgage man ain't calling car man ain't calling you hallelujah to be a man every everything that say everyday be Sun be glory to God would be looking forward to that but we want to thank God for all the saints that have come a man from afar and from near and now those that would be traveling back we had some saints a manna know a brother Anderson some of the states miss Church and also from brother Nicholls Church some of the saints that came we really appreciate you all we thank for you I really thank God for you and I already got it noted a man in just a mental note that for the Anderson have meetings brother Jack need to show up for the Anderson company when preaching you just show it up brother Jack need to show up sometimes I just I learned I learned I learned quick and I just appreciate it so I felt do something y'all let us know Berlin and so I'm gonna try to put it on my calendar so I can just get there and be supportive a man of what was happening in West Columbia appreciates you all Dave man made man we thank God for the message on last night I am not ashamed of the message not ashamed of a message and brother McGarry just did a wonderful job just talking about our beloved brother Paul and and and and now he he kept it right with Scripture he kept it right with Scripture and just kind of showed you some things the different mindsets that people have that are coming against the reveal word for this day the pattern is applicable right so when you're looking to see what happened there when in Paul's time in Jesus time and hopefully you can kind of make the transition and see what's happening today in your time don't worry to go but we're determined to stay with this word hey man I don't care how many things people try to point out hey man no it doesn't mean I'm sorry it's gonna take more than a bridge and a bear to detour me [Music] you talk about a vision at two years old two years old that's what you're telling me about did you have a vision at three years old don't take more than that right so I'm determined I'm not ashamed of this message and I'm also not ashamed of the messenger praise the Lord I always ask this question say if brother Branham is not the fulfillment of Malachi 4 and a man in this revelation 10 in Matthew 17 if he's not the fulfillment of these scriptures then you need to tell me who is right because there's got to be me larger company for the great and terrible day of the Lord so Eve I must stay away from them but I just appreciate the Lord Jesus I'm grateful for the word a man that has been brought to us and on yesterday morning brother brother Steven came to us and this morning a man he's back to preach amen a little bit more praise the Lord and [Applause] again I thank God for the friendship a man that I have in brother steamin and we've preached meetings together we we play golf together a man and we just you know and sometimes you just need another pastor friend you can just bounce things off of and you know he's just been that way for me and I just I just really really appreciate him and you know we just we think we thank God for the fellowship that we have and this morning actually before brother Steven even came over the enemies start attacking him with a tooth a man that just began to just throb and paint and but yet he comes and he preaches the gospel and mostly I would not even know that he's standing here in pain preaching right in pain but I love when a man a man will do that and and not necessarily look for sympathy from the people but you know he just wants you to pull with him so we can all just defeat this devil together our scene brothers demon preach and lose his voice in the midst of preaching and just stand up and almost just mouthing words you can barely hear what he's saying and in the midst of preaching because he was faithful God would restore his voice right there in the midst of the service while he's preaching so the same God that restored his voice I believe was able to take care of that tooth this morning praise the Lord so as our brother just prepares to come I want you to just again pull on the Word of God a man this morning don't just sit and stare but enter in and receive all that God has in store for you today let's then tie feet a man unless welcomed God's servant to the pulpit for the danny's demon the pastor of house of fellowship there and we call it Sarasota but it's Mayaka I believe a man but these are the Saints assist the Saints a man assist a church over there on the west coast of Florida we think for them we appreciate them and as he comes let's just sing this song our God is greater our God is stronger our God is higher than any other our God is healer awesome in power is our God's lift your hands close your eyes and let's welcome a man got servant to the pulpit as we worship our Lord a man our God is greater say hi God is greater and our God is to call you up then Amy oh and I God is healer he is our son he's our God hallelujah yes he's our God sing it again our God is greater [Music] [Music] allelujah hey man let me say he's awesome what a mighty God we serve an awesome empower hey van well we have certainly amen enjoyed being here with you all amen and you have been a wonderful people to preach to you make it easy to preach you almost make us feel like we're preachers amen and we appreciate that that's a compliment to you to your pastor brother Jack his family we certainly appreciate each and every one of you and think about how precious you are in the sight of God how much worth you are to him even so much more amen brother BAM said if I held a drop of his blood and a cup and think about how precious that blood was and how I'd be so careful with it he said but yet you're the purchase of that blood a man you're a man the reason it was shed he came to save his children and that's why you make it easy to preach because you're his children we certainly appreciated the Liberty Amen that you gave us and also Amen that I thought the service last night was a masterpiece and then wonderful I appreciated amen amen amen thank you brother Aaron I mean you raise your hand and talking about you a man and I have appreciated the fellowship with him and just to reconnect and and I thought the invitation to go fishing was pathetic but a man but it was really good my bad amen yeah he's right it was prophetic [Music] amen I pre I appreciate you brother Aaron appreciate the connection and the fellowship we've had today man thank you brother Jack amen and amen the Lord is good and we want to take a little subject this morning I had thought that I would just continue on with Jeroboam but I don't think I'm going to but we might bring him up but I want to just title this to see this morning it could be this evening I don't really know why man but when I title this born of an incorruptible seed amen amen if we're turn in our Bibles to the book of Ephesians to amen let's look at the 19th verse now therefore you're no more strangers and foreigners but fellow-citizens with the Saints and of the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ Himself being the chief Cornerstone I mean that's what we appreciate in a true ministry that God has given us is that it built upon the right foundation we know where we stand we know in whom we believed a man there's no question there's no fear brother Rama said Paul being the master preacher that he was that he came to knock the fear out of the people he could be saved today and you could be lost tomorrow we don't have that fear Amen we don't even have that concept as a church amen some churches believe you can be saved and lost again but not this church and when our foundation is right let me tell you they meant you can stand here and have no fear and the devil knows he cannot prevail over you amen what a church amen I want to I just want to add this amen to what was said last night was such a masterful service but you know the ministry excuse me the world doesn't want a ministry that preaches the predestinated seat of God they don't want a ministry that and I will let you sit in a minute but they don't want a ministry that teaches it's wrong for a woman to cut her hair and it's wrong for a woman to preach they don't want a ministry like that they don't want to listen to hear a man say that he saw a pillar of fire coming and to him and they want to make him out to be some kind of criminal and a deceiver you don't want a ministry like a they don't like the prophets message on marriage and divorce and they certainly don't believe this message on serpents Sea right they they don't like his message on the Trinity as he was not a trinitarian but he correctly taught the Godhead and it was rejected by the church which he preached it to that's why they said he was crazy that's why he said they got off at the end a man they don't like to hear him say that he went beyond the curtain of time and he preached the mysteries of God they didn't want that kind of ministry even now even then some people made him out to be God but by the end of his ministry most men had left him most ministers didn't want his ministry because the strange doctrines were too hard to be understood amen you might be thinking I'm talking about brother Branham but I'm not I'm talking about Paul we said that sounded just like brother Branham didn't it you know why he came in the Alpha he's coming the Omega 2 same God same spirit same pillar of fire raised the Lord Church and when he's preached last night I just thought of this when he preached last night he said well we'll pause brut be there and will they will it will Paul may be judged on what Paul preached he says yes he will I said well if Paul groups make it my group's gonna make it - hallelujah cuz I preach what Paul preached a man hallelujah god bless you let's read one more scripture amen I'm having a hard time reading this morning but that'll be alright 1st Peter 1:22 seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of a corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever you can be seated amen amen we thank the Lord for what he's doing with us thank the Lord for amen this church amen what God is doing here and I know sometimes it can become a slog amen and in ministers mind you like Lord and you know things are hard and we know churches go through seasons and we go through our ups and downs and we go through our dry times and you know brother Jack and labor and labor and a service and in a fault and maybe for weeks and and and you know it put a lot of time and effort into the study of what he's preaching and it seems sometime you know maybe the people are not responding like he would hope they'd respond you know maybe in the way that he received it and he's like you know you know it was just so good to me and when they you know they're sleeping and then the one I thought it would help they didn't even come and and I'm like you know what is this this effort that I'm put in here God what are you doing and then then you have a man come like brother Aaron or another minister and they're preached one service and the people here say the same thing brother Jack said and the people will receive it as from God and and but they didn't realize all that hard work and plowing prepared you to receive that moment and that's that's what it means to be a pastor is you got a plow and there's a lot of rocks in the church that have to be unearthed and there's a lot of roots you know I had a shade tree that I loved that was over my whole house and you know my drove my bill and my electric bill down and everything but something so beautiful can also become something harmful and it became I had a root system it went right into my kitchen and into my plumbing and my floors begin to crack and everything I had to take the tree down that was hard work and and we got it tore down then we got the stump grind it out and then then I put a porch back there but you know what amen where that tree used to be everything began to fall apart again they packed the earth but where the roots was they rotted out and died and then they fell in so there's still the effects of it and that's what a church is like you just got to deal with things and move through things and and I believe brother Jack as a pastor you're a special person that it that you know nobody likes to be called a cow but you know that's what a pastor's you know he's an ox you know he wants to be the eagle right brother I'm the Evangelist I see things amen but then God has to have them cows it's just yeah pastor sure stupid he just looks at me you are the best words of advice I found in council because I say I'm just going to go off the cuff here a little bit but you know I found out that counseling people doesn't work really good because they didn't really want it they wanted sympathy not counsel and I found out the best words you can ever tell somebody in council is what my dad always it'll be alright in that right brother Aaron you know I you know my life is falling apart I've lost my job I have no money in the bank I can't put food on the table my wife's gonna leave me I'm sick I can't come to church anymore either it's gonna be okay you know I because if you'd come back to the word it will be okay amen so I want to preach this morning and if you just just bear with me and I might go a little slow and end up quick that I want to just just reiterate a few things to you but but brother branham made a statement he said the more that I travel he said I see that people are not getting to Christ he said they're being pointed to the wrong odd object he said they're being pointed to a church they're being pointed to a party I mean now I had a party in the room above me last night and it went to all hours of the night we even called down to the front desk they didn't do anything about it was rock and roll and screaming hollering going on banging on the floor had to be right above me I'm in 310 it was 410 and that's not the party he's talking about he's talking about where we're men make a doctrine a party and then they point to that and said except you come to that you have not come to Christ but actually it was a Jeroboam thing put up before the people where they're pointed to that and he said they're not getting to Christ he said they're getting them to a creed they're getting them to a church they're getting them to a doctrine but they're not getting them to Christ now we know Christ has dr. it falls like do it comes distilled like do but God's doctrine is different than men's doctrine because God's doctrine is nutrients God's doctrine is something that falls upon the seed and that seed begins to express itself that's what doctrine will do true doctrine will do that man's doctrine will make you look like him God's doctrine will make you look like him say man brother BAM said that any true message at calms he said it comes in the ways of signs and wonders he said it'll attract your attention he said if it does not do something new and take you out of the system he said it's not from God right so I mean that you could even have a supernatural work amen but if it didn't take you out of the system it wasn't God that is the purpose of God sending us Malachi 4 not that we could look like a church again but that we could come back into the image that God had before the foundation of the world which is him hey man let me just read you some scriptures you already know but I'm gonna read them to you brother Jesus or excuse me John wrote in John 3 there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do the miracles that thou doest except God be with him jesus answered and said verily I say unto you except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus said how can a man be born when he's old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of spirit of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh that's a corruptible seed that which is born of the Spirit is spirit Marvel not that I said unto thee you must be born again man now the wind bloweth where it listeth and you hear the sound thereof and you can't tell whence it cometh and whether it goes so is everyone born of the Spirit and so Nicodemus answered and said how can these things be jesus answered and said are you a master of Israel and knowest not these things so you'd understand this his brother Aaron was saying last night and when Jesus came he came telling them things they'd never heard of before they looked at him says well we know you're a teacher come from God but brother Branham said that Jesus never referred to himself as a teacher because he would become he would be a teacher after his resurrection but he wasn't coming to teach at that time though there was teaching he was coming to be the Lamb of God he was coming to show them amen what the new birth would be and without his death and resurrection there would be no birth and I want you to know that Jesus would not ask you to do something that he himself has not personally experienced you know we're so caught up in this age and you just kind of speak to the young people a little bit we're so caught up in our careers and what we're trying to do and in our careers becomes more important than church and the Word of God and it is important I understand you have to put food on the table but it's never been and never will be more important than the principles of God never be more important than missing church that I have to miss church to further my career in fact you would think that every action of Jesus from the time he was born to the time he died would be choreographed and written and every action would been put on display but God himself never wrote much maybe one thing two things about Jesus's life before the baptism of the Holy Ghost because it is what he was when the Holy Spirit came upon him that began to fulfill and come to his purpose before that God never even wrote about himself in a human body except as he was his 12:00 in the temple they called it the silent years but in that time he humbled himself but when he came he would not come and fulfill who he was without the Holy Spirit coming upon him and neither can you fulfill who you are without you being born of that incorruptible seed hmm so I thought it was profound that God himself would not write much about his life until after the Spirit came upon him Acts 2:36 I just read a few scriptures here and we're getting into a little story if we can with the help of the Lord therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus whom you crucified both Lord and Christ now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and the rest of the Apostles men and brethren what shall we do then Peter said to them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you and to your children and to all that afar off even as many as the Lord our God shall call Paul said in first Corinthians 12:13 for by one spirit we are all baptized into one body whether it be Jew or Gentile whether he be bond or free we've all been made to drink into one spirit amen so you see Jesus came says you must be born again Peter come says you must be born again amen Paul comes you must be born again you see brother Danny you say I must be born again yeah you must be born again a man acts nineteen one it came to pass at my Apollo's at Corinth and Paul having passed through the upper coast came to Ephesus and finding certain disciples he said unto them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed now I want to tell you this there's nobody who's ever received the Holy Ghost without believing there's nobody just showed up and didn't care and they say I received it you might have been under the effect of it but you never received it you can dance you can shout you can run the house you can sing you can be healed you can have testimonies but until you believe you'll never receive and Paul said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed they said we don't we have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost now I just want to say this if you're a seed of God and the word has been revealed in your our God is obligated not to leave you back in a revelation that has not progressed it is God's obligation to bring you before the promise to fulfill the promise you say well you know it's got to be my effort yeah faith without works is dead but if God brought you to this age he had to bring the answer to this age and he brought you here to meet the challenge of the age and it's God's obligation to bring you across that promise so it can be fulfilled but you have to believe it so they said now we've not so much as heard whether there'd be any Holy Ghost and they said unto them he said unto them what to unto what then were you baptized they said under John's baptism so they were baptized unto repentance and so this is old this is very familiar to you but I just want to run across this before we get to our message maybee said well we were baptized into John's baptism you know John was a true prophet amen was a true ministry but he was pointing to the one that would have the true baptism amen he could only bring him so far he they had to come to the person of Christ hey man they said now he said then she said he very light verily baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people you should believe on him which had come after him that is on christ jesus when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus and when paul had laid his hands on them the Holy Ghost came on them and they spoke with tongues and prophesied amen what was it Amen everyone every one of these men have the same thing in common you cannot Amen amen walk with God without a personal experience so I'm preaching on being born of an incorruptible seed but the subtitle is a personal experience with God so when brother Branham said I look and I see that this big hint this hindrance has been thrown in front of the people and it's the enemy that threw it in front of them he said because he's not the object it been pointed to they've either been pointed to a Dogma a doctrine a party and experience a sensation or something instead of being pointed to Christ the word now I'm gonna I'm gonna quote something here and I don't I don't want to put my own understanding to because that's not really that important I want to go further than that but the random said in serves as this the time he said he said one of the mysteries that's to be unveiled in this day is the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation now I'm not finished with that quote but I will say this that there's people took that quote and made us a bunch of Baptists okay so I believed it so I got it and and they never they never understood what brother Branham was saying so he said he said the Holy Ghost with out sensation but the person of Jesus Christ so you have to meet the person of Jesus Christ now when he said sensation he's not saying okay you're not going to feel anything you're not gonna know it you know because I have never seen brother Jack an age produced so many people say they got the Holy Ghost but don't know when if I was born naturally I can tell you where I was born I tell you I can show you a certificate I can take you not to the room but I can take you to the hospital there's a record people just show up I yeah I got it I just don't know when I met him I just didn't know it let's just brother Branham says God will never meet with man nowhere else but under the blood when you turn the blood down then your meeting place with God has been taken away God made his first decision in the Garden of Eden that man would only worship Him under this what is this for God may double-barrelled this morning amen he said he said now that's the only place that God will meet with man then the only place that God ever met with man under the shed blood the only place he meets with man today is under the shed blood of the sacrifice I don't care if you're Methodist Baptist Presbyterian if you can forget your differences Roman Catholic whatever you might be and you come under the shed blood God will meet both of us there that's where we can all meet and fellowship on the same grounds but otherwise he will not meet you because you're a Methodist he will not meet you because you're Pentecostals he'll meet you under one condition that's the shed blood when your sins have been confessed and expelled in his presence then by the blood and the blood is always before him and therefore he can only see you through that shed blood and you're white as snow when you've confessed your sins otherwise you're not there you cannot fellowship he said that's the reason you don't see things happening in the churches they confess they believe the blood but they reject the very plan to get to the blood which is the word so notice the church says they believe the blood they sing about the blood but they reject the plan of the blood so then they cannot be under the blood is that true this is why we're not a denominational people because they sing about the blood they believe in the blood but they reject the plan of the blood and the plan of the blood the blood is the revealed word that is the life of Christ amen you might come you're never honor that word and come and say I'm a Roman Catholic I demand this to be done you can't do it Methodist Baptist Pentecostals you can't do it the only way you can do it is under the mercies of God through His grace is to come through the shed blood of Jesus Christ and say Lord I claim that promise and if you are really under that blood God is obligated to that word a man so we're coming to you this morning we're not coming to you in the name of a church we're coming to you under the blood of Jesus Christ when we come under the blood of Jesus Christ God is obligated to his word all if you can understand brother and sister that when you come before God and believe Amon and you're coming under the blood God is obligated to keep that word amen to fill you with the Holy Ghost to give you the desire of your heart you don't have to sit back and wonder but you can believe right under the hour that call is plenty [Applause] hey man he says no wonder they don't believe in miracles no wonder you can't believe in the supernatural no wonder they condemn it the same reason they condemned it back there is the reason they condemn it today they're guilty as guilty can be because it's only under the shed blood he goes on to say in the message marriage and divorce as God brought the word down through the ages he says notice a man he can put her away she cannot put him away he proved it in the days when Luther Wesley and Pentecost when they refused to become the further part of him by having a spiritual sexual affair to become pregnant with further part of the Lord what has he said they refuse to walk on in sin relationship with God and take his word into themselves so that they could be changed I'm saying all of this you come back to one basic point you see why God had to send a prophet hey man he said why because you if you've not been a denomination a man you understand it was it was a house of hell it was cells jail cells and people bound and changed and and they were diseased and they were wanting to be free but it could not be free in another in another vision brother our dream brother Branham had was a woman which was a type of the church was trying to get up off the floor and a man kept beating her down with a three-cornered claw the DA a doctrine it may not just be three cards that might be in the denominations but around the realm of the message it's other clubs that are used upon a woman that gets beat down in fear and she's hearing the word she tries to get up and faint but it's beat down again you imagine well you're not supposed to listen to preachers only push play even though I get beat down with Hannah because if I receive it from brother Danny and not brother branham I'm not receiving it as pure as for I'm sorry that is people without the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost will say only what the word said brother man never asked me to come in this hour and say the the the the the and read every quote exactly the same but what he did say is you have the same spirit I have you'll not change the services that you've got it'll be the same God the same spirit even bringing the same word with the same results brother chap under the Holy Ghost you can preach this message in Souls will be born again brother Anderson under the Holy Ghost you preach this word souls are born again why because it's incorruptible seed not corrupted by men the corruptible seed is man so he said that there he said they refused to come further part so what happened in the Bible he takes the he takes the story of Esther said what happened when when Vashti refused to come out with a king and a man he said he said the church he said he put her away he said it's the same with the church that refuses become pregnant in the age that we now live in to bring forth children of this age we are not Lutheran's we are not Wesleyan neither are we Pentecostals we've gotta be children of this age through the pregnancy of the word of God Peyman the pregnancy of the Word of God is being born again by an incorruptible seed you notice how he says it Amen that true born-again experience only comes under the revealed word this might be controversial to you but I'll say it you mean brother Danny I can't be born again in the Baptist no they refused it brother Branham indicted the system said they crucified the word how can you be born again where it's been crucified you said my brother Danny had a real experience with God I do not doubt it because if you're a seed of God he will pull you out hallelujah hey man so now he went right on revealing his word to the body and vindicating the same by himself and his children begin to kind of look more like him because it's fully maturing and they become children of the word you know you know Luther looked more like Christ but he did not look like Christ right he still had a lot of Roman Catholic tendencies he received revelation about the communion but there was a lot of other things that he still held on to I've been to his home I've been to where he was and I've seen his pray up into Wittenberg I've seen the door I've seen these things and it was a wonderful man of God but you know you go there today him in the Roman Catholics identify with him a man named and say the Roman Catholics say the protest is over you know I they come back because if you don't fully come out you go back you say but I understand how people could leave the message you go back to the world cuz they never came out [Music] they came out port waving and they went back they tried to receive it under the wrong thing that's one of the mysteries today not receiving it amen he said receiving the Holy Ghost without sensation what is he saying there amen brother what is he saying that he's not telling you you receive the Holy Ghost thing they don't feel it because he goes on to say 1964 him in the Holy Ghost in brother Aaron preacher last night is a definite experience with God definite means hey you knew it happened define define you define something you know if it's it's confused it's kind of blurry but define you see clear I know I met God I know he changed me Mike changed from death unto life the evidence you're looking for is Amen look at what you was and look at what you are hey man I've been changed from death unto life my desires they may have changed there's an anchor inside of me that I could a man even if I wanted to walk away I cannot walk away hallelujah I've got the Saints heed Peter had Lord to whom shall we go you alone have them so then what is the mystery the baptism Holy Ghost without sensation the mystery of the baptism the Holy Ghost without sensation is the mystery is the baptism of the Holy Ghost without the intervention of man whoever men are they try to put their part in how it should be always try to manufacture so he said it's the mystery of the baptism the Holy goes without sensation but the person of Christ performs in you the same works he did what is he saying then write to her brother and sister he's saying that the life of Christ is in you like it was in him but I've never told you something strange he just quoted to you Romans 8:2 same spirit it was in Christ dwells in you you know also quicken your mortal body let's go to Genesis 25 I won't tell you a story you know the devil has battled us this whole time we've been here I want to say brother Jack I'm glad to be here I'm glad it's here to meet with brother Aaron and the fellowship that we've had and and with you all amen and III have a well don't even worry about it I got a situation in my body that keeps getting worse and worse I want to tell the devil he's a liar he's a liar he's only hitting what he can can't hit the things that God has taken Genesis 25 21 and the Isaac entreated the Lord this let me tell you a story now okay Isaac entreated the Lord for his wife because she was barren there you go brother Jack brother Aaron because she was barren and the Lord was entreated of him you know Lord will be entreated of your Berenice it's it's the Lord's obligation that you don't come in empty that's the Feast of the Tabernacles you shall not come before God empty all right so God God a man he will deal with bareness the Lord was entreated of him and Rebecca his wife conceived and the children struggled together within her and she said if it be so why am i thus and she went to inquire of the Lord and the Lord said unto her two nations are in that womb two manner of people shall be separated from my bowels and the one people shall be stronger than the other people and the elder shall serve the younger amen now as I read the quote in in in the reason I pause here I'm just trying to find a place where I want to come to so as I've read that quota for the random where he said so one of the mysteries to be revealed time is a baptism of the holy ghost without sensation so it's a Baptist the holy ghost without tradition right but the Word of God and full effect upon you so we want to spend a little bit of time of that which is a person of Jesus Christ the full Word of God not the full text book but perfect interpretation with divine you understand that what you believe is the perfect interpretation of the word not intellectual conception but the perfect interpretation work with divine vindication this message is divinely vindicated you say well I don't believe it I think the vindication you're talking about it was a light in the ceiling it was a rocket in the air it was your explanation doesn't move me amen now now that word intervene where it says that the Holy Ghost without sensation and I said that it was that it's without the intervention of man that word intervene means to come or to come or to occur between two times or events it's something that gets between a time and an event that's what intervene means gets between a time and an event it means to become involved in something such as a conflict in order to have an influence on what happens this is what intervene means to get involved in something to have an influence on what happens Satan loves that word to get involved it also means to happen something that happens to an event or that causes a delay it means to come in between by way of hindrance or modification so intervention is modification we modify we make it different than what it was now I'm trying here to find my place let's talk about this family for just a little bit this couple Isaac and Rebecca who have we believe have been brought to earth to fulfill a very important part of the puzzle of God if you will that God's mystery is brother branham pointed back and he said and he'd point back to those types in this in the scripture they said their shadows and types of God's great mystery and the plan he wanted to fulfill and Isaac and Rebekah was a very big piece of the puzzle that you could understand what God was trying to do Rebekah is a type of the bride she had supernatural things take place in her life where she didn't realize it at the time but there had been prayers prayed over her by a prophet she didn't know it was her specifically but he said Lord let the woman that comes out and water give me water will also water my camels let this be the one and Abraham had said the same angel that was with me that angel will go with you and and so she was going to be under the influence of angels she was going to be a prophets prayer a man and brother BAM said the angel of the Lord was at the well of Rebekah's a half hour before Eliezer got there so now here is Rebekah at the well she's under the influence of this angel something was changing her atmosphere so that when that messenger came in from Abraham's house she just received it not only she receive it she went farther in the vision just the way he had asked let her also water the camels and he looked at her and said could this be the one so she's a very important part of the puzzle explaining God's purpose at the end time because brother Branham said she became one of the queens of the Bible she wasn't at the beginning but she became one because she agreed with the word you know as long as you sent here you may have message terminology message understanding but if you have not let the word go through you you're just a church you're not the bride rather Ram said the church is becoming the bride by letting the word go through her you know Jesus himself would not come to earth and say I'm the I am the author of salvation no he never said that he said the Bible says he became the author he became how did he do it he humbled himself in obedience you know God Amen knows everything he's omnipresent omnipotent he covers all time and space but Jesus as a man says I only do what my father shows me Jesus as a man did not know everything to sympathize with you to take every bit of who you are upon himself so that you can't sit here today and say Jesus does not understand he understands more than you've ever understood Oh help me now hey I'm a man here tonight today and I don't understand the temptation of the perversion that's out there where a man wants to go live with a man I don't understand that but I'm gonna hurt your feelings Jesus does I don't care what he gives you I had a pastor tell me that he had a man in his congregation with a family and with children start an affair with a man and denominations who was also married with children and they they were having a homosexual affair and neither one of them wanted to be in it and they tried to get out of it we got back by going to psychologists trying to get help and they couldn't get help they tried to change and they couldn't change one day that passes on the phone with that man and that man screaming at him you don't know what it's like to be tempted and you don't know it's like to be tempted by homosexuality and and that pastor says you know what you're right I don't I don't he said then I felt a tap on my shoulder he said the Holy Spirit says you tell him I do hey I want to tell you you don't understand that you don't want to understand my tell you when that word went over that phone I do he said it got quiet and that man broke down begin to weeping right there that man was delivered came in one word for God to let you know I know where you're at [Applause] Jesus was not a homosexual no jesus never lived in perversion but he knows what it's like to be a high priest she knows what it's like to take upon it when he was on the cross brother Jack crying hey let me tell you I'm getting a little bit away from Rebecca right here but this is still talking about a true birth so you know when Paul said great is the mystery of godliness you thought it was just understanding dogma no it wasn't understanding dong or creed or doctrine about the correctness of the Trinity or the correctness of the Godhead no it wasn't that you didn't understand that your car became man and knew what it was like to pray and not have a prayer answered amen to feel lost to fall on the ground to need another man to pick him up again he knows what it's like to be sick that's my god ah brother Danny what he taught talk about the incorruptible seed you think this message is weak you think this message is weak I'm gonna tell you how a weak this message is there was a man came out two men came out in and out time and they were condemned to die and they'd never known Jesus the RAM said they never met him the Bible said they were criminals and that word criminal means they were violent criminals violent men they never met Jesus the only time they ever saw him was Jesus being dragged and staggered and falling through the streets they never saw the hand of John saying behold the lamb of God they only heard crucify him crucify him saw men beaten they saw man crying I saw a man needing help but the devil made a mistake hey man he allowed he anointed that man so much he anointed you knowing that Pilate so much that he wrote down King of the Jews Jesus of Nazareth King of the Jews and the Bible tells us both of these criminals are crucified on either side and both of them are screaming at Jesus and mocking him both of them are mocking every devil in hell is there to crush that life of Jesus and it's under that atmosphere under that pressure under that crucifixion and them thieves are throwing this in his face but that one who has a seed enemy keeps looking and something keeps Jesus of Nazareth King of the Jews something he gives to catch him the only word he would see called his heart because no matter if it was an unbeliever wrote it down what he wrote was the truth he was told about an incorruptible seed and Jesus at his weakest Jesus as a man grind my God why have you forsaken me Jesus at his weakness was able to save that criminal you think this message is weak here's a man who's crying out I'm forsaken you know why he said my God why have you forsaken me you know why he said it because he has so fully become you he knows what it's like to feel lost it was when your sin hit him he says you forsaken me I mean if you said here is it old calling forsaken I've crossed the line I can't give back to God that's why he cried that he cried it so you cannot be forsaken he cried it so you could sit here on Sunday morning say you know what I believe that and because I believe I'm gonna receive cause I believe I'm gonna receive because I believe he's gonna come upon me him in that weak man that died there his life his life that weak man that never said there's nothing to this message he's weak he can't do you think he's gonna rise again on that prophet it was a good message as long as william branham us hee-haw I want his message oh he was he was a part of it but it went here it was from God this message is a power of Resurrection or you may think it's weak right now you may think it's gone into the dirt you may think it's gone to the ground amen but I rise again not a weak message shows the character of it that when his hands were pinned and his feet were pins he could still say today he'll be with me you don't think this word is powerful Amen an unbeliever and unbelieving King can say King of the Jews Jesus of Nazareth King of the Jews and that was enough right there to ignite that seed in that man because it was a truth it was a truth now here's Rebecca who's barren and Isaac has entreated the Lord and the Lord is her ears here's his prayer and in Rebecca's pregnancy the children struggled together in the womb and he prompt her to ask the Lord that if this pregnancy is really of you why do I have this struggle you know brother Jack it's human nature to think that if God cannot be in something if it's a struggle we don't understand this struggle but the Lord was faithful to reveal to her in that time he said that it was two nations in her womb and that the separation had already begun in her body and that the elder was serve the younger we don't understand the struggles that we have because the separation has already begun we don't want the struggle but the struggle is necessary to fulfill the word so the birth of Esau and Jacob it not only was a struggle in her womb it caused the separation in Isaac and Rebekah and affected him both at how they looked at the prophecy of God God himself had prophesied the elder shall serve the younger the prophecies holy the prophecies holy the elders have served the younger but look at this their parents had favorites and because they had favorites it influenced the way they dealt with their children now I could go off and start pastoring on that right there because they had favorites they influenced how they dealt with their children now you understand one of them is a vindicated prophet there there's a queen of the Bible but one the vindicated prophet will become will become so influenced by his like that he'll be deceived you know this is really gonna hurt somebody but brother Branham said that many times prophets are wrong and many times they are deceived oh that went right against your idea of what a prophet is in I want to tell you what a prophet is he's a man of like passions like you are and here's a prophet Isaac who his favorite is Edom who God says I hate God hates him but the Prophet loves him and that means that if a prophet loves his son he could handle him wrong now that'll preach it'll preach in this hour - well hallelujah here's a prophet he loves his son his son loves him he's his favorite he's a hunter he's a man he's a man's man he's one of those hunters on Instagram he knows that a cook - and here's Jacob little boy mama's boy tent dweller stays at home lazy liar a cheat playing video games which man would you choose that boy there's no problem with a lot of our kids they don't leave the tent till they're old I didn't want you living in your mama's 10 all the way up to the you were 70 you know one tradition says that Jacob was 70 when he remained when he married I don't know how old he was but anyway that's not the point point was there was something down in that brother Ben said forgive me Lord for saying this but I'm gonna say it that way cuz that's how he said it called him a he said you would have chosen Esau right well the Prophet did I would not take the Prophet the Prophet chose him I'll choose him now it doesn't mean Jacob was a good person because he was not don't say yeah I'm that Jacob I'm at home I've lived there I'm 30 years old I'm at home I do love video games I I love staying at home and I am a - maybe you identified with that but down in the inside there was a seed that God had prophesied over they said the elder shall serve the younger now here's a queen of the Bible and a prophet of the Bible both of them are going to intervene in the prophecy of God both of them are going to get involved and both of them are going to be wrong how is it that so many can be blessed at the beginning and wrong at the end now Isaac is old and he said I need to molest my son he's got the birthright you know Jacob had already made a deal with his brother for that birthright you know it's kind of how we treat the message yeah I'll make a deal with you he made a deal with his brother and his brother was hungry so he said yeah that's a good deal you know your appetite will make you look at the value of the message the wrong way the way some you sit here you're not even interested this morning because you have an appetite for the wrong thing and you sit here and say you know what good is this birthright gonna do me I'm gonna do I'm gonna die if I don't eat some soup well what good will this message do you let's just stop and talk about that for just a minute I want to tell you how good this message is brother branham said if I prayed for 10,000 people today and every one of them died tomorrow I would still go out and preach divine healing because the word is true he said if I pray for people and they said they believe this truth and I'm paraphrasing here and then they died and came back to me and says brother he said brother Branham Billy is this what you believed was wrong it's not the truth he said I'd still believe it anyhow because it's the Word of God even if people came back and said it was oh what are you gonna believe but in a time of appetite a time of appetite see this is where people get all mixed up and see Satan has got a real powerful platform of Instagram social media these people that leave the message Satan tries to keep them reconnected with you because they used to be your friends and those friends look so happy I want to tell you why they left the message they didn't leave the message because they found something better they left the message cuz her appetite took away the value of it they wanted the things of the world they wanted to cut their hair they wanted to go back to the denomination they didn't want to live right somebody help me this morning baby but this is what this message will do it'll produce sons and daughters of God it'll produce a real clean holy lie it'll change your appetite for the things of the world kind of things of God you know what God said about Esau he said he profaned my word I had offered him a birthright he profaned it even though with tears he sought it later they already made a deal now Jacob has the birthright for a bowl of soup wonder how many of you are sitting here today you're only here because you made a deal and that deal is your conversion right part of it I have the desire I wanted more than him and he gave it up but I'm gonna take it anyway it never changed who Jacob was now the church is going to get involved because because it's a time of blessing and that old blind prophet is going to bless his son and he's told Esau go kill kill an animal and bring the venison to me and make it just the way I like it and I'll bless you that and so so he saw said alright daddy and Rebekah knew what it was saying so she went to to Jacob and said Jacob I'm gonna tell you how to be born again I'm going to tell you how to receive the blessing brother Aaron yeah yeah yes yes this way people aren't a message you me me take your coat off and sit down I love you I'm only appreciates why I'm acting like I'm an authority over you brother Bram said that the Spirit of God is not something that is schooled into you it's not taught into you it's not a tradition into you it's it is something that's predestinated into you by the hand of Almighty God and I know you're only sitting there thinking man he's sweating on my coat but hey man you're it'll be holy sweat hey man that's why they make cleaners he says now your experiences cannot be schooled or taught into you its predestinated by God's hand and God's foreknowledge now God's foreknowledge says the elder shall serve the younger it's holy its predestinated and the spirits gonna keep it but the church gets involved because she hears that the Prophet is telling his son go cook me a meal and I'll bless you so she goes and says hey listen go get some of your brothers clothes put them on so your smell I can get some fur your brother's hairy go get go get some goats can put it on your hands and and his coat and then sit there and if you and if you act like him you're gonna get the blessing you know so then if I think I because I'm wearing Erin's coat now I'm gonna start talking like him and I'm gonna say I can't somehow I begin to think maybe God is impressed with I'm acting like my brother this is what the church thought a woman that used to be holy she told him go act like your brother and the Prophet was deceived by you smell like he saw you feel like you so but you sound like Jacob who really are you I am I am Esau come here brother Aaron brother and a man no I did no no see see how Lord kill that complex in this manner hey man now in Aaron's voice say I am Aaron I'll take he's always for me so you won't feel so I am Aaron I am Aaron no no I'm Jake I am Aaron I am Aaron well you smell like him you look like him but you sound like Jacob but I am Aaron well we got a problem now thank you brother now I can be deceived now I go I go I go to that blind prophet so I he's not gonna get a complex oh yeah I've called you Esau now he's the blind prophet okay father Oh father bless me I am Aaron smell me well then I must be hearing it you know I hold myself like Aaron if I say y'all I care enough i if I have I dance like Aaron or if I speak like a man or speak like this manner speak like a Mook that's the party that's the experience let me get this off forever ruin it amen amen and so you know this is what many try to do is they try to act like somebody else but God has said I'll meet you my prophecy is holy I promise you a mean that the elder shall serve the younger but God I think I have to act like him to get it no I never said that this promise is unto you and unto your children and to them that I but a car I gotta act like no you don't you just gotta come to it this should be the name of the law God is not impressed with your knowledge of your brother so here is a queen of the Bible trying to take a man and make him act like corruptible seed God was not impressed a prophet said who are you he said I am Esau and brother branham said in desperation that that Jacob thought that settled it but what he had was gonna kill him what you have will kill you if it hasn't changed you but you call the Holy Ghost that you've experienced in your life if it has not quickened your seed will kill you was this message did not bring me to make me part of a church this message come to make me the bride if Jesus could humble himself and become the author salvation and learn it through obedience then brought the prophets said then the church is becoming the bride by letting the word go through her not her mama's opinion that's why jeroboams have raised up they want to give you their own experience their own covering they're all apostles no no now George Jacob still experienced the supernatural but he hadn't been changed Jacob became very wealthy could say God bless me but he hadn't been changed God had met him in a dream and God told him he said I'll not leave you until I have performed what I had promised Abraham huh I'm not acting German anymore brother Aaron not even acting like you your coats off for me now you know that's your problem you got to take that coat off and get real with God now Aaron and I'm not saying cuz you have your coat on you're not here with God don't don't throw that complex away we're friends I can talk to him he said he's in trouble now cuz he said God gave me it was afraid ya see what I want so you know we try to meet God with coats have been put on us from somebody else that's where like Pentecost they beat you on the back you know I was I was in in prison ministry and I was there the whole line of denominational ministers and I saw all these people said in there and every one of them given their denominational Creed hoping that guy on the other side the glass would receive it and if he did he got it and I watch it spin across the guy he's sitting there and he's beating the glass he's saying receiving receiving receiving receiving receive it keep beating it Bam Bam Bam Bam and finally that guy behind the chair behind the glass he jumped up in struggle woo that guy goes got it another one got saved what did he get he got a Mama's coat I was speaking to a man that was on the other side of the glass and and he was in there for child molestation and he was a preacher and I started talking him the first thing out of his mouth says you can't tell me anything that I don't know I've read that Bible nine times and I I being young and stupid I said well that's why you're behind the glass that's why I got kicked out it's the truth because they don't want the word they think they know it but they don't want it they reject the very plan to get under the blood they reject the very plan of the life they think Mama's coach gonna work Rebecca thinks because she heard the prophecy first she has a revelation oh god predestinated I'll meet you Jacob and I promised Abraham that his seed would precess this land don't you know Karl give me the Holy Ghost cause he promised the slack he promised Abraham he promised through Peter this promise is unto you and unto your children eat all you don't need another man to come between you and Jesus you just need to meet him as he is he's here this morning the revealed word of the hour is speaking to your heart [Music] let me let me give you a miracle and be quick here soon that's a miracle after all of his wealth after all of his children after everything he had he still didn't have what he needed he had a quote he had a blessing from a blind prophet but didn't have what he needed and his brother knew he was going home and he met him with 400 men and Jacob knew my years of being in the message as in deception is up I know I don't have the power that I thought I had to meet that man nature and you know there's Jacob trying to make a deal he's making deals he's sending them out in columns he's he's sending gifts to his brother trying to make a deal just like he did with Abra still a deal maker you know God's not here to make a deal he's not here to make a green deal blue deal a new deal or any kind of deal you must be born again that's your inalienable right it's all right to have it but have it his way not your way every time that Jacob had met God or tried to get some from God he was trying to get it according to his way or his mama's way or somebody else's right so he sent them all across the river believe it as Jabbok or something like that and there came a man a man come here man aren't you glad Aaron you're back there what's your name again blind prophet come on you preach good the other day by the way and here he met a person okay you don't mind if I grab something on your Bible do you hi see you can't see me anyway you know here this didn't walk out your wasn't just a quote coming out to me you said I got it no I got it I got it nothing changed no he met a man and they begin to have a fight it was a struggle it was a struggle in the womb and it's a struggle at the river and they're struggling they're fighting man come on fight me come on fight come on I know you think you're stronger than me come on buddy fight let's fight I may be old but I'm long-winded let me tell you something I'm here and I'm gonna win this fight I'm not going to give up until I get from this man when I'm fighting for hallelujah hey I know you're scared hey I didn't take the sit down the night's not over hey man I know you're scared to fight because you're a club people but act mate nobody's in the room come on bring it on I really can't beat him but I got a desperation in me said you know what hey hey come on say say you know God wants to see if you really mean business you think you can truck out here here date now he's so changed he take him is so desperate he knows tomorrow is his hand he's like I'm not gonna let you go leave me alone I'm not gonna let you go Thank You Isaac you're a great man look to the right they're trying to figure it out you know what that man said next he repeated what that blind prophet said but this time I want the truth from you what's your name what's your name I'm I'm Aaron oh this is business now I'm not gonna say I'm Aaron any longer I'm not gonna take comfort from another man's code I'm not going to take comfort from another man's experience hey man I gotta tell you exactly who I am I'm that liar I'm that cheat I'm that guy in the tent that plays video games and that mama's boy I'm that G I am Jacob [Applause] if you're honest with me if you're honest with me and tell me the truth I change you back up hey man and what did that angel do here eats around slapped him on me no see I'm having slapped him on the hip when he was honest with himself because the day was breaking brother and sister the hour is calm the Sun is rising Haven it's time to meet the panel it's time to meet your brother when telling them what church you belong to we give him all the proper codes and language tell him who you are when he touched him and asked him what his name was he said I'm Jacob he says not anymore I've named you Israel Prince with God and he limped the rest of his life and became something they would not eat the sinew Ezra would not eat that sinew in there any longer because it showed there something had changed and when Jacob walked out the next day to meet his brother he walked out weaker was stronger in God and not only had God touched him he touched his brother you know God you think you think God cannot make a way you've got it all figured out and here God not only touched him he went over to that band with 400 men and touched him as well so that man quit hating him and started loving him the man had stolen from took the birthright from turn around and loved him tell me what content do tell me God can't save your children tell me that God can't save your marriage tell me that God can't turn your life around that's not the God no but God I know is Abraham's gone he's the one that can put a ram in the bush he's the one that can change an old man to a young man he's the one that can take an old barren woman and bring her to life again that's my god and that's the God that'll change your body you want to know what this message is it's reality this message makes you real rather than have said not for one moment do I come that men will follow me when I come to establish a one true relationship between you and Jesus Christ that's what this message does stablish do you know him have you experienced him he's real he knows what your struggle is I know what it's like to struggle brother Jack I've been through it it's a pastor you've been through it over there you know what it's like we was fell shipping a little bit there I just going to tell it now what I went through a few years ago as a pastor you know you can get in a fight not know what's happening at the time you're fighting it and I got in one I didn't know what was going on I had been doing a lot of ministry and I did something real stupid I over schedule you know I'm not saying stupid in the sense of stupid but I'm saying stupid in the sense of stupid did you get down and I had been preaching a lot I had preached in Canada and this is the stupid part I preached in Canada and then had to do a youth meeting in Europe and so I left on Sunday night from Canada and Tuesday I went to Europe so I had preached a lot I got really tired and I came home and I got attacked very hard by by the enemy I didn't know what it was I thought I was just tired but for two weeks time every morning 4:30 a spirit would come in my room would stand about right here and it was so real brother Jack I tried to see it because it was so real and I could feel myself literally breaking down my nerves were breaking down that time trouble started in the church I didn't know what was going on I was embarrassed you're embarrassed to tell anybody because you're the man you know you're the pastor you don't wanna admit you're on the verge of a nervous breakdown and for two weeks time this thing came in she bragged anyway you're your man of God you should have just pointed a finger and yeah you're getting a fight one time you say all the right things we're getting the fight one time I told you I appreciate it my wife of the Lord really used her in that time she had a friend and some of the business dealings my wife has she has a friend it's not even in the message not even in the church not even in Florida I never been down there and it's gonna take your breath away your Roman Catholic well my wife had just said hey if you believe in prayer you thing just pray for my husband he's going through a hard time that woman wrote my wife back and described our church told us what a church so like told us where people said in the church and said your husband's problem is he's got witches in his church you got more than one as a Catholic and then she said and don't worry about it I put a heads about him I got a Roman Catholic heads I'll tell you how God uses people say God could use he saw in that moment to help Jacob I quit preaching I cancelled my meetings I quit preaching to home didn't preach for about a month the brothers stepped up and they helped me they saw the situated to get in the pulpit because I knew I'd gonna fall apart become a giver an idiot I knew it couldn't help it you say brother you need to snap out it you're right well you go through the battle so I'm up in northern Georgia we're resting there and praying and so forth I'll tell you no matter how you feel no matter how low you are no matter how you don't think you're hearing anything from God he's always there I remember one morning I had read my scriptures and then I went on a walk and I said Lord just let somebody help me today call me tell me give me a word from the Lord I got a call 30 minutes later from a brother in our church he was you know he said I was just thinking about you said the Lord told me he said take down he to read this scripture and he told me the description I had a shout because that was my devotion I ever had the same scripture the Lord had already told him tell me to read and I just read it so the Lord is always talking to me even though you don't feel it so here I am and then I get another call as I said we start to go home and get a call from brother Ron Spencer who need your prayers right now he's been diagnosed with terminal 4 stage cancer by the Lord take him through it he called me he said brother Danny said I was on my track during selling point exactly where I was on that tractor he said the Holy Spirit told me says called Danny and tell him he's been attacked by a spirit of witchcraft so now I had a Catholic tell me witches and I told my wife then I said you know I said you know she's a Catholic they're thinking in icons and statues and everything well there is real witches but I said also that rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and that's what was rising up in the church this spirit that don't believe in preachers and everything else and so when that brother told me that that it's a that's a spirit of witchcraft immediately the fear left me a one heal but the fear left me because I mend I knew what it was because you know I tell you in that time that that enemies are tagging like that that spirits coming and visiting you everything you ever done wrong is being brought throwed before you Satan's trying to drag every sin up from under the blood and tell you everything about you you're a failure you shouldn't be everything is being thrown before you and there's times you don't know it's way to move which way to go and I tell you the only thing you do in that time is stand still show your colors yeah yeah it's gonna be like that fella in Tombstone there that was buried less more said here's lies less more one bullet from a 44 no less no more that was gonna be Danny steaming right there in Sarasota hey so then the attacks kept coming the spirits kept rising but I had no fear in it and the Lord tells you how to win to deal with something and the spirit got so strong and listen as a pastor you you're understanding things rise up because they're after the Sheep or after the weak ones are there to kill them and so something had happened and I'm not going to go into the details that they tried to take a preeminence and and I was receiving these letters everything you know the Lord told me said don't say nothing don't reply so I never replied for about three months I never said nothing and that makes it devil really mad when you ignore him no matter in matter matter Christmas is that what proper English theron matter in matter in matter I don't really care and so then and then Christmas came which I told my church Jesus was not born on Christmas some of you don't know that I said Jesus wasn't born on Christmas but I was okay I was that's when I was born and it so happened that Sunday was Christmas and it was my birthday and the Lord told me preached this message and he told me to preach that the Bible is the absolute that the Prophet believed in not every the the the the Bible and the Lord told me to preach it and I preached it and then I preached it in three days it cleaned that spirit clean that spirit but you have to wait for the right client you can't just try to wear another man's coat and fight that battle so clean the spirit I wasn't healed but it cleaned that spirit out now if you've never went through time with your nerves and suffering like yeah I can't I can't I can sympathize with you but I can tell you this and tell you this it'll take everything from you if you let it so I begin to build my strength back but I wasn't healed but I began to build my strength back it is actually a year later I went and preached over in Europe again is a Romania at this youth camp that preached for about five or six straight years no one reason I'm not preaching it this years because my son's having a boy our child don't know what it's gonna be gonna have a child so you got to be there for your kids and and so uh and so I was there and it was very hot every day was about a hundred and two and is an open-air meeting had a roof but got very hot in there when we're we slept we didn't have no air or anything so you could sleep but you didn't rest so you just got weaker and weaker and weaker and weaker I'm only telling this to help you okay we're all men weaker and weaker and weaker and I preached Thursday night Friday morning Friday night Saturday morning in Saturday morning I said I'm going to continue what I'm going to preach setting my own preach at Saturday night and in between that that spirit hit me again hit me again I could feel that fear come back when that fear came all inspiration to preach was gone and I literally was walking to the pulpit brother Jack with no inspiration and that fear is oh man I was just like this walking just like I am I look at you look at you and I said Lord you got to help me I got to preach this and I don't have no inspiration and that fears back and that's all I said and I walked to the Pope when I preached didn't feel better the Lord helped the Lord help me and I preached the people responded sometimes you got to fake it and the people responded and the Lord back did I when I got done there was a young minister sitting over here couldn't speak couldn't speak English but he came up and spoke to the ministers and spoke to them and brother Gabriel who runs the camp and his son who's also a minister he asked again who was that brother and the brother taught him he is that's a that's a sincere brother and they came and talked to me says Danny entire time you preach there's a man stood right behind you and held your arms I am the only one that knew what I pre said a man stood behind you he was dressed in white he held your arm out some of you gonna leave me right here say all you're just talkin not know I'm just telling you I prayed angels the Lord at camp about those that fear and and and they God allowed that man to see it because it's That moment when I heard that I'm the only one that knew what I prayed it was in that moment God healed me and I have never been the same again fear is called the nerves are healed why because in that hour that you can't do it hey man he can do it that our aim in when death is coming he's there to touch you hey the same God that could touch Jacob context Danny can touch your life money you know as ministers you kind of want to present yourself as the strong one but there's times you got to present yourself as the weak one so that the weak ones can say hey ho God I need that same one to compound and touch me and if there's anybody in here that suffered with that I'd stand right now and receive your healing from the same angel that touched me because I'm telling you he is touched by the feeling of your infirmities he is the same yesterday today I think you can't figure out he's already figured it out hallelujah I gotta tell you I was embarrassed to talk about that I was embarrassed to give that testimony to anybody and I was really embarrassed to go say you know an angel held Danny up and they're gonna say yeah yeah we've heard this before here comes another man trying to say he was visited by an angel this is an angel of healing the first time I ever testified of it was in New Zealand probably eight months later and the Lord said tell that testimony and I told it and there's a girl stood up and you'll know who she is she's from America and her brother had just committed suicide in the Phoenix Church she's married to a boy there in New Zealand and she stood up and said if that same angel could touch him because the thing came upon her her brother's committed suicide that grief in them and they just couldn't be healed and it was in that moment God begin the process of healing in that girl there's nothing happens to you no matter how hard the struggle is there's nothing that happens to you that God will not turn it around it'll become healing in somebody else hit me brother Anderson all about your struggles are not in vain amen brother Jack all of your struggles are not in vain amen brother Aaron all your struggles are not in vain brothers none of your struggles are in vain he says I see every one of them I catch every tear in a bottle I want to pour it out on somebody else that it's going to be used for my glory you're not going to get the glory from it but I'm gonna get the glory and I want to tell you when I'm weak then he's strong and I can stand like Paul this morning and say His grace is sufficient we are born of an incorruptible seed with an incorruptible promise with an incorruptible faith I hope I didn't offend any of you don't go out and try to say brother days trying to make himself something special I'm Tony the hour I was here when I can look back say there it was and now I don't care if I don't even have nothing to say I'm not nervous about it anymore [Music] hallelujah I stand before you a healed man come brother Jack hey man if you can accept it you heal you right here right now the same God let him touch him you know why I told you that brother and sister I told you that because it wouldn't do you very good if I just tried to tell you that I'm brother Danny I had to tell you about my Jacob moments that'll get a hold of you that'll help you haul Jacob could say I can remember the hour he touched me I can remember the hour all fear was gone hallelujah my faithful God you understand you it's hard to grasp you understand that same God that touched Jacob is right here in this room right now he is a person don't let nothing come between you and him god bless you we love you with the love of the Lord amen praise the Lord I know the Lord used that to speak to somebody's heart my God speaks I think it's good for us to respond and I don't know if there's anybody here that's dealing with fear if you're dealing with any type of fear know that that did not come from God the Bible says that he does not give us the spirit of fear and and the other thing about spirit of fear that should let us know that fear is a spirit it is a spirit and invest something that you've been dealing with I want to tell you today you can be free from now don't let it just be a testimony but you can go free from that and why not be prayed for by somebody that's been delivered from it we're gonna sing this song again I want you all to just close your eyes and I

of who we are and we know that we're gonna go through battles who realize that but there's something on the inside of you that's just like God and let me ask you a question have you ever seen God defeated and if that God has dwelled on the inside of you you also will not be defeated you may go through some things but you won't be defeated so glad he gave us the promise that the gates of hell would not prevail then saying wouldn't come against us but it won't prevail hallelujah thank God for that and I'm just making it personal as he got towards the end I believe that was something to set somebody else free like he said God took his tears and fought him in a bottle then poured them out on somebody else to give you a refreshing God is a good God God is a good God service tonight will
