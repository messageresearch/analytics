understanding in Revelation silver various after Scott we realized special blood can't do it but I'm father in heaven propellant revelation our lives or that we're able to overcome it bless those that have arrived those are still on the way you've traveling mercies to those that are unable to be with us tonight will confront them and those that will join us online i'll be reading you would just blessed him as well in jesus thing we ask it amen amen praise or you can be seated just turn with me to Revelation chapter 2 let's just read our scriptures here tonight as we proceed forward and the studying the five tier in church age and looking at the session the sentence against the harlot and the sentence against the harlot here revelation 2 verse 18 the verse 18 says and unto the Angel of the Church and five tier write these things said the Sun God who hath his eyes like him to a flame of fire and his feet are like fine brass I know that word send charity and service faith and my patience and that works that lastly more than the first and when we went over that section brother Branham brought to our attention that just as believers good work should always come forth from believers but when you look at the scripture says I know that works in charity and service so we good works and good service should come from believers but if the works and the service is not done in love then it's not been received appropriately so as we serve the Lord we have to serve Him in love and love I know that works in charity service and faith my patience and my works and alas to be more than the first verse 20 says notwithstanding I have a few things against the again we've been talking about there are two churches that are identified here every time every age has a false church and a true church false violent of True Vine and when we looked at verse 19 he was actually talking to the true church but now when he when he brings out the rebuke then that's when he's talking to the foster to any time he's given a commendation or just something where he's shown appreciation is talking to the true believers but when he's given a rebuke he's talking to the false fire so here verse 20 notwithstanding I have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel we call it herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce My servants to commit fornication and in this sense of the word fornication is idle to commit fornication and to eat they'd sacrifice unto idols and I gave her space to repent of her fornication as she repented not I'm behold I would cast her into a bed and then that commits adultery with her into Great Tribulation except they repent of their deeds and this is where we're getting our subject tonight the sentence against the harlot the verse 23 says and I would kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts and I will give unto every one of you according to your works but unto you I say and I'm through the rest and five tier as many as have not this doctrine and which have not known the depths of Satan as they speak i will put upon you none other bird but that was that that which you have already hold fast till I come he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end to him when I get power over the nation's and he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of a Potter show that he broke in the shivers even as I received of my father and I will give him the morning star and he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches we're going to just kind of go forward here picked up where we left off on last week we just want to get right to the sentence against the harlot and will you have a little bit of reading that we want to do tonight from the scripture and I believe it would be helpful to us all right ok so we're focusing on this verse revelation 222 says behold I will cast her into a bed of them that commit adultery with or integrate tribulation except they repent of their deeds also the scripture says and I will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts and I would given to her every one of you according to your works let's just kind of look at a couple things here and think of what I'd like to do there was a quote that we read I'm the church age book with this this is on page 232 paragraph three in your church age foot and we'll just read that 232 paragraph three the Prophet says this this is at the end of the page there says uh what this woman has children and and she a if that is the case that she had children by her whoredoms then she must be burnt with fire as the word is saving like I brought to you all last week I just did a quick search on that as to what I felt for the brand I was referring to he didn't give the scripture reference but I just kind of felt that this was the scripture reference that was appropriate was executive 23 25 and if you had a chance to go back and read that you'll read about Jerusalem and Samaria his sisters that were committing a hoarder and verse 25 and actually talked about her being burnt with fire so I believe that's where brother branham's kind of bringing bringing that in it was representing you know the nation of Israel these two sisters Judah and Israel is representing them but here he says if that is the case that she had children by her hortons then she must be burnt with fire as the word has said that is exactly true that is her in for she will burn with fire her n is the lake of fire this is what the properties tell us that's the end of denominations a lot of people don't see that what they see at the beginning is that men they love me more they treat me better they they got more programs and what the message people got they they look at all of those things but they're not looking at the end lot looked at the plush Lance of Sodom and Gomorrah but he did not look at the end result of what we're going to happen to something do more because of the sin that was down there and unfortunately what we what we've done now is we've based our spiritual decisions on our feelings on our emotions don't ever do that church base your spiritual decisions on the Word of God a man that's the only thing that's not going to fill our emotions which change it changes like weather so the key here is that we got to look at what the end result denominational teaching will lead to tribulation that's just bottom line it does not have anything in it to get us ready for a rapture right it's going to lead to tribulation no matter how good the programs are it will lead us defibrillation anything organized is against God so we have to stay as far away from that and just stay with the word of God that's that's key important brother branham goes on the state is the stop and thing about these children for a moment a woman is the one out of whom the children come it is evident that this woman had children that came out of her but they did the same thing she did show me one church that ever came out of organization that didn't go right back into it there isn't one not one the Lutheran's came out and the organ and then organized right back and today they're there a hand in glove with this academic remove the methodist came out and they working I was right back the Pentecostals came out and they were organized right back there is going to be another coming out and praise God they won't organize back because they know the truth that group would be the bride of the last day I believe we are in the midst of fulfilling that statement even right now that group that this apart at another coming out but they won't go back they won't go back to organization because they know the truth that's he's talking to us thank God for that all right let's go on a little further here there were some key statements that we brought out last week here and I'll just kind of hit those again one thing here that brother branham brought I'll just go on organization is the product of the double correctors nickel Anton ism and Balaam ism and is propagated by the prophet of Jezebel and what we brought out on nickel activism and Valin ISM nickel Anton ISM is is the conquered lantee and you know there's many many churches out there that that's that's exactly what they've done is just completely conquered the laity the Catholic Church would have been the first one to start that off but there's there's many others I feel I know I'm not one particular denomination where the legatee is so subjective to the leadership is they have superintendent or bishop or somebody I don't know what the main title is but whatever decision that man makes maybe if he says at the when they go to their their conventions if he says I walked so and so at that church and I want this pastor the move I don't care how long that pastor been there he is moving right and and they just have complete control over over the congregation not allowing the Spirit of God and do anything most people I should feel like well if the bishop said it then the spirit must be leaving and they know it's political they know the thing is absolutely political but that that that spirit of nickel Anton ISM is there and God never intended for that to run his church never the other thing is Bailey mysm brother branham call this organization a product of the double corrupters oneness nicholas janis on the others bailey mysm and the beylin ism is go ahead and do it your way and what like i mentioned last week Baylen ism i think is even in the message now a lot of us look at this from you know maybe a woman preacher standpoint no matter how anointed she is God still never intended for going to preach that's not scripture you can't find that in the Bible but but nowadays in the message they're people like I said that believe a number of things they believe that that you don't need a fivefold ministry all right they believe that brother Brandon is there there pastor I don't see how that can be if God's called him home it can't be your pastor right he was your profit but he can't be a pastor right so there's a lot of these things that still that that stuff comes right on over into or people try to bring it over to the message but you know thank God we we go through stir Jake but we can fight against those things those are spirits that have tried to enter into the church and we have to stand against that brother Ramage that we have to withstand you know you know just just these things that kind of come in and it's and sometimes it's difficult you have to take a stand against some very dear people but you got to stay with the truth right you gotta stay the truth but here Bailey mysm is go ahead and do it your way even if it's against the word they gonna do it anyway right because that's what Balon did he heard God tell him no but he went down there anyway and did what he wanted to do and then he he suffer from that one of the scriptures that we read last week was Matthew 25 verse 1 through 13 and that's talking about the the wives versions and the foolish virgins and and you know as you just kind of go back and look at that the scripture withstand very clearly that they took lamps but they didn't take oil with them and then it's at later on that the wise actually took oil in their lamps and when you know the bridegroom came in the crock came the midnight cry came they rubbed a rose Nick trimmed their lamps and you know you see that the the fuel is foolish virgins went an extra watch they hate our lamps have run out you know so give us a vol that was a lie they lampstand run out they never actually took oil they never took it they've never had it in the first place and when brother branham said is that that all represented the Holy Spirit so actually they've never had it in the first place it might have looked like they had it but they did not have the Holy Ghost in the first place praise the Lord that's that's really what we get out of that but here he goes on another statement he may hear there's going to be another coming out praise God they want organized back because they know the truth we thank God for that and this one says the spirit left the Pentecostals because they organized that's that's important the reason that the Pentecost is not where it used to be where it started is because they organized and the spirit left and I'll share with you all how the the Pentecostal church was birthed at a snoozer street with william see more and i mean just a mighty move the Spirit of God but yet with all of that they could not stop the division from coming between the blacks and whites the whites went with assemblies of god and the blacks went with Church of God in Christ right they could not stop that division so there's something wrong they both organized they organize the Spirit of God left amen and we're seeing the results of that today also the Prophet says everyone but the very elect will be deceived everyone but the very elect would be deceived I was talking with some brothers and you know they were telling me that that they weren't gonna support my meetings because I had a particular person here speaking they weren't going to support my meetings because of that they felt that that person might I guess seduce the people and now and you know and I say what brother you know the Bible say that the very elect can be deceived you know that right and I oh yeah that's a good point that's a good point but still he was supported right and the person that I had is just no way they would deceive anybody they was related to the Prophet so you know it's just it's kind of sad that people get this way but that's one thing that I got confidence and even if you ended up in a church because you were visiting or something like that I mean I think we mature enough that if we went to net went to visit a relative and we went to church with them that you weren't getting there and getting saved in one surface I hope you mature enough right if you're not I don't know what the same right but I hope that I mean you know you know sometimes we do some strange things no I can't go to church with no I can't go to trick you can go to church you you know enough to pick a dick thing going in and shout raise your hand saying man or something you know brother branham TARDIS that you get a bone just push it to the side and keep eating meat right so we know these things and we should be able to exercise that way by now right I say we should be able to do that by now but um but I tell you don't one thing you can be you can register now don't don't get me wrong I don't think anybody should intentionally try to bring somebody to deceive right I don't think that's that's going to be intentional you know you learn your lesson sometimes some from some people we've had different ones come and praise God we learned a lesson a man there is no invitation going out right Stan we want you back that's not happening praise the Lord hey man one time that's buddy the church on this thing but but that's you know we're not going to intentionally do that but I tell you what if something happened to slip in a slip by the very leg will not be deceived will not that's a promise from from Almighty God one other scriptures and we're going to hit this tonight revelation 13 13 18 brother branham brought that out in our reading and we want to try to touch on that tonight here again we're talking about the sentence against the harlot and there is in this scripture here says I will cast her into a bed and then that commits adultery with her into Great Tribulation except they repent of their deeds always remember the woman is type in the church and Scripture jazzy Belle type in the church in Scripture jazzy Belle according to this particular passage was a woman that would not repent you know she indicated if you go back and look at what Jezebel did and in Bible History back in the days of King Ahab he was married to just gonna marry her for political purposes you know desi Bell introduced idolatry into the nation of Israel not only introduced idolatry but she was killing the prophets killing anybody that uh that was standing for you know the one true God she would she would try to wipe them out try to get rid of that influence and you know so so what we're seeing here is that same spirit came into the Catholic Church right and they began to kind of kill anybody live with not agree with their teachers and they also brought in idolatry and false false teachers into the church so that same spirit or not and when we say it to her the sentence against the harlot we talk about the children that came from the harlot or the Bible also calls a degree thatthat's those of people that those are churches that born out of the Catholic Church right so they might have come out but if they went right back into organization then like mother like daughter that's what we saw happening amen Lutheran's would be considered in that the Baptist would be considering that Pentecostals be considering that any private organizer went right back into that same system that came out of that's that's that's that's what we're talking about and I mentioned last week there was a time of my life I remember you got a bunch of preachers together you could always identify the Catholic priests always because he he's the only one that had that collar next thing you know you start seeing some of the Lutheran's and the Episcopalians do same thing and before you know it the Pentecost will start doing the exact same thing Methodist Baptist all they've got the same college man you can't tell if a Catholic or what you don't know what the difference is just by looking at right so it shows that they went right back into the same system that they came out of that's what those things show evident just even in the way that they dress it's evident brother branham said this and let me just see something here yeah I think there's a quote here that I'm going to a couple quotes that i'm going to read but says now there there was virgins that went out to meet him and the foolish virgins now did not have all in their lamp but they had everything else they were clean they believed in Christ they preached the word that they believe their dump that they believe their denomination would let them preach they preached that the second coming to sacrifice to atonement they believe they have all those core beliefs and we talked about that you have to call people Christians because they subscribe to certain Christian beliefs of three off the top of my head are Jesus died and rose again Jesus is the savior of all man you know all mankind he was born of a virgin you know everybody as Christians we all believe that but that you know still that we could make it be what we call Christians of the flesh but Christians the spirit don't believe all the words not just that they're gonna go with the entire work all right I want to read a quick quote to own this one yeah this is out of your church Jake's book as well page 2 30 3 paragraph 2 i'm going to just read to a certain point or a stop he says what would be the punishment of the harlot and her children well it's going to be twofold first he said I would cast her into a bed according to the last part of verse 22 it will be a bed of tribulation or the Great Tribulation that is exactly what Jesus said in Matthew 25 1 through 13 there were ten virgins five were wise and five were foolish to five wives have oil the Holy Spirit but the other five did not when the cry went up behold the bridegroom cometh the five foolish had to run seeking oil why the five wise virgins went into the marriage the five that remained outside were left to the Great Tribulation that is what will happen to all who do not go up in the rapture that is what will come upon the harlot and her daughters denominational teaching is going to lead people to a tribulation bottom line brother branham say wrapped in faith lies in the books and tapes that's where we find wrapped in faith so if a person not preaching from the books and tapes they will not get people ready for a rapture bottom line a man church I mean you know we have to just put it very plain like that of it if it's found in the books and tapes that's what we got to bring to the people to get them ready for a ratchet if that's not being presented it will lead people to tribulation here amen listen secondly it says that he will kill them with death or as a literal translation it says let them be put to death with death this is a strange thing we might say let a man be put to death by hanging or by electrocution or some other way but this says let them be put to death by death death itself is a cause of their death alright I'm going to skip down here to the next quote okay actually just that I just read that that's what that was in the slot all right let's go on to the next up the next slide here okay there's a pretty significant quote that I want to read on this one so again this it says I will kill her children with death and all all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts and I would give unto every one of you according to your works now that little picture that's up there in the top right corner just says Jezebel had a daughter and her name was a failure so when the scribd traction says that I will kill her children with death this is a direct type to Jezebel having a daughter and the Catholic Church having daughters write and direct comparison so when you look at up Jezebel with and that's I found that even just even when you look at it from from from the scripture the prophet Elijah had to deal with jazzy now Elijah dealt with jazzy Belle right he Liza which is a type of us Elijah would be representing brother branham's ministry but Elijah represents the bride Elijah had to deal with a failure Jezebel's door guess what that shows how we have to do with denominations right brother branham doe he dealt with the Catholic Church right at the root and even even dealt with the dumb denominations but we had to deal with it even a little bit more you know an hour day because we're seeing the fruit of what the Prophet talked about right here in our midst right so a failure if the Bible says that I will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts and I would give unto every one of you according to your works I wanted to I want you to just kind of go back and just remember that the weight of the failure died right you know there's a failure there was a time where her she action she wasn't even supposed to be the leader or the ruler her son was killed and when she found out that her son died she went and started killing all the king's sons and and anybody that was a threat to actually take over the throne she went to kill off all the king's sons there was one little boy that they hit he was a little baby at the time that was born and they hit him inside the church inside the temple and that what was hidden inside that temple for six years six years and you know the question be like well how come she didn't know that that boy was in the church I come see Luna what an answer is that she never went to church she was serving false gods so she was never in the church she was serving bail right so she was going to bells church but not going to the we're Jehovah's she wasn't there so here this boy was in the church six years in the seventh year they decided to the preset the time decided to you know introduce this point he got all the people i mean it kind of hit him away didn't even let the people know but in the seventh year he start bringing i think he kind of waited for the people to get frustrated with with a failure and maybe might might have start listening to some of their complaints and things like that and it's because sometimes you just gotta wait for people to get frustrated before you really get in there start talking to him alright but maybe wait for them to get frustrated so you know what I've got I'm going to show them something they didn't know that this would this exists there only a few people knew but imma show them say we got the we got a king here we've got to keep putting up with a failure and they pre probably total the story what happened with this board how he'd been raised in the temp all the Houston are we ready to bring them out and it was in this boy's seventh year seventh year that they were going to introduce him to the people they were going to anoint him as king and when they did that they're known him as can you become a failure running into the house of the garden lot of Bible say she she ripped her clothes in front of everybody and I think about that what type of lady is that that will rip her clothes in the house of God in front of all the men tell you something about her write it tell you a lot about her but she ripped a cruel to start yelling I treason treason treason well the the priesthood already said look whoever you know ever catches her take out the outside right outside the house I mean I outside the house of Lord and kill and make sure she she's killed a failure was was killed just like the Bible's props thought I would kill her children with death alright a failure was killed pulled out of the church and actually was killed by the people right and and anybody was following tell you they also were killed so the priests they went and got the free side of the temple they killed them to the ones that was serving veil but I you know the thing of it is is that I when I looked at that that that that boy the king's son that was inside the temple the king's son was inside the temple but as only when he turned seven years old that they actually unveiled him I looked at that because it's in the seventh church H right that Christ has been completely unveil even hot right but now we actually see its full glory in the seven church age we see the king's son has been openly revealed for some people that's been frustrated with denominational stuff thank God that we see completely who the king's son is in this seven churches his name is Jesus a man praise the Lord let me I got a quote here that I want to read with this this is the original thoughts here in church age brother branham speaks here see here scroll down this little bit is that slide 14 okay yeah right there slow scroll down just a little bit more for him please all right right in there okay the original church is there now she had children it's where we read from now she had children did the real Jezebel have children yes sir listen I'll kill a children what the Catholic Church her children is the Protestant denominations see it's exactly because they're doing the same thing baptized right into her by their freak baptism on the scripture baptism shaking hands for the Holy Ghost Father Son and Holy Ghost instead of the the Jesus Christ and just doing everything contrary to the Bible still and they walked right into it her daughter was called a failure ath al i8h she had her she Jezebel had a failure merit to jump jehoram the son of king of judah and soon the altars of Balaam was standing in Jerusalem now you don't have to go to the history for that that's Bible see her daughter Italian marriage Jehoshaphat son which was jehoram and her daughter did the same thing she did oh my can't you see it see how them organizations and when brother branch they are doing the same thing she did remember Jezebel kill the godly influence of her day and here you know that would have been a leadership well her daughter killed the people that were threat to her leadership right she she had him killed so she says her daughter did the same thing she did on my can't you see it see how the organization that dun dun brethren they come right back through Luther and them just exactly organize themselves to get instead of letting the Holy Ghost and Pentecost did the same exact thing exactly thing they couldn't just let the Holy Ghost go ahead and have its way and go ahead and every light come just examine it by the word and go on they couldn't let the Holy Spirit lead they had to make an organization and cut off from everything else that would come along went right straight back and married into the thing again just exactly when we get to that you just watch what's waiting for you down the road here see married right straight back in Jesus said here the jet this Jezebel she calls herself a prophetess and I'll throw her and a bed of worldliness and kill her children also what what kind with a death what it what kind of death is her children how to be killed with you see they're dead now spiritually that they have no revelation they know their organization they know their catechism they know their doctrine of the church but when it comes to knowing God some of them don't know no more about it than a Hottentot would know about an Egyptian night that's right when it comes to really knowing the Holy Spirit wondering wanting to call the Spirit of God a soothsayer a devil of the discerning spirits and things like that and casting out evil while he don't belong to our organization that group Oh bro see they don't they just don't know and then tag it with the name of Jesus only as some kind of holy roller some kind of thing like that just don't know and the hour is close at hand when that thing is going to be exposed that's exactly God will do it as certain as I'm standing behind this pulpit because he'll jerk his children out as certain as I'm standing right here God in heaven knows that you believe me to be a prophet of the Lord a servant of the Lord you listen to me she's close to ham yes sir I thank God for the promise that he's going to jerk these children out of that and there's many that or better still bound in those systems and we're going back to our slide bound in that but God's going to jerk him out thank God thank God for that many of us better sitting here tonight I've already been jerked out amen this just will go on here we got a couple more slides here so here he just tell us that she had children and did you realize that the real Jezebel have children yes sir listen I'll killer should know what the Catholic Church of children's of Protestants nomination so that's habited nomination out there alright so we want to kind of go here let's get our Bibles we're going to read revelation 13 brother branham made a comment here as he was bringing the scripture out and in the Turkish book he said this chapter when he's talking about revelation 13 said this chapter shows the power of the Roman Catholic Church and what she would do through organization remember this is the false bond let it name the name of the Lord it does so only in a lie revelation 13 he says is identifying the Roman Catholic Church and not only that revelation 13 identifies the United States of America and this even though you might not see the country's name but there are certain things that happen here in our country that's represented and many times brother branham would talk of how we started as a country with 13 stars and 13 stripes and we represented in Revelation chapter 13 so you know just um I mean something that we can look at here so let's pick this up first one says and I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of seeing when we talk about a beast we're talking about a power right a power having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and a friend of says the name of blasphemy and I can just tell you right now the name of blasphemy would be you know I'm Catholic well what about being Christian see because in the Bible said that it was an ante up that they first recognized the Christian but we get later on down the line and people all other Christians they're Catholic now again I'm not Baptist on Pentecost i'm this and that you know what about just being a Christian and Christian means to be christ-like right but Brandon ran into the lady in the end the hospital that is crannies and he's praying for one sick person is in memory mom we pray she said clothes like her shut it shut the curtain right now say ma'am you know we just Christians we just want to pray Sarah your Christmas a she's a Methodist I have you know I brought a candle every night like for him to count every night and got nothing to do it you being a Christian so you know but people people actually take on that name of their denomination and feel like just because they're underneath that name that their safety their know their safety is in Christ in Christ the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous run into that and are safe right so this name of blasphemy would be they were Catholic right they were Catholic so an upon his heads the name of blasphemy and the Beast which I saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and you already know that when a lion speaks everything else in the jungle just just pushes right that he's the king of the jungle so this this beast has the mouth of a lion when this beast talked this power talks everybody else just gonna listen listen and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great Authority the dragon gave it to him we're going to compare that and a little bit drab the dragon is found in Revelation 12 but in brother branham's that compare those two so we'll go back and pick up a little bit but notice the Bible say the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great Authority and I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the Beast and what that meant Spurs the headwater death it was the Roman Empire actually fail right the Roman Empire Imperial pagan Rome that fail but when it when it was heal it came back asked papal rome which papal road would be the Roman Catholic Church the religion still dominates the world but there was a one time at the Empire the Roman Empire their military dominated world but that fell but then the religion started dominating the world that's what this means I saw one of us is as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound is healed and all the world wondered after the Beast and they worshiped the dragon which gave power unto the Beast and they worshiped the Beast saying who is like unto the Beast who was able to make war with him and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months every three and a half years that's Tribulation Period alright and he opened his mouth and blasphemy against God to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle and then and then that dwell in heaven and it was given unto him to make war with the Saints and to overcome them and power was given him over all Kindred's and tongues and nations and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world If any man have an ear let him hear he that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword here is the patience and the faith of the saints verse 11 this is where we start talking about the United States and I beheld another beast another power coming up out of the earth and what that's representing that's when the United States was birth we came and you know the forefathers of this country came and they actually took over a land that was already existing they were people already living here the Indians were already living here so and says they they became a power that came up out of the earth right and and had two horns like a lamb and he spake like a spake as a dragon so for the random call that the civil and ecclesiastical power that they had those two horns represented civil and please ask of power verse 12 says he exercises all the power of the first beat for him and causeth the earth earth and then which dwell therein to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed and he do with great wonders so that he maketh Fire come down from heaven on earth in the sight of men and when brother branham brought that out my god think I was thinking to off a profit that scripture right there revelation 13 13 was with feel when the united states dropped the bomb on hiroshima when they dropped that bomb on hiroshima and there was another another bomb that they dropped on another city over there in japan but when they did that that's the fire that came down out of having that bomb right that's the fire that came down out of heaven and it made the whole earth wander right and and now because of some stuff they did back then now you got people threatening with all kind of the bumps you know that they'll drop right here in America so it says look into a great wonder so that he maketh Fire come down from heaven on the earth and the sight of men and to see with them that dwell in error by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beasts saying to them that dwell in earth that they should make an image to the Beast which had the wound I award and did live and he had power to give life unto the image of the Beast that the image of the Beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship worship the image of the Beast should be killed brother branham actually even spoke in one place that there will be hope that comes out of the United States there will be a pope that comes out of United States now I can only say what I what I kind of read this but it's not not anything brother Brandon said but I'm in the Catholic Church if i'm not mistaken they had a prophecy that they'd only have so many posts before Jesus would return and 4 i'm not mistaken i think they have one more pope after the current Pope and that's what to be the last one according to their prophecies now that's not anything brother branham said but that's according to their prophecies so there is a lot of things that could be fulfilled in a very short amount of time and we just got to be very very watchful of all of these things you know as there as there as you're approaching but here verse 16 says he causeth all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in the right hand or in their foreheads and let me just let me just make it clear don't go around looking for somebody with a 666 tattooed in their hand or on the hand don't look at that people got way too many tattoos for you to be able to find something like that that's not the way it's going to be but what brother brahim say is when they reject the word they have actually taken the mark of the beast when they reject the word they actually take the mark of the beast be careful right stay with the word listen it says verse 17 and that no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name here's the wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man there's numbers six hundred three score and six I've seen people just get completely just blown away through the first two had that thing the thing was uh if you they people that like direct deposit at first right they thought it's just you know to the system just too much against you and now there's one thing they have they don't want you to get a chip inside of you because you get a chip though you got the mark of the beast you know I can I know that's not the market abuse I can tell you that much you know I mean probably from there's probably some medical reasons why they might want to do that and just talk it over the adopter but that's not the mark of the beast the mark of the beast is when you reject the word right people just so afraid nowadays and you know they don't even know why or what they're afraid of right but thank God profit that we don't have to live in fear we know exactly what the things means so we can approach things saying a man as we prepare ourselves for a rapture so here in this brother branham said to compare revelation 13 1 through 4 with revelation 12 verse 1 through 5 and just start quickly reading that they said I stood up on the standard sea and saw a beast rise up by the sea I'm sorry says I stood upon the standard sea and saw a beast rise up by the sea having seven heads and ten horns of the front of horns ten crowns to find his head the name of blasphemy and the Beast which I saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear his mouth as the mouth of the lion and the dragon gave him power and his seat and great Authority and I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the Beast and they worshiped the dragon which gave power to the Beast and they worship the Beast saying who was like her to the Beast who was able to make war with him he said compare that with revelation 12 1 through 5 and it says here and there appeared a great wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the Sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars and she being with child cried travailing in birth and pained to be delivered there appeared another wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his head and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven but what the prophet said here i can't read all the quotes but when they said tell it's not like it had a big long tail tail really should have been tal eat which means his lie right his lie drew a third part of the stars of heaven and hit cast him to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which is ready to be delivered for the devour her child as soon as it was born and she brought forth a man child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and her children was caught up in to God and just drunk now I want to read a couple quotes here from the church age book as brother Branham just kind of kind of deals with this just for a little bit I'm on page 236 in your church age book that should be slide 15 I'm going to skip a little bit around on this but just to kind of bring a little more clarification behind what we read into some of the things that the prophet brought to us page 236 and at the top of the page it says that this chapter shows the power of the Roman Catholic Church and what she would do through organization that's again revelation 13 to six showing that it shows the power the Roman Catholic Church and what she would do through organization remember this is the false by and let it name the name of the Lord it does so only in a lie it's hit ship is not of the Lord but of Satan that finally ends up completely identified with the beasts the riding on the Scarlet beast distinct the shows our power is the god of a force which is Satan and not our God the Lord Jesus Christ all right it goes on to say this in verse 17 it emphatically shows that she will gain absolute control of the Commerce of the earth but no man can buy or sell apart from her this is borne out in Revelation 18 verse 9 through 17 which shows our involvement with the Kings princes merchants all of whom have to do do with Rome and commerce there's another statement program set one day we will go on the gold standard that our money won't be worth anything and the Catholics right now have all the gold so they will control the Commerce because it's a widow they'll force them to force us to the ghosts are now you should be noticing or have noticed over the past few years there have been a arms lot of people talking about we buy gold all its law everywhere you three buy gold we buy go they even have been der machines that sell in gold bars right they have all that now and and people trying to stock up on the goal because they realize that there's going to be a changed that church I am NOT I don't want us living in that type of fear right if it get that bad you know the profit at your toes that when the squeeze come watch the third pool watch the spoken worked right that's that's what we should be watching so you just need to understand these are things that are happening and the signs are right here before us all over the place amen sometimes it happens so often that we get accustomed to it we don't realize that the Word of God has been fulfilled right before our very eyes right but but but notice he told us that so we just need to be aware i'm here on page 236 paragraph 3 says in Revelation 13 14 we learned that the Beast spreads his influence through the image which was built for him the image that is made is a worldwide a communicant council wherein all the organizers churches would get together with the Roman Catholics they are doing it even now it is quite possible this union will come in order to stop the power of communism but since communism like Nebuchadnezzar has been raised up to burn the flesh of the harlot Rome will be overcome and destroyed take note that everywhere the Romish Church went communism follow it has to be that way and let me warn you now don't get don't get thinking communism is your only enemy no sir is the Catholic Church also and even more so all right he goes on and and and the next paragraph he's kind of telling them to compare a revelation 12 1 through 5 of Revelation 13 1 through 4 and those scriptures are listed in annex paragraph but I'm skipping over the page 237 towards the of the middle of that first paragraph you'll see a sentence that says satan and his satanic religion and he's after we read those scriptures of Revelation 13 1 through 4 and revelation 12 1 through 5 he says Satan and a satanic religion are in both of these beasts in Revelation 14 the Beast that was wounded unto death but lived again is Imperial pagan Rome that failed to the onslaught of the barbarians and thereby lost her temporal power but she regained it in capital Rome do you see it the nation that ruled by crushing all and which became the strongest Empire ever known was finally wounded to death her power was gone physically as to control by armies etc but under Constantine she came back to life for papal rome has infiltrated the whole world and her power is absolute she uses kings and merchants and in her deadly interdental irreligious and financial stress she is governing as the goddess of this present age she is also the dragon that stood waiting to about to devour the manchild Herot tried to kill the Lord Jesus and fell later Jesus was crucified by Roman soldiers but now it's caught up to the throne so you know brother Branham just kind of bringing out you know what happened there and when we read revelation 13 we read revelation 12 that beast that power is the Roman Catholic Church that's the Roman Catholic Church and and again when we read their how they they had a deadly wound it's talking about how they went from being a pope I mean a physical power now it's a spiritual power by being the church papal rome that's what we get there okay let's go on to our next slide here there is something else that brother Brandon brings out and we'll be finishing up shortly here it brings out something and I think I'm going to want to read this in a second Aly out of your Bible will turn the dang it too but he brings out the Eisenhower and Khrushchev that's des who was there and they're represented in Daniels vision and what he saw at the end time there's a statement made here by Khrushchev brother branham quotes it out of the message discerning the body of the Lord since I believe today many of you all heard what Khrushchev said the other day to the Americans says you read it in your papers here's a statement you who've got natural discernment you'll catch this he said if there is a God he's going to sweep the temple and clean it with you with your money changing your money changer capitalists so as you see what that means don't she says and he's right a he than a devil and imposter like that has to throw the threats out steal their sleep sinning drinking just ignored because they have no spiritual discernment of the body Lord what a day we're living in now he goes I'm over your church age book on page 237 I just want to read a couple quotes and then we'll go pick this up out of Daniel 2 and just a couple more slides after that and we'll be done for tonight my lord church you know the Prophet bringing these things out even in and when what what happened there with Khrushchev banging that shoe there was like a United Nations meeting and Khrushchev was representing five western nations where eyes and I was representing five eastern nations all right but let's just brother branham says it here in church age but let's just pick this up page 237 paragraph one says now along with that I have just said recall the vision of Daniel the last part of the image the last world power work the last world power was in the feet this is Daniel's image the last word power was in the feet that was iron and clay the iron is the Roman Empire but now it's no longer solid iron clay is mixed in it yet it is there and running world affairs in both the democratic nations and the more despotic ones or what we mean dictatorships right the despotic ones the Romish Church is in every nation it is mixed up in it all look at this let me give you a little something on the iron and clay remember when Khrushchev beat a shoe on the desk at the UN well there were five Eastern nations there in five western Khrushchev spoke for the east and President Eisenhower for the West in Russian Khrushchev is clean and Eisenhower means iron the two main leaders of the world the two big toes of the feet of iron and clay were side by side we are in the end of it all now that happened years ago brother branham's identifying church we are in the end time let's pick up Daniels vision here and Daniel chapter 2 just read that really quickly and then we'll just a few more slides around let it go for tonight but just trying to just you know get us to see how close we are all of this gotta be in all of this got to be filled day of 2 i'm at verse 31 this was a vision Nebuchadnezzar had had a big problem he was ready to kill everybody that could you know that couldn't tell him what his dream was a dream left him and he wanted somebody to come tell him Danny was only one in the kingdom at that time that can come tell him what it meant my god might got my god i believe the prada be the only ones to be able to kind of tell p for what these things mean in this out I tell you what a fifth a theological point of view ain't gon settlements people are going to be revelation a man and the bride gonna have the revelation because the bride's been listening to the voice of god through the prophet of God right bringing the truth of God you know if I were to just stop right here and just ask a question and I and I and I I would actually ask I want you to give me feedback imma ask and I want you to actually give me feedback and not just blood blurted out I want to just raise your hand can you tell me why God sent a prophet anybody can raise your hand and tell me why God sent from anybody here to do that yes sir thank you anybody else want to say why why God sent a problem yes so before judgment it says a warning to turn hearts of children back to the father's which is aces all of those answers are right all those answers are right searched we don't understand why the Prophet King we would actually think that this message is an alternative to denominations that's not what this is this was restoring truth right I mean truth it was messed up if people can't see that the church world is messed up I don't know what they look at that right but it was messed up you all you ever just go visit some churches sometimes see what's going on inside those I mean it's not even church anymore when brother branham call it a large that's what it came in I've told you about the church I went to we you know we gotta look have the little stinkers many but they got invited I'm like okay let's take them on down here I get any people that I'm dim the lights this bar right here cross this that was that lights hanging up there when we came here right took me took them things down I don't know what they were doing them life it's not no club this is the church right but you know hit a dim the lights are like what kind of what is going on here Lord it was it was a shame before God to see some stuff I said once we get out of here would never be back never church we needed a prophet to bring truth to us otherwise we'd be right out there doing the exact same thing that everybody else is doing thank God for truth truth we needed truth the Bible say you'll know the truth and the truth will make you free so God had to send a prophet with truth that was the main purpose don't don't ever forget that and the job was not to try to turn our hearts toward him it was a turn-on hearts back towards God ain't now praise the Lord let's read data to verse 31 vowel King sauce this is daniel interpreting the dream for the king is telling what what uh what he saw thou king saw us and behold a great image the great image whose brightness was excellent stood before the end the end the form thereof with terrible this images had fine go I could tell y'all see when God used this gift in Daniels life he gave the King couldn't see that became forgotten dream but God gave the dream back to Daniel as a property and showed him exactly what the King saw so he went and told told him exactly you know there was times people came to brother Branham and shared a dream and he would actually say hey you forgot to sell this part because God would show him the dream and if he's shooting a dream he could also show them the interpretation we're not playing games with this right this dis was genuine God and the reason God uses life and such and such a magnitude and so that we can see the hand of God on his life listen to what the man is trying to tell you because I'm with him a man listen the images had was a fine goal is breast in his arms of silver is belied his thighs of brass his legs of iron his feet part of iron and part of clay as we brother Brown was just bringing out his feet part of iron and part of clay thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands which smote the image upon his feet that work with that were iron and clay and break them to pieces see that stone is representing Christ then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broke into pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth this is the dream and and we will tell the interpretation there before the King Thou O king are the king of of kings for the God of heaven have given the aquila power and strength and glory verse 38 and wheresoever the children of men's well the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heavens happy given into thine hand and have made the ruler over them all thou art this head of goals Daniel is actually interpreting the dream for King Nebuchadnezzar verse 39 and after these shall arise another Kingdom inferior to thee and another third kingdom of brass which shall bear rule over all the earth and the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron that was the Roman Empire right there right there the the four kingdoms would have been the Babylonians that's Nebuchadnezzar and then at the battle that the Babylonians dim came the Medes and Persians right the Medes and Persians they came next and then after that would have been Alexander the Great right bringing in the Grecian kingdom and then the final fourth kingdom would have been the Roman Empire all right so that's what we're seeing here says and the fourth kingdom shall be as strong as iron for as much as iron breaketh in pieces and subdue with all things and as iron that breaketh all these shellack breaking visas and brews and whereas down sauce two feet and toes part of potters clay and part of iron the kingdom shall be divided but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron for as much as that got sauce the iron mixed with the mire clean for the brand of again just pointed out that they're divided you got communism on one side and then you got you know democracy on another side all right but still the Catholic Church's invented and all an act no matter where the Catholic Church is still deeply and better than all of that and as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken and where's da sauce iron mixed with miry clay they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men but they shall not cleave one to another events iron is not mixed with clay and in the days of these Kings show that God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall beat and it's just an forever for as much as down stars that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that and break in pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver and the gold the Great God hath made known to the king what shall come to you're after and the dream is certain and the interpretation thereof sure Daniel's just kind of identifying tell them what the dream was tell them what the interpretation is and then brother Brandon brings even more clarity let us see even in the days of Eisenhower being king I'm President Khrushchev been a leader of Russia showing how even their names tied into this image that Daniel had so church we we just don't have much longer we don't have much longer let's go a little further we got a couple more slides here we'll be done revelation 13 fours they said they worshiped the dragon which gave power to the beast and they worship the Beast saying who is like unto the Beast who's able to make war with him and what we have here brother Branham says this now there are at present some great names in the world there are some mighty nations for right now says right now Rome is calling the tool there's a great names in the world that's the mighty nations but Rome is called the tomb the Pope is in the driver's seat and his power is going to increase no one can war against him that's what the Prophet tells us right amen listen revelation 13 6 13 6 said they opened his mouth and blasphemy against God to blast through his name and it's tabernacle and then that dwell in the heaven and the Prophet said this he says teaching for doctrines the commandments of men heady high-minded having a form of godliness and denying the power thereof heat blasting the name of God changing that name to titles and refusing to do otherwise so when he took baptizing baptism in the name of Lord Jesus Christ just father son Holy Ghost he took that away and all the other churches follow right down that path it's very few tie still holding on to baptism name Lord Jesus Christ but though the Catholic Church took that away refuse refuse to repent or refuse to go back just last slide here brother branham says this the scripture actually says my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me that's John 1027 the prophet said an authoritarian church age he says thank God for the sheep that will not worship Him everyone but the very leg would be deceived but they will not be deceived for they hear the Shepherd's voice and they follow him he said this also in the 34 he said now then see this what we've been trying to show you they see the death that started in the first age the seed of organization has finally grown into the tree in which every fowl bird is lodged now that tree in which every file bird is launched can be found by the brand of the scripture he's actually quoting scripture that's found in Revelation 18 to Revelation 18 2 i'm a read this quote and if y'all just give me just just a few minutes I want to read just a few verses out of Revelation 18 will close for the night but I just want to just drop this in mine listen he says it says has finally grown into the tree in which every fowl bird is large and spite of her claims that she is the giver of life she is the giver of death her fruit is death they that partake of her dad this mighty World Church system that fools the world that in and her is physical and spiritual salvation to seasonal destroys the multitudes but not only is she death personified but this dad carry on this debt carry on creature will be itself put to death with death which is the lake of fire oh that men would perceive what their end will be by remaining in her notice this come out of her for why will you that turn with me to Revelation 18 just a couple verses and will close for tonight you just go to the last 5 implemented ago revelation 18 says this verse 1 and after this thing I saw another angel come down from heaven having great power and the earth was lightened with his glory light and with his glory and he cried Miley with a strong voice and Babylon the Great is fallen is fallen and if I could just dispel that verse said the earth was lightened with his glory how many times of brother branham go around the earth preach the gospel seven times the earth was lightened with his glory seven is God's number of completion right seven times he went around this earth preaching the gospel the country the various countries that heard the gospel they had an opportunity here it's influenced just about every nation right here the descriptions being fulfilled it's not something that we waiting to be fulfilled its operated been for you listen verse 2 says and he cried mightily with the strong voice saying Babylon the Great is fallen is fallen and has become a habitation of devils and the and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies and this is verse 4 and I heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins that you receive not of her plagues brother branham's ministry is the ministry that called us out of denominational system denominational system is represented as one of the the children of the harlot or the great court we got called out of that and God used an angel I angel messenger to call us out of that it's already been fulfilled search please don't take it lightly thank God we came to this truth and don't let nobody take me I'll let nobody take you from all right next week we'll be reading pages 238 through 242 in our church age book and we will start talking about the final warning a five-tier the promise as well as the reward for for that age the final warn the promise and the reward that'll be found on pages 238 through 242 let's bow our heads for a word of Prayer and it closed out tonight father we thank you but it's time to study the word God this is a serious out you've already sent a prophet to reveal truth and got here we have the truth in our hands but God is up to us down a hole too distant to do everything we can to cherish you watch over to defend it even the scripture tells us that the lamb hat horn seven horns that was a seven Church agents that were defending the word so God that vests our responsibility a lot of people trying to fool here and pull they're all kind of stuff floating all over the internet but God we're standing with this word because we know the purpose of why you sent us a profit it's not being off just to be something different that's not what this message is about but God we need a truth and you brought that to us in all the way that you revealed truth the Bible tells that surely the Lord God will do nothing until he reveal his secrets to service the prophets and God that'sthat's that's your word you won't break it for anybody so that's what you did and we're grateful for that so god help us Lord to take what we have heard here tonight the Lord and it just to be able to share it with others to be able to apply it we don't want to just be head knowledge but we want to be something or we can kept helping some lights if they're walking in darkness you get glory and honor out of our time together tonight in Jesus name we pray praise the Lord will prepare for tonight sometimes an offer just
