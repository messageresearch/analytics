one of his eyes and he came back to tell us that you know we're just so glad to hear hear great news you know from what the Lord has done and I'll tell you what we are we are looking forward to God completing the work a man looking forward to God completing that work so Amen let's just if we could let's let's read here from Matthew 16 again a man praise the Lord and I'll start reading at verse 13 I believe and it says that says this says when Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi he acts his disciples saying who do men say that I the Son of Man am they said some say that thou art John the Baptist some Elijah the others Jeremiah or one of the prophets who saith unto them but whom say ye that I am then Simon Peter answered and said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God jesus answered obscenity and blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood have not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell should not prevail against it and I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and what summer house shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven then charge he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ a man the Lord and a blessing to the reading of his word let's just pray a man over this probably thank you for this opportunity to read the word of the Lord but God we are asking now that you would take what we have read and Lord make it clear reveal God and only way that you can to our hearts on today we're trusting Lord Jesus that as you told Peter it's that flesh and blood have not revealed this unto you but my father in heaven has and and and we said the gates of hell would not prevail against that revelation so father help us to receive that on today there's some Jesus name that we pray a man than a man god bless you you can be seated a man glory to God boy so I want to continue our thought we started down this journey last week a bit installed a spiritual revelation a man and and I will continue a man in that channel there is some there is a number of things that are here in the scripture that I pray that the Lord will give me the opportunity to get to I don't know if it'll happen today but we're just gonna keep going a man to see where see what the Lord takes us as I was ending on last week just bringing us back to some recognition of you know a tremendous thing that just happened here in our land and our nation and that is the passing of Billy Graham a man at ninety nine years old he he passed away and realizing that his ministry was very impactful a ministry that went to all nations you know he was a tremendous man of God tremendous man of God used by God for a very specific work right and you know with with the ministry that that that that's able to I mean with I mean able to kind of hit all nations we talked about before the internet right we talked about before Facebook life right we've talked about before you don't Instagram or any of those other things that we might use to try to or YouTube or whatever any any of that you know happened this man's ministry had impacted the world he was on television and all kind of things you know he had he had a very unique calling on his life and and and we take our hats off to this man of God hallelujah then we take our hats off to this great man of God and and they're very appreciative of it but but but but but with spiritual revelation a man we have the opportunity to see something a little bit more than what the average person has seen a man and one of those things is that the Bible tells us that as it was in the days of life so shall it be in the coming of the Son of Man and when we look at that through prophetic lenses right a man we can see that when Abraham had visitors and when these three visitors showed up to Abraham the house Abraham said my lord he did not say my lord she said my lord now two visits has showed up to Lots house and he said my lord right I mean he'll he had to and he saw Lord Abraham had three and he saw one and it's spiritual revelation help us that we all see Father Son and Holy Ghost as three different people these three are one so you know these types are there but just as a Billy I mean Abraham had those visitors two of the Angels went down into Sodom and there their ministry was to try to pull a man the pull some believers out I can't call them electives it's hard for me to call him that right but believers nomina believers there was their job to pull him out because see the elected was not down in there they left it was up where Abraham was at right getting it having a conversation with God Himself talking about what was getting ready to happen if I could just if I could just interject that there's some things that a kid hitter to happen now that Billy Graham has been called off the scene I'm trying to give you some spiritual revelation of some things that are getting ready to happen now if you want to get all tied up and take it up in the thing this world that's your barakatuh that I'm trying to get ready is somebody I'm trying to get ready for shot go in a car see so you know as we as we just look at these things a man just a little bit more closer hopefully we're kind of catch some spiritual revelation now I read this quote for you at the end of the sermon on last week and I'm picking it up again and I'm going to go forward from there a man if the Lord would allow us to this is not approving this word and I'm just going directly to paragraph 204 a man improving his word the Prophet tells us something here says never has there been a messenger that ever went to the entire church a man with his name ending with H a.m. till now gr aah am Billy Graham he says there has been moody's veni sancte nots Luther and so forth but never a H am father to nations I thought you his ministry when I went all over the world father tenacious now remember he is I wish I could have underlined match now remember not now he's saying that for a reason right now remember he is gr a HAF six letters just love the way to hold his beer do that right he remember he is gr aham six letters but a PR 8 is seven letters notice they're down there Billy Graham going into all the parts of the world and coming out of Sodom come out Lee the wrath that is to come there is no man that I know of in the field that has got ahold of God on that one of gentrification like Billy Graham does he can present it he's not a theologian I guess he's a theologian but he's not just a powerful teacher but God is with him that man will stand there with like a Sunday School lesson hold those people spellbound he's God's servant of the hour Tolu the church natural that's in Sodom now here's a circum he is a messenger but to him to the church natural that's in Sodom Oh glory to God and we know Church natural is in Sodom they got silent preachers preaching to him we know church that was in Sodom huh Amen all you got to look around seals through who's in the Christ and I'll tell my years ago when I was coming up my mama had to watch my mama had to go to Senate gotta go to cuantos to Whitney because she had the watch the musician oh I ain't telling my mother truth you have a watch the musician mom Augusta come across or if you keep an eye on the musician that is charged Sodom and yet they are having church on television and everything else but Church Sodom listen Adam I'm going I'm trying to go further he says God's everybody out to church church natural that's in Sodom but remember there was one church spiritual that wasn't in that denominational outfit I have a called out group and they received a message also and a messenger and what was it there's learned the thoughts that was in the heart God always proves his word now look at how he just lived that in there he said gr aham six letters he said remember that if you say remember gr aham six letters how God used this ministry you said but that was the church natural but there's another message Church spiritual and they weren't inside you don't see no you can't see the flickering of the wrists around here a man glory to God you're not expected and no and no and no no leadership position who you gonna lead you need to be delivered first and unfortunate wretch Sodom don't even believe they need to be delivered I hate the call names I hate to be up here calling names but Nani also have another tour name is ik none of it none of it that man don't even believe you need to be delivered but a preacher in the pulpit took of his daddy Church Church Sodom hallelujah a man I'm trying to get y'all to see some things now now now you notice he say he say there was gr aham six letters he say just remember that but he's never even put he never even told y'all what the other messenger was with H a.m. at the end of his name he's standing there preaching and you had to catch him he knew his name if you just picked up the flier picked up the flight in the end of meeting just picked it up you would have saw his nameless BR and the here in Los Angeles California when he say these words he's there and notice nine his name is BR AM H a.m. seven letters now he never said it but you had to catch it because God was using these ministries for very specific work one is to get a prior ready for the rapture and another's just gotta get them out of how to wait everything in maybe they're gonna go through tribulation that's all I think say they gotta make it they'll make it through the tribulation but I'm not going through the tribulation I'm going in a rapture hallelujah let me just go a little just a little further you know with with these things I mean I'm trying to give the church to see you know we we all church but we really not we all say we love the law but we really don't it's two different groups it's always been that way a man is in it and it's always gonna be that way you'll get confused when you're looking at these groups you don't know which one is right and with one wrong go with the one that stand with the words hey man they're not trying to appease your flesh hey I mean we're trying to get people ready to go meet God listen so the probably told us that there was two phases of Christianity now y'all stay with me I got it I gotta try to get into something here today say yeah to two thirds Christianity say one of them is an intellectual mental conception but what God has said in his word and of Jesus Christ by the way of knowledge right the other is an experimental experience that God has given the man in his heart see that's why when you come talkin to me nonsense about God did not send a prophet it's been revealed in my heart some of y'all God gave dreams to you if you because she didn't give a dream that God gave me I'm standing on that God showed me nobody showed you so you gotta have your own revelation this is why Jesus would speak to the disciples he said man say that hottest selling meat in there was a good question and they gave a group answer some Elias some say that Jeremiah some say that are willing to profits some say this and some say that that me may hurt but everybody else was saying but the question change the question turn and he looked at the mine in the eyes he looked at him in the eyes and said well who say that I had a son of man in can you imagine maybe just I can see that the wind just stopped the fellas maybe want to stop breathing now we can tell what other people say but now you make the same personal this thing becoming a personal you got to have your own individual revelation you can tell everyone this one say you can't grab it at that and say you gotta have your own personal experience with God has he revealed himself to you because no man can even tell Jesus the Christ walked by a revelation from the Holy Ghost he said I'm shifting now I know what they say I got that it's all over the internet it's all over internet what they say but I'm asking you now who do you say that I the Son of Man am this just you can see get quiet everybody looking at each other kind of like what everybody's doing son is glasses a question be like just answer the question brother Jack don't get me now I gotta get so I'm just trying to make sure you understand I ask the questions if you understand hey man sometimes y'all help me y'all give me insight all right open up your mouth Jesus and you cos Jesus one gonna let him out of it either you know how sometimes you asked if you ever been in a job interview and you ask the question and somebody like that's a good question let me come back to that way we don't come back to it you ain't leaving this interview without answering the question I asked the question who do you say that I the Son of Man in now that was an individual question to individual disciples and each one had to give an individual answer nobody say nothing nobody say nothing and all of a sudden the guy pipes up now now now you got to understand the guy that pipes up has a name and names actually means something his name happened to be Peter which meant little stone it says it says you want to know who what I think well I say thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God oh that Jesus didn't wait for nobody else answer he just looked at Peter blessed art thou simon barjona and notice you say this flesh and blood and give this to you but my father in heaven has dropped down this revelation they saying the gates of Hell will not prevail against the revelation that you're standing on I got to move on Oh Lord Jesus Oh God the place where that occurred the place where that happened the place where where Jesus would speak these these powerful words to Peter it was very significant you see when I went to when I went to Israel we went to accessory a Philip I that's the name of this place that Jesus takes them you know to and he's that it's like a 30 mile walk put them to get here and when they get there in this place this is actually a place where there's a lot of idol worship happening okay and if I could just if you just bear with because the idol worship and one of the gods that they served was a guy by the name of pan or pond or something like that apan but but this this this this God that they served was half goat and half man so in this place where there's just it's just full of I and I'm talking about it was it was it was some idolatry last week I was pretty pretty bowl with y'all and telling y'all what happened to lot and his daughters in the book of Genesis 19 and if you go back and read it you'll see that there was a lot happen and there was a lot of sin in the land in the days of lots a lot of sin before before God came down and actually pull them out there was so much sin before God destroyed he he sent His angels down to investigate he said man is way to myself the sin of homosexuality that is sin right and I like I told y'all last week you know where all of that with them even getting a messenger to come and get them take them out of the house I don't know if I just my question is if it was you and they told you it's time to leave right now we've gone destroy the city by the time the Sun come up in mourning this city gonna be on the y'all need to get out now before the structure come what would you put in your suitcase if it was you what would you carry out of the city because what they carried out was liquor bottles it showed you what was going on in the house live a into the refrigerator and in the refrigerator the daddy has some licking yeah and they took the liquor out rather than anything else I don't know what else they got but I've known at least got liquor because they got me that a drunk and had relations with their own daddy and had children from them that's the Bible that's the Bible and you might see a man that is sick it's happening every day in this land every day and and it's because people not being told that a man is the truth about glory to God can't send your kids to school because the teachers might get them huh I mean it used to be we respected those positions but now you don't know who will do what to your child they end up at the truth right but but we got spirits now now now now in the land where Jesus said these great works you say say say flesh and blood have not revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven type of Dentistry right there in that spot there was some terrible sin taking place now and the Bible speaks against these things but you know I just did some history you know they they worship they worship ghosts they worship goats and and and and they had all types of oh my it was filth things that they would do with goats fill where Jesus was telling these people that flesh and blood have not revealed this to you but my father in heaven has jesus said that it was very strategic for him to stand in that spot where these people sacrificed goats worship goats and do all kind of other things with goats I got children here so I'm trying to be very you know really between the lies they did all kind of stuff wit go but Jesus stands here and in the midst of all this sin and say flesh and blood have not revealed this to you but my father in heaven half is sent upon this rock I'll build my church now you know when I when I looked at that because if you would if you would follow a man that the the train of thought you know after Jesus leaves this and he goes on there's a Matthew 17 where there was the Mount Transfiguration experience when you after going to Israel seeing how far away that was from each other and they didn't have vehicles like we have they walked see how far it was if I'm like man what did they talk about on the way from from Caesarea Philippi I'll to get them out transfiguration said because that was a pretty long well what kind of things are they talk about along this journey right so you know I just look at it and there was some a great great thing happened at Mount Transfiguration when said this is my beloved son hear ye him and then the disciples begin to get a little confused like not wait a minute before these things happen ain't Elijah's above the first come and restore all things oh my god y'all be a big bear with me right here cuz we got some spiritual revelations Garrett of the rock and you say yeah I said here Elijah Elijah is supposed to come and restore all things but I think you alive this already come said now revelation hit them severe Elijah's for the first come but he's already come say now oh and the Bible say then they caught it that he was talking about John the Baptist stay with me here John the Baptist was coming amen when he said telling about this have already come he was identified John the Baptist's ministry but when you say restore all things he was not talking about John the Baptist no the one that say has come already was term the Baptist but restore things was a future coming and recently I was just listening to a quote I didn't bring here but it's in I believe it might be in the fifth seal or something like that what brother bottom saying if a person it's going to apply John the Baptist ministry to the restoration of the restoration of all things then you have to deny the ministry of Jesus Christ if a person applies gentleman Baptist minister to the restoration of all things then you did not the Ministry of Jesus Christ that's the brother Jack how do you do that I want to tell you if John the Baptist restored all things then John the Baptist would have been restoring long Jesus brought Grace and if John the Baptist would have restored on things he would restore law which would have did not the work in the Ministry of Jesus Christ so you cannot put John the Baptist in that place there was a picture word for future time and that was William Branham VRA in H am seven letters are you with me see we came to know Christ in his work when he stood there in that place that day instead flesh and blood have not revealed this them to you but my father in heaven has revealed this do you realize that these people offer ghosts not only not only that that place they called it the literal place this place s abated philip i the literal name of the place was called the gates of hell the literal name and the reason that they call it the gates of hell because they felt like water who was the way that they got to the entrance to hell they felt like you have to go through water they were sacrificed different animals in the water you know try to bring their God out of the water all this happened in this little place my god now why would Jesus be there in that place it hit me that here in this place of all this pagan worship in them and they have a god that's half goat and half man well we have a God that only a tongue on the day of atonement what was required of the priests is that he would sacrifice two goats one goat would have to suffer for that for the cause of you know the people but they would take the blood of the one go and then put it on the other goats and the other goal would have to bear it out into the wilderness oh my god and what brother branham told us is that Jesus represented both goats so here these people worshipping a god that's half don't happen that but not realizing who was in their myths he was very strategic about where he went and not only where he went what he said where he went and do you know I mean these people thought they had the keys to to hell by going through this missile passageway their access to real philipot but he tells Peter I give you the keys to the to the kingdom this was a powerful something that happened in Jesus ministry oh I hope I'm blown about it man I'm I'm not trying to do that everything was a strategic y'all everything was strategic and you got to be able to catch spiritual revelation because even even that scripture has created a lot of problems in the church because they say well if Jesus said upon this rock I'll build my church they say well the rock was that spot right there that he was building up no that didn't am nothing to do with it then appeared in the the Catholic came on saying oh he built this church on Peter unstable man like you do do you realize it in Matthew 16 the same Peter that was told blessed art thou simon barjona flesh the blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father in heaven has revealed it to you know the Saint Peter just a few verses later Saint Peter was told get behind me Satan the same one bless it not get behind me Satan it just goes to show how things can change real quick it's a st. Peter so God did not build his church on a man like that but what he built the church on is the revelation of who Jesus works and the churches feel built on that same revelation you must know who he is today and how he's working if you don't catch how he's working today you're gonna miss a lot you're just gonna be going to church and just going through the motion but you don't really miss what God is really doing in this out alright stay with me stay with me already got alright when lot receive these two angels we're typing Billy Graham and we're taking Taipan Oral Roberts ministry to the ones that went down to Lots group a man pulling them out preaching the gospel blinding their eyes with the preacher of the gospel but there was one that stayed back with Abraham's group didn't didn't go down the side of that and I believe we're part of Church spiritual which is Abraham's group you know there was something that happened and this is what I'm looking forward to this is out of Jehovah Jireh and man Jehovah Jireh let me just kind of go forward the Lord would allows either the message Jehovah Jireh says to notice Abraham and Sarah they went back to about 22 or 25 years old so now just just so that you understand what just happened there there was a body change after the Angels come on the scene and left Sodom there was a body change that occurred with Abraham and Sarah hallelujah and in order for your body to defy gravity you're gonna have to also have a body change and so if once the Angels leave destruction sets in well I know there's judgment that's setting in for the world but I'm also expecting a change of the body for the bride I'm expecting a rapture for the brides hallelujah glory to God it says listen oh you say for the Branum all right now sit still just a minute now let's just read between the last ones immediately after those angels left and silent was burned Abraham and Sarah took a long journey plumbed down to garage that's quite a journey for an old couple measure it on your map they went down to gerak and here's Sarah now grandma ninety years old a little Sun bonnet on shaking and Abraham with his long beard hanging down the Bible said they were both well stricken in age don't try to say they live longer and the Bible said their bodies were both poor stricken in age and here they go down to Quran and there's a young king down there named Abimelech and he was looking for a sweetheart and when he saw Sarah he fell in love with her is that right grandma a young king looking for a knife and fell a little bit grandma everywhere I could I couldn't get a young man to do that today he goes sister right here brother this is my grandma I mean he just kind of try to be just my little bit like her brother Jeff wait I'm talking about a wife brother I'm talk about a wife you know ain't no way brother brother Jack no please brother hallelujah Oh God well we got grandma's run out these young men like that well we got grandma's doing now she you know she you know she come on you shouldn't even be trying to mess up nobody's life let that young man enjoy his life with somebody you come on we got grandma's messing up young people's like we got granddaddy's doing the same thing come on y'all this the truth anyhow granddad granddad come on man come on I wish somebody would I had a brother gentleman at one time say brother what if I came here instead this brother said the Lord showed him the Lord showed him the Lord showed him in and he wants to he wants to get married to you at your daughter the Lord showed him I say if the Lord ain't show me I'm sorry I'm not going with what the Lord showed him Gaga tha's show that to me too I will not give my daughter somebody like that granddaddy you older to me I got some pretty hot standards I'm letting you know but that one's that one that that is a absolute no yeah I might as well just put me in the earth right now and then you can take her but long as I got breath of my body no grandma our granddaddy hey man I'm just I just got to be honest hey man you don't live your life let them live there's now a man Church I don't know how I got there but the the fact of the matter is is that their bodies had changed in order for the king to be attracted to grandma her body had gone through a transition a transformation let me tell you something your body is also about to go through a transition a transformation if you are a believer because after the angel leaves destruction sets in but before destruction and Abraham's group rapture Oh Gloria all right just try I'm just trying to help us understand how close we are you know we get so wrapped up in the things of this world that we don't really we don't stop you know some time to realize that closest thing is you know a man lower to God I mean we don't we don't hit March and some of y'all thinking about March Madness that's all you got on your mind I'm talk about a rapture rapture right if you don't know it don't worry brother no excellent body don't don't accident no excellent don't because they might be that spirit don't ask them let me go on to read something here I'm going back to the revelation of Jesus Christ out of church age book and Oh Lord Jesus I'm gonna just start here in paragraph 13 for I read this last week and I'm gonna try to slip a couple things in here and i'ma i'ma let y'all go if y'all were just there with me I read this last week but I want to read it again the importance of revelation by the spirit to a true believer can never be overemphasized revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize now I'm not talking about this book of Revelation in you I'm talking about all revelation it is tremendously important to the church do you remember in Matthew 16 where Jesus acts of disciples this question who do men say that I the Son of Man a.m. and they sent some say that thou art John the Baptist some Elias and others Jeremias or one of the is he setting in but who you think that I am Simon Peter answered and said thou art the crisis under Living God and jesus answered instead I'm him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and I said to thee that thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it the Roman Catholics say the church is built upon Peter now that is really carnal how could God build a church upon a man so unstable that he denied the Lord Jesus and curse while doing it hey man Christians don't curse if you find that you have a Christian that's person and they say they love Jesus tell them they need to go back to the altar Christian's don't curse I don't care how bad the situation get Christian's don't curse actually Christians just holiday Tom David ain't gon curse mm-hmm all right listen how could God build a church upon us the man so unstable that he adopt denied the Lord Jesus and cursed while doing it God can't deal his church upon any man born in sin and it wasn't some rock lying there as though God had allowed the ground Hallet the ground at that spot and it isn't as the Protestants say that the church is built upon Jesus it was the revelation read it the way it's written flesh and blood have not revealed it but my father hath revealed it in a pump this rock revelation I will build my church the church is built on Revelation on thus saith the Lord Alleluia says how did Abel know what to do in order to offer proper sacrifice for God by faith he received the revelation of the blood Cain didn't get such a revelation even though he had a commandment he had a commandment to worship so he couldn't offer the right sacrifice it was a revelation from God that made the differs in gave Abel eternal life now you might take what the pastor says or what the seminary teachers and and though it might be taught to you with eloquence until God reveals to you that Jesus is the Christ and that it is the blood that cleanses you and that God is your Savior you will never have eternal life is the spiritual revelation that does it now you know he brought up Cain and Abel and if you go back in your Bible and you see that both of them were going to church they were both worshiping they were both bringing their best to God they weren't I mean there's a statement here brother Branham said Cain was a believer gotta get it Cain born of the serpent was a believer Cain was a believer he said he wasn't a communist nor an infidel he was a church-going ritualistic gentleman church-going ritualistic gentleman but he didn't stop his comments there he said Annie was lost he had all that going for him and he still is lost see they offered this sacrifice and this is what you know you can go to church you can see a lot of folks doing this and doing that for the Lord all these great things that they're doing for God and you know for people but they can still be lost that's why it's not about the great things that we do right it's about really having Revelation in your heart as to who Christ is right now and when you got that revelation then do something about that hey man didn't do some great things but without the revelation you're doing a lot you just you just astounding the brass and tinkling cymbals Atlantis of truth gonna have but Cain and Abel a man came with bring his offering of the ground and Abel would bring his offering of a lamb God accepted Abel's offering but he rejected Kings offer and it was both to sear and what they were presenting to God as they were coming all of them come with worship I mean both of them coming with a man with sincerity both of them just coming to try to offer got their best but God rejects women accepts the other now and he even told Cain he said look if you just give me the same thing your brother giving me I will accept it I'll take it from you if you can give me just go get him and kill him and bring her here I'll take it but it not in Cana be able to do that his attitude was taken or leave it and you know what that stumpy buy attitude today take it or leave it guess what I'm leaving it right but here your King comes with that attitude and it got so bad and I get jealous of his brother's offering and the first murder and the Bible happened over worship worship produced the first murder just think about it Church this is this is much deeper the problem that we have in this in the world a man is much deeper than gun violence and stuff like that it's a condition of the heart it's a condition of the heart right and let me let me just I mean I don't know if I can get it all this but but let me tell you people can trick you people can make it seem like they Christians people can't I mean man well III can tell you do this and do that and do this and do that and you can do everything that I asked you to do but if that thing and coming from the heart somewhere down the line you don't stop doing everything I told you to do because it was not an experience in the heart it was in the head he was in the head people can do it all day long but God knows what's in your heart Judas didn't do this to the Judas Judas was so so so so swaggy he was handling the money now you know you can trust a man with the money but jesus knew all along this man in God but you know what Jesus did he kept working with him got all the way down to Washington feet sitting there watching this feeds into don't know different than the rest um i'ma watch this P time I watch this P time watch it come on do this let me wash your feet and then they say you know they start taking communion is they now somebody gonna betray me yeah 12:12 real small church somebody about about their training well which one is it Lord say to one I'm I'm a stop with what we all stopping you never reveal who it was but it may be whispered a little something do this here that what you do do quickly why would you say something like that to me Judas knew he had already in a set of the skin feeling I already made this thing you know this thing was planned before that might even happen he knew exactly before it even happened this thing was already planted not what you're gonna do good to go do it quickly just go ahead get it over with what Judas come back when I've told you other sub miracles just don't matter you come back and they come back with a sores and Jesus nothing with y'all this time why y'all come get me you know well no you know and they got sneaking around at night oh lord help us Jesus with that one a lot of folks sneak around at night a lot of stuff happening at night when the Sun go down sneaking around hallelujah somebody but here hear that you know they come in trying to whisk them away and and and Peter said not long what you want to do you want us to fight and didn't wait financing took the Swart BAM shot that man here off and here Jesus reaches down put yours up picks the man here put it back on said couldn't y'all take me away I told y'all if that was me on the job I would have quit that day this man just saved my life and I'm gonna take him to Pilate no pilot better come get him this stuff Cain and Abel they were both offering sacrifices but one was spiritual one was Colonel right you can look at Balaam and Moses this is I mean I told you that this these two churches the two Spears have been there all alone Balaam and Moses who fundamentally Balaam and Balak were offering the same offerings and sacrifices that the children of Israel were offering right brother Branham said it had and the Bible even say they had seven altars seven Rams which spoke of the first coming of the Lord Jesus Christ this had seven bullets which represented a clean sacrifice and when you go back and you look at the Bible a man and just pick up that story in scripture when Balaam goes approach God aptly said of the office say Lord I got my seven altars I got my seven I got my seven bullets everything you asked for I have given you and do you know the Bible say that God spoke to Valen the Bible accessed a God honored it and God spoke back to him what I'm trying to tell you can go to church and you you will feel this period of gone to some of these places yet the genuine spirit of God you will feel it but if they often work they still off the word I'm not going to church for a feeling I'm not going to church for emotion I'm going to church to get my soul right with God Balaam and Moses you also have a man the false church in the true Church of Revelation 2 and 3 you have all of these things but it takes the revelation takes spiritual revelation for you to understand which group you you're part of let me read this other quote here and I want to just kind of share something I want to share Scripture after this amen and I'm gonna give you a little test of spiritual revelation is that Alright okay this is that a revelation of Jesus Christ paragraph 16 - so that as I have already said this book revelation is the consummation of the scriptures it is even placed exactly right in the Canon of Scripture at the end now you can know why it says that anyone who reads or even hears it is blessed it is the revelation of God that will give you authority over the devil I want to say that again it is the revelation of God that will give you a thority over the devil and you can see why they who add or take away from it would be curse it would have to be so for who can add or take away from the perfect from the perfect revelation of God and overcome the enemy right you can't you can't play around with the Word of God Jesus overcame with the word you can have to take that same word and overcome the enemy since it is that simple there is nothing of such prevailing power as the revelation of the word see and verse 3 a blessing is pronounced on those who give special attention to this book I think this refers to the Old Testament custom of the priest reading the word to the congregation in the morning you see many could not read so the priests had to reads to them as long because as it was the word blessing was there it didn't matter if it was red or hurt all right now he says nothing of such prevalent power as revelation of the word now just real quick I'm moving on from that quote see prevail means to wrestle with and overcome prevail means to wrestle with and overcome and sometimes what we find is that people will present different thoughts on scriptures to you and it'll cause you to wrestle right it'll cause you to wrestle now it won't one particular instance a man we I was talking with somebody about the two witnesses of Revelation 11 and at the time that we got into the conversation I didn't have all my ducks in a row all right but but I knew that the Prophet that shared these things I knew what he said so I knew you know there's two witnesses of revelation 11 a man was both Moses and he lives I knew that much right but but when they begin to present their argument to me they gave me they said Enoch any logic and and and the reason behind it safe because Enoch never died any larger never thought but but the scripture says after the death of my servant Moses so they begin the counter reason with that and and as they begin the rinsing I know the Bible say after the death of my Stern Moses all I can tell him at that time is that but you can't prove me where Moses died even even though that the devil's asking where his body is right I say you can't prove me where that I've known the fiber say that purpose I said but Moses didn't got Moses did not because Moses was there with Elijah on Mount Transfiguration let's say it's something else it's something else there so we just sitting there going back and forth they say no it's got to be eating like I said I can't no it's not it's not it's not that's not that's not there as I said that's waiting just waiting just waiting we talked about revelation 11 and then I say now pull up revelation 11 verse 6 greville at revelation 11 verse 6 I'm sitting and we just rest them with it we rested them with it right and and after that you know because sometimes when you when you when you're waiting on God let me tell you this when you when you got something in your heart that you need God to reveal sometimes you gotta wait on God to bring it to you you gotta wait some time it might be years before he actually gives you to understand the day but you got to learn how to win now look at this revelation 11 6 now I didn't I just knew this I caught it by revelations now Jefferson say these have power to shut heaven that it rain not in the days of their prophecy and has power over waters to turn them to blood and to smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will now even though it does not have the name Moses and Elijah there in that scripture the way that we know it's Moses and Elijah is because their ministries are represented it was he larger they have power to shut heaven that it rain not in the days of his prophecy it was Moses that had power over the waters to turn them into blood and to smite the earth with all plagues as often as she would Moses and Elijah their manes of my favorite spiritual revelation it helps you to see who they are their ministries are their catch it by spiritual revelation so you give you you wrestle with something now this person just brought a real good point up to me now I don't know about this I don't know about that now I'm going somewhere with this because there's a lot of good points out on the internet but if you don't have spirit revelation you just be public for anything oh my and I don't told you before you can't be traveling you can't be trying to answer everybody that's not your position somebody be done twisted you up Ede was trying to answer the serpent he got to twist it up he got he got a completely twisted even Paul sent a void run from it leave it alone foolish questions look like a coward when it comes to foolish questions Amen Church all right that's not your position glory to God amen and see every time today I'm just trying to help them no no no no they got something up their sleeve and you keep on threading out in the waters and you're not gave them points Onegin agree with you yet how many more points you gotta give them alright y'all stay with me I'm going somewhere I'm almost I'm almost there I'm gonna get you out of them powerful words that for the deep sea I'm close to closing everybody wake up and I say I was closing I'm close to it that hot closes close we'll figure that out spiritual revelation is powerful spiritual revelation is what the church is built on there was a man you know as I'm wrestling with you know gentlemen I'm just kind of talking him about the three gods versus one God it's not three gods they can't beat three gods the Father the Son the Holy Ghost are the same person it's one God in three offices it's just like me I am a pastor I am a father I am a son right I got all these titles that a man that go with go with my name but my name is jacked up praise the Lord right all right but don't make me three different people because I got three different titles no I'm the same person just operating in those titles at different times that's what happen with the Father Son the Holy Ghost now the same guy operating in three different offices at different times but we don't have three gods we don't believe in three cups Lord our God is one God that's what the Bible say so I was talking this man and and he is there now he went back to the beginning the revelry I mean Genesis 1 and when I say let us make man in our own image and the action any questions say they say is God schizophrenic they said cuz they say he's saying let us make man out on him because if you trying to tell me God was talking to himself as he so freely now I'm like wait a minute now I know God ain't no schizophrenic God is God so I was just kind of waiting on it waiting on it waiting on it and I was sitting a little text here and there and then one day I happen to be reading the scripture Nehemiah 5 7 can you pull that up from a near my 7 me and my 5 7 now I approached it from his angle because he acts was God's gets a pretty it because God he said God talking to himself let us make man in our own well I ran across the scripture that states then I consulted with myself Nehemiah Nehemiah saying then I consulted with myself and I rebuked the nobles and the rulers and said unto them ye exact Ussery every one of his brother and I said a great assembly against him I said now if Nehemiah could talk to his self and you could say a lamb and if God did talked himself you ought to still be able to say man if Nehemiah could do it why can't God do it but spiritual ever revelation go well beyond that I'm just working with him on this level trying to make him deduce that what he's standing on is not not nothing to stand on spiritual revelation took us a little further and what the prophet told this when you want to when you want the answer to let us make man in our own image it was God talking to the angels a spiritual revelation took us on a journey where we found out if God was talking to the angels then we got to go back in Scripture and find where angels are men will go back and Daniel the man Gabriel right it was it was it was in steps since day it was a man that talked to his father and his mother it was a man right hallelujah and if I could just go a little further bring it all the way up to the day God had seven angels in his hand and every one of those angels happen to be a man so if God was talking to a minute and it's talking to angels and they were in the image of men then that would be exactly right we'd be made in the image God was a man - that's why we saw him in in the book of as Melchizedek was something in the book of Genesis when it came in Jesus Christ it was God as a man right Moses saw the backside of a man a church it's all in the Bible I'm just just give me a spiritual revelation hallelujah can I go a little further I want to read this I want to read this I want y'all to get Genesis 5 we're gonna read this and let me read just read one long yeah let me read a quote here the fifth seal but get Genesis 5 in your Bible I'm gonna read something like that and y'all might have to get your calculators out and everything for us to understand this one because this is gonna be a little tough Genesis 5 but let me read a quote out of the fifth seal before we bring this to a close Genesis 5 it says this and in this message the fifth seal says and you see God is so great so he can humble himself a place still a human being can't climb down that far see that's all and in there and they're trying to find him now look they're trying to find him by sending the boys to school and getting a bachelor part in degree and they're trying to find find it by a theological terminology of the Bible and they're trying to find him by educational programs and by organizational programs and by beautifying things trying to find he's not there at all you just fighting a win you're getting away from it if they could be big enough to be simple enough they could find him in that direction by being simple but as long as you're going towards wisdom you're going away from him now let me get that to you so you won't miss it as long as you're trying to find God by wisdom like it was in the Garden of Eden like it was in the days of Moses like it was in the days of Noah like it's been in the days of Christ in the days of German in the days of the Apostles enter this day when you try to figure it out and try to find God by wisdom you're going further away from them all the time you're trying to understand it there's no way of doing it just accept it so you just believe it don't try to understand it now I'm gonna give you up something that people trying to understand oh don't yes I got to read this other quote to set this picture up it's something trying to understand bear with me this is not a great coming revival and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and the devil trying to arrest me but I'm gonna take my time because I'm gonna drop our bomb on the devil I don't want y'all to miss it and if y'all do miss it if you slept on it go back to the team it's on the internet you can watch the service listen look at this the great coming reviving the outpouring of whole spirit now notice this now this quote that I'm about to read as a quota has come into question because people are trying to understand it rather than just accept it and believe it the great coming revival if I thought I'd write it down type in 54 - zero seven one eight a and the packraft number is e - 20 okay look at this says now as I've just said that the antediluvian destruction Noah was the sign and Noah had a sign to start on when he seen Enoch was taken up he not was taken then Noah was time for nor to start for he knew that that would be the sign of his beginning and then the end would be near and Enoch of course was a type of the rapture group of the church and nor the type of the carried over or the length of the Jews that would be cared through the tribulation period and we're now living in that day see that angels left us see we're living in that day where we can expect the rapture now right now here we're going back because as it was in the days of Noah so shall there be in the coming of the son of man now brother Branham is saying that I need y'all to catch this alright because he said here as when when he's seen Enoch was taken up Noah but it's time to know where to start on the ark when Noah seen Enoch was taken up it was time for Nora to start on the earth now I'm gonna prove to y'all by scripture that Noah did not see Enoch I'm gonna prove it to you by Scripture open up your Bible I'm gonna prove to you this morning that Noah did not see Enoch so yeah looking at me like where in the world pastor going since hang that with me just for a little bit no I mean this is Jim says 5 verse 21 and enoch lived sixty and five years and begat methuselah and Enoch walked with God after he begat methuselah three hundred years and begat sons and daughters and all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years which represents our 365 day calendar okay Enoch was the Bible says in verse 24 and Enoch walked with God which was a rapture he not walk with God and he was not for God took him he not representing the bride that was ready for a rapture okay he not walk with God and he was not for God took him and Methuselah lived a hundred eighty of seven years and he begat lamech and Methuselah lived after he begat lamech seven hundred eighty and two years and begat sons and daughters and all the days of Methuselah were 969 years and he died and then go on and land and lame and and Lamech lived in hundred and eighty-two years and begot a son and he called his his dog named Noah saying this saying that this same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands because of the ground which the LORD hath cursed now I did some calculations I pulled out my calculator and I found that the Bible told us that Enoch lived sixty-five years before he forgot he begat his first child and that was Methuselah Methuselah would have lived a hundred and eighty-seven years before he begat his first child which would have been lame aunt Lynette lived a hundred and eighty two years before he forgot his first child which was no one now we calculate this see five plus 187 plus 182 equal 434 years but we just was told that Enoch walked with God at three hundred and sixty-five years so you have to subtract 365 from 434 and you get 69 years that's missing so it was that but that also it tells us that Enoch was gone 69 years before Noah came on the scene but the quotes in it that Enoch I mean that Noah saw Enoch and when he saw Enoch leave he knew it was time for him to get working on the art but Enoch was gone 69 years before Noah came on the scene are you with me so we were just reading the Bible was true how can eat knock I mean how could Noah seee not leaf huh is the profit wrong here and we find something wrong with the message huh huh revelation that's the only way it could be by spiritual revelation my question to you let me hold on I got some questions how with Noah see Enoch if Enoch had walked with God six nine years before Noah was born right the only way I wrote this down brothers like them tapped into it the only way Noah was a prophet and he would have to catch it by spiritual revelation I just want you to imagine this when guys when brothers are a man or whatever went for a walk back in them days not just a walk when they went to go visit somebody right it might be days you know that the wise men took two years two years that they were away from their home two years to get to Christ we don't know how long it took for them to get back home the Bible don't tell us that but two years just to get from where they was to get to Christ went where the star was it took two years so when they won't it took a lot longer back in those times a man can live on or on a walker own attorney might not make it back home for years I want you to think about that might not make him out back over years now when Enoch does not show up for years who was it that put out a missing persons report did his wife know that he was gone did his children know that he was gone did the church know that he was going how did they know that Enoch walked with God Lord I'm talking about I'm sure I'm sure but now I'm talked about before this was written how did they know I know how you know but I'm asking how did they know spiritual revelation you know what you read in your Bible but I just read their Genesis you know who wrote that you know who wrote it Moses had it Moses know how could he tell us that Enoch walked with God how did Moses know that how how can he put the year on it and all these other thing spiritual revelation drive down and show Moses what to write about email and a spiritual relation that shorts of Moses then spiritual relation consults and no one is relation with this our revelation flesh and blood don't reveal this to you but my father in heaven he revealed it to you and upon this rock the rock of spiritual revelation I will build my church and I don't care who pulling away and who doing listen who got isn't who doing Annie I don't care the Bible say the gates of Hell will not prevail I'm standing on the rock of spiritual revelation the prophet went wrong see a prophet can tell you what another prophet is seeing and only a prophet can do that you put your put your calculator out you might as well throw it away you missing 69 years but in God's mind him years don't mean nothing God allowed North if not maybe they was asking now your great-great Grandaddy he just never seen them again don't know what happened to him we don't know but God would have to reveal it oh wait he people just don't short missing but maybe God let him catch a vision he walk with God and I care in my home and Noah with that revelation knew that it was time to get busy to work on art I'm trying to give you all a revelation I'm trying to give you all a revelation that second angel has left he's gone it's time to get busy yeah that's what it's all about it's time to get busy all this other stuff is nonsense it's nonsense it's not gonna be in heaven a lot of stuff that we consider important here will not be in heaven I was so glad brother Troy sent that quote to the brothers group and talked about even have we put out put our work some time before God and we think that's it a good excuse you know you can have it you can have an excuse and you can also have a good excuse and some of us think that our good excuse is I got Church I mean I got work I got school I got this I got that but my question is do you have God cuz you know what he always seem to get the short end of the stick and then he get told you understand I understand that you got other gods before me and what I said it don't put nothing else before me the most important thing you can do is have a relationship with God I'm not talk about the Sunday morning relationship we have any time these church doors over the else to try to be here hey man praise the Lord and if you can't be here we've streamed the service on Wednesday night we streaming you can get on now I'm not talking I get on for 1 or 2 minutes and get off just to act like you is all God CEO day get on and get attached get into this word Church this is more important to you than anything I'm just being honest with you we don't have that much longer when when when those two angels left the land and that day destruction was immediate there's just I don't know what's gonna happen here y'all can see you know we ain't got a necessarily worried about somebody coming from the outside dropping a bomb we got kids in school with access to this type of stuff any public place you go to what was that Batman what was that movie everybody went out to see Batman and there was a there was a Batman in there all right and not a throw out what's this new movie that I keep hearing everybody talk about Black Panther and everybody wanna what Conda there's a time you didn't go to movies you know that's the truth there was a time the Holy Spirit that with you you were not then the movies I don't care who was doing what you didn't go now the devil just pulling us right on that but it used to be a time where you know we can go to move it but we had it at home waiting on waiting for the red box couldn't wait for it to hit the box bringing it home I actually all this question some of these Louise Madeline I don't go to movies I don't do it I don't even look up the reviews on movies but I know most of it used to be a time when I was when they say it pg-13 that's what they really meant not pg-13 is Kirsten violets some sexual scenes that's what I thought that's what it's all about and you wonder where you get that less beer from it's what you what's your feet known and why you can't overcome lust you feed on this stuff right I mean you know now they blaming video games for why Gaza rising up killing people like the video games they what they plan on a video game is doing that to their mind they don't see nothing wrong with killing somebody Church we got that we got to watch ourselves this we ain't got time to get caught up in the Black Panther wait we got time for it I mean you know I I'm not gonna know what Conda I'm going up yonder and all them people you talking that way you can gave them no scripture yet nothing nothing I mean Church yet we get caught up in the wrong stuff and let me tell you something after this from downtown they got another one coming and if they can't get you there with the Black Panther they gonna put a movie out there bout Jesus or something in the Bible they gonna have something to bring you bring you to the movie theater and you'll be justified with that Coppola brother branham with a seat yeah he went to see Moses what else you looking at come on church I'm just I'm just trying to tell you if y'all want to keep it hang on wrestled with you about it you can have it like lot and his wife they wanted that the angel that I have it but I'm trying to get out of here and I ain't negotiating with God what God could I just take this video with me can I put this in the pack a lot it's nonsense we need to fall in love with Jesus let's pray [Music] God is gonna take more you're certainly calling for it but that spiritual revelation we gonna miss what you're doing this out of the Prophet told us that we'll sit right here in this church it'll go right through so we won't even know it Lord I don't want to be that way I don't want to miss that I wanna be so caught up in the things of this world that I miss it that's that's not what it's all about God the Satan this has so many distractions so many things that he has to offer to try to pull our attention this way and pull our attention that way but lord I help me to keep my eyes my heart centered on you lord I want to love you more than I ever have before I want to serve you I want to live for you help me God to surrender my thoughts surrender my wheels surrender my way this world is not my home as I'm looking here the sign that's before Billy Graham being laid to rest on Friday pass your prophet told us that that man's ministry meant something it meant a lot to the church nominal and they might not even realize how you're known at that man's ministry all over the world he was well known all over the world but most people probably have no idea why you're known at that man with such a simple message of repentance but how you're anointed Hemnes to preachers and even presidents leaders of countries with will find themselves seeking out his counsel what a man but now that he's gone help us to turn our attention our Father to what you're doing in this hour don't let these things don't let him come through somebody not realizing don't help but lord help us got to get our eyes that like the song said earlier turn your eyes of Jesus look full in his wonderful face the things of this earth will grow strangely dim in the light of his glory in Greece [Music] got my sky as my sincere
