cross speak to your people in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen glory to God [Applause] marks the fourth chapter I won't hold you long how you standing long them have some scripture reading but I'll get to this real quick so you can take your seats and a man we cannot see what the Lord I've got to say a man tell you what we're living in a wonderful time man hey man keep me in the prayers amen Ford when I started the first verse mark 4 and he began again to teach by the seaside and there was gathered unto him a great multitude so that he entered into a ship and he sat in the sea and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land and he taught them saying many things by parables and said unto them in his doctrine hearken behold there went out a soul to soul and it came to pass as he sold some fell by the way side and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up and some fell on stony ground where it had not much earth and immediately it sprang up because it had no death of Earth but when the Sun was up it was scorched and because it had no root it withered away and some fell among thorns and thistles and grew up and choked it out and it yielded no fruit and the other fell on good ground and did yield fruit that sprang up and increase and brought forth some 30 some 60 in some hundred men left middle add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated Amen if I had to title this message I was like the title may be down a little bit still got that ringing brother good ground simply good grind Amen we we realized that our bodies they men our flesh is made up of elements a man that come from the earth and we see that that this earthly Tabernacle that we have a man that uh that was the soul of the sea was talking about this earth a man that see that I've had to take good ground in in your earth we used to sing their song backwards that day uh we have to break up their fallow ground sometime when you're beginning to farm land you have to go out and you have to pick a spot a good spot to start your garden and you have to go out and put forth - look man you were labeled by going out and taking up all of the weeds and removing all of the bad things and you to break the ground up you have to get that ground prepared to receive see a man so when you go and you plant the seed and then you water it you didn't you wait for the seed to come forth they man now we see here that that we're living in a day where where where we can sense the prophet of God likened us to sheep likened us to sheep and one thing that he said was she has doesn't make they don't they're not like other animals they're different from other animals most animals have a really keen sense of smell and they smell their prey and things of that nature and that's this is how they hunt because they have the smell and the smell but a lamb doesn't have those that knows those qualities but see what a lamb does have his lamb has a sense say about him that he can just sits when death is around Deacon's he has something about him that there's all of a sudden or the Prophet was telling a story about how to lion or was sneaking up on me lamb in the lamb he could have smelled a lion he didn't know what a lion was coming from but he said death was near a man and and and the Prophet like in Buster's sheep and we can look at the times that we're living in and we can look at the things around us and we can recognize where there's a something going on on the inside that we sits at the end it's near amen the true sheep can have there's something going on that they can sense that wait a minute something something is going on here at the time time is winding up we can sense amen that desert there's a hurry-up about us it may be consistent there's where there's sense of an emergency because because we can feel me inside about watching amen are the things that are going on around us and with the word we can see that the end is drawing none amen and or one of the things he heard me says it's time that happens amen a lot of people would say this message is full of things like do's and don'ts yeah I'm gonna come to preach this morning a bunch of do's and don'ts amen but what I did come to do is a tip to stir up your righteous mind Amen so that you can be a well a mandate the time is drawing to an end amen let's see all I'm trying to do is to get you to see that the end is drawing near trying to get you to see that the time that meant that we're living in the time that we are in it's an urgent time I mean even to some of us have been around a while and have we've seen over the years we could we've seen the change we see the degradation of mankind everything it in an only 50 in my short 50 years we could see the degradation of mankind we can see that that when I was a young man there's certain things that we we don't see them that we see now there's there's no way that that when I was coming up and my grandmother would take me to church some of the things that we see amongst churches are weird see this day they may not - recently we went to to another little church or any of you would be called tersh with your shoulders out we told you come out it's just less than four what in the world is wrong with people that they would come to the house of God dressed in such a man a man and you can see that people are just totally lost and they're totally blind but seeing what happened is their spiritual amnesia they have a sickness and the prophet brought out that in this spiritual amnesia sometimes he said there's three ways you get it sometime it's from shock amen sometime it's from worry you see worry has no virtue to see and you can worry yourself into a spiritual amnesia and to a signature to you lose who you up through worry you know and the other thing the Prophet Brody said when you get haunted between two opinions spiritual sickness a disease called amnesia well you don't know who you are anymore you know you can be sitting there talking to know who you're talking to anymore what a sad and pathetic state to be near to where you just lose all sense of who you are you lose your memories of all of the things that you went to that made you the person that you are you are just in inner inner inner state of delusion don't know who you are don't know where you came from if you don't know who you are and you don't know where you came from there's no way you could know where you're going there's no way you can know where you're going and this isn't either is a disease that so many have today we see a man that uh that uh that this call this disease is caused by being halt between two opinions a man y'all bear with me now we want to we want to take a look that the Bible says a man in Amos a man the third chapter wealth should be familiar with it as some of us are that it says that surely the Lord would not do nothing till he reveal his secrets to his servants the prophets and one of the things is that people we find that they're not even expecting looking for seeking a prophet we talked about here in this scripture that there was one that went and sold to Steve seeds and I want to just skip on I say that that seed a man is the word of God that seed that is planted in you from the foundation of the world a man is predestinated placed in you for the whole night now here is to come to life in the age that you're living in what an intelligence that see planted into your earth that will come to life in that time when the women went that word Amen for that time that you're living in amen when it recognizes the true Word of God amen that we're talking about the rain amen in the Sun that the waters that that that causes that sea to produce a man so when we look at matter we look at of Eve we wanted to look take a look at he Eve cameras know night night now the first prophet the first prophet they man was God himself he told Adam and Eve he told him he said now I ought to give you the word and and it's up to you to keep this word and what happens he Eve was the first version and if the Bible talks about a virgin and and you can run it through the scripture and liken that to a church okay to a woman no no now and Eve oh by the time thank God by the time she had got to Adam amen her wound had already been vitally her wound had already been violated but because see what happened was she she couldn't wait on God she she got all so thirsty for knowledge and so thirsty for education and things of that nature that she moved ahead of God and by the time she came see if she wanted promised that she would have just waited because he had already told him to be fruitful and multiply amen it would have came the correct way but she had already violated herself by committing spiritual adultery not too long ago our pastor was here in the pulpit and he was talking about explaining he said he's one of the things about women preachers when you have a revelation of a woman in the pulpit you know it it shows that that's it's not right because of what it is because of the beginning and and how that pastor that preacher in the pulpit is is is sowing seed amen and the soul of seed is always a male si si si si si you you you you you what you have been a spiritual perversion si and then what happened is he that's that's that's that's what a delicate his worship the devil gets his worship in / versing the original seed of God he wants to if he can alter a man the thing in it just a little bit you're no longer worshiping God but you're worshiping him because it's not the word because it's not the word so if you can he get you to alter God's Word or to deviate from scripture in just a little bit then you're worshiping him and and and that see a man now you're planting a another see a man we see that uh in this time that one of the things in this time is that Satan a man is is really how would I say troubling our young people not just our young people our older people to this this is I will try to encourage our young folk stay with the Lord stay you know those things are gonna come up there's things are gonna come in your life that are gonna try to tempt you to do certain things and to go in a certain direction when we and you don't be in being young see look look did one of the things Eve was young Eve was only about I think the Prophet said about 21 22 but see that's whack certified wish that's when death set in this is why that we we grow up and we eat and we grow into certain up to a certain age and all of a sudden we stop growing death that's it no matter how much we eat no matter how much we consume we're no longer growing they may unless we're growing out but we're we're at that point death is already set into the body see so there's a certain time as a certain age group now hear me here there's a certain age group where the devil really gets at you there's a certain age group and that's a it's that that both young men and young women around that critical age 21 to 25 is when you're most vulnerable Satan is a risk because if you can get past that and serve the Lord stay with God it is gonna be much easier from their own if he can't get you thrown off there he can get you he can get you to a place where your life is troublesome hard the rest of the way through and I said that you can't come back that you won't make it or anything of that nature but it's he can get you though make a mistake do some things wrong right at the front that's gonna make it that much harder to run this race at that critical age it's a very critical Junction and I just want to encourage all my young brothers and youngsters at that age stay with the Lord do everything you can stay close to your pastor stay under the word stay in your church don't let nothing different that's exactly what he did Eve Eve would welcome him oh god oh no doubt she loved her freedom no doubt she will the problem was was explaining it one day and said that he would walk through the garden and she would say hello to all of it and just having a wonderful time and remember the serpent was one of the animals she would say hello mr. serpent how you doing this morning surfer would give a cordial conversation good morning Eve how are you this morning and they would have just a normal conversation but she wants you didn't realize that this one day he was no longer the serpent the devil had incarnated his body and he had began to what preach doctrine to Eve and she accepted that doctrine first she accepted it in her mind into the womb of her mind and then she accepted it into her womb see so folks this see that we're talking about the seed that we're talking about if it was talked it was a spoken word seed see God's the original seed the message the original spoke the spoken word is the original seed C and C is so today about a speaking of the word a man Satan at that time was about a speaking of the word amen that he that he sold sold I see so we see that that like that it was the sons of God of set and the sons of the lineage of God through Adam and the daughters of Cain when they saw that they were pretty and that they were fair and and and we see that the sons of God looked upon the daughters of men and began to desire them began to circle because because they they dress different because they they were they dress in a manner of of seductive the Prophet said that note that better that woman was the biggest at the beginning the downfall to man and it's going to be the same thing at the end and we see now today in this day and age that that spirit is coming to maturity once again a man now we look again we see that uh there's another virgin there was another that was another encounter where we're going to go and talk about Mary how married a man that angel of the Lord came to Mary and said [Music] you're gonna have this son and Mary couldn't marry could could he brought out that Mary coulda said wait a minute I can't do this or nothing like that but she didn't do that she accepted Amen that seed of God so now we got two versions we got these two women we got one at the beginning who who before she got with her husband what she was a virgin but she defiled us before she got to the hub and it produced what death and here although we have another virgin whoever it was was was was expounded by the Holy Spirit I mean it produced what life Amen because she did not allow her womb to become defiled she did not allow a man false doctrine creeds and dogmas into her room she stayed right with the word amen and that here we are a man today facing the same thing I don't want to get ahead of myself now jesus said that uh when he was here if you have faith like a mustard seed would say to this mountain be thou removed and cast into the sea amen and it will so you have to have that it was the special character about that mustard seed is that it can't be mixed it won't mix with anything else a man if you can't allow your that that seed to be mixed with anything with creeds and dogmas a lot of times you know we look and one of the things that Satan a man one of the things that Satan you know in this age in this day and time try to tell us that uh we want to look different we wanna we want out we want to we want to we can't take home the world's image we can't we week this Satan wants us to feel a something because you're different but see as Christians were supposed to be different we're supposed to be set aside I mean one of the things that uh you know you know Adam and Eve when they was in the garden they were veiled they were veiled a man with a with the holy veil so you know we've seen pictures and things with them in the Garden of Eden and different things like that and it showed them you know without clothes and different things and but see the prophets say that they had a veil date they were failed that they didn't realize they didn't see their nakedness they were oblivious to it until the sin and then what happened was the first thing they did was put on a fig leaf so even back there in Genesis clothes manner and when when when they hid themselves God could use they would fellowship with with the Lord in the cool of the evening he would come down and this time he come down they say Adam away yeah you know it's time for church well well yeah Adam hiding itself because he knew that he was naked and and and then the Lord one who told you who told you this who told you you was naked and see even then a man they had on the wrong garment and he had to go kill the lamb and say here put this on so even then your clothes your manner of dress matters it matters to God how you present yourself before this is what I'm getting that even though here we looked at how the the sons of God the sons of sent looked upon the daughters of King and they were found why because there was a spirit on the inside of them that they wanted to dress seductively where does that come from where does that come from now we see what the fall was in the beginning we see what the fall was in the beginning now we see that the spirit that is a was even back then that was a that was that was among the women to be seductive to be seducing and that the men of the sons of God thought they were fair the Prophet and we wonder why we said well when we have a prophet he said why he came in this age and he preached under women's law you know how just a matter of dress in me and they bought me cousin and in Mandarin themselves after the world after the fashions of this world you know what these fashions and stuff come from most of these fashion designers are the most evil and wicked people you ever did one of me some of the most perverse people that don't do it all kind of things and then coming up with these fashions that coming up with these fashions out of strip clubs and different they their whole mind and their whole concept is to do what to entice my human eye their whole thing because they they don't know it they're being controlled now we're gonna get into this a little bit they're being controlled by a spirit they're not even aware of so when they making me decides they're being controlled by an evil spirit and now that evil spirit hermanus taking on the person who puts on the clothes to be seductive to walk a certain way to have a certain mannerism about them to do one thing what because the son of God to phone to cause us you notice you notice the same never went back he never wear that but he got Eve now you take this back to have SARS and even in this state he kicked a woman not not our dear sisters here I'm not no no I'm sitting that off because she it takes something for sister took to how many I just think what you get it you get all the time why did you wear number skirt why you don't wear when your own we're here like us you know and you know what innate the sinners it ain't the settles who ask these questions it may even send us who are bothered by it's the Christian folks it's the Christian folks who have a problem we need Wow because you are judging them without even opening your mouth that one over wait a minute what's wrong with me they don't take all of it well not showing you in the Bible in Genesis it took all of it to be corrupted or defiled your thinking is defiled and that sea of Satan has entered into your heart now you bow that may be a season there may be a seed of God there but you bound by already spirits that you can't go free you can't go free on your own hey man now seeing this that in this day and age the Prophet brought out in the message the spoken word is the original see he said that there were three seed sown in this day there was three seats on a mistake there was a seed song by you had Billy Graham who was the Baptist and the Presbyterian to Methodist groups he said a Billy Graham went and sold his soul seeds all over the world and you had another soul of seen by mister oil Robbins the Pentecostal see and you had his ministry that's sowed the seed of the word and you wonder why what was he doing what was he doing it came so out of the ordinary so different and says hey why do you why do you preach on our women folk like this I'm so antsy I have to go around he went around the world seven times so on see and then all of a sudden out to these three gentlemen went around and sowing the seeds he brought out how how there was a former in a latter rain and he said now and she said that that former ring was called a teaching ring it was a teaching rain and that rain that was was after those seeds have been sown amen that the word had been taught you know how I get when you plant a garden and then after you plan to God the first thing you do you gotta soak the ground that was that teaching rain but there's a lot of rain that bring that seed into maturity we're living into the time of that maturity that wasn't that he preached that message the spoken word is the original scene in 1962 here we are in year 2019 both all and Billy Graham are no longer here and the Prophet that seed that was planted in it's coming to maturity that's why I started out by saying that one of the things of a man you can you can sense that the end is drawing near that's one of the things that a limb is able to do David a sense that the end is drawing near and and and we see that that he brought out how uh how that see in its maturity is going to produce what the World Council of Churches that confederation of churches that is going to come against amen that's this there's two bindings going on there's there's one that cuz the sower seed come to bind up to the the shuck a man and and then another vine taking that wheat a man going to the marriage supper and that that binding up that shuck and all that's that's coming together now for the burning those all of it is coming to maturity and coming to a head and they say and this time so that's what I'm saying it's so critical for our young people to recognize that keep yourself keep yourself pure keep yourself holy because the time a man at the end is so close we that the seeds have been sown you happen to be living in an inner in the last day and a lot of people for some reason you know you don't believe that you can't go around mixing be careful what you're allowed to go into your womb be careful of what you allow yourself to listen to be careful what you're allowed to be that allowed to go into your womb so you want your mind and your heart is the room the way where you know where that seed is planted and you don't want anything just as entering into your into your bedding ground anything interim into your bedding ground so we see now that that that uh I want to go if we look at um turn your Bibles to Martin for a man mark for and let's see here Oh started the 37th verse 37 verse in Myanmar for 237 verse it says and there arose a great storm of wind and waves beat into the ship so that it was now full and he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow and they awakened him and say unto Him master carest not that we perish and he arose and he rebuked the wind and said unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm and he said unto them why are you so fearful how is it that ye have no faith and they feared exceedingly and said one to another what manner of man is this that even the wind and the sea obey Him were going to the fields and they came over unto the other side of the sea and to a country of garden Gardens dhadak got errands and when he was come out of the ship immediately there met him out of tombs a man with an unclean spirit who had in his dwelling among the tombs and no man could bind him not with change because he had been often bound with fetters and chains and but we felt as a chain and the chains had been plugged asunder by him and the fetters broken in pieces neither could any man tame him and always night and day he was in the mountain and his tombs crying and cutting himself with stone you see this man was being tormented this man was being tormented by demons by demonic spirits that had him bound that had him spiritually bound with these fetters and chains that he couldn't go free he he was cutting himself and you see today when many people when they're doing things and they know that they are going to hurt them such as smoking cigarettes some are on drugs some take to alcohol they know that these things are gonna harm them but see you can get so to a place where that demon has overtaken you so much you don't care about life anymore you find these different ones I'm gonna be honest with you you find different ones on these motorcycles and different things and they're in the streets and you said they're crazy what are you driving like that they ride like that they don't care about life they are just trying to live for the moment you see different ones and they go out to these nightclubs and there take all kind of unnecessary risk and chances they are being tormented by demonic spirits they don't care about life they're living just for the moment they're trying to just they're trying to know their pain trying to calm their fear they are being oppressed by demons everywhere you look everywhere you look some people are what they would call functional alcoholics functional drug addicts they go into the secret of their home and and do things intentionally to try and dull the pain because they don't really care about tomorrow they just live in for a moment they just live in for a moment why because they're being tormented by demonic spirits let's continue reading and always by night in the mountains and the tunes crying and cutting himself with stone but when he saw Jesus afar off he ran to worship and worshiped him and cried with a loud voice and said what have I to do with thee Jesus thou son of the Most High God i adjure he says i adjure thee by God that thou torment me not now as two people speaking here see but they're speaking and using one voice those demons recognize Jesus they recognize and they begin to speak through this individual and say did you come - we got in to do with you this is our home we got this one you know you might as well go somewhere we got this one what are you coming but you know what Jesus came over the stormy sea to reclaim the seed that was crying out that seed was crying out and then he could not go free but there was something on the inside of him that was crying out for God and Jesus recognized it and Jesus came over to stormy sea I say this morning what did Jesus have to come over to get to you did he have to go into a barroom did he have to go into the truck being did he have to go behind denominational walls where did Jesus have to go through I'll rephrase it what do he have to go through to get to you but he's not he's coming to reclaim carseat I we didn't go back and read it but job says in the 14 that man is born a few days and full of trouble but this body is going to go back to the dirt so what he's reclaiming is that seed that life on the inside and if he can get there to that life and get those speech that's a lot of times while look we come to church and we around different one you can't go free with no spirits on you you want to go free different people know they've been in conditions they want to go free but Jesus came to this man a man who was bound with these spirits just to get that one scene again I said what did he have to go through a man to get to you amen let's continue reading and he cried with a loud voice amen and God I said are you the not torment me not see the I said again this man he wasn't looking for Jesus he wasn't he wasn't he him in his natural state he wasn't trying to go to church he was trying to he wasn't doing nothing but that was something on the inside that G that God had to reclaim a man and he said unto Him come out of the man thou unclean spirit and asked him what is thy name and he answered saying my name is legion for we are many and he besought him much and he would not send them away out of the country now there was near unto the mountain a great herd of swine feeding and all the devil's besought him saying send us into the swine that we may enter into them a man so we see here that uh said my name is legion for we are many and this is why I say to like young people when you when you when you don't stay with the things of the Lord all you're doing is howling demon on top of demon on top of demon on top of demon that's why it's so hard for a person into their older ages to change and come to the Lord the prophecy is much easier in you in the days of your youth because you don't have these spirits that are fighting against you you don't have all of these spirits that are fighting against you but when you go out and look some of you all we're gonna test you go right then you get involved in certain things that you everything I said like that you big and bad enough to get involved in now you got to fight in battle these spirits that you have collected along the way just for God to get that see now we realize you see that guy that God would come through amen a stormy sea to reclaim that sea now the Prophet was talking about he was he was a member of one of the group called the full confidence men and one of the leaders of that group was a gentleman by the name of Dimas cheek area and the mister Karen used to her cows and he would he would uh farm these cows and he would take so brother branham was down at the farm with him and at one time and they would he short brother branham you know look how he does things and how he produce more cows so he would take the fluid from a male bull with a syringe and he and he put it on a little microscope and he took that ether on a petri dish or a plate or something to put under the microscope and he would look down in that little drop and he said well what is those little things twitching around in there you got him and you know how to microscope you got to hone in on it and everything and say see millions of these little microscopic these little things I'm gonna he said those are little Bulls and cows little bulls and cows and he said what their millions of them he said yes their millions of them but only one is predestinated to make it to that see he said he was talking about he said you're looking at he say he say he said that natural burst is more of a miracle than the virgin birth I say wow he say cuz I know all the millions only one is predestinated to get to that and that's the one a man that he saw before the foundation of the world man that's gonna come to itself in that certain time through that entrance into the earth amen for what a specific purpose see God is in control he is in control they may all the way down to the insemination of your birth amen so he's looking at it and he said in out of all the mean that's Chamillionaire he said in all it one he's gonna make and then he looked back and he was thinking my mom the children of Israel when they was coming out of Egypt there were millions there was millions two million he said there were two million little over to me in one place is a two million fourteen or something like daddy said it was over two million and then in another place there that I read and he was talking about how out of two million only two only two one across Joshua and Caleb only two so my whole point in bringing out that story is that even in this day I don't know how many millions and millions of people we have on this earth but if the math goes right it won't be a whole lot it will not be a whole lot that'll make it that'll make it it's gonna be a small little group now remember what I say though there was three seas that was sold three seas that was sold the bride is gonna is coming to maturity there's a virgin that is not gonna allow her womb to be defiled that is not gonna allow over-wound am I gonna know that that former rain is gonna that seed that's on the inside of her heart is gonna come to maturity amen so I say to you this morning be encouraged be encouraged that we see that in this day in this hour that day the devil is as he is working so hard he is working so hard to to sidetrack you but there's something on the inside of you that God is trying to reclaim there will be a bride without a spot or wrinkle there will be a bride without a spot or wrinkle amen I want to be one I am one amen are you one are you one of them amen so I've been hoping my brothers and sisters lay aside every sin in every week that's just things that in our lives that we may be going through just realized that the devil is trying to saya if he can just you don't have to get you off just a little bit the Prophet was talking about how if you're trying to hit a target to use that Weatherby rifle you got to be dead-on straight if he can get you off just a little bit by the time you get down there you off 2030 hours you missed the mark by that much you know and a lot of times you know we're living in this age in time where people well it's okay you can't mix the word became mixed to work recently we was out of place in and and and fellow was preaching and talking about all sorts of things man you can't you can't you can't feed the word on dirty dishes you can't send with that thing up in garbage and then feed it to me it's gonna make it I can't receive it like that talking about all sorts of things and right in the middle you slip a verse and oh wait a minute no no it's got to be pure words it's got to be pure word I can't eat that like that I'm not gonna leave you but somebody presented you food with flies and all this garbage all over with you not even that I'm not eating that you can't you can't mix it you can't mix it amen so I just want to say you know be careful of what you're receiving to your wound and just understand that where we're at there was there were there were there were three angels there came in this generation they sow seeds some once so good see the word the word of the hour this the word for this day other soul it was also the word for this way but for this day but it's and it's to do something totally different that confederation of churches that he talked about it's coming to its maturity it's coming to its maturity as well a man to do what to come against the bride to come against the bride hey man so this is where we're at amen we're not playing church we're not just coming out of tradition so many we see so many in this day and time they're going to church out of tradition out of habit this is not a social gospel we're not coming to be sociable your life is at stake my life is at stake Lord speak to me Lord rain on me set that seed may grow that I may grow into the full statue of a perfect man that I may be that you may recognize me becoming to the fruition of all that you have called me to be that I can come into the place to serve you and the purpose that you have placed me here for lean not to thine own understanding turn away from all of these worldly things and and and and and cleave to the Word of God because with its time as this is we like I said lamb we know there's a sixth sense there's a sense that we know when time is drawing nigh we feel the lion is approaching you can feel it we don't have the sense like everybody like the other Lions to hunt a man we need a shepherd and that lamb since that death is near get back with it get back to the Sheep get back to the corral get back to the Shepherd a man he's look up wait a minute where's the Shepherd I've been out here too long I've been out here too long amen and if you've been out amen and los been out just doing your own thing and you feel in your heart through this preaching another gospel at that time that death is near if I don't get back to the shepherd if I don't get back to the corral amen Jesus came over a rugged see past all over a rugged sea to get through a man that was be sought by demons he'll go through anything to get to you in this hour amen amen so you'd love the Lord let's give the Lord a praise off musicians come amen I trust that you got something out of that amen didn't quite go the way I expected it to go but a man I that's all right I hope that uh
