morning good to be here with family this morning and uh brother Jack wanted me to greet the people this morning so I'm just going to take a quick minute uh I believe Shakespeare was the one that said brevity is the soul of wit so we're going to try to be real short our path bring greetings from our church spoken word church or pastors both Samuel Dale and brother Dale's always said blessed is the preacher who can testify and not preach so I'm gonna build be real brief this morning but it's good to be here this morning I'm not going to get choked up but it's wonderful to be here I have a I've watched for quite a while online and uh so I'm the one that brother Jack told you all about last Sunday I'm guilty as charged but uh it's good to be here and I appreciate each one of you and the word is going forth and uh I tell everybody that y'all worship on Sunday I worship with y'all on Mondays and Tuesdays and uh so I work on I work in maintenance and lots of times I'm on the roof by myself so I've got an ear for my radio in this ear and I've got my earbud in this here from my phone and as I'm listening to the services so and I told Brother Simba I appreciate him he puts everybody's name on there so I appreciate that I figure out who people are I don't know everybody's name but I know some of you I know your faces and so I told him I said that I wanted to be I was going to be at a disadvantage here because you only have to learn like five people's names there's quite a few of y'all but I want to I want to be ahead of the game so so I just I just really appreciate the spirit and the word that's went forth all the all the brothers brother Smiley brother Troy and the different ones brother Quentin and brother Jerry it's really been just a blessing and uh so this is my wife Sarah and my sister that's my sister Janine and then our son Adam and then Levi's over by the wall but uh [Applause] and and if I could sing like brother Solomon that's all I'd ever do I tell brother Solomon I've sent him messages how much it's just really meant to to hear you know because it's not just about leading singing It's about worshiping the Lord I've told many young people that they get hung up on playing their instruments or singing and I said it's not you're not doing this to a crowd he said you're singing and glorifying the Lord I said that's the only person that matters is him if we just lift him up so what if you make a mistake so what if we forget the words we're just worshiping the Lord and so I appreciate each one of you and uh if if without taking too much time this morning yeah there's if I could say something this morning no is you know brother Branham said there's coming a day and I forgot brother Josue God bless you brother that's my buddy from Bethel camp

ain't it amen amen so good to have brother Aaron and Sister Sarah and the family amen with us uh for Georgia this uh it's it's a blessing blessing to have you all I won't have you stand alone we'll read it we'll read a Bible and uh I'll get into uh the thought for today amen um thank y'all musicians appreciate y'all so much appreciate the specials that uh that went forth amen we uh we thank God for all things amen uh Luke chapter four is where I want to read from on today amen and um this is actually one of my favorite passages amen I like Luke four uh but we just trust the Lord will just kind of direct us on today and I'll be starting a man that um verse 16. here in Luke 4. praise the Lord the Bible says and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood for stood up for to read there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet um izius or Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he had sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised now I'm not a uh a person that plugs too much but I will and I don't watch a lot of movies amen but I did watch The Chosen amen and uh when they did this scene uh uh it's just something that just kind of rolls up in me like you know the the the the the the the the the written word had become the manifested word and they had a hard time receiving that amen amen amen but I'm not gonna that's that's part of my subject but let me just try to keep reading here uh verse 19 says to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and gave it again to the minister and sat down in the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears and I'll bear him witness and wonder that the gracious Words which proceeded out of his mouth and they said is not this Joseph's son and he said unto them ye will surely say unto me this proverb physician heal thyself What Shall We Have Heard done a Capernaum do also here in that country and he said verily I say unto you no Prophet is accepted in his own country but I tell you of a truth many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias when the heaven was shut up three years and six months when the great when Great Famine was throughout all the land but unto none of them was Elias sent save unto Sarepta city of sidon unto a woman that was a widow and many lepers were in Israel in a time of elysius the prophet and none of them was cleansed saving Naaman the Syrian let's pray father God we thank you for the privilege and the opportunity we have to read scripture but we know it takes the Holy Ghost to help us to understand and apply what we have read so I trust Lord that you would take control over the thought here this morning may you bless your people of those both those present those that were not able to join us those that are joining online look Lord to each and every one of your people and bless them abundantly God we give you the glory and honor in Jesus name we pray amen and amen God bless you it can be seated I did forget to mention that I am grateful for um the time of Fellowship we had last night with the couples uh just a really really wonderful wonderful event um thank God for just Italian sister Erica just working behind the scenes to to make that what it was and um looking forward to to more of that we want to strengthen the couples the families amen and and um uh in the church because you know since the time we're just sharing something with me and she was saying how she heard on I believe on the radio that in every uh we have this Earth that we live on but on the earth is divided into uh uh Nations or countries and then uh when you get into those Nations or countries countries you have to start dividing down to States and when you get to States then you start going down to counties and from counties down to cities and then even down the towns and that at the core of all of that when you get down to the bottom of it's just people families that are holding all that together if the family is broken apart then the city is not any good and the town is not good then that affects amen the county it affects the state it affects the nation it affects the world so we have to do things to strengthen the family amen praise the Lord amen and that is Our intention Amen to do that so we thank God for that uh on last night and we'll be doing more we'll be doing more to to to to today I'm going to get started in the subject I will forewarn you that I will not finish this thought on today amen if you want to hear the end of the start you got to come back praise the Lord but uh but nevertheless it's enough for us to get started and I just want to use the the title God is in his man amen God is in his man praise the name of the Lord so the prophet gives us uh just a little story that I'd like to start out with in the sermon God is in his word brother Brandon preaches a number of sermons around uh this little theme of God is in and he would put God is in his word God is in his son God is in his people uh and I preached a number of sermons on that I did a series a few years ago on that uh God is in uh and today we're picking up God is in his man but um I actually never preached that part so in order for me to preach God is in this man I'm gonna have to go back and pick up some of the other things that I preached before Amen to bring us forward but nonetheless we will enjoy the journey but here in the sermon God is in his word brother Branham makes a statement he says sometime go there was an old fisherman down on the River where I live and the little boy used to go fishing with him this little boy was a Christian boy and he went to Sunday school so one day he asked mama he said Mama is there any way that we could ever see God Amen and um you know why she said honey I don't know says ask your Sunday school teacher so Mama's just passing the book right ask your Sunday school teacher uh so he went and asked the Sunday school teacher and said uh and she said I don't know the same question you know can anybody see God and and the Sunday school teacher says I don't know glory to God and uh so the Sunday school teacher says ask the pastor they passed the book to the pastor and the Pastor said no you can never see God no man can see God and that discouraged the little boy amen he had a he had a question that was in his heart that Mama couldn't answer he had a question that the Sunday school teacher couldn't answer he had a question that the pastor gave an answer to but it did not satisfy the deep that was still inside the boy amen so here we go on in this quote so one day uh up on the river near the Six Mile Island he was up with the old fisherman there come up a storm and as the old fisherman was coming back down the river with uh with the white Gray beard hanging over his bosom the little boy sitting in the stern of the boat and and the rhythm of the oars on the water as he pulled the boat there was a rainbow came out amen and all this old fisherman started looking to the rainbow as he pulled his oars and a little fellow noticed that that tears was running down his cheeks amen and he said excitedly he run up towards the stern of the boat he said sir I'm going to ask you a question that my mama Sunday school teacher up Master could not answer me he said if God is so great why can't we see him he thought he had stumped this old fella amen and look at the answer he says uh he says can any man see God sir it got the old fisherman he pulled the oars in his lap and took the little boy in his arms he said God bless your little heart honey all I've seen for the past 40 years has been gone hallelujah amen you see you see you have to have God in here to see God out there if you haven't got him in here you'll never see him out there but you got to have him Amen on the inside so he finally runs into somebody that could actually answer his question and the way that this man answers his question is through his experience blessed be the name of the Lord amen I believe everybody desires to see God everybody desires to grow closer to God to know this God that we talked about we talk about so much uh and and I'm just kind of circling back Amen to my my series that I did a while ago and who knows if the Lord has us pick it all up again we'll do that but uh but I want to go back and I'm just kind of giving some highlights from it amen but I want to talk about God as in his people if you're looking for God Amen you can find him sometimes in his people glory to God you can find him in his people and you know one of the one of the stories in the scripture amen that we're all familiar with is the story of Abraham amen and Abraham and Sarah and and uh uh Abraham being the father of faith and I like how you know one brother put it I was listening to him preached this morning and he says a god did not connect to Abraham's flesh because his flesh was not worth being connected to the man was a liar the man sold his wife and sold his wife out twice God weren't connecting to his flesh God was connecting to his faith hallelujah amen and we're Abraham's seed through that Faith right so so so so uh you know in the life of Abraham God chose him and and even even though he went through all these things where he was you know to us he looked like a complete failure but when you read about him over in the Book of Romans amen just seemed like he's a I mean he he kept the faith he never got weak in faith he strong in faith always giving glory to God and amen I mean he seemed like a super Christian but when I look at him in Genesis I don't get that picture of him praise the Lord that's the way amen God feels about you maybe when you looked at yourself you don't see nothing but God sees a man a Son of God and a daughter of God and Overcomer hallelujah amen God don't see you as defeated God see you with the victory Hallelujah I don't care what you're going through God see you already with the victory he's already giving you the victory just waiting for you to claim it and walk in it amen but Abraham was one that we we you know we look at him in scripture and God used certain things in his life one in particular is when he took his son amen up the mountain and it's just it's just a beautiful story and and I found out that the same Mountain that Abraham offered Isaac on was the same Mountain that Christ died on right I mean a beautiful story when you when you get a chance to look at it but uh but when we look at this Abraham was portraying Christ amen by taking the Sun up the mountain to be sacrificed Isaac was the promised son a man and considered thine only son according to the scripture right also Isaac was led up the mountain just as Christ was led to the Cross amen amen the same Isaac that was laid on the altar was also raised from the altar Amen in the same Jesus that was laid in the grave was raised from the grave so when we look at the story of Abraham and Isaac we can see that God was hidden in his people foreign Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah let's go with a little statement here from the the message God has identified by his characteristics and look at what um you know the prophet tells us here he says watch the characteristics of God says picked up a handful of dust and thrown it into the air and it turned into fleas he's talking about Moses here he says the Creator characteristic of God was in Moses and I just though that's a statement that I like to highlight the Creator characteristic of God was in Moses amen and Moses spoke in Deuteronomy 18 15 and it said the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet liken unto me oh hallelujah amen now let me just just pause there just for a second uh because what we're going to see in this as I keep reading this quote that Prophet like and unto uh when Moses said the Lord your God will raise a prophet like it unto me we know that he was talking about Christ we know that however amen I would like to also add that I believe that scripture that Moses when he spoke that had dual meanings and not just me I mean meanings it's it's talking about different ones we know it's talking about Christ we got that part hallelujah amen but but when we look at the New Testament and and Paul having the ability to write two-thirds of the New Testament just like Moses had the ability to write the beginning of the of the Old Testament the first five books amen God gave him that oh my God gave him that God gave something to Paul to be able to write two-thirds of the New Testament Paul could be considered a prophet like unto Moses do we have an amen in the house Paul could be considered amen as a fulfillment of a prophet like unto Moses but I don't live in the days of Paul and there were some things that happened in the day in which we live amen there were seven seals on the back of a book amen there were no Seven Seals were revealed a prophet it took a prophet to reveal that word to us and when that Prophet took the word and opened it up nobody else had that responsibility God gave it to that prophet and when he opened it up then we can look at that Prophet as a fulfillment of the scripture a prophet like unto Moses amen amen the Creator characteristic of God was in Moses look at this and Moses spoke in Deuteronomy 18 15 said the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet like it unto me now watch that's the word again characteristic God's speaking through Moses telling them that the Lord would raise up one like him it was God speaking through Moses amen telling them the Lord will raise up one like him now notice how Jesus characteristics identified him to be this promised word when Moses said it would be the character of Jesus identified it notice now the Lord your God that's that's God that's the word shall raise up a prophet like unto me whoever won't believe that Prophet will be cut off from among the people and we see it manifesting itself all over again today amen whoever won't believe that Prophet will be cut off from among the people now watch when Jesus came what kind of a characteristic was he to have see notice now the promised word he promised to be a prophet like Moses now I want to just kind of dwell on that amen that that creative characteristic of God that was in Moses Moses called for the ten plagues uh water uh Eternal Ward into blood a frogs lice flies livestock boils uh hell mingle with fire Locust Darkness death of the firstborn all these plagues that Moses called for uh called for that creative characteristic was in Moses a man but we also see that same uh creative characteristic uh especially the spoken word glory to God because when Moses say Let There Be There was amen and that only came from God because God started that off in the beginning in Genesis let there be light and there was Let There Be flies and there was Let There Be frogs and there was amen and when you go back and you look at the scripture I don't have time to do all this but you go back you look at the scripture we'll pick up one little verse where say and the Lord did that thing the Lord did that thing how was the Lord doing that thing through Moses God was in a man uh but we see Moses uh calling for all these things and it was that creative characteristic of God we see that same creative characteristic manifested in the Lord Jesus when he spoke to a tree and said no fruit be on you anymore forever that tree withered in 24 hours Jesus changed the situation with the spoken word amen amen when Jesus spoke the word to the Centurion servant amen the man say I'm not worthy that you come underneath my roof but if you would just speak the word only I know my servant would be made whole this man had a confidence that just the words of Jesus was enough for his servant oh Hallelujah just the words of Jesus sometimes just your words is enough to turn the situation around because the creative characteristic dwells inside of you if you have the Holy Ghost that's right brother hey I'm talking about the same God that said let there be that God is living inside of you the creative characteristic was found in Jesus when he said peace be still to the storm that was on the on the sea my God the winds and the waves were acting contrary but he said peace be still and and even the disciples said what matter man is this that even though winds and the waves obey him oh my that man lives inside of us God is in his man God is in his woman amen Jesus healed the sick gave the disciples the same power to cast out devils and I like to say this when Jesus gave him the greatest disciples uh Power to cast out Devils it was it was more than just salvation he was actually further in the ministry of Christ in his people glory to God we thank the Lord John 14 and 12. says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works in thee shall he do because I go into my father's the furthest of the ministry see it says and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if he should ask anything in my name I will do it amen amen God was in his people glory to God we find it uh uh I want to look at another characteristic I love the way brother Branham just titled that sermon God is identified by his characteristics but another characteristic that I want to show that was just kind of in um in his people was that Resurrection characteristic amen the resurrection characteristic was found uh in Elijah amen and then Elisha asked for a double portion of Elijah's spirit so when Elisha received a double portion of Elijah's Spirit then then that Resurrection characteristic was passed on to Elisha oh hallelujah amen uh uh uh this was a type of Christ in the bride the resurrection characteristic we know was in Christ no man take my life I lay it down I'll raise it up again in three days and he did exactly what he said he would do but that Resurrection characteristic now is dwelling inside of us we've seen people raised from the dead God is still raising from the dead it's not just something that happened in Bible days it's still happening right here hey man we've seen people where they they code it glory to God and after the word of prayer life came back into their bodies we have experienced that right here we've been in church and saw a young man leaving not just getting up walking out of church he was dying in the church Hallelujah in the middle of the service he was dying but we began to pray for him and before you anointed he came right back Hallelujah he was getting cold in the service not because of the AC his life was leaving him but we saw God resurrect that young man the resurrection characteristic is still here glory to God we see Elisha amen but Elijah performed eight Miracles but Eli shall perform 16 Miracles Elijah there was no rain for three and a half years the meal and the oil amen was sustained for the widow woman he raised the widow woman's son he he opened the Jordan River amen over this some of the Miracles also amen Elisha he opened the Jordan River amen the oil flowed to pay off the debts I like that Amen Oil flow the payoff debt all the lady had to do is get some jugs get as many jugs as you can borrow from everybody you can but just get the judge because they're gonna be full and you're going to use this to pay off your debt and I love the way God do things God not I see you only praying for God to pay off your debt but I want to tell you something God thinking a little bit further than you he not only want to pay off your debt he want to give you overflow he want to give you leftovers praise God that's the God we serve not just meet your need but do the exceeding the abundance above all you can ask or think that's the God that I serve Hallelujah not just paying off my debts I want money left in the bank after the deaths have been paid Elisha cause an ax head to swim there's a woman that could not have a son and he he gave her a baby come on God was in his man God was in his people amen another dead son raised he laid his body over the boy and he sneezed seven times amen uh uh and you know and and even even Elisha's bones was found in a grave there was Miracles still happening after Elijah died America was still happening even after he died he never said a word but there was anointing inside of his bones Hallelujah that when they threw the dead man over a soldier been fighting the battle brother you better know where to be buried we all Gotta Die but you better know where to be buried that Soldier amen he just threw him into the the bones of Elijah and before you know the man jumped back up on his feet but his sword in his head was ready to fight again miracle happened from my bones God proved that he was in his people amen amen amen and even I'ma just throw this in while we're here even even brother brother Branham we saw that that that that that that that uh Resurrection characteristic in his ministry because what brother Brandon prayed for a brother One Time by the name of Elijah and he didn't know why but he just found himself stretched on top of his brother and before he knew he had something grabbing a hold of his ear and he said and the brother was just saying brother Brandon brother Brandon brother Branham and he laying on top of the brother he like I don't even know why I did that he did it because it was spilled in the scripture that's what Elisha Elijah did in the scripture so that same spirit that was only Elijah was on the prophet in this day God was in his man brother Wade dropped dead in the service and brother Wade dropped dead because he disagreed with what the prophet said you got to watch your attitude when you went underneath the anointed you got to watch your attitude but he disagreed what the prophet said and he dropped dead right in the service his wife being a nurse could not do anything the church was in the stair brother Brandon said y'all been taught better than that don't act like that right now suggest Everybody by your hand he went and prayed for the brother and God brought him right back up hallelujah hallelujah amen that creative or that that Resurrection characteristic was found in his ministry what about the mother who had a dead baby for hours the baby was dead down in Mexico and it's all she all she knew is that I saw there's a man that's been blind in my city for years and now this man can see I need to know where he went at what meeting did he go to because I know this man could not see let's say you need to come to this meeting that lady held that baby in her arms a dead baby for hours hey man it's just in the rain didn't care what nobody said I gotta get to this meeting I can't even speak the Evangelist language but if he prayed for that man I want him to pray for my baby and that lady was going through the ushers Amen brother Branham say uh brother Jack why don't you go down and pray for her because she don't know the difference between me and you and he said he said just just get a car and and not know Usher could get this lady come I mean she would go through their legs with a dead baby you talk about determination you talk about faith you talk about not taking no for an answer I didn't come here with my baby and this meeting is going on at the lead here with a dead baby that's a Mama with some faith and a fake calls the prophet to go into a vision and they say wait a minute I see a smiling baby I don't know if that's the baby or not but everybody stop bring her on up here got up there and and he prayed for the baby and God brought the baby right back to life after hours of being dead that Resurrection characteristic and and that baby only was dead for hours Lazarus was dead for days but there was a resurrection characteristic blessed be the name of the Lord God has always proven to be in his people God is also in his universe Psalm 19 and 1. it says the heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork God is in his Universe can I read Psalm 24 just one of my favorite I just like to read it amen Psalm 24 blessed be the name of the Lord oh yes amen God is in his Universe look at what uh the Bible says here the Earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof that's I just like that yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah no the Earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof amen see the some people think they own property the Earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof let me tell you the county don't even own it the county don't even own it the Earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof the world hello somebody and they that 12 they're in for he has pounded it upon the thieves

[Applause] who is this king of glory the Lord of hosts he is the king of glory and when they when they do Salah that means just pause and think about it amen brother random makes a statement here in the message what shall I do with Jesus called Christ God is in his universe it says this in New York last week I was listening at a message quoted or said by Einstein says the great scientist what is called the brain of the time then I went to hear Norman Vincent peel on his psychology about how people should do or walk and project themselves into psychology on Einstein he was speaking of a galaxy that was out between the system there out from Stars or and if a person could travel at the speed he says I believe he said of light what is it uh a hundred and eighty six thousand miles per second that light travels and break that down in five minutes how many millions and billions of Miles you'd be in a hundred and twenty million years of light time it would take you to get to that Galaxy so it's another galaxy a whole nother Galaxy right it would take you 120 million years of light time it would take for you to get to that Galaxy or a 150 million uh years 150 Millions over and 150 150 million there and 150 million back he says and they hit something that stopped them so after going out there and coming back you could you'd actually take you three million years to uh uh and I guess you mean 300 million uh years to make the trip 300 million years 300 million years to make the trip and when you come back to earth actually you've only been gone 50 years brother random say you break into eternity there's no end to it another statement that he gives us a man here in uh the world is falling apart let me just see something here yes in the world the world is again falling apart it says no wonder we're falling apart it says there's nothing the very thing that created the Earth this very thing was put here for the earth to turn on the very thing that system and everything else was to revolve around this work this word that by God frame the world Einstein said there is only one explaining of the scripture only one explaining for this world being in existence it's Einstein a great scientist this is the only thing he come the world is again falling apart it says um it says there is only one explaining of the scripture only one explaining for this world being in existence that is Hebrews 11 by faith we understand that the the by the word of God that the worlds were frame my amen the worlds were framed together by the word of God it says that's all there is no one can tell how it hangs there in the air and how it can turn around and make his 24 hours around the Equator so forth like that and around this orbit everywhere and come back to the same spot and and never miss a second every Star turning on a cycle like that and helping one another as they go around I mean it's just amazing that God was set up like this right now we're we're moving and don't realize we're moving amen amen but God has orchestrated it amen in such a way and as as as as Einstein was just looking at galaxies I just start you know doing just a little research and again these some my previous notes there are uh from from what we were taught in school and now things changing they keep finding so much so many other things you don't know what what what what what to believe but when we were coming up they told us there was eight planets they told us that it was Mercury Venus Earth Mars Jupiter Saturn uh Neptune and Uranus that's what now I think they've added some more since then Pluto it took Pluto out it's just all kinds of stuff but I like the number eight let them argue about whatever they want to argue about because God is in his numbers God and when you see eight you know eight represents the number of new beginning Hallelujah somebody amen so so they told us about the eight planets we also amen I had to I had to you know as I was reading just that quote there I had to go back and find well what is a galaxy see a galaxy is a group of stars and other space stuff now now that's what the scientists have to call it space stuff but God know what he put out there and God know why it's there the Stars tend to spin around a center of high gravity sort of like the planet spin around the Sun in the solar system galaxies are huge and can have trillions of stars amen as big as galaxies are they are generally separated by large areas of empty space my there are even clusters of galaxies that are separated by even larger areas of space look at this scientists think they are over 100 billion galaxies and I just had to say wow the universe is huge and here's what the prophet said the prophet said God is just like the air he feels all the universe God feels all the universe all this pace [Music] and if you've got a little empty space in your heart this morning that same God that fills the universe he wants to feel your heart we just so happen to live in the Milky Way that's the Galaxy we lived in the Milky Way is part of a cluster of around 300 3 000 galaxies called the local group Amen in the Milky Way is a spiral-shaped Galaxy and it's estimated to be made up of about uh 300 billion stars God is in all of that God is in his universe and I mean even even now that they get that that that uh great telescope that they have yet but they call the name of it Hubble all right but but uh they're seeing things out there they've never seen before they just they finding they just it's just it's it's it's uh uh they're all struck when they run into these things it's God in this universe yeah amen hearing the message show us the father and it suffices us brother random makes a statement not long ago there was an Infidel passed through the lands making infidels out of supposedly to be Christians now ain't that something this man is passing through the land and then people that are Christians are converting to be infidels now uh I think as I've seen that Spirit again people that uh people that's supposed to be a man message Believers now they don't know what they believe and all it is it was a spirit that kind of jumped on somebody and until you recognize the spirit you don't you you won't you won't catch it all you think you've got smart but you're under Spirit under a delusion you thought you got some new knowledge Eve thought she did too but it's a delusion and that's why you end up in darkness Hallelujah I mean people can't even hold on to what they believed in Pentecost before they came to the message things they believed in Pentecost they can't hold on to it they end up in darkness look at this now look at this uh infidel pass through the lands making everything else out of supposedly to be Christians Oh my he was so educated till the ministers was afraid to attack him the minister afraid to say anything to me I'm so educated and then he went to Europe and on his road back he got broke down look at it he went out into the West to make him arrest so now his body's all broken down he's sick and now I need to go rest and and watch what happens to him when he gets out in nature Hallelujah and one day while he walked out from his camp oh he swelled himself out he began to look down there come that whispering of the wind down through the pines and he began to look up he looked at the at the at those rocks hanging in the mountain he said oh rocks who put you in the mountains the man started talking to the rocks have I been wrong about the criminology of the world of this world all of a sudden God began to speak the Bible said if they hold their peace The Rock will cry out amen God in this universe speaking from his rock well that Infidel knelt down by the side of a tree said oh God have mercy on my soul to same man that was converting everybody not got converted by looking at one of God's rocks see he's hidden and revealed in simplicity you can just go right over the top of God look at this look at this God in its Universe speaking from his rock where that Infidel knelt down by the side of the tree said oh God have mercy on my soul there you are the pastors were afraid to attack him God couldn't let the Rocks speak out God's in his Universe speaking to his people look at what the prophets say I've seen the sunset stand and cry like a baby and you know and and uh one of the places that I saw the sunset they actually say is going to Key West and now I don't advise people to go to Key West too much because Key West has got some serious Spirits down there no hang out there not at night time just go in and get out but uh we went down there and you know and and they say you got to watch a sun a sunset here in Key West because what happened you sitting there looking at the ocean and just seemed like the sun just go right down inside the ocean and it just it's just a beautiful scene the ocean and the sun like that it's beautiful scenery right I mean you can see God just in his in in nature and somehow the next morning that sun can come right back up out that ocean again it is it is oh it's awesome it's awesome God is in his universe Hallelujah let's go on a little further in this quote he said I've seen the sunset stand and cry like a baby just couldn't help it glorious to see God in the sunset and and his son rise gods and his animals you go out here and look at the paper this winter and the papers uh say tomorrow's gonna be fair and all the news commentators say it's gonna be fair watch that Old South take the Shucks off of the the north side of the hill and take them around on the south side and make her bed don't you believe what the paper says no sir it'll be cold just as sure as the world go out to hunt find a rabbit going down underneath in the fallow row watch for snow and cold weather sure they got a god-given instinct and if you want to know what's going to happen with the weather oh my watch that little animal he ain't tuned into CNN he ain't tuned in to the Weather Channel but God put something on the inside of that animal to know when the weather's getting ready to turn and they take off for safety brother Brandon talked about how them animals got together knew her earthquake was coming and they got into the middle of the film just beginning to bundle together and people couldn't understand why they was doing that you better you better watch how the earthquake is on the way God is in his animals like that let me just give you one more script here Psalms 42. I am coasted I'm coasting God is in his people God is in his universe we're gonna We gonna uh we're gonna get you know a little bit more as we go through this God is in his word God is in his son and and I just want to pick up here just for a little bit God is God is in nature just for a little bit God is in nature and Psalm 42 tells us as the heart panteth after the water Brooks see David is looking at something David is looking at nature and the reason that the heart is panting for the water is because maybe the heart or the the deer we can put it that way the deer has uh maybe maybe somebody is hunting this deer yeah or maybe there's another animal hunting this deer and uh maybe they they've reached back and they've and as a deer was running maybe they grabbed and maybe got a a a jaw or something on on the hind quartz of the of the leg or something and that deer Shake shook himself from it somehow and it took off just running yeah now this deer is just not running to be running this deer is run into a very special place the deer say if I can just I know I've been hurt I know I've been affected I know I've been impacted but if I can just get myself to water [Music] if I get to water then whatever's chasing me is in trouble if I just make it to water they won't be able to find me no more and that deal would just run till he can get to order once he just gets to order it is over for the other animal they missed their opportunity and David say as the heart panteth longing for water so does my soul my God my God so apparently my soul after the O God so my my soul my soul my soul my Souls I mean see see some of us when we get disconnected from God we ought to long to get back into the presence of God we ought to be longing for water life was different when I was at the water hey I didn't have to work too hard I didn't have to worry too much I just had to just take a little drink of water my God so my soul thirsts with God for the Living God When shall I come and appear before God now brother Branham tells us amen a little story here and actually you know what I'm a I'm going to um I'm gonna inject something else before I go to this next quote God is in nature yesterday I was listening to a brother preach his name is brother Doug Lentz amen out of Canada and uh he was talking on our on our our little call that we do there eight o'clock in the mornings and I happened to get on and this brother just brought out something amen that I I don't think I ever heard but I knew that I wanted to preach this sermon today so I said I'm gonna take some of what you what you what you laid out I'm gonna have to use that I'm incorporating that and I'm giving him credit I'm telling y'all his name brother Douglas but he brought out something about you know you know there's things that I'll read a quote here we'll talk about other animals and I just told you about the deer and everything how how uh that deer types Us and how we need to run back to the presence of God but uh this this this this this this worm called the Tola worm now most of us don't really like worms unless you're a fisherman you don't mind grabbing a worm and putting it on the hook and throwing it on out there right but uh but but but but but most brothers that take their wives fishing with them the brother have to be the one to get the worm to put the worm on the hook because the wife don't want to touch that worm we just have a problem with worms see them crawling around just just but God made him for a reason and there's a very unique worm called the Tola worm my God this this worm also has a name a man is called the Crimson worm amen and uh and I was just reading just from a little a website after brother duck talked about I went and found this Amen on the website reasons uh for hope uh reasons for Hope jesus.com and uh and they they said this in the life cycle of this worm is where uh where the type is found and where we talk about the type in Christ amen and it points to the work of Jesus on the cross now God would amen put into a worm uh just a little type of what Jesus did on the cross God would allow something in this worm's life and in its life cycle to reflect what Christ did on the cross if you didn't believe in the cross and you were just out in nature and you saw this worm it might cause you to believe in the cross because the story of the Cross is found in the worm ah God is in nature look at this when the female crimson or the female Tola is ready to lay her eggs and when she lays the eggs it only happens once in her life she climbs up a tree and attaches herself to it with a body attached to the wooden tree a hard Crimson shell forms forms around her Hallelujah now I want you to catch this when she's ready to lay her eggs and it only happens once in a life she climbs up a tree and attaches herself to a tree and she attaches herself so uh deeply to that tree that the only way you can get off is you got the Killer she is so attached to the tree I got to lay these eggs and this only happens once and once in life now I'ma tell you before I even get there she actually goes to the tree to give life but in order to give life she has to die Jesus was attached to a tree and he was attached to the tree to give life to us but in order to give life he had to die in a little worm God tells the story of the crucifixion in the life of a worm let's look at it it says uh with a body attached to the wooden tree a hard Crimson shell forms is a shell so hard and so secured to the wood that it can only be removed by tearing apart the body which would kill the worm it says the female worm lays her eggs under her body under the protective shell when the larvae hatched amen they they remain under the mother's protective shell so the baby worms can feed on the living body of the mother Worm for three days they feed on Mama's body for three days mama let me just keep reading after three days the mother worm dies and her baby and and her body excretes uh Crimson or Scarlet dye that stains the wood a crimson die on the wood actually you know her babies get their color from Mama dying this how they become red oh my God I just see Jesus all in the world look at this the baby the baby worms uh I'm sorry her body excretes a crimson or Scarlet dye that stains the wood to which she is attached and her baby worms the baby worms remain Crimson colored for the for their entire lives thereby they identified as Crimson worms on day four the tale of the mother worm pulls up into her head forming a heart-shaped body that is no longer crimson but has turned into a snow white wax that looks like a patch of wool on the tree it then begins to flick off and drop to the ground looking like snow and they stuck a scripture yeah a man on the process come now let us reason together saith the Lord though your sins be as Scarlets they shall be white as snow but you got to be willing to die though they be red like Crimson they shall be as wool God can be found in nature amen amen a little worm attaching itself to a tree Once in its lifetime to excrete a man some red dye over its its Offspring had to give life to The Offspring on the tree but in order to give life I have to give up my life and let me tell you something ain't nothing can stop that Mama from going to that tree and there was nothing that could stop Jesus from going to a tree God is in nature a couple other things that I'll pick up here and I told you I would not finish this sermon today but this is a good stopping point the uniting time and and sign is where I want to read from praise the Lord I I wanted to just kind of take this journey because you know if you like I said we got an eight man's in the house because if you can see God in nature you can see God in the universe you can see God in his former prophets that have been on scene you got to see God as stealing his man today he's in all these places God is hidden and revealed in Simplicity don't don't miss him now because you you might you might miss God here in the in the message United time and Son brother random says ducks will get together every one of them and rally around a leader and there there are no somehow I don't know how they do it but they know that that certain little Drake is a leader now how is it that ducks can figure it out that this is the one this is the one God has ordained the lead Hallelujah ducks have something in them and brother Brandon even talked about how one little duck he thought he was a leader and he started just honking he got and every time a duck let out a hunk he gonna get a few to follow him everybody gets somebody to follow come on somebody you just you just don't look at it just because somebody's phone because everybody gonna get somebody to follow I don't care what you come up with somebody'll follow you you get out there you say it enough somebody be on your side and sometimes I mean what you got to watch is not just not not just people following but who following right amen because the sons of Bilal will follow you hello somebody right you want to know who following what type of character is this just following amen right so so he said he say ducks will get together every one of them and rally around the leader in there they'll know somehow I don't know how they do it but they know that that certain little Drake is a leader and that little fellow they all get together and rally right around him and Rise right up in the air and never been off that pond now but he'll just go as straight to Louisiana Texas as he can go to the rice fields see before they take their flight to leave their home where they've been born that year they unite together amen there you are rallying around the leader and I just love it and said brother man said God put something in that leader duck he ain't never been to Louisiana one day in his life somehow he got something on the inside that he take responsibility for all the other Ducks y'all follow me I'm following God y'all follow me take off going to Louisiana to get the people to get the other ducks to safety God gave him something it was put in them at Birth he didn't go to school to get this it was he was blessed with it at Birth and the other Ducks was able to recognize it and their lives were spared because they could follow the leader amen I'm going on the trouble of it is is with man he don't know his leader yes sir they rally around a denomination they rally around a bishop or a man but they won't rally around the leader the Holy Spirit and the word right see they say oh well I'm afraid I'll get a little fanatical I'm afraid I'll get uh off on the wrong foot oh there there you are what if the little duck said now I just don't like the way he keeps his feathers I don't believe I'll follow him he'll freeze to death you'll be caught up there if you don't take with the flight as it goes it unites itself together and nature does that geese unite themselves together rallies themselves around their leader they do the same thing I'll tell you about that other that other uh uh uh um duck that thought he was a lead and he took off there I'ma lead some people too he got somebody to follow him he took off going all the way over the Atlantic Ocean and they want to have Ducks get to uh to get over to Europe some kind of way how did this duck get here and by the time he got there most of the ducks that came with him did not make the trip they died on the way there they were not supposed to go across to Europe they were supposed to go down to Louisiana but they didn't know no better they just following and don't know what they following you better know that there's something in that duck voice it got to be something in the hunk honk honk you got to know it hey that's oh okay that that sound right hey you better be careful with that one I don't know where you got that one from you want a good honk huh come on somebody God is revealed in nature [Applause] if you just watch how God do things in nature follow that pattern then you'll be on the right track to God let me bring it home right here did you ever notice bees are swarming bees will unite themselves together before they swarm right around their Queen that's right and where she goes away they go to yes what what do they do they unite before the Swarm exactly every nature fish unite themselves together before the Spring Run and we are in springtime right now my God you can find them what we call humpies of salmon amen look at this now it says herpes of salmon when they uh when they come up there before that run comes in you'll see them by tens of thousands out in the sea coming around and around salt water but they're actually freshwater fish now let's just let's let's let's let's let's just talk about that for a little bit what happened with these salmon is that they went downstream could have put it this way they backslid it they went downstream but in order a man for them to spawn they got to go back Upstream Hallelujah somebody amen and and when we have gone through situations in our life where we backfired away from God Amen we go Downstream we go further and further down but there comes a time maybe Springtime that God begins to do something in the life and and causes them to kind of get together and they don't know why but they they know that that they have to go back Upstream now when you're going Upstream you fight the current hello somebody did you fight against amen criticism you fight against your pride you you fight against say man your thoughts and your ideas you fight against the things that you said in the past you fight against the things that you did you fight everything but I got good news and I got an encouragement for it you fight on do you just fight off if they're swimming Upstream just fight on and keep your sword in your hand and you fight on [Music] but but the salmon has to go back Upstream and as he's as he's as he's swimming amen it's not only he's fighting his own thoughts and fighting his ideas he gotta fight bears It's gotta fight Eagles it's got to fight everything coming to try to take them amen off the journey that that that that salmon got one thing in mind I gotta get back to the place of my birth you see I was born in fresh water but I found my way down here in salt water I gotta get back to the fresh water just like the heart gotta get to the water amen now we see the settlement gotta get back to the fresh water it's going for a purpose they fight through everything to get back to home where they come from that and now you got you got some salmon that they find themselves in situations where they they don't know how they did it but they end up in what they call landlocked Rivers we got us a place where they can't get reconnected back to the mainstream and see you never want to be in something like that if you somehow can still get reconnected to the Rain mainstream you in a good place but the salmon is amen is is now during Springtime is ready to try to go back home and there's a purpose for going back home they fight through everything and get back home because when they get there oh good God almighty they're going there for two things they're going to give birth and they're going to die can I tell you something you gotta you got to be willing to die to yourself when you get back home but you also want to be born again they go there and they get they make it through the bear they make it through the Eagles and they make it through the streams and all the wild going Upstream against against the current they're going against everything in order to get there jumping everything to get there sometimes you see them on little videos and and the bear just standing waiting you got to pass this way in the advantages oh thank you Lord hey I ain't I ain't even got to go fishing I ain't got to get in the water ain't got to do nothing that beer just reached down and grabbed one and just I mean it's just like a smorgasbord for the bear but some salmon make it through that process when they get back they finally get back to them fresh waters I'm back at where I was born to get there and say okay now it's time to give birth and and when they give birth the you know the the the mother salmon is now about to die after she gives birth to her her her baby sound but here's the thing Mama want to make sure that her children are raised in the same environment hello yeah Mama want to make sure her children are raised in the same environment that she was raised in so somehow mama if Mama's running Buck while even right now God is hidden in nature you'll see Mama just beginning to kind of make her way around the church every once in a while trying to get our kids underneath that influence she ain't ready to surrender her whole life but she trying to get her kids around that influence it's just something inside of you that make you have to go back home to the fresh water the same way God put it in a salmon God put it inside of you and no matter where you go you can't get away from this I tell you when you leave this you leave with a tow package but his word just hooked on to you and everywhere you go you're gonna remember everything I said be like I ain't even listening I ain't even stream no Services the service is in you you can run but you can't hide so you might as well just surrender to God oh my God he like the worm attach yourself to a tree and just die die to yourself die of your thoughts daddy ideas God I want you to live inside of me blessed be the name of the Lord that that that's that salmon is going there to die give birth to us it's Offspring them offspring's gonna be raised in that same fresh water because you know when they raise the environment I think they said take them a few years they raise that environment in that fresh water and then after a few years somehow they make themselves out and they start going Downstream but it's so minimum God put it in the silent God put it in a salmon and I mean and I'm gonna tell you I I was there in Alaska I mean these salmon got to come through all kind of things I was in Alaska if me and brother Quentin there they take us out to the Fish Camps everybody got Nets to try to catch these salmon as they're coming through I mean the whole village everybody got their own little spot on the river and they got a net just crossing the whole river and they go out there every day checking them that's just pulling salmon out easy easy fishing because they know they're coming that direction but I'll tell you what some salmon don't get caught by Nets some salmon don't get caught by bear some salmon don't get caught by Eagles some salmon don't get caught by nothing they have to adapt to press through a lot to go back Upstream but it's something that God put in them that makes them want to go Upstream sound like the prodigal son to me I'm tired of living the way I'm living out here I'm gonna go back to my father's house because even the servants in My Father's House live better than the way I live out here what caused that boy to think like that it was an environment that he was in the environment that the parents created before he left he knew it was better to go back there even the servants live better than I'm living out here I'll tell Dad I'll just be a servant I ain't got I know how to mess up your name but I'll just be a servant Daddy coming the boy come back home and dad is so excited to see him kill the fatted calf gave him a ring of gold put him on a robe and say son look I I can always hire servants I can hire them and I can find him but son because my blood [Applause] because my blood is flowing through your veins you can never be a servant even if you tried to be a servant they couldn't let you be a servant they'll still treat you different because they see the blood [Music] and since my blood is flowing through You'll Always Be Sung even though you messed up you still sign even though you don't fail you still daughter nothing could change your status or your position [Music] all I encourage you to just be like a salmon get back to the fresh water be like a heart get down there to where the water's flowing and get just get a drink and Shake That devil off be like the worm and attach itself to a tree and be willing to die as you give birth to a New Life God is in nature let me just finish reading these quotes and then I'll be done for the day every nature fish uniting themselves together for the spring run out in the ocean you can find them big what we call humpies of salmon when they come up there before that run comes you'll see them by the tens of thousands out in in the sea coming around and around salt water but they're actually freshwater fish and here they come right up at the uh up that fresh water to go up for spawning season they go up there to spawn about every four years and die as soon as they spawn and and they know they're going there to die you know you coming back to church to die you know it except the corn a week on the ground and die and rot in a bottle alone but if you're willing to do it it'll bring forth much fruit you know you're coming back to die amen every four years and die as soon as they spawn and they know they're going there to die and you can stop them with nothing they'll jump fish ladders and everything else getting up there knowing they're going to their death but the law of nature makes them knowing that they go up there and spawn in the old and die and the young ones come on and something unites them together then and out into the ocean they go it's uniting it's a law you just can't beat God's law one last quote out of perfect strength by Perfect weakness God is in nature this last statement brother Brandon says here's something to console us he says here's something that encourages I think I actually forgot to uh write this one down sis so just uh put in here is something that encourages here is something that encourages and I'm reading from the sermon perfect strength by Perfect weakness and then here's something that encourages says here's something to console us here is something that encourages out of weakness and humility God chooses the people to build his kingdom out of out of weakness and humility God chooses his people to build his kingdom out of if we ever get to heaven look at this if we ever stand in the presence of God with his church will stand in a bunch of people that's been weak and rejected and cast out by the world and know it nothings we're not know it alls we're knowing nothings isn't it strange that God likened us a sheep is the most helpless thing there is there's nothing so insufficient of Defense than the Sheep a rabbit can run a squirrel a man a squirrel can get in a tree a dog can bite a lion can tear a horse can kick a bird can fly but a sheep stands helpless and that's the way God wants us realize that we're totally insufficient then God takes that person and begins to mold himself into that person's seed then God is in his man see now God takes that person begins to mold himself into that person makes his hands to do what God would have his hands to do make his lips speak what God's lips would speak because they're not his they're Gods he begins to build a character begins to take this weakness to make it to make his own self God is in his people God Likens us the Sheep amen we uh uh uh there's there's so many different animals we can just go through and how God has just designed certain characteristics of those animals and we can see that that that that that ego my god with seven foot wingspan over here and seven foot over there 14 feet all together fly higher than any other bird we see ourselves there amen God God made him that way for a reason he flies alone and and and I've tried to encourage other young people because you know sometimes you see one drop off another one drop off another drop off you got to realize you're an eagle Eagles don't drop off they fly long they fly without encouragement they're just the way they fly they have to they by their self my God my God but you got to be willing to just see yourself in that and then start operating like that amen hallelujah when we were young people coming up people told us things like that and that stuck with us now you tell that the young people they just don't get it Hallelujah sometimes you're gonna have to walk this this Walk Alone yeah family ain't gonna be there with you friends ain't gonna be there with you but God he promised never to leave you nor forsake you walk on Fight On whatever you got to do keep your sword in your hand keep fighting God bless you Church amen [Applause] God is in his man and uh like I told you we had to build up to that part but uh I trust that this would be enough to hold us over till we get back hey man let's have a word of Prayer father we are grateful for the word we thank you for Lord just uh the things that we can see in nature in the universe in other people Lord and nature we see our God on display and how you type yourself in so many things to try to show people how real you are the Infidel went to the Wilderness and in the wilderness as he just looked at a rock how did that rock get there look at that what what could do that he knew that only God could do it he began to Bow right there and sometimes you bring us into places where we realize it has only been you it's
