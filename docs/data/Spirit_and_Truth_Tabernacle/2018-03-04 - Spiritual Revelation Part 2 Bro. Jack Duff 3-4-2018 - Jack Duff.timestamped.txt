[1:11:33] forward to God completing the work a man
[1:11:36] looking forward to God completing that
[1:11:38] work so Amen let's just if we could
[1:11:41] let's let's read here from Matthew 16
[1:11:45] again a man
[1:11:48] praise the Lord
[1:11:53] and I'll start reading at verse 13 I
[1:11:57] believe and it says that says this says
[1:12:07] when Jesus came into the coasts of
[1:12:10] Caesarea Philippi he acts his disciples
[1:12:13] saying who do men say that I the Son of
[1:12:15] Man am they said some say that thou art
[1:12:19] John the Baptist some Elijah the others
[1:12:21] Jeremiah or one of the prophets who
[1:12:24] saith unto them but whom say ye that I
[1:12:27] am then Simon Peter answered and said
[1:12:30] thou art the Christ the Son of the
[1:12:32] Living God jesus answered obscenity and
[1:12:35] blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh
[1:12:37] and blood have not revealed it unto thee
[1:12:40] but my father which is in heaven and I
[1:12:42] say also unto thee that thou art Peter
[1:12:45] and upon this rock I will build my
[1:12:47] church and the gates of Hell should not
[1:12:50] prevail against it and I will give unto
[1:12:53] thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven
[1:12:57] and what summer house shall bind on
[1:13:00] earth shall be bound in heaven and
[1:13:01] whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth
[1:13:03] shall be loosed in heaven then charge he
[1:13:06] his disciples that they should tell no
[1:13:08] man that he was Jesus the Christ a man
[1:13:13] the Lord and a blessing to the reading
[1:13:14] of his word let's just pray a man over
[1:13:17] this probably thank you for this
[1:13:20] opportunity to read the word of the Lord
[1:13:23] but God we are asking now that you would
[1:13:27] take what we have read and Lord make it
[1:13:31] clear reveal God and only way that you
[1:13:35] can to our hearts on today we're
[1:13:38] trusting Lord Jesus that as you told
[1:13:41] Peter it's that flesh and blood have not
[1:13:44] revealed this unto you but my father in
[1:13:46] heaven has and and and we said the gates
[1:13:48] of hell would not prevail against that
[1:13:50] revelation so father help us to receive
[1:13:53] that on today there's some Jesus name
[1:13:55] that we pray a man than a man god bless
[1:13:58] you you can be seated
[1:14:00] a man glory to God
[1:14:10] boy
[1:14:12] so I want to continue our thought we
[1:14:16] started down this journey last week a
[1:14:19] bit installed a spiritual revelation a
[1:14:21] man and and I will continue a man in
[1:14:25] that channel there is some there is a
[1:14:29] number of things that are here in the
[1:14:31] scripture that I pray that the Lord will
[1:14:35] give me the opportunity to get to I
[1:14:38] don't know if it'll happen today but
[1:14:40] we're just gonna keep going a man to see
[1:14:42] where see what the Lord takes us as I
[1:14:46] was ending on last week just bringing us
[1:14:49] back to some recognition of you know a
[1:14:53] tremendous thing that just happened here
[1:14:55] in our land and our nation and that is
[1:14:59] the passing of Billy Graham a man at
[1:15:03] ninety nine years old he he passed away
[1:15:06] and realizing that his ministry was very
[1:15:10] impactful a ministry that went to all
[1:15:14] nations you know he was a tremendous man
[1:15:18] of God tremendous man of God used by God
[1:15:21] for a very specific work right and you
[1:15:27] know with with the ministry that that
[1:15:28] that that's able to I mean with I mean
[1:15:31] able to kind of hit all nations we
[1:15:33] talked about before the internet right
[1:15:36] we talked about before Facebook life
[1:15:38] right we've talked about before you
[1:15:40] don't Instagram or any of those other
[1:15:42] things that we might use to try to or
[1:15:45] YouTube or whatever any any of that you
[1:15:47] know happened this man's ministry had
[1:15:49] impacted the world he was on television
[1:15:52] and all kind of things you know he had
[1:15:54] he had a very unique calling on his life
[1:15:58] and and and we take our hats off to this
[1:16:01] man of God hallelujah then we take our
[1:16:06] hats off to this great man of God and
[1:16:08] and they're very appreciative of it but
[1:16:10] but but but but with spiritual
[1:16:12] revelation a man we have the opportunity
[1:16:16] to see something a little bit more than
[1:16:18] what the average person has seen a man
[1:16:21] and one of those things is
[1:16:23] that the Bible tells us that as it was
[1:16:26] in the days of life so shall it be in
[1:16:28] the coming of the Son of Man and when we
[1:16:31] look at that through prophetic lenses
[1:16:33] right a man we can see that when Abraham
[1:16:37] had visitors and when these three
[1:16:40] visitors showed up to Abraham the house
[1:16:42] Abraham said my lord he did not say my
[1:16:47] lord she said my lord now two visits has
[1:16:50] showed up to Lots house and he said my
[1:16:52] lord
[1:16:54] right I mean he'll he had to and he saw
[1:16:56] Lord Abraham had three and he saw one
[1:17:01] and it's spiritual revelation help us
[1:17:05] that we all see Father Son and Holy
[1:17:07] Ghost as three different people these
[1:17:10] three are one
[1:17:14] so you know these types are there but
[1:17:19] just as a Billy I mean Abraham had those
[1:17:22] visitors two of the Angels went down
[1:17:25] into Sodom and there their ministry was
[1:17:27] to try to pull a man the pull some
[1:17:33] believers out I can't call them
[1:17:35] electives it's hard for me to call him
[1:17:39] that
[1:17:39] right but believers nomina believers
[1:17:42] there was their job to pull him out
[1:17:44] because see the elected was not down in
[1:17:47] there they left it was up where Abraham
[1:17:49] was at right getting it having a
[1:17:52] conversation with God Himself talking
[1:17:55] about what was getting ready to happen
[1:17:58] if I could just if I could just
[1:18:00] interject that there's some things
[1:18:03] that a kid hitter to happen now that
[1:18:05] Billy Graham has been called off the
[1:18:07] scene I'm trying to give you some
[1:18:09] spiritual revelation of some things that
[1:18:12] are getting ready to happen now if you
[1:18:14] want to get all tied up and take it up
[1:18:16] in the thing this world
[1:18:17] that's your barakatuh that I'm trying to
[1:18:20] get ready is somebody I'm trying to get
[1:18:26] ready for shot go in a car see so you
[1:18:31] know as we as we just look at these
[1:18:33] things a man just a little bit more
[1:18:35] closer hopefully we're kind of catch
[1:18:38] some spiritual revelation now I read
[1:18:41] this quote for you at the end of the
[1:18:43] sermon on last week and I'm picking it
[1:18:45] up again and I'm going to go forward
[1:18:46] from there a man if the Lord would allow
[1:18:49] us to this is not approving this word
[1:18:51] and I'm just going directly to paragraph
[1:18:53] 204 a man improving his word
[1:18:56] the Prophet tells us something here says
[1:18:58] never has there been a messenger that
[1:19:01] ever went to the entire church a man
[1:19:04] with his name ending with H a.m. till
[1:19:07] now gr aah am Billy Graham he says there
[1:19:15] has been moody's veni sancte nots Luther
[1:19:20] and so forth but never a H am father to
[1:19:25] nations I thought you his ministry when
[1:19:27] I went all over the world
[1:19:29] father tenacious now remember he is I
[1:19:34] wish I could have underlined match now
[1:19:37] remember not now he's saying that for a
[1:19:39] reason right now remember he is gr a HAF
[1:19:44] six letters just love the way to hold
[1:19:48] his beer do that right he remember he is
[1:19:51] gr aham six letters but a PR 8 is seven
[1:19:58] letters notice they're down there Billy
[1:20:01] Graham going into all the parts of the
[1:20:03] world and coming out of Sodom come out
[1:20:05] Lee the wrath that is to come there is
[1:20:08] no man that I know of in the field that
[1:20:10] has got ahold of God on that one
[1:20:13] of gentrification like Billy Graham does
[1:20:15] he can present it he's not a theologian
[1:20:19] I guess he's a theologian but he's not
[1:20:21] just a powerful teacher but God is with
[1:20:23] him that man will stand there with like
[1:20:26] a Sunday School lesson hold those people
[1:20:28] spellbound he's God's servant of the
[1:20:31] hour
[1:20:32] Tolu the church natural that's in Sodom
[1:20:37] now here's a circum he is a messenger
[1:20:41] but to him to the church natural that's
[1:20:44] in Sodom Oh glory to God and we know
[1:20:47] Church natural is in Sodom
[1:20:50] they got silent preachers preaching to
[1:20:52] him
[1:20:54] we know church that was in Sodom huh
[1:20:58] Amen all you got to look around seals
[1:21:00] through who's in the Christ and I'll
[1:21:07] tell my years ago when I was coming up
[1:21:10] my mama had to watch my mama had to go
[1:21:12] to Senate gotta go to cuantos to Whitney
[1:21:14] because she had the watch the musician
[1:21:20] oh I ain't telling my mother truth you
[1:21:24] have a watch the musician mom Augusta
[1:21:28] come across or if you keep an eye on the
[1:21:31] musician that is charged Sodom and yet
[1:21:35] they are having church on television and
[1:21:42] everything else but Church Sodom listen
[1:21:47] Adam I'm going I'm trying to go further
[1:21:49] he says God's everybody out to church
[1:21:53] church natural that's in Sodom but
[1:21:55] remember there was one church spiritual
[1:21:58] that wasn't in that denominational
[1:22:01] outfit I have a called out group and
[1:22:03] they received a message also and a
[1:22:05] messenger and what was it there's
[1:22:08] learned the thoughts that was in the
[1:22:09] heart God always proves his word now

[1:22:14] he said gr aham six letters he said
[1:22:17] remember that if you say remember gr
[1:22:20] aham six letters how God used this
[1:22:22] ministry you said but that was the
[1:22:24] church natural but there's another
[1:22:26] message
[1:22:26] Church spiritual and they weren't inside
[1:22:29] you don't see no you can't see the
[1:22:36] flickering of the wrists around here a
[1:22:37] man glory to God
[1:22:39] you're not expected and no and no and no
[1:22:41] no leadership position
[1:22:43] who you gonna lead you need to be
[1:22:46] delivered first and unfortunate wretch
[1:22:49] Sodom don't even believe they need to be
[1:22:51] delivered I hate the call names I hate
[1:22:58] to be up here calling names but Nani
[1:23:01] also have another tour name is ik none
[1:23:05] of it none of it that man don't even
[1:23:11] believe you need to be delivered but a
[1:23:14] preacher in the pulpit took of his daddy
[1:23:16] Church Church Sodom hallelujah a man I'm
[1:23:23] trying to get y'all to see some things
[1:23:25] now now now you notice he say he say
[1:23:28] there was gr aham six letters he say
[1:23:32] just remember that but he's never even
[1:23:34] put he never even told y'all what the
[1:23:36] other messenger was with H a.m. at the
[1:23:38] end of his name he's standing there
[1:23:39] preaching and you had to catch him he
[1:23:43] knew his name if you just picked up the
[1:23:44] flier picked up the flight in the end of
[1:23:49] meeting just picked it up you would have
[1:23:51] saw his nameless BR and the here in Los
[1:23:53] Angeles California when he say these
[1:23:55] words he's there and notice nine
[1:23:57] his name is BR AM H a.m. seven letters
[1:24:02] now he never said it but you had to
[1:24:05] catch it because God was using these
[1:24:09] ministries for very specific work one is
[1:24:13] to get a prior ready for the rapture and
[1:24:15] another's just gotta get them out of how
[1:24:17] to wait everything in maybe they're
[1:24:18] gonna go through tribulation that's all
[1:24:21] I think say they gotta make it they'll
[1:24:23] make it through the tribulation but I'm
[1:24:25] not going through the tribulation I'm
[1:24:27] going in a rapture hallelujah let me
[1:24:32] just go a little just a little further
[1:24:33] you know with with these things I mean
[1:24:36] I'm trying to give the church to see you
[1:24:38] know we
[1:24:39] we all church but we really not we all
[1:24:42] say we love the law but we really don't
[1:24:46] it's two different groups it's always
[1:24:49] been that way a man is in it and it's
[1:24:52] always gonna be that way you'll get
[1:24:55] confused when you're looking at these
[1:24:56] groups you don't know which one is right
[1:24:59] and with one wrong go with the one that
[1:25:00] stand with the words hey man they're not
[1:25:04] trying to appease your flesh hey I mean
[1:25:07] we're trying to get people ready to go
[1:25:08] meet God listen so the probably told us
[1:25:12] that there was two phases of
[1:25:14] Christianity now y'all stay with me I
[1:25:15] got it I gotta try to get into something
[1:25:18] here today say yeah to two thirds
[1:25:19] Christianity say one of them is an
[1:25:21] intellectual mental conception but what
[1:25:24] God has said in his word and of Jesus
[1:25:26] Christ by the way of knowledge right the
[1:25:29] other is an experimental experience that
[1:25:33] God has given the man in his heart
[1:25:35] see that's why when you come talkin to
[1:25:38] me nonsense about God did not send a
[1:25:42] prophet it's been revealed in my heart
[1:25:45] some of y'all God gave dreams to you if
[1:25:49] you because she didn't give a dream that
[1:25:51] God gave me I'm standing on that God
[1:25:53] showed me nobody showed you so you gotta
[1:25:59] have your own revelation this is why
[1:26:02] Jesus would speak to the disciples he
[1:26:06] said man say that hottest selling meat
[1:26:10] in there was a good question and they
[1:26:14] gave a group answer some
[1:26:18] Elias some say that Jeremiah
[1:26:22] some say that are willing to profits
[1:26:24] some say this and some say that that me
[1:26:28] may hurt but everybody else was saying
[1:26:32] but the question change the question
[1:26:38] turn and he looked at the mine in the
[1:26:42] eyes he looked at him in the eyes and
[1:26:48] said well who say that I had a son of
[1:26:52] man in can you imagine maybe just I can
[1:26:58] see that the wind just stopped the
[1:27:02] fellas maybe want to stop breathing now
[1:27:05] we can tell what other people say but
[1:27:08] now you make the same personal this
[1:27:13] thing becoming a personal you got to
[1:27:16] have your own individual revelation you
[1:27:20] can tell everyone this one say you can't
[1:27:23] grab it at that and say you gotta have
[1:27:26] your own personal experience with God
[1:27:28] has he revealed himself to you because
[1:27:32] no man can even tell Jesus the Christ
[1:27:35] walked by a revelation from the Holy
[1:27:38] Ghost
[1:27:42] he said I'm shifting now I know what
[1:27:46] they say I got that it's all over the
[1:27:50] internet it's all over internet what
[1:27:54] they say but I'm asking you now who do
[1:28:03] you say that I the Son of Man am this
[1:28:12] just you can see get quiet everybody
[1:28:14] looking at each other kind of like what
[1:28:16] everybody's doing son is glasses a
[1:28:18] question be like just answer the
[1:28:21] question
[1:28:23] brother Jack don't get me now I gotta
[1:28:25] get so I'm just trying to make sure you
[1:28:27] understand I ask the questions if you
[1:28:28] understand hey man
[1:28:31] sometimes y'all help me y'all give me
[1:28:32] insight all right open up your mouth
[1:28:34] Jesus and you cos Jesus one gonna let
[1:28:36] him out of it either
[1:28:37] you know how sometimes you asked if you
[1:28:38] ever been in a job interview
[1:28:40] and you ask the question and somebody
[1:28:42] like that's a good question
[1:28:47] let me come back to that way we don't
[1:28:51] come back to it you ain't leaving this
[1:28:53] interview without answering the question
[1:28:56] I asked the question who do you say that
[1:29:01] I the Son of Man in now that was an
[1:29:03] individual question to individual
[1:29:05] disciples and each one had to give an
[1:29:08] individual answer nobody say nothing
[1:29:12] nobody say nothing and all of a sudden
[1:29:15] the guy pipes up now now now you got to
[1:29:20] understand the guy that pipes up has a
[1:29:23] name and names actually means something
[1:29:27] his name happened to be Peter which
[1:29:31] meant little stone it says it says you
[1:29:43] want to know who what I think well I say
[1:29:48] thou art the Christ the Son of the
[1:29:50] Living God
[1:29:51] oh that Jesus didn't wait for nobody
[1:29:54] else answer he just looked at Peter
[1:29:56] blessed art thou simon barjona and
[1:29:59] notice you say this flesh and blood and
[1:30:02] give this to you but my father in heaven
[1:30:05] has dropped down this revelation they
[1:30:08] saying the gates of Hell will not
[1:30:09] prevail against the revelation that
[1:30:11] you're standing on I got to move on Oh
[1:30:16] Lord Jesus
[1:30:18] Oh God
[1:30:25] the place where that occurred the place
[1:30:30] where that happened the place where
[1:30:31] where Jesus would speak these these
[1:30:34] powerful words to Peter it was very
[1:30:37] significant you see when I went to when
[1:30:42] I went to Israel we went to accessory a
[1:30:45] Philip I that's the name of this place
[1:30:47] that Jesus takes them you know to and
[1:30:50] he's that it's like a 30 mile walk put
[1:30:52] them to get here and when they get there
[1:30:55] in this place this is actually a place
[1:30:59] where there's a lot of idol worship
[1:31:01] happening okay and if I could just if
[1:31:06] you just bear with because the idol
[1:31:08] worship and one of the gods that they
[1:31:10] served was a guy by the name of pan or
[1:31:13] pond or something like that
[1:31:15] apan but but this this this this God
[1:31:18] that they served was half goat and half
[1:31:21] man so in this place where there's just
[1:31:25] it's just full of I and I'm talking
[1:31:27] about it was it was it was some idolatry
[1:31:29] last week I was pretty pretty bowl with
[1:31:33] y'all and telling y'all what happened to
[1:31:35] lot and his daughters in the book of
[1:31:37] Genesis 19 and if you go back and read
[1:31:40] it you'll see that there was a lot
[1:31:41] happen and there was a lot of sin in the
[1:31:44] land in the days of lots a lot of sin
[1:31:48] before before God came down and actually
[1:31:51] pull them out there was so much sin
[1:31:53] before God destroyed he he sent His
[1:31:55] angels down to investigate he said man
[1:31:57] is way to myself the sin of
[1:31:59] homosexuality that is sin right and I
[1:32:04] like I told y'all last week you know
[1:32:06] where all of that with them even getting
[1:32:08] a messenger to come and get them take
[1:32:10] them out of the house I don't know if I
[1:32:13] just my question is if it was you and
[1:32:17] they told you it's time to leave right
[1:32:20] now we've gone destroy the city by the
[1:32:22] time the Sun come up in mourning this
[1:32:24] city gonna be on the y'all need to get
[1:32:26] out now before the structure come what
[1:32:28] would you put in your suitcase
[1:32:31] if it was you what would you carry out
[1:32:36] of the city because what they carried
[1:32:39] out was liquor bottles it showed you
[1:32:45] what was going on in the house live a
[1:32:47] into the refrigerator and in the
[1:32:51] refrigerator the daddy has some licking
[1:32:52] yeah and they took the liquor out rather
[1:32:55] than anything else I don't know what
[1:32:57] else they got but I've known at least
[1:32:58] got liquor because they got me that a
[1:33:02] drunk and had relations with their own
[1:33:05] daddy and had children from them that's
[1:33:08] the Bible that's the Bible and you might
[1:33:11] see a man that is sick it's happening
[1:33:14] every day in this land every day and and
[1:33:17] it's because people not being told that
[1:33:19] a man is the truth about glory to God
[1:33:23] can't send your kids to school because
[1:33:25] the teachers might get them huh I mean
[1:33:34] it used to be we respected those
[1:33:35] positions but now you don't know who
[1:33:38] will do what to your child they end up
[1:33:41] at the truth right but but we got
[1:33:43] spirits now now now now in the land
[1:33:45] where Jesus said these great works you
[1:33:48] say say say flesh and blood have not
[1:33:50] revealed this to you but my father which
[1:33:52] is in heaven type of Dentistry right
[1:33:54] there in that spot there was some
[1:33:55] terrible sin taking place now and the
[1:33:59] Bible speaks against these things but
[1:34:01] you know I just did some history you
[1:34:03] know they they worship they worship
[1:34:05] ghosts
[1:34:06] they worship goats and and and and they
[1:34:10] had all types of oh my it was filth
[1:34:14] things that they would do with goats
[1:34:17] fill where Jesus was telling these
[1:34:20] people that flesh and blood have not
[1:34:22] revealed this to you but my father in
[1:34:24] heaven has jesus said that it was very
[1:34:26] strategic for him to stand in that spot
[1:34:29] where these people sacrificed goats
[1:34:32] worship goats and do all kind of other
[1:34:35] things with goats
[1:34:36] I got children here so I'm trying to be
[1:34:38] very you know really between the lies
[1:34:41] they did all kind of stuff wit go
[1:34:46] but Jesus stands here and in the midst
[1:34:49] of all this sin and say flesh and blood
[1:34:51] have not revealed this to you but my
[1:34:52] father in heaven half is sent upon this
[1:34:54] rock I'll build my church now you know
[1:34:56] when I when I looked at that because if
[1:34:58] you would if you would follow a man that
[1:35:01] the the train of thought you know after
[1:35:04] Jesus leaves this and he goes on there's
[1:35:06] a Matthew 17 where there was the Mount
[1:35:09] Transfiguration experience when you
[1:35:11] after going to Israel seeing how far
[1:35:13] away that was from each other and they
[1:35:15] didn't have vehicles like we have they
[1:35:17] walked see how far it was if I'm like
[1:35:21] man what did they talk about on the way
[1:35:23] from from Caesarea Philippi I'll to get
[1:35:25] them out transfiguration said because
[1:35:26] that was a pretty long well what kind of
[1:35:29] things are they talk about along this
[1:35:30] journey right so you know I just look at
[1:35:33] it and there was some a great great
[1:35:34] thing happened at Mount Transfiguration
[1:35:36] when said this is my beloved son hear ye
[1:35:39] him and then the disciples begin to get
[1:35:41] a little confused like not wait a minute
[1:35:43] before these things happen
[1:35:44] ain't Elijah's above the first come and
[1:35:46] restore all things oh my god y'all be a
[1:35:50] big bear with me right here cuz we got
[1:35:51] some spiritual revelations Garrett of
[1:35:52] the rock and you say yeah I said here
[1:35:56] Elijah Elijah is supposed to come and
[1:35:58] restore all things but I think you alive
[1:36:00] this already come said now revelation
[1:36:05] hit them severe Elijah's for the first
[1:36:07] come but he's already come say now oh
[1:36:09] and the Bible say then they caught it
[1:36:11] that he was talking about John the
[1:36:13] Baptist stay with me here John the
[1:36:16] Baptist was coming amen when he said
[1:36:18] telling about this have already come he
[1:36:20] was identified John the Baptist's
[1:36:22] ministry but when you say restore all
[1:36:24] things he was not talking about John the
[1:36:27] Baptist no the one that say has come
[1:36:31] already was term the Baptist but restore
[1:36:34] things was a future coming and recently
[1:36:37] I was just listening to a quote I didn't
[1:36:38] bring here but it's in I believe it
[1:36:40] might be in the fifth seal or something
[1:36:41] like that
[1:36:42] what brother bottom saying if a person
[1:36:44] it's going to apply John the Baptist
[1:36:47] ministry to the restoration of the
[1:36:49] restoration of all things
[1:36:51] then you have to deny the ministry of
[1:36:53] Jesus Christ if a person applies
[1:36:58] gentleman Baptist minister to the
[1:37:00] restoration of all things then you did
[1:37:03] not the Ministry of Jesus Christ that's
[1:37:06] the brother Jack how do you do that I
[1:37:08] want to tell you if John the Baptist
[1:37:10] restored all things then John the
[1:37:13] Baptist would have been restoring long
[1:37:18] Jesus brought Grace and if John the
[1:37:22] Baptist would have restored on things he
[1:37:24] would restore law which would have did
[1:37:26] not the work in the Ministry of Jesus
[1:37:29] Christ so you cannot put John the
[1:37:32] Baptist in that place there was a
[1:37:34] picture word for future time and that
[1:37:37] was William Branham VRA in H am seven
[1:37:41] letters are you with me see we came to
[1:37:51] know Christ in his work when he stood
[1:37:53] there in that place that day instead
[1:37:56] flesh and blood have not revealed this
[1:37:57] them to you but my father in heaven has
[1:37:59] revealed this do you realize that these
[1:38:02] people offer ghosts not only not only
[1:38:04] that that place they called it the
[1:38:07] literal place this place s abated philip
[1:38:10] i the literal name of the place was
[1:38:11] called the gates of hell the literal
[1:38:14] name and the reason that they call it
[1:38:17] the gates of hell because they felt like
[1:38:18] water who was the way that they got to
[1:38:21] the entrance to hell they felt like you
[1:38:24] have to go through water
[1:38:25] they were sacrificed different animals
[1:38:27] in the water you know try to bring their
[1:38:29] God out of the water all this happened
[1:38:31] in this little place my god
[1:38:33] now why would Jesus be there in that
[1:38:36] place it hit me that here in this place
[1:38:40] of all this pagan worship in them and
[1:38:42] they have a god that's half goat and
[1:38:44] half man well we have a God that only a
[1:38:47] tongue on the day of atonement what was
[1:38:51] required of the priests is that he would
[1:38:53] sacrifice two goats
[1:38:57] one goat would have to suffer for that
[1:39:00] for the cause of you know the people but
[1:39:01] they would take the blood of the one go
[1:39:03] and then put it on the other goats and
[1:39:05] the other goal would have to bear it out
[1:39:07] into the wilderness oh my god and what
[1:39:11] brother branham told us is that Jesus
[1:39:13] represented both goats so here these
[1:39:17] people worshipping a god that's half
[1:39:19] don't happen that but not realizing who
[1:39:22] was in their myths
[1:39:27] he was very strategic about where he
[1:39:30] went
[1:39:31] and not only where he went what he said
[1:39:34] where he went and do you know I mean
[1:39:38] these people thought they had the keys
[1:39:39] to to hell by going through this missile
[1:39:43] passageway their access to real philipot
[1:39:45] but he tells Peter I give you the keys
[1:39:48] to the to the kingdom this was a
[1:39:52] powerful something that happened in
[1:39:54] Jesus ministry oh I hope I'm blown about
[1:39:59] it man I'm I'm not trying to do that
[1:40:04] everything was a strategic y'all
[1:40:07] everything was strategic and you got to
[1:40:09] be able to catch spiritual revelation
[1:40:11] because even even that scripture has
[1:40:13] created a lot of problems in the church
[1:40:15] because they say well if Jesus said upon
[1:40:17] this rock I'll build my church they say
[1:40:19] well the rock was that spot right there
[1:40:20] that he was building up no that didn't
[1:40:22] am nothing to do with it then appeared
[1:40:24] in the the Catholic came on saying oh he
[1:40:27] built this church on Peter unstable man
[1:40:30] like you do do you realize it in Matthew
[1:40:34] 16 the same Peter that was told blessed
[1:40:38] art thou simon barjona flesh the blood
[1:40:40] hath not revealed it unto thee but my
[1:40:42] father in heaven has revealed it to you
[1:40:44] know the Saint Peter just a few verses
[1:40:45] later Saint Peter was told get behind me
[1:40:49] Satan
[1:40:54] the same one bless it not get behind me
[1:40:57] Satan it just goes to show how things
[1:41:01] can change real quick it's a st. Peter
[1:41:07] so God did not build his church on a man
[1:41:10] like that but what he built the church
[1:41:12] on is the revelation of who Jesus works
[1:41:15] and the churches feel built on that same
[1:41:19] revelation you must know who he is today
[1:41:23] and how he's working if you don't catch
[1:41:28] how he's working today you're gonna miss
[1:41:29] a lot you're just gonna be going to
[1:41:31] church and just going through the motion
[1:41:33] but you don't really miss what God is
[1:41:34] really doing in this out alright stay
[1:41:37] with me stay with me
[1:41:39] already got alright when lot receive
[1:41:45] these two angels we're typing Billy
[1:41:47] Graham and we're taking Taipan Oral
[1:41:49] Roberts ministry to the ones that went
[1:41:51] down to Lots group a man pulling them
[1:41:54] out preaching the gospel blinding their
[1:41:56] eyes with the preacher of the gospel but
[1:41:59] there was one that stayed back with
[1:42:00] Abraham's group didn't didn't go down
[1:42:02] the side of that and I believe we're
[1:42:03] part of Church spiritual which is
[1:42:05] Abraham's group you know there was
[1:42:07] something that happened and this is what
[1:42:08] I'm looking forward to this is out of
[1:42:09] Jehovah Jireh and man Jehovah Jireh let
[1:42:12] me just kind of go forward the Lord
[1:42:14] would allows either the message Jehovah
[1:42:17] Jireh says to notice Abraham and Sarah
[1:42:19] they went back to about 22 or 25 years
[1:42:22] old so now just just so that you
[1:42:24] understand what just happened there
[1:42:26] there was a body change after the Angels
[1:42:30] come on the scene and left Sodom there
[1:42:33] was a body change that occurred with
[1:42:35] Abraham and Sarah hallelujah and in
[1:42:38] order for your body to defy gravity
[1:42:41] you're gonna have to also have a body
[1:42:44] change and so if once the Angels leave
[1:42:49] destruction sets in well I know there's
[1:42:52] judgment that's setting in for the world
[1:42:54] but I'm also expecting a change of the
[1:42:56] body for the bride I'm expecting a
[1:43:00] rapture for the brides hallelujah glory
[1:43:04] to God it says listen oh you say
[1:43:06] for the Branum all right now sit still
[1:43:08] just a minute now let's just read
[1:43:10] between the last ones immediately after
[1:43:13] those angels left and silent was burned
[1:43:16] Abraham and Sarah took a long journey
[1:43:18] plumbed down to garage
[1:43:20] that's quite a journey for an old couple
[1:43:22] measure it on your map they went down to
[1:43:24] gerak and here's Sarah now grandma
[1:43:28] ninety years old a little Sun bonnet on
[1:43:32] shaking and Abraham with his long beard
[1:43:37] hanging down the Bible said they were
[1:43:40] both well stricken in age don't try to
[1:43:42] say they live longer and the Bible said
[1:43:45] their bodies were both poor stricken in
[1:43:48] age and here they go down to Quran and
[1:43:51] there's a young king down there named
[1:43:53] Abimelech and he was looking for a
[1:43:55] sweetheart and when he saw Sarah he fell
[1:43:59] in love with her is that right grandma a

[1:47:55] because they might be that spirit don't
[1:47:57] ask them let me go on to read something
[1:48:00] here I'm going back to the revelation of
[1:48:02] Jesus Christ out of church age book and
[1:48:04] Oh Lord Jesus I'm gonna just start here
[1:48:09] in paragraph 13 for I read this last
[1:48:14] week and I'm gonna try to slip a couple
[1:48:16] things in here and i'ma i'ma let y'all
[1:48:18] go if y'all were just there with me I
[1:48:22] read this last week but I want to read
[1:48:24] it again the importance of revelation by
[1:48:26] the spirit to a true believer can never
[1:48:30] be overemphasized
[1:48:31] revelation means more to you than
[1:48:34] perhaps you realize now I'm not talking
[1:48:37] about this book of Revelation in you I'm
[1:48:38] talking about all revelation it is
[1:48:41] tremendously important to the church do
[1:48:43] you remember in Matthew 16 where Jesus
[1:48:45] acts of disciples this question who do
[1:48:47] men say that I the Son of Man a.m. and
[1:48:48] they sent some say that thou art John
[1:48:51] the Baptist some Elias and others
[1:48:53] Jeremias or one of the
[1:48:54] is he setting in but who you think that
[1:48:56] I am Simon Peter answered and said thou
[1:48:59] art the crisis under Living God and
[1:49:00] jesus answered instead I'm him blessed
[1:49:03] art thou simon barjona for flesh and
[1:49:04] blood hath not revealed it unto thee but
[1:49:06] my father which is in heaven and I said
[1:49:08] to thee that thou art Peter and upon
[1:49:09] this rock I will build my church and the
[1:49:11] gates of Hell shall not prevail against
[1:49:12] it the Roman Catholics say the church is
[1:49:14] built upon Peter now that is really
[1:49:16] carnal how could God build a church upon
[1:49:19] a man so unstable that he denied the
[1:49:21] Lord Jesus and curse while doing it hey
[1:49:25] man Christians don't curse if you find
[1:49:29] that you have a Christian that's person
[1:49:31] and they say they love Jesus tell them
[1:49:33] they need to go back to the altar
[1:49:34] Christian's don't curse I don't care how
[1:49:37] bad the situation get Christian's don't
[1:49:40] curse actually Christians just holiday
[1:49:43] Tom David ain't gon curse mm-hmm all
[1:49:49] right listen how could God build a
[1:49:52] church upon us the man so unstable that
[1:49:54] he adopt denied the Lord Jesus and
[1:49:55] cursed while doing it God can't deal his
[1:49:57] church upon any man born in sin and it
[1:50:00] wasn't some rock lying there as though
[1:50:02] God had allowed the ground
[1:50:03] Hallet the ground at that spot and it
[1:50:06] isn't as the Protestants say that the
[1:50:08] church is built upon Jesus it was the
[1:50:10] revelation read it the way it's written
[1:50:13] flesh and blood have not revealed it but
[1:50:15] my father hath revealed it in a pump
[1:50:18] this rock revelation I will build my
[1:50:20] church the church is built on Revelation
[1:50:24] on thus saith the Lord
[1:50:26] Alleluia says how did Abel know what to
[1:50:29] do in order to offer proper sacrifice
[1:50:31] for God by faith he received the
[1:50:34] revelation of the blood Cain didn't get
[1:50:38] such a revelation even though he had a
[1:50:40] commandment he had a commandment to
[1:50:43] worship so he couldn't offer the right
[1:50:46] sacrifice it was a revelation from God
[1:50:49] that made the differs in gave Abel
[1:50:51] eternal life now you might take what the
[1:50:54] pastor says or what the seminary
[1:50:56] teachers and and though it might be
[1:50:58] taught to you with eloquence until God
[1:51:00] reveals to you that Jesus is the Christ
[1:51:02] and that it is the blood that cleanses
[1:51:04] you and that God is your Savior you will
[1:51:07] never have eternal life
[1:51:08] is the spiritual revelation that does it
[1:51:11] now you know he brought up Cain and Abel
[1:51:15] and if you go back in your Bible and you
[1:51:17] see that both of them were going to
[1:51:18] church they were both worshiping they
[1:51:21] were both bringing their best to God
[1:51:23] they weren't I mean there's a statement
[1:51:25] here brother Branham said Cain was a
[1:51:27] believer gotta get it Cain born of the
[1:51:38] serpent was a believer Cain was a
[1:51:48] believer he said he wasn't a communist
[1:51:51] nor an infidel he was a church-going
[1:51:53] ritualistic gentleman church-going
[1:52:00] ritualistic gentleman but he didn't stop
[1:52:04] his comments there he said Annie was
[1:52:06] lost he had all that going for him and
[1:52:10] he still is lost
[1:52:12] see they offered this sacrifice and this
[1:52:15] is what you know you can go to church
[1:52:17] you can see a lot of folks doing this
[1:52:18] and doing that for the Lord all these
[1:52:20] great things that they're doing for God
[1:52:22] and you know for people but they can
[1:52:23] still be lost that's why it's not about
[1:52:27] the great things that we do right it's
[1:52:29] about really having Revelation in your
[1:52:30] heart as to who Christ is right now and
[1:52:32] when you got that revelation then do
[1:52:34] something about that
[1:52:35] hey man didn't do some great things but
[1:52:37] without the revelation you're doing a
[1:52:38] lot you just you just astounding the
[1:52:40] brass and tinkling cymbals Atlantis of
[1:52:43] truth gonna have but Cain and Abel a man
[1:52:46] came with bring his offering of the
[1:52:47] ground and Abel would bring his offering
[1:52:50] of a lamb God accepted Abel's offering
[1:52:53] but he rejected Kings offer and it was
[1:52:55] both to sear and what they were
[1:52:57] presenting to God as they were coming
[1:52:58] all of them come with worship I mean
[1:53:00] both of them coming with a man with
[1:53:01] sincerity both of them just coming to
[1:53:03] try to offer got their best but God
[1:53:05] rejects women accepts the other now and
[1:53:07] he even told Cain he said look if you
[1:53:09] just give me the same thing your brother
[1:53:11] giving me I will accept it I'll take it
[1:53:16] from you if you can give me just go get
[1:53:18] him and kill him and bring her here I'll
[1:53:20] take it
[1:53:21] but it
[1:53:21] not in Cana be able to do that his
[1:53:24] attitude was taken or leave it and you
[1:53:29] know what that stumpy buy attitude today
[1:53:31] take it or leave it
[1:53:33] guess what I'm leaving it right but here
[1:53:41] your King comes with that attitude and
[1:53:43] it got so bad and I get jealous of his
[1:53:45] brother's offering and the first murder
[1:53:48] and the Bible happened over worship
[1:53:59] worship produced the first murder just
[1:54:06] think about it Church this is this is
[1:54:08] much deeper the problem that we have in
[1:54:10] this in the world a man is much deeper
[1:54:12] than gun violence and stuff like that
[1:54:15] it's a condition of the heart it's a
[1:54:20] condition of the heart right and let me
[1:54:23] let me just I mean I don't know if I can
[1:54:25] get it all this but but let me tell you
[1:54:27] people can trick you people can make it
[1:54:31] seem like they Christians people can't I
[1:54:35] mean man well III can tell you do this
[1:54:39] and do that and do this and do that
[1:54:41] and you can do everything that I asked
[1:54:43] you to do but if that thing and coming
[1:54:45] from the heart
[1:54:46] somewhere down the line you don't stop
[1:54:51] doing everything I told you to do
[1:54:52] because it was not an experience in the
[1:54:55] heart it was in the head he was in the
[1:54:59] head people can do it all day long but
[1:55:02] God knows what's in your heart
[1:55:05] Judas didn't do this to the Judas Judas
[1:55:10] was so so so so swaggy he was handling
[1:55:14] the money now you know you can trust a
[1:55:16] man with the money but jesus knew all
[1:55:21] along this man in God but you know what
[1:55:24] Jesus did he kept working with him got
[1:55:26] all the way down to Washington feet
[1:55:28] sitting there watching this feeds into
[1:55:30] don't know different than the rest um
[1:55:32] i'ma watch this P time I watch this P
[1:55:34] time watch it
[1:55:35] come on do this let me wash your feet
[1:55:36] and then they say you know they start
[1:55:38] taking communion is they now somebody
[1:55:41] gonna betray me yeah 12:12 real small
[1:55:46] church somebody about about their
[1:55:47] training well which one is it Lord say
[1:55:50] to one I'm I'm a stop with what we all
[1:55:53] stopping you never reveal who it was but
[1:55:58] it may be whispered a little something
[1:56:00] do this here that what you do do quickly
[1:56:08] why would you say something like that to
[1:56:10] me Judas knew he had already in a set of
[1:56:12] the skin feeling I already made this
[1:56:14] thing you know this thing was planned
[1:56:16] before that might even happen he knew
[1:56:21] exactly before it even happened this
[1:56:24] thing was already planted not what
[1:56:25] you're gonna do good to go do it quickly
[1:56:27] just go ahead get it over with what
[1:56:31] Judas come back when I've told you other
[1:56:34] sub miracles just don't matter you come
[1:56:38] back and they come back with a sores and
[1:56:40] Jesus nothing with y'all this time why
[1:56:41] y'all come get me you know well no you
[1:56:44] know and they got sneaking around at
[1:56:45] night oh lord help us Jesus with that
[1:56:48] one a lot of folks sneak around at night
[1:56:50] a lot of stuff happening at night when
[1:56:53] the Sun go down sneaking around
[1:56:57] hallelujah somebody but here hear that
[1:56:59] you know they come in trying to whisk
[1:57:01] them away and and and Peter said not
[1:57:03] long what you want to do you want us to
[1:57:05] fight and didn't wait financing took the
[1:57:08] Swart BAM shot that man here off and
[1:57:11] here Jesus reaches down put yours up
[1:57:14] picks the man here put it back on said
[1:57:17] couldn't y'all take me away I told y'all
[1:57:19] if that was me on the job I would have
[1:57:21] quit that day this man just saved my
[1:57:24] life and I'm gonna take him to Pilate no
[1:57:27] pilot better come get him this stuff
[1:57:32] Cain and Abel they were both offering
[1:57:36] sacrifices but one was spiritual one was
[1:57:40] Colonel right you can look at Balaam and
[1:57:43] Moses this is I mean I told you that
[1:57:45] this these two churches the two Spears
[1:57:47] have been there all alone Balaam and
[1:57:50] Moses who fundamentally Balaam and Balak
[1:57:54] were offering the same offerings and
[1:57:55] sacrifices that the children of Israel
[1:57:57] were offering right brother Branham said
[1:57:59] it had and the Bible even say they had
[1:58:01] seven altars seven Rams which spoke of
[1:58:04] the first coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:58:06] Christ
[1:58:06] this had seven bullets which represented
[1:58:09] a clean sacrifice and when you go back
[1:58:11] and you look at the Bible a man and just
[1:58:14] pick up that story in scripture when
[1:58:16] Balaam goes approach God aptly said of
[1:58:18] the office say Lord I got my seven
[1:58:20] altars I got my seven
[1:58:21] I got my seven bullets everything you
[1:58:23] asked for I have given you and do you
[1:58:25] know the Bible say that God spoke to
[1:58:27] Valen the Bible accessed a God honored
[1:58:31] it and God spoke back to him what I'm
[1:58:32] trying to tell you can go to church and
[1:58:33] you you will feel this period of gone to
[1:58:35] some of these places yet the genuine
[1:58:37] spirit of God you will feel it but if
[1:58:42] they often work they still off the word
[1:58:43] I'm not going to church for a feeling
[1:58:46] I'm not going to church for emotion I'm
[1:58:48] going to church to get my soul right
[1:58:50] with God Balaam and Moses you also have
[1:58:56] a man the false church in the true
[1:58:58] Church of Revelation 2 and 3 you have
[1:59:00] all of these things but it takes the
[1:59:02] revelation takes spiritual revelation
[1:59:04] for you to understand which group you
[1:59:06] you're part of let me read this other
[1:59:08] quote here and I want to just kind of
[1:59:09] share something I want to share
[1:59:10] Scripture after this amen and I'm gonna
[1:59:13] give you a little test of spiritual
[1:59:14] revelation is that Alright okay
[1:59:17] this is that a revelation of Jesus
[1:59:19] Christ paragraph 16 - so that as I have
[1:59:24] already said this book revelation is the
[1:59:28] consummation of the scriptures it is
[1:59:30] even placed exactly right in the Canon
[1:59:32] of Scripture at the end now you can know
[1:59:35] why it says that anyone who reads or
[1:59:38] even hears it is blessed it is the
[1:59:40] revelation of God that will give you
[1:59:41] authority over the devil I want to say
[1:59:45] that again it is the revelation of God
[1:59:47] that will give you a thority over the
[1:59:50] devil and you can see why they who add
[1:59:53] or take away from it would be curse it
[1:59:56] would have to be so for who can add or
[1:59:59] take away from the perfect from the
[2:00:01] perfect revelation of God and overcome
[2:00:03] the enemy right you can't you can't play
[2:00:06] around with the Word of God Jesus
[2:00:07] overcame with the word you can have to
[2:00:09] take that same word and overcome the
[2:00:11] enemy since it is that simple there is
[2:00:12] nothing of such prevailing power as the
[2:00:17] revelation of the word see and verse 3 a
[2:00:20] blessing is pronounced on those who give
[2:00:22] special attention to this book I think
[2:00:24] this refers to the Old Testament custom
[2:00:26] of the priest reading the word to the
[2:00:27] congregation in the morning you see many
[2:00:29] could not read so the priests had to
[2:00:30] reads to them as long because as it was
[2:00:33] the word
[2:00:33] blessing was there it didn't matter if
[2:00:35] it was red or hurt all right now he says
[2:00:39] nothing of such prevalent power as
[2:00:42] revelation of the word now just real
[2:00:45] quick I'm moving on from that quote see
[2:00:47] prevail means to wrestle with and
[2:00:49] overcome prevail means to wrestle with
[2:00:52] and overcome and sometimes what we find
[2:00:56] is that people will present different
[2:00:58] thoughts on scriptures to you and it'll
[2:01:01] cause you to wrestle right it'll cause
[2:01:04] you to wrestle now it won't one
[2:01:06] particular instance a man we I was
[2:01:10] talking with somebody about the two
[2:01:12] witnesses of Revelation 11 and at the
[2:01:15] time that we got into the conversation I
[2:01:16] didn't have all my ducks in a row all
[2:01:19] right but but I knew that the Prophet
[2:01:22] that shared these things I knew what he
[2:01:23] said so I knew you know there's two
[2:01:25] witnesses of revelation 11 a man was
[2:01:29] both Moses and he lives I knew that much
[2:01:31] right but but when they begin to present
[2:01:33] their argument to me they gave me they
[2:01:35] said Enoch any logic and and and the
[2:01:39] reason behind it safe because Enoch
[2:01:41] never died any larger never thought but
[2:01:43] but the scripture says after the death
[2:01:45] of my servant Moses so they begin the
[2:01:47] counter reason with that and and as they
[2:01:49] begin the rinsing I know the Bible say
[2:01:51] after the death of my Stern Moses all I
[2:01:53] can tell him at that time is that but
[2:01:55] you can't prove me where Moses died even
[2:01:57] even though that the devil's asking
[2:01:59] where his body is right I say you can't
[2:02:01] prove me where that I've known the fiber
[2:02:03] say that purpose I said but Moses didn't
[2:02:05] got Moses did not because Moses was
[2:02:07] there with Elijah on Mount
[2:02:09] Transfiguration let's say it's something
[2:02:10] else
[2:02:11] it's something else there so we just
[2:02:12] sitting there going back and forth they
[2:02:13] say no it's got to be eating like I said
[2:02:15] I can't no it's not it's not it's not
[2:02:17] that's not that's not there as I said
[2:02:20] that's waiting just waiting just waiting
[2:02:22] we talked about revelation 11 and then I
[2:02:24] say now pull up revelation 11 verse 6
[2:02:27] greville at revelation 11 verse 6 I'm
[2:02:29] sitting and we just rest them with it we
[2:02:30] rested them with it right and and after
[2:02:33] that you know because sometimes when you
[2:02:34] when you when you're waiting on God let
[2:02:36] me tell you this when you when you got
[2:02:37] something in your heart that you need
[2:02:38] God to reveal sometimes you gotta wait
[2:02:40] on God to bring it to you
[2:02:42] you gotta wait some time it might be
[2:02:44] years before he actually gives you to
[2:02:46] understand the day but you got to learn
[2:02:48] how to win now look at this revelation
[2:02:49] 11 6 now I didn't I just knew this I
[2:02:53] caught it by revelations now Jefferson
[2:02:55] say these have power to shut heaven that
[2:02:57] it rain not in the days of their
[2:02:59] prophecy and has power over waters to
[2:03:02] turn them to blood and to smite the
[2:03:04] earth with all plagues as often as they
[2:03:06] will now even though it does not have
[2:03:09] the name Moses and Elijah there in that
[2:03:12] scripture the way that we know it's
[2:03:14] Moses and Elijah is because their
[2:03:15] ministries are represented it was he
[2:03:19] larger they have power to shut heaven
[2:03:21] that it rain not in the days of his
[2:03:24] prophecy it was Moses that had power
[2:03:27] over the waters to turn them into blood
[2:03:29] and to smite the earth with all plagues
[2:03:31] as often as she would Moses and Elijah
[2:03:34] their manes of my favorite spiritual
[2:03:37] revelation it helps you to see who they
[2:03:41] are their ministries are their catch it
[2:03:50] by spiritual revelation
[2:03:51] so you give you you wrestle with
[2:03:53] something now this person just brought a
[2:03:55] real good point up to me now I don't
[2:03:56] know about this I don't know about that
[2:03:58] now I'm going somewhere with this
[2:03:59] because there's a lot of good points out
[2:04:01] on the internet but if you don't have
[2:04:02] spirit revelation you just be public for
[2:04:04] anything oh my and I don't told you
[2:04:06] before you can't be traveling you can't
[2:04:09] be trying to answer everybody that's not
[2:04:12] your position somebody be done twisted
[2:04:16] you up
[2:04:17] Ede was trying to answer the serpent he
[2:04:22] got to twist it up he got he got a
[2:04:25] completely twisted even Paul sent a void
[2:04:29] run from it leave it alone foolish
[2:04:33] questions look like a coward when it
[2:04:36] comes to foolish questions Amen Church
[2:04:41] all right that's not your position glory
[2:04:44] to God amen and see every time today I'm
[2:04:48] just trying to help them no no no no
[2:04:50] they got something up their sleeve
[2:04:51] and you keep on threading out in the
[2:04:54] waters
[2:04:54] and you're not gave them points Onegin
[2:04:57] agree with you yet
[2:04:58] how many more points you gotta give them
[2:05:00] alright y'all stay with me I'm going
[2:05:03] somewhere I'm almost I'm almost there
[2:05:05] I'm gonna get you out of them powerful
[2:05:07] words that for the deep sea I'm close to
[2:05:09] closing everybody wake up
[2:05:15] and I say I was closing I'm close to it
[2:05:18] that hot closes close we'll figure that
[2:05:20] out spiritual revelation is powerful
[2:05:25] spiritual revelation is what the church
[2:05:27] is built on there was a man you know as
[2:05:31] I'm wrestling with you know gentlemen
[2:05:33] I'm just kind of talking him about the
[2:05:34] three gods versus one God it's not three
[2:05:37] gods they can't beat three gods the
[2:05:39] Father the Son the Holy Ghost are the
[2:05:40] same person it's one God in three
[2:05:42] offices it's just like me I am a pastor
[2:05:45] I am a father I am a son right I got all
[2:05:50] these titles that a man that go with go
[2:05:52] with my name but my name is jacked up
[2:05:55] praise the Lord right all right but
[2:05:57] don't make me three different people
[2:05:59] because I got three different titles no
[2:06:01] I'm the same person just operating in
[2:06:03] those titles at different times that's
[2:06:05] what happen with the Father Son the Holy
[2:06:06] Ghost now the same guy operating in
[2:06:09] three different offices at different
[2:06:11] times but we don't have three gods we
[2:06:14] don't believe in three cups
[2:06:15] Lord our God is one God that's what the
[2:06:17] Bible say so I was talking this man and
[2:06:19] and he is there now he went back to the
[2:06:23] beginning the revelry I mean Genesis 1
[2:06:25] and when I say let us make man in our
[2:06:27] own image and the action any questions
[2:06:28] say they say is God schizophrenic they
[2:06:33] said cuz they say he's saying let us
[2:06:34] make man out on him because if you
[2:06:36] trying to tell me God was talking to
[2:06:37] himself as he so freely now I'm like
[2:06:40] wait a minute now I know God ain't no
[2:06:42] schizophrenic
[2:06:43] God is God so I was just kind of waiting
[2:06:46] on it waiting on it waiting on it and I
[2:06:49] was sitting a little text here and there
[2:06:51] and then one day I happen to be reading
[2:06:52] the scripture Nehemiah 5 7 can you pull
[2:06:54] that up from a near my 7 me and my 5 7
[2:06:57] now I approached it from his angle
[2:07:01] because he acts was God's gets a pretty
[2:07:03] it because God he said God talking to
[2:07:05] himself let us make man in our own
[2:07:07] well I ran across the scripture that
[2:07:09] states then I consulted with myself
[2:07:12] Nehemiah Nehemiah saying then I
[2:07:17] consulted with myself and I rebuked the
[2:07:20] nobles and the rulers and said unto them
[2:07:22] ye exact Ussery every one of his brother
[2:07:25] and I said a great assembly against him
[2:07:27] I said now if Nehemiah could talk to his
[2:07:29] self and you could say a lamb and if God
[2:07:32] did talked himself you ought to still be
[2:07:34] able to say man if Nehemiah could do it
[2:07:36] why can't God do it but spiritual ever
[2:07:40] revelation go well beyond that I'm just
[2:07:43] working with him on this level trying to
[2:07:44] make him deduce that what he's standing
[2:07:46] on is not not nothing to stand on
[2:07:48] spiritual revelation took us a little
[2:07:50] further and what the prophet told this
[2:07:53] when you want to when you want the
[2:07:54] answer to let us make man in our own
[2:07:56] image it was God talking to the angels a
[2:08:02] spiritual revelation took us on a
[2:08:04] journey where we found out if God was
[2:08:06] talking to the angels then we got to go
[2:08:07] back in Scripture and find where angels
[2:08:09] are men will go back and Daniel the man
[2:08:13] Gabriel right it was it was it was in
[2:08:21] steps since day it was a man that talked
[2:08:24] to his father and his mother it was a
[2:08:27] man right hallelujah and if I could just
[2:08:30] go a little further bring it all the way
[2:08:31] up to the day God had seven angels in
[2:08:35] his hand and every one of those angels
[2:08:38] happen to be a man so if God was talking
[2:08:50] to a minute and it's talking to angels
[2:08:53] and they were in the image of men then
[2:08:55] that would be exactly right
[2:08:56] we'd be made in the image God was a man
[2:09:00] - that's why we saw him in in the book
[2:09:03] of as Melchizedek was something in the
[2:09:06] book of Genesis when it came in Jesus
[2:09:08] Christ it was God as a man right Moses
[2:09:11] saw the backside of a man a church it's
[2:09:14] all in the Bible I'm just just give me a
[2:09:16] spiritual revelation hallelujah
[2:09:19] can I go a little further I want to read
[2:09:23] this I want to read this I want y'all to
[2:09:29] get Genesis 5 we're gonna read this and
[2:09:32] let me read just read one long yeah let
[2:09:36] me read a quote here the fifth seal but
[2:09:39] get Genesis 5 in your Bible I'm gonna
[2:09:40] read something like that and y'all might
[2:09:43] have to get your calculators out and
[2:09:45] everything for us to understand this one
[2:09:50] because this is gonna be a little tough
[2:09:53] Genesis 5 but let me read a quote out of
[2:09:56] the fifth seal before we bring this to a
[2:10:00] close Genesis 5 it says this and in this
[2:10:04] message the fifth seal says and you see
[2:10:06] God is so great so he can humble himself
[2:10:08] a place still a human being can't climb
[2:10:11] down that far see that's all and in
[2:10:15] there and they're trying to find him now
[2:10:16] look they're trying to find him by
[2:10:19] sending the boys to school and getting a
[2:10:21] bachelor part in degree and they're
[2:10:23] trying to find find it by a theological
[2:10:25] terminology of the Bible and they're
[2:10:28] trying to find him by educational
[2:10:30] programs and by organizational programs
[2:10:32] and by beautifying things trying to find
[2:10:36] he's not there at all you just fighting
[2:10:37] a win you're getting away from it if
[2:10:40] they could be big enough to be simple
[2:10:43] enough they could find him in that
[2:10:46] direction by being simple but as long as
[2:10:48] you're going towards wisdom you're going
[2:10:51] away from him now let me get that to you
[2:10:54] so you won't miss it as long as you're
[2:10:57] trying to find God by wisdom like it was
[2:11:00] in the Garden of Eden like it was in the
[2:11:02] days of Moses like it was in the days of
[2:11:03] Noah like it's been in the days of
[2:11:05] Christ in the days of German in the days
[2:11:07] of the Apostles enter this day when you
[2:11:10] try to figure it out and try to find God
[2:11:12] by wisdom you're going further away from
[2:11:15] them all the time you're trying to
[2:11:17] understand it there's no way of doing it
[2:11:19] just accept it so you just believe it
[2:11:22] don't try to understand it now I'm gonna
[2:11:25] give you up something that people trying
[2:11:26] to understand
[2:11:28] oh don't yes I got to read this other
[2:11:33] quote to set this picture up it's
[2:11:35] something trying to understand bear with
[2:11:36] me this is not a great coming revival
[2:11:38] and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit
[2:11:40] and the devil trying to arrest me but
[2:11:43] I'm gonna take my time because I'm gonna
[2:11:45] drop our bomb on the devil I don't want
[2:11:51] y'all to miss it and if y'all do miss it
[2:11:52] if you slept on it go back to the team
[2:11:55] it's on the internet you can watch the
[2:11:57] service listen look at this the great
[2:12:01] coming reviving the outpouring of whole
[2:12:03] spirit now notice this now this quote
[2:12:05] that I'm about to read as a quota has
[2:12:06] come into question because people are
[2:12:10] trying to understand it rather than just
[2:12:11] accept it and believe it the great
[2:12:13] coming revival if I thought I'd write it
[2:12:17] down type in 54 - zero seven one eight a
[2:12:21] and the packraft number is e - 20 okay
[2:12:27] look at this says now as I've just said
[2:12:30] that the antediluvian destruction Noah
[2:12:34] was the sign and Noah had a sign to
[2:12:38] start on when he seen Enoch was taken up
[2:12:41] he not was taken then Noah was time for
[2:12:45] nor to start for he knew that that would
[2:12:48] be the sign of his beginning and then
[2:12:50] the end would be near and Enoch of
[2:12:52] course was a type of the rapture group
[2:12:54] of the church and nor the type of the
[2:12:56] carried over or the length of the Jews
[2:13:00] that would be cared through the
[2:13:01] tribulation period and we're now living
[2:13:03] in that day see that angels left us see
[2:13:07] we're living in that day where we can
[2:13:09] expect the rapture now right now here
[2:13:11] we're going back because as it was in
[2:13:12] the days of Noah so shall there be in
[2:13:13] the coming of the son of man now brother
[2:13:15] Branham is saying that I need y'all to
[2:13:17] catch this alright because he said here
[2:13:19] as when when he's seen Enoch was taken
[2:13:22] up Noah but it's time to know where to
[2:13:25] start
[2:13:25] on the ark when Noah seen Enoch was
[2:13:28] taken up it was time for Nora to start
[2:13:31] on the earth now I'm gonna prove to
[2:13:33] y'all by scripture that Noah did not see
[2:13:36] Enoch
[2:13:38] I'm gonna prove it to you by Scripture
[2:13:41] open up your Bible I'm gonna prove to
[2:13:46] you this morning that Noah did not see
[2:13:51] Enoch so yeah looking at me like where
[2:13:56] in the world pastor going since hang
[2:13:58] that with me just for a little bit no I
[2:14:01] mean this is Jim says 5 verse 21 and
[2:14:05] enoch lived sixty and five years and
[2:14:08] begat methuselah and Enoch walked with
[2:14:12] God after he begat methuselah three
[2:14:14] hundred years and begat sons and
[2:14:16] daughters
[2:14:16] and all the days of Enoch were three
[2:14:19] hundred sixty and five years which
[2:14:23] represents our 365 day calendar okay
[2:14:26] Enoch was the Bible says in verse 24 and
[2:14:29] Enoch walked with God which was a
[2:14:30] rapture he not walk with God and he was
[2:14:33] not for God took him he not representing
[2:14:37] the bride that was ready for a rapture
[2:14:38] okay he not walk with God and he was not
[2:14:41] for God took him and Methuselah lived a
[2:14:44] hundred eighty of seven years and he
[2:14:46] begat lamech and Methuselah lived after
[2:14:49] he begat lamech seven hundred eighty and
[2:14:52] two years and begat sons and daughters
[2:14:54] and all the days of Methuselah were 969
[2:14:58] years and he died and then go on and
[2:15:02] land and lame and and Lamech lived in
[2:15:05] hundred and eighty-two years and begot a
[2:15:07] son and he called his his dog named Noah
[2:15:10] saying this saying that this same shall
[2:15:13] comfort us concerning our work and toil
[2:15:14] of our hands because of the ground which
[2:15:17] the LORD hath cursed now I did some
[2:15:21] calculations I pulled out my calculator
[2:15:23] and I found that the Bible told us that
[2:15:27] Enoch lived sixty-five years before he
[2:15:29] forgot he begat his first child and that
[2:15:32] was Methuselah Methuselah would have
[2:15:35] lived a hundred and eighty-seven years
[2:15:37] before he begat his first child which
[2:15:39] would have been lame aunt Lynette lived
[2:15:42] a hundred and eighty two years before he
[2:15:45] forgot his first child which was no one
[2:15:47] now we calculate this see
[2:15:50] five plus 187 plus 182 equal 434 years
[2:15:58] but we just was told that Enoch walked
[2:16:02] with God at three hundred and sixty-five
[2:16:04] years so you have to subtract 365 from
[2:16:09] 434 and you get 69 years that's missing
[2:16:14] so it was that but that also it tells us
[2:16:17] that Enoch was gone
[2:16:20] 69 years before Noah came on the scene
[2:16:25] but the quotes in it that Enoch I mean
[2:16:29] that Noah saw Enoch and when he saw
[2:16:32] Enoch leave he knew it was time for him
[2:16:35] to get working on the art but Enoch was
[2:16:38] gone 69 years before Noah came on the
[2:16:43] scene are you with me
[2:16:50] so we were just reading the Bible was
[2:16:52] true how can eat knock I mean how could
[2:16:55] Noah seee not leaf
[2:17:04] huh
[2:17:06] is the profit wrong here and we find
[2:17:10] something wrong with the message huh huh
[2:17:14] revelation that's the only way it could
[2:17:18] be by spiritual revelation my question
[2:17:21] to you let me hold on I got some
[2:17:26] questions how with Noah see Enoch
[2:17:28] if Enoch had walked with God six nine
[2:17:31] years before Noah was born right the
[2:17:35] only way I wrote this down brothers like
[2:17:38] them tapped into it the only way Noah
[2:17:40] was a prophet and he would have to catch
[2:17:43] it by spiritual revelation I just want
[2:17:47] you to imagine this when guys when
[2:17:49] brothers are a man or whatever went for
[2:17:52] a walk back in them days not just a walk
[2:17:54] when they went to go visit somebody
[2:17:55] right it might be days you know that the
[2:17:59] wise men took two years two years that
[2:18:03] they were away from their home
[2:18:05] two years to get to Christ we don't know
[2:18:07] how long it took for them to get back
[2:18:08] home the Bible don't tell us that but
[2:18:11] two years just to get from where they
[2:18:13] was to get to Christ went where the star
[2:18:16] was it took two years so when they won't
[2:18:19] it took a lot longer back in those times
[2:18:20] a man can live on or on a walker own
[2:18:24] attorney might not make it back home for
[2:18:26] years I want you to think about that
[2:18:29] might not make him out back over years
[2:18:31] now when Enoch does not show up for
[2:18:35] years who was it that put out a missing
[2:18:38] persons report did his wife know that he
[2:18:44] was gone did his children know that he
[2:18:48] was gone did the church know that he was
[2:18:51] going how did they know that Enoch
[2:18:53] walked with God Lord I'm talking about
[2:18:59] I'm sure I'm sure but now I'm talked
[2:19:01] about before this was written how did
[2:19:02] they know I know how you know but I'm
[2:19:07] asking how did they know
[2:19:13] spiritual revelation you know what you
[2:19:15] read in your Bible but I just read their
[2:19:18] Genesis you know who wrote that you know
[2:19:21] who wrote it
[2:19:22] Moses had it Moses know
[2:19:29] how could he tell us that Enoch walked
[2:19:34] with God
[2:19:35] how did Moses know that how how can he
[2:19:42] put the year on it and all these other
[2:19:43] thing spiritual revelation drive down
[2:19:48] and show Moses what to write about email
[2:19:51] and a spiritual relation that shorts of
[2:19:55] Moses then spiritual relation consults
[2:19:58] and no one is relation with this our
[2:20:19] revelation flesh and blood don't reveal
[2:20:27] this to you but my father in heaven he
[2:20:31] revealed it to you and upon this rock
[2:20:34] the rock of spiritual revelation I will
[2:20:37] build my church and I don't care who
[2:20:40] pulling away and who doing listen who
[2:20:42] got isn't who doing Annie
[2:20:43] I don't care the Bible say the gates of
[2:20:47] Hell will not prevail I'm standing on
[2:20:53] the rock of spiritual revelation the
[2:20:59] prophet went wrong see a prophet can
[2:21:01] tell you what another prophet is seeing
[2:21:05] and only a prophet can do that you put
[2:21:13] your put your calculator out you might
[2:21:14] as well throw it away you missing 69
[2:21:18] years but in God's mind him years don't
[2:21:22] mean nothing God allowed North if not
[2:21:24] maybe they was asking now your
[2:21:26] great-great Grandaddy he just never seen
[2:21:29] them again don't know what happened to
[2:21:31] him
[2:21:32] we don't know
[2:21:33] but God would have to reveal it oh wait
[2:21:35] he people just don't short missing but
[2:21:39] maybe God let him catch a vision he walk
[2:21:42] with God and I care in my home and Noah
[2:21:44] with that revelation knew that it was
[2:21:46] time to get busy
[2:21:48] to work on art I'm trying to give you
[2:21:51] all a revelation I'm trying to give you
[2:21:54] all a revelation that second angel has
[2:21:56] left he's gone it's time to get busy
[2:22:03] yeah that's what it's all about it's
[2:22:07] time to get busy all this other stuff is
[2:22:09] nonsense it's nonsense it's not gonna be
[2:22:12] in heaven a lot of stuff that we
[2:22:15] consider important here will not be in
[2:22:16] heaven I was so glad brother Troy sent
[2:22:19] that quote to the brothers group and
[2:22:20] talked about even have we put out put
[2:22:22] our work some time before God and we
[2:22:24] think that's it a good excuse you know
[2:22:29] you can have it you can have an excuse
[2:22:30] and you can also have a good excuse
[2:22:33] and some of us think that our good
[2:22:36] excuse is I got Church I mean I got work
[2:22:40] I got school I got this I got that but
[2:22:45] my question is do you have God cuz you
[2:22:49] know what he always seem to get the
[2:22:50] short end of the stick and then he get
[2:22:54] told you understand I understand that
[2:22:59] you got other gods before me and what I
[2:23:03] said it don't put nothing else before me
[2:23:05] the most important thing you can do is
[2:23:08] have a relationship with God I'm not
[2:23:10] talk about the Sunday morning
[2:23:11] relationship we have any time these
[2:23:13] church doors over the else to try to be
[2:23:14] here

[2:23:34] get on and get attached get into this
[2:23:38] word Church this is more important to
[2:23:41] you than anything I'm just being honest
[2:23:46] with you we don't have that much longer
[2:23:49] when when when those two angels left the
[2:23:52] land and that day destruction was
[2:23:53] immediate there's just I don't know
[2:23:55] what's gonna happen here y'all can see
[2:23:57] you know we ain't got a necessarily
[2:23:59] worried about somebody coming from the

[2:27:25] let's pray
[2:27:26] [Music]
[2:27:30] God is gonna take more you're certainly
[2:27:37] calling for it but that spiritual
[2:27:40] revelation we gonna miss what you're
[2:27:42] doing this out of the Prophet told us
[2:27:44] that we'll sit right here
[2:27:45] in this church it'll go right through so
[2:27:47] we won't even know it Lord I don't want
[2:27:52] to be that way I don't want to miss that
[2:27:54] I wanna be so caught up in the things of
[2:27:56] this world that I miss it that's that's
[2:27:59] not what it's all about God the Satan
[2:28:03] this has so many distractions so many
[2:28:05] things that he has to offer to try to
[2:28:08] pull our attention this way and pull our
[2:28:09] attention that way but lord I help me to
[2:28:13] keep my eyes my heart centered on you
[2:28:17] lord I want to love you more than I ever
[2:28:20] have before I want to serve you I want
[2:28:25] to live for you help me God to surrender
[2:28:29] my thoughts surrender my wheels
[2:28:30] surrender my way this world is not my
[2:28:33] home as I'm looking here the sign that's
[2:28:37] before Billy Graham being laid to rest
[2:28:41] on Friday pass your prophet told us that
[2:28:46] that man's ministry meant something
[2:28:48] it meant a lot to the church nominal and
[2:28:52] they might not even realize how you're
[2:28:54] known at that man's ministry all over
[2:28:56] the world he was well known all over the
[2:28:59] world but most people probably have no
[2:29:02] idea why you're known at that man with
[2:29:04] such a simple message of repentance but
[2:29:08] how you're anointed Hemnes to preachers
[2:29:09] and even presidents leaders of countries
[2:29:13] with will find themselves seeking out
[2:29:15] his counsel what a man but now that he's
[2:29:19] gone help us to turn our attention our
[2:29:22] Father to what you're doing in this hour
[2:29:25] don't let these things
[2:29:28] don't let him come through somebody not
[2:29:30] realizing don't help but lord help us
[2:29:33] got to get our eyes that like the song
[2:29:36] said earlier turn your eyes of Jesus
[2:29:38] look full in his wonderful face the
[2:29:41] things of this earth will grow strangely
[2:29:43] dim in the light of his glory in Greece
