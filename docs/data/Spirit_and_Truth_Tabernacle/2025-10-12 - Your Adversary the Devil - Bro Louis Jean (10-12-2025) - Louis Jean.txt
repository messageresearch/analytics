They ran in the dry places like a river. We need some of that. And for he remembered his holy promise and Abraham his servant. And he brought forth his people with joy and his chosen with gladness. Now, this is the part that encouraged me. and gave them the lands of the heathen, that they inherited the labor of the people, that they might observe his statutes and keep his laws.

[Music] The word of God declare when you come to the house of the Lord, we are to make what? &gt;&gt; Not to be joyful and shout unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; My song will know make some noise for the Lord. &gt;&gt; Make some noise. Many time I heard brother and sisters when they come to sing a song you know I want to sing I don't have a good voice. No never he never say that. He say make noise for the Lord. Say shout unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; Just Lord. God bless you all. Thank you for inviting me to come to share the word of the Lord with you this morning. &gt;&gt; Uh usually before I start preaching I have my family with me. my wife, her sisters, and also her husband and my daughters. They're on the back with me. So, thank you very much. Yeah. So, before we open the word of the Lord, let me set up how we're going to do it. &gt;&gt; Usually at church, we don't come to listen to the preacher. We all come together to work together. Amen. You &gt;&gt; see because we are partakers. No assistant. &gt;&gt; You don't come to assist service. You come to partic of the service. &gt;&gt; Bring something. &gt;&gt; We all have to labor together. &gt;&gt; Don't let one person do all the pull up. Pull up. You just sit. No, no, no. &gt;&gt; I don't mind you don't say amen. That's no problem. I don't call for amen. No, no, no, no. The word we call for amen. When the word come forward, you say I got to say amen. That's the word of God. &gt;&gt; That's the will of God. So understood. I don't mind if you don't say amen. But when the word will of Lord, say amen for the word, &gt;&gt; not for the man, but for the Lord. Amen for the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's uh Brother Jerry, if you're going to pray for me, buddy. Amen. as bowhead. Brother Jerry, he's going to pray for us. [Music] &gt;&gt; Dear heavenly father, oh Lord Jesus, what a precious day this is, Father. Oh God, this is the portion of the service, Lord, where the word meets the word. And Father God, we thank you, Lord, that the ground has been prepared, Lord God. &gt;&gt; The foundation has been set, oh Father God, &gt;&gt; and Lord, we just ask that you would speak one word to us, Lord. &gt;&gt; One word will make the change, Lord. One word will make the difference, Father God. &gt;&gt; So, Father God, anoint our brother even now, Lord God. Have the preeminence in him, Lord Jesus. And Lord, may you take over, Father God. That every spirit in this place would be under your subjection, Father. That every word that will come forth, Lord, will bring forth life. &gt;&gt; Father God, I pray that you would have your way even now, Lord. And God, we thank you for your word. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother. Amen. We first Peter 5 verse 8. just one verse only. I can see that. He says, "Be sober, be vigilant, because your adversary, the devil, as a war lying, walked about seeking whom he may devour." &gt;&gt; Thank you. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Our subject this morning is your adversary, the devil. &gt;&gt; Do you have an adversary? Do you have one? &gt;&gt; You think so? Sometime Jack brother and sister lives there on the millennium. &gt;&gt; So I mean they thought Satan is bound for thousand years. So that mean hey I can do whatever I want. There's no devil. No. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the Lord want you to be be vigilant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be sober. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because Leody at church is is lukewarm. &gt;&gt; They're not hot, no cold. They come to church. Yes. Listen to the preacher. Sometime they say, "Amen." Sometime they done. &gt;&gt; So they don't care sometime. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; But the Lord want you to be vigilant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be sober. &gt;&gt; Because we have an adversary. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The devil. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometime I always told my young brother and sister in the church, don't think your mother, your father is your adversary. &gt;&gt; You have an adversary too. Amen. &gt;&gt; You have an adversary too. &gt;&gt; Have to be mindful of adversary that we have. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Most of the time they say, "Well, mommy, daddy, you always nagging at me. You my adversary." No, not just your man. &gt;&gt; Not the pastor, not the minister. &gt;&gt; We are not the adversary. &gt;&gt; We there to work with you. &gt;&gt; So that's why we're going to find out who the adversary. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Uh like I said, we working together. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask question, you answer. So you can move on. &gt;&gt; When God created heaven and earth, the Bible say that uh he create the angels. You know all that. Uh I don't know if you read that but sometime I read the Bible but I never see where somewhere where the Lord says God created a devil. Amen. &gt;&gt; The word of God say that &gt;&gt; God created a devil &gt;&gt; or Satan. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; No, let's from the word of world see where on the Bible the adversary began because he had to have an origin somewhere. &gt;&gt; All the angels that created were perfect, were great, come to humanity first, second day, on the sixth day, everything was good. &gt;&gt; Nowhere in the Bible say God create a devil. &gt;&gt; Wow. Wow. &gt;&gt; Wicked demon. He never say that. But &gt;&gt; where did it come from? &gt;&gt; Where that devil come from? &gt;&gt; So let's uh let's go to let's go to Ezekiel 28. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Let's run out that first. Ezekiel 28. So you're going to read with me also. Uh I don't know if they can project it for us. I don't know how this works. But to make it eases, Ezekiel 28:12 &gt;&gt; uh what do you want to say with that? &gt;&gt; Verse 12. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. &gt;&gt; Yes. All right. You all follow with me. Son of man, take up the lamentation upon the king of Tyrus. But say that when the prophet was talking about that king, &gt;&gt; it wasn't the man you see physically, &gt;&gt; it was the spirit, &gt;&gt; the spirit of that man. &gt;&gt; It was talking. It says verse 13. No, no. Thus say the Lord God that seal us all the full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. &gt;&gt; That angel was perfect in beauty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says that uh verse 13 that has been in Eden the garden of God. &gt;&gt; Nowhere we find Tyrus in Eden &gt;&gt; but we see the devil &gt;&gt; and the serpent. &gt;&gt; We see that. So when God create that earth that being he wasn't like um many time you saw a picture with a long tail &gt;&gt; frogs make you afraid of the no the death frog &gt;&gt; it's not that ugly &gt;&gt; the B say it was a beauty &gt;&gt; beauty itself &gt;&gt; so don't to attract people distraction &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; but when he create that He wasn't called the devil. &gt;&gt; No, he was called the devil. Now, how can become the devil? &gt;&gt; How can we become the devil? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; I'm going to show you uh with the message in the Bible that Abraham said, uh let's go to Isaiah 14. &gt;&gt; Uh we see that beauty in that angel, he was perfect in beauty. It wasn't like ugly like sometime we ping the devil ugliest person. No, it was beauty perfection in that angel. &gt;&gt; But now what happened? I come from that position. He came down on earth. &gt;&gt; Now let's go to Isaiah 14. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 14. We're going to see something. Follow with me. We all going to be in the same page together. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Uh Isaiah 14. Uh okay, let's go way to to verse 12. How are the fallen from heaven? Oh, Lucifer. &gt;&gt; Lucifer. The reason you see that King James use the word Lucifer in the other version, they use the morning star, the boy morning star. They don't use Lucifer because the Bible when there was first translated from uh Hebrews &gt;&gt; there was uh and in Latin &gt;&gt; the Latin. So they use the word Lucifer that mean looks mean light fur mean bear I mean light bear lightbear Lucifer. &gt;&gt; So that mean they keep that word Lucifer &gt;&gt; from that version and they use it. So that mean that angel was the angel of light. &gt;&gt; He was perfect. &gt;&gt; He wasn't the devil like oh no. &gt;&gt; So &gt;&gt; and also the prophet says uh let me see in adoption uh everything every angel God created them with the free will. &gt;&gt; They have the choice &gt;&gt; to choose. Now let's see in adoption what he says that Lucifer had the same choice. &gt;&gt; Oh wow. &gt;&gt; That's why he come from heaven and down on earth the human being when he create Adam and Eve he give him the same right. &gt;&gt; You have perfect freedom. I mean I mean uh uh free will you can choose right wrong whatever you want. &gt;&gt; Same thing as Lucifer and the angels. They have a right to choose. &gt;&gt; God didn't force them to worship force them. No, no, no. You have a right. &gt;&gt; Same thing for our believers. &gt;&gt; We have a right this morning. &gt;&gt; If you want to worship, fine. If you don't want to worship, just watch. Hey, watch. &gt;&gt; But you have a right. &gt;&gt; You can do whatever you want. But you know that there's some beings created to worship the Lord. We worship &gt;&gt; because we are worshiper. We don't come to watch and see what's going on. No, no. We don't come to watch. We're not spying nobody. No, no. We come to worship the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; No, you don't do that. Spying people or I saw you you wasn't what worship the Lord. &gt;&gt; What were you doing? Take your time watching somebody. &gt;&gt; Watching somebody not praising the Lord. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; That's why you came to to the church for &gt;&gt; watching people. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. Come on. You wasting your time. &gt;&gt; I don't have time to watch what people do. I've come to worship my Lord. Sing to the Lord. Now let's go to uh adoption uh 60518 uh adoption 2 paragraph 84ise. &gt;&gt; Yes, you're going to see that they have uh uh the same uh free will that we have today to choose. Satan has that also. &gt;&gt; Yes. belly me a bit because I'm not too text [Laughter] but sometime okay that's 1960518 paragraph 84 uh we're going to see that together and I will show you where the prophecies devil also I mean I mean Lucifer he has a right to choose right and wrongowmen That's every human be at the same right also &gt;&gt; paragraph 84. Let me find exactly what I want to go. Uh okay. If you go down to that code, what the prophet say that God at the beginning before the angel was even made going down. It says that Lucifer no before that. Okay. God infinite mercy. He saw that Lucifer would do that if he created this. He'd put them onto a free moral agency. That basis &gt;&gt; and you still there. That's right. The tree of right and wrong said before every one of you. Of course, you make your choice that come on earth to Adam and Eve. Lucifer was the first one to take the wrong word. was the first one. &gt;&gt; He had a choice. He see this is my choice. He use it but it take the wrong word. &gt;&gt; And uh but let's go back to the Bible to see what he did that that being Lucifer was never called the devil. He called the light angel of light. But how can you become Lucifer? to kick him out and we find out that let's go to back again to Isaiah 14 was called Lucifer verse 12 or Lucifer then had cut down to the ground which did weaken the nations but back in Ezekiel uh 28 the Bible said that he was in heaven until there find iniquity iniquity that sin that kick him out. But now Isaiah going to explain exactly what he did that the reason that God put him down. Let's go to verse 14. No, verse 13. Oh Lucifer 13. For thou said in thy heart, this is the problem now. for the harsh enter. I will ascend into heaven. &gt;&gt; We don't find five things he said that kick him out. Only that for me. First thing, I will ascend into heaven. That's one. Second, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God. Three, I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the side of the north. Verse 14, I will ascend above the high of the cloud. That mean four, I will be like the most high yet that shall be brought down. yet that shall be brought down to hell &gt;&gt; to the side of the pit. &gt;&gt; Glory sir. &gt;&gt; That's why they put kick Lucifer out. &gt;&gt; He was there as the angel but now he became so proud. &gt;&gt; See now we are a high kingdom. He start making uh recruitment in in heaven. Angel. Come on. Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Same thing you see sometime in church. &gt;&gt; Somebody got a little revelation. Got a funny revelation. Find somebody doors on the side. Talk to them &gt;&gt; all of a sudden recruiting recruiting in the church. But &gt;&gt; this is what happened after recruiting all the angel. I mean most of the angel with him. The Bible say oneird. But now God say well you cannot stay in heaven but you got to go down. He said me and no way I'm not going. No way. Call his angel say where going to fight today. I mean they call some you know when you live in the house they ask you you don't pay your rent you have to kick out call for eviction. You said no I'm going nowhere. The shave has to come to bring everything outside, &gt;&gt; kick everything out. &gt;&gt; What happened to Lucifer? &gt;&gt; He didn't want to leave. &gt;&gt; Nowhere. Stay there. I said, "No problem. Let's find to uh uh go to uh Revelation chapter 12. See how they kick him out from heaven." &gt;&gt; He didn't want to leave. He said, "No, I'm going nowhere. I will stay there. I tried to overthrown the kingdom of God to make my own kingdom. Want to be a kud in heaven. Yes. In uh Revelation 12. Uh let's read verse three. And there appeared another wonder in heaven, and behold, a great white dragon having seven heads and 10 horns, seven crowns upon his head. So, we're not going to talk about that. Let's verse three. And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and it cast them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman, which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born. going to skip that. Go to verse uh uh verse uh 7. There was war in heaven. Can you imagine that? &gt;&gt; In heaven there's war in heaven. But &gt;&gt; who who was in charge of do the party? war in heaven. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Michael and his angel fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angel. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Lucifer say I'm going nowhere. Nobody can kick me out. &gt;&gt; You're going to find out. Michael army soldier. He said you leaving. &gt;&gt; You got to leave. &gt;&gt; Say no. &gt;&gt; No, I'm not leaving. Frightening. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The Bible say yes. No. No. They fight. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I mean, they use trust him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Whatever they use them &gt;&gt; to kick him out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Uh, Michael fought against the dragon. Dragon fought and his angel and prevailed. Lord, see that you're not stronger. Satan, he been defeated in heaven. &gt;&gt; Preven. Neither was their place found anymore in heaven. &gt;&gt; And the great dragon was cast out that all certain certain called the devil and Satan. That's why he got his name. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When he was in the rebellion against God, they kick him out. You Satan, you the devil. &gt;&gt; But before he was Lucifer, &gt;&gt; they lied. But now since you are uh uh conceive iniquity in your heart, &gt;&gt; you rebel against God, you rebellion, &gt;&gt; you a devil. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You're a Satan. &gt;&gt; But you rebellion. &gt;&gt; That's why brother and sister, if you're in rebellion with God, you sat with the devil. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Rebellion. &gt;&gt; Rebellion with God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And uh from now on he give this name of Satan the devil. &gt;&gt; But in the beginning it wasn't Satan. It was Lucifer &gt;&gt; the lie. &gt;&gt; But now it was a kick from heaven. He came down on earth. He says now war onto earth. &gt;&gt; I'm going to wage war now against earth. Because when he knew that God has some creature on earth, he said, "Well, even angel I fought with them in heaven." How about human beings? &gt;&gt; It going to be easy. &gt;&gt; He thought it going to be easy. It could be easy. &gt;&gt; See, therefore, the purpose that he has in heaven, he doesn't fully uh accomplish that. He said, "Now on earth, I'm going to find some subject." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I have my kingdom too. &gt;&gt; Wow. I cannot have the kingdom upstairs, but now on earth &gt;&gt; can have my kingdom. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Therefore, &gt;&gt; there be war. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Fight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God in heaven and Satan on earth. &gt;&gt; He say I establish my kingdom. &gt;&gt; My God. &gt;&gt; Two power. &gt;&gt; Every one of them are recruiting. God want people to follow him. Satan also want people to follow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what Satan use? He use tactic. He use rules. He use any kind of um of of trick &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; to get you started. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ come take the form of a man &gt;&gt; to fight the devil. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know that Calvary, he beat the devil at Calvary. Right. &gt;&gt; Go down and under the earth. &gt;&gt; Beat him again. &gt;&gt; Swimming everywhere from heaven, earth down. &gt;&gt; Victory all over. &gt;&gt; Victory all over. &gt;&gt; So now Satan say, "Huh? &gt;&gt; Okay, I'm not done yet." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not done yet. &gt;&gt; Because remember, Satan is spirit. &gt;&gt; That's right. You come and the body of flesh. &gt;&gt; So that mean that the reason Paul say we're not fighting against blood and flesh. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We wrestle against spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's why Peter said be sober, &gt;&gt; be vigilant, &gt;&gt; your adversary with the devil. &gt;&gt; But imagine that with your flesh you can fight the devil. Say no. &gt;&gt; No. What the Lord did, he became man, human. But inside that man dwell the fullness of the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The fullness of the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; When Satan thought, I'm going to hit that man. He didn't know he was God in flesh. &gt;&gt; He didn't know he was God in flesh. &gt;&gt; God says, Satan, I got something more um to to to hit you back because I'm not done with you. That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm not done with you. &gt;&gt; I'm going but I coming back. &gt;&gt; How you going to come back? Watch say &gt;&gt; he tell he's coming back. &gt;&gt; But what he did at Pentecost, he came back in the form of the pill of fire, the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And that the reason today, brother and sister, &gt;&gt; you cannot fight that battle with your blood and flesh with the physical part. That's why the prophet says that you have to get the Holy Ghost in your life. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, you already lost the battle. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But now to be an overcomer, &gt;&gt; to be an overcomer, &gt;&gt; you got to get receive something. &gt;&gt; Amen. Dr. Theresa Paul I mean Peter said in second Peter 2 Peter chapter 1 verse 2 Peter chapter 1:3 Peter said according to his divine power at giving unto us all things that pertaining unto to life and godliness to the knowledge of him that had called us to glory and virtue. In other words, the battle is not yours is the Lord. But everything you you you need, God already gave it to you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And by the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; in you. That's why don't when you go and full of something you don't have to worry we all what I'm going to do just depend on the Lord &gt;&gt; because without me you can do nothing &gt;&gt; right where I've been I raising the message I know what the prophet says all the quotes you fight battle you already be defeated &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; all the way &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; let the Holy Spirit come &gt;&gt; and now &gt;&gt; according as his divine power has given us all things. Verse four, whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promise that by this you might be partakers. &gt;&gt; You're not assistant you partakers &gt;&gt; of the divine nature. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Having escaped the corruption that is in the world to los. So since we have an enemy the de devil at the beginning he wasn't called the devil like you know that he was Lucifer but because he sin God said not not only he sin he say oh God I'm sorry I pray no he fight against I'm not going nowhere &gt;&gt; have you ever seen that when somebody doing wrong try to go to talk to that person he become a rebellious &gt;&gt; fight with you the When your body in sin, don't approach him like that. He might kick you back. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You anointed with the spirit of the devil. The same thing in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. Don't tell me that. No, no, no. That's the reason when you're born in sin, Bible say pray first. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Try to reconcile your brother. &gt;&gt; He's not listening to you. Don't fight with him. Get the brother one or two. in love. Go talk to them. If he doesn't, bring it to the church. That's it. &gt;&gt; You don't have to f post him on postach. &gt;&gt; Post your body. You a devil. &gt;&gt; You're a devil. You days to death. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; When you have to do that. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; that's not your battle. &gt;&gt; He's of the Lord. &gt;&gt; All you have to do in love go to talk to your brothers. Tell him because remember that when you in sin you anointed by the devil &gt;&gt; by the spirit of the devil. &gt;&gt; You became rebellious &gt;&gt; not listen to no one. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Even God imagine and and Cain when he killed Abel the Lord said &gt;&gt; where's that brother? My brother keeper The truth. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But everything you should Oh, sorry Lord. I'm sorry I keep my body. No, my my body keeper. I just keep it. What you want me to do? No. No. No. &gt;&gt; Brother the same thing. A brother sister might do something wrong. You know that you approach that but oh no no you wrong. You wrong. &gt;&gt; The evil spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. got to know how to approach that that the reason and uh and um how to overcome say that not what to overcome &gt;&gt; but how to overcome &gt;&gt; not what but how to overcome &gt;&gt; many times say well don't don't do this don't do that well everybody is evil because if you're there. But when you're front of that situation, how are you going to defend? &gt;&gt; Not what to overcome, but how to overcome. &gt;&gt; Remember that David when the king uh they burn to the king is the enemy, David in his mind said, "Boy, they're going to kill me today." What he did? He played like he's a fool. He prayed like he's incin see that he know how to go overcome. He's not going to pray the Lord say Lord help me out. No no no no. He use he deser say if I do that that will kill me. He pray like he's squeezing. &gt;&gt; What did they say? Ah, this I got you. &gt;&gt; I got you. &gt;&gt; Got you. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; How to overcome, &gt;&gt; not what to overcome. &gt;&gt; Yes. Lord, we all together. Are we? &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, let's move forward. Now, he wasn't calling the devil. He wasn't called Satan. But what he did give him that name. &gt;&gt; That the reason when he's uh doing uh the series on demonology, he said that the a demon is a tormentor. &gt;&gt; A tormentor. That the reason when you brother you torment your brother and sister you a devil demon. &gt;&gt; What it is is a tormentor. &gt;&gt; You create problem for your brother and sister. &gt;&gt; You just always turn at your brother and sister. No. No. Leave me alone. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There's something bad. God will take care of that. &gt;&gt; All you have to do pray for your brother and sisters. &gt;&gt; Do the step of Matthew 18. Go to him first or her first. &gt;&gt; Just listen to you. Take two three. That's all. Yes. Yes. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; All the time negative. But now it's worse. &gt;&gt; If there's something wrong, it be posted online. Posted &gt;&gt; on social media. &gt;&gt; So the whole world can see that boy is a bad boy. The sister is a evil person. Why you do that? &gt;&gt; Why you do that? &gt;&gt; Spirit. &gt;&gt; So we have to be vigilant. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We have to be careful. what you do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the devil is working. &gt;&gt; I mean is is world on this earth. &gt;&gt; Why? Seeking who you might devour. &gt;&gt; But remember that the devil not looking after denominational. No no the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you know that you know who you are. &gt;&gt; You know who you are. &gt;&gt; You're not the f of the devil. You can't do nothing to you unless you open yourself. As the prophet said, &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit is covered the earth. He can't do nothing unless he find a body. &gt;&gt; If the Holy Spirit find a body, he can work through that body. &gt;&gt; The same thing too, the devil looking for body. &gt;&gt; When he find that body, he going to work through that body. Right. &gt;&gt; And uh I was uh doing a study for the young people in the church and I tell them then that the age that we now is compared to the time of the judges. So when the children of Israel left the Lord says let's let's read that in second Judges 2 verse 10. Judges chapter 2 verse 10 because the devil is not um a new devil is old. Excuse me. Judges chapter 2 verse. And also all the generation were gathered unto their fathers, and there a wars in the generation after them, which knew not the Lord, not yet the work which he had done for Israel. I was telling the young people, I said, I will be on time. Uh young generation of my time. We used to go to all the kept meeting there. He there we fire. Yes. &gt;&gt; Kept meeting driving 8 hours, 10 hours driving back and forth. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Hey, I saw you over there. I saw over there. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That was back that time. Right. &gt;&gt; But now, &gt;&gt; but now you see that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And um look at what what the Lord says the same chapter 2 verse 19. And it came to pass when the judge was dead that they returned and corrupted themselves more than their father and following all the gods to serve them and to bow down unto them. They cease not from their undoing nor from the stubborn way. &gt;&gt; And the anger of the Lord was heart against Israel. And he said, "Cause that these people had transgresses my covenant which I commanded their father and have not hearkened unto my voice, I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nation which Joshua left when he died." So that mean the Lord tell him there is seven nations &gt;&gt; I left. &gt;&gt; I left the seven nation but I give you the land. &gt;&gt; Yes. But I left. Imagine somebody stay in the house or the Lord tell them to kick you out to take your house. You think you know stay like that watching you. But the Lord tell them the Lord tell them the Cananan the Hites the Jubicide all this pagan kick them out take their land their position. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; You know that okay now I'm leaving easy. He said no they're going to fight &gt;&gt; to kick them out &gt;&gt; those nation. So at the time of Joshua the Lord didn't put every everybody out. He left a number of nation. What what it say? It says that chapter 3 now verse one. These are the nation which the Lord left to poor Israel by them even as many of Israel had not known all the wars of Kenyan only that the generation of the children of Israel might know to teach them war. In this end time we live in there are certain thing that the Lord lived that purposely &gt;&gt; for the young generation. to have their own experience with the message &gt;&gt; because remember that you have to go fight all the way in the convention keep meeting but now he send you your devil I'm only in the middle a few of them I remember back in the um 70s used to be uh uh see uh hippie Afro and the bell papa &gt;&gt; bell baba. Everybody walking to that platform. Everybody have speaking in the pocket. Wow. &gt;&gt; But now that was a demon of time. &gt;&gt; But now everything changed. &gt;&gt; Everything changed. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; And I was telling the the young people I back then uh it was a no cell phone. the whole uh landline you have to all you know young people know nothing about that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You see what they call you in the year you have to one I miss that call. There's no way to find who called you. There's no way to find who called you. But sometimes you have to wait by the first how they going to call back the second time. No they call back. You go back. Oh, I miss it again. &gt;&gt; I miss it again. That was our time. &gt;&gt; But now, &gt;&gt; you can be anywhere. Your phone, you know who call you. Okay, I call you back, &gt;&gt; you know. &gt;&gt; I mean, technology, &gt;&gt; but that should make us closer to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh said and this time he was wrong to go to the movie to uh uh that was wrong. &gt;&gt; He said well the devil bring it in the house by TV but not is worse than TV. &gt;&gt; You put the hand of palm your hand &gt;&gt; the phone. You have to go to a movie. You can have your own movie at home. &gt;&gt; Anywhere you go, you can watch whatever you want to to that. &gt;&gt; Now that you're on demon, you have to fight. Now &gt;&gt; you have to fight. &gt;&gt; I I told young people there was a time I mean they call me all the gay people was in the closet. They come in the closet. &gt;&gt; It was wrong to say loudly I'm gay. I'm this. It was wrong. You have to be brave enough to say that &gt;&gt; nally. But now with time with time, I will listen to uh a song was doing the group of LGBT in uh uh San Francisco. They make a song. I want to convert your children. &gt;&gt; I'm after them. I make them tolerant &gt;&gt; and make them I mean fair &gt;&gt; why because the doctrine they have they taught us we uh that Christian we hate them we don't like them &gt;&gt; so what they say they try to teach the young people don't be hateful &gt;&gt; love us the Bible say love your neighbor you &gt;&gt; but there is something beh behind that &gt;&gt; behind something. There is something behind that. Now imagine in school uh you send your your kid to school, but now they're not for this. Well, I'm gay. I'm lesbian. Even this message, &gt;&gt; the demon demon on this earth now scared no church. &gt;&gt; Scared no church. &gt;&gt; Mr. Church, they enter the messages. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Wow. That's the truth. &gt;&gt; That's why I have to be vigilant brother and sister to be under God all the time &gt;&gt; because that spirit is there &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; spirit is there. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; I was telling my young brother and sister. I said well uh so there's a limit. But if you there talk to the sister don't say all the time men no come on show me that you a man. I [Applause] don't see [Music] [Laughter] &gt;&gt; I see that I don't see to be a butterfly or no I don't see that but at least show me your man talk to your sister &gt;&gt; he there 25 30 about to 40 here working, got a good job. Say, "Hey, what's going on? [Music] What's going on? What is going on?" No, no, no, no, no. I have to watch your spirit because I don't say to do wrong thing, but do the right things. Yes. It's time for you to get married. You got a sister. &gt;&gt; Sister, don't sit there all the time popping your muscle. Just that's all you do. No. No. No. No, no, no, no. Glory. &gt;&gt; Come tell them. Yes. &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We see that spirit um and this end time take different forms. You see this different form and now with the gay community now they open now. &gt;&gt; I was telling the church I said you know what they do they're so brave they use the rainbow as their sign. But we know that spirit because they call their same pride. &gt;&gt; We know pride was in heaven. That demon it was cast down to earth. &gt;&gt; When I see that I said that the that Lucifer, that Satan, the devil that encountered those uh flesh, they call them pride. &gt;&gt; That was the spirit of pride that kick lucifer out from heaven. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And now you come on earth now establish kingdom. They have they burn they flooded they say pride &gt;&gt; they're not ashamed because I'm pride &gt;&gt; but you know our prophet Jesus pride from the devil &gt;&gt; say humble humility &gt;&gt; Christian has to be humble not pride do something no humble &gt;&gt; humble yourself before &gt;&gt; before before the Lord &gt;&gt; now we see that the Lord left uh Because demon in every generation &gt;&gt; even on our time we are to fight the young people also &gt;&gt; exactly &gt;&gt; they have the demon the devil to fight. I was telling this I said that's the reason sometime you don't know what it your kids going through going to school &gt;&gt; they facing the demon &gt;&gt; they facing the demon I said that's important to talk to them I said how you feel brother and sister if you find out your your son or daughters has come orientation for different for same sex for how you feel about that. Are you going to call so and so? Everybody to tell them well I be careful &gt;&gt; have to be careful &gt;&gt; because is a spirit. We are dealing with spirit. &gt;&gt; If we deal with spirit you have to know the right way to approach that. Otherwise we do more damage then we bring &gt;&gt; more damage. Amen sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even in our church if you know a bother sometime just working call him to the side. Talk to that person. Don't expose him. Don't expose them. Especially a minister don't expose him on the pulpit. No no no. Call on to the side. Sisters you see them have the wrong orientation. Call them to the side. talk to them because we are dealing with spirit. &gt;&gt; You are dealing with spirit &gt;&gt; not that person. &gt;&gt; That person is a good person. &gt;&gt; Sometime they use the scripture and the wrong way. &gt;&gt; Christian the wrong way. You see that they all hate us. We are Christian of God. The Bible say to love everybody. But we love you but you don't love what you did wrong. We have to call right, right, wrong, wrong. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, we compromising our rights. No, we not compromising with no &gt;&gt; we love you. We have to tell you the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not going to force you to change. No, no, no. We tell you the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then we find that the devil has the free will. &gt;&gt; He has a choice. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But he use that to be against God. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; You see, I will raise my throne. I will raise my kingdom. I will do this, do that. &gt;&gt; I said, "No, no, no, no, no, no. I thought you was an obedient angel, but now you rebel against me now. You're going down." &gt;&gt; The worst thing is they I'm not going nowhere. I said, "What?" He said, "No, we had to fight me to kick me out." &gt;&gt; Okay, let's go. Call Michael. Call Michael. Michael, come. They said they fried. They fried. It wasn't easy. Remember, it wasn't easy. &gt;&gt; It wasn't easy. It was a war. Wow. &gt;&gt; Finally with a kicking man. Okay, don't worry. But woman to the earth. I'm coming down. I'm coming down. &gt;&gt; Your people downstairs should be ready. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Like what? God come and the human body. &gt;&gt; Angel the devil their battle ra going to be rushing because you're not going to see them are going to be inside them. people &gt;&gt; are going to be inside dwelling inside them like the reason brother and sister I told the church respect anyone might not agree with somebody but respect that person because God dwell in human being now &gt;&gt; the holy spirit &gt;&gt; you might take wrong about the person then it was the holy spirit and that person even though they do some mis respect that because nobody you not say because you want the message. That's wrong. &gt;&gt; I'm the message. I'm saved. No. What you want to do there? &gt;&gt; I baptized because the message. No, no, no. You say because God by for knowledge before the foundation of the world, he know you. You were predestinated for that. &gt;&gt; Not because you baptized your mom, your dad was in the message. Oh, I'm born. I told young people I'm born in the message. There's nobody in the message. Nobody. &gt;&gt; Nobody is born in the message. &gt;&gt; We all has to go to the same experience. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As your dad, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; We still got the same devil, the same demon. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; To fight. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you think that, oh, I'm not worried because hey, I'm a million. My dad is fighting the devil, but I'm not fighting the devil. No, no, no, no. We still fighting the same devil. &gt;&gt; Everybody is on different level. &gt;&gt; The kids at school, you at work, everywhere you go, you find the devil. &gt;&gt; But like I said, not what to overcome, but how &gt;&gt; how to overcome the devil. &gt;&gt; To overcome. Amen. &gt;&gt; When we look at at at Paul and Acts, when Paul was preaching, there was a young uh woman was following Paul, calling Paul, "Oh, you the servant of God." But she didn't say anything wrong. &gt;&gt; Physically, she said anything wrong. &gt;&gt; That was a demon. But after a while, they said Paul was tired of that spirit. You see, he cursed out that devil &gt;&gt; and found out there was the devil, a python serpent spirit. &gt;&gt; Wow. Wow. &gt;&gt; You never know that. &gt;&gt; But he find out that that spirit is not the right spirit. &gt;&gt; Even though he didn't she didn't say anything wrong to show that wrong spirit. But sometime you have to be careful &gt;&gt; with what you let go. Be vigilant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be vigilant. But now be sober. The devil as a war lion. Sometime when you are watching documentary you never see a lion attack a group of buffalo in the front. No no no you go by back &gt;&gt; watching &gt;&gt; sometime I'm going to show you a quote uh but mention that uh systematic well I'm going to single out I'm going to say I'm not going to have fellowship with nobody. I've been by myself. Oh yeah, you'll be by yourself. Uh, let's see that. Everybody say, "Yeah, you want to be by yourself?" Oh, that's good. Stay by yourself. I don't want to be in fellowship with nobody. Um this uh huh uh okay let me find the message called uh trusting for life &gt;&gt; 1960 0304 because sometime with the message but there's something behind you don't pay attention because the devil know how to fight the bride that's why you think God we have a perfect messenger. Amen. &gt;&gt; Given all the tactic overcome is to recognize the devil &gt;&gt; in all his tact overcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Testing for life 63304 paragraph 73 I believe. Yeah. 173. Okay. Going to find something. brother and sister. &gt;&gt; Uh thirsting for life. Okay. Uh he was uh 167. He says 167. I've watched many time the wolf after the deer.

If you can catch a tea away from the her what devil wants to do. &gt;&gt; Now to you young ladies, he wants you to go out with the boys that not a Christian. to you young man. He want you to go out with some little petty Jezebel. God not the Christian. That's where he wants &gt;&gt; to break you up. That's where he wants to suck his teeth unto you. &gt;&gt; And this little deal will get out to itself away from the dirt. See that? Away from the earth. &gt;&gt; That's the one the world works on. &gt;&gt; Amen. away from the go &gt;&gt; 169 people say I can stay at home be just as good a Christian as I can at church &gt;&gt; at church you can't &gt;&gt; the Bible say not forsake or assemble oursel together and that much more as we see the time coming &gt;&gt; yeah you can unless listen to the tips fine Sometime the church want to listen that's fantastic that's good &gt;&gt; listen to the tip in your house that's fine fine but stay away from church listen to tip &gt;&gt; tell me what kind is that &gt;&gt; whatitute is that you can't &gt;&gt; Amen sir &gt;&gt; 171 if you're Christian you long to go to where all the Christians are and fellowship with other Christians &gt;&gt; fellowship with other So you cannot stay away from church and live the same life. True. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How you going to know you if you have temperance &gt;&gt; uh h um patience all this virtue &gt;&gt; if you stay home &gt;&gt; nobody going to bother you at home. Nobody &gt;&gt; even your wife. &gt;&gt; But at church, your brother, your sister going to be something to make you mad. You get under my skin. N going to show you the real person that you are. &gt;&gt; Because that person get under your skin. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see that uh you cannot do it because like I'm hungry but I never go to a table &gt;&gt; just I never eat. I said I ain't going to do it. You got to go and feed on the word of God in fellowship with one with one in order. &gt;&gt; 172. See, we need one another more than we ever did need each other is now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need one another now. When you get yourself sing out from the rest of them, make yourself just literally different. Why you want to be super Christian? Make yourself super Christian. Sometime you can see the message that the brother sisters they use the attitude separate themsel from all the crowd from the brother and sisters well I'm not going to take part with what they doing or I'm this no you nothing &gt;&gt; with something by the grace of God &gt;&gt; nobody saved by your own merit nothing &gt;&gt; the Bible say you are saved by grace &gt;&gt; if you go by merit I say well I'm saved because because of what? &gt;&gt; What have you done? Nothing &gt;&gt; by grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Through faith &gt;&gt; in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; So he says that when you get yourself single out from the rest of them, making yourself just a little different. You don't want to associate with them because they believe this and don't want to associate with that. You're getting on dangerous ground. getting on dangerous ground right then keeping away from church. Say well sometime notice in this end time um many time brother and sister pick and choose the day they want to come to church. &gt;&gt; Pick and choose pick and choose the way they come to come to church. Today's prayer meeting and coming Bible study. Okay. I don't know. Sunday morning. Yes. If I stay home on Sunday, they might think I'm a pagan. So I have to show them I'm Christian. Hey, &gt;&gt; you better stay home. You better stay home. &gt;&gt; Better stay home. For a sister, you don't come to show us that you Christian. Right. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; you don't show nobody nothing because you're Christian. I will come to church so I can tell them I'm a Christian. I can worship. You're bluffing yourself. &gt;&gt; Be be will be be will. &gt;&gt; This is uh uh keep you from church. Find the one of your choice. Yes. and remain there and be a Christian border to all of them. That's the way to be a real Christian. Then we got fellowship protection. That the word we got fellowship protection. &gt;&gt; When we together, we got a protection. &gt;&gt; Why? Because as we together, somebody say, you know, brother John, I'm having some problem. The church know about that. Everybody be praying for you. They call you the protection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are protected. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By the prayer of the sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you single out. &gt;&gt; They call you. I I'm fine. Close. Close. I'm fine. Don't call me. I'm fine. &gt;&gt; I'm fine. Don't call me. &gt;&gt; I'm fine. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Protection. &gt;&gt; People love you and pray for you. &gt;&gt; That's why we have fellowship. &gt;&gt; That's why our fellowship. &gt;&gt; Yeah. By fellowshipping we know each other more because sometime somebody by going through something because you never have fellowship explain why so and so never come to church on Sunday on Tuesday or Wednesday Thursday why by talking to that person you might find out there's a problem going on you know why I don't have gas money [Laughter] &gt;&gt; the money I have I used to go to work but I can't come You understand that? &gt;&gt; Because we are at the same level of faith because myself I tell the church um I usually tell I said the Lord if you give me money to go to church give me money to come back because I'm not going to stuck on the word. No otherwise I'm not coming. I said Lord I'm not coming. &gt;&gt; Sure I'm not. I said I believe it. I said I'm not coming. Well, it gives the money to go to come back. I said, "Oh Lord, thank you. Thank you." If I have to go to bank to put some money, I do it. &gt;&gt; I going to say I got no money when I have money in the bank. That line is Joseph. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Christian be. &gt;&gt; You got money in the I have no nothing to put gas in my car. What you going to do? You going to leave it for who? When you die, when you pass away, &gt;&gt; the Bible say that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Who you going that for? Right. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. Everything you have, use it for the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Use it. &gt;&gt; I mean, gas money should not be impediment for a Christian that come to church. No, &gt;&gt; go use your card. But sometime you use your cash for for for things that nonsense. &gt;&gt; Amazon all the time. Amazon all the time. F this all the &gt;&gt; for no reason. &gt;&gt; Save something to put gas in your car to come to church. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; 173 that the success of my meeting is because will godly people pray for me. Uh I'm going to show you something when I come in and introduce this thing about the vision thing. There's a many our mother and dad, sister and brother sitting out there that believe that with all their hearts, the Holy Spirit dropped right down on them. If they didn't do that, I have no way of doing it. No matter how great it would be for myself, he had to be for you the same. We have to be a unit, two of us together to make the contact with God. You as believer in myself. So that mean you don't there to just to assist. You're partic &gt;&gt; for the ministers. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm going to show you why God give you the Holy Spirit. Sometime I told brother and sister you the way you you worship the Lord, you think that the Lord give you the Holy Spirit just to come to church only. [Music] [Laughter] to come to church only. That's why God give you the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; That's the wrong idea. My B give you the Holy Spirit that come to church. Uh let's see the message called what the Holy Ghost for. &gt;&gt; You give the Holy Ghost just to come to church. Come to church when you feel like coming. Everything fine, I'm coming. He went outside and I'm coming today. What kind of Christian is that? &gt;&gt; Amen, brother. &gt;&gt; What kind of question is that? Okay. Uh 59 121 17. What was the Holy Ghost given for? Um okay. I will p of 29 but uh okay let me see par of 30 in the cool of the evening he would come down and commune with them and there he lost that fellowship because sin would you remember that said that before sin Lord would come down and talk to Adam and Eve but after um they sin I mean the mar from God they were blocked there was no communication between them and God there was separation so God what he did Adam Eve leave kick him out kicked him out God don't sin in his prison even in heaven he kicked the devil out on earth also uh Adam and Eve sin god leave the garden and leave it now But he give him protection. He kill a lamb and close them with that. He kill you in protection. But God always want to have communion fellowship with his people. He and then he was made flesh and dwell among us in order that he could come back again to men and live in man and restore man to still a communion with him again and give him back his god-given right. Yeah. is god-given right. &gt;&gt; That's your god-given right. &gt;&gt; That the right to get in good health, &gt;&gt; right? To uh to raise your family, wife for your kids, God-given, eternal life. 21 31 That purpose of the Holy Ghost is the father again. God the Father dwelling in you working out his plan to finish his plan of redemption. &gt;&gt; What does that mean? Even though Jesus Christ went on Calvar's cross, but they still got some sinners. We had to talk to them. &gt;&gt; We got to talk to them. Bring him back. We have to go after the Lord's soul. He says that continue though working through you making you a coworker with him. See that Satan at that job that position he was a coworker whatever said with God but he se kick him out but now you are a coworker with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You partnership with God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Giving you a place giving you a part for your fallen lost brother and sister. giving you his spirit and his love to go hunt the lost as he did in the garden of Eden. So you see that the Lord didn't give you the Holy Spirit just to come to church. Amen. No, &gt;&gt; you have a job to do. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You got a job to do. Either brother and sister, you got a job to do. &gt;&gt; Because many time the service come after the service. Well, sometime I ask brother and sisters, how about the service? Well, there was a good servant that's all. That was a good sermon that all I said what was saying in the sermon that you think that you are &gt;&gt; taken from that but it was a good sermon. &gt;&gt; You defeated the purpose. &gt;&gt; When you come to church to find out what he did not talk to me &gt;&gt; because when you come to church it's like you come to the courthouse. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come to plead your case. &gt;&gt; The Lord say that you guilty on this, you guilty on that. Now I say oh lord oh lord yes I'm guilty what I have to do &gt;&gt; one time he went to the church he preached he preached after there was a sister come he said praise the lord but he did touch me wow that sister I be close to the kingdom after she left he go tell me about that sister she the chief gossiper and the she the chief gossiper but that I you didn't talk about gossiping should have been you touch me brother I'm untouchable but no matter what you are God find something to touch your heart &gt;&gt; to make you think about why I'm coming to church for because nowhere in the Bible you say we come to church to become worse no &gt;&gt; better not best but better &gt;&gt; better Christian, better neighbor, better better better come to church. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that mean when you come to church because uh show that he says the the the the minister the prophet uh the preacher is a prophet in the old New Testament. Why? Sometime I was asking why because when the preacher is preaching many time they don't know nothing about your life but when he speak you say man but how you did somebody talk to you somebody tell you about my life you see that you go exactly &gt;&gt; while going through that person life is a preacher &gt;&gt; just a preacher because he got the gift of a prophet also when he's preaching to go exactly in your life do something &gt;&gt; pray to you &gt;&gt; so didn't even know what he's saying. But the Lord tell him to mention certain thing &gt;&gt; that when you find out oh this man is is preaching on me I coming back again coming back again that show you that you rebellion with the word &gt;&gt; the words when you come to church the Lord want to talk to you to change your attitude because he want you to be um as a service like he say that you are a partner working with him to work out this plan of redemption. &gt;&gt; You didn't just come to church just uh feel I have the Holy Ghost just tell the world where I have the Holy Ghost to do what? &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost you here have do what? &gt;&gt; Do what? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All the believers they can lay hand on the sick all the Bible say this they follow you. You before they follow you &gt;&gt; they're not in front of you. No they follow you. Right? &gt;&gt; And you come in, you can say to do that because you believe it. But now in this time that we live in, we see that this Satan, the devil, he's working away, making his way in heaven. He want to go take over control of the kingdom on heaven. But down on earth, he said, "Now I'm going to mess up your life, God. Your children, I'm going down to mess their life. I'm going to like like Jo I'm going to make him curse you. No, Lord said no. Never. I know who is job. He's my servant. &gt;&gt; Because sometime you might be going through some test not even know it. &gt;&gt; The Lord purposely live that don't think anything happened. Oh, it's the devil. No, don't blame the devil for anything. Oh, it's the devil. No, don't blame the devil for anything. Because the Lord says why he enjoys he lives seven nation to test you. &gt;&gt; Sometime in church you might think outside well it might be somebody inside the church. &gt;&gt; Somebody close to your brother and sister do something to you that you never imagined that will do that to you. Right. &gt;&gt; Now we have the devil. We have now you know something stay with you and that person you going to be online everybody going to see that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When somebody had a disagreement with you they go whatever chat they have posted let the whole world know. &gt;&gt; And there are some people discernment. They say hm there's something wrong with that person. &gt;&gt; They can leave in between the lines. They know that what you posted what you did there's something going on. What they going to do? They're going to magic something, change something. But then be careful what you post online. &gt;&gt; Be careful what you post because that the sound of distraction at this time. The devil wants to distract you from the real thing because the prophet says there the spirit of the last days. The spirit of the last days. Distraction keep you distracted from the real thing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. When you distracted from the real thing, you didn't have a purpose. You didn't have the objective. You just want but no be vigilant, be sober, watch because the your adversary as a as a as a war line which is divor. Be careful how you talk your brother and sisters because a brother might do something to you. So that God can permit allow the brother and sister to do something wrong to you. &gt;&gt; You're not important is not brother and sister is not important what the body says to you to the Lord. There's a reason for that. But you is important your reaction. &gt;&gt; God is control your reaction. &gt;&gt; Why son be that to me? Why to me? Oh keep asking why. Keep asking why. You going to find why. Keep asking why why that to me? Why is that to me? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Imagine David when he was dethroned and walking to the hill of Jerusalem and uh shimmy how the guy's name. Yeah. Yeah. He came to walk. One of the soldier soldier pul said King David to call this dog ahead. M &gt;&gt; you call him a dog. &gt;&gt; Even he does s armor weapon. David said no no no no that not your battle. This my battle. He said the Lord allow him to do that to me to see my reaction. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometime the Lord permit something say on the purpose to see your reaction. &gt;&gt; Somebody did something to you to do to hurt you to do to see your reaction. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not important what the person did to you because God said to me Avengers God going to take care that person. &gt;&gt; He did the wrong to you. God going to take care of that person. But your reaction is important. &gt;&gt; I will treat your brother and sister. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I will tell the whole world many time I said well Jesus Christ said he was a green tree. You all know that. You see you happened to the green tree. Jesus Christ. What about you? I never heard anybody there been somebody in church slap them, spit in their face, all this thing. I know that. But I wonder that if somebody ever slap you and spit on your face, that image will be une so did that to me at the church. Look at what don't believe me what they did to me. that happened to Christ, &gt;&gt; it can happen to you too. &gt;&gt; Always be under expectation. Anything can happen to one and sister. But be on your guard. Be vigilant. &gt;&gt; Be vigilant. &gt;&gt; Your reaction is important to God. &gt;&gt; Because because God want to u lead you to carving. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He want to lead you to car. He said take up your course. Many time we say that even that I don't know how you with your verse but some Bible my Bible say take your cross daily &gt;&gt; but I know yours take your course I mean or every year or every six month take your course every Sunday or &gt;&gt; daily &gt;&gt; take your course daily and follow So that mean unless I know you live in this country there are some obligation you got to go to work do something it's fine but if there is no obligation service uh Wednesday Friday Thursday take your course and then come worship &gt;&gt; take your course and come worship &gt;&gt; they don't have to call you uh oh so I didn't see you in church no it's your duty if you're not coming to church to call somebody to tell them. &gt;&gt; I tell the church many times about that who's working in a place when they're not showing up to just stay home and come back the next day. Tell me. &gt;&gt; Tell me. &gt;&gt; There's some place even uh I don't know two hours before or or a day before &gt;&gt; to call them tell them I'm not coming today. I need a day of something. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Everybody Okay. That's why. But the church, hey, you take off whatever you want to. &gt;&gt; Take off whatever you want to and come. You don't call nobody. I mean, you to nothing. &gt;&gt; You just live your life like like you're a &gt;&gt; wanderer. But say, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You're the wanderer. Just warming around." No, no, no. We have star. We position. &gt;&gt; We have a position in the world. &gt;&gt; We have a duty. We have a work to do. &gt;&gt; We don't come to church when we feel like coming. &gt;&gt; But it don't feel like coming. We stay home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And get make sure nobody call me. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; We are We are dealing some spirit brother and sister. We are dealing some spirit. But stay strong in the word. &gt;&gt; Only weapon we have to fight the devil is the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Show them your love. Even though sometime they treat you what show love. &gt;&gt; Love cover a multitude of sin. Remember uh overcome is not what to overcome but how &gt;&gt; how when somebody did something wrong you call him what what do you tell me what how you going to react now how you going to react you know that you want but how are you going to react not what to overcome but hard to overcome. May God bless you. May the Lord keep you. May the Lord open your eyes to walk and fellowship because you are your brother, sister's keeper. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your brother, sister's keeper. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All the time. If there's somebody sit all sometime close to you, you don't see them in church. No way for the pastor or the minister to call and so on and so &gt;&gt; what you what do you have the Holy Spirit for &gt;&gt; just to come to church your duty your job also to check on the church &gt;&gt; sir &gt;&gt; there's something going on the pastor they have to know everything you can pray for somebody &gt;&gt; they going through something you can do something pray for them &gt;&gt; sister can do that do it for the ministers oh somebody ask for prayer who said that you who are you a believer come on you believe, pray for that person. &gt;&gt; If you can't pray for that person, okay, if it's too much, okay, ask for help. &gt;&gt; But help first of all, pray for that person. She say so and so need some help. I'm going, sister, let's pray together. Brother, let's pray together. We do that. We keep the church strong. &gt;&gt; Keep this church strong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember that we don't come to church just just to come. No, we come for a purpose. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We come for a purpose &gt;&gt; to be better Christian to watch after yourself to see our conduct. How do we conduct ourel as Christian? &gt;&gt; May God bless you. May the Lord keep you. I hope that help you a little bit. &gt;&gt; May the Lord God help you. Amen. So I don't understand because I remember when we first uh we used to have service also in the school and sometime uh we used to to meet um by 7:30 and I could give the place by 9:00 if any mystic by 8:45 8:50 something would come out they're walking in the We are to live. I know what it is. May God bless you. But we're praying for brothers and sisters. So the Lord can provide something for us. You have their own place of worship. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Everything is possible to them that believe. &gt;&gt; The Lord say ask great thing as great thing in abundance as your joy will be perfect. Perfect. May God bless you. Amen. But Jack, that's it. Amen. I hope you get something today to get you in the world. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Certainly appreciate uh Pastor Lewis Jean and uh [Applause] you know this this uh subject of your adversary the devil uh just walking us right through how um Satan got started there and beginning and where he even got his name changed right started with Lucifer the bearer of light and but when he stepped into obed a disobedience uh this is where he gets a name change and now he's called the devil so anytime we see ourselves walking into disobedience to this, we see we're following the wrong pattern. And what God is asking us to do is come back in line with what my word say. Not not I'm not talking about what everybody else saying, but what does my word say? And uh and and I was just listening. I think I don't know. I mean he left no stone unturned. &gt;&gt; I mean he dealt with everything today. And and you know I was talking with my wife uh before service and she was you know talking with somebody and they were saying um you know they go to church and usually they're out by 9:30. And my wife said well what time y'all start? She say 8:30. We got be out by 9:30. She's like, "Wow, that's man, that's fast." So he said, "Better not come to my church cuz we going to be there a little bit longer than that." And so the lady was like, "Well, what what is it that the pastor be saying with all all that time? What is he saying?" I mean, how can he say anything? I He's saying too much. I mean, I just can't take all that. I said, "See, they never dealing with nothing." That's right. &gt;&gt; But today, if you didn't I mean, everybody in here, &gt;&gt; those here, those that's online &gt;&gt; should have heard something from God. &gt;&gt; And what happens when you come to the house of the Lord, the Bible says judgment begins at the house of the Lord. So something to cause you to draw a little closer to Christ should have happened right here today. &gt;&gt; I was sitting there, I say, "Well, praise God." &gt;&gt; I'm talking about everything. [Music] everything. &gt;&gt; I better not recap the brother message, but I I I heard a lot. &gt;&gt; I I hope my my prayer cuz you know I for me I hate when a preacher come and do something like this and then everybody just act like God ain't said nothing. &gt;&gt; You are You got to be kidding me. Did you not hear that? That was directly to you. God know your email address. &gt;&gt; Amen. And God brought you some mail today. &gt;&gt; God brought you some mail today. And let me tell you something. Don't you delete that too quick. &gt;&gt; You better put that on save. &gt;&gt; And go back and look at it again. I tell you, I I I know God spoke in this place. &gt;&gt; Brother Jean, we we heard from heaven. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother. You were very obedient to the spirit of the Lord. We heard from heaven. We heard from heaven. I I I thank God. I thank God. I thank God. I Somebody was asking, you know, about uh why do pastors ask other pastors to speak for them when we got all these evangelists out here that don't get a chance to speak? I say, look, a pastor know what his church need and different gifts do different things. So when he invites a pastor, he realizes that that pastor has the ability to say things that he might not have a chance to say. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Evangelist come in and be gone. But a pastor just going to take his time and just a missile hit here. A missile hit here. A every statement a miss. Woo. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Boy, I said thank God. Thank God. I'm I don't know about you, but I'm I'm leaving here a better Christian. I I'm leaving here encouraged. I'm leaving here strengthened by the word of God. And uh and I and I'm happy I came to church. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. A victory. I'm going to see a victory. [Music] The battle belongs to you, Lord. Come on. I'm going to see a victory. I'm going to see a victory. Yes, I'm for the battle for the battle. [Music] Come on, one more time. I say, I'm going to see a victory. Yes, I'm going to sing for the battle. Can I have that first verse? The weapon may be formed, but it won't prosper. Hallelujah. [Music] And when the darkness falls, it won't prevail. [Music] Because the God I serve knows only how to triumph. Hey, say my God will never fail. Oh, said my God will never f. I'm going to see I'm going to see a victory. Yes, I'm going to see. Hallelujah. The battle belongs to you, Lord. I'm going to see [Music] for better. Hallelujah. I'm going to see a victory. Yes, I'm going to see the battle. [Music] Oh, I'm going to see a victory. Yes, I'm going to sing a victory where the battle belongs to you, Lord. Come on, give the Lord a hand of praise. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Let's bow in a word of prayer. Father, we thank you for all that has been spoken in this place. Lord, your servant just came and got himself out of the way and allowed you to use his lips. And God, there were so many uh situations that was hit here this morning. We thank you that you're concerned enough about us that you would talk to us, you would speak to us, that you would call us a little closer to you, Father, through your word. And Lord, uh and and and I'm reminded of what what one preacher said. We're we're not picking on anybody, but we are picking off because we are the the battle that started in heaven. We must realize it is now here on earth. And father, we're fighting daily. Uh brother Brandham told us that the battleground that that was chosen was the mind of man. So Lord, we we ask that you would help us, Father, to have uh victory in our lives. Lord, we thank you, Father, that it's not it's not what what we have to overcome, but it's how we overcome. And it's we must use the word of God the same way you use the word of God to overcome the enemy in this hour. Lord, we pray your blessings upon uh Pastor Lewis Jean and his family, his church. Oh God, thank you that he just took the time just to share a thought with us on today. Lord, we ask that you return the blessing back to him. Bless the saints as they prepare to leave this place but not your presence. And may we go meditating and thinking on the things that you spoke to us, Father. All of us should have got something out of this service. And I pray Lord that we would have a fellowship and conversation around that that our hearts would draw closer to you, Jesus. We carefully give you all the honor, all the glory, and all the praise. Bring us back at the appointed time on Friday on Wednesday night. And may the spirit of God meet us in a special way, God, is our prayer. Thank you for all that has been done in this place today. Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise just once more. Hallelujah. You can be seated. The brothers will come at this time and they will dismiss you. Amen. God bless you church. Amen. God bless you.
