about 94 dollars a night amen if I'm not mistaken alright praise the Lord musicians thank y'all so much I really really appreciate y'all thank God for you thank God for you a man so good to be back in the house of the Lord and I'll just read a scripture here we just thank God it's been it's been seem like we've been having some world when weeks you know and I think for me I'm still trying to recuperate from it got a couple other things that's that's all my schedule always seems that summertime gets it gets quite busy but you know long as we doing something that's all that matters a man to me I'm gonna go back to second Peter and will I'm sorry first Peter first Peter chapter two and I will read from there so good to have Jeremiah again with us on the day Jeremiah Coleman a man I thank God is still here with his grandfather and a man his parents the family lives there and Georgia now but his dad called me oh say Jeremiah still there please make sure you go by and pick them up a church so he's here again this morning so good to have them here in first Peter chapter 2 and we'll start reading at verse 1 a man and you all just pray for me a man as we just kind of go through this I've been trying for weeks to get to get to this though and you know and sometimes you have to sit and simmer on it for a while you know it start changing on you just just just pray with me amen on the day first Peter chapter 2 verse 1 says wherefore laying aside all malice a man important laying aside all malice and all guile write and hypocrisies these these are things the Bible tell us to lay aside it's not it's not pre and X God to deliver you from it you actually have to give it up yourself o Lord you know because sometimes we like holding on the stuff you know you know the man that was at the at the gate I'm sorry not the gate he was there at the Pool of Bethesda that man enjoyed his condition and when Jesus came and approached him and said hey will you be made whole he started giving all kind of excuses as to why he couldn't be made whole well Jesus I'm not here to listen to the excuses take up your bed and walk right I mean he didn't acts after Jesus question and all the time we get comfortable in the condition that we're in but God wants to shake us to get us that condition right we comfortable with malice we're comfortable with guile we're comfortable with being a hypocrite hmm we're comfortable with envying what else we're comfortable with evil speaking all right the Bible say wherefore laying aside all malice all love it not some of it all of it wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisy and envies and all evil speakings as newborn babes desire the sincere look of the word that you may grow thereby if so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious the homecoming as into a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ amen wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion a chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same as made the head of the corner and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient now these are some very serious statements that are being made here by Peter right and and I'm not going to go there but you can see even a day two people stumbling at the message right it's a stumbling stone a rock of offense they stumbling at the word but but but it actually leads them to disobedience all right amen weren't also they were appointed verse 9 says but ye thank God for that but all right but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people I'm done that in a few weeks I'm gonna try to get to that wee-wee peculiar we look different we act differently strange folk right that's who we are that's what the Bible calls us we can't help that we were born to be different right we are peculiar people that ye should show forth the praises of him who have called you this is your personal testimony call you out of darkness into his marvelous light which in time past were not a people but are now the people of God which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy the Lord as a blessing to the reading of his word let's just pray father we thank you for the ability to read scripture but Lord will read the scriptures not like we're reading the newspaper so god help us to realize a man what the Spirit is trying to speak to us in these words and we trust o God that you would help us to draw closer to you and as the scripture has commanded us has encouraged us to live by certain things this is an hour where we can't hold on to nothing but Jesus amen everything else is just not worth it so lord help us got to get our eyes and our attention focused on you may you just get the glory and the honor and from this portion of the service thank you for your spirit being here this morning the the worship the the songs that were saying here today just everything that's been done we pray God now that you carry us forward into Revelation of your word that that is what's going to give us the victory over the enemy we ask it all in the mighty name of Jesus amen amen god bless you can be seated so we want to go back to our thought on Showzen generation a man of chosen generation and if I could I want to read just a couple things before I get started here I was listening to sermon for you a few weeks ago maybe a month or so ago the signs of his coming brother branham was preaching there on this message the signs of his coming and he made a statement you know in that in that particular sermon that just kind of captured my attention and when when it caught my attention to begin to take me down you know this path of a chosen generation so let me just read here a man from this this this message signs of his coming it says it's now if it discourages them the signs discourages and dismays them it encourages the believer right it encourages the believer that's right it discourages one because why he believes he believes the word it is it is encouraged the believer in the scriptural truth signs remember I'm speaking on the signs of his appearing in this generation a man now I didn't bring it but I'll just make the statement brother Branham said the appearing of Christ and the coming of Christ of two separate things a man and even when we saw him appear in the Ministry of His Prophet that amen that was an appearing and many of many other things that he did to show us that he was on the way but the coming the second coming of what we're living in that time right now hallelujah church a man we leave out we're not talking about glory to God we're not talking about possibly 50 60 years from now a man there's too many things happening that let us know that at any moment now it could all be over and see when we really get a revelation of that right when we really get to understand that that's when we become a last five malice that's when we're getting the last five nd that's when we begin to lay aside jealousies it and petty stuff that just don't mean nothing and there it ain't number the devil if we can't fellowship here when we go to start fellowship because we can't we can't expect if not fellowship here did everybody go to heaven develop at some time somebody gotta leave something aside and I believe we've incidents or seas that we're trying to drop this and drop that and forget about this and forget about that it's time to crash into the rapture come on church they may look at what the percentage they remember I'm speaking on the signs of his appearing in this generation so that if we can show here in the scripture that this is the generation that will see the coming of the Lord when you said that I say wait a minute this is the generation that will see the coming of the Lord hallelujah now I want to tell you a living in that generation amen and this is you know for years people have preached about the second coming of the Lord but there comes a people that comes to the earth someday that will be a living manifestation of the second coming of the Lord and often what what if I'm saying this is the generation that will see the coming of Lord when I heard that I said a man I'm a part of that generation that will see it and if I'm a part of it then what should I be doing let me keep going says or what says oh you say are you sure of that well I say well just look to see what the signs point to see how close we are if the signpost says you're nearing just a few miles away you better be getting ready if the signposts say that you better be getting ready amen what what should I do that individually you better be getting ready not worried about what this will do cuz they may not like it but I'm talking about myself I gotta be getting ready if there's anything about half if not peace and God I want we love it anything in my life that's not right I want to get rid of it because I got to be getting ready listen you better be getting ready because it may just be it may be just a few hours away see but he told us what would take place just before this time and that's what we're going to look at now you know there's so many things that you know I can I can go in when we talk about sounds at the time you just go back to Matthew 24 it just gives you a description of everything right that that I mean there's a there's probably like 50 something verses that I won't take time to read all that now but I want to encourage you go back and read Matthew 24 it just gives you some of the silence now one of the signs that that is it's so real one of the great signs that Jesus was coming again he said as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the Son of Man he also said as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the coming of the Son of Man so now in the days of Noah what the problem was there was a lot of marriage in marriage and divorce problems and not only not only marriage and divorce but you had a lot of believers marry and unbelievers which is never supposed to happen under no circumstances should have believer marry an unbeliever that's what that's what the Prophet tells us but but but in the Noize day we have the sons of God that's a believer going after the daughters of men that's an unbelievable so we have believers marrying unbelievers oh come on somebody I think I'm in there right now because sometimes we get these thoughts that we can go out and get somebody converted hallelujah you can't do that you better let him come convert it right but believers will try to marry unbelievers and that is a common thing that's happening nowadays hallelujah amen stay with the believers yeah I mean there's got his own problems it got his own problems you need to know you got somebody that know God when the roads get rough and they go and get tough you need somebody got a relationship with Jesus all right come on now somebody maybe you don't you if you don't know what kept you Jesus here it's a folk don't went through some stuff but what their captain together is Jesus and Holland and you ain't got Jesus who got problems right but that was a problem in North Day but the believers were marrying unbelievers and then in Las data it was marriage giving a marriage in and then the other big problems homosexuality and when Jesus told us that we see all of that at the same time right Amen all of it came to earth that the same are we dealing with that right now laws being passed all tell us what happens we test impossible for us not to see that this is the last thing deal assurance he's our son my daughter was telling me you know just a little something happened on the job was talking with a friend of hers and you know they were just talking it was just talking I this this is going on the internet and everything else but you know what maybe someone on internet need to hear maybe somebody need to hear but you know um they were talking and the young lady you know me the mentions you say you know I just feel like all all girls are homosexual all girls are in that they you know they they like other girls my daughter said no I'm not I'm not she tell you again I know I know you not you're not you're not she said because you saved because you saved and just they say my daughter said now I don't have a problem giving a compliment to another lady saying that she looks nice or whatever even sometimes guys would say that about another god men that look nice I think I said that but brother Josue suit last weekend is there I can make a compliment and I have an attraction but you know and we don't got to the point that just because somehow to say you look nice you think oh no no no no no no no don't even start thinking that way don't let the devil get your mind and today I'll just give it a compliment hallelujah right but by the old a failure let me say I just feel like all girls up you know got got a certain element of this homosexuality that's already insane oh I ain't got it I'm not attracted to other women like that I'm not like that oh that's because you saved because I'm saved she say she say you go to church and you saved well my daughter's there's a lot of homosexual people that go to church you know this lady said she say they they not right and she's actually she's homosexual and she said that they not right if they go to church and and still living that lifestyle something wrong with him a homosexual lady say that she say we all know it's wrong a homosexual lady confesses out of mouth we all know this is wrong huh if that's what she said right I mean if that's what she's if that's what she said evidently if some people like that I believe that that this lifestyle is wrong why the church try to accept it these are signs of the time and when you start to notice death that's a good indicator that now it's a term that partying with everything you got you know church folk get offended oh lord have mercy Terk so will get offended you start talking like this this I mean I just read the quote to some it's a discouragement so over it's an encouragement but we're sorry y'all if you can discourage because I preach truth something wrong somewhere some some something went wrong somewhere you got to stop compromising with then it is wrong go that's right and I'll touch the homosexual stand it was wrong all right glory to God you know and I'll tell you what I when I hear something like that a person like that has a there's a there's a chance for them to go free from that spirit Oh Lord yeah I believe homosexuals can go free I believe drug addicts can go free huh I believe a man that that that that's constantly committing adultery can go free a woman that's constantly committing adultery she can go free Jesus delivered a woman that was in adultery I mean I believe that these people can't go free so I'm not closing as though on anybody but I'm saying that you can't you can't come a church and keep living in sin all right we talked about getting ready for the coming of the Lord which I've been a chosen generation all right I'm going on but I tell you you know when people when we start seeing all these signs of the time that should be that that's enough evidence to cause us to get in a hurry when it comes to the things of God all right look at this another quote here but the random says in the voice of the sign it says that now the time was at hand that God had made a promise Abraham four hundred years before that time that is he was sojourn in a strange land they would be brought out after 40 years they would be brought out with a mighty hand he would deliver his people by mighty hand and when the time of the promised routinize that's when God put Moses on the scene Moses and his absolute failure had went into the wilderness now I paused on that a little bit Moses in his absolute failure hat went into the wilderness now if anybody know the message right we know that brother branham got to the port where he was so discouraged that he also wanted to go into the wilderness he saying he will be right down the street in the UH you know and I mean he's kind of sitting there thinking that you know I'll just come out here bring my wife out here and we will just you know we'll just we'll just be out here in the wilderness and any time God speak to me I leave the Lillis and I go back in and I preach what God time in the breach and he was just sitting there going through that in his mind and and then you know he went to a restaurant him and his son they sit down the restaurant this man happened to walk by and I think one guy sneeze and brother and say that man laid out of Steve's you knew he was a man right he said he said yes by the way he's nice and that's a man the way he sees - that's the kind of man I want to be but then they say here this guy come walk up in his son look up say daddy that look like you inflexion that's the life and they saying and the Lord just began to speak to him say now if you go and do what you want to do say your wife's gonna leave you if you go to the wielders say your wife don't leave you and say you gonna end up like a bum around a fire that's right so he had a desire to go to the will so here he's saying about Moses right say Moses an absolute failure and went to the wilderness if brother Branham had gone to the wilderness he would have been an absolute failure oh my see you know the same way God raised up a Moses to bring delivers to the children of Israel is the same way God raised up a prophet today to bring deliverance to the Bride of Christ Oh stay with me here it's the same exact thing it's not anything I'm telling you can go all in and out of Moses life you can see the types and brother brands like all through it right a man we know we know that this message is absolutely right you know I know people don't like for people us to say these things I know it offends folk I know it does not and I'm not saying this to offend anybody I'm saying this for truth sake the message is not an alternative to denominations it's not that you don't compare the message with denominations you don't whenever you start going down that thought process you miss the point of the message you hold you miss the whole message the message was to call us out of denomination and when it called us out I want to make us a new denomination everybody and I've been around a long time every brother that the rolls up to try to start another denomination it's falling apart because this cannot be denominated the holy ghost got control over this it'll never be denominator I don't care what anybody tries to do this will never be denominated now don't get me wrong you got people on the inside of this that got all kind of spirits on I'll be honest we haven't seen a lot in my day you wanna know what in the world the Holy Ghost produced that no the Holy Ghost didn't produce it didn't it didn't but don't get your eyes on the ones that's doing wrong and actually rather than spending so much time trying to fire one to the right be the one I found nobody you'll be the one that everybody else will follow beer that wine all right I'm going on in Jesus name I'm talk about a chosen generation he goes on to say they say let's listen say Moses and his absolute failure hat went into the will just now the type here there's a wonderful type that we sure don't want to miss see tight God was bringing Israel his people out a nation a nation out of a nation a nation out of a nation see the children Israel came out of Egypt that was a nation coming out of a nation hallelujah hope you with me right and and notice he says goes on says a beautiful type of today God is calling his bride out of a church Christian bride out of a Christian Church a bride church out of a church which is called in the Bible referred to now if we can look at that from a lot of different ways because we got you know we got the we got the bright coming out of the denominational Church now also you get that same denominational spirit in the message and you have the bride come out of that - glory to god I'm gonna say it again amen the bride comes out of the denominational Church but when that denominational spirit come into the message the bride will come out of that - that that's what's happening and God as God is doing the separating hallelujah church amen God doing the separating you you be wondering why this happened why'd it happen you know I was just sitting there thinking so you know God create situations pressure pressure get built up in situation even wonder why it's because God wants to move you and in order to move you he got to make you uncomfortable y'all heard the story of the eagle when it when it's time for the baby eagle it's a fly mama make the nest uncomfortable she take this silent 8:07 and I never felt that poked me like that before this yes yes it's the sameness right it's always been the same net but when you start taking this side and taking it out 9s ain't become very on councilman you have to get out and fly on your own anytime God making things uncomfortable in your life you get ready for a flight and I'm going to tell you right now there's many of us that are uncomfortable right now but get ready to fly Eagles don't get bound by the stall even spa barber school hurry somebody he was an art pal creatures heavenly creatures Oh glory to God Church glory to God a Manny Manny man I don't plan on being defeated in this hour I plan on having victory all right let me finish reading as if I can it says I got several notes from scriptures written down here on this blessed night it's called sometimes the chosen the elected or the remnant of the woman see it was called the bride what God by his foreknowledge ordained to be that is the bride comes out of the church see the whole thing is a church but God takes a people out of that church as a bride he said he would and he did it notice or he will do it now you know when I when I think about being a chosen generation brother branham you know just brings our attention Moses there you know how Moses they said Moses was a failure he as he went there into the wilderness he was an absolute failure and I bring you the type of brother branham had the same thoughts as Moses to Holy Ghost stopped him a man from going into the wilderness he want to do that Nagato so if you go you're going to lose your wife you're gonna lose everything he would have been an absolute failure had he done it so we see these types here but when I think about you know Moses coming on the scene and I think about the generations that lived in bondage there in Egypt you know I believe about ten generations of people that lived in bondage because the generation is represented by 40 years right 40 years represents a generation now we have to be careful with that because you know there's a statement I was I was looking for this one quote and I just found it this morning Amen as I was as I went to pick up my precious brother to bring him to church I'm listening to the tape from brother Branham make the make the statement on the table I'm like all praise God that's what I've been looking for right but what he was saying is that every day a generation fades away now we look at generations that's 40 years being a generation but every day a generation fades away you know why because every day somebody you know might be turning 40 or 41 or whatever and you moving onto something else or somebody passes away it's a generation phase away everything you are I mean when we when we look at this we try to try to put everybody in the same bucket but God got a set up as individuals right and so he said every day a generation is fading away so as I'm preaching this this I mean some us may go home before the coming of the Lord but there's somebody research that not going go home before the coming of the Lord their generation will not pass until everything people feel and I don't know about you but I'm putting myself in that generation I'm attack when you put yourself in that generation it causes you to live differently it causes you to respond to think differently when you put yourself in dajin I'm in the generation that will not pass until all things be fulfilled I'm in a generation that will catch the rapture I'm a part of that generation when you being that when you begin to look at life a man from that lens Church I tell you you don't have time to waste with the devil you don't have you don't have any time to waste with the devil you really want to give God everything you got and I'm gonna tell you this much if I die before Jesus return I'm going down with a promise I'm going down with a promise I died believing on it died waiting on it and saying I'm going to come up believing that the dead and Christ gonna rise first and you which I allow to remain I'm going to be caught up to meet y'all in the air we'll see Christ together I'm going I'm going down on a promise but imma live every day like it's my last day I'm a part of a chosen generation I thought about Israel 10 generations that we're waiting for delivers to come a man they're the bondage that they went through and you know I wrote the children Israel would have been they would have thought that they were the chosen ones in their day 400 years of bondage having the opportunity to finally be released from the Egyptians and that final generation that left age of oh my god they knew that they were the chosen generation can you imagine all the you know all the weapons they got all the beatings that they got all all the long nights all the hard days but but here comes a time where Moses comes in and God gives them a mighty delivers day with a thought of themselves that we must be the chosen generation but think about it think about this to generate what generation to live in to see the place strike Egypt to see the Death Angel pass through the land to strike the homes of those who have not followed the words of the prophet Moses they experienced the delivers they experienced the parting of the Red Sea they experiencing the death to the Egyptians I love Moses were say the Egyptians that you're seeing today you'll see him no more forever they experienced him those those those Egyptians died there a man in the Red Sea but that generation that would have thought that they were the chosen generation was the same generation that died wandering in the wilderness rather than enjoying the Bliss of the land flowing with milk and honey that generation fell to enter the promised land but gave birth to a new generation a generation that did go in a man and enjoy the blessings of the promised land Church I tell you what you know even when we think about that and we just compare it to today there was I mean the generation that saw the Prophet the generation that was here a man to be a part of the meeting that generation a man that that I mean some of the testimony that they share with us that gives us strength I mean even now but you know what there were still many in that generation that that went to the meetings that still did not understand the ministry of the Prophet all glory hallelujah as you know I've been reading a little bit and you know and and in my reading I just been finding that not only was brother Branham he wasn't only when they had a tent that was going around from city to city and preaching there were so many others doing it and getting results Oral Roberts had a tent that would see 12,000 people and they were filling up and get results hallelujah right I mean they were other great men of God our Billy Graham had a tent go around and he got his fill up stadiums with people and it got all califo coming down to the altar the resent my they had that but with nowhere I looked at that because you know uh if I was to be honest you know there were there were many about our forefathers I want you to just kind of stay with me there are many of our forefathers that were underneath some of those tents and when they went underneath some of them said some of the things that they saw God do they can't get those things out of their mind they want to see God do the exact same thing again today but we're living in the time now it's hard to set up a tent like that things have changed you just can't go from city to city property you might get Amen some authority coming to such a tech town but you don't have the freedom to move like that anymore the nation has changed everything has changed because we're in a new generation and then this generation this is a generation that's going to see the coming of the Lord oftentimes we think in our minds like Lord I would have loved to been back there underneath the tent I would have loved to been there saw the blinded eyes come open I would have loved to have been there and you know I mean brother branham explains how that the work the one young girl comes up leaving for and she has no eyes in a socket not just blind no eyeballs at all none whatsoever and here she comes to the prayer line to be playful and brother branham prays for the young lady and in the middle of his prayer he stops and he looks at the young lady and he says I forgot to ask you I'll talk about a girl that got no eyes I forgot to ask you what color eyes who you won't and the girl of the girl say I want it I forget what color she said I wanted this and I said okay okay bow your head let's pray and he prays it right down the spot the eyes begin to fall and the girl got to face the color that she requested we had people that were our witnesses that saw these things right I mean you I mean who or what us I mean my god you want to get everything you had to get in services like that you were the took time off your job to get in services like that Oh hallelujah right we would have did everything we anything possible I got to be in this service there were men that would drive all the way from Georgia to Indiana right just on the weekend just to be in the service because they knew any time a man they got together God was going to move when you listen to the tapes you can hear I don't no matter what the sermon is no matter how deep it is no matter how shallow it is it doesn't matter the angel the Lord always showed up whatever city was him the age of the Lord was right there you would alone to be in something like that even all robbers was saying how one time he had a school of blind like nine blind kids came to his meetings and he sent there and he were praying and he prayed and all nine of them received in sight nine now you know people people thought I haven't got moving and that generation I just knew that they were man we are a chosen generation who who else has laid awake sight on things like this but when Peter writes these things he's not talking to that generation Peter writes this for us ones that didn't see it with our eyes ones that didn't experience those type of meetings and sometimes because of the experience of the meetings Amen if we would be honest with ourselves we lonely lonely be a part of that sometimes the devil would discourage you and make you feel like God ain't even doing nothing no more because you just hear about a little miracle here and another one there and the number it's just it's just except that it's a sign that the season has changed but God didn't change just a season change hallelujah God is still God and if you have a need he's able to meet your needs glory to God we might not have ten floors 12,000 coming to attend right but but when you look at when you look at you know of those things that was that was for that season now God has moved into another season I was bringing in how you know Peter you know when you just think about him writing such words as this how could why would Peter say ye our chosen generation and I just I just began to really meditate on Petersons are Peter went through a lot Peter himself was there a man when Jesus walked the earth Peter was in his meetings Dina was there to see five thousands get there Peter's data feed four thousand get there Peter saw summits Peter also walked on water the only man that got born just like us that walked away Jesus walk Peter walked on water yet he might have some but he also walked and you would think that you would think that if Deena's experiencing things that Peter would say I am the chosen generation but Peter I sees weren't sixty years after Jesus had time Peter says ye are a chosen generation think about it I want you to really think about it what is it that Peter seeing you know I was I was just going through Peter encounter Christ and Luke five when he took a lot out into the deep end drop his net Club drop drop Peter saw what God could do for him Peter saw Christ healed his mother-in-law he was so sick with a fever and and one prayer changed things just like that she was up serving every rider Peter saw that with his own life Peter walked on water heated up when Christ was being taken to be crucified Peter was the one that did not him in curse while doing it Peter was there a man when Jesus rose again he he went and told us I mean it's total women that he's risen and told her something I go tell my disciples and tell Pina that I'm Lissa hallelujah six peter was commanded to feed the sheep and the Lambs he was a part of a generation that experienced the outpouring of the Holy Ghost at Pentecost Peter did all this and you would have pump but sure that this man was the part of the chosen generation but after all the things that occurred Peter likes ye our chosen generation why would Peter write these things why would Peter write these things because I believe Peter got a glimpse of the second coming of the Lord hallelujah and that glimpse of the second coming of the Lord it caused Peter to live under expectation come on church because when you get a glimpse of the second coming Lord you will begin to live under expectation amen everything say I appear to begin to live on expectation and then he was there when Jesus spoke and he was also there when the angel spoke I want to break that down Matthew 17 Matthew 17 glory to God glory to God glory to God now there's a lot here in Matthew 17 I'm just trying to hit the highlights Peter what Peter writes that ye are a children generation the reason that Peter could write this is because Peter got a glimpse of the second coming of the Lord and he's looking at that generation that would be on earth at the time of Jesus second coming and they say ye are chosen generation you're chosen because you got to be experiencing the second coming of the Lord oh it's not just going to be a word that somebody shared but it's going to be a manifestation in the moment in the twinkling of eye you're going to be changed Oh glory to God the LAT the last the last thing you know that we're waiting on is a change another body and church we're living in that generation where we can expect at any time now oh yeah I believe that I'm a part of this chosen generation I'm a royal priesthood I'm a holy nation I'm a peculiar people glory to God listen listen to what the scripture says in Matthew 17 let's read says that after six days Jesus taketh Peter James and John his brother and bringeth them up into the high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and it's faith this shine as the Sun and his raiment was white as the light and behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elijah talking with him now can you imagine Peter standing there looking at this and as Peters looking at this dis imeem never seen this happen before and I must be a part of a chosen generation look at look at where I am one of the only Witnesses on the earth to see something like this but yet Peter doesn't call himself the chill generation he calls you that oh my church we don't know how special we are we don't we don't realize how special we weren't here when Jesus was here we weren't here when the Prophet was here we weren't here when Paul was here we weren't here when Moses and Elijah and all of them we weren't here but nonetheless we are without all the signs wonders and miracles do you mean now I'ma just drop this in do you realize that sermon the Baptist was called the greatest of all all the prophets until that time he was the greatest of all the prophets and he never worked one me he was the greatest without a miracle being word we would think look at what he lodges did Colin fired an affirmance that's got to be a great profit but Jesus and that German fact there was no light German abductors he was the greatest until that time he was the greatest and the reason John the Baptist was the greatest is because he introduced the Messiah the first coming of the Messiah and the reason keeps a go to the past because brother branham's ministry was to introduce Messiah a second time and the people that are living waiting for Messiah they are a chosen generation Alleluia somebody if we knew who are just some time I just Lord let me really think about this what did you call me to without miracles if I did if I've never saw a miracle I'm still the chosen generation but we are seeing miracles we are seeing miracles we just we got our precious let's just shared about the doctors finding nothing that's a miracle my daddy was a miracle i'ma still share his testimony you know but you should mind my daddy had it God gave him testimony before he called him home God God God actually showed my daddy he was calling him home he showed him he had a dream before he even left and daddy went back in his mind I mean the dream God took him back to his early childhood years took him through his teenage years took him through his 20s took him through 30s he just he just start replaying his whole life and he was in his 60s and when he got to 70 he said everything went dark everything went dark he couldn't see no further than 70 God let him get to 71 and called him home that was God telling him what he was doing for him and I would tell you my daddy went down with a promise and before he went down with the promise he showed the devil that he could overcome cancer so that that way I get no victory no whatsoever I know what God my family experience the healing power of God went when the angel or total throw the problem say say say not even can't will stand in the way of your prayer O glory and as my daddy was leavin he just singing walk in the light beautiful that's a testimony glory to God some of y'all hang on taste test and the reason you're not because you're part of a chosen generation oh my I got a hold me a so many quotes I can't read them all brother Brennan said he says it says if I'm not one that will actually experience that I want to preach to young people that will experience it that's not close we are I want to preach the young people that will experience it you are living in a day where Jesus is coming at any time so if you're living in that day live right live right Matthew 17 first verse verse 3 behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elijah talking with him then then after Peter and said unto unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here if thou wilt let us make here three times and ackles one 4d1 by Moses wonderful Iser he's so excited Peter seeing I'm seeing Moses my daddy told me about Moses I only heard about Elijah through my reading what might what they taught me but I'm seeing this with my own eyes you would think Peter would feel like he's the chosen generation look at it and while he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear you him don't build no Tabernacles here Peter don't do that Peter get so excited so excited it was always like that I mean if you went back to the previous chapter Peter Peter was given the keys of the kingdom of heaven right and he told me whatever you bind on earth shall be bound and had whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven I mean Peter just because he had a mighty revelation that he was the Christ a subtle Living God Peter Peter received just you know receive the keys but a few verses later Peter sitting there and Jesus telling that he's gonna have to die too got to do this and Peter said no no I rebuke that jesus said get thee behind me Satan the same guy that just got keys in the same guy that's being told Satan has anointed him Oh Lord I hope we get that the same guy that just got keys is the same guy he got blessed by Jesus and anointed by Satan always in the same day now y'all get met blessed by Jesus blessed are thou simon barjona flesh and blood have not revealed it unto thee he does say that and nobody else it says Peter and upon this rock the rock of Revelation I'll build my church and the gates of Hell cannot prevail mighty mighty service but after church after church fellowshipping just having a little conversation the same guy that thought he had so much revelation man on Jesus wit not what you just said is off the word I ain't I ain't going for that Jesus no I'm not that's up get thee behind me Satan but he didn't call Peter Satan he just that state was anointed Peter and you got to know when stateless anointing people Oh glory you you you have to know these things if they not a devil you ain't calling them a devil no they sons and daughters of God but it's a double anointing that and then you just to get me behind me Satan cuz I ain't going back into that lifestyle o Church of the Living God listen I want to go on here Peter the reason Peter could say that ye are chosen generations because Peter got a glimpse of the second coming of the Lord and what we're seeing here Matthew 17 is a glimpse of the second coming of the Lord now there's I'm just reading these watch this verse 5 while he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased see you him and when the disciples heard it they fell on their face and were sore free can I can I just drop something in right there there used to be a time in my and my my Christian journey I used to use I used to question why people be falling out in the spirit isn't that biblical because when we've kind of focus laying they have sheets although just throwing this on them thrown I mean they had sheets for everybody sheets in the in the chairs always did sisters had to be ready with a sheet y'all saw y'all stop my wife you last week she had to be ready that best way we was trained did y'all see that one sister got the singing real good and she got the singing and when she was stumbling as a little boy who she you know this this gonna be something and and and I saw I'll just look at see well who's gonna do what what is everybody and I think everybody else be sitting having the same on thought who gonna do when wife got on up and just kind of you know see training that that's what we used to do but when they used to come back in that day they came with a white sheet so they come like this and they have a white sheet they take that they take a jacket from one of the brothers over the brother thing wearing jackets no more the brothers don't do that in the moon I'm talk about what we did we came to church we came with our suits looked like we was going to see a king Wayne looked like we was going to a club we look like we was going to see a king all right amen and we need to get back to that and stay with it come like you're coming to see a king you know sometimes the way we dress conjure Chi when even go to work dress like that you wouldn't go to work dressed like that if you're going for interview what you put on what you put on when you go to the interview and you go with your chance a lot what you do when you go to interview you go to the interview of yourself I don't come to church with your chest ah hello somebody glory to God I'm talking about what it used to be we need to go back to that Amen I'm Ted if you can't afford a suit that's all right I've know some brothers around here that will bless you with a suit I don't seen them do it no but a man's got shallow the truth even high a man brothers got to watch the way they dress too we always talk about the sisters but brothers do too ain't man yeah I mean especially if you got a really good bill you can't be wearing that tight until that's the same thing with a sister she get we got a written oh please sister you know god none bless you don't do that it's the truth even higher don't do it tell the devil no I'm not gonna dress like that and nowadays Oh Lord hello I mean Oh people just put anything on what are you doing nothing - come on take it you present yourself holy alright Amen i'ma leave it right there but brothers and sisters need to be careful with the way that they dress amen they may have your pants a little too tight get them laid out or buy some other ones you know if they too tight Holy Ghost shouldn't have them sitting and preached on that all the times you know if your clothes too tight and ain't no ain't no brother in this church to have a pair skinny jeans what you think that came from what do you think what do you think skinny jeans came from men they never tried to look like that well I love some skinny jeans that's so that's a that's a demon from hell a nineteen people got even older man walking around and skinny jeans you know Church we got to get right we talked about rapture conditioned chosen people people that chose it and peculiar don't dress like that all right i'ma get on with my topic here but I just you know I was talking about how you know they they used to come with the sheet and if they didn't have a sheet then the brothers would have a jacket and they can just you know give them a packet brothers don't have that no more we used to have it but we need to go back to that we come into the house of the Lord all right all right um but that they would come and you know I just I just watch the sitting I look I sitting and I know who got who know who's gonna help who gotta help and I saw two sisters get up one was my wife and the other one was sister Wesco so let's go come all the way up from the bank she just you know joyfully walking up there my wife just kind of eased up there just next aryans kind of puts her arm around just to know we got you and you got to get them before they get you and I stayed sisters go to everydays feet yes that's where you got to watch your heels you hurt somebody you're getting to skate with them things on you were hurt somebody not only that should hurt yourself you can sy you have to kick them off you came dancing that well why you wearing it you can dance in it and now you coming to church to get your dance are you coming to church just so people can see your shoes hello somebody we talked about getting the rapture conditions right yes at the time then we get a nice good suit but but that suit might get snotted on y'all ever heard that before they all ever experienced that not at all I said imma say it again it's not at home when the Spirit of God to get the moving so good and folks just to get to crime I've been a part of some services y'all I mean you just get the crime in the spirit and lick the crying get so so powerful you just can't control it and why are you just crying and and then here come you know your place is getting flushed the tears coming out and man everything coming out of the nose and and you lookin for somebody to go hook you know what the person inside gets so in the spirit when they see you coming they can't help but embrace you and next thing you know they got stuff flowing out of them to see if you if you if you if you if you get that kind of thinking out not not all along you Colonel I want to go back to some of them services I want to see God do it all of it I mean God used to wash up sup clean up hop we leave Church knowing that we've been in the presence of Almighty God we don't even want to go out there and we just we just come back looking for more than God is able to do with Church glory to God let's see back back in those days that that's where we approach things and you know and and I mean we were just ready for when God was moving you had certain people that was kind of on duty all the time but other that they're gonna get they're gonna get they praise and you need you you need that you need that let me get back here to the scripture Church I'm trying to get you to see you you you you are the chosen generation chosen look at it it's verse 6 and when the disciples heard it they fell on their faces I was saying that I used to question how why would people be followed on the spirit but one brother shared me say now there is many times in the Bible where they fell on their faces that means they was in the spirit and when the Spirit of God gets so real to you you'll following your face - now let it be the spirit though because I have been into some churches they even in the spirit they just come soon as they come get out the car come sit in the front seat first song go play they lay on their face I'm like what what are you doing who's this it's just all lucky in the spirit no not that I don't think that's it you don't practice that you know I'm playing that that ain't that anyway that's work I'll talk about when the Holy Ghost get ahold of you I don't see the Holy Ghost get ahold of people and it's like when they fall the chair just move out the way and people don't get hurt when the Holy Ghost is all right praise the Lord all right let me go in and when the disciples heard they fell in phases I'm so free and Jesus came and touched him and said arise and be not afraid and when they lifted up their eyes they saw no man save Jesus only see let's go on send as they came down from the mountain Jesus charged them saying tell the vision of no man until the Son of Man be risen again from the dead and his disciple of Aksum saying why then say the scribes that Elijah must first come now notice is the scripture jesus answered and said unto them Elisha truly shall first come and restore all things they are speaking of two different comings of Elijah as I go on verse 12 says but I stand through that Elijah has come already now we got Jesus Jesus said in logic truly shall first come and then we also got Jesus saying he'll I've just come already they had to know which Elijah he was talking about and today we got to know which Elijah he's talking about now they caught it they caught it because the Bible said it called it look at this but I've sent me that lives have come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the Son of man suffer them didn't the cyclist understood it but he spake unto them a John the Baptist now he never called his name but they understood it and from when he said Elijah truly shall first come and restore all things that was brother branham's ministry that's why I say this is not an alternative to denomination this was the restoration of all things Peter got a glimpse of the second coming of the Lord he was right there let me read a quote for you a couple of them patmans vision and Peter get with this glimpse of the coming of the Lord second coming of the Lord he could call you the chosen generation look at this the patents of interstate now notice before Jesus returns to earth now this is a little ahead of time but the spirit of Elijah will return back to the earth and in the hearts of the children back to the fathers says uh the Bible said so Jesus saw him Jesus saw him here the pasta saw him here the order of the coming of the Son of man glorified he used to be glorified and coming back the first thing before they saw him was what Elijah and what Moses Israel returning yonder the lawkeepers and then the glorified son of man hallelujah do you see the order of his coming the spirit of Elijah or the witness of the last church age see coming in power to manifest him now I'm going to go a little further I want to I got another quote Revelation chapter 4 that I want to read on that but one when we think about this just by what Peter saw in Matthew 17 when he saw Moses and Elijah talked with him that was representative of what we see today oh my church we're seeing it I just preached a few months ago how the Jews are recognizing that brother Branham was the fulfillment fulfillment of Malachi 4 Jews have started recognizing that the Jews will follow Moses and Elijah oh but before Jesus comes glorified I mean we're gonna see we gotta see this pretty real Isaac comes to earth we've already saw it already happened in brother Branham oh my god Peter saw these things and when he's when he saw he called you a chosen generation you weren't here to see the Prophet but just here to see the things that the things that the Prophet promised would be fulfilled they're being manifested amen you are chosen generation revelation 4 this is the message Revelation chapter 4 he says John called and summoned by the Lord Jesus promised by God back there that he would see the coming of the Son of man Peter James and John and them standing present when Jesus spoke to him said there's something stat there some standing year will not taste of death until they see the Son of man coming he didn't say all was standing here but and they went few days after that and saw the order of the resurrection rehearsed listen and the coming of the Lord Peter got a glimpse of this right Elisha represent it he says I mean Moses and being resurrected Elisha represented the translated punch he was saying Moses represented the dead Saints right here Stan but Elisha represented the translated bunch those that have died in Christ right since remember Moses was first in large it was to be the messenger of the last day that with him and his group would come the resurrection well it would come to come come the rapture I mean Moses brought in the resurrection and Elijah brought in the rapture group whoa my Moses brought in the resurrection but Elijah brought in the rapture group there both of them was represented right there here Peter got a glimpse of the coming of the second coming of the Lord and in being able to see that he could write these words to you ye are the chosen generation if you never experience another miracle which I believe you will but if you never do you're still a part of the chosen generation if you never see the blinded eyes come open you're still a part of the chosen generation if you never you know asea like and brother brown's day you know maybe a man with a club foot one foot shorter than the other and then right down the spot the foot begin to grow it's still a part of a chosen generation we got to keep it balanced I'm not saying that we should look for these things because I'll tell you what if I'm going through something I'm looking for God to bring me healing and I'm gonna confess every promise that he spoke over me but we talk about massive campaigns 12,000 people being under 10 and and seeing all kind of things happen like that we probably won't see that God has changed the season that's changed from that but nonetheless we are part of this chosen generation I think about just so much to happen in brother branham's days so many things even be even right before it got called him on the field I think of the generation that lived to experience this Sousa Street revival the ones that experienced the Welsh revival a policeman so full of the Spirit of God huh so full of the Spirit of God that that when people come from all over flying ants they sir they look in action for directions they didn't have Google back then they had to stop an extra directions they were they you know they actual direction they say say sir could you tell me how to get to the lost revival look and a policeman I wonder if we have some policemen on the force today that could do stuff like that the policemen say sir you're looking at the Welsh revival I am the Welsh revival you're looking for a building that was revival inside of me maybe they thought they had arrived what a generation look at a mighty move of the Spirit of God amongst the people those revivals gave birth to another generation that saw people moved from tent to tent to experience the presence of God there were great healing revival sweep of the nations Jack Cole or Roberts Billy Graham Tommy Hicks TL Osborn are just some of the ministers that we use but it goes on here even the Prophet was on the scene during this mighty tent revival many experienced the presence of Christ and his leanings as was seen in Scripture he revealed the secrets of the hearts revealed the mysteries of God eyewitnesses a still alive who either saw the angel or felt his presence some experienced a blast that shook the rocks in Sunset Mountain seven angels had come to Commission the Prophet to go east and preach success the seven seals what testimonies we have them blessed a here but that generation was not the climax God had another generation that was coming along to experience the greatest event that will ever happen on the earth and that event is the second coming of the Lord it was predestinated for this chosen generation church I don't know about you but I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them oh I'm one of them I'm one of them let me finish by reading just a couple quotes here oh I know who I am I know who I am this is out of one in a million and also I read the seven compound names of Jehovah look at this the Prophet says there's approximately 500 million so-called Christians in the world today notice and each day I generate that each day and a generation and now what if the wraptor would come today and 500 people university would be taken in the rapture you would never know or even see in the paper of them going and the coming of the Lord is a secret coming he'll come and still away it'll be such a minority till just like it was in the days when the disciples X Jesus why does the scribe see that Elias must first come it happened when people had no idea it happening same thing I happen today listen say why why does the scribe sin of their lives must first come he said he is already coming you never knew it did you ever think what the people did they went right on believing that Alliance was coming and he was right among them and they didn't know it so will it be in the coming of the Son of Man they'll do with him just the same thing the Spirit of God is here well what are we going to do with it are we going to eat manna and so forth and not continually move up as we grow all right 7 compound names of Jehovah Oh my church if there's ever time to grow up that time is now there's ever time to mature in Christ that time is now we are in the last days the signs are all around us now God's just waiting on us amen look what the prophecy is every prophecy everything that I know of that I could see the scripture has been fulfilled already waiting for the coming of the Lord and as I've said as I said last night I believe that the coming of the Lord Jesus second coming is past two already past two and like it was in the days of Noah the long-suffering God waited not willing any should perish and he's just waiting waiting now with his long suffering that is coming already past - waiting to get the church in order so the Second Coming can take place what about that friends I got a question are you holding holding us up look at your neighbor just look at your neighbor and ask them are you holding us up some of y'all they looked an axe nobody nothing I asked you are you holding us up how many y'all just really like living here I can't wait to get out I can't wait to get out my god we've talking about this morning say no more say in church no more sin the whole atmosphere changes right you work to keep the keep keep keep your bills paint right the keep keep keep up you know the creditors off your back that's why you go to work you can't I mean even if you enjoy what you do you still there for a purpose and the reason you keep them doing yeah I remember brother Reggie soon some go wrong on the job he leave I think him and his wife had a conversation now you can't just leave every time so I'm gonna go right on the job you got them doing some stuff and the reason you're into it because if some people they got to be paid every month we just put up with a lot of stuff church and we have to do that right but there's coming a time ring I have to we have to work like that number one church I don't know about you but I'm looking forward to it I can't I can't wait to get out of here there's nothing to look forward to nothing but a rapture amen yeah my god even if you were a billionaire you know you can spend all that money there's only so much you can do and so many times you can go to the same old place and not get bored honey I'm a travel I'm going to Paris I'm going to London I'm you can do that right now and not be a billionaire you can do that right now they have meetings all the time just save up a little money you can go do that but I mean people think you got I'm gonna do this you gonna still get bored you're the only satisfaction that you find in life is when you come to know Jesus you can have all that and still be miserable ask some of the ones that's not their experience that right now still this miserable that they want to be glory to God all right I'm gonna lead at churches don't hold this up whoever it is don't hold this up please it's time to get out of here and God just been so patient waiting on me waiting on you right let's look at what he says here the second coming it's past due already past doing like it was in the days of no the long-suffering God waited not willing innocent perish and he's just waiting packages you know I just watch God know what you getting ready to do when you leave here if you got some sin in your mind then I'm gonna do this I got I got to go do it God already know what you give me to go do now God could block you he could actually there's multiple ways to get blocked he could actually come down to say you ain't going nowhere he can do that he can let you get in your car and right when you get the way useful to be accident that's I'm blocking you right there's all kind of ways he could sense online message don't you go do that know what you think about doing good though it used to be people used to be in tune with the Spirit of God that they would come tell you things like that you think I'm not killing somebody don't you go do that just like that discernment of spirit was so real I'm gonna tell you I think the reason that we don't miss the lobby's things is because we got too many things taking our attention from God we got rid of the TV but then the devil brought the Internet and I'm not saying you can't be on the internet but just dis notice how the devil works right and then no more line got in and amounts you got a cellphone and then he brought every app that you can imagine on your cell phone and you just get locked into it's just too much to take our time from God and now that our time has been taken from God that's why we don't have the power the way we used to had it back in these Bible days they had no internet and no televisions they have nothing to take their tent you know not it did have theater they have C ater not like the way the way we got the day it was the Greek that came in to act and they would get called down to the theater to watch what the Greeks were doing so the CA didn't start amongst the Israelites it was a Greek peculiar people didn't go to the movies I thought I could peculiar people dating to specific look y'all need to know all this stuff come from if the devil that's trying to get you off space and then it just hinders us and holds us back we waiting on you we waiting on you we waiting on you to get free from that saying how much longer do we got to wait all right waiting now with his loan suffering that he has come and already passed to waiting to get the church in order so the Second Coming can take place I want y'all to see that he's waiting they had the church in order so the Second Coming can take place what about that friend what kind of people are we to be to realize that this day may be the last day that will ever be mortal tomorrow we may be immortal this is the only day we may ever have in our life the last meeting will ever set together and work for the kingdom of God how are this leading to be conducted that tonight then with the very very highest of reverence that with all of our hearts we're leaning to the Lord Jesus to give us every soul that's here that isn't converted to help do something that a cause the unbeliever and the lukewarm to look on and receive the Lord Jesus Christ if you were to go back and even read more in Peter 2nd Peter chapter 3 Peter even asked the same question about you know what's what matter of living should we be conducting now what ways you would be living knowing that the second coming the Lord was not not some some far-off it's upon us right now it's upon us right now you're living in it problem is is that we get so desensitized we forget where we live in don't do it Church whatever you do amen draw closer to Christ if there was ever time just I mean like the Bible say lay aside every sin and every wait that's so easy but census that's something that we all got to do every last one of us got to find some things are not sin but they are weight and not sin because you know that's the first question people ask will I go to hell over this why you always want to answer some tax that already let you know if you come up with that question will I go to hell over this that's a weight that's the weight and the Bible say lay aside every sin and wait you already know what thing is going to send you to hell and you avoid a nose but now we talk about wait a mentor wings you got to get rid of them it's hard to walk it's hard to run when you weight it down that's why you Steven runners they take off everything some of them need to keep on some of but they take off everything when they run because they don't want to be weighted down amen if you're going to run this race for Christ get rid of the things of the world get rid of all that it's nonsense it's not necessary let's get right searching let's go home ye our chosen generation a man let's pray father how grateful we are to know that you have called us in a time like this when we can just really look at these things Peter and all that he experienced in all of his life man that experience you feeding 5,000 then another time feeding 4,000 just impossible things that he saw God there to see the the get a glimpse of the second coming of the Lord and even think it to himself let's just build three Tabernacles right here one for Moses one for Elijah one for Jesus hearing the voice from heaven tell them no no this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased hear you him having questions that others have their mind they had the opportunity to ask why why does the scribe st. Elias must first come and to get the answer so clear that Elias truly shall first come and restore all things but I am to thee day Elias has already come and they didn't know it and they're the disciples understood elected man selected men that were chosen by God to catch a revelation for their day they caught it they lived Peter experiencing the the ability to walk on water what a what what this man would know he would have known that he was a part of a chosen generation but yet sixty years after the death of Christ Peter penned these words in the book of first Peter showing that it wasn't his generation but it was another generation that would be called the chosen generation and when we look at ourselves we fit the description god help us to be ready don't let us become so desensitized to the things of this world that we really miss what this is all about there's anything in our lives that's not pleasing to thee god please help us to get rid of it the Bible declares that we are to lay aside every sin and every weight that so easily besets if their sins we need to be washed to those things immediately if their weights got let your spirit deal with us until we lay
