we're already having church praise the lord we greet you in the precious name of jesus christ and you may be seated just a minute we just greet you get warmed up just a little bit but it is a privilege to be able to fill in for our pastor this morning he was away and just worked out good that way so it's a real honor to stand in his pulpit and to be able to fill his shoes i'll never fill his shoes but it's an honor to do it this morning it's an honor to speak to you just catching just a little vacation here we planned to come down in february and got covered in february when i was here in december your pastor got it and then i got i had to cancel the vacation so we just now uh come back down for that week that we had planned in february so it just worked out to be in fellowship with you and we're just appreciate the what the lord is doing here we always hear good things from this church in west palm always hearing good things and every once in a while my my wife puts up the face book of your services and i don't have facebook but she puts it up and she said boy they're having church down there so i wish i was down there [Music] so what a blessing it is and we feel very much a part of your assembly here we're praying with you and the pastor and often he shares the need for another place to worship and i know in time god will open up the doors we've helped give a little bit towards it as well we want to support that not only with our prayers but with our giving so we have already given we will give more because we believe that this is a good work going on here we believe it's going to grow we believe that you need space a little bit more space and the need has been for a long time and so we're not going to back down we believe that god's going to open up the doors and give you a place yes and when he does it he'll do it in a big way because i've because i have seen it over and over again and so we appreciate you i'm gonna i have some of my family with us actually most all the girls i have my two daughters and gabriella my youngest daughter her friend hannah is with us hannah challenger is with us on their 18th this is their 18th well it's not their 18th birthday it's their graduation trip that i paid for to come to florida so they're both 18 stand up gabi and hannah they don't want to stand up they're refusing to stand up they on vacation they don't have to stand and then my daughter amariah and my wife is with us so it's i'm outnumbered here it's just one guy and all the girls but it's a privilege and mri has my my first grandchild my granddaughter with us as well and that's been a real joy to us to have her yes such a blessing to have them down and i mostly been it's not been a vacation for me i've been babysitting most of the week while amari enjoys the trip but that's good we all grandparents to here we enjoy it it's great sister erica's amen they say that that grandchildren are the reward for not killing your own kids it's what they say there's a lot of truth to that right there [Laughter] oh my praise the lord i'm going to have them come hannah if you want to get that man i have my two daughters and my wife come and i did we did something just recently i gave one of these to brother duff we had some good fellowship with him and his wife tuesday night and i've always wanted to do a cd with just my my kids all their lives and just my wife and my kids and so we just finished this last year and uh it was such a blessing to be able to get it done i should have done it when they were kids now they're all grown and my youngest is 18. took me that long to get to this and my boys are about ready to finish college and go off and rya is married and so but we finally got it done last year i have a few copies with me so there's a song on here that the girls sing that i wrote and i thought i would try it this morning we've never done it yet um in public but it's a song about you sisters it's out of isaiah 4 beautiful branch of the lord and i'm not much of a guitar player but i'm going to try to play that this morning a little bit it'll be a little different than what you're used to here we love your all's music this will be a little different come girls and get ready um but this one is one off the cd called beautiful branch of the lord i'll do a little job here trying to play the guitar for it but it's mostly the words i think that you enjoy i think [Music] there will be seven women take hold of one man they will do their own thing they will have their own plan and yet in that day they'll be whim set free truly expressing what they're meant to be beautiful branch of the lord women of god who the savior doors wonderful glorious fruit of his holiness beautiful branch of the lord i will honor my father stay under his wing i will serve my dear husband as unto the king and my labors to rise up and care for my own will be blessed and rewarded someday at his throne beautiful branch of the lord women of god who the savior doors wonderful glorious fruit of his holiness beautiful branch of the lord at the end when it seems there's no pureness in sight when the church as a whole seeks the pleasures of night christ will wash by his word his elected by grace not one spot not one wrinkle his light in her face beautiful branch of the lord of god who the savior adores wonderful glorious fruit of his holiness beautiful branch of the lord beautiful branch of the lord this bride of christ to the savior adores wonderful glorious fruit of his holiness beautiful branch of the lord beautiful branch of the lord amen to that [Music] it's way too tight in here for me little girls there's no reason i'm praying for a big church for space behind the piano and everywhere no captain praise lord isn't that true how many appreciate our sisters our women that hold up the standards in the lifestyle amen you're the sisters there's not enough praise that goes towards the sisters that are holding up the bible calls you the beautiful branch of the lord in the end time not just the bride but these sisters that are holding that up and you're to be praised for a woman that feareth the lord shall be praised and they're not praised enough and i like to do that i appreciate them so much and the lord gave me that song we were just finishing up the album and we had a couple more songs to write to finish it off and i had that in my heart i just needed to get it written and glad i finished it up [Music] i was going to have them sing this one with me but i think i can only get one out of them this morning as i sing this all by myself we should treat one another with the heartmost respect understand and be kind with great love to project if we really saw each other through god's eyes there's a royal blood we all would recognize born of royalty his sons and his daughters children of the king the character of his kingdom and his glory be revealed in you and me [Music] we are a family [Music] we are bored of royalties when we become way too common forgetting who we are we can take ones for granted who are special to god's heart the way i treat my brother i treat christ for these he win and paid the highest price his sons and his daughters children of the king that the character of his kingdom and his glory be revealed in you and me [Music] we are a family abraham stands before the throne when he proudly smiles and says well done to the ones he calls his own all our crowns will just lay down and start to worship our great king for there's only one thing left to humbly see we are his family born of royalty his sons and his daughters children of the king let the character of his kingdom and his glory be revealed in you and me we are his family we are born we are his family hallelujah hallelujah i want you to learn the course with me we are a family born of royalty born of royalty his sons and daughters his sons and he's the children of the king children of the king that the character of his kingdom that the character of his king and his glory be and his glory be revealed in you and me we are his family we are born his family born of royalty his sons and his daughters children of his kingdom and his glory be revealed [Music] [Music] his family one more time we are his family we are his family [Applause] [Music] his name amen amen amen let's turn in our bibles this morning together i wanted to sing that because it goes a little bit with what we want to share with you this morning in the word and once again we appreciate the privilege and the time together that we have a couple times a year sometimes we come down maybe once a year but it's a real privilege to be able to walk with you and i stand amongst royalty here this morning i believe that with all my heart it won't be difficult to preach because we are hungry people and we're hungry for one thing that's the open word of god amen we have that in common praise the lord we pray god blesses the pastor while he's away from us and blesses his preaching today's ministry to there in the i think he's in uh not charlotte where's he at and columbia i think he's this morning so we pray god will just be with him amen i'm going to read from a couple places one in the old testament one in the new and uh i just want you to turn if you would to nehemiah chapter 10 and there's so many different things that the lord has blessed us with in the word and praying and just looking at it and we're going to take a just a little different avenue might be just a bit of a teaching this morning and but we're going to do that and mind the lord amen a lot of different subjects a lot of different things that we could touch on and we have been on the series at home on joshua and these different things but we're going to go back into this and we pray that this will be an edification to the church here in west palm here this morning god bless you uh nehemiah chapter 10 and uh verse 28 nehemiah 10 verse 28 and the rest of the people the priests the levites the porters the singers the mythonyms and all they that had separated themselves from the people of the lands unto now notice they just didn't separate but they separated unto something it's one thing to separate but you've got to go to something and they all separate themselves from the people of the lands unto the word of god the law of god their wives their sons their daughters everyone having knowledge and having understanding they clave to their brethren their nobles and entered into a curse and into an oath to walk in god's laws which was given by moses the servant of god and to observe and to do all the commandments of the lord our god and his judgments and his statues these people once the word was restored to them and their temple was restored to them they felt it wasn't good enough they wanted to enter an oath together they wanted to separate from the peoples of the land and they wanted to cleave to one another and cleave to their wives you notice the relationship that is involved here it's not just that we separate from the world or separate from other people but we must cleave to something that's in the marriage covenant that god gave a man shall leave father and mother but he needs to cleave unto his wife here they clave to their brother and they claim to one another and they claim to the word of god very important as we see the people of god doing that now in the new testament we want to go to ephesians and see the same theme that paul is bringing in here in ephesians chapter 4 under the holy ghost church and here in ephesians 4 and verse 15. but speaking the truth in love ephesians 4 15 speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part now saints of god i know it's not difficult to see that paul says here that christ is the head but there's a body to the head and that body is joined together and every joint supply if i don't see anything there of individualism that someone separates himself if you're a holy ghost body member you are joined together with the body by spirit can you say man there is no man on an island doing his own thing if you've got the holy ghost you're joined together whether you whether you get along all the time with the person next to you it's not a personality thing it is it is something that is birth by spirit that every joint supplyeth when it is joined together and working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself it doesn't even say that that god does it we know god does it but it's edifying itself as it's joined together it's building up itself we don't need to necessarily have someone come from the outside and build it up the body's edifying itself amen i think those are powerful words heavenly father bless your word lord as we just cement ourselves to the word that you dropped in our heart last night we know this might be a little bit more of a teaching we don't know which direction it'll go but we know that your presence is here we know that we felt your presence we know the song the sister sang ministered to us in such a great way lord and we give you glory today through the songs of zion we give you glory speak to your people bless the pastor while he's away him and brother smiley just be with them lord anoint them and i pray you'll bless this church bless the future of this church fill every one of these seats and more with hungry souls i pray in the name of the lord jesus christ and we commit this service to you in jesus name amen god bless you may be seated now we're going to share some things here and uh some of the things are i will make assumptions that you have studied the book of nehemiah and there's so much in there about the people they had come to a restoration of the temple and that is a type of the bride because we've come to a restoration to the word so i'm going to make assumptions that you understand where we're jumping into the scripture i don't need to qualify that too much but we see that nehemiah's people and the people in the nehemiah was a people that was under the restored word in the restored temple of god and they had there's many great places in there where the the book was restored to them it was open to them they were the people of the open book the word was open and their response to the word was very special after some hundreds of years of rebellion and the reason the temple was destroyed and the reason the people were destroyed and went into captivity is because of the rebellion and getting away from the word once these people realized that god supernaturally had restored them brought them back to jerusalem gave them the power even by authorities to rebuild their temple they could only stand back and say god is in this god wants to restore our temple and so there was there was a respect there was an honor there was a there was a soberness in the people that we never want to do this again we want to hear one place that says in nehemiah that the people listen intently to the word of god no more playing games i want to know what this word says is because when i when we got away from this word our children got away from this word that's when everything fell apart and when they heard the word they said the people listened and i counted up the hours one time because they read all through the moses writings and all through the prophet's message it was some four or five and six hours they read it as the people listen intently the children all that's an amazing thing but they were so sober to the fact that i've got to hear and not only here the bible says they wanted the priest to explain it so they understood the word not just hear it but understand it i tell you under this open book with the seven seals taken over this book it's not just some book on a shell somewhere but it's the revelation that god gives it's the understanding of where we are we're not living in a time where we just read our bibles just like a baptist and i'm not knocking that but we're praying god reveal this book to me amen amen lack of revelation is how we get in trouble so the people of nehemiah were the word restored to them there's but there's just something further as we move into the end of nehemiah we saw that we found let me jump quickly to it what my subject is today there's something further that is essential that we look at and that is that we found that hundreds of people if not thousands found their individual places and begin to work in harmony after the temple was built they began to work in harmony together for the house of god and the reason they were working for the house of god is that's the place where the word was brought forth and that's the place his glory came down and so now we have people mentioned that had offices in the church of singers and porters and priests and methodisms and if you're saying what in the world is mythonyms well i'm i'm going to tell you in a few minutes methanes and all these different ones that just begin to work around the house of god and begin to give their all and most of all they begin to work together in harmony you find priests and levites and porters and singers and all these that found their place but they said they worked in harmony together for the house of god it wasn't just they had positions but they were working in harmony and i want to preach a little bit about working in coordination together when paul speaks about it he speaks about different gifts in the church and he says in first corinthians 12 28 he says and god hath set some in the church first apostles secondary prophets i want you to notice here how he breaks some of these things down and then then as the mythonyms are mentioned in the old testament the porters which you may not know what those are but those aren't the singers or the upfront people the porters sometimes worked in janitorial work the porters worked and assisted the priests in different things the nifonyms were helpers and workers that worked and just did about everything and anything in between that needed to be done i have a lot of nifonyms in my church if i didn't have them i couldn't have a ministry just as important as the priests porters and mythologies and so but paul know it words it this way and god has set some in the church notice god has set them in the church amen amen you don't set them in the church you don't take them out god sets them in the church amen when the holy ghost is leading the church he'll find those and place them sometimes be before they even get an official position they're already working in that because they've kind of found their place naturally by the holy ghost you know this isn't a mechanical thing this isn't a political thing god's church isn't run by politics can you say man or governments or something like that it should be ran by the holy ghost under the headship of the pastor can you say amen amen exactly amen so he says god has set some in the church first apostles secondary prophets thirdly teachers after that miracles then gifts of healing helps just when he says helps it just kind of seems like it lost its fervor to it you know we got apostles and prophets glory be to god helps just kind of falls off it helps it's probably what they thought nehemiah's day when he said mythonyms gifts of healing teachers miracles gifts of healing governments diversities of tongues helps i love it when my dad used to teach on this you know just the little word helps is just placed right in there but it's placed in there by god [Applause] and none of them are more important than the other amen just helps no big names they didn't bring the house down with a special singing it right right but the church needs helps any of you ever remember when jesus prayed that the lord of the harvest he said praise the lord of hearts there's a great harvest going on and pray the lord of harvest sins preachers no prophets no laborers in his vineyard amen amen hallelujah so don't take the helps out it's just as important as the rest i believe we're going to learn something here this morning [Music] are you with me so now in this day of nehemiah thousands came to worship but there were others who helped around the house of god with a goal in mind they had a goal in mind now you can have a lot of helpers and you can have a lot of positions and you can have people doing a lot of stuff but everybody has to have the same goal everybody has to have the reason why else it becomes churchianity it becomes some uh building up a pride of a position you have to have the same humble goal as everyone in that assembly and where did they find their goal they found it when they read through the scripture and read back in the first dedication of the temple when everything was in order when the 120 trumpeters were there all the musicians was in place solomon was in place the sacrifices were there everything was in order the temple was built and the children and all of them were reading that when solomon come and they brought the sacrifice and they entered the temple the glory of the lord came down [Applause] and it was so powerful such a thing that come in that place the minister couldn't even stand to preach because he come on the scene god come down and says this has my approval i see the harmony i see people working together i see the humility i see there's one goal and when god's seen that he says i'm coming down i'm filling this place with my glory [Applause] amen and when that's the goal you see people come to church with all different type of things on their mind people come to church and that's the problem we're not in one mind and one accord but we've got to get one goal and it's not about you being glorified it's not about your gift being seen we haven't had church unless he comes in the scene [Applause] amen so when you have the golden you can look back and see the little boy saying these boys on the front row here that's what happened daddy that's what took place that the glory of god filled that temple [Music] they did all that work they built the bricks they put it in place they had the porters they had the singers they labored for for years to get that temple done but daddy god came down the glory of lord we just had a service a couple weeks ago and i want to say something about it because i'll give glory to the lord i come to the end of the service and god just stopped me at the service just stopped and i had been reading the night before it really wasn't related completely with my subject but i said i got to say this i said did you know that brother branham's service after service all through the cities he visited he says he would look and see and he would say sometimes he would say he said there's a blackness there's a darkness over the congregation because there were skeptics there skeptics and actually skeptics hurt the atmosphere but then if you'll notice even in the film deep college to the deep that's one place he mentioned this he says oh he says this place is becoming milky he said i can hardly make out anything i can't see anything he says you're really beginning to believe now everybody's beginning to believe and the place is milky and he says hold on here he says anything could happen he said it about 80 times he said that milky thing came in the room and what was it simply was that there was some big no the people begin to believe and trust do you mean do you believe me to be god's prophet if you become a skeptic you're going to find things wrong but do you believe me to be god's problem you believe he had to get the people to believe and it was just simply that it was just lay down your skepticism and just believe it and when they seen this and he kept people going and there was enough miracles some people are doubting thomas but he went to city's friends where that milky spirit didn't come in that that no he went and he says some cities he said i don't know if i'll ever be back there because of the people's unbelief why is he saying i'm wasting my time if you're going to sit there as a skeptic your whole life it's we're not going to see it you're wasting time at church if god doesn't come down amen amen i got to the end of that and i just shared it real quickly and i says what would happen if you would trust me as a minister this morning see that's the problem today we have a lot of lack of trust nobody trusts anybody that's why people's hearts are locked up i'll go to church but i've got my wall up if that's the problem you got to trust somebody you got to trust somebody satan has destroyed your trust but you got to trust the man of god you got to trust that there's true ministers you can talk to me all day about false ministers and ones who fell in sin and a false doctrine i can talk only i got a number hundred of them to tell you about but if there's a false there's a real servant of god if there's a false dollar there's a true dollar we gotta trust and i said to the congregation how many will trust me right now how many trust me that i've preached the truth to you and they begin to raise i said how many needs healing got a brother with cancer in the church got a couple others that i didn't even know what they had how many brother bram says raise your hand right now because that that spirit is here if you raise your hand right now he pointed to a lady in a wheelchair he says if you get out of that wheelchair right now i believe you can come up and there was mass healings all over the congregation well my people begin to lift their hands people heal the cancer people heal their disease people heal all kinds of things in a moment's time [Applause] had a sister with a growth here on what was that on a thyroid under on her neck she had it for years and so in that service in the morning she claimed her healing wasn't till communion that night she was praying and worshipping the lord she wretched up and she didn't feel anything it was gone it was gone amen this has nothing to do with building up my church or anything like that for instance that if you believe and you trust just simple you don't have to do anything you have to be just a perfect can you say amen just begin to believe amen so many skeptics so many people with their walls up yeah no wonder we can't get any further they seen the glory of god come down in solomon's day glory of god came down any other reason for church that is lifted above that is a flawed reason any other reason for having church then him coming down is flawed they found their place they found their jobs they found their positions they found relationship and connection to one another appointed to a certain job around the house of god all the jobs were related creating an atmosphere in the house of god just lost a man been with me about 23 years just passed away and that brother some of this stuff i didn't expect to say today but just so dear to my heart right now i always told him brother gary i said i couldn't do what i do freely without you and what you do in the church you know what he did he went through the pews and cleaned the church after every service and he locked it up for me i told him 20 years ago i said i need somebody to lock up because i'm tired nobody else will lock up he says i'll do it for you for 20 some years he went through cleaned up the church afterwards and locked the door for 27 years i said brother you contributed to my ministry and when we receive rewards on the other side now i've got to go meet him he's already there i said you'll stand with me in the ministry he had this area wasn't is it just the preachers can you say man it's who made that ministry run smoother it's who help who's the helps who's the one that's saying we just want to see the glory of god come down amen so they found their place and they recognized what they were there for the biggest part of is they work together in this effort with one key that i want to talk about this morning and brother brahm talks about it quite often romans 12 paul talks about it i'll read the scripture first on it where he says paul romans 12 and verse 3 for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think himself of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly if you're thinking more highly of yourself than you ought to be thinking you're not thinking soberly as a christian think soberly according as god had dealt to every man in the measure of faith for as we have mercy have we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in christ and everyone remembers one of another having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith or ministry let us wait on our ministry or he that teacheth on teaching he that exhorted exhortation he that giveth let him do it with simplicity he that ruleth with diligence he that showeth mercy with cheerfulness let love be without hypocrisy dissimulation let your love be without hypocrisy let your love for one another be real i said let your love for wanting to be real not put on not fake not i've got to love you because you're sitting beside me let your love be real let it be purged of hypocrisy amen let your love be without dissimulation abhor that which is evil cleave to that which is good be kindly affection one to another with brotherly love in honor preferring one another starts the verses with humility let no man think the only way for gifts to work the only way for the church to work with god in charge is humility let no man think more highly of himself than he ought to think amen amen amen i might as well go ahead and say it that with this subject this morning i've been so disturbed lately i've been disturbed for years but so much lately that there are so many know-it-alls in the body of christ [Music] young couples tend to think they know it all about raising children you know how i know that because i was that way i was raised in a great family my dad and mom were the best families you could be raised in i'm proud of that so i guess that brought pride that i could raise kids found out a few late years later and finding out now listen there's there's no guarantee of this stuff it's trusting the lord there's no perfect parent can you say man but when we're young we don't need to ask the older ones because we know it all amen you can't tell young couples give them advice because you can't give anybody advice today because they already know everything they googled it they googled it and now they're a professor in every subject because they're on the internet every day praise hello brothers and sisters you can't get on me about this i'm on vacation they know everything already and then you get to 54 and as you get older you realize you really don't know anything i didn't know what i was doing and i made some damage to my kids i've had to make some of that right because i didn't paula fontaine i didn't do it all right i made some damaging things to them because you know why i did it because i thought i knew i was doing right right everybody's to know it all today everybody has a google knowledge and everybody's they've got it all they don't have to get a degree because they've read up enough up on the internet they're they're an expert on on the covet they're an expert on all the subjects am i supposed to be wearing a mask right now or am i okay i didn't even ask if that was the rule i'm hot enough please don't make me wear a mask i'll stay distant friends so don't spit on you out there hey i've already had the thing man i'm done with it been there done that got the t-shirt [Applause] yeah know it alls i got to get off this cause i got a lot here but listen listen we're missing humility in the body and when you've got the body with gifts working even gets working but you got that thing if everybody's thinking more highly of themselves than they ought to think they're the authority on the matter when there's no humility it's not going to work effective can't work together effectively with it an honor brother love preferring one another now when brother brahm talks about it in a little message called humble thyself which is just a little bit after the seals that he preached and incidentally he preached and humbled thyself he refers to the the third poll and refers to what it would begin to do and it's a it's just a little message what even a sermon he just got up and talked a little bit about humility after another minister spoke but it's powerful what he says i'm going to read a little bit from it and one of the spots in that message he says i was i was thinking here of that little illustration to back to what he said the other minister had mentioned now we look at this watch and find out what time it is unless that every instrument in that watch is coordinating one with the other will never know the correct time right is that right and that takes all of us together if we want to see the third pole really do something for god it's coordination with every one of us together to humble ourselves before god and confess our wrongs and pray and believe god for these things and you all been taught right you know the 1963 when the seals were open the third poll not the first and second but now we come into the phase of the third poll that thing was launched that thing began but it was only in its early stages of the opening of the word what it would do in the people was still to come and so now as i said he begins to talk about it and he's talking about humble thyself if we really want to see the third pole do something among us we work in coordination together amen like the watch and he elaborates on this it says every uh coordinating part inside has to be working so he points us to something to me it's very wonderful in this season of the third poll being opened up for those of you who don't know the the third poll is the three parts of the ministry of the last days three parts of jesus ministry you've been taught those that are here but if you're a visitor there were three main parts of jesus ministry the first poll the healings the second poll discerning the people's hearts like the woman at the well and the third poll when he began to open the word to his disciples we've had that same transition in the last days we come to the final part it's no public show but yet it's here the third pool is here it arrived at the opening of the word just like in nehemiah's day but you see now they come to the opening of the word but see now it's it arrived but we're looking for it to do something it points us to working together in humility confession prayer simple belief all the elements are there but the body must be working together the potentials of the third pole are not in a book or in a tape or in a church building or in the bible it's here it needs us working together to see it manifest more in our midst it is in the body now it's the holy spirit in us the body and it's important don't distance yourself away from the body of christ you know people are doing that at the worst time they could do it we're almost there people leaving this message now we're at the climax this is it man this is the wrap-up what are you doing if you're listening on the internet what are you doing wake up because this is the hour this is the time 50 60 years after this open word came to us and now this bride is coming to a place we're gonna see the final vindication of this thing hallelujah don't distance yourself away so when he refers to a watch then we realize that you know i read up a little bit on this there's a like a hundred in a swiss watch which is a pretty expensive watch there's about 130 to 150 moving and non-moving parts to a switch watch in a rolex watch which i don't know if anybody has one here today i certainly don't have one very expensive watch rolex one of my one of my friends has one and so that's why i stay his friend maybe he'll hand it down to me a rolex has a hundred and seventy now you imagine this little watch 175 to 200 working and non-working parts you wonder why brother branham referred to this because it's just this little thing and yet so many moving and unmoving parts in it and if they didn't work in coordination connected together we couldn't tell the time what a great what a great word picture the prophet gave us it's a little just a little just small can you say man just my wife bought me a watch here i don't know uh 20 years ago yes and it was a bolovin watch and it was it was 300 i thought it was the richest man in the world she bought me that watch i wanted a nice gold watch and a beautiful watch bolvin so i was down here one of my vacations and i was driving down uh in between west palm here in miami and there's this little watch place that had signs on the door i said you know what i'd like to upgrade to something different not i could bring this in and i could you know let me just say this before i tell this little story anybody ever walked into a place and you realize after a few minutes you didn't belong in there sister alan a few honest people you thought you were something and then you walked into this place and said you ain't nothing you ain't got squat i thought i was big time with a 300 watch and i said i'm gonna go in and they're gonna be so happy i'm gonna trade this thing and upgrade to something nicer and so i walked through the store i said that's nice that's i did notice the prices were a bit high but i had a 300 watch i had a good trade-in you know and so finally i guess says i got this watch if you want to look at it it's a boulevard she goes what is it oh my gosh what brand is that i said i'd like to trade it in and maybe get something nicer and i bought it for 300 you know 20 years ago and maybe i could do something and she said sir our our used watches traded our used watches start at fifteen thousand start praise the lord i said have a good day ma'am and i walk back [Applause] i was driving a rental car that was a convertible but it didn't do any good she didn't look at that at all but some of these expensive watches friends it's the unseen parts all of those parts besides the what's on the front the the what the the what do they call them though huh the hands every other part is invisible [Music] i'm telling you in a local body what happens behind the scenes and what happens in prayer [Applause] and the reason that our sister could come and sing this morning and be such a blessing be anointed in all this that wouldn't happen even unless some other parts have been taking place in praying and getting their hearts ready for that to take place it all works in coordination together and if the devil is setting you sitting there this morning that you're not apart the devil is talking to you and you need to quit having your wall up and you just say what can i do for the kingdom of god where is my place in his kingdom because there's no big eyes or little used there's no one with great positions can you say man you are important you are part of the body of christ and we can grow and we can see more lives changed we can see our numbers grow we can see all these things and the glory of god most of all coming down see when that happens friends if a visitor comes in that does all the explaining can you say man that's the thing that speaks to people that's the thing that'll make some people come back amen can you say praise the lord oh my working together in coordination and god he goes on to say god can only operate as we let him operate you know people want power and really they really don't know what power is they really don't know what goes with the power the way up is down always if you want power see how humble you can get just get away from your worldly thinking humble yourself before god and then you've got more power than the man that runs all over the building and makes a lot of big noise see because you've been able to conquer yourself and commit yourself to christ you see to humble yourself before him that's really power you show me a church that's humble real humble and not arrogant a church just sweet humble church i'll show you a church that has the favor and the power of god in it that's right that's the thing that takes humility humbling ourselves before god letting god just work through us don't have to make a lot of noise sometimes as the farmer said he went out to the field with his wagon and every time he hit a bump it rattled and went on but when he come back he hit the same bump and didn't make no noise at all because because it was loaded with good things so i think that's just about right that we get filled up with good things of god that the fruit of the spirit might be known through us as he referred so much to the first things have not charity it's nothing it profiteth me nothing and you've got to look this out and come sweet before the lord and i've always found that a man that humbles himself is the man that god exalts when you take a person with his chest out and knows everything and you can't tell him nothing amen and he is arrogant see you you're talking about people out there no no no i'm talking about in-message churches i've got some of them in my church you can't tell them nothing i don't even know why they come [Music] because they get their high taken off about every service and they keep coming they're not yielding they're not surrendering and you couldn't ever personally counsel them and correct them and exhort them as the bible said we should be able to do exhort one another is a slight rebuke but you don't dare do that today oh boy i'm on my subject i better watch what i'm saying [Applause] people need to read their bibles how the body works but we're still got our wall up we don't dare go and correct somebody today it's the culture that we live in let me be me and nobody says nothing to me that's not the body of christ you can say amen but just remember when somebody comes to you to say something to you that's when you feel it a little bit amen you know my wife always says this is submission and we're counseling sisters and couples and things and submission comes in actually when you disagree with what the head is going to do it's not really submission when you agree with it oh boy oh man i'll tell you there's a is that a back door right there so i can get out of here it's not a thank you for telling me it's a closet and i'd be caught in that closet people don't we're in a culture watch the young people coming up study the generations generation x generation y instead of the employers that are having trouble because you can't tell those employees nothing that does not work in the house of god we need submission pure submission the right kind we don't need dictatorship and we don't need rebellion we don't need the nicolaitan spirit and we don't need the jezebels did you notice both of those things are brought out in the church ages a nicolaitan spirit and a jezebel spirit the nicolaitan is when the the headship gets out of order and dictates to the people without the holy ghost the jezebel spirits he won't submit we want to purge that out of our midst no need to be that way can you say amen so this watch is what we're looking at and humble in ourselves and he says we must that's right every piece of this watch church must be together and you must keep your part of it so we see what time we're living in we may be closer than we think it's all about humility working in coordination together in true humility is the key i won't be much longer i want to jump to a part here in a minute so we must work together besides the world falling apart we have an enemy working overtime attacking the message attacking the people who believe it right making people think that it's these people that we withdraw from and not worldly people that's the message it's preachers and its people are the problem there the satan is making people's eyes that the message is the problem the people in the message are the problem you young people listen to me the voices of the enemy are on the internet every day to teach you that the real problem must be the message or the people of the message and i'm here to say that's the biggest one of the biggest lies satan can tell you god sent a message to a prophet and got people believing it i don't care if you think they're weak or whatever they are there's holy ghost filled people there and if you turn to chum and hang out with worldly people and hang out with everybody else and shun the real people of god you're going to pay for that amen amen you take some of our groups and some of the people you take us at our very worst i'd rather have my kids hanging around a church like this amen than some of the atmospheres out there amen amen you take the very worst of things that happen in the church things happen people in sin or people treat one another wrong people come up walk up and give you the elevator look looking you over that's right come on now looking at everything you're wearing judge you by that first it happens all the time can you say man but i'm telling the young people don't you let satan talk to you with that because you you might have the elevator look at walmart you might get more at walmart because of the way you look that's right a bunch of hypocrites at that message church message message messages and the devil gives the message a bad name a bunch of hypocrites there there's hypocrites at walmart amen you take the very worst i told parents i said our youth group we got a youth group for some 28 years we every friday night we met with youth me and my wife had them we want to give them a place to go shared the word with them we had a good time had some fun every friday night for some 20 years now some other brothers take care of it for me give the other youth a place to go they had a couple pairs say i don't know what your teachers are teaching and stuff like that and then let them go let them go be with a bunch of other youth groups i said i set this youth group above any of that i trusted above any of it as opposed to being out there take us at our very worst i still think it's a good atmosphere to have your family in i'm talking about working together [Applause] praise the lord humility says i'll go the way of the cross dying to myself for the sake of christ and for the sake of the whole body humility says i'm no better than anyone here humility says i put my prayers and my gifts in with the rest mine is no better i'm no better and if someone excels in their gift beyond me and god makes a gift more visible than mine then when i praise the lord for that and i pray for that that it will be excelled even more humility before god and one another is the true prerequisite to his glory coming down i believe that with all my heart it says in philippians 2 if there be any a consolation in christ if any comfort of love philippians 2 verse 1 if any comfort of love have any fellowship with the spirit if any bowels and mercies fulfill ye my joy that you may be like-minded having the same love being one of one accord one mind let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind that each esteem others better than themselves look not everyone on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in the fashion as a man he humbled himself christ humbled himself and we don't have to christ humbled himself not robbery to be equal with god and yet he humbled himself as a servant he made himself a note that's why you find jesus saying don't tell any man about this don't tell man you got healed don't tell them about that that doesn't sound like a lot of radio preachers they blasted around the world if they have a healing jesus said don't tell anybody about it why because jesus wasn't trying to do his marketing to build up his gift we got a great gift here we got to do some more marketing we got to get it built around the world that's not the body of christ just do what you do worship the lord serve the lord and he'll build it up the way that he wants to he'll fill these seats with people that are hungry he'll give you a new building just work together in communication and coordination and love among one another you watch something come out of that humble yourself can you say man he made himself of no reputation somebody's saying the other day you need to do this promotion you need to promote this you need to promote that i said no i want to be less known i don't want to be more known i want my name to be less known i just want to write my little songs and preach the gospel i don't need my name on any kind of lights i'm going jesus path here he intentionally made himself of no reputation amen amen praise the lord amen amen so many things christ humbled himself to the cross the way of the cross unselfishness it's all about others before himself you get that you understand that can you say amen i'm skipping away down here so i can find this spot that i want to close working together the priests the levites the porters the singers all through themselves into the temple threw themselves into it to see god's glory come down no one was more important than the other all were needed the nithinims methanes means the given ones methanes mean the given ones the nithinines were set up by david and ezra as if you want the reference as uh chapter 20 and verse 8 david set up the nithyanims as a position actually and they needed them around the temple they needed them around as helpers the levites they were service to the levites they were assisting the levites in their job that they did doing the in between stuff so the levites could do their job you got some brothers and sisters here this morning doing that the pastor can be gone and this thing's functioning and the holy spirit's coming down it's assisting this minister and his vision what he does god will bless you for that for years my wife and i we i don't know she's watching the grand baby now but my wife and i we did we were the janitor and we set up the chairs and we did it all and then we did the youth beings and we did this and that and just getting to the spot now that i have to work on letting stuff go and let other brothers and sisters just do it i have an assistant now it's just such a wonderful assistant pastor and just taking things off with me take i'm finally going to get to that place that i can just write songs and study for sermons and enjoy my granddaughter i'm almost there that's all i want to do friends i don't want to go around the world i don't want to preach conventions i just want to write songs preach anointed messages visit west palm a couple times a year maybe even get a home down here take that off of the internet you got to cut that part out get a home down here get a membership in this church [Applause] this church and spend time with my granddaughter you know how i'm getting to that place after 33 years pastoring you know i'm getting that place because god has supplied methanes helpers servants [Applause] hallelujah so when paul when paul gets into this i want you to turn here and well i promise we'll close on this first corinthians chapter 12. when paul gets into this subject of the body or in the subject of the holy ghost and how it's working through gifts because we know first corinthians he deals with the gifts talks a lot about it the diversities of gifts and so when he's talking about gifts and i imagine your pastor's taught on this uh on the gifts and your evening of tearing for the lord uh when he speaks about it then he goes into this word picture of a natural body okay he feels to use a word picture of the natural body and how that works together and how some points about the body picks it up in verse 12 where he says as the body is one and half many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is christ for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles whether we bond or free and have been all made to drink of one spirit for the body is one member but many excuse me the body is not one member but many if the foot shall say because i am not the hand i am not of the body is therefore not of the body if the ear shall say because i am not the eye i am not of the body is it therefore not of the body if the whole body were an eye where were the hearing if the whole body were hearing where were the smelling but now god hath set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him i like god god has said amen so my dad used to say he might even said it here in your church i don't know he says he says so you didn't put me in and you can't kick me out right god has set some members in the body and some of them you're wondering why did god set them in the body well that ain't none of your business amen i don't know why god set them in the body i never understand that maybe they thinking the same thing about you why'd god set you in this body and if the foot shall say excuse me if the whole but now god has set some members so you know you know these scriptures okay so here paul brings up the word picture of a body and that we should never be saying i have no need of you and the reason he's saying that the reason paul's preaching this about a body is because it's pretty stupid to think that one of your natural body members could say that it's almost it's impossible one of your natural bodies like your hand couldn't say to another i don't need you because we need everything here there's a couple parts they take out that you can get by without right right but most of it it needs the body can you say man and so this whole thing where is this whole idea i have no need of you it's stupid that the body could think that but if it's true of the natural body it has to be true of this body of christ you can never have the pride to say to anyone i have no need of you you actually should be saying in humility i have need of you i need you some people today they come to church and they don't need anybody at church they don't need anybody there they need to hear their sermon and go home i don't need it i just need my family my family my family well some of your family may fail you too someday i don't need anybody at that church i just need my family my mama my papa my uncle i just need that and you know people today are clinging to family even unsaved family they cling to them because it's emotional it's family but they won't give their heart to the church they won't give their heart to the body of christ i'm saying you're setting yourself up for failure there's nothing against family families family understand that but don't you ever set them above the body of christ you are royalty this is the family of god this is your true family amen is anybody getting something out of this this morning are you listening to do you trust me this will help you if you just believe me and trust me and believe it this will help this church it will help you individually to come out of your shell to come out of your walls you got up we tend to default to our family members and mommy and daddy in default because in this age we don't trust anybody we don't trust the church we don't protect the people at church so the family's only one we can really trust don't be so sure they could turn on you just like that but i'll love them anyway because they're family how come you don't do that with the body of christ amen so paul says this because what he's dealing with this is i have no need of you because some carnal person back then in the body of christ would actually say something like that or show the actions i have no need of you paul must be saying it for a reason it must been people had that attitude i don't need you i like paul's preaching i'll come to this message church but i don't need you i don't need you i only need me somebody must have been saying that i just want to come to a church i've had them say i just i've been through so much i just want to come to a church but i don't need anybody in that church i just want to come will you got me come by the paul and i usually say hey just come let the let the presence of the lord do something for you but i'm always thinking my mind how can you accept the lord and not accept where the lord's living right now your hurts and pains are so bad that you're blocking out one of the most important things that could be a benefit to your healing amen oh friends say i just want my healing from the lord while the lord is in the body two sundays ago a sister she had migraine headaches for about a week constant and in that same service that same communion service she said sister would you lay hands her sister lay hands on her she's never had a migraine since just the sister of the church don't even she didn't say her name she laid her hands on that sister migraines were gone amen so i'm making the point i'm making the point i need the lord but i don't need anybody the lord's in his people amen amen you know the reason that paul brought this up is because there's two complexes how many believe you need one another yes you do you may say you don't need anybody but you need the body of christ you'd be best to form your friendships more out of the body of christ anywhere [Music] else you know anybody got been married a long time and you realize you start to need one another more and more 54 years old you finish each other's sentences your mind goes and you don't have a clue what to finish the sentence and your wife finishes it for you sometimes we don't want to admit it but we need each other we were in georgia for a convention daniel gisenander's last september we got this motel we're getting ready for church we come in early getting ready for church there's two motels beside one another and i i was in room we were in the room 340. we got set up in the room i wanted to study she wants to get something to eat across the street and she's going to bring it back to her she brings it back but she she comes back and she calls me from room 340 she says where are you at i'm in the room i said no hon i'm in the room i'm in 3 40. she says no you're not i'm in 3 40. i said huh i can tell you right now i'm looking at the phone and the door and it says 340. the same room we checked in in with my luggage in front of me and she starts to look around this room it's 3 40 but there ain't no luggage in it and she had walked to the right [Laughter] i'm glad she's in the nursery right now she had walked from that restaurant not even it went into the other motel walked upstairs and that room happened to be open walked into 340 in the other motel completely and that's why i said honey you need me don't you you're getting the place of life you need me in life it's not just that i need you you need me honey sweetie pie we're getting the place we need each other you'd be lost without me over there in that motel i said bring me my food over here i'm over here in 3 40. amen get rid of these lines that we don't need the body of christ we don't need that person in the body of christ if they're in the body you need them every joint supplieth to one another it increases to the edification of the church the reason that paul talked about this is because there's two main complexes in people and if i had another knight i would talk about complexes complexes that's what happens to you is your complexes and paul is addressing deep hindrances in the church and there's two main things there's a group that might say that in complexes now i'm i'm not happy with me i want to be you that's one complex that's an inferiority complex i'm not happy with how god made me so i want to be you that's why paul says the foot can't say to the hand i don't want to be the foot i want to be the hand that's an inferiority complex you're not happy with what god gave you to do and how he made you that's an inferiority coming complexes don't worry at work in the body of christ but there's another one that paul mentions not an inferiority complex but the second one that says i'm perfectly happy with me and i don't need you amen if the foot shall save the hand i have no need of you so one of them is an inferiority complex the next one is a superiority complex and they're both just as bad one says i'm totally happy with myself i don't need nobody i don't need anybody in my life especially the body of christ and the other one says i'm not happy with myself never been happy with myself i want to be everybody else i don't want to be a lay member i want to be the preacher i want to be the deacon why can't i sing a special you better pray and find your place you want to get up and sing every service and the lord may have you back there cleaning them toilets i pray that he doesn't have you doing that but you've got to find out what god wants you to do [Music] amen praise the lord amen i did a study on this one time in complexes and i feel like that's what paul was talking about the superiority complex that says i am completely content with myself and i don't need anybody else and inferior says i'm not content with myself i'm not settled with myself and i want to be someone else that's where you get the social media girls and guys copying what everybody else is doing dressing superstars sports stars you haven't found your place in christ yet because you've got to be everybody else except what god made you it's time to grow up in the lord and find your place this is who i am this is what i do this is my walk with christ i am confident in this it's what god gave me to do and once you get that confidence you place that in the body say use me lord can you say man you get in there you say lord if you can use anything lord you can use me [Laughter] if you can use anything law you can use me take my hands lord and my feet touch my heart lord speak to me if you can use anything lord you can [Music] that was the cue for the piano player to come and the musicians if you don't come i'll keep preaching if you can use anything law you can use me to stand together oh if you can use anything law you can use me take my hands low and my feet touch my heart lord speak through me

god and they cleave to one another lord create such an atmosphere lord that those would come in their midst be come unto the power of god lord they would just crumble in conviction in your atmosphere
