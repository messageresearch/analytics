[6:20] [Music]
[6:27] a man says o give thanks unto the lord

[7:02] the judgments of his mouth a man though
[7:06] he seed of Abraham is servant you

[7:11] some so I just reflect on that the
[7:14] little thought there that David gives us
[7:16] this just talk give all his wondrous
[7:18] works man believe that when we talk
[7:20] about what God has done and what God
[7:24] will do what God is doing it kind of
[7:28] makes them want to do a little bit more
[7:31] you know I know that as a as a father
[7:34] when kids you know say good things about
[7:37] what daddy did that it did that daddy
[7:39] actually want to do a little bit more so
[7:41] I believe as we just talk and we just
[7:43] think about you know some of the great
[7:45] things that he's done for us and
[7:47] especially this year we can look forward
[7:50] to having a lot more on amen of the

[27:43] weren't planning on it but I guess God
[27:46] put it on for the Quinton's hard to tell

[31:59] hey man we certainly appreciate that
[32:03] tonight
[32:08] I'm glad brother Quentin told on the
[32:10] Saints a man that's that was a real
[32:14] blessing you know just it always means
[32:18] something amen
[32:20] you know every coming from the states
[32:22] and going going anywhere in Africa you
[32:28] know we just we just identified just on
[32:32] a different level right and and I
[32:35] remember the first time I went to
[32:36] Zimbabwe I told her brothers I said man
[32:42] we finally made it back with me and the
[32:45] brothers say well brother way there was
[32:46] never any slavery here in jean-bob
[32:47] whereas it may say well okay we have to
[32:52] find somewhere but it was just touching
[32:54] the soil and a man in Africa just meant
[32:56] so much to us and we thank God for
[32:58] things so good to have a man you thanks
[33:01] with us and just fellowshipping and
[33:03] thank you for for just blessing us they
[33:05] met with that on tonight a man now we
[33:08] know the job do that every time you come
[33:10] we'll be expecting a little something
[33:13] something something in Shona hey man hey
[33:17] man hey man praise the Lord thank y'all
[33:19] I appreciate y'all I'll let you all be
[33:21] seated
[33:23] I want to read actually just a scripture
[33:29] here from Luke 17 I read here from Psalm
[33:38] 105 words that make known as deeds among
[33:40] all men and and tonight I just kind of
[33:44] had in my spirit just to come in off of
[33:48] the Lord some things a man he is worthy
[33:52] of the praise and it's been so good
[33:56] and I just felt there would be robbery
[34:00] if we just didn't stop and just take a
[34:02] moment just to thank him for some of the
[34:05] things that he has done the metaphors
[34:08] here in Luke 17 and you all would
[34:11] stand with me amen I'll start reading at
[34:13] verse 11 a man is that right yes Luke 17
[34:19] and verse 11 says and it came to pass as
[34:22] he went to Jerusalem that he passed
[34:25] through the midst of Samaria and Galilee
[34:29] and as he entered into a certain village
[34:32] there met him ten men that were lepers
[34:34] which stood afar off and they lifted up
[34:38] their voices and said Jesus master have
[34:42] mercy on us and when he saw them he said
[34:46] unto them go show yourselves into the
[34:48] priests and it came to pass that as they
[34:51] went they were cleansed and one of them
[34:54] when he saw that he was healed turned
[34:57] back and with a loud voice glorified God
[35:02] a man and fell down on his face at his
[35:05] feet giving him thanks and he was a
[35:08] Samaritan and Jesus answering said where
[35:12] there not ten cleansed where are the
[35:16] nine they are not found that returned to
[35:20] give glory to God save this stranger and
[35:24] they said unto Him arise go thy way thy
[35:27] faith have made the whole man thank God
[35:31] for the reading of his word let's just
[35:33] pray father we thank you for the reading
[35:37] of Scripture and as this this little
[35:40] story or a parable that you give us of
[35:43] this the ten lepers and God just how
[35:47] they responded they realize that you
[35:50] were the one able to do this you could
[35:53] cleanse them from their leprosy and
[35:56] brother Branham even tells us that
[35:58] because they had confidence in you
[36:00] because they cared enough to come to you
[36:03] you cared enough to do something about
[36:05] their situation the unfortunate part
[36:07] here is that only one returned to give
[36:10] you thanks and tonight Lord we want to
[36:11] just stop and take some time just to
[36:14] offer our thanks for how good you have
[36:17] been to us God we we we could never
[36:22] repay you for
[36:24] goodness that you have given in the
[36:26] blessings that you have bestowed and as
[36:28] a psalm was just saying showers of
[36:32] blessings showers God that's that's
[36:36] that's kind of what we've been seeing
[36:38] here and just in the weather just
[36:41] showers a little bit come and then it
[36:43] stops and then a little bit more come
[36:45] and then it stops and then a little bit
[36:47] more coming then it stops it a little
[36:48] bit more come and father that's what
[36:51] you've done to us spiritually so father
[36:53] how we just want to express our
[36:55] appreciation we want to express our love
[36:57] won't express our gratitude here in this
[37:00] place tonight
[37:01] we give you the glory the honor and the
[37:03] praise in Jesus name Amen amen god bless
[37:07] you can be seated I don't necessarily
[37:11] have a title for this sermon tonight but
[37:15] it's just more of you know a opportunity
[37:19] to just express to God amen thank you I
[37:22] just went back to that that scripture in
[37:25] Luke 17 and you know brother Branham
[37:28] made the comment about it that you know
[37:30] these these guys cared enough to believe
[37:32] that Jesus could do something about this
[37:34] situation and Jesus cared enough to
[37:35] actually do something about it and I
[37:38] believe he's proving that to us
[37:40] throughout this year you know things
[37:43] that we've carried to the Lord in prayer
[37:44] he's cared enough about us to actually
[37:47] do something about it a man and and and
[37:50] and the least that we can come back to
[37:52] do on this night is just tell the Lord
[37:54] thank you right God God we appreciate
[37:57] all that you have done and all that you
[38:00] will do we appreciate that but you know
[38:03] as we started the year off a man I just
[38:07] went back to to the beginning of the
[38:10] year and the very first sermon Lord gave
[38:12] us this year was the year of the
[38:14] incredible so I'm just you put them some
[38:18] closing comments a man on an incredible
[38:20] year a man that's all I'm making tonight
[38:23] is just some closing comments on an
[38:26] incredible year glory to God amen
[38:31] there's a scripture in Matthew 17
[38:35] because this
[38:36] is one of the scriptures that we read
[38:39] when we started the year with talking
[38:44] about this is a this is a year than
[38:46] credibly declared it by faith and God
[38:48] certainly met that expectation he
[38:51] actually exceeded it but here Matthew 17
[38:54] verse 14 through 21 says and when they
[38:59] were come to the multitude there came to
[39:01] him a certain man kneeling down to him
[39:04] and saying lord have mercy on my son for
[39:07] he is lunatic and sore vex for all times
[39:14] he falleth into the fire and oft into
[39:16] the water and I brought him to thy
[39:19] disciples and they could not cure him
[39:21] all right so this man is bringing them
[39:24] to people that are fellowship with the
[39:26] Lord Jesus they're hanging with Jesus
[39:28] and this man's got confidence that if
[39:30] these guys are as close to Jesus as they
[39:33] are they should be able to do something
[39:34] about this they should be able to get
[39:36] this situation resolved right and this
[39:39] man had confidence and the disciples but
[39:41] here we see something he really makes a
[39:46] statement he says they could not cure
[39:48] him they tried they tried I'll read it
[39:51] quote here in a second
[39:52] brother branham you know was saying how
[39:53] what the disciples were doing is really
[39:55] their approach to it well the way that
[39:58] they were approaches like let me show
[39:59] you how I did it
[40:00] let me show you how I did it let me show
[40:02] you it was more of a competition Oh
[40:05] glory to God amen and I want to tell you
[40:08] when we're dealing with the supernatural
[40:10] things of God it cannot be a competition
[40:14] hallelujah amen what what it has to be
[40:17] you know everything that when we talk
[40:19] about spoken word Authority amen
[40:23] that cannot be based on competition why
[40:27] do you want to speak that why do you
[40:30] need that what what's the purpose of
[40:33] that right you know brother Branham
[40:34] tells us that is based on motive and
[40:36] objective a man so if our motive and
[40:40] objective is not right then we won't get
[40:42] the results that we're looking for but
[40:44] he
[40:44] the disciples didn't really have the
[40:46] right motives they were actually
[40:48] competing with one another they knew
[40:50] they had the authority because Jesus
[40:52] gave them the authority and the power to
[40:55] cast out Devils but when it came to this
[40:57] case they fail hallelujah glory to God
[41:00] so so the problem is a man's the way
[41:03] that they were approaching this now
[41:05] let's look at this a Manticore little
[41:06] further
[41:07] verse 17 the man's bringing this case to
[41:09] Jesus say Jesus answer said o faithless
[41:12] and perverse generation how long shall I
[41:15] be with you how long shall I suffer you
[41:18] bring him hither to me and and I love
[41:22] this there's a confidence that Jesus has
[41:25] there is a a man he has complete control
[41:30] over the situation he's actually showing
[41:32] that there's nothing too hard hallelujah
[41:35] amen I don't care what you facing bring
[41:38] it to me bring it to the Lord Jesus amen
[41:42] he can take care of it Oh glory to God
[41:45] we brought many things to the Lord Jesus
[41:47] this year and he's taking care of many
[41:49] things God we couldn't do nothing with
[41:52] it but God did Oh hallelujah
[41:55] bring it to me bring it to me whatever
[41:57] it is that's what he says bring it to me
[42:00] Oh glory glory glory glory it says in
[42:04] the bottle saying Jesus rebuked the
[42:06] devil Jesus rebuked the devil and he
[42:10] departed out of him and the child was
[42:12] cured from that very hour praise God
[42:17] verse verse 19 says then came two
[42:20] disciples to Jesus apart and said why
[42:22] could not we cast him out and even Jesus
[42:26] and we handled he handled it privately
[42:28] with them he didn't you know just
[42:29] rebuked him openly but he just he
[42:31] handled them privately he just told him
[42:33] why they couldn't get this done he said
[42:34] jesus said unto them because of your
[42:36] unbelief for verily I said to you if you
[42:40] have faith as a grain of a mustard seed
[42:43] ye shall say unto this mountain remove
[42:46] hence to yonder place and it shall
[42:49] remove and nothing shall be impossible
[42:54] unto you what a statement right because
[42:59] we all realize there's nothing
[43:00] impossible with God but now he reverses
[43:04] this and says nothing will be impossible
[43:06] unto you and the only thing you need a
[43:10] man to overcome the impossible is faith
[43:14] the size of a mustard seed Oh glory now
[43:20] you know I I don't know how many of you
[43:22] all still have your mustard seed in your
[43:25] Bible it should be laying right there on
[43:28] that scripture and as I open up my Bible
[43:30] tonight one of my mussel seeds fell out
[43:32] all right I said I'll put it right back
[43:34] in there you'll already got because I'm
[43:36] believing God I'm gonna have faith the
[43:38] size of a mustard seed and what must
[43:40] that see faith is it's pure
[43:42] unadulterated faith right it's faith
[43:44] that cannot be mixed with anything else
[43:46] faith that will not mix with anything
[43:49] else right it's not sometimes faith
[43:51] sometimes doubt it's faith all the time
[43:54] glory to God it's faith in this year
[43:57] it's faith that's going into the next
[43:59] year
[43:59] and if the Lord Terry will have faith
[44:01] the next year glory to God your faith
[44:03] remains the same all the time no matter
[44:05] what you're facing no matter what you're
[44:07] going through it you must maintain that
[44:10] same level of faith Oh hallelujah
[44:14] it made me sense he says remove heads to
[44:18] yonder place in the shell removing
[44:19] nothing shall be impossible
[44:21] unto you howbeit this kind goeth not out
[44:24] but by prayer and fasting now just a
[44:29] little quote here this is going to come
[44:32] from the message Jesus Christ the same
[44:34] yesterday a man today and forever and
[44:37] the date I'm giving you 61 - 0 5 1 6 a
[44:42] and the paragraph number is going to be
[44:45] e - 30
[44:46] praise the Lord says when the disciples
[44:49] was given power to heal the sick 10 days
[44:52] later we found them defeated on an
[44:55] epileptic case and I'd imagine Peter
[44:58] saying wait I'll show you how I
[45:01] down at Capernaum and the other ones
[45:03] saying I'll show you how I did it
[45:06] and none of them can make this demon
[45:08] leave the child but when Jesus came and
[45:11] the father went to see Jesus and he said
[45:15] I brought him to your disciples and they
[45:18] could do nothing for him and I brought
[45:20] him to you he said I can if you believe
[45:25] for all things are possible to them that
[45:28] believe
[45:29] and the child he's going to refer to
[45:31] another scripture he says and the child
[45:33] went into the hardest fit ever had oh my
[45:38] that means it seemed like it got worse
[45:40] before it got better a man some of you
[45:42] all the faced situations where it seemed
[45:44] like it got worse before it got better
[45:46] holiday that is just a devil trying to
[45:48] knock you off of the promise hallelujah
[45:51] amen you still must maintain faith in
[45:53] the myths when it looked like he got
[45:55] worse I smoked it and it got worse I did
[45:58] this and it got worse but always
[46:00] understand it gets worse before it gets
[46:03] better
[46:04] hallelujah it will get better if you
[46:07] would only believe hallelujah amen I
[46:10] want to encourage you if there are some
[46:12] things that you were looking for God to
[46:14] do this year amen and you have not yet
[46:16] received or remember we still in the
[46:18] fourth quarter
[46:19] Amen we still in the fourth quarter God
[46:21] can still do it
[46:22] amen this year but if it does not happen
[46:25] carry the promise over into the next
[46:29] year because God is going to bring it to
[46:31] pass hallelujah it may get worse but it
[46:35] will get better thank you Jesus hey man
[46:39] listen he go he going says this in the
[46:41] quote he says it says if you can if you
[46:45] believe for all things are possible in
[46:46] that belief and the child went into the
[46:48] hardest fitted ever hand because the
[46:51] devil knew that he meant faith on a
[46:53] different level now we saw that was the
[46:56] first quote God gave us this year that
[46:58] the devil knew he meant faith on a
[47:01] different level glory to God then then
[47:04] what the Apostle says and I just believe
[47:06] that God is an order
[47:08] a man in the sold a different level
[47:10] glory glory glory amen III believe my
[47:15] face is on a different level than it was
[47:17] before and I'm without--without when I
[47:19] find myself doing is reminding myself of
[47:22] what God has already done hallelujah if
[47:25] he's done it before I know you'll do it
[47:26] again and there is nothing impossible to
[47:29] God nothing impossible Oh hallelujah he
[47:33] says he faints on a different level than
[47:37] what the apostles had he met a perfect
[47:40] faith and that's what we must have
[47:43] perfect faith to make the perfect Word
[47:46] of God
[47:46] perform perfectly amen perfect faith to
[47:52] make the perfect Word of God
[47:54] perform perfectly that's it we must
[47:57] believe it without a shadow of doubt see
[48:02] that's that's what that's what must have
[48:04] see faith is it's faith that will not
[48:07] allow doubt to get in God wants us to
[48:11] have that type of faith you know it's
[48:13] going to take this type of faith for us
[48:14] to make a rapture it's going to take a
[48:17] perfect faith for us to make a rapture
[48:19] and I believe the Lord allowed certain
[48:20] things just to challenge our faith to
[48:22] raise us to that next level
[48:24] amen in him and and and I thank God that
[48:27] you know we have it we've elevated we've
[48:29] elevated in our faith I know the devil
[48:31] try said now you doubted here you
[48:33] doubted that but no I did believe here
[48:35] amen and I got what I believe for praise
[48:39] God and and some must believe through
[48:42] some some some tumultuous situations
[48:45] Amen but he made away he made away a man
[48:51] God made away and I'm gonna just remind
[48:53] us of a little bit of some of the things
[48:55] that the Lord did this year
[48:56] Oh glory glory glory glory I just came
[49:00] to worship him that's all a man and now
[49:03] here's the thing and and I want to go to
[49:07] this this statement I've been I shared
[49:10] this this is gonna come out of Jehova of
[49:12] miracles jehovah of miracles the the
[49:16] date on this is 59 - 11 26 and the
[49:21] numbers II - 28 I made reference of this
[49:24] a man while we were at pinnacle Palms
[49:26] just on Sunday and you know coming
[49:29] through the Christmas season last year
[49:31] and the Lord just kind of given us this
[49:33] sermon amen oh nothing is impossible
[49:36] nothing is impossible and we looked at
[49:39] Mary and you know just just when you
[49:40] think about her being able to give birth
[49:43] to a baby and not being touched by a man
[49:45] if there was anything that was
[49:47] impossible that should have been it that
[49:49] should have been it right there but what
[49:51] we find the scriptures that Mary gave
[49:53] birth to Christ right and she got
[49:56] pregnant just through the spoken word
[49:59] hallelujah
[50:00] not not not not and it was there was a
[50:03] couple of things this and that we got
[50:05] we're gonna look at here in this quote
[50:06] but she got pregnant because she was
[50:09] able to receive the word right and
[50:12] brother Branham said that she she didn't
[50:14] she didn't she didn't doubt at all
[50:15] there's one one place she didn't argue
[50:18] with the angel right no no no fussing
[50:24] and fighting with the angel you know she
[50:25] said how could these things be that was
[50:27] a first question because I ain't never
[50:28] heard of that like this but how could
[50:30] these things be he say the Holy Spirit
[50:32] will overshadow you and you have the
[50:34] child and and in-residence say now you
[50:36] know that ain't never happened before
[50:37] that's not that's not Mary's response
[50:40] that's that's not the way she talking to
[50:42] the angel and I'm not come on now
[50:44] you're gonna make me come on you want me
[50:46] to go tell somebody that that's not how
[50:48] she responded she said be it unto me
[50:51] according to thy word and because she
[50:55] was able to receive the word she could
[50:58] receive the manifestation and to make if
[51:01] you are able to receive
[51:03] work then you can receive your
[51:06] manifestation hallelujah we don't need
[51:11] nothing else but the word even if it
[51:14] goes against what the doctor says as
[51:16] long as I got God's Word I am standing
[51:19] on something solid hallelujah glory to
[51:25] God we don't have the weight to it feel
[51:27] nothing we don't have to wait till we
[51:29] see nothing we got the Word of God we
[51:31] could move out with that hallelujah
[51:34] this this is what Mary this is how Mary
[51:37] actually a man was able to produce
[51:39] Christ it's because she was able to
[51:42] receive the words glory to God she was
[51:44] able to receive the word now look at
[51:46] this in jehovah miracles the Prophet
[51:49] says now the angel Gabriel six months
[51:51] later had visited Mary and told her that
[51:54] her cousin was going to have a baby also
[51:56] so Mary knew that that would be a
[51:59] miracle
[52:00] of that old woman well stricken in age
[52:04] having a baby but she said to the angel
[52:06] how shall it be with me seeing that I do
[52:09] not know a man and ask and you shall
[52:13] receive since he said the Holy Ghost is
[52:16] going to overshadow you that holy thing
[52:19] which shall be born of you shall be
[52:21] called the Son of God that's how it's
[52:23] going to happen Mary never talked back
[52:27] to the angel I like that don't question
[52:31] God Mary never talked back to the angel
[52:36] she never discussed it in any way and
[52:39] then the only thing she said was Behold
[52:43] the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me
[52:46] according to thy word did you think even
[52:50] that even the priests acker ayats that
[52:53] question him being an old man and her
[52:56] old - well no this is Zechariah and
[52:59] Elizabeth went when the angel came to
[53:00] Zechariah he's wondering about you know
[53:03] I'm old she old this they never happened
[53:05] he got out now he's a priest
[53:07] he should be believing but you know and
[53:10] and here he's a teacher of these things
[53:12] but but now he's there
[53:13] but Mara never doubted and you know
[53:16] because Zacharias doubted he lost his
[53:20] ability to be able to speak ain't that
[53:23] something I want you to think about that
[53:28] tonight
[53:28] because he doubt it he lost his ability
[53:32] to be able to speak hallelujah amen so
[53:37] so if we're gonna have faith then it
[53:40] should release something out of our
[53:42] mouth hallelujah
[53:45] but if you doubt you may lose your
[53:47] ability to speech Oh hallelujah
[53:52] God could of God get a lot in the loses
[53:54] ability with with walking them and maybe
[53:57] something else but God said no you're
[53:58] not gonna be able to speak that's how
[54:01] important it is for us to only say what
[54:04] God says man you just got visited by an
[54:08] angel angel told you this this was not
[54:14] another man speaking this but an angel
[54:17] came to you and said this and you got
[54:19] out what the angel say don't you fuss
[54:21] with the angel honey
[54:24] Oh glory to God
[54:27] don't argue with an angel now I can say
[54:30] something there but I don't want to
[54:31] throw you Oh hallelujah amen do you know
[54:37] something when the word is coming forth
[54:39] to you a man JEP I'm innocent
[54:41] that's an angel the Lord coming to you
[54:43] speaking to you but sometimes we just
[54:45] get caught up in the flesh the veil if I
[54:49] can put it that way we get so messed up
[54:51] with the veil that we can't see or hear
[54:53] God be careful don't argue with the
[54:56] angel you might lose your ability to
[54:59] speak all right let's go a little
[55:04] further he says so did you think even
[55:08] the priest Sakurai's that question him
[55:10] being an old man and her old to how this
[55:14] would be done and a pre-suit should know
[55:16] the word and know what God did but this
[55:20] little virgin was just a child and she
[55:22] had no husband
[55:24] had to believe the Impossibles something
[55:29] that had never happened before but she
[55:33] never argued she never questioned
[55:36] anymore his word was enough for her I
[55:39] got a question is the word enough for
[55:42] you tonight if God just give you a
[55:45] promise out of his word is that enough
[55:47] to keep you know I when I read this a
[55:53] man you know well when I preached this
[55:57] early in a year we struck that point and
[56:00] just you know the word being enough
[56:01] there were it be enough and and God had
[56:03] given me a scripture a man out of I
[56:06] might as well read it I'll read it again
[56:09] because I want the devil to know that
[56:11] this is enough for me
[56:13] jeremiah 32:40 one man I need that's all
[56:20] I need is what God said is where
[56:21] sometimes when you're reading the Bible
[56:23] what happens that the Lord just it's
[56:26] like the scripture just get anointed and
[56:29] it just rise up out of the pages of the
[56:32] Bible in and just begins to speak to
[56:34] your situation right where you are
[56:36] hallelujah that happened with brother
[56:38] Simba when he ran across that 320 a man
[56:43] Ephesians 3:20 it just rose up and and
[56:47] just spoke right to the situation so
[56:49] this this is something that the Lord
[56:51] gave us and and you know God has done so
[56:53] much and and God knows that I'm
[56:55] I still got my faith on the lie for a
[56:57] little bit more hey man I you know and
[57:01] they could happen it could happen this
[57:02] year if not I'm still I'm going to carry
[57:05] it over a man I'm care I'm gonna carry
[57:08] it over glory to God amen
[57:11] but this is what the Lord that was spoke
[57:13] to me and and and and this is concerning
[57:16] a man the church and the school that we
[57:18] looking forward to a man III wrote by
[57:23] the other day I show brother deny where
[57:27] it was he like this is yet brother yeah
[57:30] yeah everybody see it as an agreement
[57:35] everybody's in agreement and you know we
[57:37] just we just waiting on the Lord we
[57:39] won't get ahead of him we won't get in
[57:41] front of him we can't make nothing
[57:42] happen but but we can have faith and
[57:44] just believe right he could turn hearts
[57:47] and do whatever whatever needs to happen
[57:49] God can do it but God gave me the
[57:53] scripture and it says yay I will rejoice
[57:55] over them to do them good and I will
[57:59] plant them in this land assuredly with
[58:02] my whole heart and with my whole soul
[58:04] and I'm believing God that Scripture is
[58:07] gonna take us to a church named man and
[58:10] I'm gonna keep believing for that church
[58:12] until God say no on that church
[58:14] hallelujah that's what my faith that
[58:16] right and and I'm just gonna stand on
[58:18] this word just like Mary stood on her
[58:20] promise we're gonna stand on our promise
[58:22] Oh hallelujah you know he's done too
[58:25] much to me to doubt he done too much to
[58:28] me to actually consider other things
[58:30] somebody ain't even actually why don't
[58:32] you look at it others no not I ain't
[58:34] giving up on that until God say so and I
[58:38] know when God say so when somebody else
[58:40] by I know I know it went mine
[58:43] praise God and then I know this much to
[58:45] somebody else by then God got something
[58:47] much better for me but long as that's
[58:49] there I'm gonna keep believing God for
[58:50] it glory to God oh Jesus we we start
[58:56] testifying at the beginning a year we
[58:58] start praying over it faster no we've
[59:01] been we've been doing a lot you know
[59:03] concerning it and we just we just commit
[59:05] it to the hands of the Lord he knows how
[59:07] to take care of things in his time but
[59:11] my face is still on the line I'm still
[59:13] standing on that Satan praise God hey
[59:16] man I just wanted him to know that all
[59:18] right let me let me go on a little
[59:20] further here Mary all she had was was
[59:23] the Word of God and she had the the
[59:26] brother branham said she had to believe
[59:28] the impossible this was a man how can a
[59:31] virgin conceived she had to stand there
[59:33] and believe for the impossible she had
[59:36] nobody else that she could actually look
[59:39] to and say this happened to them this
[59:41] this happened to this person she was the
[59:43] first person not only at first but the
[59:45] only person
[59:46] this would ever happen to my god she had
[59:49] to stand on her conviction and tonight I
[59:52] want to tell you you gonna have to do
[59:53] the same thing sometimes when God speaks
[59:55] to you
[59:55] stand on your conviction it may not
[59:58] happen to your brother your sister but
[1:00:00] you have to stand on what God has done
[1:00:02] or what God has spoke to you praise God
[1:00:06] it may seem impossible amen but God's
[1:00:09] gonna do something incredible all right
[1:00:12] let's read this last quote on that go to
[1:00:16] paragraph ether T in the same message
[1:00:18] just go to paragraph ether t says you
[1:00:22] got thousands of examples of divine
[1:00:25] healing look at the people's been healed
[1:00:27] with cancer blindness dumbness deafness
[1:00:32] all kinds of sickness and diseases we've
[1:00:35] got plenty of that to look at as example
[1:00:39] but this little girl didn't have nothing
[1:00:41] but justice words amen
[1:00:44] justice word and that was sufficient his
[1:00:49] word was good enough for her
[1:00:52] and I want you to notice she didn't wait
[1:00:54] till she was positive amen it was going
[1:00:57] to happen
[1:00:58] she started testifying about it right
[1:01:01] away she being wait till she's felt life
[1:01:04] so she could be positive she was going

[1:09:43] watch God do restoration and AM Church
[1:09:49] growth and you know when I saw
[1:09:51] restoration one of the things that uh
[1:09:52] that I went back at this listen to that
[1:09:54] sermon on your incredible at the very
[1:09:57] end of the sermon sister Marva came up
[1:09:59] and gave a testimony and in her
[1:10:02] testimony she began to express how the
[1:10:05] Lord just gave her a vision coming to
[1:10:08] some gathering where most of my family
[1:10:10] was and she saw my daughter at the
[1:10:13] gathering and and it was just an
[1:10:15] opportunity for her to go and just sow a
[1:10:17] seed you know if my daughter just
[1:10:20] encourage you come on back to the house
[1:10:22] of the Lord and God opened up that door
[1:10:24] so and the way that God opened up the
[1:10:26] door he calls to
[1:10:28] have trouble with her car now we don't
[1:10:31] see this is way we got to understand
[1:10:33] this every time you have a problem
[1:10:38] doesn't really mean that it's a problem
[1:10:41] but there's something could be masked
[1:10:43] behind that oh my got to get this now
[1:10:47] because it'll change the way that you
[1:10:49] look at your issues you know they won't
[1:10:52] become issues all the time
[1:10:53] hallelujah but it's like okay God why'd
[1:10:56] you stop me here what I mean a sister
[1:10:58] about having a problem in the car she
[1:11:00] couldn't go home she had to wait for us
[1:11:01] to carry at home and and the care at
[1:11:04] home she had to come to the house
[1:11:05] God just orchestrated so many things to
[1:11:08] put her in position to speak that word
[1:11:10] now for me to see that manifests
[1:11:15] I got complete confidence that God gonna
[1:11:17] do the rest of this I say he ain't done
[1:11:22] yet
[1:11:24] he ain't done yet I and just with the
[1:11:28] restoration that I did see my faith has
[1:11:30] been elevated I'm believing God for more
[1:11:35] oh Jesus restoration Church growth what
[1:11:45] about healings that God did this year
[1:11:49] you know just you know we just heard
[1:11:52] from brother brother Joe underlined they

[1:12:08] and they get me to have their first baby
[1:12:10] and 2020 that that's a miracle that took
[1:12:15] place here I remember also during those

[1:12:22] testified how God touched her body and
[1:12:24] heal her you know of a condition that
[1:12:27] she was going through there with her

[1:13:00] you don't like that testimony so he want
[1:13:02] to keep attacking Isis but Satan you are
[1:13:04] like we are claiming her complete and
[1:13:08] total healing we claiming that in Jesus

[1:13:18] hallelujah this year brought some trials
[1:13:31] one of our sisters lost both her father
[1:13:33] and her mother this year but the
[1:13:37] testimony that goes with her mother it's
[1:13:39] something that we were not allowed a
[1:13:41] devil to take from us a mother was in
[1:13:46] the hospital and had already code it
[1:13:50] doctor said that's it she's coated
[1:13:52] nurses worked on it for a little bit and
[1:13:56] they were able to get a restored when he
[1:13:59] got a restored they called and start
[1:14:02] telling us you know what was going on
[1:14:03] and we went to visit at the hospital and
[1:14:05] and one of the one of her sisters was
[1:14:09] telling us about a an experience that
[1:14:12] her young daughter had there at the
[1:14:13] house and she was saying that you know
[1:14:16] she said we were at home you know at
[1:14:18] mama said mama said us I see this this
[1:14:21] young lady that's here in our house and
[1:14:24] she she wants to come upstairs
[1:14:27] but she's afraid and she just stand
[1:14:30] downstairs she just stand out says she
[1:14:32] wants to come up here but I'm looking at
[1:14:33] her mama she's a young lady and she
[1:14:35] wants to come up but she's just afraid
[1:14:37] so she stand down so when I went to the
[1:14:40] hospital and I heard them talking about
[1:14:42] this you know being message believers
[1:14:45] our prophet share so much with us that
[1:14:47] you know we hear things that other
[1:14:49] people don't hear because we know that
[1:14:51] the Prophet told us that we go back to
[1:14:53] being a young person when we go to the
[1:14:54] other side
[1:14:55] know that right so here this lady that's
[1:14:57] generally descendants and about four
[1:14:59] years old what what what would a four
[1:15:01] year old what what what would they gain
[1:15:04] by sharing an experience like this very
[1:15:07] innocent heart that God uses so I say I
[1:15:10] say oh she wanted to go upstairs but she
[1:15:13] was afraid and so she stands downstairs
[1:15:18] I said oh she's not ready to go meet God
[1:15:21] I said I got to get into her room and I
[1:15:25] got to be able to talk to her and and I
[1:15:27] had all kind of opposition different
[1:15:30] ones saying we don't want nobody here
[1:15:32] visiting we just only want the family
[1:15:34] and I had all kind of opposition I said
[1:15:36] well let me just slip down the hall so
[1:15:38] I'm not I'm not saying I'll just pray
[1:15:39] and we God open up a door I'm going
[1:15:41] right there into that room and I'm gonna
[1:15:42] talk to this lady by giving her heart to
[1:15:44] the Lord now the Lord opened up the door
[1:15:48] and you know they kicked everybody out
[1:15:50] the room and in the Lord and everybody
[1:15:52] kind a lot of them went home so I just
[1:15:53] stayed in hospital the Lord opened up
[1:15:55] the door and I walked right on through
[1:15:57] and I said okay I just need to get right
[1:15:59] in her ear she couldn't respond amen the
[1:16:02] way that you all could respond to me
[1:16:04] tonight but they say that when a person
[1:16:05] is leaving the last thing that go is
[1:16:07] their hearing so I got right in her ear
[1:16:10] not told her the experience that a
[1:16:12] granddaughter hat and I say what that
[1:16:14] meant to me is that you were not ready
[1:16:15] to go I say ma'am you might not be able
[1:16:18] to repeat these words but I want to lead
[1:16:19] to to the Lord Jesus so that you will be
[1:16:22] ready to go
[1:16:23] hallelujah and I began to pray with that
[1:16:25] lady right there in the room her family
[1:16:27] was there many of them witnesses and
[1:16:29] within a couple days after that
[1:16:30] experience God called her home
[1:16:33] God brought her back in order to get her
[1:16:36] ready to go God brought her back
[1:16:40] hallelujah they wasn't the nurses that
[1:16:43] brought her back God brought her back in
[1:16:46] order to get her ready to go
[1:16:48] and God positioning placed us so we
[1:16:50] could be there I was reading a quote and
[1:16:52] I won't have time to read it here
[1:16:54] tonight but brother Branham said you
[1:16:55] know sometimes he say when I lost my
[1:16:58] mother he said no actually I didn't lose
[1:16:59] my mother I didn't lose her she just
[1:17:02] went ahead of me and she's just waiting
[1:17:04] on me to get there
[1:17:08] as a believer you don't lose nobody they
[1:17:12] just went ahead of you I start thinking
[1:17:13] about my daddy I ain't lose my daddy he
[1:17:15] just went ahead of me and just waiting
[1:17:17] on me to get there
[1:17:18] you know I daddy always went ahead of
[1:17:21] you well you know in order to teach me
[1:17:24] how to drive daddy had to go ahead and
[1:17:27] me in order to teach me how to ride how
[1:17:30] to ride a bicycle daddy had to do it
[1:17:32] before I did it huh
[1:17:34] and order to handle myself in search
[1:17:36] situations to give me wisdom on how to
[1:17:38] handle myself daddy had to go through
[1:17:40] those things before I did daddy went
[1:17:42] through it before I did any just waiting
[1:17:45] on me to come church I'm encouraged I'm
[1:17:54] encouraged this has been an incredible
[1:17:57] year I want to read you a quote here
[1:18:00] from why Christ speak the daintiness is
[1:18:09] 63-0 7 1 4 m 63-0 7 1 4 m and the
[1:18:16] paragraph numbers 161 maybe there are
[1:18:19] some things here tonight they say I'm
[1:18:21] still holding on and I know we got some
[1:18:23] things that we still believe in God for
[1:18:24] a man there's we had I believe eight
[1:18:29] houses and or apartments or whatever it
[1:18:31] was this year but there's one more we
[1:18:33] still wait now there's at least one more
[1:18:36] we wait so God ain't done yet my god I
[1:18:40] ain't done yet and and and and my faith
[1:18:44] is just on the line for some more
[1:18:45] incredible things but but here this
[1:18:48] thing I want to encourage you with this
[1:18:50] quote the Prophet says for you see faith
[1:18:53] sees what God wants done faith looks to
[1:18:58] see what God wants and it works
[1:19:01] accordingly that's what faith does it
[1:19:04] sees what God wants and what God wants
[1:19:08] done and faith operates through that he
[1:19:12] says this faith is a long-range vision
[1:19:15] that means faith don't just stop
[1:19:18] December 31st
[1:19:20] come on somebody faith gonna keep going
[1:19:23] over to the next year hallelujah faith
[1:19:26] is a long-range vision and look at this
[1:19:30] it don't lower its sights if the thing
[1:19:36] if Satan coming try to bring some doubt
[1:19:38] he might as well forget about it faith
[1:19:40] will not lower its sights look at this
[1:19:43] it holds to the target
[1:19:45] it says Amen any good shooter knows that
[1:19:49] see that is a long range it's a
[1:19:51] telescope it's a binocular that you
[1:19:54] don't look around here you don't use
[1:19:57] binoculars to look to see what time it
[1:19:59] is
[1:20:00] see you don't use that but you use
[1:20:03] binoculars to look away off and faith
[1:20:08] does that faith picks up gospel oculus
[1:20:12] both of them both sides the New
[1:20:14] Testament and the Old Testament and sees
[1:20:17] every promise that he made and faith
[1:20:20] sets it out yonder and faith chooses
[1:20:23] that regardless of what the present
[1:20:27] tense says here can I say that again
[1:20:29] faith chooses that regardless of what
[1:20:34] the present tense says here he looks at
[1:20:38] the end he don't drop his sights down to
[1:20:43] look this away he looks out yonder he
[1:20:46] keeps the crosshair danced centered on
[1:20:48] the word that's what faith does that's
[1:20:52] the faith that's in man that does those
[1:20:55] things I want to encourage you keep your
[1:20:57] faith your crosshair is dead sitting on
[1:20:59] it and don't look don't lose sight of
[1:21:01] your target you have what your axe got
[1:21:04] for a man we see it's not impossible for
[1:21:11] him but he said there's nothing
[1:21:13] impossible for us and I believe that
[1:21:16] this has been an incredible year and I
[1:21:19] just wanted to just take some time
[1:21:21] tonight just to thank the Lord for all
[1:21:22] these tremendous things that he's done
[1:21:24] for this this group of believers god is
[1:21:29] good god is good
[1:21:32] and I don't I don't know who wouldn't
[1:21:34] want to serve a god like this a Manny
[1:21:36] blesses beyond my expectations
[1:21:40] hallelujah so many things so many things
[1:21:43] that the Lord has done and my mind just
[1:21:47] annoys me just to believe for for more
[1:21:49] for more he's not a God that does less
[1:21:52] is a God that does more amen let's pray
[1:22:01] father we're just grateful and want to
[1:22:09] just take a little time Lord to make
[1:22:12] mention of the great deeds that you've
[1:22:14] done in our mence
[1:22:15] you've proven yourself Lord to be
[1:22:18] Jehovah Jireh
[1:22:19] Oh God
[1:22:22] providing houses cars apartments Lord
[1:22:29] you you'd proven to be Jehovah Rapha and
[1:22:32] providing healings God we've seen you do
[1:22:40] restorations we watch your Lord and in
[1:22:45] just so many ways just the the the many
[1:22:48] things God that I some things that just

[1:23:03] above all we can ask a thank God we saw
