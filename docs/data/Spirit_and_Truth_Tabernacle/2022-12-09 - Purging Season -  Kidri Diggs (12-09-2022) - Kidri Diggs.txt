phrase report I won't um either brother or sweet or you you and Joseph just shared that bridge report of what happened uh the video that you sent me and May y'all be seated just for a moment amen I was just really blessed by just the report but you all can just come in to share amen uh that that bridge report praise the Lord God bless expected um last night we picked the kids up and we um went to I was working pretty late and then uh Linda's horses at another barn and we had to go over there and feed the horse at the end of the night maybe like around 10 o'clock when we're coming out I actually saw like like kind of by the canal but I thought it was like a flashlight or something I turned I started driving like a minute after I was driving um Joseph is like Pops that was a car that was on the side of the of the canal and I saw two lights I was like it's not playing like stop playing and we're like you know what if you saw that I have to turn around just just in case and if you turn if I turn around and there was no car unit Falls that's literally what we said you know um he's like well I saw a car let me be a false prophet so we turned around and like like he saw we get there and there's a guy inside the car I only by God's grace that um the the truck did not go all the way to the canal it was on the side hanging by the tires we get there the guy is he to me he was a little under the influence not super drunk but he was on the phone and not paying attention talking to his girlfriend and that's how he lost control so I went in there and I pulled him out he couldn't barely get him out but I pulled him out and we called 9-1-1 and when I called number one Joseph put the window down he said he said pops can I just go out there and pray for him and and and and and um and thank the Lord and I was like I I wasn't thinking of praying for him I wanted to get this guy like out so I just I was like well that's what you want to do man you you come out here and you pray and this is what and as he started there was something that was something was missed but when he started um I was just like something told me like just just record you know so I got my phone and I recorded here it is so shall we go help that brother as you guide the hands of the tow truck people that they get the card left or latched on right without it falling into the canal because Lord um or I know that this is a special vehicle to this man father God and Lord God I just thank you for allowing me to be uh uh the way you went and not letting it be a whole different story father God and Lord God we just thank you for uh uh or letting this man live as he could have uh been easily injured Lord Lord God we just thank you Lord because you're the same yesterday today and forever father God and you don't let no one down lord you your your goal is to lift yourself lights higher not lower father nine and Lord God Lord God as this devil this filthy Devil's trying to mess up this man's night father God we rebuke him in the name of Jesus and stomp him under our feet Lord we put him to the side Lord amen and we bring Jesus and say or get behind me Satan father God Lord God we put Jesus first and yet killed the Devil he's here to kill he's here to kill steal and destroy but we rebuke him in the name of Jesus amen [Music] I was blessed when I got that testimony today and um just um it was unexpected brother Jose for you all to travel there and see that man uh Hanging On The Edge there but uh just the way all that worked out I'm just wondering you know that that I know he might not have been also but my God see a young man like that praying a fight I think I think it did something for the man when he went home I think it did something for him when he went home and just appreciate Brother Joseph being sensitive you know to the spirit of the Lord and and uh just praying from his heart you know for the gentleman and you know and if we could just touch a life uh then our living is not in vain amen so I was just blessed by that testimony what but what a wonderful testimony may never see y'all again but that was enough to cause him to think on his ways amen praise the Lord amen Let's uh uh have tonight's uh announcements and um and then we will just move forward in a service uh my God I hope y'all come on expectation amen I I know the Lord of me to see him a very special way get this Sunday morning I will be here for prayer service 9 A.M to 10 a.m and then our Sunday morning service will start at 10 30 a.m We will continue our streaming through Twitter Facebook and also our church website uh john423.org and uh there's a youth uh outing Fellowship I guess I didn't call it that's going to happen on Sunday uh at 2 30 p.m it's going to be held at our home and this is for ages 16 and under and we want to be very very uh mindful that it will start at 2 30. please don't come early in their time if they gotta get some things prepared before the youth get there so just give them time to do that but also we want to encourage you have your young people bring changing clothes because some of the things that they'll do may cause them to get uh you know

Youth they will have food for them so just keep have to feed them they'll take care of that but this 2 30 will be the time it'll start and bring changing clothes I think it'll be beneficial for them

name we pray amen amen [Music] I want to say it had to be about maybe two years ago I think roughly two years ago I went to a Minister's meeting there in South Carolina and that they were hosting it at brother arms my brother Anderson's Anderson's church and uh brother Diggs come out there that night and did song servicing and he sung this song and I could barely sing if he was singing a second barely sing that because I need to write all that down I don't know where that come from and uh I got back home I had just been telling my daughters about this little group that they like Maverick City like they don't say nothing they don't do nothing to give them a hard time then I brought this song back they said Daddy you know where that song come from I said well Maverick City that's a whole lot where they got one good one uh but uh but I really like this one amen it's my Declaration of my faith amen and when I'm going through it I'm going to see the goodness of the Lord no matter what I'm going through I am going to see the goodness of the Lord he's God of my present he's God of my future amen he he holds it all together my God he never let go he never let go he never let go so I I just I just like praising him like this as we just get ready a man for a brother Diggs to come up tonight let's dance our feet and let's sing this song with all of our heart amen my faith fulness remains Hallelujah I believe that I will see that's it I believe Hallelujah that I will see the goodness of the Lord the goodness of the Lord I'm confident that seasons change and I'm confident yes as seasons change all your faithfulness oh remains I believe that I will see the goodness of the Lord come on say I said I believe yes that I will see the goodness of the Lord the good foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] amen praise the Lord [Music] you know God good [Music] his love endured forever amen and he never changes you know so we definitely appreciate the lovely Lord Jesus Christ it's good to be with you all again amen I certainly appreciate my brother and friend brother Jack hey man uh you know we always say let's we go way back way back you know and um [Music] you ought to appreciate what the Lord is doing hey man don't be deceived by your eyes but God has a way to do things you know and a lot of times he's just kind of what we're going to talk about tonight he's testing us all right you know amen so let's just uh have a word of prayer and we'll get right into the word of God Amen if you have a request you can acknowledge to the Lord about uplifting hand amen Lord Jesus father we love you and we thank you Lord for all your mercy Lord and the grace that you've given unto us Lord to know that we don't deserve it Lord but it's your choosing Lord It's Your Way Lord and you shall fit Lord to bump into US Lord and change our lives for we wasn't even looking for you Lord but Lord you predestinated us before the foundation of the world and there's not a trial that can change that predestination Lord a situation or or anything can change what you have for us Lord so Lord God just make it well with our souls Lord give us the right attitude the right Spirit Lord and Lord you see the needs Lord that I lifted before you Lord prayed you touch it Lord and make our desires Lord according to your desires for we repeat back unto you not our will but thy will be done a blessed to serve it tonight forgive us for all our sins and trespasses in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen hey man let's get a little one more hand clap of praise hey man praise the Lord hey man again good to see everybody let's turn to uh Deuteronomy the 8th chapter you know I I just I just want to express to you all amen good to see some South Carolina people in the house now y'all from Florida but you stay in South Carolina you know so good to see South Carolina in the house laughs amen amen praise the Lord but you know church one thing I'm realizing more and more if when you when you're going through things the place of strength is in the word because the word cannot change it cannot fail it cannot be altered so if you can find yourself in the word you can receive that strength amen so let's just go to Deuteronomy the 8th chapter verse let's just start it uh verse one the Bible says all the Commandments which are commandedly this day shall ye observe to do that ye may live and multiply and go in and possess the land which the Lord swear unto your fathers and thou shall remember all the way which the Lord thy God LED thee these 40 years in the wilderness to Humble thee and to prove thee to know what was in thine heart whether thou wouldest keep his Commandments now if I could add something in there just for Spirit of the truth to make the Writ go up to leave the building and be out of school to see what was in thy heart whether you would continue or not and listen what he said he said and he humble thee and suffered thee to hunger and fairly with Manna which thou knowest not neither did the fathers know that he made that he might make thee know that man do not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord those Man live hey man let's go to um Saint John chapter 15. St John chapter 15. we're also going to start at verse 1. the Bible says I am the True Vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that bearth fruit he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit [Music] now you are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine nor more can ye accept ye abide in me may the lord of the Blessed reason of his word you can have your seats Amen to tonight if I if I can use for assault I'll call us tonight purging season purging season and you know uh one thing about what's going on Church um there's not a lack of word we have plenty of word there's nothing wrong with the message the message is still the same you know there's nothing wrong with God he's still God but what's happening is the trials are getting more intense and along with our trials in this season we're in God has not giving us an explanation we're just going through it and you know in scenes we're going through we're not even ready for it Hallelujah and you know we have to go through these things but at the same time what God is doing he's checking our attitudes and you know a lot of times what we what we do uh and I know if I could speak personally what we do we when we go through things the first thing we do is we zero everything in on that ain't nothing but the devil all right but let's go back to what the scripture says the Bible says remember how I led you these 40 years so the devil wasn't the one in control of the journey God was and church we're no different amen God is in control of our journey so even though things it doesn't look like it's things that a Christian should go to Let's realize this we're on a Proving Ground and we have to be proved by God hallelujah but a lot of times the proving by God first must start it must go through the realm of humility Hallelujah and humility starts with being stripped Hallelujah I know what I'm talking about hallelujah hallelujah humility deals with Hallelujah people looking at you in a different light even when you ain't in nothing wrong you ain't even got no explanation for what you're going through you feel like defending yourself but what God is doing is humbling you [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah but not only is he humbling you he's purging you at the same time because it's that trial that's going to bring things out of you that been in there that nobody could see even though you're a born again Christian see I think I think we we forgot about that part all right that there is a purging for the believer Paul said Hallelujah even the prophet of God said in the church age book that there is a measure of suffering for the bride but what we do amen we we want flowers all the time we want candy not just any kind of candy candy with peanuts in it candy with caramel I mean something that's real real sweet amen because we're in a time right now where you're gonna have to believe what you say you believe Hallelujah and you're gonna have to live by what you say you believe amen and church as we look in the Bible amen and you know we read Deuteronomy amen let's go back there real quick you know as we look Church you know we think about it why did God take 400 years he could have easily brought them into the promised land God has a purpose you know church he he he God allows things to happen at an appointed time because certain people have to be in position Hallelujah so we want it quickly we want it right now but that might not be somebody who ain't here who's supposed to be here somebody here who's not supposed to be here so what God will do God allows things to happen so people's perspective can change you say it like this church we know God is real Hallelujah this man didn't see God do miraculous things the sister different ones all of you you've seen God do miraculous things so what's going on right now what's going on why we ain't in the place that we've been praying about what's happening there's a Persian going on Hallelujah because one thing I want you to understand if I could speak personally if I could speak like I'm a part of the family the burden of a new building is not his burden it's supposed to be the burden of the people [Applause] but what we're doing we're sitting back we live I want that brother Jack uh about the building yet I wonder if he went by this place I wonder if he went by why don't you go oh please why don't you ask God to lead you see Church the Wilderness holy the whole thing about the Wilderness it was weeding out who was real believers it was weeding out who really stood with the message of Moses because when they gave out when they came out everybody was like I'm a Believer to those trials started to come right now all right all right what church you go to Spirit and true the experience you had to almost revert back to his humble beginnings I was there I know what I'm talking about Hallelujah we look like we had just started that's what it looked like right now look like we're back down in Lantana at least the lantana hallelujah look like we're back down there in a storefront Hollywood but what is God doing God is proving the money and he's hungry he's letting people hallelujah prove what's really in their heart by bringing it back down to simplicity can you serve God Hallelujah in a simple manner yeah bro Jack right now I'll tell you right now if God will move this thing into a big old building Harley you'll get more members than you can have cause they want to be a part of something big but let's be a part of something small first Hallelujah let's be a part of the foundation let's be a part of things Hallelujah that's building it up so when it gets shaky it can't fall Hallelujah but Hallelujah when I look at this and I think about a person the Bible says hallelujah in Hebrews that uh wants to worship us Purge there should be no more sacrifice for sin Hallelujah there should be no more conscience of sin amen no more desire of sin what's your Purge amen but I want to take it a little bit deeper than that because a lot of times when we look at that scripture right there we're talking about only our desire the purging of wanting and sanctification but let's go a little bit deeper amen I want to tell you just like God had to tell me that there are some things inside of you that only a child can break out [Music] okay if we start with the children of Israel let's go down the journey God begins to deliver them with signs and wonders don't we have that in the church sign the ones you just you just heard the testimony amen turning around and praying over a man and pretty much saving his life we come back with the testimony Harley we know God is with us amen but what about in the times when you don't feel like it is he still God is your church still the place you want to be how do you still love everybody Hallelujah but Turf when we look at the purging amen what was God doing as soon as God began to deliver God began to show signs and wonders everybody even some of the Egyptians are saying I'm a Believer I'm out of here let's go they even start going to pharaoh and say how long you gonna try to fight against their God we didn't lost everything let's get about it let them people go holy church and even Hallelujah the Egyptians started to give them some of their blessings some of their materials now if I can let's go into the scripture Hallelujah the Bible said let's tap ourselves into the word the Bible said Moses begin to how do you tell the people to give but then when was the last time your pastor said the words of Moses the needs have been met don't nobody give no more oh it's in the Bible am I in the book Moses said the knees have been met we don't need you to give no more we don't live in that day because we got closer brother Brown oh don't take up no don't call for money and don't just don't do this is that not a cause but we selectively Hallelujah give according to how we want to give Church you know what we could really shake this thing and make things happen if we really want to Hallelujah and I'll be the first one to say hallelujah I've learned to give more Hallelujah because honey is a twofold purpose in that scripture it says give and what it shall be given unto you Hallelujah but a lot of times when we look at is what we're giving what you give it ain't nearly what you can receive when it comes to God what you give and don't even measure up what God has for you but what I look at and I see amen that God in in in a season of purge and what it does is whoever you are and whatever you are is gonna just come out of you as the trial is coming forth whatever's in you is going to come out you remember brother Brandon said he wanted to take his daughters and and move him up on the Indian Reservation he said but then God began to deal with him and tell him said whatever's in that child it's gonna come out whether it's on the Indian Reservation whether it's down in the Gated Community or wherever they at whatever's in him it's gonna come out and you know that's what we're afraid of we're afraid to turn it loose and let God have it Hallelujah you know we're afraid to just say yeah that's my child but I'm praying for it yeah that's my child but I'm praying for him we're afraid how people gonna look at us and you know what's happening it ain't just your child going through it's you being purged oh cause you got an image to uphold I'm a Believer that I can't have my child I hear my child you know my child gotta let him go through it holy just to Humble you so you can show them what Real Love Is see real love is to be able to love somebody when you don't agree with what they doing [Music] [Applause] you gotta have something within you to do that [Music] but look first things first God began to deliver to people with many signs and wonders and after it was all over you know no more signs and wonders they just had to walk with God and as they began to walk with God what's starting to stir up their past they started to think about where they came from first things first what was in them it started to come out complaining oh we had melons in Egypt all we had just oh we had that what happened that trial brought out that they were an ungrateful people wow amen amen amen and as they went along they murmured about this they mummered about that they mumbled and mummered and mummered and even to the place that God told Moses Moses move aside I kill all of them but God had a man in place Hallelujah that would intercede for the people in the purgencies and I said even right now God has a Ministry in place that will intercede for the people in the purging season when you get mad at skip church when you get mad at the ministers don't shake their hand God will see the word hallelujah that'll keep the plague off of you amen he'll see no word he'll have the ministry standing between the people hallelujah and death amen just like you did in the scripture oh my but when you think about being purged God will hold you purging the children of Israel and we look at it and we say man that wasn't nothing but the doubt or what it was the leading of the Lord because what God was doing sister Brown he was cleaning the church out he was showing all that cried to be Abraham see when Abraham's seed and the more intense the trial got the more people showed who they were oh see it breaks me to job and we know the story of Job you know what we can preach on Joe for hours and hours but what about when it comes to your house let me tell you something amen I know personally you will go through things simply because it's a bit between God and the devil [Applause] you ain't doing nothing wrong you ain't talked about nobody you praying you paying your tithes you're coming to church but simply because the devil challenged God about you a simple bet a week when God has already told the devil I want to go ahead and try this one try this one but what I want you to realize Hallelujah God has a way that he looks at you before you even go through it go back and read it amen before they eat job even went through the trial God testified over job to the devil God told the Devil he's perfect now if I'm going through a battle in God and already told the devil I'm perfect how can I lose [Applause] oh my I'm being purged unto perfection oh my that word perfect means complete without fault without error hey man and if God comes and tells the devil simply on a bet that there's none like him in all the Earth and we go through it and we complain and complain and complain law oil and this and we didn't prayed about this we didn't fast and we didn't do this let me tell you if it ain't been 25 years shut up and keep praying foreign look at the whole purpose of it what was he doing one he was proven to the devil Hallelujah that you can't curse what I blessed even though they going through something amen just because you're going through it that doesn't mean there's a curse on your life amen going through it means that you're being strengthened and Hallelujah Hallelujah because the Bible says amen even when you're bringing Full fruit she will bring you for fruit we're serving the lord we're in we're in a Heavenly atmosphere we're here people are being struggling in the Lord even when you're in your purpose God said that he'll Purge you that you bring forth more fruit holy what does purging means let's look at it Church think about a man filled with the Holy Ghost still has to be purged a sister filled with the Holy Ghost still has to be purged now I know that's probably against the way some of y'all think everything good ain't nothing wrong with me you want to bet you want a you don't you don't fight until you get the whole thing because without the Holy Ghost you will lie down and accept whatever comes your way but it's the holy ghost that allows you to get back up and say no I'm not going to stay in this condition Hallelujah [Applause] oh you look at Persian Church the word Purge it means to cleanse or rid of impurities so you mean to tell me Hallelujah that the Bible says even when I'm bringing for fruit I got impurities in me and you know amen is on that one huh we are striving for Perfection we are trying to get back to everything Adam lost and I'm here to say that it's here but we got to have the right attitude to possess it amen Church look at how we did throughout all the scriptures everybody look uh Moses was ordained to be a prophet amen but how did he get in his position he had to be purged the gift of Deliverance was already in him everything he needed was already there but God had to put him in a position that he could be humble enough to be used every Power he would need every spoken word Authority he would need people naturally he would need was already in him the thing God wanted was all of it to operate under humility so he had to bring him through a purging first Hallelujah so what did he do amen he let him start real high in the palace house he let him get the best of the best purse the best food the best clothing the best women the best service everything you could offer was the best Hallelujah did his mama come to him and brought him real down low and say you know you're one of us [Applause] purging started right there But Not only was a purging it was now approving because what his mama was saying to him God was going to prove it to him that she was lying but it had to start on the inside first Hallelujah and now you think about Moses Moses had the best of the best he was he was throw his military man he could fight he could do all these things and then his mama come in and shake his world this woman ain't your mama I'm your mom I know you think I'm just a servant taking care of you but no you came from me you're one of us and probably pull out of Israelite garlic [Music] Hallelujah and there was something inside of Moses that could identify with what she was saying he didn't even know where it was coming from but he felt the connection Hallelujah church that just like you and me amen we could have followed Billy Graham we could have followed all rivals but what are we follow we're following the voice of a man some of us have never seen oh my God yes what is it it's a walk of humility because most of the things the prophet talk about in his own personal Journey we can't prove it we have to take it by faith that's not exactly right and the only way you could do that is it is is you walk through the Walk of humility trust me I haven't been there on the mountain and looking for Eagles rocking all these things and all the stuff all the pictures you got and then you get there you say my picture don't look like this y'all haven't been there to Speedo Canyon pictures we got with eagles rocking all that stuff you get there ain't none of it is gone and the first thing the devil did do I don't know about y'all was the first thing he ever did to me hmm I wonder if it's true I wonder if any of is true but where's your hope your hope and your strength is in the word don't never let the devil have the word the last word Satan will speak but if you're a Believer God will always follow every trial with the word and then church at that moment I'm up on I'm up on the mountain amen it was me brother Israel and another brother named Samuel amen it was Israel the nation Hallelujah Samuel the prophet and me the bride Hallelujah and we were all on top of the mountain they said here it is brother Jesus I say ain't nothing on that rock that's just a plain Rock he said it was red dead he said but the fanatical people didn't carved it out oh man now I just got to believe in something that I've always seen but I can't prove it how do you prove this message by your life you don't prove it by your pictures you don't prove it by your quotes you prove it by your life that's why I don't care what they say brother Brandon this brother Brandon he had this he did this ain't happened that ain't happen I can tell you what get happened I was changed Hallelujah I can tell you what did happen the places I used to go I don't go no more the thoughts I used to think I don't think no more the stuff I used to say I don't say no more you know why cause I've been purged Hallelujah and I'm in a season amen where God is still cleaning and you know what I was coming down the mountain brother jagging and the devil's a c uh-huh all these years and now you get there ain't nothing there to it then God says blessed is he who believe and have not seen y'all want to talk about a praise dance Hallelujah because God began to show me amen some things you got to get it like Paul got earlier he wasn't there with the disciples but he got the same Revelations once he contacted the Messiah [Applause] Patricia we could just look at the purging for a minute it says to cleanse or rid of impurities to cleanse a rid of impurities foreign matter wow some of y'all got foreign first thing you do when you're preparing a dish you want a clean pot you want a clean pot cause you no doubt you're gonna make it dirty But first you gotta start with something clean Harley you start adding your ingredients and mixing and everything and doing this and doing that and once you get that dish complete hallelujah what do you do if you're gonna use it again it has to be purged it has to be clean it has to be washed it has to be made fit for the use of something else to go further with what you desire and that's what God does hallelujah he will allow us to get in situations he'll allow us to go through trials because there's things in us that need to be purged out Hallelujah none of us knew that Abraham was a liar but God did foreign didn't know it Hallelujah all of his service Hallelujah they didn't know it but God did holy so what did God do earlier God put him in a situation Hallelujah well what was in him that nobody else see could be purged out what was it it was a child man came in to say I want your wife and the thought of him losing his wife made him tell a lie but first of all he lied because he was protecting himself that's not humility yeah that's not humility is protecting himself so what God did God put him in the place Hallelujah well he felt like he was inferior amen even though he was the father of Nations now this is what I want to challenge you with where are you getting those thoughts of fear from ain't coming from God they're not even a part of your journey you create your own situations of fear because God is not giving us the spirit of fear so where is it coming from your imagination church if we look we this is the reason why we have to be Purge because fear takes over our journey and we start to do things that doesn't reflect the character of God if you look Church Adam and Eve were created what in the image of God Adam was created in the image of God the likeness of God hallelujah and nothing could stop him nothing could challenge him until he didn't look at himself like God looked at him anymore and as Adam you know God had no reason to purge him because he was just like him our life he felt like him everything else uh God did he could do it through Adam it wasn't until Hallelujah Adam began to think different that he had to become purged and what caused the purging Hollywood him listening to something that God didn't say [Applause] and when we listen to things that God didn't say hallelujah we're really operating under a measure of fear because you look Church Hallelujah God comes down in the cooler today like he always did Adam and Eve had seen what was the first thing they did they ran from God that Comfort they never read from God before now all of a sudden they running from God what was it amen things had changed Hallelujah church I'll tell you right now if you look over your life Hallelujah what's stopping your progress spiritually is the spirit of fear praise the Lord because fear is the first attribute of sin after the fall my God yeah the original attribute was adultery Hallelujah but after adultery man began to operate in fear and everything he did was fear everything he talked about Was Fear all of his situation was products of fear because man never knew fear and what I love about God God always challenges our fear amen he always challenged your fear that's why you go through the trials you go through Church let's let's understand this you're not going through the things that you don't have a problem with it that's not a test amen if you never smoke you never drink God ain't gonna take it he'll sit you in a room put that on the table you look at it like like it's a thing of Kool-Aid it don't even bother you but if you the person who used to smoke out use a person who used to take it down God allow you Hallelujah to get in a situation where you got to know what you're supposed to know about yourself and let me say this fear will have you running from your deliverance wow all right we don't praise God church one thing about it Satan he wants you to run from your deliverances I remember one time I I like telling his testimony because it's funny to me I mean one time I went out with a brother I was preaching for him he took me to the restaurant you know the restaurant had music playing in the bar and you know how we as believers they got a bar in there right all right you going there to drink or you going to eat foreign I don't know about you when I go to Applebee's I ain't going to drink I'm going to eat I got ribs and chicken on my mind Hallelujah but for somebody who doesn't appreciate or who's confident in their Deliverance they run from me it's not supposed to have power for you you're supposed to have power over it see you're not supposed to fear what you were delivered of holy I'm not saying amen hallelujah you want to be at the club shaking and doing it and dancing and throwing it around you know you want to be doing that what I'm saying if you find yourself around that certain thing you're not afraid because you know what God did huh but me and his brother was in the restaurant and the day was playing some rock and roll music and you know they had that good that good talk whistling like princess playing baby he's old bro Jesus I'm so sorry about the music we fellowship and talking and eating music oh bro Jesus I'm so sorry about the music I said bro I'm good I can't be I came here to eat music wasn't bothering me but what was happening was he was having about it and he tried to make me a part of his battle yeah if you don't have full Deliverance don't bring somebody else in Hallelujah just ask God for mercy and Grace and keep it pushing earlier but don't try to make me weak with your weakness don't try to make me identify with your struggle holy God has delivered me from those things holy and he's like brother these I'm sorry I'm sorry I finally I said look bro this ain't bothering me this ain't bother me I ain't grew up with no rock and roll this ain't bothering me now if it was some rap it'll be something different I have no struggle with this you do yeah and you know a lot of times in the church the things that we have struggles with we try to put it on somebody else tell the past about Jack you know so and so did someone so dressed this way and I can't pay attention to church my sister so and so yeah it ain't so the sword sword that lust demon you got on it see it's the purging God will put things right in front of your face just so you can see you in as hole as you thought you was but what he'll do he'll have that thing that they'd be buried way down in it but that trial arriving on up see let's understand church I ain't calling you a devil what I'm saying to you tonight your goal your deity and deity has to be what beat on goal has to be Beto he has to be purged he has to get all the drops and filth out of it why because God knows it's real go oh and let's understand something about real gold real gold is not found in the palace it's found in a dirty Dark Places maybe a cave or a minoring but it takes somebody Hallelujah who knows his value to get down there and dig it out Hallelujah and that's what we have we have a five-fold Ministry who knows the value of the deity inside the church and they're getting there and preaching dig it out Hallelujah it'll talk about your household it'll talk about your children it'll talk about your marriage it'll talk about your job it'll talk about your absentee it'll talk about your finances what is it doing it's digging out all the places you are afraid of where to go Hallelujah but it's gold and to get the real value out of gold it has to be beat on but first things first you got to be heated up and right now it's getting hot in here come on I don't know about your life but I'm on fire [Laughter] I'm on fire I'm like Lord Kenny bird can this thing get any hotter yes glory and God speak back and say yeah I want you to be a flame I want you to be a flame and Fire I want you to be so on fire for me that it won't be red it'll be blue now that's when you know it's hot boy you see a blue fire you afraid to put your that's something to use the whale with that kind of fire cut things that gotta find a separate thing Hallelujah and God will let the trial get so hot to begin to separate all those things that you got going on the inside and it was that trial Hallelujah that God allowed Abraham to go through the Persian to get that line out of him and you can correct me if I'm wrong but from that place he never lied again wow because he never had a reason to fear anybody after that because God came and God dealt with him Hallelujah God dealt with him and even in all of his lack holy a god fought his battle and you know out by the time God was fierce with Abraham God told me to say look here said I hide anything from my servant Abraham when you want to get to that place oh that ain't gonna be too much longer y'all know I'm about to go but he said even when you're bringing for a fruit here perjury that you bring forth more fruit because some of us got things in us that don't reflect God hallelujah you know uh it also means Persian it means it means foreign matters things that God hallelujah has not placed there it's foreign you know when you go into a foreign country you got to have a passport Hallelujah you can't just walk over there and you know that you know they say that girl that just got back Britney Britney ground she just got back I bet she won't be trying to go back no more I got humble big time College they ain't care if she was a lesbian they ain't kept she was a superstar they ain't care what she was nine years changed her whole identity a whole perspective on life hey man I bet you her and her her community and all these things that she was fighting for I bet it ain't mean nothing when that gavel came down she didn't even care about the way she looked anymore she cut her dress off because if she was out there in cold country she said how I used to freeze up she said I can't do this let me cut it off now I guarantee you if she was here she would start protesting fight I got a right to have my hat the way I want and do what I want but God know how to purge you God know how to Humble you yeah that's why I don't be worried about the young people hey man let him go let them do their thing you hey you preach this word container stay consistent Hallelujah we ain't saying agree with what they do and amen but we don't have to be on their back every day every hour every minute God go take care of it he's still God hallelujah God's gonna take care of it church I almost preached tonight I see them do it that'll almost be my subject tonight I've seen him do it you've seen God take you out of a small Church put you in another church Hallelujah if you go from that church to a bigger Church to a bigger place Hallelujah God open the place so much harder if you wanted you could have had the whole platter all right [Applause] say it ain't so say the opportunities ain't never came home then you can take the student take the school rule you take this room Hallelujah before there was ever a Family Dollar in general or whatever they could have had the whole block and we worried about where our next place God already got it he just wants somebody other than him or her or whoever else to be looking for how many of us are hungering for that spot amen glory to God Amen we see them do it amen amen church I don't worry about when I go to the doctor and they prognosis the only thing they can do is tell me I'm all right because that's what the Bible say about me holy us things that have happened in this church that have become Staples in my journey holy and some things I wasn't even here for I just heard about it y'all remember that New Year's Eve service with sister Michelle talked to carpet and she just said something simple but Jack was talking about it she just said something simple praise is what I do stuck with me it's still with me to this day hallelujah amen you think somebody else will just just oh I don't do that fast no don't call me out like praise is what I do [Applause] that's crazy when I come it's worship when I come I ain't worried about what you do but when I come here amen I come to exalt him lift him up and bless his name if the copy got to suffer the copy gonna get it tonight the copy gonna get it tonight for this purpose I came so we can put carpet in the building song Church there are things that have happened I've seen them do it and we worry about the next spot I seen God move people out of the plaza just for y'all [Applause] turn your music down we ain't turning nothing down [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Church we've seen him do it this is our purging season before we get to the next spot let's make sure our hearts are right [Applause] I behold of the blessing somebody Harvard ain't right somebody's life ain't right you got something inside God I want to take to the next spot [Applause] you ain't gonna turn your music down okay well you're gonna need another place for worship you're gonna need another place to go and I ain't gonna say a word I'm gonna just operate in the scripture the battle's not mine is the laws Lord you said Shake the Dust off your feet [Applause] my God somebody need to say that that's all defeat pictures what we have to realize that life our lives are preordained by God there's nothing happening right now that God doesn't know about but when I think about Persian I think about pruning and you know a tree has to be pruned and when it's not because the tree is a bad tree it's because Hallelujah there might be something in a way that's stopping other branches from growing Hallelujah so that branch that they've been producing and they were supposed to do it got to be trimmed down because there's more life around it hallelujah amen don't worry about people that you don't see no more they still might be bribe but they just had to be trimmed down Hallelujah they might have to be trimmed down why so you can rise to your spot [Applause] Hallelujah I don't get into the bitters of who brought and who ain't bride ain't my business yeah oh boy they didn't supposed to get some message they didn't do this that ain't that the only one that can forgive them the only one that can take them in is God [Music] and we have to remember that Hallelujah not only in our Prophet but also in King David he said leave him alone maybe the Lord told him to say that it's sad oh they said I got something I say to my gym people people I go to the gym with I say I just be minding my business hey coach they ain't doing it right but I'm just minding my business I ain't gonna fight you by doing it right I'm just letting you know if you want results you got to do it right Hallelujah but if you don't want to take it I'm just minding my business church I'm in a spot I'm in a place now Hallelujah despite what you might see or despite what you might think I'm living in a room where my my attitude is control what you can control [Applause] how you think about it ain't my business I can't control the balance you got in your head but I can't control who I am Hallelujah Church in this life Hallelujah when you think about the bet it was just a bet between God and the devil over over job and what I love about it amen what you have to realize is that there's no place Satan can ever show up in your life that God doesn't see him God sees him church he said the sons of God wouldn't present themselves before the Lord and the Bible says and the devil came also and what does God say the first thing he says when is coming down Satan see he saw him he knew he was there church there's not anything you go to with God said oh my God man Satan God buy me on that one nothing amen nothing God is already aware and better yet he allows it say I don't know about you but my life spiritual Casino every table in my life is rigged to work out for my Google [Applause] smiling my dice my spiritual dice they'll wait it to always fall on seven foreign [Music] that thing rocks over seven looks like I'm gonna lose the battle he rolls it rocks over seven always works out for your good [Music] every table in your life is rigged by God so let's Satan throw his best out let him go in chalice God and God is saying go hey I already know that everybody you see is a part of the Winner's Circle anything Glory Hallelujah Church a lot of times while holes of the blessing is our attitudes while we're being purged amen and the thing about being purged as a three-cut method when you're cutting that tree there's a three-cut method three cut step on it you don't just go cut the branches there's a method to it there's a science too yeah right because the branches weighted a certain way in season so you go straight to the arm of it and cut it it's so heavy it'll rip down the tree and it'll tear areas that don't need to be torn see that's what some of y'all want to see you want to see the pastor preach on people in church when things go I don't know I better check it out let this brother come preach on this and that I'll let us know that's a three-cup message when you're pruning amen there's a Precision to it first thing you do Hallelujah when you're when you're when you're when you're pruning a tree and when you're cutting what you don't do you just go right to the problem and cut no you come out some you come out some and then the cut is not visible you cut under the bottom where nobody can't see it [Music] other than that the word is dealing with that person and they're being cut hardly in a way that you can't see it maybe the bouncers having confidence with them in ways where you don't see it hurry but what's happening that tree is being pruned hallelujah what we want to see a lot of times things done openly no things got to be done in private a lot [Music] if I learned a long time ago when I thought I was John the Baptist God's not gonna give me the satisfaction of seeing somebody rebuke because I think they're wrong [Music] so what God will do he allowed things to happen so you can get humbled they begin to show me the difference between a pastor and evangelist and I'd be sitting there thinking my brother has a dude I said boy now I lay a lot of lean to that thing I lean until I lean to him the wife the kids the cousins everybody involved I'll lay into everything and God said see that's why you're not a pastor because pastors ain't built like that honey amen they're built to deal with the problem Hallelujah and save as many people as they can while they deal with the problem and the worst person you could be is somebody that want to see somebody hurt God will allowing to go on just to Humble you oh my speaking from experienced Church listen what else is this word purging means Persia also means undesirable elements now don't raise your hand but I know right now in this church while I'm preaching all of us got things about ourselves that are undesirable to us [Music] that we pray about things that we say I almost turned to a bloodhound just now all of us got things that we take to the Lord in prayer and say Lord help me in this area those are situations and things that need to be purged amen undesirable elements to clear and this is the one I want you to catch hardly a purge means to cleanse of guilt how many people on their Christian journey and been saved for years still walk around with guilt and think about where they came from and can't even enjoy where they are because they're living with guilt that's why God takes us through things to purge all that out of us Hallelujah and you may not even realize what what I love about God hallelujah God's a visionary he can see things in you that you don't even know you're a part of you're going to react holy before you even get even get so God sometimes you can look in the mirror four four I switch gears a little bit let's talk about Hallelujah being purged in your position filled with the Holy Ghost being used by God right still got to be you like me I don't know about that bro d That's well let's take it straight out the message brother Brandon had to be purged he had a lying spirit in them that Spirit was always there it was just way down in there and what God did God put him in a situation where that lie had to be told listen I think it's in the third seal where the Prophet talks about Jesus meeting the woman at the well he said what he did was shine light on her past and showed it to her just so he could deliver her from it amen amen because once he showed her her past and her mistake having so many hugs and this and that then the light came on and you say well God will do God will show you a mistake just so he can bring you to your deliverance and what happened church he put the prophet now listen what I started out with holy purging Hallelujah you be in situations you be in Hallelujah things will happen that you have no explanation for that's how the purging comes that's why I say it's purging season look hallelujah look at the prophet fighting the taxes he didn't do anything wrong hey he had proof he was putting the money in the right places he was doing the right thing with the money he was signed it over to the decided over to the church and doing the right thing and all this and that didn't tax people come back and say you owed us and they put some serious pressure and it kept coming kept coming you know he had maybe two or three different phones they could get all lines amen because remember he had a line that he didn't want to be bothered on and I believe it was that line that day the taxi collect the call he was in the house the bat line and the phone began to ring in a profit his wife says bill it's that tax man tell him I'm not in here God put him in that situation because there were more people involved than just him and me and sometimes God will deal with your person to bring somebody else closer to God so now he he walks at the house comes back in and she says now bill you know that just wasn't quite right and he was like well you know I really technically technically you know how we do when your kids you ask your kids something they don't really want to lie so they go all the way around the mountain but they still lying yeah in church he said it will take me I wasn't in the house I bought it out blah blah blah you know Bill you know that ain't quite right y'all know the story so he goes on about his business being a prophet got a call to go pray for somebody ain't thinking nothing about what he just did but God was now he gets operating in his Commission what God calls him to be Hallelujah pray for the sick and now he's dead praying feeling praying God said you ain't fit to pray for that person you just told a lie and that thing struck him anyway what did he do it humbled him man amen humbled him to prove him it humbled him and he says God tells him gonna make it right and he goes go find the um tax man the lawyer whoever he was go to his office and confesses to him say look when you called I was there but I walked out and I'm sorry I lied to you and that man says I always have respectfully and now I got greater respect see him humbling in himself brought that man closer to the vision so sometimes you just being purged allows the other branches to get some of that light oh and it don't feel good being purged but the end the end of the whole thing is that the tree continues to live earlier and live and produce a well let me ask some what stops a tree from producing apples you say time no it ain't time it's supposed to continue as long as it's a tree it's supposed to continue what stops it from producing apple somewhere into the tree got a sickness still look like an apple tree you know it's an apple tree but it's not producing Apple's number what's stopping it it's still an apple tree some kind of way the mechanics in it it's gotten off the Dynamics of the tree has gotten off it's still supposed to produce and let me say ladies if you're not producing something that's gotten off he said even when you're bringing for a fruit you're Purge it that you bring forth more fruit for one more year no we don't put a time limit on it for our clothes I'm gonna read you something oh my God and you know what the Lord has done for me he's allowed me to look at my trials From a Different Light now I laugh at the Devil we like well you know what to do might not look like it but that's what he's doing 100 years ago I was down here I think it was Hurricane Dennis hurricane dinner yeah it was have you beat that brother West Coast Bill Westco a hurricane coming hurricane was in Miami and it was coming up it was blowing I'll shoot [Music] and I'm looking around Jack I'm gonna Smiley y'all Church and they look at me like yeah why not she had never been in this that kind of atmosphere before so they've been there before bro we brought up our house but we're gonna do and we just keep it pushing ain't it wasn't lying people still out in the street getting gas buying food and everything don't they realize a hurricane but somebody like me I was operating in fear they was operating in we gonna come through this we didn't been through this before so we ain't worried about this we gonna come right on through it but for me I was like oh no it's time to go but just being in things like that Hallelujah it lets you see what you're making out and what you're making it out to be somebody else is already overcoming and they ain't looking at it the way you look at it I say this before I close be careful that your imagination doesn't lead you because your imagination can be a product of fear you take you take a young lady who's been waiting to get married she's been waiting a long time and then she's like ain't no boys ain't never gonna get mad I'm listening that's your imagination and you let your imagination lead you out of the Earth from Under the Umbrella of the word and it happens like that with a lot of things we do listen he says oh the fire the fire only Waters it it only gives us New Hope it only strengthens it every trial testing every time a wind hits a tree it shoves it back and forth and back and forth it only loses the roots so it can grow deeper you mean to tell me right now whatever we're going through is making us better making us stronger yeah if you looking at it through the eyes of God he said he said it's getting a better hold every time sickness strikes your home every time trial strikes your home every time the neighbors say something bad about you it only shaking you loosening you up so you can get down and get a better hold on Eternal Rock of God unmovable word so church that's what I'll attest in our trials and different situations are doing what they're doing they're making us stronger if you're not being led by your imagination if you're being led by the promise of God's word you have something to grab hold to and get a better grip Hallelujah cause when it's all said and done when you look back on the purging and and God cleaning us up after that Goldsmith beats that goal and beats that goal he flips it and beats that goal and beats that goal and flips it beats it and he doesn't stop beating it until when sees this reflection and that's all God wants from us yeah if you want us back to the place where he looks at us he sees Adam is very likeness and image again and only we're going to get there is through a purging because we got so much stuff in us to have to come out you know sometimes you'll you'll you'll you'll be riding in your car and somebody just cut in front of you because there's a reaction that God want to get out so you can repent of that thing and I do it again that's what God does Church listen the purging of the spirit I was reading how Paul I'm about to close he says he wanted Deliverance and Paul was like Lord I remember salt you three times about this thing and you know you still hadn't delivered me and God had a purpose for it God was like Paul there's an abundance of Revelation in you so I send a messenger it wasn't a spirit that was going to stay with him he was a messenger to Buffet him for that situation and then he said the prophet of God said what does buffered me buffered me blow after blow so he said it is the journey to get better and God let the messenger come again boom the journey get better he let the message come again boom let the journey get better Mr come boom what was he doing keeping Paul humble right Hallelujah why so he could use them and continue to use them and church look at oh what did all of his trials do his trials help us get where we are Hallelujah he let him go through all of those things because I love Sanders he let him go through all that you know why because he had the book of Romans in him he had the book of Corinthians in him he had the book of uh Philippians the book of uh Ephesus the book of Galatians her first and second Corinthians was inside of him and what brought that out trials Church half of those books he wrote where was he in jail because remember what he ended he ended the book by saying and by the way bring me a coat yeah the Bible says a night and day in the sea Holly went with 40 Stripes at least five times been by a Bible Church he was even Stone why so we could get half of the New Testament why so if God can continue to bring that word out of them now what's your child bringing out of you it's supposed to be bringing something out of you amen there's supposed to be some kind of Victory Church look at it Viper buys them on his head he just shakes it off that don't even get fear didn't even have any place in his journey the prophet God said when fear is gone faith is made perfect Hallelujah that's why Paul could look at her gripping faster than say for this purpose I came I'm going wrong Hallelujah detergent it wasn't just him but God always purged the saints of God I mean like I started with Moses Moses purged Abraham purse you know who else had to be purged like nobody else had to be purged King David amen amen if I don't know crisp I love the story of David and Bathsheba because the parallel of it is David was taking a rest that day but God didn't call him the rest God call him the fight so the day he decided to rest was the day he fought his greatest battle don't get in your mind I've arrived I'm good we yeah this is it you setting yourself up for a major trial and David goes and she sees Bathsheba the prophet God said she knew he'd come out there and sit there it was all planned out and now David Hallelujah he sees better see what we know the story he takes best she would take the man wife now let's look at all the stuff that's gonna come out of King Day all the stuff that was already in him but now it's gonna come out in a perverted way yes brother we knew he was a warrior we knew he was a killer but now it's going to be perverted Hallelujah not sure he's looking he look at that uriah's I mean I got to get rid of this man this baby I know the baby mine but I want the baby to be his and he plotting he's scheming and he lying he cheating he's doing all kind of stuff and you know what church a lot of times Hallelujah we get blinded by our own trial he was doing all this stuff and he didn't even see how guilty he was it's purging season oh now Uriah is dead I'm fast forward y'all know the story uriah's dad and David whoo well I got out an album oh come on girl let's get mad Here Comes Nathan Nathan started to talk to David start telling David a parable about a man who had one sheep his other man had plenty sheep he said he takes the man one sheep and this and that and do all the stuff and they and David say I'ma kill him how dare you a head person I'm a cat and your eyes like David you want to kill yourself that's what you need to kill kill yourself and David was like but the heart of a true Son of God don't try to find a way out of repentance don't try to find a way of being hardly a putting on humility but they operate it even though he was a king Harley that David fell on his knees and said Lord I have sinned earlier that was the difference between him and Saul Saul said it was the people David say I have seen David fell on his knees and then God came back and God said David you ain't gonna die why because he made it right he accepted he accepted The Purge holy why because God had to give us something out of that and out of that trial what do we get Psalms 51. creating me a clean heart oh yeah oh Lord restore unto me the joy of thy salvation take 99 Holy Spirit from me Hallelujah David began to cry out song Hallelujah and now we've seen that song of the ages but all of that came from a Persian but it was child of the child Purge at The Purge why so that we could get those Mighty songs God would take David into battle so David began to operate in the Lord is my shepherd somebody else's child could be your victory so don't cast them down don't talk about them hard it could be something that'll make the church better Hallelujah Church before I close let me read you this come on musician I'm closing that's what he said he said and here was Moses mother in the conflict of the testing of her faith and every child every son that coming to God first must be what tried God test your faith now look now this is what I love about this quote right here he says now look like God could just simply bypass the whole thing can't get amen I'm sure we've all asked that question say Lord Lord I didn't pray that fast yeah I'm sure we lord we don't have to go this route foreign just simply bypassed the whole thing he said and don't have any appropriate way and just cut the thing off but he said but it's better that he gives you a test and then comes to you when you're in the test I'm gonna say like the Pentecostal preacher y'all don't hear me I said God we'll give you a test I say God will give you a test so he can come to you in the test so the test is to bring forth a greater awareness of God in your life a greater appreciation of his presence in your life anybody being tested I hope you looking for God Hallelujah I hope you're looking for God because the whole reason why you're being tested is show that he could show himself in a clear light to you amen amen amen so so before you like uh I'm sick of this I'm sick of all this child don't be sick of it just give God praise I'll give you some of my words Lord I don't know what you're doing but I'm gonna praise your name it might look crazy but I ain't got to prove nothing to nobody all I got to do is continue to serve you Lord hallelujah all I got to do is say thank you Jesus hey man you know sometimes I'll be in charge to be tidy you feel like yawning I turn that yawn into the Hallelujah [Applause] God been good to me [Music] Satan try to make you sick you know we post covered everything is covered now common cold is cold the flu isn't cold everything is cold start coughing every time I cough I say thank you Jesus now how long you think your devil gonna let me cough if I keep saying thank you Jesus he's out of there bye Hallelujah because we're in a Persian season so don't be surprised with the battles just go through but go through them with the right attitude amen just just see that that was the only thing God had to check job with had to check his attitude because they were Tower Jose ah I don't even know why you made me I should have been born about that all right brother talking about that you was born for that purpose holy so God could win the bet Hallelujah don't let your imagination lead you let's pray [Music] Lord we love you tonight we thank you for

are good old Lord your worthy and you are good oh somebody give the Lord Praise in this place tonight my um certainly appreciate the word of the Lord from our precious brother Diggs I think I've probably read that scripture Deuteronomy I don't know how many times but just completely missed uh what the Lord was really trying to say especially I think God has a word for you in every season of your life and um I don't know I guess it just means more to me when um when somebody kind of has been with you along the journey and uh I I love that part I seen him do it all these things that we've done seen God do we we know what he's capable of doing amen he does the exceeding the abundance above all we can ask and thinking but we have to go we have to be willing to go through this purging season and I'm gonna tell you something amen even after we step into our new building you all have need to be aware that there might be another season of purging even during that time now the good thing about urgency not just anytime anybody preached from John 15 they just they preaching my life story because that's that's how this church got started amen based on John 15 and what God spoke to me through that scripture um but when you when you go through urgency the beautiful thing about purging amen is that it always brings forth more fruit it always does that and uh so you have to look to the other side of the process not just what you're going through but what God is doing inside of you amen through the midst of this so I just thank God I just appreciate that I'm happy I came to church tonight praise God I God bless you God bless you brother Diggs thank you so much brother just for delivering your heart to us tonight amen amen amen amen well let's have a word of prayer and man we'll prepare to dismiss a man on tonight father we just thank you for the word that has come uh to us how strengthened we are and courage we are by what we heard uh thank you for using your servant and I thank you for the Saints pressing away out Lord to come and hear the word tonight and I pray Lord that as we leave here we'll go meditating and thinking on the things that you've spoken to us may change take place in our life oh God and may we be warned in the spirit father we don't want our imagination leading us we want the Holy Spirit to lead us the scripture says those that are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God so Lord I pray that we would take time to pray hear you Lord speak to us we trust God that you would just get glory and on out of our lives and help us to realize that whatever we're going through is it didn't catch you by surprise God you knew all about it before it even got started so Lord uh whatever it is that you want to take out of us if you want to Humble us Lord and and help us Lord to realize how much more we need you God we're willing to go through amen I believe that the songwriter said whatever it takes for my will to break that's what I'm willing to do so Lord I pray that you just continue to use your servant Lord as we prepare for the rest of the services this weekend God speak to him amen once again to bring father The Word of Life to us and not only to us Lord but also there to the Saints and point him Lord may you just get all the glory and all the honor all that happens this weekend thank you for what you did tonight and we just appreciate you Lord watch us as we leave this place but not your presence bring us back at the pointed time on Sunday in Jesus name we pray amen amen God richly bless you other brothers
