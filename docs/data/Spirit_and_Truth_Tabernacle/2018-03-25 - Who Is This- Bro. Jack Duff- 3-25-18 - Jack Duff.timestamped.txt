[1:03:45] wonderful job just telling them how this
[1:03:53] appreciate how you know the Lord just
[1:03:56] use them and everything you know he was
[1:04:01] he been into talking about Elijah and
[1:04:04] and how they preach opened the young
[1:04:09] man's eyes and and then you don't have
[1:04:13] to breathe to open one person's eyes
[1:04:16] then they closed the eyes of some others
[1:04:19] and now we're living in the season where
[1:04:22] some people's eyes actually come open
[1:04:24] and other people's eyes are actually
[1:04:26] going closed absolutely that was a
[1:04:28] really really good you know just tight
[1:04:31] there and is talking about the veil and
[1:04:33] everything and actually what I'll do
[1:04:37] because there was something that

[1:04:42] of his message he had mentioned
[1:04:46] something as you know it already closed
[1:04:48] things down and then he went into a more
[1:04:51] testimony and then I think he made a
[1:04:53] statement about just wanting people to
[1:04:55] see Christ in him right so there's after
[1:04:59] the very next day something happened
[1:05:02] where somebody saw crisis but here's a
[1:05:04] service brother Troy let you come in
[1:05:06] they made you close this out and you can
[1:05:08] share that testimony a man about that
[1:05:10] but God just proven himself in in so
[1:05:13] many ways a man here and I missed and I
[1:05:16] was just very grateful a man for for how
[1:05:18] that went a certainly appreciative of

[1:06:15] thank you all for your faithfulness
[1:06:17] amen and the service of the Lord while
[1:06:19] we were wait don't forget the tent means
[1:06:23] what you want to continue to keep that
[1:06:24] in prayer
[1:06:25] we're expecting God to do some great
[1:06:27] things a man I believe I have my praise
[1:06:29] team amen all is simple and and now what
[1:06:34] I'm what we'll do with the praise team
[1:06:35] out we'll get together we'll have to
[1:06:37] start having her CIL's a man on what we
[1:06:40] want to present there but I also just
[1:06:43] one also mentioned out brother branham
[1:06:45] calls personal workers personal workers
[1:06:48] we have anybody that desires a man and
[1:06:51] it's got to be something that the Lord
[1:06:53] calls you to you know because uh not
[1:06:57] everybody can just handle people and
[1:06:59] this is this is more than just you know
[1:07:01] watching people if they follow but this
[1:07:04] is really about being able minister to
[1:07:06] people you don't know who will walk
[1:07:08] through that ten you don't know what
[1:07:11] their conditions would be and now you
[1:07:14] don't know you know justice who they
[1:07:16] don't need just just to be there so we
[1:07:18] need man to do it man sisters to do with
[1:07:22] sisters a man but uh but you know these
[1:07:25] are things that you need to be praying
[1:07:27] it up you need to be ready a man for
[1:07:29] that so if you desire to just kind of be

[1:09:24] something a man that goes right along
[1:09:26] with Palm Sunday a man we want to just
[1:09:30] read the scripture and just kind of get
[1:09:33] into just the word Lord for this I you
[1:09:37] can stand with me and just turn with me
[1:09:39] to Matthew 21 also brother Henry
[1:09:47] Pompeii he called a man and said he just
[1:09:50] wasn't sent his grievance to the church
[1:09:52] and he say playing those coming to see
[1:09:54] us on next Sunday a man for Easter so a
[1:09:58] man keep him in prayer and everything
[1:10:00] but he just wanted to give his greetings
[1:10:01] and respect his regards to you Matthew
[1:10:05] chapter 21 we've been working for a
[1:10:09] number of different sermons here I have
[1:10:10] a book of Matthew a man and so Matthew
[1:10:14] 21 is where we will come from today and
[1:10:17] it says when they drew nigh unto
[1:10:19] Jerusalem and we're coming to Beth Beth
[1:10:23] phage onto the Mount of Olives then sent
[1:10:27] Jesus to disciples saying unto them go
[1:10:31] into the village over against you and
[1:10:34] straightway ye shall find
[1:10:35] and as tied and a Colt with her loose
[1:10:40] them and bring them unto me amen
[1:10:45] and if any man say I'll come to you you
[1:10:49] should say the Lord hath need of them
[1:10:52] and straightway he will send them all
[1:10:57] this was done that it might be fulfilled
[1:10:59] which was spoken by the Prophet saying
[1:11:01] tell ye the daughter of Zion the holder
[1:11:05] king Viking cometh unto the meek and
[1:11:09] sitting upon an ass and a Colt the foal
[1:11:13] of an ass and the disciples went and did
[1:11:18] as Jesus commanded them out just so that
[1:11:21] we were clear because I might not get a
[1:11:23] chance to mention us later on but when
[1:11:26] it says sitting upon and asked and and a
[1:11:30] Colt the foal of an ass that was the the
[1:11:35] the asses child right this would be the
[1:11:40] the the the mother's child the phone
[1:11:43] right this is the child okay so I want
[1:11:46] you to get that and and I and I know
[1:11:49] that when we look at these things
[1:11:52] hopefully you know more just kind of
[1:11:54] bring it out
[1:11:55] a little bit later but just understand
[1:11:57] you know that's what it was it's the
[1:11:59] mother a man and then her her folder
[1:12:02] which is her her son okay this is what
[1:12:05] Jesus is riding here and disciples went
[1:12:08] and did as Jesus commanded them another
[1:12:10] thing I don't know if it said it here
[1:12:11] but uh actually this was the coal the
[1:12:15] coat or this was his first time have any
[1:12:20] writer okay so his his first ride is to
[1:12:26] carry the King of Kings right to carry
[1:12:29] the Lord of lords Oh glory to God a man
[1:12:35] a man and the disciples went and did as
[1:12:39] Jesus commanded them and brought the ass
[1:12:42] and the coat and put on them their
[1:12:45] clothes and they set him there off and a
[1:12:50] very great multitude spread their
[1:12:52] garments in the way now we will catch
[1:12:56] this also later there was three groups
[1:12:59] here there was one group that was
[1:13:00] waiting for him another group that was
[1:13:03] was not looking forward to him coming
[1:13:05] and then another group that didn't know
[1:13:07] what to believe right so this group that
[1:13:10] was waiting for him this is what they
[1:13:12] did and a very great multitude spread
[1:13:13] their garments in the way others cut
[1:13:15] down branches from the trees and strew
[1:13:18] them in the Wayne and the multitudes
[1:13:21] that went before when that follow cried
[1:13:24] saying Hosanna to the son of David
[1:13:27] blessed is he that cometh in the name of
[1:13:29] the Lord hosanna and the highest and
[1:13:32] when he was coming to Jerusalem all the
[1:13:34] city was moved saying who is this and
[1:13:39] the multitude said this is Jesus the
[1:13:41] prophet of Nazareth of Galilee amen the
[1:13:46] Lord and a blessing to the reading of
[1:13:48] his word les BAU a brief word of Prayer
[1:13:52] amen and before we go into I thought
[1:13:54] today father we thank you for the
[1:13:57] privilege the ability to read the Word
[1:14:00] of God but we know it takes the Holy
[1:14:03] Spirit to help us to understand what it
[1:14:06] is that we are reading
[1:14:07] so we pray that God you would give
[1:14:10] enlightenment that you would give
[1:14:12] revelation understanding to these things
[1:14:16] that we've read today may you bless this
[1:14:18] thought that you have given and God may
[1:14:22] may the sick be heal me the bow be set
[1:14:26] free God may let the Holy Spirit pour
[1:14:31] out and feel those that are looking for
[1:14:33] filling those they're looking for a
[1:14:34] refilling God moved by your spirit we
[1:14:37] don't want to ever try to control you
[1:14:39] but we want you to have your way God in
[1:14:41] the midst of this service so be
[1:14:43] glorified and be magnified and exalted
[1:14:45] in our midst thank you for everything
[1:14:47] that's happened thus far and now God
[1:14:49] take the liberty a man over the Word of
[1:14:52] God as it is preached today in Jesus
[1:14:54] name we ask it a man need to be seen
[1:15:13] so we want to take for our title a man
[1:15:17] this morning who is this a man who is
[1:15:21] this and certainly this is a title that
[1:15:27] the Prophet has used multiple times a
[1:15:30] man and you know and one of the sermons
[1:15:36] he actually titled who do you say this
[1:15:40] is I'll be using a lot of quotes a man
[1:15:43] today from that particular sermon and if
[1:15:45] I don't get to the quotes and certainly
[1:15:47] a lot of my inspiration a man is being
[1:15:50] pulled from that praise the Lord and I
[1:15:54] will love you know we'll just kind of
[1:15:56] address it from there
[1:15:57] but uh as we as we look at this question
[1:16:00] who is this that's what they were asking
[1:16:03] here in the scripture as Jesus was
[1:16:06] entering into Jerusalem on the back of
[1:16:10] this this animal a man and and and
[1:16:12] they're seeing the commotion seeing the
[1:16:14] noise they're seeing you know so much
[1:16:17] happening they they ask that question
[1:16:19] who is this a man as he was entering and
[1:16:22] and and today I want to kind of address
[1:16:25] this question
[1:16:26] you know from three different angles if
[1:16:29] I can today I want to use three
[1:16:32] different subjects a man the first of
[1:16:37] our subject today would be Christ
[1:16:39] himself amen Christ was the Messiah he
[1:16:45] was the anointed word of that day and
[1:16:49] he's done or that word of every day but
[1:16:52] yet he's not recognized right he wasn't
[1:16:54] recognized in and he's still not
[1:16:56] recognized the day right by most of the
[1:16:58] church world the other angle or the
[1:17:00] other subject that I want to present to
[1:17:03] you is that the Prophet a man brother
[1:17:07] William Branham was also the anointed
[1:17:10] word for his day and I can also use the
[1:17:13] word Messiah because that means Anointed
[1:17:15] One praise the Lord
[1:17:17] amen so he was the he was the Anointed
[1:17:20] One or he would be the Messiah Anointed
[1:17:22] One for his day right but yet he was not
[1:17:25] recognize now that's that's that's the
[1:17:27] third I mean that's the second subject
[1:17:29] but the third subject a man is I want to
[1:17:33] try to bring out to you today that a man
[1:17:35] there is another Messiah or anointed
[1:17:39] ones or Messiah if I can put it that way
[1:17:43] there on the earth today that was
[1:17:46] shipping under the revelation sent by
[1:17:48] Christ through his prophet for the day
[1:17:51] and they're not recognize a man so the
[1:17:54] question is who is this a man who is
[1:17:58] this when we talk about Christ who is
[1:18:00] just we're talking about his prophet who
[1:18:02] is this when we talk about his Brides
[1:18:04] Lorre to God all right so stay with me
[1:18:08] here today I want to start with a quote
[1:18:10] out of the 70th week of Daniel Amen the
[1:18:13] 70th week of Daniel the prophet gives us
[1:18:17] something here a man says now Gentiles
[1:18:20] was not a lot at any certain time a man
[1:18:25] G just just that time of the Gentiles
[1:18:27] and we find out even Jesus didn't like
[1:18:30] them a time but we find out here in Luke
[1:18:33] 21:24 he said they shall trot down the
[1:18:36] walls of Jerusalem until the the gym
[1:18:39] sock let me quote that said I'm quoting
[1:18:40] it just by memory let me read it because
[1:18:42] it'll be on tape here and we want to be
[1:18:45] sure to get it right all right if you
[1:18:46] want to turn with me to it on st. Luke
[1:18:48] 21 and verse 24 I studied this clearly
[1:18:52] as best I could said and they shall fall
[1:18:54] by the edge of the sword and shall be
[1:18:57] led away who's he talking about Jews
[1:19:00] that's the destruction of the temple in
[1:19:02] AD 70 and they shall be led away captive
[1:19:05] into all nations now remember not just
[1:19:08] down in Babylon not just over in Rome
[1:19:11] but to all nations that's where the Jew
[1:19:14] is today all nations and Jerusalem shall
[1:19:16] be trodden down of the Gentiles until
[1:19:19] the time of the Gentiles be fulfilled
[1:19:21] now while I was there in in Israel you
[1:19:26] can see that Mosque of you know Omar I
[1:19:29] believe they call it that's that they're
[1:19:31] the Dome of the rock I mean they they
[1:19:33] have this built there and where where
[1:19:35] where they have this built is the same
[1:19:37] place where Solomon's Temple was built
[1:19:38] right so here you know this scriptures
[1:19:41] actually been fulfilled because here the
[1:19:43] Jews are supposed to have that God gave
[1:19:45] them that but because they were taking
[1:19:47] out a land for their unbelief and all
[1:19:49] the other things that they did God has
[1:19:51] allowed this scripture do you feel that
[1:19:53] it would stand there if this until I
[1:19:55] mean it was standing until the time of
[1:19:56] the Gentiles people feel but God didn't
[1:19:58] tell us exactly when the time of the
[1:20:00] Gentiles were gonna be filled it's just
[1:20:02] supposed to stand until the time of the
[1:20:04] Gentiles be fulfilled now for my
[1:20:05] understanding and I think it could have
[1:20:09] been about 50 years ago or something
[1:20:11] like that but when when the the Jewish
[1:20:14] people went back into Jerusalem they had
[1:20:17] they're gone into Israel but they had
[1:20:19] not gone back into Jerusalem and when
[1:20:21] they went back in Jerusalem to proclaim
[1:20:23] that Jerusalem was their capital this
[1:20:26] was the people of Israel that did this
[1:20:28] when they when they went there the
[1:20:31] Muslim leaders at that time said that
[1:20:34] hey we would like to give you all you
[1:20:36] know this this piece of property here
[1:20:38] with Solomon's Temple well said we'll
[1:20:40] just give it to y'all and the the
[1:20:42] leaders of the Jews at that time said no
[1:20:45] we don't want you to give it to us and
[1:20:46] now many that Israelite people were
[1:20:49] wondering the Jewish people like why did
[1:20:51] I lead us say no to these people they
[1:20:53] were giving us back the land we know
[1:20:55] that we want to rebuild Solomon's Temple
[1:20:57] if we want to do everything for while
[1:20:59] they say no when it was going to be
[1:21:00] given I mean when they say they give it
[1:21:02] to us but they didn't understand that
[1:21:03] God's war had to be fulfilled right I
[1:21:06] mean it had they had to stay there until
[1:21:09] the time of the Gentiles had been
[1:21:11] finished a man when that man said no he
[1:21:14] had no idea he was fulfilling the Word
[1:21:16] of God hallelujah
[1:21:18] right so you know God God allows things
[1:21:21] they men like this to happen and and uh
[1:21:23] as we go brother Branham says in this
[1:21:25] quote said then there is a lot of time
[1:21:28] but nobody knows when it will be it says
[1:21:31] it's a mystery see the Gentiles time but
[1:21:34] Jews and we cannot tell time by what the
[1:21:37] church or whether that's where the
[1:21:39] weather's going weather is going on or
[1:21:41] what it's doing you can't tell by that
[1:21:44] but look at the Jews there's the time
[1:21:48] do you see it God did lock them exactly
[1:21:52] a day in our and time but he never he
[1:21:55] never the Gentile he did the Jew so
[1:21:58] let's watch the Jews then we'll see
[1:22:00] where we're at now the seven weeks was
[1:22:02] 49 years we got it clear now one week is
[1:22:05] one week in seven years one week seven
[1:22:07] years now he says while stood you so now
[1:22:11] we just had something tremendous happen
[1:22:13] amen at the end of last year our
[1:22:15] president decided that he would join
[1:22:19] Israel and stated at Jerusalem as their
[1:22:22] capital not Tel Aviv now now now that
[1:22:25] everybody else has made Tel Aviv their
[1:22:27] capital and one brothers say I haven't
[1:22:29] even found the word Tel Aviv the city
[1:22:31] Tel Aviv in the Bible right so so Tel
[1:22:34] Aviv is not their capital Jerusalem is
[1:22:36] their capital right so well so when the
[1:22:38] president has joined up with them to
[1:22:41] establish that a man that was they said
[1:22:44] a very significant move and it happened
[1:22:47] 50 years which is 50 years as they do
[1:22:50] believe right so it happened 50 I mean
[1:22:53] they they bent the Jews themselves have
[1:22:55] been ins in Jerusalem for 50 years and
[1:22:58] cleaned it by themself they stood alone
[1:23:00] right saying that this is my capital and
[1:23:03] 50 years later the United States is the
[1:23:04] first country that actually joins them
[1:23:07] and says yeah we recognize that that's
[1:23:09] your capital and everybody talking about
[1:23:12] you know how you know we got to watch
[1:23:13] out for terrorism and all these things
[1:23:15] but I'm gonna tell you when if God is
[1:23:17] behind something and God has blessed
[1:23:20] something then I you know if God is
[1:23:23] forced and who can be against us
[1:23:25] hallelujah Amen when you stand on the
[1:23:28] word you gotta worry about nothing else
[1:23:31] hallelujah amen so you know we see these
[1:23:34] things and these are very significant
[1:23:37] signpost force let us know that we're
[1:23:39] getting closer and closer to the second
[1:23:42] coming of the Lord now I'm going to skip
[1:23:44] a man in this in this this message here
[1:23:47] I'm going to go down to paragraph 80 and
[1:23:51] I just actually you know I tell you what
[1:23:53] don't don't worry line up who do you say
[1:23:55] this is for me and it's going to be a
[1:23:57] paragraph 187 just just as a
[1:24:00] a paragraph what paragraph 80 said I'm
[1:24:03] only reading a portion of this brother
[1:24:04] and say now now Jesus Messiah rolled
[1:24:07] into the city of Jerusalem triumph on
[1:24:10] the back of a white mule on Palm Sunday
[1:24:12] April the 2nd 80 30 Jesus rode into
[1:24:15] Jerusalem on Palm Sunday 80 30 now now
[1:24:20] he mentioned 80 13 that quote but a
[1:24:22] couple quotes down you know he also says
[1:24:24] 80 33 in which I believe it was actually
[1:24:26] a t-33 quarter two historical records
[1:24:29] that Jesus went riding in a man on this
[1:24:32] on this donkey a man in on 80 and 80 33
[1:24:36] and now when he took this ride amen and
[1:24:40] proclaim you know they're proclaiming
[1:24:42] that blessed is he that comes in the
[1:24:44] name of the Lord these people had a
[1:24:46] reason for doing that they had they had
[1:24:48] purpose for doing that you know but but
[1:24:50] as he was being proclaimed as a king you
[1:24:53] know here that they're laying out their
[1:24:54] garments and they're taking palm
[1:24:56] branches with Rett which represent
[1:24:58] victory and they're laying that before
[1:25:00] him and he comes riding in yet oh he
[1:25:02] comes riding in on that fulfilling a
[1:25:04] prophecy that was written in Zechariah
[1:25:06] amen I want to just kind of set us up
[1:25:09] here let's try to get that in our mind
[1:25:11] as to what the scene looks like and
[1:25:13] we're going to go here - who do you say
[1:25:15] this is the Prophet tells us some things
[1:25:16] here that we want to just try to catch
[1:25:18] and then says now in our text it was
[1:25:21] near the Feast of the Passover was going
[1:25:24] it was an awful time people were
[1:25:27] sleeping on the outside of the gates
[1:25:29] every Passover did this they was outside
[1:25:33] laying on the ground the ends was all
[1:25:36] full and everything it was the Passover
[1:25:38] there was great expectation in there
[1:25:42] that air was all filled he says he says
[1:25:46] everybody was all charged look he said
[1:25:49] there's three classes of people there
[1:25:51] hallelujah so there was a great
[1:25:54] expectation they know that this strange
[1:25:56] man was coming up to this feast and see
[1:26:00] they expected everybody to be at the
[1:26:02] feast hey man so there was an
[1:26:04] expectation because they knew that Jesus
[1:26:07] was in the land so they were expecting
[1:26:09] him
[1:26:10] to the feast the right says they know
[1:26:12] that this strange man was coming up to
[1:26:14] this feast
[1:26:15] some of them loved him a man they
[1:26:18] believed him
[1:26:20] some of them hated him most of them
[1:26:23] hated him and because one loved him and
[1:26:27] the other hated him the middle man
[1:26:30] didn't know what to do
[1:26:32] glory to God now I want to tell you that
[1:26:35] those three groups exist in every
[1:26:37] situation it man you ask something
[1:26:40] that's gonna be for you hello somebody
[1:26:42] and then you have something that's gonna
[1:26:44] be your gift and you're gonna have
[1:26:46] others that don't know what to do they
[1:26:48] don't know which side to be them they
[1:26:50] can be persuaded by anybody hallelujah
[1:26:54] amen but when it comes to this word
[1:26:57] you better know whose side you leaning
[1:26:59] on glory to God hallelujah amen I gotta
[1:27:04] hear brother Branham say that is human
[1:27:06] nature God has made people to be that
[1:27:09] way with some time to get to situation
[1:27:11] they know exactly where they stand even
[1:27:13] a part or they against it and then some
[1:27:15] time to get your situation they don't
[1:27:17] know which way to go
[1:27:18] human nature is that Oh hallelujah this
[1:27:22] is what was happening here on this day
[1:27:24] Amen said some of them loved him most
[1:27:27] I mean some of them hated him most of
[1:27:29] them hated him and because one loved him
[1:27:31] and the other hated him the middle man
[1:27:32] didn't know what to do see they didn't
[1:27:35] know notice the air was full of
[1:27:36] expectations one thing when he gets up
[1:27:39] there I tell you well column will give
[1:27:41] him a word test will stand them up there
[1:27:44] by the high priest would see what his
[1:27:45] wisdom is against Caiaphas he had
[1:27:48] already proven that see prove that see
[1:27:50] but we'll do this well I said now I know
[1:27:53] that some of the great leaders would
[1:27:55] take a hold of him boy they'll turn that
[1:27:57] old guy inside out see they were looking
[1:27:59] for Jesus to try to you know try to
[1:28:01] maybe maybe show the people that there
[1:28:04] was nothing to him said they'll let him
[1:28:05] know what he was when they go to puling
[1:28:08] with our priest boy they know what
[1:28:11] they're doing they're smart man they
[1:28:13] know what they're doing so that means
[1:28:15] the priests were preparing for Jesus to
[1:28:16] come oh my god
[1:28:18] they were actually I mean you got people
[1:28:20] preparing for Jesus the priests
[1:28:22] preparing for Jesus
[1:28:23] you say other said I wonder what they
[1:28:26] will do with that guy anyhow other said
[1:28:29] oh I'm waiting for him to come God is
[1:28:31] with him he is that word oh I just want
[1:28:34] to see him see oh they were divided now
[1:28:37] see the ones that didn't know him and
[1:28:39] believed him they would have no what
[1:28:41] gate to wait it my god the ones that did
[1:28:45] know him and believed him they would
[1:28:46] have known what gate took to way that
[1:28:48] see they know which away he was coming
[1:28:51] there's great expectation but you know
[1:28:54] there wasn't too many saw him see
[1:28:56] there's many didn't see him
[1:28:58] so is it today now let me go on a little
[1:29:01] further he says here some of them say
[1:29:02] he's a good man oh there's nothing wrong
[1:29:05] with him like Napoleon Washington he was
[1:29:07] a good man but oh uh as a teacher no no
[1:29:10] no some of them said oh he's a good man
[1:29:12] oh he's just all mixed up that's all
[1:29:14] he's a good fellow nobody can say
[1:29:16] nothing bad about him other said he's a
[1:29:18] devil I can tell you that that there
[1:29:21] there mine read and stuff and all this
[1:29:22] stuff
[1:29:23] other stuff that's false prophecy is
[1:29:25] compared to our Creed don't you believe
[1:29:27] such a mental thing is that and the
[1:29:30] other said glory to God is God I'd know
[1:29:34] him and they were waiting now that's
[1:29:37] just the way we stand today but the same
[1:29:40] thing the one anointed for this hour the
[1:29:43] latest in the legacy of searching now
[1:29:46] I'm going to tell you only a prophet
[1:29:48] could actually dig him to a scripture
[1:29:49] like this and pull all these things out
[1:29:51] and put us on the scene so we can see
[1:29:54] you know what we're looking at now there
[1:29:56] was there was these three groups so
[1:29:57] there was one group that waited for him
[1:29:59] and there was that waiting for him they
[1:30:01] began to spread their garments in the
[1:30:03] paths as he's coming you know on the
[1:30:05] back of this animal they're spreading
[1:30:07] their garments in the path there they're
[1:30:09] breaking palm branches in there they're
[1:30:11] strong I just landed in linen and
[1:30:14] especially he can just kind of walking
[1:30:15] treat them like royalty freak them like
[1:30:18] a king these were the ones that were
[1:30:20] waiting for and as they retreated them
[1:30:22] like that they began a yell and scream
[1:30:24] hallelujah
[1:30:25] they were excited and when they saw
[1:30:27] coming they begin to yellow screen
[1:30:29] Hosanna blessed is he that cometh in the
[1:30:32] name of the Lord now you know I was
[1:30:34] enemy
[1:30:35] famous and here they are you know
[1:30:37] screaming it's out but I got I got I'm
[1:30:40] grateful for what they did but I got bad
[1:30:42] news for you
[1:30:43] amen the same group that screaming out
[1:30:45] Hosanna blessed is he that cometh in the
[1:30:48] name of the Lord it's the same group one
[1:30:53] week later
[1:30:54] begin the crowd crucify him
[1:31:00] it's amazing how 10 tell you one
[1:31:06] week later crucify him
[1:31:09] glory to God Church hey man so you know
[1:31:13] sometimes we just don't get caught up in
[1:31:14] people's emotions hey man we want to
[1:31:17] know what's really in your heart that's
[1:31:20] what we're trying to discern what's
[1:31:21] really in your heart because it made you
[1:31:23] a change like that there's something
[1:31:25] don't go your way soon as the word come
[1:31:30] against you Amen you ready to Christmas
[1:31:37] somebody hey man not that mine I mean I
[1:31:41] ain't going to that search no more
[1:31:42] that's how they crucify the word today
[1:31:47] come down your street Amen just receive
[1:31:51] it because God loves you yeah yeah
[1:31:56] Hosanna save us blessed is he that
[1:31:59] cometh in the name of the Lord and now
[1:32:01] now you know John 12 verse 17 through 19
[1:32:05] you know John 12 actually gives us the
[1:32:07] same mom you know tells us about this
[1:32:09] this this story it's actually recorded
[1:32:11] in all four Gospels Amen but I want to
[1:32:14] just kind of pick up John 12 verse 17
[1:32:16] through 19 so you can understand why so
[1:32:18] they were um the expectation look at
[1:32:20] this junk junk 12 verse 17 says the
[1:32:23] people therefore that was with him when
[1:32:26] he called Lazarus out of his grave and
[1:32:28] raised him from the dead their records
[1:32:30] for this cause the people also met him
[1:32:34] for that they heard that he had done
[1:32:36] this miracle amen so because of the
[1:32:39] America that they saw with Lazarus it
[1:32:43] raised their expectations and that's
[1:32:46] where their was hitting their waiters
[1:32:47] I mean if that guy can do that but
[1:32:49] Lazarus what can you do for my loved one
[1:32:51] right I want to be there waiting for
[1:32:54] this man I want to take my clothes and
[1:32:56] lay them in front of my water I want to
[1:32:58] put my man I want to break up a branch
[1:33:00] office and just wave at the person now
[1:33:03] blessed is he who comes in the name of
[1:33:05] the Lord right that's because of what he
[1:33:08] had done this is why the people where
[1:33:10] I'm an expectation waited for but now I
[1:33:12] want you to I want you to look at verse
[1:33:14] 19 here because there's another group
[1:33:16] that didn't want to see them or if they
[1:33:19] saw them they had some things they
[1:33:20] wanted to do with them first nineteen
[1:33:22] says the Pharisees therefore said among
[1:33:24] themselves but CD how ye prevail nothing
[1:33:28] the whole the world is going after him
[1:33:32] they realized that with this great
[1:33:34] commotion they was in church brother
[1:33:36] Branham say you know you can see them
[1:33:37] maybe the Sadducees in one corner the
[1:33:40] Pharisees another and they all
[1:33:42] dressed up and get ready for you know
[1:33:44] Passover and everything ready for the
[1:33:45] service and here outside the church all
[1:33:48] this noise going on this man coming on
[1:33:50] the donkey and there's so much noise at
[1:33:53] the church that the Pharisees got left
[1:33:55] the church when I find to see what's
[1:33:58] going on and that's when they begin to
[1:34:00] ask the question well who is this like
[1:34:02] y'all didn't know you knew who it was
[1:34:08] like you didn't know hallelujah and if
[1:34:12] you didn't know that people had an
[1:34:14] answer for you the people said that the
[1:34:16] multitudes that this is Jesus the
[1:34:19] prophet of Nazareth of Galilee I want
[1:34:24] you to also let's pick up something over
[1:34:26] here in Luke 19 again I say this is
[1:34:29] found in all four Gospels Amen you were
[1:34:32] finding in Luke 19 you'll find it in
[1:34:34] John 12 you finally to Marky 11 we ran
[1:34:36] out of Matthew 21 but this same story is
[1:34:39] told in all four Gospels now let's look
[1:34:41] at these Pharisees and Sadducees there
[1:34:43] they're already getting a little jealous
[1:34:44] because I feel like everybody's going
[1:34:46] after him and I look at look at them and
[1:34:48] when they don't want to hear it they try
[1:34:50] to silence the word now Luke 19 verse 39
[1:34:53] a man who says in some of the Pharisees
[1:34:55] from among the multitude said unto Him
[1:34:59] master
[1:35:00] data cycles they were they were trying
[1:35:02] to get him to quiet the crowd a man get
[1:35:06] the crowd not to say nothing right I
[1:35:09] mean because the people you can just
[1:35:10] imagine the shouting and the resource it
[1:35:13] holds ever blessed it is he that comes
[1:35:16] in the name of the Lord now let say I
[1:35:18] mean if he had done something for you if
[1:35:24] the ant does something for you then no
[1:35:27] piracy or no Santa si would be able to
[1:35:32] stop you from giving him praise
[1:35:36] hallelujah right so I mean some of these
[1:35:39] people they was not gonna be silenced
[1:35:41] they was not gonna be quiet it's a man
[1:35:45] they had a praise on the inside and no
[1:35:48] matter what anybody else said they knew
[1:35:51] what he had done with him and you can
[1:35:55] sit there and be cute if you want to but
[1:35:57] he's done so much for me I can't help
[1:36:00] but sing Hosanna blessed is he who comes
[1:36:04] in the name of the Lord oh lord help me
[1:36:12] Jesus but you know as we as we look more
[1:36:15] at that scripture verse 40 you know
[1:36:17] Callie's telling me telling him he says
[1:36:19] now master rebuked by disciples I know
[1:36:23] you think pretty much saying you can get
[1:36:24] control of the crowd we can't we do
[1:36:26] command telling the hush it's Passover
[1:36:29] but look at what Jesus says and he
[1:36:32] answered and said unto them I tell you
[1:36:34] that if these should hold their peace
[1:36:39] the stones would immediately cry out can
[1:36:43] I say something I don't know
[1:36:50] I tried out for me so I'm here to kill
[1:36:54] him please I'm here to give him go I'm
[1:36:58] here to kill him amen I let the rock
[1:37:06] ride on my bless His name glory to God
[1:37:22] search I tell you what I you know you
[1:37:25] think about this this whole scene and
[1:37:27] what's what's really going on here you
[1:37:30] know I'm in a they're worshiping they're
[1:37:31] praising it's so excited and here that
[1:37:34] the Pharisees that didn't want him there
[1:37:36] the Sadducees now yeah yes they were
[1:37:38] expecting because they were gonna try to
[1:37:40] maybe maybe put on a shame before the
[1:37:42] people right they they were good they
[1:37:44] were good they were gonna try to let
[1:37:46] them know you know who they were right
[1:37:48] but but he had a way of coming in so
[1:37:50] meek so lowly so you know so unexpected
[1:37:53] to them but yet he was fulfilling
[1:37:54] Scripture in the way that he came the
[1:37:57] Pharisees you know over in Matthew 21
[1:38:01] now when they when they come out to
[1:38:02] church right when they come out of the
[1:38:04] church and they they see all the
[1:38:06] multitudes a man I met verse 9 verse 8
[1:38:11] amen and Matthew 21 says and a very
[1:38:14] great multitude spread their garments in
[1:38:17] the way others cut down branches from
[1:38:19] the trees and screwed them in the way
[1:38:21] and the multitudes that went before and
[1:38:24] that followed cried saying Hosanna to
[1:38:27] the son of David blessed is he that
[1:38:29] cometh in the name of the Lord hosanna
[1:38:32] in the highest a man and when he was
[1:38:35] coming to Jerusalem all the city was
[1:38:36] moved saying who is this now you know
[1:38:39] before I go further a man with that I
[1:38:41] was I'm very grateful when I look at
[1:38:45] this and I see a man this saw you know
[1:38:49] that the Bible calls to the animal is
[1:38:51] it's a horse but it's called an ass
[1:38:53] right but it's just a really good not a
[1:38:56] nice horse right and but but here the
[1:38:59] Bible tells us that you should find an
[1:39:01] ass
[1:39:01] and a coat with her right loose them and
[1:39:06] bring them unto me right so so I I want
[1:39:10] both the mother and the son hallelujah
[1:39:14] and notice I've told you at the
[1:39:16] beginning amen
[1:39:17] this was a man that the first ride a man
[1:39:22] bought this coat
[1:39:23] it was the first time somebody was gonna
[1:39:26] sit on the back of this coat now I don't
[1:39:29] know what you know maybe what things the
[1:39:33] mother might have went through her
[1:39:35] pregnancy I don't know a man if she had
[1:39:38] some danger sighs but maybe she's like
[1:39:39] how to bathe with bring forth disco but
[1:39:41] this coke was predestinated this cult
[1:39:45] had a very specific purpose nobody had
[1:39:48] ever written its coke before and Jesus
[1:39:52] had told that it's like was that you
[1:39:54] don't find times you don't find like
[1:39:55] this and they got approached you think I
[1:39:57] ask you what you need wonder will you do
[1:39:59] this for he said just tell him the
[1:40:00] master have need of them or the LORD
[1:40:03] hath need of them
[1:40:04] evidently if he could say this to them
[1:40:07] that the Lord had need of them evidently
[1:40:09] these are people that was waiting to see
[1:40:10] the Lord because they had no problem
[1:40:13] giving up a man both the mother and the
[1:40:15] son and I love this because if a man
[1:40:19] this mother gets the opportunity to
[1:40:23] watch her son carry the King of Kings to
[1:40:29] watch a son carry the Lord of lords I
[1:40:32] began to think to myself I say if God
[1:40:35] can be that concern about a horse
[1:40:40] how much more concerns here about a
[1:40:43] mother that wants to see a child take
[1:40:47] the first ride with the Holy Ghost amen
[1:40:50] [Music]
[1:40:53] how much more concern is Popeye wants to
[1:40:56] see you you see your children take a
[1:40:58] ride
[1:40:59] with the King of Kings with the Lord of
[1:41:01] looks when you bless them with a car you
[1:41:05] ain't gotta worry about them doing
[1:41:06] something not supposed to be doing they
[1:41:09] got the right passengers on the other
[1:41:10] sides they riding with the King of Kings
[1:41:13] in a ride and that's a load of Lords
[1:41:16] because the Holy Ghost is pulling on the
[1:41:18] inside if God is that concerned about an
[1:41:23] animal how much more concern is he about
[1:41:26] you and your children
[1:41:29] hallelujah I'm waiting for them to take
[1:41:31] their hearse ride hey man wait for them
[1:41:34] to get filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:41:36] their first touch glory to God that's
[1:41:41] what we're on the expectation for use
[1:41:43] them the LORD hath need of them all
[1:41:48] right as this great multitude is there
[1:41:51] gathered the Pharisees were in church
[1:41:55] Sadducees in church and they heard all
[1:41:57] the noise and they come out of church
[1:41:58] they begin the hell what is this who and
[1:42:00] and as they as they as they as I see you
[1:42:03] know everything going on they approach
[1:42:06] in Matthew 21 and they say well who is
[1:42:08] this who who is this now the people
[1:42:12] answer the people as I said this is
[1:42:14] Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee
[1:42:16] but but I'd like to step into the scene
[1:42:19] if I could because they're asking a
[1:42:22] question and I feel like somebody ought
[1:42:24] to be bold enough and then to stand up
[1:42:27] and give an answer
[1:42:28] who is this and I'd like to take my
[1:42:31] opportunity to give an answer and then
[1:42:34] you want to know mr. parish dear mr. sad
[1:42:36] you see who is this well my answer is
[1:42:38] that this is the fulfillment of Moses
[1:42:41] prophecy the LORD thy God will raise up
[1:42:44] unto the apartment from the midst of
[1:42:46] thee of thy brother's like unto me and
[1:42:49] unto Him he shall hearken a man to Donna
[1:42:52] 18 verse 18 through 19 says I will raise
[1:42:56] him up a prophet among their brethren
[1:42:58] like unto thee and will put my words in
[1:43:01] his
[1:43:02] mouth and he shall speak them to them
[1:43:04] all that I shall command him and it
[1:43:07] shall come to pass that whosoever will
[1:43:09] not hearken unto my words which is just
[1:43:12] be a morning I will require of him you
[1:43:15] want to know who this is this is the
[1:43:17] fulfillment of Moses of prophecy amen
[1:43:20] Psalms 23 1 you want to know what it is
[1:43:22] I want to give an answer this is David
[1:43:24] Shepherd Davis said the Lord is my
[1:43:27] shepherd and I shall not want I want to
[1:43:30] tell you who it is this is David
[1:43:32] Shepherd amen
[1:43:34] I also want to tell you that this is the
[1:43:36] fulfillment of genesis 3:15 and I will
[1:43:39] put enmity between thee and the woman
[1:43:41] and between thy seed and Holte a woman
[1:43:47] don't care you see a woman carries it
[1:43:50] out how can it be her seed because there
[1:43:53] was only one woman they everything that
[1:43:56] a man to a child not being impregnated
[1:44:00] by man this is the fulfillment of the
[1:44:03] woman see according to Genesis 2:30 if
[1:44:09] you want to know what is this is the RAM
[1:44:12] that was in the bush
[1:44:15] Baberaham I'm in Genesis 22 verse 13 and
[1:44:19] 14 and Abraham lifted up his eyes and
[1:44:22] looked and behold behind him a ram
[1:44:25] caught in a thicket by his horns and
[1:44:28] Abraham went and took the RAM and
[1:44:30] offered him up for a burnt open in the
[1:44:33] stead of his son and Abraham called the
[1:44:36] name of that place she over tyra honey

[1:46:02] assets is because you can't approach the
[1:46:04] king unless the king possess a scepter
[1:46:08] hallelujah if you go into the King's
[1:46:10] presence without imposing the scepter
[1:46:12] that was spelling sure is death
[1:46:15] so before we could approach God we
[1:46:17] needed a scepter and Jesus Christ was
[1:46:20] the center you want to know who he is
[1:46:26] I'll tell you who he is a man he is the
[1:46:30] fourth man that was in the fiery furnace

[1:46:39] the question he's jokes if I know my
[1:46:41] Redeemer liveth and that he shall stand
[1:46:45] at the latter day upon the earth this is
[1:46:47] job's ratima he's the fulfillment of
[1:46:52] Isaiah's prophecy Isaiah 7 and 14 says
[1:46:56] therefore the Lord himself shall give
[1:46:57] you a sign behold a virgin shall
[1:46:59] conceive and bear a son and he should
[1:47:01] and shall call his name Emmanuel Isaiah
[1:47:04] 9:6 says for unto us a child is born
[1:47:06] unto us a son is given and the
[1:47:08] government shall be upon his shoulder
[1:47:10] and his name shall be called wonderful
[1:47:12] I'm the reason I'm here is because what
[1:47:14] he did for Lazarus I mean he's wonderful

[1:47:29] the last thing I want to tell you about
[1:47:31] him a man he was on his ride into

[1:49:02] strange way of this question has a
[1:49:04] strange way of repeating itself because
[1:49:06] a man we can bring it forward to today
[1:49:08] and we can apply this a man to some
[1:49:12] others we want to apply to the Prophet
[1:49:14] one applied also a man to you today if

[1:49:40] yes I'm good I've just got to set this
[1:49:43] up for you then I got to come back to it
[1:49:45] so it says here now watch now here he
[1:49:48] comes riding into the city just exactly
[1:49:51] what the word said he would do zechariah
[1:49:54] 9:9 we just pulled it out that's what
[1:49:56] the word promised that he come
[1:49:58] fulfilling the word and the people's to
[1:50:00] have a question who is this look at it
[1:50:04] it says just exactly
[1:50:07] what the word said he would do riding on
[1:50:10] a little donkey coming into the city
[1:50:12] those who were not looking at the Creed
[1:50:15] not looking at the temple not looking at
[1:50:18] all these other things not looking at
[1:50:20] the priests what they had to say those
[1:50:23] that believed him they were standing
[1:50:25] there with palm in their hand just
[1:50:27] waiting the first move
[1:50:30] you never heard them saying who is who's
[1:50:34] this coming
[1:50:35] oh no they knew who was coming they know
[1:50:39] what the word said see and the other
[1:50:42] class sees him back in the city and then
[1:50:45] when they heard this noise Hosanna to
[1:50:47] the king Hosanna to the king that comes
[1:50:50] in the name of Lord hosanna hosanna and
[1:50:52] all the screaming the priests run out to
[1:50:54] see what this religious commotion was
[1:50:57] about and the people said who is this
[1:50:59] what were they what were they therefore
[1:51:01] friends the religious feasts the very
[1:51:04] God that had them to ordain this feast
[1:51:07] told them that he be there just like
[1:51:09] that and they cry who is it notice this
[1:51:14] time hasn't changed
[1:51:16] people are designed the same way as they
[1:51:22] was then Hebrews 13 and says he's the
[1:51:24] same yesterday today and forever now I'm
[1:51:26] gonna I'm gonna close by saying this
[1:51:27] the question isn't to them anymore they
[1:51:31] asked who it is he says but in 1964 I
[1:51:35] want to say in 2018 the question is who
[1:51:39] do you say it is what's this all about
[1:51:44] have you stopped to search the
[1:51:47] Scriptures oh my god because many of us
[1:51:50] stopped to search Google but have you
[1:51:52] stopped to search scriptures right have
[1:51:57] you stopped to search the scriptures who
[1:51:59] do you think this is is it mental
[1:52:02] telepathy is it is it some wild
[1:52:05] something out of the wilderness down to
[1:52:07] somewhere like they said John was a
[1:52:08] while a man while drowning people in the
[1:52:11] world out there when Isaiah said said he
[1:52:13] be there the forerunner
[1:52:15] Malachi said he would be there just
[1:52:17] exactly them prophecy said this pup will
[1:52:20] rise up here support run it and here he
[1:52:23] was I'm just gonna stop there I gotta
[1:52:25] come back to that quote because as
[1:52:28] brother branham just turned the corner
[1:52:29] now in this in that message you go back
[1:52:32] and listen to it he makes a statement he
[1:52:34] says we are building a man we're not
[1:52:38] building a wall we building a building
[1:52:40] he says and when you're building a
[1:52:42] building he says sometimes a man you
[1:52:44] have to turn a corner and send out now
[1:52:46] anybody you can get anybody off the
[1:52:49] street just to kind of lay brick on top
[1:52:51] of brick on top of brick on top of brick
[1:52:53] you can teach them that little part of
[1:52:55] the trade and they can they can put a
[1:52:56] hole for your no problem he says but
[1:52:59] when it's time to turn a corner you
[1:53:02] don't want just anybody trying to turn a
[1:53:03] corner you want a real brick mason you
[1:53:07] want a man that's a professional at that
[1:53:09] now you turn the corner and that's you
[1:53:11] get the corner turn now they can there's
[1:53:13] a brick on top of brick on top of brick
[1:53:15] but don't put no man that don't know how
[1:53:17] to turn corners then my house would be
[1:53:19] all all messed up my walls will be all
[1:53:21] off still I just had a mess on my hands
[1:53:25] he say say what we're doing is we're
[1:53:28] prepared to a man turn a corner man he
[1:53:30] said all that in this Sunday there's a
[1:53:33] lot of lot of nuggets in this sermon if
[1:53:36] you go back and listen to a lot of
[1:53:37] nuggets in there my god but he said time
[1:53:40] hasn't changed and I hear here he's
[1:53:42] presenting this story a man took you
[1:53:45] know so this church there in Phoenix and
[1:53:49] he's preaching this and this is his last
[1:53:51] sermon before he inches into 19 amen in
[1:53:55] 1965 which was the last year he was on
[1:53:57] the earth his last sermon of 1964 is who
[1:54:00] do you say this is back in Matthew 16
[1:54:08] who do you say that that when Christ
[1:54:10] actual question who do you who the man
[1:54:12] say I am and they say oh you realize you
[1:54:14] probably wanted to promise you the issue
[1:54:15] that you didn't yeah you know that's
[1:54:17] what they had that my head knowledge
[1:54:19] right but but when revelation struck
[1:54:21] come on somebody we're not trying to
[1:54:24] operate off head and I was reading
[1:54:25] revelation
[1:54:27] a man like brother Willis say the devil
[1:54:29] will defeat you with head knowledge but
[1:54:30] with a revelation nobody can ever take
[1:54:33] it from you hey glory to God
[1:54:37] dance can't take it from you family
[1:54:40] can't take it from you nobody can take
[1:54:43] Revelation from you you know no no they
[1:54:48] can't take it because they didn't get it
[1:54:53] hey I love that old song say the world
[1:54:56] in the world
[1:54:57] big world didn't give it and the world
[1:54:59] came take it away amen hallelujah
[1:55:02] hallelujah but say they were that you
[1:55:04] know when you when you look at this
[1:55:06] Jesus acts in that question you know who
[1:55:08] to me Sam Danny turned said now who do
[1:55:10] you say I am
[1:55:11] and when revelations drop that's when
[1:55:13] Peter said thou art the Christ the Son
[1:55:14] of living God say blessed art thou simon
[1:55:16] barjona for flesh and blood have not
[1:55:17] revealed this to you but my father in
[1:55:19] heaven has glory to God so we back at
[1:55:21] this now and we understand who he is
[1:55:25] from a scripture step one we know who
[1:55:27] Christ is but now let's try to take it a
[1:55:28] little further we got to take it further
[1:55:31] y'all stay with me I might go over time
[1:55:34] a little bit to this that's alright okay
[1:55:36] hey man I would go over time just a
[1:55:38] little bit I want to make sure to get
[1:55:39] home glory to God but you you got it you
[1:55:42] got to know who it is and you got the
[1:55:44] search scripture if you ain't picking up
[1:55:49] your Bible to reach you have no idea
[1:55:50] what I'm saying you you have do not you
[1:55:53] just can't go off of what everybody say
[1:55:55] searched scripture listen listen now I
[1:56:01] want to just set this up you said there
[1:56:03] are three classes of people all right
[1:56:06] and he identified these three three
[1:56:07] three classes of people Oh glory in the
[1:56:11] word in the realm of politics you said
[1:56:12] now there's a group that is truly
[1:56:14] supportive of a presidential candidate
[1:56:15] man they stand behind and they want to
[1:56:17] see that guy when they got they'll put
[1:56:19] their money into it they do everything
[1:56:20] they can to make sure that guy wins
[1:56:22] right there's another group that's
[1:56:24] directly against that candidate and
[1:56:26] brother I'll say that group we'll call
[1:56:29] them a renegade right it says then
[1:56:31] there's another group that's in between
[1:56:33] them they don't know what to do they
[1:56:35] don't know whether to be for them or
[1:56:36] against them saying that they don't know
[1:56:38] what to do and since they don't know
[1:56:39] what to do they won't go out and vote
[1:56:40] form they won't vote eclairs I mean I
[1:56:42] guess I'm not voting for me exit vote
[1:56:44] against them but you don't know who to
[1:56:45] choose so you just choose anybody
[1:56:48] knowing
[1:56:49] I mean people right in Mickey Mouse on
[1:56:51] the ballot right because they don't know
[1:56:54] who to choose you know they they put
[1:56:57] Superman right I mean they write
[1:56:59] anything on the ballot but but this is
[1:57:01] what happened they get they get caught
[1:57:02] in between now now here's the tears of
[1:57:05] Davis Park the ones that get caught in
[1:57:07] between are the ones that can rip them
[1:57:08] they're dangerous territory oh man you
[1:57:12] got to stand for something it'll be all
[1:57:14] stand for something you'll fall for
[1:57:15] anything all right
[1:57:18] a man sir Provenza that's the way human
[1:57:19] beings are and it had to be that way in
[1:57:22] that day in order to fulfill God's great
[1:57:25] economy that is three he used three
[1:57:27] three classes that's tight the scripture
[1:57:29] to believe it I don't believe in the
[1:57:30] make-believe
[1:57:30] he said Adam was a believer he knew to
[1:57:33] stay with that worked right Adam with
[1:57:36] Adam's sin he willfully went out of
[1:57:38] stand but Adam knew to stay with that
[1:57:40] word he says Satan was an unbeliever
[1:57:43] that's why I began to reason with the
[1:57:45] Word of God he said but but but actually
[1:57:48] he lied he was preaching lies to Eve and
[1:57:51] say Eve was the one that was in between
[1:57:53] she was not sure and he said Eve typed
[1:57:57] the denomination of church up today
[1:57:58] because she turned to the surely you
[1:58:02] will not surely die Adam knew Steve you
[1:58:06] better stay away from there chicas God
[1:58:07] said you gonna die right but she said no
[1:58:09] he said we won't surely die and say she
[1:58:12] turned towards the shulie she was the
[1:58:14] one that was in between oh you got if
[1:58:17] you have no where you stand on that
[1:58:19] today now I want to go on a little curvy
[1:58:22] see he had made a statement here in
[1:58:24] Moses day they have these three groups
[1:58:26] it says Moses Joshua and Caleb were the
[1:58:29] believers of that day he says but Satan
[1:58:32] anointed Dayton and Korah and they
[1:58:34] represented the unbelievers of that day
[1:58:37] and their unbelief caused many to perish
[1:58:41] in the wilderness right they were caught
[1:58:43] in between alright so so is this so so
[1:58:47] close that gap underneath the anointing
[1:58:49] of date to the quorum in the dine
[1:58:51] lose their lives now stay with me say
[1:58:54] now
[1:58:54] he said that now there should be three
[1:58:56] so I'm gonna give you a third we say
[1:58:57] Balaam represented the denominational
[1:59:00] make believer oh my because Balaam what
[1:59:04] he did a man he walked right across the
[1:59:07] perfect will of God
[1:59:09] Balaam and then walked over every
[1:59:12] warning that God gave him Balaam was a
[1:59:16] money loving false prophets it says and
[1:59:20] the more Balaam crushed him the more God
[1:59:22] blessed them so you had those three
[1:59:25] groups but when he looked at Moses
[1:59:27] Joshua and Caleb has to believe us he
[1:59:31] said something else about Moses in this
[1:59:33] message said Moses was the anointed word
[1:59:35] for his day making him the Messiah for
[1:59:40] his day he was the messenger of the hour
[1:59:43] thus making him the Messiah of the hour
[1:59:47] Moses was now you got to stay with me
[1:59:50] cuz you know here here they missed
[1:59:52] they missed Jesus they misunderstanding
[1:59:55] Moses a man at just everyone that he
[1:59:57] said nor was also the anointed word for
[1:59:59] his day the Messiah for his day The
[2:00:01] Anointed One and saying every day God
[2:00:03] always got a messiah on the earth and
[2:00:06] that's why I'm telling saying when
[2:00:08] brother Branham was here he was the
[2:00:10] anointed word for his day so unless
[2:00:15] everyone who was brother Branham I'm
[2:00:17] gonna tell you he's the fulfillment of
[2:00:20] Malachi 4 5 and 6 the whole I was send
[2:00:24] you Elijah the Prophet before the coming
[2:00:27] of the Great and dreadful day of the
[2:00:28] Lord I'm not telling you what Google
[2:00:30] said I'm telling you what the Bible
[2:00:32] saying a matter he shall turn the heart
[2:00:34] of the father's to the children and a
[2:00:36] hard to chew them to their fathers lest
[2:00:38] I come and smite the earth with a curse
[2:00:40] whose brother branham he is the
[2:00:42] fulfillment of revelation 3:14 and after
[2:00:46] their angel the Church of the latest
[2:00:48] years write these things that the Amen
[2:00:50] the faithful and the true witness the
[2:00:52] beginning of a
[2:00:53] of God who is pehla pehla he's the
[2:00:56] fulfillment of Revelation 10 and 7 but
[2:00:59] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[2:01:02] angel when he shall begin to sound for
[2:01:04] mr. God should be finished as he hath
[2:01:07] declared for his servants the prophets
[2:01:09] who is brother Branham he's the
[2:01:11] fulfillment of Revelation 18 and though
[2:01:13] and I heard another voice from heaven
[2:01:15] saying come out of her my people that
[2:01:18] you be not partakers of her sins that
[2:01:21] you receive not of her plagues
[2:01:23] whose brother Branham he's the
[2:01:26] fulfillment of Jesus prophecy in Matthew
[2:01:28] 17 verse 10 through 13 and if seven
[2:01:33] disciples acts up saying why then say
[2:01:35] the scribes that Elias must first come
[2:01:37] verse 11 and Jesus answered this is one
[2:01:45] that Jesus spoke about jesus answered
[2:01:48] and said unto them Elias
[2:01:50] truly shall first come and restore all
[2:01:52] things who is brother Branham he's the
[2:01:55] one that Jesus was talking about that
[2:01:57] was supposed to come and restore all
[2:01:58] things
[2:01:59] oh all right let me go on to who do you
[2:02:05] say this is I'm not done yet I gave you
[2:02:10] now if you notice I gave you about nine
[2:02:13] scriptures for Jesus I gave you five
[2:02:15] scriptures for brother Branham and I'm
[2:02:17] gonna give you some quotes and
[2:02:18] scriptures for yourself
[2:02:24] who you say this is paragraph 70 stay
[2:02:26] with me stay with me Laurie to God the
[2:02:32] church seen him in his great power of
[2:02:33] manifesting manifesting what not
[2:02:35] manifest my Creed he was manifested in
[2:02:37] the word he was the anointed Word
[2:02:39] himself and when they seen that taken
[2:02:42] place the manifestation he anoints at
[2:02:44] Messiah they turned it down they didn't
[2:02:47] want it it wasn't in their taste
[2:02:50] that's the pitiful part I mean just
[2:02:53] think of it just as another days see
[2:02:54] each had their own interpretation of the
[2:02:57] word the the reason Israel didn't
[2:03:00] recognize Moses that Moses I mean that's
[2:03:03] the reason that the world didn't
[2:03:04] recognize Noah the reason all the
[2:03:06] prophets wasn't recognized they had
[2:03:07] their own interpretation of the word but
[2:03:10] God in every age has had his Messiah to
[2:03:14] reject Noah's message was to reject God
[2:03:23] gonna heaven rejecting the message
[2:03:26] you've gone in a rapture rejecting the
[2:03:29] message who was in the boat the ones
[2:03:33] that accepted it and the ones that
[2:03:35] didn't accept it dry all right church
[2:03:40] you want to know who this is I'm trying
[2:03:42] to tell you about scripture all right to
[2:03:44] reject Noah was the practice to perish
[2:03:47] to reject Moses was to perish they were
[2:03:50] The Anointed Messiah for that age the
[2:03:54] word that was promised for that age and
[2:03:57] when Jesus came he was the fullness of
[2:04:00] the word God Himself made into a man
[2:04:04] structure with bones and flesh the
[2:04:06] Anointed One these are key statements
[2:04:09] God Himself made into a man structure
[2:04:14] with bones and flesh now I'm not leaving
[2:04:16] it just with Jesus I'm not leaving it
[2:04:19] just for the Prophet I'm trying to put
[2:04:20] it in you God Himself made into a man a
[2:04:25] woman structure with bones and flesh I'm
[2:04:28] just not looking at this brother soaring
[2:04:30] soaring sister sword so can I be honest
[2:04:33] I'm look
[2:04:33] my god I see you I see them although I'm
[2:04:40] looking at God each one you're caring
[2:04:42] the part of God you make up the body of
[2:04:46] Christ somebody and the only part of the
[2:04:52] body is just as important as the other
[2:04:55] part who is this this is God in flesh
[2:05:06] God Himself made into a man structure
[2:05:09] with bones and flesh The Anointed One
[2:05:13] and they should have seen that but see
[2:05:15] their church their church world had
[2:05:18] added I have so added to here and taken
[2:05:20] away here and so forth until it was so
[2:05:22] messed up till they've trusted in the
[2:05:24] church - instead of the word didn't that
[2:05:25] brother just tell us that on Friday
[2:05:27] night my brother started asking some
[2:05:29] questions about baptism and everything
[2:05:31] said man I'm glad you brought up he's
[2:05:32] and start talking to them back why
[2:05:34] people baptize the name of Father Son
[2:05:36] Holy Ghost ain't nobody ever and about
[2:05:37] Bobby and Beth have said when you say
[2:05:39] well you say well you you you show me in
[2:05:42] the Bible some other baptize all the way
[2:05:43] okay I got many scriptures you wrote
[2:05:45] them all down said man look at Rick look
[2:05:46] at this man went home and ready ready
[2:05:48] yeah the Bible say that the Bible said
[2:05:50] but after he finished reading he went to
[2:05:52] this priest ice preachers pastor say
[2:05:54] pastor what you think about this to say
[2:05:56] now we have no record
[2:05:57] we have no record recorded record of
[2:06:00] this of any of these things we don't
[2:06:02] know of that and say so sister preacher
[2:06:05] stand that they had no record of it the
[2:06:07] man took what the preacher said when he
[2:06:10] already read it in the Bible
[2:06:12] you got no record the Bible said it
[2:06:14] that's your record because it's in the
[2:06:18] bar but that's your record when you ask
[2:06:21] who is this I'm giving you scripture
[2:06:24] that settles it when you stand
[2:06:26] inscription oh it's good settlement all
[2:06:31] right let me go in a little further
[2:06:33] Thank You Lord and man the world has so
[2:06:37] added here taken away here and so forth
[2:06:39] it was dumb till it was so messed up
[2:06:40] do they trust in their church instead of
[2:06:42] the word and when they've seen their
[2:06:44] church I'm anointed then they thought
[2:06:46] something great was taking place now
[2:06:48] this is that's that imma just I gotta
[2:06:50] say this be careful when you're just
[2:06:54] looking at anointest don't don't stop at
[2:06:58] that Moses was anointed and he struck a
[2:07:01] rock twice and water came out but he was
[2:07:04] still wrong
[2:07:05] and he missed the promised land with an
[2:07:08] anointing because you got I mean you
[2:07:11] know I know people nowadays you know
[2:07:12] they they feel like they can go to a
[2:07:14] denominational Church and and and the
[2:07:16] service would be anointed and they'll
[2:07:18] feel the power of God and said man God
[2:07:20] is in that place and they go running
[2:07:22] right back up in there over and over
[2:07:24] again thinking that there's an anointing
[2:07:25] there but the Norton is the word
[2:07:29] hallelujah and if you can't give them
[2:07:31] the word and they say amen to the word
[2:07:34] Amen it just sounded brass until
[2:07:37] assembles amen glory to God when we go
[2:07:40] into places like that we got purpose we
[2:07:45] not saying avoid them but you got to
[2:07:47] know what you doing the man when you go
[2:07:51] on you light in darkness and somebody's
[2:07:53] probably like now that's something
[2:07:55] different about that person there
[2:07:56] I want what church they go tell one of
[2:07:58] us I mean you did you just plant the
[2:07:59] seed but but if you got is I know I'm
[2:08:02] going here because I'm really getting
[2:08:04] something getting what all right name is
[2:08:08] feel all right says something great was
[2:08:12] taking place but when they seen the word
[2:08:14] I'm knowing it then they said that's
[2:08:16] fanaticism this man is a devil but
[2:08:18] Beelzebub because it was so contrary to
[2:08:21] the church until their church crease and
[2:08:23] what they had done and it was that way
[2:08:26] in every coming of a prophet the church
[2:08:28] would be so messed up now let me let me
[2:08:32] just give you a couple couple comments
[2:08:34] here and then I got it I got I'm a read
[2:08:37] a couple
[2:08:37] here I want God's provide a place of
[2:08:40] worship and then later see in church aid
[2:08:42] y'all y'all got a few more minutes to
[2:08:44] stay with me on this a couple comments
[2:08:47] here and this was staying in this
[2:08:50] message who do you say this is but I'm
[2:08:53] just I can't read the whole quote so I'm
[2:08:54] just giving you some snippets many have
[2:08:57] the word but they won't accept the
[2:09:00] anointed word for their day many have
[2:09:07] the word they have the Bible maybe
[2:09:10] yesterday we all read not a KJV but
[2:09:14] being able to accept the anointed Word
[2:09:16] or the word that is promised for your
[2:09:18] day recognizing your message and is
[2:09:21] saying that's a different story
[2:09:25] see Peter wanted to build three
[2:09:29] Tabernacles after seeing Moses Elijah
[2:09:31] and Jesus but gospel from heaven this is
[2:09:34] my beloved son he him who is this he was
[2:09:37] the anointed word for that day Jesus was
[2:09:41] the anointed word for that day so don't
[2:09:42] I mean no number say yeah we thank God
[2:09:44] for moseley Elijah but no here's him
[2:09:46] God was identifying hear him alright and
[2:09:50] brother Branham said this the proper to
[2:09:52] this day and this is a statement the
[2:09:54] prophet of this day is the anointed word
[2:09:57] of the hour the prophet of this day is
[2:10:02] that knowing it word about now if you
[2:10:03] understand the word then you understand
[2:10:05] who the property now even have to say
[2:10:09] anything else but the prophet of this
[2:10:11] day is that knowing it word I just gave
[2:10:12] you scripture and you look to see who
[2:10:15] fulfil that scripture that's why you
[2:10:16] know this is the first question come to
[2:10:18] me you telling me you know brother
[2:10:20] Branham not the prophet you have to tell
[2:10:22] me who is the prophet you have to you
[2:10:25] can't give me well God and use the
[2:10:27] prophets no more what that's not that
[2:10:30] don't make no sense and then you go to a
[2:10:32] church and somebody prophesy to you
[2:10:36] about you getting a blessing and you
[2:10:38] come tell me oh you know they told I get
[2:10:40] a blessed I'm looking but I thought you
[2:10:42] said God one using prophets let alone
[2:10:47] but if you want to believe that can
[2:10:50] somebody tell you're gonna get a million
[2:10:51] dollars well somebody else just still
[2:10:54] you're gonna miss a rapture if people
[2:11:02] want to believe what they want to
[2:11:03] believe but it don't change the Word of
[2:11:05] God it's still there they've answered my
[2:11:09] first click you tell me who fulfill
[2:11:10] these things then you can't you can't
[2:11:12] you just can't give me just any kind of
[2:11:14] answer and think I'm gonna take that you
[2:11:16] know people say I'm turning back to the
[2:11:17] Bible always been on the Bible that's
[2:11:19] why I believe it this way it just can't
[2:11:22] come give me anything glory to God amen
[2:11:26] glory to God you just ain't gonna work
[2:11:28] with me
[2:11:29] I'm sorry amen amen amen
[2:11:32] glory to God all right listen I'm trying
[2:11:34] to go on say the prophet of this day is
[2:11:37] the anointed word of the hour because
[2:11:40] I'm say this the Holy Ghost in you will
[2:11:43] punctuate that word every word amen amen
[2:11:47] amen when the word says anything you say
[2:11:51] that's the truth ain't it because you're
[2:11:53] agreed with the word you agree with God
[2:11:56] you and God are one when you agree with
[2:11:59] the words and you agree with God you and
[2:12:02] God are one God is in you you're his son
[2:12:06] or his daughter I'm going on gives he
[2:12:08] said it makes this thing that makes you
[2:12:11] a messiah for him when you agree with
[2:12:15] the word you become Messiah makes you a
[2:12:20] messiah for him the anointed word living
[2:12:23] out in you they'll never see it see but
[2:12:29] what a privilege it is for us who
[2:12:30] believe to walk in the presence of God
[2:12:32] every day he says this give me a church
[2:12:36] that's so completely anoint it with God
[2:12:38] till their every action and move is thus
[2:12:41] saith the Lord walk in the Shekinah
[2:12:43] glory I'll show you a messiah he said
[2:12:46] when you give me a church that stood
[2:12:48] completed anointed with God so every
[2:12:49] action and move is dust at the Lord walk
[2:12:51] in the Shekinah glory I'll show you a
[2:12:53] Messiah Anointed One of God standing up
[2:12:56] from the earth
[2:12:58] looking at God here I'm looking at God
[2:13:01] and let me tell you I need your parts
[2:13:04] the body is not complete when you miss
[2:13:06] it and I mean another thing and when one
[2:13:10] part of the body hurt the rest of the
[2:13:12] body hurt when I was walking I brought
[2:13:15] my luggage back this week and put it in
[2:13:17] the rooms and you know I'm good I'm just
[2:13:19] happy to be home is late at night I'm
[2:13:21] just putting this luggage here in the
[2:13:22] room and praise what I'm going on the
[2:13:24] vent and I went on the bed and left that
[2:13:26] luggage there and and I had to get up in
[2:13:29] the middle of the night and take a
[2:13:32] little visit and I was coming back with
[2:13:35] them like sides and lo and behold trying
[2:13:40] to feel my way through you know I don't
[2:13:42] want to turn on the light I'm just
[2:13:43] trying to throw my way through and guess
[2:13:45] what happened whew that luggage I forgot
[2:13:51] it was there my toe found out it was
[2:13:54] there and when my toasts are hurting the
[2:13:57] rest of the body was hurt
[2:14:06] it makes another statement here the
[2:14:08] evidence of the Holy Ghost is believing
[2:14:11] his word
[2:14:12] always been in every age if you can
[2:14:15] receive the word that's the evidence of
[2:14:21] the Holy Ghost
[2:14:23] all right I told y'all there's a lot in
[2:14:25] that sermon so you might want to go back
[2:14:27] and listen to it alright y'all just bear
[2:14:31] with me just a few minutes I promise I'm
[2:14:33] coming I'm coming home soon soon I want
[2:14:36] to read these quotes I got to drop this
[2:14:37] in here for you this one is out of God's
[2:14:39] provided place of worship then I want to
[2:14:41] read legacy in church age and then maybe
[2:14:43] I finished somewhere all right it says
[2:14:46] now we found that at each age when God
[2:14:49] said a certain thing would happen here
[2:14:53] come that man alone in Manifesta so if
[2:14:55] God promised malachi forward if God
[2:14:57] promised revelation 3 God promised
[2:15:00] revelation 10 7 God promised revelation
[2:15:02] 18 God promised Matthew 17 if God
[2:15:05] promised all these things here comes
[2:15:07] that man alone that's what it says here
[2:15:11] comes that man alone and manifests it
[2:15:14] that then it said here comes their
[2:15:16] people alone and live that so guess who
[2:15:20] you are you're the people that's come
[2:15:22] along and got predestinated you to be
[2:15:25] here just like ypres destinated that
[2:15:27] foal to be there he predestinated you to
[2:15:31] be here hey that phone took his first
[2:15:35] ride and now know if he ever took it him
[2:15:37] a ride I said it but I can guarantee
[2:15:39] that first there was no ride like that
[2:15:41] first ride Oh glory to God a man listen
[2:15:46] we're riding on this truth and we think
[2:15:49] that for says there come there here come
[2:15:52] the people long and live that that was
[2:15:54] God Himself living in the people because
[2:15:57] it was an answering of his word now
[2:16:00] God's only provided way and only
[2:16:03] provided for plan today is his son
[2:16:05] through his word for this age quickened
[2:16:06] by the spirit of his life quicken now
[2:16:08] let me go on to later see in churches
[2:16:10] I'm just trying to get you to see you
[2:16:11] are people that come along you don't
[2:16:13] know nothin
[2:16:14] message but God God God and this God has
[2:16:19] written being so rich and mercy brunchy
[2:16:21] from out of everywhere all walks of life
[2:16:24] to bring you to this Living Word and
[2:16:26] it's the only thing that can keep you
[2:16:29] it's the only thing that got a hook in
[2:16:32] it even when you run it anybody tried to
[2:16:36] run from comets if you get the run in
[2:16:40] that hook just get you and you know you
[2:16:42] know how when you fill that hook this
[2:16:44] turn when you run into one of the Saints
[2:16:47] you you be out somewhere and just doing
[2:16:53] your thing and then Here Come on the
[2:16:55] Saints they God bless you that hook go
[2:16:58] to turn in it is God's love you can't
[2:17:04] get away from this a man this is our
[2:17:07] latest in church age I'm trying to help
[2:17:09] you see who you are now okay momentary
[2:17:12] consideration of church history will
[2:17:14] prove how accurate this thought is in
[2:17:16] the Dark Ages the word almost was almost
[2:17:18] lost and tire was almost entirely loves
[2:17:20] to the people but God said Luther with
[2:17:22] the word the Luther spoke for God at
[2:17:24] that time that they organized and again
[2:17:26] the pure word was lost for organization
[2:17:28] tends towards Dogma increase and not
[2:17:30] simple word they could no longer speak
[2:17:32] for God then God sent Wesley and he was
[2:17:34] the voice with the word in his day the
[2:17:37] people who took his revelation from God
[2:17:40] became the living epistles read and
[2:17:43] known of our men for their generation
[2:17:45] this is when the Methodists fail God
[2:17:48] raised up others and so it has gone on
[2:17:50] through the years until in this last
[2:17:52] thing there is again another people in
[2:17:57] the land move under their messenger will
[2:18:01] be the final voice to the final age of
[2:18:05] 340 - - just like that in 340 - 2 says
[2:18:09] they will be the platypus to the fire
[2:18:11] age yes sir
[2:18:12] the church is no longer the mouthpiece
[2:18:14] of God it is it's all mouthpiece so God
[2:18:16] is turning on her
[2:18:18] he will confound her through the Prophet
[2:18:19] and the bride for the voice of God will
[2:18:23] be in her yes it is for it stands little
[2:18:28] as chapter of Revelation verse 17 the
[2:18:31] spirit and the bride say come once more
[2:18:35] will the world hear direct from God as
[2:18:37] at Pentecost but of course that one part
[2:18:40] will be repudiated as in the first age
[2:18:42] so that's what my question is who is
[2:18:46] this who is this bride who is this bride
[2:18:50] right and and I believe Scripture and
[2:18:53] quotes will help us understand who she
[2:18:56] is can I just read that for you
[2:18:58] revelation 19:7 says let us be glad and
[2:19:01] rejoice and give honor unto him for the
[2:19:04] marriage of the lamb has come and his
[2:19:06] wife hath made herself ready when we
[2:19:08] talk about the bride she is the wife of
[2:19:10] the lamb hallelujah amen she is the
[2:19:15] righteousness of God but he hath made
[2:19:19] him a second Corinthians 5:21 but he has
[2:19:22] made him to be sin for us who knew no
[2:19:24] sin that we might be made the
[2:19:26] righteousness of God in him can also say
[2:19:29] this she was for know she was
[2:19:33] predestinated she was called
[2:19:35] she was justified she was glorified
[2:19:39] before she even came here Romans 8 verse
[2:19:44] 29 through 30 for whom he did foreknow
[2:19:47] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[2:19:51] to the image of his son that he might be
[2:19:53] the firstborn among many brothers
[2:19:55] moreover whom he did predestinate give
[2:19:58] me also called and whom he called them
[2:20:00] he also justified and whom he justified
[2:20:02] them he also glorified and I want to
[2:20:05] tell you another scripture that lines up
[2:20:07] right there because she was poured on
[2:20:08] predestined and called justified and
[2:20:10] glorified Jeremiah 1 and 5 I love this
[2:20:14] because it says before I formed thee in
[2:20:17] belly before I formed thee in the belly
[2:20:21] I knew thee and before thou camest forth
[2:20:25] out of the womb I sanctified thee and I
[2:20:29] ordained thee a prophet unto the nations
[2:20:32] God knew Jeremiah before he came to
[2:20:35] earth and if God knew Jeremiah before he
[2:20:37] came
[2:20:38] God knew you before you got here oh my
[2:20:45] hallelujah
[2:20:47] I mean I you know I I got some things on
[2:20:50] that I'll just I'll save a little time
[2:20:52] but one of the statements in the who do
[2:20:56] you say this is he says if you ever was
[2:20:57] if you ever was or ever will be in
[2:21:00] heaven you was in heaven to start if you
[2:21:07] ever was or ever will be in heaven you
[2:21:09] was in heaven to start with you're a
[2:21:11] part of God you were his thought he knew
[2:21:13] your name he knew you he knew who you
[2:21:17] were before there ever was a molecule
[2:21:19] before there was a light before there
[2:21:20] was anything he knew you and your name
[2:21:23] and put it on the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:21:25] before the world was ever formed see you
[2:21:28] were his stone and then you became a
[2:21:30] word and a word as a thought expressed
[2:21:33] there then you are manifested my god I
[2:21:38] love that church I want to tell you who
[2:21:41] else you are you are the purchased of
[2:21:44] his blood
[2:21:49] acts 20 and 28 acts 20:28 says this take
[2:21:54] key therefore unto yourselves and to all
[2:21:56] of the flock over the which the Holy
[2:21:58] Ghost hath made you overseers to feed
[2:22:00] the Church of God which he hath
[2:22:03] purchased with his own blood
[2:22:06] you are the purchased of his blood can I
[2:22:11] tell you another thing about you oh lord
[2:22:13] help me help me help me
[2:22:15] you are the Ministry of the power
[2:22:21] because you're doing the greater works
[2:22:23] of John 14:12 give me questions and
[2:22:28] answers on the seals line it up funny
[2:22:30] I'm just quoting you just I've just
[2:22:32] laying this in you I'm putting this
[2:22:34] thing John 14:12 a liberal I said to me
[2:22:36] that believeth on me the works that I do
[2:22:38] shall he do also and greater works than
[2:22:39] these shall he do because I go unto my
[2:22:40] father now there was a question that a
[2:22:42] question acts Amen and the seals here
[2:22:45] did I write that down ok
[2:22:48] type the same 63-0 3 to 4 em for morning
[2:22:54] and to 33 thank you this is a question
[2:22:58] of his acts in the seals says would the
[2:23:01] Bride of Christ have a ministry before
[2:23:03] the rapture that was a question you say
[2:23:06] sure that's what's going on right now
[2:23:08] see the Bride of Christ certainly it is
[2:23:11] the message of the hour see the Bride of
[2:23:13] Christ sure she consists of apostles
[2:23:16] prophets teachers evangelists and
[2:23:17] pastors is that right that's the Bride
[2:23:19] of Christ sure she's got a ministry
[2:23:21] great ministry is the ministry of the
[2:23:23] hour it'll be so home and we got people
[2:23:27] trying to kick the five fold ministry at
[2:23:28] the church but the Prophet said that the
[2:23:32] five fold ministry is the ministry of
[2:23:35] the hour
[2:23:39] that's part of the Bride of Christ don't
[2:23:42] let them take your ministry
[2:23:46] can I take some more all right here's
[2:23:49] another one you are the beneficiary of
[2:23:53] Calvary's dual atonement Isaiah 53 and
[2:23:58] five says but he was wounded for our
[2:24:02] transgressions he was bruised for our
[2:24:05] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[2:24:08] was upon him and with His stripes we are
[2:24:11] healed so you have a beneficiary of
[2:24:14] Calvary's dual atonement I got one more
[2:24:18] thing to tell you who you are to two
[2:24:21] posts that imma leave it here first
[2:24:24] quotes gonna come out come out of first
[2:24:26] seal and then the last quota be out of
[2:24:31] there visible you you know the Bride of
[2:24:32] Christ listen first seal says this how
[2:24:37] can a man say that the Bride of Christ
[2:24:39] goes into the tribulation I can't
[2:24:42] understand it see she's took away from
[2:24:45] the tribulation if the church has been
[2:24:46] judged and they have judged themselves
[2:24:48] and have accepted the blood how can God
[2:24:51] judge a man that's perfectly totally
[2:24:53] Findus so if you want to know who you
[2:24:56] are you're perfectly totally sinless
[2:25:02] you say there's no such a person every
[2:25:06] born-again believer true believer is
[2:25:10] perfectly absolutely sinless before God
[2:25:16] he's not trusting that his works in the
[2:25:20] blood of Jesus that's his confessions
[2:25:22] dropped into this thing about the blood
[2:25:26] now I forget when sister Sarah son was
[2:25:29] but all these things was time again
[2:25:30] right said the Bible the Bible says so
[2:25:32] he that is born of God does not commit
[2:25:35] sin but he cannot sin how can you make a
[2:25:39] man a sinner when the bleach of the
[2:25:42] blood of Jesus Christ is between him and
[2:25:44] God that was status 10 - there be
[2:25:48] nothing left of it see how can that pure
[2:25:50] blood of Christ ever let us then pass
[2:25:52] there he cannot Jesus that be therefore
[2:25:54] perfect even as your father in heaven is
[2:25:56] perfect how could we even start the
[2:25:58] thought of being perfect Jesus but Jesus
[2:26:00] required it and if Jesus required it
[2:26:02] he's got to make a way for it and he has
[2:26:04] his own blood
[2:26:06] you're the purchase of his own blood I
[2:26:09] got one more for you I just I just want
[2:26:12] you to know who you are and I'm a read
[2:26:14] this but i'ma tell you before I get
[2:26:16] there you are the virtuous sinless
[2:26:20] spotless bride of Jesus Christ you the
[2:26:26] Lambs wife
[2:26:28] it's he the bridegroom took away your
[2:26:33] shame and put it in the sea of
[2:26:36] forgetfulness by the washing of the
[2:26:39] water of the word and the blood of life
[2:26:42] that's what the Bible said your first
[2:26:45] husband that you were married to the
[2:26:47] world the anointed bridegroom which or
[2:26:50] ordained you has washed you by the
[2:26:53] washing of the water by the church no
[2:26:56] that don't sound right does it no you
[2:26:59] might find that in the Almanac but not
[2:27:01] in God's Bible by the washing of the
[2:27:02] water by the word in the word see you
[2:27:05] are standing completely justified oh I
[2:27:10] wish somebody catch a hold of that then
[2:27:14] when you get this the devil won't let
[2:27:16] you came you won't allow the devil to
[2:27:17] keep your head down you're standing now
[2:27:23] let me let me just just pull that now
[2:27:25] let me let me say this and I know that
[2:27:28] we've come in life we make mistakes you
[2:27:31] know we all got things that we'd go
[2:27:32] through we have to constantly X God for
[2:27:35] forgiveness and things of that nature
[2:27:36] but I just want to say if God didn't see
[2:27:42] you the way I'm reading this to you if
[2:27:45] God didn't see that way he would not
[2:27:48] have you in this church to hear these
[2:27:50] things he wouldn't have you here let me
[2:27:55] put it this way God when waste his time
[2:27:59] if he didn't see you already completely
[2:28:02] justified now now the reason I'm going
[2:28:05] here is because you need to see yourself
[2:28:10] you're not some defeated Christian and
[2:28:14] you're gonna stop living like that the
[2:28:17] reason you live like that is because you
[2:28:19] think like that but if we can just get
[2:28:21] this in you
[2:28:23] you stop thinking that way you stop
[2:28:25] living that way you are the
[2:28:27] righteousness of God the purchase of
[2:28:31] this blood perfect sinless spotless
[2:28:36] nothing of the gifts you because the
[2:28:38] blood of Jesus Christ has taken care of
[2:28:40] it if you can ever get a revelation of
[2:28:43] the blood ever get a revelation of blood
[2:28:46] now talk about when it's really under
[2:28:48] the blood I mean you know in this
[2:28:50] innocence sermon the Prophet was talking
[2:28:53] about this man is uh he was man he read
[2:28:56] the Bible and we all need to be like
[2:28:58] this every time he read he'd just get to
[2:29:00] read a little something here and there
[2:29:01] and next thing he just go to jumping and
[2:29:03] shouting praise and gotten brothers
[2:29:05] brother thing I don't know brother

[2:29:49] the sea and in saying the sea was so
[2:29:51] deep that they can't even find the
[2:29:54] bottom of it in some places so when he
[2:29:56] still had a deep the sea was glory oh

[2:31:27] care about you you wouldn't come to this
[2:31:30] church you wouldn't come and I'm
[2:31:34] greeting what a prophet say it but God

[2:33:53] place to notice there's a couple couple

[2:34:13] sanctification and then I'll even tell
[2:34:15] you that that I believe that some had
[2:34:17] been filled with the Holy Ghost in the
[2:34:18] denominational Church and I believe that
[2:34:20] but if it's a true
[2:34:22] ghost it'sa leaves you and guide you
[2:34:25] into all truth if it don't do that it
[2:34:30] ain't all he goes it's a ghost just not

[2:35:18] and praises others were ready to you
[2:35:23] know didn't I mean just really give him
[2:35:25] a run for his money and there was others
[2:35:27] that had no idea what they were looking
[2:35:31] at but nonetheless his word was being
[2:35:33] fulfilled when he came riding through a
[2:35:35] man Jerusalem on the back of that bat
[2:35:38] donkey his word was being fulfilled and
[2:35:41] just as was being fulfilled in that day
[2:35:43] when Jesus did that it was fulfilled in
[2:35:44] this day they meant when he said brother
[2:35:46] Branham brother branham's going now but
[2:35:49] he still got some science on this earth
