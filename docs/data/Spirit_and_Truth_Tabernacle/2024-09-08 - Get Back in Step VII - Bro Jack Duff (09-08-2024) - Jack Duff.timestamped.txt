[49:36] 15 praise the Lord Luke
[49:39] 18 and uh starting at verse
[49:44] 15 amen the Bible declares and they
[49:48] brought unto him also
[49:50] infants that he would
[49:53] touch them but when his disciples saw it
[49:57] they rebuked them but Jesus called them
[50:01] unto him and said suffer little children
[50:04] to come unto me and forbid them not for
[50:08] uh of such as the kingdom of
[50:11] God and verily I say unto you whosoever
[50:14] shall not receive the kingdom of God as
[50:17] a little child shall in no wise enter
[50:21] therein amen and the prophet told us um
[50:25] we dedicate
[50:27] uh we bring them and dedicate them we
[50:29] don't baptize uh uh the babies we wait
[50:33] till they come to an age where they
[50:35] understand uh who Christ is and what
[50:37] Christ did for them in their life uh
[50:40] realizing that we were all born in sin
[50:42] and shaped in iniquity and we all need
[50:45] Christ uh but when we dedicate them amen
[50:49] this is simply an act of just the
[50:52] parents bringing the child back to
[50:53] Christ as he has given the child to them
[50:56] and it's the parents responsibilities to
[50:58] raise that child in a Godly atmosphere
[51:01] that they would come to a a spot in
[51:04] their life where they would recognize
[51:06] that they need God Amen keep them in

[51:38] far in sin they

[51:43] back it just make your testimony greater
[51:46] that's all I don't care what God got to
[51:48] deliver you from it's just going to make
[51:49] your testimony greater and it's going
[51:52] it's going to set somebody else free

[1:02:21] but I knew the Lord had allowed him to
[1:02:23] step right into where I was headed and
[1:02:26] uh and now we want to get into this
[1:02:28] section now I already know that uh the
[1:02:31] material that I have will I cannot
[1:02:33] preach it all in one service amen but I
[1:02:37] I want to uh preach enough to get our
[1:02:40] minds amen thinking about it uh also I
[1:02:44] would love for a man to get the
[1:02:47] conversations in the home talking about
[1:02:50] it amen because when we talk about him
[1:02:53] and when we think about him then he
[1:02:55] begins to draw closer and closer to us
[1:03:01] hallelujah amen but here let me just
[1:03:03] start with a quote out of the
[1:03:04] restoration of the Bride tree uh this
[1:03:06] very first quote there on the list that
[1:03:09] I gave you all says and if four
[1:03:11] messengers of Death kill the tree four
[1:03:15] messengers of Life
[1:03:18] restores the tree amen he says do you
[1:03:21] get it and he says uh amen for God said
[1:03:26] I will restore it now this is important
[1:03:30] I remember when we did the Mion Walker
[1:03:32] service brother Troy was very very uh he
[1:03:35] was he was he was making sure that we
[1:03:37] understood that the restoration is not
[1:03:40] something that any man does this
[1:03:42] restoration is something that God
[1:03:44] himself does amen and and if God is the
[1:03:47] one doing it there is nothing that
[1:03:49] nobody can do to stop it amen nothing
[1:03:53] nobody can do to stop it this is a
[1:03:55] promise from God God it says for God
[1:03:57] said I will restore it he's going to
[1:04:00] restore it how by fourth death
[1:04:03] Messengers killed it then four life
[1:04:05] Messengers will restore it what was the
[1:04:09] first Martin Luther justification what
[1:04:12] was the second uh John Wesley by
[1:04:14] sanctification now remember I told you
[1:04:16] the um the theologians when they when
[1:04:19] they read these scriptures and Joel
[1:04:21] their their uh their uh comments were uh
[1:04:24] we don't really know what this SEC is
[1:04:26] and we don't really know what this
[1:04:27] really means you know it's uncertain
[1:04:29] that's what they were saying but a
[1:04:31] prophet is given us prophetic a man
[1:04:34] definitions here as to what this means
[1:04:36] and I and I've mentioned this before and
[1:04:38] I'll say it again just by you being a
[1:04:40] part of a message church and brother
[1:04:43] brother Simba ask y'all that this
[1:04:44] morning says are you happy to be in
[1:04:47] church he says are you happy to be a
[1:04:49] part of a message church are you happy
[1:04:52] that you believe that God sent you a
[1:04:53] prophet are you happy about these six
[1:04:56] just the mere fact that you are in a
[1:04:58] message Church you are a part of this
[1:05:01] scripture you are a part of the
[1:05:03] restoration you are fulfilling the
[1:05:07] restoration oh Hallelujah you couldn't
[1:05:10] you couldn't separate from it if you
[1:05:12] triy amen because you part of the word
[1:05:15] how can the word deny the
[1:05:18] word it can't happen amen so so so here
[1:05:21] he says by four death messages killed it
[1:05:24] then four life messes will restore what
[1:05:27] was the first Martin Luther
[1:05:29] justification what was the second John
[1:05:32] Wesley by sanctification what was the
[1:05:35] third Pentecost with the restoration of
[1:05:38] the gifts the Holy Ghost baptism of the
[1:05:42] Holy Ghost amen what was the fourth the
[1:05:45] word what the word there uh there were
[1:05:48] four great prophets now I I'm I'm going
[1:05:51] keep reading in this but it's very
[1:05:53] important that we catch what the prophet
[1:05:55] is trying to tell us he he goes on says
[1:05:57] one of them Martin Luther now in in the
[1:06:00] spiritual aspect he's saying uh Martin
[1:06:02] Luther dealt with certain things when he
[1:06:04] brought in justification he start
[1:06:06] preaching that to the church amen and
[1:06:08] then uh he said he says Martin Luther he
[1:06:10] began to shine a light that was the
[1:06:12] light of justification there was a
[1:06:14] little light uh just a very small
[1:06:16] strength of justification he says Alone
[1:06:19] Come Wesley stronger now when when when
[1:06:23] and what what he's saying here because
[1:06:24] Martin Luther even though he preach
[1:06:25] justification Martin Luther was still
[1:06:27] smoking a pipe
[1:06:29] right right he was still smoking a pipe
[1:06:32] even though he preaching justification
[1:06:34] and then there were certain comments
[1:06:35] that Martin Luther made that I mean the
[1:06:37] prophet say he probably should never
[1:06:38] never said things like that right but
[1:06:40] but but it it was it it simply it is
[1:06:42] that Martin Luther was not a prophet
[1:06:45] amen he was a reformer but not a
[1:06:47] restorer oh Hallelujah but he was a part
[1:06:51] of the process yes sir amen and then
[1:06:54] then when when John wesle comes along he
[1:06:56] began to preach not just justification
[1:06:58] but he goes a little further he says
[1:07:00] sanctification now and sanctification
[1:07:02] that mean get rid of your
[1:07:06] pipe huh amen stop smoking oh y'all
[1:07:10] ain't going to preach fin amen you got
[1:07:12] to stop smoking in sanctification you
[1:07:14] got to start living right stop your
[1:07:17] drinking stop your smoking come on
[1:07:19] somebody stop your
[1:07:21] sinning amen a Sanctified life don't do
[1:07:24] that stop your
[1:07:26] lusting hello somebody this is what a
[1:07:29] Sanctified this is even before the Holy
[1:07:31] Ghost come oh my my my the Bible said
[1:07:34] the Bible tells us lay aside every sin
[1:07:36] and every weight that so easily besets
[1:07:39] us some things we just got to give up
[1:07:42] right amen we don't even ask God to take
[1:07:44] them from us we just give them up but
[1:07:47] this is what sanctification did
[1:07:48] sanctification allows us to live a clean
[1:07:51] life before God amen amen amen we we
[1:07:56] talking about that the last time that
[1:07:57] that the woman at the well and Jesus had
[1:07:59] to tell her you know that that that that
[1:08:01] that that that the you know go get your
[1:08:03] husband and come she say I don't have no
[1:08:05] husband yeah the five you've had were
[1:08:08] not yours and the one you living with
[1:08:11] right now it's not yours say what and
[1:08:15] and and rather than her get upset about
[1:08:17] somebody revealing her sin you know she
[1:08:19] say come see a man who told me the
[1:08:21] things that I done she had the right
[1:08:22] attitude she could be delivered because
[1:08:24] she had the right attitude
[1:08:26] God wants to take care of the sin
[1:08:27] problem first before he can actually
[1:08:29] bless us amen you're the b your sometime
[1:08:33] let me just put it way our blessings are
[1:08:36] hindered by sin in our
[1:08:39] life amen and the scripture actually say
[1:08:42] your sin will withhold good things from
[1:08:44] you all right I'm going on but this is
[1:08:48] sanctification amen this is
[1:08:49] sanctification now look at this he says
[1:08:51] there was a little light just a very
[1:08:53] small strength of justification along
[1:08:55] came Wesley stronger
[1:08:57] sanctification oh my God and after
[1:09:00] Wesley come stronger than him
[1:09:03] Pentecostal the baptism of the Holy
[1:09:05] Ghost in another great prophet now this
[1:09:08] is what brother brandham is calling him
[1:09:10] in another great prophet se but in the
[1:09:12] last days of Malachi 4 Elijah is to come
[1:09:16] with the very word the word of the Lord
[1:09:19] came to the prophet in the evening
[1:09:21] lights is to come forth to restore and
[1:09:23] bring back what turn on hearts of the
[1:09:26] children back to the faith of faith of
[1:09:27] God the fourth light now um we'll we'll
[1:09:31] we'll we'll come back to some of that a
[1:09:32] little bit later but um just uh so that
[1:09:36] I I I I hit this earlier and you know
[1:09:38] the four death messages were the Palmer
[1:09:40] worm the Locust the cankerworm the
[1:09:43] caterpillar what the palmerworm did he
[1:09:45] destroyed the brotherly love and the
[1:09:46] fruit amen the Fruit of the Spirit uh
[1:09:49] the Locust ate the leaves of divine
[1:09:51] Fellowship the korm he attacked the
[1:09:53] doctrine amen or the Rel or the covering
[1:09:56] of the church and then the caterpillar
[1:09:58] comes along and sucks the very life it's
[1:10:00] the same insect in four different stages
[1:10:03] now he says for death Messengers which
[1:10:05] is the Palmer worm the Locust the
[1:10:07] cankerworm the caterpillar those are the
[1:10:08] four death Messengers but he said for
[1:10:11] Life Messengers brings amen brings it
[1:10:13] back into the church and the life
[1:10:15] Messengers was Luther Wesley Pentecost
[1:10:19] and then Malachi 4 that's why we thank
[1:10:22] God for a prophet because we have amen
[1:10:24] the fullness of the word now let me just
[1:10:27] make make make it very clear I don't
[1:10:29] think we should be a church with the
[1:10:30] fullness of the word but a church that
[1:10:32] does not have
[1:10:35] justification I don't think we should be
[1:10:37] a church with the fullness of the word
[1:10:39] and a church that does not have
[1:10:41] sanctification can I go a little further
[1:10:44] I don't think we should be a church with
[1:10:46] the fullness of the word and not have
[1:10:48] the restoration of the
[1:10:51] gifts right if we going to have
[1:10:53] justification we going to have s
[1:10:55] ification and we going to have the words
[1:10:56] you can't get there with bypassing the
[1:10:59] gifts sir sir all right all right all
[1:11:01] right not all brother all right this is
[1:11:03] where we had it cuz that the gifts were
[1:11:05] a part of the
[1:11:07] restoration amen we know people got the
[1:11:09] gifts amen uh they were using they were
[1:11:12] they were I mean pretty much out out of
[1:11:14] control with it amen we realize that but
[1:11:17] we not we not leaning on that side amen
[1:11:20] we leaning on the side where God
[1:11:21] promised to restore these things so they
[1:11:23] supposed to be in the church
[1:11:26] all right let me go a little further let
[1:11:27] me read a little bit this morning
[1:11:29] Hallelujah here out of the message the
[1:11:31] unchangeable god working in an
[1:11:34] unexpectable way the unchangeable God
[1:11:37] now in this previous quote brother
[1:11:38] brandom said that the uh he call him
[1:11:41] four prophets they call him four
[1:11:43] prophets Luther now we know Luther was a
[1:11:45] reformer but the word of the Lord came
[1:11:47] to him this is why brother bandam
[1:11:48] calling him a prophet right but but and
[1:11:51] and John Wesley was also a part of
[1:11:53] reformation but the word of the Lord
[1:11:54] came to him that's why call him a
[1:11:55] prophet now this restoration of gifts do
[1:11:57] you realize the man that's responsible
[1:12:01] amen for the zza Street Revival amen
[1:12:03] back there they call that man a prophet
[1:12:06] people called him a prophet William
[1:12:08] Seymour Hallelujah so brother brandham
[1:12:10] called him this oh my there there was a
[1:12:13] certain Revelation came to William
[1:12:14] Seymour and he he held to that let me
[1:12:17] just go a little further let me read
[1:12:19] before I get ahead of myself the
[1:12:20] unchangeable god working in an
[1:12:22] unexpectable way oh my my God watch this
[1:12:26] he says now but when Jesus came we found
[1:12:30] out he was born in a manger so right
[1:12:32] quick the Jews disagree he didn't come
[1:12:35] the way he thought uh they they thought
[1:12:39] he was to come so they just
[1:12:41] excommunicated him from their fellowship
[1:12:43] and he was no more in it but watch what
[1:12:46] he done uh uh he that that didn't stop
[1:12:49] him when Pentecost watch this now when
[1:12:52] Pentecost was first born the church was
[1:12:57] excommunicated and I'm going to give you
[1:12:58] a little history in a little bit that's
[1:13:00] going to tie right into what brother
[1:13:01] Brandon saying here the church was
[1:13:03] excommunicated too that that didn't stop
[1:13:06] the
[1:13:07] message oh my Hallelujah there their
[1:13:11] message was that they believe the gifts
[1:13:13] were supposed to be in the church now
[1:13:15] they focused on the tongues more more
[1:13:17] more than any other gift but they
[1:13:19] believe them gifts were supposed to be
[1:13:20] in the church and even though they got
[1:13:22] kicked out amen it did not stop it
[1:13:25] hallelujah hallelujah and in this
[1:13:27] message we might have been kicked out of
[1:13:29] some things but it did not stop the
[1:13:31] truth from being revealed to
[1:13:33] us and you can't stop God when when God
[1:13:38] is in something there nothing nobody can
[1:13:40] do to stop it that's right amen we may
[1:13:42] be small in number but we're powerful
[1:13:45] amen when it comes to God and little as
[1:13:48] much when God is in it Hallelujah glory
[1:13:52] to God watch it now he says it says when
[1:13:54] Pentecost was first born the church was
[1:13:56] excommunicated too that didn't stop the
[1:13:59] message it goes on just the same Jesus
[1:14:02] can't be stopped my God who can stop God
[1:14:07] you can't do it no you can no more do it
[1:14:10] you you could easy to stop the son but
[1:14:12] you can't stop God his program is going
[1:14:15] to move on oh I like that brother I I
[1:14:18] I'm here to tell you when it comes to
[1:14:20] the gifts of the Spirit God's program is
[1:14:22] going to move on and there's nobody can
[1:14:24] stop stop it amen you can't preach this
[1:14:27] out of the church amen because it's part
[1:14:30] of the
[1:14:31] restoration go on let me go on so it
[1:14:34] come it it so it come when the churches
[1:14:37] back there was praying for a Revival it
[1:14:40] come in an unexpected way he got a bunch
[1:14:43] of some oneeyed colored man over here in
[1:14:47] California and William Seymour is this
[1:14:49] guy that amen that's crosseyed right
[1:14:51] brother random say he he got a bunch of
[1:14:53] one one eyy color man over here here in
[1:14:55] California and a couple of hobos on the
[1:14:57] street and things like that and filled
[1:15:00] them with the Holy Ghost and started a
[1:15:02] fire that look where it's gone to now
[1:15:06] Hallelujah he says it's the fastest
[1:15:09] growing Church in the world my God the
[1:15:12] Pentecostal Church well at that time was
[1:15:15] the fastest growing Church in the world
[1:15:17] they had more converts last year than
[1:15:19] all the rest of them put together yeah
[1:15:21] that's right our Sunday visitor the
[1:15:23] Catholic paper said so they reg
[1:15:25] registered a milion
[1:15:27] 500,000 what God's word sells on and on
[1:15:31] his people will never take down their
[1:15:33] soldiers amen cuz the word of the Living
[1:15:35] God is burning in their hearts that's
[1:15:37] right God is sending them things in
[1:15:39] different places blessing them bringing
[1:15:42] them on now let's keep our keep on our
[1:15:44] mind on the word and on God and keep
[1:15:46] moving on now you know brother Brand's
[1:15:49] just kind of giv us a slight little
[1:15:50] history here of the Pentecostal Church
[1:15:53] 1906 is is when uh a tremendous Revival
[1:15:57] broke out in California the soua Street
[1:15:59] Revival amen a a a mighty mighty Revival
[1:16:04] and and the way that this got started
[1:16:06] this gentleman brother brandom said he
[1:16:08] was uh uh uh C he was crossy he call him
[1:16:11] one out but he was cross out brother
[1:16:13] William Seymour is the name and uh
[1:16:15] William Seymour a man was uh very
[1:16:19] interested in in learning more about the
[1:16:21] gifts he was reading his Bible and this
[1:16:23] just kind of struck him about the gifts
[1:16:25] just being released in the church my God
[1:16:27] it it bothered him that he didn't see
[1:16:30] what he was reading in the Bible oh my
[1:16:33] can I can I just say it it should bother
[1:16:36] us that we don't see what was written in
[1:16:39] the Bible being manifested all the time
[1:16:42] in our midst come on church amen uh I
[1:16:46] mean this should this this should just
[1:16:47] be a normal thing and I I just have to
[1:16:50] be honest I feel like we done preached
[1:16:52] this so far out the church we don't see
[1:16:55] it no more I think I'm going to have to
[1:16:57] go to work too Amen Let me just get
[1:17:00] thank you my brother let me see I yeah I
[1:17:03] just feel like amen we done we done
[1:17:05] preached it so far out and and and let
[1:17:07] me let me just just you know I'm gonna
[1:17:10] I'm going to bring a a number of quotes
[1:17:12] Amen to make sure that we're very clear
[1:17:14] on this because I know that the fourth
[1:17:17] stage of the restoration is the word I
[1:17:21] know that's the fourth stage but we done
[1:17:23] jump to the fourth stage and we don't we
[1:17:25] don't even Hallelujah we don't even talk
[1:17:27] about the first second and third stage
[1:17:29] anymore but each stage was a part of the
[1:17:32] restoration and what we see in the
[1:17:34] fourth state should be all of
[1:17:37] it amen amen but but this man William
[1:17:40] Seymour amen he had a desire to see the
[1:17:43] gifts operating in the church and and
[1:17:46] again I think the thing that they went
[1:17:47] to seed on or the thing that that they
[1:17:49] they they concentrated the most on was
[1:17:51] the gift of tongues that was the gift
[1:17:53] that they concentrated on but there was
[1:17:55] there was eight other gifts and the gift
[1:17:57] of tongues was actually the the the the
[1:18:00] eighth of
[1:18:01] nine Hallelujah glory to God now now
[1:18:04] here William Seymour had this desire to
[1:18:06] see God Amen move in this manner because
[1:18:09] he saw it in the scripture on the day of
[1:18:11] Pentecost he saw these things and uh now
[1:18:14] him being a black man when uh back in
[1:18:16] those times 19 early 1900s there was a
[1:18:19] lot of
[1:18:20] segregation lot of segregation that
[1:18:23] happened amen not only in uh uh not just
[1:18:26] in the world but even in the church the
[1:18:28] prophet could not go to certain places
[1:18:32] amen they go to certain meetings and I
[1:18:34] mean you heard the brother preaching
[1:18:36] about it on on Wednesday night he going
[1:18:38] to Arkansas Hallelujah somebody oh my
[1:18:41] y'all going to make me get out there and
[1:18:43] start saying things I don't want to say
[1:18:45] but it's Spirits in other in in
[1:18:47] States and but but the Holy Ghost in you
[1:18:50] is bigger than that
[1:18:51] spirit all right amen but brother would
[1:18:55] go to Arkansas and they tell him you
[1:18:56] can't go over there and pray for that
[1:18:57] that young lady she she was a a a blind
[1:19:00] young girl she was black and said you

[1:19:03] lines if you go pray for that lady

[1:25:49] preach and he start preaching about
[1:25:51] these gifts and start preaching about
[1:25:53] how he believes that the uh uh you know
[1:25:57] the true filling of the Holy Ghost will
[1:25:58] be accompanied with speaking in tongues
[1:26:00] and he took about two or three services
[1:26:02] and he preached that and you know what
[1:26:03] happened after he preached they rose up
[1:26:05] and said we're going to kick you out
[1:26:06] you're not welcome to preach here no
[1:26:07] more when brother brandom said they got
[1:26:09] excommunicated that's exactly what
[1:26:11] happened he got kicked out of the church
[1:26:13] because of what he was preaching but it
[1:26:15] did not stop this why brother random say
[1:26:17] it you can't stop God just because he
[1:26:20] got kicked out of the church didn't mean
[1:26:21] that it wasn't true
[1:26:25] can I say it in a different way just
[1:26:27] because people are kicking this out of
[1:26:29] the church don't mean that it's not true
[1:26:33] and don't mean that we're not supposed
[1:26:35] to have it amen oh my God here you know
[1:26:40] uh uh William Seymour said you know well
[1:26:42] they don't want us in the church so they

[1:26:47] and and Milkman come by and this one
[1:26:50] come by and that one come by and they
[1:26:52] just praying praying praying and before
[1:26:54] you know it through their prayer
[1:26:56] meetings the Holy Spirit begin to move
[1:26:59] the people begin to speak in tongues and
[1:27:02] I mean and the gifts of the Spirit begin
[1:27:03] to manifest right there amongst it and
[1:27:05] brother brand said come in an unexpected
[1:27:08] way but here God just began to manifest
[1:27:11] himself amongst these people and and and
[1:27:13] it got so big that they had to leave the
[1:27:15] home they had up to 1,500 people coming
[1:27:18] the service every day good God Almighty
[1:27:21] they had three services a day seven days
[1:27:24] a

[1:27:29] didn't want to bring in song books don't
[1:27:32] bring a song book they wanted a fresh
[1:27:34] song to come right there while they were
[1:27:37] in service and God was giving people
[1:27:39] songs like that on the
[1:27:41] spot Hallelujah you talk about a move of
[1:27:45] God and now now now I I know that we in

[1:30:02] needles Florence Crawford said that the
[1:30:05] power of God descended upon me and I
[1:30:08] went down under
[1:30:09] [Music]
[1:30:11] it see back in those days people get
[1:30:13] slain in the spirit y'all I'm just
[1:30:15] talking about Pentecost right now but
[1:30:18] back in those days people come to church
[1:30:19] and you be slain in the spirit you be
[1:30:21] trying to hold yourself together and
[1:30:23] before you know you just out on the
[1:30:25] floor
[1:30:27] somewhere now I used to criticize that
[1:30:30] my God God I'm going be honest I used to
[1:30:32] criticize that and I
[1:30:35] asked a friend of mine and say where is
[1:30:37] that in the Bible where people get SL me
[1:30:40] say Well when Ezekiel got caught a
[1:30:42] vision Hallelujah when Ezekiel Saw a
[1:30:44] vision Ezekiel was slain in the spirit
[1:30:47] John also in the Book of Revelation
[1:30:48] slain in the spirit when he saw a vision
[1:30:51] Hallelujah so when I saw it in the word
[1:30:54] I sto criticizing it amen oh Jesus now
[1:30:58] I'm I'mma just be honest I I I I would
[1:31:01] love for God to come down in this place
[1:31:04] in such a
[1:31:06] way Brother people slain in the
[1:31:09] spirit speaking in tongues and my God
[1:31:13] interpretation of tongues hey I would
[1:31:16] love to see God do that especially under
[1:31:19] the right under right under the right
[1:31:22] inspiration of the word yes sir yes
[1:31:26] sir now I'm not trying to make it happen
[1:31:30] but I am telling you if it does happen
[1:31:32] we ain't going to chase it out of
[1:31:38] here the power God descended upon me and
[1:31:41] I went down under it I have no language
[1:31:43] to describe what took place but it was
[1:31:46] wonderful it seemed to me that my body
[1:31:48] had suddenly become porous and that a
[1:31:51] current of electricity was being turned
[1:31:53] on turned on me from all sides and for
[1:31:56] two hours I lay under his mighty
[1:32:00] power that was William H Durham he said
[1:32:04] someone might be speaking sudden the
[1:32:07] spirit will fall upon the congregation
[1:32:09] God
[1:32:11] himself would give the altar
[1:32:14] [Music]
[1:32:15] call men would fall all over the house
[1:32:19] like the slain in battle or Rush amen uh
[1:32:23] for the altar in
[1:32:25] Mass to seek God the scene often
[1:32:28] resemble a a a Forest of Fallen
[1:32:32] trees Frank
[1:32:35] bartleman they said these meetings
[1:32:37] continue with intensity intensity for
[1:32:39] about seven
[1:32:41] years can you mind go go imagine going
[1:32:44] to church and every time you went to
[1:32:46] church the power of God was just moving
[1:32:48] in the
[1:32:49] place huh these meetings continue with
[1:32:52] intensity
[1:32:54] for about seven years with hundreds of
[1:32:56] thousands having attended and
[1:32:57] missionaries been sent out many
[1:33:00] Pentecostal denominations they trace
[1:33:02] their Roots back to the soua Street
[1:33:05] Revival and many individual Pentecostals
[1:33:08] Trace their spiritual Roots back to the
[1:33:09] same but look at this
[1:33:12] unfortunately the emphasis on tongues as
[1:33:16] the only evidence of filling by the Holy
[1:33:19] Ghost is unbiblical and leads to error
[1:33:22] and excess
[1:33:25] now they they hit it spot on this is why
[1:33:27] Pentecost is not the stopping right
[1:33:30] right that's why we don't stop we go to
[1:33:32] the fullness of the word but in our
[1:33:35] going there we want to welcome what they
[1:33:38] have at Pentecost amen truth brother
[1:33:41] amen amen we want it all church that's
[1:33:44] for me I want it all not just part of I
[1:33:48] Want It
[1:33:49] All hallelujah hallelujah one of the
[1:33:52] other things that happened because of
[1:33:54] this this you know the the the uh this
[1:33:57] unbiblical doctrine of tongues being the
[1:34:00] only evidence of of of of the Holy Ghost
[1:34:03] that's that's that's unbiblical and and
[1:34:06] I'm going read the quote to you I'm
[1:34:07] going just share it right now I won't
[1:34:08] read it today but I share it in in
[1:34:10] future weeks tongues brother brandham
[1:34:13] helped us to
[1:34:15] see most of y'all that got shoes that
[1:34:19] that might tie or
[1:34:21] whatever sneakers
[1:34:24] your sneakers have
[1:34:27] tongues now if you only wore the
[1:34:31] tongues you wouldn't have a
[1:34:36] shoe right and see brother Brandon was a
[1:34:39] man with a seventh grade education that
[1:34:40] help us understand this you don't go to
[1:34:42] the store and say can I buy a pair of
[1:34:46] tongues no you want the whole
[1:34:49] shoe I want a heel I I I I I want the
[1:34:53] front front part of it I want the sides
[1:34:55] I I want the whole shoe to fit on this
[1:34:58] foot because just the tongues myself is
[1:35:00] not good
[1:35:03] enough see we want all the gifts of the
[1:35:06] Spirit not just the tongues by
[1:35:08] themselves and see the tongues got to
[1:35:09] come with an interpreter amen oh my you
[1:35:14] oh Hallelujah you know the Bible
[1:35:16] actually tell us that that that that
[1:35:18] that if a person speaks in tongues that
[1:35:21] they should pray that they also
[1:35:22] interpret yes now now what that what
[1:35:25] that is when the Holy Spirit is coming
[1:35:26] upon you let me just say these things
[1:35:28] let me let me just preach these things
[1:35:30] and be very plain when the Holy Spirit
[1:35:32] is coming upon you you feel yourself
[1:35:34] getting ready to speak in tongues it's
[1:35:36] at that moment you got to say Lord and I
[1:35:37] I I feel you but if there's not an
[1:35:40] interpreter here I'm not supposed to say
[1:35:41] this so if there's no interpreter if you
[1:35:43] got to anoint me to speak in tongues
[1:35:45] then you got have to also anoint me to
[1:35:46] to interpret this because I don't want
[1:35:48] to be out of my place Hallelujah
[1:35:51] somebody Lord you got to give
[1:35:53] interpretation of this father because
[1:35:56] this is what your word say now I'm going
[1:35:58] to do my part but you going to have to
[1:36:00] do your part father yes sir either

[1:42:07] living like this and producing that this
[1:42:09] the devil I don't want nothing to do
[1:42:10] with it walked away and then God God
[1:42:12] took him out to the to the to to a cave
[1:42:14] and as he's there on in the cave the
[1:42:16] Holy Spirit oh I just love God the Holy
[1:42:19] Spirit picked up his Bible with a wind
[1:42:23] Hallelujah the wind came and took the
[1:42:26] Bible opened it imagine your Bible
[1:42:29] closed like this and a strong wind come
[1:42:34] hallelujah oh
[1:42:36] my you see the wind
[1:42:45] just
[1:42:47] God
[1:42:48] well the thing of it is is that it just
[1:42:51] didn't happen no one time
[1:42:53] he closed the Bible again and the wind
[1:42:55] comes again and opens the Bible my God
[1:42:59] God
[1:43:01] sir and not just open the Bible the the
[1:43:04] wind opens the Bible to the exact same
[1:43:08] scripture I believe it happened three
[1:43:12] times and when when when he when when
[1:43:14] the wind opened the Bible he start
[1:43:16] reading and this was out of uh this was
[1:43:19] Hebrews Lord I I I I'm I'm way out of my
[1:43:22] notes this not in my not notes I I know
[1:43:24] it's Hebrews um it might be Hebrews 6
[1:43:27] let me just let me let me Lord this was
[1:43:30] not in my notes let me see where I'm at
[1:43:34] right
[1:43:44] now I believe it
[1:43:49] was yeah I think it was Hebrews 6 amen
[1:43:53] that that uh and
[1:43:55] and now see I'm it's it's got me over
[1:43:58] here Lord have mercy it's hard to read
[1:44:00] these things and not say nothing go go
[1:44:02] to verse one Hebrews 6 and I believe
[1:44:04] this is right and and y'all if I'm wrong
[1:44:06] I'm sorry I don't mean to be wrong it's
[1:44:08] just kind of coming to me but I remember
[1:44:11] the the wind opening the Bible for the
[1:44:13] prophet while he was there and the Holy
[1:44:15] Spirit opened it right to this chapter
[1:44:17] in Hebrews and I believe it's this
[1:44:18] therefore leaving the principles of the
[1:44:20] doctrines of Christ let us go on into
[1:44:23] Perfection not laying again the
[1:44:24] foundation of repentance from dead works
[1:44:26] and of Faith toward god of the doctrine
[1:44:28] of baptism of laying on of hands and of
[1:44:31] resurrection of the dead and of the
[1:44:32] Eternal judgment and this will we do if
[1:44:35] God permit for it is impossible for
[1:44:38] those who were once enlightened and
[1:44:39] tasted of the Heavenly gift and were
[1:44:41] made partakers of the Holy Ghost and
[1:44:43] have tasted the good word of the of God
[1:44:46] and the powers of the world to come now
[1:44:48] this I say that I say that because we
[1:44:51] got many that walked away but uh-uh no
[1:44:53] no no the scripture says impossible for
[1:44:55] those who were once enlightened and have
[1:44:57] tasted of the Heavenly gift and were
[1:44:58] made partakers of the Holy Ghost and
[1:45:00] have tasted the good word of God and the
[1:45:02] powers of the world to come if they
[1:45:04] shall fall away to renew them again into
[1:45:06] repentance seeing They Crucified to
[1:45:07] themselves the Son of God AR fresh and
[1:45:09] put him to an open shame and this is the
[1:45:11] verse I believe that was he was pointing
[1:45:13] out for the Earth which drinketh in the
[1:45:16] ring that cometh off upon it and
[1:45:18] bringeth forth herbs meat for them by
[1:45:20] whom it is dressed receiveth blessing
[1:45:23] from God but that which beare thorns and
[1:45:25] briers is rejected and is nigh unto
[1:45:29] cursing whose end is to be burned now
[1:45:32] what brother Brandon was seeing there is
[1:45:33] that the the rain was going to fall on
[1:45:36] the just and the unjust the Holy Spirit
[1:45:40] begin to reveal that so there was one
[1:45:41] man that was just but there was another
[1:45:43] man unjust Hallelujah but you know what
[1:45:47] God does the
[1:45:48] separating you don't have to worry about
[1:45:50] that unjust person and and get so you
[1:45:53] know cuz cuz people see the unjust
[1:45:54] person and then they start didn't start
[1:45:56] criticizing Christianity you looking at
[1:45:59] one unjust
[1:46:01] person and the rain going to fall on the
[1:46:04] just and the unjust brother brandom
[1:46:05] learned that through that scripture the
[1:46:07] Holy Spirit opened it up multiple times
[1:46:10] to the same scripture and when he saw
[1:46:12] that he said okay I see I see what's
[1:46:14] going on and this why I'm telling you
[1:46:16] you don't want to be a unjust one
[1:46:19] manifesting in the
[1:46:21] gifts y your end is to be
[1:46:25] burned what you want to be is just a
[1:46:27] Sanctified
[1:46:29] life letting the gifts manifest through
[1:46:31] you but knowing that you clean before
[1:46:35] God I I I don't I I I done seeing I
[1:46:38] don't seen uh people possessed with
[1:46:43] demons reveal
[1:46:46] secrets of people that's supposed to
[1:46:47] been
[1:46:49] preachers walk into the office to come

[1:47:59] yes Lord
[1:48:01] amen let me let me let me let me go back
[1:48:03] and read a little bit more
[1:48:05] here now yeah I got to finish this quote
[1:48:08] I didn't
[1:48:10] so the Methodist said you got it when
[1:48:13] you shout that is your early Methodist
[1:48:16] when you shout you got it they found out
[1:48:18] many shout it who didn't have it and the
[1:48:20] Pentecost come along or the restoration
[1:48:22] of gifts and said when you speak with
[1:48:23] tongues you got
[1:48:26] it but they found out many spoke with
[1:48:29] tongues who didn't have it it says those
[1:48:32] things are all right but you can never
[1:48:34] major on a minor now I had to make sure
[1:48:36] I put that in here because brother
[1:48:38] Brandon said you can never major on a
[1:48:39] minor and I know there's so many people
[1:48:41] take that quote say see that's why we
[1:48:43] don't really talk about the gifts
[1:48:44] because you can never major on a
[1:48:46] minor well you wouldn't talk about
[1:48:48] Divine Healing
[1:48:51] either y'all know that
[1:48:53] sir cuz Divine Healing you came major on
[1:48:55] a
[1:48:57] minor amen but look for me I want
[1:49:00] everything that God had in the scripture
[1:49:02] I want it all I want Divine Healing I
[1:49:05] want justification I want sanctification
[1:49:08] I want the word I want the gifts I Want
[1:49:10] It All yes sir
[1:49:14] amen let me go on a little
[1:49:18] further it says they found out it says
[1:49:20] uh you can never make on mind that's an
[1:49:22] attribute of know the Holy Spirit that's
[1:49:23] right any of those emotions which he
[1:49:25] says which I believe in every one of
[1:49:28] them but that's not it yet the Holy
[1:49:30] Spirit when you receive it is the person
[1:49:32] of the Lord Jesus dwelling in you and
[1:49:34] Jesus said by their fruits you shall
[1:49:35] know them the fruit that their branches
[1:49:37] Bears tells uh tells what Vine it's in
[1:49:41] all right I'm going on I want to read
[1:49:43] from Ephesian Church age couple more
[1:49:45] quotes here Lord
[1:49:49] I I got a lot here in my my bag this
[1:49:53] morning and I'm just trying to get as
[1:49:56] much out as I can but I know I'll be
[1:49:58] back we'll find a stopping point soon
[1:50:01] here in Ephesian Church AG brother
[1:50:02] Brandon says this how we long for the
[1:50:05] day when the Crooked roads will be
[1:50:07] straightened and and I bring this in
[1:50:09] because we we've had so much confusion
[1:50:12] in our in in in our message
[1:50:15] ranks I mean it if people bust out
[1:50:18] speaking in tongues in some Churches boy
[1:50:20] I think people just
[1:50:25] I mean they they they ain't heard a
[1:50:27] nobody speaking tongues in so
[1:50:30] long and and we and and if you listen to
[1:50:34] tapes if you listen to tapes there's
[1:50:37] tongue speaking in brother Brandon's
[1:50:40] church now I'm going read a quote for
[1:50:42] y'all and and and you know not this week
[1:50:44] but I'mma just I'm I'm getting ahead of
[1:50:46] myself I'm I'mma read the quote but I
[1:50:47] might as well tell you brother brandom
[1:50:49] had a sister in his church he had come
[1:50:51] to the pull pit
[1:50:53] and he opened his Bible and he read the
[1:50:54] scripture and as soon as he read the
[1:50:56] scripture sister raised up and she
[1:50:59] started speaking in tongues now here's
[1:51:01] another thing that we learned through
[1:51:02] our Prophet that when somebody speaks in
[1:51:04] tongues you know what the rest of us do
[1:51:07] we be
[1:51:08] quiet you don't say nothing you don't
[1:51:12] move can I can I just say this while
[1:51:14] we're here young people that's not the
[1:51:16] time to go to the
[1:51:19] bathroom when you hear some a tongue go
[1:51:22] out like that you don't move at all you
[1:51:25] hold it sir and you just stand still and
[1:51:28] what we do is we wait on God to give the
[1:51:31] interpretation so this sister spoke in
[1:51:33] tongues and uh right after brother
[1:51:35] Brandon read the scripture and uh so
[1:51:37] brother Brandon just got silent the
[1:51:38] whole church knew just to be silent just
[1:51:40] to wait well he waited for just a a
[1:51:42] minute or so and he says no
[1:51:44] interpretation came so he just began to
[1:51:46] pray and when he prayed he said
[1:51:50] sis he says um I I know that was God in
[1:51:54] you you know that that that just causing
[1:51:56] you to speak like that I know that was
[1:51:58] God he says the only thing is is that uh
[1:52:01] the spirit of the prophets is subject to
[1:52:02] the prophets and it was just the wrong
[1:52:05] time that he say the reason it the wrong
[1:52:07] time that's why no no no uh
[1:52:09] interpretation came because you actually
[1:52:11] released it at the wrong
[1:52:13] time and he said sis when the when this
[1:52:17] when when I finish my sermon if the
[1:52:20] Spirit come back upon you I I guar
[1:52:22] guarantee that's the quote I'mma read it
[1:52:25] for you I guarantee that there will be
[1:52:27] an interpretation because it's coming at
[1:52:30] the right time
[1:52:32] Hallelujah my God
[1:52:35] hallelujah was that a prophet rejecting
[1:52:39] the gifts or was that a prophet just
[1:52:41] trying to get the church in order so the
[1:52:43] gifts could go forward amen amen he says
[1:52:47] I guarantee so so what happens that it's
[1:52:49] it's at the end of service at the end of
[1:52:52] service he welcome that after the word
[1:52:55] is gone forth now not during his altar
[1:52:58] call if you see the spirit is leading
[1:53:00] towards the alter call don't hold it
[1:53:02] hold it hold it see this not a
[1:53:06] competition to see who can get the gift
[1:53:08] out first oh come on
[1:53:12] church that's not a
[1:53:14] competition can I can I can I can I can
[1:53:16] I can I just share something with y'all
[1:53:19] sometime people that are gifted want to
[1:53:22] dominate the
[1:53:26] church I'm I'mma just say it I'mma say
[1:53:28] the truth now they want to dominate the
[1:53:30] church and if their gift is not
[1:53:33] accepted they
[1:53:39] leave they feel led to leave if their
[1:53:43] gift is not accepted or if the pastor
[1:53:45] trying to put it in order we welcome the
[1:53:48] gifts but they must be in order and
[1:53:51] that's why we have Deacons say to help
[1:53:52] us keep things in
[1:53:54] order now if you get upset and leave a
[1:53:57] church because your gift wasn't accepted
[1:53:59] something wrong with
[1:54:01] [Music]
[1:54:02] you they didn't want to hear me yeah
[1:54:04] there's a reason people didn't want to
[1:54:05] hear you CU they knew what was in you
[1:54:07] wasn't right look at what's manifesting
[1:54:09] out of you right
[1:54:13] now look I've Been Around Church a long
[1:54:15] time and I done seen it happen over and
[1:54:18] over again gifted people never willing
[1:54:20] to subject their gifts to the to the
[1:54:23] word yeah like brother Brandon ran into
[1:54:25] it y'all y'all come on y'all y'all y'all
[1:54:27] y'all remember the pastor that told told
[1:54:30] Brother

[1:54:38] member she was fixing up her
[1:54:41] stockings getting ready for a prophecy
[1:54:43] and she did it at the same time every
[1:54:47] service and not brother Brandon he
[1:54:49] wasn't the only one notic that even his
[1:54:50] son said that lady back here again
[1:54:54] that sister back here again and I mean
[1:54:57] everybody watch her watch her watch her
[1:55:00] only people empowering her is her pastor
[1:55:03] and the people in her church and they
[1:55:05] come out there

[1:55:10] call and she take
[1:55:12] off come outside I want to see
[1:55:15] you brother Brandon Let It Go the first
[1:55:17] time second night here she come again

[1:55:44] ain't even worried about none of that
[1:55:46] but but she she just I'm going to
[1:55:47] release this I I got a word I'mma
[1:55:49] release it oh Lord have mercy
[1:55:53] Jesus he said um okay she stood up
[1:55:58] brother R sit
[1:55:59] down
[1:56:02] sir she looked he said I said sit
[1:56:08] down yes can't be talking to me I got a
[1:56:12] word from the Lord sit down with your
[1:56:15] word from the
[1:56:20] Lord she was so embarrassed
[1:56:23] you can probably see a face turn red and
[1:56:25] like oh my can't believe this man
[1:56:27] embarrassed me like this who does he
[1:56:29] think he is then her pastor had to go
[1:56:31] stand up for her yes brother Brandon you
[1:56:35] was
[1:56:37] wrong you telling a prophet that he
[1:56:40] wrong and you know what brother brandom
[1:56:42] didn't use no gift on him you know how
[1:56:44] brother brandom corrected this brother
[1:56:46] with the
[1:56:47] word he said brother I'm not wrong she
[1:56:50] wrong he said no no no God God was
[1:56:52] finished speaking through you it was
[1:56:53] time to speak through her
[1:56:55] now he say he say brother look the Bible
[1:56:58] say the spirit of the prophets got to be
[1:57:00] subject to the prophets and I'm in the
[1:57:02] pull pit getting ready to have a a altar
[1:57:04] call and she interrupts the altar call
[1:57:06] three nights in a
[1:57:08] row say she wrong they left there
[1:57:11] probably never came back to any more
[1:57:12] meetings but see anytime you have a
[1:57:15] person with a gift that cannot bring the
[1:57:16] gift into subjection of the
[1:57:19] word then you know there's something
[1:57:20] wrong with the gift and remember this
[1:57:22] remember this remember this gifts and
[1:57:26] callings are without repentance so
[1:57:29] there's people that can have a gift and
[1:57:31] really not subject subject to the
[1:57:35] word am you just can't get moved by
[1:57:38] somebody's
[1:57:39] gift make sure the gift is in line with
[1:57:42] the word that's why you have a pastor to
[1:57:45] help keep things in line with the word
[1:57:47] yes sir
[1:57:48] [Music]
[1:57:50] amen amen I know what I'm saying here

[1:58:27] truth cuz that's the father seeking for
[1:58:31] those to worship Him in spirit and in
[1:58:36] truth I'm an Ephesian Church age I'm
[1:58:40] reading the prophet says how we long for
[1:58:43] that day when the Crooked roads will be
[1:58:45] straight will all be straightened and we
[1:58:48] will be with
[1:58:49] him time without end
[1:58:52] May that they hasten its appearance and
[1:58:54] may we hasten to obey his word and
[1:58:57] thereby prove our worthiness to share
[1:58:59] his glory he that hath an ear to hear
[1:59:03] what the spirit saith un the churches
[1:59:05] how tragic it is that this first age did
[1:59:08] not listen to the spirit instead it
[1:59:10] listened to man but thank God I like
[1:59:14] this thank God in the last age there
[1:59:18] will be a group RIS up Hallelujah the
[1:59:23] true Bride of the last day she will
[1:59:27] listen to the
[1:59:29] spirit and watch this in that day of
[1:59:32] gross
[1:59:34] Darkness the light will return by the
[1:59:37] pure

[2:03:33] interpretation of tongues I I want to I
[2:03:36] want I want to see God I don't want to
[2:03:38] limit God but I want to see God do it in
[2:03:40] such a way like they did it in the book
[2:03:43] of
[2:03:45] Acts in the book of Acts every man
[2:03:49] understood in their own language
[2:03:52] amen amen I got some that understand
[2:03:55] Africans I got some in here that
[2:03:58] understand
[2:03:59] shonah I got some that understand
[2:04:02] twe some that understand
[2:04:05] Creole some that understand
[2:04:07] Spanish and you know you can be speaking
[2:04:10] in English and then somebody understand
[2:04:13] it in their native
[2:04:17] language brother brother Nathan um at
[2:04:20] his church few years years ago there was
[2:04:22] a brother he prayed earnestly like
[2:04:24] brother Lord I go to church I just want
[2:04:27] to be in church but I can't understand
[2:04:29] nothing they saying Lord please God help
[2:04:32] me to understand what he said just help
[2:04:33] me understand what the preacher saying
[2:04:36] the brother came to
[2:04:37] church that day didn't understand
[2:04:40] anything in the song service but when
[2:04:43] the preacher stepped forward to
[2:04:45] preach all of a sudden he stood to his
[2:04:47] feet the whole service because he heard
[2:04:51] brother Nathan preaching in English but
[2:04:53] he was hearing in his native
[2:04:56] language and he was sitting there
[2:04:59] rejoicing look God he's the same
[2:05:01] yesterday today and
[2:05:03] forever this is what we're looking for
[2:05:06] God to do in our midst Hallelujah and
[2:05:08] and I'm talking about a God that just
[2:05:09] don't do this one
[2:05:11] time he can do it every time we come
[2:05:14] together oh
[2:05:17] Hallelujah let me just let me read this
[2:05:20] and I'm I'm I'm closing God providing
[2:05:22] healing for this generation the devil
[2:05:25] put us in the pawn
[2:05:27] shop but Jesus redeemed
[2:05:30] us he's our kinsman redeemer God made
[2:05:34] flesh kin folks to us in order to redeem
[2:05:37] us from the course and from the curse of
[2:05:39] sin and sickness and tonight has sent
[2:05:42] the Holy Spirit to dwell with the church
[2:05:44] and show signs and wonders of healing
[2:05:45] and salvation until he returns again how
[2:05:49] long was it to last go ye into all the
[2:05:52] world and preach the gospel to Every
[2:05:54] Creature go ye into all the world and
[2:05:55] demonstrate the power to Every Creature
[2:05:59] these signs shall follow them that
[2:06:00] believe how far to all the world and
[2:06:02] when this gospel is gone to all the
[2:06:04] world then I will return these signs
[2:06:06] shall follow them to all the world in my
[2:06:08] name they shall cast out demons they
[2:06:10] shall speak with new
[2:06:12] tongues they take up serpents or drink
[2:06:15] deadly things it would not harm them and
[2:06:17] if they lay hands on the sick they shall
[2:06:19] recover Jesus said that would be the
[2:06:21] same
[2:06:22] sign he says just like Moses lifted the
[2:06:25] brass serpent it was a sign that God was
[2:06:27] in the
[2:06:29] camp when the waters was
[2:06:31] pouring from The Rock and their rock is
[2:06:34] not like our Rock when the waters was
[2:06:36] pouring from the rock it was a sign that
[2:06:38] God was in the camp when the troubled
[2:06:41] water on the pool of Bethesda it was a
[2:06:43] sign that God was in the camp when Jesus
[2:06:47] healed the sick and made the lame to
[2:06:48] walk and and the blind to seea God was
[2:06:51] in the camp when Peter and John passed
[2:06:53] through the gate called Beautiful lifted
[2:06:55] up the man that been crippled from his
[2:06:56] mother's womb it was a sign that God was
[2:06:58] in the camp when the Holy Ghost returned
[2:07:01] on Pentecost and endued that bunch of
[2:07:03] people with power it was a
[2:07:06] sign that
[2:07:08] God was in the camp so young people
[2:07:12] don't be afraid when you see God coming
[2:07:14] to the camp some of the older Saints may
[2:07:17] have learned how to just uh release
[2:07:20] themselves underneath that anointing so
[2:07:22] God could use them for tongues and
[2:07:24] interpretation of tongues God can use
[2:07:26] them but you young people if you would
[2:07:27] just learn to just Release Yourself In
[2:07:29] God's anointing when he comes cuz I'm
[2:07:31] telling you he's coming he's coming
[2:07:34] you're going to see some things you're
[2:07:35] going to hear some things this what
[2:07:37] brother Jack was talk no not just what
[2:07:39] what what brother Jack was talking about
[2:07:40] this is what Joel was talking
[2:07:43] about so when you see it don't get don't
[2:07:45] get
[2:07:46] alarmed remember one time we had we had
[2:07:48] tongues and we had
[2:07:50] interpretation you know y'all yall
[2:07:52] remember we're still holding on to that
[2:07:53] one open your mouth
[2:07:56] wide that anointing was so strong in
[2:07:59] church that
[2:08:01] day brother Troy had to close out the
[2:08:03] service he looked like you want me to
[2:08:05] close out after that and y'all remember
[2:08:08] on that day brother Caleb was in church
[2:08:11] oh yes and he was just crying out oh God
[2:08:14] oh
[2:08:15] God I'm telling you when the anointing
[2:08:17] come it'll just make you do
[2:08:19] things amen I remember brother Nehemiah
[2:08:23] I mean the chair still wearing a
[2:08:26] scar brother Nehemiah just snotting up
[2:08:28] something underneath that
[2:08:31] anointing God comes and does things for
[2:08:34] people that's why we looking for this we
[2:08:36] we expecting this in the church no we
[2:08:39] we're not we're not pushing this and
[2:08:40] preaching this out no we welcome this we
[2:08:43] welcome the spirit of God to have
[2:08:45] preeminence amongst his people amen we
[2:08:48] just want Sanctified lives
[2:08:52] that's oh my don't get afraid you just
[2:08:55] learn to yield yourself to whatever God
[2:08:57] wants to do my God y'all see y'all going
[2:09:01] to see we're going to see we're going to
