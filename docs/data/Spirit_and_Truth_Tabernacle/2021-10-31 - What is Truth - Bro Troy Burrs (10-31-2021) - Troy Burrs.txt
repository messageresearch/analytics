of them old school songs hey how we just love the lord jesus so uh sister rachel was playing this song a little earlier and i was at home and i just had one of the moments i said i want to go back to when i was a little boy growing up in church we used to sing what a friend we had in jesus all our sins and griefs to bear what a privilege it is to carry everything to the lord in prayer back then we didn't have no musicians and uh the deacons would get to sing in the song and the mothers would get the humming along and man we just we had a time and we did a little different than the way sister rachel was just playing it so if y'all don't mind i want to just take a step back amen into my past and i just want to bring this song and we're just going to do it an acapella man again this morning yeah you know i just uh just just just came to my spirits what up friend we in jesus [Music] oh i see greece too [Music] hallelujah say what a brief [Music] ledge to [Music] breathing [Music] to

their trouble in me where hallelujah we should never be described why cause we can take give to the lord in prayer with a friend we have in jesus what uh friend we have him jesus all our sins and grace to bear whoa yeah everything to god in [Music] prayer [Music] somebody give him praise in this place hallelujah [Music] see it it didn't mean what it meant to me now back then i couldn't really understand but when that when i when they put their emphasis on yeah everything too god in prayer that just that just struck a accord with me everything you carry to god in prayer i don't care what you're going through you just stop and pray about it watch god give you an answer come on put those hands together for jesus [Applause] my god my god mr rachel take us back to the the style you was planning y'all can be seated in jesus name amen we uh just thank the lord just to be here oh my my my my my my hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah just want to give you a couple announcements say man on today and um one second here [Music] it is so hard to believe that this year is gone uh here we are uh approaching man november and before you know this december we don't step into 2022 and and um for me i just feel like we're getting closer and closer to the coming of the lord and i think it's important for us just to keep our lambs trimmed and our fire is burning bright amen amen praise the lord [Music] maybe i can do it as a special today you you remember that one keeping my lamp all trim okay we'll do that as a special all right all right uh so uh a prayer request here from sister brown says pray for my neighbor gary who was admitted to the hospital with various uh ailments he was afraid to go because his sister went in and passed away there i pray god will heal his body take the fear away and save his souls we want to remember [Music] gary in prayer this morning [Music] let's praise the lord let's just take that before god's throne even now father we're here we thank you lord just came to my heart this morning we made contact with certain people in life for purpose every step that we take is ordered by you sister brown has been given a privilege god to be neighbors with this man gary who was suffering his sister just passed and now he's going through in his body and with all these ailments but lord he's afraid fear is gripping his heart because his sister didn't make it out and god he he wants to make it out we send the word of healing to him that you god would just bring him up through whatever this is you're the one that designed the body and father you know everything that's wrong with it so lord i pray that you correct it that you would strengthen him and god the first thing that you would do is remove the fear that he would grab a hold of a of a promise of your word and father not only uh through that may he recognize that the same blood that brings healing is also the same blood that brings salvation so lord i pray that you have moved by your spirit upon gary even right now we send your words he was you were uh lord you were wounded for his transgressions it's by your stripes lord he is healed we believe that and we claim it now in the name of jesus we pray amen amen praise the lord the announcements amen uh for today on um this tuesday the sisters will be in uh virtual prayer and what that means is what virtual prayer means is that we have a app that we use google meets i believe it's called and we just join up on google meets there's a link that they can send out to you and all you do is click on the link and you join up and you can get in and just be a part of the prayer service that the sisters are having you can do it right from your house uh everybody gets an opportunity to pray amen over the various needs that are there and uh if you can't think of nothing to pray for always pray for me always pray for me i can i can use it amen so that's that's that's this uh twosie and if you want the link sister erica can give it to you amen don't forget we'll be back here wednesday uh it's wednesday service at 7 30 and we continue our streaming through both twitter and facebook and i want to let those know that are following the service i know sometimes um it's just not a good string and we are depending here on the school's network and uh typically they lock things down they don't even want you going to facebook they don't want you doing things like that so it's a um just a challenge and we ask that you just be patient with us one thing for sure is that we are recording the services and uh after the service is done uh i do thank god brother simba tries to his best to get it quickly released to um youtube and you can go to youtube and there's nothing you typically know issues there at the stream so uh just um um just bear with us pray for us amen pray for the technology you know that that god would just just help us amen through that until we can get into our own place amen so just bear with us amen we appreciate it uh our sunday morning service uh prayer service from 9am to 10 a.m uh sunday morning service 10 30 and then also don't forget this friday night our first friday night of the month we always have a tape service that we listen to so you'll listen to this in your house 7 30 everyone gather around their house listening to this sermon do you now believe amen and the date on that is 53 1106 so just make sure you get that 53-1106 do you now believe that's the tape that i've been we'll be listening to and don't forget on next uh sunday time changes we go back we fall back an hour uh so uh just remember that you'll get an extra hours sleep on next sunday amen as we uh come for our giving we have multiple ways those that are inside the sanctuary we have a box over here to my right on the table if you want to give just make sure you put your offering in the box we typically ask you to do this as you're coming into the service to do that because the brothers have to take the box and process amen the offering accordingly but uh if you didn't get a chance to put it in before you got here to service maybe while we're doing the specials or something like that just go ahead and put your offering in the box and that'll be fine uh you know because the brothers will take it away and you won't see it again amen so that's for those inside those are to join us online you have multiple ways that you can give one is through cash app one is through paypal and uh if you choose paypal choose the option to send to a friend or family member and use the email address of giving at john423.org also if you want to use cash app our handle is dollar sign spirit and truth t if you want to just mail something into the church the uh the address is there at the bottom of the screen we do we sincerely appreciate all those that give online those that mail offerings in we do receive it and we are we're just really really grateful sometimes i i see things come and i might not even recognize the name of the person that's doing it but somehow god has given us favor and they uh they feel uh a need just to be a part of the ministry and we certainly certainly appreciate it so god bless you amen and god i'll keep you amen they return the blessing 100 fold to you and man god is god has been good church god and god has been real good amen to us and and i am i'm very very grateful for him just meeting every need that we have uh every need we have i i'm i'm um thoroughly convinced that uh this season that we're in is just a season amen a transition and i believe we we're going into things that the exceeding the abundant above all we can ask or think i believe that i believe that but but what god watches what god watches is will you be faithful over a few things will you be faithful with you are you going to serve me still right no matter what will you be faithful just to steal you know because we ain't going to change when we get to the new church we're going to be the same people just maybe just give a little bit more praise for what he's done for us but we we're going to be faithful right here i believe uh uh fred hammond said you got to learn how to praise god in the hallway is it a hallway and i ain't know what he was talking about in the hallway he's like yeah he said you know you don't walked out of one door because that door is closed behind you and you're waiting for the next door to open and you're just stuck in the hallway but you got to learn how to praise god in the hallway glory to god amen sometimes in life you'll find yourself just in the hallway but you know god getting ready to open up the door so just wait till the door open you ain't got to kick the door down and beat the door down just wait for god to open up the door amen it's god that opens and closes the door so but we praise him regardless amen we thank the lord amen so i saw sister rebecca over there good to see you sister god bless you amen good to

your history in church i said wow man i'm glad you asked that i said it started at pentecost under john d alexander and went on over there to peaceful zion where we kind of grew up a little bit and a lot of those old songs that you hear them singing it was kind of drilled into us at that point but god wasn't through with us he was still traveling yeah we found ourselves at a school in the cafeteria tell the story brother daryl glory [Laughter] we've moved on from there yes we built a church i don't want to skip this one we remodeled a theater and we were being introduced to the message right then we went on to build a church amen searching for a church huh so we're encouraged this morning that uh god is still in control amen yes sir if you grab your bibles i won't try to be before you too long we thank god for the journey amen we'll uh take our scripture reading and i'll let you sit momentarily from john the 17th chapter and uh we'll read from the 17th verse and i'll let you have your seats pray for me my wife and mother and her sisters they went to visit sister dixon's brothers and sisters she had a burden on my heart to go see her her siblings so they took her and they're having a wonderful time up there and i think i did all right this morning amen john 17 17 sanctify sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth may the lord add a bleach blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth if you will i'd like for you to go with me to the john the 18th chapter we're going to read from john 18 to 33rd verse just want to say good morning to i have talked about how we've been so blessed uh so i'm i'm double blessed as i have two mothers i have my biological mother and i have my mother a man who's here with us today in person and i have another mother who's here with me online i just love to i know she critiques me she said you need to get you or something to wipe your face and this that man quit coughing in the microphone sheila she gets on me but that's that's mama that's mama that's mama see she said if i can't tell you who came god bless you i said okay mama i do my best mama i'm not as polished this song amen john 18 33 then pilate into amen let me read it here because i like that 18 33 then pilate entered into judgment hall again and called jesus and said unto him art thou the king of the jews jesus answered him and said says thou this thing of thyself or did others tell it the of me pilot answered i am a jew pilot answered am i a jew thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me what has thou done all right pilate we see here is is is is is like why are they delivering you to me right aren't you supposed to be king of the jews what in the world could you have done to upset these people so bad right jesus as him says the thing of uh i'm sorry hold on let me get my spot pilot thank you jesus said my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight right that i should not be delivered to the jews but now is my kingdom not of hence pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then jesus answered thou says that i'm a king to this end was i born and for this cause came i into the world that i should bear witness unto truth everyone that is of truth heareth my voice yes palace said unto him what is truth and then he had said this he went out again unto the jews and says unto them i find no fault at all so pilate asked the question what is truth i like to title this message this morning what is true what is truth we see that in this day and time uh that we're living in we were much like pilate of that day truth was was was was was it was just so fleeting today is is it's so much worse we have social media now social media if i'm not mistaken some maybe some of the young folks can help me i think it started out with a thing called myspace all right see it started out innocent it's my space this is my space all right and i can create it and decorate it like i want this is my space the spirit entering in yeah and then it just sort of grew from there to facebook so i got it put down i said it went from my space to my rights everybody got a right to say whatever they want to say whether it be true or not see so when you have things of this nature yeah we have uh all of these fake news we use there used to be a time when uh you you you can believe what you see now technology has brought us to a place where they can take one person's face and put it on another person's body and they can manipulate what you see put another person's words to another person's voice all in the work of deception we're living in a terrible time period paul got to the i mean pilate was so confused in his day and said oh my god what is truth looking in the face of truth he had the question what is truth that's right that's right good statement and here we are today 2021 right looking in the face of troops but people are what is truth amen amen amen i'd like for you to go with me to a scripture uh over in acts 19. all right work with me as we begin to just set a platform here amen what is truth acts 19 to 24 verse a certain man named demetrius now listen to this name demetrius he was a silversmith which made silver shrines for diana brought no small game unto the craftsmen in other words they made a lot of money doing this they was they was very wealthy uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh making these shrines glory giving the people is false god right false hope right now it says whom he called together the workmen of like occupation amen my god and says sirs ye know that by this craft we have our wealth right okay moreover ye see and hear that not alone at ephesus but throughout all asia right this paul you see how you say that this who this paul this this fellow this fellow messing with my money all right yeah this fella has persuaded and turned away much people saying that they be no god which are made with hands so that uh not only our craft is in danger to be set at naught but also the temple of the great goddess diana should be despised and her magnificence should be destroyed whom all asia and the world worship come on and when they had heard these things they were full of wrath and cried out seeing greatest diana of ephesians so i no doubt they went all through the city great as diana they they like that they they picked up their street meetings they put up their billboards right they got a television ministry all right they had to let everybody know that this is it yes this is the way wow but you had the voice of truth in that hour saying that this is not the way see now as we read on it says here and they heard these sayings they were full of wrath and cried out saying great to die in ephesians and the whole city was filled with confusion and have caught gaius and aristicus men of macedonia paul's companions in travel they rushed with one accord into the theater these men was in there preaching and they go we gonna put a stop to this we just we're gonna challenge them right and when paul would have entered into in unto the people the disciples suffered him not saying don't go in there paul don't people don't people hot with you man don't go in there right and a certain of the chief of asia which was his friend sent unto him designed him that he would not adventure himself into the theater some therefore cried one thing [Music] somebody else crying another thing for the whole assembly was confused and the more part knew not wherefore why they even come together if that don't paint a picture don't even remember why they come to church and we see that this was all intentional and craft all behind money right that's right we're living in the same day yeah yeah keep the people confused politics politicians preachers and everything if we can keep the people confused we can keep control we don't want the people to know truth what is truth what is truth this morning my brothers and sisters so when we when we we truth truth let me let me let me say this truth there's many different definitions of truth fact and uh the the the the thought of being accurate you know many different things like that but when i look at truth i look at truth i look at truth we know that the devil mimics god in everything that he does there's a certain group of uh club very popular club they they have as their emblem a protractor and a square that's all i gotta say and they and and they claim a claim they claim to be a religious organization don't believe that but because i know a lot of them don't religious about it but we see the original craftsman was god amen the original craftsman has always been so when we look at truth when we look at truth take this word truth when we have a level and a square a square is perfect 90 degrees anything outside of that is not true so when we build we want to build a a a a a a build on truth yes right if we start with the instrumentation that we use it's out off one way or the other and then we starting out wrong amen so we're building he built an ark he gave noah everything he needed and showed him how to build it to build it right to withstand the judgment of that day i'm feeling my help coming glory to withstand the judgment of that hour amen solomon built the temple yes amen he he built the temple amen his heart was in it just building so perfectly but he had the original blueprint he looked at the ark there's three compartments to that arc amen and he said okay now we got the original blueprint amen and we're gonna build it off the original blueprint amen following the original all right amen the architect amen following the same designer amen by inspiration amen he built the temple let's go on in the message no no no no let not i don't want to go get ahead of myself truth why is truth important because truth is what we base our decisions on we make decisions in life based on the information that we're given so if we're given bad information we're bound to make bad decisions we're bound to make the wrong decision glory amen the prophet is statue of a perfect man he said now in in a statue of a perfect man now here is the plan of salvation he says and then a vision broke forth i want to go down a little more to 31 first you must be born again you must be born again and then when you're born again you have faith you believe the word until you're born again you'll argue against it if you if you're just religiously inclined and you got a little human knowledge that you should do right you'll never be able to agree upon the word of god you'll never do it you've got to be born again born again it produces faith amen now i'm going to move down to the 30 to 133 paragraph 133 now you're going to build a house and you pour a foundation say boy i got it see you got the foundation to build your house on now you've got to build the house now there's where the thing comes in this morning we're going to talk about a house this foundation is first what is the foundation christianity faith in the word of god that's your foundation then you begin to grow then you start you're being to add to the foundation now you're building a house you put your uprights and everything else see brother miley said we the generation of the uprights we're the generation of the uprights yeah yeah and see our uprights are true yeah our foundation is solid and our uprights are true yeah amen right right because it's built on the truth of the gospel our building ain't leaning yeah see a weak building a lean building is con lord have mercy it's going to suffer to collapse now we see our uprights and everything else he talked about brother woods who's a carpenter and contractor here tell us how to build your house see but i'm going to tell you how to build your spiritual house where god can dwell he wants to dwell in you he wants to make you hims you like himself he wants to be reflected rather reflecting his being so we're building a house we're building a structure this morning now i want to go down i want you to listen here what the prophet said he said then after we lay our foundation secondly you add your foundation add to your faith peter said add to your faith first first your faith then you add virtue to your faith and and and this is the next column listen at the words that the prophet are using virtue is your next column first you pour your foundation then to your faith act virtue if i read on down there if you read on down there to the 146 virtue must be in us and until we get virtue then we get virtue we can add to our faith the foundation wall it the foundation wall see it take anybody can can lay blocks but it takes a craftsman to turn the cone see we look back here paul was turning the cone yeah yeah he was turning the corner and and and the same way we we we have to and it takes a it takes a profit yeah right to turn the corner oh we just got a wall we don't have a house we're building a house amen so we we look here in the message uh uh uh uh uh uh fellowship by redemption but boy what i want you to i want to bring to your attention uh in acts the seventh chapter solomon said uh uh we build him a house how be it the most high dweller is not in temples made with hands i said the prophet heaven is my footstool earth is uh heaven is my throne earth is my footstool and what house will you build me man i asked that question what house will you build will you build see amen and and and and i venture even further i mentioned i venture a little further in building this house just like noah noah no no no no one didn't have the knowledge but by inspiration the knowledge to build that ark god provided god gave it all of the material that noah needed was provided when solomon built the temple oh fine material god provided everything he need amen and today for you to build a house the spiritual house god has provided everything you need the problem is let me say it this way a lot of people don't want to hear true i don't mind if i take this coat a lot of people don't don't today don't they don't walk true yeah why because when you hear truth you're responsible for it people would rather say well i just didn't know yeah you know you know but they tried to use that excuse well i don't know because see i want to hold on to what i got i want to hold on you see lord help me jesus see a lot of times we we we we we treat god so bad when we need something we call it i need i need a light bill paid off i need the rent paid right so i'm gonna go to church cause i need him right but when i leave church i'm going back to my booth see i'm on you i'm i'm just going to use you you're going to use god and you know what when you say you know he you you you say he uh uh uh i need this you know what he do give it but he know your heart and your heart ain't far from it and you come back the next week say lord i need this you know what to do provide it my car won't start out i need lord i need i need here you go wow wow but then you turn and you go back to your other man when he ain't doing nothing for you all right i don't know who i'm talking to today he ain't doing nothing for you but bringing you down he don't want tearing up everything he tell up your life run rush eye through your family put your cheering strong out on drugs then you go to god and say lord i need you to help my children say mature thank you lord then you go back to this old scoundrel shame on us that's right that's right see in this message here fellowship by redemption i want to i just want to point a few things out to you if i may all right he says don't build upon intellectual faith come back to the basis here get in he says get it in here then worship him worship with him talk with him fellowship with him then build on these other things bring these other things onto that foundation see you got to get your relationship right right you can have a structure but you got to get your relationship right see that's your foundation that's your foundation other than that you just got an empty house a lot of problems but you got to get your foundation right listen how the prophet put it say you got to get it in here amen in here amen then worship with him all right very important listen talk to him fellowship with him i was recently invited to a wedding my son all right love him all right [Music] and uh i was i was i was uh knew the wedding was coming up i was praying i don't know what to say you know it's usually uh common to give a toast or to say something at a wedding now we don't toast liquor i'm toasting juice or water just put the devil right out there we ain't toasting wine or nothing else but it's basically to say something amen to encourage so i i i was i was what am i going to say you know in the situation and when the lord woke me up pop my i was you know just enough sleep deep sleep and popped up cop and the scripture joshua 1 8 now joshua is my son's name he's my first born child and he was getting married on the eighth month and uh the scripture can you put that up there for me please the scripture says uh if you keep this law the book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate therein day and night thou that that thou mayest observe to do all that is written therein right for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shall have good success if you this book of the law right this was joshua so at that time there was only one book that was the books from moses it was it was the message of the owl it was the word that came from prophet moses amen he he he he gave them the book of the law right amen which was the at that time the first wrote book a prophet had to go back and see amen about inspiration to write those books past it to the to to joshua and joshua if you keep this book my god amen of the law depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate on it day and night and observe to do according to all that is written therein then thou shalt be prosperous yes amen amen i was looking at that scripture there and and and and looking at that scripture just sort of meditating on it because that's what they told us to do meditate on sometime amen we we we we go and we when we pray take your time thank you brother we pray we pray and we get up and that's it oh yes stay there how what kind of prayer is a conversation it is a dialogue a relationship between you and god you don't just come and tell god what to do and what you won't leave he wanna talk back to ya'll [Applause] you'll get into a channel right amen when you pray and then you stay there and continue to let the anointing brood over you god speak to your spirit amen and when you have a decision to make laurie yes yes see we we we have mush i had the brother sung the song what a friend we have in jesus i got the song in my notes because i say we when we have we we i'm talking about truth taking time but we we see that everything is confused right right right there's confusion everywhere right sometimes we have decisions to make huge decisions little decisions i was looking into a little thing here a second they say we make over over a thousand decisions in one day you get up in the morning what am i going to wear that's right what am i going to oh what am i going to do right now which way which ride am i going to take to work am i going to get a coffee am i not going to get a coffee yeah yeah yeah before nine o'clock we don't make hundreds of them right praying about none of them glory meditate there in day and night praise god we want to know truth amen amen we want to know truth right maybe god don't want you to go that way that's right but if you not in sync if you're not listening he's not paying attention he want to lead you another way yeah maybe somebody he i was in the store no i'm gonna say it like this because everybody's gonna love them i was in the smoky bones barbecue look sorry about that bro and i had my shirt on and i don't even know what the shirts say but one fella she said man i like your shirt all right what does shirt say but it was something i gave me for my birthday the religious saying on it it just stirred up a conversation man we went we preached right there in that little lobby i said yeah you man god is good let me tell you something do you know him i mean do you really know him you know him as a person you have a relationship with him we just went on and on and on but i went there to just get me a little something to eat you see but but but but you have to be attentive yeah you have to be attentive you always have to be ready no no no no no no no no see now see the psalm says when we have when we have these decisions we have big decisions we're trying we don't know which way to go what do i do what do i do i got this big decision facing me we go we go talk to this person we we consult that person and we never consult jesus the songwriters say what a friend we have in jesus all our sins are grieved to bear what a privilege it is a privilege it is to carry everything to god in prayer he goes on to say uh uh uh oh what peace we often forfeit oh what needless we get ourselves into this stuff all because we do not carry everything to god in prayer do we have trials and temptations is there trouble everywhere we should never be discouraged take it to the lord in prayer listen here can we find a friend so faithful whom will all our sorrows share jesus knows our every weakness take it to the lord in prayer he know better than anybody but see if you holy follow the lord take it to him and pray meditate on it spend time with that thing lord what you want me to do because see the disciples asked jesus lord teach me to pray first of all you got he said he said he's our father whom ought in heaven see you got to approach him right you got to get out of yourself you got to tear down the old man see you got to tear down the old man you got to say lord father god amen hollywood be thy name thy kingdom come thy will i'm not looking for my i may want to do this but is it your will lord thy will be done because if i find myself in your will lord i can say lord you got me out here i will i'm falling you told me lord but see if we get down and pray as soon as we finish we get up and we ain't spending no time with god he wanted you to stay there so he can tell you what to do a lot of times it'll come see out of the mouth of two or three let everything be established from the earth sometimes you'll feel it in your heart the lord telling me that and you're struggling with it then you come to church bam i've even heard it over the radio i had a situation i was going through on my job and i was had my bible open just thumbing through and i stopped right there on romans 12 and it said if you're how to say if it offends you vengeance is mine saith the lord if thy enemy hungers give him food if thy enemy thirst give him water if at then he uh conspired against you he's heaping coals of fire upon his own head and i read that and i was on my way to work and i heard the preacher on the radio use the same scripture i said wow okay so then i'm at work and i had my phone out there before we got started i opened up my facebook page and i seen someone posted a scripture same scripture amen i'm sitting here at work and i say well lord i hear you amen so i got this uh person here lovely lovely fella lovely fella and he's he's he he vexing me right lovely fella no i do i mean marie you got to love him now and i mean mean it too and he asked me to do this i do he asked me to go over there i go i'm giving you just what you asked for my mommy get your coat i want you to go do this don't make no sense but i'm going if you ask for food i'm going to feed you if you ask me for water i'm going to get to you but if you turn around behind closed door and conspire against me god bless you god bless you you don't know who you're fooling with because see not only are you fooling with the bride of jesus christ i'm on scripture [Music] you're going against truth i just have to be patience we're building a house add to your faith add to your foundation faith virtue knowledge temperance patience just being tested my walls are sure my walls are strong it ain't it and let me let me let me go on here let me let me show you this here let me show you this here let me show you this here my god he says here in the message fellowship by redemption he says here and then build these other things bring all these other things unto that foundation but you try to bring these fundamental truths upon a foundation that has nothing to do with it like putting brother woods here uh somewhere in the building he's a contractor well a good what good would it do to take for him to take an old building that's worm eaten and passed termites then uh uh has termites to eat them eat the building and man eat the building down and it's rotten to the foundation and go out and get the best lumber that he could find good dry seasoned redwood tack it on the house go out here and get paint that's recommended by the highest painting in the country the company uh paint company in the world he says look here preacher i can show you that this is real genuine redwood i say yes brother wood that's right look here here's the seal of approval that this is the best paint that could be put on the house that's right brother wood put your but but your foundation is wrong it's got to come down see the problem with the problem with a problem with we don't we we've got all these imaginary ideas we've been taught all of these different things and when we when when truth confronts us we don't want to we we got gotta tear it down we you gotta go back you gotta start over don't bring your yo yo yo denominational id you can't it won't mix you see we're talking about what is truth amen i can show you he says here uh uh uh uh that's what's the matter reading scripture is right brother branham knocks on the pulpit full time preaching the gospel is right but your foundation is wrong tear out your mental conception of things and get god in your heart by the shedding of blood and then build from there see it goes back to the same question when the people got confused they forgot why they were coming to church that's right and i believe that they people so confused they forget why they come to church lord i want my foundation right i want my foundation right give me jesus or give me nothing see cause sometimes we get we get we wait we it gets so confusing they think people think the church is just a they come to church with some some say i've had people suddenly say well i look for a church with good programs they got a good ministry they got a good uh feed ministry and they got a good nursery but what about the preaching of the gospel you ain't saying nothing about the preacher what you're looking for right i'm looking for some good friends some good fellowship good company good people i can be around they got a real good social club you have missed the point that's why we come to church i was talking earlier about where i come where i come from and bishop john d alexander i was a little boy uh no higher than this that i miss brother jose i use him one of my little boys back there no higher than them boys there i come to church and i was coming up i had asthma real bad in and out of the hospital all the time uh you know suffering with asthma attacks and just that and the other and after the brother the bishop preached i'm the first one in the prayer line they never say why that boy that boy always in the prayer line little boy first one in the prayer line see it used to be a time right after the preaching of the gospel people were convicted and they came to the altar used to be a time the preaching of the gospel would convict people and they would come you didn't even got to be conviction right the preaching of the gospel encouraged your faith and you came to the office say lord i need you amen amen pray for me after almost every server was a problem somebody needed something about the first one there no running pray for me but you know what god hear me that act god hear me ain't no game we playing amen you train them children upright amen train them up right so let's read on him fellowship the shedding of blood uh your wood is right your foundation is right that's right but you just don't be angry with me now you say this may cut just a little bit but it's truth this is what helps you now notice now notice get back to the right foundation now how are we going to get into fellowship brother branham what brings us into fellowship the shading of the blood it was in eden it was over there in job after eden now let's bring it down one or two more places and then we'll hurry and get ready to close now listen close here it is how you get into fellowship how do you get how do you get it how do you ever get into this fellowship through the shedding of the blood not from some experience no sir not from some mental emotion no sir not from some bodily exercise no sir them things are all right as as good as they may be but yet that's not the foundation not the foundation truth leave that set over here to one side till you get back here amen leave that over here till you get back here back here till you get to the altar and the old things are passed away a peace that passes all understanding comes in till you can't you can until you can hate no more you can envy no more until something makes you love your worst enemy you ever had not imagination something that'll keep you from from talking about the neighbor that persecutes you something that'll make you love those who despitefully use you it'll make you pray for those who are indifferent and ugly towards you that's the foundation amen that's the foundation now let's build upon that you see we have to get christ first see we have to take and see i would just recently not too long ago i was remodeling my bathroom out total walls i told the tub i towed everything out total wall down and i got behind that tub and i seen all of that rotten wood i had to get in my crowbar and i'm prying hammering bam and i got to get this out of here i'm not going to put all of this pretty stuff on top of this bad wood let's run tab my tire i'm going to tell all of that bad stuff high and see that's why we come to church lord tear out the bad stuff take the crowbar of god's word and root out of me all of the bitterness take the crowbar of god's word amen and root out all of the jealousy lord take it and give pride and pull it and beat it lord god kick it pull it snatch it do whatever you got to do it may hurt for a little while lord god but i know my foundation is sure amen and i can add on that foundation and be confident that when the wind when the storms and winds are blowing hey my i'm on solid ground amen i got a sure foundation amen my uprights are sure because your whole nose is saying to them that walk up right before him [Music] praise god amen and i know i'm on the word of god amen amen you call me man you come to church he said well i didn't quite never never quite heard it that way you were confused because of the demetrius and the boys want to keep you feeding their money so they introduce all of this garbage to confuse your mind but there's a prophet on the scene one like paul who is living you giving you the spirit of truth you're looking into the face of truth [Music] there was another fellow who looked into the face of truth that rich young ruler he said come follow me that rich young fool looked right into the face of truth and turned it away that's why we don't want truth because we have to give up too much just like the rich young ruler i don't want to give up what i'm doing so i turn my back on truth you're counting it's fall hallelujah pastor was talking about it and a bible study not too long that the worldlyism a lot of people don't want you they don't want to give up them things that's right they want to dress like they want a dress they want to act the way they want to act i don't need no man telling me how i need to dress how i need i need to carry myself but you're building leaning your building's gonna fall over your foundation is wrong built on fables and and and and and and fairy tales there's no solidness there's nothing to it you're going to bring back to god lord i followed the blueprint you didn't follow the group and you did what you wanted to do you did what you made you feel good lord i want to be in your will make me over tear it down to the studs bust up the concrete reform it lord god and point where it's street ain't no lumps in it it ain't leaning a little bit cause if you start out wrong you're going to end up wrong but you got to be willing to put away all your imaginary fables first of all it's got to be in your heart lord i want truth i want to know you lord this is a relationship what kind of relationship you want to have with somebody that you don't truly know i want to know you lord i want to do secret things lord i don't i i i i hear all of this stuff i'm searching for people quit searching for truth i had a fellow i was witnessing two at work he said yeah i don't i don't really know i don't really look for truth because i know we gonna understand it by and by you're gonna understand it all right when you're weeping and wailing and natural teeth you're gonna understand that you missed it because you were presented with truth and you turned it away that's right i hope somebody hear me just like in paul's day than pilot pilot pilot pilot co-pilot he was so he's a lord i don't even know what truth is no more i hear this person over here preaching this they grew up over here they they preach they because see they got they look shrines and they preaching this and and and y'all ain't even got no good church but you say you got truth glory but you say you got truth but truth was laying right there see it didn't come the way it didn't come it didn't come with gold carriages and uh uh uh uh you know bentleys and looking ah coming to the cathedral pipe pipe organs planned uh people think okay yeah this must be truth look at all the money they got but no he came manger he came lowly meek hiding himself from the wise and the prudent and revealing himself to babies such as would learn what is truth are you searching for truth do you want to know truth the bible declares that you shall know truth and the truth has set you free the truth will set you free amen the problem with truth amen as i said before that we we we we look at truth amen and uh we're afraid of it says here in john 14 let not your heart be troubled if ye believe in god believe also in me in my father's house is many mansions if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a plate listen let me tell you the beautiful thing about this house you ain't even building it all you got to do is yield your material to the master's hand he's doing the carving the cutting he's doing he's building it he ain't building his when he when you when you yield and let him build it right you get you out of the way and let him lord build it you know it's gonna be true perfectly level perfectly straight plum true solid amen can withstand why because he build he don't build no general amen the workmen of his hands god mighty and if he go to prepare a place for you when he would come again and receive you unto myself there that where i am ye may be also and whether i go ye not go ye know that the way ye know thomas says unto him lord we know not wither thou goes and how can we know the way jesus said unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me you have to have truth people think the problem today every i ain't been to a funeral yet but people told we were really truth honest i ain't been to a funeral yet man this man could have lived like but you know what it ain't my job to put nobody here ain't gonna put the man in here lord i'm praying for him though good god i'm praying for that fellow lord i hope he made it look the prophet said this right here he says in the in the in the message lady you'll see me say now this messenger of malachi 4. revelation 10 7 is going to do two things one according to malachi 4 he would turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truth that will literally turn your hearts of the children to the pentecostal father exactly so amen it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths good god of mine we don't have the question of what is truth we know what truth is if you are questioning in your heart what is truth let jesus talk to you you have to be willing to put away all of your imaginary fairy tales about who god is you have to be willing to put away with the old lies that you've been taught you have to be willing to be to to do away with the confusion that they have placed on they have fed doubt the demetrius is in the boys and you're confused but truth is here just like truth was there with paul truth will set you free and the bible will become a new book i was sharing with a person the other day because the message was on my heart and i'm just going through it and i always talk to him and i kind of yeah back in revelation and i'm running it back revelation new testament oh he said how do you do that i said because the bible has become a new book it's an open book now until you receive the message of the hours these divinely revealed mystery truths will open amen the book to you amen you'll see it all together different it'll begin to connect amen when when when in construction and i'm getting ready to close the musicians please come when we're my father he would teach me a little bit about construction he was back there building the shed just love to go he would never let me say daddy can i lose a song no boy don't you touch that song he said you're too anxious you want it too bad oh lord i'm doing the cutting but he would always give me one job he would got a chalk line and he he would make a mark he would make a mark on the board over here and he'll measure and he'll make a mark on the board over here and he'd say now hold it on that mark and i'ma hold it on this mark and he pulled that chalk line so we know that it's straight see we got to go back to genesis and find the truth in genesis and make a mark we got to come back to revelations and find the truth in revelation and we make a mark and then everything in the middle you know is right it's got to dovetail from genesis to revelation then you know your line is true if in any way it don't dovetail i go back and re-measure i go back and remember what a friend we have enjoy [Music] jesus [Music] can [Music] rethink god in prayer [Music] a friend we have in jesus our sins and grace [Music] to carry hallelujah [Music] oh what peace oh what needless pains we bear no [Music] because we do not care thank you lord it's the only way we're going to know truth in this hour if there's a question in your heart question in your mind take it to god and pray you may hear these things preach from the pulpit they may sound foreign to you lord i never heard it quite like take it to the lord and pray don't go to it take it to the lord and pray i don't want to tell you don't go to your pastor take it to the lord and pray remember there's demetrius in the land that are trying to keep you confused we are living in the most deceitful age the most deceitful time remember we read there in joshua keep this book of the law meditate therein day and night get back to the foundation fall in love with jesus a true foundation in your heart first of all lord i love you i love you more than i love myself and help me love my brothers and sisters lord the way you see them let's get back to the right foundation most gracious heavenly father we come this morning oh god [Music] thank you for showing us truth and this deceitful hour that we live in we're no great people lord just so humble my brother was saying a humble family started out in a pentecostal church there lord how you just kept the fire burning oh father god and how you just let us oh father god from place to place slaughtered until he came in contact with the one true living god and lord we accept you when our hearts accept you in our lives lord we not didn't do like the rich now take lord we offer our material to everything that we have everything that we are our talents our gifts yield them to your father god you build this house of father god that you dwell in may you dwell o father god may it be reflective of you lord if there's any here in the sound of my voice oh father god the lord god that need a touch from you they heard truth this morning oh lord and lord they want you to tear down the old building [Music] and they want to be made over i pray to your god that you just touched them right now [Music] may they offer the sacrifice of father god of their worship but offer the sacrifice of their their building material father god lord the foundational father god they can't receive anything but on the baptism of the holy ghost i find that in this hour lord people are not hungry for the holy spirit which is the foundation of christianity fill our cups lord with the true baptism of the holy ghost o lord god that we may know father god truth in this hour in this land of confusion oh lord god we ask these blessings in jesus precious name the church say amen [Music] praise the lord [Applause] [Music] i appreciate the word of the lord today from brother troy amen [Applause] [Music] what is truth you know he was um reading a particular quote there where brother branham was saying that we first have to go back and have things right in our heart that that's where it starts and uh just kind of took me to a story that i once heard there was a a gentleman he was a carpenter and worked for a particular man for a number of years and he was ready to retire and his his boss said well before you retire if you don't mind just i'd like to actually build me one more house just build one more house for me and then after that you can retire so he says okay i'll do it and he did it very begrudgingly he's like i told you i want to retire i don't know why you got me doing this so as he start building the house he's taking shortcuts and doing this and doing that and just just really you know didn't do the best job that he possibly could and uh at the end of the process the boss came up to him and said i want to thank you for building this house and the reason i asked you to build this house for me is because all the years that you work for me i want to just let you know how much i appreciate you and this house that you just built now it's your house you got it for free you don't have to pay anything for it and when he realized that he had not put his heart [Music] into it he hurt himself right so it's so important that whatever you do for the lord put your heart into it put your heart into it amen it pays off in the end amen how we appreciate amen uh the word of the lord on today let's sing just a couple courses this song it seems like the holy spirit just had a purpose for us amen i noticed yesterday i was thinking on this song and and uh then didn't know brother troy had it in his notes and sister rachel come out and started the service out with her like there's something to this song and and as we get rid of singing i want to just remind you amen um this song was written from a very very deep place very deep place the man that wrote this song he he had gotten engaged he gave his heart to a young lady got engaged and i think a few uh months before the wedding there was an accident the girl either she fell off a horse and hit her head on the rock and she ended up dying and he was very very distraught he said you know i don't know
