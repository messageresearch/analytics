[37:17] prayer request a couple prayer requests
[37:20] that we want to
[37:24] [Music]
[37:26] take to the lord amen and
[37:30] you know man the devil is alive
[37:33] there was a lie here and
[37:36] um i appreciate so satina's
[37:39] song and her testimony and um
[37:44] i think it's something that you know
[37:45] [Music]
[37:48] we're not just gonna let folk come into
[37:50] the house of the lord
[37:52] and uh
[37:53] [Music]
[37:56] state that there's an issue if you go to
[37:58] the hospital and state that you have an
[37:59] issue they do something about it
[38:02] right but we're not going to allow folk
[38:04] to come to the house of god
[38:06] and state that they have an issue and
[38:07] not do nothing about it
[38:10] all right so uh we're going to lay hands
[38:13] on satin we're going to pray for her
[38:15] and we're going to rebuke that devil in
[38:17] the name of jesus
[38:20] right because that's what the bible told
[38:21] us they they shall
[38:23] lay hands on the sick and the bible say
[38:26] they shall recover praise god so we
[38:30] we're going gonna
[38:31] exercise our authority and the word of
[38:34] god
[38:35] amen and and we have another request so
[38:37] i'm gonna have the brothers come
[38:39] amen uh this morning brother uh
[38:42] troy and uh brother kwaku amen we're
[38:45] gonna pray over
[38:46] these uh two requests that i have here
[38:48] before us
[38:50] we'll anoint with oil and we will pray
[38:52] over the sick brother luke is action
[38:54] prayer
[38:55] uh this morning he says uh he's quoting
[38:58] psalms 103
[39:00] verse 3 a man who forgiveth all thine
[39:03] iniquities who healeth
[39:04] all our diseases
[39:10] that's what god said he forgiveth all of
[39:12] our
[39:13] iniquities and he healeth all our
[39:15] disease see the devil will try to tell
[39:17] you the reason you got your healing
[39:18] because you got sin in your life
[39:19] no god said he forgives all my

[1:01:02] the spirit amen so uh
[1:01:05] just want to start us off here with a
[1:01:08] quote out of it
[1:01:09] it is the rising of the sun
[1:01:13] praise the lord
[1:01:18] uh the prophet um is just
[1:01:21] dealing with a particular uh statement
[1:01:24] here
[1:01:25] that we're gonna kind of try to use to
[1:01:27] draw a little inspiration um
[1:01:29] and just so you know i'm still in the
[1:01:31] channel of
[1:01:32] stepping to the vision and um you know
[1:01:35] we're still in that channel we're still
[1:01:36] pulling from that
[1:01:38] there's a quote that i read last week
[1:01:39] and and i'm reading the exact same quote
[1:01:41] again but bringing it from a different
[1:01:42] angle
[1:01:43] uh but uh let's um let's um uh
[1:01:46] just start with this you say well now
[1:01:48] wait a minute brother branham i know a
[1:01:50] church that well i do too see
[1:01:52] it says but now for instance if we're
[1:01:55] going to go back to tucson this
[1:01:57] afternoon
[1:01:57] now and each one of us was going to go
[1:02:00] in a big cadillac brand new
[1:02:02] and all of the seats were made out of
[1:02:03] dole skin softness of the leather
[1:02:06] uh soft and easy to sit in and the floor
[1:02:09] floorboards were plush the steering
[1:02:12] wheel
[1:02:12] were nickel nickel plated and had
[1:02:14] diamond studs all over it
[1:02:17] and the engine was mechanically tested
[1:02:20] to be exactly the right engine
[1:02:22] and the wheels uh all had bearings and
[1:02:26] greased up and the tires were all
[1:02:28] puncture proof
[1:02:29] and blew out free and all been tested
[1:02:32] scientifically
[1:02:33] they have been pushed off the assembly
[1:02:35] line both of them and both of them
[1:02:36] filled up with gasoline
[1:02:38] uh that's the running power glory the
[1:02:41] gasoline
[1:02:42] is the running power he says that's the
[1:02:44] running power the gasoline because
[1:02:46] it uh because in it is a octane but now
[1:02:49] when you're going to start them
[1:02:52] although both of them look just alike
[1:02:54] but there's one of them
[1:02:56] don't have any spark hallelujah
[1:02:59] glory any firing power amen they can
[1:03:03] look alike but one
[1:03:05] amen if it doesn't have spark or firing
[1:03:07] power
[1:03:08] amen the car you the car will do you no
[1:03:10] good
[1:03:11] praise the lord who want to who want to
[1:03:13] buy car and just sit in a driveway
[1:03:16] trying to look good hey man you buy the
[1:03:19] car so you can go around town a little
[1:03:21] bit
[1:03:22] amen and and show people how the lord
[1:03:24] bless you come on somebody
[1:03:26] amen you have a purpose for having the
[1:03:29] car
[1:03:29] not just to sit in your driveway and
[1:03:31] look good come on somebody
[1:03:33] hey man he said so he said so but
[1:03:35] there's one of them don't have any spark
[1:03:37] any fire power when you say the power
[1:03:40] is in the gasoline brother branham but i
[1:03:43] don't care
[1:03:44] how much power is in
[1:03:47] the gasoline unless there's a spark
[1:03:50] there to manifest that power
[1:03:53] unless there's a power there to confirm
[1:03:55] that it's gasoline
[1:03:57] it just might as well be water
[1:04:01] hallelujah glory to god let's i'm going
[1:04:04] to keep reading here because
[1:04:05] he's going to drop draw us to a little
[1:04:07] point says no matter how much
[1:04:09] theologians claim
[1:04:11] how well you got your church set how
[1:04:14] much
[1:04:14] education you got how much like the
[1:04:17] bible
[1:04:18] until that wave sheath until the holy
[1:04:21] spirit comes upon that person
[1:04:24] to quit him that word look at this he
[1:04:27] says that gasoline
[1:04:29] represents the word it's the truth
[1:04:33] but without the spirit
[1:04:36] hallelujah oh my god without the
[1:04:40] spirit it won't move so brother we're
[1:04:43] not here just trying to bring you quote
[1:04:45] after quote in scripture after scripture
[1:04:47] we want to see the spirit of god come
[1:04:49] and strike the word of god
[1:04:53] hallelujah amen he says we have put
[1:04:57] too much stress on the mechanics
[1:05:00] amen and nothing on the dynamics
[1:05:04] it needs the dynamic power of god the
[1:05:07] resurrection
[1:05:08] power of jesus christ upon the church to
[1:05:10] manifest
[1:05:11] and to bring to pass that this is
[1:05:14] gasoline
[1:05:16] so this morning i want to i want to
[1:05:18] stress some dynamics if we can
[1:05:21] amen he's saying we put too much stress
[1:05:22] on the mechanics but he said we need to
[1:05:24] we need
[1:05:25] he says it's not enough on the dynamic
[1:05:27] power so we want to stress some dynamics
[1:05:29] if we can
[1:05:30] just stay with me here glory to god it
[1:05:32] says it might be in a gasoline cam
[1:05:34] could still be water see but the only
[1:05:37] proof of it is
[1:05:38] put this life on it and it'll prove
[1:05:40] whether it's gasoline
[1:05:42] or not all right so i i i'm starting us
[1:05:45] off here and we're talking about the
[1:05:46] seed word is energized by the spirit
[1:05:49] amen and you know we got to understand
[1:05:51] some things about the
[1:05:53] uh you know the c word glory
[1:05:56] let me uh just kind of skip around here
[1:05:59] i was just um reading there in uh in the
[1:06:02] book of
[1:06:03] mark amen also in the book of luke this
[1:06:06] peril is told
[1:06:07] amen about how a sower goes out and sow
[1:06:10] seed
[1:06:11] amen uh that soul comes out and and he's
[1:06:15] just sprinkling seeds on the ground
[1:06:17] now you gotta understand when it's in
[1:06:19] seat form
[1:06:20] it's not in full manifestation
[1:06:24] praise the lord amen in order for it to
[1:06:26] get to full manifestation

[1:08:36] his friends came up saying now you know

[1:08:42] jesus
[1:08:43] the the the crowd is too big for him to
[1:08:46] hear you
[1:08:46] he said you don't think you can hear me
[1:08:50] jesus
[1:08:58] and as you begin to cry louder and
[1:09:00] louder now you need to understand
[1:09:02] it wasn't that jesus heard his voice
[1:09:07] jesus heard his faith
[1:09:11] and the lord wants to hear your faith
[1:09:15] praise god don't confess your problem
[1:09:18] confess your faith
[1:09:22] yes amen as as blind bottom as begin to
[1:09:27] do something

[1:09:30] encourage you just
[1:09:31] amen say amen to the word respond to the
[1:09:34] word of god
[1:09:35] you'll get the response that you're
[1:09:37] looking for from god
[1:09:39] this jesus told the parable of these
[1:09:42] uh the sower that went out amen to sow
[1:09:45] seed
[1:09:46] and as i said when seed is being sown
[1:09:49] you don't uh you don't see the
[1:09:51] manifestation of what you sowed
[1:09:52] immediately
[1:09:54] you don't see that even even when you
[1:09:56] saw a seed of
[1:09:57] maybe giving an offering amen some of us
[1:09:59] give and we expect to go right
[1:10:01] to the mailbox and get something
[1:10:05] no no god want to test your faith
[1:10:10] you don't wrote a check you're going to
[1:10:11] call at the church and say uh don't cast
[1:10:13] that check
[1:10:15] god testing your faith huh
[1:10:19] glory to god we got faith inside the
[1:10:21] church but when we get out
[1:10:23] no god want to test right what your
[1:10:25] faith is like outside
[1:10:27] are you gonna hold to your confession
[1:10:30] praise god
[1:10:32] no matter how you feel are you going to
[1:10:34] hold to your confession
[1:10:36] glory to god so so so so when this when
[1:10:39] the soul went forth to sow seeds
[1:10:41] and the scripture plainly tells us that
[1:10:43] the seed was
[1:10:45] the word of god amen as the soul was
[1:10:48] sowing seed
[1:10:49] the seed itself was the word of god that
[1:10:51] was being sown
[1:10:53] now uh the problem is jesus gave us a
[1:10:56] man these four
[1:10:57] different atmospheres that the word of
[1:10:59] god could fall in
[1:11:01] hallelujah one of them was called the
[1:11:03] wayside
[1:11:05] hallelujah amen he says and people that
[1:11:08] are
[1:11:08] operating in a wayside atmosphere are
[1:11:11] people that hear the word
[1:11:13] oh glory but immediately after they
[1:11:15] leave church
[1:11:16] satan comes and takes what they heard
[1:11:19] away from them
[1:11:20] now that's that that's that's something
[1:11:22] when the devil can just walk up to you
[1:11:24] and take whatever you
[1:11:26] got you in bad shape
[1:11:30] because the devil's supposed to be under
[1:11:32] your feet
[1:11:35] right amen the devil ain't gonna take
[1:11:37] nothing that god gave me
[1:11:40] let me announce it again i ain't gonna
[1:11:43] let the devil take
[1:11:44] nothing that god gave me
[1:11:48] if he gave me help i'm keeping my health
[1:11:51] if he gave me children i'm keeping my
[1:11:54] children
[1:11:55] if he gave me money i'm keeping my money
[1:11:58] i
[1:11:58] ain't gonna let the devil take nothing
[1:12:00] [Applause]
[1:12:03] glory to god i'm not a wayside believer
[1:12:06] i'm a real believer
[1:12:10] hallelujah somebody amen wayside
[1:12:14] believers they hear the word
[1:12:15] but satan takes it from them immediately
[1:12:19] then you got rocker stony crown
[1:12:21] believers
[1:12:22] amen and these are believers that say
[1:12:25] amen to the words
[1:12:27] they got a big smile on their face as
[1:12:29] the word is coming forth
[1:12:31] man they responded with everything they
[1:12:33] got
[1:12:34] if you don't watch them they'll be
[1:12:36] running around the church in no time
[1:12:41] hallelujah glory to god but because the
[1:12:44] word is not
[1:12:45] rooted amen
[1:12:50] amen these are rocker stoney type
[1:12:52] believers
[1:12:53] because the word is not rooted they felt
[1:12:55] the presence of god
[1:12:57] they heard the voice of god but because
[1:12:59] the word is not
[1:13:01] rooted what happens to them they are
[1:13:03] offended
[1:13:05] with amen when when persecution and
[1:13:07] affliction arises
[1:13:09] they get offended because the word was
[1:13:12] on rocky or stony ground
[1:13:18] i want to just talk about this just for
[1:13:20] a little bit
[1:13:22] before i give you these other two groups
[1:13:24] you know
[1:13:25] um when you plant these seeds hey man
[1:13:28] you you have to
[1:13:29] you have to wait and for for things to
[1:13:32] to become what you envision for it to be
[1:13:36] you know and uh while you wait and other
[1:13:38] things happen
[1:13:40] you know recently we went through a
[1:13:42] little uh
[1:13:43] change of landscape amen uh they're in
[1:13:46] our front yard
[1:13:47] and you know we had a certain way that
[1:13:49] we wanted things to be and you know we
[1:13:51] got somebody to come in and
[1:13:52] and say take this out and plant this in
[1:13:54] and man this is what we want this is
[1:13:56] what we're looking for we and we realize
[1:13:57] we gotta
[1:13:58] buy it in various uh the smaller
[1:14:01] portions of it
[1:14:02] and let it grow into what we want it to
[1:14:03] be and it might take it might take a
[1:14:05] little time that's okay we're willing to
[1:14:07] wait
[1:14:08] but what i found is that uh there are
[1:14:10] other things that get planted
[1:14:13] that i didn't plant
[1:14:16] weeds just come out of nowhere
[1:14:20] i mean i didn't put that there how did
[1:14:23] the weed get there
[1:14:25] come on somebody y'all work with me
[1:14:26] today i didn't plant that
[1:14:29] i didn't buy weeds
[1:14:32] i understand i didn't go spend my money
[1:14:34] on weeds
[1:14:36] but somehow we got next to what i
[1:14:39] planted
[1:14:40] and what i found about weeds is that if
[1:14:42] you're not careful they will take over
[1:14:45] what you actually planted the weed is
[1:14:48] starting some way
[1:14:49] off distance place and then it just
[1:14:52] starts weaving its way
[1:14:54] right next to the thing that you planted
[1:14:56] come on somebody
[1:14:58] and you got to go rip it out brother
[1:15:00] josue
[1:15:01] you gotta get it at the root pull that
[1:15:04] thing out
[1:15:06] but when it's next to the thing that you
[1:15:09] planted you got to be
[1:15:10] careful because you might destroy the
[1:15:12] thing that you planted as well
[1:15:14] [Applause]
[1:15:16] but nonetheless you got to get the weeds
[1:15:18] out
[1:15:21] i believe the holy ghost is here
[1:15:24] to get the weeds out the church we could
[1:15:27] be planting the word seed but every once
[1:15:30] in a while
[1:15:30] a reader come in there
[1:15:34] the holy ghost will take care of that
[1:15:35] wheat amen we're gonna keep what we
[1:15:38] planted
[1:15:39] god gonna keep what he planted but he
[1:15:41] gonna get rid of your weeds
[1:15:45] can i tell you something weeds are there
[1:15:48] to destroy the sea
[1:15:57] but god ain't gonna let no weed take
[1:15:59] care take take over his seeds
[1:16:01] all right
[1:16:04] so we got wayside believers we got
[1:16:08] rock of stony ground believers amen then
[1:16:11] we also got these beliefs we call
[1:16:13] thorns glory to gods
[1:16:16] amen these thorns according to the
[1:16:18] scripture
[1:16:19] they hear the words amen
[1:16:22] they rejoice in the words hallelujah
[1:16:26] but by what the bible tells us in luke i
[1:16:28] mean it's our mark 4
[1:16:29] 19 amen the bible gives us some
[1:16:32] something here says

[1:16:50] world
[1:16:53] and look at this and the deceitfulness
[1:16:58] see i see as a believer we talked about
[1:17:00] this last week it's impossible
[1:17:04] for me to be deceived but there's
[1:17:07] authority group hallelujah they rejoice
[1:17:11] when the word comes forth they also run

[1:17:26] but the cares of this world
[1:17:29] and notice this the deceitfulness of
[1:17:32] riches

[1:24:39] brother carlos amen all the way in in
[1:24:41] honduras is that right
[1:24:42] amen in honduras amen has this dream
[1:24:45] about our church and brother carlos was
[1:24:48] here
[1:24:48] back in january god god sent him here
[1:24:51] right amen just for a few weeks and
[1:24:53] and uh and brother carlos was here and
[1:24:55] and uh and uh he was
[1:24:56] you know he we didn't know he was a
[1:24:58] singer but once we found out man we let
[1:24:59] him sing let him do whatever he do
[1:25:01] brother brother josue have to interpret
[1:25:03] for him but hear the man don't really
[1:25:04] even speak english as a first language
[1:25:07] amen but but here he goes back home to
[1:25:09] honduras and god gives him a dream and
[1:25:11] says in a dream
[1:25:12] i saw myself amen picking up a guitar
[1:25:15] and they gave me the guitar and told me
[1:25:16] to play the song but i couldn't catch
[1:25:18] the rhythm
[1:25:20] it says i couldn't catch the rhythm i
[1:25:21] don't i don't know why i couldn't catch
[1:25:23] the rhythm
[1:25:24] it says uh it says but then the pastor's
[1:25:27] mother
[1:25:28] he didn't know a name he said the
[1:25:29] pastor's mother went to the piano and
[1:25:31] start playing
[1:25:32] after i couldn't catch the rhythm she
[1:25:34] start playing the piano
[1:25:36] now you know when i first heard it i'm
[1:25:37] like uh my mama don't play no piano
[1:25:41] right but you you can't apply natural
[1:25:43] thinking to spiritual things
[1:25:47] we were just waiting so you know brother
[1:25:49] quaker had shattered with me and
[1:25:51] and we were just praying over it and and
[1:25:53] just waiting to see what the lord would
[1:25:54] do
[1:25:55] hallelujah and then uh we watched some
[1:25:58] things unfold
[1:26:00] and and brother josue told uh a family
[1:26:03] saying now i don't invite people to my
[1:26:04] church
[1:26:06] now y'all thought that was a strange
[1:26:07] thing that he said but no that was
[1:26:10] ordained of god for him to say it just
[1:26:11] like that
[1:26:12] i don't invite people to my church now
[1:26:15] now now and and brother said now why i
[1:26:18] wonder why he'll invite people to his
[1:26:19] church
[1:26:20] he's saying now what if i want to come
[1:26:22] to your church can i come he say yes
[1:26:24] if you want to come you can come but i
[1:26:27] don't invite people to my church
[1:26:30] now he knew what he was saying because
[1:26:32] brother jose knew this was a word
[1:26:34] church if you're not serious about the
[1:26:36] word you'll leave
[1:26:38] i just gave you them four groups
[1:26:44] i'm putting you back in the word now i'm
[1:26:46] we not playing games
[1:26:49] we trying to get people ready for
[1:26:51] rapture
[1:26:54] if you want to play games in church
[1:26:55] there's many of them out here that play
[1:26:57] games
[1:26:58] but if you want the truth because the
[1:26:59] bible say ye shall know the truth
[1:27:01] and the truth will make you free
[1:27:05] free from your bondage free from your
[1:27:07] addictions free from anything that the
[1:27:10] devil
[1:27:10] might have in your path brother so i say
[1:27:13] i don't
[1:27:14] i don't invite people to my church now
[1:27:15] but if you want to come you're welcome
[1:27:16] to come
[1:27:17] well we want to come family showed up
[1:27:21] and we were just having church and the
[1:27:22] brothers was preaching was going through

[1:27:27] services and
[1:27:28] you know and and the family just come
[1:27:29] and just enjoy and i remember when the
[1:27:31] brother said i just love it when the
[1:27:32] brother talked about we got these

[1:27:38] brother troy used terms like that we got
[1:27:39] nuggets here
[1:27:41] university i just like them nuggets i'm
[1:27:43] i'm trying to
[1:27:44] bring it all together for y'all he said
[1:27:47] i love i
[1:27:48] love them terms i love that i love that
[1:27:50] i said just i never heard things like
[1:27:52] that we got these nuggets that we
[1:27:53] polishing up and we give them
[1:27:55] it's just revelation from the word of
[1:27:56] god that's what we're talking about when
[1:27:58] we say nuggets hallelujah
[1:28:00] so you know we're going on we're going
[1:28:02] on and and and just because we
[1:28:04] the way that we were doing the services
[1:28:06] the services that they would come i
[1:28:07] would never be preaching
[1:28:09] never it just worked out and i would try
[1:28:11] to tell them i'm gonna preach on such
[1:28:12] and such a day you might want to come
[1:28:14] that day and i already knew
[1:28:16] i knew the series that i was in i knew
[1:28:19] the quotes that were coming
[1:28:21] i knew that now i had a choice either to
[1:28:24] bypass the quote
[1:28:27] right or say what god say if the angel
[1:28:31] wrote it then i'm going to say what the
[1:28:33] angel said
[1:28:37] praise the lord oh hallelujah right
[1:28:40] so so so uh you know as a family's
[1:28:42] coming and then i i come
[1:28:44] and i came with a hard sermon that day
[1:28:46] i'm telling everybody i'm warning you
[1:28:49] warning you i will preach what the word
[1:28:51] of god say
[1:28:53] i i will not shun to declare
[1:28:57] the whole council of god
[1:29:02] now i might not do it every sunday but
[1:29:05] if you sit here
[1:29:06] long enough this word gonna find you
[1:29:08] where you at
[1:29:10] and we're gonna find out what kind of
[1:29:12] ground you are
[1:29:16] now the ones that you see been sitting
[1:29:18] here for a long time
[1:29:19] under that type of reaching you know
[1:29:21] their good ground
[1:29:26] amen because who the lord loves
[1:29:29] he chases and he corrects them
[1:29:32] if you ain't never been corrected by the
[1:29:34] word of god you can't claim that god
[1:29:36] loves you
[1:29:40] all right i i i might not get back to my
[1:29:43] subject but i'ma go as far as i can
[1:29:46] i want to show how the c word is
[1:29:48] energized by the spirits
[1:29:50] right but i got to get these things so
[1:29:51] that the church understand where we're
[1:29:53] at
[1:29:54] hey man we're not here just kind of
[1:29:55] going through motions
[1:29:57] right but god is doing something god has
[1:29:59] assembled this group here

[1:30:04] you know uh that's something i preach
[1:30:06] and my lord i knew
[1:30:09] and i i mean i might as well be oh yeah
[1:30:12] i might as well say
[1:30:13] i i i i i made a statement i went right
[1:30:16] back to deuteronomy 22
[1:30:21] and 5. if y'all if i
[1:30:24] i can read it for you

[1:30:30] know some people say oh that's
[1:30:32] old testament well what happened in the
[1:30:36] garden of eden is also
[1:30:37] old testament thou shall not kill its
[1:30:40] old testament
[1:30:41] thou shall not commit adultery is old
[1:30:44] testament
[1:30:46] huh thou shall not you know bear false
[1:30:48] witness that's
[1:30:49] old testament there's a lot of things in
[1:30:51] the old testament that
[1:30:52] amen even even the promise of uh uh uh
[1:30:55] he was wounded for my transgressions and
[1:30:57] bruce when i iniquited
[1:30:59] chastising my pieces upon him with his
[1:31:01] stripes i'm here
[1:31:02] you shall over that but that's old
[1:31:05] testament
[1:31:07] [Applause]
[1:31:09] no weapon formed against me will prosper
[1:31:12] and every tongue that rides against me
[1:31:14] thou will be condemned you shout over
[1:31:16] that
[1:31:17] but that's old testament
[1:31:21] [Music]
[1:31:23] amen i'm the lord that healeth all
[1:31:28] my diseases you shot over that
[1:31:31] [Music]

[1:32:00] in the house of the lord
[1:32:03] forever you shout over that
[1:32:13] but that's old testament see what we got
[1:32:15] here is a problem
[1:32:17] the problem is some people just want
[1:32:18] certain parts of the scripture
[1:32:20] but not all parts of the scripture
[1:32:23] but here at spirit and truth tabernacle
[1:32:25] we're going to give you old testament
[1:32:26] and new testament
[1:32:28] because it's a double bear shotgun
[1:32:32] [Applause]
[1:32:35] we're going to take the devil out with
[1:32:36] these promises if god wrote it in the
[1:32:39] old testament it's still applicable
[1:32:40] today
[1:32:41] amen jesus did not come to do away with
[1:32:44] the law
[1:32:46] he actually magnified it how how how did
[1:32:48] he do that brother jack because he said
[1:32:50] you have heard
[1:32:52] that thou shalt not commit adultery you
[1:32:54] have heard that means
[1:32:55] it was written in the old testament you
[1:32:57] have heard
[1:32:59] he says but i say
[1:33:04] i say unto you he that looketh upon
[1:33:08] a woman and lusteth in his heart
[1:33:11] has committed adultery already
[1:33:14] he never even touched her he only looked
[1:33:17] at her
[1:33:17] and it was committed it was called
[1:33:19] adultery in jesus eyes
[1:33:22] so he didn't do away with the old
[1:33:23] testament he magnified it
[1:33:27] that's why the sisters shouldn't dress a
[1:33:28] certain way
[1:33:30] that's why we preached uh deuteronomy 22
[1:33:32] 5
[1:33:33] that a woman not supposed to wear
[1:33:34] garments pertaining to a man and notice
[1:33:36] the bible say
[1:33:37] as pertaining to a man woman shall not
[1:33:39] wear that which pertaineth unto a man
[1:33:42] if a man would wear it a woman not
[1:33:44] supposed to wear it
[1:33:45] amen look at this and neither shall a
[1:33:48] man put on a woman's garment
[1:33:51] and y'all know that's coming out news
[1:33:52] all the time men wearing women's
[1:33:54] underwear and all kind of nasty filthy
[1:33:56] things going on
[1:33:57] all over the world you know it's the
[1:33:58] truth amen
[1:34:00] amen hallelujah it still looks strange
[1:34:02] for me to see a man walking down the
[1:34:04] street with a skirt on
[1:34:07] as soon as i see a man with a skirt i
[1:34:09] know now there's some cultures maybe one
[1:34:11] or two
[1:34:13] well they do that but they don't do it
[1:34:14] all the time maybe at a
[1:34:16] parade or something they'll do it and
[1:34:18] that's part of their culture and some
[1:34:19] people have been able to accept that but
[1:34:21] you know you don't find others just
[1:34:22] running out there doing that
[1:34:24] and i might as well call his name
[1:34:27] because you know they got this thing say
[1:34:28] his name right
[1:34:29] say they name it y'all follow that
[1:34:32] praise god
[1:34:32] in the in any how i'ma say his name from
[1:34:35] a different perspective though
[1:34:37] and y'all follow this dwayne wade fella
[1:34:39] [Applause]
[1:34:40] [Music]
[1:34:45] dwyane wade trying to support his son
[1:34:48] now now it's one thing to love your son
[1:34:50] in the midst of their sin i understand
[1:34:51] that but you're going way too far
[1:34:54] he want to walk around with skirts on
[1:34:56] and stuff like this now too
[1:34:58] and in support of his son
[1:35:05] praise the lord i said his name
[1:35:12] and i'm not saying that ain't nothing on
[1:35:13] the internet it's right there
[1:35:15] i mean he walking around with skirts on
[1:35:18] i think
[1:35:19] russell westbrook i think might have did
[1:35:21] it too one time i mean these guys these
[1:35:23] these basketball uh mega stars that we
[1:35:25] trying to be like they come out dressed
[1:35:27] any kind
[1:35:28] of way a homosexual garment song
[1:35:31] hallelujah we just be watching them
[1:35:35] all right the woman shall not wear that
[1:35:38] which pertains unto a man neither shall
[1:35:39] a man put it on a woman's garment for
[1:35:41] all that do
[1:35:42] so are abomination unto the lord god
[1:35:45] now also over in the book of revelation
[1:35:47] it said that those that commit
[1:35:48] abomination
[1:35:49] will not inherit the kingdom of god
[1:35:54] i'm not i'm not i'm not here writing
[1:35:58] scripture
[1:35:59] i'm here quoting scripture and i'm here
[1:36:02] living scripture amen
[1:36:06] and i set you up real good all them
[1:36:08] other old testament scriptures that
[1:36:09] people
[1:36:10] quote in church but then when it comes
[1:36:12] to things like that oh that's old
[1:36:14] testament

[1:36:18] choose what you want
[1:36:20] we either take it all uh or none of it
[1:36:23] and let me tell you that when you take
[1:36:24] all this work it will become bitter to
[1:36:26] the belly
[1:36:29] but you got to keep it down and uh
[1:36:32] and when i start dressing the way that
[1:36:34] i'm supposed to the way
[1:36:36] the word of god tells me to dress when i
[1:36:38] start dressing that way
[1:36:39] you know you're going to go through some
[1:36:40] offenses people are going to come
[1:36:43] against you
[1:36:44] people are going to say you don't lost
[1:36:45] your mind but i just read to you about
[1:36:47] them four groups

[1:37:00] bring forth fruit and patience
[1:37:03] all right where was i

[1:37:17] that's what was in the vision
[1:37:20] and so you know here you know i preached
[1:37:22] it and

[1:37:32] day i didn't know she was sitting down i
[1:37:33] didn't
[1:37:34] know but let me act let me just tell you
[1:37:35] something just because you come like
[1:37:37] that don't mean i got to change my
[1:37:39] message
[1:37:41] i still got to say what god told me to
[1:37:42] say right
[1:37:44] i didn't know i but i do i'm a little
[1:37:47] older than a lot of people in here
[1:37:48] i do remember a time that people did not
[1:37:50] go to church and pants
[1:37:52] not even for choir rehearsal
[1:37:55] not even for choir hustle
[1:38:03] [Music]
[1:38:05] before they went into the house of god i
[1:38:08] know churches have let down the bars
[1:38:12] y'all ain't gonna let me talk in here
[1:38:17] when i was coming up my grandma church
[1:38:19] women did not wear pants
[1:38:21] i'm talking about pentecost did not
[1:38:25] wear pants and that was the only
[1:38:28] place you could find them baptists had
[1:38:29] gave up a long time ago
[1:38:32] but pentecost no no
[1:38:36] what happened is that the pentecostal
[1:38:37] skirts start getting a little shorter
[1:38:40] shorter the next thing you know they
[1:38:41] start wearing pants in a pentecostal
[1:38:43] church
[1:38:44] prophesying in pants
[1:38:47] peace speaking in tongues in pants
[1:38:50] things that the holy ghost used to
[1:38:51] condemn
[1:38:52] amen i'm talking about my day
[1:38:56] nah it's just so accepted but you know
[1:39:00] and and granted if somebody were to walk
[1:39:02] in here it's not like i'm gonna just
[1:39:03] come up here and just go out off on them
[1:39:05] like that i'm not gonna do that
[1:39:06] i'm gonna be gracious i will read that
[1:39:09] scripture at some point in time
[1:39:12] praise the lord just so you know where
[1:39:13] we stand when you when you start looking
[1:39:15] how come none of these sisters wear
[1:39:16] their pants around here i'm showing you
[1:39:18] why
[1:39:19] it's in the bible that's why we don't do
[1:39:20] it so we did that you know
[1:39:23] i preached that and and and boy that was
[1:39:25] that was that was a
[1:39:27] it was i knew it was rough but you know
[1:39:29] the good thing about after i preached
[1:39:30] that because some
[1:39:31] you know i'm gonna tell you what most
[1:39:32] people would do after i preach a sermon
[1:39:34] like that
[1:39:34] you would not want to talk to me no more
[1:39:36] you wouldn't want to see me no more i
[1:39:38] ain't never going back to church anymore
[1:39:39] but you know what that family did they
[1:39:40] invited me for dinner
[1:39:44] after i preached such a hard sermon they
[1:39:46] invited me to dinner i went straight to
[1:39:48] the house in the middle of a pandemic
[1:39:50] to go have dinner and we just begin to
[1:39:54] share lord god i don't know i'm saying
[1:39:56] all this and i don't know if i'm
[1:39:57] supposed to be saying it but i i just
[1:39:59] this is a part of a vision i even shared
[1:40:01] the vision with them that night
[1:40:06] and as as as i shared the vision i said
[1:40:09] you know this is what happened this is
[1:40:10] what happened
[1:40:11] and you know we were just still just
[1:40:12] fellowshipping and working with them
[1:40:14] because i still believe god didn't let
[1:40:16] him come here for nothing
[1:40:18] so i still pray for that family
[1:40:21] religiously
[1:40:22] it's just god gotta open people's eyes
[1:40:25] flesh and blood can't do it god got to
[1:40:27] do it so i pray for revelation
[1:40:29] i pray that you'll run run so ragged
[1:40:32] trying to find a church that you realize
[1:40:35] ain't but one place to go amen
[1:40:40] so we went through that and why was
[1:40:42] sister birds in the dream
[1:40:44] playing the piano mrs birds called me up
[1:40:47] a couple weeks later and said i just had
[1:40:49] this remarkable conversation with two
[1:40:51] co-workers of mine
[1:40:52] we had three hours of conversation i
[1:40:54] just began to share with them my journey
[1:40:56] of how i came to the message of the hour
[1:40:59] walked them through baptists walked them
[1:41:00] through pentecost walking through
[1:41:02] how did i get to where i am right now
[1:41:05] and she began to share with them to
[1:41:06] say they was on a zoom called zoom cut

[1:41:10] you go past your time but this time zoom

[1:41:13] call
[1:41:15] zoom cut that one off they started
[1:41:16] another one cut that they say we still
[1:41:18] want to hear let me let us just call you
[1:41:20] on the telephone
[1:41:22] got it i threw away going and mama just
[1:41:24] breaking this down breaking that down
[1:41:25] breaking this down bro
[1:41:26] and she just she was just i mean she was
[1:41:28] elated with just the freedom that god
[1:41:30] gave her to be able to share the truth
[1:41:33] and she had prayed that god would give
[1:41:34] her an open door
[1:41:35] god gave her that open door and both of
[1:41:37] these ladies was just receiving the word
[1:41:40] i mean got into talking about serpent
[1:41:42] seed on the phone
[1:41:45] one of the sisters she said um
[1:41:48] she said um uh you know that serpent
[1:41:51] sees like you know
[1:41:52] and and and for y'all that don't know
[1:41:56] i'm just i'm have to i'm give you the
[1:41:57] fast version
[1:41:59] the fast version eve did not
[1:42:02] eat an apple eve
[1:42:05] did not eat an apricot
[1:42:09] eve did not eat a natural fruit to get
[1:42:12] pregnant
[1:42:15] eve committed adultery
[1:42:19] now there was only two humans in the
[1:42:21] garden so who
[1:42:23] who could she commit adultery with
[1:42:26] adam and eve was only two humans who
[1:42:29] could eve commit
[1:42:30] adultery with it's very easy it's in the
[1:42:34] bible
[1:42:35] because god came down saying now who
[1:42:37] told y'all y'all was naked
[1:42:40] now now why would they eat a fruit come
[1:42:42] on y'all just y'all i'm all over it
[1:42:44] if they would eat a fruit and they found
[1:42:47] out there was naked
[1:42:48] the bible say that when they when they
[1:42:49] covered their nakeds they covet
[1:42:51] the midsection not their mouth
[1:42:57] so that if you cover your midsection
[1:42:59] something unhappened down there
[1:43:02] y'all ain't gonna talk to me yet
[1:43:03] [Music]
[1:43:05] and when god began to give out the
[1:43:07] punishments he said adam what happened
[1:43:09] because adam didn't show up to church
[1:43:10] one day
[1:43:12] everybody knows something wrong when you
[1:43:13] ain't coming to church
[1:43:17] no matter how much you shout everybody
[1:43:19] knows something wrong when you don't
[1:43:20] come to church
[1:43:21] come on somebody right so so so so god
[1:43:24] god said adam adam what happened here
[1:43:26] say this woman you gave me
[1:43:30] i ain't asked for her you gave it to me
[1:43:32] she brought this thing to me brought me
[1:43:33] you know this is it's her fault then god
[1:43:36] looked at eve say
[1:43:37] what happened say the serpent
[1:43:40] beguiled me i said it was only two
[1:43:44] humans
[1:43:45] adam and eve well what was this serpent
[1:43:50] then
[1:43:52] because we found out something in
[1:43:53] scripture go back and read your bible
[1:43:55] i'ma say it again
[1:43:56] if churches can't get genesis right
[1:44:00] they ain't gonna get nothing else right
[1:44:04] but what happened in the bible this
[1:44:06] serpent was cursed
[1:44:08] now before the curse
[1:44:12] how did he stand because after the curse
[1:44:14] he went on his belly
[1:44:16] but before the curse he stood on two
[1:44:19] feet now don't get don't get don't get
[1:44:21] don't let that bother you like that
[1:44:23] don't let that bother you
[1:44:24] you got to understand what a prophet's
[1:44:26] job is
[1:44:28] how many got a bible in here how many
[1:44:29] got a bible how many got a bible
[1:44:31] you got a bible the first five books of
[1:44:33] your bible was written by who
[1:44:36] how did moses know what happened in the
[1:44:38] garden of eden he went there
[1:44:41] because god showed him as a prophet what
[1:44:44] happened in the garden of eden you
[1:44:46] believe
[1:44:46] moses now you know moses actually did
[1:44:49] not write he just told us that the
[1:44:50] serpent got cursed but he didn't tell us
[1:44:51] that he stood on two feet
[1:44:53] it took another prophet
[1:44:59] a prophet that's supposed to restore all
[1:45:01] things
[1:45:03] according to what jesus said that
[1:45:06] prophet tells you
[1:45:07] what happened in the garden of eden just
[1:45:10] like moses said it
[1:45:14] it says he stood on two feet and they
[1:45:16] got cursed and put on his belly
[1:45:19] now i went through church for years
[1:45:20] trying to figure out what happened in
[1:45:21] the garden
[1:45:22] and when i heard a prophet say that
[1:45:24] something on the inside
[1:45:26] struck i'm like glory to god
[1:45:30] i need you to know something the word
[1:45:32] was already in you
[1:45:34] before you even heard this the reason
[1:45:37] that you could say
[1:45:38] a man to it is because it was already
[1:45:41] inside of you
[1:45:42] you had questions that never got
[1:45:45] answered you done been
[1:45:46] to so many bible studies ain't nobody
[1:45:49] never said
[1:45:50] nothing like this but when you heard
[1:45:52] truth you connected with that
[1:45:54] but now you need the spirit to come and
[1:45:58] quicken
[1:45:59] what was on the inside of you and the
[1:46:02] seed words
[1:46:03] will be energized by the spirit
[1:46:13] [Music]
[1:46:14] sister birds told that that dream and
[1:46:17] next thing you know
[1:46:18] i'd say i say invite both of those
[1:46:20] co-workers to church
[1:46:23] she invited them one that said i watch
[1:46:26] online
[1:46:28] the other say i i'm coming to church
[1:46:32] and who walked in
[1:46:35] spanish family
[1:46:39] why did god use a spanish brother in
[1:46:41] honduras
[1:46:43] to have this dream because god was
[1:46:45] trying to tell us something
[1:46:47] see what i'm going to tell you this and
[1:46:48] i said this before this is not a
[1:46:50] i'm going to use a term like this this
[1:46:52] is not a ethnic
[1:46:54] church
[1:46:58] i'ma go a little further this is not a
[1:47:02] black
[1:47:02] church
[1:47:07] this is a christian church
[1:47:10] [Music]
[1:47:15] and we've all no matter what our origin
[1:47:17] i mean our
[1:47:18] uh uh culture or ethnicity
[1:47:22] is we got a greater ethnicity
[1:47:25] than what they have defined us as
[1:47:29] it's greater than skin color this goes
[1:47:32] back to us
[1:47:33] being in the mind of god and coming
[1:47:36] as thoughts of god to fellowship in this
[1:47:39] place
[1:47:42] so here you'll see everything
[1:47:45] i'm telling you're going to see it all
[1:47:48] because that's what we are yeah
[1:47:50] and and we will not allow anybody to
[1:47:52] make somebody else feel less
[1:47:56] and when we have we have a big eat we
[1:47:59] eat
[1:48:00] praise the lord your culture you know we
[1:48:03] don't eat no
[1:48:04] no no no no not here not here we eat
[1:48:07] praise the lord glory glory glory
[1:48:11] i eat rice and beans i eat collard
[1:48:14] greens
[1:48:15] praise the lord amen i eat vegan
[1:48:19] but i'll eat
[1:48:26] well i just like putting the devil on
[1:48:28] the run
[1:48:30] i hate him i hate him i i i don't want
[1:48:32] nobody to leave here thinking it's a
[1:48:34] black church no it's not
[1:48:35] it's a christian church
[1:48:38] amen hallelujah
[1:48:43] so we saw that
[1:48:46] these things all they were doing just
[1:48:48] stepping into a vision
[1:48:50] and here we are we find ourselves kind
[1:48:52] of stepping into this vision
[1:48:54] i i want to um i had some other things
[1:48:56] here to say let me just read this quote
[1:48:58] because this
[1:48:59] seed word is energized by the spirit
[1:49:00] pyramid church age is where i'm at
[1:49:02] and let me just see if i can try to find
[1:49:05] a way to get
[1:49:06] get us home now i'ma just
[1:49:09] what i try to do is preach about an hour
[1:49:11] and 15 minutes that's that's really what
[1:49:12] i try to do i set a timer for myself
[1:49:14] now most churches you can go to and get
[1:49:16] a get a message in about 20 minutes and
[1:49:18] they'll be gone
[1:49:19] that's good that's what i call fast food
[1:49:21] service
[1:49:26] and sometimes i eat fast food sometimes
[1:49:29] but it ain't good for me
[1:49:42] we're not here trying to get people in
[1:49:43] and out as fast as they can
[1:49:45] we're trying to get people closer to god
[1:49:47] i'm not going to try to keep you here
[1:49:48] all day
[1:49:49] amen and i'm not going to try to make
[1:49:51] nothing happen either just let god come
[1:49:53] and do what he want to do
[1:49:54] so let me just give it just give me a
[1:49:55] few more minutes just to make a you know
[1:49:57] look
[1:49:58] according to my my clock i got 26 more
[1:50:00] minutes
[1:50:02] all right praise the lord and that's
[1:50:04] only if i started on time
[1:50:06] if i started late then praise the lord
[1:50:08] forgive me
[1:50:11] fr per game church age is where i want
[1:50:13] to read from i read this last week
[1:50:15] now um we got to understand that
[1:50:18] uh there is a false church and a true
[1:50:21] church
[1:50:22] they're both growing at the same time
[1:50:24] amen this is why
[1:50:26] let me take that down just for a second
[1:50:28] uh from the days
[1:50:30] of uh cain and abel
[1:50:33] worship has been involved praise the
[1:50:36] lord
[1:50:36] where satan has been involved in the
[1:50:38] midst of it i read last week how he came
[1:50:40] down out of heaven and he wanted to
[1:50:41] exalt himself of other stars of god
[1:50:43] right but but satan has been involved
[1:50:45] from the days of
[1:50:46] of cain and abel kane
[1:50:50] was of that wicked one that's what the
[1:50:53] bible said cain was not adam's son
[1:50:56] but cain was eve's son so let me finish
[1:50:59] that thought because maybe that's why
[1:51:00] the lord brought it back
[1:51:02] eve had a relationship with the serpent
[1:51:04] because the serpent stood on two feet
[1:51:06] like a man before his curse that's what
[1:51:09] a prophet shared with us
[1:51:11] the serpent stood on two feet like a man
[1:51:13] before he got cursed and put on his
[1:51:14] belly so the serpent could actually have
[1:51:16] relations with a serpent
[1:51:18] and bring forth a serpent or the serpent
[1:51:20] could have relations with a human
[1:51:22] and bring something something mixed up
[1:51:27] it won't be full human it'll be half
[1:51:29] human half animal
[1:51:32] that's what cain was hallelujah
[1:51:36] that's what kane was he was half human
[1:51:39] half animal
[1:51:42] and i and i i got another thing to share
[1:51:44] with you too
[1:51:46] here in that condition he was a twin
[1:51:54] he was a twin amen because eve
[1:51:57] actually got pregnant by the serpent and
[1:52:00] by adam
[1:52:01] at the same time and brought forth twins
[1:52:04] one named kane
[1:52:05] one named abel and eve when she got her
[1:52:08] name
[1:52:09] notice what the bible says i think it's
[1:52:10] genesis 4 15 it says
[1:52:12] eve was the mother of all
[1:52:16] living but it did not say adam was the
[1:52:19] father of all living
[1:52:22] you got to watch this bible you had to
[1:52:25] watch this bible
[1:52:27] pray everything means something in the
[1:52:29] scripture
[1:52:30] right but eve been the mother of all
[1:52:32] living
[1:52:33] right and when you look at that adam
[1:52:35] knew his wife
[1:52:36] and the second time adam knew his wife
[1:52:38] was when when they brought forth seth
[1:52:40] so there was twins that were born
[1:52:42] hallelujah
[1:52:44] but here god gives them some instruction
[1:52:47] and and you know and they wanted to
[1:52:49] worship god so
[1:52:51] cain goes and gets all the fruit of the
[1:52:53] ground and all this stuff he's like man
[1:52:54] i'm going
[1:52:55] i'm going to worship god in this
[1:52:56] beautiful place i'm sent me a little alt
[1:52:58] up and
[1:52:59] and and i'm gonna give god my best he
[1:53:01] actually thought it was his best
[1:53:03] able to say you know what i'm gonna give
[1:53:05] myself a lamb and i'm gonna slay that
[1:53:07] thing and
[1:53:07] and i'm gonna take the blood and take it
[1:53:09] up there to god and see if god gonna
[1:53:10] take this
[1:53:11] and he brings his lamb i mean first cain
[1:53:13] come up with all this beautiful stuff
[1:53:14] and
[1:53:15] god gosh that's not what i'm calling for
[1:53:18] and then here come abel with his lamb
[1:53:20] and all this blood all over the altar
[1:53:22] just looked like a mess
[1:53:24] cain looked and said why would you do
[1:53:25] something like this son why would you do
[1:53:27] this to to
[1:53:28] i mean in the presence of god and god
[1:53:30] said this is exactly what i was looking
[1:53:32] for
[1:53:32] this bloody mess and then he told cain
[1:53:35] and say if you give me the same thing
[1:53:37] your brother just gave
[1:53:38] me i will accept it
[1:53:42] but rather than cain give god what he
[1:53:45] asked for
[1:53:46] cain decided i'm gonna kill my brother
[1:53:49] where you think murder came from his
[1:53:52] daddy
[1:53:58] hallelujah so we see these things in
[1:54:01] scripture and
[1:54:03] we have to just you know we gotta
[1:54:04] understand that they're at those
[1:54:07] two altars these two spirits there was a
[1:54:10] false
[1:54:11] church represented there was a true
[1:54:13] church represented there was something
[1:54:15] god was accepting and there was
[1:54:17] something god was rejecting
[1:54:18] all the way down to today
[1:54:23] there's there's a worship that god is
[1:54:25] accepting and there's a worship that
[1:54:27] god's rejecting
[1:54:28] and i can tell you the one that he's
[1:54:29] accepting
[1:54:33] i can tell you what he's looking for
[1:54:36] i can tell you what he's seeking
[1:54:42] amen the hour cometh
[1:54:46] and now is when true
[1:54:49] worshipers the true worshipers
[1:54:54] shall worship the father
[1:54:57] in spirit and truth
[1:55:00] for the father seeketh such to worship
[1:55:02] him
[1:55:04] when i go to rapture and faith
[1:55:06] tabernacle i'm worshiping in spirit and
[1:55:08] truth
[1:55:10] when i go to miami believers i'm
[1:55:12] worshiping
[1:55:13] in spirit and in truth when i go to
[1:55:15] bride of christ tabernacle i'm
[1:55:17] worshiping
[1:55:18] in spirit and in truth when i go to
[1:55:21] eagle's temple
[1:55:22] i am worshiping in spirit and in truth
[1:55:25] when i go to bible truth tabernacle
[1:55:27] i am worshiping in spirit and in truth
[1:55:30] when i go to victory tabernacle
[1:55:33] i am worshiping in spirit and in truth
[1:55:39] when i go to fellowship with the saints
[1:55:40] in sarasota i'm worshiping in spirit
[1:55:44] and in truth and when i come to spirit
[1:55:48] and truth tabernacle
[1:55:53] [Applause]
[1:55:54] i am worshiping in spirit
[1:55:58] and in truth
[1:56:06] so this quote says in programming church
[1:56:09] age how can you tell the spirit's part
[1:56:10] because there's two there's a false
[1:56:12] and a real false and a real but how can
[1:56:14] you tell
[1:56:15] the spirit's part
[1:56:18] the prophet gives us the answer he says
[1:56:20] just give them the word test
[1:56:22] that's how you know where they are if
[1:56:24] they can't take the word then you
[1:56:25] already know something wrong with them
[1:56:27] i'm talking about genesis and revelation
[1:56:28] they got to be able to take the word
[1:56:29] says just give them the word test
[1:56:31] if they don't speak that word they are
[1:56:34] of the evil one
[1:56:35] as the evil one deceived the first two
[1:56:37] bribes
[1:56:38] as that was adam's bride was deceived
[1:56:41] jehovah's bride which was
[1:56:42] israel was deceived they got off the
[1:56:45] word when they desire
[1:56:47] a king rather than be led by a prophet
[1:56:50] oh y'all don't get i hope y'all get it
[1:56:53] rather than be led by a prophet they
[1:56:55] want to be led by a king and guess what
[1:56:56] today
[1:56:57] people want to be led by a bishop
[1:57:01] rather than a prophet can i go a little
[1:57:03] further
[1:57:05] just pull that down for me just for a
[1:57:06] second people want to be led by
[1:57:08] bishop rather than a prophet
[1:57:12] the bible says that the
[1:57:16] bishop must be
[1:57:22] husband
[1:57:32] the bible says the bishop must be
[1:57:34] husband
[1:57:36] of one wife now i got i must say a
[1:57:40] couple things here
[1:57:41] so if we have a bishop that's been
[1:57:43] married multiple times and his wife has
[1:57:45] not
[1:57:46] died according to the bible
[1:57:49] he cannot be bishop
[1:57:59] can i say something else there is no
[1:58:03] woman according to the
[1:58:07] bible can be bishop
[1:58:11] why because the bible said
[1:58:14] that the bishop must be husband
[1:58:18] to one wife
[1:58:23] can i go further if we have a woman
[1:58:27] in the pool pit calling herself bishop
[1:58:30] who is she married to
[1:58:34] because if she's a woman and she got a
[1:58:36] wife
[1:58:43] if she's a woman and she got a wife
[1:58:47] we got a a real problem
[1:58:53] we got spiritual homosexuality taking
[1:58:56] place in the church
[1:58:57] now i'm gonna tell you when you got
[1:58:58] spiritual homosexuality in a church you
[1:59:00] can't get rid of natural
[1:59:01] homosexuality
[1:59:04] that's why the homosexual spirit has
[1:59:06] taken over the church because they got
[1:59:08] spiritual
[1:59:09] homosexuality taking place
[1:59:12] you come here and you see all these
[1:59:14] brothers in place that's the way the
[1:59:15] bible had it go back to the old
[1:59:16] testament
[1:59:17] was there ever a woman priestess
[1:59:24] in the priesthood find one woman priest
[1:59:28] maybe a prophetess there's nothing wrong
[1:59:30] with a woman prophesying
[1:59:31] but not preaching oh i told y'all y'all
[1:59:34] i'm say these things sometime when i
[1:59:36] come amen
[1:59:39] i'm just trying to get us back to the
[1:59:40] word of god and i'm gonna tell you this
[1:59:43] and as i as i as i sow these seeds
[1:59:46] we find out what ground people got
[1:59:51] i'm trying to read this quote i got 16
[1:59:54] minutes y'all know i got to cut off here
[1:59:56] soon
[2:00:00] thank you brother joseph glory
[2:00:04] hallelujah how can you tell
[2:00:09] the spirits apart just give them the
[2:00:11] word test i just gave you the word i
[2:00:13] gave you the word that was a word test
[2:00:14] right there what i just gave you
[2:00:15] right to see how you respond to the word
[2:00:18] amen just give them the word test
[2:00:20] if they don't speak that word they are
[2:00:22] of the evil one
[2:00:24] as the evil one to see the first two
[2:00:26] brides
[2:00:27] he will try to deceive the bride of this
[2:00:30] last day
[2:00:31] by trying to get her to hybridize
[2:00:34] herself through creeds now this is what
[2:00:35] the
[2:00:36] angel spoke to the prophet that this was
[2:00:38] gonna happen
[2:00:39] amen says uh trying to
[2:00:42] hybridize herself through chris or just
[2:00:44] plainly turning from the word
[2:00:47] oh my people don't even use the bible
[2:00:49] anymore to justify what they're doing
[2:00:52] i felt you felt what you know the devil
[2:00:55] can give you a feeling right
[2:00:58] you you know you know you know when mo
[2:01:00] i'm talking moses a prophet
[2:01:03] did when he felt he missed the promised
[2:01:06] land
[2:01:07] god said god said go out there and speak
[2:01:08] to that rock moses oh
[2:01:11] you they want water they want water boom
[2:01:14] hit the rock no water he got mad
[2:01:18] boom water came out the rock well he was
[2:01:20] okay i showed him i got water
[2:01:22] god said okay come see me moses
[2:01:25] we need to have a conference we need to
[2:01:26] have a talk moses i need to talk to
[2:01:28] what is it we saw water come out to rock
[2:01:31] you saw people heal
[2:01:32] you saw this you saw signs of wonder you
[2:01:34] saw that but i told you to do it a
[2:01:36] specific way
[2:01:38] and because you didn't do it my way see
[2:01:41] this ain't burger king
[2:01:46] this ain't burgundy we're dealing with
[2:01:47] this gospel we talk about burger king
[2:01:49] amen you can't have it your way
[2:01:52] you have to do this god's way amen
[2:01:55] so so god said god said no no say moses
[2:01:57] i need to speak to you
[2:01:58] say okay you will not be going into this
[2:02:02] promised land that i told you is going
[2:02:03] to take the people
[2:02:04] too the reason you're not because you
[2:02:05] exalted yourself above my word
[2:02:08] even a prophet can't do that
[2:02:12] says i'ma let you go see the land but
[2:02:14] you ain't going over into it
[2:02:16] climb up in this mountain look over here
[2:02:17] look over there you can see exactly what
[2:02:19] i told them they're gonna have and they
[2:02:20] come into it
[2:02:21] but you not not and god didn't even
[2:02:24] would not even accept sorry
[2:02:30] don't get yourself in that position
[2:02:32] where god won't even accept your sorry
[2:02:37] i'm going on as he wanted to see the
[2:02:40] first two brides he would try to see the
[2:02:41] bride the last day
[2:02:43] by trying to get her to hypertize her
[2:02:44] self-decrees are just plainly turning
[2:02:46] from the word to any sign that suits her
[2:02:48] but god never plays signs ahead of the
[2:02:50] word signs
[2:02:52] follow the word i was just i was
[2:02:54] thinking on this quote when sister tina
[2:02:56] came up here
[2:02:56] and said how the devil's been attacking
[2:02:58] her said see seing followed the word she
[2:03:00] was obedient
[2:03:01] she was obedient to what the spirit of
[2:03:03] god was telling her to get up here and
[2:03:05] sing and
[2:03:05] and and through obedience god blesses
[2:03:10] i mean i'm expecting for that thing to
[2:03:11] be dissolved before the doctors even see
[2:03:13] it
[2:03:18] i got a quote that i want to read before
[2:03:20] i leave here today but uh but look he
[2:03:22] said he say this
[2:03:22] uh it says um a science follower as when
[2:03:25] elijah told a woman to bake a cake for
[2:03:27] him first
[2:03:28] according to the word of the lord when
[2:03:30] she did as the word
[2:03:31] said the proper sign came
[2:03:35] right come to the word first and then
[2:03:38] watch the miracle and look notice this
[2:03:40] statement the c
[2:03:41] word is energized by
[2:03:44] the spirit now i want to just kind of
[2:03:47] i'm have to cut my sermon here
[2:03:49] there's a different way that i i had
[2:03:52] planned to go but
[2:03:53] god said otherwise what does energize
[2:03:56] me energize means to
[2:04:00] enliven to liven
[2:04:03] up to animate
[2:04:07] to vitalize invigorate
[2:04:10] perk up excite
[2:04:14] electrify stimulate
[2:04:18] stir up fire up
[2:04:22] rouse motivate
[2:04:27] so so when brother caleb is out there
[2:04:30] talbot
[2:04:31] let's get motivated he's actually
[2:04:34] bringing energy
[2:04:38] he uses various things to try to get you
[2:04:40] a man some energy
[2:04:42] hallelujah see when your phone is about
[2:04:45] to
[2:04:46] die you got to get it plugged into a
[2:04:49] source
[2:04:50] in order to get some energy in order to
[2:04:53] get recharged
[2:04:55] hallelujah your phone is mechanic
[2:04:59] but when you plug into the source you
[2:05:01] getting dynamics
[2:05:03] come on somebody we put too much
[2:05:06] emphasis
[2:05:07] or stress on the mechanics but we
[2:05:10] need dynamics we need to be plugged into
[2:05:13] the spirit of god
[2:05:16] we need the anointing flowing through
[2:05:18] the church again we need the power of
[2:05:20] god moving again
[2:05:22] we need dynamics we need lives
[2:05:25] changed again
[2:05:27] [Applause]
[2:05:29] brother i'm not talking about experience
[2:05:31] from 25 years ago
[2:05:33] we need a fresh experience today
[2:05:37] if my phone died yesterday i gotta plug
[2:05:40] it in tonight
[2:05:41] if it dies tomorrow i gotta plug it
[2:05:43] again the next night
[2:05:45] i gotta keep plugging it in and keep
[2:05:46] getting a charge and what we need is
[2:05:48] refilling after refilling
[2:05:50] after refilling after refilling we
[2:05:53] cannot be
[2:05:54] satisfied amen
[2:05:58] we're just a letter we need the spirit
[2:06:01] of god moving in the church
[2:06:04] the the same word got to be energized
[2:06:09] motivated by the spirit
[2:06:13] this uh statement here
[2:06:19] out of being led by the holy spirit and
[2:06:22] i'm gonna try to bring this to a close
[2:06:23] if i can
[2:06:26] this uh statement that the prophet makes
[2:06:29] it says now one more little thing let's
[2:06:31] talk about divine healing
[2:06:32] and i want you to just try to pocket
[2:06:34] this uh look at this from uh
[2:06:36] various angles not just divine healing
[2:06:38] but maybe just in your life
[2:06:40] just where you at right now spiritually
[2:06:42] you need to be quicken
[2:06:44] you you need you need the you need you
[2:06:46] need the word of god to jumpstart you
[2:06:48] right you you need you need you need a
[2:06:50] shot in the arm
[2:06:52] another definition to be turbocharged
[2:06:56] come on somebody glory to god you you
[2:06:59] need to pick me up
[2:07:01] amen amen you you like samson was as i
[2:07:05] preached last week samson was all bound
[2:07:07] and
[2:07:07] and delilah's lap kept giving away
[2:07:09] secrets
[2:07:10] got close and closer till he finally
[2:07:12] told her the secret of his heart
[2:07:14] and so if you cut my happy just like any
[2:07:16] other man and he thought
[2:07:17] that after he gave it a secret that he
[2:07:19] was going to rise up amen and just go
[2:07:21] go at it that i gave you a type that was
[2:07:24] the same way
[2:07:25] there was uh uh samson was bound three
[2:07:28] times
[2:07:28] amen three times and and that's the way
[2:07:30] the church was the church
[2:07:32] the the the spiritual church jesus
[2:07:35] church
[2:07:35] went free on the day of pentecost it was
[2:07:38] a great thing
[2:07:39] after you receive amen uh you shall
[2:07:42] receive power after the holy ghost come
[2:07:43] upon you shall receive
[2:07:45] energy after the holy ghost come upon
[2:07:49] you right so so so when the holy ghost
[2:07:50] came down they got power to live right
[2:07:53] power to right right
[2:07:54] they know to walk right they talked they
[2:07:55] spoke in tongues they healed they did
[2:07:57] all kind of things
[2:07:58] they were baptized in the name of the
[2:07:59] lord jesus christ they were in the word
[2:08:01] of god to tea
[2:08:03] god did great things in that church but
[2:08:05] over years they got
[2:08:07] they got bound just like samson got
[2:08:09] bound in delilah's lap
[2:08:11] the church got bound because they went
[2:08:13] into catholicism
[2:08:14] organized religion
[2:08:18] and when the pentecost see the first
[2:08:20] time samson got bound
[2:08:22] that represented luther luther came out
[2:08:24] but went right back into the same
[2:08:25] catholicism
[2:08:26] he was bound that's that represents
[2:08:28] samson going into delilah's lap
[2:08:29] giving the first thing just give me tie
[2:08:31] me up with green whis
[2:08:32] he broke free from that hallelujah said
[2:08:35] but then he went back into a lap and and
[2:08:36] laid down again and she said just give
[2:08:38] me some new ropes
[2:08:39] hallelujah right and that was wesley
[2:08:42] amen wesley
[2:08:43] come out and and start preaching amen uh
[2:08:46] he went a little further than
[2:08:47] uh the justice lived by faith he was
[2:08:49] talking about sanctification how you had
[2:08:50] to live right
[2:08:52] glory to god amen but but they kept
[2:08:55] playing around with that catholicism
[2:08:56] went right back into denominational
[2:08:59] organization all over again
[2:09:02] oh hallelujah say that was wesley with
[2:09:05] the with the ropes but then
[2:09:06] uh here comes pentecost that come i'm
[2:09:08] talking about church history now but
[2:09:09] here come the pentecostal church
[2:09:11] they broke free from delilah's lap which
[2:09:15] represented the catholic church they
[2:09:16] broke free
[2:09:17] but this time saying now you know what
[2:09:19] samsung a lot to me these three these
[2:09:21] two two times what where just said just
[2:09:23] put a
[2:09:23] put a uh a weave my hair put a bean we
[2:09:26] weave my hair with a b
[2:09:27] he said he said she did it samson
[2:09:29] philistine saying he broke free but this
[2:09:32] time
[2:09:33] you say uh you cut my hair this fourth
[2:09:36] time
[2:09:36] after the pentecostal revival the church
[2:09:38] went into
[2:09:39] the nomination again hallelujah that's
[2:09:42] why
[2:09:43] different things came back into the
[2:09:44] church the organization brought back
[2:09:47] a lot of stuff when they were free from
[2:09:49] all of that
[2:09:50] they didn't have those problems but when
[2:09:51] they got back into organized religion
[2:09:54] they start acting like the baptist they
[2:09:56] start acting like the method they start
[2:09:58] acting like this is this
[2:10:00] is the spiritual thing as to what
[2:10:01] happened with the church yes they had
[2:10:03] the power
[2:10:04] but when they got when they when they
[2:10:05] when they gave up the secrets
[2:10:07] they went into bondage this time they
[2:10:09] got their eyes put out
[2:10:11] what happened when their eyes got put
[2:10:13] out they can't see the word no more
[2:10:18] can't see the word but i want you to
[2:10:19] know something while samson
[2:10:21] representing the church in that
[2:10:22] condition
[2:10:25] god has some hair growing back
[2:10:28] god was bringing his glory back god was
[2:10:31] bringing his anointing back
[2:10:32] in his bondage he was being restored
[2:10:36] and the bible said i will restore saith
[2:10:38] the lord
[2:10:39] i'm telling you the church was being
[2:10:41] restored even in the midst of it there
[2:10:42] was some undergrowth happening
[2:10:44] and i need to let you know you're a part
[2:10:46] of that undergrowth
[2:10:47] [Music]
[2:10:49] but you won't go back into bondage again
[2:10:53] and that's why samson could pray to
[2:10:54] prayer
[2:10:56] god once more lord let me die with these
[2:11:00] philistines
[2:11:01] see when sasha prayed that prayer he
[2:11:02] slayed more philistines in his death
[2:11:05] than he did while he was living let me
[2:11:07] tell you something when we die to the
[2:11:08] way our old church
[2:11:10] taught us when we die to the way we used
[2:11:13] to hear
[2:11:13] things we will slay more philistines in
[2:11:16] death
[2:11:17] and let me tell you the scriptures
[2:11:18] saying lest a quarter week go in the
[2:11:20] ground and die
[2:11:22] in about us alone but if it dies
[2:11:25] it'll bring forth much fruit
[2:11:29] amen that's where we're at
[2:11:32] lord give me these five minutes here
[2:11:34] lord being led by the spirit
[2:11:37] being led by the holy spirit
[2:11:40] now one more little thing i want to
[2:11:42] teach you
[2:11:44] coming back we have many things to talk
[2:11:46] of and let's just take for instance a
[2:11:48] growth
[2:11:49] say i want your sister tina this for you
[2:11:51] and anybody else that got something in
[2:11:52] the devil trying to attack you with a
[2:11:53] growth
[2:11:55] something that isn't he says uh that
[2:11:57] it's something that that isn't a growth
[2:11:59] for instance a deaf ear
[2:12:00] now he's using that as an example for
[2:12:03] instance a deaf ear
[2:12:04] if a man is deaf the bible said win the
[2:12:07] deaf
[2:12:08] spirit
[2:12:12] so whatever growth it is it's a spirit
[2:12:16] it says when the death spirit went out
[2:12:18] of the man the deaf spirit
[2:12:20] now if a man's death there's one thing
[2:12:22] to do the sensible thing to do is go to
[2:12:24] your doctor
[2:12:26] now how many of y'all don't believe in
[2:12:27] doctors the prophet said a sensible
[2:12:30] thing to do
[2:12:31] go to the doctor hallelujah
[2:12:34] amen let him examine you
[2:12:38] he'll look all over it well he'll
[2:12:40] perhaps say and tell you
[2:12:42] why you're deaf maybe something has
[2:12:44] slipped
[2:12:46] and it's cutting off the energy
[2:12:49] to the nerve maybe something has slipped
[2:12:53] and it's cutting off the energy to the
[2:12:55] nerve maybe in your life
[2:12:57] something has slipped and it's cutting
[2:12:59] off the energy
[2:13:03] and that's why you're in the condition
[2:13:04] you're in something has cut off your
[2:13:06] energy
[2:13:08] i'm trying to get you motivated
[2:13:12] look at this then if he can operate and
[2:13:14] pull that slip
[2:13:16] back it'll be energized
[2:13:19] and when you're energized you'll hear
[2:13:22] again
[2:13:23] for instance sometimes when the teeth is
[2:13:25] out
[2:13:27] causes to pull down and it makes you
[2:13:30] hard of hearing your teeth affect your
[2:13:33] hearing a prophet is telling you this
[2:13:35] right amen it says because it makes you
[2:13:38] hard of hearing
[2:13:39] many things like that are natural things
[2:13:41] but what if the doctor said i don't see
[2:13:43] why
[2:13:44] you're deaf why you're dumb and can't
[2:13:46] speak
[2:13:48] why you're blind and can't see say now
[2:13:50] if it's a cataract
[2:13:51] it's a germ of life and it's growing a
[2:13:54] body and it's covering over the sight
[2:13:57] but what if it's not a cataract what if
[2:14:00] the doctor says the nerve is dead
[2:14:02] well what kill the nerve
[2:14:06] it's not supposed to be not supposed to
[2:14:08] be that way god didn't want it that way
[2:14:11] just so much of the nerve died well why
[2:14:13] didn't all the nerve die
[2:14:15] see they just give you all kind of
[2:14:16] excuses because they don't know then why
[2:14:18] didn't all the nerve die
[2:14:20] just in the eye it says it's because a
[2:14:23] blind
[2:14:24] spirit
[2:14:27] it's because of blind spirit amen
[2:14:30] uh uh jesus called it that no matter how
[2:14:34] old-fashioned it seems it's still the
[2:14:35] truth the bible said so
[2:14:37] now if there's an unseen something
[2:14:41] that the doctor can't see neither can he
[2:14:44] feel he can't touch it no way but the
[2:14:48] nerve is dead
[2:14:49] it's a blind spirit shutting off
[2:14:51] stopping
[2:14:52] shutting off the energy to the eye or to
[2:14:55] the ear
[2:14:56] now see this is a spirit that's causing
[2:14:58] a lump in our sister's throat so she
[2:15:00] can't sing y'all know god done blessed
[2:15:01] up with the ability to be able to sing
[2:15:03] for the glory of god
[2:15:04] teachings just how she how she make a
[2:15:06] living but singing
[2:15:08] is what she was born for
[2:15:11] amen come on somebody i think murphy
[2:15:14] said praise
[2:15:15] is what i do see the rest of it is just
[2:15:18] part of my
[2:15:19] my make a living but this is what i do
[2:15:22] this is why i was born amen sometimes
[2:15:25] sister tina can sing or something and
[2:15:27] it'll shift the atmosphere
[2:15:31] at a funeral in a shifty atmosphere
[2:15:34] in church or shift the atmosphere
[2:15:37] so you think the devil gonna try to get
[2:15:39] it to sit on that it see it opens up the
[2:15:41] it opens up the floor for the anointing
[2:15:44] to come
[2:15:46] it's a it's it's a spirit trying to cut
[2:15:48] that off
[2:15:49] glory to god look at this he says uh
[2:15:52] uh uh like there uh it says shut off the
[2:15:55] energy to the eye to the ear
[2:15:56] like if there was a transparent band
[2:15:59] around my arm
[2:16:00] you can't see it you can't see it you
[2:16:02] couldn't you couldn't feel it
[2:16:03] but my hands getting dead well there's
[2:16:06] no need
[2:16:07] of uh uh there's no need
[2:16:10] of putting hallelujah this thing okay
[2:16:13] stop
[2:16:14] oh glory to god said there's no need of
[2:16:16] putting self out here
[2:16:18] you've got to deal with it here after a
[2:16:21] while if you don't move it
[2:16:22] it'll become completely dead if you
[2:16:25] don't use it
[2:16:26] it'll become completely bad if you don't
[2:16:29] do something with it then the devil will
[2:16:30] wipe it out wipe you out
[2:16:32] the devil wants you to feel sorry for
[2:16:34] yourself
[2:16:35] amen but he's trying to hinder that gift
[2:16:37] from going forward
[2:16:39] you got to snap out of that thing you
[2:16:41] got to be energized
[2:16:44] by the spirit of god
[2:16:45] [Applause]
[2:16:47] amen look at this he says uh uh
[2:16:51] uh it'll be completely dead you'll lose
[2:16:53] the use of it
[2:16:54] now what does divine healing do
[2:16:57] divine healing prayer to god
[2:17:01] faith cuts that loose takes away
[2:17:05] that spirit i love this statement
[2:17:09] faith cuts that loose takes away that
[2:17:12] spirit then what happens
[2:17:14] energy begins to come in
[2:17:17] can i just i want to i just want to say
[2:17:19] see when when the devil i mean the
[2:17:21] doctor can go and he can cut this and
[2:17:22] cut that you know exactly what he's done
[2:17:24] through the cuts you've got scars that
[2:17:26] show that the doctor benedict cut
[2:17:28] but when it comes to the spirit of god
[2:17:31] it goes without a cut
[2:17:33] hallelujah and it just kind of gets
[2:17:35] right into that little spot where
[2:17:37] where you know you needed god to come in
[2:17:39] and do something for you
[2:17:40] and he began he begins to amen take away
[2:17:43] the spirit that's actually trying to cut
[2:17:45] you off
[2:17:45] he's taking away the spirit that's
[2:17:47] giving you the mind battles he's taking
[2:17:49] away the spirit that
[2:17:50] makes you walk in condemnation he's
[2:17:52] taking away the spirit that makes you
[2:17:54] think like nobody loves you
[2:17:56] he's taking away the spirit
[2:17:59] and when he takes away the spirit your
[2:18:01] nerve your spiritual man is being
[2:18:03] energized
[2:18:07] the c word will be energized
[2:18:11] by the spirit now i'm going to tell you
[2:18:12] something when you talk about divine
[2:18:14] healing
[2:18:14] oftentimes people can't feel when they
[2:18:17] got healed
[2:18:19] x is a tiny body she never knew when the
[2:18:22] cancer dropped off
[2:18:25] but something cut the spirit a prayer of
[2:18:28] faith
[2:18:29] cut the spirit it was at a deeper level
[2:18:31] than what was on the outside
[2:18:33] the prayer of faith went on the inside
[2:18:34] and cut the cut the source off
[2:18:39] and when the source would come out the
[2:18:41] nerve or the the inside of her body
[2:18:43] begin to get energized
[2:18:45] and i'm gonna tell you something about
[2:18:46] god when he's giving you energy
[2:18:49] your situation can change in 24 hours
[2:18:52] [Music]
[2:18:57] you ain't got to wait no longer if you
[2:18:59] can just accept the
[2:19:00] energy coming from the holy ghost
[2:19:06] amen the word has been planted in you
[2:19:11] let that seed work that you've been
[2:19:13] given
[2:19:14] be energized energy begins to come
[2:19:18] in and the person begins to see better
[2:19:22] they might not see perfect at once but
[2:19:25] they're going to start seeing better
[2:19:28] because a c word is energized
[2:19:33] by the spirit let's pray
[2:19:46] father
[2:19:48] we need the spirit
[2:19:52] we've been given this example father of
[2:19:55] these different grounds that the word of
[2:19:57] god can fall on the word is a seed
[2:20:01] that the soil souls and it falls on
[2:20:03] these various grounds this wayside
[2:20:07] rocks and thorns
[2:20:11] also good ground we want to be good
[2:20:15] ground today father that we could take
[2:20:16] the word and
[2:20:18] not allow the enemy to come
[2:20:22] after we leave here and just begin to
[2:20:24] take these things out of us
[2:20:25] we got to fight to keep what you've
[2:20:26] given us
[2:20:30] lord i pray that you would just do a
[2:20:32] mighty work and
[2:20:34] as i just read this this last quote
[2:20:38] a doctor might not be able to diagnose
[2:20:40] and see what's causing the problem he
[2:20:42] can see the problem but it can't
[2:20:43] figure out what's causing it
[2:20:47] but as jesus said it's this is the
[2:20:49] spirit went out of a man
[2:20:50] and that's what we're dealing with
[2:20:52] things at a spiritual level
[2:20:54] i pray that as the word of god has been
[2:20:57] preached
[2:20:59] that the spirits would leave the people
[2:21:03] that thus even those that are at home
[2:21:05] hearing the word of god may spirits
[2:21:07] begin to leave the people may they be
[2:21:09] set free from the
[2:21:10] inside god that it would manifest itself
[2:21:14] on the outside
[2:21:16] and we realized god the word the the
[2:21:18] promise that we've been holding onto and
[2:21:20] we've been quoting over ourselves
[2:21:22] that seed word is energized it receives
[2:21:25] its strength it receives its motivation
[2:21:27] it receives everything
[2:21:29] from the spirit of god it's not by might
[2:21:34] it's known by power it's going to be by
[2:21:37] the spirit of almighty god
[2:21:40] so the word has been sown god now let
[2:21:43] let the operations take place that the
[2:21:46] people might go free lord
[2:21:50] only you can do it jesus father we
[2:21:53] committed lord into your hands and
[2:21:55] we just thank you father for what you
[2:21:57] have already done
[2:21:59] thank you for your word it's in jesus
[2:22:00] name we pray

[2:22:05] praise

[2:22:08] back over to you

[2:22:14] spirit

[2:22:18] energizer bunny

[2:22:25] until he get a power source he's just a
[2:22:28] bunny a dead bunny
