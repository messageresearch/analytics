go to job the 27th chapter then we'll go from there you can have your seats i don't want to keep you standing jeremiah might be a lot of read job 27 was thought at the first verse amen and it reads on this wise moreover job continued his parable and said as god liveth who hath taken away my judgment and the almighty who hath vexed my soul all the while my breath is in me and the spirit of god is in my nostrils my lips shall not speak wickedness nor my tongue utter deceit god forbid that i would justify you till i die i will not remove i will not remove my integrity from me my righteousness i hold fast and will not let go my heart shall not reproach me as long as i live let my enemy be as the wicked and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous for what is the hope of the hypocrite though he hath gained when god taketh away his soul will god hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him will he delight himself in the almighty will he always call upon god i will teach you by the hand of god that which is with the almighty will i not conceal behold all ye yourselves have seen it why then are ye thus all together vain this is the portion of the of the of a wicked man with god and inherit an inheritance of oppressor uh which they shall receive of the almighty if the children be multiplied it is for the sword and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread amen you may be seated i'd like to take for a title if we go back there to the sixth verse it says my righteousness i hold fast and will not let go so the title of my message this evening is hold fast and don't let go amen hold fast and don't let go i'd like to take a now a little reading if you don't mind just to set a platform here um out of jeremiah uh beginning at the of the fifth chapter um i think i'll start reading here gonna start at the first verse i'm gonna start at the first verse i'm gonna read out of jeremiah the fifth chapter i'll start at the first verse amen uh and it reads it says run ye to and fro through the streets of jerusalem and see now and know and seek in the broad places thereof if ye can find a man if there be any that executeth judgment that seeketh the truth and i will pardon it and though they uh they say the lord liveth surely they swear falsely oh lord are not thine eyes upon the truth thou has stricken them but they have not grieved thou has consumed them but they have refused to receive correction they have made their faces harder than iraq they have refused to return therefore i said surely a poor surely these are poor they are foolish for they know not the way of the lord nor the judgment of their god i will i will get me unto the great men and will speak unto them for they have known the way of the lord and the judgment of their god but these have altogether broken the broken the yoke and burst the bonds wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them and a wolf of the evening shall spoil them a leopard shall watch over their cities every one that goeth out vents shall be torn in pieces because their transgressions are many and their backslidings are increased how shall i pardon thee for this ye children have forsaken me and sworn by them that are no good that i sworn by them that are no gods when i have fed them to uh to the full they then committed adultery and assembled themselves by troops in harlot's houses they they they were as fed horses in the morning everyone after his neighbor's wife shall i not visit for these things saith the lord and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this go ye upon her walls and destroy but make not fall in take away her battlements and they are not the lords for the house of the lord and the house of judah have dealt very treacherously against me saith the lord they have uh belied the lord and said unto and and said it is not he neither shall evil come upon us neither shall these swords nor famine and the prophets shall come and the prophet shall become when and the word is not in them thus shall it be done unto them wherefore thus saith the lord god of hosts because ye because ye speak this word behold i will make my words in thy mouth fire and the people would and it shall devour them lord i bring a nation upon you far from far o house of israel the lord is a mighty nation it is an ancient nation a nation whose language thou knowest not neither understandeth what they say their quiver is as an open uh subculture and uh and are all mighty men and they shall eat up thine harvest and thy bread which thy sons and thy daughters should eat they shall eat up the flocks of thy herds and they shall eat of the vines of the fig tree and they shall impart impoverish thy fenced cities wherein thou trusted it with the sword nevertheless in those days saith the lord i will make full end with you and it shall come to pass when ye shall say wherefore doeth the lord god all these things unto us then shalt thou answer them like as ye have forsaken me and served gods in your land so shall ye serve strangers in the land of in the land that is not yours declare this in the house of jacob and publish it in judah saying here now old foolish people and without understanding which have eyes and see not which have ears which which have eyes and see not which have ears and hear not fear ye not me saith the lord will ye not tremble at my presence which have placed the uh the for a bounce of the sea by a perpetual decree that it cannot pass it and though the waves therefore toss themselves yet they cannot prevail though the raw yet it cannot pass over it amen so we see here that the children of israel amen in this little passage of scripture that i just read to you amen uh kind of lost their way amen they begin to uh serve other gods and they begin to uh can what do you give me a napkin it is mighty hot in here today i'm feeling them i'm i thought i was gonna get me a little hand tile i appreciate it hey man we see that uh they they they they they had they had kind of fell off amen if you read there oh right before that jeremiah and the i believe it's the eighth chapter say uh they were a perpetual backsliding amen we we want to take a look at some of these things that that word there thank you my brother that word they're perpetual amen perpetual perpetual it means to be never ending never changing occurring repeatedly so frequent as it seems endless amen word perpetual and we read the word there in jeremiah and it talks about how uh god uh set a decree that the sea could only go so far uh i want you to recognize that the the the the sea when god amen he uh when he when he created the earth there in genesis amen he he set a boundary amen for the sea he said well you he divided the land and said well you can only come this far amen that was for amen for the protection and he set the thing up so beautifully and everything was set in such an order amen that everything held its place amen everything had a place and as long as everything was in its place amen there was peace in the valley there was peace on the mountain as long as everything was set in order because see when he created everything he put the sun and the moon and the earth he put him so many miles apart amen he know he measured the gravitational force and he said well i got this amount of water see god is a great builder amen and he's a great designer and he knows amen jazz how to place things where they need to be you see that's why even in this church he knows just how to place things right where they need to be amen he knows a man how to place people right where they need to be amen in order to have peace amen in the in the assembly amen so when everything sometimes okay in our lives he knows how to place things in our lives but see every now and then sometimes something happens we get away from god on last week i was talking about we move away from those flowing streams you see we get to we get to move out of place and when we begin to move over into a certain territory as they did here in israel amen he said now how can i allow these things to happen amen without coming and executing judgment because see at this time there was a law amen and a law is no longer without judgment amen there must be a penalty amen for for for for violating the law or it's no law at all amen so that there had to be judgment but god oh god who is so merciful he said and bound he said you can only come this far so we see we see uh uh uh in this scripture here amen the word bound it reads he says uh fear ye not me sayeth the lord will ye not tremble at my presence amen which have placed the sand for a bound of the sea by a perpetual decree now this word bound is the root word for boundary okay so i'm saying that that that you can only go so far and it says that he did this by a perpetual and we said the word perpetual means never ending by a continuous and decree a perpetual decree amen that word decree means a divine ordinance amen a decree amen it means here amen in order usually having the force of law or a judicial decree amen a religious ordinance amen or foreordained will of god a perpetual decree amen it was it was established amen amen by the almighty god amen the set of bounds that that that that the sea could only go so far amen in this sea we look at we we we we we we look at noah i don't want to get ahead of myself we'll get there amen that it represents a judgment amen water water destroys let's build it this way water in a chaotic condition destroys amen many of us are homeowners we have to have flood insurance because we need water to function but it has to be controlled that water is good as long as it remain in them pipes it began to leak out of the pipes and we got a problem it begins to do damage to all the other things amen so see even in an hour in our natural construction we have to set bounds amen for the water we have to say okay you can only come this far amen and you can uh you can stay here in the in the tub amen and if i if i turn on my speaking and the water flows into the sea that's where you stay hey man i have a roof on so when the when when the rain and things come amen my roof slopes and the water runs because i want the water to go to a certain place i don't want water in my house i don't want it all over my good drywall and my furniture and things because it's going to cause a problem we can't live like that amen the person that they you know they live outside the first thing they want amen one of the highest the needs of man they managed to get out of the weather it starts to rain you begin to see people put something over they want to get they want to get to somewhere safety they want to get up under a shelter they want to get up under something to keep the water off of them amen because water uncontrolled is destructive uncontrolled now water is powerful amen water water water water it it it'll wipe out cities hey man we see many times in the bible hole uh uh caparing them under the sea they been destroyed by water amen so we see that god in his in his in his in in all of his great wonder all this great wonder he set about amen allah that you can only come this far amen maybe uh uh uh uh uh the winds and the storms in your life you may be going through some difficult problems you may be going through some difficult problems we call those things the storms of life but i'm here to tell you this evening that they can only go so far amen there's been a perpetual decree set by god that no matter how hard it gets no matter how difficult the situation is amen the water can only come so far amen the sea would destroy the earth if it was not for the boundaries set by god against the forces of the power of the sea so when you come into this world god also set at the boundary and decree of your life amen and say that the water can only come so far amen you can only go so far amen we see here that the children of israel they they begin to to do all kinds of things they began to serve other gods and they began to do this but they could only go so far why because there was a boundary set amen before the foundation of the world amen that says that the seed will not destroy you it can only go so far amen my my mind it can only go so far your life is protected amen amen by a decree a man of god and we see amen the prophet was talking about here amen we look at noah amen noah amen the clouds he he he had a a vision amen that god told him that the the sins amen had reached up to the nostrils of god amen and and and there had to be something done amen he was going to he was going to uh take care of the problem amen he was he he was going to uh uh uh sitting the ring amen understanding that this is a destructive force and uh and he said hearing the message on the wings of a snow white dove amen amen uh paragraph 86 he said and the clouds began to form amen and the rains began to fall and the sewers began to fill up the fountains of the deep broke open the springs all belched up their water finally the people got into their houses and they climbed up the old ark set there in the same place amen we know the story noah went around preaching amen and he compelled people to get into the ark of safety amen because he knew amen that that the destructive water was coming he knew that there that that that that that that judgment was on the way right amen so he went amen into the hedges in the highways and the people mocked him amen they they they they they didn't they they at they unbelief they didn't believe this man who are you to tell us what god is going to do amen no doubt you know they never even heard the word rain what be this rain you're talking about what is i've never never seen rain never even heard the word before and the prophet described how this was such an intellectual age that they began to shoot things into the air and say look noah there's no water up there amen you have seemed to have lost your mind a little bit amen excuse me you seem to uh uh uh uh uh fell off the deep end amen cause uh uh the church that i came up in they don't preach this i've never heard this kind of preaching before i've never heard such a thing it's going to rain amen i've been going to church all my life and i've never heard anything like this but see there was a judgment coming and you see god has set a bounds and said that the water can only come so far but he was going to allow to move amen the the the hands of the stabilizing hand of god amen to allow things chaos to set in for a little while amen but he was sending a man a a rescue boat amen he was sending an ark amen for those amen who would believe amen to be saved amen but the people because they had never heard of such a thing they they they didn't understand it they didn't understand it so they didn't take heed to the warning amen they they like much like the children of israel here in jeremiah they they they they heard the words of the prophets amen but but there were other men amen that came along amen and created snares now let me let me let me slow down a little bit here and let me just kind of walk that a little bit amen uh uh uh they are sn i'm sorry let me keep going because i'm going to get there i'm sorry let me keep going because i'll get there now we see noah uh uh in this uh they broke up the springs climb into the houses and the ark was set there just the same after a while when enough began to get around her she began to rise talking about the yard she began to rise higher and higher the people began they knocked at the door and screamed but did no good noah had opened the door and god closed it god was the only and god is the only one that can open it amen now let me go back if i may and and and uh take a look at something the title amen of this of my message here is uh hold fast and don't let go amen the bible says in first thessalonians the fifth chapter the 21st verse amen it says prove all things amen and hold fast to that which is good amen so the word there uh proof means to recognize something as being genuine after examination amen to prove means to to to to take something and study it and after studying it you are convinced that this is genuine amen this is the real thing this is not a make-believe this is not something this is solid amen this is this this this boat of whole water hey man this boat this boat would take uh uh or stay in the journey amen so he said prove all things and hold fast to that which is good so we we we we we see we have ex listen we have examined over the years this message for many years and i trust that we have come to the place that we can understand and realize that the word of god that this is genuine amen this is something that'll carry you through amen the storms of life this is something that'll carry you through the tribulation the judgment that is coming amen this word hold fast is a term that is a a a it has meanings and different stances but it is mainly a nautical term amen an article turned to greek words slightly varying meanings to check a ship's headway see a ship a ship when it's when it's when it's on the on the sea and the the the winds are blowing amen if if if you gotta read by the compass because see there's no uh landmarks out there you don't know whether you're going north south east or west you have to be able to trust the instrumentation of your compass amen so what you have to do is someone has to be looking there constantly at the compass and grabbing the helm of the weird the helm and continue to hold fast there may be winds and a storm is brewing the waves are are coming high amen the water is coming up uh beating the size of the ship amen but you must continue to watch the compass amen and hold fast amen to stay right on course amen you must continue to hold fast amen if you let the wheel go there's no telling where you wind up amen you're tossed about with every wind and there's no telling where you're in you'll wind up shipwrecked amen thrashed against the rocks and you'll lose your vessel tore up into pieces so you must hold fast to that which is good amen hold fast to what he gave you if jesus told you and he's given you a revelation you see because what anchor us in this hour amen we're talking about this ship amen you holding fast amen so sometime in storming seas they have to let the anchors out amen so to give you a little stabilization hey man and when they let the ankles out in the water amen it helps stabilizes you just a little bit amen and you must still hold fast to that which is good hold fast so you don't go to the left hold fast so you don't sway to the right amen you have to stay right on course amen what god has told you to go amen and what anchors you amen the anchors is your revelation as your revelation increases the deeper your ankle grabs amen as your revelation increases the greater your anchor hole amen as your revelation increases the more stable you become amen that's why you find a lot of times people that don't have a revelation amen you see that they're tossed over here amen that wind up blowing them over there but amen as you become mature christians amen and you have a revelation god has revealed to you amen to where you're standing at in this hour he's revealed to you exactly where we are right now he's revealed to you where you come from he's revealed to you where you're going he's revealed to you that he has set abound amen and there's no fear because you know the water can only go so far so the revelation amen is what anchors you the revelation amen that stabilizes you amen it gives you courage amen when the storms of life amen begins to blow amen and the and the ways of battering up on the ship hey man my wife and i amen one time was on a cruise and i guess they had to go through a little storm and all of a sudden we can feel the boat begin to rock and i say baby this too big to be rocking so we went up on the day upper deck and looked out and it was just amazing i mean the only thing we could say we say the sea is angry the sea is angry i mean for you it was dark i mean all you could see is the white caps of the waves thrashing ah god and this boat which is huge amen this huge vessel began to shimmy begin to shake amen but thank god there was a captain at the helm and he was watching the compass and he was holding it right steady and say we got to drive out of the storm he's looking at the instrumentation and he say well the storm is coming from the east amen we got to get if we go so many miles north amen we would drive right out of the storm amen so when the storms of your life amen begin to battle the ship amen in the seas are angry amen the kids are acting up amen the spouse is acting up amen the boss is acting up amen and everything seems to be going wrong you just watch the instrumentation of the word and hold fast to that which is good amen and keep traveling forward don't let go hold fast and don't let go cause if you let go amen ain't no telling where you end up hey man you end up thrashed against the rocks hey man you end up over there somewhere where you don't want to be amen and your instrumentation damage and what happens is you don't know how to get back you gotta call for rescue somebody come get me somebody lost course amen cause i let go the wheel oh my hold fast and don't let go no matter what you're going through no matter how hard the trial may seem hold fast amen the ship is built to stand the pressure your ship is built to stand the pressure it is a specially designed ship amen is built to handle the trouble he says he'll put no more on you amen than you can bear amen just don't let go trust him amen no matter how hard it is amen let's go on we see here amen another word for hold fast the meaning another meaning is to attend to carefully to take care of not to discard or let go keep carefully and faithfully to continue to hold and retain with god we are commanded by scriptures by the verses that we must good be good stewards amen over the mystery amen he has given us amen divine revelation amen we are people amen that are blessed amen we have been anchored amen in christ jesus amen but don't worry the storms are gonna blow amen we are still on the sea of time amen so that don't mean that we've made it all the way amen we still have to trust in him amen we still have to have to monitor our instrumentation amen you can't go weeks and weeks without monitoring your instrumentation amen you can't go weeks and weeks amen without talking to the first mate hey man you can't go weeks and weeks amen without monitoring and and and checking up amen to make sure amen that's your anchor holes hey man every now and then you got to go and tug on your ankle amen to make sure that your anchor is still got a good lock amen glory to god my my my mind make sure that your ankle holds amen prove all things amen make sure that what you're believing in is genuine amen once you believe amen and you are sure amen that is genuine amen it'll stabilize you hey man you you won't get blocked blown and tossed all about amen the stabilizers that when trouble come amen you'll be able to to stand the pressure amen hold fast to that which is good amen we thank god that this truth has been given to us this message of this hour amen come to us and the only thing of this age amen that we can call good i'm gonna read i'ma say that again we thank god for the message of the hour the message of the hour cause it is good amen amen so we hold fast amen says in hebrews amen 10 23 let us hold fast amen to our profession of faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised let us hold fast to our profession amen not as the hypocrite amen we speak it with our mouth but we really ha we don't believe it amen we're not holding fast you're not holding fast one minute uh uh uh uh uh you at the hell and the next minute you're going somewhere else you don't left the wheel you don't left the ship on on its own course hey amen you must stay focused in yourself you can't be swayed with every little voice amen now let me let me we're talking about noah here let me get back here on task after a while enough began and they get around and she began to rise higher and higher the people knocked at the door they screamed but it did no good noah could not open the door because noah did not close the door amen so that is is so as it is today in our ark we have an ark today that ark is christ jesus god opened the door for us on calvary he'll close it just as sure as he opened it and it floated following along here and it floated and on and on maybe a mile deep over the top of the earth and when this earth was trembling now listen here let me let me let me let me go back over there and it floated on and on maybe miles deep over the top of the earth when this earth was tumbling out from the way from its regular orbit see from its regular orbit it had gotten out of place amen and around and around it went chunks and trees above the mountains and so forth pitching for 40 days and 40 nights jehovah the great stabilizer had pulled back the great stabilizer who was holding everything together had pulled back and said okay you want to do it your way i'll have you let you do it your way the great stabilizer had withdrew amen his hand amen and when the winds had begin to cease amen pardon me the winds i begin to cease god's wrath is horrible amen if i may let me go down here amen to uh paragraph 92. now we notice that after noah floating up there no doubt seasick from all of the rowing and the popping and the wrath of god smashed and crushing and screams and so forth then it began to quiet down nothing happened days passed nothing happened perhaps the food supply the animals and so forth was running low nothing happened so he thought wonder i can see i can see out so maybe in your life amen and you're floating on pawn on the sea of life amen maybe you've been sick in your body amen and nothing happened maybe it seems that the cupboard is bare amen and maybe the storms of life have stretched you out to the point that you could just scream amen but you're on the boat amen so hold fast no matter how how how how how difficult the trouble may seem maybe you're like the people here that was on new york amen don't know where the next meal is coming from the bank account may may look low you may may be down to cents in the bank account and you're wondering how am i going to make it through the week i say hold fast and don't let go maybe the doctor has gave you a bad report amen and you're waiting for test results to come in i say hold fast and don't let go we take a look at job jobs was giving this this this testimony here in job 27. job was testifying he had just came through a great trial but before he began to go through this trial there was a conversation between the devil and the lord and and and the double the devil the devil said uh uh uh uh you you you you're protecting him you gotta hedge about him i'll make him curse you but god knew job and he said if you remove the hedge i'll make him curse you so the lord accepted the challenge unbeknownst to job who was a great and wise man everything that he touched was successful everything was going good in his life amen he had no problems had wealth amen these kids were doing well amen but amen uh the lord began to brag on joe joe was an honest and an upright man so he told satan you got a deal i'll move the hedge but he said about and say but you can only go so far you can only go so far so job went through the trial and he stood the test and here in in the 27th chapter here he began to testify that he and and and and in that he said my righteousness i hold fast and i will not let go my heart shall not reproach me as long as i live as long as i live job had just came through a terrible trial amen he had you we know the story job went through a lot he lost his children he lost his wealth amen his health began to fail but job held on and he didn't let go amen and all was restored amen back to joe so we see here amen uh uh uh noah amen people begin to get seasick they're on the ship amen the troubles all around them as far as they can see was water and destruction amen amen and food was running low amen no doubt uh uh uh uh they began to get stressed out with one another amen began to get maybe a little short with one another and they are amen was so constructed in a way the prophet here in paragraph 93 the art was so constructed when you were once in it there was only one window in it and it was right at the top you could you couldn't look sideways you couldn't look no way but straight up and that's the way the art of jesus christ is you can't look to the next fellow you can't look at nothing but christ when you're in new york because there's only one door and he's that door we talk about he said we talked about this morning you have to keep looking up for he that will put his hand to the plow and even turn to look back mine is not worthy of plowing now in this arc and he could see right and perhaps sunlight but he wonders where he was the ark was still floating he could hear the waves against the sides but he knew that there had been many days surely the water was receding by that time so he went and he got an untrusted bird a treacherous and he tried him and he sent him out see he was a crow amen he was a crow and that crow never did return because he found pleasure out there outside the ark and he flew from one old dead body to another eating the carcass and carrying on that was floating on the water and he was perfectly satisfied amen i got to stop right there for a minute see that old crow didn't hold on amen he was in the ark of safety amen but his heart was on the outside he was in the message coming to church but his heart was on the outside amen so he went out still looking over the bounds of the ship and finding pleasure on the outside looking to the things of the world finding pleasure on the outside see there was no holding there was no keeping power see because he could eat anything see he had a he had a a diet that he could he could swallow anything amen some slick fella amen to tell him tell him one thing and all of a sudden he gobble it up oh this is good you begin to worship oh yeah you worship because it's food he's being fed amen but little did he know hey man what he was feeding on amen was going to kill him amen he found pleasure amen on the outside amen but see we have in this hour amen and ark amen he he he he gave noah a vision a man to build an ark amen to carry the people over the troubled water amen during a time of judgment amen to carry the people over amen we're in the ark amen there's no pleasure on the outside amen that's worth me leaving the ark amen so after several days he tried again and he know he didn't want to step out into the wrath of god so he turned a dove loose and the dove was a different natured bird and it was not a vulture nor was it a scavenger it can only eat the clean and pure things and it was so and it was so satisfied because it could not find nothing else to put the soles of its feet on it returned back to the ark noah said well this the floods still on amen the flood is still on then he waited several more days several other days and he sent it out again like uh his prayer oh god as your wrath begin as your wrath been appeased is your wrath overlord is it all done and he said now if i send her out this time she may stay out there if the floods are down she may stay but he sent her out by prayer and then when she went out there directed by god she picked off an olive leaf of a tree and flew back and pecked on the window again god used the dove amen for a sign she come back saying the flood is over and then god opened the door and they went out now we see that this story here amen that they went out amen in genesis i don't know if i'm gonna have time to continue on amen but we see amen that over in uh let us turn quickly to matthew matthew 3 16. amen matthew 3 16. matthew 3 16 says amen and jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were open unto him and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and lighting upon him and lo a voice came from heaven saying this is my beloved son in who i am please who i am well pleased amen the prophet brought out about this scripture he said he said what what what king james here did is he put the verb before the adverb amen he said the way it really should read is who i am pleased to dwell in see who i am well who i beloved son in whom i am well pleased whom whom i am pleased to dwell in who i am are pleased to dwell in amen so we see that that that that that uh that ark to this day man it's not an uh a vessel of wood amen we we learned that he said what what good what it has done have done for for luther to preach noah's message it won't work in this out what good would it have been for for wesley to preach noah's message we can't preach noah's message today amen but we do have an ark amen that ark is in christ jesus amen that ark of safety amen is is is in him amen you see uh uh uh man moses

thanks of where they come from amen i don't care what you're going through you're still blessed amen god is sustaining you to a point to when he you decide he's sustaining you just enough until you decide i must return back to where i came from you see it's like the prodigal son he let him go i'm not going to hold your speech because our god is a gentleman you know he's not he's not like he's not going to hold you against your will if you want to go out there you go it's your go ahead but but but but but but but you're going to learn my daddy my dad you're telling me say boy you're gonna

hard way if you just hold fast and don't let go devil's gonna come and try to show you all kind of things just uh uh like you know we use coming up as kids we we my dad my father set boundaries he says okay boys come in the house i want you in the house when the street lights come on i want you in here in the door when the street light comes out i want to have to come looking for you if i look

ball we had no one to looking out see we had boundaries set but the pleasures out there we couldn't let that take us away from but the rules that dad had set yeah we're tough but see all of that was is the devil trying to entice us to come out there because see one time we we we we here later say man yeah we had a good time then you're here oh man so such and such got arrested man this happened

other let's see our father knew better you said i'm gonna set a law i'm gonna set a decree i want you to win this house by this time now you break that law you want to i'ma have to come with the judgment i'm about to come with some judgment for your own good but it's gonna she he's just gonna take you so far just so far you know he ain't going he's going he's going he's going to hurt you too bad because he loves you it's just like our heavenly father the judgment is going to go so far but if you continue amen to not heed his warning it's how far you want to go you know when the lord when the when the lord is is dealing with you that's one thing you know when the lord is dealing with you because you know your life better than anybody and you know when the word is right at your door and you know how long will you sit and not take heed and the mercy of god you see he held up the judgment in noah's day all during the time they was building the yard just waiting for them to get into the yard maybe the lord tonight is just waiting for somebody to get into the ark see because he set a decree over your life when you were born that the judgment can only go so far and he cannot break his own word but he's sending warning after warning after warning get into the ark get into the ark he's telling some he's playing get back in the ark see you were you you were there but you but you
