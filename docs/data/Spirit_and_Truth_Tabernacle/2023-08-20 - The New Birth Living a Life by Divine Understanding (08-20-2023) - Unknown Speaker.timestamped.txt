[24:03] our church website john423.org
[24:07] um
[24:08] we I mentioned some time ago we had a
[24:11] new church app and we had released it
[24:14] and we were working with it and we
[24:17] started noticing that the the scriptures
[24:19] were not what we were accustomed to and
[24:21] come to realize they were not using King
[24:23] James version of the Bible they were
[24:25] using some you know other form and and
[24:27] for me I'm just I like to use the same
[24:30] Bible that the prophet used uh because
[24:33] sometimes these other Bibles they
[24:34] actually taken the meaning away from the
[24:36] scripture rather than actually
[24:38] supporting it so I um I said no we can't
[24:41] use that we got to go back to our old
[24:43] one well we just found out this week
[24:45] that they are they they do have the King
[24:47] James version for the new app and we'll
[24:49] let you all know uh when we'll be kind
[24:51] of moving over to that but I don't know
[24:53] if they did it just for us because we
[24:55] were whole doubts we weren't moving off
[24:56] the platform until we got King James
[24:58] version and uh so we thank the Lord
[25:01] forward but um uh so keep that Church
[25:05] website as we'll be streaming from
[25:06] john423.org Brothers will be virtual

[25:59] pulling strength from each and every one
[26:01] of y'all it's encouraging her and
[26:03] strengthening her and helping her in a
[26:05] walk you know as she's away from her

[43:36] first slide please on the new birth
[43:39] living a life by Divine understanding or
[43:42] the New Birth living by Divine
[43:44] understanding
[43:45] so we want to read something from the
[43:48] career chapter three we're gonna read
[43:49] the whole chapter about 10 verses
[43:52] the book of the career chapter 3.
[43:56] and he showed me Joshua the high priest
[43:59] standing before the angel of the Lord
[44:00] and Satan standing at his right hand to
[44:03] resist him
[44:04] so the Lord
[44:06] is showing Joshua standing before the
[44:08] angel of the Lord himself and then Satan
[44:11] stand at the right hand what is the
[44:12] right and the power of God
[44:15] and the Lord said unto Satan the Lord
[44:17] rebuked the O Satan even the Lord that
[44:19] has chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee is this
[44:22] no Branch plugged out of the fire so who
[44:25] is Jerusalem is God city of Peace it's
[44:28] Mrs Jesus Christ that if only before the
[44:30] foundation of the world and is that the
[44:32] branch that is plucked from the fire
[44:33] what is the branch the branch is you
[44:36] amen and what fire is he talking about
[44:38] is it a wildfire that happened in Hawaii
[44:41] no it's the pillar of Fire
[44:43] amen you came from the pillar of Fire
[44:47] you were God before the foundation of
[44:49] the world and we're going to understand
[44:50] why we're putting this flesh why we
[44:52] became Sinners and then why why the Lord
[44:55] has to go allow us to go through all
[44:57] these processes and then bring it bring
[44:59] us back to who we are verse three now
[45:02] Joshua was clothed with filthy garments
[45:04] and stood before the angel and he
[45:07] answered and spoke unto those that stood
[45:08] before him saying take away the filthy
[45:10] garment from him and unto him he said
[45:12] behold have caused by an iniquity to
[45:15] pass from thee and I'll clothe thee with
[45:17] change of Remnant change of Remedies the
[45:19] Holy Ghost baptism transformation of
[45:21] heart and I said let them set a friend
[45:24] meter upon his head what is the meters
[45:26] King James
[45:27] English that was used is it's like the
[45:30] the chef's Hearts it's a headrest that
[45:33] the priest used to wear to symbolize uh
[45:37] the power that they have the authority
[45:39] amen that is their Glory that is the
[45:42] deity that they used to kind of it's a
[45:44] crown that was given soon for the priest
[45:47] so they said a fair meter and we are not
[45:49] talking about physical Crown here the
[45:51] crown that the Lord gives you is the
[45:53] holy ghost in your heart
[45:55] so they set a frame meter up on his head
[45:57] and clothed him with the Garment and the
[45:59] angel of the lost two by six and the
[46:01] angel of the Lord protested unto Joshua
[46:03] saying Protestant means said unto Joshua
[46:06] that is King James English that says the
[46:08] Lord of hosts if thou will walk in my
[46:10] ways and if that will keep my charge
[46:12] then thou shall also judge my house so
[46:15] God is going to make you a ruler But
[46:17] first you need to be changed amen and
[46:20] shall keep my courts and I'll give thee
[46:22] places to walk among these that standby
[46:25] here now oh Joshua the high priest thou
[46:27] and thy fellows that sit before thee for
[46:30] they are men wandered at who are those
[46:32] men it's a five-fold Ministry
[46:35] is you a man for behold I will bring
[46:38] forth my servant the branch what is God
[46:41] doing what is all this about he wants to
[46:43] bring out Christ Jesus the branch out of
[46:46] your flesh amen for behold the stone
[46:49] that I've laid before Joshua upon one
[46:52] stone shall be seven eyes Behold our
[46:55] engrave The Grieving thereof said the
[46:57] Lord of hosts and I'll remove the
[46:59] iniquity of the land in one day now what
[47:01] is the stone stone is revelation and
[47:04] that is the revelation God gave to you
[47:05] and the stone was what it brings out
[47:07] seven eyes that is seven Messengers
[47:10] but then it's good to engrave and
[47:12] multiply amen and after we're going to
[47:15] see the one who was behind the serving
[47:16] Messengers that is the Lord Jesus Christ
[47:18] himself amen without the Lord the
[47:21] servant is not complete the Lord makes
[47:24] it complete it becomes eight and it
[47:25] becomes one amen
[47:28] in that day it says the Lord of fools
[47:30] shall I call every man his neighbor and
[47:32] that and under under the vine and
[47:34] another Victory the vine and the future
[47:36] is your talking
[47:38] is the peace that the Lord has given to
[47:40] you we may take our seed God bless you
[47:43] Glory Hallelujah to the Lord
[47:45] so we want to talk about
[47:47] the new birth living by Divine
[47:50] understanding amen you want to look at
[47:53] what is the new birth
[47:55] what does it entail to say that somebody
[47:58] is born again the new birth is also the
[48:00] same as the Holy Ghost baptism
[48:02] it's just different terms for the self
[48:04] same thing
[48:06] Glory Hallelujah to the Lord and I was
[48:09] listening to brother Troy singing he was
[48:11] singing how sweet
[48:13] to hold a new newborn baby and I say
[48:16] praise the Lord the Lord is confirming
[48:18] the title amen is that this child can
[48:21] can what can face
[48:24] you know sometimes I write I can't read
[48:26] my own handwriting this I read a
[48:28] doctor's handwriting this child can face
[48:30] uncertain uh this right because he lives
[48:35] he can face tomorrow
[48:37] amen and we are talking about new breath
[48:40] a newborn baby that is Born Into the
[48:42] world to face all the uncertainties of
[48:45] the world
[48:46] but with the Holy Ghost baptism this
[48:49] child can face every uncertainty of Life
[48:51] Glory Hallelujah to the Lord so we want
[48:54] to look at the new New Birth Concept in
[48:56] the Old Testament if you look at the Old
[48:58] Testament you don't really see new birth
[49:01] in the Old Testament they used to wash
[49:03] parts
[49:04] but then the Lord lead all the new birth
[49:06] in symbols and the shadows in the Old
[49:09] Testament but the new birth is a new
[49:11] term that was introduced by the Lord
[49:13] Jesus Christ
[49:14] amen if you go through from the Old
[49:16] Testament they didn't that concept
[49:18] wasn't there just like before Noah there
[49:20] wasn't nothing like cloud cloud was
[49:23] something that was the Lord introduced
[49:26] under the dispensation of no one because
[49:28] the Lord is always doing new things in
[49:30] our lives amen so the new birth Was A
[49:33] New Concept so let's look at another
[49:35] scripture let's go to uh the second
[49:37] scripture
[49:39] um yeah that's it now Jesus met this
[49:42] Pharisee who was a teacher
[49:44] give me one second
[49:55] thank you God bless you you just want to
[49:57] be a little loose
[49:59] he said so John Jesus made this Pharisee
[50:02] nicodemos who was a teacher
[50:05] and then he was asking he knew there was
[50:07] something in Jesus and he came to Jesus
[50:09] to ask him a question
[50:11] and Jesus said that you shall you must
[50:12] be born again and he said how can I be
[50:14] born again I'm old maybe past 50.
[50:17] do I go into my mother's room and be
[50:19] born again and say no you must be born
[50:21] of water and the blood
[50:22] and the spirit amen so let's read a
[50:25] little bit and he said let's read a
[50:27] little bit about that scripture he said
[50:29] there was a man of Pharisee
[50:31] Francis named Nicodemus a ruler of the
[50:33] Jews the same came to Jesus by night and
[50:35] said unto him Rabbi we know that our
[50:38] teacher come from God for no man can do
[50:40] this Miracles that doest except God be
[50:42] in him or God be with him Jesus answered
[50:45] and said unto him verily as very verily
[50:47] I say unto thee except a man be born
[50:50] born again he cannot see the kingdom of
[50:52] God see means understand he cannot be
[50:55] conceived the concept of the of the of
[50:58] the new birth the kingdom of God the
[50:59] government said unto me how can a man be
[51:01] born when he's old can he enter the
[51:04] second time into his mother's womb and
[51:05] be born Jesus answered verily verily I
[51:08] say unto you except a man be born of
[51:11] water and of the spirit he cannot enter
[51:13] into the kingdom of God that which is
[51:15] born of the flesh is flesh and that
[51:16] which is born of the spirit is spirit
[51:18] amen and let's go to the next slide
[51:22] please go to the next one out
[51:24] where I was defining the New Birth the
[51:27] next one please amen yes so that is it
[51:29] we want to look at some few definitions
[51:31] of what is the New Birth the new birth
[51:33] actually defined your human being
[51:36] your very substance and the essence of
[51:39] your life is defined by the new birth
[51:42] the new bed also defined Your Existence
[51:45] which is both terrestrial which is your
[51:47] Earthly being and your Celestial
[51:49] existence without the new birth you
[51:52] might be born have parents grow go to
[51:55] college get money get a career marry
[51:58] wife have children or married husband
[52:00] have children have grandchildren have
[52:02] great grandchildren but you don't really
[52:04] know why you are here on this planet
[52:07] because your very essence of your life
[52:09] is not defined
[52:12] you're only going through
[52:14] the routine that everybody goes through
[52:15] as a human being
[52:17] but the celestial purpose of your life
[52:20] is not known to you until the Lord gives
[52:23] you the new birth
[52:25] and then even Define your purpose on
[52:27] this life
[52:28] Moses had a purpose he knew he was a
[52:30] savior intellectually
[52:32] but without the Revelation from the
[52:34] pillar of Fire
[52:36] he went about committing murder
[52:39] so even the good thing that we wanted to
[52:40] do Adolf Hitler had a good reason
[52:43] because Martin Luther wrote that the
[52:45] Jews were Antichrist
[52:47] and Adolf Hitler picked that concept and
[52:50] run wild with it
[52:52] and in his Motif anything Antichrist has
[52:55] to be exterminated
[52:57] so that the rest will be Christ but we
[53:00] know what Adolf Hitler did killed two
[53:02] million plus Jews and even blacks as
[53:04] well
[53:05] but he didn't fulfill their purpose
[53:08] the Eternal purpose for his life
[53:11] so the new birth actually reveal your
[53:14] function your functionality
[53:16] on this planet amen
[53:19] It Will Reveal Your Existence which is
[53:20] your if it's recording biology is your
[53:22] your Anatomy your very being and then
[53:25] your physiology how you function the new
[53:28] birth defines that for you
[53:30] and the new birth is nothing that the
[53:32] Holy Ghost baptism
[53:34] is Christ in you the seed God planted in
[53:37] you as we read from the scripture that
[53:39] Joshua the high priest was standing
[53:40] before the angel of the Lord and that
[53:42] and and Satan was resisting him in every
[53:46] human being is in him to do something
[53:48] good
[53:49] but there's Satan standing at the right
[53:51] hand to resist you from doing what is
[53:54] the purpose of God Amen
[53:57] Glory Hallelujah to the Lord blessed be
[54:00] the name of the Lord and I was looking
[54:01] at this picture about the mother holding
[54:03] the baby and I was listening to brother
[54:05] Troy how sweet to hold a newborn baby
[54:08] how glorious when we are born into the
[54:10] hands of God that the almighty hold you
[54:13] in his arms
[54:15] it is pressure just as we human beings
[54:17] when a baby is born into the family we
[54:19] rejoice and are happy and have
[54:21] festivities God the Kingdom of Heaven
[54:24] rejoices when a baby is born into the
[54:27] house of the Lord amen so the new birth
[54:30] is everything to the Lord and it's
[54:32] everything to you amen is is simply one
[54:36] of the simple concept of the Bible of
[54:38] our Christian life but it is the most
[54:40] important in your life
[54:42] because you can go and go and go and do
[54:45] so many things but without a new birth
[54:48] we are just sitting at the same place we
[54:50] are not doing nothing
[54:51] so we need a holy ghost baptism every
[54:54] man on this planet regardless of your
[54:56] age you need to be born again
[54:59] because a new birth will let you know
[55:01] where you came from
[55:03] what you are doing on this Earth and
[55:05] when you live this flesh where you go to
[55:08] so it's something that each and every
[55:09] individual has to examine his life or
[55:12] her life to make Assurance doubly or
[55:14] triply sure that I quickly is born again
[55:19] that you you can put your name there I
[55:22] have Christ in me amen you can have all
[55:25] the achievement you want you can invent
[55:27] you can be a billionaire you can be a
[55:30] president you can be a pastor a prophet
[55:33] a whatever but without Christ on the
[55:35] inside
[55:37] your purpose is not defined
[55:39] and that's why we cannot underestimate
[55:42] or over emphasize the essence of the
[55:45] Holy Ghost baptism
[55:46] Glory Hallelujah
[55:51] [Applause]
[55:55] our Lord is
[55:57] a living Christ let's just look at the
[56:00] quotes
[56:01] that the prophet talk about
[56:04] I think let's go the previous one that I
[56:06] didn't thank you that is a crisis the
[56:09] mystery of God revealed
[56:11] 63 paragraph 233 say Luke
[56:14] Christ in you make him make him Christ
[56:18] the center of life of the revelation
[56:21] Christ in you so without Christ in you
[56:24] Christ is not the center of Revelation
[56:27] I want you to just absolve and soak this
[56:30] in your heart
[56:31] say Christ in you makes him the center
[56:34] of life of of the revelation
[56:37] so if all the Revelation that Christ has
[56:39] had if he you you he's not in you he
[56:43] doesn't make he doesn't become the
[56:45] center of it
[56:46] see Christ's life in you makes him the
[56:49] center of the revelation
[56:51] Christ in the Bible makes the Bible
[56:54] complete revelation of Christ
[56:56] which has been accomplished by Christ in
[56:59] you
[57:00] now makes you not him
[57:02] makes you the complete Revelation not
[57:06] only the Revelation but of the whole
[57:08] thing
[57:09] the terrestrial the Earthly existence
[57:11] and the selection existence
[57:14] so Christ in you is the most important
[57:16] thing in this life
[57:18] amen Glory Hallelujah to the Lord
[57:21] say what is God trying to do
[57:25] he's trying to put Christ in you
[57:28] and in me
[57:29] amen all that Christ is doing death on
[57:33] Calvary sending Prophet sending the rain
[57:36] having trees giving you a house giving
[57:39] you a job give you a family is to trying
[57:42] to put himself in you amen
[57:45] so that he'll become the center of the
[57:48] of the revelation of the Bible so that
[57:50] you become the center of the whole thing
[57:53] the revelation of the whole thing Christ
[57:55] in you amen Glory Hallelujah to the Lord
[57:58] let's go to the next uh quotation
[58:02] what is the baptism with the Holy Ghost
[58:05] it is a spirit it is the spirit
[58:07] baptizing you into the body of Christ
[58:10] it is a new birth just like
[58:13] the natural birth
[58:15] let's say for example children a person
[58:18] a man marries a wife
[58:20] it's just a man and his wife
[58:22] but then they unite together and then
[58:25] they conceive a child you don't see the
[58:27] child thank God for science we can have
[58:29] x-rays and we can see the baby moving
[58:31] and things like that
[58:33] but yes the baby is not in this place
[58:34] it's part of the mother's body but when
[58:36] the baby is born into this Earth she
[58:40] becomes or he becomes part of this Earth
[58:42] the same thing that when you are born
[58:44] into the kingdom of God you become part
[58:47] of the kingdom of God
[58:48] because the body of the child is part of
[58:51] his father and his mother the James is
[58:53] part of his father and his mother the
[58:55] same thing you your very life was
[58:57] ordained to be part of Christ and the
[59:00] Earth amen
[59:01] Christ Celestia is the husband man and
[59:04] the Earth is his wife
[59:06] and God as you choose your wife and your
[59:09] husband God also make choices there's
[59:12] the bulk of the Earth but God chose you
[59:15] sister Embrace to be missing Jesus
[59:17] Christ God chose you sister Virginia to
[59:20] be the wife of Jesus Christ God chose
[59:23] you better Keepers to be the words of
[59:25] Jesus Christ God choose brother Jack and
[59:27] every one of you to be Mrs Jesus Christ
[59:30] amen that is the love of God for you
[59:33] amen the Earth you are wearing maybe the
[59:36] clay or the the mountain in Colorado is
[59:39] more glorious
[59:40] but God didn't choose to live in the
[59:42] mountains of Colorado
[59:43] God didn't choose to live in the
[59:45] mountains of Kilimanjaro in Africa God
[59:47] didn't choose to live in the mountains
[59:48] of Everest but God chose to dwell in you
[59:52] Glory Hallelujah
[59:54] so he said what is the Holy Spirit what
[59:56] is the baptism with the Holy Spirit is
[59:57] the spirit baptizing you to the body of
[59:59] Christ it is a new breath so the prophet
[1:00:01] is in the Holy Ghost baptism and the new
[1:00:03] birth is the same thing it is the spirit
[1:00:05] of God coming in and filling you after
[1:00:08] you've repented so you have to repent
[1:00:11] you have to forsake yourself having
[1:00:13] heard his word and being baptized in
[1:00:16] water as an answer of a good conscience
[1:00:18] toward God
[1:00:19] then you are now a candidate to receive
[1:00:23] the Holy Ghost baptism
[1:00:24] glory to the Lord let's go to the next
[1:00:27] slide
[1:00:31] the Lord he's good yes two three four
[1:00:34] same message Christ is the ministry of
[1:00:36] God revealed what is the new birth you
[1:00:38] say well but Abraham what is the new
[1:00:40] birth it is the revelation of Jesus
[1:00:41] Christ personally to you and I want you
[1:00:45] to underline the word personally
[1:00:47] I remember when we were taught in school
[1:00:48] pharmacy school when the professor said
[1:00:49] I hold you responsible for this
[1:00:52] this is very important so you have to
[1:00:54] know this is coming in exams
[1:00:56] so they are certain keyword that give
[1:00:58] you cues and clues as to what the
[1:01:00] professor is talking about and so the
[1:01:02] Lord is giving you a cue of what the new
[1:01:05] birth is it's not about the past I know
[1:01:07] it's not about the ministry it's not
[1:01:09] about your mother it's not about your
[1:01:11] husband and your wife it is about you
[1:01:14] individual
[1:01:15] so when it comes to the New Birth use
[1:01:17] your thumb and point it to yourself it's
[1:01:19] about me
[1:01:21] not my brother
[1:01:22] there's a son that goes like it's me
[1:01:24] it's me it's me oh Lord standing in the
[1:01:28] need of prayer it's me it's me it's me
[1:01:31] oh Lord standing in the need of prayer
[1:01:35] not my brother not my sister it's me oh
[1:01:37] Lord standing in the need of prayer it's
[1:01:41] me it's me it's me oh Lord standing in
[1:01:45] the need of prayer it's meaning the Holy
[1:01:48] Ghost nobody Troy nobody's smiling not
[1:01:51] not my sisters over here it's me it's
[1:01:55] you personally and if you make it
[1:01:57] personally
[1:01:58] because you got to be sincere and when
[1:02:00] God knows that you are sincere then God
[1:02:02] is obligated to give you the Holy Ghost
[1:02:05] baptism
[1:02:06] because God wants to give it to you more
[1:02:08] than you are ready to receive it
[1:02:10] but we are not sincere
[1:02:12] we don't even call for it we don't Yen
[1:02:14] for it we don't hang out for it we hang
[1:02:17] out for everything under the planet we
[1:02:19] hunger for money
[1:02:21] which is just by dead president have you
[1:02:23] seen American dollar the dollar bills
[1:02:25] it's got Lincoln's Washington's uh
[1:02:28] Andrew Andrew Jackson's you get them and
[1:02:31] they just disappear out of out of within
[1:02:33] a short time because a dead president
[1:02:35] you can't Bank your Hope on that
[1:02:37] President regardless of how much you get
[1:02:40] people have the millions of them and
[1:02:42] they focal away money is a lover
[1:02:45] it doesn't stay so you can't Bank your
[1:02:47] Hope on American dollars or not even
[1:02:49] gold not diamonds not a pound sterling
[1:02:53] not the Euro not your houses so I don't
[1:02:57] know if you watch the news about what
[1:02:58] happened in Hawaii recently is it
[1:03:00] Ireland
[1:03:02] right thank you the Bushfire no Bush
[1:03:05] sorry not Bushfire but unknown fire
[1:03:07] whatever however I started destroy
[1:03:10] houses
[1:03:11] and lives and people were fleeing to the
[1:03:14] ocean
[1:03:15] and these are scriptures being fulfilled
[1:03:18] not that they were not bad people but
[1:03:20] whatever happened
[1:03:21] if you read future home the devil Ram
[1:03:23] said that the devil has power
[1:03:26] in creation
[1:03:28] he can bring thunderstorm
[1:03:30] hurricanes
[1:03:32] he can twist and turn the elements of
[1:03:35] this Earth
[1:03:36] and create disaster
[1:03:38] by you like Joshua the high priest the
[1:03:41] Lord has said an angel of the Lord
[1:03:43] and we're going to bed about when you
[1:03:45] finish reading about who is the Angel of
[1:03:46] the Lord amen
[1:03:48] he's got your ministers with a flame of
[1:03:51] fire that Speak Life to protect you amen
[1:03:55] to walk around you the word that you
[1:03:58] hear is not the worst of a man
[1:04:00] but is the Lord speaking and when you
[1:04:03] receive it into your heart that would
[1:04:04] become lives it becomes your protection
[1:04:07] it becomes a barrier which separates you
[1:04:10] from distraction
[1:04:14] sudden sickness could have killed you
[1:04:17] you've now gone with Corona Coronavirus
[1:04:20] but the Lord didn't allow Corona virus
[1:04:23] to take you down
[1:04:24] and you're still here
[1:04:25] you could have gone with whatever
[1:04:27] infection that you had
[1:04:29] car accident wrecks
[1:04:31] depression some people get depression
[1:04:34] and the next is what commit suicide
[1:04:37] but there's something in you
[1:04:39] you get depressed sometimes you get sick
[1:04:41] sometimes but there's an uncle a control
[1:04:43] tower
[1:04:45] the Holy Ghost baptism the pillar of
[1:04:47] Fire
[1:04:48] that holds your heart from committing
[1:04:51] suicide
[1:04:52] that heals you from depression that even
[1:04:55] protected from depression and
[1:04:56] suppression of the enemy amen said I am
[1:04:59] the Lord that heals all your sickness
[1:05:02] and afflictions amen that's how much you
[1:05:05] are blessed
[1:05:06] so is that Revelation it is a revelation
[1:05:08] of Jesus Christ personally to you
[1:05:13] not you join a church you shook a hand
[1:05:16] you done something different you said a
[1:05:18] Creed you promise to leave a a good a
[1:05:21] code of rules but Christ the Bible
[1:05:25] so Christ is the Bible
[1:05:27] he's the way that was revealed to you
[1:05:30] and no matter what anybody says what
[1:05:32] takes place is Christ Pastor priest
[1:05:35] whatever it might be is Christ in you
[1:05:39] amen that is a revelation that the
[1:05:40] church was built upon
[1:05:43] and that's the Revelation that is the
[1:05:44] church is being built upon now Amen
[1:05:47] brother cannot live in you
[1:05:49] I cannot live in you your husband or
[1:05:52] your wife cannot live in you
[1:05:54] we can live with you but there's only
[1:05:57] one person that can incarnate himself in
[1:05:59] you that is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:06:01] himself
[1:06:02] amen
[1:06:04] Glory Hallelujah
[1:06:07] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:06:14] that is what the Lord is trying to do
[1:06:16] amen
[1:06:17] amen you want to put his very life in
[1:06:19] you
[1:06:20] that you become him that he will become
[1:06:23] the center of of the Bible
[1:06:25] through you amen
[1:06:27] glory to the Lord
[1:06:30] let's go to the next scripture where is
[1:06:33] the kingdom of God located where can we
[1:06:34] locate the kingdom of God
[1:06:36] just ask Nicole the most came to Jesus
[1:06:38] Christ he was fishing and hunting for
[1:06:39] the kingdom of God
[1:06:41] but he couldn't see the kingdom of God
[1:06:43] though the kingdom of God was standing
[1:06:45] right before him
[1:06:46] if the Lord doesn't give you the
[1:06:48] spiritual ears and eyes to see the word
[1:06:52] the word will go through these years and
[1:06:54] pass through the other year
[1:06:56] but when the Holy Ghost there's
[1:06:57] something in you the control tower
[1:06:58] there's a magnet that can that can
[1:07:02] magnetize The Onion the metal in you
[1:07:05] when the word is preached the control
[1:07:07] tower that captures the word and
[1:07:09] processes the word by the way of the New
[1:07:11] Birth by the way of a life that you
[1:07:14] don't live the old life anymore now your
[1:07:16] life that you live is a Divine Life of
[1:07:18] Jesus Christ
[1:07:20] so Luke 17 20 21 and when he was
[1:07:23] demanded of the Pharisees when the
[1:07:25] kingdom of God should come remember they
[1:07:27] didn't ask where but they said when
[1:07:29] because man is a time being he's always
[1:07:32] looking for time
[1:07:33] if I know something's going to happen I
[1:07:35] want to get ready for it but if nothing
[1:07:37] is going on let's drink let's have fun
[1:07:39] let's party everything is just as it
[1:07:42] used to be
[1:07:43] but then when he was demanded when the
[1:07:45] kingdom of God should come he answered
[1:07:47] and said the kingdom of God cometh not
[1:07:50] with observation
[1:07:51] neither shall he say low here low there
[1:07:54] for behold the kingdom of God is within
[1:07:57] you
[1:07:58] just like Jesus had a question wrong he
[1:08:01] had the answer wrong now let's see uh
[1:08:03] the the Francis or whoever asked the
[1:08:05] question was asking when I want the time
[1:08:09] to give me the date
[1:08:10] that year
[1:08:12] 2022
[1:08:14] or year of Our Lord ad 2054 or year 3056
[1:08:20] but then Jesus said the kingdom of God
[1:08:22] doesn't come with observation
[1:08:24] but the kingdom of God is within you
[1:08:26] you don't have to worry about time
[1:08:29] but worry about the source
[1:08:32] when you get a source everything will
[1:08:34] congeal
[1:08:36] into the same thing amen
[1:08:38] don't worry about when this is going to
[1:08:40] happen when California is going to sing
[1:08:42] when it's going to happen that is not
[1:08:44] Essence but get the kingdom of God in
[1:08:46] your heart
[1:08:47] you won't worry about California you're
[1:08:49] gonna be like Abraham you'll be sitting
[1:08:52] in a city called Shalom what is the city
[1:08:54] in in Egypt where the Jews were were
[1:08:56] living
[1:08:58] Goshen thank you you'll be living in
[1:09:00] Goshen and you wouldn't worry about what
[1:09:01] is going on in Egypt amen
[1:09:04] Egypt is not your promise
[1:09:06] God took you from Egypt and planted you
[1:09:09] in Goshen and taking you to the promised
[1:09:11] land Canaan
[1:09:13] Canaan is the Holy Ghost baptism where
[1:09:15] you can plan when you can take a sword
[1:09:17] and kill every amalachite every anger
[1:09:20] every fornication every adultery Every
[1:09:24] Lie every spirit that is ungodly which
[1:09:27] is standing on your ground on your land
[1:09:29] you can take the sword of prayer and of
[1:09:32] the word and you can consume that Spirit
[1:09:34] out of your life amen any spirit that
[1:09:37] has captivated your loved one your
[1:09:39] children your husband your wife your
[1:09:41] family your nephew you can take the
[1:09:43] sword of the word of the word and
[1:09:45] destroy the amalakad and the jebusite
[1:09:48] and plant what you want to plant amen
[1:09:50] because the Lord has made you God like
[1:09:52] Moses he said Moses I'm going to make
[1:09:55] you God unto the people and and Aaron
[1:09:57] will be your Prophet so now the Lord has
[1:10:00] Moses was born a prophet but the Lord
[1:10:02] has elevated Moses for me the prophet
[1:10:03] word to God
[1:10:05] and Joshua sorry and Aaron who was the
[1:10:08] high priest to be a prophet
[1:10:10] and when called you you're a human being
[1:10:13] but God Elevate you to be a son of the
[1:10:16] Living God to be a daughter of the
[1:10:18] Living God to be a Celestial being that
[1:10:21] can create that can speak into creation
[1:10:23] and speak out of creation you've got the
[1:10:26] power and authority to speak two more
[1:10:29] and Cancers out of creation
[1:10:31] and you've got their power and authority
[1:10:32] to speak health and goodness and love
[1:10:35] and faith and blessing and prosperity
[1:10:38] and Glory into the lives of people amen
[1:10:41] that power is laying right on the inside
[1:10:43] of you but it is the Holy Ghost baptism
[1:10:46] to bring that power into effect without
[1:10:49] the Holy Ghost baptism just as Joshua
[1:10:51] the high priest standing
[1:10:54] before the Lord
[1:10:55] and Satan on the right side the power
[1:10:58] the right side the right hand signifies
[1:11:01] power
[1:11:02] the power has been hindered he couldn't
[1:11:04] manifest you can do all you want but you
[1:11:07] won't amount to nothing
[1:11:08] but when the Holy Ghost comes in you
[1:11:11] don't see Satan sitting on the right
[1:11:12] side did you see the Lord we begin Satan
[1:11:14] you don't have to do nothing the Lord
[1:11:16] has rebuked Satan out of your life and
[1:11:19] now you go and set others free amen
[1:11:23] glory to the Lord so the kingdom of God
[1:11:25] does not come with observation it
[1:11:28] doesn't come with sin but it comes it's
[1:11:31] an eternal manifestation of Christ in
[1:11:34] you as the word is being preached to you
[1:11:36] and you see the word the word forms is a
[1:11:39] life form and I'm going to switch here
[1:11:40] to the ministry amen what God ordained
[1:11:44] to bring you the kingdom of God let's go
[1:11:46] to the next scripture if we miss Psalm
[1:11:48] 104 1-5
[1:11:50] say Bless the Lord O My Soul O Lord my
[1:11:53] God Thou Art very great thou art clothed
[1:11:55] with Anna and Majesty who covers thyself
[1:11:59] with light as with a garment who
[1:12:01] stretches out the heavens like a curtain
[1:12:03] who lay the beams of his Chambers in
[1:12:05] Waters who makes the clouds his
[1:12:08] childhood how can the club be child
[1:12:10] who walketh upon the wings of the wind
[1:12:13] who maketh his angels Spirit his
[1:12:16] ministers a flaming fire
[1:12:18] who led the foundations of the earth
[1:12:19] that it should not be removed for
[1:12:21] forever amen Glory Hallelujah to the
[1:12:24] Lord we can I mean digress on this one
[1:12:27] but we just want to go to the fourth
[1:12:29] verse who makes his angels Spirit his
[1:12:33] ministry ministers a flaming fire
[1:12:36] what is a fire is the pillar of Fire
[1:12:39] before the foundation of the world God
[1:12:41] also then you pastors Apostles Prophet
[1:12:44] teachers and evangelists to bring you
[1:12:48] the hand is the object that can touch
[1:12:50] something and bring it to the head the
[1:12:52] foot cannot touch the head
[1:12:54] but the hand can go down and grab the
[1:12:57] shoe and grab whatever and bring it to
[1:12:59] whatever to the Head
[1:13:01] now the hand is the process is the
[1:13:04] ministry it's the ministering spirit
[1:13:07] that God has told him for you to take
[1:13:09] you from your Earthly Dimension and
[1:13:12] bring you to the celestial dimension
[1:13:14] that is your faithful Ministry let's
[1:13:16] clap for the fifo ministry amen
[1:13:20] [Applause]
[1:13:22] God bless you over the Jack but I try
[1:13:24] but I Smiley but uh but uh all of all of
[1:13:27] you amen by the Jerry brother Clinton
[1:13:29] and everyone that ministers in songs and
[1:13:31] in everything amen everybody is very
[1:13:34] important amen not only the fight for
[1:13:37] Ministry but every one of you the son
[1:13:39] the children everyone mothers sisters
[1:13:42] your prayers is very very very important
[1:13:45] your prayers go to anoint the FIFA
[1:13:47] Ministry to do what they're supposed to
[1:13:49] do without your prayers without Aaron
[1:13:52] and Joshua holding the hands of Moses
[1:13:54] Moses was weak and tired Moses couldn't
[1:13:57] achieve much but when Joshua and Moses
[1:14:00] held the hand of Aaron held the hand of
[1:14:02] Moses Israel had a victory and if you
[1:14:05] hold the hands of your ministers Amen in
[1:14:08] prayers in whatever support that your
[1:14:10] pastor your ministers need then you see
[1:14:12] Victory all around that camp
[1:14:15] glory to the Lord amen
[1:14:17] and when we are here when the fivefold
[1:14:19] ministry is preaching you might not see
[1:14:21] physically but they are angels around
[1:14:24] if the Lord will open your Supernatural
[1:14:26] eyes you see that all these places Angel
[1:14:28] of the Lord angels of the Lord is around
[1:14:30] the Bible said that the angels of the
[1:14:32] Lord and Camp around them
[1:14:34] that fear his name that call upon his
[1:14:36] name
[1:14:37] for forfeiting your you could have taken
[1:14:39] this time to take your family to the
[1:14:41] park to go to restaurant if you go to
[1:14:43] restaurant people are eating and eating
[1:14:44] and eating and eating
[1:14:46] right we can that's the only time you
[1:14:48] have off but for you coming here not not
[1:14:51] grudgingly but from your own desire
[1:14:54] your own heart to come and hear the word
[1:14:56] of the Lord the Lord will recompense you
[1:14:58] with blessing amen and the Lord does
[1:15:01] that through the ministry amen the Lord
[1:15:04] could have chosen their son to preach
[1:15:06] the word the Lord could have used the
[1:15:07] moon and the mountains and the stars but
[1:15:10] the Lord chose weak men
[1:15:13] to preach the gospel of the Lord Jesus
[1:15:15] Christ men who are just like you amen
[1:15:18] men that they don't qualify but God
[1:15:20] calls them and qualifies them
[1:15:22] there's nobody who qualifies to be a
[1:15:23] preacher there's nobody qualified to be
[1:15:26] a prophet
[1:15:27] God calls them in their unqualified way
[1:15:29] and God said that this is your
[1:15:31] certificate go and do my work
[1:15:34] Moses wasn't qualified he was a murderer
[1:15:38] Paul was a murderer from his own word he
[1:15:40] said I'm the least of the Apostles
[1:15:42] because I wasted wasted means I I
[1:15:45] persecuted and and killed and chasing
[1:15:47] the the Disciples of God
[1:15:49] but he said by Grace I am what I am
[1:15:52] and I've even worked harder than more
[1:15:55] than Peter you know he didn't need to
[1:15:56] see Jesus Christ physically only by
[1:15:58] Revelation but he said I've worked even
[1:16:00] more than Peter and Cole who slept with
[1:16:02] Jesus Christ who done with him
[1:16:05] so it doesn't matter where you're coming
[1:16:06] from it doesn't matter your background
[1:16:08] it doesn't matter the fingers that point
[1:16:10] at you God those doesn't see those
[1:16:12] fingers he sees you amen it doesn't
[1:16:16] matter your accuses amen sister doesn't
[1:16:18] matter whatever circumstance you are in
[1:16:20] God doesn't look at the circumstance he
[1:16:22] looks at your heart and your desires
[1:16:25] amen he looks at what you are trying to
[1:16:27] achieve for him trying to raise your
[1:16:29] children in the fear of the Lord maybe
[1:16:31] God is going to use your children to to
[1:16:32] be ministers to be women of God to stand
[1:16:35] for the Lord Jesus Christ God is looking
[1:16:37] at that amen it doesn't look at it
[1:16:39] doesn't look at your bank account you
[1:16:41] must be as broke as a mouse broke as a
[1:16:44] cat it doesn't matter
[1:16:46] you might be living man to month and day
[1:16:48] by day you might be struggling and
[1:16:50] hustling to make make ends meet but it
[1:16:53] doesn't matter to God
[1:16:55] he's looking at the cut of Jesus Christ
[1:16:56] in you
[1:17:05] and sometimes the Lord put us in that
[1:17:06] situation for purpose
[1:17:08] it's not the devil no the Lord can drain
[1:17:11] your pocket drink your wallet drain your
[1:17:13] prayers so you'll be looking for the
[1:17:15] coins I need these coins to buy
[1:17:16] something
[1:17:17] not for the kids you know but you
[1:17:19] yourself to buy something you know
[1:17:20] sometimes get a question to the kids to
[1:17:23] buy candy no this one mother or Daddy
[1:17:24] needs the coins they add up you need the
[1:17:26] cities you know you need a I mentioned
[1:17:29] city city currency in Ghana sorry you
[1:17:31] need a dollar bill one dollars to add up
[1:17:33] to buy something to buy gas to pay some
[1:17:35] bills to put in a bank account to add up
[1:17:38] to pay the rent to pay the mortgage God
[1:17:40] does it for a purpose and he wants you
[1:17:43] to Rejoice even in that situation
[1:17:46] [Applause]
[1:17:47] [Music]
[1:17:52] don't worry about the devil no the devil
[1:17:55] is just an executor
[1:17:57] when you go to court right who give the
[1:17:59] Judgment the judge
[1:18:01] who is the one who takes the the what do
[1:18:04] you call it
[1:18:05] um
[1:18:07] who
[1:18:09] the one who is guilty who taken to jail
[1:18:11] is it
[1:18:12] come on Defender thank you what is the
[1:18:15] defendant if he's found guilty to jail
[1:18:18] the police the sheriff
[1:18:20] by Sheriff is just acting on orders of
[1:18:22] the judge
[1:18:24] so don't be annoyed with the police or
[1:18:26] the sheriff
[1:18:28] don't be annoyed with the Devil
[1:18:31] that's what I'm trying to arrive at
[1:18:34] leave the devil alone
[1:18:37] he's just doing his job
[1:18:43] that's all he's supposed to do
[1:18:46] don't worry about the devil leave him
[1:18:47] alone
[1:18:49] he's just ordained to do that for you
[1:18:52] his father is a blessing to you
[1:18:55] you won't believe him the Devil is a
[1:18:57] blessing yes without the devil nothing
[1:18:59] will come out of you
[1:19:04] you won't grow you're gonna be stagnant
[1:19:06] and static
[1:19:07] so the devil has to has to I mean
[1:19:09] bombard you with all the trials just
[1:19:12] like the police handcuff you change your
[1:19:14] clothing give you prisoner clothing
[1:19:16] but I know that is for a purpose
[1:19:18] know that you are innocent you never
[1:19:20] committed any crime
[1:19:23] you have been put in jail to preach to
[1:19:25] somebody in jail
[1:19:28] so Paul was put in jail is that right
[1:19:30] what came out of it the New Testament
[1:19:35] or admit majority of the New Testament
[1:19:36] was written by Paul when he was in jail
[1:19:39] he was comfortably right in the New
[1:19:41] Testament and when Mary or James visit
[1:19:44] just give it to them go give it to
[1:19:46] church probably you never thought he was
[1:19:48] going to be a Bible
[1:19:50] he only knew it was letter to
[1:19:51] Corinthians
[1:19:52] the lord gave you something radish to
[1:19:54] Corinthians the galinians the ephesal
[1:19:57] church the Hebrew church and so on and
[1:19:59] so forth
[1:20:00] and then he didn't know God doesn't show
[1:20:03] you everything all at once
[1:20:06] he gives you and shows you what you need
[1:20:07] at this moment
[1:20:09] so don't try to use this guy here your
[1:20:12] little brain to try to figure out what
[1:20:14] is going to happen tomorrow
[1:20:16] you just want to give yourself migraine
[1:20:18] and end up taking pills for them you
[1:20:20] don't need those migraines just thank
[1:20:23] God Lord thank you for today thank you
[1:20:25] for this day when tomorrow comes you
[1:20:27] take it off tomorrow
[1:20:35] so he gave me the many things to
[1:20:37] minister unto you the word of the Lord
[1:20:38] and when they stand here brother Smiley
[1:20:41] was ordained before the foundation of
[1:20:42] the world but I try was ordained before
[1:20:44] the world began but that threat was so
[1:20:46] dim before the world began and all those
[1:20:47] of you Minister and different manners
[1:20:49] when they stand here
[1:20:51] the angel of the Lord is with them to
[1:20:52] minister to you
[1:20:53] they are the ministering Spirit they are
[1:20:56] the angel of the Lord to speak angel
[1:20:58] means a messenger someone sent by God to
[1:21:02] give a message to you because you are so
[1:21:04] special you are the Queen of Heaven
[1:21:06] though you live in this flesh you are
[1:21:08] the Queen of Heaven you are in the mind
[1:21:10] of God
[1:21:11] just think about it don't look at your
[1:21:14] circumstance amen one time was it a give
[1:21:16] you a look at the circumstance he said
[1:21:18] if the Lord is with us then why why are
[1:21:21] his wonders why are we broke why do we
[1:21:23] have to plant our corn and have to wake
[1:21:25] up in the night to go through the corn
[1:21:27] because of this amalakas and midianites
[1:21:31] that was the policeman the sheriff
[1:21:33] who arrested Gideon to bring Gideon to
[1:21:36] who he was
[1:21:37] he never have an idea he was a judge no
[1:21:40] he didn't qualify to be a judge
[1:21:43] but when the right right time came the
[1:21:46] Lord showed up and said Gideon go in
[1:21:49] this might
[1:21:50] you know God the Lord shed his glory
[1:21:52] with his children
[1:21:54] yes he did he said said the sword of
[1:21:56] Gideon and of the Lord
[1:21:59] it is they said the sword of the Lord
[1:22:01] and he gives the sword or jagdav and of
[1:22:04] the Lord
[1:22:05] the sort of Keepers and of the Lord the
[1:22:08] sort of uh uh uh I can't even think now
[1:22:11] the sort of every one of you put your
[1:22:12] name there and the Lord
[1:22:14] amen because
[1:22:17] Jack capez is Christ
[1:22:21] the form that he chose to manifest
[1:22:25] he chose a form to manifest in you Simba
[1:22:28] before the foundation of the world
[1:22:30] it doesn't matter what you're going
[1:22:31] through
[1:22:32] the Lord allows he puts you in situation
[1:22:34] to go through that
[1:22:36] look at Jesus almighty God
[1:22:38] who can just blink his eyes and millions
[1:22:41] of angels will come he became a poor
[1:22:44] person
[1:22:45] arrested
[1:22:48] in in a court of uh what's the name no
[1:22:51] Pharaoh The Herald
[1:22:55] pilate thank you and being questioned
[1:22:58] and this is the man who created this man
[1:23:01] how can the creature question his
[1:23:04] creator
[1:23:09] sometimes the Lord lets you go through
[1:23:10] certain Affliction you understand your
[1:23:12] job
[1:23:13] you could be the manager but the Lord
[1:23:15] will let somebody down there
[1:23:17] he'll be nagging you
[1:23:19] and making life stressful for you making
[1:23:22] you whip tears
[1:23:24] but you created her and him
[1:23:26] the Christ in you
[1:23:28] but the Lord allows it for purpose to
[1:23:31] bring Divine love out of your heart
[1:23:33] that you can still pray for the person
[1:23:35] and forgive them
[1:23:37] you can still love them
[1:23:39] just like Jesus love is enemies
[1:23:41] without that you can show Divine love
[1:23:43] divine love was planting you before the
[1:23:45] foundation of the world but they take
[1:23:46] the trials it takes somebody to hate you
[1:23:49] without their cause for you to pray for
[1:23:51] him Without a Cause
[1:23:53] with love amen and that is where the
[1:23:57] Lord is bringing us to that way you can
[1:23:58] laugh even those who don't deserve
[1:24:01] you can pray for them those who don't
[1:24:02] deserve to be prayed for
[1:24:04] you can pray for the small cat on the
[1:24:06] street you can pray for drug addict you
[1:24:08] can allow the drug addict you don't
[1:24:10] condemn them you condemn their sin
[1:24:11] around them but they are God's creation
[1:24:14] and you love them with all of your heart
[1:24:16] and you pray for them and you wish them
[1:24:18] you a Creator you create them in your
[1:24:21] heart I don't want to see him on the
[1:24:22] street drinking and doing drugs when I
[1:24:25] drive by I pray for those people Lord
[1:24:27] take him from the streets and bless him
[1:24:29] with eternal life and bless him with a
[1:24:31] home and give him a family
[1:24:33] that is what is in you to do amen the
[1:24:37] Lord has given every attribute in you
[1:24:39] and we have to manifest all the
[1:24:41] attributes amen glory let's go to the
[1:24:44] next slide
[1:24:46] it's a weird slide
[1:24:48] amen spontaneous aiming versus cos amen
[1:24:51] glory to the Lord amen
[1:24:58] glory to our Lord we're talking about
[1:25:00] amines that comes spontaneously from the
[1:25:02] heart and the aiming that is correct so
[1:25:04] let's just break it down a little bit
[1:25:06] when it says spontaneous is something
[1:25:08] comes as a result of a certain impulse
[1:25:10] without premeditation without apparent
[1:25:13] external cause or impulse
[1:25:15] it's not me telling you that hey you got
[1:25:17] to say Amen no but out of his heart
[1:25:21] when the word cookies is hot the aiming
[1:25:24] comes from his heart
[1:25:26] and that's what pleases the Lord and
[1:25:28] then let's look at coercion practice of
[1:25:29] persuading someone to do something by
[1:25:31] using force or threats question involves
[1:25:34] compelling a party to act in an
[1:25:36] involutely involuntary
[1:25:38] involuntary right
[1:25:40] I miss my British with English
[1:25:43] reduce the involuntary Americans will
[1:25:45] say what involuntary
[1:25:47] help thank you a voluntary manner by the
[1:25:50] use of threats including threat to use a
[1:25:53] force against the party it involves a
[1:25:55] set of forceful action which violate the
[1:25:57] Free Will of an individual in order to
[1:26:00] induce a desired response now another
[1:26:02] sister word is Cooks gently persuading
[1:26:06] or flattering someone
[1:26:07] I'll hold hold off to the story of
[1:26:09] Duncan I'll give that one later amen now
[1:26:12] when you talk about spontaneous
[1:26:13] something that comes from your heart
[1:26:16] that place is the Lord the lord loves
[1:26:19] spontaneous amen
[1:26:21] the Lord doesn't want us to force you to
[1:26:23] say Amen
[1:26:25] if you don't need to see me don't say it
[1:26:28] but if it comes let it come from your
[1:26:29] heart
[1:26:31] and we the minister so we don't want to
[1:26:33] force people to say Amen
[1:26:35] because then you are pleasing if I ask
[1:26:38] you to say Amen the amen is not unto me
[1:26:40] it's unto the Lord
[1:26:42] it's unto the word of the Lord coming to
[1:26:44] you amen
[1:26:46] and I'll go a little bit further so
[1:26:48] let's go to the next slide I'll use
[1:26:50] parabraham for example
[1:26:54] glory to the Lord oh okay let's read the
[1:26:56] scriptures the same scripture in Hebrews
[1:26:58] was in Psalms and of the angels He said
[1:27:01] who make it is Angels prayed and his
[1:27:02] ministers a flame of fire but unto their
[1:27:04] son is said thy Throne oh God is forever
[1:27:07] and ever a skepter of righteousness it's
[1:27:10] a skepta of the of that Kingdom so the
[1:27:12] angels of the Lord everything is
[1:27:14] pointing to Jesus Christ the amen is not
[1:27:17] coming to the minister he's coming to
[1:27:19] the Lord Jesus Christ amen and I'll give
[1:27:22] you some instances let's go to the slide
[1:27:25] and I'm not going to read everything I'm
[1:27:26] I'll just now read a story Abraham was
[1:27:28] talking about he was in a convention
[1:27:31] there was this Catholic priest Reverend
[1:27:33] John S Stanley OSD and I was what is OSD
[1:27:36] who is this order of Saint Dominic is
[1:27:39] one of the Catholic branches anyway so
[1:27:42] this man was at the meeting and everyone
[1:27:44] was thinking
[1:27:45] this one is disagreeing with everything
[1:27:47] that I'm preaching that was in the
[1:27:49] brahm's mind
[1:27:50] because the man was just looking at him
[1:27:52] up and down shaking his head and he was
[1:27:54] wondering what's going on what's going
[1:27:55] on in the mind of this man so in William
[1:27:57] Brown's mind this man was rejecting
[1:28:00] everything he was preaching let me read
[1:28:02] a little a little here and on this
[1:28:04] scripture what caused me to form My Eyes
[1:28:06] Upon This was something that happened
[1:28:08] just recently in Phoenix Arizona it was
[1:28:10] the last day of the service that I was
[1:28:12] to speak at the International Convention
[1:28:13] of the four gospel businessman and in
[1:28:15] this convention there was a visitor with
[1:28:17] us which was a Catholic bishop which is
[1:28:19] of the Chaldean rights of the apostolic
[1:28:22] Catholic Church the most Reverend John S
[1:28:25] Stanley other of since Dominic he's the
[1:28:28] Archbishop of Metro Metropolitan United
[1:28:30] States in a Catholic Church this
[1:28:32] happened to be his card and his address
[1:28:34] okay let's go on
[1:28:37] and so
[1:28:38] let me read that let me just jump to the
[1:28:40] the red side and as I was speaking he
[1:28:42] kept watching me and I thought this that
[1:28:44] man suddenly is disagreeing with
[1:28:46] everything that I see and you know you
[1:28:48] could just see him he would keep his
[1:28:50] eyes his head up and down but I didn't
[1:28:52] know what was just exactly working on
[1:28:55] him let's go to 31.
[1:29:02] okay 31 you have 31.
[1:29:05] oh it's at the bottom okay okay let's go
[1:29:09] oh here we go and then okay and then
[1:29:12] thinking this man had disagreed with me
[1:29:13] so much when I raised when I raise up to
[1:29:16] speak this message I turn in my Bible to
[1:29:18] find a page let's go further you can
[1:29:21] read the rest later but let's go to the
[1:29:24] next slide okay and this Catholic priest
[1:29:27] got up out of his seat from about 100
[1:29:29] clergy men sitting on the platform walk
[1:29:31] over close to me with all his ropes and
[1:29:33] gowns and crosses and so forth and
[1:29:35] godric and got right up close to me and
[1:29:38] he said my son Be steady God is fixing
[1:29:41] to move
[1:29:45] the Catholic priest that he thought he
[1:29:47] was disagreeing with him
[1:29:49] when Abraham is why I bought him a Bible
[1:29:51] his old Bible was torn apart and the
[1:29:53] wife gave him a a birthday or something
[1:29:55] Bible but the Bible Pages it was once
[1:29:58] all the pages were put together
[1:30:00] and they couldn't start together they
[1:30:01] couldn't open them and he called brother
[1:30:03] Jack Moore and he said I think the
[1:30:05] scripture is in this such and such John
[1:30:07] 16 but yeah but that's what I'm reading
[1:30:10] but in a Catholic priest went to himself
[1:30:13] son God is facing to fix him to speak
[1:30:16] and and the same service the sister of
[1:30:20] the Catholic priest spoke in tongues
[1:30:22] and this Catholic priest if you read
[1:30:24] further I don't have I didn't bring all
[1:30:26] the quotes
[1:30:27] he caught it releases I got it why don't
[1:30:29] why don't depends because I guided
[1:30:31] he said I got it and he started
[1:30:33] jubilating and praising the Lord
[1:30:35] but Ram told he was disagreeing with
[1:30:38] everything
[1:30:39] and it happened to be the preachers
[1:30:41] sometimes we coerce amens because we
[1:30:45] think the people are not listening or
[1:30:48] they are disagreeing but no it's not
[1:30:50] always so
[1:30:52] and it's a it's a I would call it
[1:30:54] tradition that we Heritage in a message
[1:30:56] that when preaching you have to I demand
[1:30:58] you amen you guys are not saying amen
[1:31:01] and I'll give a lot of examples
[1:31:03] but sometimes you drop something from
[1:31:05] your heart
[1:31:06] is the first time people have heard it
[1:31:08] and they need to be quiet to soak it
[1:31:11] down in
[1:31:17] you might be preaching this amen amen
[1:31:19] Pastor Amen brother and you drop
[1:31:21] something dead silence
[1:31:23] all you guys you know you don't agree
[1:31:25] with me no
[1:31:27] they need to soak it in their spirit
[1:31:30] and the Lord want them to soak it in and
[1:31:32] we have to let them soak it in
[1:31:35] don't let out coerce aiming from them
[1:31:37] because if you quest amen you're gonna
[1:31:39] get that fisher amen
[1:31:40] it's just like request a woman to love
[1:31:42] you that love is not love you can cook
[1:31:45] said to love you with money with
[1:31:47] Mansions one day she's gonna leave you
[1:31:49] alone because she didn't love you to
[1:31:51] begin with you were just coaxing it with
[1:31:54] money
[1:31:55] and if you cook the wife of Christ with
[1:31:58] your with force and threat you're gonna
[1:32:00] get that feature amen but it doesn't
[1:32:02] please the Lord the Lord wants us to do
[1:32:05] everything from our heart just as we the
[1:32:07] the the congregation don't tell us what
[1:32:09] we preach they believe that God is
[1:32:11] dealing with us and we should believe in
[1:32:13] them that God is dealing with them and
[1:32:15] we should let the aiming come naturally
[1:32:17] come spontaneously and that place is the
[1:32:20] Lord amen and I give an example there
[1:32:23] was a preacher friend of my pastor and
[1:32:26] he was preaching one day I think
[1:32:27] Friday's service preaching and drop it
[1:32:29] under until funny and amen glory
[1:32:32] hallelujah amen and he dropped something
[1:32:34] and it was dead silence
[1:32:36] he said you guys froze on me he dropped
[1:32:39] his mic and close the service
[1:32:41] so after we're taking right together and
[1:32:43] said but a quick what do you think as a
[1:32:46] person you froze on yourself they didn't
[1:32:47] freeze on you
[1:32:49] because what you drop
[1:32:51] the Holy Ghost was planted in their
[1:32:53] Spirit but because we are used to aiming
[1:32:56] aiming we demand it from the people
[1:32:58] you felt they froze on you but you froze
[1:33:02] on them
[1:33:04] and he said I said I didn't know
[1:33:07] so we need to do don't don't let us not
[1:33:09] demand aiming from the people don't let
[1:33:11] us induce it but let the Holy Ghost
[1:33:14] because this is the Eternal destination
[1:33:16] this is whether they hear they're here
[1:33:18] to be at the other side
[1:33:20] it is eternal way that God ordained with
[1:33:22] the preachers to pray to them
[1:33:24] and it's more important for them to soak
[1:33:26] it in than saying amen
[1:33:28] and let me use myself for example
[1:33:30] sometimes somebody will be preaching one
[1:33:32] of the minister we're preaching and I'm
[1:33:33] standing at the back and I just the Lord
[1:33:36] is dropping things in my others say Amen
[1:33:37] but I'm listening I want to soak
[1:33:39] everything
[1:33:41] because it's aligning even with
[1:33:43] something I'm going to preach and I want
[1:33:44] to soak it in so the fact that somebody
[1:33:47] is not saying amen doesn't Israel means
[1:33:49] he's disagreeing and the father he said
[1:33:51] he says amen doesn't mean he or she's
[1:33:53] understanding
[1:33:55] right
[1:33:58] when the seats were open
[1:34:01] the whole place was like a thunderstorm
[1:34:04] amen and hallelujahs and glorious and
[1:34:06] everything
[1:34:07] and after the service program I think
[1:34:09] Billy Paul was driving by Brown he said
[1:34:10] Billy how was the services was fantastic
[1:34:12] wonderful was awesome you know all the
[1:34:15] adjectives he could describe and said
[1:34:17] Billy did you understand he said yes
[1:34:19] his abilities as the second time has a
[1:34:22] way of asking you he'll just stare at
[1:34:23] you and say did you understand say oh my
[1:34:26] heart sank I said no
[1:34:28] I think the people understood and said
[1:34:30] no I can count there are more people
[1:34:31] just about a couple of them
[1:34:33] because the assists were not even meant
[1:34:35] to reveal at that time
[1:34:37] it was for you and I
[1:34:40] wow they had it there was a time around
[1:34:42] was so disappointed after the Seas were
[1:34:43] open she asked questions and answers and
[1:34:46] her sister asked Ram can you color your
[1:34:48] hair
[1:34:49] I was like we're talking about his suits
[1:34:52] and coloring he said well sister
[1:34:57] it's okay he said I don't have any
[1:34:59] Scripture against that you can if you
[1:35:01] want to color it depends on your motive
[1:35:02] he was so disappointed like we're
[1:35:04] talking about this Dimension breaking
[1:35:06] and you want to color your hair blue
[1:35:08] green what has it got to do with it
[1:35:14] they were saying everybody just pass on
[1:35:16] top of them even I I know some people
[1:35:18] that were there when they say preachers
[1:35:20] and even the preachers they went and
[1:35:21] they were wet to their home and fight
[1:35:22] among the preachers themselves they were
[1:35:25] fighting they went back to the same old
[1:35:26] Pentecostal preaching that they were
[1:35:28] preaching it wasn't all the time yet
[1:35:31] until the right time came that the Lord
[1:35:34] raised some men and women and began to
[1:35:36] break the Thunders their seals and all
[1:35:39] those Revelations to the people of God
[1:35:40] so when we preach we have to give the
[1:35:43] people time
[1:35:44] to soak it in to allow the Holy Ghost to
[1:35:47] bring it to their heart because
[1:35:48] something will drop
[1:35:50] that is their Eternal destination it's a
[1:35:53] revelation the aiming is not important
[1:35:55] the law of the Lord is watching them
[1:35:57] he's standing around watching but they
[1:35:59] want to soaking their husband and
[1:36:00] understand because they're going to use
[1:36:01] that Revelation to live their life
[1:36:03] something will happen to them they're
[1:36:05] gonna need that Revelation and so it has
[1:36:07] to be imbibed in their spirit so that
[1:36:10] when the time comes God will bring it
[1:36:12] out
[1:36:13] and help them in certain situations but
[1:36:15] then if you get so much enthused with
[1:36:18] amen I want my amen you didn't say Amen
[1:36:20] you didn't agree with me then we're
[1:36:22] gonna prevent them from understanding or
[1:36:24] soaking the word of God in their heart
[1:36:26] so let's not let's I think we should get
[1:36:28] that tradition which was I think it's
[1:36:30] been a message I was in a funeral where
[1:36:32] a preacher was upset because a brief
[1:36:35] person didn't say Amen to his word
[1:36:37] someone who has lost a family
[1:36:40] and he was preaching on the Sunday after
[1:36:41] the barrier this preacher was demanding
[1:36:43] his amen and this was a senior preacher
[1:36:47] because that tradition has been the
[1:36:48] message among the preachers that when
[1:36:50] you preach and you don't say Amen it
[1:36:52] means you disagree so a brief person
[1:36:54] should say Amen somebody was mourning
[1:36:57] so sometimes we ministers can also be
[1:36:59] immature we all grow
[1:37:01] so sometimes let's allow The Sovereign
[1:37:03] Lord
[1:37:05] to do what he does
[1:37:07] it's up to me it's up to reject all the
[1:37:09] minister to preach what the brothers do
[1:37:12] and she said that's between them and the
[1:37:13] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:37:15] that is not my way to go and see how our
[1:37:17] sister Jemima is living the the word
[1:37:19] it's not my it's not my duty
[1:37:21] just as he doesn't come and see my house
[1:37:23] how brother is living the life
[1:37:25] we all have faith in God that God is
[1:37:27] helping brother Troy but I Smiley
[1:37:29] brother Jack sister Liz and every one of
[1:37:31] you brother Jimmy the Lord is helping us
[1:37:34] so let allow the word of the Lord to be
[1:37:37] planted in the heart of the people
[1:37:38] because it's not about brother it's not
[1:37:40] about brother Jack it's about the Lord
[1:37:42] Jesus Christ
[1:37:43] and we see Jesus Christ amen
[1:37:49] let's look at Moses sometimes Moses got
[1:37:52] in trouble when the children of Israel
[1:37:53] even did wrong
[1:37:55] don't play with anybody's wife
[1:37:57] even if the man is annoyed with his wife
[1:37:59] Let It Be him not you
[1:38:02] remember when Moses God told Moses to
[1:38:04] speak to the Rock and he got his anger
[1:38:07] got a better part of him and he strived
[1:38:10] a rock
[1:38:10] and the Lord said come here Moses
[1:38:12] because he was mad with the wife of
[1:38:15] Christ because of their conduct
[1:38:17] we are servant just like a European or a
[1:38:20] son to go and deliver a letter you
[1:38:22] delivered a letter
[1:38:23] don't wait for them to open up and tell
[1:38:25] them read for them that is up to them
[1:38:27] you were just to serve them later okay
[1:38:29] ma'am this is a letter from their court
[1:38:30] or from wherever Bank whatever
[1:38:33] God bless you goodbye adios go your way
[1:38:35] so ours is to deliver the message to the
[1:38:38] people
[1:38:39] and we trust the Lord who gave us the
[1:38:41] message it's on the other side
[1:38:42] connecting them with a message
[1:38:45] amen Glory Hallelujah
[1:38:48] blessed be the name of the Lord let me
[1:38:50] tell you of the story of the donkey I
[1:38:52] wrote a donkey me and brother Jimmy have
[1:38:53] a story about donkey God bless you my
[1:38:56] pleasure brother that's nowhere now
[1:38:58] there was a donkey you know the donkey
[1:38:59] in the Bible who carried Jesus Christ on
[1:39:01] the Passover before he was crucified
[1:39:03] right so this donkey
[1:39:06] it is a story there's no donkeys don't
[1:39:08] speak so this donkey did what uh did
[1:39:11] what they did carry Jesus Christ
[1:39:12] fulfilling scriptures
[1:39:14] and after that he was standing under a
[1:39:16] tree very sad and sorrowful and another
[1:39:19] donkey was passing by saying my friend
[1:39:20] why are you why are you sad
[1:39:22] I said well
[1:39:24] remember what happened to me right I
[1:39:25] said yes you saw what the women you know
[1:39:27] when Jesus when I was carrying Jesus
[1:39:29] majestically and the women were laying
[1:39:31] their clothes for I mean for me to walk
[1:39:33] upon this same woman that passing by
[1:39:35] they don't even say hello to me they
[1:39:38] despised me they don't look at my face
[1:39:39] they pretend they don't even know me
[1:39:42] and the other donkey said no come on
[1:39:43] just get beside yourself let's go chew
[1:39:46] some grass he said it wasn't about you
[1:39:50] [Music]
[1:39:51] the woman didn't lay their clothes for
[1:39:52] you
[1:39:54] you just happened to carry Jesus
[1:39:58] they laid their clothes for Jesus Christ
[1:40:03] so come on let's go do our duty let's go
[1:40:05] get some grass
[1:40:09] so it's not about me it's not about you
[1:40:12] it's about the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:40:18] it means another by the preacher though
[1:40:21] it looks like it comes to the preacher
[1:40:22] because you are standing for the Lord
[1:40:24] Jesus Christ but it's good to the Lord
[1:40:25] Jesus Christ they are aiming in the
[1:40:27] world they are not eminent
[1:40:30] they are aiming the word of the Lord
[1:40:32] amen so let's put Christ at the center
[1:40:36] of everything that we do
[1:40:38] in the preaching in the receiving of the
[1:40:40] word in our homes
[1:40:42] in our jobs in our lives in going to bed
[1:40:46] and in waking up
[1:40:49] and that will change everything if you
[1:40:51] make the Lord Jesus Christ the center of
[1:40:52] everything even in your trials you see
[1:40:54] the Lord Jesus Christ in the trials
[1:40:57] and let me use Jesus for example when he
[1:40:59] was a Pilates Court
[1:41:01] police said yeah I have the power to
[1:41:02] release you he said you don't have no
[1:41:04] power for me if God
[1:41:06] God was a Christ in him
[1:41:09] if the purifier in me doesn't allow you
[1:41:11] to do this this was ordained to be done
[1:41:14] you don't have no power
[1:41:15] Jesus didn't accuse pilate he didn't was
[1:41:18] mad he didn't accuse the devil even he
[1:41:20] called Judas my friend
[1:41:27] to do it
[1:41:29] so the trust that comes our way
[1:41:31] our ordained of the Lord
[1:41:33] nothing will happen to a child of God if
[1:41:36] it did happen to you God ordin it for
[1:41:38] you to be to happen whether good or bad
[1:41:40] to bring something out of you
[1:41:43] regardless of what
[1:41:45] whatever happened and when you get that
[1:41:47] understanding the Divine understanding
[1:41:49] that God has ordained your life and he
[1:41:53] said I will never forsake you I'll be
[1:41:55] with you
[1:41:56] Even In You by the Holy Ghost baptism
[1:41:59] until the end of the world what world
[1:42:00] you might die before this Cosmos word
[1:42:03] get destroyed
[1:42:04] end of your world
[1:42:06] your world everybody is a world of his
[1:42:08] own of her own
[1:42:10] and a lot has programmed your life
[1:42:13] and when we get that understanding that
[1:42:15] whatever God puts you in
[1:42:17] he does it for a purpose whether
[1:42:20] Financial family he allow your children
[1:42:23] to go Wayward because he's made you like
[1:42:25] an Esther
[1:42:27] you've got the power to deliver
[1:42:30] you've got the power to save
[1:42:32] Esther wasn't just a queen
[1:42:34] wasn't just to marry the king and become
[1:42:36] popular and get all the goodies but she
[1:42:38] was supposed to be a queen the first
[1:42:40] lady and also a savior to Israel
[1:42:43] and you God has given the token
[1:42:45] if Esther who was a natural Queen was
[1:42:48] able to deliver Israel you are the
[1:42:50] supernatural Israel and the supernatural
[1:42:52] Queen you see Jesus Christ
[1:42:54] and if you see our position in the Lord
[1:42:57] you can do the greater things that that
[1:42:59] is written in the Bible
[1:43:01] God wants us to know who we are he
[1:43:04] doesn't always want to carry us
[1:43:06] we want us to just watch us our sons and
[1:43:08] others he's still in you just like Moses
[1:43:11] there was that merciful the Lord wasn't
[1:43:13] with them because you look at
[1:43:14] circumstances and the Lord in him came
[1:43:16] and said Moses why cry speak and go
[1:43:19] forward
[1:43:20] in your trials if you can worship if you
[1:43:23] can sing if you can pray if you can
[1:43:26] rejoice and give thanks to God the trust
[1:43:29] are no trials you quickly defeat the
[1:43:31] trials but if you let it weigh on you
[1:43:35] then the circles that weigh on you then
[1:43:36] begin to accuse the devil
[1:43:38] but he's an Executor he's a sheriff and
[1:43:41] he's doing his word so shall we raise up
[1:43:44] and offer word of Prayer

[1:49:42] living by Divine understanding
[1:49:45] we thank you for your servant Lord and
[1:49:49] just it's just a a message that was
[1:49:53] packed with vitamins today and spiritual
[1:49:56] vitamins
[1:49:57] so much we could take from it
[1:50:01] just even a little uh
[1:50:04] situation there brother Branham teaching
[1:50:06] on the seals
[1:50:08] and he gets a question from a sister
[1:50:11] about hair and attending her hair and
[1:50:14] those that was important to her but God
[1:50:18] at a time like that it might not have
[1:50:20] been appropriate because of what you
[1:50:23] were doing in revealing the the the
[1:50:26] Revelation that you were bringing to the
[1:50:28] people and father sometimes we miss you
[1:50:32] because we're doing things that are
[1:50:34] inappropriate father and we trust Lord
[1:50:36] that you would help us father to tune in
[1:50:38] and amen to be on the in on the same
[1:50:42] page is that that you're on and in the
[1:50:44] same channel that you're in God that we
[1:50:47] would always remember from from a Pulpit
[1:50:50] to the back door God when we're whatever
[1:50:54] we're doing when it's singing when it's
[1:50:56] uh praying when it's preaching Lord when
[1:51:01] it's just sitting in worship
[1:51:03] Hallelujah God that it's all about you
[1:51:07] you are the center of all of this and
[1:51:10] Lord we don't ever want to put the
[1:51:11] attention on ourselves we want to always
[1:51:13] bring the attention to you the song You
[1:51:16] Had to sing it earlier to God to be the
[1:51:18] glory for the great things that he has
[1:51:22] done lord it's not what we've done it's
[1:51:24] all that it's all what you have done in
[1:51:27] us and through us and father you will
[1:51:29] always deserve the glory so father we
[1:51:32] thank you for the word that we heard
[1:51:34] here today and God we don't want to be
[1:51:36] like that donkey sitting around moping
[1:51:39] and upset because of something that we
[1:51:42] felt didn't go our particular way it was
[1:51:44] never about us it was never about us

[1:52:57] needed to um

[1:53:03] that when um we had the guests Minister
[1:53:05] the other Wednesday night uh brother
[1:53:08] named I I just so appreciated the church
[1:53:12] showing up and and just being here to
[1:53:14] pull on the word of God uh it make the
[1:53:17] service
[1:53:18] a lot easier uh when the saints are in
[1:53:21] the house of God so I want to thank you
[1:53:22] all for that and the other thing I
[1:53:25] completely forgot to mention to you all
[1:53:27] uh that we were doing our uh back to
[1:53:31] school drive we didn't make it an
[1:53:34] announcements and I want you to forgive
[1:53:35] me for that but
[1:53:37] um what I what I did mention maybe a
[1:53:40] couple years ago the Lord has given us
[1:53:42] this opportunity to do the pantry and uh
[1:53:45] and with the back back to school drive
[1:53:47] we just try to capitalize on what we're
[1:53:49] already doing we don't necessarily try
[1:53:51] to do something different but the people
[1:53:53] are God is already bringing the people
[1:53:55] to us so amen we just capitalized on
[1:53:58] what's already there and had I told you
[1:54:00] all maybe we'd have a few more people
[1:54:01] that could volunteer and things like
[1:54:03] that but uh but what happened is that we
[1:54:05] had uh
[1:54:08] backpacks we had school supplies we had
[1:54:11] we had a lot of stuff so we just kind of
[1:54:13] got together and put it all together and
[1:54:15] uh and they gave away 58 book bags
[1:54:20] um to the kids going back to school and
[1:54:23] uh and I was just very very happy for
[1:54:26] that we thank the Lord
[1:54:28] amen for that so
[1:54:31] um we want to continue to do what we can
[1:54:33] to make a difference here in our
[1:54:35] community and again it's all about him
[1:54:38] amen it's all about him so God bless you
[1:54:42] amen Brothers will come to dismiss you
