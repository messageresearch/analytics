thank God for all the hell thing is raised up and here it's musicians thank you so much for your service today we appreciate you all very very much I want to just well just go right to the Word of God brother the song was mentioning we just we would hit a subject there on Friday night and and I was going to move away from I had something else that I wanted to speak but it just seemed like after we hit the subject a lot of other things just started to start again the kind of come out and and what I felt this morning that I would do is try to just bring a little bit of it back around for us for those that work here on Friday because I'd love for us all it'd be underneath the same anointing and I think it's very very important you never know when God I'll speak in man we were we were here and you know I just I took this dog on sin the word and you know after we finish church we was you know I think we you know I would preached and then brother Solomon came up and he testified and brother Jerry came up and he testified and listen they only came up and she testified and then sister Dixon went outside and just carried the atmosphere here we was freezing gone outside just by the old shirt and I was like praise God all right and you know he was just digging she put down a walk of just put everything down gotta lift my hands and let's begin the praise the Lord and just a wonderful atmosphere and walked on to the coward I know walking now is this I say Lord this is church and we were just we were just over a medal with joy with just the presence of the Lord and not that we necessarily try to recreate that but what I do want to do is again try to bring the entire church underneath the anointing of what we were under for Friday night and I just believe that the Lord will bless a man power you know our service is already blessed it is already blessed it so let's just read I got one scripture to read a man this is John 15 amen and 7 John 15 and 7 praise the Lord and man the Bible declares if ye abide in me and my words abide in you and this is just powerful to me there's first is the fighting in him and then his word has to be in you all right if he is bothering me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you glory to God a male I say man I say man I believe God's Word I believe God's Word I believe God's Word a man let's pray father we thank you for the word of the Lord and we thank you for the anointing that is in this place God I believe things are changing even as we're sitting here even right now we come to church but it's not just for us that we're coming to church for we we have people us fear of influence God that we're responsible for so Lord feed us that we might feed them and God encouraged us that we might encourage them strengthen us that we might strengthen them and lo we just pray to to take complete control over this portion of the service we also want to pray for brother Troy God as he's there a man and okeechobee just delivering a thought that you've placed in his heart and God use them for your glory use them for your honor bless the church that bless brother smiley and Mentalist thinks that a gala or bless them and father may know the Word of God just have preeminence and Lord many feel a mighty blessing they man from heaven of this morning many many leaves strengthened and encouraged by the Word of God and Father we just trust that you would get all the Lord on the honor may do the same here and whoever else the bride of crisis gathered this morning speak to her God Jesus name we pray a man a man god bless you can be seated so we were talking on the subject a man on Friday night of sin the word a man's sin the word and we're just trying to bring to everybody's a man attention just the power a man that that's that's in the word of y'all forgive me let me just take a step back here I forgot to read this card but special thanks it's easy to say thank you but it's hard to find a way to let you know what warmth there is behind those words today but somehow hope this message helps to show at least in part the very gratitude that's that's felt deep in the heart because your thoughtfulness and all the kindness that you show will always be remembered and appreciated so thank you this is from sister Erica and I to the church we want to thank you all again for a man your wonderful surprise that you gave us a member of the appreciation amen we just really appreciate your night got a little something that I wrote and then we'll put it on the board so if you want to take time to read it you certainly can Amen but I just we want to express on things sin the word is what we are talking about and and the Lord just really just kind of helped us look at a couple things and just trying to get us again to understand the importance of the word of God and and and and the power that is in the Word of God there's power in the word that is not found anywhere else praise God there's power there that's never found anywhere else there's encouragement there that you will never find anywhere else there is strength there that you will never find anywhere else and and and the other thing I will tell you there is a present all the word and in the word right there is an anointing that is that is in the Word of God that you're not gonna find anywhere else so it's very important for us to understand this right and so this is some let me just read a little something here from from the properties preaching from the endtime sign scene I'm a paragraph 83 it says if you're here and sick and you believe that God will grant you divine healing you just place that word a man you just place that word I'm the Lord that he loves all that diseases Lord I believe it watch what takes place amen amen I remember there was a sister who had a prayer cloth thing she was over in Germany and brother Branham you know just total people said when you get the prayer cloth just you know put it wherever it is you know you owe your body that up that where you might be feeling that illness and you know just pray to pray and prayer faith and then you know just you know go on from there and here this lady was in Germany and the prayer cloth got the hurried and soon as she got the prayer cloth a man she took it in our hand and said you know Lord I believe then when you got to get out of here got up and just start walking right she she had a confidence and what had had what had been done they they took you know they took garments and things like that from the body and Paul right and the disease is left to people yeah go over to God even recently after you know I I was I was at a point God had to kind of show me something I won't see here not that sort of rebuked me but he reminded me but I I wear a prayer cloth all the time and you know and and I was uh I was I was out one day playing golf and somehow the collar fell off and I lost it you know and I'm like I don't know what happened to that club I can't find it so I'm with a good while not not wearing one you know not where I said well I just lost that one is going in that's fine I had some actual but I just didn't think they put it on and and and I read a quote here recently where brother Brandon was telling the testimony about a lady that took a prayer cloth and gave it to a friend of hers and I know spa baby and the baby was sick and and somehow the prayer cloth up through the washing the clothes and everything it just began to shrivel up and just got the looks almost just just a string and and the mother was saying you know what it hasn't done anything yet it hasn't done anything yet and it's down to this little string so I might as well just take it off and not worry about it and so so that sort of woman that sense of saying I don't care if it's just a strain put the strain on the baby and watch God do what God said he gonna do hallelujah so got reminded me that closer now you might have lost the freshman book don't give it another one put it on your body and what God do what he say he gonna do hallelujah amen when they took these deep these prayer cloths from the body of oh every disease left charge of resetting oh if we sin with faith like that every disease will leave us too hallelujah every disease will leave us alright search I'm I'm on expectations but for this so he goes on to say and say I'm the Lord that healeth all thy diseases and it says Lord I believe it watch what takes place say Lord I believe it open up every channel and Here I am watch what takes place the same as it did to that little little dying girl the other day thousands of more around the world now what he's referring to I won't have time to read all this but there was a young lady that was coming to the meetings and she was 17 years old I think she had cancer and they thought she was gonna die instantly they called brother Branham and you know I was like brother Branham we're not gonna be able to make it to the service you know this girl is going dying right now so we're not we don't think we gonna make it we don't know what's gonna happen so you know program state just y'all just keep on coming just keep on coming got the girl to the service and he said just beginning to preach the Word of God and as he preached swear to God he said I've never even laid hands on her all I did was hold a word over preach the Word of God to her and as she took faith in the word the word produced the healing I felt that I felt that on Friday night thanks sister dicks with your drop drop drop it on Friday night because nobody even grateful but the Word of God was breached she's satting man to it you better watch what you say hey man - hallelujah you don't know how you might please God when you say amen to the word Eddie right said the right thing at the right time amen amen cause heaven to turn in her direction and whatever had a right wrong it she can't have because she said a man to the word your emails will reach heaven your emails will bring things that you didn't even think about to pass in your life your Amen will produce the exceedingly abundant above all you can ask a thing you're a man is gonna bring your money back oh come on somebody you're a man is gonna bring it back praise God he said the word after it it's coming back [Applause] however they gotta get in the water bring it back Jesus I believe this but he brother Bruce I've never prayed for the girl I never briefly I just reached the word and the word healed her the word healed her right so you know we go on a little further this distance sermon the end time science either says stood and seen them by a scene and in South Africa made one prayer over a bunch of people we did that on Friday night we made one prayer over a bunch of people and they estimated and took seven big truckloads my you haven't got a truck in Georgia like one of their mumbles six that eight wheels across here he says in the next morning with the mayor of the city sitting there come to the window and said brother Branham come down and look here come down this coming down the street there they come down the street with seven van loads of crutches and wheelchairs and everything the people never touched I'm one of them think about that the window window when the word went full up in there in South Africa and you know and I think one person was healed oh my god this this thing is contagious one person got healed and when they saw that one person get healed they took it upon themselves to believe God for their healing if I see one person go free and I'm taking it upon myself to believe God then the next person gonna go free come on somebody if I see one person get healed I'm gonna take it upon myself to believe that the next person can be healed amen brother men say you've never even touched one of these people but but my truckloads of crutches piled up in a in the truck and everybody accepted the healing what a service to be in what a service of being search week we can have it we can have it that way right here all it takes and the way we do this by taking God at His Word [Applause] oh let see this word gotta have something to latch on to this word got a left onto your face you don't see there we ain't seen nothing yet see nothing yet Church Oh hallelujah hey man I'm just under expectation for some things you know and and God knows look and he goes on to say this let me just keep going oh my mind just coming down the street there they come down the street seven van those crutches wheelchairs says and everything that people never touch one of them just brought the word told them to believe it and they did and and the people that was in these things that they before hear they was walking down the street with their hands over their heart in their own native language singing all things are possible only you believe he sent his word that's all you do is send the word and the church receives it you got the tow package on you yes right you got the tow package if you want if you want a tow fifth wheel or you know you want to go on vacation you want to take your fifth wheel you got to have a tow package three is gone you want to take the Winnebago you got to have a tow package Briggs got it man you got to have something back that in a towing we got it so we know as ford estimated see that we can carry this words we can tow it with us when we go and not only that even your son your daughter that might not be here right now a man we already know they got a tow package it was installed before the foundation of the world and all we got to do is send the word and one day they gonna feel the burden of the word hallelujah that's what we did on Friday night we sit the word after I've loved worse amen and I prophesied out of my own mouth now I just say the Lord told me to say it I said just feel like but I talked about the false prophet you know we're we're at a point where the Holy Spirit gonna anoint us and we're gonna say things without knowing what we see but you know what when you say it I got things are real here trying to get there but when you say it's not up to you bring it to pass it's up to God to bring it to pass it's not up to you oh let me keep going save his words that's all you do still inverted Church receiving he that he that's born of God receive receive God believes God do you believe him instead let's bow our heads now prayed to be sainted so he goes on just a couple other statements that I want to just make I won't read all these quotes but um brother and brother branham said the word went forth she believes they were to talk about the young lady 17 years old dying with cancer never was prayed for but she got up and walked right out the church heal just because she received the word if somebody today might be going through something in your body if you just accept the Word of God you can leave this place heal you can leave this place free you don't have to leave here the same way you came and you would accept the word amen I need you to understand something when you're accepting the word that's not just a singing the word is a person is the word is a physical being right can we read John 1 can we reach our one I want you to see that the word is is in the word is is something special Oh glory to God I this this is just it means something John wants a in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God so when you when you accept in the word watch this time and the word was god when you sin in the word you're actually sending God onto the scene of whatever it is that you needed to be on like out celebratory you are giving him permission to work on that situation huh yes I can't read all this but but brother branham said it was a man that was missing $400 somebody had robbed the man of $400 I'm he sold makan the guy got away from him with that Panama's money so so the Brotherhood down tribe but you know he didn't know really what to do it and I he's so they just began the prints they lost somehow someway I get it back you know I'll get it back you know I don't know how you know so so brother Ram him say they prayed over it you say all they did was pray over it he said now when they prayed over it the man that had the money did not have a tow package and what I mean by that is that this man did not have anything in him that would identify with the word hallelujah we're not when they talk to this man about going to church it's purposely going to church what to see the sisters in the church they knew that he had their own spirit so he didn't have the tow package brother branham said when I said the word a him I knew that it would lack show he said but the world watched him wherever he went the line was on his trail the line was keeping up with him the word new way he lived probably you might have tossed his brother and got out of town but the world will find you and the wife found them in Bowling Green and another brother recognize who this man wasn't oh brother NSA I found this family in here he's in Mississippi this is where it is so so brother branham said now you know when they heard that he knew that brother Evans was gonna get the money but he couldn't tell her Lance so he's saying said by the heavens we're gonna week on the Florida but before we go to flood we gonna go by Bowling Green we're gonna go through Bowling Green he was gonna go 30 miles out of the way so brother it was like okay all right we'll go through world agree and finally struck him say brother Graham I've been thick-headed he said didn't you say we going to Bowling Green go up the Rosary say yeah he said yeah he said you know that man that that got my money he live in Bowling Green say yeah so he said my brother Brandon if it was you know if it was you what would you do if you was going to Bowling Green would you don't get your money and brother brand himself come tell him everything he said now that he prints it up now I can express to him say if I don't say if it was me that was hundred dollars don't give my money right now and then with brother Evans with market demands Tony got his money that's why I say the word gonna bring your money back took your money and they paid you back God come finish were after them to get so many bad god I didn't concern about that too you know the same thing he said when the man stole his yeah and he went the bullish the man was on the way the bull agreed he say he say we stick the word after him he say the word caught that man he actually had something he had a tow package right and then what this made it work because when the word called him he began to think oh I'm wrong he used to be a Christian I said do this I need to take this car back this ain't right it was it was conviction to follow don't hit him that shows that the word caught up with him let me tell you if the work had kept up with him and bring conviction the word context might silent bring conviction the word can catch up solid break conviction the work he kicks your mama bring conviction the world of kept so daddy and bring conviction the word of catch her brothers and sisters and bring conviction all we gotta do is send the word and when I'm saved in the world I say take the promise that God gave you and when you praise God crusade god you saved Oh hallelujah I like that you said here the God that healeth all my diseases God you said it founds to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right you you told me that the promise was unto me unto my children hallelujah they managed many I mean minutes minutes a lot I gotta call those that are farmers minister Lord I've got a second god that's what you said we perceive God his promise this is what you said brother Brent see I come in the name of the Lord Jesus and I'm gonna say what God said in his word to me and when I say that then I'm gonna silly in the name of the Lord Jesus and I'm gonna send it off yes sir I'm expecting to get something back glory to God maybe I'll have a sip some money out for a package or something you expect to get it in the mail hallelujah I'm looking for it any day now my package and then I put a tracking tracking down until half come on somebody y'all remember that right we gotta track some of the yeah hey man y'all y'all forgot what y'all y'all ask God for God did forget the computer puts your scripts read and track your packets where is it alright Church I just I feel encouraged I don't expect an airy course and it wasn't so you gotta understand it's not brother Jack bringing this this is God sending this to the church God is concerned about every one of your meet brother Brandon but take your brother through a city over four hundred dollars take him through a city over four hundred dollars a lord my god amen amen and the definite evidence held up some y'all for a long time with excuses right while you can't do it we don't send the word the word will bring a conviction and somebody's gonna I don't even know why I'm doing this but I got it yeah I know why you doing this the word is making you do that Oh hallelujah all right let me let me go on after we eat this this this statement the profit made says how much greater is their reward and who had never seen who who have never seen yet believed he's a good guy it gives you the desire of your heart of course let's just believe him that's the death stroke to Satan when a man takes God and His Word brother that kills they don't kill Satan every time that's the hardest-hit that Satan can get when a man would take God at His Word yes sir because I say now what started with started since reason is the faith has no reason this is just another statement that I'm just bringing to you faith has no reason you don't reason at all you believe don't reason at all you believe glory to God when you're praying for and accept God's Word for healing don't reason with your feelings don't reason with nothing Nell's there's no reasoning to it God said so and that settles it they'd man all right all right all right after we uh shared this there was two things that kind of come and I just want to bring this the scripture that was shared just in the brothers chat Isaiah 59 in 1980 I was there 59 and 19 I say Lord this is just dill this disc phone is still running hey man so I wanted to share this with you all isaiah 59:2 19 and then this brother Jerry shared this Scripture a man and then from the boys share a quote that I want to share with you all I noted be a blessing to you whether just the thought just kind of kept going on knew it just confirmation as the brothers just sent it I said Lord the church the whole church need to be underneath this hey man the whole church need to be underneath this here in Isaiah 59 in verse 19 so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the Sun when the enemy shall come in like a blunt and some of y'all been flooded it been flood well this is the other part to that right there's a second part to this scripture anybody felt the flood of the enemy yes the attack of the enemy right well with the enemy come shall come in like a flood this is the other part of the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against the enemy the rounds say the standard is is the word being quickened to you person of Christ quickening you when the enemy comes in like a flood he will come with a message I'll show you somebody glory to God you feel it when you come into the president got it'll be a joke from heaven a quickening from heaven quick in the word back to you look at this sender the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a stand against him look at this in first Twitter sense and the Redeemer shall come to Zion and unto them that turn from transgression and Jacob says the Lord and I love this part as for me this is my covenant with them saith the Lord my spirit that is upon thee and my words which I have put in thy mouth what so you said things if you don't realize what you're saying but God say I put my words in your mouth let me just go work with just a little bit when God said let there be light you know what brother I'm saying it might have took billions of years before a light actually came forward but the thing about it when God released his word he had confidence and where he said was the past so you don't look at how long it takes you don't look at that you don't worry about how long it takes you just you just release it under there Norton and watch not bring it to pass hey man he said he says the bottle sets up my spirit that is a pump T in my words which I have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of that seat they got a tow package a man sent the Lord from henceforth and forevermore I've just seen a man of what God said hallelujah now this quote I want to read here brother Ross kept this and it was just a real blessing a man all this coming after Friday night service right so I just I said Lord this is I just want to stay here and just just just just rest a little bit coast look at this this statement our message the resurrection of Lazarus it says look deity says I'm a part of Charles Brennan because I was born from Charlie Brown my daddy I'm I'm a part of him I've got a forehead like him my hair was like him I'm a small man like him I'm in the nature like him amen because he's my dad this is resurrection of Lazarus he says if we become in spirit sons of God deity dwells in the man hallelujah if we become in spirit sons of God deity dwells in the man did I read did I read I didn't read John 1 did I did I didn't read the whole thing I think I just read one verse so you stay with this quote they're not coming back to John 1 because this is a that's important Oh Holly Lou all right stay with that let's stay with this quote and I'm going back to John 1 cuz I didn't read all of that all right it says this if we become in spirit sons of God hallelujah I don't give you the thing it's 50 and 51 - 0 7 - 9 a as an apple and the paragraph that I'm on this II - 37 I'm sorry about that but I think it's gonna be important that we all get this one it says if we become in spirit sons of God deity dwells in the man hallelujah then you talk about blind eyes being open it says they said nothing impossible to God that's what they think that's what they they still saying I'll live but God's sake talk about what they say let's talk about what God see God see nothing impossible with you if you believe not with God but two pcs in man yes sir it goes on it man I love that we need a nice jolt of this sometimes say the very God that stood back there on the mythical platform all the eternities enrolled a part of him and God dwells in man kind of man himself is man himself is deity man himself is deity hallelujah there you are it might choke do but study over that a little while see he is God was a man and man becomes a son of God not him not him in his sin himself but the Holy Spirit that's in him is God the Creator lives in the creation oh my how I think of that then staying with an unwavering faith and asks what you will it'll be done unto you there he is God's there he is I say hey man today deity is in the man look at this in John one I want to just go on and read this we started in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God so when we talk about stand in the word we talk about sending God on this thing that's that's what we're talking about hey man all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was me in him was life and the life was the light of men hallelujah hey man I was as I was reading this scripture I thought about the scripture that brother Stephen read this morning for prayer amen since in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shining in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not because I'm saying there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light I love this I love this a man if John was sent from God brother Branham was sent from God can I tell you something else you were also sent from God and what is your purpose to believe the word in this hour hallelujah to become the word for this hour a man church that is your purpose amen all of our jobs and our professions a man that's just something to take care of our natural needs here amen but we have a higher purpose than that glory to God believe the Word of God to become the Word of God for this day we become the light bearers of this age come on church look at this say the same came for a witness to bear witness of the like that all men through him I believe he was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that light that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came I just own it and its own received or not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood and I love this which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of God if anybody told you that your birth is a mistake they are lying how do you tell me about a will of God your birth was not a mistake I don't care how you got here hallelujah you might have a real smutty name associated with your birth but still God predestined it for you to be here hallelujah glory to God a man a man a man I like that look at this look at this says but as many as received him to them gave he power to become some even to them that believe it which were born out of the blood out of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of God I like I like that we read the script in that people begin to cry y'all better watch things we read that script and that baby we begin to cry it's not a mistake it's not coincidence it's not it's not you watch you just watch keep bringing the baby to church watch what happened hallelujah some God God God predestination everything look at this it says since I which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of God listen and the Word was made flesh this is what I'm trying to get you to see the word as a person yes the word is a being the word is God and when you send the word you are sending the person of God to take care of the situation God become your representative yes God becomes your ambassador that's representing you in the situation let me tell you something I'd rather have God represent me then a me lawyer in the lane when God shows up so curating exchange when Jesus is on the scene something is getting ready to change it praise God we need to rescind the word release God to do what God can do God you say God you promise and I'm sitting this in the name of Jesus watch it go out go out go out there and it's gonna attach to the tow package

of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth thank God for that I I need to just read this Amen hallelujah this is coming out a message Permian church age just this was just them my spirit forgive me interchange look at this I wonder I love this statement of the Prophet mix it says I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst I just wonder if we're sufficiently impressed whether the person of the words with Christ Jesus that is in our midst hallelujah I'm telling you he's here when sister Dixon said that he was here that night she was right in the words he is here she was desire I wish I could have been in the meetings I wish I could have been back there when you know when the problem was doing to say no we need him here right now we need a gift like that in the land right now and of course God spoke back he is here who is he he is the water that is in our mix and we have to be sufficiently impressed with the water that is here yes the word to get the job done yes man if we allow it to get the job done look at this I wonder if we're sufficiently impressed with the word and I missed let me give you a up here how do we pray we pray in Jesus name don't we every press are you stealing it you still Ian every prayer is in his name or there isn't any answer so don't come up with the don't don't use the Q prayers we we go to the denominational churches they use the Q prayers and the name of the Father in the name of the son in the name of the Holy Ghost or in the name of your son what is his name listen you can't sign no check with no title [Music] hallelujah brother they want to see a name and you go quit son if you want to that check will not pick the cash you put father if you want to the check but not well whose father everybody got follows a man we want to know who what is his name please come glory glory glory amen of you won't you check the cash if you want your prayer to be answered you must use the name of the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah so seal your prayer in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ don't get cute with it call his name demons tremble when you call this name sleepness please when you call this name Halloween up Oh glory to come hey man I believe that brother Brandon went to pray for that little boy and you know any and it's Justin really no other say so I say in between his condition and he has a patient I place the blood of the Lord Jesus now how did it get in there how did the blood of Jesus get in between little sickness innovation Baha prayer faith it was inserted hallelujah and we put the blood of Jesus in front of your sickness then the secret tail attack you know more so whenever your condition is today we place the blood of Jesus in between you as a patient your condition honey glory to God we expected sickness to even try it today Laura we sit on the word after the sickness all right hey mani Kaul say this this say however say we pray in Jesus name don't we every prayer is in his name for it there isn't any essence yet in John in 1st John 5:14 we're told this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us and if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him now we ask what is the will of God there is only one way to know his will and that is father word of God lamentations 337 who was he that that saith and it cometh to pass when the Lord commands it not there it is in it's in the word I mean if it isn't in the word you can't have it if it isn't in the word you can't have it so so we can't ask unless it's in the word amen and see that that's why if you if you go the way you've got no is gonna work because you're able to take a promise and apply it before you even pray if you put that promise in front of it and then sealing in the name of Jesus why don't you come to pass watch it come to pass oh man you said just apply all my needs that's what you said Lord you say you supply all my needs this is a meat I need a house [Music] I need a place to stay a man Gloria this is what I need God you said just supply all of my needs hey man accordin I love that part too according to his riches in glory you understand that he did not say according to Fifth Third Bank he did not say a quarter to Wells Fargo whatever your bank is he did not say a quarter to the credit union limited resources they don't have so much come on somebody where they making money it's about getting you into a loan when your so much interest they make your money off your interest now they can give that to other people hallelujah remember when God gives it to you he's not expecting you to give it back this is not a loan this is a blessing [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] blessings glory to God listen listen he says this it says so we can't ask unless it's in the world we can't petition or ask Allah says in its name there it is again Jesus to me is the word will Jesus the name is the word will you can't separate God the word when you sit in the word you are sending Gotham the scene that mean you ain't fighting it it's not up to you to bring the past regardless what you say it's what you say praise God I expect the next time I go to the doctor that everything come out knowing [Applause] we want to send the word send the word church and healing does not have an age limit will you get this oh you can't not ain't what God says I'm the daughter he loves all your diseases glory to God I mean it you know unfortunate thing is what we eat that's doing this to us and we can't you know stop eating hey man you gotta have something you got you got to take care your body be certain you watch what you eat but but but you can't just stop eating right okay they even find this stuff in the water right I mean so you just that's why you pray over everything you get see your friend stop in spring over there right but but the thing is we gotta trust God's a metaphor for the healing of our bodies for whatever it is that God has promised put that promise before God and watch him bring it to pass sealing in the name of Jesus and rocks and breaking the path don't be afraid to sit off your man don't be afraid and sitting on a man this thing in that minute it's just gonna come back with with results oh yeah I believe it I believe this sermon gonna produce results [Music] [Applause] to the Word of God it's gonna produce results amen hallelujah I mean you know Oh God unlike my brother Jerry sometimes you'll give something to somebody and you just I remember my dad had told me a long time if you if you can't if you can't give it and not expect it back don't give it I remember my dad tell me that so I learned that sometimes that's where you give just give and don't expect the back now if you told me that you wouldn't give it back I'm expecting you but I'm leaving the situation like if they throw I'm gonna go on and I've watched God still blessed even everything regardless of somebody not not holding up the end of the bargain but when I ran into this coach I said no God concerned about that so not all I can do it I'm not calling you up I'm not I know I'm not calling you remember you of not hanging to another day I ain't doing lemon imma let God sing you a dream in your life and I'm just gonna bring me back to your memory do you remember this even if you have to make payments I know I seen your spirit and the word is what did it can I first read this oh look at this man he said this you can't separate the separate God and the word they're one and then he goes on saying now then this word he has left behind on the printed page is part of him when you accept it by faith into a spirit filled life he said that his word was life amen Romans he said John 6:63 be but that exactly what he is John 14:6 I am the way the truth and the life Romans 8:9 beat any man have not the Spirit of Christ he is none of his there it is he is spirit and he is life that is exactly what the word is the word is spirit and the word it's like that it's exactly what Jesus is oh I like that he is the word so when I'm similar word I'm sitting Jesus and Jesus is God Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the new man Jesus is God so when I'm sitting where I'm releasing Jesus I'm releasing God to do something about this let's look at this he says Jesus is Jesus he is the word so in a spirit born spirit filled man in fancy it's one thing to send the word but it's another to send it to mix it with something and we're not spirit born spirit filled man in faith takes that word into his heart not a quote didn't stop there the quote did not stop and you just put them in your heart hey there's a comma there praise the Lord so what's it I'm you can sit here save me all day long but after you save man there must be some that goes along with this say when the spirit born spirit filled man and thing takes that word into his heart and upon his lips Wow when you let it come out of your mouth anointed by God it's the same as if God Himself spoke now have you ever seen God speaking that didn't come to pass if it did if it came to pass for him it will come to pass for you I'm gonna tell you another thing your doubt can't even stop it brother Branham say unbelief does not stop God I don't believe only hinders the unbeliever but it don't stop God amen gotta go right over the top of your down and break it the pastor amen I said that some somewhere somebody got offended by me saying that I had to give a few quotes on it God will go over here to town did he go over Abraham's doubt did not Abraham show some doubt waiting waiting when he sold his wife I mean game his wife that told her to that's that's my sister lied to the tutor to the leader that a Hitler like I believe his name was lied to that that's my sister and God went over the man's doubt unbelief and told man give him back his wife his wife the man told me his sister yeah that's what he said but that's his wife said I want to give him back say give him back because that man is my prophet the lighteth prophet this man can't be a prophet this man's a liar prophet then you move to that and that's what see if your actions don't change what God thinks about your actions didn't change God's thoughts this is my problem not only do it I want you to give him back his wife I want you to have him pray for you seriously you won't you won't heal it you want your family Thanks straight not have it this man free food and none of it I'm not gonna mention how Abraham felt having to pray for you knowing that you just doubted God I just lied to this man that all of this is what I feel happened they met after this occasion because we don't see report it reporter anymore inscription after this occasion Abraham never live like that again and something's got to take you through to take their actions Oh hallelujah I'm finished read this pull look at this church when a spirit born spirit filled man and faith takes that word into his heart and places upon his lips while that is the same as deity speaking every mountain has to go and I like this Satan cannot stand before that man while you just delivered another destro to him by taking God at His Word let me go on a little further in the church way back there in the third age have only held on to the revelation of the Living Word in their myths if we can only hold on to that revelation the power of God would not have faded as it did in those dark ages and right today when the church returns to the word of the faith we can say without a doubt that the glory of God and the for acts of God will be in her midst again so I'm looking for the glory of God I'm looking for the wonderful acts of God that come forth from us sinning the word I'm on the expectation can I just just give you another scripture then we'll come with a closing quote here in a second take me to John for this is I used on Friday night where the Lord the Lord Jesus was approached by the Centurion and the sentirse you know I'm not worried that you've come under my roof but if you would just speak the word only my servant will be made home Jesus never went and prayed for the man Jesus never even said any more about the man's healing he just told her the Saturnian go find it the way you believed it right and it was the Centurions faith that brought it brought about the result can I tell you something's gonna be your faith that's gonna bring him back about bring about the result hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that court I just read you now and I got to be so careful because I did tell you to use the name of the Lord Jesus and I and I we want to seal it like that but your faith gonna get to a point where you don't just be able to take a not from God oh I hope y'all catch this man you got to be able to take it back from God because what brother Graham just say if say how do you ask you acts according to his will if you know it's in the will you can just ask and receive your word said Lord hallelujah amen I mean there's some things you don't have to spend a man 40 days praying about God you say it and if God said it you just put it out there like that and let God take care of a man Church glory to God hallelujah some things that they were just got to give up go fight with them no you know that's mine just give it up we had another quote out that the enforcer is here and you know the boss of us he makes the devil I'm sitting the enforcer the imposter will make that they will give back your children the enforcer will make the devil get back your money being pushed to a make them that will get back your help praise God it force every claim that you would put out there hallelujah hallelujah just let's release God and let him go to work Church all right there's just this story Amen I talked about that that Centurion how you saved if you just speak the word only my serve you meant well and Jesus never went to his house to you there's never went to pray for lay hands on a man that man was made well by the word by the word I said Lord where's another little example in Scripture that we can use where where the word itself brought healing the word did it not not not anything else and if the word can do it and skip to the work and still do it today John for let's pick this up Jonah for verse 46 and and imma take some when you send the word you are releasing Jesus to do something about you're releasing God to do something about it now now now for my understanding any time Jesus showed up in in a situation it was changed if Jesus is here this thing will change when we marry mother say lord if you had been here my brother would not have died I don't care how close he was to death if Jesus would have been there ain't no way Lazarus for the time that's the type of faked ahead but then he took another level and then no I'm not watching here but if you believe even right now I know you did full day's go but if you believe right now we'll bring them out of the green church I don't care how long has been the tubing wait no you promise to be fulfilled if you'll believe right now that thing will change somebody might have Tony ain't no way to think I happen don't accept what they say except what God's Word is telling you no reasoning there's somebody say your credit your credit no no no that's not this is not credit this is blessings we're not talking about credit we talk about I'm a faithful type here I got all kind of promises what is that he will open up the windows are heavier that's not too bad windows of heaven work me out blessings well I have room not enough to receive I'm not talking about credit that's how you were operating I understand I'll talk about blessings and then they said if somebody slips up from he would rebuke the Devourer for my seat that's what he said all right all right so church dogs no doubt don't mix no doubt with this at all no go out and try to explain this you know that I heard that I heard them copes and I heard some scriptures but don't you use that actually just negated everything you put do you put it you put a bug behind anything you just negated everything what would you say that's all I'm just I just believe God I believe God sister taffy I just believe it run around sir that's what she doin some y'all glory to God we need we need some of them hey man hello and I receive it to God you sent this for me hallelujah here John John 446 and I said when Jesus gets involved you know things by the change watch this so Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee and I love this came again in Turkey mughelli and you know y'all remember the first time he came something happened this water was changed took to wine he bypassed processes oh come on church if he can do it the first time he can do it again so Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee where he made the water wine and there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum okay now he's in Galilee but this man's man's son is sick at Capernaum now when he heard that Jesus was come out of Judea into Galilee he went unto Him and besought him that he would come down and heal his son for he was at the point of death this man knew if I could get my problem into the into the presence of Jesus this think I'm being a problem no more hallelujah amen so so he goes on and says then said Jesus unto him except ye see signs and wonders ye will not well I'm sorry I skipped verse 47 dinner dinner no no okay alright didn't say I accept you see signs and wonders you will not leave now what this is is just throw the man's faith off hallelujah is to throw its faith off just a little bit except you see signs and wonders you need unbelief now look and say the note man said to him sir come down and my child died before my child died I need you to come down I'm not just looking for a sign of the wonder I'm here for my child how the same for me this for my child hallelujah well already got to jesus said of him go thy way thy son liveth you never came to this house never prayed for them never lay hands on them but go thy way thy son living it and this is the thing and the man believed what if you just believe this works something happen to you and the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken up to

teaser if God send me some even if it's just a little something lasts more than what anybody else can ever do to me application to Sydney Sun God's on the obligation to take him to it can I go look
