to time let's let's go to Psalms 63 all rightall blessed be the name of the Lord Psalm 63 starting at verse one oh God thou my God early will I seek thee my soul thirst is for thee my flesh alone is for thee in a dry and a thirsty land where no water is to see thy power and thy Glory so as I have seen the in the sanctuary because thy loving kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee thus thus will I bless thee while I live I will lift up my hands unto thy name my soul shall be satisfied satisfied as with Mar and fatness and my mouth shall praise thee with joy for lips okay let's look at another place in Psalm Psalm 42 Psalm 42 where we read verse 6 and 8 so oh my my God my soul is cast down Within Me wherefore will I remember thee from the land of Jour and for the hill of the hernas and from the hill of Misa deep call is unto the Deep the noise of thy water fou all th ways and our bills are gone over me amen yet my yet the Lord will command his loving kindness in the daytime and in the night his song shall be with me and my prayers unto the Lord Lord of my life let's just pray heavenly father I just ask you to come and take over the vessel Lord they come to hear from the Living God and I know you will not disappoint Lord you always have some know or want something for you you got something for them Lord God and I just pray you move me out of the way that you can speak Lord God and we believeing that in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated I want to speak on the deep calling into the deep Amen brother said remember not long ago before you receive the Holy Ghost your heart was burning for something yeah what was it it was the Deep amen you come to church you join church but you never been born again and your heart called for it what was is the Deep calling to the Deep amen and sure is there a deep calling there's a deep to respon that's right amen you don't have to write down but Psalm 19 19 174 say I long for thy salvation oh God my heart my thy law is my delight amen uh in another place in Psalm 119 it said I open my mouth and I paint it for I loan it for thy Commandments all right amen the Deep calling is a loing in your soul for something in your soul that's calling for more God all right amen and that's when any ever born again believer and even before you get the Holy Ghost that's was calling for it amen that's right amen hallelujah for the me message Divine love brother now in the day that we are living in in all days we are born to be Sons and Daughters of God we are offering God and being offering of God there's something about us to believe God there's something in you that call out for something right amen it's a today people try to satisfy that loan in your heart many times we try satisfied with education with with denomination with fanaticism but we we try to satisfy with one thing or another but it will never take the place until Divine love is in your heart is projected to almighty God Amen see that's the that's the appetite of your soul that matters amen right amen amen so the soul got appetite well sure I mean Isaiah 298 said it shall even be as when a Hungry Man dreams and behold he eats but awaits and his soul is empty and and and when a thirsty man dreams and behold he drink but he awakes and behold he faint his soul has appetite so shall the multitude of the nation be that fight against Z but the soul has an appetite right yes yeah everybody Soul got an appetite for something but the real real predestinated seed of God your soul got an appetite for God Amen you want you want more God don't matter where you standing there's still more God for you that's right amen hallelujah said than already be I'm an old man a minister and I preached around the world got many got millions of friends he said but I know I got to stand with you y get away from the things of the world if there is something in you that still want to act that way if you if you're doing the things of the world remember you're none of God you're just a Churchman remember until that that call that deep calls to the Deep see yeah like before there was a pin on a fish back there has be water for him

the righteous they shall be filled and you see that find that in Matthew 5 amen amen blessed are they the hungry and thirst as the righteousness shall be filled let's go to Psalm 107 we'll start at verse five so hungry and thirst of their soul fainted in them then then they Cried unto the Lord in their trouble and he he delivered them from out of their distress and he he led them forth by Night by by the I'm sorry he led them forth by the right way that they might go to a city of habitation yeah oh that men would praise God would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful Works to the children of men for he satisfied the lon and soul and he filled the hungry soul with good thing amen he satisfied the L and soul and he fills the H and soul with good things amen yes amen when and expect when there's a hunger in a human heart for something there's bound to be something created in that hunger there that's right amen and when the Deep calls it deep there's bound to be a deep to respond somewhere praise God and if there's a deep calling for more God for healing that's bound to be a fountain open amen amen and the power of God somewhere to respond do you believe that amen

back to verse 11 if if a s will ask bread or any of you that is a father will he give him a a a stone if he ask a fish will he offer him a fish give him a serpent if he asked an egg will he offer him a scorpion if you being evil no how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the Holy Ghost to them that ask him amen how much more shall he give it to amen so don't he has a calling don't try to Hursh that Holy calling in your heart for just some religious be a church member so I've been around the message fors 19 years I going to say hundreds nobody been around that long but I've been that's a f one guy would telling me some say he bringing out that's not the word that well me I've been around the message years well get in it ble the word don't just stay around it yes amen he God ain't give you no credit how long you've been around it right it's the it's Christ in you the hope of glory not Christ around you Amen in you is the hope of glory amen amen so it don't matter how long you've been around look at many many people have been around and even preach and they back in the world and got got websites against it now that's right that's right they never got the Holy Ghost cu the spirit of truth will lead you to all truth it won't lead you no arror it won't lead you back to the Holly syst all right amenah but they got religion and they got intellectual knowledge of it but it never come here well they said they were deceived while they was in the message well I agree they were deceived before they come here they to see why they was there and and they still to see all right because they got a revelation to be living out [Music] of Amen so as you're hungry for something Bo God then God will give you what you're hungry for there's something in you pulling you amen that's the purpose of God in your life that he might fulfill that but you got to be desperate to get it you got to be persevere amen like old buddy Robins you heard the story brother tell everybody he was a method preacher quite a character he read so the story about one time he said I took a young preacher with me to preach of me and said did I get mad he out preached [Laughter] me but he he had a temple with his problem was he out there plying on M I don't know you ever plied one I had when I was growing up in the country boy we pl those things are stubborn sometime they don't want to act right they want to walk on on the stuff you applying and stuffff and he just got mad at and he just went out and just bit him on the eye and said there with move mu ha got his mouth and he said here some preacher with mu so he looked at Old mu said I'm sorry will you forgive me so the MU looked at me say no cuz you don't get no more religion you got now you'll do it to me again amen so you got down the F so Lord if you don't fill me with the Holy Ghost you going to find a power of bones when you come back he got it in when he got desperate about it when he got had to have it he wasn't just say well I like to have it that you want to have it give it to is all right all right nothing God God in t for you the ho ghost seek till your figh amen amen see God Jeremiah said when you seek me with all all your heart then I'll be found you amen amen you don't just seek him a little you seeking with all your heart and he'll be found but we like everything fast now you know this fast full time it wakes over 10 minutes too long I want to inant this well God Ain instant God want to show you believe him and you receive his word amen Lord amen your St is surfing for more God but are you willing willing to pay the price for it amen we won't go through the but in Mark 10 there was a Rich Young Ruler come running to Jesus and said good Master what may I do that I may have eternal life now he he wanted eternal life he he come to the right sord he approached right he did all that right yes sir amen but he said what what can I give that I might have eternal life and Jesus told him give big an offer and he would did it amen but he said knew that and knowing all thing he knew that he loved his money his prop his position yes more than even eternal life oh don't let nothing be before eternal life amen see well go he said keep all the Commandments now shy he lived a good life he he named off the Commandment said don't commit adultery be honor your father and mother those it went down the line yes sir he said I've done that s for you but what lack is I he know he kept all the all the Commandment but he's still lacking eternal life and Jesus said go sell all that you have and give to the poor and you have Treasures in Heaven yes but his treasures on Earth was so important he gave up that treasure to him and said yeah well I maybe I'll make it like this where he made it but the wrong place amen because he held on to the natural thing me more to him than eternal life yeah so how can God show you reality till you fully surrender yourself to him exactly right Amen brother said one place when you fully surrender the Holy Ghost will come in but he can't come in until you fully surrender that's right so anything that stand in your ways you don't have it fully surrender and you get it yeah for forsaken all he said I would forsake anything in the world I don't care what it is to see Jesus Christ manifest himself especially when it manifest in my life that I know I passed from death into life I know that he is the Messiah I know by taking him at his word that he saved me from a life of sin I know that the Holy Ghost dwells in me I see signs everywhere pointing to it I know he's the same yesterday today and Fa forsaking all I will forsake anything when you amen Lord sure you will as a Believer cuz only the Holy Spirit can keep you clean from the things of the world Amen yeah oh people get live Sanctified life but they keep falling and getting up that's right cuz they're trying to do it right I was in a village not long ago they knew we because the first one win in that Village preach the gospel CH amen so I talking to one the backslid they I know I don't know why I call him because he said Brother Willie I know the mess is right but I can't live it I said well need can I he got real quiet I said if we can live it we wouldn't need the Holy Ghost we would need Christ to live it he got be him living the problem is you're trying to live it instead of surrender let him live it let go and let Christ have his way let it be him yeah he can live it that's right he can't do nothing else but live it because he is the life amen amen but people try and they fall and they try and they fall but they got to go all the way if they want to make it yeah yes remember talk about the do said it's a different bir he doesn't have no G he can't eat like the crow you know the crow is a type of hypocrite he can come to church and say amen and go to the ballroom say amen he can eat both kind of stuff he got lots of go but the dog can't eat that that stuff that wrong stuff it was it would kill it but he not going he not going to eat it anyway cuz he got no desire for it and a dog don't have to take a bath and water there's something on the inside that keeps him clean and that's the Holy Ghost Inside is Crystal that keep him clean you know you don't have to take a bath you got something inside they keep him clean From the Inside Out amen that's that that's that's the life that's end it up amen thank you sir amen amen it's something in that keeps them clean and when you got the Holy Ghost nobody have to watch your you don't do this you don't do that that's something in you tells you what's wrong is it so it's just a book of rules it is if you don't have the Holy Ghost it's just a law and you're Tau of being on the law you go back to the world but when you get the Holy Ghost the world is dead in Midnight amen amen we got to be willing to forsake us amen let's let's go to Ephesians Ephesians 5 Ephesians 5:25 we started well there probably let's see 525 we'll start at 522 so why submit yourself unto your own husband as unto the Lord for husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is head of the church and he is a savior of the body wherefore the church is subject to Christ so let the wife be to their own husband in everything husband love your wife even as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with a washing of the water of the word that he might presented to him as himself a glorious Church Without not without without spot a ranker or any such thing but that it might beo should be holy and without blemish yes amen amen so that well that's the kind of Church Christ come for amen that glorious Church Without spot a ranker anything else amen and that's a desire the heart of believer that's what they want to be they want to be pleasing to God they want to be more like him no matter how close they get to God they still want to be more like God Amen let's go to Second Corinthians second Corinthians uh 5 verse 13 it write like read like this for whether we are beside ourself it is of god or whether we be be so is for your cause for the love of Christ constrained because we we just judged that if one died for all then was all dead we know he was all dead and sin and trespass that he died for all that they which live should not hisence for live under the but under him which died for them and rose again amen see that's why we should live under him that died for and rose again amen and that's that's that it constrained us right amen something El caus her to want to do us right right to want to please God Amen the want to be like God it's something to constrain us to stay away from the things of the world and to be clean for the things of the world if we do something wrong make it right right away amen oh Sayan got a trap but if you fall you got a fountain open a cleansing Fountain amen he's a Creator now think of how able he is to repare us the body to live you right that's what things that ought to be one of the last M brother PRI was December 65 now than to prepare us a body to live in like his own glorious body is there a hunger for another body are you get tiau of This Old House oh man I'm ready to get a new house amen amen a lot of people say I don't do that I don't got a new house but you better take care of this one while you got till you get the new one amen there's something in US calling to live and there's something in us that call out to do right and God will call somebody on the platform to P that will preach absolutely the truth why it show it shows you amen there is then if you're a real child of God you begin to cry God take away from me circumcise me from this take these things away from me why it's a need for your heavenly home that you're going to where he's going to prepare for you amen you got to be a real word Bride for Christ amen amen see the Holy Ghost should be more important to us than anything else in this world no matter what you got in this world it can't compare to eternal life amen and our home this world is a shadow to what our home going to be on the other side exactly right so they got the Manion they won't compare be a shag compared to up there so all youall look at my y'all look at my eyes that got Gates and pearl streaks of transparent gold yes sir we see go but we never see no transparent go amen amen what a home we prepared for we can hear about it but we really don't have the feel revelation of it till we get there Hallelujah listen to the Future home brother describe it but we want we when we get there it'll be real to us it's real to us now but it be a whole lot more real when we get there amen
