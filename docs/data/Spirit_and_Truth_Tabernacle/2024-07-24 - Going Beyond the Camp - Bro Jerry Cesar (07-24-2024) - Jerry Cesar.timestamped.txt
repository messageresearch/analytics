[27:21] in the day you see that that was a
[27:23] purpose of Us coming to services like
[27:27] this
[27:29] we had a desire in our heart that if the
[27:31] Lord Jesus was to call us home that we
[27:34] wanted to make it to heaven and you
[27:36] understand that if you picked up the
[27:38] paper every day and you looked inside

[34:45] evening to Hebrews chapter 13 and
[34:49] starting at the 10th
[34:52] verse thought I'd be able to bring my
[34:54] laptop here but just a little take a
[34:57] little bit too much
[35:01] space you know uh I
[35:04] really really enjoy and and really look
[35:07] forward to ministering to the young
[35:10] people amen you know sometimes you
[35:12] forget that you were a young
[35:14] person um and I remember when I was I'm
[35:17] still a young person
[35:20] but I remember when I was younger right
[35:23] and uh you know those those years they
[35:25] go by really fast right and the blink of
[35:28] an eye that's exactly right so I trust
[35:31] this evening the young people will be
[35:33] very
[35:34] attentive to what the Lord has to say
[35:36] Amen praise the Lord and so we want to
[35:39] read the third 13th chapter of Hebrews
[35:43] starting at the 10th verse and we'll go
[35:45] to the 14th verse say Amen when you're
[35:48] there
[35:49] amen it reads we have an
[35:53] altar whereof they have no right to eat
[35:56] which serves the
[35:58] Tabernacle for the bodies of those
[36:01] beasts whose blood is brought into the
[36:03] sanctuary by the high priest for sin are
[36:07] burned without the camp wherefore Jesus
[36:11] also that he might sanctify the people
[36:14] with his own blood suffered without the
[36:16] gate let us go forth therefore unto him
[36:21] and I like that everything that God does
[36:24] is leading us forward not backwards
[36:26] that's right that's right you see let us
[36:29] go forth therefore unto him without the
[36:32] camp bearing his reproach for here we
[36:37] have no continuing City but we seek one
[36:40] to come right praise the Lord you all
[36:42] may have your seats
[36:44] God praise
[36:47] God may the Lord add a blessing to his
[36:49] reading today amen also want to take
[36:52] another scripture in Jude 1 verse one it
[36:55] says Jude the servant of Jesus Christ
[36:58] and the brother of James to them that
[37:01] are Sanctified by God the father and
[37:04] preserved in Jesus Christ and
[37:07] called now the scripture we just read in
[37:11] Hebrews just to paint a
[37:13] background we have an altar whereof they
[37:16] have no right to eat which serve the
[37:19] Tabernacle want you all to know when the
[37:21] Old Testament and the levitical law the
[37:25] priesthood offered before the Lord
[37:28] yeah and they had a offering and they
[37:31] also had a sin offering watch the thief
[37:35] would come he would have watched and
[37:38] would not have suffered his housest to
[37:40] be broken up you see too many times
[37:43] Saints we wait for the enemy to come and
[37:45] take something in order for us to seek
[37:48] the Lord earnestly wow wow we wait for
[37:51] our joy to dry out we wait for sickness
[37:54] to enter into our bodies we wait for the
[37:56] enemy to present a cause and for the
[37:59] young people you wait until your
[38:00] innocence is taken away you see but I
[38:04] say to you this evening don't wait until
[38:06] the thief comes to watch watch anyhow
[38:10] yes and young people look at your
[38:12] neighbor and say
[38:14] watch you see because if the if if if
[38:18] the good man of that hour would have
[38:21] watched he would have not have suffered
[38:23] his house to be broken up right
[38:26] amen and
[38:29] want to tell you young people there is
[38:31] Victory and abstinence yes and that is
[38:35] to abstain from the very appearance of
[38:38] evil am Joseph defeated future complexes
[38:41] by abstaining from the very appearance
[38:44] of evil amen keeping himself and running
[38:47] away from Evil verse 44 goes on to say
[38:51] therefore be ye also ready for in such
[38:54] hour as ye think not the son of man
[38:58] cometh be ready and I believe we're
[39:00] living in a Time Saints where we can
[39:04] expect for the son of man to come any
[39:07] moment so be ready to be on defense and
[39:10] be ready to be on offense praise the
[39:13] Lord and you know the interesting thing
[39:15] about being an offense in sports is that
[39:19] no matter how many baskets you score how
[39:22] many goals you score how many touchdowns
[39:25] you land there's a time where that clock
[39:28] hits zero yes you see and you have a
[39:31] final
[39:32] score but when you're in the offense
[39:34] with God the clock never
[39:37] stops the clock never started to begin
[39:40] with so you see you you just keep going
[39:42] Beyond this and beyond that from Victory
[39:46] to Victory from healing to Healing from
[39:49] Deliverance to Deliverance whatever the
[39:52] need is God's clock never stops praise
[39:55] God so wherever you are you can go
[39:57] beyond the camp amen praise the Lord
[40:01] amen scripture says formal things has
[40:04] passed away old things have passed away
[40:08] we heard it on Wednesday and I believe
[40:10] that there'll be a time where when we
[40:12] when it really settles in we'll realize
[40:15] the trials we've been faced with were
[40:18] too small to be worthy of our time right
[40:22] it won't necess it won't it won't even
[40:24] be a fault because you'll understand
[40:26] that greater is he that is in you than
[40:29] he that is in the
[40:32] world Paul says for I reckon that the
[40:35] sufferings of this present time are not
[40:37] worthy to be compared with the glory
[40:40] which shall be revealed in Us Praise the
[40:45] Lord Matthew 24:
[40:53] 45 says who then is a faithful and wise
[40:56] servant
[40:57] whom his Lord hath made ruler over his
[41:00] house to give them meat and due season
[41:03] blessed is that servant whom his Lord
[41:06] when he cometh shall find doing so
[41:09] verily I say unto you that he shall make
[41:11] him ruler over all his Goods praise God
[41:16] the prophet of God says here in the
[41:17] message only believe now if we are
[41:21] acquainted with the
[41:23] supernatural would just take a man where
[41:26] that man in his senses is limited to his
[41:30] senses but a man in his spirit is
[41:34] unlimited amen and I just want to point
[41:37] out how many of us enjoy our senses how
[41:41] many of us enjoy waking up this morning
[41:44] and being able to feel touch smell hear
[41:47] and see those are senses we enjoy right
[41:51] but God has given has has prophet of God
[41:54] has tell us here this evening that in
[41:57] man in his spirit is
[42:00] unlimited it goes on to say the tree of
[42:02] knowledge can only climb so far and it
[42:05] breaks back but the Tree of Life goes on
[42:08] forever and how that science has taken
[42:11] man farther with his five senses than we
[42:14] have with his soul well we've got on tap
[42:17] resources where all things are possible
[42:21] talk about split atoms and the waves we
[42:24] have onta resources praise God yes
[42:29] praise God I want to turn
[42:31] to Genesis chapter
[42:34] 21 verse
[42:36] 14 and as we get there
[42:42] Saints the untapped
[42:44] resources you know I like to think
[42:46] sometimes when maybe we're doing a
[42:49] spring
[42:50] cleaning and as you're getting
[42:52] everything clean around the house you
[42:54] come across some treasured item that you
[42:57] haven't seen in years you realize oh
[43:00] where have this been but it's because
[43:03] you put it to you put it
[43:05] aside and there's some things if it's a
[43:09] treasure to you you can't put them aside
[43:11] and I encourage you young people don't
[43:13] ever put this word aside amen this word
[43:16] must be your treasure amen and to whom
[43:19] you obey to whom your heart is for you
[43:22] that's where your treasure is right so
[43:25] let your heart be towards this world
[43:27] word prise
[43:29] God now in Genesis
[43:33] 21 we'll stay here for a little bit but
[43:36] you know as a young person especially
[43:39] when you get to your teenage
[43:42] years sometimes you might feel like you
[43:44] don't have a voice because there's rules
[43:47] surrounding you wherever you go it's uh
[43:50] don't do this or you can do that so you
[43:53] feel like your voice is
[43:55] suppressed you see you have certain
[43:58] desires but you only have to write those
[44:00] desires down they can never be
[44:02] materialized I want to remind you this
[44:04] morning this afternoon young people that
[44:06] your voice is important and most
[44:09] importantly God hears your voice amen
[44:13] Genesis 21:14 says and Abraham rose up
[44:18] early in the morning and took bread in a
[44:21] bottle of water and gave it unto Hagar
[44:25] putting it on her shoulder and a child
[44:29] and sent her away and she departed and
[44:32] wandered in the wilderness of beer Sheba
[44:36] and the water was spent in the bottle
[44:39] and she cast a child under one of the
[44:42] shrubs now I want to want you to
[44:45] understand what's Happening Here young
[44:47] people Hagar is
[44:49] the uh Bond's woman the the the
[44:53] bondswoman of Abraham that Beed him a
[44:56] child and that child was ishmail that
[44:59] was the firstborn of firstborn son of
[45:02] Abraham right but here uh ishmail was
[45:07] was was was
[45:08] mocking uh was mocking
[45:11] Isaac and Sarah was not having it so
[45:15] Sarah told Abraham she got to
[45:18] go and that's exactly what happened
[45:20] that's right and now you
[45:23] find uh you find uh Hagar in the
[45:25] wilderness with her child and she's in a
[45:29] a state here where as a mother she's
[45:32] preparing the death of her child she's
[45:35] preparing the the the I mean it was so
[45:38] bad that she couldn't stand to look at
[45:40] it yes you see yes now as we
[45:44] continue verse 16 it says and she went
[45:48] and sat her down over against him a good
[45:51] way off as it were a bot for she said
[45:55] let me not see the death of the child
[45:57] and she sat over against him and lifted
[46:00] up her voice and
[46:02] wept and then I want to want to say this
[46:05] too is it's it's important young people
[46:08] that when you see your mother weeping
[46:11] when you see your father
[46:12] laboring and being steadfast in prayer
[46:15] don't watch them join them you see I'm
[46:19] going say that again when you see your
[46:21] mother praying and your father praying
[46:24] don't watch them join them amen
[46:28] because prayer produces things Prayer
[46:32] Changes
[46:34] Things and in this in this scene here we
[46:37] see
[46:38] Hagar crying out to the Lord and we
[46:41] heard it on Wednesday if you need
[46:42] something from the Lord cry out for it
[46:45] amen that's what she was doing she was
[46:47] crying out for it Glory but you see
[46:51] Hagar wasn't alone and it's necessary
[46:53] for God to hear the voice of the
[46:55] beneficiary of alongside the voice of
[46:58] the
[46:59] intercessor in verse 17 it says God
[47:02] heard the voice of the lad that's right
[47:05] brother and I want to say your voice is
[47:08] what will make the difference amen see
[47:10] the Bible says that if two of you shall
[47:14] touch and
[47:15] agree and ask anything in my name of My
[47:19] Father which is in he they shall receive
[47:21] it so ishmail was right next to his
[47:26] mother
[47:28] and when God ask her God says I've heard
[47:31] the voice of the
[47:33] lad now it goes on to say the a and the
[47:36] angel of God Called to Hagar out of
[47:38] heaven and said unto her what ath thee
[47:40] Hagar fear not for God hath heard the
[47:44] voice of the lad where he is arise lift
[47:47] up the lad and hold him in thine hand
[47:50] for I will make him a great
[47:53] nation you see and and ishma was about
[47:56] 15 and 19 years old according to
[48:00] historians so I want to encourage you
[48:03] also mothers that your pain is not your
[48:06] promise your hurt is not your hope your
[48:10] failure is not your future and your fear
[48:13] is not your present amen God had a
[48:16] promise to you and God also had a
[48:19] promise to ishma as
[48:22] well verse 19 says and God opened her
[48:24] eyes and she saw a well of War water and
[48:27] she went and filled the bottle with
[48:30] water and gave the lad drink and God was
[48:33] with the lad and he grew and dwelt in
[48:35] the wilderness and became an arker so
[48:38] mothers keep praying keep seeking the
[48:40] Lord God will hear your lad praise the
[48:43] Lord praise God Matthew 6: 19 says lay
[48:48] not up for yourself Treasures upon the
[48:51] Earth where moth and rust doth corrupt
[48:54] and where thieves break through and
[48:56] steal
[48:57] for lay up yourselves Treasures in
[49:00] Heaven where the neither mouth nor rust
[49:03] do corrupt and where thieves do not
[49:05] break through nor steal it's important
[49:09] young people to know where your treasure
[49:10] is and how much time you're committing
[49:12] to
[49:13] it whom your heart is surrendered to
[49:16] that is whom your master is you're
[49:19] living in a time
[49:21] where you must put God first on every
[49:25] occasion where God regardless of what
[49:28] the circumstance is God is worthy of
[49:31] first place let me say it again God is
[49:34] worthy of first place praise God another
[49:39] untapped resource and we stepped into it
[49:42] here is
[49:43] prayer and not just praying but having a
[49:48] confession being able to speak and
[49:52] confess what you desire what you are
[49:55] seeking after to the
[49:58] Lord 1 Thessalonians 5:17 says pray
[50:02] without
[50:04] season and everything give thanks for
[50:06] this is the will of God in Christ Jesus
[50:09] concerning
[50:10] you Romans 10: 10 says for with the
[50:14] heart man believeth unto righteousness
[50:17] and with the mouth confession is made
[50:19] unto salvation so you see confession
[50:22] awakens the
[50:23] body regardless of the condition to obey
[50:26] what faith believes so whatever you
[50:29] believe faith can conquer it Faith Can
[50:33] Captivate it praise
[50:36] God and when you have nothing else to
[50:38] say in prayer let your life be the
[50:41] prayer that is the
[50:44] greatest voice that can speak in your
[50:46] prayer is your life amen regardless of
[50:49] what you utter your life can either
[50:53] hinder your prayers or promote your
[50:55] prayers so let your life lead your
[50:58] prayer life amen praise God a prophet of
[51:02] God says
[51:03] here in the message Israel in the church
[51:07] in 1953
[51:09] 0326 he says St John
[51:12] 5:24 Jesus said so I am the bread of
[51:15] life that come from God out of Heaven
[51:17] your fathers eat Mana in the wilderness
[51:20] and are dead but he that eat my flesh
[51:23] and drinks my blood ha everlasting life
[51:26] and I'll raise him up in the last day
[51:28] that's what he said now there's many
[51:31] that pretend to be in there there's many
[51:34] that's Waring themselves and trying to
[51:36] live right and trying to press in I
[51:39] don't know about that but if they are in
[51:41] there it's just as easy to live a
[51:45] Christian Life as it is to live any life
[51:48] cuz you're in Christ and nothing else
[51:51] but just the full of the Holy Spirit
[51:53] leads you and guide you and directs you
[51:57] and why sure you'll make mistakes and
[51:59] fall but you can't stay down because
[52:02] you're no more a stock of corn from a
[52:06] sycamore tree by their fruit you shall
[52:08] know them so you
[52:10] see it's just as easy to live a
[52:13] Christian Life and the world today likes
[52:17] to paint Christians as the odd
[52:21] ball the world likes to paint Christians
[52:24] as this this this this this thing that's
[52:27] been tossed
[52:30] away and that's the part where the
[52:32] scripture says You must bear the
[52:34] reproach of
[52:35] Christ because you're not going to be
[52:38] popular to the to the community you're
[52:40] not going to be popular to
[52:42] society but when you stand for God
[52:45] there'll be a time where he'll stand for
[52:47] you amen praise the Lord
[52:50] amen and the reason why it's easy for
[52:54] you to live a Christian Life is because
[52:57] God has made deposits in you he's put
[53:01] something in you that would hold
[53:04] regardless of the
[53:06] circumstance now God sent a message yes
[53:12] sir and the destination of this message
[53:14] young people is not in the books and
[53:16] tapes the destination is
[53:19] you you are the destination of the
[53:22] message of this
[53:23] hour you see
[53:26] the scripture says the letter kth but
[53:29] the spirit gives it life and we're
[53:32] living in the anointing of the seventh
[53:35] age
[53:37] messenger praise the
[53:39] Lord
[53:42] now God sent this message like I said
[53:46] God made deposits in
[53:48] you he put certain characteristics in
[53:51] you that will not only receive this
[53:54] message but identify with this message
[53:58] and the thing about it with God when he
[54:01] puts a deposit in you he adds interest
[54:06] he adds dividends right right he he
[54:09] makes sure that after a
[54:11] while it it it it it it it don't just
[54:14] yield but it it it
[54:18] blossoms you
[54:20] seeall it comes with healing it comes
[54:22] with Deliverance it comes with peace it
[54:26] comes with purpose it comes with
[54:28] protection Hallelujah when you find
[54:30] yourself in a
[54:32] junction the word of God and the
[54:35] predestination of God can lead you
[54:38] on the Bible says to him that is able to
[54:41] do exceedingly abundantly above all that
[54:45] we can ask or think according to the
[54:48] power that worketh in
[54:50] us and we know that power in Romans 1:16
[54:54] says for I am not ashamed of the Gospel
[54:57] for it is the power of God unto
[54:59] salvation to everyone that believeth so
[55:02] the word of God is your power when the
[55:05] enemy comes in and he he tells you what
[55:08] the word says you tell them what you
[55:10] believe you tell them what the word has
[55:14] deposited in
[55:15] you and the other thing about deposits
[55:18] is that eventually you're going to have
[55:20] to withdraw all right and when it comes
[55:23] time for you to
[55:24] withdraw you want to make sure you take
[55:26] everything that belongs to
[55:28] you God has put gifts in you that you
[55:31] can start withdrawing glory and I
[55:33] believe brother Xander made a withdrawal
[55:35] today he decided to exercise what God
[55:38] has deposited in Him Praise the Lord
[55:45] hallelujah the prophet says here in the
[55:48] message the Queen of
[55:50] Sheba he says uh paragraph
[55:54] 16 he says now instead of advancing on
[55:57] and see what God promised we look back
[56:01] and see what some other brother behind
[56:03] us
[56:03] said let's don't look back look forward
[56:07] keep moving on we have untapped
[56:10] resources Jesus said in St Mark 11:23
[56:14] whatsoever if you say to this mountain
[56:16] be moved and don't doubt in your heart
[56:18] but believe that what you have said will
[56:20] come to pass you can have what you said
[56:23] no conditions it's just un limited
[56:27] whatsoever things you desire When you
[56:30] pray you believe that you receive you
[56:32] shall have them whatever uh whatever
[56:35] Divine Healing joy peace anything praise
[56:39] the Lord and message Be not Afraid
[56:42] preach in 1961
[56:45] 0224 Prophet says we've got untapped
[56:48] resources of the Bountiful blessings of
[56:51] God which is not limited but
[56:53] unlimited whatsoever you ask the father
[56:55] in my my name every promise in the book
[56:58] belongs to you when you're saved he
[57:01] gives you a check with his name wrote at
[57:03] the bottom don't be afraid to fill it
[57:06] out cuz the bank of heaven will
[57:08] recognize it if it goes through the
[57:10] Pentecostal Clearing House see that's
[57:13] right if you've got something there on
[57:16] deposit yourself see if you're
[57:19] recognized if you got identification to
[57:23] show that the check belongs to you is
[57:25] only for Believers you if you have that
[57:28] identification while God will recognize
[57:30] your check and then uh says every
[57:34] Redemptive blessings belong to you and
[57:37] so that's why it's important that you
[57:38] have the right
[57:40] identification the world wants to place
[57:42] labels on you the world wants to
[57:45] identify you as its own but God says you
[57:49] belong to me and I known you before the
[57:51] foundation of the earth so identifi this
[57:55] evening Saints
[57:56] with the
[57:58] word praise the
[58:04] Lord I want to turn
[58:09] to want to turn to 2 Kings chapter 5
[58:13] verse
[58:16] one praise the
[58:23] Lord and I was just thinking as I said
[58:25] that
[58:26] brother Josiah also made a withdraw some
[58:29] time ago and I'm looking for a lot of
[58:33] these young young people make
[58:34] withdrawals on what God has deposited in
[58:36] you to exercise that gift to yield that
[58:39] gift and as we see in the in the life of
[58:42] Samuel you don't have to wait to serve
[58:45] the Lord you can be where you are as
[58:48] long as you yield and surrender yourself
[58:50] to what God is doing in your in your
[58:52] midst God can use you and I want want
[58:56] you to keep in mind that the voice of
[58:59] God is sounding every Sunday the voice
[59:03] of God is sounding every
[59:05] Wednesday right the the the God told us
[59:09] that this is his beloved Son to hear ye
[59:13] him he has made him materialized and
[59:16] made himself
[59:17] manifested in this day in others amen
[59:22] he's made himself
[59:24] manifested in the in in the Prophet he's
[59:26] made himself manifested in his bride so
[59:29] when you see your brother that is the
[59:33] manifestation of that word when you see
[59:35] your sister that is the manifestation of
[59:37] that word amen praise the Lord
[59:42] now this is another young person that
[59:47] was willing to go beyond the
[59:49] camp and
[59:52] here we'll read about the the life of
[59:55] this captain
[59:57] uh but in this Captain uh he was he was
[1:00:00] a great man uh that was very respected
[1:00:03] among his his his his uh his team his
[1:00:06] his
[1:00:06] leaders uh but he came and had a
[1:00:09] condition in his body and it took
[1:00:13] the a a young person willing to go
[1:00:16] beyond where they were to get him to uh
[1:00:20] the the healing that he needed for his
[1:00:21] body right you see so we'll go ahead and
[1:00:25] read that here in 2 Kings chapter 5 it
[1:00:29] says now non captain of the hosts of the
[1:00:31] king of Syria was a great man with his
[1:00:34] master and honorable because by him the
[1:00:37] Lord had given Deliverance unto Syria he
[1:00:40] was also might a mighty man but was a
[1:00:44] leper and the syrians had gone out by
[1:00:48] companies and had brought away captive
[1:00:50] out of the land of Israel a little a
[1:00:53] little maid and I want to stop here for
[1:00:56] a moment and talk about this little
[1:00:59] Maid see this little Maid was there out
[1:01:02] of her own will she was there not
[1:01:05] because she wanted to she was there
[1:01:07] because she was captive as a slave
[1:01:10] exactly exactly and you see sometimes
[1:01:12] young people you might find yourself in
[1:01:14] a situation you don't want to be in in
[1:01:17] the household you don't want to be in in
[1:01:19] the family you don't want to be in but
[1:01:22] your attitude can make the difference
[1:01:24] your attitude can change the
[1:01:27] circumstance and I'm going to say this
[1:01:29] now God is not surprised by the family
[1:01:32] you're born in that's right God is not
[1:01:35] surprised by the household you grew up
[1:01:37] in it's all intended amen and God has
[1:01:42] interest amen amen this little Maid
[1:01:46] found herself in a unconventional
[1:01:50] situation but she had the right
[1:01:53] Spirit it goes on to say
[1:01:57] and the syrians verse two and the
[1:01:59] syrians had gone out by companies and
[1:02:01] had brought away captive out of the land
[1:02:03] of Israel a little maid and she waited
[1:02:07] on non's wife and she said unto her
[1:02:11] mistress what God my Lord or the prophet
[1:02:15] that is in Samaria for he would recover
[1:02:18] him of his
[1:02:20] leprosy she had a
[1:02:22] revelation of what God was doing in that
[1:02:25] hour right now I want to ask you young
[1:02:28] people how many people have you told
[1:02:30] about your
[1:02:31] Prophet about your
[1:02:34] Elijah and and and not just to not not
[1:02:38] not just to boast of your Prophet but to
[1:02:41] recognize a need right and to minister
[1:02:44] to that need of what God has done
[1:02:48] through his messenger in this last day
[1:02:50] GL to God see Jesus Christ did nothing
[1:02:54] unless the father showed him
[1:02:56] which means everything that Jesus Christ
[1:02:58] did for was on
[1:03:00] purpose so you when you're surrendered
[1:03:03] and yielded in your daytoday life and
[1:03:06] you go to school and you see your
[1:03:07] friends and you communicate with them
[1:03:11] recognize there's a need behind the
[1:03:13] voice and in that need there's a work
[1:03:17] that God has done in this hour that can
[1:03:20] minister to that
[1:03:22] need praise God now I just want to
[1:03:25] continue reading this
[1:03:28] story uh eventually uh we'll go to verse
[1:03:32] 10 praise the Lord it says and Elisha
[1:03:36] sent a messenger unto him saying go and
[1:03:40] wash in the Jordan seven times and thy
[1:03:43] flesh shall come again to thee and thou
[1:03:47] shall be
[1:03:48] clean but non was Roth and went away and
[1:03:51] said behold I thought he shall surely
[1:03:54] come out to me and stand and call on the
[1:03:56] name of the Lord his God and strike his
[1:03:59] hand over the place and recover the
[1:04:03] leper and I like this
[1:04:05] because you see sometimes what we what
[1:04:08] we expect from God is not the way God
[1:04:11] will
[1:04:12] perform and it's important that we
[1:04:15] understand that we cannot put God In The
[1:04:17] Box we can't put God in in a oneway
[1:04:21] road God can can do unlimited things he
[1:04:25] can reveal himself in an unlimited ways
[1:04:29] now I want you to know uh uh Jesus
[1:04:31] Christ says he's able to the stones to
[1:04:34] rise children to Abraham which means god
[1:04:38] purposefully chose
[1:04:41] you he could have chose someone else he
[1:04:44] could have chose him something else but
[1:04:46] he chose you purposefully
[1:04:50] amen it goes on to say uh in verse 12 uh
[1:04:54] it says one of his men says are not ABA
[1:04:57] and farfa rivers of Damascus better than
[1:05:01] all the wells of Israel may I not wash
[1:05:04] in them and be clean so he turned away
[1:05:07] and raged and his servants uh came near
[1:05:09] and spake unto him and said my father if
[1:05:13] the prophet had bid thee to do some
[1:05:14] great thing would is now wouldest thou
[1:05:18] not have done it how much rather when he
[1:05:21] said to thee wash and be
[1:05:23] clean then he went down and dipped
[1:05:26] himself seven times in Jordan according
[1:05:29] to the saying of the man of God and his
[1:05:31] flesh came again like unto the Flesh of
[1:05:34] a little child and he was clean now I
[1:05:38] think this is important to point out
[1:05:40] that regardless of how God intends to
[1:05:43] sanctify you you must be Sanctified it
[1:05:47] is non-negotiable yes you have to be
[1:05:51] cleansed if God tells you to dip in the
[1:05:53] river seven times you have to dip seven
[1:05:56] times if God tells you you have to throw
[1:05:58] away the nail polish if God tells you
[1:06:01] you have to throw away the makeup if God
[1:06:03] tells you you have to throw away uh some
[1:06:05] of the outfits you have in your closet
[1:06:08] amen that's what you must do because
[1:06:11] sanctification is non-negotiable Glory
[1:06:14] it is a must amen praise God
[1:06:17] amen
[1:06:23] amen just looking at my time here not
[1:06:27] sure how much time I have left but
[1:06:30] praise the
[1:06:31] Lord now another untapped resource I
[1:06:34] want to point out
[1:06:37] is
[1:06:39] yourself and as you look at yourself I
[1:06:42] think it's important to understand in
[1:06:44] this carnal flesh that you are a weak
[1:06:47] human
[1:06:49] being but regardless of
[1:06:52] how unable you are to do whatever it is
[1:06:55] God has called you to do the scripture
[1:06:58] says that his strength is made perfect
[1:07:01] in your
[1:07:03] weakness you see and I think it it it it
[1:07:06] it it's important and it's necessary
[1:07:09] that you accept that
[1:07:11] weakness so that God's strength can
[1:07:14] Prevail in your
[1:07:16] situation you see when you understand
[1:07:19] that you are
[1:07:21] unable then you w then this this gospel
[1:07:24] this word it's like like a a a sick
[1:07:27] individual when they understand their
[1:07:29] condition that medication is important
[1:07:32] to them because that's what they depend
[1:07:35] on when you understand your weaknesses
[1:07:39] then you will understand how much this
[1:07:41] word ought to matter to you pise God
[1:07:44] this word is everything to
[1:07:46] you the scripture says that it is the
[1:07:49] word that gives you power it is the word
[1:07:53] that makes you overcome regardless of
[1:07:55] what you're facing
[1:07:57] yes so your Christian Life ought to be
[1:08:01] something that you surrender every day
[1:08:04] so that you can live in that power am
[1:08:07] praise
[1:08:09] God I'm
[1:08:12] reminded of a few
[1:08:14] men that had their most weakest
[1:08:19] moments and we can recall the life of
[1:08:24] the the parable of the
[1:08:27] son and it was when he lost everything
[1:08:32] it was when he was in his weakest State
[1:08:34] the scripture says he came to himself
[1:08:37] and then when he came to himself he was
[1:08:41] able to get back on the right Journey
[1:08:44] get back and step right and it was at
[1:08:47] that point that the strength that was
[1:08:50] already in him began to be restored
[1:08:55] now I want you to understand that you
[1:08:58] might find yourself in a moment of
[1:09:00] weakness but the strength already lies
[1:09:03] in
[1:09:03] you and it's going to take for you to
[1:09:06] come to yourself to
[1:09:08] recognize what you've been called
[1:09:12] for God the prophet of God says here in
[1:09:16] the message God's power to
[1:09:18] transform he says and everything under
[1:09:21] control to bring forth of its kind now
[1:09:25] remember to bring when he put the seed
[1:09:28] in the Earth the seed can only come
[1:09:30] forth with the power of life within it
[1:09:33] to transform it from a seed to a plant
[1:09:37] or whatever it was his transforming
[1:09:39] power now God put the seed in there with
[1:09:43] potentials that it would be what he said
[1:09:45] it would be and as long as it stayed in
[1:09:48] its right category it would be just
[1:09:51] exactly what God said it would be it had
[1:09:54] to be that way because he had made it to
[1:09:57] stay in that channel that anything that
[1:10:00] stays in his channel in his line of word
[1:10:02] it will bring forth exactly like his
[1:10:05] word said it will do it cannot move from
[1:10:07] it it's channeled exactly right it goes
[1:10:11] on to say uh I'm going to jump a few
[1:10:14] paragraphs a few sentences here it says
[1:10:16] uh that's what it must be because I have
[1:10:19] given every SE transforming power to
[1:10:22] make out of itself in its potentials now
[1:10:25] to make out of itself exactly what I
[1:10:27] want it to be praise the Lord and in
[1:10:31] closing I want
[1:10:33] to go to a few
[1:10:37] scriptures in Book of
[1:10:39] Proverbs Proverbs 25:
[1:10:44] 19 praise the
[1:10:48] Lord now as we turn to this
[1:10:52] scripture I want to ask a question to
[1:10:54] the young people
[1:10:55] how many of you like a broken
[1:11:00] tooth that's a weird question isn't
[1:11:03] it oh what if what if your foot was out
[1:11:06] of joint how many of you would like
[1:11:09] that Proverbs 2519 says
[1:11:13] confidence in an Unfaithful man in time
[1:11:18] of trouble is like a broken tooth in a
[1:11:21] foot out of
[1:11:23] joint you see it's important that you
[1:11:26] understand you must be faithful amen
[1:11:29] because your unfaithfulness will cause
[1:11:31] discomfort to you and to
[1:11:34] others your faithfulness is necessary
[1:11:37] Hallelujah Proverbs
[1:11:43] 28:20 it says a faithful man shall
[1:11:46] abound with blessings but he that make
[1:11:49] haste to be rich shall not be
[1:11:51] innocent so when your faithfulness
[1:11:54] precedes your sacrifice blessings will
[1:11:57] flow so I encourage you young people to
[1:12:00] be faithful to the Lord in all that you
[1:12:03] do praise God let us
[1:12:10] bow Heavenly
[1:12:12] Father Lord God we want to thank you

[1:12:27] again oh God reminded us the power of
[1:12:31] your word the power of your
[1:12:34] transformation and Lord it is only by

[1:12:41] word and Lord we yet realize God that
[1:12:44] you have placed in us all the elements
[1:12:49] you've placed in us all the right
[1:12:51] materials oh God that would come to
[1:12:54] subjection to every word for you said
[1:12:57] man should not live by bread alone but
[1:12:59] by every word that proceeds out of your
[1:13:02] mouth so God we honor you Lord and
[1:13:05] knowing that your word is our greatest
[1:13:08] weapon your word is what leads us so
[1:13:14] father may we always be reminded Lord
[1:13:18] that your word must reign in our hearts
[1:13:20] may your word be our treasure may your
[1:13:23] word be our anchor
[1:13:26] and father God we just ask that you
[1:13:27] would continue to meet the needs of your
[1:13:29] young people Lord minister to them daily
