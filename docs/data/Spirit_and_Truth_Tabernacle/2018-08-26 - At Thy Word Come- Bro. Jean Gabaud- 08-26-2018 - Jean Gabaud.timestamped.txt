[1:02:15] moment amen greet you all in the name of
[1:02:18] the Lord Jesus is certainly good to be
[1:02:20] back in the house of the Lord amen just
[1:02:23] appreciate all your prayers and you know
[1:02:26] just to kind of elaborate on what
[1:02:28] brother Jack was kind of explaining I
[1:02:30] know a few of you has been asking you
[1:02:33] know about my mom and so things kind of
[1:02:36] rapidly transpired the last few weeks
[1:02:38] and I was explained to brother Jack Duff
[1:02:41] that the last three years has been
[1:02:42] trying and but you know you always uh
[1:02:46] you always remain faithful you've known
[1:02:49] in a you know in the God that you
[1:02:50] worship and you believe in so you know
[1:02:54] my mom's been you know you know been a
[1:02:57] battling condition with kidneys and um
[1:03:00] and so she's been on dialysis for quite
[1:03:04] some time and you know here shortly she
[1:03:08] started to get into a weakened state and
[1:03:11] just really in our body she starts to
[1:03:14] get really weak and so the doctors were
[1:03:18] saying that things didn't look too good
[1:03:21] so the doctors say that things didn't
[1:03:23] look too good and that um and that are
[1:03:27] they you know she may no longer be a
[1:03:29] candidate for dialysis treatment and so
[1:03:32] you know she stopped eating and she got
[1:03:34] really weak in the body and just really
[1:03:37] frail so they took our dialysis and they
[1:03:41] you know put her into a hospice so I'm
[1:03:43] thinking that you know we had several
[1:03:45] weeks to kind of make arrangements you
[1:03:47] know make preparations and things of
[1:03:49] that nature and but but it you know her
[1:03:54] health quickly deteriorated so when they
[1:03:56] put her into Hospice the a couple of
[1:04:00] days later just within a couple of days
[1:04:01] she drew her last breath and so you know
[1:04:05] she's you know she kind of struggle for
[1:04:07] quite some time and I know she's in a
[1:04:08] better place and it was a it was three
[1:04:12] years to the exact month that my father
[1:04:15] had passed away so it was in the exact
[1:04:17] same month and it's just been trying
[1:04:19] because as I was
[1:04:20] explain to your brother Duff was that
[1:04:22] you know three years ago was my father
[1:04:23] that last year was my mother-in-law and
[1:04:26] then within the last month it was my it
[1:04:27] was my mother but you know brother Bram
[1:04:29] said something that's pretty remarkably
[1:04:31] says you know he says you know if I pray
[1:04:33] for ten thousand people tonight and ten
[1:04:37] thousand of them died in the morning he
[1:04:39] says tomorrow night with the same faith
[1:04:41] that still preached divine healing it
[1:04:44] doesn't change who God is
[1:04:46] it doesn't change in the God that I
[1:04:48] believe in amen
[1:04:50] so I'm comforted to know that she's in a
[1:04:53] better place we still got a struggle she
[1:04:56] doesn't have to struggle anymore so so
[1:04:59] there's there's there's there scriptures
[1:05:00] that I'm encouraged by whenever you know
[1:05:02] when you go through trials and
[1:05:04] tribulation so it's just it's just been
[1:05:07] a whirlwind the last several weeks and
[1:05:10] how we quickly have to move and work
[1:05:13] with family so if I just appreciate your
[1:05:15] support
[1:05:15] you know the prayers and just always
[1:05:18] being available for us so just thought I
[1:05:21] want to expound on that a little bit
[1:05:23] more I won't keep you too long if you
[1:05:24] might if you don't mind just standing
[1:05:26] with me turn with me to Matthew chapter
[1:05:30] 14 just a little simple thought this
[1:05:34] morning I'm sure many of you have read
[1:05:38] it before but thought I just expand on
[1:05:40] it a little bit I administered on this
[1:05:43] on a Wednesday night at a home church
[1:05:45] some time back and I've have appreciate
[1:05:48] some of the thoughts that some of the
[1:05:51] nuggets that are kind of embedded within
[1:05:53] the scripture so I thought I'd just
[1:05:55] expand on this a little bit amen Matthew
[1:05:59] chapter 14 say man if you dare Tamara
[1:06:02] verse 22 Matthew 14 verse 22 and it
[1:06:09] reads and straightway Jesus constrained
[1:06:11] his disciples to go into a ship and to
[1:06:14] go before him unto the other side why he
[1:06:18] sent the multitudes away and when he had
[1:06:22] sent the multitudes away he went up into
[1:06:24] a mountain apart to pray and when they
[1:06:27] was come he was there alone but the ship
[1:06:31] was now in the midst of the sea tossed
[1:06:33] with ways where the wind was contrary
[1:06:35] and in the fourth watch of the night
[1:06:38] Jesus went unto them walking on the sea
[1:06:41] and when the disciples saw him walking
[1:06:44] on the sea they were troubled saying it
[1:06:46] is a spirit and they cried out for fear
[1:06:49] but straightway Jesus spake unto them
[1:06:52] saying be of good cheer it is I be not
[1:06:55] afraid
[1:06:56] compete or insert him and said lord if a
[1:07:00] beast thou bid me come unto thee on the
[1:07:03] water and he said come and when Peter
[1:07:07] was come down out of the ship he walked
[1:07:09] on the water to go to Jesus but when he
[1:07:12] saw the wind boisterous he was afraid
[1:07:15] and beginning to sink he cried saying
[1:07:18] lord save me and immediately Jesus
[1:07:21] stretched forth his hand and caught him
[1:07:24] and said unto Him o thou of little faith
[1:07:26] wherefore did a style down and when they
[1:07:30] were come into the ship the wind seized
[1:07:35] may the Lord had his blessing to the
[1:07:37] reading of the word you may be seated a
[1:07:43] very well-known scripture for sure I
[1:07:48] know that many of you've read it before
[1:07:50] and are very familiar with that
[1:07:51] scripture and I've I appreciate that
[1:07:55] scripture because there's just so many
[1:07:56] depths in meaning that's that's captured
[1:07:59] into this portion of scripture that
[1:08:02] we're going to go into just for a moment
[1:08:04] of time and we're just gonna really try
[1:08:07] to our best to kind of labor upon this
[1:08:10] thought and kind of provide some
[1:08:13] offshoots some nuggets here and there
[1:08:16] but you know I find it pretty remarkable
[1:08:20] because of just how things this begins
[1:08:23] to unfold and you know I don't believe
[1:08:26] that these are written in the scripture
[1:08:28] just by
[1:08:30] coincidence there's there's a lesson
[1:08:34] that's embedded in the scripture that
[1:08:36] God wants us to draw from because he
[1:08:39] wants to he wants you to know that your
[1:08:42] situation is not unique and that you
[1:08:46] know there are others in the scripture
[1:08:48] that has gone through you know similar
[1:08:50] journey and paths that you've gone
[1:08:53] through and how they've come out on the
[1:08:56] other end is a testament of how God's
[1:08:58] gonna bring you out on the other end and
[1:09:01] the the scripture starts with Jesus
[1:09:04] constrained his disciples to get into
[1:09:07] the ship and he tells them to go before
[1:09:10] him not to the other side now he's
[1:09:12] provided direction for his disciples and
[1:09:15] he said you go on in this journey and
[1:09:18] I'll catch up with you and you know
[1:09:21] sometimes you just got to take God at
[1:09:23] His Word so if they get on this ship
[1:09:28] they get on this boat and they make way
[1:09:30] to go to the other side and in their
[1:09:34] just trusting that God is they figure it
[1:09:36] all out because Jesus you know he left
[1:09:38] and then left without Jesus so he's
[1:09:41] gonna figure it all out and so he went
[1:09:44] and we sent the multitudes away and
[1:09:46] meanwhile why he sent the multitudes
[1:09:49] away he went into a place that was apart
[1:09:53] from distraction a place that was apart
[1:09:56] from disbelief
[1:09:58] place that was apart from doubt and he
[1:10:01] begins to pray and he begins to pray as
[1:10:06] the Sun begins to set and it begins to
[1:10:09] get into the evening time and in no
[1:10:12] doubt he's praying for the ones that he
[1:10:15] just sits on the journey so even as it
[1:10:19] feels that God is not listening he's
[1:10:22] always thinking about you
[1:10:25] he's always he's always have a word of
[1:10:28] comfort for you so he he's out there and
[1:10:32] he's he's he's praying alone because he
[1:10:35] knows that he sent his disciple on a
[1:10:37] journey and he knows that along the
[1:10:40] journey that winds are gonna come trials
[1:10:44] are gonna come tribulations are gonna
[1:10:46] come and so he wants to make sure that
[1:10:49] you know that they have protection that
[1:10:52] that they have guidance and that someone
[1:10:54] is there that other the very power of
[1:10:58] God is watching over them so Authority
[1:11:02] so he begins to pray in his alone in
[1:11:04] this prayer and as it begins to pray and
[1:11:10] then this is not one of them quick
[1:11:12] prayers but this is one of them grow
[1:11:13] meet role where he's trying to tap into
[1:11:17] the throne of God it's not just because
[1:11:21] because he was interested me he was
[1:11:24] invested in this size in his dollar and
[1:11:28] so those who you want to make sure that
[1:11:29] the power
[1:11:31] having ascended of heaven as sincere as
[1:11:34] possible to reach the Almighty God he's
[1:11:37] giving us the demonstration that when
[1:11:39] you're learning player that you're just
[1:11:41] not imagining things that you're trying
[1:11:44] to enter into a place in it's your realm
[1:11:46] where you come into contact with God if
[1:11:49] you're looking at me confused you
[1:11:50] haven't done some good praying because
[1:11:54] if you're if you're in the moment of
[1:11:56] desperation where you need God you stay
[1:11:58] at the foot of the altar until you come
[1:12:01] into contact with something supernatural
[1:12:04] because you need something super magic
[1:12:07] to deal with your natural things and
[1:12:11] there's an atmosphere that's created
[1:12:14] that's so different that you lose the
[1:12:17] sense of time you lose the sense of your
[1:12:19] sarandí and are you loving the
[1:12:22] of the almighty and as Jesus begins to
[1:12:31] pray this ship is now in the midst of
[1:12:36] the sea now he represents people
[1:12:41] attitudes in Chinese that's what the
[1:12:43] body is so you know so here we are in
[1:12:47] the midst of the world and so we're in
[1:12:50] the midst of the sea tossed its ways for
[1:12:53] the wind was contrary and you know what
[1:12:56] happens is that but you know the sea
[1:12:58] typically is calm but there are spirits
[1:13:01] that comes or ways that comes that
[1:13:03] disturbs the sea and it causes waves to
[1:13:07] come up you know you were comfortable in
[1:13:10] this ship yes stability but something's
[1:13:13] not walking it a little bit and so
[1:13:17] you're trying to find something to hold
[1:13:19] on to you in the funny way here starts
[1:13:24] to rise up
[1:13:34] together
[1:14:14] the class right the lightness God made a
[1:14:19] promise to me this ship is my side
[1:14:25] turning the Baathists is this the
[1:14:36] baddest says in another place this is a
[1:14:39] medievalist come this ship was in the
[1:14:41] midst of the sea and Jesus was a land
[1:14:44] and the land and he Jesus so there
[1:14:52] [Music]
[1:14:54] Charlie and Larry for the word is
[1:14:58] contrary unto them you know when life
[1:15:05] hits your heart if things just seems to
[1:15:12] shatter into thousands of pieces he's 52
[1:15:16] in the battle by yourself
[1:15:19] the Bible says that Jesus was on the
[1:15:22] land and a mountain but it is watching
[1:15:26] in the distance
[1:15:29] truly he saw them struggling he saw the
[1:15:33] be persecuted he is keeping an eye on
[1:15:35] that to make sure that nothing happens
[1:15:38] to them the journey let me tell you it's
[1:15:57] the same it's the same got the same
[1:16:08] message
[1:16:09] [Music]
[1:16:13] can we say praise the Lord and the ship
[1:16:18] was tossed to and fro and no doubt fear
[1:16:23] started to rise out anymore the thing
[1:16:26] about it is you know we don't we we have
[1:16:29] this degree of uncertainty because all
[1:16:33] we have is just God's words and that's
[1:16:37] all we got a little too but I will tell
[1:16:42] you that God's Word is more powerful
[1:16:45] than any medical instrument God Lord is
[1:16:51] more powerful than any pharmaceutical
[1:16:53] manufacturer God
[1:16:57] by powerful than any counselor on this
[1:16:59] earth any psychiatrist any psychologist
[1:17:03] because the bond with this faith is that
[1:17:05] substance if all I have to hold on to is
[1:17:10] something I wanna hold on to God's words
[1:17:13] your bank account will not save you your
[1:17:18] job will not save you your eloquent
[1:17:22] speech a good dress none of that was
[1:17:24] saving when it comes down to when it
[1:17:26] comes to your salvation but the ship is
[1:17:39] now in the midst of the sea tossed with
[1:17:42] ways for the wind was contrary and then
[1:17:47] the fourth watch of the night when it's
[1:17:51] all dark and you're in the middle of
[1:17:55] this shouting and screaming and no one
[1:17:58] knows no one cares no it's very noisy
[1:18:02] aware in the midst of effect let me tell
[1:18:06] you since you got a picture this when
[1:18:07] you have been the middle of us of an
[1:18:09] ocean when there's no rights there's no
[1:18:16] direction under the night sky and you
[1:18:21] wonder how he's gonna find you let me
[1:18:27] tell you they had none of the
[1:18:28] instruments that we have today but he
[1:18:31] knows exactly where
[1:18:36] you could be sitting in church and not
[1:18:39] thinking about God he knows exactly
[1:18:41] where he could be go through the motions
[1:18:48] of Christianity but he knows exactly
[1:18:51] where you're at and he knows exactly
[1:18:57] where to come and find you not only
[1:19:02] during the day but in the middle of the
[1:19:04] night when no one else is around with no
[1:19:08] one else bushel pains with no one else
[1:19:11] those are struggles when you can't sleep
[1:19:13] at night when you twist and turn when
[1:19:16] you're worried about the next day he
[1:19:18] knows how to come to your prayer there's
[1:19:20] no I'll come to your heart he knows how
[1:19:22] to reach exactly in your moment of
[1:19:24] distress man's word would always fail to
[1:19:31] say the right things they wouldn't word
[1:19:33] from God Saints and in the first watch
[1:19:41] Jesus went unto them not imagine this he
[1:19:47] didn't send angels he didn't sent serums
[1:19:52] he came himself when anybody fell they
[1:19:58] got back to Jesus they got back to
[1:20:00] goddesses I mean your children has
[1:20:03] fallen God what are you gonna do about
[1:20:05] it
[1:20:05] program illustration diseases Michael
[1:20:08] wanted to go down there guy says this is
[1:20:10] not a job for you Gabriel says I'm
[1:20:15] raising their penis guy says calm down
[1:20:17] it's not to you the Bible says he could
[1:20:20] not repay anyone later
[1:20:22] so God here by himself he had to come
[1:20:27] down destinies Allah pulses great is the
[1:20:29] mystery of godliness for God manifested
[1:20:32] flesh the Bible says Jesus came walking
[1:20:40] on water now I want you to just read
[1:20:46] over things the Bible says he came
[1:20:49] walking on water now for the disciples
[1:20:54] this was an urgent situation this was
[1:20:58] the state of emergency what is God Jesus
[1:21:01] casually walking on water because God is
[1:21:05] in control of all things he sees your
[1:21:09] panic but God still in control he sees
[1:21:13] the urgent business for you the gods in
[1:21:15] control he sees how you just nervous but
[1:21:18] God's in control
[1:21:19] he seems like you're anxious anxiety
[1:21:22] your stress level but God's in control
[1:21:27] because God doesn't just react to your
[1:21:29] emotions he wants you to know that he's
[1:21:31] dead control there's no situation too
[1:21:35] big no problem too difficult no possible
[1:21:39] situation too impossible that he doesn't
[1:21:42] come on the scene he just casually comes
[1:21:47] walking on water
[1:21:48] who's they they defy every bit of logic
[1:21:52] every bit of reasoning and he just comes
[1:21:56] walking the water the Bible says walking
[1:21:59] on the sea and when the disciples saw
[1:22:03] him rather than doing backflips and
[1:22:06] being joyful the Bible says that they
[1:22:09] thought they saw a ghost and they cried
[1:22:14] out for fear that is in receiving a
[1:22:22] supernatural they were fearful of the
[1:22:27] supernatural
[1:22:28] it's as if we pray for somebody who's
[1:22:32] lines that lurk in you just let them see
[1:22:34] and God does that we're step back is oh
[1:22:36] my gosh when it happens we don't know
[1:22:45] how to react to the supernatural because
[1:22:49] we just let the words become words we
[1:22:52] let the places become and then when the
[1:22:55] Sudarsana bring us to a point where the
[1:22:57] natural where the supernatural becomes
[1:22:59] natural to us the reason like that's the
[1:23:04] point is that's how you're going to take
[1:23:05] a change in the body there's none of
[1:23:08] these days it's more than just preaching
[1:23:10] a good gospel that you're gonna change
[1:23:12] in the body it's moving you responded to
[1:23:14] an a man that I'm gonna take a change in
[1:23:17] the body I believe it doesn't happen
[1:23:20] today I'm looking forward to it tomorrow
[1:23:23] if it doesn't happen tonight
[1:23:25] I'm looking for the next day if it
[1:23:27] doesn't happen this week I'm looking for
[1:23:29] it next week but it's bound to happen
[1:23:35] the supernatural should become natural
[1:23:38] to us
[1:23:41] Berlin puts it this way he says Peter
[1:23:44] when he was in the boat the night before
[1:23:46] or or so forth and the warders was
[1:23:49] twisting back and forth and Jesus was
[1:23:50] standing walking on the water he was he
[1:23:53] was scared of him
[1:23:54] he thought he was spooky or something
[1:23:58] sunny saw a ghost and the only thing
[1:24:00] that could help them to help hug them
[1:24:02] they were scared of it
[1:24:05] that's the way it is today with the
[1:24:08] people that's what's the matter with
[1:24:10] America tonight the only thing that
[1:24:14] could save America from Total
[1:24:16] Annihilation is to recharge you God we
[1:24:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost that's exactly
[1:24:24] right and they're scared of it that's
[1:24:30] right god help us to have a revival
[1:24:32] about shake the shell the shells off
[1:24:35] that's what we read today they're scared
[1:24:38] of the very thing that they need I am
[1:24:44] not ashamed of this gospel I'm not just
[1:24:49] a Christian when I'm in church cuz I'm
[1:24:53] not scared of Who I am out there in the
[1:24:55] world I'm a Christian in church I'm a
[1:24:59] Christian outside of church I'm a son of
[1:25:03] God at work unless son of God when I was
[1:25:08] in school okay I'm getting a couple of
[1:25:12] eight minutes in there I want y'all to
[1:25:13] reflect I will send a God when I'm in
[1:25:18] traffic and some are cut in front of me
[1:25:22] it's not always easy but I gotta
[1:25:24] remember I'm the son of God you just
[1:25:32] never know got a tension that kind of
[1:25:34] way years ago number I was going to
[1:25:38] church on my company off him like nails
[1:25:39] get ready to tell them something they'll
[1:25:43] go in the st. church I was going to now
[1:25:46] Hawkwood out they going to church we
[1:25:52] stand together
[1:25:54] oh I'm a son of God I'm a child of God
[1:26:01] that's who I am
[1:26:02] that's my makeup that's my language
[1:26:06] that's my dress that's who I am
[1:26:22] then my club lips ain't nothin new than
[1:26:31] making the war feel uncomfortable you
[1:26:35] may have a business dinner and everybody
[1:26:37] starts eating your own limbani head Lord
[1:26:39] Jesus I'm gonna thank you for this food
[1:26:42] they'll know whether to chew just stop
[1:26:44] to church just impress people
[1:26:59] statement that in this generation the
[1:27:01] worldwide an individual that would
[1:27:04] declare that God is the line when I
[1:27:12] don't have an answer I still pray about
[1:27:14] it I know it's not popular when you sit
[1:27:21] out there but that's the language that
[1:27:23] God has put in neither sweet I'll let
[1:27:31] you just think about that for Oh the
[1:27:35] diseases coming just you know it's easy
[1:27:37] to just be comfortable and say brother I
[1:27:41] love you sister I appreciate you moving
[1:27:44] in the battlefield by yourself and
[1:27:46] they're not a deacon around and the
[1:27:49] pastor's not around and you're in your
[1:27:51] sisters not around and it's just you God
[1:27:57] the reason like this is a point that the
[1:28:00] Hollies drawing close and it's getting
[1:28:04] darker some of the listed a lot of lines
[1:28:07] shine as white as they can it needs to
[1:28:12] be a limit of differentiation it needs
[1:28:15] to be a limit where there is something
[1:28:18] that's different between me in the world
[1:28:20] not what I believe not what I say but
[1:28:23] it's how I
[1:28:25] is how I demonstrate is how they see the
[1:28:27] life of God
[1:28:28] that's just flowing out of me then we'll
[1:28:35] need to see you you'll have to preach
[1:28:37] one word because if that's a child of
[1:28:39] God wasn't in my notes but I thought I'd
[1:28:45] drop it in anyhow insanely Jesus spoke
[1:28:51] this is beautyrx I know this defies the
[1:28:54] laws of science
[1:28:55] I know technology can explain this I
[1:28:58] know the greatest minds don't know
[1:29:00] what's happening but it is I your Lord
[1:29:02] and Savior that's walking on water
[1:29:04] that's doing the impossible
[1:29:06] I know science can explain it science
[1:29:13] can explain everything it defines the
[1:29:19] critical thinking back there so I've
[1:29:22] seen a man welcome water in Jesus had to
[1:29:26] appeal to their hearts and say be of
[1:29:29] good cheer I know this is very
[1:29:31] supernatural you've never seen this
[1:29:33] before but it is I so they're looking at
[1:29:38] the situation that Jesus kind of makes
[1:29:40] this way and Peter boldly stands up and
[1:29:44] said lord if it be you did needs to come
[1:29:50] on to thee on the water and then Jesus
[1:29:57] didn't preach a long sermon he didn't go
[1:30:00] on for he didn't start from Genesis and
[1:30:02] make his way up to where he's at now he
[1:30:05] just went there
[1:30:07] [Music]
[1:30:09] the ability superior to doing that Jesus
[1:30:12] was doing rested in one word if all you
[1:30:19] need is yes just one more that's
[1:30:21] efficient when you're laying in the
[1:30:25] hospital bed alone in the summer just be
[1:30:27] one word from God they could make me
[1:30:31] whole again when I'm depressed Ellen is
[1:30:33] just one more when I'm confused are
[1:30:36] these just Network oh Jesus service come
[1:30:48] Jesus tonight Peter did you believe in
[1:30:51] the holy cow he can do backflips Kenny
[1:30:56] speaking Thai he says come I want that
[1:31:04] to resume because it takes more than a
[1:31:06] sermon it takes more than keep preaching
[1:31:09] hey stop word of God
[1:31:11] the penetrate deeper to the sky of the
[1:31:14] speed of godith in here that could
[1:31:16] change your life for Peter to deny
[1:31:24] everything rested on one word all Jesus
[1:31:31] said that is the power of God's words
[1:31:41] but you know what they're meant for
[1:31:43] Peter and that that he had to leave his
[1:31:47] comfort he was on the boat the boat was
[1:31:55] supporting him
[1:31:56] so he was okay as long as it was in the
[1:31:59] boat as long as his finances in order
[1:32:03] he was okay because he's fast someone he
[1:32:06] could drop from the break from as long
[1:32:08] as he has a child to go back to you see
[1:32:11] if this fine
[1:32:12] as long as the other four okay as well
[1:32:16] as this half is good this boat okay but
[1:32:20] just as our forget your finance forget
[1:32:24] your else forget your job forget your
[1:32:27] phone step outside of the boat don't
[1:32:32] require action that's much more than you
[1:32:35] cinder say amen
[1:32:37] to say they take action he had to leave
[1:32:43] his comfort there are those in the boat
[1:32:48] [Music]
[1:32:51] no others those on the boat but there
[1:32:56] was less brave then they are willing to
[1:32:59] take the Word of God as Peter was and so
[1:33:03] they kind of retreated towards the
[1:33:04] badness that you're really going to do
[1:33:05] this because we see how the waves is
[1:33:10] kind of situations are kind of scary
[1:33:13] outside that's what faith is we were in
[1:33:19] church and pastor preaching really
[1:33:20] geared you feel real comfortable every
[1:33:22] by comes and sitting in their assigned
[1:33:23] seats and we've done so we just aren't
[1:33:28] comfortable
[1:33:28] god forbid that's a nice thing yes I see
[1:33:30] that just throws your whole Sunday off
[1:33:32] yeah it's happened to me through my life
[1:33:34] and I will walk them situated one
[1:33:35] science about was thinner sign C we have
[1:33:37] to go back and kind of plan our
[1:33:38] challenge where else are we gonna go
[1:33:39] stare it messes up the whole Sunday I'm
[1:33:42] reusing rivers shafted clothes trying to
[1:33:47] take you out of your comfort zone but
[1:33:49] only silly typically sit over here
[1:33:52] tonight when you can get a piece of the
[1:33:53] world see right here so we could get
[1:33:56] before no matter where you sit
[1:33:58] Ricci lives alone Peter had to step
[1:34:10] outside of his comfort zone and Danny
[1:34:14] Jesus was he stepped out he wasn't shy
[1:34:18] rationalizes his soul was resting them
[1:34:23] with a word come here how deep the water
[1:34:28] was his faith had been resonated so much
[1:34:33] he had received such notification that
[1:34:37] if he could see God doing it himself
[1:34:39] Danny never tell you to do something
[1:34:42] that he himself has it done just don't
[1:34:50] dolly that he hasn't ghost you then
[1:34:52] you'll get today he hasn't cost you this
[1:34:58] is that when Israel was battling the
[1:34:59] Philistines and they're saying well this
[1:35:01] is because your God is the god of the
[1:35:03] mountain that's the reason why you have
[1:35:05] about all the victories and gases then
[1:35:07] let's bring this battle to the valleys
[1:35:12] Peter started walking on this water he
[1:35:15] started walking towards Jesus imagine
[1:35:18] that st. he was doing the impossible he
[1:35:24] was doing what no one else was capable
[1:35:27] of doing he was defined the very laws of
[1:35:30] science
[1:35:32] he was defying the philosophers back
[1:35:35] there the counselors the teachers the
[1:35:37] mathematicians who say well according to
[1:35:39] the laws of gravity and all this stuff
[1:35:40] none of that mattered
[1:35:42] everything was resting upon one word he
[1:35:47] tells you come if he tell you he did you
[1:35:52] to come then he has an obligation
[1:35:57] to watch over he's committed to his word
[1:36:06] God is committed to his word because
[1:36:11] Missy Lord didn't meet accompanies this
[1:36:13] come blood has an obligation to watch
[1:36:15] over that word and he walked on water to
[1:36:28] go to Jesus he didn't have any financial
[1:36:34] support his 401k his job he left that
[1:36:38] ship he now had to stand upon faith it's
[1:36:43] not to say that there's anything bad in
[1:36:45] that but your faith is resting upon
[1:36:47] God's words then whatever happens to you
[1:36:50] in your natural course of life God has
[1:36:53] you in his hands and Peter put his faith
[1:36:59] into action and he begins to walk
[1:37:03] towards Jesus mother and puts it this
[1:37:10] way he says look at Peter Peter was in
[1:37:14] trouble looked like he was going to die
[1:37:16] and he's seen the Lord coming Lord come
[1:37:20] walking on the water and said lord if
[1:37:21] that be you bid me to come the Lord said
[1:37:26] come now if Peter said now wait a minute
[1:37:29] Lord let me go on and fast for forty
[1:37:32] days to see if I can walk on water or
[1:37:35] not Oh Lord let me get enough spirit
[1:37:38] only that I can dance in the spirit and
[1:37:40] speaking turns on in this boat that I
[1:37:43] can step out no sir he took God at his
[1:37:47] roar let me
[1:37:49] and let go it's a god and his words can
[1:37:58] you just imagine that is forsaking your
[1:38:01] friends the very ones that was in the
[1:38:04] same boat with you but didn't have
[1:38:07] enough courage didn't have enough faith
[1:38:09] to take God at His Word and Foley's want
[1:38:12] to stay behind you move forward you keep
[1:38:16] your eyes fixated upon Jesus and Peter
[1:38:22] started walking towards Jesus let me
[1:38:26] tell you when God begins to do a work he
[1:38:31] does a complete work it reminds me of
[1:38:35] another story
[1:38:36] this is counted no quick intermission
[1:38:37] before we wrap it up with Matthew
[1:38:39] reminds me of another so when Peter was
[1:38:42] kept in prison because Herod wanted him
[1:38:45] dead and so he was in prison and there
[1:38:49] was prayer that was being made of the
[1:38:50] church forgotten and when Herod had
[1:38:53] would have brought went forth the same
[1:38:56] night Peter was sleeping between two
[1:38:58] soldiers bound with two change and the
[1:39:02] keepers before the door kept the prison
[1:39:05] so there was no way out of that
[1:39:07] situation it seemed impossible and
[1:39:11] behold the angel of the Lord came upon
[1:39:13] him and the light shine and the prison
[1:39:16] and he smoked Peter on the sinuses wake
[1:39:19] up all rise quickly and his chains fell
[1:39:22] from off of his hands and the angel said
[1:39:27] gird thyself and buy five sandals now
[1:39:34] listen to this God's in control he says
[1:39:38] put your shoes on and in danger is just
[1:39:42] waiting because God's not going to start
[1:39:45] a work
[1:39:46] and not finish it so the age already
[1:39:50] knows the outcome but Peter in his
[1:39:52] situation his father quickly put take
[1:39:55] you time make sure you put your sandals
[1:39:57] on in the guard or asleep there's not
[1:40:02] enough noise that could be made doesn't
[1:40:05] wake up the guard whine under the nose
[1:40:10] of the devil God knows how to bring you
[1:40:12] out of that situation
[1:40:16] Peter was put on his sandals dangerously
[1:40:19] tie your shoes make sure it's tied don't
[1:40:22] forget that one two and things like I'm
[1:40:25] late guys that men put your pants on put
[1:40:28] your pants on we're good we're fine
[1:40:30] that's what the Bible says throw your
[1:40:32] clothes put you put your clothes on
[1:40:36] God's in control I want you to I want
[1:40:38] that too kind of I'm kind of really
[1:40:41] resonate with you sometimes you're in
[1:40:43] panic mode
[1:40:44] but God is in control when you don't
[1:40:47] know how you gonna pay that bill
[1:40:49] take control when you don't know how
[1:40:52] you're gonna respond in that meeting God
[1:40:54] is in control
[1:40:57] you don't have it nor feel like the
[1:41:00] situation the brain God is in control
[1:41:06] they need to try Peter the dangerous
[1:41:09] repeater bind his shoes by non-violence
[1:41:14] I sandals you did cast I've garment
[1:41:18] about thee put your clothes on in an age
[1:41:22] of six of time you're ready starting to
[1:41:24] follow me dangers to say follow me he
[1:41:29] did it did it didn't know how he was
[1:41:30] going to get out but he had to trusting
[1:41:33] your messenger he had to trust the
[1:41:38] message the angel came with the message
[1:41:44] if you want to change to be broken if
[1:41:47] you want to get all of your situation
[1:41:51] no longer found in prison follows this
[1:41:53] ancient message this message will bring
[1:42:00] you out anywhere now to follow him and
[1:42:12] was not that it was true which was done
[1:42:15] by an angel but he saw a vision when
[1:42:18] they were past the first and the second
[1:42:23] so that went beyond the first four they
[1:42:29] were beyond the second Pole but it was
[1:42:32] that opening of the world on the third
[1:42:34] Pole that will be on a broad complete
[1:42:37] delivery he that has begun a good work
[1:42:43] in you will finish it he's a virgin
[1:42:47] they're not flaws in my life he's begun
[1:42:49] a good work in you
[1:42:50] dojin I got shortcomings in my life he's
[1:42:52] begun a good work in you brother Jean I
[1:42:54] just seem to struggle with this he's
[1:42:56] begun a good work in you he that has
[1:42:58] begun a good work in you will finish it
[1:43:08] Peter got out that's the best gist of it
[1:43:10] but God was in control so here Peter
[1:43:16] begins to look at the situation and he
[1:43:21] looks at he's keeping his eyes on Jesus
[1:43:24] and perhaps a little build out
[1:43:27] starts to raise up a little bit he
[1:43:31] starts looking like this and people
[1:43:34] often ask this question how is this even
[1:43:38] possible
[1:43:40] yeah we've asked that question
[1:43:44] how is this happening and rather than
[1:43:49] trusting God feels like I don't believe
[1:43:52] I'm doing this we gotta be careful the
[1:43:55] words we choose we may not verbalize it
[1:43:58] but God knows what you're thinking about
[1:44:00] and peers like does this even make sense
[1:44:07] the spirits as as Peters probably
[1:44:11] walking towards Jesus their spirit is
[1:44:13] probably whispering things into his head
[1:44:14] that word is kind of deep in it you
[1:44:19] don't know what kind of sharks in there
[1:44:22] gray White's
[1:44:24] stingrays you can't even see underneath
[1:44:27] that water and Peter was in the
[1:44:31] predicament he was too far away to go
[1:44:34] back but he still had a little race to
[1:44:39] go many of us are in that predicament
[1:44:45] that's how we get into trouble was there
[1:44:48] I can't choose to go back I can't go
[1:44:53] back but I know I got a long ways to go
[1:44:56] and he's right there in the middle he's
[1:45:01] trying to figure out what to do and it's
[1:45:05] that in its in that weak and vulnerable
[1:45:08] moment the devil begins to whisper
[1:45:11] things so next thing you know Peter
[1:45:16] started to slowly sink and he starts to
[1:45:22] get into deep water
[1:45:25] he's gurgling water he's flapping his
[1:45:29] hands and the Bible says he cries out
[1:45:32] Jesus save me
[1:45:36] [Music]
[1:45:39] Jesus save me now I don't know how to
[1:45:47] really put it into words but that
[1:45:49] statement didn't even make sense to me
[1:45:52] but I could understand why he what he
[1:45:55] what he yelled it out
[1:45:58] he's calling the very name of the person
[1:46:02] who told him come to me as if Jesus
[1:46:10] didn't know that he was in this
[1:46:13] situation you're never in a spot not
[1:46:21] only here you're never in a spot that
[1:46:23] clap doesn't know exactly the situation
[1:46:26] near Falken he won't let you go back but
[1:46:33] he's not gonna lose Weasley in the
[1:46:35] journey he won't let you go back even if
[1:46:42] you wanted to he will not let you go
[1:46:44] back when the children of these will
[1:46:47] cross the Red Sea and the worst part of
[1:46:50] the way and the whole health of Israel
[1:46:53] do you know what happened the lordís
[1:46:56] came back again it was impossible for
[1:46:59] them to go back they are to be shot even
[1:47:04] if he decided to go back to the Lord
[1:47:07] I'm like it'll make it possible for me
[1:47:10] to abuse you Oh trial you're gonna have
[1:47:18] persecutions you know difficulties but
[1:47:21] I'm not gonna need you I helped here was
[1:47:28] sinking in despair
[1:47:31] sinking and stress sinking he was
[1:47:35] thinking man I should have stayed that
[1:47:37] you bouncing shall have left the boat
[1:47:39] well my friends right no well my friends
[1:47:42] right
[1:47:42] [Music]
[1:47:44] I should have just stayed with my
[1:47:45] friends but here he was in the middle of
[1:47:53] the ocean the middle of the sea
[1:47:58] sinking crying out as if Jesus is not
[1:48:03] right there watching the situation but
[1:48:11] he who has begun a good work in you all
[1:48:14] things work together for the good you
[1:48:19] know what in no doubt his friends were
[1:48:22] probably watching him from a distance
[1:48:25] and they probably thinks to themselves
[1:48:27] man things don't look good for Peter ah
[1:48:31] but now they had their critics they had
[1:48:39] their sing they're like I won't say hi
[1:48:42] he's gonna come out of this sure Jesus
[1:48:44] can walk on water by himself but I don't
[1:48:46] know how to how on the hike acara Peter
[1:48:47] by himself
[1:48:48] you probably had all kinds of things to
[1:48:50] say and they were looking because they
[1:48:55] know so Peter knew he couldn't call on
[1:48:57] his friends they had no ability to
[1:49:04] welcome water as long as Peter was in
[1:49:09] the ship little boys
[1:49:11] but when he left to try to be holier
[1:49:13] than thou because he was listening to
[1:49:16] God's Word
[1:49:16] they're like he's on his own praise the
[1:49:22] Christian walk is a lonely sometimes but
[1:49:25] that's okay
[1:49:27] my faith is not resting upon somebody
[1:49:29] criticizing me we have taken the change
[1:49:32] of the body has nothing to do with your
[1:49:34] opinions God loving me has nothing to do
[1:49:36] with what you say about it that was
[1:49:39] already predetermined before the
[1:49:42] foundation of the world you may not like
[1:49:45] my smile but that's okay that's the way
[1:49:46] God made me you may not like the way I
[1:49:49] walk but that's okay that's the way God
[1:49:50] made me human I like the way I talk but
[1:49:53] that's okay that's why God made me you
[1:49:59] got we gotta start loving one another
[1:50:01] cuz if we can't get alone on this side
[1:50:04] of glory
[1:50:05] eternity is a long time hey God with
[1:50:09] this sense of humor he'll put you right
[1:50:10] next to a person that you don't like to
[1:50:12] see praise the Lord
[1:50:20] so you sign we go spear in the middle of
[1:50:24] the sea his friends couldn't help him
[1:50:28] out so he could only call to one source
[1:50:32] Jesus save me so Jesus comes in the
[1:50:39] middle of his drowning and he offers one
[1:50:44] hand not to because to God nothing is
[1:50:47] impossible it wasn't difficult appears
[1:50:52] right here just flapping his hands
[1:50:54] sinking under the water gurgling some
[1:50:56] water jumping up looking at me worded
[1:51:00] looking a mess and I forgot it's
[1:51:05] probably a sense of humors like man all
[1:51:07] you have to do is just keep your eye on
[1:51:08] me only one thing you have to do I
[1:51:13] didn't tell you to shout I didn't tell
[1:51:15] you though backflips
[1:51:17] just keep your eye on me
[1:51:18] but you start looking at your problems
[1:51:21] you start wondering about this to know
[1:51:23] that you got this letter that you got in
[1:51:25] the mail a conversation you had with
[1:51:27] your boss but you know I found the
[1:51:30] conversation I didn't go well you
[1:51:31] started looking at all these problems
[1:51:32] you take your eyes off of Christ and
[1:51:38] Peter just flapping flapping just
[1:51:40] looking a mess gurgling water he's
[1:51:43] thinking that this is his way he's gonna
[1:51:44] die God comes to us when we don't look
[1:51:48] our best not everybody comes to you when
[1:51:55] you look at when you don't look your
[1:51:56] best when you're giving water I saw this
[1:52:02] one little clip online one time this
[1:52:05] little this little this little boy he
[1:52:07] wasn't must've been like a toddlers I'm
[1:52:08] like he's flipping around like he's
[1:52:10] drawing me he's pleading for help mom
[1:52:14] comes across if I remember correctly
[1:52:16] they stand up he stood up water was like
[1:52:19] rancor to him he was kinda confused like
[1:52:22] well I thought that's just like God is
[1:52:27] God just like man get up so one hand and
[1:52:32] help the hell and help him up Peter
[1:52:34] stood up he's like trying to explain it
[1:52:37] just look at that Jesus cuz he thought
[1:52:42] he saw the end of his life that's how
[1:52:46] God works with you there's nothing too
[1:52:48] big for him if we just step back and say
[1:52:51] he's the one that created the heavens
[1:52:52] and the earth he created the galaxies he
[1:52:56] created all this thing the vast
[1:52:57] expansion of space and you need
[1:52:59] something he can't take care of your
[1:53:00] little problems so here's the beauty of
[1:53:05] it he takes Peter picks it off Peter's
[1:53:08] Peter probably had this relief look
[1:53:14] and his friends his friends so Peter
[1:53:20] come out of that situation because the
[1:53:25] same God who called Peter is the same
[1:53:27] guy that could break me out of that
[1:53:29] situation so even when it looks like
[1:53:32] you're filming in life God knows how to
[1:53:35] make his victorious in front of your
[1:53:37] enemies in front of your critics and for
[1:53:44] those who have something to say negative
[1:53:46] about you God knows how to bring you and
[1:53:49] have you stand upon your own two feet
[1:53:50] and Jesus took Peter by the probably by
[1:53:57] the shoulder and walked with them the
[1:54:02] rest of the way
[1:54:04] he says I'm with you I appreciate your
[1:54:08] faith we have a little bit of it but I'm
[1:54:11] with you and I'm gonna walk we see the
[1:54:15] rest of the way and the Bible says the
[1:54:17] wind ceased I'm closing the wind cease
[1:54:24] your trial the last forever your
[1:54:29] persecutions they'll endure forever the
[1:54:33] battles they don't last flavor one of
[1:54:36] these days some of these things are just
[1:54:38] gonna stop leave apprecia gospel fill in
[1:54:45] last time you're gonna honor your last
[1:54:47] prayer for one last time we're gonna
[1:54:55] fight this fight this one last time it
[1:55:00] doesn't it's not always gonna last this
[1:55:01] way and the Bible says and when they
[1:55:06] would come onto the ship the wind ceased
[1:55:12] then spirits went away Jesus called on
[1:55:17] to Peter and brought them back in and
[1:55:22] protected him
[1:55:23] and watched over him now take a moment
[1:55:27] and reflect on where you're at in your
[1:55:30] life's journey where you are up to the
[1:55:34] struggles that you are enduring you're
[1:55:39] probably similar between the ship and
[1:55:41] Jesus and you're probably you're
[1:55:46] probably sinking right now trying to
[1:55:49] understand how am I gonna take care of
[1:55:50] this
[1:55:51] I got Monday around the corner I got
[1:55:55] choose day I got this obligation this
[1:55:56] commitment I got this family problem I
[1:55:58] got this health issues I got this I got
[1:56:00] this I got this I got this God's not
[1:56:02] worried about out there you gotta act
[1:56:07] upon one word come that's the word you
[1:56:13] gotta act upon and take an action not
[1:56:18] just st. amen here but when you're out
[1:56:20] there and you're under a lot of
[1:56:24] criticism you'll know a lot of you know
[1:56:27] a lot of scrutiny you can still say Amen
[1:56:34] be faithful to this word be faithful to
[1:56:38] this message mr.zhou Stan he loved the
[1:56:43] Lord
[1:56:50] that's just by hearts Lord Jesus I
[1:57:07] appreciate the inspiration of the word
[1:57:11] the Lord I gave of my heart this morning
[1:57:17] father the God I'm just encouraged by
[1:57:20] your word of truth I know in life's
[1:57:24] journey dear God there's going to be
[1:57:28] obstacles along the way there's gonna be
[1:57:32] challenges that we must confront but the
[1:57:37] Lord if we could just keep our eyes
[1:57:39] fixated upon you father we know that you
[1:57:45] could break down every wall of partition
[1:57:47] I recall when Solomon built the temple
[1:57:52] and in his prayer he said that if your
[1:57:58] people just looked towards the temple
[1:58:01] that whenever they're in trouble you
[1:58:05] will come and bring them help and
[1:58:06] deliverance such was the case of Jonah
[1:58:11] do God when he was in the belly of the
[1:58:14] whale and in the midst of all that
[1:58:16] darkness and flesh all around him there
[1:58:20] was an internal compass that was built
[1:58:22] within him that the Bible talks about he
[1:58:25] faced he positioned himself facing the
[1:58:29] temple and then he begins to other pond
[1:58:33] the name of Jehovah the way we realized
[1:58:37] that that was a type of how important
[1:58:39] for us to remain focused upon the temple
[1:58:42] of your holy word that whenever we find
[1:58:45] ourselves in a predicament that they
[1:58:49] live we know your hand is never too
[1:58:52] short to reach us but that your grace is
[1:58:56] sufficient in our lives
[1:59:00] father the God I just play where my
[1:59:03] words may have fallen short may the
[1:59:05] message that you're trying to convey to
[1:59:07] your people resonate within their hearts
[1:59:09] to God help us do not look to our writer
[1:59:15] to our left but to maintain that course
[1:59:19] and keeping our eyes fixated upon that
[1:59:22] word it is this endtime word that has
[1:59:27] brought me that has called me that has
[1:59:32] pulled me out and father I know you
[1:59:37] wouldn't have brought me along this
[1:59:39] journey to just let me be but as you
[1:59:46] said to your disciples go to the other
[1:59:49] side
[1:59:50] I believe the Lord he were destined to
[1:59:56] meet up with them as it is noted in the
[2:00:00] scripture and even as they came across
[2:00:04] winds that were contrary in their lives
[2:00:06] you still came out to meet them that
[2:00:13] message holds true to us this morning
[2:00:15] a promise has been made as positive this
[2:00:20] mortal must put on immortality this
[2:00:26] corruptible must put on incorruption and
[2:00:31] father here we are some of us are in a
[2:00:34] state of mess but that didn't mean the
[2:00:38] Lord deter you from coming to us and as
[2:00:42] we're submerged under water and overhead
[2:00:46] trying to make sense of life's
[2:00:49] unanswered questions you've always
[2:00:53] extended your hands of grace towards us
[2:00:56] and with what seems to be of little
[2:00:58] effort
[2:00:59] the ability to pull us out of the
[2:01:02] problems that were in the gun we're
[2:01:05] never too deep when your grace can find
[2:01:08] us too dark of a situation where the
[2:01:13] light can shine upon us
[2:01:15] thank you for your grace and mercy the
[2:01:20] Lord as we approach another week watch
[2:01:24] us protect us a lot of faith to be made
[2:01:28] in just what is represented here in this
[2:01:30] church the latest technology looks the
[2:01:34] fired back into the workplaces into the
[2:01:37] schools into the community and let them
[2:01:40] see that there's a light that shines in
[2:01:42] a dark place that there's a son and a
[2:01:44] daughter of God that's represented that
[2:01:46] there's a life the tree was empty for me
[2:01:53] to declare that my Lord is alive and
[2:01:57] will be with us stay with us in Jesus
[2:02:04] Christ name I pray amen god bless you
[2:02:06] say
[2:02:08] [Applause]
[2:02:20] I'm gonna appreciate the word of the
[2:02:22] Lord on today you know as brother Jean
[2:02:30] was just kind of bringing that to the
[2:02:32] close when you look at the scripture and
[2:02:38] talked about how Peter was was sinking
[2:02:41] and how Jesus just reached out his hand
[2:02:43] and I lifted him up and leave verse 32
[2:02:48] says when they were come into the ship
[2:02:51] the wind ceased and what we don't get is
[2:02:57] whether Jesus carried him back to the
[2:03:02] ship or was it that and I just my
[2:03:06] imagination takes me to the place where
[2:03:08] all he did was just lift him up and when
[2:03:12] he lifts him up Peter just walked right
[2:03:14] along right back with Jesus so he was
[2:03:18] still walking on the water even after he
[2:03:21] failed see but you can walk as long as
[2:03:26] you got your eyes on Jesus and as long
[2:03:28] as you're walking with Jesus you can
[2:03:30] walk I tell you what I was just
[2:03:34] absolutely blessed a man by that and and
[2:03:37] amen
[2:03:38] [Applause]
[2:03:42] I know this I don't know what you know
[2:03:47] what any of us may be going through here
[2:03:49] today
[2:03:51] but I know that sometimes God has a way
[2:03:54] of speaking a man an indirect way to
[2:03:57] your direct situation right and there
[2:04:01] are some things that think God might be
[2:04:02] calling some of us to step out on faith
[2:04:05] if you um if you're gonna walk on water
[2:04:09] if then you got to get out the boat and
[2:04:12] I don't know what that might mean to you
[2:04:15] I don't know what your boat situation is
[2:04:17] but if you plan on walking on water
[2:04:19] you're gonna have to get out your boat
[2:04:21] and you're gonna have to take a step of
[2:04:23] faith and you know oftentimes we want to
[2:04:25] wait for the Lord to do something where
[2:04:26] actually God was waiting on people to do
[2:04:28] something and even when he was sinking
[2:04:33] even when he was sinking right he had
[2:04:36] the ability to call on the Lord and I
[2:04:38] love that that statement that brother
[2:04:39] Jean made that God knows how to make you
[2:04:42] look good and the mystery of enemies so
[2:04:47] even if you sink and everybody talking
[2:04:49] about you donít know where God got away
[2:04:50] just making you look good is that all
[2:04:54] the fellas that was in the boat my love
[2:04:56] he didn't call his brother Andrew was in
[2:04:57] the boat you know you know if you got
[2:05:01] you know older brother something like
[2:05:02] that you you come over help you know but
[2:05:05] no no he knew Andrew can do nothing for
[2:05:07] Jesus save me I tell you what I don't
[2:05:14] know I don't know what we face him but
[2:05:16] let's call him the Lord and let's watch
[2:05:18] him do it man what he does is it that
[2:05:21] God is that right let's sing
[2:05:26] [Music]
[2:05:35] [Music]

[2:14:13] earlier this month he he was at home and
[2:14:20] he went up to lay down and just take a
[2:14:22] little nap and his wife was on the phone
[2:14:24] with her mother and mother lives and
[2:14:27] ganas she was on the phone with her
[2:14:28] mother and and and somehow the son has
[2:14:30] slipped out of the house and went to the
[2:14:33] pool area of their home and he was
[2:14:35] actually draining the pool I think the
[2:14:37] pool only had about two feet of water in
[2:14:39] it and and somehow the son got into the
[2:14:43] pool and was drowning and in the two
[2:14:46] feet of order five years old and so the
[2:14:50] mother had hadn't recognized him and and
[2:14:52] she went looking for him and she found
[2:14:55] him there in the pool and and I believe
[2:14:58] the mother went into shock herself and
[2:15:00] she went on the phone that my son is
[2:15:03] dying
[2:15:04] and the phone dropped my cell her mom
[2:15:05] her and and the mother got in touch with
[2:15:11] buddy Maggie well said look we don't
[2:15:13] know what's going on but she said this
[2:15:15] and we don't know and he didn't know
[2:15:17] where she was so he went all around the
[2:15:19] neighborhood looking to try to find it
[2:15:21] and went into the garage confined her
[2:15:23] and finally to come back from the
[2:15:24] searching neighborhood he sent him to
[2:15:26] check the back yard and when he checked
[2:15:27] the back yard you saw both his wife and
[2:15:29] his mother I mean his wife and a son
[2:15:31] were in the pool a man and both of them
[2:15:35] both of them passed and so young man
[2:15:39] very young man to be going through
[2:15:42] something like that his name is brother
[2:15:44] Emanuel and if you all would just
[2:15:46] remember him and your prayers that God
[2:15:48] would just give him strength in order to
[2:15:51] make it through and persevere and then
[2:15:53] through the season of his life I greatly
[2:15:55] appreciated
[2:15:57] my god is too wise to make mistakes we
[2:16:00] know he has something big that's gonna
[2:16:02] come out at least it may be some life
[2:16:04] will be touched some kind of way through
[2:16:06] the midst of it and just please keep him
[2:16:09] in prayer that God would just give him
[2:16:10] strength to keep question the key person
