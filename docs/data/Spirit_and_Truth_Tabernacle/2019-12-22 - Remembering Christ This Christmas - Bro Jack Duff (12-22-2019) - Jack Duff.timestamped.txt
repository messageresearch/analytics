[58:52] the song I just couldn't couldn't get
[58:53] the thought and the Lord just put
[58:55] something in her heart and she comes
[58:57] something it was a blessing to us and I
[58:59] was just saying you know I want to have
[59:02] a Christmas thought and I just you know
[59:04] Lord just didn't give it to me like that
[59:06] and hey man we just gonna go what it
[59:08] gave me a he just put a few things in my
[59:10] heart and and some things that pertain
[59:13] to Christmas and some things that don't
[59:15] amen but there was a quote that
[59:17] brother branham say everyday should have
[59:19] been Christmas everything a man coz
[59:23] christmas is a time of worship right
[59:26] even a man Christmas is worship a man so
[59:31] we're gonna we're gonna talk a little
[59:32] bit about that but we just trust that
[59:34] the Lord would just help us a man today
[59:36] I want to read a man familiar passage
[59:39] for this time of year let's go to
[59:41] Matthew chapter 2 and let's read from
[59:44] there my man Matthew chapter 2 and man
[59:48] praise the Lord
[59:51] glory to God Matthew chapter 2 and a few
[59:55] verses and just the first 12 verses I
[1:00:02] believe here says now when Jesus was
[1:00:06] born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days
[1:00:11] of Herod the King behold there came wise
[1:00:13] men from the east to Jerusalem saying
[1:00:19] where is he that is born King of the
[1:00:21] Jews for we have seen his star in the
[1:00:25] east and I've come to worship him when
[1:00:30] Herod the King had heard these things he
[1:00:33] was troubled and all Jerusalem with him
[1:00:37] and when he had gathered all the chief
[1:00:40] priests and scribes of the people
[1:00:43] together he demanded of them where
[1:00:46] Christ should be born and they said unto
[1:00:51] Him in Bethlehem of Judea for thus it is
[1:00:54] written by the prophet and thou
[1:00:58] bethlehem in the land of judah are not
[1:01:02] the least among the princes of Judah for
[1:01:07] out of thee shall come a governor that
[1:01:09] shall rule my people Israel then Herod
[1:01:12] when he had privily called the wise man
[1:01:14] inquired of them diligently what time
[1:01:17] the star appeared and he sent them to
[1:01:22] Bethlehem and said go
[1:01:26] and search diligently for the young
[1:01:29] child and when ye have found him bring
[1:01:32] me word again that my that I may come
[1:01:35] and worship Him also when they had heard
[1:01:39] the King they departed and lo the star
[1:01:42] which they saw and the East went before
[1:01:46] them till it came and stood over where
[1:01:49] the young child was when they saw the
[1:01:53] star they rejoiced with exceeding great
[1:01:57] joy and when they were come into the
[1:02:00] house they saw the young child with Mary
[1:02:04] his mother and fell down and worshiped
[1:02:07] him and when they had opened their
[1:02:09] treasures they presented unto Him gifts
[1:02:12] gold and frankincense and myrrh and
[1:02:15] being warned of God and a dream that
[1:02:17] they should not return to Herod they
[1:02:19] departed into their own country another
[1:02:22] way amen the Lord had a blessing to the
[1:02:25] reading of his word let's just pray over
[1:02:28] what we've read god we thank you for
[1:02:31] what we've read here in the scripture
[1:02:34] and Lord certainly we are grateful to be
[1:02:37] able to come into the house and Lord
[1:02:39] today to bring our worship and our Isha
[1:02:42] to you and father we just pray that as
[1:02:44] we would just embark upon a little
[1:02:47] thought that you got would just get the
[1:02:49] glory and the honor out of the things
[1:02:51] that we would share and help us Lord
[1:02:54] just to receive what heaven has for us
[1:02:57] on this day we take every spirit that's
[1:03:00] against the Spirit of God underneath the
[1:03:01] control of the Holy Spirit even right
[1:03:03] now in Jesus name we pray amen amen god
[1:03:07] bless you can be seated a man just a
[1:03:12] little little thought that we'll share
[1:03:15] today just remembering Christ this
[1:03:17] Christmas a man we're just remembering
[1:03:19] Christ this Christmas and before I go
[1:03:22] further I do want to also thank God for
[1:03:26] brother Jerry on Friday night
[1:03:34] and then just a beautiful thought on you
[1:03:37] are God's radiance amen you are God's
[1:03:42] radiance and just just really really
[1:03:45] appreciated that just he brought a a
[1:03:49] quote that I don't think I'm sure I
[1:03:51] heard it but just never looked at it you
[1:03:53] know that way and and and it just bless
[1:03:56] me and I pray that maybe today will get
[1:03:58] a chance to bring it back around and a
[1:04:00] man and just pick it up I want to just
[1:04:03] talk about remembering Christ amen this
[1:04:06] Christmas now I'm gonna say something
[1:04:09] but let's just read this first quote
[1:04:11] Matt and I now the Christmas is about
[1:04:14] it's well it's supposed to be about
[1:04:17] Jesus supposed to be by Jesus but we
[1:04:21] realized a man if you didn't know this
[1:04:25] I'll be the first to tell you that Jesus
[1:04:28] was not born on December 25th a man of
[1:04:33] our Lord and Savior was not born on
[1:04:37] December 25th
[1:04:39] hallelujah a man Jesus was born in the
[1:04:43] springtime being the Lamb of God amen
[1:04:47] all our lambs and things like that they
[1:04:50] come forth in spring so Jesus was born
[1:04:53] probably somewhere around April a man
[1:04:56] and so so we you know just just keep
[1:04:59] that in mind we got to tell the truth
[1:05:01] about it because we don't want our
[1:05:03] children to a man equate Jesus to Santa
[1:05:09] is that Alright a man
[1:05:12] Santa is a myth but Jesus is real all
[1:05:17] right
[1:05:17] hallelujah glory to God and
[1:05:20] unfortunately you know we we were quick
[1:05:24] to take our children and put them on the
[1:05:28] lap of a stranger
[1:05:32] take your picture - its Sam time and we
[1:05:35] we got all this kind of stuff that we
[1:05:37] pushing the kids out there to do but how
[1:05:39] quickly we to bring the kids to church
[1:05:41] [Music]
[1:05:42] all right and and and and and to
[1:05:45] introduce them to what this really is
[1:05:47] all about right this you know the one
[1:05:50] thing I can say about Christmas is that
[1:05:53] it forces everybody to stop and think
[1:05:56] about what this is hallelujah so I do
[1:06:00] appreciate that
[1:06:01] amen but but but but with truth be known
[1:06:04] amen truth be known Christmas or
[1:06:07] December 25th is not the birthday of our
[1:06:10] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ all right
[1:06:12] let me just read something for you now I
[1:06:14] don't when I read this it meant I'm not
[1:06:17] gonna apologize for it but a man I just
[1:06:20] I just want this I want this to settle
[1:06:22] in your spirit okay this is from the
[1:06:24] patmans vision day man we want to
[1:06:27] remember Christ's a man of this
[1:06:30] Christmas the Prophet makes a statement
[1:06:32] says so Paul was picked up and got into
[1:06:37] that spirit of Sabbath and was
[1:06:40] transmitted by the Holy Ghost all the
[1:06:42] way over into the day of the Lord why we
[1:06:47] got Wars
[1:06:48] we got we why we got troubles why is
[1:06:51] nation against nation Jesus come the
[1:06:55] Prince of life and they killed him in a
[1:06:59] few weeks or even right now there's
[1:07:01] reindeers and Santa Clauses and jingle
[1:07:04] bells and all kinds of things hanging up
[1:07:07] which is pagan ceremony all right it
[1:07:11] says it's an article of the Catholic
[1:07:13] Church hallelujah people paying great
[1:07:18] prices hallelujah Amen people paying
[1:07:26] great prices and swapping presents and
[1:07:29] things like that
[1:07:31] pagan I just wanted to leave that in
[1:07:35] everybody laughs Christmas is a take of
[1:07:38] workshop amen
[1:07:42] hallelujah this bunch of prophets say it
[1:07:44] right they say they've been great prices
[1:07:47] swapping presses and you know what that
[1:07:50] is it's bacon Oh glory to God
[1:07:53] hey man I'm not gonna take your presents
[1:07:56] from you amen IIIi want you to enjoy
[1:07:59] yourself but but what I want to do is I
[1:08:01] want us to remember Christ amen because
[1:08:04] it's so easy to get wrapped up and
[1:08:06] caught up in this season hallelujah
[1:08:10] glory to God we amen we're not supposed
[1:08:13] to go in debt around this time of year
[1:08:15] that's not the will of God Jesus was not
[1:08:18] born for you to go in dead hello
[1:08:25] somebody that was not the purpose of the
[1:08:28] purse it's for you - amen to get
[1:08:31] swallowed up and dance MAME answers
[1:08:34] right now I'm not I mean the Prophet did
[1:08:37] receive gifts people bought suits for
[1:08:39] the Prophet and his wife but my Bible
[1:08:41] and all kind of things like that so we
[1:08:43] understand that we want to keep a
[1:08:45] balance in these things but but
[1:08:46] understand now if we if we if we don't
[1:08:49] strike the balance work in the father
[1:08:51] and all the pagan traditions come on
[1:08:55] church they may we'll follow a lot of
[1:08:58] bigoted racist conditions and we don't
[1:09:01] want to do that we're Christians
[1:09:02] hey man we're Christians so you know
[1:09:05] there's a statement that the Prophet
[1:09:06] made here he says Christmas is not
[1:09:11] mentioned in the entire Bible right
[1:09:14] never one time did Jesus refer them to
[1:09:19] his birth
[1:09:20] oh my but to his death Jesus didn't
[1:09:25] refer back to his birth he referred to
[1:09:27] his death hallelujah amen he said
[1:09:31] Christmas is a worship and he said I see
[1:09:34] the sign not long ago said put Christ
[1:09:36] back in to Christmas we want to remember
[1:09:41] Christ amen at at Christmas let me go on
[1:09:44] a little further here I want to read
[1:09:46] from this sermon when their eyes were
[1:09:48] open they knew him amen when they're
[1:09:50] high
[1:09:51] were open they knew him and I want to I
[1:09:54] gotta try to bring us a man of look look
[1:09:56] look look forward it's unfortunate that
[1:09:59] most of the world when they when they
[1:10:02] get to this time of year they think they
[1:10:04] they they bring out all of their all
[1:10:08] their stuff and they put it all over the
[1:10:10] place and you know which is fine they
[1:10:12] got the they got the scene of the manger
[1:10:14] in their yard and and and they got the
[1:10:16] wise men there which is not accurate if
[1:10:20] I can just tell you all that truth the
[1:10:22] scripture that I just read amen the wise
[1:10:25] men were not there at the time of his
[1:10:27] birth the wise men came years later if
[1:10:30] you if you if you if you just followed
[1:10:33] me in the scripture amen the wise men
[1:10:35] found him in the house not at the manger
[1:10:39] there were separates that came to a
[1:10:41] manger and even that was a man was four
[1:10:45] tamed of God he knew Herod would go to a
[1:10:48] manger right he knew he knew there was
[1:10:51] others that would go to a manger but
[1:10:53] since a shepherd is identified with
[1:10:55] things like that God could speak to
[1:10:57] shepherds they were humble people they
[1:11:00] were simple people that God could speak
[1:11:02] to when he announced his birth he went
[1:11:05] to simple people amen and when God is
[1:11:08] announcing things that he is doing today
[1:11:11] he is going to simple people praise God
[1:11:17] it's gonna take simple people to catch
[1:11:20] the revelation the Bible says that he
[1:11:22] has eat these things from the wise and
[1:11:26] the prudent and has revealed them unto
[1:11:29] babes such as would learn I want to say
[1:11:36] that many people have him past tense
[1:11:39] they have them past tense and in this
[1:11:43] morning they're even preaching of Jesus
[1:11:45] that's past tense Oh hallelujah and if I
[1:11:50] could just borrow the words of Paul
[1:11:52] they're preaching another Jesus
[1:11:58] hallelujah hey manna and this just
[1:12:01] coming in my spirit because I don't want
[1:12:03] to preach to you another Jesus I don't
[1:12:06] want to just talk about the Jesus that
[1:12:08] was in the manger he did he himself did
[1:12:11] not refer to his birth he referred to
[1:12:14] his death brother that's with many
[1:12:17] things that have happened since our Lord
[1:12:20] and Savior has come Oh glory to God let
[1:12:25] me just read a little bit here if I can
[1:12:27] I'm gonna try a man a man when their
[1:12:30] eyes were open they knew him hey and we
[1:12:33] need our eyes open today says would you
[1:12:36] like to take well would you like to took
[1:12:41] a trip with clear Cleopas and them on
[1:12:44] the road to emmaus I'd like to walk with
[1:12:48] them and it's possible I'm glad to be
[1:12:52] living today that I can still do the
[1:12:55] same thing walk with him today just the
[1:12:58] same as they did them saying the thought
[1:13:02] of it how how that Jesus has raised up
[1:13:05] from the dead but the sad part of it was
[1:13:09] slowing him who loved him didn't know it
[1:13:12] so he raised from the dead but sermon
[1:13:15] him that loved him didn't know it and he
[1:13:19] says and that's certainly a picture of
[1:13:22] today oh excuse me one second this keeps
[1:13:29] me on task so y'all just I've been on
[1:13:33] preached for three hours and then didn't
[1:13:36] realized so just let me let me get that
[1:13:37] it says so it says and that's certainly
[1:13:42] a picture of today there is many people
[1:13:46] who love Him who doesn't read doesn't
[1:13:48] yet realize that he's alive they love
[1:13:55] them they they think they put the the
[1:13:57] manger scene out amen they they they
[1:14:00] baby
[1:14:01] they are they that maybe they read the
[1:14:03] scriptures so about him but they don't
[1:14:05] realize that he's alive
[1:14:07] listen this is not something to be
[1:14:09] celebrated just one day a year glory to
[1:14:13] God
[1:14:14] that's why the prophets and a word
[1:14:16] Christmas is a worship and it should be
[1:14:18] something actually he said being that it
[1:14:21] is a worship it's actually not a
[1:14:23] celebration a May it's a worship now to
[1:14:27] celebrate he say you celebrate Lincoln's
[1:14:30] birthday he say you celebrate George
[1:14:32] Washington's birthday he made him
[1:14:35] celebrate the things that Martin Luther
[1:14:36] King made you can celebrate all that but
[1:14:39] when they come to Christ not a
[1:14:41] celebration worship Oh glory to God when
[1:14:47] those wise men showed up
[1:14:49] brother they weren't coming a man to
[1:14:51] play games they came to worship where is
[1:14:55] he King of the Jews where is he that can
[1:14:59] change my life where is he that to
[1:15:01] redeem me where is he that can save me
[1:15:04] where is he that can change me where is
[1:15:08] he and when you find them you know
[1:15:12] worship Him praise God Church glory
[1:15:19] hallelujah amen no they wanted to know
[1:15:23] where he loves it was it was it was it
[1:15:26] was you know so supernatural the way God
[1:15:29] did things
[1:15:30] Amen at that time it was so supernatural
[1:15:32] what God did and we will get him telling
[1:15:35] a little bit but let me let me say the
[1:15:37] course many people don't realize that
[1:15:39] he's still alive the preaching are
[1:15:42] talking about of Jesus amen that was in
[1:15:45] a manger but he's not there anymore
[1:15:48] he's not there anymore hallelujah that
[1:15:51] was that that I can't say that was the
[1:15:54] beginning of the story that was just
[1:15:55] part of the story and the story went all
[1:15:59] the way back in God's mind and things
[1:16:01] got things got started in heaven
[1:16:03] came down to the earth hallelujah Oh
[1:16:06] glory to God and this is why I said
[1:16:09] worship because we were so disconnected
[1:16:12] Adam sold us out in the Garden of Eden
[1:16:15] when theme came into the world through
[1:16:18] Adam and Eve and I'm not through not
[1:16:21] through I want to say Adam asar when
[1:16:23] they sold us out because Adam willfully
[1:16:26] did what he did Eve was deceived but I
[1:16:30] don't wilfully did what he did and he
[1:16:32] sold us out and what with what Adam did
[1:16:35] it required now a kid's me redeemer to
[1:16:38] come and bring us back into fellowship
[1:16:41] with Almighty God I got good news for
[1:16:44] you to team God did not just him his son
[1:16:48] God became the son and they came less
[1:16:54] not just to be born but to die and pay
[1:16:58] the penalty of sin that's why he didn't
[1:17:02] refer back to his birth it wasn't about
[1:17:04] that I had to be bored so I could die
[1:17:09] well if he hadn't come we wouldn't be
[1:17:12] able to come to church today if he
[1:17:14] hadn't done what he done we wouldn't be
[1:17:16] able to sit here and worship today right
[1:17:19] that's why we have to remember Christ
[1:17:21] hallelujah let me go on a little further
[1:17:25] here say there's certain people it's a
[1:17:27] certain certainly a picture of today
[1:17:29] there is many people who loves him who
[1:17:32] doesn't yet realized that he's alive
[1:17:34] that is some kind of a history that they
[1:17:38] have learned in some school it's come in
[1:17:41] some book of theology some ethics code
[1:17:44] of ethics that they studied somewhere
[1:17:47] and Jesus is a historical figure to them
[1:17:52] hallelujah amen I don't want him to be a
[1:17:55] historical figure to me no he the same
[1:17:59] yesterday today and forever
[1:18:02] we got to know he's still alive he's
[1:18:06] he's alive and well hallelujah doing
[1:18:10] what he always did here in this this
[1:18:13] this year we get ready to go to a new
[1:18:15] year Jesus is still alive glory amen
[1:18:21] yet in history it says and yet in the
[1:18:24] history they love him and don't realize
[1:18:28] that he's alive with us walking right
[1:18:30] around with us just as he always did he
[1:18:34] is here just the same as he ever was you
[1:18:37] know and as I read that quote it just
[1:18:40] kind of struck my heart people loved the
[1:18:42] story of Jesus but they don't love Jesus
[1:18:49] are you just like hearing the story and
[1:18:53] we can tell you the story but but that
[1:18:55] story was told in order to make an
[1:18:57] impact
[1:18:58] oh you Oh hallelujah oh you see those
[1:19:03] even the song that was chosen he could
[1:19:05] have let me drown but instead he took me
[1:19:07] here right he came to make a difference
[1:19:10] in your life the Bible Amen when it was
[1:19:13] announced that he was coming say he's
[1:19:15] gonna save his people from their sin Oh
[1:19:21] aricept so there's a statement in there
[1:19:23] he's gonna save his people from their
[1:19:27] sin can I just put a plane everybody not
[1:19:30] his people no he's coming to save his
[1:19:37] people from their sin even the Jews of
[1:19:41] that day y'all with me even the Jews of
[1:19:46] that day would not have been considered
[1:19:47] his people hallelujah you know Jesus was
[1:19:51] not a Jew Jesus was not a Jimtown Jesus
[1:19:57] was God so his people we can put it this
[1:20:03] way he came to save his predestinated
[1:20:06] people from their sins I'm so glad I can
[1:20:11] see I'm one of them when we remember
[1:20:14] Christ at this Christmas what we
[1:20:18] remembers that God some 2000 years ago
[1:20:22] gave birth to himself God came and took
[1:20:27] on the form of a man so that he could
[1:20:29] die for our sins sometimes it's good for
[1:20:34] you to just kind of go back and remember
[1:20:35] where you were if God had not come into
[1:20:38] your life hallelujah amen let's not read
[1:20:42] a little further in this this quote when
[1:20:44] their eyes were open they knew him he
[1:20:45] says now the reason they why didn't they
[1:20:49] believe it
[1:20:54] that statement just strikes me it
[1:20:58] strikes me this message that we have a
[1:21:02] soap
[1:21:03] freshest but uh in and all of it you got
[1:21:07] so many people that just won't believe
[1:21:08] it
[1:21:09] just just won't believe it they didn't
[1:21:12] believe Christ's birth they came up with
[1:21:15] well they're all kind of names are
[1:21:17] called Mary oh I just didn't let me just
[1:21:21] stay here for a little bit they they
[1:21:23] came up you know with you know what kind
[1:21:26] of woman are you you you are engaged to
[1:21:33] this man to be married and you turn up
[1:21:35] pregnant what kind of woman are you Mary
[1:21:39] I'm you can just imagine the criticism
[1:21:43] that she was going through the Bible
[1:21:45] even tells us that you know Joseph
[1:21:48] didn't really want to be associated with
[1:21:50] Mary
[1:21:51] a man with a testimony like that do you
[1:21:54] realize it took a supernatural car to
[1:21:58] count them to Joseph to sell his spirit
[1:22:01] if God would not have showed up through
[1:22:04] an angel in a dream to Joseph Sultan
[1:22:09] would have would have put Mary away amen
[1:22:13] by God using a supernatural experience
[1:22:17] with Joseph then Joseph could identify
[1:22:21] with the supernatural experience of Mary
[1:22:24] Mary had a testimony that she had been
[1:22:27] visited by an angel
[1:22:30] hallelujah somebody can you imagine
[1:22:32] going around and telling that testimony
[1:22:35] to people that I was visited by Gabriel
[1:22:38] and he told me that I was gonna have a
[1:22:39] child
[1:22:41] hallelujah church amen Mary had to walk
[1:22:45] by faith Mary had to stand against all
[1:22:48] the criticism
[1:22:50] Arrieta amen go against popular opinion
[1:22:54] mary had to endure whatever was gonna be
[1:22:57] thrown her way come on church hallelujah
[1:23:03] God needs some omaree's like that people
[1:23:06] that are willing to go through the
[1:23:07] criticism people that don't mind being a
[1:23:10] man being ostracized because you believe
[1:23:13] a message hallelujah people that don't
[1:23:18] lie being told that they crazy Oh God
[1:23:23] need some omaree's praise God leave
[1:23:29] without a willing to stand with the word
[1:23:32] Oh Mary had was a couple of scriptures
[1:23:36] but then scriptures was a lot to keep up
[1:23:39] [Applause]
[1:23:46] her experience had to match the
[1:23:49] scripture can we just go back a little
[1:23:52] bit I'm like i'ma get to this in the
[1:23:54] same but brother Branham gives us a man
[1:23:57] some some so he gives us information
[1:24:01] that we probably wouldn't get just by
[1:24:04] reading our Bibles oh I said a mouthful
[1:24:09] there brother Branham gives us some
[1:24:14] insight things that we win catch if we
[1:24:19] were just reading our Bibles myself
[1:24:22] hallelujah imma give you a couple of
[1:24:25] things I'm gonna try I'm trying my best
[1:24:27] to keep my thoughts together here but
[1:24:29] but you know one of the insights that
[1:24:32] the Prophet gave us is you know it
[1:24:34] wasn't only the wise men that sort of
[1:24:37] stuff you know one of the insights
[1:24:40] brother brayla brought he and he as he's
[1:24:43] preaching it and you know for me
[1:24:45] sometimes you don't know in the prophets
[1:24:47] intervention and preaching his vision do
[1:24:50] not even sure about that he might be
[1:24:52] preaching what he's seen brother
[1:24:54] branham's
[1:24:54] Oh Eve in the garden it could tell us
[1:24:57] what she looked like
[1:25:01] it's today's that it's that too I mean
[1:25:04] too hard for people to see how could
[1:25:06] Moses even write about the garden anyone
[1:25:09] even there see God gives a prophet
[1:25:14] insight that he doesn't give other
[1:25:16] people so brother Branham said that has
[1:25:19] Mary and Joseph for coming into the city
[1:25:22] Mary and Joseph saw this time not only
[1:25:28] did the wise men see the star but Mary
[1:25:30] and Joseph saw the stop what I'm trying
[1:25:33] to get you to see is a man there would
[1:25:35] be multiple people that'll be able to
[1:25:37] see the supernatural and they'll be able
[1:25:41] to identify and I might as well say this
[1:25:43] way because you have seen a star
[1:25:47] [Applause]
[1:25:49] because you can identify with the seven
[1:25:53] church age messenger which was a star in
[1:25:56] the hand of Jesus you have come to
[1:26:01] worship Him
[1:26:03] [Music]
[1:26:06] that's why a man that's why these
[1:26:10] brothers can come from Honduras and not
[1:26:13] just look for any church I'm not just
[1:26:17] looking for any church language I can
[1:26:24] identify with the spirit please God we
[1:26:30] have seen his star and we come to
[1:26:34] worship glory to God
[1:26:44] you know how easy it would be to just go
[1:26:47] to just go to a church right down the
[1:26:51] hall they they speak my language but I'm
[1:26:54] not here because you speak my language
[1:26:58] I'm here because you speak a higher
[1:27:01] language then my language you speak a
[1:27:06] heavenly language Oh glory to God glory
[1:27:13] to God glory to God so wasn't Jess you
[1:27:19] know the wise men sought but even even
[1:27:21] though Mary Joseph they sort of stopped
[1:27:23] said brother brain and say you know he
[1:27:25] was just kind of giving it a picture he
[1:27:27] said he just looked at say the mayor say
[1:27:29] Joseph do you see the star you see that
[1:27:32] sighs it's so I mean it's so different
[1:27:34] so unusual you see that stuff and and
[1:27:38] she just having conversation she makes
[1:27:40] her brother man saying maybe he can just
[1:27:42] hear say something like you know I'm so
[1:27:44] glad that he chose me he chose he chose
[1:27:47] my wool to conceal himself in and then
[1:27:53] reveal himself can I tell you something
[1:27:56] you all are like Mary
[1:27:58] he chose your spiritual wound to conceal
[1:28:02] himself and we are entering a season
[1:28:07] where he will also reveal himself
[1:28:14] now now now be careful because in the
[1:28:18] season where the revelation is coming
[1:28:20] forth that's also a season of
[1:28:23] persecution can I put it it's a season
[1:28:28] of great trial it's a season of great
[1:28:31] distress and the same
[1:28:33] time that he's manifesting himself you
[1:28:36] go through great trials and tribulations
[1:28:39] now we're not gonna run from this we're
[1:28:43] gonna accept everything God got for us
[1:28:44] but we understand this right let me go
[1:28:47] on a little further here you know we
[1:28:49] thank God for a prophet that gives us
[1:28:51] gives us this and you know these now
[1:28:54] nowadays people just don't have the
[1:28:55] complete picture but we want it we want
[1:28:58] to keep Christ we want to remember him
[1:29:00] a man at this at this season a man look
[1:29:03] at look at this and when their eyes were
[1:29:05] open they knew him lord help us Oh help
[1:29:08] our eyes to be open so we'll know you
[1:29:10] got look at this says now they the
[1:29:15] reason why they why didn't they believe
[1:29:19] it it's because the resurrection was too
[1:29:23] unusual the resurrection was too unusual
[1:29:35] that hadn't happened before since so it
[1:29:40] was an unusual thing for them to believe
[1:29:43] something like that we ain't nothing
[1:29:45] like this ever happened before it talked
[1:29:47] about the resurrection but also you know
[1:29:49] he goes on says and the unusualness is
[1:29:54] where God lays I'll stay with that
[1:29:58] church they are usual nests you know
[1:30:02] just because the crowd going with it
[1:30:05] don't mean God is with it and then the
[1:30:09] unusualness is where God God lays he
[1:30:14] says see Christ's birth was unusual if I
[1:30:20] could also just add the word incredible
[1:30:23] Christ's birth was incredible I mean I
[1:30:27] need prosthetists call timeout at this
[1:30:32] season it just reflect on what happened
[1:30:35] a virgin conceived and bore chopped
[1:30:43] now now now now in my mind if there was
[1:30:47] anything impossible that was absolutely
[1:30:51] impossible a virgin first of all cannot
[1:30:55] conceive virgin can do that right
[1:30:59] remember in this particular situation
[1:31:02] for us to be called Christians we have
[1:31:05] to believe the fact that a virgin can
[1:31:10] see can I go a little further
[1:31:12] you came even scientifically prove that
[1:31:17] I'm going somewhere with that you can't
[1:31:20] even scientifically prove that but yet
[1:31:23] you have to believe that that shows you
[1:31:27] that your faith in Christ is not built
[1:31:30] on scientific proof hallelujah faith is
[1:31:35] built on a simple belief that if God
[1:31:38] said it I will not question God's a God
[1:31:46] that can create the universe a God that
[1:31:49] can create the heavens in the earth God
[1:31:52] that can do whatever he wanted to
[1:31:54] I will not question him I got a I'm
[1:32:00] trying to just get into some things if I
[1:32:03] can but it was unusual it was unusual
[1:32:06] and for us to you know for us to place
[1:32:09] our faith
[1:32:10] amen on Mary story Mary's testimony not
[1:32:16] only the marriage testimony but you know
[1:32:18] we see Christ didn't come but but we
[1:32:21] also can see in Scripture why Mary why
[1:32:24] Mary based stuff faith somewhere she
[1:32:26] based her faith will will read that in a
[1:32:28] second let me finish this says that God
[1:32:33] is always unusual he does unusual things
[1:32:36] but it's always accordance his work
[1:32:37] I love this statement God is always
[1:32:40] unusual he does things unusual he does
[1:32:45] unusual things but as always according
[1:32:47] to his word my god ain't doing things
[1:32:49] outside of what the scripture promised a
[1:32:51] man listen he says he never
[1:32:56] does nothing outside of his word so
[1:32:59] unusual because he promised it
[1:33:02] he promises it first and then said
[1:33:06] somebody to manifest that word to make
[1:33:08] it real to the people now you hear he
[1:33:11] promises at first see he tells you that
[1:33:13] this is what I'm gonna do he touch
[1:33:19] exactly what he's gonna do and then it's
[1:33:22] up to you to catch it by Scripture and
[1:33:24] then once you catch it by Scripture you
[1:33:27] know that what God said was absolutely
[1:33:29] right
[1:33:30] Oh hallelujah stay with you stay with me
[1:33:32] stay with me amen he says when you
[1:33:34] better counsel people first receive the
[1:33:36] baptism the Holy Ghost that was an
[1:33:38] unusual thing but yet God promised it
[1:33:41] pour it out in the last days in here it
[1:33:44] was so no matter how unusual it was it
[1:33:48] was a promise of God that had to be made
[1:33:51] manifest because God promised it I like
[1:33:54] this I like this the promise a man was
[1:33:59] found for Mary for her - for her to hear
[1:34:04] the angel Gabriel come and say you know
[1:34:06] you're gonna have a son and you're gonna
[1:34:08] call his name Jesus you know and he's
[1:34:10] gonna save his people from their sins
[1:34:12] and you know and and say you know Mary
[1:34:14] Mary caught this this visit and she even
[1:34:17] had questions say how could this be I
[1:34:20] don't even know a man how could this be
[1:34:24] she was she had a good testimony I've
[1:34:26] never even known a man how can this be
[1:34:28] just say he say the Holy Spirit got over
[1:34:30] shouted you he said and you know what
[1:34:33] Mary said back to back to Gabriel which
[1:34:35] is the same thing that we need to say be
[1:34:37] it unto me according to your word not
[1:34:43] not even according to my doubt not
[1:34:46] according to anything that I say cuz
[1:34:48] sometimes I say the wrong things but be
[1:34:50] it unto me according to your word and do
[1:34:54] you know right there when she accepted
[1:34:56] the word
[1:34:57] Concepcion took place well Larry with
[1:35:02] this experience before Jesus even start
[1:35:06] kicking in the womb went to testify of
[1:35:09] what God had already done for her told
[1:35:11] Joseph told Elizabeth hallelujah you all
[1:35:15] know the store when she totally Lizabeth
[1:35:17] John had been dead in his mother's womb
[1:35:19] for for six months but as soon as soon
[1:35:23] as soon as Mary Cameron said I'm gonna
[1:35:25] have a child and his name will be Jesus
[1:35:28] as soon as she said her name Jesus child
[1:35:32] begins to leap in the womb and even the
[1:35:36] Bible say that John was filled with the
[1:35:38] Holy Ghost I wish that's all we had to
[1:35:44] do is come in here and say Jesus and
[1:35:47] everybody would be filled with the Holy
[1:35:49] Ghost
[1:35:50] please God I wish it was that like that
[1:35:53] to take Jesus in lives a change Jesus
[1:36:00] and situations are changed Jets a Jesus
[1:36:04] Oh glory to God
[1:36:08] I'm tired of fighting this thing Jesus
[1:36:12] tired of going through this series us
[1:36:16] [Applause]
[1:36:19] glory to God
[1:36:21] relevant our God became man things begin
[1:36:25] to change
[1:36:26] Oh hallelujah Mary only had a couple
[1:36:33] things after this experience she had to
[1:36:35] be able to take it back to the word or
[1:36:37] she only had a couple things that she
[1:36:38] could depend on just a couple her faith
[1:36:41] was in what was already written in the
[1:36:44] word and can I just a man bring it a
[1:36:46] little forward today your faith has got
[1:36:48] to be in what is already written in the
[1:36:51] word Mary could look at genesis 3:15 the
[1:36:58] Bible says and I will put enmity between
[1:37:00] thee and the woman and between thy seed
[1:37:04] and her seed it shall bruise thy head
[1:37:08] and thou shalt bruise his heel
[1:37:10] we know amen just according to amen the
[1:37:15] way to bond a woman's body's designer a
[1:37:17] woman does not remember to see that's
[1:37:20] the main that produces that and then she
[1:37:23] has her act hallelujah amen but by here
[1:37:26] the Bible says her seed so this was a
[1:37:30] promise from Genesis that there would be
[1:37:33] a virgin that would conceive that's all
[1:37:37] Mary had to hold on to alone with
[1:37:39] another prophecy here let's read this
[1:37:40] side I said seven and fourteen all glory
[1:37:44] to God hallelujah hallelujah now God
[1:37:48] didn't change the prophecy he just gave
[1:37:50] a little bit more information for when
[1:37:53] we go forward and I'm saying seven
[1:37:54] fourteen it says therefore the Lord
[1:37:56] himself shall give you a sign behold a
[1:38:01] virgin shall conceive not just oh look
[1:38:05] at this and bear a son and shall call
[1:38:10] his name Emmanuel so any you know I'm
[1:38:14] brother you know brother branham toe
[1:38:15] said there were so many young ladies
[1:38:17] that took off at that time a man are
[1:38:21] claiming that they were pregnant that
[1:38:23] they were going to fulfill this promise
[1:38:25] be be careful with that be careful with
[1:38:29] that hallelujah
[1:38:31] one thing to speak by faith but it's
[1:38:33] another thing you know just to wait on
[1:38:36] God you know recently they had something
[1:38:39] happy where this lady telling everybody
[1:38:40] something and it didn't come to come to
[1:38:42] pass and when it didn't come to pass she
[1:38:45] she kind of lost her mind she lost her
[1:38:48] mind she killed her best friend and it
[1:38:52] took the baby from my best friend and
[1:38:54] claimed it as as hos right
[1:38:58] I mean people lose their mind and things
[1:38:59] like that so you got to be careful God
[1:39:01] God is God and let me put it this way if
[1:39:04] you believe in God for a child God will
[1:39:06] give you one you can stand on the same
[1:39:08] scriptures that I mean with Mary when he
[1:39:10] told Mary that she was gonna have much I
[1:39:12] said nothing will be impossible with God
[1:39:15] she said I can this ain't me nothing
[1:39:17] will be impossible god I want to tell
[1:39:19] you it whatever you believe it God for
[1:39:20] nothing will be impossible with God just
[1:39:22] hold to the Word of God they may he'll
[1:39:25] bring it to pass but here here Mary is
[1:39:29] holding on to these scriptures that all
[1:39:31] she got to go look at just a couple
[1:39:33] scriptures and now she got this
[1:39:34] testimony of a visitation from you know
[1:39:37] from from from Gabriel and you know just
[1:39:40] as so many things that are that are
[1:39:42] unusual about this let me just add
[1:39:45] something that I want to share there if
[1:39:47] I can just find it okay you know it's
[1:39:50] just so many things that's unusual but
[1:39:52] all she had was Amen what was
[1:39:56] descriptors in this experience oh my god
[1:39:59] and I want to just bring it forward
[1:40:01] because we know he's not in the manger
[1:40:03] back there you know the same way the
[1:40:06] stars and actually it's hard me know the
[1:40:09] same way two wise men saw a star and
[1:40:12] Mary and Joseph saw star brother branham
[1:40:15] say this star is something that all that
[1:40:17] that science is trying to make it very
[1:40:19] common science say this happens to every
[1:40:22] eight hundred years or so
[1:40:23] science try to make it very very common
[1:40:26] like nothing supernatural happened on
[1:40:27] that night but no he said he'd say that
[1:40:29] that star was very soup
[1:40:31] natural not if it was a very common
[1:40:36] event why was it that only very few
[1:40:38] people saw it if it was very common
[1:40:43] offense and then actually it was you
[1:40:46] know if I want to bring it forward to
[1:40:48] today when brother Brennan was born
[1:40:51] something happy with the Stars
[1:40:54] hallelujah
[1:40:55] now the preachers couldn't tell them
[1:40:57] that the preachers didn't know that
[1:41:00] just like Herod and those around Herod
[1:41:03] did not know what was going on in that
[1:41:04] time but the religious leaders today did
[1:41:08] not understand what was happening where
[1:41:09] God sent a prophet in this thing but a
[1:41:14] woman that watch saw a woman that that
[1:41:17] studied this she said I know the exact
[1:41:20] date you were born I know the exact day
[1:41:24] you were born she said I can tell you
[1:41:25] born on April 6 because the stars came
[1:41:28] together just like it did on the day
[1:41:31] Jesus was born now I'm just saying I'm
[1:41:34] not I'm not trying to put brother
[1:41:36] Branham in a higher place in Christ but
[1:41:38] I do want to understand you got to
[1:41:40] respect that God was using this ministry
[1:41:43] if I could just put it this week he's
[1:41:46] the same yesterday today forever and if
[1:41:48] we can see what he did what happened
[1:41:49] back then his birth then bring it all
[1:41:51] the way up to you know I'll just about
[1:41:52] hundreds o years from from where we are
[1:41:55] right now we can see he's the same but
[1:41:58] here we see you know all these stars are
[1:42:00] lined again and for me I got for me to
[1:42:04] believe about the stars aligning for
[1:42:07] brother Branham I had to be able to go
[1:42:09] back to the scripture and find what
[1:42:11] scriptures were pertaining to that
[1:42:13] ministry that's why I could believe
[1:42:15] Malachi 4 helps me believe revelation 10
[1:42:19] 7 helps me believe it st. Luke's 1730
[1:42:22] helps me believe Oh glory to God let's
[1:42:27] just read a little bit more here oh my
[1:42:30] my God my God my God my God this was uh
[1:42:33] this is this is this is a blessing to me
[1:42:36] this is a blessing just something about
[1:42:41] the Stars
[1:42:43] God's gifts always find their places
[1:42:44] just a little something here that the
[1:42:46] Prophet makes a statement and and I just
[1:42:49] I just believe so many supernatural
[1:42:51] things that happen and I want to I want
[1:42:53] to try to hit and hit many of them but
[1:42:56] that's just about these stars it says
[1:42:57] notice now not two more days to
[1:42:59] Christmas one more day isn't it that
[1:43:03] that be to Monday Tuesday Christmas Eve
[1:43:05] Tuesday's Christmas Eve isn't it awful
[1:43:08] to see that this great holiday that
[1:43:10] we're approaching is approached in the
[1:43:13] manner that is approached in it's such a
[1:43:15] pitiful thing such a rational thing to
[1:43:18] think that rabbits in a myth cause Kris
[1:43:22] Kringle Santa Claus and everything has
[1:43:25] taken the realvalue away from Christmas
[1:43:28] from what Christmas is now we don't know
[1:43:31] and I certainly do not believe I was
[1:43:33] just coming down my wife back there
[1:43:35] coming down the road was listening at an
[1:43:37] astronomer that now they just fell on
[1:43:40] the idea which an astronomer told me
[1:43:43] many years ago when I was just a game
[1:43:46] warden here in Indiana nice talk about
[1:43:48] his experience that he had with that bat
[1:43:50] lady that was astronomy says when they
[1:43:52] told me that says how those stars came
[1:43:54] together just like that first astronomer
[1:43:58] did and in that form hundreds of years
[1:44:01] or something like that and and it
[1:44:03] reforms itself again
[1:44:04] Sarkis and Jupiter and I forget Mars no
[1:44:08] X wrong it some some of the stars how
[1:44:11] they how they speed when they cross
[1:44:13] their orbits in line of Earth and this
[1:44:16] astronomer to tonight was trying to tell
[1:44:19] that it actually was a natural thing
[1:44:21] they're trying to tell that it was a
[1:44:23] natural thing I don't accept that I like
[1:44:27] that I like that a man somebody might
[1:44:31] try to you know deduce this thing down
[1:44:34] to make it seem like it's very natural
[1:44:35] no a supernatural and Christ was born it
[1:44:38] was supernatural a man a man a man a man
[1:44:42] he says he says I don't accept it I
[1:44:44] believe it was a supernatural thing that
[1:44:46] God did God did he thing's a
[1:44:50] supernatural God he is supernatural
[1:44:54] he is supernatural I wanna just kind of
[1:44:58] talk there were so many unusual things
[1:45:00] that happen at the time his verse first
[1:45:02] thing is unusual a virgin is conceiving
[1:45:04] and bearing a child that's unusual but
[1:45:06] she's standing on the word as you know
[1:45:08] as she's confessing and telling rider
[1:45:10] what happened between her and an angel
[1:45:12] Gabriel she's just standing on that and
[1:45:14] she's telling the word even when she
[1:45:15] told Joseph all she could do was stand
[1:45:18] on the word hallelujah Joseph amen as he
[1:45:22] was thinking privately to put her away
[1:45:24] amen
[1:45:25] Joseph was visited by an angel through a
[1:45:28] dream that was also a man unusual
[1:45:31] supernet fear not take them to the Mary
[1:45:33] thy wife but that which is conceived in
[1:45:36] her is of the Holy Ghost
[1:45:37] Joseph was visited by a man an angel
[1:45:40] visited in a dream and there he found
[1:45:42] comfort to be able to go forward with
[1:45:44] Mary as his wife Oh hallelujah
[1:45:46] I just believe that somebody gonna need
[1:45:48] a visitation from God in order to keep
[1:45:52] going with this word hallelujah if you
[1:45:58] if you I mean if you got some doubt God
[1:46:00] just like Joseph had some doubt if you
[1:46:02] got some doubt God is able to visit you
[1:46:07] hallelujah
[1:46:08] hey man hey man you know there was a
[1:46:12] brother one time has some doubt about
[1:46:14] the Prophet he went to Africa to speak
[1:46:18] and this brother say III I'm sorry he
[1:46:22] had he had a dream of some black brother
[1:46:24] branham smoking a cigarette and now we
[1:46:27] know the Prophet ain't never smoked no
[1:46:28] cigarette the angel told him not to
[1:46:31] touch those things right so he could
[1:46:33] even when he tried the angel pushed it
[1:46:35] you know I mean stopped it from
[1:46:36] happening so so he say he'd say even his
[1:46:39] daddy tried to get him some non-locking
[1:46:40] I'm not supposed to do that so here this
[1:46:43] ego so African his brother say he had a
[1:46:45] dream by a brother branham smoker
[1:46:46] seriously that's why you got to watch
[1:46:47] every dream and I ever dreamed me a man
[1:46:49] every dream in what you think it is
[1:46:52] alright so so here this man had a dream
[1:46:54] say he's saying I can't I can't get in
[1:46:56] touch even I can't I came fellowship
[1:46:58] with this meaning because this dream
[1:46:59] that I just had it
[1:47:00] I'm sorry brother branham
[1:47:01] as a man that's not right so so so the
[1:47:04] man was kind of moving away from the
[1:47:06] meeting and he was he was going back to
[1:47:09] where he was coming from and as he was
[1:47:11] going back he felt a hand come on his
[1:47:17] shoulder
[1:47:18] hallelujah brother quick we could come
[1:47:20] for a second just turn and face to face
[1:47:23] the audience he felt a hand just come on
[1:47:25] his shoulder like that and just I told
[1:47:28] him stop stop go back you know it's okay
[1:47:31] you can fellowship with him he just felt
[1:47:32] the hand like that going back to your
[1:47:34] seat brother and when he felt the hand
[1:47:38] he turned and he went back and he just
[1:47:40] began to talk to the Prophet and talk to
[1:47:42] different ones about his experiencing
[1:47:44] and he didn't realize this but when he
[1:47:49] got back to them the imprint of the hand
[1:47:51] was still on his back and then brother
[1:47:57] Branham had to break it down he said
[1:48:04] brother if you don't mind I want to show
[1:48:06] you something that imprint on your back
[1:48:11] the angel that visit at you that imprint
[1:48:14] on your back actually if you just let me
[1:48:16] put my hand on the imprint you will see
[1:48:20] that it fits my hand
[1:48:23] [Applause]
[1:48:25] confirming that God was with the Prophet
[1:48:29] say God God moved in a supernatural
[1:48:33] hallelujah but before you even call to
[1:48:36] believe in the supernatural God put
[1:48:38] scripture there since I might as well
[1:48:42] just see this because I'm this just this
[1:48:44] just in my spirit I'm saying it like
[1:48:46] this for a reason turn with me to this
[1:48:51] distant part I say is someone gonna be
[1:48:53] Chris oh I'm gonna be Christmas and so
[1:48:55] I'm not gonna be Christmas but every day
[1:48:57] Christmas 2nd Corinthians chapter 11 you
[1:49:07] know we we we are under attack
[1:49:10] spirits attacking everything and we
[1:49:14] don't realize that the spirits we got it
[1:49:17] we got to recognize the enemy and and
[1:49:20] for me for me you know I remember going
[1:49:23] to Jeffersonville and having the
[1:49:25] opportunity to see the prophets grave
[1:49:26] and I'm one that that believes that when
[1:49:29] you go to brother Bram's grave you go to
[1:49:30] Jeffersonville they have a little chain
[1:49:33] fence around the grave and the chain
[1:49:37] fence is there so that you don't go over
[1:49:41] the fence to get next to the grave right
[1:49:44] you can take a picture on the other side
[1:49:47] of the fence you ain't got to be up
[1:49:48] leaning up to on the grave you don't do
[1:49:50] all of that right but but the chain is
[1:49:52] there to keep you out of that area amen
[1:49:55] but you have people that'll just step
[1:49:57] right over and go lean up against the
[1:49:59] promise great you know one person did
[1:50:01] that in this video they're on YouTube
[1:50:02] they went to lean up and a dove flew out
[1:50:04] of the grief supernatural done right
[1:50:07] that should have said something but no
[1:50:10] they gonna smile and takes no you don't
[1:50:12] do that respect respect that right and
[1:50:15] while I was there you know just just
[1:50:17] just just at the green the Lord spoke
[1:50:19] something to my spirit he says says
[1:50:22] always respect my prophet always respect
[1:50:26] my prophet what did what he taught me
[1:50:28] says don't lift him too high
[1:50:33] respect my profits say don't lift them
[1:50:35] too high
[1:50:36] don't put them too low you got to walk
[1:50:42] in the middle of the road when you're
[1:50:45] dealing with the profit hallelujah
[1:50:48] hey man when you're dealing with God's
[1:50:49] you gotta walk in the middle of the road
[1:50:51] hallelujah so he told me that and and
[1:50:53] I've always done that
[1:50:55] I mean don't don't put him too high
[1:50:57] because he's not greeted in Christ he
[1:51:00] was a star in the hand of Christ but
[1:51:03] don't put him too low he was not just a
[1:51:05] good preacher he was a prophet of God
[1:51:08] hey man for feeling scripture this is
[1:51:15] what's in my spirit 2nd Corinthians 11
[1:51:21] for I'm now forgive me for being all
[1:51:25] over the place but this just where my
[1:51:26] thoughts were for if he that cometh
[1:51:30] preaches another jesus whom we have not
[1:51:34] preached or if you receive another
[1:51:37] spirit which he have not received or
[1:51:40] another gospel which he have not
[1:51:44] accepted you might well bear with them
[1:51:47] now Paul is saying this and it just it
[1:51:50] just my spirit a man just began to be
[1:51:53] challenged why would Paul use words like
[1:51:57] this if he that cometh preaches another
[1:52:00] jesus think about this
[1:52:03] was there another Jesus on the earth
[1:52:06] doing the things that the Lord our Lord
[1:52:08] and Savior Jesus Christ was doing was
[1:52:11] there another man that could even
[1:52:13] compare to what Christ was doing I want
[1:52:16] to put it this way if there was another
[1:52:18] man like that we would have heard about
[1:52:22] we would have heard about him in there
[1:52:24] was a man compare it to this Jesus the
[1:52:26] Christ hallelujah glory to God see
[1:52:31] so as I look at that amen I think Amen
[1:52:35] they were preaching the same Jesus just
[1:52:36] preached them a different way
[1:52:38] Oh stay with me here you know back in
[1:52:42] Matthew when Jesus rose again you know
[1:52:45] it was the via the soldiers went to the
[1:52:49] Sadducees and the Pharisees and said you
[1:52:52] know he rose and the stone was rolled
[1:52:54] away and we don't know what happened you
[1:52:56] know they said what you need to do is
[1:52:58] come up with this story and we gonna
[1:53:00] solidify the story we gonna pay you to
[1:53:02] tell the story tell them that you were
[1:53:05] sleeping and the disciples came and took
[1:53:07] him away hallelujah they had a different
[1:53:11] gospel about Jesus they knew he was no
[1:53:14] longer in the grave but they had a
[1:53:15] different gospel can I go a little
[1:53:19] further I want to put it this way Paul
[1:53:23] knew that maybe they had Jesus in the
[1:53:26] wrong place
[1:53:27] in history maybe they didn't see that he
[1:53:30] had already come and was resurrected
[1:53:31] nodular maybe they was missing sir paul
[1:53:34] had already run into him on the road to
[1:53:36] Damascus so Paul had a new Amen Paul had
[1:53:39] a different revelation than what those
[1:53:42] Sadducees and Pharisees had even though
[1:53:44] they was looking at the same scriptures
[1:53:46] oh my god I want to go a little further
[1:53:48] because if they preach another Jesus you
[1:53:52] know there's a statement being made
[1:53:54] nowadays we just want to preach Jesus
[1:53:57] which Jesus which Jesus we talking about
[1:54:03] you know we just want to preach Jesus
[1:54:05] because I'm telling it while I'm
[1:54:06] preaching right now I'm preaching Jesus
[1:54:09] I'm preaching Jesus hallelujah but I'm
[1:54:13] bringing you forward I'm not just
[1:54:14] leaving them in the grave I'm not just
[1:54:17] leaving them in a manger
[1:54:18] Amen I'm sure you need the same
[1:54:20] yesterday today forever so so when when
[1:54:22] Paul is saying it's preaching another
[1:54:24] Jesus what is if they're not reaching
[1:54:26] the Jesus that is promised for this day
[1:54:30] they preaching another Jesus
[1:54:33] if they're not pretty l can I go a
[1:54:36] little further Jesus is the word Jesus
[1:54:41] is the word so if they not preaching the
[1:54:44] word for this day they're preaching
[1:54:47] another Jesus Oh hallelujah
[1:54:52] if you cannot see that Jesus sent a
[1:54:56] prophet for this thing you preaching
[1:54:58] another Jesus if you can't receive what
[1:55:02] he's done but this day if you can't see
[1:55:04] the Scriptures people feel for this day
[1:55:08] you're preaching another teeth see it's
[1:55:17] so easy to go talk about reindeer and
[1:55:22] what they got to do with Jesus what
[1:55:26] Santa Claus got to do with Jesus here's
[1:55:34] some about a man he he grows beard I had
[1:55:37] to look like Santa Claus why why can't
[1:55:38] people look like Jesus girls beard to
[1:55:43] look at look like Sam Kyle take care
[1:55:44] he'd do all kind of stuff that man get
[1:55:46] paid $200 an hour to act like Santa
[1:55:49] Claus you gotta pay nobody to be like
[1:55:53] Jesus no nothing I mean it's nothing
[1:55:59] it's all free and this just this is why
[1:56:02] we got to remember Christ at this time
[1:56:04] I'm trying to bring the attention back
[1:56:05] to him we want to see what he's doing
[1:56:07] today not what he did back then brothers
[1:56:10] brother Jerry brought us a quote you
[1:56:12] know the wise man saw the star and they
[1:56:16] followed and they got to Christ but
[1:56:18] brother Brandon brought out a statement
[1:56:20] he says you are the star
[1:56:28] you you the star then brother Jim rather
[1:56:35] quote to us on Friday night you and
[1:56:37] you're the star so so the question is
[1:56:39] this if wise men we're looking for for
[1:56:43] the Christ child back then and they
[1:56:44] follow the star to get to Christ who
[1:56:48] following you who's following you cuz

[1:58:14] line and a man let's let's get our mind
[1:58:17] back on what it's really all about
[1:58:20] hallelujah and the only way we gonna
[1:58:23] live is by following a message the
[1:58:26] message was what came to help put us in
[1:58:29] line a man glory to God hallelujah great
[1:58:35] shining light he says this and we cannot
[1:58:38] be an ordinary we have to be unusual why
[1:58:45] y'all got to be so different we have to
[1:58:48] be unusual
[1:58:50] we cannot be usual because God's people
[1:58:54] are a peculiar people they've been
[1:58:59] through the ages so they've been through
[1:59:01] the ages they still gonna be peculiar
[1:59:03] today a man
[1:59:05] although peculiar yet the star was
[1:59:09] brilliant not brilliant in in world's
[1:59:12] educational world's affair but brilliant
[1:59:15] as sacrificed before the Lord we
[1:59:17] prostrate ourselves as the match eyes
[1:59:20] did in the presence of the King of Kings
[1:59:22] to reflect his light because I star on
[1:59:26] and reflects the light of the Sun and we
[1:59:28] reflect the light of the s om listen

[1:59:43] my name on a star Hollywood but what
[1:59:47] what is that gonna do for everybody
[1:59:49] how's that gonna bring people to Jesus
[1:59:52] huh amen
[1:59:54] we want we want to reflect Christ in
[1:59:56] this day listen
[1:59:57] he says you're a star every Christian is
[2:00:01] a star to God the lost to God the weary
[2:00:07] the foot of the traveller to those who
[2:00:11] are seeking then the star cannot be
[2:00:14] guided by itself this is beautiful to me
[2:00:18] they may it must be led by the spirit it
[2:00:22] must reflect the brilliancy of God in
[2:00:25] its life to abstain from the things of
[2:00:27] the world that's how you reflect the
[2:00:30] brilliancy of God amen is by abstaining
[2:00:34] it has to be a decision that you make
[2:00:37] that I will not give my body to sin
[2:00:41] [Applause]
[2:00:42] hallelujah somebody you gotta come to
[2:00:46] that conclusion yourself I'm gonna live
[2:00:49] for God I'm gonna die for God I'm gonna
[2:00:54] worship God you know even Paul said I
[2:00:57] present if you got a present to give the
[2:00:59] Christ if you just got one present cuz
[2:01:02] he gave you something
[2:01:04] he gave me his life on the cross and now
[2:01:06] it's time for you to bring him a present
[2:01:08] bring your body I present my body a
[2:01:12] living sacrifice holy and acceptable
[2:01:16] unto God Paul said this is my reasonable
[2:01:24] reasonable service it's the least I can
[2:01:28] do the star cannot be guided by self it
[2:01:33] must be led by the Spirit must reflect a
[2:01:35] brilliancy of God in its life to abstain
[2:01:37] from the things of the world and to live
[2:01:39] godly and solely in the present life it
[2:01:41] must reflect the light of its great of
[2:01:44] its great one that shine what are we to
[2:01:47] do then - rise and shine the light of
[2:01:50] God to the dying and death darkness of
[2:01:53] this world we are to reflect and shine
[2:01:56] the presence of the Lord Jesus in his
[2:01:59] resurrecting power as he's as he is
[2:02:01] yesterday so see today to reflect him he
[2:02:05] goes on to say this but remember and
[2:02:08] this is a good thing when you realize
[2:02:10] your star you shining and and somebody
[2:02:12] should be following you to church just
[2:02:14] probably - and with the purpose what of
[2:02:16] your a little church because you're
[2:02:17] trying to bring them with Christ is a
[2:02:19] man listen what you do
[2:02:23] he'll say this cuz when you get them
[2:02:27] when when when the wise man found Christ
[2:02:31] the star left the star left when they
[2:02:35] got to Christ the star left
[2:02:37] no more star when they got to Christ
[2:02:39] hallelujah look at what the prophets
[2:02:43] saying this statement says but remember
[2:02:45] then the star again when it's finished
[2:02:47] its course it takes no honor
[2:02:52] when the star finishes its course it
[2:02:55] takes no honor the star just brought
[2:02:59] them into their destination and showed
[2:03:01] them that perfect life a man we're not
[2:03:08] taking any honor we just want to bring
[2:03:09] people to Christ hallelujah if we want
[2:03:13] to preach to them of Jesus that is the
[2:03:15] same yesterday today and forever
[2:03:17] Jesus that is still fulfilling his
[2:03:19] promise word that's what we want to
[2:03:21] present to them Oh glory to God all
[2:03:25] right I'm gonna stop right there on that
[2:03:26] particular quote I want to I got a
[2:03:29] couple other things I want to share and
[2:03:30] then a man we will uh we'll close off a

[2:18:11] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ I want
[2:18:13] to ask you will you make room for him in
[2:18:18] this season in your heart see the stable
[2:18:23] that the manger the stable it was a
[2:18:25] place that nobody really wanted to go
[2:18:27] nobody wanted to go and sometimes we
[2:18:30] look at our hearts it kind of reminds us
[2:18:32] of the stable that's a place that you
[2:18:34] really don't want nobody to go you don't
[2:18:37] want nobody to know some of the things
[2:18:38] that don't happen in there hallelujah
[2:18:41] but God wants to come inside the midst
[2:18:43] of all your darkness and he wants to
[2:18:45] give you some light let's just reflect
[2:18:53] less reflect during this season let's
[2:18:57] remember Christ it's last quotas coming
[2:19:03] out of Smyrna in church age I want to
[2:19:04] read and brother Randleman made a
[2:19:06] statement just just imagine this Jehovah
[2:19:09] God and a manger crying like a baby
[2:19:11] can you imagine Jehovah that said let
[2:19:13] there be light that Saint Jehovah came
[2:19:17] down form the body he got in the body
[2:19:20] and start crying like a baby he says
[2:19:25] think of Jehovah playing as a boy
[2:19:31] think of jehovah having the same
[2:19:33] struggles that every teenager has and
[2:19:35] see the reason that he had to be tempted
[2:19:39] the same way you attempted is is because
[2:19:40] he can secure or he can help you through
[2:19:43] the things that you're going through he
[2:19:46] says think of think of him building a
[2:19:48] house out of the very timber that he
[2:19:52] created can you imagine that Jehovah
[2:19:54] with a hammer in his hand
[2:19:56] Jehovah with nails on his side oh can
[2:20:03] you imagine with with the ham in his
[2:20:05] hand and the nails in the side and
[2:20:08] building houses but when he's reaching
[2:20:10] down there getting him nails he says one
[2:20:12] of these days are you with me as he's
[2:20:20] reaching into a man to pick up a nail
[2:20:22] and and build a house he said one of
[2:20:24] these days I know where where is now
[2:20:26] gonna go I know what a hammer gonna do
[2:20:30] hallelujah he recognized was not bad but
[2:20:34] he didn't learn from it he he could he
[2:20:36] could have caused all nails to cease to
[2:20:39] exist all hammers to to disappear but no
[2:20:44] no no no he welcomed the hammer he
[2:20:46] welcomed the nails this is why he came
[2:20:48] to earth
[2:20:49] this was his purpose he wasn't focused
[2:20:52] focusing on the back he was focusing on
[2:20:55] the death to Jehovah I just love the way
[2:21:02] the Prophet prove it I want to read this
[2:21:05] I want to just to strike you and I want
[2:21:06] you to think about Lord and I'll save it
[2:21:09] as I read this out of Smyrna Church it
[2:21:10] says how striking it is born over a
[2:21:16] manure
[2:21:18] jehovah born in a manger of strong there
[2:21:22] is your everlasting sign to the proud
[2:21:25] and puffed up pseudo-intellectuals that
[2:21:27] have evolved their own theology denied
[2:21:29] the truth of God Jehovah God a crying
[2:21:31] baby in a stinking barn then we think we
[2:21:37] have a right to be proud holding up our
[2:21:41] noses criticize
[2:21:42] and then acted as though we were
[2:21:44] somebody here's your real sign this is
[2:21:48] the right one jehovah playing as a boy
[2:21:52] jehovah working in a carpenter's shop
[2:21:55] jehovah washing the feet of fishermen i
[2:21:59] would give you a sign said god not the
[2:22:03] style of a white-collar priesthood not a
[2:22:05] sign of wealth and power there's nothing
[2:22:07] in this time that you were wont or think
[2:22:10] suitable but it is an everlasting sign
[2:22:13] it is the greatest sign of all jehovah
[2:22:16] standing in the courtyard bruised and
[2:22:19] bleeding with thorns on his brow and
[2:22:23] spit on his face i'm talk about jehovah
[2:22:26] same God that created everything saying
[2:22:29] we talk about we can't go through
[2:22:30] nothing why me she over went through it
[2:22:33] all Harlan and didn't complain while he
[2:22:37] was going through listen a man says
[2:22:40] mocked and said it not jehovah despised
[2:22:43] and rejected can you imagine that to
[2:22:45] over despised and rejected hanging naked
[2:22:49] upon the cross while the hypocrites
[2:22:52] jeered and dared him to come down off
[2:22:54] the cross she Hova dying not just that
[2:22:58] just struck me a funeral for jehovah the
[2:23:05] very one that raised Lazarus from the
[2:23:07] grave when when the widow of nain came
[2:23:11] by touched a buyer in and in her boy
[2:23:13] came out jehovah at a funeral service
[2:23:18] can you imagine having it being one of
[2:23:21] the disciples that day of having to go
[2:23:22] to the funeral service you would be
[2:23:25] discouraged when you left the church
[2:23:27] jehovah died jehovah praying and nothing
[2:23:37] happening you get you you you ready to
[2:23:42] just give up on God because you're
[2:23:45] praying been hurried yet but jehovah
[2:23:48] prayed and nothing happened when he said
[2:23:50] he says when he was in the garden of
[2:23:53] garden of gethsemane praying
[2:23:55] let this cup pass Jehovah was praying
[2:23:57] nothing happening and he had to bring
[2:23:59] himself to a conclusion Lord not my will
[2:24:03] but thy will be done as an example to
[2:24:07] all of us that sometimes we gonna go
[2:24:09] through things like that in life Lord
[2:24:11] not my will but thy will be done
[2:24:15] g-hold are praying nothing happening now
[2:24:21] when you start going through that you
[2:24:22] don't prayed to God and seem like I'm
[2:24:24] not moving you just keep praising God
[2:24:29] then Jehovah died that is the sign for
[2:24:33] oh man now there isn't another like it
[2:24:36] it is the great one the darkness came
[2:24:41] upon the earth they put him in a tomb
[2:24:45] there he lay those three days and nights
[2:24:48] until an earthquake shattered the gloom
[2:24:51] of night and he came forth
[2:24:54] I like this Jehovah came forth Jehovah
[2:25:01] ascended on high dim Jehovah returned to
[2:25:07] end well his church so who's living on
[2:25:10] the inside of you Jay OVA deity is
[2:25:13] living there a man Jehovah came back
[2:25:16] with a mighty rushing wind and flames of
[2:25:19] fire Jehovah came back to walk in the
[2:25:22] midst of his church and empower his
[2:25:25] people once more Jehovah came and this
[2:25:28] time to stay in his people and again
[2:25:33] Jehovah heals the sick Jehovah raises
[2:25:37] the dead Jehovah manifests himself by
[2:25:41] the spirit Jehovah came back speaking in
[2:25:45] tongues and giving the answer back in
[2:25:47] interpretation Jehovah came down and he
[2:25:53] raised the prostitute to sin no more he
[2:25:58] came down to the drunkard with flat
[2:26:01] blows on his face and he lay unconscious
[2:26:03] in the gutter

[2:26:49] have made it and as believers as
[2:26:51] believers we got to be so careful that
[2:26:54] we don't get wrapped up in all the pagan
[2:26:56] traditions of it and I'm not trying to

[2:27:38] these things so don't don't deprive the
[2:27:40] children that's what he's saying he says
[2:27:43] that you got together put yourself on
[2:27:44] the level and understand that but some
[2:27:46] of us some of us ain't children no more
