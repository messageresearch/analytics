i would like to come before you uh we're going to read a scripture but start from genesis uh i'll do the best i can hear it you know i'm really not good at arguments time i'm not a good debater my thoughts get all over the place i just i quit sometimes my wife and i are going through some things yeah sometime we we argue we go back and forth and she's very good at staying on point and i'm all over the place and i just get whooped because i can't keep a free thought for nothing let my emotions get all involved walking around the house out the door and she just standing there why can't we just talk i thought that what i was doing [Laughter] why can't you just see it my way but you know what love prevails amen so uh we'll read this this this scripture here and i'll try to keep my thoughts besides i'll do the best i can amen maybe that's just the way the lord made me i just i'm just not good at it sometimes now but may love prevail amen so we're taking this from genesis 24 amen will be begin i was going to start from the 12th verse but i i feel maybe i should start it from the seventh amen and it says the lord god of heaven which took me from my father's house from the land of my kindred and which spake unto me and that swear unto me saying unto thy seed i will give this land he shall send his angel before thee and shall take a wife unto thy unto my son from this and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee then thou shalt be clear from this my oath only bring not my son vither again and the servant put his hand under the thigh of abraham his master and under abraham his master and swear to him concerning that matter and the servant took ten camels of the camels of the master and departed for all the goods of his master were in his hand and he arose and went to mesopotamia unto the city of nehar and he made his camels to kneel down uh without the city by the whale of water at the time of the evening now i want you to notice there that they are at the well of water in the evening time that's very significant even the time that the woman go out to draw water in the evening time and he said oh lord god of my master abraham i pray thee send me good speed this day and show kindness unto my master abraham behold i stand here by the well of water and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water and let it come to pass that the damsel to whom i shall say let down thy picture i pray thee that me that i may drink and she shall say drink and i will give thy camel's drink also let the same be that she thou has appointed for thy servant isaac now i want you to notice that's very significant to say let the same be she that thou has appointed for thy servant isaac and thereby shall i know that thou has showed kindness to my master amen if you can turn in your bibles you may be seated we'll turn in our bibles there to revelation the 21st chapter and we'll read from the ninth verse revelation 21 and the ninth verse and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vows full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither i will show thee the bride the lamb's wife amen if you will again turn in your bibles with me we're going to go to matthew the 25th chapter we'll begin reading at the sixth verse and go down say to the tenth verse and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh amen behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him amen then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us your oar for our lamps are gone out but the wise answer saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather than to them that buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut the lord had a blessing to the reading i want us to focus here just briefly on the sixth verse for my title this evening behold the bridegroom coming and we we we're we're in a time now uh there's a wise man once told me he said to me he say you know when you're ministering and you're coming up with a title he told me he said tell him what you're gonna tell him then he say tell him then he say tell him what you told him so i'm telling you all right behold the bridegroom cometh right amen we we we we are living in a time that that that a critical time and and the crab went out behold the bridegroom cometh last week i attempted to bring a few things out one of the things that i that that i was discussing that i brought out was we we are living in a and under under an an eagle anointing they talk about through the seven church ages no i don't for the sake of time i promise you i won't hold you as long as i did last week i promise you i won't do that i was trying to get through some things and i still ain't getting that and it may seem a little discombo but hopefully tonight i'll bring it all and and and tie it all together in one nice little package here so uh uh uh uh uh uh we lit that was through four no four anointings to to get the the for through these seven church ages to to give the people strength courage to deal with what they were going to have to deal with at that particular time frame of the the the the building of the body right or the gathering oh my god of the people right to form uh uh his bride uh different different different ones uh had to go through different things but we at this end time i want you to notice we go back there uh to genesis the 24th is eliezer was going out to find a a bride uh or he was commissioned by abraham to find a wife for isaac he was commissioned to go out of and what what a what a responsibility what a task no wonder he prayed lord you do this pray say lord you uh choose this this damsel amen this this young lady amen this this virgin amen uh to to i can present amen to abraham for isaac to be wed amen so we see we're living eloheesa was up under that eagle anointed he his job was to go out and and find a wife for the son of abraham and under that eagle anointing let me tell you something my brothers and sisters we're not looking for church members right we're not looking for uh large congregations we're not looking for to be recorded now we don't we don't need a large audience or television man we don't need all of the pop and circumstance we are living under an eagle anointing to carve out a bride for the son of god amen so i will our our messages may come uh uh uh uh uh our approach may be different right our our our our requirements space may seem a little bit stringent right but do you realize the gravity of the responsibility that has been put in our hands we're not just coming here we're not just seeking anybody we're not just just saying oh come anyone who wants to come no we are looking for a specific type of people right and these people if we go back here to genesis 24. it says there in genesis 24 to 14 it says let the same be she that thou has appointed for thy servant right so we're not doing the choosing now just like eliza at least god has already done the appointing right amen we're just saying behold the bridegroom coming it's time it's time rebecca to make yourself ready it's time to put away those things that that that that azure look growing up i find that one of the most difficult transitions is going from an adolescent young adult over into adulthood some people never cross over that's right that's right okay just being honest some people don't ever get there but that is a critical juncture when you're crossing over from that point of being under your uh under your your parents leadership and tutelage hand holding and taking care of crossing over until full responsibility right it is a time when the devil pounces because he know uh uh you you haven't quite been through a lot of battles you don't you you really you you you're a young pup stepping out for the first time so a lot of times the devil fights you and with all sorts of thoughts well i'm finally old enough to do whatever it is comes to my mind to do usually those those years of college right i'm out of my parents house i don't have the curfew anymore i don't have the rules anymore but you have to be able to have something now guide you on the inside and we find that that critical juncture is where a lot of people make their mistakes right they make horrible mistakes that a lot of times follow them throughout the rest of their lives amen if you go with me here to the message choosing of a bride this message was preached in 1965. amen uh 04 29 if you can finance this and pull that up for me we'll be reading from uh the 51st chapter and the prophet there was was saying uh he said if we would study what we're doing when we go to get married he said when we choose our wife our husband if we study it over a man should pray earnestly for he could ruin his entire life now i want to remind you that uh if you can you find this sister there uh choose another bride 65 04 29 evening amen now we found that he said he said uh if you pray honestly for he could ruin his entire life remember the vow is until death do we part until death do we part now i know many people don't live by that no more but that's still bible right that's still bible right amen now and he could ruin his life by making a wrong choice i remember revelation 24 eliezer is going out to find a wife for isaac i mean i'm sorry genesis yes genesis 24 he's going out to find a wife now but if he knows what he's making a wrong choice and he marry a woman that isn't fit to be his wife and he does it anyway then it's his fault if a woman takes a husband and knows that he's not fit to be a husband to you then that's your own fault after you know what's right and wrong so you shouldn't do it until you thoroughly thoroughly pray through now i want you to pay close attention right here he says the same applies to choosing a church because he your pastor is your spiritual husband your spiritual husband not wife husband amen now you must pray over the church that you are fellowshipping in you must pray over the church that you are fellowshipping in churches carry [Music] you must pray over the mate that you choose right you choose the wrong one you're gonna have to deal with that spirit until death do you part now i go back to restoration of the bride tree you don't have to pull it up he was saying that the same way that the insect the devouring insect that changes its characters and changes its form the same way he attacks the individual is the same way he attacks the church am i okay am i loud enough okay thank you my brother let me know sometimes i tend to pull away and they can't they can't hear me too good on the stream so uh we have to understand that that that that when choosing a bride when uh a a a a a woman don't choose a husband she submits to right okay so so so even in your submittal you must be wary of what you submitting to yeah right my point here is you have to really honestly seek god now first you have to ask yourself what are you looking for what are you looking for in a mate you're looking for good looks hello you're looking for someone who merely makes a lot of money hello you see we we we're we're we're back to that bride tree again we we we it says that that tree you'll know that tree by the fruit that it bears eliezer he was not necessarily looking for the most beautiful damsel he say the one who are asked to drink and she is kind enough to not only give me a drink but she also gave my camels right she said wow what a spirit she has on her yeah he was looking at her character he he wasn't he wasn't concerned about nothing else he didn't choose a well the one that come out and and got the shortest skirt on the one that come out and battle eyes and show me all 32 all right no the one that came out amen and was able to be a servant yeah [Music] meek lowly and humble god amen not some wild staring eye all right prophet told a story about going out picking the the uh heifer for the bull and he would look that bull in the face right in the eye and he said nope that ain't the one say why cause she got that wild stare she'll never be a good mother to your cheering and we see that so much today so getting back to to our topic here choosing of a bride if you could pull that back up he says now i don't want to be critical but i realize that i'm an old man and i gotta leave here one of these days and i've got to answer one day for the judd uh answer one day of the judgment for what i say tonight or any other time and i therefore i've got to be dead earnest and truthful truly convicted but you go into a church and if you'll watch the behavior of that church you just watch the pastor a while and you'll usually find that the church acts like the pastor sometimes i wonder if we just don't get one another spirit instead of the holy spirit you get to a place where the pastor is real radical and carrying on you find out the congregation is the same way i'll bring you to a church where i see a pastor stand and jerk his head back and forth you watch the congregation they're doing the same thing you take a pastor just gulp down anything usually the church would do the same thing so if i was choosing a church i would choose a genuine fundamental full gospel bible church one to put my family in amen one to put my family in that's it sister stop right there i would choose a fundamental full gospel church now we were speaking uh earlier a couple of weeks ago i was talking about how i mean in the in the that's four stage insect the devouring insect and the things that that that he does and he he wants to um um separate he wants to divide he wants to he wants to to ruin the fellowship the tree the the the the the tree comes up the leaves and from the leaves the bread the branches and then the leaves and then the fruit fruit is the character of the person i mean the leaves of the fellowship of the people amen the bark is the covering and and all of that comes from the life that's in the tree amen to push all of these things out so we find that the devil wants to do what when the tree is sick because it the first thing it begins to lose is its leaves leaves are falling there's something wrong there's something that has gotten into that tree that is causing it amen to be just a little sick the life is not quite it's not pushing forth anymore so we find that the prophet said if your pastor leaves the word or refuse to preach the full gospel you lead the pastor a lot of times what we're looking for is some uh what's the word i had oh god a social butterfly a lot of times you you you if if your pastor if your pastor is if preaching and the word of god may make it he don't call me enough or he don't he don't shake now he'll smile in my face and love and he don't come he ain't ca god ain't choosing this man to be your personal uh uh a feel good button he is there to preach the gospel he is there under an eagle anointing amen to we're searching for a damsel to present to isaac so he's not he he's not he's not a social charmer right he's not there to be your social charmer look i ain't gonna say that i almost said little gold crew sitting there drinking it but i said somebody's brother's got gold t so i don't want to offend you but but i mean he's not you you're looking for the wrong thing you're looking for someone to oh smash oh this guy no i'm looking for somebody who's going to preach to me the gospel who's going to prepare me who's going to preach the word of god to me tell me what my husband would have me to do so that when i am presented to him i can be fully rest and dressed and ready to meet him tell me about this isaac tell me amen how i must carry myself educate me on what pleases him yes amen amen how can i be a good wife to him for some well he ain't hanging out he ain't preaching what i want pray about the church that you set up under it's the same as choosing a pride it is more critical than choosing a natural mate you will get in some of these places and take on a spirit [Music] that you have trouble shaking all your life denominational traditions amen turn to john 16th chapter 12th verse john 16 chapter 12 verse this is very important my brothers and sisters as i said before we are up under an eagle anointing this anointing does what an eagle flies high he flies high i would i i i laid in last week revelation 3 18 they buy a i counsel thee to buy of me gold amen that that may have the i said what i said to to to to vision is important at this stage that's why the eagle was chosen as the anointing for this age because see the eagle has a keen vision the higher he goes the more focused his vision becomes the big he can fly higher than any other bird i was reading the thing about how uh the crow would get on the eagle's back and peck at its neck the eagle don't even swat at the crow don't pay him no attention whatsoever what does he do he begin to spread his wings and take flight the higher he go after a while the air gets so thin that crow cannot handle it and he just falls off that's right amen so when you're you're that you're you're crawl sometimes get on your back get on your little nerves just get higher hallelujah just fly higher under the anointing they'll fall away they can't follow you there you're up under an eagle anointing under that eagle anointing we're calling out a bride under that eagle anointing amen because we have a vision amen john 16 12 verse it says i have yet many things to say to you but ye cannot bear them now how be it when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come amen that's that eagle anointing showing you things to come is a prophetic gift right first john go to first john first john the fourth chapter the sixth verse it reads on this wise we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us i'ma read that again we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us he that is not of god heareth not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of era if you have the spirit of truth dwelling in you which is the holy spirit then the evidence of that according to john was that you would be able to hear and understand the word of truth that they were speaking of for that day glory to god that was the evidence that the spirit of truth about it in you because it would lead you to the truth that is the evidence that you got it right that the spit if this spirit that raised christ from the dead dwells in you it would quicken your mortal body amen amen glory the evidence the evidence that that spirit lies within you is that you have an ear to hear i hear my master call amen let's go to matthew 24. matthew 24. i'm gonna try to be quick but of that day and the hour north no man not the angels of heaven but my father only jesus is referring here to the future time of his second coming but as it was in the days of noah where so shall also the coming of the son of man be i want you to notice carefully as it was in the days of noah what was happening you could take that down what was happening in the days of noah life before the flood for many years prior to the flood noah in his group were preparing the ark in other words the coming of the son of man was taking place during the preparation of the ark the entering into the ark was yes the final step they had to gather oh oh geez they had to first gather the material to build the ark and under the leadership of a prophet under the holy spirit the anointing for that time under the inspiration of that hour they were moved amen to build an ark a certain way so what was that that was the preparing for the time the rain would come they didn't wait to the rain come to start building the ark so after the ark was prepared they had to gather the animals two by two and all those and get them into the ark of safety still no rain fail the going into the yard was just the final stage the call went out during the preparation of the yard the call as it was in the days of noah so shall it be so the call is going out now everybody is looking for a big bang moment no he'll come like a thief in the night i tell you let me go on amen go to if you will because i said last week i wanted to bring this out luke 17 35. luke 17 luke 17 35 it says two women shall be grinding together one shall be taken and the other left two men shall be in the field and the two men shall be in the field the other one shall be taken and the other left and they answered and said unto him where lord and he said unto them whatsoever the body is feather will the eagles be gathered together he didn't say ego they're the egos plural will be gathered together this will take place during the age at the eagle anointing under an eagle anointing when a prophet amen is on the scene amen and the people are being gathered together by this prophet's message being gathered together by this prophets message and the message christ identified the same he says here this message preached in 1964. and now we find that in that in each one of those ages usually people don't want to believe it and just like today usually people don't want to believe it but we're going to get into something watch this because they're already set in their way didn't i tell you what's real important what church you choose let me read here he says he says you they're already setting their way you're turning a corner you're building a building and then get to a corner and everybody is just running this way and they don't want to turn the corner but the building goes that way if the word says it goes that way see there's where we get those junctions of time there's where it's hard that's where men has to sweat it out what happened they get caught up under tradition you're building a building you're building a wall at some point for it to be a building you have to make a turn if you never make a turn all you're doing is building a long wall right so uh uh uh we're in the gospel we're building a building we're building a person we're building a temple right i tried to bring that out last week couple weeks ago with the building of solomon's temple i took from the message on dedication and how the material the material to build the temple was gathered from all over the place each component was special in its own way one wood was called stink wood now maybe no one had anything for that purpose of what it's even in its name it it why would we use this maybe oh no one wanted wants to use but see god has prepared you specifically in your makeup and your your motives and your twerks and everything about you he has designed it specifically to fit joint perfectly in that building allow god to perfectly place you where he wants you to be a lot of times we find we're trying to force ourselves in the places where god never wanted us to be right trying to force yourself i've i find many of you i got no business out here to the club i don't even fit in with these people right but you try to take on their spirit you try to do like them you try and not talk no one you are getting in trouble you trying to fit in and let me tell you something it's obvious when you're trying to fit in they know it everybody else know it the only person don't see it is you that's right when you just trying to fit in be who god made you to be you'll find joy and peace in that trying to do something else trying to be someone else for somebody else it ain't never gonna work he will you are made chosen selected all of your ways and quirks and different things heat's put up now that's exactly right why defeatly put you as a part of this building this temple but remember i said a lot of times we find ourselves in the under the rome in the hands of the wrong contractor under the tutelage amen of a man who says he's a builder but he's not following the blueprint solomon followed the blueprint for that temple amen to build it just like the way moses saw it in heaven amen and you were chosen specifically the materials amen uh uh uh for that you were chosen as part of the material for that building says here now solomon notice solomon never vary one bit from that pattern moses saw it on mount sinai in heaven moses when he returned from his vision under an eagle anointing pitched a tent and made it just exactly the way he saw it in heaven and when solomon built the temple he made it just exactly the way he's seeing the pattern that type moses pitched oh what a full fundamental gospel church that'll stay with the word build it just never get off of the pack build it trust in him amen of his craftsmanship his leadership to able to build this temple hey man for the master to dwell in amen sister if you will turn to john 2. john 2. i won't be before you alone john 2. oh hallelujah now the same temple amen john 2 13 this same temple jesus came to this temple now solomon had built this temple and it was perfect amen jesus came and and blessed it the house was filled with the presence of god and all this temple was was was was looked upon down through the ages but what happened jesus come along and the jews that passover was at hand and found the the jews passover was at hand and jesus went up to jerusalem and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves and the changes of money sitting and when he had made a scourge of small cords he drove them out of the temple and the sheep and the oxen and poured out the changes of money and overthrew the tables and said unto them that soul doves take these things hence make not my father's house a house of merchandise and his disciples remembered that it was written the zeal of the time of thine house has eaten me up now i wanna i wanna i wanna i wanna focus on that he came into that temple and seen that that temple had been defiled so we see what the word the word jesus christ drove those spirits out of the temple now let's go back to the restoration of the bride tree the same way the devil will attack a trade attack individual jesus drove those spirits out of the temple look at the man called legion no doubt don't record what he'd been through how he got those demons but jesus drove those spirits out sometimes we have things in us that need to be driven out because we are the temple amen that he wants to dwell in the church the temple made up of the people the pride that his spirit wants to dwell in so sometimes we have to make sure amen that we drive out those spirits remember behold the bridegroom cometh and he cometh to find that his bride has made herself ready that she's clothed with the right character she's clothed with righteousness she's clothed with righteousness i want keeping that in mind i want you to go to the message total deliverance i want to read something here 1959. this francis was preached in july 1959 by william branham amen paragraph 94 i have it all written near believe and the disciples had total deliverance absolutely total deliverance why because they were completely and totally filled with the holy ghost see when when you just a church member and shook the pastor's hand or some had some kind of little experience of jumping shouting or speaking in tongues or something another and still have malice in your heart strange acts telling lies smoking cigarettes lusting after women and there something hasn't happened yet these things are still in the temple amen something hasn't happened yet there's something wrong for he that loves the world and the things of the world the love of god is not in him you've been mis you've been misled now i started out by saying how important it is and how honestly you should pray when choosing it's not just something that you haphazardly do oh i want to go here cause they got a good debate here that ain't how you choose a church i want to go here because the people seem so nice you have been misled by the fruits you shall know them we are we all want to be unified together with the holy spirit every member should be unified one with the other the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost it cleanses us from all unrighteousness and all unrighteousness we are delivered from the things of the world jesus said this will all men know that you're my disciples when you got love one for the other when one member loves other members so much that it would die for it that's heaven when one evil thing starts the outside world some women come along and say now look dear it would be better for you if you did this or do that wore this or did that done this and got away from that bunch of holy rollers or and so forth like that we are so unified with god you say brother branham it's an awful temptation but christ died for that purpose my god the devil is defeated we want total deliverance we want a church that is pure clean and unadulterated washed in the blood of the lamb filled with the holy spirit signs wonders and miracles total delivery everyone everyone that's our goal to present a bride we're we're only responsible for this local church now see this is this is this is preached on two dimensions personally and locally where i was talking about the gathering of together what binds us the mortar boundary what is that the love of god a bonding agent has been placed between us what the love of god that binds us together under the holy spirit that if you begin to pull away you can't go because we're bonded so tightly when you struggle i struggle when you sway the winds of turmoil may blow on the wall bling ball in the building we all work in unison and move together praise god but it don't break us cause we have been bonded together through real christian love under the holy spirit amen that is preparing the temple man of christ to present to him a blo a bride without a spot without a blemish without one spot without one wrinkle who's clothed and ready to meet her isaac amen now we see here where the devil comes to pervert amen and and it shows here in in the message oneness of unity how you know satan is putting together he's he's he's doing some work too he's he's he wants to be he's a perverter of righteousness he can't create so what he does is try to mimic what he see god doing amen we are and and there's a term called homeostasis i was i called my wife and i said hey what what tell me about this i remember her talking about it and going through medical classes and stuff i looked it up after she explained to me all about it in biology the term homeostasis refers to the ability for the body to maintain stable internal environment despite the changes of its external conditions the stability or balance that is attained is called a dynamic equilibrium that is as change occur the body works to maintain relatively uniform conditions homeostasis we don't want to be too cold the body operates at a certain temperature if we our body gets sick are we in tune with our body man that's what brother quaker was talking about we must be in tune we must be in tune with our body to know when we are out of homeostasis something ain't right i'm talking to the church i'm talking to the individual you should know something ain't right i don't feel quite right i'm a little dizzy or just i just don't feel myself and tired a lot well you may go to the doctor and you're the doctor you have confidence in and you say you tell them your symptoms and you just yeah yeah should check out check me over first thing he does is uh you check your temperature it might be running a little cold and indifferent well if you're running a little cold and indifferent well there's the problem you know your body has to operate at a certain temperature when you get when the body temperature drops and it's not operating at that certain temperature amen you find yourself a little sluggish you find yourself you just don't feel like praising the lord what you got to do is you got to get amongst the saints cigar amen you got to allow yourself to get built back up to a certain temperature amen to where you back in homeostasis sometimes you get a little cold and get a little different i don't want to come to church i don't know those people uh trying to look malice and the devil and see that ain't nothing but that insect watch that insect he coming planting them seeds come planting them eggs in your mind and you begin to think on these things but get a little cold you don't want to worship no more you don't stand and sing the songs of zion hey man you don't feel the warmth amen of the sun you can't get warmed by a painted fire yeah you got to come and you got to get in the presence of the sun amen and and and and getting the right temperature for that egg to hatch it has to sit up under amen the chicken and it has to be kept at the right temperature it can't hatch when it's too cold we don't want to be lukewarm neither the bible say he look long he said i spilled you out my mouth the analogy of the frog in the in in the water those spirits that frog are getting that lukewarm water and he get comfortable if you're lukewarm he'll stay right there amen and it can stay that high that frog in your lukewarm condition sitting there in the lukewarm condition smiling shaking hands but in your heart you're being critical frog in that lukewarm condition you want to maintain a balance 98.7 i believe it is i want to maintain a good temperature and you know what happened when chains enter into the body and there's an infection oh that temperature rises what does that mean that this blood cells are going to where that infection is that and those blood cells are sacrificing their life to kill that infection to keep the body in homeostasis there's a battle going on so the temperature raises oh there's something wrong i need help so what it does it calls a solemn prayer meeting saints all come together praying for sister such and such there's a battle going on the temperature gets a little hotter everybody raised up a little bit why cause there's a battle going on it might be down in my pinky toe but my head knows it my heart knows it my hand knows it my foot knows it if i stump my pinky toe you know what everything in my body compensates for that my hands immediately go down to comfort my toe if i walk with a limp my hip are making adjustments to to balance things out my knees might make a compensation on how i walk just from my pinky toe we are the body of christ we're a bride that is making herself ready under an eagle anointing behold the bridegroom coming have you made yourself ready my brothers and sisters i started out these three wednesdays i was just trying to point out what i see the devil doing and to give he warning that i see a spirit that is trying to creep in to make the body sick through these last few through 20 20. here we are 2020 under a prophetic anointing a vision and he really unleashed an attack in 2020 make no mistake about it it was not an attack against the united states russia china it was an attack against the bride of jesus christ these are demonic spirits that came from the pits of the bottomless pit to do what to divide and cause turmoil amongst the body but shall the temperature be raised and we come together united in love amen pray one for the other amen so that the body can remain in homeostasis so that god has a bride that has made herself ready behold the bridegroom comments amen thank you hey man let us pray and bring it to a close at this hour amen most gracious heavenly father lord i thank you father for allowing me lord to lord god just giving me

close things out amen praise the lord uh god bless you saints uh certainly thank god for everyone joining us online tonight and had a i believe that was a wonderful thought that brother troy brought to us tonight on behold the bridegroom cometh that thought on homeostasis um i hope we're catching spiritually what he is uh telling us that he read the definition there uh internally we're trying to fight the things that are coming at us externally and uh and there's so much in 2020 that has been thrown at the body of christ externally and if you're not spiritual you will miss what god is actually doing you know in this hour so we can't have our attention on all the news and uh everything that's happening on facebook or you know everything that's happening in social media all of that is nonsense amen we got to keep our attention on what the lord is doing him and uh and and just a mere title said behold the break room cometh you know and when when the brock rooms come in those virgins had to be in a certain place and ready praise god they had to have oil in their lamps the holy ghost and uh you know so that this is a thing where we want to make sure that we're we're we're prepared we're ready for what the lord is doing in this hour uh i believe that the coming of the lord is closer than it has ever been and uh and one thing i want to do is keep my eyes on christ so i want to encourage you to do that i i thank god for the word of the lord tonight and just just so much was shared there so much was shared that i know it was the lord speaking to his people uh i wanted to just quickly mention a couple things i noted at the beginning of our stream tonight and we talk about the virtual streaming here through periscope and facebook periscope just announced i believe yesterday that they are going to be stopping streaming they're not going to be doing that i think as of uh march or something like that of 2021 so if you try to use periscope you may get an error i know that happened tonight periscope is telling you to start using twitter uh we uh we are not on that platform we're not sure what you know uh what to expect so i want to encourage if you run into a problem with periscope please go to our facebook sat tabernacles how you would find us amen there in facebook we will continue to work through some of these issues to try to make sure that you have a good experience as we go forward but keep us in prayer we will uh we'll work through it uh um i wanted to come tonight to uh just thank you for your prayers we are um much better the enemy uh is defeated we read that brother troy read that quote tonight the devil's defeated and he's certainly defeated uh in me and i'm grateful for your prayers and we're looking forward to being back in service everybody welcome back to the house of god on sunday at 10 30 a.m uh we will be uh welcoming everyone back a man to the house of god and uh i have um i had the opportunity last week in the government visit with brother uh steaming and amen the church there and we had some wonderful services and and i was telling them there are certain things that happen in church when we all come together that will not happen while you're at home streaming and uh you know what happens is that we come and we're elevated to heavenly places the word of god actually elevates us as we're saying a man to the word and responding to the word it's taking us places that we won't get at home you know and so when we come here and you know uh we we we just experienced this one of the most powerful services that we ever had in this church occurred in 2020 praise the lord amen where the devil trying to divide us god gave us one of the most powerful services we ever had and if there's anything that should be happening now our our expectations should actually rise look if god could do it before then i know he can do it again if we come with the right expectations so you know i i i was just you know sharing a few things there sharing a testimony over there with uh brother brother steaming them and and as we were coming towards the end of the service on sunday morning i read a quote that i read here at the church uh where brother random say i defy sickness i defy disease i defy i defy homeostasis right i defy it and and as uh and you know and we were we preached a sermon on uh built up in the faith for this hour you know and i remember when we preached that uh we read that quote and how the holy spirit destructs us to rachel and stuck struck sister liz and they just began to shout and and and the lord just had us take that same sermon over the uh uh to sarasota and i hit that same quote and my god how do saints begin to run around the church now you know i can't see you running around your living room praise god amen and most of us not running around the living room because the anointing is not there the way that you would find it here praise god so that's why that's why it's so important that we get what brother trump was trying to share with us you know don't let the devil eat away at the fellowship it's the devil amen it's the devil covert is a devil it's just got a name right but it's a devil any sickness is a devil that is attacking the people so don't be afraid of these things let's not walk in fear let's walk in faith god wants us to walk in faith in and we're going to have to have faith in this hour we're going to have to have faith we're not talking about being foolish but we got to have some faith praise the lord amen amen amen i i i'm one and i'll just be honest i i think what has been released is here to stay and we're gonna have to learn how to work around and work with this you know uh just like there's been other diseases the flu is here to stay we're not getting rid of the flu right and uh you know i mean people catching colds that's here to stay you know so so we have to learn how to work around and we just need wisdom the wisdom of god or how to work around it the jobs are working around it the church gonna have to be able to work around it praise the lord so uh help us we pray to the lord help us new year's eve watch

the word that was spoken to our hearts on tonight uh behold the bright groom cometh lord and just uh even from the very beginning the scripture that was read there in genesis and and how um rebecca was actually appointed eliezer knew that this he couldn't do this on his own so he said lord you had already shaped this particular young lady you have formed her you have made her so once she heard the testimony of eleazar then she would uh come underneath that eagle anointing praise god amen she would begin to prepare herself because as eliezer was coming to her underneath the eagle anointing what the prophet abraham had shared with him now he's coming to her and lord she was already prepared to subject herself lord to the eagle anointed father you have people today that are ready to subject himself to an eagle anointing hallelujah what uh we know that you sent us a prophet in this hour according to malachi 4 according to revelation 10 according to luke 17 scriptures that are in the bible you promised certain things what happened in this in this last day god the other thing that we heard here tonight is that where the carcass is the egos will gather not just ego but egos will gather so look father let the eagles come and feed on the word of god get strength for their amen for their journey oh god is our prayer lord we pray that you bless our giving tonight as we give from our hearts lord we actually use it for the furthest of your kingdom we also want to lift up brother jeff and pray who acts with prayer god you know exactly what it's going through we exit to it touch his body we have seen you heal our precious brother before we know that you're able to do it again there is nothing too hard for you oh god so we commit brother jeff into your hands tonight and lord we just pray that you just continue to watch over the stains thank you for touching my body lord and allow me to be able to come back into the house of god i'm so happy lord that you've given me strength amen to be able to return so i pray that the spirit of god would meet us in a very special way as we come together on sunday morning lord may you just met your anointing father lord just come and and just do great things in our midst we've seen you do it before we ask that you'll do it again i remember the story father the man that was eating watermelon somebody asked him says that is that good he said yeah but it's got to be more where that came from and father we can look back and say yes we've had some great services but it's got to be more where that came from so we pray that the spirit of god would move lord uh in a very special way let us come under an anointing an expectation to see you move in this place of god be glorified be magnified keep us until we're able to meet one another again it's in jesus christ's name that we pray amen and amen the lord richly bless you amen we will see you on sunday morning at 10 30. god bless you [Music] you
