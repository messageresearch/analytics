[29:54] uh encouraging us as we see the Lord
[29:57] moving don't don't don't fight it and
[29:59] brother brandom you know he he was he
[30:01] made a statement says when you see a a
[30:03] man with the ball and he was given a
[30:06] football analogy he says if you're if
[30:08] the guy running with the ball you don't
[30:10] as a he's on your team you don't run to
[30:13] him and try to take it from him but you

[30:18] goal line you know the Finish Line the
[30:20] the a touchdown you know that's what
[30:22] that's what the objective is and so you
[30:25] know we want to we want to Rally around
[30:27] what God is doing this hour amen and not
[30:29] not not say things and do things that's
[30:32] going to go against what God is doing
[30:33] you know we know we got to watch out for
[30:36] stuff we've been talking about that we
[30:38] don't want things to go into um
[30:40] fanaticism but there's a right way to do
[30:43] things and what we're trying to do is
[30:44] find that right way to do things and I
[30:46] believe God showed us that on Sunday
[30:48] that there he found the we found the
[30:50] right way and he come down and manifest
[30:52] himself so may he continue to manifest
[30:55] uh himself I'm so glad amen this weekend
[30:59] um to have uh my dear friend and you
[31:03] know we were just kind of talking
[31:04] brother
[31:05] Trevor I've been on the journey with him
[31:07] and he's been on the journey with me for
[31:09] for years for years and um and just what
[31:13] I've seen that Lord do in his life I
[31:16] remember when he used to come years ago
[31:17] my my daddy uh told me he said you know
[31:21] my favorite preacher is brother Trevor
[31:24] now my daddy telling me that I'm like
[31:26] well uh
[31:28] that where where does that leave
[31:30] me but I he was saying it because
[31:33] brother Trevor is so relatable you know
[31:36] and uh just the way the Lord uses his
[31:38] ministry cuz my dad comes from a
[31:39] background where they used to make this
[31:41] message so
[31:43] mysterious it was so mysterious that
[31:46] nobody could understand what they were
[31:48] saying the titles were mysterious we had
[31:51] no idea what the title even meant right

[36:28] amen here in South Florida and West Palm
[36:32] Beach amen among my good friends
[36:37] amen acts chap 1 we'll look at verses
[36:41] 6-8 when they were therefore come
[36:43] together they asked him saying Lord wil
[36:46] thou at this time restore again the
[36:48] kingdom to Israel and he said unto them
[36:50] it's not for you to know the times or
[36:52] Seasons which the father hath put in his
[36:54] own power but ye shall receive power
[36:57] after the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[36:59] and ye shall be Witnesses unto me both
[37:00] in Jerusalem and in all Judea and
[37:03] Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of
[37:06] the earth um just before we turn to Luke
[37:08] chapter 17 just a couple of comments
[37:11] they what were they looking for they
[37:12] were looking for the restoration of the
[37:15] kingdom of heaven right that's what they
[37:18] wanted Lord restore the Kingdom right
[37:22] right but he says it's it it's not for
[37:24] you to know the times or seasons and and
[37:27] it's almost as if he doesn't answer the
[37:29] question but he does answer the question
[37:30] he says you're going to receive power
[37:33] after the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[37:35] and when that Holy Ghost is upon you
[37:37] you're going to be Witnesses all right
[37:40] so turn to Luke chapter 17 just before
[37:43] we have
[37:48] prayer neither shall they say Lo here
[37:50] sorry Luke chapter 17 verse 21 guess I
[37:54] should tell you that part neither shall
[37:56] they say Lo here Lo there behold the
[37:58] kingdom of God is within you so they
[38:02] wanted to restore the kingdom of
[38:05] heaven but where did he say the kingdom
[38:07] of heaven
[38:09] was yes sir so if it's if the Kingdom of
[38:11] Heaven is within you and it's going to
[38:13] be restored where should we expect it to
[38:16] be restored all right that's what I'm
[38:19] talking about instant replay cam this
[38:21] brother right here thank you okay let's
[38:24] just go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly

[38:55] come up to you when that trumpet it
[38:57] sounds we love you father bless our
[38:59] service now in the name of the Lord
[39:00] Jesus Christ amen amen amen amen you may
[39:03] be
[39:07] seated so
[39:10] um just a little disclaimer before we
[39:13] get going too far uh I think it was back
[39:15] in March um brother Jack and I were
[39:17] talking and um I was just relating to
[39:20] him an experience that I had um at this
[39:23] church and something that the lord gave
[39:25] to me and I was just starting to speak
[39:27] to it and I was like you know I just
[39:28] just had this thought of restoration and
[39:30] just started you know telling him a
[39:32] little bit about it and you know he did
[39:35] what brother Jack does and he started
[39:36] going woo
[39:39] brother brother brother brother and he
[39:42] told me that it was your all's theme
[39:45] this year for restoration and so he said
[39:48] we're just going to have to get you down
[39:50] and we're going to have to do this and
[39:52] so we've been trying to to make it
[39:54] happen but um and but here it is you
[39:56] know so if you're if you're thinking
[39:59] that wow like how did he know well we
[40:02] just it's been a long time coming so I I
[40:05] knew the theme was restoration so I just
[40:08] you know glory the lord it's just as
[40:11] Supernatural as ever it just that that
[40:14] happened months ago and not like right
[40:16] now all right so that you can know that
[40:18] um couple of couple of caveats um just
[40:21] as we kind of go through some of this
[40:23] content I I I want everybody to
[40:25] understand uh very very much that though
[40:27] I want to talk about the Kingdom of
[40:29] Heaven being within you that does not
[40:31] mean that I am not expecting the literal
[40:34] coming of the Lord Jesus Christ to take
[40:36] us home with him to meet him in the air
[40:39] I am expecting that I am not
[40:40] spiritualizing all of this in any way I
[40:44] actually I don't know more than
[40:46] spiritualizing it I want to almost
[40:47] emotionalize it but not emotion in the
[40:49] in the in the in the sense of happiness
[40:51] or crying but actually in the sense of
[40:54] the fruits of the spirit in your heart
[40:56] amen okay so I believe those should be
[40:58] restored in our lives right so I and so
[41:01] and and so from that context I believe
[41:03] Jesus is saying behold the kingdom of
[41:04] God is within you um so that's that's
[41:07] kind of how I want to approach this a
[41:09] little bit tonight and I feel like there
[41:10] was one other thing oh and then as I
[41:12] talk about us being in him before the
[41:14] foundation of the world um I don't
[41:17] believe in the preexistence of souls all
[41:20] right but if you can tell me where Jesus
[41:24] died before the foundation of the world
[41:27] then I'll tell you where I was amen
[41:30] before the foundation of the world does
[41:32] that does that work out okay so just
[41:34] cover some doctrinal basis so that no
[41:36] one misunderstands cuz that's happened
[41:38] before and I just want to make sure that
[41:40] that's all very very clear come on is
[41:43] that all right okay John Chapter 13 I'd
[41:45] like to look at here as we approach our
[41:48] our thought
[41:50] together so I like it everybody's happy
[41:53] people are smiling it's wonderful yes
[41:56] sir we have plenty to be happy about
[42:00] amen John chap 13 we're going to start
[42:03] at verse
[42:22] 33 all right John Chap
[42:25] 13:33 and we're going to continue on
[42:27] into 14 little children yet a little
[42:31] while I Am with You ye shall seek me and
[42:34] as I said unto the Jews whether I go ye
[42:37] cannot come so now I say to you we on we
[42:42] together yeah John 13:33 okay perfect a
[42:44] new commandment I give unto you that ye
[42:46] love one another as I have loved you
[42:48] that you also love one another by this
[42:50] shall all men know that you're my
[42:51] disciples if you have love one to
[42:54] another Simon Peter said unto him Lord
[42:56] wither go thou Jesus answered him
[42:58] whether I go thou cast not follow me now
[43:01] but Thou shalt follow me afterwards
[43:04] Peter said unto him Lord why can I not
[43:06] follow thee now I will lay down my life
[43:09] for thy sake and Jesus answered him wil
[43:11] thou lay down thy life for my sake
[43:14] verily verily I say unto thee the
[43:15] shall not Crow till thou Hast denied me
[43:17] Thrice continuing on into verse 14 into
[43:20] chapter 14 this the same conversation
[43:23] here let not your heart be troubled ye
[43:25] believe in God believe also in me in my
[43:27] father's house are many mansions if it
[43:30] were not so I would have told you I go
[43:32] to prepare a place for you and if I go
[43:34] and prepare a place for you I will come
[43:36] again and receive you unto myself that
[43:39] where I am there ye may be also and
[43:42] whether I go ye know and the way ye know
[43:46] Thomas say unto him
[43:48] Lord we know not whether thou goest and
[43:52] how can we know the way Jesus saith unto
[43:54] him I am the way the truth and the life
[43:57] no man cometh unto the father but by me
[44:00] if ye had known me ye should have known
[44:02] my father also and from henceforth ye
[44:04] know him and have seen him so we look at
[44:07] this scripture and Jesus has been
[44:10] telling his disciples you know uh in
[44:13] veiled language and getting less veiled
[44:16] and more concrete that he was going to
[44:18] leave and that that was starting to look
[44:21] like he that meant he was going to die
[44:23] and of course they couldn't understand
[44:25] this they wanted him to stick around and
[44:28] you know eventually Drive the Romans out
[44:29] that's what everybody wanted everyone
[44:31] wanted the restoration of the Kingdom of
[44:33] Israel which meant we want things like
[44:35] it was in the days of Solomon when all
[44:37] the gold was here and silver count was
[44:39] counted as nothing and Israel was the
[44:41] you know the the center point of the
[44:44] entire Commerce and and and of the
[44:46] politics and culture of the world that's
[44:48] right and that's what they were looking
[44:50] for and and so they realized they they
[44:52] felt like they had a problem with Romans
[44:54] and that was the biggest problem they
[44:56] had because after after all they had the
[44:58] the word of Moses wow um and from the
[45:00] word of Moses they had developed a very
[45:02] strong and uh deliberate Moses culture
[45:05] yes yes and they all were well versed in
[45:09] moses' culture and and so they you know
[45:12] they felt like things were going along
[45:14] just fine the only issue they really had
[45:17] was a Romans problem and if they could
[45:19] get rid of the Romans then that would
[45:21] solidify their place again they could
[45:23] just be free people they could rule
[45:25] themselves again then you know
[45:27] everything else that that would be the
[45:29] restoration of the kingdom and so that's
[45:31] what they were looking for and and
[45:32] that's what they kind of wanted and then
[45:34] but then Jesus now he's he's kind of
[45:37] throwing them curveballs and he's saying
[45:39] look I'm going away and they're like who
[45:41] you have a few things you you're I just
[45:44] don't no if you know
[45:48] Jesus but um we believe you're Messiah
[45:52] right come on now you have you have
[45:54] spent so long convincing us that you're
[45:56] a messiah right and so this like and and
[46:01] we know what Messiah is supposed to do
[46:03] all right he is supposed to drive out
[46:05] the Romans all right come on now so you
[46:08] got some things left to do and he didn't
[46:11] tell them this but he's like yes uhhuh
[46:13] that's fine I'll I'll do it on my second
[46:14] coming no no problem and they didn't
[46:18] understand that there was two comings
[46:19] thank God we have a prophet and we live
[46:21] in a day we can look back we see all of
[46:24] these things now right that's right but
[46:26] they they didn't have the ability to see
[46:28] these things and so I'd like if we could
[46:30] just start to just try to put ourselves
[46:32] in the in the disciples shoes this
[46:34] evening and and begin to think what does
[46:36] this conversation must have gone like
[46:38] and how do you think and how do you feel
[46:41] if you're one of the disciples there and
[46:43] he's saying I'm going away and um but
[46:47] where I go you can't
[46:49] come and it's like well we wanted to
[46:52] like but we wanted to keep following you
[46:55] come on it's like well you can't come
[46:57] yet whether I go you can't follow me now
[47:00] wow wow you see you see before you can
[47:04] go to where I'm
[47:06] going I got to go first right amen
[47:11] because there's something I but you're
[47:12] going to come
[47:14] later because there's something I have
[47:17] now that I have to go away so that you
[47:21] can have it later
[47:24] glor am Glory yes sir
[47:27] right sir if the kingdom is going to be
[47:30] restored in you well where's the kingdom
[47:34] now my God
[47:37] hallelujah amen but you can follow me
[47:40] afterwards yes sir sir well he knows
[47:42] what's about to happen right he knows
[47:44] he's going to die he knows he's going to
[47:46] raise again he knows he's going to pour
[47:47] himself out upon his children and then
[47:51] they can follow him that's right amen
[47:54] glory so he says but let let not your
[47:57] heart be troubled ye believe in
[48:00] God believe also in me amen
[48:04] glory in my father's house are many
[48:07] mansions if it were not so I would have
[48:09] told you I go to prepare a place for you
[48:14] amen I got to make it so that you can
[48:17] come too that's right amen amen amen cuz
[48:21] right now at that moment sitting there
[48:25] on the Mount of Olives I believe it was
[48:27] is they're
[48:28] there they can't go to heaven that's
[48:31] right amen there's no atonement yet for
[48:35] them and more than more than just that
[48:38] there's no atonement that they they they
[48:40] their their their sins could be covered
[48:42] they kept bringing a lamb and bringing a
[48:44] lamb and bringing a lamb but the
[48:46] restoration of the Kingdom in their
[48:48] heart still couldn't come cuz Paul tells
[48:51] us in Hebrews chapters 9 chapters 10
[48:53] that the worshipper once purged still
[48:56] had the I of sins when they well you
[48:59] know when they brought the lamb they
[49:00] still had conscience of sins but now
[49:03] because of Jesus Christ one time the
[49:07] worshipper Pur has no more conscience of
[49:11] sins prise God no more identity with
[49:15] sins they may struggle in their flesh
[49:18] they may up and down but inside of them
[49:21] there is no more identity no more
[49:24] conscience of that sin that sin's no
[49:26] longer a part of who they are amen amen
[49:30] hallelujah amen so I got to go and
[49:33] prepare a place for you amen yes sir but
[49:36] if I and if I go and prepare a place I
[49:40] will come again and receive you unto
[49:45] myself that where I am ye may be also
[49:49] glory and whether I go you again put
[49:53] yourself in the disciple shoes here try
[49:56] to strip away all of your message
[49:58] understanding and all of your Gentile
[50:00] understanding Jesus has not died yet you
[50:03] know the the Paul's letters have not yet
[50:05] been written all right brother brandham
[50:08] has not yet come right and you're
[50:10] standing there and Jesus is like but you
[50:13] know where I'm going oh and you know how
[50:15] to get
[50:18] there my and Thomas you know we give him
[50:22] a bad time because he's you know
[50:23] doubting Thomas and all that but in this
[50:25] chapter like Thomas is my man cuz like
[50:29] like he cuz he asks the question I'm
[50:31] like I think I would have been Thomas
[50:33] because I just have that knack for
[50:35] asking the question everyone else is
[50:37] thinking but no one else had the courage
[50:39] to actually say come on and and so
[50:43] Thomas so thank you Jesus for
[50:46] Thomas
[50:49] Lord we don't know where you're
[50:52] going just Lord come on brother it's not
[50:56] you Lord it's us you're a fine teacher
[50:58] Jesus we're just not kidding we have no
[51:01] idea where you're going right now I
[51:04] just and I have no that's the truth no
[51:07] idea how to get there that's the truth
[51:10] like if you Jesus if you want to tell us
[51:12] you're going to you're headed to
[51:12] Jerusalem and you want us to come later
[51:15] no problem I know where Jerusalem is I
[51:17] just need to know that you're going to
[51:18] Jerusalem and I know how to get to
[51:20] Jerusalem so I know the way if it's like
[51:22] Jerusalem or Bethany lazarus's house
[51:25] maybe you know where we headed Jesus
[51:27] because but right now I have no idea
[51:30] where you're going and if I don't know
[51:31] where you're going how can I figure out
[51:34] how to get there
[51:35] wow wow cuz it sounds like you're going
[51:38] to go die and then you're telling us we
[51:40] shouldn't do that come
[51:49] on or maybe that's just my
[51:55] brain and Jes Jesus answers the
[51:57] question but he doesn't answer where
[52:00] he's going he answers how to get there
[52:04] yes sir and when he answers how you can
[52:06] get there he'll tell you where he's
[52:11] going and he says I am the way the truth
[52:16] and the life no man cometh unto the
[52:18] father but by me so what is he telling
[52:22] you if he had known me he should have
[52:24] known my father also from hence forth
[52:26] you know him and have seen him he's
[52:29] saying I am the way and we're and if and
[52:32] if and if you're going to get to the
[52:33] father I'm the way
[52:35] there and so he tells us that's me I am
[52:39] the way I just I just love how many
[52:42] times Jesus says I am something and I in
[52:46] my mind especially when he's talking to
[52:47] the Pharisees I always I always just
[52:49] feel like he's always just like I
[52:52] am the true bread like I I always feel
[52:56] like surely he paused every single time
[52:58] like surely he was just like I am and
[53:02] then mine's like finished that I am and
[53:03] then he says you know the true bread I
[53:06] am the Water of Life you know I just I
[53:08] don't know so Jesus says I am the way
[53:12] right the way to what glory to God
[53:21] yes tell you
[53:23] what find the way amen it'll take you to
[53:27] where you're going right right yes sir
[53:31] so what is he telling us if he's saying
[53:33] I am the way and and then and then he's
[53:35] saying I'm going to this place I'm going
[53:37] to prepare these Mansions but if but I
[53:39] am the way and if you knew me you'd know
[53:41] my father so if if where you're trying
[53:43] to get to is God himself I'm the way I
[53:48] am if you've seen me you've seen the
[53:51] father so so what he's telling us here
[53:54] is you know and it's so funny because we
[53:57] have to wait till 1963 before we
[53:59] actually understand or 64 I think before
[54:02] we actually really start understanding
[54:04] this and we get messages like Christ is
[54:06] the mystery of God
[54:07] revealed we get messages like unveiling
[54:10] of God and mighty God unveiled before us
[54:14] and what is he telling us well he's
[54:16] telling us that there's you know where's
[54:18] the quote here here we go Christ is the
[54:19] mystery
[54:21] 1963 that that God he says in the back
[54:24] part of his mind before the foundation
[54:26] of the world world had a threefold
[54:28] purpose there was three things he wanted
[54:31] to do so first to express himself
[54:36] completely
[54:37] amen so so before I even finish that
[54:40] statement I want to say like he says to
[54:43] express himself completely now let me
[54:46] ask you after God created the sun and
[54:48] the moon and the stars after he created
[54:50] the world and he created all life that
[54:53] was in there and everything that's there
[54:55] and he creates the Garden of Eden and
[54:57] sticks Adam and Eve there has he
[54:59] expressed himself completely
[55:01] yet no sir it's been a lot of expression
[55:05] yes sir he's created galaxies upon
[55:08] galaxies upon galaxies brother to ex to
[55:13] express the the the vastness of who he
[55:17] is think about it but has he expressed
[55:20] himself
[55:21] completely not yet come on brother first
[55:25] to express him self completely God in
[55:29] Christ oh my come on until he expresses
[55:34] Christ he has not expressed himself
[55:37] completely all right now as he writes
[55:40] his first Bible in the skies has he
[55:43] expressed himself completely no no he
[55:46] hasn't as he begins to dictate to Moses
[55:50] to write the first five books of the
[55:52] Bible and go all the way back to Adam
[55:55] and everything that happen happed in the
[55:56] Garden of Eden and Moses uhhuh yeah okay
[55:59] right I got that down okay Enoch went up
[56:02] oh man that must have been great and
[56:03] okay I got this stuff down I got it all
[56:05] down all the way up to you know Moses
[56:07] was a Meek man Lord okay if you want me
[56:08] to write that that's fine you know and
[56:11] and he's writing all this
[56:14] down and then David
[56:17] comes pens the
[56:19] Psalms Solomon comes Song of Solomon the
[56:24] great love story yes sir is written
[56:27] right all of these things the wisdom of
[56:30] Solomon written down in Proverbs Glory
[56:33] has God expressed himself completely yet
[56:36] sir has he expressed
[56:39] himself oh he's expressed a lot but even
[56:43] in the expression of God as God is is
[56:45] expressing who he is because that's
[56:48] that's his whole purpose and what he's
[56:50] been doing is to express himself so he's
[56:53] been showing people from from the from
[56:56] the the foundation of the world who he
[56:58] is that's that's been his purpose and so
[57:01] but then the the the Pharisees and the
[57:04] Sadducees and the scribes they pick up
[57:06] this
[57:07] expression and what do they do with
[57:12] it they take the partial
[57:15] expression now at this point before
[57:19] Jesus comes was God love yes has he is
[57:23] has he has he been expressing himself as
[57:26] love to this point yes amen was God
[57:29] righteous yes had he been expressing his
[57:32] righteousness amen was God Justice and
[57:36] he had been expressing his Justice was
[57:39] he Holiness and he'd been expressing
[57:41] himself as holy Glory was he peace yes
[57:46] was he Joy were these things being
[57:49] expressed then someone tell me how on
[57:52] Earth were those Pharisees so clueless
[57:55] as to miss the expression of God as to
[57:58] turn it into such works and such laws
[58:01] and and almost the exact opposite of
[58:04] everything God had been trying to
[58:06] express
[58:08] Lord they got it it was expressed but
[58:11] they got it wrong why cuz God had not
[58:14] yet and God was even showing us that all
[58:17] of these things until I can express it
[58:20] completely and step down into human
[58:23] flesh you still don't understand the
[58:27] picture
[58:29] amen amen but then he comes to Mary and
[58:33] speaks a word and Mary by faith receives
[58:36] that word and it begins to grow in her
[58:39] in her womb and and God comes and he
[58:42] steps that's the created body of God
[58:45] created by the spoken word of God being
[58:48] believed the very blood and flesh of God
[58:51] himself that's right amen that's right
[58:54] and God steps in to that just as he
[58:58] expressed himself in Genesis 1:1 and
[59:00] said let there be light and a logos came
[59:03] out was a spiritual expression of who he
[59:07] was but then in
[59:09] bc4 glory in a little manger in
[59:13] Bethlehem all
[59:15] right the same thing that was expressed
[59:18] as logos and spirit form now is
[59:21] expressed in flesh body
[59:24] form and suddenly God has expressed
[59:27] himself
[59:29] completely because now you can see that
[59:33] everything that he was what that meant
[59:36] not just to the cosmos but what it meant
[59:39] to a human being Glory last I check
[59:44] right you human sir oh God praise
[59:47] God hallelujah we haven't found alien
[59:50] life yet all
[59:52] right so what does that mean God
[59:55] expressing himself in the same form that
[59:58] you and I are in which means that the
[1:00:00] the the the complete picture if we
[1:00:03] wanted to understand what God when you
[1:00:06] express all of this what does it mean to
[1:00:08] a human being well now we know because
[1:00:12] he came and expressed himself completely
[1:00:15] God in Christ do you want to know what
[1:00:17] the Holiness of God looks
[1:00:21] like look no further than Jesus Christ
[1:00:25] do you want to see what the justice of
[1:00:27] God looks like oh the Pharisees oh we
[1:00:29] know what the justice of God looks like
[1:00:31] big
[1:00:33] Stones bashes people's heads in when
[1:00:35] they do wrong that's justice of God you
[1:00:38] want to know what the justice of God
[1:00:39] looks like
[1:00:41] huh start writing on the
[1:00:43] ground my God Amen he that's without sin
[1:00:46] cast the first stone amen yes sir yes
[1:00:49] sir you want Justice let's do True
[1:00:51] Justice who among you deserves to die
[1:00:58] yes
[1:00:59] sir you see now all of the go everything
[1:01:02] that God was trying to express that was
[1:01:04] in the back part of his mind about I
[1:01:06] want to see I want people to see who I
[1:01:08] am and so he begins to express it but
[1:01:10] that expression was never complete until
[1:01:13] he steps onto this Earth in body form
[1:01:15] and suddenly we see all that God was
[1:01:17] trying to express in the form in which
[1:01:20] we can truly understand that expression
[1:01:23] in and so then second he says to have
[1:01:27] the
[1:01:28] preeminence by this in his church which
[1:01:32] is in which is his body that's it the
[1:01:35] bride till he could have the
[1:01:37] preeminence to express himself Glory
[1:01:42] through them that's it brother amen you
[1:01:45] see now we go back to acts that we read
[1:01:47] and he said but Power will come unto you
[1:01:50] and I will make you Witnesses right true
[1:01:53] what what what not just not look not
[1:01:55] just like yes go and deliver tracks and
[1:01:58] tell people Jesus came but what but I'm
[1:02:01] talking but more than that more than
[1:02:04] just more than just man age
[1:02:07] evangelicalism
[1:02:09] and you know great revivals and all of
[1:02:12] this more than that be the expression of
[1:02:15] who Jesus Christ was now in you because
[1:02:18] the Holy Spirit has lived in in your
[1:02:21] heart and now the expression of who he
[1:02:24] is is coming from from through him out
[1:02:27] of you and all those other prepositions
[1:02:30] that I can't get
[1:02:33] out
[1:02:36] glory and that's who you are that's
[1:02:38] right and that's the kingdom of God
[1:02:40] coming inside of you the Kingdom of
[1:02:43] Heaven is in you amen and that's what
[1:02:45] he's trying to do and so thirdly to
[1:02:47] restore the kingdom all right to its
[1:02:51] rightly position that's it that's it so
[1:02:54] the kingdom used to have a position that
[1:02:57] needs to be restored how did it how did
[1:02:59] it lose that position that fell by sin
[1:03:02] all right the first Adam back to where
[1:03:04] he walked in the cool of the evening
[1:03:06] with with his people talked with him
[1:03:08] fellowshipped with them they got it all
[1:03:10] wrong the kingdom has nothing to do with
[1:03:12] Romans being in Israel or not the
[1:03:15] Kingdom of Heaven has everything to do
[1:03:17] with is he walking in and with
[1:03:20] you praise God Amen have you seen the
[1:03:25] express
[1:03:26] and has that expression come in and
[1:03:29] through
[1:03:30] you this is the restoration of the
[1:03:32] Kingdom o try not to get on Sunday's
[1:03:38] notes so so so this is the the
[1:03:42] progression that we're talking about we
[1:03:43] see the father we see that he's
[1:03:46] expressed himself right we see the
[1:03:48] father there but but but we know there's
[1:03:51] more we there there's got to be some way
[1:03:53] we can see it better because Weck its
[1:03:56] manifestation as when God expresses
[1:03:58] himself in spirit form and expresses
[1:04:00] these galaxies we we we we can only
[1:04:03] grasp it at who he is and try to take
[1:04:06] things and and understand bits and
[1:04:08] pieces but we can't put it all together
[1:04:10] so so we we we can only know in part
[1:04:14] because we don't exactly see how it all
[1:04:17] works but then we see the sun and the
[1:04:20] manifestation of all that the father was
[1:04:23] all that that that he could be
[1:04:26] amen I'm talking about
[1:04:28] the the
[1:04:31] potentials the the the the the my how do
[1:04:35] you express it in words the the power
[1:04:38] the the the the all that God was you
[1:04:41] know that that could that could
[1:04:42] literally just breathe out galaxies now
[1:04:45] that much power that much
[1:04:49] Essence is now being placed in the Sun
[1:04:54] so that all that power and expression is
[1:04:57] can be there laid inside of Jesus Christ
[1:05:01] so that you can see I mean can you can
[1:05:03] you just imagine being one of the
[1:05:05] disciples and hey Jesus you know you
[1:05:08] know I I learned a few things about
[1:05:10] astronomy I'm not too educated Jesus but
[1:05:12] I I learned a few things about
[1:05:14] astronomy and uh and did you know that
[1:05:17] star right there that's this star and
[1:05:19] it's in this
[1:05:20] constellation and you're trying to tell
[1:05:22] Jesus about one of the stars in in the
[1:05:26] sky that you can see and Jesus is like
[1:05:29] oh yeah that's
[1:05:32] reallyy
[1:05:34] really come on and Jesus is like you
[1:05:37] know I created about 300 others that are
[1:05:41] exactly like that one and I sprinkled
[1:05:43] them through all of these other galaxies
[1:05:45] that you can the next closest yeah you
[1:05:47] can't see that one never mind come on
[1:05:49] brother my
[1:05:51] God because all that God was he poured
[1:05:54] into Christ yes his entire everything
[1:05:58] that he was is now like can you imagine
[1:06:00] like latent there in Jesus Christ all
[1:06:03] the power that truly he could say
[1:06:05] Lazarus come forth and it's like it's
[1:06:08] like if we begin to think about that it
[1:06:10] Like H like yeah it's like that was a
[1:06:13] miracle it's like well yeah to us but to
[1:06:17] Jesus with that kind of like all that
[1:06:19] God was right there to say just Lazarus
[1:06:22] come forth It's not a miracle anymore
[1:06:24] it's just obvious
[1:06:25] there is no way Lazarus cannot come for
[1:06:29] my that's right amen amen hallelujah
[1:06:34] like who are we dealing with
[1:06:36] here Lazarus can't stay dead right there
[1:06:39] is no way and so from another's
[1:06:43] perspective it's it's you know it's it's
[1:06:46] just obvious now we look at it and go
[1:06:48] what a miracle it's never been done and
[1:06:50] it's like but yeah but who's talking oh
[1:06:52] yeah yeah that's definitely has to
[1:06:54] happen yeah yeah yeah no
[1:06:56] problem Glory
[1:06:59] hallelujah amen so now we could see all
[1:07:03] of this you know
[1:07:06] and and so we can we we have a standard
[1:07:09] you know we have a we have a we have a
[1:07:11] humanization of all that God
[1:07:14] was so that we can understand that if
[1:07:17] the Kingdom of Heaven is supposed to be
[1:07:19] restored inside of us what is it going
[1:07:21] to look like when that
[1:07:23] happens and there's no Gra grasping at
[1:07:25] straws anymore we absolutely know
[1:07:28] because we see him praise God and so
[1:07:32] seeing and so that's why Jesus is saying
[1:07:34] I am the way do you want to know the
[1:07:37] father I I am I am the complete
[1:07:42] expression of the father do you want to
[1:07:45] get to a place where you know the father
[1:07:48] no well then you should know me
[1:07:51] [Music]
[1:07:52] amen and then if the whole idea was to
[1:07:57] restore the Kingdom of Heaven within you
[1:07:59] because that's what Jesus said the
[1:08:01] Kingdom of Heaven is within you amen and
[1:08:04] the Kingdom of Heaven is what fell by
[1:08:06] sin so now it's within you and it can be
[1:08:09] restored in you that Fellowship can come
[1:08:11] back in you the expression of God can
[1:08:14] start to begin to happen within you yes
[1:08:17] sir amen glory glory so then the full
[1:08:21] potential that was all there there from
[1:08:24] eternity before the found foundation of
[1:08:25] the world begins to be expressed then
[1:08:28] begins to be then comes and is fully
[1:08:30] expressed in Christ then he dies and
[1:08:33] rises again to pour out his Spirit upon
[1:08:35] All Flesh then where is the expression
[1:08:38] then now we have now now now so
[1:08:41] understand like like we have sermons and
[1:08:44] we get we get really happy about these
[1:08:45] things because we start to it's like
[1:08:47] don't you know who you are you're the
[1:08:49] Bride of Jesus Christ come on somebody
[1:08:51] let's get happy amen that is exactly
[1:08:54] what I'm preaching tonight but what I
[1:08:56] want you to understand is is what put
[1:08:59] you there in the first place why that's
[1:09:02] a part why you're the bride it's because
[1:09:05] of the expression of God because God
[1:09:07] wanted to express himself and he's going
[1:09:10] to express himself in his bride so when
[1:09:14] so the whole idea is not just cuz you
[1:09:16] walked in that door and said well I'm in
[1:09:18] a message church I decided I believe God
[1:09:20] sent a prophet boom look at how bright I
[1:09:23] am oh my oh it's when the the the the
[1:09:27] expression the the I'm going to kick
[1:09:29] something it's it's when from before the
[1:09:31] foundation of the world all that God
[1:09:34] was all of that all of that potential
[1:09:39] all of that power he's going to take and
[1:09:42] Express in Jesus Christ then Jes you
[1:09:45] know because look before Jesus died the
[1:09:48] spirit of God could come on like in the
[1:09:50] Jud in judges you know the spirit of God
[1:09:52] moved upon Samson you know spirit of God
[1:09:54] moved did this right but but but was
[1:09:58] that the same that we have now as the
[1:10:00] Holy Spirit Well
[1:10:04] no because that Spirit couldn't you know
[1:10:06] brother brandham said the spirit of the
[1:10:08] Lamb they kept sacrificing a lamb and
[1:10:11] the spirit of the Lamb couldn't come
[1:10:12] back on the
[1:10:15] person but the spirit of a
[1:10:18] human could come back on a person
[1:10:21] Hallelujah and so when Jesus who is God
[1:10:24] God himself expressed rest comes down he
[1:10:27] it's like I I don't know how I don't
[1:10:29] like I don't know how else to express it
[1:10:31] other than to say that Jesus humanized
[1:10:34] the spirit of God so that it could come
[1:10:36] on you thank you Lord amen hallelujah
[1:10:40] hallelujah so that so that look but
[1:10:43] again what's the progression start here
[1:10:45] start start eternity what is coming into
[1:10:48] you he is all that he is he expresses
[1:10:51] into Christ who then now you can have
[1:10:54] that spirit once he dies and resurrects
[1:10:57] and sends the spirit down to Quicken the
[1:10:59] life of God that he put inside of you
[1:11:01] yes sir
[1:11:03] amen because because the Kingdom of
[1:11:05] Heaven is as a grain of a mustard
[1:11:08] seed right and so you may have that
[1:11:10] little Mustard Seed and maybe all you
[1:11:12] are is just a little Mustard Seed of
[1:11:13] that and you don't feel like you're
[1:11:14] amazing and you don't think you're all
[1:11:16] that great and but if that little
[1:11:18] Mustard Seed has been
[1:11:22] quickened then all of the potential
[1:11:25] you know how the prophet says I love
[1:11:27] this part you know how the prophet says
[1:11:29] you know you have in you now the power
[1:11:32] to create a world right and go live on
[1:11:36] it right but of course he says that
[1:11:38] works by a law right but how does the
[1:11:42] prophet know that you have that power in
[1:11:44] you now well well I don't know could it
[1:11:47] be because Jesus himself had the power
[1:11:51] within him to create a world and go live
[1:11:54] on it
[1:11:56] did it's already been done that's right
[1:12:00] he's already showed us the
[1:12:05] way Glory that's right brother Glory so
[1:12:09] so so then if that's true then the full
[1:12:13] potential that we see that was in God
[1:12:16] that now makes it obvious that here's
[1:12:18] Jesus standing here with all of that
[1:12:20] power with all of that potential and
[1:12:22] it's obvious that Lazarus has to rise
[1:12:24] again
[1:12:25] then is now coming to be expressed in
[1:12:28] the body of his Believers praise God
[1:12:32] hallelujah then who are you Amen brother
[1:12:35] then what then what do you have then
[1:12:37] what is he asking of you then then it is
[1:12:40] not that you just come in like then then
[1:12:43] suddenly our purpose is so much more uh
[1:12:46] Rich so much more full than merely
[1:12:48] coming and just hey you know what live
[1:12:50] right okay can you do that brother can
[1:12:52] you just just live right you see all the
[1:12:54] things like keep your hair cut and clean
[1:12:59] and obey your
[1:13:01] daddy but this is right live
[1:13:04] long good you're a Christian good we
[1:13:06] solved all that like no it's like and
[1:13:09] well what else do I do I don't know just
[1:13:10] sit there and be good all right
[1:13:14] that's man if we could just get you that
[1:13:18] far my God there's so much more there's
[1:13:22] so much more yes sir yes sir Express him
[1:13:27] if you are if if you decide to be good
[1:13:29] in your life it's because not because
[1:13:32] well yes it maybe early on it's because
[1:13:34] your parents are are are trying to mold
[1:13:37] you and trying to shape you and trying
[1:13:38] to keep you from all kinds of problems
[1:13:40] that you might get into because he gives
[1:13:42] us the best way to live but but at some
[1:13:45] point in time that way of living isn't
[1:13:47] just a way of living anymore but it is
[1:13:50] actually life it has actually become
[1:13:53] like no I now I I I live this way
[1:13:55] because of of whom I'm
[1:13:58] expressing yes sir blessed be the name
[1:14:02] whom am I expressing the the one that
[1:14:04] was there throughout all eternity amen
[1:14:07] that always was that had that kind of
[1:14:09] power so so 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:14:13] 13 if you would 1 Corinthians 13 we'll
[1:14:15] start at verse 9
[1:14:19] [Music]
[1:14:31] for we know in
[1:14:33] part we prophesy in part but when that
[1:14:37] which is perfect is come then that which
[1:14:39] is in part shall be done away when I was
[1:14:41] a child I spake as a child I understood
[1:14:42] as a child I thought as a child but when
[1:14:45] I became a man I put away childish
[1:14:46] things for now we see through a glass
[1:14:49] Darkly but then face to face now I know
[1:14:52] in part but then I shall
[1:14:56] know even as I am
[1:14:59] known now
[1:15:02] so well you could say well Paul what
[1:15:05] does it matter how you're known doesn't
[1:15:07] it just matter how you know that about
[1:15:11] him but Paul is tying his own identity
[1:15:16] with his ability uh uh uh to know Christ
[1:15:21] come
[1:15:22] on well well why can Paul say then so
[1:15:26] the as if he's saying so then the more I
[1:15:28] know him the more I can be known myself
[1:15:33] all
[1:15:34] right so my identity is tied to who to
[1:15:39] to my ability to know him and the
[1:15:42] greater I know him the more I know about
[1:15:46] him why because because if if the bride
[1:15:49] is the body of Jesus Christ if I am in
[1:15:52] him if my identity is found in him then
[1:15:56] the more I know him the more I know me
[1:16:00] exactly right yes sir Hallelujah exactly
[1:16:03] right amen the more I know his potential
[1:16:07] the more I know my own potential amen
[1:16:10] amen and in this age we find so many
[1:16:13] young people trying to find their
[1:16:14] identity here and there and who am I you
[1:16:17] know I'm just someone you know I'm a I'm
[1:16:20] a I I I'm I'm I'm someone with ADHD or
[1:16:23] I'm someone with this thing or that
[1:16:25] thing and we give all man we give all
[1:16:27] kinds of labels identify Yourself by
[1:16:29] this label and this this label and
[1:16:31] that'll help you cope you know that'll
[1:16:33] that'll help you cope with this thing
[1:16:34] and that thing and then you know you'll
[1:16:35] just you know and then you can you know
[1:16:37] get in front of people and as as a
[1:16:38] person with such and such and such and
[1:16:40] such and you know right uh this is how
[1:16:44] you know I have to live my life as if
[1:16:47] there's no Bal in Gilead as if you know
[1:16:49] as if as if self-discipline wasn't a
[1:16:52] thing as if you know now I'm I'm not
[1:16:55] saying there's not all kinds of mental
[1:16:57] disorders but I'm saying there you know
[1:17:00] they're all kinds of like like we have
[1:17:02] tried to find labels for all of these
[1:17:04] things just so that you'll accept them
[1:17:07] Lord Merc and that is not your
[1:17:09] identity then the other thing is well I
[1:17:12] don't feel this way and I don't feel
[1:17:14] that way and I don't and I just say your
[1:17:16] identity is not your feelings your
[1:17:18] feelings are just feelings you know man
[1:17:21] I I loved it oh couldn't if I can
[1:17:23] remember how
[1:17:25] you know brother um Michael Ray was at a
[1:17:28] at a youth banquet earlier this year and
[1:17:30] he was talking about how you know like
[1:17:33] he he made a comparison of bungee
[1:17:35] jumping you know and if you and if you
[1:17:37] went bu like one day you felt good
[1:17:39] enough you know and so you're feeling
[1:17:40] you anchored that feeling and you felt
[1:17:42] like yeah I'm I'm courageous enough to
[1:17:44] go bungee jumping you know and so you
[1:17:45] anchor that down and then you jump off
[1:17:48] the cliff with this you know anchor for
[1:17:50] your bunge jump you know and then what
[1:17:52] happens if you do the same thing feeling
[1:17:53] a different way
[1:17:56] and I don't have the courage and so now
[1:17:59] I anchor this down and I bungee jump but
[1:18:01] you didn't you know that feeling changed
[1:18:04] and so here's the anchor here's the
[1:18:06] anchor but then you the feeling you
[1:18:08] didn't have the feeling and so then the
[1:18:10] anchor wasn't there anymore and now what
[1:18:12] happens right don't bungee jump off a
[1:18:15] cliff without the Anchor Man and so if
[1:18:17] your anchor is based on your feelings
[1:18:19] and you're going to go bungee jumping
[1:18:20] that's a bad idea you
[1:18:22] should should actually be anchored in
[1:18:24] something
[1:18:27] solid amen amen your identity is not
[1:18:30] your feelings your identity is not who
[1:18:32] you think you are who you feel you are
[1:18:33] who all this because those things change
[1:18:36] then then then man some of us are the
[1:18:38] most bipolar schizophrenic all kinds of
[1:18:40] things like one day we're the greatest
[1:18:42] thing ever and the other the next day
[1:18:43] we're like you know the Biggest Loser
[1:18:45] That Ever Walked the face of the Earth
[1:18:47] and everywhere in between it's the truth
[1:18:50] brother you laugh because it's true okay
[1:18:52] good like at least it's okay at least
[1:18:55] it's not just me right so
[1:18:58] so so you're look I'm going to I'm just
[1:19:00] going to say your identity is not your
[1:19:03] feelings your identity is not the labels
[1:19:06] that some doctor would love to put on
[1:19:08] your identity is found in Jesus Christ
[1:19:11] so then the more that you know him the
[1:19:14] more you would know yourself and so
[1:19:17] aren't you glad then that we live in a
[1:19:20] day then where we had a Prophet come
[1:19:22] along and finish and tie up all the
[1:19:25] Loose Ends and all the Mysteries to
[1:19:28] unveil to us who Jesus Christ was to
[1:19:32] tell us that God had a three-fold
[1:19:34] purpose in the back part of his mind
[1:19:36] before the foundation of the world so
[1:19:39] that now you can know fully who he is
[1:19:43] Sir amen am amen that's it right because
[1:19:47] because Paul is saying now I see through
[1:19:49] a glass Darkly but then
[1:19:55] now there may be more then from here on
[1:19:57] out so don't again don't say I'm trying
[1:19:59] to trivialize the Rapture or anything
[1:20:01] like that but but Paul is seeing through
[1:20:03] this glass right but but but the so then
[1:20:07] the more light that comes through that
[1:20:10] glass the more he can see Jesus Christ
[1:20:14] the more then I'll know him even as I am
[1:20:19] known and so today by God's grace we
[1:20:22] have the perfect interpretation of the
[1:20:25] word of God with Divine Vindication the
[1:20:28] wind of the glass has been my goodness
[1:20:31] God has taken some wind X yes sir and
[1:20:34] polish that glass up and you can see who
[1:20:37] Jesus Christ is and then when you see
[1:20:40] all that he is and all of his potentials
[1:20:42] that they now are residing and have been
[1:20:45] quickened inside of you though you're
[1:20:48] man you're some of us look hey we we're
[1:20:50] all there our flesh hasn't figured out
[1:20:52] who we are yet right that's right right
[1:20:55] good am drives me crazy
[1:20:58] amen but guess
[1:21:01] what me Owns My
[1:21:05] Flesh My Flesh isn't me I'm going to put
[1:21:09] off this body yes right it's going to be
[1:21:12] changed it's going to be quickened it's
[1:21:13] going to be glorified right glory to God
[1:21:17] so who am I I am the potential that I
[1:21:20] can see from the foundation of the world
[1:21:24] if I in Jesus Christ if the Holy Spirit
[1:21:27] has come and quickened that life and a
[1:21:30] new birth inside of me and I have been
[1:21:33] born again just as Jesus himself was
[1:21:37] born sir why didn't Jesus have to be
[1:21:39] born again well cuz he came right the
[1:21:41] first time you and I didn't come right
[1:21:44] the first time but the Born Again peace
[1:21:47] is the same thing as Jesus being born
[1:21:50] praise God Amen and all the potential
[1:21:52] that was there before the foundation of
[1:21:54] the world now residing in Jesus Christ
[1:21:56] and now then being in you born again who
[1:22:00] are you I can the more I see him the
[1:22:03] more I see
[1:22:05] myself so so so now because of that we
[1:22:10] see God now now God can be fully seen so
[1:22:15] all of the power of God all of the
[1:22:17] emotion of God or all of the the
[1:22:20] spiritual qualities of God his love his
[1:22:22] Joy his peace his patience right like
[1:22:24] all the that God is like all of those
[1:22:25] things
[1:22:26] right that were in him before the
[1:22:29] foundation of the world yes that were on
[1:22:31] display for us in Jesus Christ the
[1:22:34] Kingdom of Heaven is within you
[1:22:38] Jesus
[1:22:40] Jesus and you think well I'm I'm just a
[1:22:42] human but I'd like I'd like to ask you
[1:22:44] something like we talk about humanity
[1:22:47] and we talk about how you know you you
[1:22:50] hear the the expression like oh my what
[1:22:52] a display of humanity and when we say
[1:22:54] that what do what do we mean we mean
[1:22:55] somebody did something exceptionally
[1:22:57] kind somebody did something
[1:22:59] exceptionally Brave or exceptionally
[1:23:01] heroic right I mean a dog doesn't help a
[1:23:03] little lady across the street and we go
[1:23:05] what a display of
[1:23:07] humanity you know doesn't happen you
[1:23:11] know Lions they they don't display
[1:23:13] Humanity like why not well cuz duh
[1:23:16] brother Trevor they're not humans well
[1:23:17] but okay so what what what's the
[1:23:20] difference between like okay a dog is
[1:23:22] going to go and you know he a dog might
[1:23:24] console you if you you're feeling bad
[1:23:26] the dog might sense some Instinct be
[1:23:28] able to come and you know snuggle up
[1:23:30] next to you and but we still like the
[1:23:33] dog can be kind but we still don't say
[1:23:35] what a display of humanity no it's not a
[1:23:38] display of humanity but when someone
[1:23:40] else who actually chooses and can go oh
[1:23:42] I looks like you're feeling down right
[1:23:44] now oh I have a choice I can make now I
[1:23:47] can choose to be kind to you
[1:23:50] or I could choose to not be kind to you
[1:23:55] because it's not just Instinct because
[1:23:56] I've been given that choice that
[1:24:00] Humanity where did I where did I get
[1:24:02] that from where why do I have that and
[1:24:04] dogs don't why do I have that and lions
[1:24:06] don't well I think because what image
[1:24:08] was it that humans were created in
[1:24:13] amen so all the humanity of
[1:24:16] God can be in you and it's like that's
[1:24:19] just an interesting statement because
[1:24:20] it's like wait go like God wasn't human
[1:24:23] is he we say can we can we reduce God
[1:24:26] down to humanity God is trying to
[1:24:28] express himself in humanity he's
[1:24:31] choosing the appropriate vessel to
[1:24:34] display his qualities he created us in
[1:24:37] His image to display his qualities so
[1:24:41] this is the whole idea and this is what
[1:24:43] we're we're we're trying to we're trying
[1:24:46] to talk about here I want to turn to
[1:24:48] Romans chapter 4 really quick as we wind
[1:24:50] this to a close the timer still ask says
[1:24:53] I have some time but but you all have
[1:24:56] had a long week I can
[1:24:58] tell with as interesting as I am um it's
[1:25:03] been a
[1:25:04] struggle that's okay cuz we're
[1:25:07] all
[1:25:10] [Laughter]
[1:25:14] humans
[1:25:18] Glory therefore it is of Faith Romans
[1:25:22] chapter 4: 16 and 17 therefore is a
[1:25:25] faith that it might be by grace to the
[1:25:26] end the promise might be sure to all the
[1:25:29] seed not to Only They which is not not
[1:25:33] to that only which is of the law but to
[1:25:36] that also which is of the faith of
[1:25:38] Abraham who is the father of us all as
[1:25:40] it is written I have made thee a father
[1:25:41] of many nations before him whom he
[1:25:44] believed even God who quickeneth the
[1:25:45] dead and calleth those things which be
[1:25:48] not as though they
[1:25:52] were now
[1:25:54] so I I want to take this in the context
[1:25:56] of that identity as in as that Kingdom
[1:25:58] of Heaven is within you
[1:26:01] Abraham you know he called things as
[1:26:04] they weren't as though they
[1:26:06] were well was he lying when Abraham said
[1:26:11] well my wife and I are going to have a
[1:26:12] baby like Abraham you're
[1:26:17] 90 it's not going to happen right but he
[1:26:20] called things that were not as though
[1:26:23] they were
[1:26:25] and so Abraham could and and so we look
[1:26:26] at this and we think about this in flesh
[1:26:28] terms and we we could say well you know
[1:26:30] I'm going to call things as as they that
[1:26:33] that that are as though they weren't or
[1:26:35] aren't as though they are like whichever
[1:26:37] it is you know I'm sick in my body I'm
[1:26:39] going to I'm going to I'm going to call
[1:26:40] it that it might be sickness but I'm
[1:26:43] going to call it health because that's
[1:26:46] that's what my promise is that's what
[1:26:47] Abraham could do but I wonder about your
[1:26:50] heart and I wonder about the things in
[1:26:52] your heart I wonder about your Joy I
[1:26:54] wonder about your peace I wonder about
[1:26:56] your patience I wonder about all of the
[1:26:58] fruits of the spirit you know that you
[1:27:00] know some of us would you know some of
[1:27:02] us need to start calling things that be
[1:27:04] not as though they are like I am a man
[1:27:06] of
[1:27:09] patience Hallelujah and we can laugh
[1:27:11] about that we can say well I struggle
[1:27:13] with that but but but but hang on just a
[1:27:15] moment is that any different than what
[1:27:18] Abraham was doing to say that he and his
[1:27:20] wife were going to have a child it was
[1:27:22] not something that was currently Laten
[1:27:24] you know like like that it was currently
[1:27:26] expressed in his body but the potential
[1:27:30] of that was there because of who he was
[1:27:34] and so I wonder if sometimes we need to
[1:27:37] start recognizing that the Kingdom of
[1:27:40] Heaven is within you that the
[1:27:42] restoration of that kingdom is coming
[1:27:45] into your heart and into your life and
[1:27:48] so that so then patience is there in you
[1:27:52] then hope is there in you then love is
[1:27:56] there in you then all then everything
[1:27:58] you get up wishing for more of in the
[1:28:00] morning is there in you when you want
[1:28:04] life to be more peaceful it's
[1:28:07] there amen yes sir when you want more
[1:28:09] hope it's there when you want more love
[1:28:11] it's there when you want more joy it's
[1:28:14] there because why
[1:28:17] because because it was here uhhuh before
[1:28:21] the foundation of the world
[1:28:25] all the love yes sir I am love amen I am
[1:28:32] peace I am Joy I am hope Hallelujah I am
[1:28:39] patience I am awesome I am
[1:28:44] amazing and now I'm going to express it
[1:28:48] completely yes sir and so that now you
[1:28:51] can see the complete expression all of
[1:28:55] that now in a
[1:28:57] person why because I want to restore it
[1:29:01] in
[1:29:03] you amen amen all that he was he poured
[1:29:08] into Christ all that Christ was he
[1:29:11] poured into his church so I think we
[1:29:13] should stop saying well the doctor said
[1:29:16] blah blah blah this condition and mental
[1:29:19] disorder and blah
[1:29:21] anxiety come on it out amen
[1:29:25] amen amen it has no place no sir and if
[1:29:29] it's and if you're struggling with that
[1:29:31] what I would say is go back to what Paul
[1:29:33] said so I'm seeing then I would say
[1:29:35] you're looking too Darkly through that
[1:29:37] glass and maybe you need to polish up
[1:29:40] your you know your message app maybe you
[1:29:44] need to polish up you know your Bible
[1:29:46] and begin to look through it because I
[1:29:48] tell you what the glass is clean right
[1:29:50] now the glass is clean you can see who
[1:29:53] he he is and so if you haven't seen who
[1:29:56] you are it's cuz you haven't been
[1:29:58] looking at who he is because today we
[1:30:02] have it the full complete restoration of
[1:30:06] all of what his word has meant to us has
[1:30:09] been completely expressed completely
[1:30:12] known and so if you want it like I'm not
[1:30:14] a person with anxiety I am not a person
[1:30:17] with this thing or that thing or this
[1:30:19] disorder no I'm the Bride of Jesus
[1:30:23] Christ which means I have hope which
[1:30:25] means I have peace but if I don't see it
[1:30:28] in me it's cuz I haven't seen it in him
[1:30:30] yet wow amen
[1:30:34] glory glory a they make fun of me for
[1:30:37] saying it I've been not really fun of it
[1:30:40] but you know um impersonated by saying
[1:30:44] this but I just like I can't help it
[1:30:47] dive into Jesus Christ I know no better
[1:30:51] way to express that dive into this
[1:30:55] message find out who he is look through
[1:30:59] the glass and know him even as I am
[1:31:05] known hallelujah amen glory to God this
[1:31:09] is what it means to know who you are
[1:31:11] this is what it means to you know the
[1:31:13] next time a preacher comes and and we
[1:31:15] get excited because we're the Bride of
[1:31:17] Jesus Christ and we have a little
[1:31:18] Jericho March which would be hard we'd
[1:31:20] have to move some chairs but you know
[1:31:22] and we get and we get excited well well
[1:31:24] good get excited but but understand that
[1:31:26] the reason you're getting excited is not
[1:31:28] because the preacher by by virtue of his
[1:31:31] own words and by virtue of that he
[1:31:33] believes the message has now anointed
[1:31:35] you all into the bride no you've become
[1:31:38] the bride by a new birth and the more
[1:31:41] and to know like that like so that you
[1:31:43] don't struggle the next day you're like
[1:31:46] man yesterday I was praising God cuz I
[1:31:49] was the Bride of Jesus Christ and today
[1:31:51] I'm flat on my face and I don't know Who
[1:31:54] I Am Lord and now I'm getting worried
[1:31:57] because you know which is it my God
[1:32:01] Amen polish off the glass look through
[1:32:04] the glass know him amen and you'll known
[1:32:08] yourself amen
[1:32:12] amen it brothers and sisters it cannot
[1:32:14] be that we can live in a day of a voice
[1:32:16] of a seventh angel and not hear the
[1:32:19] voice it it cannot it cannot be that we
[1:32:22] would just we just that that that we'd
[1:32:24] go back to some Baptist doctrine that
[1:32:26] we'd go back to some Pentecostal
[1:32:28] experience that that's not that God
[1:32:30] hasn't left us there but got it but God
[1:32:32] came down in Revelations 10:1 to express
[1:32:35] fully who he was amen Amen brother Ram
[1:32:40] says here in from that time in
[1:32:43] 1962 How many knows there's a difference
[1:32:45] between the appearing of Christ and the
[1:32:46] coming of Christ it's two different
[1:32:48] words now is the appearing the coming
[1:32:49] will soon be he's appearing what clean
