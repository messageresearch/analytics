[46:19] that door for him to go in amen and just
[46:22] share his heart so
[46:23] let's keep him in prayer while he's away
[46:26] we have a number of saints that are

[46:36] i see things changed since last weekend
[46:42] uh but thank god he's still worthy to be
[46:45] praised amen
[46:47] brother marquise and brother josue went
[46:50] with us to the men's meeting and we had
[46:51] a wonderful time there in
[46:53] uh tennessee and i trust that the next
[46:56] time we do this i i want i'm gonna be
[46:58] encouraging all the brothers
[47:00] uh to to go and be a part of it i think
[47:03] it will be very very helpful
[47:05] uh for you spiritually they don't uh
[47:08] really all they concentrate is just
[47:10] getting closer to god
[47:12] and we had seven services in a matter of
[47:15] almost two days
[47:17] uh
[47:18] on saturday alone five services in one
[47:20] day can you imagine that
[47:22] five services we weren't thinking about
[47:24] nothing else but just
[47:25] getting the words
[47:27] and uh and i i thought that was just
[47:29] really really special and uh you know we
[47:32] just we really enjoyed ourselves so uh
[47:34] so happy that we were able to be a part
[47:36] of that and we're trusting that we'll be
[47:38] able to take uh some other brothers amen
[47:40] with us the next time
[47:42] we go
[47:43] whether i'm speaking or not i think it's
[47:45] still something that we should be uh
[47:47] participating in amen as men of god uh
[47:51] praise the lord musicians thank you all
[47:53] so much i i certainly appreciate you all
[47:56] amen and uh we thank god thank god for
[48:00] you thank god for you

[48:13] birthday today and
[48:15] uh you all don't get a chance to
[48:17] uh to see your weird believing god
[48:20] that she will be able to come
[48:22] from the house
[48:24] to the house of god
[48:26] but uh she watches the services a man
[48:30] she's dependent on that stream because
[48:32] she's there watching stream my bev is
[48:35] brother troy's uh mother
[48:37] a man and um uh being that we are a
[48:40] blended family i call him my beth
[48:44] amen she's precious to me and and i i
[48:47] certainly want to wish her a happy
[48:49] birthday today amen just just thank god
[48:52] for her amen so um
[48:56] i i this sermon that i want to preach
[48:58] today is a sermon that i actually
[49:00] preached for the men's meeting but
[49:03] i have
[49:04] uh rearranged it a little bit for you
[49:07] all
[49:08] and i trust that it'll be a blessing
[49:10] amen to you on this morning so if you
[49:12] don't mind just stand with me and we
[49:15] will read a scripture
[49:18] here
[49:29] genesis
[49:30] chapter
[49:32] 18
[49:33] genesis 18.
[49:41] as i was approaching the men's meeting i
[49:43] i had really no idea what i would speak
[49:46] on it's my first time actually going to
[49:48] do something like that and
[49:50] as i was sitting and listening to all
[49:51] the other brothers speak i said my god
[49:54] there's a subject there there's a
[49:55] subject there there's a subject of
[49:56] subjects everywhere and i say well lord
[50:00] maybe next time i'll be a little bit
[50:01] more prepared but nonetheless
[50:04] they had a theme and i just looked at
[50:07] their theme and i tried to take a
[50:09] thought from the theme
[50:11] um i believe the lord used it in a very
[50:13] special way
[50:14] uh there among some of the uh the men
[50:17] uh just some of the testimonies that i
[50:19] heard that came back i know that the
[50:21] lord used it so god knows all things
[50:24] amen here in genesis 18 uh we're reading
[50:28] verse 16 through 19
[50:31] the bible says and the men rose up
[50:35] from thence
[50:37] and looked toward sodom and abraham went
[50:41] with them
[50:42] to bring them on the way
[50:44] and the lord said shall i hide from
[50:47] abraham
[50:48] that thing
[50:50] which i do
[50:52] seeing that abraham shall surely become
[50:54] a great and mighty nation
[50:57] and all the nations of the earth shall
[50:59] be blessed in him
[51:01] we're going to be blessed
[51:03] in him
[51:04] right
[51:05] uh and this is the verse that really
[51:08] uh stood out
[51:10] for i know him
[51:13] right
[51:14] and remember
[51:16] brother kwaku
[51:17] uh preached i know you by your name
[51:20] saith the lord right and that's what god
[51:23] says about abraham and we are we are
[51:25] identified we're blessed in abraham
[51:28] but the scripture says for i know him
[51:31] that he will command his children
[51:35] and
[51:36] his household after him
[51:39] and they shall keep
[51:42] the way of the lord
[51:44] to do justice and judgment
[51:47] that the lord may bring upon abraham
[51:49] that which he hath spoken of him
[51:52] the lord is a blessing to the reading of
[51:54] his word let's bow in a word of prayer
[51:56] father we are grateful for the
[51:59] privilege and the opportunity to uh
[52:03] approach
[52:04] your thrones what a blessing it is to
[52:06] read the word of god
[52:08] and god is even a greater brother
[52:10] blessing when the holy spirit begins to
[52:13] reveal what we have read
[52:15] that we might be able to apply it to our
[52:18] lives even now
[52:20] we trust oh god that
[52:22] you would just get all the glory and all
[52:23] the honor out of this portion of service
[52:25] thank you for
[52:27] uh the worship the time and song service
[52:30] the specials everything that has
[52:31] happened we feel your presence here
[52:34] today and we believe anything can happen
[52:37] in a presence like this so we trust god
[52:39] that as we enter into the word may uh
[52:42] the anointing that is in the word come
[52:44] upon us and god make a difference in our
[52:47] lives before we leave this place today
[52:49] uh bless our precious brother smiley as
[52:52] he's there ministering father for
[52:54] brother remy in the church
[52:55] use them for your glory for your honor
[52:58] lord bless them uh abundantly
[53:00] is our prayer in jesus name we pray amen
[53:04] amen you can be seated amen and i do
[53:07] want to also just uh
[53:09] say that i thank god for
[53:12] all the brothers that just kind of came
[53:14] last week while we were away and they uh
[53:17] helped get everything all set up i
[53:19] appreciate that um and um uh just you
[53:23] know i i have to call out brother
[53:25] quentin specifically he
[53:27] uh he actually was supposed to go to the
[53:30] men's meeting he had already paid to go
[53:32] uh but i just mentioned to him that i
[53:35] think he and brother josue been going at
[53:38] this time a little difficult
[53:40] so he uh um he said he would stay back
[53:44] and i do appreciate uh him doing that
[53:46] and just making sure things were done
[53:48] so god bless you brother quentin amen
[53:50] thank you so much
[53:52] thank you so much
[53:54] praise the lord amen so i want to just
[53:57] take a simple title amen today um
[54:01] this sermon will be titled traits
[54:05] traits amen
[54:07] uh
[54:08] praise the lord
[54:11] and um
[54:15] we want to just read a little something
[54:18] here from
[54:19] the sermon questions and answers part
[54:21] three
[54:23] brother branham speaks this in 1964.
[54:26] uh the question is dear brother branham
[54:28] is it possible
[54:30] for one to have the baptism of the holy
[54:32] ghost
[54:34] and not to have the signs following
[54:37] at least not until some future time
[54:40] and conditions appointed by the spirit
[54:42] so this is a question that someone is
[54:45] presenting to the prophet about having
[54:47] the baptism of the holy ghost and signs
[54:50] following at some future time
[54:53] right so he answers the question he says
[54:55] but now
[54:56] he says this person here
[55:00] is asking the question
[55:02] about the possibility
[55:04] of having the baptism of the holy ghost
[55:07] without signs following them
[55:11] now if you're born again
[55:13] if you are born first as a human being
[55:17] and a normal human being
[55:20] says now i'm answering this in a real
[55:22] juvenile way of doing it but if you're
[55:24] born a normal
[55:26] human being you will actually do things
[55:30] that a normal human being would do
[55:34] hallelujah he says is that right
[55:37] it says when you're born as a human he
[55:40] says the natural traits of a human being
[55:44] will follow you
[55:46] now he's answering this in a very
[55:48] juvenile way but we have to catch this
[55:50] amen from the spiritual sense because as
[55:53] believers uh fill with the holy ghost
[55:55] and there should just be certain traits
[55:58] that follow the believer
[56:00] amen believers don't follow signs but
[56:03] signs do follow believers
[56:06] glory to god amen says when you're born
[56:09] as a human the natural traits of a human
[56:12] being will follow you and he says you
[56:15] won't live in a tree
[56:17] amen
[56:19] and try to fly with your wings like a
[56:22] bird
[56:23] right if you're just a normal human
[56:24] being you won't do these things he said
[56:26] and try to fly like a bird he says or
[56:29] something like that that isn't uh that
[56:32] wouldn't be a normal human being the
[56:35] normal actions of a human being the
[56:38] normal action of a human being would be
[56:42] to work now i like that statement there
[56:46] the normal action of a human being would
[56:50] be to work
[56:52] because if a man don't work then he
[56:54] don't eat
[56:55] glory to god if you if there's a problem
[56:58] with a man getting up and going to work
[57:00] then we got something something going
[57:01] wrong here somewhere the normal action
[57:03] of a human being is to work
[57:07] all right all right he says not only
[57:09] this he said the normal action of a
[57:11] human being is to marry
[57:13] uh oh
[57:14] amen that that should be that should be
[57:16] a very normal thing that a a man would
[57:19] want to marry a woman a woman want to
[57:20] marry a man amen and notice to say mary
[57:24] not live together mary
[57:27] hallelujah right amen that should be the
[57:29] normal action of a human being says to
[57:31] have a family glory to god to do these
[57:34] things the natural normal human beings
[57:36] because you're born that then then when
[57:39] you're born a christian born of the
[57:41] spirit of god you naturally take up the
[57:45] attributes of christ you see
[57:47] see these traits are in you amen when
[57:50] you got the holy ghost you naturally
[57:52] just take up certain things just by
[57:53] being born again the same way you
[57:55] naturally take up things just by being a
[57:57] human being he says this is now if we
[58:00] took here
[58:01] this morning in this congregation where
[58:04] your people sit here and listen day
[58:06] after day and so forth to teach him
[58:08] you'll find out you'll be different one
[58:10] from another because you're different it
[58:13] shows your makeup different your
[58:15] appetites are different you eat
[58:18] different but you all eat food
[58:20] that's what normal human beings do but
[58:23] now just amen with one individual being
[58:26] just like the other one you're different
[58:28] one from another christians do the same
[58:30] thing you can't say do all speak with
[58:32] tongues do all prophesied do i say no
[58:34] you have to watch these things because a
[58:36] christian takes up the habits of a
[58:39] christian
[58:40] amen and they live like a christian and
[58:43] jesus said these signs shall follow them
[58:45] that believe notice in my name they
[58:47] shall cast out devils they shall take up
[58:49] serpents drink deadly things and they'll
[58:52] speak with new tongues and then things
[58:54] just actually follow christians so i
[58:57] thank god for it it's just a real
[58:59] juvenile way of just kind of showing
[59:01] that uh when we're born again of the
[59:03] spirit god there are just certain traits
[59:05] that will follow us amen we don't have
[59:08] to make it up we don't have to try to
[59:10] pump it up it just happens uh especially
[59:13] when we find ourselves in uh uh uh
[59:16] troubling situations glory to god there
[59:18] are certain traits that are just
[59:20] expressed in a christian that they can't
[59:23] help it it's just there
[59:25] hallelujah amen this this trait means a
[59:29] distinguishing quality
[59:31] uh or characteristic
[59:33] it's an attribute
[59:35] a distinction
[59:37] a trademark
[59:39] a custom
[59:41] a tendency a habit
[59:44] an oddity or an essential quality right
[59:47] so so so when we talk about you know
[59:50] christians uh or you know we let me just
[59:52] put it this way traits can be found in
[59:54] christians trace can be found in
[59:56] families amen and traits are found
[59:59] everywhere so so when we look at a
[1:00:01] family trait sometimes the way that
[1:00:03] we're built
[1:00:05] amen the way that our bodies are built
[1:00:07] it's something just kind of follows a
[1:00:09] man a trait in that family
[1:00:11] glory to god you can't help it that just
[1:00:13] that's something that wherever it
[1:00:14] started in your family it just it keeps
[1:00:16] flowing through you
[1:00:18] and your kids get the same trait you
[1:00:20] can't help the way that you build
[1:00:22] glory to god glory to god amen no matter
[1:00:25] how many diets you go on
[1:00:27] amen it's the same result because that's
[1:00:29] the trait that follows your family and
[1:00:32] some they lose their hair at a certain
[1:00:34] age
[1:00:35] and you'll be trying to do everything
[1:00:37] you can to keep it together but there's
[1:00:39] a trait
[1:00:40] that just kicks in at a certain time and
[1:00:43] you can't stop it from happening
[1:00:46] praise god you can try to cover it up
[1:00:48] you can do all kinds of things but you
[1:00:50] can't stop that natural trait from
[1:00:53] occurring in your and amen just in your
[1:00:55] body
[1:00:57] hallelujah certain diseases we fight
[1:01:00] because our family members that
[1:01:02] it's a trait that just moves down from
[1:01:05] generation to generation to generation
[1:01:09] hallelujah
[1:01:10] glory to god but you know there are some
[1:01:12] spiritual traits
[1:01:14] that flow to families
[1:01:16] sometimes when you find a mother that's
[1:01:18] a prayer warrior then that gene begins
[1:01:21] to flow from family member to family
[1:01:24] member those traits are there
[1:01:26] maybe they have a trait to be able to
[1:01:28] fast and and pray praise god that trait
[1:01:32] will show up in their children
[1:01:35] a trait to sing a trait to preach
[1:01:38] there's traits that follows spiritually
[1:01:41] just like they follow naturally
[1:01:44] and you can't stop that trait
[1:01:47] from coming forth if god put it there
[1:01:51] it must be expressed
[1:01:54] it's an attribute that shows up in your
[1:01:57] family
[1:02:05] traits are found in christians
[1:02:08] and you know we have
[1:02:11] uh uh
[1:02:13] what i would call
[1:02:14] christians of the flesh and christians
[1:02:16] of the spirit
[1:02:18] but nonetheless they're christians
[1:02:22] and there are certain traits that should
[1:02:23] follow just by being a christian
[1:02:26] right and and i'm using this definition
[1:02:28] from the authoritarian church age don't
[1:02:30] worry about pulling this up it's a very
[1:02:31] short one brother iran says a christian
[1:02:33] is a christian
[1:02:35] as long as he subscribes to the fact
[1:02:37] that jesus
[1:02:38] is the son of god
[1:02:40] born of a virgin
[1:02:42] was crucified and died and rose again
[1:02:46] and i want to i want you to understand
[1:02:48] just by being a christian
[1:02:50] you believe in the supernatural
[1:02:56] just just by being a christian you
[1:02:57] already believe in the supernatural
[1:03:00] if you believe jesus died
[1:03:03] and
[1:03:05] rose again you have to believe in
[1:03:07] supernatural
[1:03:08] if you believe jesus was born of a
[1:03:11] virgin
[1:03:13] you have to believe in the supernatural
[1:03:16] just by being a christian i want to tell
[1:03:18] you something this morning there is a
[1:03:21] supernatural trait
[1:03:23] that flows to you
[1:03:28] oh hallelujah
[1:03:30] jesus is the son of god born a virgin
[1:03:32] was crucified and died and rose again
[1:03:34] that he is the savior of mankind etc see
[1:03:38] that that that's what makes you a
[1:03:40] christian these traits are found in
[1:03:41] christians these are the things that we
[1:03:43] believe that's what makes us christians
[1:03:46] but what i can go a little higher a
[1:03:48] little further if i can put it that way
[1:03:50] amen to be a message believer you got
[1:03:52] traits
[1:03:55] right
[1:03:56] there are certain traits that follow you
[1:03:57] as a message believer
[1:04:00] amen we believe and identify with the
[1:04:02] teachings of william mary and branham
[1:04:05] hallelujah you know i'm going to tell
[1:04:07] you there's a spirit that has been
[1:04:08] released in the land
[1:04:10] and people don't want you to identify
[1:04:12] with the teachings of william mary and
[1:04:13] branham
[1:04:16] amen but as a believer there's a trait
[1:04:19] that just i'm associated with
[1:04:22] i believe that god sent a prophet
[1:04:24] according to
[1:04:26] malachi 4.
[1:04:28] i'm talking about according to my bible
[1:04:30] i believe
[1:04:31] according to revelation 10 7 i believe
[1:04:34] god used the ministry of william marion
[1:04:37] branham
[1:04:38] just like i believe god used the
[1:04:40] ministry of john the baptist for the
[1:04:42] first coming of the lord
[1:04:44] i believe god used the minister william
[1:04:45] branham for the second coming of the
[1:04:47] lord
[1:04:49] amen
[1:04:51] so as
[1:04:52] these are traits that are found in
[1:04:53] message believers
[1:04:55] and i want to encourage the church
[1:04:57] please know where you stand
[1:05:00] with the message according to the bible
[1:05:05] read the bible yourself and then get to
[1:05:08] get the answers to these questions
[1:05:11] hallelujah right because because people
[1:05:14] just coming up with all kind of nonsense
[1:05:16] nowadays
[1:05:18] i'm going to just give y'all one i'm
[1:05:19] going to give y'all one that i just
[1:05:20] heard recently and and i'm
[1:05:23] hopefully to help you a little bit
[1:05:24] but somebody told me they said that
[1:05:27] brother branham
[1:05:28] uh did not get the teaching of the uh of
[1:05:32] what happened in the garden of eden that
[1:05:34] wasn't a revelation that god gave him
[1:05:36] they said that he learned that in the
[1:05:38] kkk
[1:05:45] and i have one question
[1:05:47] i had one question if he did learn it
[1:05:49] from the kkk
[1:05:50] where did the kkk
[1:05:53] get it
[1:05:56] where did they get it
[1:05:59] right
[1:06:00] all right i mean because if they got it
[1:06:01] at the bible you can't deny that that's
[1:06:04] the bible
[1:06:05] and let me tell you something every
[1:06:06] denomination or every organization gonna
[1:06:09] have a part of truth
[1:06:13] so that don't shake me if they had that
[1:06:15] they they they might have had that but
[1:06:17] they got a lot of other stuff they
[1:06:18] didn't have right
[1:06:21] right so that don't shake me
[1:06:25] oh my but you hear all kind of nonsense
[1:06:28] that's why you got to know know the
[1:06:30] scripture for yourself right i i i
[1:06:33] didn't follow this message i'm gonna be
[1:06:34] honest when this message was introduced
[1:06:36] to me what i could see is the bible
[1:06:39] i started look i mean they never
[1:06:40] preached malachite foreign church i came
[1:06:42] from never they never preached the book
[1:06:44] of revelation it didn't even make no
[1:06:46] sense but when somebody told me this was
[1:06:48] actually manifested in my day revelation
[1:06:50] 10 7 malachi 4 what these scriptures are
[1:06:53] right here i mean being manifested in my
[1:06:55] time i said yeah i could see that
[1:06:58] hallelujah let me go a little further as
[1:07:01] message believers we have certain traits
[1:07:04] they follow us uh when we look at um
[1:07:08] let me move on a little further here
[1:07:10] uh let me just read galatians 5 22-24 i
[1:07:13] believe
[1:07:14] a christian filled with the spirit of
[1:07:15] god will certainly have these traits
[1:07:18] manifested in them amen galatians 5
[1:07:21] 22-24
[1:07:23] says but the fruit of the spirit is love
[1:07:26] joy
[1:07:27] peace
[1:07:28] long-suffering
[1:07:30] gentleness
[1:07:31] goodness hallelujah amen and i think
[1:07:35] when we're bringing it out on wednesday
[1:07:37] night uh that goodness there is
[1:07:39] generosity

[1:07:42] spirit you should be generous
[1:07:45] amen glory to god the fruit of the
[1:07:47] spirit is love joy peace long suffering
[1:07:49] gypsies goodness
[1:07:51] faith
[1:07:52] and as we're bringing that out on on
[1:07:54] wednesday night you know that that faith
[1:07:56] is is actually faithfulness

[1:08:17] that are christ have crucified the flesh
[1:08:19] with the affections and lust so as a
[1:08:22] christian these are traits that should
[1:08:24] be flowing amen in our beings
[1:08:27] this scripture also in galatians 3 29
[1:08:29] says this and if ye be christ
[1:08:31] then are you abraham's seed and heirs
[1:08:34] according to the promise now i want to
[1:08:36] read a quote here from the message
[1:08:37] believing god see i believe there are
[1:08:40] natural traits that flow through us
[1:08:42] there's also spiritual traits that flow
[1:08:44] through us and hearing this message
[1:08:45] believe in god brother adam says now he
[1:08:48] was jehovah jireh
[1:08:50] glory to god he was jehovah rapha
[1:08:53] nisi and on down like that he had seven
[1:08:56] compound redemptive names and
[1:08:59] substitutionary to human life took a
[1:09:01] lamb and offered it up as the provided
[1:09:04] sacrifice that in isaac all the nations
[1:09:07] would be blessed and through isaac came
[1:09:09] out christ and we being dead in christ
[1:09:13] take on abraham's seed and our heirs
[1:09:16] according to the promise look at this he
[1:09:18] says there you are glory to god says
[1:09:21] there you are and that brings not in our
[1:09:24] bodies we are gentiles in our bodies
[1:09:27] we're sinners in our bodies but look at
[1:09:30] this statement but in our souls being
[1:09:33] born again with the same spirit was upon
[1:09:37] faith for abraham and yes he uses this
[1:09:39] term that strain down and there makes us
[1:09:42] want to trust god
[1:09:45] i love that statement right there that
[1:09:48] string down in there makes us want to
[1:09:52] trust god
[1:09:53] he says but the body gets scared
[1:09:57] there's a strain inside of you
[1:10:00] there is a trait inside of you that when
[1:10:03] you're faced
[1:10:05] with something that seems impossible
[1:10:07] there's something that makes you
[1:10:11] you can't explain this
[1:10:13] but it's a trait that's on the inside
[1:10:16] a string that is on the inside it makes
[1:10:19] you want to trust god
[1:10:22] brother when i read that i began to
[1:10:24] shout
[1:10:25] now i understand because sometimes you
[1:10:28] be trying to figure out you know why am
[1:10:30] i like this and why am i like that what
[1:10:32] makes me this way there is a trait
[1:10:35] [Music]
[1:10:37] there is a strain inside of me
[1:10:39] no matter what i'm facing
[1:10:42] i want a trust call
[1:10:47] amen that's the mechanism that kicks in
[1:10:50] first
[1:10:50] i got a trust card
[1:10:55] i know i'm going through this
[1:10:57] how many people trying to tell you that
[1:10:58] now look at what the doctor said
[1:11:00] i i realized what the doctor said
[1:11:03] i realized what this specialist said but
[1:11:06] there's a trait inside of me
[1:11:10] i just want to trust god
[1:11:13] i want to believe god i want to see god
[1:11:16] make a way out of no way i want to see
[1:11:19] god open up doors i can't see there is a
[1:11:21] trait inside of me
[1:11:24] a string praise god
[1:11:28] a string that's there
[1:11:31] hallelujah he said he says the strain
[1:11:33] down in there makes us want to trust god
[1:11:37] but the body gets scared
[1:11:40] but the body gets scared
[1:11:44] sometimes it's not just your body it's
[1:11:45] people around you
[1:11:47] they get scared
[1:11:49] and they begin to say this and they
[1:11:50] begin to say that and they just bringing
[1:11:52] up all kind of doubt
[1:11:53] but inside of you you just want to
[1:11:55] believe
[1:11:57] sometimes you want to tell them just
[1:11:58] don't say another word
[1:12:00] i can't listen to that no more
[1:12:02] i i i i be it i just read the scripture
[1:12:05] if you be christian or your abraham's
[1:12:07] seed and heirs according to the promise
[1:12:10] the same thing that was in abraham is
[1:12:12] inside of me
[1:12:15] hallelujah
[1:12:16] amen i love that so there's there he
[1:12:18] says uh but in our souls being born
[1:12:20] again with the same spirit was upon
[1:12:22] faithful abraham that strain down in
[1:12:24] there makes us want to trust god but the
[1:12:27] body gets scared and oh if we're the
[1:12:29] children of abraham let's be as our
[1:12:31] father abraham was
[1:12:33] now how was our father abraham romans
[1:12:36] amen 4 verse 17 through 21 i won't read
[1:12:39] it all but i'll just give you that so
[1:12:40] you can go back and read it yourself
[1:12:42] uh abraham had qualities of his faith
[1:12:46] the first is he called things that be
[1:12:48] not as though they were
[1:12:51] i'm talking you can't see it
[1:12:54] you can't feel it but you're still
[1:12:56] calling it
[1:12:59] call things that be not as though they
[1:13:01] were
[1:13:02] you need to learn how to praise god as
[1:13:03] though it was
[1:13:07] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:13:11] the other quality yeah he against hope
[1:13:15] believed in hope
[1:13:19] hallelujah to the lamb of god
[1:13:21] it says uh here
[1:13:23] and uh and being not weak in faith
[1:13:27] glory he considered not his own body now
[1:13:30] dead
[1:13:31] when he was about 100 years old so this
[1:13:33] is one of the qualities of abraham faith
[1:13:35] everything was against him but he still
[1:13:37] believed god
[1:13:39] right hallelujah and not only neither
[1:13:42] yet the deadness of sarah's womb he
[1:13:43] wasn't even looking at that
[1:13:45] not even looking at his body because god
[1:13:47] can change your body
[1:13:51] god can change your situation just like
[1:13:54] that
[1:13:55] [Applause]
[1:13:56] hallelujah the bible also said he
[1:13:58] staggered not at the promise of god
[1:14:01] through unbelief
[1:14:04] brother when i read the bible i see
[1:14:05] abraham staggering all over the place
[1:14:08] but it ain't about what i see it's about
[1:14:10] what god can see and god said he's
[1:14:13] tagging out of the promises of god
[1:14:15] through unbelief
[1:14:17] if god is saying that about abraham he's
[1:14:19] saying the same thing about you
[1:14:22] and look at this look at this this next
[1:14:23] one he was strong in faith giving glory
[1:14:26] to god
[1:14:28] i love that i love that and this final
[1:14:30] quality of his faith is uh being fully
[1:14:33] persuaded
[1:14:34] that what he had promised what god had
[1:14:36] promised he was able to perform now god
[1:14:39] if you gave me the promise that you're
[1:14:40] able to perform the promise
[1:14:42] now how you do it that ain't up to me
[1:14:44] that's totally up to you
[1:14:46] god got over a billion ways to get your
[1:14:48] needs met
[1:14:50] don't limit him to one or two ways god
[1:14:52] got over a billion ways to get your
[1:14:54] needs man
[1:14:55] [Applause]
[1:14:57] all right all right all right
[1:15:00] i looked at this scripture genesis 18 19
[1:15:03] says for i know him
[1:15:06] that he would command his children
[1:15:09] and his household after him
[1:15:11] and they shall keep the way of the lord
[1:15:14] to do justice and judgment
[1:15:16] that the lord may bring upon abraham
[1:15:18] that which he has spoken of him
[1:15:22] you know and as i start meditating on
[1:15:24] this scripture
[1:15:25] uh the bible said abraham was willing to
[1:15:28] command his children
[1:15:30] and his household after him and see god
[1:15:33] knew that trait was inside of abraham
[1:15:36] and i want you to notice something um
[1:15:39] the way that this is positioned in the
[1:15:41] scripture
[1:15:43] glory to god
[1:15:45] this is positioned just after god
[1:15:47] himself comes down with two angels to
[1:15:50] visit abraham and sarah
[1:15:52] in the tent and when abraham saw
[1:15:55] uh uh saw god and his two angels abraham
[1:15:58] yelled out my lord
[1:16:01] not my lord so so there's a trait that
[1:16:03] will follow abraham's seed that they
[1:16:05] won't see three gods
[1:16:07] they don't see father son and holy ghost
[1:16:10] as three separate gods they see it as
[1:16:13] one god
[1:16:15] so they'll scream out the same thing
[1:16:17] abraham said my lord
[1:16:20] hallelujah
[1:16:22] glory to god but here you know god is
[1:16:24] coming down in the flesh
[1:16:26] to visit abraham and and as he's there
[1:16:29] if it's in abraham he asked some
[1:16:30] questions say where's sarah your wife oh
[1:16:33] she's in the tent behind you he's saying
[1:16:34] i'm gonna visit sarah and you're gonna
[1:16:37] have a son in the time of life and sarah
[1:16:39] began to laugh in the tent in her heart
[1:16:42] and he said why sarah laughing and
[1:16:43] attending you know and laughing about
[1:16:46] the promise that i just gave he asked
[1:16:47] the question is there anything oh
[1:16:50] hallelujah
[1:16:52] glory to god how many times have we
[1:16:54] laughed at the promise
[1:16:56] how many times have we disbelieved what
[1:16:58] god gave us and what he said but god
[1:17:01] asked the question to us the same way he
[1:17:03] asked it to abraham and say is there
[1:17:05] anything
[1:17:06] too hard for the lord
[1:17:09] and i'm going to tell you something god
[1:17:10] don't even care about sarah's laughing
[1:17:13] he's still going to manifest the promise
[1:17:17] god don't care about your doubt and
[1:17:18] you're laughing god don't still manifest
[1:17:21] his promise
[1:17:24] your doubt can't stop cut
[1:17:26] your unbelief can't stop god your
[1:17:29] laughter can't stop god
[1:17:32] oh hallelujah
[1:17:34] glory to god
[1:17:36] i'm so glad that nothing i can do that
[1:17:38] can stop god's promise from being made
[1:17:40] manifest in my life
[1:17:44] is there anything
[1:17:48] too hard for the lord
[1:17:50] no it might be too hard for me
[1:17:52] it might be too hard for you
[1:17:54] but the question is
[1:17:55] is there anything too hard for the lord
[1:18:00] and my answer that no ain't nothing too
[1:18:02] hard for my god
[1:18:05] my god is greater my god is stronger
[1:18:08] my god is higher than any
[1:18:10] other awesome in power
[1:18:14] right that's my god
[1:18:16] i i i was thinking this week i say i
[1:18:18] served the same god that opened up the
[1:18:20] red sea
[1:18:22] little children of israel
[1:18:24] i served the same god that that that
[1:18:26] that that that took fire out of a a
[1:18:29] burning furnace
[1:18:31] jumped in with a man as the fourth man
[1:18:34] to to take the fire that's the god that
[1:18:37] i serve
[1:18:38] i i turned to god that when a man got
[1:18:40] thrown into a den of hungry lions
[1:18:43] he could just lay there and sleep
[1:18:46] praise god because the lions knew that
[1:18:48] there was something in there besides
[1:18:50] that man the pillow fire was in there i
[1:18:53] served that same god
[1:18:56] amen as i heard about him making a way
[1:18:58] for the children of israel and doing all
[1:19:00] these great things but that same god is
[1:19:02] making a way for us right now
[1:19:06] it's not a different god it's the same
[1:19:08] god
[1:19:10] glory hallelujah
[1:19:12] here abraham is is giving
[1:19:15] a man uh this visitation by almighty god
[1:19:18] and two angels
[1:19:20] and he's telling abraham a promise that
[1:19:22] sarah's going to have a son
[1:19:24] sarah's going to have a son i'm going to
[1:19:25] visit her at the time of life and and
[1:19:27] then he says now you know i'm getting
[1:19:28] ready to leave and
[1:19:30] you know and and they start turning
[1:19:32] looking towards sodom so in between this
[1:19:34] visitation and the promise given to
[1:19:37] sarah glory to god and then the time of
[1:19:40] destruction for uh for sodom and
[1:19:42] gomorrah god
[1:19:45] makes these uh statements about abraham
[1:19:48] i like this i like this amen he says
[1:19:51] abraham was willing to command his
[1:19:53] children
[1:19:54] and his house so after him glory to god
[1:19:57] abraham was willing to teach him and god
[1:19:59] knew that he would
[1:20:00] and uh you know as i thought about it
[1:20:02] you know i'm looking at him uh just just
[1:20:05] making these statements and i i just it
[1:20:07] just it struck me could god say the same
[1:20:10] thing about us
[1:20:12] for i know
[1:20:14] him
[1:20:18] before destruction
[1:20:20] in sodom can you imagine i mean god know
[1:20:23] abraham and keep his kids
[1:20:25] out of sodom
[1:20:27] abraham not going to raise his kids in
[1:20:29] an environment like that hallelujah
[1:20:32] right i mean i mean god knew there was
[1:20:34] certain things certain qualities of
[1:20:36] traits that was in abraham and my
[1:20:38] question is can god say the same thing
[1:20:40] about us for i know him i know
[1:20:43] [Applause]
[1:20:44] her they will command their children oh
[1:20:48] hallelujah
[1:20:49] and their household after them and they
[1:20:52] shall keep the way of the lord
[1:20:56] to do justin and judgment i thought
[1:20:58] about even in your businesses does god
[1:21:00] know you well enough to know that you
[1:21:01] ain't gonna work those shady deals
[1:21:06] that you ain't gonna do nothing to
[1:21:07] compromise on the word of god
[1:21:10] sometimes you have to say no to some
[1:21:12] business deals if it's going to amen if
[1:21:14] it's going to do damage to your
[1:21:16] reputation
[1:21:18] if it's going to do damage to your
[1:21:19] testimony you're going to have to say no
[1:21:21] i don't care how lucrative it is
[1:21:26] god say i know them
[1:21:29] they're going to do justice and judgment
[1:21:33] glory to god
[1:21:35] as i thought as i pondered this
[1:21:38] amen i knew that there was a negative
[1:21:40] trait that
[1:21:43] isaac picked up
[1:21:45] that his daddy also displayed
[1:21:48] and i want to i want to just share with
[1:21:50] you negative traits amen that flow
[1:21:53] through your children will pick up
[1:21:56] unless you can bring those things
[1:21:57] underneath the blood of jesus
[1:22:01] oh glory to god
[1:22:04] i'm gonna just read a quote this is
[1:22:05] gonna be rather lengthy but i think
[1:22:07] it'll be good
[1:22:09] amen abraham i mean isaac picked up a
[1:22:11] lying treat
[1:22:14] because abraham abraham lied to amen
[1:22:17] abimelech he also lied to pharaoh about
[1:22:19] sarah being his sister
[1:22:21] rather than santa's wife isaac did the
[1:22:24] same thing when he went down to
[1:22:25] abimelech he told him that that that
[1:22:27] rebecca was his sister
[1:22:30] a line trait
[1:22:33] i'm gonna tell you line traits flow
[1:22:35] through families
[1:22:36] you'd be wondering why this is this one
[1:22:38] line that one line
[1:22:40] everybody lied
[1:22:42] the mama lie the the children lie the
[1:22:45] grandchildren lie everybody be lying
[1:22:47] it's a trait that follows that family
[1:22:50] unless that trait is brought underneath
[1:22:51] the blood
[1:22:53] it'll still just be flowing in that
[1:22:55] family
[1:22:57] i mean fabricators
[1:23:00] make that thing up and even they believe
[1:23:02] it they believe their own story
[1:23:07] it's the truth anyhow
[1:23:10] you know i can sit here and tell you
[1:23:12] different traits that just flow
[1:23:14] you know that uh uh uh uh sometimes you
[1:23:17] have let me read this quote let me just
[1:23:19] read this quote rather than do that this
[1:23:21] is a out of the message of paradox
[1:23:24] and uh this is a rather lengthy quote
[1:23:25] but i want you to see how this this
[1:23:27] there's a trait that flows through this
[1:23:29] family negative things can flow through
[1:23:30] a family just the same way positive
[1:23:32] things can flow through it says for
[1:23:34] instance
[1:23:36] a few days ago
[1:23:39] it says i was called on the scene
[1:23:42] a little something going on there was a
[1:23:45] fine young man
[1:23:47] fine boy he was going with a little girl
[1:23:51] very fine little girl out of a fine
[1:23:53] family so i mean the girl come from a
[1:23:55] fine family the boy come from a fine
[1:23:58] family i mean fine people that's what
[1:24:00] brother brother brandon called it says
[1:24:02] in this boy
[1:24:03] all of a sudden
[1:24:05] came up with some kind of an idea
[1:24:09] and he just walked away
[1:24:11] so he left a relationship with this girl
[1:24:13] he was in a real good relationship and
[1:24:15] he came over some kind of just walked
[1:24:17] away from the relationship
[1:24:18] hallelujah
[1:24:20] young people y'all better watch some of
[1:24:21] the traits that might be in
[1:24:23] certain people
[1:24:24] watch their family when you court in
[1:24:26] court they family too
[1:24:29] you better watch them trace because
[1:24:31] they'll show up now
[1:24:33] i mean they're i've seen people where
[1:24:35] you know like somebody family might have
[1:24:36] lost their mind at a certain age
[1:24:39] they lost their mind and all of a sudden
[1:24:41] you got to watch that child you got to
[1:24:42] watch that person because at a certain
[1:24:44] age something just kick in
[1:24:46] and they be they lost their mind and now
[1:24:47] you're dealing with it
[1:24:49] it's the truth and they're high
[1:24:51] oh glory and look you just tell me just
[1:24:54] that crazy uncle uh-huh
[1:24:56] know there's something that follows that
[1:24:58] family
[1:24:59] now the only way to break that is the
[1:25:00] power of the holy ghost
[1:25:03] that's why you better make sure they
[1:25:04] have the holy ghost
[1:25:07] let me read let me read let me read it
[1:25:09] says uh
[1:25:11] and this all of a sudden came up with
[1:25:12] some kind of idea and he just walked
[1:25:14] away he did something wrong to the
[1:25:15] little girl
[1:25:16] and much is promised her to do a certain
[1:25:19] thing then he didn't do it and instead
[1:25:21] of coming to the girl and apologizing
[1:25:23] like a gentleman should do
[1:25:25] he
[1:25:26] it just wasn't in him to do it
[1:25:29] and the father and mother called me to
[1:25:30] the scene and said we would desire to
[1:25:32] know what is wrong with our boy
[1:25:35] say now it's not easy to do sometime but
[1:25:38] you must be truthful and honest now look
[1:25:40] at this
[1:25:41] you know this this family calling
[1:25:42] brother branham tell us what's matter of
[1:25:44] our boy and brother branham going there
[1:25:46] not nothing spiritual
[1:25:48] no vision i'ma just tell you the truth
[1:25:52] because the truth can make you free
[1:25:56] so now it's easy he says not easy to do
[1:25:58] sometime but you must be truth and
[1:26:00] honest therefore the boy was a christian
[1:26:02] as far as a believer he had repented and
[1:26:05] had been baptized and had his position
[1:26:07] among the believers but yet had not
[1:26:10] received
[1:26:12] the baptism of the holy spirit no matter
[1:26:15] how much he thought he had
[1:26:19] and this is a problem even in the church
[1:26:20] today people think they receive the holy
[1:26:23] ghost but they haven't received it yet
[1:26:26] and what happens when certain things
[1:26:28] happen in life you realize where you
[1:26:30] stand
[1:26:31] when that trial hits you you realize
[1:26:33] where you stand because if you had the
[1:26:35] holy ghost you wouldn't be responding
[1:26:37] that way
[1:26:38] [Music]
[1:26:40] look at this
[1:26:41] he says you thinking you have and having
[1:26:43] it is two different things
[1:26:45] you might be able to try to say you have
[1:26:48] you might be able to show some evidence
[1:26:50] of some emotion but unless your life is
[1:26:53] vindicating what you're professing to
[1:26:55] have you still haven't got it
[1:26:58] no matter how many emotions how much you
[1:27:00] jump run sensations speaking in tongues
[1:27:04] or shining whatever you might lay it
[1:27:05] upon which is all right i believe in all
[1:27:08] that too but unless your life copes with
[1:27:10] your testimony then you haven't got it
[1:27:14] let's go on it says because the fruit of
[1:27:16] the spirit vindicates what you are just
[1:27:19] like the fruit of any tree tells what it
[1:27:20] is jesus said by their fruit you shall
[1:27:22] know them
[1:27:23] so now this young fellow's parents
[1:27:26] his mother is german he says no
[1:27:28] reflection on the german but there is a
[1:27:31] strain in that family a trait a strength
[1:27:34] in that family and that is he says
[1:27:36] they'll just sit and you can talk to
[1:27:38] them and they'll just stare you right in
[1:27:40] the face now this is a trait in this
[1:27:42] family
[1:27:43] this is a strain in this family all of
[1:27:45] them do the same thing you sit and talk
[1:27:47] to me just look at
[1:27:53] oh glory to god i i can go a lot of
[1:27:56] places with this
[1:27:58] some families have that role in our
[1:28:00] trait
[1:28:04] all right
[1:28:05] i mean they speak with their body
[1:28:06] language
[1:28:08] hallelujah
[1:28:09] right hey man but he say say this family
[1:28:11] just stare and just look at you and just
[1:28:12] stare
[1:28:14] and you're just pouring your heart out
[1:28:17] it's a trait in a family you can't make
[1:28:19] them no different
[1:28:21] right now look at what he said it says
[1:28:22] uh oh hallelujah this will set you free
[1:28:25] when you start understanding people and
[1:28:27] just some of these they they what we
[1:28:29] call idiosyncrasies
[1:28:31] just their makeup right you can you can
[1:28:33] get free from some stuff watch this oh
[1:28:35] glory to god some families love the
[1:28:38] gossip
[1:28:42] it's just in the family
[1:28:45] it's the only the holy ghost that take
[1:28:46] that out of you
[1:28:50] you just want to know anything just get
[1:28:51] around one of the members of that family
[1:28:55] it's a truth in the eye
[1:28:58] can't hold nothing
[1:29:00] you better not give no secret to that
[1:29:01] family
[1:29:02] your secret will be all over
[1:29:06] it's a truth anyhow y'all know y'all
[1:29:08] don't run into families like this
[1:29:10] and you just i mean sometimes you think
[1:29:12] it's just this person don't go look at
[1:29:14] their sister and their brother and they
[1:29:16] their dad and their mama and just
[1:29:17] sometimes sit in the house and just
[1:29:19] listen to happy listen listen to the
[1:29:21] conversation
[1:29:23] my god my god i ain't saying nothing
[1:29:25] about nobody but oh
[1:29:30] when you start using language like that
[1:29:32] you already know
[1:29:33] it's the truth in the house let me move
[1:29:35] on let me move on i'm coming home i'm
[1:29:37] coming home but he said this says uh
[1:29:39] they'll just sit and you can talk to
[1:29:41] them they'll just stare you right in the
[1:29:42] face that this this girl's sister the
[1:29:45] mother of this boy her sister i have
[1:29:47] come down the street many morning and
[1:29:49] this young lady be sitting out in the
[1:29:51] yard and i said good morning to you she
[1:29:54] just look at me and i stop and i say
[1:29:56] sure fine morning she would stand look
[1:30:00] right at you an intelligent woman and i
[1:30:03] say come up to see you sometime she just
[1:30:05] stand and look where her brothers are
[1:30:07] that way father and mothers that way
[1:30:10] traits
[1:30:12] so now the father the boy
[1:30:15] is strictly an irishman not so here's a
[1:30:18] irishman that married a german
[1:30:21] okay
[1:30:23] the father that boy now i'm gonna tell
[1:30:25] you look look y'all
[1:30:27] every nationality carries a spirit
[1:30:30] y'all ain't gonna say amen
[1:30:40] you got to understand some of the you
[1:30:42] know like there are certain uh languages
[1:30:46] they're spoken so hard
[1:30:48] and so rough
[1:30:50] german is one of those language
[1:30:52] creole is one of those another one of
[1:30:53] those language they speak it so hard it
[1:30:55] seems like they fussing all the time
[1:30:57] they're not fussy that's just the way it
[1:30:58] is
[1:31:00] that's just a trait
[1:31:03] and then you get all offended because
[1:31:05] they said they didn't stay with just
[1:31:07] talking
[1:31:09] that's just the way they are
[1:31:11] and they they got to get their point
[1:31:13] across
[1:31:16] it's the truth any high
[1:31:17] amen amen american got this the spirit
[1:31:20] of frolic and folly everything's a joke
[1:31:22] to the americans
[1:31:24] laugh about everything
[1:31:27] all right i'm go i'm going on the
[1:31:28] prophet already identified all these
[1:31:30] things these are traits y'all these are
[1:31:31] traits
[1:31:32] spirits
[1:31:34] all right look at this now look look
[1:31:35] look look
[1:31:36] it says uh
[1:31:38] the father is born strictly an irishman
[1:31:40] moody
[1:31:42] and high high-tempered
[1:31:44] the daddy
[1:31:46] moody and high-tempered high-strung
[1:31:49] that's his whole family like that except
[1:31:51] one other out of the family converted
[1:31:55] since now in this boy the father and
[1:31:57] mother both are christians filled with
[1:31:58] the holy ghost and they have brought
[1:32:00] this young man up in the way of the lord
[1:32:02] now the young man is about 17 or 18
[1:32:04] years old something along there very
[1:32:06] fine kid and he's been a real model boy
[1:32:08] at home nice kid and he's got a brother
[1:32:10] that's just vice versa
[1:32:12] says but the girls the mother's family
[1:32:14] lives close
[1:32:15] to a fine church but do you think they'd
[1:32:17] ever come over there no and they know
[1:32:20] it's right
[1:32:21] it says but it's just not in them to ask
[1:32:23] forgiveness or ask partly
[1:32:26] so that means they're not going to the
[1:32:27] altar to ask god to forgive them other
[1:32:29] sins there's a trait in them that stops
[1:32:31] them
[1:32:35] say they just won't do it it's just not
[1:32:37] in them this is not a genes in the
[1:32:39] father
[1:32:40] and the mother this boy no matter how
[1:32:43] much they are converted oh lord look at
[1:32:46] this statement no matter how much they
[1:32:49] are converted
[1:32:50] it still remains the flesh that's been
[1:32:53] interbred out to this boy
[1:32:55] so what came from the german side and
[1:32:57] what came from the irish side is in the
[1:32:59] boy
[1:33:01] it says therefore that boy has got a
[1:33:04] complex in him
[1:33:05] just like from his mother's family and
[1:33:08] they are not forgiving they will not
[1:33:10] apologize that's where that boy stands
[1:33:13] that's where it came up
[1:33:14] when he found himself in a situation
[1:33:17] where he needed to apologize it just was
[1:33:19] not in him even he a church boy
[1:33:23] even though he's a fine boy but there's
[1:33:25] a trait that's dominating there
[1:33:29] he says now i said to the father no
[1:33:31] matter how much you raise them up
[1:33:34] no now look out look look at you out of
[1:33:37] your family uh all of them drunks and
[1:33:38] fighting and shooting and cutting and so
[1:33:40] forth
[1:33:41] it's the truth in it huh i mean i come
[1:33:43] from a family where all the men were
[1:33:45] womanizers
[1:33:47] running from this woman to the next
[1:33:49] woman to the next woman and you know
[1:33:50] find out later on in their life they got
[1:33:52] kids from somebody when they were
[1:33:54] visiting somewhere what are you talking
[1:33:55] about what kind of life is that
[1:33:58] but it's the holy ghost that actually
[1:34:00] changes you and makes you a different
[1:34:02] person hallelujah glory your sisters
[1:34:06] could come from families where maybe a
[1:34:08] mama or grandma was very loose
[1:34:12] you had to watch your boyfriend coming
[1:34:14] to the house
[1:34:15] because your mama might try to take your
[1:34:17] boyfriend
[1:34:19] or your grandma might try to make a move
[1:34:22] on your boyfriend it's the truth any
[1:34:24] high
[1:34:25] them traits and families
[1:34:28] but it's the holy ghost that breaks that
[1:34:30] type of stuff
[1:34:36] hey man it's the truth
[1:34:38] a young man got to watch his daddy round
[1:34:40] his brown around his
[1:34:42] it's better half it's a trait he's seen
[1:34:44] these things in his daddy
[1:34:46] hallelujah glory to god
[1:34:50] amen
[1:34:51] watch your kids around certain
[1:34:53] environments
[1:34:56] amen
[1:34:57] glory to god like well that was when
[1:34:59] they was young that spirit is still
[1:35:01] there
[1:35:05] all right all right all right traits
[1:35:07] spirits
[1:35:09] follow families
[1:35:10] all right glory to god let me let me go
[1:35:13] it says now um
[1:35:16] all
[1:35:17] all them drunks and fighting and
[1:35:18] shooting and cutting and so forth now
[1:35:20] look at your family to the mother now
[1:35:22] look at brother brandon i'm giving these
[1:35:23] people advice they want to know what's
[1:35:24] the matter with their son look at your
[1:35:25] family can you imagine the prophet
[1:35:27] telling you something look at your
[1:35:28] family
[1:35:31] to the mother they're a bunch of people
[1:35:33] he's just telling the truth
[1:35:35] just sit there
[1:35:36] won't speak
[1:35:38] very independent
[1:35:40] so forth irreverent to religion that's
[1:35:42] your family
[1:35:44] right but i said it's not you
[1:35:46] you're the only one of all your sisters
[1:35:48] and brothers you are sweet kind and
[1:35:49] forgiving what does that
[1:35:52] you're you're in your tree part of that
[1:35:54] family tree yet you have received the
[1:35:56] holy ghost that's the thing that made
[1:35:57] you tend and sweet it's not your people
[1:35:59] anymore
[1:36:01] it's your christ that lives in you
[1:36:04] glory hallelujah
[1:36:07] i said to the boy look at your family
[1:36:09] practically all of them are drunks and
[1:36:11] so forth i said now and how moody and
[1:36:14] high-tempered and how strong but you're
[1:36:16] not
[1:36:17] you're kind forgiving what is it the
[1:36:19] holy spirit you know more what you are
[1:36:21] is christ in you i said now the same
[1:36:23] thing
[1:36:24] has to happen to your son
[1:36:29] now i want you to look at this high
[1:36:30] strung daddy
[1:36:33] look at this high strung daddy now
[1:36:35] brother branham just told him he was hot
[1:36:36] strong and look at how he manifested
[1:36:40] and the father raised up
[1:36:43] after brother adam told him that the
[1:36:45] father raised up and said my son went to
[1:36:48] the altar
[1:36:49] he was baptized correctly in the name of
[1:36:51] jesus christ sometimes we try to take up
[1:36:53] for our kids
[1:36:56] hallelujah and uh but but the prophet
[1:36:58] could see a little bit more than this
[1:37:00] look it said it said he was baptized in
[1:37:01] incorrectly in the name of jesus christ
[1:37:03] and water baptism said i know my son has
[1:37:06] come to christ
[1:37:09] i said that may be all right
[1:37:12] all the outward motions
[1:37:15] he might be identified as believer with
[1:37:18] the believers but until he's regenerated
[1:37:21] born again i'd advise
[1:37:24] that that young man to never marry a
[1:37:26] woman
[1:37:28] that's my advice
[1:37:30] that's no vision this is just a trait
[1:37:33] that's in your families
[1:37:35] in the mama's family and the daddy's
[1:37:37] family
[1:37:38] and until he's born again don't let that
[1:37:40] boy marry
[1:37:43] did i advise that you yup that young man
[1:37:45] never the married woman he'll make hell
[1:37:47] on earth for her
[1:37:49] and some some of us have relationships
[1:37:51] where it's just hell on earth it's
[1:37:53] because of a trait
[1:37:55] that we didn't identify
[1:37:58] hallelujah before you just run out there
[1:38:01] doing stuff might you might want to just
[1:38:02] get a little counsel
[1:38:05] and can you imagine brother branham
[1:38:06] giving counsel
[1:38:07] and telling the girl don't marry that
[1:38:09] boy there until he gets the holy ghost
[1:38:11] well he went and got baptized don't
[1:38:13] marry that boy there until he get the
[1:38:16] holy ghost because that boy there the
[1:38:18] boy that's going to church
[1:38:20] acting like he a christian
[1:38:22] looking like a christian that boy gonna
[1:38:24] make hell on earth
[1:38:27] for you
[1:38:31] look at this
[1:38:33] it says he'll make hell on earth for her
[1:38:35] until that gentle sweet
[1:38:38] uh a forgiving forgiving spirit of
[1:38:40] christ come in then that will be a
[1:38:43] paradox in itself to to take the very
[1:38:45] nature of a boy that's bred between
[1:38:47] father and mother and yet in his
[1:38:49] intellectuals he's trying his best to
[1:38:51] overcome it
[1:38:53] only in his intellectuals right he's
[1:38:56] trying his best to overcome it he can't
[1:38:58] do it
[1:39:00] he'll never overcome it
[1:39:02] christ will have to overcome it
[1:39:04] see that you can't do it it's christ
[1:39:07] that has to do within you
[1:39:08] all you can do is surrender more and
[1:39:10] more to christ amen says when he lets
[1:39:13] christ come in christ in then he's
[1:39:16] already overcome then it'll be a perfect
[1:39:18] paradox when a man is born of the spirit
[1:39:21] of god so see here's the thing that
[1:39:24] trait a man was following or that strain
[1:39:27] was in his family
[1:39:28] through just the the just the makeup of
[1:39:31] the family so when this boy ran into a
[1:39:33] little situation nice young man but run
[1:39:35] to a situation that trait showed up that
[1:39:37] he couldn't apologize broke the girl's
[1:39:39] heart and could not apologize as a
[1:39:41] gentleman he should have come back and
[1:39:42] apologized but couldn't do it and he'll
[1:39:45] go on from that girl to the next girl
[1:39:46] and let the holy ghost get a hold of him
[1:39:48] and changes the way he do things
[1:39:51] oh hallelujah to the lamb of god
[1:39:54] all right
[1:39:57] i'm looking at this
[1:39:58] amen i want to just
[1:40:00] um
[1:40:01] this scripture just really
[1:40:03] got me
[1:40:05] before i know him genesis 18 19 5 know
[1:40:07] him that he will command his children
[1:40:10] and his household after him
[1:40:12] and they shall keep the way of the lord
[1:40:14] to do justice and judgment
[1:40:17] that the lord may bring upon abraham
[1:40:18] that which he has spoken of him
[1:40:21] now um
[1:40:24] this this this just blesses my heart
[1:40:27] god saw positive traits inside of
[1:40:30] abraham
[1:40:32] right before this destruction of of
[1:40:34] sodom amen he makes these words after
[1:40:37] his visit visit to abraham and and his
[1:40:39] promise to sarah that she's going to
[1:40:41] have uh she's going to bear a son of her
[1:40:43] old age and god already saying what kind
[1:40:46] of father abraham going to be
[1:40:48] god already knows amen i want to say
[1:40:51] this to the young men that are not
[1:40:52] married god already knows what type of
[1:40:54] father you're going to be
[1:40:57] for for the young ladies that are not
[1:40:59] married god already knows the type of
[1:41:00] mother that you're going to be
[1:41:03] hallelujah and i love the way that god
[1:41:05] brags about abraham he says for i know
[1:41:08] him that he he will command his children
[1:41:10] and his household after him and they
[1:41:12] shall keep the way of the lord to do
[1:41:14] justice and judgment that the lord may
[1:41:16] bring upon abraham that which he has
[1:41:18] spoken of him now this this statement of
[1:41:20] he will command his children a household
[1:41:22] after him that means abraham's life is
[1:41:24] going to impact generations
[1:41:27] i want you to think about that your life
[1:41:29] will impact generations
[1:41:32] glory to god amen hallelujah hallelujah
[1:41:36] it's good to see you i saw ryan a little
[1:41:38] early it's good to see him uh your life
[1:41:40] can impact generations
[1:41:41] watch this now watch this it says uh his
[1:41:45] families will keep the ways of the lord
[1:41:48] now that blesses me
[1:41:50] that just blesses me if there is
[1:41:52] anything that any parent would want my
[1:41:54] mama wrote a song
[1:41:56] so i might not have a lot of money to
[1:41:58] leave my kids when i leave here but
[1:42:00] there's one thing that i want to leave
[1:42:02] my children
[1:42:03] a heritage
[1:42:05] of faith
[1:42:07] to guide me along my way
[1:42:10] right and then that's the greatest thing
[1:42:12] that a parent can leave their children
[1:42:14] is is to see them having a relationship
[1:42:17] with the lord jesus
[1:42:19] amen walking the same way the parent
[1:42:21] walk when it came to serving god
[1:42:24] amen that's the greatest thing that's
[1:42:26] the greatest treasure that a parent
[1:42:28] could have
[1:42:30] hear abraham is saying he's gonna god
[1:42:32] said he's gonna teach
[1:42:34] his family to keep
[1:42:36] the ways of the lord
[1:42:39] i think that's beautiful it says he was
[1:42:41] he will he will uh his seed will do
[1:42:43] justice and judgment and i thought to
[1:42:45] myself in business they will be just
[1:42:49] in judgment they will be just
[1:42:52] and i asked myself i see the negative
[1:42:54] trait i see the negative trait that kind
[1:42:56] of flowed down because i can you know i
[1:42:58] can go back in scripture and i can show
[1:43:00] you uh abraham lot he lied to abimelech
[1:43:04] eli the pharaoh genesis uh chapter 12
[1:43:06] verse 10 through 20 you'll see where he
[1:43:08] lied to abimelech amen also uh uh you
[1:43:12] know you find the same thing where isaac
[1:43:15] lot
[1:43:16] amen to abimelech in genesis 26 uh he
[1:43:19] lied to abimelech about rebecca being
[1:43:21] his his uh his sister so you know we
[1:43:23] could see that negative trait just kind
[1:43:25] of flowing but what is this positive
[1:43:26] thing that god sees in abraham
[1:43:29] what's this positive trait that's coming
[1:43:31] out
[1:43:32] hallelujah hallelujah i think we find
[1:43:34] something here in hebrews 11 verse 17
[1:43:37] through 20.
[1:43:40] let's look at this because you know
[1:43:42] abraham had a positive trait and he's
[1:43:45] what god begins is to do is write about
[1:43:47] abraham in
[1:43:49] the book of hebrews which was the the
[1:43:51] the chapter that kind of talks about the
[1:43:53] the heroes of faith
[1:43:56] amen sarah's name was listed there
[1:43:59] glory to god but we're also going to see
[1:44:01] isaac's name is listen there there's
[1:44:03] some positive trait that's flowing down
[1:44:06] passing from abraham
[1:44:08] going down into isaac and i believe that
[1:44:10] same trait is inside of us today
[1:44:14] here hebrews 11 verse 17 by faith
[1:44:18] abraham when he was tried
[1:44:22] offered up isaac
[1:44:23] and he that had received the promises
[1:44:26] uh offered up his only begotten son of
[1:44:29] whom it was said that in isaac shall thy
[1:44:32] seed be called accounting that god was
[1:44:35] able to raise him up even from the dead
[1:44:38] from whence all which also he received
[1:44:41] them in a figure by faith isaac blessed
[1:44:44] jacob and eats all concerning things to
[1:44:46] come
[1:44:47] now i want to just look at this amen
[1:44:50] just for
[1:44:51] a little bit
[1:44:52] because the prophet made a statement in
[1:44:54] the message
[1:44:55] masterpiece it talked about how when a
[1:44:58] uh when adam fell here on the earth uh
[1:45:02] he fell into sin because of
[1:45:04] eve introducing him to something that he
[1:45:06] should have never got involved in but
[1:45:08] willingly adam went out betraying christ
[1:45:11] amen he willingly went out and got
[1:45:13] involved in this thing that eve amen got
[1:45:15] involved with hallelujah now i don't
[1:45:17] believe that adam had it in him to
[1:45:19] redeem eve he couldn't bring her back to
[1:45:22] the place which she left
[1:45:23] hallelujah that was not inside of adam
[1:45:25] that's only in christ but he went out to
[1:45:28] portray christ
[1:45:30] let's look at it oh hallelujah
[1:45:33] look at this now look at this look at
[1:45:35] this amen brother branham said when uh
[1:45:37] when adam failed
[1:45:39] god immediately began to go back to work
[1:45:42] again because he had his masterpiece
[1:45:44] adam in the garden of eden but but when
[1:45:46] adam fell the masterpiece fell so god
[1:45:49] immediately began to go back and and
[1:45:51] rebuild that masterpiece he said he put
[1:45:53] it on four foundations
[1:45:56] hallelujah the first foundation was
[1:45:58] abraham's faith
[1:46:00] the second foundation was isaac's love
[1:46:04] the third foundation was jacob's grace
[1:46:07] and the full foundation was joseph's
[1:46:09] perfection
[1:46:11] hallelujah brother adam said god began
[1:46:13] to rebuild this masterpiece and he put
[1:46:16] it on a sure foundation abraham's faith
[1:46:20] isaac's love jacob's grace and joseph
[1:46:22] perfection now when we look at abraham
[1:46:24] we can see abraham's faith abraham took
[1:46:27] off looking for a city whose building
[1:46:29] maker was god his faith was was was
[1:46:31] manifested just about in everything he
[1:46:34] did
[1:46:36] we look at isaac's love we look at
[1:46:38] jacob's grace and amen and jacob should
[1:46:40] have lost his life multiple times but
[1:46:42] god stepped in he should have lost his
[1:46:44] life against his brother esau should
[1:46:46] have lost his life against laban but god
[1:46:48] stepped in and gave jacob grace
[1:46:51] hallelujah joseph's perfection there was
[1:46:54] brother branham say there was nothing
[1:46:56] against him just to scratch
[1:46:58] to advise his father not to tell pharaoh
[1:47:00] that they were shepherds because a
[1:47:02] shepherd was an abomination amongst the
[1:47:04] egyptians but in joseph there was
[1:47:06] perfection he got sold into slavery and
[1:47:10] never did anything wrong
[1:47:11] joseph's perfection
[1:47:13] but isaac's love that really
[1:47:16] struck me why would brother branham
[1:47:18] tell us that this foundation that god
[1:47:21] used to rebuild the masterpiece the
[1:47:24] second foundation was isaac's love
[1:47:27] isaac's
[1:47:28] love now as i processed this
[1:47:31] first thing came to my mind was this
[1:47:33] love story
[1:47:35] between isaac and rebecca
[1:47:38] hallelujah now there's things inside
[1:47:40] this love story that certainly type
[1:47:42] christ
[1:47:43] amen but let's look at it the the
[1:47:45] relationship that isaac had with rebecca
[1:47:48] was a type of the relationship that the
[1:47:50] church has with christ today brother
[1:47:52] adam says uh rebecca watered
[1:47:55] the camels which was the beast of power
[1:47:58] amen she watered those camels and the
[1:48:00] same camels that she water is what was
[1:48:03] used to carry her to her isaac
[1:48:06] he says in the church of the living god
[1:48:08] today is rejoicing and watering the
[1:48:12] power of the holy ghost that'll pick her
[1:48:14] up someday and take her yonder to meet
[1:48:18] the isaac in the air for the wedding
[1:48:19] supper
[1:48:21] brother this message that we send amen
[1:48:23] to we're watering the camel we're
[1:48:25] watering a power that's gonna change our
[1:48:28] bodies this message that we're feeding
[1:48:30] on
[1:48:32] do you realize when when when
[1:48:35] when rebecca amen left her people
[1:48:37] hallelujah to the lamb of god amen she
[1:48:40] had to walk out by faith
[1:48:42] she had to leave her family behind she
[1:48:45] had to leave her friends behind she had
[1:48:47] to leave the things of the world behind
[1:48:52] and she had to go forth to a man that
[1:48:54] she never even saw a picture of
[1:48:56] all she heard was the testimony of his
[1:48:59] character
[1:49:00] and she was drawn in by the testimony of
[1:49:03] the character
[1:49:05] also she was all she was already kin to
[1:49:08] this man
[1:49:09] by being kind to him she knew that there
[1:49:11] were certain characteristics that would
[1:49:13] already be there family traits
[1:49:18] hallelujah we already came to christ
[1:49:20] look at this another statement brother
[1:49:22] branham makes here
[1:49:24] uh
[1:49:25] and i said rebecca had to decide to
[1:49:28] leave everything behind to go to isaac
[1:49:30] we have to we have to leave the world
[1:49:32] and our denominational thinking behind
[1:49:34] to pursue christ the promised son
[1:49:37] uh it was in the field and in the
[1:49:39] evening time that isaac and rebecca
[1:49:42] first met and brother branham say it was
[1:49:44] love at first sight
[1:49:47] i just have a question do you love the
[1:49:49] words
[1:49:52] are you still fighting with it
[1:49:56] you know a husband and wife that's
[1:49:58] always in the back
[1:50:00] background and at home fighting all the
[1:50:02] time it don't make a real comfortable
[1:50:03] environment
[1:50:05] it's hard
[1:50:06] hard to raise kids in an environment
[1:50:08] like that
[1:50:10] it could cut i mean
[1:50:11] and i'm going to tell you some kids
[1:50:13] refuse to get married because of the way
[1:50:14] they see any mamas and daddies act
[1:50:19] don't want i want to avoid marriage i
[1:50:20] want to avoid marriage do you see what
[1:50:22] that did to my mom and daddy
[1:50:26] but but we don't want to fight with the
[1:50:27] word if the words say don't do this we
[1:50:30] ain't gonna do it the words say don't do
[1:50:32] that dress this way dress that's exactly
[1:50:34] yes lord yes lord that's the way we want
[1:50:37] to respond to the word just have a
[1:50:38] submissive attitude to the word but
[1:50:40] don't fight with it
[1:50:42] well i think i can do a little bit of
[1:50:43] this and that
[1:50:45] no that's not what god say
[1:50:49] run from the things of the world
[1:50:51] shun the very appearance of the things
[1:50:52] of the world
[1:50:54] let me go on a little further let me go
[1:50:55] on a little further hallelujah you know
[1:50:57] i'm going to tell you uh typically
[1:51:00] when you see a child maybe struggling in
[1:51:02] a particular area with things of the
[1:51:04] world
[1:51:05] oftentimes the parent struggles in that
[1:51:07] same area
[1:51:10] the parent struggles that the parent
[1:51:12] does not have a conviction in that area
[1:51:15] because if they had a conviction they
[1:51:16] would stand against that child
[1:51:19] it's the truth anyhow
[1:51:21] hallelujah glory to god hey man you i
[1:51:23] mean sometimes parents our kids gonna
[1:51:25] push us to the limit
[1:51:27] that's all right god will take care of
[1:51:28] them after that after they push it to
[1:51:30] the limit look this is my house and you
[1:51:32] ain't gonna do that in my house
[1:51:36] and that and sometimes they make it uh i
[1:51:38] heard you been talking that that's this
[1:51:40] your house now you're gonna have to
[1:51:41] prove it
[1:51:44] i've been there i had to do it this is
[1:51:46] my house
[1:51:48] i have to prove it now i don't want to
[1:51:50] prove it but i'ma have to prove it
[1:51:53] glory to god
[1:51:55] now leave the rest of that up to god
[1:51:57] when i honor god i know god gonna honor
[1:51:58] me
[1:52:02] brother branham said uh it was in the
[1:52:05] field and then evening time that isaac
[1:52:07] and rebecca first met and it was love at
[1:52:09] first sight
[1:52:11] he said she was taken into abraham's
[1:52:13] tent and there became an heir and
[1:52:15] inherited all things this is a type of
[1:52:17] the church meeting christ in the air and
[1:52:20] going to the wedding supper so we can
[1:52:22] see amen this love story of isaac and
[1:52:25] rebecca we can see how the church is
[1:52:27] tight with that but when i thought about
[1:52:30] this trait i felt that it was a lot
[1:52:32] deeper than the love story between isaac
[1:52:35] and rebecca
[1:52:37] oh hallelujah hallelujah amen this trait
[1:52:41] that i saw amen and isaac this very
[1:52:45] positive trait that i believe god saw in
[1:52:47] isaac and god god god said it for i know
[1:52:50] him he said this about abraham for i
[1:52:53] know him that we he will command his
[1:52:56] children
[1:52:59] and i believe this this just my personal
[1:53:01] faith i believe the way that we can
[1:53:03] command our children is by the way we
[1:53:04] live before our children
[1:53:09] we don't have to make them do nothing
[1:53:11] but it's the example that we set before
[1:53:13] our children that our children want to
[1:53:15] follow
[1:53:17] i know my dad is a christian i know my
[1:53:20] mama's a christian and i want to follow
[1:53:21] her
[1:53:28] we see it we see it
[1:53:31] we see it
[1:53:34] in genesis 22.
[1:53:39] let's just read a little bit of it but
[1:53:41] this is how we this is that positive
[1:53:42] trait
[1:53:44] that is flowing down from abraham
[1:53:47] and we see it rise up in isaac
[1:53:51] here in genesis 22 verse 1 it says and
[1:53:54] it came to pass
[1:53:56] after these things that god did tempt
[1:53:58] abraham
[1:54:00] so it was a trial for abraham god
[1:54:02] allowed a trial to come into his life
[1:54:04] and said to him abraham
[1:54:06] and say behold here i am
[1:54:08] and he said take now thy son
[1:54:12] thine only son
[1:54:13] isaac
[1:54:14] whom thou lovest
[1:54:16] and get thee into the land of moriah
[1:54:19] and offer him therefore a burnt offering
[1:54:22] upon one of the mountains which i
[1:54:24] will tell thee of
[1:54:28] and abraham rose up early now now i want
[1:54:30] you to understand
[1:54:32] when we enter verse 3
[1:54:34] abraham is demonstrating his
[1:54:37] faithfulness to god
[1:54:40] isaac
[1:54:41] also has seen that same faithfulness
[1:54:44] that abraham had he this is why abraham
[1:54:46] can command his children because isaac
[1:54:48] know that his dad has been faithful in
[1:54:50] serving god
[1:54:52] his daddy and faithful and everything
[1:54:54] that he's dead is that he's done i mean
[1:54:55] it's just something about and you know
[1:54:58] at this stage of life obviously isaac is
[1:55:00] just a teenager
[1:55:02] see it's in those years that we're
[1:55:04] really influencing our kids the most in
[1:55:06] those teenage years you realize amen
[1:55:09] they have uh the teenage years is the
[1:55:11] shortest
[1:55:12] time period of their life
[1:55:14] so you get to be a child up to the age
[1:55:16] 12.
[1:55:18] and now they're trying to force you at
[1:55:20] 18 to become an adult
[1:55:23] right at 18 you still got 10 on the end
[1:55:26] of it but they're still trying to force
[1:55:27] you to be an adult
[1:55:29] but really you get from 13 to 19 roughly
[1:55:32] six or seven years to be a teenager
[1:55:35] but after that you are an adult for the
[1:55:36] rest of your life so the shortest time
[1:55:39] period is one of the most influential
[1:55:42] time periods
[1:55:47] i wish i would have brought that out at
[1:55:49] the men's me that's it
[1:55:52] says abraham rose up early in the
[1:55:54] morning and saddled his ass and took uh
[1:55:56] two of his young men with him and i took
[1:55:58] his son enclaved the wood for the burnt
[1:56:00] offering and rose up and went into the
[1:56:02] place of which god told him then on the
[1:56:05] third day abraham lifted up his eyes and
[1:56:08] saw the place so far off
[1:56:09] and abraham said unto his young men
[1:56:12] about ye here with the ass
[1:56:14] and i in the land will go younger and
[1:56:16] worship and come again to you now
[1:56:18] abraham is speaking by faith
[1:56:24] abraham could not share amen what he was
[1:56:27] going to do he can share that with isaac
[1:56:29] he can share that with sarah he couldn't
[1:56:32] share that amen with these young lads he
[1:56:34] had to hold this thing to himself
[1:56:37] and there's some things that god is
[1:56:39] giving you you got to hold to yourself
[1:56:41] you can't give it to everybody else
[1:56:47] but his faith says we'll come again to
[1:56:49] you
[1:56:53] look at this in verse 6 and abraham took
[1:56:54] the wood of the burnt offering
[1:56:57] and laid it upon the eyes of his son
[1:57:00] and he took the finest ham and the knife
[1:57:02] and they went both of them together
[1:57:05] and i love verse 7.
[1:57:07] because
[1:57:08] this is where i see
[1:57:10] isaac seeing all the faithfulness in his
[1:57:12] daddy
[1:57:13] and see i like to say it like this this
[1:57:15] ain't isaac's first rodeo
[1:57:17] this ain't the first time he went to a
[1:57:19] sacrifice
[1:57:21] and he done went so much that he
[1:57:23] recognizes everything that's supposed to
[1:57:25] be there
[1:57:27] oh hallelujah
[1:57:30] do your children actually where's sister
[1:57:32] so-and-so where's brother so-and-so
[1:57:34] because they know who's supposed to be
[1:57:36] in church
[1:57:38] they've been coming so often that they
[1:57:39] know who's missing
[1:57:45] and i expected abraham his father
[1:57:49] and said my father and it said here am i
[1:57:52] my son
[1:57:54] and it said behold the fire
[1:57:56] and the woods that i see fire and i'm
[1:57:59] carrying wood
[1:58:01] jesus carried across
[1:58:03] and i'm carrying wood he said and behold
[1:58:06] in the wood where is the lamb
[1:58:10] for a burnt offering
[1:58:13] i mean isaac asked him the right
[1:58:15] question
[1:58:16] and abraham glory to god amen a man
[1:58:19] walking by faith all he can do is answer
[1:58:22] with a faith answer
[1:58:24] and his face said and abraham said my
[1:58:27] son
[1:58:28] god
[1:58:29] will provide himself
[1:58:32] i just love that brother brother solomon
[1:58:34] helped me see that some years ago not
[1:58:36] for himself but god would provide
[1:58:40] himself a lamb
[1:58:42] for a burnt orphan so they went both of
[1:58:44] them together
[1:58:46] what a beautiful beautiful story
[1:58:52] i i i
[1:58:54] you all know the rest of it
[1:58:56] abraham took isaac up this mountain
[1:59:00] and isaac was willing
[1:59:03] to lay himself down to become the
[1:59:05] sacrifice
[1:59:07] so when brother branham said that the
[1:59:09] foundation that second foundation was
[1:59:12] isaac's love
[1:59:13] is because we can see the love of christ
[1:59:16] reflected through the promised son isaac
[1:59:19] that he was willing to lay down his own
[1:59:22] life
[1:59:23] not just
[1:59:25] oh mariah
[1:59:27] cause i i told you all this before and i
[1:59:28] got quotes to prove it brother branham
[1:59:31] said that abraham took isaac up the same
[1:59:34] heel
[1:59:36] that christ himself would be buried on
[1:59:40] this was not a mistake this was not an
[1:59:42] accident i mean the same hill in
[1:59:45] jerusalem when i went to israel a number
[1:59:47] of years ago as as they brought us into
[1:59:50] jerusalem we had spent all of our time
[1:59:52] outside of jerusalem and uh the last
[1:59:54] five days we went to jerusalem and when
[1:59:55] we got in there the the uh the the tour
[1:59:58] guide he said this is mariah
[2:00:01] i said uh
[2:00:02] i said and everybody else probably had
[2:00:04] no idea what the man just said i said
[2:00:06] did you did you say that this is mariah
[2:00:09] he said yeah this is moriah i said now
[2:00:11] do you realize what you're saying
[2:00:13] they say yeah
[2:00:15] i say moriah is the place that abraham
[2:00:17] brought isaac he said yes this is mariah
[2:00:22] i said well
[2:00:23] where's
[2:00:24] calvary he said just on the other side
[2:00:27] of the hill i say uh well it's my first
[2:00:30] time in israel
[2:00:32] i don't know what just on the other side
[2:00:34] of the hill mean
[2:00:35] my first time seeing this place so i
[2:00:38] pulled out my google app
[2:00:41] and i just put in the question how far
[2:00:44] is mariah from calvary
[2:00:47] and when i got the response back they
[2:00:49] said a four minute walk
[2:00:54] when i saw those results that a light
[2:00:57] bulb just went off you mean to tell me
[2:01:00] that abraham brought isaac to the same
[2:01:04] mountain that jesus was going to be
[2:01:06] offered on how perfect could our god be
[2:01:11] how perfect can god be to do something
[2:01:13] like that
[2:01:14] it is not just a bible story it's god's
[2:01:18] love story to us
[2:01:22] and i looked at isaac this trait that
[2:01:24] was in isaac
[2:01:26] is that he had a willingness
[2:01:29] to surrender himself
[2:01:32] to become a sacrifice
[2:01:34] the burnt offering and god had to stop
[2:01:37] abraham abraham abraham stays still your
[2:01:39] hand
[2:01:41] i see that you're faithful i see that
[2:01:43] you love me and see i'm gonna tell you
[2:01:44] god got to watch you in the midst of
[2:01:46] your trial to see how faithful you're
[2:01:48] gonna be
[2:01:49] you can't be faithful until the trial
[2:01:52] you've got to be faithful in the midst
[2:01:54] of the trial
[2:01:59] the foundation of isaac's love
[2:02:03] was there because of what isaac was
[2:02:05] willing to do not his relationship with
[2:02:06] rebecca that was beautiful but because
[2:02:09] he was willing to lay his life down this
[2:02:11] is where god you know uh uh uh spoke to
[2:02:13] abraham said no still your hand i i
[2:02:15] had a ram in the bush pull that ram out
[2:02:18] a male lamb ram brought it up there and
[2:02:20] later on we see god did provide himself
[2:02:22] the sacrifice when jesus
[2:02:25] came to the same spot to be off of our
[2:02:27] sins
[2:02:29] there he was blessed and
[2:02:32] i'd just like to read the rest of this
[2:02:33] because this is your blessing this is
[2:02:35] for you
[2:02:36] verse 15. let's skip down there i'm
[2:02:38] sorry verse 14. and abraham called the
[2:02:41] name of the place
[2:02:42] jehovah jireh
[2:02:44] my provider
[2:02:47] as it said to this day in the mount of
[2:02:49] the lord
[2:02:50] uh it shall be seen and the angel lord
[2:02:53] called an abraham out of the heaven the
[2:02:54] second time and said by myself have i
[2:02:57] sworn
[2:03:00] saith the lord for because thou has done
[2:03:01] this thing
[2:03:03] and hast thou has not withheld our son
[2:03:05] that only son
[2:03:08] that in blessing
[2:03:09] i will bless thee
[2:03:11] and in multiplying i will multiply thy
[2:03:13] seed as the stars of the heaven and as
[2:03:16] the sand which is upon the sea shall not
[2:03:18] seed shall possess
[2:03:21] the gate of his enemies
[2:03:23] what is your enemy this morning
[2:03:26] as a seed of abraham you are promised
[2:03:28] you're going to possess it
[2:03:30] that means you're not going to be
[2:03:31] defeated
[2:03:34] no matter what you're up against
[2:03:37] let me just finish with this last quote
[2:03:39] here from the message the identified
[2:03:40] masterpiece of god
[2:03:42] oh i just love this
[2:03:45] god's love was expressed through isaac
[2:03:47] his willingness to be sacrificed at
[2:03:48] mount moriah it demonstrated god's love
[2:03:50] and provision and ultimate sacrifice
[2:03:52] with mankind
[2:03:54] that's what it was all about hearing
[2:03:56] this message that identified masterpiece
[2:03:57] of god brother branham says but we find
[2:03:59] out
[2:04:00] when he started again
[2:04:02] it started with abraham he talked about
[2:04:03] rebuilding this
[2:04:06] uh
[2:04:06] masterpiece he started with abraham
[2:04:09] and abraham he started him on an
[2:04:11] unconditional covenant so when abraham
[2:04:13] was lying about sarah being
[2:04:16] his uh his sister well before abraham
[2:04:19] told that lie god had already given
[2:04:21] abraham an unconditional covenant
[2:04:27] that unconditional over covenant
[2:04:28] overrode all of his actions
[2:04:32] i love this look he says uh now if you
[2:04:35] will i have i've already done it i've
[2:04:38] blessed you you and your seed and so
[2:04:40] forth after you it was an unconditional
[2:04:42] covenant he started with abraham his
[2:04:45] workmanship again and now with his
[2:04:48] unconditional covet then we find out he
[2:04:50] based on abraham and give him the
[2:04:52] covenant unconditional with the promise
[2:04:55] then he came to the patriots we come
[2:04:58] next in the old testament as we go down
[2:05:00] here he displayed the foundations of his
[2:05:02] work
[2:05:03] now we have abraham
[2:05:05] it says now we have abraham
[2:05:08] glory uh isaac jacob joseph the four
[2:05:11] patriots now abraham represented faith
[2:05:15] work
[2:05:16] faith because abraham was of faith he
[2:05:18] had that great faith because he
[2:05:20] staggered not at the promise of god
[2:05:22] through unbelief when we say the chips
[2:05:24] is down and everything against him he's
[2:05:28] still held on to god
[2:05:30] and that's that's the way we are when
[2:05:31] the chips are down everything against us
[2:05:34] we still hold on to god
[2:05:36] so it's just it's just something that we
[2:05:38] just we just
[2:05:40] it's a gene this is trading us we
[2:05:42] believe god listened to the testimony
[2:05:44] last week from brother solomon with his
[2:05:46] air conditioning laid hands on it
[2:05:49] that's a trait
[2:05:51] it's a trait from god
[2:05:53] it's a trait
[2:05:55] i mean i i i i've seen um i remember
[2:05:58] brother wisdom sharing a testimony with
[2:05:59] him one time he said he got on on the
[2:06:01] highway and don't realize didn't realize
[2:06:03] he had done this but they got it got to
[2:06:05] a place where the gas was running out in
[2:06:07] this car in the middle of nowhere
[2:06:10] but that trait kicked in
[2:06:12] god i believe you put gas in the car
[2:06:14] till i can get to a gas station
[2:06:16] and that car kept driving till he got to
[2:06:18] a gas station
[2:06:20] i mean brother brother wesker one time
[2:06:22] locked his keys in the car
[2:06:25] back then when he had no triple a i'm
[2:06:26] gonna tell you
[2:06:28] aaa
[2:06:29] sometimes can actually reduce our faith
[2:06:33] these services that we have all these
[2:06:35] services that we get it reduces our
[2:06:37] faith we don't have to use our faith we
[2:06:38] just call somebody
[2:06:44] he said i mean i'm in the middle of
[2:06:46] nowhere it's it's the winter time and my
[2:06:48] my keys are locked in the car i got to
[2:06:49] get home i can't be stuck out here stay
[2:06:52] laid hands on the car
[2:06:56] lay your hands on the car and the locks
[2:06:57] pop just like that
[2:07:00] bro let's go share that testimony years
[2:07:02] ago
[2:07:03] it's that trait that is inside of him
[2:07:06] called things that be not as though they
[2:07:08] were
[2:07:12] he says uh
[2:07:15] everything's against him he's still held
[2:07:17] on to god now i want to ask you if
[2:07:19] everything's against you are you still
[2:07:20] holding on
[2:07:21] do you still got a praise on the inside
[2:07:27] this last statement says in this next
[2:07:29] statement i should say he says then we
[2:07:32] have isaac
[2:07:33] which was beloved son
[2:07:35] which represented love
[2:07:37] because abraham being a type of god as
[2:07:40] as it was offered genesis 22 we find out
[2:07:43] that he carried the wood up the hill and
[2:07:46] everything portrayed christ foreshadowed
[2:07:48] him and then the ram came and was often
[2:07:51] in his stand that's isaac's love now
[2:07:54] that was faith
[2:07:55] love
[2:07:57] and jacob which means supplanta and see
[2:08:00] you know when i was just meditating on
[2:08:01] the scripture i just i'm like i know
[2:08:03] it's not just in in in the love story
[2:08:06] that isaac and rebecca have it got to be
[2:08:08] something greater that trait got to be
[2:08:10] producers upgraded and when i thought
[2:08:11] about genesis 22 i said oh there it is
[2:08:14] and then i found the quote where brother
[2:08:15] branham said i said yes i'm in the right
[2:08:17] channel
[2:08:19] i like to run my thoughts back through
[2:08:21] the message
[2:08:22] because i'm gonna tell you satan will
[2:08:23] give you some thoughts and they'd be so
[2:08:25] far out you ain't got nothing to support
[2:08:27] it with
[2:08:29] hallelujah
[2:08:30] look he says now that was faith in faith
[2:08:32] love and jacob which means the planner
[2:08:35] and that's a deceive and we realize that
[2:08:37] jacob's life represented really
[2:08:38] represented grace because it was grace
[2:08:41] of god all the time with jacob then come
[2:08:43] joseph there's nothing against joseph he
[2:08:45] was the perfect perfected one god's
[2:08:47] prophet that came forth among his
[2:08:49] brethren and hated without a cause and
[2:08:51] was soul and in every way his life
[2:08:53] foreshadowed the life of jesus christ
[2:08:56] came to his own his own received him not
[2:08:58] as joseph was hated by his brother and
[2:09:00] thrown into a ditch supposedly be dead
[2:09:03] took out exalted to the right hand of
[2:09:05] pharaoh and when he left the throne they
[2:09:07] blowed the trumpet now every knee had to
[2:09:10] bow
[2:09:11] to joseph
[2:09:13] every knee had to bow
[2:09:15] to joseph
[2:09:16] hear
[2:09:17] this strain
[2:09:20] um
[2:09:21] brother branham speaks of it in spoken
[2:09:24] words original seed and there is a
[2:09:26] strain
[2:09:27] a trait
[2:09:29] that has come through to us
[2:09:31] we thank god for this
[2:09:33] we're built on the foundation of faith
[2:09:35] love
[2:09:36] amen grace perfection
[2:09:39] we're built on that we're standing on
[2:09:41] that foundation as as god's masterpiece
[2:09:44] amen in this final day here in the
[2:09:46] spoken word's original seat my final
[2:09:48] quote says christ couldn't help being
[2:09:51] what he was
[2:09:53] he was the son of god
[2:09:55] that's it
[2:09:56] see what i mean now see if you were
[2:09:59] intended
[2:10:01] you see the word of god you believe it
[2:10:03] because why there's something new no see
[2:10:06] why says have you ever heard of strain
[2:10:10] in a family
[2:10:11] this is this is beautiful for me you
[2:10:13] know the reason that you believe the
[2:10:14] message
[2:10:15] the way you believe the message because
[2:10:17] there's a trait
[2:10:19] that you were born with
[2:10:21] that you can help but identify
[2:10:23] with truth
[2:10:25] you had that before you was even born
[2:10:27] it's the trait of predestination
[2:10:30] the gene of election
[2:10:33] it was dwelling inside of you that's why
[2:10:35] as soon as you said it you saw it you
[2:10:36] said amen to it
[2:10:39] i was thinking to myself you know
[2:10:41] many of our kids and grandkids they
[2:10:43] don't they don't they don't know what we
[2:10:45] came out of
[2:10:46] we try to explain to them what the
[2:10:48] denominational system was all about and
[2:10:50] why we left there why this message meant
[2:10:52] so much to us right we try to explain
[2:10:54] but they just don't understand the
[2:10:55] reason it is because they've never been
[2:10:56] there
[2:10:58] but as soon as they go
[2:11:00] as soon as they go they begin to realize
[2:11:02] well it don't take them more than a year
[2:11:05] six months to see all the fallacy in it
[2:11:10] but the pride
[2:11:13] the pride is what stops them from coming
[2:11:15] back
[2:11:16] that's all that's stopped they already
[2:11:17] know the truth they don't seen it it it
[2:11:19] produced itself just like that
[2:11:23] it's a spirit that follows denominations
[2:11:26] right but it's the pride that actually
[2:11:27] stopping god would strip that pride away
[2:11:30] and let me tell you when something go
[2:11:32] wrong they know who to call they ain't
[2:11:33] calling that denominational church for
[2:11:34] no prayer
[2:11:35] they know who to call to get would you
[2:11:37] have the church
[2:11:42] and you know what the church does
[2:11:44] we pray
[2:11:45] we take that request before god but i'm
[2:11:47] going to tell you something sometime and
[2:11:48] when i when i hear prayer requests i
[2:11:50] don't hear the same thing y'all be
[2:11:52] hearing
[2:11:54] i don't hear the same thing you hear
[2:11:55] i'll be hearing oh yes lord
[2:11:57] you're getting their attention
[2:12:00] yes lord you yes you let you let that
[2:12:02] happen to get their attention now
[2:12:03] they're gonna put their faith in you
[2:12:05] they can't trust nothing else but you
[2:12:11] and that's where you want them to be at
[2:12:12] yes lord
[2:12:14] use it for your glory god
[2:12:17] look at this
[2:12:19] it says uh have you have you uh ever
[2:12:22] heard of a strain in a family
[2:12:25] a son would kind of impersonate his
[2:12:26] father or the mother or the grandfather
[2:12:28] the grandmother that strain
[2:12:31] in the family you heard of it haven't
[2:12:33] you
[2:12:34] well
[2:12:35] that's the same thing from your
[2:12:37] destination
[2:12:38] you were supposed to be here in the
[2:12:40] right way at the beginning
[2:12:42] but being that you come the way you did
[2:12:44] you're subject to the fall
[2:12:46] but being that you're predestinated
[2:12:49] you hear the word
[2:12:50] it brings you right back where you were
[2:12:53] producing it
[2:12:54] just by hearing and receiving the word
[2:12:56] it brings you back to where you were
[2:12:57] producing amen never saw that before
[2:13:00] brings you right what makes you believe
[2:13:02] the word of god and turn down these
[2:13:04] other things is because there's
[2:13:06] something in you way back yonder uh you
[2:13:10] you are made to live here forever i want
[2:13:12] scripture for that preacher here it
[2:13:14] comes
[2:13:15] all that he foreknew
[2:13:19] he's called
[2:13:20] all that he has called
[2:13:23] good god almighty
[2:13:25] he has justified
[2:13:27] and all that he has justified
[2:13:31] he is already
[2:13:32] glorified
[2:13:34] i thank god for that godly trait
[2:13:36] dwelling inside of me
[2:13:39] that treated predestination
[2:13:41] amen and i believe it's slowing down
[2:13:43] from me to my loved ones and
[2:13:45] and i'm just claiming each and every one
[2:13:47] of them
[2:13:49] by the grace of god i'm claiming each
[2:13:51] and every one of them thank god for his
[2:13:53] word
[2:13:54] the lord bless your church
[2:13:56] amen
[2:13:57] [Applause]
[2:14:05] let's pray musicians you all can come
[2:14:09] lord jesus
[2:14:13] how grateful we are for the word
[2:14:17] how grateful we are for truth
[2:14:22] how grateful we are for this trait of
[2:14:25] predestination that flows
[2:14:28] through us
[2:14:29] is what allows us to be able to respond
[2:14:32] to the word with an amen
[2:14:35] we don't have to fight with the word
[2:14:37] that's what
[2:14:38] that's what lot and his family were
[2:14:41] doing down in sodom fighting with the
[2:14:43] word
[2:14:45] running from truth
[2:14:48] god but you went down there and
[2:14:52] you uh
[2:14:54] even answered a prayer for abraham that
[2:14:56] he never even prayed but he had a desire
[2:14:59] to read their
[2:15:00] book of genesis
[2:15:03] 18 i believe it was god
[2:15:05] after you said these powerful things
[2:15:07] about him say i'm going to turn i'm
[2:15:08] going down into sodom because i hear
[2:15:10] about the sin down there and i need to
[2:15:11] go and
[2:15:12] check it out you went to investigate
[2:15:16] sent two angels before you before you
[2:15:18] destroyed it
[2:15:20] the lord just uh reports abraham praying
[2:15:22] after every 50
[2:15:24] would you destroy the city for 50.
[2:15:28] he said no no i won't destroy for 50. he
[2:15:30] said what if it's just lacking five of
[2:15:32] the 50 would you destroy the city if
[2:15:34] it's lacking five and only 45 you say
[2:15:36] nope i won't destroy for 45.
[2:15:41] well what about 40
[2:15:44] i won't destroy for 40.
[2:15:47] what about 30 god would you destroy this
[2:15:49] 30 righteous people that are living
[2:15:52] there
[2:15:53] would you destroy it no i won't destroy
[2:15:55] it for 30.
[2:15:58] god don't be upset with me what about 20
[2:16:02] if there's 20 would you spare the city
[2:16:04] of sodom and gomorrah for just 20
[2:16:06] righteous people
[2:16:08] so if i can find 20 of them down there
[2:16:12] i'll spare it
[2:16:15] abraham just intervened and standing in
[2:16:17] the gap god that's what we're doing
[2:16:19] we're praying coming to these prayer
[2:16:21] meetings on tuesdays
[2:16:22] we're standing in the gap for others we
[2:16:24] know that destruction is at hand you
[2:16:27] you've already revealed god that
[2:16:28] destruction is at hand and
[2:16:30] people are lingering in sodom
[2:16:32] lingering with the things aside i'm
[2:16:34] still struggling with the world
[2:16:40] sisters that can't overcome pain and
[2:16:42] polish and
[2:16:43] god just struggling in those areas
[2:16:45] father these are things that it's about
[2:16:47] pleasing you it's not about pleasing a
[2:16:49] man it's about pleasing you god
[2:16:53] that's not what you want of your bride
[2:16:55] that's not what you're looking for
[2:16:58] one that's untouched by the things of
[2:16:59] the world as virgin to the things of the
[2:17:02] world that's what you want god
[2:17:05] brothers struggling father in the way
[2:17:06] that they dress and where they present
[2:17:08] themselves and god and lustful thoughts
[2:17:11] god you need people free from that
[2:17:13] [Music]
[2:17:16] father uh abraham just prayed he said
[2:17:18] god let me just
[2:17:21] just one more request what if what if
[2:17:23] there's just ten
[2:17:24] would you destroy the whole city if you
[2:17:26] find 10 righteous people
[2:17:28] what
[2:17:29] abraham was really praying for was lot
[2:17:31] this family he never accident
[2:17:33] specifically
[2:17:35] but when you went down to sodom lord you
[2:17:38] you gave him a promise that i won't
[2:17:40] destroy if i find 10 you couldn't find
[2:17:42] 10
[2:17:44] so you destroyed
[2:17:46] but in the midst of it
[2:17:48] it brought out
[2:17:50] abraham's family
[2:17:52] [Music]
[2:17:53] god bring our families out

[2:18:11] takes god isaac was willing to give his
[2:18:13] whole life

[2:18:16] christ

[2:20:21] am a child
[2:20:25] of god
[2:20:27] praise the lord
[2:20:30] amen i actually wanted to sing
[2:20:33] i am a friend of god
[2:20:35] you know
[2:20:36] as our pastor was preaching there's so
[2:20:38] much that he said
[2:20:39] that just makes you think
[2:20:42] you know i got to thinking about
[2:20:44] being a friend of god and what that
[2:20:46] actually meant
[2:20:48] that visitation to abraham was because
[2:20:50] he was a friend of god
[2:20:52] so a statement came out of god's mouth
[2:20:55] shall i hide anything from abraham it
[2:20:59] was because it was his friend
[2:21:01] and this scripture came to my mind so i
[2:21:03] wanted to pull it up and read this
[2:21:05] action john 15 13.
[2:21:08] it says greater love hath no man than
[2:21:10] this that a man lay down his life for
[2:21:12] his friends
[2:21:14] ye are my friends if you do whatsoever i
[2:21:17] command you
[2:21:18] henceforth i call you not servants for a
[2:21:22] servant knoweth not what his lord doeth
[2:21:25] but i have called you friends for all
[2:21:27] things that i have heard of my father
[2:21:29] i have made known unto you
[2:21:32] so as god made known unto abraham his
[2:21:34] friend jesus made known to his disciples
[2:21:37] in this
[2:21:38] day god almighty held a book in his hand
[2:21:41] it was a sealed book
[2:21:43] the lamb opened the book brought it down
[2:21:45] to a seventh angel
[2:21:47] that seventh angel came before the
[2:21:49] pulpit
[2:21:50] said good morning friends
[2:21:53] and made known an open seventh seal book
[2:21:55] to us no longer seven seals but an open
[2:21:58] book
[2:21:59] we know all the mysteries of god
[2:22:02] because of his grace and his friendship
[2:22:04] and our friendship to him
[2:22:06] if you love him keep his commandments
[2:22:08] you are his friends so let's sing that
[2:22:10] little song together with a with a
[2:22:13] little revelation we are the friends of
