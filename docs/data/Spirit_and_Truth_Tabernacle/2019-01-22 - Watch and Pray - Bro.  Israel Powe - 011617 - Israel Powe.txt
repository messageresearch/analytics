Jesus we love you tonight thank you Lord for the Holy Spirit thank you for your word thank you for your people God where you bless them tonight in a very special way we ask in Jesus name Amen you may be seated just for a moment well I'm so happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight with you Saints here I know Wednesday is a work day from any and so it really you know it pulls out the real Christians the ones that are willing to make that sacrifice not that the others that didn't come are not Christians I don't mean it that way but you got a really dig deep to make it to church on a Wednesday night and and I know what that is you work all day and then we got to get home and get cleaned up and try to be here and for what purpose you know he's worthy to be praised even when I'm tired even when I'm not all the way focused he's still worthy to be praised and when you have the sign out there that says you're gonna be here at 7:30 that's just not to the pastor that's like we all gonna be here at 7:30 us that's what that means that means what church you go to spirit of truth when you guys have service well we have service Sunday morning Sunday night I believe then Wednesday night and so I was on the airplane one time with the gentleman and we were talking and we're talking about things in church he was an old Methodist and I asked him if they still watch the Saints feet he said well no I said well we still do he's oh really oh okay he says um what about your church service oh we have service on Sunday morning Sunday night Wednesday said you go to church on Wednesday I said yes he said you must be a preacher I said I said well that's a matter of fact I am but you know if there's only preachers that come to church I mean when have nobody to preach to before I was preaching I made it to the house of the Lord Wednesday night amen and I thank God for you Saints that made the effort to come and I trust the Lord will bless you very richly I it's not a work day for me so I can sleep in tomorrow and so but I'll try and have a little mercy on you folks and I try to get right into the word and out of the way my son Levi had a event with his music and school and so forth that allowed him to be in Miami this week and it pays for him and his cello and then one parent so I was able to go with him come with him on this trip and to me this is the whole purpose of them buying the ticket for him was for me to be in the house of the Lord here here in spirit and truth Tabernacle I counted a man where's Laura a man because everything else will fail and everything has the beginning and the end but the word of the Lord will endure all the way to the end and all of our events in our school and our friends and our appointments all our planners everything you write in them will all dissipate one day it'll mean nothing one day but what you did for Christ that's the only thing that will last amen so we believe that with all our heart you know it's it's a prayer meeting is it's a powerful meeting it really it really is one of the more powerful services that you can be a part of it takes a lot of effort and my preaching right now all right a prayer meeting is one of the most powerful services you can be a part of because it requires a lot of you it's not easy to pray it just doesn't come you know how many like to hear a choir sing wonderful how many like to hear good preaching always have you like to hear a good Bible story told absolutely how many like to just get up and just pray you see your flesh does not want to do that you were right by not saying Amen god bless you you're telling the truth because to get into the spirit of prayer we see the devil robs us from that time with the Lord you come into a house of the Lord for a prayer meeting and then you sit there and your Bible open you start making it a time to read your Bible and that's great that's fine but that's not what we came here for it's for a prayer meeting I could sit down and watch other folks it's the closer to be in prayer to really you know let the flesh man just move him out of the way and go into the realm of prayer and let the Holy Spirit bring you up and lead you in prayer where he wants you to pray you have things that you want but then God has things that the spirit wants and you don't know what the spirit I don't know what the spirit wants me to pray for but if I get into the spirit of prayer glory he'll lead me to pray for sister to pray for brother to pray for pastor to pray for the needs of the church but see when we come just to be entertained which many of the churches have gone that way of entertainment then we lose the real power of a prayer meeting now I trust that that we would open our eyes to the hour that we live in now I want to take a scripture here god bless you so much and as we're happy to be here and leave us here with me we'll go right into the word and I'll take a couple scriptures brother Wesco always nice to see him it's just your Wesco very very fine people Christians and my my very good friends and I appreciate them and rapturing Faith Tabernacle I see some of the Saints here god bless each of you - hey man if you're just a little tired in your body didn't just ask the Lord to help you and strengthen you so you don't miss what the word what the word wants to deposit in your spirit and you come to church sometime have you ever been tired in church and sleepy in church yes it gets on you but then you can rebuke that spirit and ask Lord to help you so you can receive from the Lord what you have need up Thank You Man so let's go right into the word we'll take the scripture over in there's a number of scriptures we can go to but we'll take and leave us in Isaiah part of me it's in part of me excuse me just a moment here there's more Isaiah 52 and the scripture says in verse number one and two awake awake put on thy strength o tsiyon but on thy beautiful garments Oh Jerusalem the holy city from henceforth there shall no more come into the the uncircumcised and the unclean shake thyself from the dust arise and sit down or Jerusalem loose thyself from the bands of thy neck o captive daughter of Zion but to take one more scripture in revelations chapter 16 and verse number 15 behold I come as a thief blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments lest he walk naked and they see his shame let's let's bow our heads for a word of Prayer we'll stop right there dear Lord Jesus we pray that you'll bless your word and you'll bless your people tonight in a very special way oh god we commit the service into your hands right now in Jesus name Amen I bless you you may be seated now the the word of the Lord is the only thing that will prepare you for the great oncoming judgments that have been prophesied to come it also will prepare you for all the blessings that are of the role for you to come that's his word we are the type of people that hear the word and then we prepare we don't wait until disaster comes and then we try to get it together but the listening they're people the people that have wisdom the people that are called of God they actually study the word and they find where they're living at and then they can prepare for the hour that they're living now in the Book of Revelations when the angel came to John to reveal to him what what things must shortly come to pass the angel begin to show John all these things he sees shows him a woman that had a cup Mystery Babylon written over her head and she had a golden cup in her hand and her filthiness that she was abomination that she was giving out to the nation's and all of the scriptures and all throughout the book of Revelation I think it's four or five times our Lord Jesus says behold I come quickly that's what he says he didn't lie he told us he comes quickly and the prophet of God tells us that that if the people if the bride if the believers knew that they had seven long church ages to go there I'll never reveal to them those love long ages but he did tell them to watch and pray and to be ready and so that preparation the Lord gives us through prophecy through the word through the anointed word that God brings to his people it prepares our hearts like nothing else will you know it's not our smarts it's not our high IQ it's not any of those things it's it's called wisdom there's five wise and then five foolish virgins and the difference between wisdom and being smart smart is quick quick witted may be a high IQ but that's not what we're talking about wisdom is what when you have experience and when you know you have knowledge of something that's wisdom you know how many smart people were in the days of Noah but look at the dumb sheep in the mule DOE and the giraffe they all got in the ark how that happen that wasn't that smart they didn't have the intellect of a man but see your smarts is not where it's at you know I've taken many texts and I've preached many times I don't remember everything I preached I don't remember everything I preached and I know that people listening to me don't remember everything that I preached that's not what it's about it's about your spirit man catching word so that it can produce a faith for a rapture it's not your intellect of course we take notes of course we we'd read but our first man the Holy Spirit leads us to feed on the word by our first man which is a spirit man now the prophet of God says this here and I want to read this for you here he says this in the message the seventh seal he says if you want something to happen now you have to take my word for this if I'm planning on doing something I know better than to tell anybody about it not that the person would tell it but Satan will hear it he can't get it in my heart there as long as God has got it closed up with the Holy Spirit so that's between me and God see he don't know nothing about it until you speak it then he hears it and I've tried I tell people I'll do a certain certain thing and watch the devil cut off every will he can to get there see to beat me to it but if I get the revelation from God and just don't say nothing about it then it's different now can you keep a secret can you we like to talk all the time everything we know we talk and Satan catches that but can you keep a secret let me ask you a question well what is God revealed to you to you personally that you're keeping it in your heart waiting for it to come to pass you know you know you don't have to vindicate yourself by telling everybody what God spoke to you but if he spoke to you just hold it in your heart and then wait for it to come to pass confess it and believe that it's gonna happen just exactly like he said it was going to happen but many times we talk and we talk too much but the revelation comes from God and it's not by our with our knowledge but it's by wisdom the prophet of God continues in this message God has a provided way and he says this here we send our children away to Bible schools in college and we learn them the Bible what good does it do to know the Bible if you don't know the author the Bible doesn't say to know the word Satan knows the word better than any student in the world put that together there look at that Satan knows the word better than any student in the world so thinner it's not knowing the word is it it's not our intellect is it it starts there but it's got to go deeper than just there Amen yeah pick up your Bible you need to read the word you need to pray in the spirit and let the word drop that revelation down in your heart let's go a little bit deeper about this being Satan brother Branham says and Satan hates any book in the Bible it's revelations he talks about how Satan hates the Book of Revelations in the book of Genesis he hates those two books because they reveal here what the prophet of God says here in the message Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he says he's here in Charlotte right now talking about God he's omniscient omnipresent omnipotent infinite he's everywhere all the time everyplace Satan can't be that for God's the only one who's I'm nipa tent on mission and omnipresent proffer God continues in the message what does it take to make a Christian life and he says this here only God can create Satan cannot create he can only pervert what has been created there's only one I'm omnipresent Satan cannot be omnipresent God alone is omnipresent omnipotent infinite so here the Prophet God shirring us with these two quotes here that Satan can't be everywhere he's not he's not all-knowing he's not all-powerful but he knows the word better than everybody else he knows the word but he can't receive revelation revelation is exclusive to a believer and this is why in the scripture it tells us to watch and pray it's only the believers that's going to be ready for the coming of the Lord you know they got you're all worried on the news it's the worldly people that are worried because they don't know what's going on but we are well informed know what's going on how many know it's gonna get worse and it'll never get better is not gonna get better our schools worse our politics worse the churches the young people is gonna get worse cuz that's what the prophecy said so when I see worse happening I know God's fulfilling his word what does it do I look up my Redemption draws nigh his coming is upon us he's coming back for me he said he was you keep your mind in the news you'll be arguing at the radio yelling at this TV screen mad at FoxNews mad at the president mad after the Republicans mad at the Democrats they're doing exactly what the worst said they was going to do praise the Lord but we have a higher calling something is moving us greater and higher we have things that are speaking to us and we know what the end is going to be present Lord it's prophecy this United States for example 1956 January prophet comes back from overseas and he prophesies and says that he believes that this would be the year that America will either accept or reject the gospel before I read that let me read something for you hear what he says about our choices that we make he says that when will you make a decision and by faith Moses he says and it may be this morning that there will be men and women set in here that will make your final choice you are today what you are because several years ago you chose to be what you are now will determine what you'll be five years from five years from today you may be a missionary five years from today you may be a renowned Christian I'm five years from today you may be in hell because you made the wrong decision five years from today you may be cleaning spittoons in the bar room five years from today you may be a prostitute on the street or you may be a man or woman that's a credit to any society because of your choice for Christ five years from today you may be in glory gone in the rapture because you made your choice today but you've got to choose and don't look at what you see choose what you see by faith now our decisions today will affect us five years from today and where you are today is because a decision that you made five years ago and here a vindicated prophet of God stood publicly and made this statement here he wasn't even in his tabernacle this is condemnation by representation he was in Lane Tech High School in Chicago when he first gave that prophecy 1956 here it is four years later and he says this here and now let me bring something else I haven't I haven't got written here but on magnetic tape and this is taped to 1956 in Chicago Illinois standing at the lane Tech High School they were there we're there I said this year is going to be the changing point of America I just come from overseas I don't know why I come I come back council my meetings in Africa and around I come back Billy Graham something mysterious he cancelled his Tommy Osborne Council his and we all crossing the United States in meetings I said America will either receive or reject Christ this year then I said when they elected in Indiana 22 year old boy to be a judge the Spirit of the Lord came on me and I said they'll finally have a president that'll be one of these crew-cut playboy beatnik type presidents a ladies man now them is predictions years ago see where we're at now here he is four years later 1960 he's reformed back to something he said back in 1956 of a prophecy concerning America revelations chapter 13 all right here he goes a little bit further two years later 1962 a testimony on the see the prophet of God says this here God willing I'm giving a try now of evangelism we know the revivals over everyone knows that I predicted that back in 56 when it would start ending Billy Graham comeback Tommy Osborne in them I said this is it America will receive it or reject it this year and they rejected it we're nothing waiting but judgment now you marked that down and see if brother branham's right or not that's thus saith the Lord we're headed for it and we're going to pay for what we've done we got too much glamour in the church in Hollywood and everything else got sick and tired of it the last one will come in after a while and that'll be it 1962 you know what the largest church in America is Pastor Joel Osteen you know how many people tuned into him weekly 7 million people you know how many congregation members come to his church weekly 52,000 people go to hear him preach do you think he's gonna preach on homosexuality this evening is gonna preach on the baptism of the holy ghost whose new thing he's gonna preach on marriage and divorce and adultery and lust no it's lollipop preaching it's popcorn it's candy it's pizza it's entertainment it's fun let's go to church and have fun but when your soul needs to be saved who wants to have fun when your soul is on the line you'll need somebody that I tell you the truth even when it's uncomfortable even when they get up and leave even when they get mad you gotta stay with the word because the word of the Lord is the only thing that will change you from what you are to what you need to be that's the largest church in America we love it here in 1956 the Prophet gives the prophecy 1962 he says we did reject now what's interesting 1961 the prophet of god takes a message jessabelle religion you that take notes take a note go home and listen you know why because when he takes the message spoken word is the original seed I'll read it for you if I got time part of it he says in the spoken word is the original seed he said he got the people all to a place so where I'm gonna lead them to I got them hanging on the limb now I brought prophesies of Sodom of a place where Willie Graham was place to Oral Roberts was places many what am I gonna do and he says the spirit told him to pick up the pen and he begin to write and when he got through writing he went back and looked at what he wrote and when you read what he wrote we ready for the Saints for I watch night service and when you read what he wrote what the Spirit told him to write one of the the spirit refers to is the message chess about religion yes yes jessabelle religion now when Jesus said watch who is he talking to when the Prophet said mark my word oh is he talking to well if he ain't talking to you he's talking to me yes watch watch for what I'm not smart enough to know Bible prophecy but I can get wisdom what is wisdom the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom oh you gotta serve the Lord he'll give you wisdom I'm not talking about your IQ I'm not talking about your smarts I don't care if you can pass a SAT test but can you receive the Holy Ghost though you fear the Lord have you committed him as your all-in-all that's wisdom right that's glory let's go a little bit further 1962 he says that will start it would start the ending okay so now let me read something for you here in the message marriage and divorce here's what the prophet of God says paragraph 239 he says that's what he said to Adam before sex was ever induced or introduced multiplied to replenish the earth when he was yet in the beginning when he was yet both male and female in himself there shows then that the bride has got to come from the word by spiritual multiplication multiplication see replenishing the earth so here the Prophet is referring to Genesis 1:26 the first man that he created was both male and female made in the image of God is that right he was a spirit man and the prophet of God says I think if you got the CLD book the first question he deals with that how a man when God formed him he was like a tree and his toes were like what's growing in the ground but before he was in the image so before he can be in that form to till the soil he was a spirit man both male and female and their name was Adam Cain say Amen it was in that form that Adams spoke that he had the ability to speak multiple multiplication of the word replenish the land and it was in that form that's his original form that is man's original you it's not what you see with your eyes it's what you're led by by the Spirit because the sons and daughters of God they're not the smartest faithful but they are led by the Spirit of God and that's all I want I want to be led don't go there stay back here do it like this I want to be led by the Spirit of God that's the real you that's the real me is when I left the Holy Spirit lead me not on call oh man the devil got his food always in the mirror trying to be cute always trying to change the outside man that's gonna burn keep living is gonna get a wrinkle keep living is gonna dry up hey lemon it's over krei that's not you but your spirit man was the original man and he led the animal kingdom like the Holy Spirit leads to believer today that's what he said he said that spirit man that spirit being led the animal kingdom like the Holy Spirit leads the believer today that's a low in the image of God see this is 1:26 then in Genesis chapter 2 then a forms man and he stands up and he looks like an earthly man and then from there Adam names and then from there God takes from his side a type of Christ is that right so where do we begin it's like a little baby no baby no who is mama and daddy is is that right he can't even talk but you try to hold him like who is who it ain't his knowledge he can't even talk but he know his spirit knows that you ain't my mama and you ain't my daddy take your hands off of me see that's in him and a believer with this make decisions that look crazy sometime people to understand it are you gonna give up that job they don't understand it what do you like here for they don't understand it why you going to church on a Wednesday night because we are led by the Spirit of God Laurie I'll take that over anything hey man that's what we come in contact with when we receive the Holy Ghost where our spiritual man is awakened and now we got the power to live right and when the word comes forth our spirit man is growing feeding on the word faith is growing for a rapture there's the Lord amen amen so let's go a little bit further here this America rejected and the prophet of God said five years so in 1961 this country elected his first Catholic president with his name j FK there i some of young people didn't know that hi he was a nice man handsome I mean I take a picture look nice next to his wife Jacqueline but you see what was he he was Catholic you see the there are many Christian people voted for him because their eyes wasn't open to spiritual things but when you listen to the message this is right after he was elected jessabelle religion he's not at the tabernacle but he blasts what this nation just did but look this is 1961 he was elected the first Catholic president and the Prophet blessed him but five years prior we already rejected 56 57 58 59 60 61 five years later we get this a man on the throne brother man who said that Israel was a type that America was the type of Israel that we came over here for religious freedom revelations 13 said there was a beast that come up out of the earth two horns like the American Buffalo and he had cervical civil and ecclesiastical power and we came here for a religious freedom that was the forefathers of this nation now we didn't preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost we didn't have everything right but we came over here for a religious freedom you know we had slaves we did the American they did the American Indian wrong and and all kind of things were contrary but but still the prayer that they would have come to the baptism of the Holy Ghost because civilization travels from the east to the west and that's the way the gospel travels and that's where the Sun rises from the east to the west and that light would have finally come to our nation and to the churches which it did I didn't have their laws together but they had enough to know that they didn't want to be a part of a harlot anymore or the so they came over here for freedom of religion and then 1960 while we elect our first Catholic president and we are done so you want me to go get out get out the vote sign to a nation that's already done you want me to stand up to somebody's life matters who you want me to get a t-shirt is that where we're at right now I'm getting all whose life matters the only life that matters is the life of Christ and if you want to receive the Holy Ghost that's what matters if you want to get saved that's what matters the blood of Jesus Christ Calvary that's what matters it'll make the difference in your life I'm not gonna get out the vote get out the vote for what for who huh and if you listen to them the media and have your mind oh we got to stop this arm extreme Islamic terrorism the Muslims bother me the Quran II mean nothing to me what they doing out there that's never been God's enemy but the people that kill Jesus had one of these in their hand they had the law of Moses they were actually related to Moses by the law sons of Aaron it wasn't Pilate he let his part yes when he trying to get rid of it it was the chief priests it was why it was um um the citerior not the cetera it was the chief priests the Pharisees and the Sadducees they all got together to put Jesus to death how do we know that because we're smart but we have wisdom how do we know it we have wisdom can I go a little bit further all right here let's hear what the prophet of God says here I think the highest IQ is to read it somewhere 230 it's one of the highest IQs the average IQ of a normal man is 90 to 110 that's how they score the ER you know a cognitive abilities depending on your age and give you a test see

smart look at my wisdom all your way to hell if you're not born again don't let the devil fool you Hollywood is on this way to hell it's the seed of Satan the prophet of God said so I don't get my cue from my Hollywood from the movies know our identity is in his word looking as pretty as you can on their way to hell as healthy as they ever been on their way to hell you see what really matters you see what matters not very few people pulpits gonna preach it like that this is not for the Internet this is not for the world it's but it's for the bride she hears that word as she comes out amen let me read something for you here I don't want to hold you too much longer but we'll take in this message the I believe it's the mark of the beast yes mark of the beast' 1954 May 13th he's has this here this United States will come to a time that the church and state will unite together Protestant and Catholic will throw their things together to fight communism and it in its exactly playing in the hands of what God said right here and you Protestants laying yonder sound asleep reading a love story magazine instead of your Bible out guiding around somewhere to some kind of a party instead of a prayer meeting somewhere fussing at one another about little old petty things that don't matter that much you ought to be on your knees somewhere if you know what eternity meant he continues on the same message mark of the beast' 1954 same message straight down paragraph 249 he says it said the whole world Protestant in all wondered all except those whose name was written in that book why were the names written they are Abraham's seed and our heirs according to the promise elected before the foundation of the world that's why they don't wonder notice here now what's what he said what's these in the Lamb's Book of Life here is the mind that has wisdom now I want to ask you something is wisdom one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit congregation says Amen is that right how many believes that the Bible first Corinthians twelve teaches that the gifts and all in the church is wisdom let's see one of the gifts a man well how could you say there is no speaking in tongues then how do you say there is no interpretation of tongue how could you say there's no divine healing for the same body if I'm a body got a hand on the this side and hand on that side and a foot there how can you say that the hand is not the foot didn't you hear what Paul said now watch he is speaking in the last days directly to the body said here is to the one that has wisdom oh I like this oh my here is what will shock you listen to this all right here is the mind that has wisdom if the Holy Spirit gifts didn't come down to all the age why did he speak this for the last days then if there's going to be no gifts in the church in the last days why did he direct this to the last days then here is to the one that has wisdom the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sitteth how many hills how many cities in the world he continues on paragraph 253 that the church sits on seven hills only one where is that the Vatican City Rome that's right the Bible said that this horrible war that made all the world commit fornication brought out a bunch of little daughters to teaching them about the same thing said they wasn't as bad as her but they were harlots taught them the same thing said the beginning of it will be a woman or church sitting on seven hills and Rome I looked over the world tell me where it's at a church sitting on Seven Hills now the Prophet said that it was calling to the last day people this prophecy of wisdom here's to him that has wisdom is wisdom important can you pray for it and have it is this scriptural to ask for God to give you wisdom you young people you think a little wisdom will help you a married man you think wisdom will help you in your home you walk upon the job if people setting traps all around you think wisdom will help you you go into a classroom you got an exam you got things you have to do you think a little wisdom will help you you're traveling you're going here and there you got people after you got the devil's after you do you think wisdom will help you here's to the mind that has wisdom one of the gifts of the Spirit one of the things that's necessary for the believer in this age and this hour as I prepare to close the the scripture tells us of wisdom I'll just read a couple places for you here if I can find it quickly Psalms 111 10 says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom a good understanding have all day that do His commandments his praise endure forever proverbs 1:7 the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction proverbs 9 9 and 10 give instruction to a wise man and he will be yet wiser teacher just men and he will increase in learning the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the holy is understanding proverbs 5 proverbs 4 5 through 7 get wisdom get understanding forget it not neither decline from the words of my mouth forsake her not and she shall preserve thee love her and she shall keep thee wisdom is the principal thing therefore give wisdom and with all thy getting get understanding you see brothers and sisters Satan knows the word but it's the word is not revealed to him you see the difference but the children of God have wisdom and the the wisdom is the principal thing now as I prepare to close just so you know when I got up here I was preparing the clothes all right so you got a watch how I said wisdom you would have caught that as I prepare to close everybody a smiling but it's all right I've been there I've been there that's discouraging when he was planning to get off in a few minutes god bless you as I prepare to close I'm so happy to be here god bless you our justice will help you the word of the Lord will help you and this message pick up in this message the spoken word is the original seed I'm just going to read the first part and when you get a chance you go home and you listen to that or read it and we'll bring you to where we where you need to be it's a warning it's a prophecy it's not for the world it's for you it's for me and then you get a chance to go to the message services just the time six dreams by pastors all right I'll preach it now right I've been here before everything the Holy Spirit was here before service is just a time six dreams then capped off by a vision and when he opens up his vial is as Romans chapter 9 where they stumbled at the stumbling stone they still stumbling at the stumbling-stone all right I almost stumbles at that altar right here god bless you y'all pray for me I'm alright but in this message the spoken word is the original seed I'm just gonna read one two three four paragraphs and then this was set up when you get a chance to hear this other part he says here paragraph three one zero he says now that's what we got all these things that we got now all things all these things I've said if they don't jive with the Bible or dovetail what God's Word they're wrong they're wrong all this picture now I'm just going to hurry over some of this not explain it but just hurry over it so you can get to it and I promise you as quick as I possibly can I got a place here where I got so in the spirit I got the church up to show it and proved in the word here exactly what happened all along and then when it did I thought Lord I got the people standing here now I'll have them standing there what can I tell them I can't predict the future I can't tell them what to do or what will I do I'll leave them standing on a limb I raised up my hand I said God I think I'm doing this by your will I've never did this never did before because the seed hadn't been sold yet I said now I've got I believe it's time for me to say it but now what am I going to say now and just as plain as you hear my voice something said pick up your pen I'll read it to you in a minute and when I got through there it was just the answer I didn't even know what what I was writing just started writing and when I got through I laid the pen down I looked I thought God have mercy there it is right there that's what I'm looking for now there are some things I had to bypass we'll get to it in a little bit the Lord willing so there's a long amount of space he explains a few things in him he picks up and for one for through paragraph four it gets 447 look for one for the paragraph four for one and you get a chance you read that you people that want to be made ready you that want to receive the warning of the Holy Spirit take I'm not gonna read it for you I want you to read it I want you to listen to it you go find the message spoken word is the original seed he listen to what the Spirit told him when he picked up the pen and he wrote and he didn't even know he was writing and then one of the things in there was Jezebel religion showed us where we are America has rejected the word and that was a brief touch on America through the Bible America in the word what has happened where we are today you take Romans chapter 1 and you read straight down that God has given them over let's close with that scripture all right let's close with that one it seems hard sometimes the stuff we have to say and the reason it seems so hard is that everything has become so watered-down that the true word of the Lord it really sounds hard but that's what you need you need truth and I believe in positive I believe in keeping your thoughts positive I believe in looking up and I believe in self-help and doing things to better yourself but if you're trying to better yourself without the cross without the blood without repenting it's not gonna work you're just gonna swap one thing for another thing if it don't require repentance which means to turn around from what you're doing and then the blood of Jesus Christ to atone for what you did and then the Holy Spirit to give you the power not like the Superman not like a superhero but its power that you surrender to and you surrender to that power it gives you the grace to live a godly life you're tested you're tempting you say Lord Jesus help me I'm weak right now and it gives you the power and you overcome that's the Holy Ghost power that's the power we live by power to overcome and I revel in Romans chapter 1 on our read here says this here I'm going to start verse number 18 for the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness because that which may be known of God is manifest in them for God had showed it unto them for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and Godhead so that they are without excuse because that when they knew God they glorified him not as God neither we're thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise they become fools change the glory of the uncorruptible God into the image made like to corruptible man to birds four-footed beasts and creeping things were for God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts to dishonour their own bodies between themselves who changed the truth of God into a lie worship and serve the creature more than the Creator who is blessed forever amen for this cause God gave them up who gave them up God gave them up unto vile affections for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in the lust one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves the recompense of their error which was meet and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness viciousness maliciousness full of envy murder debate deceit malignity whisperers backbiters haters of god despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to parents without understanding covenantbreakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful who knowing the judgment of God that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them now when God has given them up and their mind is reprobate and they have gone into vile affection the scripture says they're worthy of what dad that's not cool to say that it's not it's not comfortable to say that but that's the truth you know the the that we we win our little church their release it from the school department they're a man that we lease it from his name was Richard and you had a little spirit on him and I ain't seen him for a few months a few months I went back to go pay the lease every time I pay it he wasn't there and I noticed the name change from being called Richard to Ricky our Akki like what and then hurt I thought I heard one delicious we'll leave it on her desk like on her desk well this person she went through this change and when we signed a contract it was a man I went to go pay the leases the first time I saw them or hurt him or what in several months and it's he's now a woman now yeah right before my right before your eyes you see that and not a very pretty woman either I'm sure I just had to say that excuse me really what's ugly is the attitude in the spirit but then when I dropped to check off and I shook hands at the hands of a man now you tell me that that's not disgraceful you tell me that's not disgusting but the devil will make you think that you're hateful when you preach against such things because all of the media and all the news have a gospel that they want to hear the only thing that's going to save you is when you hear the truth an evil spirit can't have no power until context don't whine evil spirit comes in contact and you get you know you see a naked woman walk by then you're dealing with your bodily now you stay in the presence of the word then you got faith the anointing comes it strengthens the spiritual man you get out of the presence of the word you're a man you're a woman you'll get influenced you listen to talk radio all the time listen it out all the time you get influenced and then you start picking up attitude towards people the only answer is the gospel it's the word of the Lord it's the mouthpiece of God that coming this day that's the only act that's what we stand for that's the blood that's the cross that's salvation that's what we preach the Word of Life that's the only place that there is life man don't let the news fool you don't let the media get you caught up don't get influenced by the things of the world we staying in the word you know those movies you see them another guy take a gun and shoot somebody's brains out and you say well brother it's just a movie well why are you crying then in the movie why is your heart pumping why did you get scared it's just a movie just prepare your mind for something and the movie and those spirits come from somewhere the inspiration comes from somewhere you're constantly on the Facebook and on the face and on you know the movies and things and the videos you could just catch up you know just catch up your time it used to be the TV we just go off remember that remember it no more shows on is like static okay I think it's time to go to bed now yes that's what time it is it's time to go to bed and no more TV it's off when's the internet gonna go off it doesn't go on here's why you go to sleep looking at it going pushing into it but you know what sons of God sons and daughters of God we come in contact with the Holy Spirit our spiritual man feeds on the word there's a quote I have it here I didn't read it but in perfect faith the prophet of God says this he says you become the word as you receive the word we think about that you become the word as you receive the word no mrs. perfect faith so you receive the word you become in the word we bypass our that theophany to come here to be tested this is just a test Jesus didn't bypass his but we're being tested by the word will we stand will we overcome can we make it yes we can make it so we're brothers I got to get up early tomorrow morning at work at 7:00 oh wow look at the believers
