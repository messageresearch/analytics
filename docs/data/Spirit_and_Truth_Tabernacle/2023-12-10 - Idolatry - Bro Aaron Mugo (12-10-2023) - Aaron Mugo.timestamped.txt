[45:44] in spirit and Truth am
[45:47] um our uh our little Ministry trip that
[45:52] we just had went really well in beckway
[45:55] it's good to be home good to see
[45:57] everybody around here and I know we're
[45:59] going to our second home over there in
[46:01] Indiana going to have a safe trip back
[46:03] but Lord willing
[46:06] um and uh it's just great to see you
[46:09] guys uh I want
[46:12] to uh let's just go to our Bibles
[46:15] actually it's going to be in habach I'm
[46:17] going to give you some extra time to
[46:18] find that this morning because without
[46:21] the you know I'm I'm kind of used to
[46:23] using a digital Bible these days and uh
[46:27] it makes you kind of lazy as you can see
[46:29] my physical one is right behind me I
[46:31] don't even I haven't even looked at it
[46:33] but
[46:34] um it's great to see how God just uses
[46:37] technology to help him out you know um
[46:41] don't want to condemn that at
[46:43] all uh so it's habac chap 2 verse 19 and
[46:50] 20 uh goes like
[46:52] this woe unto him that saith to the wood
[46:55] a awake to the dumb Stone arise it shall
[46:58] teach behold it is laid over with gold
[47:01] and silver and there is no breath at all
[47:04] in the midst of it verse 20 says but the
[47:07] Lord is in his holy Temple that all the
[47:09] Earth keep silence before him you can
[47:12] have your
[47:17] seats so uh I was I was honestly
[47:20] struggling to figure out what to speak
[47:22] uh this morning because I've spoken on
[47:24] this topic a few times over the last
[47:26] couple months and
[47:29] uh and I was thinking surely God you
[47:31] wouldn't have me just preach the same
[47:33] thing over and over again but apparently
[47:35] yeah so we're just going to follow his
[47:37] will this morning uh my topic is called
[47:40] idolatry and
[47:42] uh I just want to take us through the
[47:44] scriptures on that thought it's uh it
[47:48] the first time I studied it I thought it
[47:49] was just like something to be in my
[47:51] notes that just to refer to later but
[47:53] then after I started getting into it I
[47:55] realized there's a lot in there in the
[47:58] Bible that can feed people it's not just
[48:00] for the minister to sit back and hold it
[48:02] in his notes for reference but it can
[48:05] actually feed people so that's what I
[48:07] want to do this morning that's what
[48:08] we're in the business of doing so uh the
[48:11] the longer I study the more the lord
[48:13] gave me on this and uh I like when he
[48:16] does that and I I decided I'm just going
[48:19] to dial it back all the way back to the
[48:21] very beginning uh before there was even
[48:23] time and then let's look at where
[48:25] idolatry first appeared amen just follow
[48:28] with me here all right we're going to go
[48:30] to Isaiah 14 how art thou fallen from
[48:33] Heaven A Lucifer son of the morning how
[48:36] art thou cut down to the ground which is
[48:38] weaken the Nations for thou H has said
[48:40] in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven
[48:43] I will and these are key words here I
[48:45] will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my
[48:47] throne above the stars of God I will sit
[48:51] also upon the Mount of the congregation
[48:53] in the sides of the north I will Ascend
[48:56] above the heights of the clouds I will
[48:57] be like the most high so if you've read
[49:00] the if you've heard uh the message at
[49:03] all you hear Brother brandham talking
[49:04] about idolatry he says it's anything
[49:06] that gets between you an idol is
[49:08] anything that gets between you and God
[49:10] so we're going to follow that metric
[49:12] going through the Bible now when the
[49:14] devil decided to elevate himself to the
[49:17] point where he was thinking he's like
[49:19] God he wanted to be worshiped like him
[49:22] and you got to you got to recognize God
[49:24] did make the devil perfect
[49:26] he made him perfect and and and there's
[49:28] actually scripture that says he was made
[49:29] perfect but sin was found in him now I
[49:33] want you to think back and think about
[49:34] the I didn't have a picture of it in my
[49:36] in my slides but the stature of a
[49:38] perfect man the way it's built is like
[49:40] you know you have your faith virtue blah
[49:42] blah blah blah blah and then you get
[49:43] towards the top and it has godliness
[49:46] right up there right now the devil he
[49:49] took godliness and then since sin was
[49:52] found in his heart that godliness is
[49:54] something that we should all have right
[49:56] we want to be like God but then he took
[49:58] that and allowed it to be perverted and
[50:00] he took it and it became Pride instead
[50:03] of godliness and since it was Pride
[50:05] instead of godliness that's where it
[50:07] turned South now whenever it got to that
[50:09] point the de see the devil was made
[50:12] perfect right that's what the Bible says
[50:14] and god is perfect so the other angels
[50:17] are looking at the Devil and they're
[50:18] looking at God and they see Perfection
[50:20] and they see Perfection but this is
[50:22] perfection with one flaw and that one
[50:25] flaw the Angels completely got deceived
[50:28] and started to worship the devil instead
[50:31] of God right there that became their
[50:34] Idol right
[50:35] there so if you follow through the
[50:37] scripture uh let's go to uh uh this
[50:41] quote brother Bram said in 1955 the Seal
[50:43] of the Antichrist did you know that in
[50:45] heaven that the devil was God's
[50:47] right-hand man in the beginning that
[50:49] Lucifer the son of the morning was given
[50:52] power and the reason that he brought sin
[50:54] into the world he was able able to take
[50:55] something that God had created and
[50:57] pervert it back to into an evil thing
[50:59] which started all this trouble in the
[51:00] beginning then God back before the
[51:02] foundation of the world was ever laid
[51:04] when he seen what Satan done in his
[51:07] pride went over in the north and set up
[51:09] a kingdom and fought against Michael and
[51:11] his angels do you see it the right-and
[51:14] man of Almighty almighty God was Lucifer
[51:16] the son of the morning the first God
[51:18] granted him almost co-workers with him
[51:21] he was a coworker partly equal with him
[51:23] only Satan could not create God is the
[51:26] only Creator but Satan took something
[51:28] that God created and perverted it back
[51:30] into something else evil so back back
[51:33] when God created the devil he said okay
[51:36] first he's perfect and then he had
[51:38] almost the exact same set of powers and
[51:41] abilities that God had on his side and
[51:43] he trusted him with that now whenever
[51:46] Satan he he gets elevated to that point
[51:48] you got to realize
[51:50] um all Angels were were made perfect
[51:53] they were made already following the
[51:54] word they were made to where they
[51:56] already worshiped God and they didn't
[51:58] have to come back from a a downtrodden
[52:00] condition like we are here on Earth
[52:02] right and yet God he did whenever he
[52:05] created angels He did not issue a
[52:08] proclamation over them the way he issued
[52:10] a proclamation over us right the
[52:12] proclamation over us what does it say it
[52:15] says we will not be deceived because we
[52:18] are already elect we were already part
[52:21] of God from before the foundation of the
[52:22] world and he creates these perfect
[52:24] beings angels
[52:26] and they get deceived something that he
[52:28] created perfectly 2/3 of the Angels
[52:31] actually follow Satan out of heaven when
[52:33] they get cast out because they didn't
[52:35] realize who God was between him and and
[52:38] God made that complete mistake and then
[52:41] they got deceived and we're so blessed
[52:44] this morning God just decided and and I
[52:47] don't know why he decided that cuz I'm
[52:49] already coming from an imperfect State
[52:51] and he decided I'm not going to be
[52:53] deceived you're not going to to be
[52:55] deceived you don't have to worry about
[52:57] what the devil throws at you you don't
[52:58] have to be worried about being deceived
[53:00] because God already said you
[53:03] won't in your already fallen condition
[53:06] he already saw where you were before he
[53:08] created you he saw where you were and
[53:10] he's just referencing back to that and
[53:12] he said this is my child whatever I send
[53:15] forth it will come back to me and it
[53:17] will not be void he's going to be
[53:19] perfect just like what God intended amen
[53:23] amen amen
[53:26] we're going to dial it back to
[53:27] Revelation we're still following the
[53:28] devil I like to follow him through the
[53:30] scripture because he likes to hide you
[53:31] know and I like to expose where where
[53:34] exactly he's
[53:35] at Revelation 123 uh 3 um and there
[53:40] appeared another Wonder in heaven and
[53:41] behold a great red dragon this is where
[53:43] the devil gets cast out a great red
[53:46] dragon having seven heads and 10 horns
[53:48] and seven crowns upon his heads and his
[53:50] tail drew a third part of the stars of
[53:51] heaven and did cast them to the Earth
[53:53] this is the devil and the angels getting
[53:54] cast out of heaven after they follow the
[53:57] devil in Ezekiel um he's not called The
[54:01] Devil in in this uh uh chapter of
[54:04] Ezekiel 28:12 he's not called the devil
[54:07] there it's called the king of Tyrus but
[54:09] it's still referring to the devil it
[54:11] says son of man take up a lamentation
[54:13] upon the king of Tyrus and say unto him
[54:15] thus saith the Lord God thou seest up
[54:17] the th full of wisdom and perfect that's
[54:19] what I was talking about perfect in
[54:21] Beauty thou H has been in Eden the
[54:23] Garden of God every precious stone was I
[54:26] covering all those stones right
[54:28] there and
[54:30] uh I'm just going to cut to the next
[54:32] slide gold the work workmanship of thy
[54:35] tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared
[54:37] for thee in the day that thou was
[54:39] created so way back there he had all
[54:41] those stones as a covering and and he
[54:43] was made perfect by God in job you're
[54:46] going to see that even though the devil
[54:49] got cast out of heaven and he was given
[54:51] those Powers by God even though all of
[54:53] that happened God wasn't scared you
[54:56] realize God didn't take his powers away
[54:59] and be like oh no he's going to deceive
[55:00] people no the devil kept all of his
[55:03] powers he kept all of that status that
[55:06] he had beforeand God wasn't scared he
[55:09] said take two-thirds of my angels leave
[55:10] me with a third and then he he he goes
[55:14] and he takes that power only only only
[55:16] difference is he cannot create right you
[55:18] know right and God wasn't scared amen
[55:21] amen and yet the devil he has the
[55:23] audacity in job we're about to read
[55:25] chapter 1:6 now there was a day he he
[55:28] has the audacity now there was a day
[55:30] when the sons of God came to present
[55:32] themselves before the Lord and Satan
[55:34] came also among them he just walked on
[55:36] in nobody stopped him you say Sons or
[55:39] God are here Satan's here
[55:41] too Satan's here too don't forget he
[55:45] came to church with you this morning
[55:47] amen and the Lord said unto Satan whence
[55:49] comest thou then Satan answered the Lord
[55:52] and said from going to and fro on the
[55:54] earth and from walking up up and down it
[55:55] the
[55:57] audacity God didn't even take his power
[56:00] from him in John 12 now you're I'm just
[56:04] I'm building this up so you can see
[56:05] Satan's status has not diminished John
[56:09] 12:31 now now is the Judgment of this
[56:11] world now shall the prince of this world
[56:12] be capped out so he's been called a king
[56:15] back in e in Ezekiel he was called
[56:17] perfect way back in Isaiah actually in
[56:20] Ezekiel is also called perfect in Isaiah
[56:22] is talking about how he Sealth up the
[56:24] Sun
[56:25] and over here in John it's saying he's a
[56:27] prince so he still has all of this
[56:30] status in Ephesians chapter
[56:33] 2 I think he's called a prince again
[56:35] wherein in time past you walked
[56:37] according to the course of this world
[56:38] according to the prince of the power of
[56:40] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[56:43] the children of Disobedience so his
[56:45] status never diminish Saints and then in
[56:49] Daniel chapter 10 verse 12 and in in
[56:53] it's this is a this is this is a time
[56:55] when Daniel is actually praying to God
[56:57] because he sees something in the
[56:58] scripture and he wants to know when it's
[57:00] going to come to pass so Daniel is just
[57:03] he's reading there and he decides I'm
[57:04] going to pray and ask God exactly when
[57:06] this is happening and you're going to
[57:07] see exactly why it took so long for
[57:10] God's answer to come through said then
[57:13] said this is the Angel who finally came
[57:15] to Daniel and told him hey here's the
[57:17] answer and this is why I'm late he said
[57:19] then said he then said he unto me fear
[57:22] not Daniel for from the first day that
[57:24] thou did set thine heart to understand
[57:26] and to chasten thyself before thy God
[57:28] thy words were heard and I am come for
[57:30] thy words so day one when Daniel Prayed
[57:33] God sent an answer what happened but the
[57:36] prince of the kingdom of Persia
[57:38] withstood me one in 20 days but Lo
[57:41] Michael one of the chief princes came to
[57:42] help me and I remained there with the
[57:45] kings of Persia so he's still being
[57:47] called a prince here and he was able to
[57:49] stop the blessing from getting to Daniel
[57:52] for 21 days what do you think that angel
[57:56] was thinking while he's fighting with
[57:58] the devil for 21 days 21 days it's like
[58:03] God sent me on this path God ever sent
[58:05] you somewhere and you don't know why but
[58:07] everything you try to do is coming up
[58:09] against you right there he tried to tell
[58:12] you to do something and you don't know
[58:13] why it seems like he disappeared but
[58:16] don't worry sometimes help is on the way
[58:18] and you just haven't seen it yet
[58:20] sometimes he has sent his answer and you
[58:22] haven't heard it yet you got to stay in
[58:25] the promise and keep praying believe
[58:27] that he's going to come through believe
[58:29] that he's already sent that answer to
[58:31] you before you even prayed he said
[58:34] before I call before you call I will
[58:36] answer you right let him answer you in
[58:39] his
[58:40] time yes you can see the angels are
[58:42] still fighting the devil to this day
[58:44] still having trouble with
[58:47] him
[58:49] now back I mean the topic is idolatry I
[58:52] want to stay on topic right here so be
[58:54] certain of God
[58:55] 1959 brother brandom says we may not
[58:58] think that we are Idol worshippers but
[59:00] we are and the government endorses it
[59:03] people today are Idol worshippers
[59:05] because they worship idols some of them
[59:07] worship movie stars for Idols some
[59:10] worship money for idols and some worship
[59:13] television stars as Idols but all that
[59:16] you put before God is an idol let it be
[59:19] whatever it may be now I'm not one to
[59:22] change the words of the Prophet but let
[59:24] it be what ever or whoever it may be
[59:27] because he's talking about a lot of live
[59:29] human beings he's saying movie stars
[59:31] he's saying uh television stars it could
[59:34] be anybody it could be someone in church
[59:37] it could be anybody anything that gets
[59:39] between any human or any object or any
[59:42] um intangible object that gets between
[59:45] you and God is your
[59:47] Idol now I know some people these
[59:50] examples he's listing at it's like it
[59:53] actually makes me think of of this this
[59:55] story brother Brandon was talking about
[59:56] I think he was in South Africa and he
[59:58] he's he's doing these campaign meetings
[1:00:00] and a lot of these South Africans I
[1:00:02] don't remember it was a 30,000 or
[1:00:03] something decide to uh they they get
[1:00:06] healed and then they convert to
[1:00:08] Christianity and they start to follow
[1:00:09] because of his ministry so powerful and
[1:00:12] then uh after the meetings have been
[1:00:14] going on for a while he he actually sees
[1:00:17] this young boy his name is Thomas and
[1:00:20] he's walking and he's coming to the
[1:00:22] meeting and Thomas says that he's a
[1:00:24] Christian
[1:00:25] but uh brother brandham sees that he's
[1:00:27] holding an idol in his hand actually
[1:00:28] he's just carrying it along just like
[1:00:30] this just holding an idol like this
[1:00:32] coming to church and he can see that
[1:00:34] it's carved out and he says well he gets
[1:00:35] a translator and he asks him like okay I
[1:00:37] thought you were a Christian Thomas he
[1:00:39] says yeah I'm a Christian and then he
[1:00:40] says well why why why are you carrying
[1:00:42] the idol then what are you doing and
[1:00:44] he's like Thomas says I'm a Christian if
[1:00:47] I pray to God and he doesn't answer me
[1:00:51] I'm going to use this Idol you guys any
[1:00:54] have anything in your lives like that we
[1:00:55] have that all the time it's like when
[1:00:58] God doesn't answer me I'm going to use
[1:00:59] that little Idol over here you know why
[1:01:02] because that's my safety net that's what
[1:01:04] I've been holding on to I knew that
[1:01:06] before I knew God God might have known
[1:01:08] me before the foundation of the world
[1:01:10] but I don't remember him I remember that
[1:01:12] I remember when I was sick I used my um
[1:01:15] my my health insurance plan yeah and you
[1:01:18] know if I pray and God hasn't answered
[1:01:20] me fast enough about being sick I'm just
[1:01:22] going to go to the doctor I'll be fine
[1:01:24] you ever done that before you ever
[1:01:26] thought that before Oh if I crash if my
[1:01:29] car crashes I'm not worried all my bills
[1:01:31] will be paid because I have an insurance
[1:01:33] plan or if I can't afford something and
[1:01:37] God hasn't provided for for me fast
[1:01:39] enough put it on that Visa put it on
[1:01:41] that American Express don't have to
[1:01:44] worry about that because God will my
[1:01:47] little God is going to come through for
[1:01:48] me if he doesn't right we do that all
[1:01:51] the time this is a this is Lea
[1:01:54] everything comes easy to us and we
[1:01:56] expect it to be really fast right that's
[1:02:00] true amen now how do people get into the
[1:02:03] point where where they're where they're
[1:02:05] actually worshiping idols and I I want
[1:02:07] to
[1:02:09] um actually want
[1:02:11] to I want to break that down because if
[1:02:15] you look in the Old Testament you you
[1:02:17] see people who it's like step one
[1:02:19] they're Israelites they're read LED out
[1:02:21] of out of Egypt and then God's doing all
[1:02:23] these wonders in the wilderness they get
[1:02:25] to the promised land they're killing
[1:02:26] people left and right and then they get
[1:02:27] their land and it's like a beautiful
[1:02:29] thing then you know two books later
[1:02:31] everybody's worshiping Idols it's like
[1:02:33] how'd you get there right and then they
[1:02:35] worship idols then they have a good King
[1:02:37] who knocks all the idols down then they
[1:02:38] worship idols again then they do it
[1:02:40] again and that goes on and on and on
[1:02:41] till the end of Malachi right and it's
[1:02:43] like how did they do that how did they
[1:02:45] get to that point good thing we have a
[1:02:47] prophet who broke it down yeah I want to
[1:02:50] jump to slide uh 38 actually in
[1:02:53] presuming
[1:02:55] 1962 says the human soul cries out for
[1:02:58] something it knows that there's
[1:03:00] something that brought it here it knows
[1:03:02] that there is something that's beyond
[1:03:03] here they know that they come from out
[1:03:06] of the night and they go back into the
[1:03:08] night and they want to know where they
[1:03:09] come from and where they're going now if
[1:03:11] that hunger is in there you can never
[1:03:13] get it by blighting your mind you know I
[1:03:16] heard someone was in a meeting here
[1:03:18] sometime ago someone said just let your
[1:03:19] mind go blank now now this this is
[1:03:22] something dangerous I want you to follow
[1:03:24] word for word exactly what I'm saying
[1:03:26] the person he's talking about was in a
[1:03:28] meeting so this morning we're in church
[1:03:31] we're in the right place right and then
[1:03:34] he's saying that someone in the meeting
[1:03:36] said that they were in a church
[1:03:38] environment the words going forth and
[1:03:40] this person blanks out their
[1:03:43] mind just look right straight up towards
[1:03:45] the skies let your mind go blank you'll
[1:03:48] get an experience and no doubt but what
[1:03:50] you do that's right but you get an
[1:03:52] experience but what an experience you
[1:03:55] see when you do that you just open your
[1:03:58] soul to Satan he'll give you something
[1:04:00] that's true what did I just say Satan
[1:04:03] came to every meeting he comes to church
[1:04:05] with you right and if you come in here
[1:04:07] and blank your mind and let whatever
[1:04:09] happened cuz oh I'm looking left and
[1:04:11] right sister Susie got healed I'm
[1:04:12] looking at over brother over there just
[1:04:15] got the Holy Ghost I want a blessing
[1:04:16] from me that's a good thing to have that
[1:04:19] hunger to have God's blessings coming
[1:04:21] down in the service and to see it
[1:04:23] working among the people that's a great
[1:04:25] thing to have but how are you supposed
[1:04:28] to get that that's what we're trying to
[1:04:29] get
[1:04:32] into next next quote Christianity versus
[1:04:36] idolatry he says now idolatry it's still
[1:04:37] today we find I find people coming to
[1:04:39] the Altar and with blind sayings of
[1:04:40] blind teachers that'll say just open up
[1:04:44] forget everything make your mind a blank
[1:04:46] you'll become an Elijah you'll become
[1:04:48] this that or the other what a lie you
[1:04:51] don't come to God that's to open up your
[1:04:53] soul to all kinds of devil Spirits get
[1:04:55] in don't you do that you must remember
[1:04:59] that there is a devil and he
[1:05:00] impersonates Christ to the letter
[1:05:03] almost amen now he he's going to
[1:05:06] describe
[1:05:08] uh um he's going to describe exactly how
[1:05:12] people came to the point where the H how
[1:05:15] how they worshiped Idols whenever they
[1:05:16] went into the temples and went when they
[1:05:18] went to these places back in the past in
[1:05:20] the Bible times and you're going to see
[1:05:22] that it's a parallel to what he's
[1:05:23] talking about in those previous quotes
[1:05:26] same tape 1961 now idolatry is a strange
[1:05:29] thing down Through the Ages we've had it
[1:05:31] ever since the beginning of time now the
[1:05:33] order for this idol worship is the man
[1:05:36] that sets up the idol fixes the idol
[1:05:39] then he goes in and prepares himself for
[1:05:41] this great worship now he believes that
[1:05:43] the idol is made in the image of some
[1:05:45] God that he has never seen he's without
[1:05:47] form so he believes is in the image of
[1:05:50] this Idol and he makes to this God that
[1:05:51] he makes to this God now don't let that
[1:05:54] believe you the image is in the image of
[1:05:56] the myth mythical god that he believes
[1:05:58] in then he goes to before this Idol and
[1:06:01] prostrates himself and believes that the
[1:06:03] god that's an unseen person comes down
[1:06:05] into this Idol and he believes that he
[1:06:08] talks to God through this Idol that God
[1:06:10] brings himself into this Idol and
[1:06:12] answers him back so that's just like
[1:06:15] people coming to church bowing their
[1:06:17] heads because they want something from
[1:06:19] God and then they empty out their mind
[1:06:20] it's like it has to be through whatever
[1:06:23] this Idol is and he believes that
[1:06:26] whatever and that person believes
[1:06:27] whatever happens in the service whatever
[1:06:29] happens to their Spirit automatically
[1:06:31] came from God that's not always the case
[1:06:35] and many of you teachers here that's
[1:06:36] took the mythology even those gods they
[1:06:38] had battles with one another they
[1:06:40] claimed and everything in those
[1:06:43] days now in other words the God
[1:06:45] hypnotizes himself from a supernatural
[1:06:47] standing into this Idol and speaks back
[1:06:48] to the worshipper through this Idol and
[1:06:51] the worshipper in some kind of a builtup
[1:06:53] emotional sense believes that the idol
[1:06:55] speaks to him to his heart and he's
[1:06:57] forgiven of his sins and what more
[1:06:59] through this Idol which plainly shows
[1:07:01] it's the devil it's the devil that does
[1:07:03] it and they don't just do things
[1:07:05] half-hazard some of them does but some
[1:07:07] there's some true worshippers of these
[1:07:09] things for example I could tell you some
[1:07:11] stories of how those devils and those
[1:07:12] Idols perform all kinds of things make
[1:07:15] blood come out of things and everything
[1:07:16] else they are
[1:07:19] devils now I I believe this is a this is
[1:07:22] a quote where he actually explains
[1:07:25] it this is how you're actually supposed
[1:07:27] to supposed to approach God right and
[1:07:30] God has a provided lamb 1964 it's the
[1:07:33] answer to that question now you see you
[1:07:36] just let yourself believe him now come
[1:07:39] don't let your mind go dormant as people
[1:07:40] says don't do that you don't come to God
[1:07:43] half-hazard you come to him
[1:07:45] intelligently with his word you bring
[1:07:48] the word before you and say Lord I made
[1:07:50] you made the promise I've asked you to
[1:07:52] open my eyes let my my faith stop the
[1:07:54] Lord Jesus tonight may he turn to me and
[1:07:57] tell me like the woman they met many
[1:07:59] years ago and you believe with all your
[1:08:01] heart so when you go to pray to God in
[1:08:04] the service and I'm not just trying to
[1:08:06] scare you guys I mean it's it's a fact
[1:08:09] the devil will try to deceive you in
[1:08:11] church he will try to deceive you at
[1:08:13] home when you're praying it doesn't have
[1:08:15] to be if it's at church it could be
[1:08:18] anywhere you could be praying to what
[1:08:19] you think is God and it's actually the
[1:08:21] devil trying to turn your mind and make
[1:08:24] you dose see the devil if he can
[1:08:26] convince you while you're praying to
[1:08:29] what you think is God if he can convince
[1:08:32] you that whatever answer you're getting
[1:08:34] in that prayer is the right thing to do
[1:08:36] even if it's contrary to his word then
[1:08:39] he can get you to do anything you'll be
[1:08:41] like you ever heard people who say I
[1:08:42] prayed and God told me to do this or I
[1:08:46] prayed and he told me to go there it's
[1:08:48] like okay you're an alcoholic and he
[1:08:50] told you to go to the bar why why would
[1:08:52] he do that that doesn't match his word
[1:08:54] if it doesn't match his word then it
[1:08:56] couldn't have been from God that means
[1:08:58] their prayer should have had the word
[1:09:00] presented before them whenever they went
[1:09:02] to talk to God in the first place then
[1:09:05] if they get an answer that doesn't match
[1:09:07] that that doesn't match the word then
[1:09:09] automatically you know it's not God
[1:09:11] right amen
[1:09:13] amen so I I was on this topic and I was
[1:09:16] thinking how on Earth am I going to get
[1:09:18] this this this portion of this sermon
[1:09:20] across and I was I was like I don't know
[1:09:22] what title to beat so I told Becca about
[1:09:24] it and she was just like I got you a
[1:09:26] title next slide it says an idle mind is
[1:09:28] the devil's
[1:09:30] workshop don't forget that English major
[1:09:34] right
[1:09:35] there don't forget that make sure you
[1:09:38] don't empty your mind and let the devil
[1:09:40] put anything in there amen amen
[1:09:45] now next next
[1:09:47] quote it we're we're going to talk about
[1:09:50] how what kind of idol what things that
[1:09:53] uh we humans make into idols and um it's
[1:09:57] from 1960 the unchangeable God now the
[1:10:00] thing is with the people is the way God
[1:10:01] Appears many times we want to make an
[1:10:04] idol out of god let's stop right there
[1:10:08] now
[1:10:10] um we do this we do this all the time
[1:10:13] now if we if we pray to
[1:10:16] God and have I don't know how to get
[1:10:20] this across so have you ever met or
[1:10:23] heard somebody read it online it might
[1:10:25] be in the comments it might be anywhere
[1:10:26] but somebody talking about God and they
[1:10:28] say how could God let those children die
[1:10:32] you ever heard something like that yeah
[1:10:33] it's like oh another school shooting
[1:10:35] Where's God When that's happening well
[1:10:37] you kicked him out of school so he's not
[1:10:40] there so don't be salty but then they
[1:10:44] then they look in the then they look in
[1:10:46] the newspaper it's like okay Wars and
[1:10:48] wars and stuff going on like that where
[1:10:51] is God when that's happening and then
[1:10:53] some some Christians are at the point
[1:10:55] where they're like oh well my God loves
[1:10:57] everybody he just loves everybody so
[1:10:59] much so we should let those kind of
[1:11:02] Sinners and that kind of sin come into
[1:11:03] church because he just loves everybody
[1:11:06] that's how you get churches who support
[1:11:09] lgbtq rights because they don't
[1:11:11] recognize that they should have looked
[1:11:13] in the word and it said God doesn't
[1:11:15] condone that stuff that's your own
[1:11:17] fabricated idea of what God is they say
[1:11:20] my God wouldn't send anybody to hell
[1:11:23] that's your that's not God that's not
[1:11:26] God my God told me that he would send
[1:11:29] them to hell my God told me that there's
[1:11:31] a law and you should follow his word and
[1:11:34] if you don't follow his word there's a
[1:11:36] consequence because that's what a law is
[1:11:38] and my God doesn't change no matter what
[1:11:40] age it is
[1:11:43] [Applause]
[1:11:45] amen so they want to make an idol out of
[1:11:48] God they make an idol out of what they
[1:11:50] perceive to be God at that point if
[1:11:52] they're not worshiping God then they're
[1:11:53] worshiping an
[1:11:55] idol and it's like my God and then some
[1:11:58] people get to the point where they're
[1:11:59] like okay I have a lot of bad baggage in
[1:12:02] my life and it's sad it's really sad to
[1:12:04] see that I have baggage too we're human
[1:12:07] we have flaws we have character flaws
[1:12:09] from our family traits and then they
[1:12:11] decide oh well God can't change that
[1:12:13] that's just part of my that's just part
[1:12:16] of me so you're telling me the god that
[1:12:18] you created in your head is so weak that
[1:12:21] he can't take care of that he's so weak
[1:12:23] he can't heal you he's so weak that he
[1:12:26] can't touch your situation or change
[1:12:28] your family situation you're telling me
[1:12:30] the god you created in your head is has
[1:12:32] limits that's not exactly what the Bible
[1:12:35] told me it told me that it can fix
[1:12:39] anything anything he has no limits
[1:12:42] because he is Unlimited in power
[1:12:46] am we want to make an idol out of God
[1:12:48] some people they go and pray to God and
[1:12:51] brother bram's about to talk about it
[1:12:53] it's go they go to pray to God and then
[1:12:56] uh they want to treat him like a genie
[1:12:58] like Aladdin's Genie you know or
[1:13:00] something like that it's like anything
[1:13:02] you want just wish for it and then they
[1:13:04] go and pray to God and because he didn't
[1:13:06] say they could have it they they think
[1:13:08] they should cast him aside that's not
[1:13:11] how that works God is God God is
[1:13:14] Sovereign amen now if your definition of
[1:13:17] God when you pray doesn't match the god
[1:13:19] that's in the scripture who can change
[1:13:21] anything that you you you Des desire
[1:13:23] Lord who has unlimited power but also
[1:13:27] has the wisdom to give you what you need
[1:13:30] in the hour that you need it if you
[1:13:31] don't recognize that God acts that way
[1:13:34] then that's your fault cuz he said it in
[1:13:36] plain letter in the King James Bible any
[1:13:39] other Bible too as long as it's the
[1:13:42] Bible now the next slide it says we ask
[1:13:46] God to do something and then he must do
[1:13:48] it just the way that we ask it or we'll
[1:13:50] say he never answered when we do that we
[1:13:52] weaken our faith in God and we weaken
[1:13:55] Our Testimony when we do not take him at
[1:13:57] his word his word said that follow the
[1:14:02] word now in in in the Bible uh Paul is
[1:14:08] actually talking to these Romans in the
[1:14:10] Book of Romans he's he's talking to them
[1:14:12] and the Romans are used to uh worshiping
[1:14:14] a bunch of
[1:14:16] um uh like a whole Pantheon of gods
[1:14:19] right and they're used to worshiping uh
[1:14:22] I always have to Jupiter Saturn Uranus
[1:14:25] all the all the all the nine planets
[1:14:27] they're they're used to worshiping as
[1:14:29] deities and the the I think the C top of
[1:14:32] all of that I think Jupiter was like the
[1:14:34] king of the Gods for them and they
[1:14:35] worship all of these people and Paul has
[1:14:39] to break it down for them and undo all
[1:14:41] of that idolatry that they're used to
[1:14:42] doing and they're used to following
[1:14:44] that's in their society all around them
[1:14:46] so he's talking to them and he's
[1:14:48] breaking down exactly how they get to
[1:14:50] that point where they're worshiping God
[1:14:52] the the fake Gods as opposed to the real
[1:14:55] God that he
[1:14:56] knows in Romans 1:19 it says because
[1:15:00] that that which may be known of God is
[1:15:02] Manifest in them for God hath showed it
[1:15:04] unto them so they were shown these
[1:15:06] things says for the invisible things of
[1:15:09] him from the creation of the world are
[1:15:10] clearly seeing being understood by the
[1:15:13] things that are made even his eternal
[1:15:15] power and godhead so that they are
[1:15:17] without excuse because that when they
[1:15:19] knew God they glorified him not as God
[1:15:22] neither were thankful but became vain in
[1:15:25] their imaginations and their foolish
[1:15:27] heart was darkened so they're creating
[1:15:29] their own Gods out of nothing professing
[1:15:32] themselves to be wise they became
[1:15:34] fools and changed the glory of The
[1:15:36] Incorruptible God into an image made
[1:15:38] like to corrupt corruptible man into
[1:15:41] birds and four-footed beasts and
[1:15:43] creeping things so
[1:15:48] here here back back in habc Chapter 2
[1:15:51] where we started the very first
[1:15:53] scripture it says woe unto him that
[1:15:55] sayith to the wood awake to the dumbster
[1:15:57] it shall teach so it's actually people
[1:16:00] who decide to create something with
[1:16:02] their own hands and the reason they're
[1:16:03] creating this thing with their own hands
[1:16:06] is because they want something they can
[1:16:08] control they want to have control over
[1:16:11] their own worship I feel to realize if
[1:16:14] you actually worship a deity and believe
[1:16:16] that the deity is Sovereign then there's
[1:16:18] nothing you can do to change their
[1:16:20] personality and to change their their
[1:16:22] their attributes and you it down into
[1:16:26] one you can't it it down into that
[1:16:29] because it's a it's a living it's
[1:16:31] something with so much power and a mind
[1:16:34] that's so much higher than yours and yet
[1:16:36] they try to make it into something that
[1:16:37] they can touch with their own hands and
[1:16:39] then they pour gold and silver all over
[1:16:42] it and then call it special and it's
[1:16:44] like that's not what what are you doing
[1:16:47] like if you actually believe that that
[1:16:49] thing had the power to save you then you
[1:16:51] shouldn't be able to make it with your
[1:16:52] own hand you made it in your backyard
[1:16:54] why are you worshiping to that that
[1:16:57] doesn't make any sense and people do the
[1:16:59] same thing nowadays they try to take
[1:17:01] money they try to make as much money as
[1:17:04] they can you
[1:17:06] know we get to the point where we just
[1:17:08] rely on things that we can control I can
[1:17:11] control how much money I make if I work
[1:17:13] harder right and that means that I
[1:17:16] created this thing in my bank account
[1:17:18] that I rely on when things get tough
[1:17:21] amen that's that's my right there some
[1:17:25] people make make children I haven't done
[1:17:27] it yet but some people make
[1:17:30] children and then they idolize their own
[1:17:32] children to the point where they give
[1:17:35] them more time and more resources than
[1:17:37] they give to God you're supposed to give
[1:17:39] your children to God not give your life
[1:17:42] for your children all the time you
[1:17:44] realize if your child goes one way don't
[1:17:46] just don't be like well we got soccer
[1:17:49] practice on Sunday guess I'm missing
[1:17:51] service like come on what are you doing
[1:17:54] you have to follow God God is your god
[1:17:57] not your child am and their Eternal
[1:18:00] destination isn't bent on B bent on
[1:18:02] whether they went into soccer practice
[1:18:04] or not who cares make sure they come to
[1:18:07] church amen idolizing their children how
[1:18:10] much time do we give our children and I
[1:18:12] recognize it's not hard it's not sorry
[1:18:15] God forbid I say that it's not easy to
[1:18:17] parent it's not easy at all to parent
[1:18:19] and I haven't done it yet but I respect
[1:18:22] parents to the m
[1:18:23] and it's so much harder to do that in
[1:18:25] this age right now that we're living in
[1:18:27] I respect parents it's been harder than
[1:18:30] ever any other age to raise kids these
[1:18:34] days but you can't idolize them to that
[1:18:38] point amen so don't idolize your kids do
[1:18:42] we check that off don't idolize God
[1:18:44] check that off the list too don't
[1:18:46] idolize money health insurance right now
[1:18:50] some people here's another one
[1:18:53] they idolize themselves so they get to
[1:18:57] the point and you see this stuff on
[1:18:59] social media all the time right and I'm
[1:19:01] not even on social media but I've heard
[1:19:02] people say this stuff have you ever seen
[1:19:05] if if uh that you need you ever seen
[1:19:08] those statements like you need to learn
[1:19:09] to love yourself you need to learn that
[1:19:12] you're a special human being you're a
[1:19:14] butterfly you're an amazing person and
[1:19:16] if there's anything that people don't
[1:19:18] like about you then it's their fault
[1:19:20] it's their fault they don't understand
[1:19:22] they're the ones causing you trauma you
[1:19:23] need to be you and love yourself so they
[1:19:26] take themselves to that point and then
[1:19:28] they're like oh if you go to therapy
[1:19:30] you're just going to be a perfect human
[1:19:32] being and happy all the time you know
[1:19:34] what that's fake there is nothing you
[1:19:36] can't do anything in your own life to
[1:19:39] perfect yourself that leave the
[1:19:41] Perfection to God let him use you so
[1:19:44] that comes completely at odds with the
[1:19:45] Christianity that we know the
[1:19:47] Christianity we know says God will do
[1:19:49] the perfecting of us he'll accept us in
[1:19:52] a broken condition and he'll make us
[1:19:54] better but they decide that no matter
[1:19:57] what condition you're in if you have a
[1:19:58] negative personality trait it must have
[1:20:00] been your relationship with your father
[1:20:02] it must be your mother who did that to
[1:20:04] you maybe it was but God can make it
[1:20:07] better let him act that
[1:20:10] way idolizing themselves to the point
[1:20:13] where they just spend everything they
[1:20:15] have and on on me time quality time it's
[1:20:19] like they don't live for others see
[1:20:21] eternal life is living for others not
[1:20:23] living for yourself so that's completely
[1:20:26] at odds with exactly how the scripture
[1:20:28] is supposed to work they stop living for
[1:20:32] others they stop caring about
[1:20:35] others and that's exactly how we get to
[1:20:38] the place in this day and age where
[1:20:40] people just they can show up at a school
[1:20:41] just like this one and then shoot it
[1:20:44] up because they don't care and they
[1:20:46] don't value human life what do it matter
[1:20:48] it's not me that's dying it's them I
[1:20:50] decide that they die today amen making
[1:20:53] many gods out of
[1:20:55] themselves that ain't how that
[1:20:59] worked and also along the lines of
[1:21:02] um This Modern Age it talks about God as
[1:21:06] if well they take one or two attributes
[1:21:09] of God and then they push those so hard
[1:21:13] to the point where they forget all his
[1:21:14] other attributes I I was already talking
[1:21:16] about this how they they just say God
[1:21:19] God loves people so God is love amen he
[1:21:21] loves everybody now for God to love the
[1:21:23] world he died for everyone yes um but
[1:21:26] then they take that one step farther and
[1:21:28] they say that he'll never condemn
[1:21:30] someone to
[1:21:32] hell and then they create their own idea
[1:21:35] of God there was this there was this
[1:21:36] thing I saw online and and I'm I'm not
[1:21:39] trying to preach on everything online
[1:21:40] I'd be here all the rest of my life like
[1:21:43] clearly you shouldn't follow everything
[1:21:44] online don't listen to it not everybody
[1:21:46] in the world is doing that one thing
[1:21:47] that you saw that was messed up I I I
[1:21:49] understand that but there was this thing
[1:21:51] where um
[1:21:53] uh has anybody ever heard the the
[1:21:55] Catholic uh Apostles Creed you know I
[1:21:57] believe in the and then communion of the
[1:22:00] Saints blah blah blah so that's bad
[1:22:02] enough but then somebody took that and
[1:22:03] did a filter to it and then they
[1:22:05] modernized it with um with uh the lgbtq
[1:22:10] rights included in there now some of you
[1:22:12] might have seen this it was a lady lady
[1:22:15] priest I guess um and and she she's
[1:22:18] reading this out and it's called the
[1:22:19] sparkle Creed in instead of the Apostles
[1:22:22] Creed it's the sparkle Creed and so they
[1:22:25] took the sparkle Creed and it says uh I
[1:22:28] believe in actually I'm just going to
[1:22:29] pull it up hang on I had it in my notes
[1:22:31] I may as
[1:22:34] well the sparkle
[1:22:40] Creed there we go it
[1:22:43] says I believe in the non-binary guard
[1:22:47] God whose pronouns are plural so they
[1:22:50] took they there's a lot to unpack in the
[1:22:54] first sentence the non-binary god whose
[1:22:57] pronouns are plural so they're saying
[1:22:59] that this God identifies as Jesus as God
[1:23:03] the father and as the Holy Spirit and
[1:23:05] that makes him non-binary and that makes
[1:23:07] his pronouns plural so you should call
[1:23:09] him they like what in the world did you
[1:23:13] do to get
[1:23:16] that I believe in Jesus Christ their
[1:23:19] child who wore a fabulous tunic and had
[1:23:22] two
[1:23:24] dads it's
[1:23:26] like where in the world did you get that
[1:23:29] from are they reading the same book that
[1:23:31] I'm reading do they come up with and and
[1:23:34] they take something and they twist a
[1:23:36] couple details and they decide God's Own
[1:23:38] identity for him and then they said
[1:23:41] that's my God that I created right there
[1:23:44] and that's who I worship so I'm not
[1:23:45] going to read that whole thing it's very
[1:23:47] disturbing
[1:23:49] um it gets worse
[1:23:53] [Applause]
[1:23:55] so in influences 1964 brother brandom's
[1:23:57] talking about a young man he talked to
[1:23:59] and I think it's fitting that it's a
[1:24:00] young man because this is a young modern
[1:24:02] way of thinking that people tend to do
[1:24:05] it said I young I heard a young man tell
[1:24:07] me not long ago he said you know God
[1:24:09] loves me so much brother brandom he just
[1:24:11] lets me do anything I want to he don't
[1:24:14] care next verse says I hear so much
[1:24:17] today about God being a good God he is
[1:24:19] I'm not disputing that he is a good God
[1:24:21] but he's also a god of wrath his
[1:24:24] Holiness requires righteousness his Law
[1:24:27] requires judgment and if there's no
[1:24:28] judgment to law law is of none effect
[1:24:31] what good would it do to say it's
[1:24:33] against the law to run this red light
[1:24:34] down here without being a penalty behind
[1:24:36] it see it would be no law they couldn't
[1:24:39] do nothing about it there isn't a
[1:24:41] penalty there is a penalty of trans for
[1:24:45] transgressing uh God's laws and it will
[1:24:47] you'll have to pay to the utmost far
[1:24:49] thingss before you're brought
[1:24:51] out I'm going to skip down to uh slide
[1:24:55] 81 said a young a young fellow said and
[1:24:57] this is the token 1964 a young fellow
[1:25:00] said the other day God loves me so
[1:25:02] well God is a good god that is true but
[1:25:05] he's also a god of anger too he's a god
[1:25:07] of judgment he's a god of wrath we fail
[1:25:09] to get that you make him so good till
[1:25:11] you make him some old daddy grandpa he's
[1:25:14] not no Daddy grandfather he is almighty
[1:25:16] God and he don't have no grandchildren
[1:25:18] he has Sons and Daughters of God not
[1:25:20] shook hands and adopted in you must be
[1:25:22] born again in the blood applied it's
[1:25:24] Sons and Daughters of God not some old
[1:25:27] soft grandfather let his kids get by
[1:25:29] grandchildren get by with anything he is
[1:25:31] not a grandfather he's a father yes sir
[1:25:33] every child must be born of him he's a
[1:25:35] father of
[1:25:37] Correction so getting to this
[1:25:41] point uh well actually this's this other
[1:25:43] verse it's talking about the the idols
[1:25:45] that people make of their own hands in
[1:25:47] in in Psalm 135 ver1 15 says the idols
[1:25:51] of the heathen are silver and gold the
[1:25:53] work of men's hands they have mouths but
[1:25:55] they speak not eyes have they but they
[1:25:58] see not they have ears but they hear not
[1:26:01] neither is there any breath in their
[1:26:02] mouths they that make them are like unto
[1:26:05] them so is everyone that trusteth in
[1:26:08] them that hits
[1:26:11] hard you
[1:26:13] decided you see see the Pharisees did
[1:26:16] the same thing actually they looked at
[1:26:18] the Old Testament and they saw that
[1:26:20] Jehovah was there and they saw the way
[1:26:21] he was acting through Moses and they
[1:26:24] they they they took his word that Moses
[1:26:27] had given them and then they got to the
[1:26:28] point where they tried to make their own
[1:26:31] selves perfect in that word so their
[1:26:33] Idols they they first off they had a
[1:26:35] false conception of God so that was an
[1:26:37] idol because they they didn't realize
[1:26:39] when God came it was Jesus In the Flesh
[1:26:41] they didn't realize that that was God
[1:26:43] and then when they were they were
[1:26:45] persecuting their own countrymen and
[1:26:47] making them live through the live these
[1:26:49] laws that supposedly God had made up
[1:26:51] they got to the the point where uh they
[1:26:53] weren't following God's word and Jesus
[1:26:56] had to call them out on it
[1:26:58] yeah so the biggest thing I think they
[1:27:01] were idolizing was actually themselves
[1:27:04] cuz they they made these laws they they
[1:27:07] they love the law of Moses so much and
[1:27:09] that it wasn't a bad thing to love to
[1:27:11] love the word of God but what they did
[1:27:13] with it and what it produced in their
[1:27:14] lives proved that their Spirit wasn't
[1:27:16] right right amen so they they they start
[1:27:19] to they love the law so much they start
[1:27:22] creating new laws and then they tried to
[1:27:24] make their countrymen follow those so
[1:27:26] they made their their bodies perfect and
[1:27:28] clean make sure to wash your hands after
[1:27:29] you do this don't touch this don't touch
[1:27:32] that kind of person don't do this don't
[1:27:33] mingle with any and they did all of
[1:27:35] these laws so well to the point where
[1:27:39] they made their bodies a like some sort
[1:27:42] of fake Temple right you know and it's a
[1:27:45] corruptible body so it it has limits on
[1:27:47] how perfect it can be right and yet they
[1:27:50] decide to continue doing that for
[1:27:51] themselves
[1:27:52] this scripture right here it says the
[1:27:55] one I just read it says they have ears
[1:27:57] but they hear not they're not hearing
[1:27:58] the word neither is there any breath in
[1:28:00] their mouths they that make them are
[1:28:02] like unto them so their bodies were just
[1:28:05] like those Idols that the Heathen were
[1:28:07] making right right because they're not
[1:28:09] speaking the word they're not hearing
[1:28:11] the word they're not seeing what's being
[1:28:12] manifested right in front of them
[1:28:14] because they're so caught up and just
[1:28:16] how perfect and amazing they
[1:28:21] are so um let's
[1:28:25] see we're going to look at some
[1:28:27] examples um of exactly how the devil
[1:28:31] turned different things that God gave as
[1:28:33] gifts into idols and um before in order
[1:28:38] to start that I'm going to go back to
[1:28:40] habak 1 verse1 15 says they take up and
[1:28:43] these are it's it's using fishermen as
[1:28:45] an analogy to say how people worship
[1:28:47] idols they say they take all of them
[1:28:49] with the angle they take up all of them
[1:28:51] with an angle angle they catch them in
[1:28:53] their net and gather them in their drag
[1:28:56] therefore they rejoice and are glad
[1:28:58] therefore they sacrifice unto their net
[1:29:00] and burn incense unto their drag because
[1:29:03] by them their portion is fat and their
[1:29:05] meat plenteous so God gave these
[1:29:08] fishermen a gift it's like I've given
[1:29:10] you the tools to catch your own fish and
[1:29:11] that's the net and the drag whatever
[1:29:13] you're using to go catch fish and then
[1:29:15] they're like thank you God then they go
[1:29:16] get their fish and they're like let me
[1:29:18] worship this net it's like doesn't make
[1:29:21] sense they forgot where the net came
[1:29:22] from they forgot Who provided that thing
[1:29:25] in the first place amen am amen that's
[1:29:28] true amen who gave you that in the first
[1:29:31] place so the first example is actually
[1:29:33] going to be uh in 2 Kings
[1:29:36] 18
[1:29:38] um let's go down to
[1:29:44] uh H yeah Second Kings 18 so they come
[1:29:47] there there's a king that comes uh
[1:29:49] around and it's a young man I guess and
[1:29:52] it's uh his name is Hezekiah and he's a
[1:29:55] king of Judah and the first thing he
[1:29:58] does is he starts to cast out Idols from
[1:30:01] the kingdom and it's a good thing it's a
[1:30:03] worthy plan but you got to realize this
[1:30:06] Idol that he's casting out is actually
[1:30:08] something God gave the people way back
[1:30:10] in the book of Exodus or Deuteronomy
[1:30:13] somewhere and uh this Idol you're going
[1:30:16] to recognize it when I read it let's
[1:30:19] jump to verse three and he did that
[1:30:21] which was right in the sight of the Lord
[1:30:23] according to all that David his father
[1:30:25] did he removed the high places and break
[1:30:28] the images and cut down the Groves and
[1:30:30] break in pieces the Brazen serpent that
[1:30:33] Moses had made for unto those days the
[1:30:35] children of Israel did burn incense to
[1:30:37] it and he called it nushin so this
[1:30:40] Brazen
[1:30:41] serpent God recognized that there were
[1:30:43] fiery serpents that you know he they
[1:30:46] they they bit the children of Israel
[1:30:47] because of their Disobedience and and
[1:30:49] not only did he cause judgment to fall
[1:30:51] on them them but he also provided
[1:30:54] healing you know because he's a good God
[1:30:57] they deserved what they were getting but
[1:30:58] he divid decided that there was going to
[1:31:01] be a way for them to find their healing
[1:31:04] so he puts that in the camp it's the he
[1:31:06] tells Moses to to make a Brazen Serpent
[1:31:08] and puts it up there and then they get
[1:31:11] their healing and after the fiery
[1:31:12] serpents this whole episode's done
[1:31:14] someone had to have kept that thing and
[1:31:16] they said well Moses made it so it must
[1:31:19] be
[1:31:20] holy
[1:31:22] debatable but then after that they take
[1:31:24] it one step farther and it's like it's a
[1:31:26] gift from God yes but one step farther
[1:31:29] they take it and then they start to burn
[1:31:31] incense to this fiery Serpent and they
[1:31:34] can point back at the scripture and tell
[1:31:36] anybody who questions them Moses made it
[1:31:38] so it must be fine yeah but this King
[1:31:41] comes and he has to be a Godly King and
[1:31:43] he recognizes this is not right because
[1:31:46] Moses never told us to burn incense to
[1:31:48] it Moses never told us to take it to
[1:31:51] that level it was for healing at that
[1:31:53] appointed time at that time that's like
[1:31:56] the equivalent of us
[1:31:58] um you know God forbid somebody goes to
[1:32:01] brother brandom's grave and they said
[1:32:03] okay well was it his left hand or his
[1:32:05] right hand I think it was his left hand
[1:32:06] would touch people and then it would
[1:32:08] he'd be able to tell exactly who's sick
[1:32:10] and who needs healing and the bumps and
[1:32:12] the stuff would appear on his hand it'll
[1:32:14] be like somebody going and getting that
[1:32:16] hand and expecting it to do healing for
[1:32:19] them and starting to worship it that's
[1:32:21] extreme
[1:32:22] right right right people do that
[1:32:25] spiritually I'm just going to talk about
[1:32:26] it so people do that spiritually they
[1:32:29] decide that their healing if they need
[1:32:32] healing or or not not healing I'm going
[1:32:34] to get out of that people decide that if
[1:32:37] they're going to go to church then they
[1:32:39] recognize that brother brandom was God's
[1:32:42] voice to this age amen I believe that
[1:32:45] but they decide that the only way
[1:32:47] they're going to hear from God is
[1:32:49] through brother brandom yeah yeah and
[1:32:51] then they get to the point where they're
[1:32:53] just listening to tapes only and then
[1:32:56] they get to the point where it's like if
[1:32:57] I go to church and this is their Idol
[1:33:00] right there they decide if I go to
[1:33:02] church I'm not going to be fed unless I
[1:33:05] hear from the tape only yeah and if
[1:33:07] there's anybody else who tries to talk
[1:33:09] to me I'm not going to listen to it
[1:33:12] people do the same thing on the opposite
[1:33:15] end of the
[1:33:17] spectrum they decide if this brother's
[1:33:19] not preaching I'm not going to be f
[1:33:22] yeah if that sister isn't playing the
[1:33:24] piano I just don't really know if I'll
[1:33:27] get a blessing at all and then they get
[1:33:29] to the point where they expect certain
[1:33:31] things to happen in church and they
[1:33:32] decide ahead of time there's no point in
[1:33:36] going there this XYZ isn't happening
[1:33:38] like I realize that God works through
[1:33:41] different people in different ways there
[1:33:44] are people who've been healed listening
[1:33:45] to tapes amen I believe that amen there
[1:33:48] are people who' been healed through
[1:33:49] music or specific preachers or they had
[1:33:52] their prayer answered or God spoke to
[1:33:53] them through specific Ministries but
[1:33:56] when you start to idolize that Ministry
[1:33:58] and decide God can only work through
[1:34:00] that Ministry then you're in the you're
[1:34:03] on the wrong road now there's some
[1:34:05] Churches I've been to I'm going to I'm
[1:34:08] GNA keep going with it certain churches
[1:34:10] I've been to and I'm not condemning this
[1:34:11] church I'm not coming after any
[1:34:13] individual I'm just saying what the root
[1:34:15] of idolatry
[1:34:17] is churches I've been to where their
[1:34:21] ptor passes on godly man amen believe in
[1:34:24] his ministry fine and then they decide
[1:34:28] that they're not going to look for the
[1:34:29] next Ministry or whoever the pastor was
[1:34:32] leading they decide they're only going
[1:34:34] to play recordings of that Pastor and
[1:34:38] that's the only way they're going to get
[1:34:39] fed because apparently when that Pastor
[1:34:41] died God died like you can't hear a
[1:34:44] service after that because that guy that
[1:34:46] come on now don't limit God he can work
[1:34:50] through anyone he can work work through
[1:34:51] a 5-year-old it doesn't matter let him
[1:34:55] work and then they limit God and decide
[1:34:58] that's the only way things are coming to
[1:34:59] me and then it's like they're trying to
[1:35:01] tell god well you're going to work
[1:35:02] through that channel right that's the
[1:35:04] way you're going to do it I'm not going
[1:35:05] to receive it otherwise it's like that
[1:35:07] man who was drowning I think there was
[1:35:09] not drowning but there was a flood and
[1:35:12] then there you know his house is about
[1:35:14] to go under so a Robbo comes by he says
[1:35:17] no God's going to help me I prayed and
[1:35:19] then the Robbo goes on then a motor boat
[1:35:21] comes by the Coast Guard comes by a guy
[1:35:24] with a helicopter comes by just grab the
[1:35:26] ladder come on up no God's going to me
[1:35:29] don't worry about it and then he dies
[1:35:31] and his house is gone he comes to heaven
[1:35:33] what's God going to say I sent you a
[1:35:35] rowboat I sent you the Coast Guard I
[1:35:38] sent you a helicopter and you said no
[1:35:42] and then you come back to me you can't
[1:35:43] blame God at that point if nothing's
[1:35:45] happening in your life you can't blame
[1:35:46] God if you're sitting in a church like
[1:35:48] that and you get to the point where your
[1:35:50] children are going away from the church
[1:35:52] be like God I committed them into your
[1:35:54] hands yeah but did you really feed them
[1:35:56] though right right did you take them to
[1:35:58] the right
[1:35:59] atmosphere did you give them what they
[1:36:00] needed when they needed it did you give
[1:36:03] yourself what you needed when you needed
[1:36:04] it amen you decided that God's going to
[1:36:08] work that way and that's just it's just
[1:36:11] it's the same exact thing as what
[1:36:13] Catholics
[1:36:15] do because they go to church and and I
[1:36:18] have quotes on this I'm just off my
[1:36:20] notes whatever but they go to church and
[1:36:23] I used to go to a Catholic school and
[1:36:26] this is what you see whenever you walk
[1:36:27] in a Catholic Church anywhere you go
[1:36:28] because I've been been to them around
[1:36:30] the world and you walk inside and if
[1:36:32] it's a big enough Catholic Church like a
[1:36:34] cathedral and everything you're going to
[1:36:36] see um statues or pictures of saints
[1:36:40] lining the walls Going Down the Walls
[1:36:42] like that and you'll see uh in front of
[1:36:45] the Saints you're going to see these uh
[1:36:47] little uh shelves right there and it'll
[1:36:49] describe the saint and it'll say what
[1:36:51] they did and then what they do is each
[1:36:54] Saint is specialized for specific
[1:36:56] reasons so you go to them for specific
[1:36:59] reasons and then you get to what what a
[1:37:04] good Catholic will do is when they want
[1:37:06] to pray to
[1:37:07] God they go and grab a candle they pay a
[1:37:11] bit of money they get a candle it's like
[1:37:12] this big and then they light it and then
[1:37:14] they take it to that sent the the saint
[1:37:16] and whichever Saint will answer their
[1:37:18] prayer they go and then they place it
[1:37:20] right there and then they light it and
[1:37:22] then they pray to St uh Cecilia mother
[1:37:25] Mary whoever it is they'll pray to that
[1:37:27] person and that person's supposed to
[1:37:29] talk to God for
[1:37:31] them it's the same thing tell me how
[1:37:34] that spirit's different you decide that
[1:37:36] you go to church and it's like oh I'm
[1:37:37] not spiritual enough I'm going to have
[1:37:39] brother whoever pray for me cuz he has a
[1:37:42] gift of talking to God you realize God
[1:37:44] wants to talk to you he wants to answer
[1:37:48] your prayer like it doesn't you
[1:37:50] shouldn't diminish your own prayer
[1:37:52] because you have that access to him what
[1:37:54] do you think he died for so you can talk
[1:37:57] to him directly am amen he did away with
[1:38:00] that priest
[1:38:01] nonsense like we shouldn't be dealing
[1:38:03] with that be like oh I got to take my
[1:38:05] lamb and have it sacrificed by the high
[1:38:08] priest to make sure he absolves my sins
[1:38:09] no we don't do that that's not what
[1:38:12] that's about you shouldn't have somebody
[1:38:13] pray for you if you haven't prayed for
[1:38:16] yourself amen amen now I recognize God
[1:38:19] can work through somebody praying for
[1:38:21] someone specifically he told first thing
[1:38:23] he told Paul when he had scales on his
[1:38:25] eyes go to ananas He he'll pray for you
[1:38:27] and that'll be like you might have that
[1:38:28] Revelation but 90% of the time come on
[1:38:30] now yeah pray for yourself yeah you're
[1:38:34] like oh I got to go to this service in
[1:38:35] this camp in this state in this country
[1:38:38] and make sure that brother who's having
[1:38:40] service there lays his hands on me
[1:38:42] otherwise it's not going to happen
[1:38:46] ridiculous amen and we decide that they
[1:38:48] work that way you know some people
[1:38:51] people idolize their um their parents
[1:38:53] and I I used I didn't well as a child I
[1:38:56] thought like a child right as a child I
[1:38:58] was like my mom and my dad they were the
[1:39:00] epitome of spiritual to me because they
[1:39:03] were my spiritual guides and that's how
[1:39:04] it should be right
[1:39:06] but in growing up I I always thought
[1:39:09] well if anybody in our family is making
[1:39:11] it to Heaven it's Mom that's what I
[1:39:13] thought you know I was like it's
[1:39:14] definitely her and then I I I used to
[1:39:17] think that she was just like the epitome
[1:39:19] of what spiritual means and if I could
[1:39:21] just get on her level and it's good to
[1:39:23] have um mentors but if it it got to a
[1:39:27] point where I realized I needed God for
[1:39:30] me I needed my relationship with God
[1:39:33] myself now you can do that when you
[1:39:36] think like a child but when you don't
[1:39:38] realize that it's for you no matter what
[1:39:40] your age is then yeah you're in trouble
[1:39:43] right
[1:39:45] there so there's actually I'm just going
[1:39:49] to try to find that quote because it's
[1:39:50] relevant to what I was just saying I
[1:39:52] know I said I was going to talk about
[1:39:53] examples then I only did one so
[1:39:58] uh another example I think I talked
[1:40:00] about it last time I ministered here it
[1:40:01] was somewhere in July and it was talking
[1:40:03] about the CH children of
[1:40:07] Israel um when they left Egypt they were
[1:40:10] given extra things by the Egyptians and
[1:40:13] it was their jewelry it was the earrings
[1:40:14] and all that stuff that they took from
[1:40:16] the Egyptians and then those same uh
[1:40:19] pieces of jewelry Aaron fashes them
[1:40:21] fashion them into the golden calf that
[1:40:24] was another example and um it's just a
[1:40:27] gift of God that was turned into
[1:40:29] something bad hang on give me a second
[1:40:31] I'm going to look through
[1:40:34] these you know what get that
[1:40:45] here right so my last example is
[1:40:48] actually from Daniel chapter
[1:40:51] whatever uh chapter one now I'm going to
[1:40:54] preface this pre preface this um when
[1:40:58] Daniel gets captured by the uh Babylon
[1:41:03] Babylonians in Nebuchadnezzar's King he
[1:41:05] he changes their names of the of of
[1:41:07] these people he wants to serve him that
[1:41:09] were used to be Israelites uh because
[1:41:11] he's just trying to change their entire
[1:41:13] identity and um he decides that he's
[1:41:16] going to name Daniel Bel shazar right
[1:41:19] and when when it comes to the point
[1:41:21] where he has this dream and his wise men
[1:41:24] cannot answer this question of what the
[1:41:26] dream means Daniel comes and he
[1:41:29] interprets the dream by the help of the
[1:41:30] Lord and he's still calling him Bazar
[1:41:33] because he thinks his identities changed
[1:41:34] but that's not it's that's not how
[1:41:36] identities work but Daniel is still
[1:41:38] Daniel and he's still praying to God so
[1:41:41] the blessing came through Daniel but
[1:41:44] Nebuchadnezzar still sees Daniel as
[1:41:46] Bazar and the reason he sees him as
[1:41:49] Bazar is because I think brother brandom
[1:41:52] says that uh Nebuchadnezzar worshiped
[1:41:55] Bel shazar as his God so he thought that
[1:41:58] Daniel was his God right there so
[1:42:01] whenever the whenever um you look at
[1:42:04] Daniel chapter 2: 46 now
[1:42:07] Nebuchadnezzar's reaction whenever
[1:42:09] Daniel interprets the dream says then
[1:42:11] the King Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his
[1:42:15] face and worshiped Daniel and commanded
[1:42:17] that he they should offer an oblation
[1:42:18] and sweet odors to him the king answered
[1:42:20] unto D Daniel and said of a truth it is
[1:42:22] that your God is a god of gods and a
[1:42:24] lord of kings and a revealer of Secrets
[1:42:26] seeing that thou couldest reveal this
[1:42:27] secret so he recognize that recognize
[1:42:30] that God is working through Daniel but
[1:42:33] he deifies Daniel to the point now when
[1:42:35] down the line I don't know it's probably
[1:42:37] the very next chapter he creates this
[1:42:39] image of Bazar and he tells the three
[1:42:42] Hebrew children Daniel's friends he
[1:42:44] tells them to worship that in the
[1:42:46] handwriting on the wall 1956 brother
[1:42:48] brandom says now I want you to notice as
[1:42:50] soon as the king saw this vision and he
[1:42:52] made it he forced every person in his
[1:42:54] kingdom in his domain to worship this
[1:42:56] image he made an image and it's believed
[1:42:58] by Scholars which I do believe that a
[1:43:01] spirit filled person would see it that
[1:43:03] he worshiped Daniel is what he did and
[1:43:05] he made an image to Daniel and he called
[1:43:07] it Bazar he called Daniel Bazar which
[1:43:10] was the name of his God and he made an
[1:43:12] image and forced every person to worship
[1:43:14] that image so if you recognize the
[1:43:17] spirit behind what Nebuchadnezzar is
[1:43:20] doing and you recognize how it manifests
[1:43:22] itself in this day you see people who
[1:43:25] decide God works through a certain
[1:43:27] Ministry or a certain person or a
[1:43:29] certain thing and then they try to hold
[1:43:32] the whole world accountable to that
[1:43:33] thing it's like they create their own
[1:43:36] version of how God operates and they
[1:43:37] said if you don't do it this way you're
[1:43:40] wrong and you're not going to go to
[1:43:42] heaven you're not in the will of God
[1:43:44] read between the lines
[1:43:46] here it's scary it's the same exact
[1:43:49] thing and
[1:43:51] I just want to say that we should be
[1:43:53] immune to this
[1:43:55] like there there are way too many
[1:43:57] examples of how God operates in the
[1:43:59] Bible it is varied he appears in many
[1:44:02] different ways he he talked to many
[1:44:05] different people and we shouldn't be
[1:44:08] beholden to something like that
[1:44:09] shouldn't let the let the devil dictate
[1:44:12] how he gets worship you see the devil he
[1:44:14] doesn't care what Avenue you take to
[1:44:18] worship the devil God doesn't take
[1:44:20] second hand worship the devil does Amen
[1:44:23] cuz as long as you're not worshiping God
[1:44:25] all avenues lead to the devil it doesn't
[1:44:28] matter everything I just named leads to
[1:44:30] the devil so he doesn't care how he gets
[1:44:32] you to fall to the left and right like
[1:44:35] clearly being in the message is not
[1:44:37] enough because in the message could mean
[1:44:39] worshiping somebody indirectly it's like
[1:44:42] oh well that must be the eighth
[1:44:44] messenger so everybody needs to follow
[1:44:46] him right that means it leads to the
[1:44:48] devil cuz it's not matching what's in
[1:44:50] the word amen amen the devil don't care
[1:44:53] musicians can come back the devil does
[1:44:55] not care how he gets his worship are
[1:44:58] there things in our lives that we need
[1:45:00] to think
[1:45:01] about and double check and be like God I
[1:45:04] I don't know where all my time is going
[1:45:09] but it's not going to you for some
[1:45:11] reason I need to get that out of the
[1:45:13] way I don't know where all my resources
[1:45:16] are going but they're keeping me from
[1:45:20] paying towards your kingdom they're
[1:45:22] keeping me from paying my tithes from
[1:45:25] offering as much as I want to offer
[1:45:28] they're keeping me from uh giving my
[1:45:31] gift to you like if you have a gift for
[1:45:33] the Lord and you're not using it for God
[1:45:35] for some reason what is that that you're
[1:45:37] using it for he gave it to you he's the
[1:45:39] creator of that gift he gave you arms
[1:45:42] legs he gave you limbs you can work
[1:45:44] every day you can make your money you
[1:45:47] can he gave you a spirit to worship Him
[1:45:49] by yes yes and we fail to do that over
[1:45:54] and over again whenever we don't take
[1:45:55] him at his word and listen to what he
[1:45:57] has to say come through his path let him
[1:46:00] work through whatever path he wants to
[1:46:02] work through let's bow our heads just

[1:48:24] there uh just so
[1:48:27] much uh that was said this
[1:48:31] morning amen into that um on
[1:48:35] idolatry you know the prophet was saying
[1:48:38] how uh it'll be so close it'll deceive
[1:48:41] the very
[1:48:43] elect and uh we're living in the most
[1:48:46] deceptive time that ever been uh he
[1:48:51] wants to deceive us into
[1:48:55] worshiping the idol worshiping him he
[1:48:58] read the scripture there how he would
[1:49:00] Place himself here he would Place
[1:49:02] himself there the were people are
[1:49:04] worshiping the devil thinking that
[1:49:07] they're worshiping God
[1:49:10] yes that's a real bad place to
[1:49:14] be amen so and he gave us amen so many
[1:49:18] wonderful examples and
[1:49:20] things he said how uh uh the
[1:49:24] truth uh is in the uh to say the stature
[1:49:27] of a perfect man you have uh Faith
[1:49:31] virtue knowledge
[1:49:33] Temperance patience God brotherly
[1:49:36] kindness godliness but you take one
[1:49:39] ingredient the
[1:49:41] godliness and replace it with
[1:49:46] pride godliness is humility yes amen but
[1:49:51] if you replace that with pride begin to
[1:49:54] get in mhm and you have a whole you it
[1:49:57] it it looks good it looks good to the
[1:50:00] outer man it looks good to the Natural
[1:50:02] Eye it looks good to the
[1:50:05] mind but that Pride begins to defile the
[1:50:08] whole body yes yes amen defile the whole
[1:50:11] image

[1:50:15] everything you're shouting you're going
[1:50:16] to church and it all looks good it looks
[1:50:18] Prim it looks propit it looks good but
[1:50:20] it's
[1:50:22] false he say he that worship Him must
[1:50:24] worship Him in spirit and

[1:52:42] amen amen amen
[1:52:45] idolatry it'll be so close till it'll
[1:52:49] deceive the very elect it if it was
[1:52:53] possible amen Prophet said this here he
[1:52:56] said it'll be as close as your right
[1:52:59] hand and your left
[1:53:01] hand on each hand I got five
[1:53:05] fingers they look exactly the
[1:53:08] same but one is right and one is wrong

[1:53:31] close so a lot of times
[1:53:34] we people are looking for the wrong
[1:53:40] things they're looking
[1:53:44] for and not saying not all these things
[1:53:46] are wrong but you you you're trying to
[1:53:48] find these things in and you just like
[1:53:50] he said probably said they come in they
[1:53:52] empty their mind oh Lord don't
[1:53:56] that or they or they looking for looking
[1:54:00] for God but they looking for God in
[1:54:03] knowledge yeah yeah amen looking for
[1:54:06] them in knowledge but you don't get the
[1:54:09] wisdom of the Holy Ghost amen amen see
[1:54:12] knowledge you can have all of the not
[1:54:14] knowledge is just information yes yes
[1:54:16] yes it's like the ingredients to baking

[1:54:22] he's already made the cake and oh the
[1:54:25] the the cake is is oh it tastes so good
