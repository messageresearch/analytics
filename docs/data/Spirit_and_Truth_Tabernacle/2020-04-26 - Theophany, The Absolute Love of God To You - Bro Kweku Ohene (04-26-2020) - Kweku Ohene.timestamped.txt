[36:55] Corinthians chapter 5 let's read from
[37:00] verse 1 to 7 2nd Corinthians 5:1 to 7 it
[37:08] reads for we know that if our earthly
[37:10] House of this Tabernacle when dissolved
[37:13] we have a building of God and house not
[37:16] made with hands eternal in the heavens
[37:18] for in this we groan and earnestly
[37:21] desiring to be clothed upon with our
[37:23] house which is from heaven if so be that
[37:26] being clothed we shall not be found
[37:28] naked for we that are in this tabernacle
[37:31] do groan being burdened not for that we
[37:34] will be unclothed but clothed upon that
[37:37] mortality might be swallowed up of life
[37:40] now he that has he that has Roth as for
[37:44] the same soft in his God who also has
[37:46] given unto us the earnest of the spirit
[37:49] therefore we are always confident
[37:51] knowing that whilst we at home in the
[37:54] body we are absent from the Lord 7 for
[37:57] we walk by faith not by sight amen
[38:00] Lord may add redeemed blessing to the
[38:03] reading of your word shall be seated
[38:05] glory hallelujah let's take our second
[38:08] Bible reading if we can officiant
[38:11] chapter 3 verse 14 to 7 officiants 3:14
[38:17] to 7
[38:22] the book of poor to the Christians in
[38:25] Ephesus amen and the same scriptures for
[38:28] 2,000 or more years it's still valid
[38:30] amen
[38:31] science can bring out something medicine
[38:36] at the cost of time they'll say this
[38:37] treatment doesn't work but the Word of
[38:39] God is Satana amen it doesn't matter the
[38:43] might get older the more get richer so
[38:46] we can so get vitamins from the word of
[38:48] the Lord Ephesians 3:14 2:17 for this
[38:51] course I bow my knees on to the father
[38:53] of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the
[38:56] whole family in heaven and earth is
[38:58] named and I want to know what does it

[39:08] to the riches of his glory to be
[39:11] strengthened with might by his spirit in
[39:13] the inner man that Christ may be the
[39:16] Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith
[39:18] that ye being rooted and grounded in
[39:22] love jesus answered and said unto them
[39:25] this is the work of God oh sorry I'm
[39:27] reading another scripture who God bless
[39:29] you so that is it does end of
[39:31] description amen
[39:32] so best to set the whole family sorry
[39:36] verse 15 the whole family in heaven and
[39:38] earth is named Jesus Christ amen
[39:41] but the office condoms are no Jesus
[39:44] Christ but a jack is brother Jack what a
[39:46] polychaete then how are we named Jesus
[39:49] Christ we will find out name in a human
[39:53] form name is just a word but name in
[39:56] spiritual meaning is a nature it's an
[39:59] attribute is a spirit there's a street
[40:03] behind every name that's a life form we
[40:05] had every name so we are named the
[40:08] family in heaven and the family in Earth
[40:10] is named after the Lord Jesus Christ
[40:12] because that's the only name that is a
[40:14] name all other billions and trillions of
[40:16] names are known names the only name
[40:18] before God is the name Jesus Christ amen
[40:21] that is why he named his sons and
[40:23] daughters Jesus Christ so my name is not
[40:27] Jesus crab my name is Kru quick please
[40:29] go hallelujah
[40:30] my name is Fisk and even spoken you
[40:32] afraid but that's not name that's not a
[40:36] name literally the name is the nature of
[40:38] Jesus Christ so for him to identify you
[40:40] as a son or daughter he has to put his
[40:43] name up on you he also put his nature in
[40:46] you he has to put his real life in you
[40:48] he also put his gene in you he also put
[40:50] his blood in you he has to be you be put
[40:54] himself in you amen so that you become
[40:56] him so the family in heaven and earth is
[40:59] named even the Angels so how can Angels
[41:02] be named after Jesus Christ their life
[41:04] in the Angels is the life of Jesus
[41:06] Christ that's why they do his walk Satan
[41:10] was in him after Jesus Lucifer had power
[41:13] he was created giving glory but it
[41:15] wasn't named after Jesus Christ so it's
[41:18] a tempura bean and all that came comes
[41:20] out of Lucifer is tempura amen
[41:23] but then if you are son of God you are a
[41:26] daughter of Elohim you are named after
[41:28] the Lord Jesus Christ and you live
[41:30] eternally amen
[41:32] so let me read one scripture John 6:29
[41:36] John 6:29 certain people came to Jesus
[41:40] Christ they wanted to work for God and
[41:42] Jesus gave them as very simple answer
[41:44] jesus answered and said to them John
[41:47] 6:29 jesus answered and said unto them
[41:50] this is the work of God that he believed
[41:53] on him whom he has sent
[41:56] he believed on whom he on him whom he
[42:02] has sent
[42:03] amen so if Jesus said but I guarantee
[42:07] you it better Jackson but I get a
[42:08] gariand - but a symbol that okay but a
[42:13] garyun good trouble a symbol to meet me
[42:15] as his o'clock and but as much I want to
[42:18] offer a jack I want to maybe go and
[42:19] clean his house but then he's less in a
[42:22] restaurant or he's somewhere he's in
[42:25] Miami and it's em but i guarante to tell
[42:27] you to go meet him in Miami and so no I
[42:30] want to really work for buddy Jack I
[42:31] want to do something good for a jack
[42:33] I'm going to result so clean and mob the
[42:34] hopeless our let's Sarah Connor awake
[42:37] I'm just suggesting I'll stay put I'm
[42:39] going to do all everything want me to do
[42:41] you I want to do for you but anybody
[42:43] just said that come and meet me in Miami
[42:46] Airport so if you want to wait for by
[42:48] the Jack you don't have to go and wake
[42:51] in his home
[42:52] go and take over his job go and clean
[42:54] his house you just go to Miami that is
[42:57] where he went that is a wake he want you
[42:59] to do but that is not a wake I don't
[43:01] really spend any energy by driving to
[43:04] Miami I want to really wafer to Jack on
[43:06] to clean his house and please mortgage
[43:09] and do everything I can do for Jack but
[43:11] he said that meet me in Miami that is
[43:14] the work he want you to do amen so this
[43:17] what that word for the Lord they were
[43:20] maybe young energetic young men and
[43:22] women they wanted to do something for
[43:24] God the water to maybe build a temple
[43:26] for the Lord they wanted to do something
[43:27] great which is good but what of God said
[43:30] believe on Him whom I sent out to you
[43:36] amen
[43:38] believe believe is like this Bible is
[43:41] black in color I believe it that is
[43:43] mentor that is not belief believe if you
[43:46] bring the word belief be life become the
[43:49] life of Jesus Christ because the one
[43:51] that he sent he's put his life in him
[43:53] and when you believe you received
[43:55] believe means receive and eat and become
[43:58] that amen so when the Lord sent his word
[44:01] through his prophet through seventh
[44:03] through his hand made unto you and
[44:05] receive the word and either way you
[44:07] become him that is when you come work
[44:09] for the Lord amen so just like we get
[44:12] out a lot you can go to a Jack's house
[44:13] and work all day long and you be sit in
[44:16] Miami with him for you you didn't work
[44:18] for him that work is work done is zero
[44:21] amen so to work for the Lord you have to
[44:24] believe a set with who heartedly
[44:27] with all your heart that what a lot has
[44:29] sent on to you amen what gasps oh no -
[44:32] is his weight how does it send into
[44:34] depth through the Prophet through the
[44:36] Apostles through the passes through the
[44:39] bishops from evangelists through teaches
[44:42] through
[44:42] we men through men amen it could be a
[44:45] little sister who give you a testimony
[44:47] she is the one the Lord has sent to you
[44:49] if you believe that word believe the
[44:51] Lord Jesus Christ amen
[44:53] in the times of the Old Testament there
[44:55] was a captain code name and he was full
[44:58] of he had leprosy was a big man he had
[44:59] all the money everything but he had
[45:02] leprosy and there was this lot of

[45:28] mean rid you of your leprosy so if you
[45:31] don't mind your husband I can take you
[45:32] to my prophet my pastor you can pray for
[45:34] you and your leprosy will leave you so
[45:37] for also eventually accepted and when it
[45:40] kept became before I think the girl is
[45:42] called Rhoda is that right no no no that

[45:46] right let's go sister
[45:51] so this is Science Institute and the key
[45:55] the captain's wife and they went to the
[45:57] prophet and the Prophet was said go and
[46:00] kick shower or bath swim in the river
[46:02] Jordan seven times and all your liberals
[46:05] will leave you and this one was so upset
[46:08] I wanted to come in I mean you meet me
[46:11] and tell me something maybe do some
[46:13] miracle she do something out full
[46:15] sensation and you are telling me to go
[46:17] and I mean swim in a river bath in a
[46:20] river he was mad he was like really mad
[46:22] and the little girl said I've told you
[46:26] to do something big maybe to do to go
[46:27] and kill a lion or bring a lifeline on
[46:29] probably you fight and do it but it is
[46:32] so simple the Word of God is so simple
[46:34] so finally came back himself he listened
[46:36] to the feel funny and went to swim or we
[46:39] went to bath in the river seven times
[46:41] and the leprosy left him amen the same
[46:44] thing the Word of God is life it could
[46:47] be so simple that if you don't have
[46:49] something here to cook in that word it
[46:51] will pass through one here go through
[46:54] the next year and you not know that
[46:56] means the Word of God amen but thank God
[46:59] he puts something in us the control
[47:01] tower that is able to detect the way
[47:04] that when you hear the word something
[47:07] you begin to stay up that this is who I
[47:09] am
[47:10] this is where I belong to this is what I
[47:12] want to hear this was I was made up for
[47:14] God blesses the Kylene good to see you
[47:17] this is what I was made up for and then
[47:20] you receive that one who heartedly amen
[47:22] and I begin to have effect in your life
[47:24] so we want to title our Semin feel funny
[47:29] the absolute love of God to you amen
[47:32] glory hallelujah
[47:33] whew funny the absolute love of God to
[47:36] you now what is it feel funny when I
[47:42] talk about few funny tea fan is not in
[47:44] the inner scriptures it's a theologian
[47:46] way to describe the Spirit of the Lord
[47:48] the weight body the celestial body the
[47:51] true you the love of God to you amen
[47:54] what do you think about love you might
[47:55] think love is like if somebody gives you
[47:58] 1 million that person really really
[47:59] loves you that is not love that is
[48:03] perish that money can perish when I is
[48:06] in the form of credit card in form of
[48:08] paper American dollar dead presidents
[48:10] inaudible candle all right it's the
[48:13] president if you see Lincoln Washington
[48:17] Welles name them Adams Quincy Adams they
[48:20] are dead president so when it is the
[48:23] money's already dead it goes into your
[48:24] pocket and it just vanishes it's a dead
[48:27] president that's what we labor for right
[48:29] so if you give you billions of debt
[48:31] president is gonna just melt out you
[48:34] know you just give a let let's have a
[48:37] little economic downtown down 10 all the
[48:40] money will melt out the investment
[48:42] vanishes it sizzles off so you can put
[48:45] your trust in that money that is no
[48:48] laugh that can help you to do something
[48:49] earthly as we need it as human beings
[48:51] but that is not absolute that do not
[48:54] take you know way just within a month
[48:56] companies have lost yeah whatever just
[48:59] name them they are capital small
[49:01] businesses have shut down since our
[49:04] lines are going bankrupt they need
[49:06] government to build them
[49:07] the government is already bankrupt so
[49:10] where are we going can you put your
[49:13] trust in those systems absolutely no
[49:16] that is not the love of God that is good
[49:18] as long as we live here we're gonna need
[49:20] them but that is not in China by God
[49:23] give you something that will stay with
[49:25] you the rest of your life that is a wet
[49:28] body that is the Holy Spirit that is the
[49:31] end s of your life on this earth that is
[49:34] all that you are aiming for if you miss
[49:36] that target just like per day but the
[49:39] analogy if you don't go to Miami to meet
[49:41] brother but a jack and you go and clean
[49:43] all his house you submit a target you
[49:45] didn't work for the Lord the Lord said I
[49:47] depart from me I didn't know you amen so
[49:50] before you came here
[49:52] they'll not already know that you're
[49:53] going to go here he ordained you for
[49:55] this life he owed ended to go into this
[49:57] sinful world world full of sin unbelief
[50:01] in the quiddity confusion depression
[50:04] anxiety just name them
[50:06] medicines all over cancer HIV full of
[50:10] death the Lord ordained you to be here
[50:12] and for you to be able to live here
[50:14] manifest him he put a little a lot of
[50:17] spot something little but a button a
[50:19] light in you called a solution being
[50:22] called a representation called a wet
[50:24] body called a few funny and that was
[50:27] with you even when you didn't know amen
[50:29] sometimes if you are by yourself all
[50:32] alone it's like someone is following you
[50:34] it's not someone follow you is the true
[50:36] you that one toward that want you to let
[50:39] you know that you have a pain in you you
[50:42] are not just by yourself
[50:44] amen and that is the real you amen
[50:47] that is the true you amen that is a
[50:50] celestial body so the few funnest few
[50:52] means invisible God funny means made
[50:55] visible I think it's a Greek word
[50:57] so God wanted to be visible in this
[50:59] dimension the a lot of Street here but
[51:02] you can see them with his eyes so God
[51:04] has to wrap you around sixteen element
[51:06] of flesh and blood of calcium potassium
[51:09] ion iodine
[51:11] cosmic light and then put the seed in it
[51:15] glory hallelujah let's just read the
[51:17] little codes here praise be to God glory
[51:21] to God let's read from the message our
[51:23] prophet preach God and the entombment
[51:26] tomb when you hear about tomb we think
[51:29] about cascade burial but there's another
[51:31] entombed in 1988 5 7 - 0 4 - 0 5 7 - 0 4
[51:38] - 0 the end human okay let's read
[51:41] paragraph mm paragraph $50 is even that
[51:45] and then no doubt in my mind but that is
[51:49] what Jesus had in his mind when he was
[51:51] here on earth was the infallibility of
[51:53] gas it ran away for we know that in him
[51:56] - all the fullness of Godhead body the
[51:59] entire Godhead was in him he was both
[52:01] Father Son and Holy Ghost but world
[52:04] enough in a human form the few funny of
[52:06] God the great image of God that he made
[52:09] man in then pleased him in the eighth
[52:12] amen so before you were pleased here you
[52:16] had a few funny way before the
[52:18] foundation of the world glory hallelujah
[52:20] he had a body God isn't without a
[52:23] bodyguard has got a body and it looks
[52:26] like a man Moses saw it and they saw it
[52:28] any loose like a man 51 it's just an
[52:32] impression that is this is of what that
[52:35] is this earth is an impression it's a
[52:38] shadow of the feel funny and everything
[52:41] on earth the beauty the sweetness the
[52:43] ability of the earth is nothing else in
[52:45] the world but an answer to a far better
[52:47] than that that wins when we leave this
[52:51] world for everything in earth is just a
[52:53] pattern of that which is in heaven
[52:55] everything is that is good everything
[52:57] that is righteous everything that is
[52:59] beautiful trees birds everything is just
[53:02] a pattern of what is in heaven
[53:04] 52 our life our own life is just a
[53:08] pattern it's just a shadow not a real
[53:10] thing is the negative side so why is the
[53:14] positive if this life we adore we
[53:17] cherish we work for we put on the best
[53:20] clothes the best houses the best shoes
[53:24] the best price the best tuxedos the best
[53:27] wedding garments
[53:28] name them the best vehicles is a
[53:31] negative then where's the positive we
[53:35] need to write a look for the positive
[53:37] amen it takes death to develop the
[53:42] picture to put you back in that feel
[53:45] funny we come from so you come from the
[53:50] few funny
[53:51] the few funny didn't just drop here it's
[53:54] not going to be when you die but you
[53:55] come from the few funny you know the
[53:58] Word of God is like a nugget it's like a
[54:00] good when you get the good it does
[54:03] something to you
[54:04] amen the law review this to me when I
[54:06] was in England one time I was reading
[54:08] and I could read the message and fall
[54:10] asleep would laptop on my on my chest
[54:12] and I look at as a week back from the
[54:15] few funny we come from
[54:16] so we already come from the few funny we
[54:19] are not trying to get a few funny but we
[54:21] keep from the few five amen
[54:24] it's known now God is trying to get you
[54:26] a to funny because you have done
[54:27] something good because you have given
[54:29] your life to him but you came from the
[54:31] few funny
[54:32] that's your origin before I came here
[54:35] you came from your heart before you came
[54:37] to the church you were some way you are
[54:40] in your home amen let me give an analogy
[54:43] let's say you go to town go shopping and
[54:45] if you can shot let's say Walmart or
[54:47] Publix wherever there's gunshot what I
[54:49] gonna do you quickly jump in your
[54:50] vehicle if you have your family around
[54:52] run I will go back away to restaurant no
[54:56] to your house because you don't know
[54:58] what's gonna happen at the restaurant
[54:59] around so you go back to your house so
[55:02] your house is where you come from
[55:04] that is your origin amen so before you
[55:07] get this negative that we are struggling
[55:09] for trying to bet I trying to give
[55:11] educated trying to give it health trying
[55:14] to do all that it is so that negative a
[55:17] decorated donkey slide is a donkey you
[55:20] can decorate an ass and put all the
[55:22] velvet clothes on it or the best clothes
[55:26] embroidery on them that donkey is lana's
[55:29] it's like donkey it's not going to make
[55:32] become a human being so no matter how we
[55:34] better this guy no matter how cream it
[55:37] up give it a best hairdo
[55:40] give it a beautiful hair cut like butter
[55:41] butter butter a Simha has got his hair
[55:43] cut if fighting for the negative why
[55:57] don't you fight for the positive if you
[56:06] are putting so much emphasis on the
[56:07] negative which you filled out with no
[56:10] matter how we try to polish it up it is
[56:12] still going to dissolve anyways no
[56:14] matter how long he lives here
[56:16] you can leave us old as Adam I think it
[56:18] was 9:30 Methuselah was adding nicest
[56:20] the nicest nicest night is that when I
[56:24] go back to wake him from is when I
[56:26] dissolve so why don't we put emphasis on
[56:29] their positive which is the feel funny
[56:31] which is your origin
[56:33] what is the house who came up who came
[56:35] from amen
[56:37] glory hallelujah who is going to spend
[56:40] his money so the Walmart is that is
[56:42] Columbus in a Walmart do you do that do
[56:45] you buy pendants or the Walmart I love
[56:47] this format is where I shop it's it's
[56:48] the Pens are filled out hey let me get
[56:50] some plates and Graham pitched in the
[56:52] Walmart you never do that
[56:54] the money the corporate dekenia billions
[56:56] don't put in my pocket it's not my job
[56:58] it's not what I just go and shop over
[57:00] there you read up put your money in your
[57:02] home we're innovate your home so if you
[57:04] put so much emphasis on this negative
[57:06] which is like a Walmart you're just
[57:08] going shopping it and live out how much
[57:10] more your home
[57:13] [Applause]
[57:17] this is just a Walmart it will show up
[57:19] in it 400 years 50 years two years five
[57:22] years five minutes some people don't
[57:25] even last more than 20 minutes so we
[57:26] wouldn't just get born and just go back
[57:28] to the other side 200 years with a
[57:31] Walmart you're not gonna live there
[57:33] forever you just shop and get few things
[57:35] over there and then go back home so if
[57:38] you've got money because then you
[57:39] renovate your home you paint your house
[57:41] amen
[57:42] if you want to put something emphasize
[57:45] something that is glory glorified it
[57:47] feel funny amen
[57:48] let it build a wet body amen
[57:51] but the Canopus infidel he's
[57:54] the one who and Jos forever amen
[57:56] Walmart is just Walmart is a corporate
[57:58] amen this one belong to the earth no
[58:01] matter how much you paint it no matter
[58:03] how much you polish it out the beautiful
[58:05] clothes the best food you eat is so
[58:08] going back to be negative go back to the
[58:09] earth glory hallelujah praise be to God
[58:13] oh man let's finish up set put put us
[58:16] back in the few funny we come from it is
[58:19] death to develop the picture now death
[58:21] has got to portion we look at death as
[58:23] somebody who dies naturally which is
[58:25] good is great but death is the new birth
[58:28] is killing the old nature the old man or
[58:32] the old woman the negative side that
[58:35] gives the contrast because we are all
[58:36] born in sin besides Adam his wife incest
[58:40] Adam and Jesus Christ all the rest of
[58:42] mankind were born through man and woman
[58:45] no Paul I think a Jew said that a man
[58:48] born of humanness is full of trouble but
[58:50] few days so the one that came through a
[58:53] woman and a man is full of trouble you
[58:56] can get sick when a child is born it
[58:58] doesn't take long
[58:59] the first and the charr does is cry do
[59:01] you cry when you are happy why does a
[59:03] baby cry when it's born
[59:04] because it's full of trouble it breathes
[59:07] its own oxygen it doesn't take long
[59:10] I begin to remain teeth and then fever
[59:13] so the trouble begins even worse in a
[59:16] childhood so you can put your trust on
[59:18] that you can put your trust in the
[59:20] eternal body

[1:01:15] this make it as murky Sadiq 6 5 or 2 2
[1:01:18] and E so now we are getting we're making
[1:01:21] Sadek remember I said I was a man one
[1:01:24] time Abraham was promised to have a
[1:01:25] child with his wife and Sarah for 25
[1:01:29] years one day he was sitting there
[1:01:31] thinking about himself and three men
[1:01:33] just appeared three ordinary men they
[1:01:35] were not angels with wings to know the
[1:01:36] way he mam among human beings but then
[1:01:40] Abraham had something in him that was
[1:01:42] able to detect so he saw that this is
[1:01:45] not just ordinary people who live in
[1:01:47] another village and came to visit me he
[1:01:49] saw that this is Christ himself this is
[1:01:51] the Almighty God Elohim Jehovah so
[1:01:54] Abraham began to talk to Jehovah give up
[1:01:55] beginning to talk to Abraham and Sarah
[1:01:57] ham can I hide anything from you guess
[1:02:01] what he was going to destroy Sodom and
[1:02:03] Gomorrah
[1:02:03] but because Abraham receive believed he
[1:02:07] became him so God could not do nothing
[1:02:10] but to declare to Abraham to the Prophet
[1:02:13] amen Karuna virus is going on the whole
[1:02:16] world is shut down a lockdown but you
[1:02:18] God won't do nothing until he declares
[1:02:21] it to you because you have accepted his
[1:02:24] word you become part of him you I 10 I
[1:02:26] had feel funny you receive their way to
[1:02:29] be born by the word of the Lord Amen so
[1:02:32] you don't get distress about death
[1:02:34] because they developed if it makes you
[1:02:36] more real amen
[1:02:38] glory hallelujah so may kiss a deck
[1:02:40] appear to Abraham in a human body and
[1:02:43] talked to Abraham and he sent two
[1:02:45] messengers to Sodom and Gomorrah and
[1:02:47] then we begin to for for their promise
[1:02:48] by talking to Abraham Abraham didn't
[1:02:51] know he was conversing with Ibrahim
[1:02:52] telling him what he's gonna do BrahMos
[1:02:53] pleading for the people of Montgomery
[1:02:55] because his nephew lot was there just
[1:02:57] like this time everybody's crying for
[1:02:59] their loved ones because we don't know
[1:03:01] what's going to happen is the whole
[1:03:02] population going to be wiped from the
[1:03:04] earth with coronavirus when we have our
[1:03:06] loved ones who are not saved so that's
[1:03:09] why God is calling you before that this
[1:03:11] is a time you don't have time God is
[1:03:14] just giving us just a minor what we are
[1:03:16] seeing now is just a minor when you look
[1:03:18] at things that I go to unfold on this
[1:03:20] earth because this earth has got an
[1:03:22] owner God is going to harvest the earth

[1:03:27] last time he's going to is going to have

[1:03:54] by thoughts
[1:03:55] God doesn't have to have Mason to create
[1:03:58] a house by thoughts he creative an earth
[1:04:01] and the few funny move into into the
[1:04:04] earthly body and appear just like
[1:04:06] brother Simba like a human be just about
[1:04:08] a Garen and I appear to Abraham
[1:04:10] communing with Abraham toward him what
[1:04:12] he's about to do on earth and then when
[1:04:15] I had to do his commission but then
[1:04:17] Abram was changed just by meeting my
[1:04:20] cathodic the next Abram was real he woke
[1:04:23] up as a young man of eighteen twenty
[1:04:25] years his wife woke up was 90 years
[1:04:27] Abram was hundred years already and he
[1:04:30] realized his change is like what's going
[1:04:32] on here I look like a 20 year old young
[1:04:35] man he's right up the same thing I'm

[1:09:05] later formed into flesh Jesus from what
[1:09:09] from the grid beginning spirit the
[1:09:12] Spirit then came down to the word
[1:09:14] bringing itself out the way doesn't yet
[1:09:16] make itself the word doesn't yet make
[1:09:20] itself it's just booked out and Murphy

[1:10:54] Christ he was tempted by the devil
[1:10:56] through his mind through human beings

[1:11:01] all of them because the thief he came
[1:11:03] through a few funny by you and I didn't
[1:11:05] come through at you funny face we bypass
[1:11:07] it we had a few funny but we had to
[1:11:10] BiPAP bypass it to be tented of sin not
[1:11:13] always to be born in sin and because we
[1:11:15] were born in sin we couldn't overcome
[1:11:17] like Jesus so he has to come and die and
[1:11:20] what we bypass restored that bypass onto
[1:11:24] us
[1:11:24] amen that feel funny was there your
[1:11:27] eternal body was there before the
[1:11:29] foundation of the world you were a
[1:11:30] daughter of God before you were brought
[1:11:32] forth by your great-great grand
[1:11:34] grandparents but then you didn't come
[1:11:36] through the line you came through the
[1:11:37] flesh form so that you be born in sin
[1:11:40] listen this death this sickness take
[1:11:44] persecutions and different things in the
[1:11:46] earth then when that a lot of time you
[1:11:49] hear the word of God the wedge transform
[1:11:51] your heart consume the old person
[1:11:53] destroy the old man do away with the
[1:11:55] devil who was leading you in the wilson

[1:12:14] we are not using we see using the flesh
[1:12:18] just like you have you have to come by
[1:12:20] yourself to go out it doesn't mean you
[1:12:22] are not in your clothes
[1:12:23] amen we have to cover Soph in the
[1:13:04] liquefier is the same liquefier and
[1:13:08] liquefier is what what can consume satan
[1:13:12] can any natural fire consume the devil
[1:13:15] the devil says spirit demons are spirit
[1:13:18] demon of death HIV sickness confusion
[1:13:23] robbery
[1:13:24] the aspirin your demons their life form
[1:13:27] and natural fire cannot consume them so
[1:13:30] what can consume them it is the Holy
[1:13:32] Spirit but when the holy sprit is
[1:13:34] concerned it consuming them in the form
[1:13:35] of judgment we call it the lake of fire
[1:13:37] not a physical fire lake that you put
[1:13:40] people in to be consumed but is the holy
[1:13:42] similarly goes that give you the new
[1:13:44] birth that consume Ison the simile goes
[1:13:47] because Satan cannot repent you continue
[1:13:49] to do more evil and evil and his weapons
[1:13:52] onto the finally got a lotta for them to
[1:13:54] consume them completely out of the earth
[1:13:56] amen recently I was stood in a cancer
[1:14:00] medication and one of my professors said
[1:14:02] that she's a cancer specialist and she
[1:14:05] said I did some research on lymphoma
[1:14:06] type of cancer and the cells when you
[1:14:09] observe assess on a micro microscope you
[1:14:12] see eyes two eyes like the eyes of a
[1:14:14] beam under the microscope staring at you
[1:14:17] how can it be it's a life form can size
[1:14:20] a crab is a demon and live from that
[1:14:23] take your life and destroy your natural
[1:14:25] life forces your body to multiply and
[1:14:27] produce abnormal cells and the a demonic
[1:14:30] life-form and now this surely I'm under
[1:14:32] the microscope like eyes watching you
[1:14:35] who can can you so what does medicine do
[1:14:37] medicine try to treat a symptom try to
[1:14:40] correct the breaking of the cells but
[1:14:42] medicine cannot cut that demons that are
[1:14:44] staring from the microscope but the
[1:14:46] pillar of fire the holy goose
[1:14:47] Jesus Christ alternate II can consume
[1:14:51] them and destroy the cancer out of a
[1:14:53] person and set up a sin free amen
[1:14:56] and that is the power that you have God
[1:14:58] has given to you amen you may not have
[1:15:01] all the money on the planet but God has
[1:15:02] put something in you is greater than
[1:15:04] their every power on this planet amen
[1:15:07] greater than a politcal powers greater
[1:15:09] than sickness that you can speak and
[1:15:11] notice demonic life-form will be
[1:15:14] destroyed amen praise God hallelujah
[1:15:17] when Jesus was here he cast demons from
[1:15:19] people but now we are even going beyond
[1:15:22] casting demons he casts demons into the
[1:15:24] sea if you cut him into a sea we drink
[1:15:26] we take we use fish from the sea is that
[1:15:28] right if you cast them out they look for
[1:15:31] another vessel to enter them in but
[1:15:33] consume them let the Holy Ghost in you
[1:15:34] consume those demon because the judgment
[1:15:36] of God has began in the house of God so
[1:15:38] if you see the devil in your loved ones
[1:15:40] in somebody that you love smoking their
[1:15:43] life's out this trendy alliance with
[1:15:45] cigarette and cancer you have got a
[1:15:47] power and authority to speed a life amen
[1:15:50] to destroy that cancer from them to
[1:15:53] destroy that demon from them to bring
[1:15:56] them on to Christ so that the Holy Ghost
[1:15:57] in them will be activated amen
[1:16:00] the few funny be activated because you
[1:16:02] have got Holy Ghost in action they don't
[1:16:04] have the Holy Ghost in action they have
[1:16:05] in a seed form and the seed need water
[1:16:08] and sunlight and oxygen and add to or
[1:16:11] germinate and what it needs the salad is
[1:16:14] in your heart the oxygen is in your
[1:16:16] heart and when you speak you listen
[1:16:18] origin into your life one into your
[1:16:21] loved ones you release the sunlight into
[1:16:23] your life ones don't worry if it doesn't
[1:16:25] jam it right away
[1:16:26] amen when planted see when you plant a
[1:16:32] seed on the ground you don't plant a
[1:16:35] seed and go and come just a nest in see
[1:16:38] where's my seat no don't do that way the
[1:16:40] seed us is a law of nature
[1:16:41] you just keep importing the water point
[1:16:44] the organic fertilizer whatever sunlight
[1:16:47] water sunlight and then it's going to
[1:16:49] take his time there's a law in nature

[1:19:55] persecute me route to Jerusalem is a
[1:19:58] lord who are now said I'm Jesus whom you
[1:20:01] persecute so with Jesus the Christians
[1:20:05] that Saul of Tarsus was persecuting he

[1:23:11] have following you are not a basketball
[1:23:14] star you are not a politician if a
[1:23:17] position is going to have a lot of
[1:23:17] following but you are not ordained for
[1:23:19] that purpose you are ordained for
[1:23:21] greater than Solomon is here amen you
[1:23:25] are greater than even Elizabeth and
[1:23:27] Esther amen you are under a much higher
[1:23:30] covenant than even the Old Testament in
[1:23:33] the New Testament because they are which
[1:23:35] known you once returned Hebrews I think
[1:23:38] 13 12 someway said there's a cloud of
[1:23:40] witness the cloud of witness I can a
[1:23:43] claw be a witness does a cloud does it
[1:23:47] have a nice it's not a cloud is a
[1:23:49] symbolic weight somewhat symbolic word
[1:23:51] it's too funny all this sin that I've
[1:23:54] gone before
[1:23:54] the gospel that the Lord has given to
[1:23:56] you it's a much higher gospel than what
[1:23:59] to give it to them
[1:24:00] so our gospel that we preach here is
[1:24:02] bringing them to that level amen
[1:24:05] just like the Old Testament Saints the
[1:24:07] Lord used a mighty great prophet of God
[1:24:08] but then without the blood of Jesus
[1:24:10] credited in experience the death of
[1:24:13] Jesus Christ they didn't experience
[1:24:15] Kaveri they had the same few funny the
[1:24:16] same Holy Ghost in their form but they
[1:24:19] didn't experience the death of Jesus
[1:24:20] Christ so they were not born again like
[1:24:22] you and I were born again
[1:24:23] so David a prophet King and priest can
[1:24:27] go take shower or look at somebody's
[1:24:30] wife taking shower and go to commit
[1:24:32] adultery with with with with her and
[1:24:34] marry Hey

[1:24:38] a born again but when you are born again
[1:24:40] posted that their life that I live is no
[1:24:42] longer mine his friend couldn't live the
[1:24:45] life when he was so he was killing
[1:24:46] Christians but when Jesus cried took
[1:24:48] over
[1:24:49] he wasn't Saul of Tarsus no more he
[1:24:52] became a simple pole and they're full of
[1:24:54] the fire of God amen sins of the world
[1:24:57] was not part of his mind things of
[1:24:59] Christ was always mine there was a woman
[1:25:01] who was a prostitute Mary Magdalene he
[1:25:05] had seven demons also Jesus cast him in
[1:25:07] the most out of Fame when she was
[1:25:09] transformed when that demons of
[1:25:11] fornication adultery and avoid
[1:25:14] disrespect alway cast from her and then
[1:25:17] the Holy Goose Jesus Christ live in
[1:25:19] heaven he he resurrected she was a first
[1:25:21] person Jesus Christ reveal himself to
[1:25:23] you because before the foundation of the
[1:25:25] world she wasn't a prostitute she was a
[1:25:27] daughter of God she went through that
[1:25:29] line just to have an SP I have a
[1:25:31] contrast amen and a lot brought it to
[1:25:34] the other side the negatively body to
[1:25:35] the positive to manifest amen the
[1:25:39] bubbles are no adultery no fornicator no
[1:25:41] Lyle good economic good enter the
[1:25:44] kingdom of God
[1:25:45] yes desperate cannot enter but the
[1:25:48] person that the devil use w's wasn't
[1:25:52] desperate of adultery amen Mary
[1:25:54] Magdalene was a child of God a daughter
[1:25:56] of God so this as Christ came to cleanse
[1:25:59] say to transform it to redeem redeem
[1:26:01] means to bring back to where she was
[1:26:03] because she had at you funny before the
[1:26:05] foundation of the world and so God
[1:26:07] forgive
[1:26:07] and transform your life and MIT is sent
[1:26:10] out of it
[1:26:10] amen but then God after the death he
[1:26:13] give us a higher covenant he started a
[1:26:15] church two thousand years seven Church
[1:26:17] ages run through seven Church ages and
[1:26:19] then brought you an eye after the seven
[1:26:23] Church ages Amen we didn't live to see

[1:26:26] about the children said that God send
[1:26:29] the messengers and the end of the age to
[1:26:31] close the age but we came at a node at
[1:26:33] the end of the age we were the sons and
[1:26:37] daughters of God we were born but from
[1:26:39] the mouth of Elohim amen

[1:26:54] bringing eternity into manifestation and
[1:26:57] when the more God we get to know who we
[1:26:59] are our responsibilities on earth and
[1:27:02] the more we lead our soft winds like I

[1:30:00] heavenly family the few funnies the
[1:30:04] angels the another glory they are sons
[1:30:08] of God dear part of God but they are not
[1:30:10] part of godless if you take the Angels

[1:34:41] I mean a mama when we have to serve the
[1:34:43] Lord here when you go through a little
[1:34:45] persecution and trials when you are
[1:34:47] working on blue grasses for eternity

[1:35:16] already and when you speak believe it it
[1:35:20] will come to pass
[1:35:20] don't look at what you see what you see
[1:35:23] will limit your mind for you to UM be to
[1:35:25] disbelieve the Lord but if that you do
[1:35:28] even see the Lord has ordained you to
[1:35:30] use your faith that's why allow
[1:35:32] challenges in your life
[1:35:33] big hardships in your life so that the
[1:35:36] attribute will become manifested who had
[1:35:39] challenges that Jesus Christ he had
[1:35:41] prescriptions all around him the our
[1:35:43] limitation reporte he came to receive
[1:35:45] they spat upon him they call invisible
[1:35:48] but it didn't admit attribute to shine
[1:35:50] there's something even Jesus in his
[1:35:52] human form he cries a lot he cried to
[1:35:55] the holy go see him if the over lettuce
[1:35:57] cup pass over me because I the human
[1:35:59] from your crying on a human form we are

[1:36:31] a foolish virgins a revelation remember
[1:36:35] when Jesus was before he died he told
[1:36:38] the people of Israel that Titus was
[1:36:40] going to persecute them
[1:36:42] so today Christian when they see those
[1:36:44] signs they should leave back hit
[1:36:45] Jerusalem but on the foolish virgins
[1:36:48] when they saw Jerusalem being surrounded
[1:36:50] the truth their candles and the high
[1:36:53] priests and the alarms and they went to
[1:36:55] the temple to pray and shout and speak
[1:36:57] in different things but then those who
[1:36:59] were wise the wise virgin who had oil
[1:37:02] India India condor say hey by Jack
[1:37:05] remember the Lord is this you have a
[1:37:06] quick remember this hmm take your family
[1:37:08] let's leave Jerusalem they left
[1:37:11] and the general titles was Coe back to
[1:37:13] room to go and get more ammunition he
[1:37:15] came back and no entered with more
[1:37:16] demons and then they winter did Sunnah
[1:37:18] the city for a forgotten how many for
[1:37:21] some time so there was no food coming
[1:37:22] into the city nothing is going out or
[1:37:25] for ran out he memories begin to eat the
[1:37:27] our children and they blood they had to
[1:37:31] the kill people to that they are blood
[1:37:33] they had to use no matter what the Bible
[1:37:35] said I'd hold no shoes it's like shoes
[1:37:38] that they put nails on me to be able to
[1:37:39] walk because it was slippery friction
[1:37:41] blood was like a river in the city so
[1:37:45] they have to put metals on the a shoe to
[1:37:47] be able to kill those who are not dead
[1:37:48] yet because they didn't what believe the
[1:37:52] Word of God they didn't receive whom
[1:37:55] they lost send it to them and they
[1:37:57] perish but the Lord has blessed you that

[1:38:04] to you so that you don't perish with the
[1:38:06] world amen

[1:38:17] were not drunkest they were holy men but
[1:38:19] they didn't accept him whom the Lord has
[1:38:22] sent to them disobedience is more than

[1:38:30] wish you know green feel a little
[1:38:32] flickers is nothing the demon can be

[1:41:41] II the absolute love of God to you and
[1:41:43] just had a quote that he just kind of
[1:41:46] share it there to begin I don't think
[1:41:48] I've ever heard that message but never
[1:41:50] pulled that out of you know everything
[1:41:54] no matter how good we got it on this
[1:41:58] side it's still a negative it's still a
[1:42:02] negative and and and and when you look
[1:42:04] at a negative there's got to be a
[1:42:05] positive somewhere else and and and our
[1:42:08] life that we live in here we're pressing
[1:42:10] into that positive right and I can't
[1:42:13] wait to get to the other side and and
[1:42:15] you know a day that they'll come we
[1:42:17] don't have to worry about washing our
[1:42:20] hands everywhere we go and you know and
[1:42:23] being concerned but no masks and all
[1:42:25] that we gotta worry about that where we
[1:42:27] getting ready to go to write that won't
[1:42:29] be an issue so all seem to be going amen
[1:42:32] all sickness or disease and man no more
[1:42:35] hospital visits all of that it'll be
[1:42:38] over with no more funerals to go to so
[1:42:41] we've just we just think the Lord they
[1:42:43] man for for what we're looking for and
[1:42:45] looking I mean looking forward to we
[1:42:47] thank God for it we want to just offer
[1:42:51] word of Prayer some of you all are aware
[1:42:53] of sister Ellie she's coming to visit us
[1:42:56] multiple times from brother Anderson's
[1:43:01] Church a father past early this week and
[1:43:04] we just want to remember that family in
[1:43:07] prayer and believe he was a minister a
[1:43:10] pastor and and they are in the Michigan
[1:43:13] area and just just want to remember them
[1:43:15] in prayer that God would just be with
[1:43:16] them throughout this time a man so let's
[1:43:21] just let's prepare to dismiss now say a
[1:43:24] closing prayer and we'll also remember
[1:43:26] these requests some other things that
[1:43:29] you pray for
[1:43:31] sister brother Nathan's mom she came out
[1:43:34] of the hospital by the grace of God and
[1:43:39] she's back home but we want to continue
[1:43:42] to keep her in prayer to doctors
[1:43:44] diagnosed her with actually stage 4
[1:43:46] cancer and so we want to pray that God
[1:43:49] would just make a man touch her in her
[1:43:52] body and give her a miracle we've seen
[1:43:54] God do it before and we believe God can
[1:43:56] do it again
[1:43:56] cancer is not too hard for God brother
[1:44:00] Tim Pruett he's a pastor there in
[1:44:02] Louisiana just he sent out a requests
[1:44:08] his wife had to go to the hospital
[1:44:10] had some bleeding on the brain and and I
[1:44:12] guess she experienced this a number of
[1:44:14] years ago and and they said it was
[1:44:16] pretty strange because it came back in
[1:44:18] the same spot that uh that it wasn't say
[1:44:22] that typically never happens so they
[1:44:24] know us a devil and brother brother uh
[1:44:26] Quaker tolas hear science can look at
[1:44:29] cancer and see two eyes and brother and
[1:44:33] toes it's just another life that's
[1:44:35] actually coming attack and take your
[1:44:36] life from you but we bind it a man at
[1:44:40] the root a man glory to God just like
[1:44:43] Jesus bound that you know the fig tree
[1:44:46] we bind cancer fig tree dried up cancer
[1:44:49] can dry up so we believe God they may
[1:44:52] still in the miracle work in business so
