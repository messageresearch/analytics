here I'm reminded of a story in the script it was [Music] the profit I mean a bleep was Elijah a man and Ganassi might be a large and gauzy I can't can't remember right now but I remember them the army was coming to get this elijah army was coming against them and gauzy saw this great army out there they said my God my God my God man we are in trouble and but Elijah just kind of sit there he

a wonderful time a man in the Lord I preached on Sunday night and Monday morning the system that was there in those meetings our system our view had a chance to go home and visit her there are signs they've been a daughter and a man and so she was there just at the same time but we just hadn't had a real good fellowship and I was able to just kind of chat a little bit with the boys so it's a real a real blessing and I thank you all for taking a prayer request before we had some miracles a man a few weeks ago that we were shared here in church and so many miracles so I'm system are view this is not too hard for the Lord amen but we thank God just to be back and last night we had a wonderful time brother Isaac Remy the Lord used him in a very special way eighteen year old young man but my God

song something right I I mean our wall up I hadn't even the Sun the first song and they was over there but it was creating an atmosphere they made it so easy they didn't worship it and when the preacher comes it so easy to preach it in church I just say no I'll tell you what hey man I'm not I'm not gonna focus on who was not here I'm a focus on the world see a man everybody I would see it got a blessing right I know you got your blessed I know you did and Saints I tell you what God is good god is fully so amen all we're doing is just walking right into a man what was left here last night we had a we had church we had church that it was real real good real good hey man we just happened to be back again this morning musicians thank y'all thank y'all so much I appreciate you all the specials that was boring I want you to just grab your Bibles real quick and and I'll read a scripture you know there was there was a couple things that have been in my spirit but I felt that I should go one particular way and with the way the service has gone today I have a feeling that I'll maybe go so far and then have to come back a man and share more there's a couple things that are in my heart a couple of things you know let's see here let's see here I need to do something and I actually Lord God just please help us lord help us god help us Lord Jesus Navas God Elvis look III need to do something a man I think I just need to do this I won't preach from this scripture but I [Music] will I need to do something here with this and and and y'all can y'all can take a seat just for a little bit I'm gonna do something I just kind of felt the Lord just puttin in my spirit that we needed to carriages hulls eight-man and and I want us to look at a scripture and and I actually I will not preach from this today this is the scripture that I will be preaching from in a few weeks amen but I wanted to bring it just to you real quick if I could just find it [Music] notice in first John let me just find it here okay yes if we could just put this on the screen now before we get this on the screen I want you all a man if you have a sheet of paper I want you to take it out I want you to just write something on it and if you don't have a sheet of paper a man this is a time that I am going to permit you to pull out your cell phone and just make a note they men on your cell phone amen but I need to hit this and then and then we'll try to go forward amen this is out of first John chapter 2 and verse 15 first John chapter 2 and verse 15 and I want us to read this and then I want you to just I want to just take a few minutes I just want you to think about what the scripture means to you and man what it means to you the Bible declares love not the world neither the things that are in the world If any man love the world the love of the father is not in him and I just want you to just take a few moments a man and just process that and just think about okay what is that saying you what are what are the things of the world what what what it says love not the world what does that say to you what does that say to you just making a few notes and man to yourself a man a few notes to yourself in your own private place on the list you to paper and your cell phone whatever what does that mean to you and love not the world neither the things that are in the world If any man love the world the love of the father is not in him hey man just take a moment so they may reflect on that [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] praise the Lord you don't have anything but now I want you to take that scripture just throughout the week I want you to just reflect on it I'll be preaching on that in the rule if I don't come to it next week the week after but I'll you know I'll get to that soon but I just want to stop and just just have you meditate on them and and also if if by chance you like man they just you know there's so much the music or next door can hear you know you'd have to be able to get yourself into a channel yes right the Prophet was able to get into the channel where he did hear what was going on around him right he just was really time into what God was doing and and and you have to be able to get into the channel some time like you know I can't hear anything that's just I'm not listening to it but I'm focusing on what the Spirit of God is trying to say that has mental even right now and then that scripture oh it should mean something everybody love not the world nor the things of the world right because if we do it in the love of God is not in us so amen let's uh let's just i'ma leave that there I want to turn to Genesis a man 15 amen Genesis 15 and God help us here today a man reading here verse 13 a man and now acts that you all stand with me on this one will read this and we'll we'll go in term of thought a man today Genesis 15 verse 13 it says and they said unto Abram know of a surety that I seed shall be a stranger than lay in a land that is not theirs and shall serve them and they shall afflict them 400 years and it says and also that nation whom they shall serve will I judge and afterward shall they come out with great substance and thou shalt go to that fathers in peace thou shalt be buried in a good old age but in the fourth generation they shall come hit again for the iniquity of the Emma rights is not yet for a man the iniquity of the EM race is not yet for turn with me to Psalm 24 may bear Psalm 24 already God you know in the world whatever sport you follow if your team was doing real good maybe there was a comeback they would lose them they come back home but they didn't actually win right but they've tied the game and if they tied a game at the end of the game what happens and if your team was losing you get pretty excited that your team actually made it to overtime and I'm here to tell you that we going overtime same thing today I'm time I get excited all the time 24 the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof the world are they that dwell therein but he had found it upon the Seas and established it upon the flood who shall ascend into the heel of the Lord or who shall stand in his holy place he that hath clean hands and a pure heart who have not lifted up his soul unto vanity nor sworn deceitfully he shall receive the blessing from the Lord and righteousness from the god of his salvation this is the generation of them that seek Him that seek thy face o Jacobs Salam lift up your heads o ye gates em be lifted up ye everlasting doors and the King of glory shall come in who is this King of glory the Lord strong and mighty the Lord mighty in battle lift up your hands on your gate seat lift them up ye everlasting doors and the King of glory shall come in who is this King of glory the Lord of Hosts he is the king of glory Salaam they've been the lord of the Blessed - reading it was word father we thank you for the ability to read but we know it takes the Holy Spirit to bring clarity to what we've read speaks our heart Scott through your word today since Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you you can be seen it once again and we take every spirit that's against the Spirit of God underneath the control of the Holy Spirit even right now a man I want to just take for our subjected a fourth-generation believers a man I've mentioned to all a few weeks ago that I wanted to talk on this subject and and I want to just kind of hit this a man if I can today let me start off by a man just making a couple of statements and the first quote that I'm going to read a man is God commissioning Moses and then that he swore by himself and this in this message God commissioning Moses the Prophet says I heard a fellow saying the other day that sickness the Lord did sickness he says put sickness on you that might be so if you were sinning okay so the Lord might allow sickness to come upon you if you're sinning a man you've done something wrong make it right with God that's right that's true but sickness is of the devil a man that sickness is an attribute of sin because of sin we had sickness not because maybe you sinned but but but it's something that come down through the generations I want you to catch that a man you can actually be going through a sickness you all remember the story of Jesus a man and the man that was blind and how Jesus I was approached by the disciples said now now is it because this man sinner because it's very searing rise demanded conditions and what evidently they were saying it's not normal for us to be sick right it's not it's not something that we should just accept and then innocent devil that's attacking us so why is the message in say everyone because it was its parents it wasn't because of anything he did but it's because the glory of God wanted to be expressed right so so sometimes things happen and God just wants to show us glory but sometimes it happened it's because of a scene right all right now look at this says not because maybe you sinned but but it's something that come down through the generations he visited even the third and fourth generation but the blood of Jesus Christ taken away sin and it'll take away sickness I like that amen we that meets with that statement we don't have to accept things just because they come down through generations man amen you know sometimes it's a it's a generational curse no the devil is alive amen I'm not accepting it hallelujah just because it pass to my family in the past right on by me because I'm underneath the blood of the Lord cheese right right the death date rapid passed by them that were underneath the blood and if you are under the blood today that death things you have to pay right back you don't accept it when you know there's nothing wrong in your life listen the Bible actually says this stuff going on I'm gonna stop there amen the Bible says in Exodus 20 and verse 5 it made a statement says thou shall not bow down thyself to them nor serve them for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God visiting the iniquity of the father's upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me now I want you to I want you to just kind of catch this because you know as brother branham just said in that quote you know sometimes things do get passed down from generation I want you to kind of catch this each one of us here have the have the ability to make decisions that will impact future generations things that you do right now will actually impact future generations hallelujah Amana I want you to just think about that Oh glory to God you know sometimes there are certain things that hit a particular family a man and you wonder why everybody everybody did that where everybody went that way you know I can I can just talk about my whole family a matter how I went back and just kind of you know sometimes you start talking to you and you start getting different things different pieces you start putting together and come to find out that all in my family line there was a lot of men that come before me that were womanizers a man they went from one woman to the next woman to the next woman and you weren't you to wonder why is that well you know why was that happened or why does this get the same spirit on him it came down from his daddy from his granddaddy from his great granddaddy and you start wondering what what is it that what is it that that breaks that well I got good news way hey man the power of the Holy Ghost can break that right and in action and power Holy Ghost take that excuse from yes the powder Holy Ghost actually called you to be different than what they are see that was something natural that came down a man from a natural father but to have my Heavenly Father who has something spiritual to break down to you hallelujah you know sometimes in families like you could have from a woman's perspective hey baby you might have in the family maybe a woman that get pregnant out of wedlock right and then just this happened in this with this happen and that wouldn't happen to do but I tell you what when you get underneath the power of the Holy Ghost let us stop that thing from happening in your generation oh come on somebody see we have the opportunity amen in this present time to make decisions that will impact the future hallelujah that's why I read the scripture this is the generation that seeks I'm not accepting what came down in my I'm gonna accept what came down from heaven that's what breaks that generational curse come on somebody let me just read something here to you this is not a he swore box of watch this the Prophet says well what what is the head of all what is the head of all this cause that we're here this morning says what's the the head of all of it what made all this sickness is sin and disgrace it was sin see before you had in the sin sickness is an attribute of something that that follows sin if you don't have in other words it's something that come out of sin see before there was any sin there was no sickness or nothing no worry no nothing no old age no breaking down no heartaches no broken homes no nothing see it was just perfect well what caused it was sin yes I in whether their sickness false in broken homes attributes come or Olympics and all those things followed sin now if your kills if you kill sin yes I like that if you kill see right you've got to kill the attributes hallelujah if sin is gone then you watch to these other things being managed right but if you start seeing all those other things that you have not died to that old sin nature that's why you need to be born again that's why you need the baptism Holy Ghost that's what gives you power to overcome let's see in nature yes sir listen he goes on to say that she says says if you kill sin you gotta kill the attributes haven't you you can't touch you can't fool with sin unless you're fooling with this and when you fool in this it results in sin see now if you kill sin then you kill the whole thing yes sir now you say sickness sometimes you may have sick you say did I see him oh might not have been you sin but you remember the sicknesses visit that nick words are the upon the children and the children's children and their children all to the third and fourth generation now I'm lying on all this stuff because you know there are things that are happening in the fourth generation but the fourth generation needs to understand that some of it started in generations before you you just feeling the impact right on what happened years ago yes things that you might not even know about that was in your granddaddy's like in your grandmother's life they may need your great-grandma I was like yeah thing that I mean gee I mean the Bible said it will come to the third of fourth generation say so the manifestation of it don't happen till it get to you right you wonder what in the world is this something that was not dealt with years ago right just be honest you don't have any family secrets are still a secret I'm a Therese hold on just for a second me I'm talking somebody recently there was talk about how you know something happened in the family i'ma just have to be honest God our Lord Jesus come on preach but by incest happened in the family uh-huh occurred in this family and the thing was hidden for years yeah actually never actually came to fruition nobody I mean they was trying to keep this thing down right to the people went to the Greek right right but they don't realize that to me yes that's it blocks God removing in that Pam that steam action will eventually fete effect children tears tears down the road you thought you did it the nice nice in this problem rise up a men in this family wonder what happened here they don't realize they act to fulfill it what what happened in generations before them yes understand you know all hell has been loose to get y'all right but it's not it's not I mean look ya'll just get started in this thing all right but these things that happened before you got here but if you can understand Amen if these things happen before you got here what its gonna take it's not you going back to try to dig up everybody's past that's not what's gonna help you overcome you sure I need to know why my granddaddy I need to know why my grandma only the Holy Ghost if no granddaddy had the Holy Ghost and the did what he did it's no grandma had the Holy Ghost she did what she did but she didn't have the opportunity to hear the truth that Junia so all you got to do the Brit - it's a Polish work and when you receive it guess what the generations after you will be impacted positive good preacher sometimes you don't realize what you're facing but the lead inhale was taken off that's right that's right and all hail does come against yeah that's right that's right oh yeah let's come again yes brother branham tells us that when all hell breaks loose how about that we should also be watching ball heaven let me go on a little further in this quote I want you to see this might not have been you said in CC I have to put it this way because now I'm talking fourth generation believers yeah but I'm taking it only from a certain point yes come on you understand I'm only taking it from a certain point because everybody in here is in a racial from somebody right I'm fourth generation I can go back in my from my natural father and his father and his grandfather and hearing about all these you know these these things woman I said man right you know great granddaddy you know run around he spoke be a doctor to town where at times you a doctor right you you got a position oppressed each sorry to possess the prestige you can do all kind of stuff you know this doctor set him up brought him to the audition you know and it's it the nurse on room uh-huh but brothers and offices cetera he's using his position of power and influence to do something all right right Amen but by hearing here my family I'm seeing it I'm hearing about this doctor that's just going around he got kids from everybody but because he's a doctor he can do that kind of stuff right and yeah you wanna why that spirit a man just kind of keep coming in and attacking and just attacking not now can I say something even with the Holy Ghost right right come on right if even with the Holy Ghost hallelujah uh-huh Amen don't mean that the devil won't try you this way a greater reward for the Deaf is that actually get somebody in the phone that's got the Holy Ghost that's a greater prize for the tip when you actually go on the greater trials when you get the Holy Ghost but because God don't want to be outdone he allows the Holy Ghost to become your keeper so when the devil is trying your healing trying it out the devil Bobby I mean he never said yeah do this do that yet but God would be your know on the inside I know you better get out of this situation quick huh because God don't wanna keep you over to the devil like that also realize when you when you make the decision you say yes to it you are setting yourself up Amen for greater things in future generations in that fourth generation you won't live you won't be living the seal but the fourth generation that's coming from you what type of trouble where they have because of what you did you better bring it under the blood yeah can I just want to finish this point I'm trying let me let me let me get here let me get here all right it says how did I say no oh might not have been you said but you remember the sickness is visited up the nick words of the parents upon the children children's children and their children all to the third and fourth generation see and it's just the wearing down wearing out of the human bodies and sin piling up and so forth like venero and so forth it visits on down now watch this here's some time ago a famous doctor here had two girls that they took in and examined they was going blind who says they found out venereal disease just as clean and moral little latest as they could be never Lewis this they got a venereal disease but brother branham say they live it clean and moral don't mind my they go on blind from a venereal disease but they living clean and Morrow they not run around with folks these are girls that are living clean and they're

their blood tests and there it was and they checked it back it was their great-great-grandfather see there you come my Sarah my turn to get you to see something you can't even talk to your great granddaddy don't know what happened in this life that's why you're gonna need the Baptist or Holy Ghost that's what bracele but then when they traced it back they found it was their great-grandfather see that there you come now see it comes down through the generation that breaks down well then when you're dealing with sin you're dealing with sickness at the same time that's how powerful that thing worth of a mural disease something that the granddaddy actually he received from something that he did yeah that thing came down yep two races yes ma'am got all the way down to these these kids and either y'all with a clean life all right dealing with Meniere's disease that's cause i'ma go that's how powerless they get when it gets down to that fourth generation yes sir I want you to see

boys and things like that little boys little girls living in adultery we live in a society where teachers [Music] [Music] take your time take your time work with blue boards things like that what kind of generations coming up after this what makes these little girls act like that there mama it was a real mama you would be doing stuff like this was a flapper follow their grand maddening my grandmama can see that's what I was trying to show you here is that's something happen with Grandma yeah that may hug grant mammy yeah something happened with ground I mean when I so tell you look around you see grandmother's yeah right drinking motive anybody else in fact the younger children sleep with them grandma should have changed my mom should have stopped sinning years ago got my cursed moaning the kid yes look I gotta look for free go to grunt my house grandma trying to get the boy free man you preaching the truth I'm a granddaughter you see that spirit on your grandma but watch that spirit yes because it pass generation to generation and it might be and you might have just laughing and giggling that grandma right now but one day you go get grandma and I hope you stay grandma and don't become grand man what makes these look girls act like that their banner was a flapper that grandmammy was a chorus girl and he said he visit the iniquity of the parents upon the children children's children to the third and fourth generation what can't what can you expect anymore thank you know y'all look at that if I gonna be laughing but soon some sisters might know but brother's don't know what these terms mean yeah I got it it's a 1920 turn yeah [Music] enjoy fine don't just look tell you everything when I looked in her eyes I can see she had that wild stick what that means is that she will not stay home and take care of shoes she'll be in the boss yes sir Sakurako take care of you oh and that's good preacher but she was fine that's what you've been a little too character alright that's it hey man character let me also just go a little further Holy Ghost you better know for sure that they got the Holy Ghost ha ha yes amen okay right but see you know so so sorry but you know here here know this flapper is a is a term p19 Twitter so what we almost found out almost almost 100 years ago that's where that term came out hundred years ago laughs and brother Branham says it was a fast wheel and I just know y'all excuse me what was a fashionable young woman looking like in things between [Music] compared to what a fashionable young woman look like today but they don't even thinking we're paying shipping Swiss they won't even want to advance it right so what did this that's what y'all want to have to look like in order for her to be considered a flapper sometimes it's not just the look on the outside but this also look on the inside the Thomas a man it's a woman that's intent on enjoying herself and flouting conventional status okay now you know if there's some Instagram post that I look at and I can just put on there you intent on enjoying yourself not thinking about the consequences when you make a decision if you do not marry you make a decision your decision is gonna impact your family yes my girl's gonna work they not married they go out and do something hey man it reflects back on me they reflect some mama it reflects on the household yeah now when you get married we're not going down do something guess who reflects on my life right it also reflect on my kids so when I do things it's not just me that's concerned it's how I'm gonna impact others what is it gonna make them look like what will my love my wife when my wife's yep enough I thought if I make this decision but I'll do this I'll do that how is that gonna make my husband look here brother everybody see we gotta watch this this is this is very very important yeah alright so so so you know flapper is disturbed from the nineteen twenties now I don't know where chorus girl with I don't know when that came but I know that if the flapper was the first generation the choral chorus girl was the second generation and what brother I'm sorry when he called him say see you know your your mammy was a flat but grandmammy was a chorus girl I guess of course they're listening right okay chorus girl must have been first-generation flapper would have been second generation so that became in the 1920s Corsica chorus girl I don't know when they can mm-hmm but what I found out is that a chorus girl it's this one who is a woman who sings or dances in the course of a musical can I say that again a woman who sings or dances in the course of a musical come on let's see now we watched musicals and we see women dancing and we don't think nothing of it today it don't move us like that but a hundred years ago that was me but now the fourth generation we since it's a desensitized to it just don't mean nothing and this is why I was saying you know early y'all just bear with me you know what I'm gonna come home right in here just kind of bring something to your attention if a hundred years ago this was not looked at but now it's just so accepted remember I came to y'all a few weeks ago I say I'm seeing stuff in this full generation that I want another song right in my day we didn't even think about going to a wedding and having a first dance right that's right right that's right that's right that's right yes so far we even came to the message hello holiness in us being that we wouldn't even thought about no dancing that no reception come on dancing and my way we can even have an outside new session I passed a kept that thing tight we can even I mean we don't know what kind of spirits they break in here couldn't even have an outside musician [Laughter] lives without that comes in the fourth generation right but it didn't start there that rebellion started in a generation before you know things that happen not gibberish we rise up and say well when I get when I I'm not going to see and all you're doing is set yourself up from Oh devil Gaga something that he's put in play that's right past the guy he see understand I understand some come on yeah God put him right up on this town that's right on the wall uh-huh so here you see things that you kicked some ass right that's right come on down the Seas right come on that's that's his job just be some tips remain humble come on and this will kill kill kill I trust if you can't trust your pastor right we not playing games but but see I'm trying to get you see their spears that come from generation to generation then they get down here we start to see manifestation of things that lord have mercy and it only comes out in four generations right I'm done I'm gonna walk you through subscriptions they're all things that have been human birth to the rich not much and broker gave me one yes no Pam ha ha ha ha Nimrod [Music] what happened in that fourth generation man come on can I give me another will Moses Joshua uh-huh the generations that died in the wilderness right judges [Music] what happened in judges really yeah every man did what was right in their own lands his own that happened in the fourth generation but it didn't start there it started way back remember Joshua had a problem say to choose this day see they was making back this ditches well before that fortune Rachel came home and all that happened because they made bad decisions in effect generations later that's why I want to get you a stuff to think stop making bad decisions let the Holy Ghost lead you and guide you and direct you do what's pleasing to God [Music] what message he'll believe I mean I can I can just get pulled out the coat after coat after coat now you remember because you know
