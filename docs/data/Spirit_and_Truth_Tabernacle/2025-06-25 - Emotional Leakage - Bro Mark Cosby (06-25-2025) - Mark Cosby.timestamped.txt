[8:10] to give you all the glory, honor, and
[8:11] praise. Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[8:13] Amen. Amen. Amen. So the title for
[8:16] tonight is emotional leakage. I know I
[8:19] know it's a
[8:21] interesting title, but
[8:25] so we'll uh we'll turn to 2 Samuel um
[8:29] 11:es
[8:31] 1-15.
[8:32] 2 Samuel 11. Very familiar scripture
[8:36] here um
[8:38] as we get to recognize it.
[8:44] All right. So, we'll start in verse one.
[8:46] So, very familiar. This is uh when David
[8:48] had his great sin.
[8:50] And it came to pass after the year was
[8:52] expired at the time when the kings go
[8:54] forth to battle that David sent Joab his
[8:57] servants with him and all of Israel. And
[8:59] they destroyed the children of Ammon and
[9:01] besieged Rabbath. But David tried still
[9:03] at Jerusalem. So, right there we see a
[9:05] little red flag. Um because the Bible
[9:08] says right there to begin that the kings
[9:10] would go forth into battle. But we see
[9:12] David stayed back. And when David stayed
[9:15] back, we'll see what what transpires.
[9:18] And and it came to pass in the evening
[9:20] time that David arose from off his bed
[9:22] and walked into the roof of the king's
[9:23] house. And from the roof he saw a woman
[9:25] washing herself. And the woman was very
[9:27] beautiful to look upon. And David sent
[9:30] an inquir of the woman. And one said,
[9:32] "Is not this Basheba, the daughter of
[9:34] Elm, the wife of Uriah the Hitittite?
[9:36] And David sent messengers and took her,
[9:38] and she came into him, and lay with her,
[9:39] for she was purified from her uncle in
[9:41] cleanliness. And she returned unto her
[9:43] house. And the woman conceived and sent
[9:45] and told David, and said, I am with
[9:47] child. And David sent uh to Job, saying,
[9:49] "Send me Uriah the highite." And Job
[9:51] sent Uriah to David. Uh when Ria came
[9:54] unto him, David demanded of him how Job
[9:57] did, and how the people did, and how the
[9:59] war prospered. Just want to stop right
[10:00] here. You guys take your seat, and we'll
[10:02] continue. But um I I just see you see
[10:05] David um got himself into this weird
[10:08] predicament and we see when that
[10:11] happened when he found out that uh she
[10:14] was with child I I I guarantee you his
[10:17] heart dropped his countenance changed
[10:19] and now he was trying to find a way out.
[10:22] Um, but we see this whole this whole uh
[10:25] situation that it could have went a
[10:27] different way if he would have did the
[10:30] right thing and just confessed. But we
[10:33] keep on going. And David said to Uriah,
[10:35] "Go to thy house and wash thy feet." And
[10:37] Uriah departed out of the king's house.
[10:39] And there follow him a mess of meat for
[10:41] the king. So David was trying to set
[10:43] Uriah up to as if he it was his child.
[10:48] Right.
[10:49] But Uriah slept at the floor of the
[10:51] king's house with all the servants of
[10:53] his lord and went not down to his house.
[10:55] I I just love I love Ri Uriah in this in
[10:58] in the Bible because he was a faithful
[11:00] man to Israel, a faithful man to God. He
[11:03] wanted to fight for his lord, for his
[11:05] his his country, right? And when they
[11:07] had told David, saying, "You went not
[11:09] down into his house." David said, "Yeah,
[11:11] camest thou not from that journey? Why
[11:13] then dust thou not go down into thy
[11:15] house?" And Uriah said unto David, "The
[11:17] ark in Israel and Judah abide in tents,
[11:20] and my lord Joab and the servants of my
[11:22] lord are encamped in the open field.
[11:23] Shall I then go into my house to eat, to
[11:26] drink, and to lie with my wife? Thou
[11:28] livest as thou so liveth, I will do this
[11:30] thing." And David said to Uriah, "Try
[11:32] here today also, and tomorrow I will let
[11:35] th thee depart." So Uriah abode in
[11:37] Jerusalem that day and tomorrow. And
[11:39] when David had called him, he did eat
[11:41] and drink before him, and made him
[11:42] drunk. And we'll jump to 14. in the so
[11:45] he even tried to he tried to get your
[11:47] eye to get drunk to go in onto his wife.
[11:51] So you just see that um when you
[11:53] overstep a boundary like that when you
[11:55] step into a lie you're going to keep
[11:57] feeding the lie and keep going and keep
[11:59] going. And the thing was if David would
[12:01] have just fessed up instead of trying to
[12:04] cover up anytime you try to cover up uh
[12:07] I'm not saying a situation like this but
[12:10] anything in our life we try to cover up
[12:12] we know we should make it right. you're
[12:13] gonna have the risk running the risk of
[12:15] doing something similar like David has
[12:18] done because you have to keep on living
[12:20] with that lie, living with that lie
[12:21] because you don't want anybody to know
[12:23] what you did. And so let's keep it
[12:25] going. And um and David went this look
[12:27] how far David went cuz we this is a man
[12:29] after God's own heart. David didn't
[12:31] really want to do this, but he was just
[12:33] caught up at the wrong time, wrong
[12:35] situation, the wrong place. And the
[12:37] devil can get us in situations where
[12:39] we're caught up and we're doing things
[12:42] or something we wouldn't ever think of
[12:44] doing. Right? So, uh, and he wrote the
[12:47] letter saying, "Set ye in the forefront
[12:50] of the honest battle and retire ye from
[12:52] him that he may be smitten and die." So,
[12:55] even this, check this out, that he
[12:56] literally gave Uriah, this how faithful
[12:58] Uriah is. He didn't even look at the
[13:00] note. He literally had his death
[13:02] sentence in his hand, right? Gave it to
[13:05] the commander. Yeah. and he and he was
[13:08] killed not too long after that. And so
[13:10] we're going to see what this does to
[13:12] David's kingdom. And we'll go to second
[13:15] let's go to 2 Samuel 5 11-13. Just
[13:19] trying to lay a little foundation.
[13:21] And so we'll go to verse 11 of uh
[13:24] chapter 5 of 2 Samuel.
[13:26] And here king of the Tyrie sent me to
[13:29] David and cedar trees and carpenters and
[13:31] masons. And they built a house. And
[13:33] David perceived that the Lord had
[13:34] established him king over Israel, that
[13:36] he exalted his kingdom from his people,
[13:38] Israel's sake. And David took him more
[13:40] concubines and wives out of Jerusalem
[13:44] after he was come from Herban. And there
[13:45] was yet sons and daughters born to
[13:47] David. So the reason why I put that
[13:48] scripture there is I wanted us to point
[13:50] out that David had a issue with women,
[13:53] right? Because he said concubines and
[13:56] wives, multiple wives. And so we may not
[13:59] have that issue today, but we want to
[14:01] see what this uh this situation he had
[14:04] that actually was carried over unto his
[14:06] son Solomon. And so that's why the title
[14:09] is emotional leakage because you don't
[14:11] realize things that you go through um
[14:14] bad relationship situations uh
[14:17] upbringing can be carried and poured in
[14:20] to your children or to your friends to
[14:22] your colleagues and and those type of
[14:24] things. Sometimes you don't notice
[14:26] because you've been in the environment
[14:28] so long it's just become a part of you
[14:30] and not even realize. And sometimes it
[14:32] has even come out until you're put under
[14:34] pressure. And that's the dangerous part
[14:36] is when you're put under pressure that's
[14:38] that's when it really comes out. And and
[14:40] I can testify when I was growing up I
[14:42] was put in a lot of uh interesting
[14:45] situations with my family. uh this in
[14:48] high school, middle school, you be
[14:49] sleeping at night, you hear a full-blown
[14:51] argument, just things of that nature
[14:53] that I could tell you days and days
[14:55] about. But what I noticed is when I went
[14:57] through those things that it impacted me
[14:59] more than I realized and it didn't come
[15:02] out when I was a kid, but when I got
[15:03] into relationships or friends, things
[15:06] when I was put under pressure, arguments
[15:08] would happen. And I would see that I was
[15:10] mirroring my parents of what I saw. And
[15:13] that's how when you're raising kids, you
[15:15] have to be careful the things that your
[15:17] kids see because kids are like sponges
[15:21] and whatever they see, they will
[15:23] exhibit. And my brother the same way. I
[15:25] I think I might have mentioned this
[15:26] before, but I remember his um his his
[15:29] previous girlfriend he had a baby with
[15:31] that they they were I saw him arguing
[15:34] and it looked just like my parents. It
[15:36] was scary. I looked I was like, "Wow."
[15:38] And I was even a Christian at that
[15:40] moment. But I'll never forget that
[15:41] because they did the same exact thing my
[15:43] parents would do. It'd be something
[15:45] petty. They would argue, scream, cuss,
[15:48] whatever it is. And I I just saw that. I
[15:51] was like, "Wow." As I said to myself, I
[15:52] don't want that for my life. And then I
[15:54] saw when I was in my 20s, it was come
[15:56] out at certain instances when I was put
[15:58] under pressure. Yes, sir. And so that's
[16:00] why emotional leakage is dangerous. Um
[16:03] because if you're not careful, just like
[16:04] with David, it got carried on to him and
[16:07] to Solomon. And we we'll read in um
[16:10] let's go to um First Kings 11 and read
[16:15] verses 1-4.
[16:17] So now look how bad it got because uh of
[16:19] something that David didn't overcome or
[16:21] didn't realize he had to overcome. So
[16:24] let's go to um verse we read this is
[16:27] four verses 1-4. But King Solomon loved
[16:30] many strange women. Now, now God
[16:32] actually warned Solomon not to take any
[16:35] strange women. He he actually warned him
[16:37] for a reason. And he says, uh, together
[16:39] with the daughters of Pharaoh, women of
[16:41] the Moabites, Ammonites,
[16:43] Zenonites, and the Hittites,
[16:45] of the nations concerning, uh, which the
[16:48] Lord said unto the children of Israel,
[16:49] you shall not go into them, neither
[16:51] shall you come in unto them, for surely
[16:52] they will turn away your heart from the
[16:54] their from their after their gods. Saul
[16:57] enclave unto these in love, and check
[16:59] this out. And he had 700 wives, princes,
[17:02] and 300 concubines. And wives turned
[17:04] away his heart. Now, what man would you
[17:07] need 700 wives? That that's just asking
[17:10] for danger. And 300 concubines. So
[17:13] that's over a thousand women you have in
[17:15] your presence. And then now the the
[17:17] worst part is he wanted more. He went to
[17:19] strange women. So we just see how it
[17:21] just carried over from generation to
[17:24] Solomon. And we see his downfall was
[17:26] that. And actually
[17:28] now tonight we're not going to be
[17:30] talking about just that, but we're going
[17:31] to a little more deeper today. So let's
[17:33] get a little more deeper. So I'm sure
[17:34] Solomon heard the story of what happened
[17:36] to his mom and dad. People talk. Yeah.
[17:40] There's a lot of people in the kingdom.
[17:41] People talk. They got loose lips. So I'm
[17:44] pretty sure that uh Solomon heard these
[17:47] things. And we we see that it actually
[17:50] impacted him negatively
[17:53] because we see when he was an adult, he
[17:55] had wife after wife after wife after
[17:57] wife and eventually he actually uh
[18:00] actually a woman uh women actually
[18:02] turned his heart to serve God, to serve
[18:05] other gods and idol worship. And that
[18:07] wasn't his intention because he he was
[18:10] he was hot for God. Even when when he
[18:12] prayed, he said, "Lord, I just want
[18:14] wisdom to deal with your people." right?
[18:16] He he didn't want no riches or none of
[18:18] those things. So, we see why it's so
[18:20] important what the the prophet said that
[18:22] there's three things that can hurt a
[18:24] hurt a minister or even even a man's
[18:26] life is popularity, women, and I forgot
[18:28] the third one and money. And so, we see
[18:31] what happened to Solomon. He fell in the
[18:33] category of the women. Yeah. Because no
[18:36] man should have that many wives. And you
[18:38] think David should have been happy with
[18:40] his with the wives that he had that he
[18:42] didn't need to have another one because
[18:44] he actually went and married her after
[18:47] uh after he after after she got he got
[18:49] her husband got killed and to get
[18:51] married and the baby passed away. It was
[18:53] a lot of things. Then we see the the the
[18:55] spirit that was released. So you guys
[18:58] see the the act that he did the lying
[19:00] the adultery that that spirit was
[19:03] released into his kingdom that it
[19:04] actually destroyed the kingdom where his
[19:06] son actually uh was trying to kill him
[19:09] and and David had to run away and we see
[19:11] if you look if you look through after
[19:13] the after the moment he did that look
[19:15] what happened in the kingdom look the
[19:16] spirits yes because yes the yes God
[19:19] forgave him but now you have to you have
[19:21] to pay the consequence right because
[19:23] yeah you can ask for forgiveness and all
[19:26] these things. But sometimes we have to
[19:28] pay the consequence, especially when we
[19:29] know better. Now, it's a difference when
[19:31] you don't know better. But when you know
[19:34] better, then God is going to hold you
[19:36] more accountable for it. So now, now we
[19:40] know that um SA's even worse. And we see
[19:42] Solomon's downfall was similar to his
[19:44] father having woman problem woman
[19:46] problem. So we see that Solomon should
[19:48] have taken this more seriously. So the
[19:50] thing is if you know you have emotional
[19:52] if you know that you had a rough
[19:54] upbringing bad friends then you we need
[19:57] to take this more seriously because
[19:59] there's a a higher likelihood that you
[20:02] would exhibit the same thing that you
[20:04] saw. Same thing with like an alcoholic.
[20:06] Let's say your parents was an alcoholic
[20:08] or a womanizer. You have to be careful
[20:11] because that same spirit can be passed
[20:13] on because it wasn't broken in the
[20:15] previous generation. generational curses
[20:18] and spirits are real things. They're
[20:20] real things. And I can testify to that
[20:23] because I had issues in my life uh w
[20:26] with with arguing in certain situations.
[20:28] And I can I can get into a lot of
[20:30] details, but I'm not going to get into
[20:31] so much detail. So, let's go right to
[20:33] the word of God. So, now we're going to
[20:34] talk about another Bible characters.
[20:36] Let's talk about Abraham, uh Jacob, and
[20:39] Isaac. So, we'll go to uh I didn't put
[20:42] this in the notes, I'm sorry. Genesis
[20:44] 12:es 10 through13. So I really want to
[20:46] just uh point the emphasis of how
[20:48] important it is to make sure that what
[20:51] we're showing our children, our friends
[20:54] that we want to show them a a a good
[20:56] example to look after. So verse 10, and
[20:59] there was a famine in the land, and
[21:00] Abraham went down into Egypt to
[21:02] Shorejon. Therefore, the famine was
[21:04] grievous in the land. And it came to
[21:06] pass when he's come near to enter into
[21:08] Egypt, that he said unto Sarah his wife,
[21:11] "Behold now, I know that I a fair woman
[21:13] to look upon. Therefore, it shall come
[21:15] to pass when the Egyptians shall see
[21:17] thee that they shall say, "This is his
[21:20] wife, and they will kill me, but they
[21:22] will save thee alive." So now, if
[21:24] Abraham would have thought about this,
[21:26] that his purpose was his protection,
[21:29] that he wouldn't have to lie, right?
[21:32] Because if God promised that there's
[21:34] going to be seed through you, then he
[21:36] has to preserve your life. Right? No
[21:39] matter how fair Sarah's look upon, God
[21:42] will not let anybody touch his wife.
[21:45] Because that seed has to come through
[21:46] Sarah. So God will not let that seed be
[21:49] defiled. So he said, "Say, I pray thee,
[21:51] thou my sister, that may be well with me
[21:53] for thy sake, and thou shalt live
[21:55] because of thee." Let's go to Genesis 20
[21:57] now. We'll see what what his son does
[21:59] now. Isaac.
[22:02] Me one second.
[22:05] Okay. Oh, actually, I'm sorry. Let's go
[22:06] to Genesis 20. So actually Abraham
[22:08] actually lied again. I forgot about
[22:10] that. So let's go to Genesis 20:es 2-6.
[22:12] And Abra said and Abraham said of
[22:14] Sarah's wife. So you think that Abraham
[22:16] would have learned his lesson that that
[22:18] God brought him out. The mistake that he
[22:20] made, God brought him out, right? And
[22:23] but yet he got in the same predicament.
[22:25] That's right. And Abraham said unto
[22:27] Sarah his wife, she is my sister.
[22:29] Amblelet king of Gar sent and took
[22:31] Sarah. But God came to him became by
[22:34] night and said to him, Behold, thou art
[22:36] but a dead man. And for the woman which
[22:38] thou hast taken, for she is a man's
[22:40] wife. But Aimc had not come near her.
[22:42] And he said, Lord, without slay also a
[22:45] righteous nation. Said he unto him, she
[22:47] is my sister, and she even herself said,
[22:50] he is my brother, and integrity of my
[22:51] heart, and inency innocency of my hands
[22:54] have I done this. And God said in him a
[22:56] dream, yay, I know that thou didest in
[22:58] integrity of thy heart. For I also
[22:59] withhold held thee from sinning against
[23:01] me. Therefore suffered I thee not to
[23:04] touch it. So now let's go to Genesis 26.
[23:06] We're going to see what Isaac did now.
[23:08] So, we did see the importance. Something
[23:10] maybe we think that's so little and
[23:12] minute, but it was yet carried over to
[23:14] another generation.
[23:16] And the men of the place asked him of
[23:18] his wife and said, "She is my sister."
[23:19] Look, this looks familiar. For he feared
[23:22] to say, "She is my wife, lest said he,
[23:26] the men of the place should kill me for
[23:28] Rebecca, because she was fair to look
[23:30] upon." And it came to pass when he had
[23:32] been there a long time that Aimilec the
[23:34] king of the Philistines looked out the
[23:35] window and saw and behold Isaac was
[23:38] sporting Rebecca his wife. So that lie
[23:42] that he told is really a lie now because
[23:44] they they they they see that he lied
[23:46] right to his man's face. And Amlch said,
[23:49] "Which is this thou done unto us? One of
[23:51] the people might lightly have lined us
[23:53] with thy wife. Thou should us have
[23:55] brought guiltness upon us." So that one
[23:57] lie, let's say if they would have tried
[23:59] to do something with his wife, they
[24:02] would have been probably struck down
[24:04] dead just because of one little lie. So
[24:08] one little lie cannot only impact you
[24:10] but impact those around you. So that's
[24:13] why it's so important to be careful the
[24:16] things that you're doing because not
[24:18] only you're going to suffer, but your
[24:19] family around you is going to suffer.
[24:21] Amen. So, so especially when when you're
[24:23] married, have kids, it's not about us
[24:25] anymore, but it's about your whole
[24:27] family. Cuz one little thing can not
[24:29] only impact you, but impact them and
[24:31] their future as well. And then we'll go
[24:34] to um let's go to Genesis chapter 27 and
[24:36] we'll look at Jacob. Even Jacob's name
[24:38] was a liar and a deceiver. So, we see
[24:40] three generations, Abraham,
[24:44] Isaac, and Jacob. That's why emotional
[24:47] leakage is so important to uh the the
[24:50] Lord needs to give you deliverance from
[24:52] it because if not it's going to be
[24:54] carried on to generation your kids their
[24:56] kids their kids
[24:58] and he said came unto his father said my
[25:00] father he said here am I who art thou my
[25:03] son and Jacob said unto his father I am
[25:05] Esau thy firstborn knowing he's not his
[25:08] firstborn I have done according as thou
[25:10] badeest me I pray thee sit and eat out
[25:13] of venison that thy soul may bless thee
[25:15] And Isaac said unto his son, "How is it
[25:17] that thou hast found it so quickly, my
[25:19] son?" He said, "Look at this." Because
[25:21] the Lord thy God brought it to me.
[25:23] Another lie. Wow. He He said, "The Lord
[25:26] did this." And the Lord didn't do
[25:27] nothing like that. So this is dangerous
[25:30] right there. And Isaac said unto Jacob,
[25:31] "Come near, I pray thee, that I may fill
[25:33] thee, my son, whether thou be my very
[25:36] son, Esau," or not. So his mom is
[25:39] actually in with this. She actually told
[25:41] him to do this, and he went along with
[25:42] it. They literally put like fur on his
[25:44] hands. They glue fur to his hands. She
[25:47] made a goat with venison just like he
[25:49] likes. So this lie is like going and
[25:52] going and going and tricked literally
[25:54] tricked his poor blind dad. His dad
[25:56] can't even see right now. And then Esau
[25:58] comes in and saying what happened. And
[26:02] then Esau was robbed of the blessing.
[26:04] And so the thing is sometimes we try to
[26:06] do God's job and they didn't need to do
[26:10] that cuz God already knew that he loved
[26:14] Jacob and hated Esau. He didn't even
[26:16] have to even lie to take the the um the
[26:18] uh the birthright away. God was going to
[26:20] give it to him already because he loved
[26:22] Jacob. So sometimes um we meddle in
[26:27] things. Say look at Sarah. She did the
[26:29] same thing and we see his wife, she did
[26:32] the same thing. Look at I didn't even
[26:34] see like that. But we see once again
[26:36] emotional leakage comes right there to
[26:38] the wife to the wife to the dad to the
[26:41] dad and to the grandson just like that.
[26:44] And that's why we got to be careful with
[26:46] these things because spirits go over.
[26:49] They travel because when you have a lion
[26:52] spirit, it's a spirit. It travels. Same
[26:54] thing with emotional leakage. It's a
[26:56] spirit. It travels. It comes from some
[26:57] sort of hurt. So let's keep it going,
[27:00] right? Yes, we'll go to um let's go to a
[27:02] quote. Things that are to be. Well,
[27:05] that's the way with sin. When you kill
[27:07] sin, so one thing we have to do is you
[27:09] have to kill these things because if you
[27:12] don't kill it at the root, then it's
[27:14] going to keep coming back. If an
[27:16] animal's biting, you don't just cut his
[27:18] tail off, you cut the head off. So the
[27:19] same thing with sin, you got to cut the
[27:21] sin off so it it dies right there. You
[27:24] got to say, "This is where it stops at,
[27:26] Satan. You were you are not going to any
[27:28] more generations. I am stopping it right
[27:30] here through the mighty name of Jesus
[27:32] Christ. When he died on the cross, he
[27:34] died for everything. Not one thing, but
[27:36] everything. Amen. All sin can be
[27:39] eradicated in the presence of God.
[27:42] You will kill every attribute that
[27:45] follows it. So, so it may not be that
[27:47] you've sinned, but the weakness of your
[27:49] parents and your parents' parents. Sin
[27:51] is hereditary. Hear that. The prophet
[27:53] said sin is hereditary. He said, I mean,
[27:56] sickness is hereditary in many cases,
[27:58] too. Each generation gets weaker and
[28:00] wiser as the scripture says. And so
[28:02] therefore you have to deal with sickness
[28:04] and sin on the same basis as atonement.
[28:06] So he said wow he said I mean sickness
[28:08] is heritary in many cases too. So
[28:10] sickness and sin go hand in hand. Let's
[28:14] go to another uh another one. And you
[28:16] know even that that your parents done
[28:18] now people think that isn't visit from
[28:20] generation to generation but it is over
[28:22] in the book of Hebrews I believe about
[28:24] the seventh chapter speaking Paul there
[28:26] writes I believe it was was speaking on
[28:28] a great event that taken place with
[28:30] Abraham that he paid tithe to Melzdc
[28:33] when he was returning from the slaughter
[28:34] of the king. Now he said that Levi was
[28:36] in the loins of Abraham when he met
[28:38] Melzdc coming from the slaughter of
[28:40] kings. And when he reckoned that Levi
[28:42] paid tithe when he was in the loins of
[28:44] Abraham, his great-grandfather, he
[28:46] visits the sins of the people upon their
[28:48] children from generation to generation.
[28:51] That won't keep his word. Think about
[28:53] that. And we'll go to one more quote.
[28:55] Well, that's the way with sin. When you
[28:57] kill sin, you kill every attribute that
[29:00] follows it. So we'll stop right there
[29:02] because you read that already. So now I
[29:04] want to so I looked at the definition of
[29:06] emot emotional leakage. I was just
[29:08] curious what what what it said about it.
[29:10] So it said the unintended
[29:13] expression of eternal internal feelings.
[29:16] So there's been some sort of hurt that's
[29:18] been inside of you that uh it could be
[29:21] through emotional trauma. It could be
[29:24] through mom and dad. It could be through
[29:26] brother. It could be through past
[29:27] relationships. It's a numerous amounts
[29:30] of things that what emotional leakage
[29:31] can come from. So it's often through
[29:34] nonverbal cues when someone is trying to
[29:36] conceal or manage their emotions. And a
[29:39] lot of times they can't manage it. So
[29:41] when pressure comes out, arguments
[29:43] happen. I heard many times my parents
[29:45] argue back and forth be the stu
[29:47] stupidest thing, a dish in the sink or
[29:48] something and it'll be yelling and
[29:50] screaming. And you got to look back that
[29:52] that comes from something that they saw
[29:54] when they were growing up and something
[29:55] that they couldn't overcome from their
[29:57] parents or from their past
[29:59] relationships. And so I I didn't see
[30:01] this uh until we had a Sunday school
[30:03] lesson one time and it was mentioned and
[30:05] I thought about that. I was like, "Wow."
[30:07] And I really thought about I was like,
[30:08] "So the reason why my parents were doing
[30:09] these things because some hurt that they
[30:11] had that they never overcame and still
[30:15] today they still have the same issue.
[30:17] Say they'll literally like a heated
[30:20] argument won't talk for weeks and weeks,
[30:22] sometimes months, and then all of a
[30:24] sudden they make up and then the same
[30:27] thing happens over and over again. And
[30:28] it's like an endless cycle that that it
[30:30] never gets broken. Endless cycle.
[30:32] Endless cycle. And And I saw that and I
[30:35] was like, I don't want that for I didn't
[30:37] I told myself I don't want that for my
[30:39] life. And I'm so thankful that this is
[30:41] me that that I didn't get married in my
[30:43] 20s. Now this is me. Now don't don't say
[30:44] brother Mark said this. Yeah. I have to
[30:46] do this. No, no, no. I'm so thankful I
[30:48] didn't get married in my 20s because I
[30:49] the Lord had to show me I had a lot of
[30:51] baggage in my life from what I saw in my
[30:54] upbringing. and and God had to uh help
[30:57] me overcome and still help me overcome
[30:59] these things to this day. So you think
[31:01] something as little as that, but no,
[31:03] your parents are the biggest influence
[31:04] you have and you are going to mirror
[31:07] image what you see. Right. And so it's
[31:10] so important if if if you know there's
[31:13] uh if you know there's past hurt and
[31:15] there's issues in your family, you have
[31:17] to overcome those things for your kids
[31:19] because you don't want to pass those
[31:20] things on to your kids cuz they going to
[31:22] pass it to their kids and they
[31:24] grandkids. Amen. True. All right. Now,
[31:27] here's another definition. Um
[31:28] unintentional. It's not a conscious
[31:30] effort to display these emotions, but
[31:32] rather a failure of self-control. You
[31:34] don't even know they're in there
[31:35] sometimes. That's how bad there is. How
[31:37] bad it is. also nonverbal. It often
[31:40] manifests through body language, facial
[31:42] expressions, tone of voice and other non
[31:45] uh verbal cues. Some examples is
[31:48] emotional leakage can manifest a
[31:49] susceptible change in facial
[31:51] expressions. Also shifts in posture,
[31:54] variation and in tone of voice.
[31:56] Consequences. These leaked emotions can
[31:59] mis can be misrepresented or even
[32:01] noticed by others potentially leading to
[32:05] misunderstanding or discomfort. Now,
[32:08] causes emotional leakage is often a
[32:11] result of a trying to suppress emotions
[32:13] or it can stem from a lack of awareness
[32:16] of one's own body language and emotional
[32:19] expression. So, these things come out
[32:21] and sometimes you're so caught up in the
[32:23] moment you realize what you said. That's
[32:26] right. So, now let's keep it going. So,
[32:29] it it also potentially revealing it can
[32:31] expose hidden emotions or attention.
[32:33] Sometimes you'll lash out and you don't
[32:35] even know why you lashed out. It's
[32:36] because there's past hurt that you
[32:39] haven't made, you haven't uh forgiven.
[32:41] You haven't made forgiveness yet. Like
[32:43] those threeing words, I forgive you.
[32:45] Sometimes we need to use those freeing
[32:47] words because our our parents didn't do
[32:49] that purposely to us or or they they
[32:51] didn't let us see certain things
[32:52] purposely, but they were hurt and they
[32:54] didn't know how to handle it. They
[32:56] didn't know how to overcome it. So, they
[32:58] did the best thing that they they could
[32:59] do is argue. That's all they knew. So,
[33:02] that's the best thing that they could
[33:03] do. Wow. So now emotional leakage is
[33:07] dangerous like we said before it extends
[33:09] from damage some sort of damage that you
[33:11] could have received from upbringing
[33:13] friends and it could be caused from
[33:14] various amounts of things. So a lot of
[33:16] times psychologists can point these
[33:18] things out to you but they can't give
[33:21] you solution how to how to solve it.
[33:23] They can say oh do this and do that but
[33:25] those things only suppress it right
[33:28] because the only person who can give you
[33:30] overcoming victory is Jesus Christ.
[33:32] That's why I'm not a big fan of of of
[33:34] worldly counselors because they they
[33:36] they'll give you pills, do this and do
[33:37] that, but those things aren't going to
[33:40] solve the problem. Eventually going to
[33:42] something's going to happen and a
[33:43] blowup's going to happen.
[33:45] Most most times emotional leakage is
[33:47] actually never fully overcome because so
[33:50] I give you this. We see David was a man
[33:52] after God's own heart and he still had
[33:55] testimony after testimony, but he still
[33:57] had this underlying issue that he never
[33:59] dealt with. And so the same thing is you
[34:01] can this issue you can never overcome
[34:03] and you actually transmit it to your
[34:06] kids because you you didn't take it
[34:08] serious enough. You thought that oh I'm
[34:10] I'm going to be better than my parents.
[34:11] I'm going to say this and this. But I
[34:14] did the same thing and I was still
[34:16] exhibit. I told my I'm not going to be
[34:17] like my parents and I I was like my
[34:19] parents even even I made a promise to
[34:22] myself because it takes the Lord. The
[34:25] Lord has to help you back that promise
[34:27] up. See the only the words the words L
[34:31] the the the Lord's word is going to back
[34:33] that promise up because how many we made
[34:35] promises in our past and we couldn't
[34:37] fulfill it. Uh we're human beings we try
[34:40] we try our best but things come up
[34:42] situations come up and and vice versa.
[34:46] So the thing is um when we hold on to
[34:50] this emotional leakage it's then poured
[34:53] into our children and our children's
[34:55] children our children's children. And so
[34:57] the thing is we have to be careful. I
[34:59] know we got new parents here. Um, one
[35:02] thing the devil is going to do is the
[35:04] devil hates to see uh a united family in
[35:07] Christ. He hates it because he knows
[35:10] that he is powerless. So what the devil
[35:12] will do is he will try to he'll send
[35:15] anything he can a little uh
[35:17] disagreement, a little spat cuz he wants
[35:19] to get a negative reaction. He wants the
[35:22] arguing to happen. He he he wants
[35:24] yelling to happen so he can cause um
[35:26] discord. And so the thing is if you look
[35:29] what the enemy is doing in this day and
[35:30] age is he is trying to separate the
[35:33] family. He wants both parents to work.
[35:36] He wants the parents to spend less time
[35:38] with the kids. He wants tablets, social
[35:40] media, whatever it is, Tik Tok,
[35:42] Instagram. He wants them uh he wants
[35:44] their minds to be um to to to be uh uh
[35:48] formed and I can't think of a word. He
[35:50] he wants their mind to be uh consumed.
[35:54] Thank you. He wants our their mind to be
[35:55] consumed with all these things. And then
[35:57] when he when he takes the coordinate of
[36:00] a family and breaks it apart, that's
[36:02] when those things come out easily. So
[36:04] that's why it's so important that we
[36:06] have to be sober and vigilant because
[36:08] the enemy is constantly trying to
[36:10] destroy our families. And so that's why
[36:13] you have to fight for unity in a family
[36:16] cuz the devil is not going to let you
[36:18] keep it because he hates it. because
[36:20] he's powerless against you because of
[36:22] that. And so that's why we got to fight
[36:24] for our children because our children
[36:26] need to see good examples. Because good
[36:29] examples after good examples as
[36:31] leadership and others can see that
[36:32] marriage, see the whatever it is,
[36:34] friendships, whatever it is, and see
[36:36] what ah what a marriage should be or
[36:39] what a friendship should be.
[36:42] So our children have enough to overcome
[36:45] already in this dark age. We don't need
[36:47] to give them anything extra unnecessary
[36:50] to overcome. They don't need extra
[36:52] unnecessary things to overcome because
[36:54] we didn't deal with our past hurt
[36:56] because the devil was already attacking
[36:58] full force at our youth. We don't need
[37:00] to give them anything else to have to to
[37:02] have to unnecessarily overcome. That's
[37:04] the truth.
[37:07] Let's keep it going. We'll go to um
[37:08] let's go to Proverbs uh 21. Proverbs
[37:11] 18:21.
[37:13] So, I'm going to read this last
[37:14] statement. A lot of times you you won't
[37:16] know there's emotional leakage or damage
[37:18] there until you're put under pressure or
[37:20] you might not recognize them at all
[37:22] because of all the emotional damage.
[37:23] Sometimes you become so numb to it.
[37:26] Sometimes you become so defeated
[37:28] thinking that you'll never overcome this
[37:30] that I'm going to be just like my
[37:31] parents in this aspect. And so thing is
[37:34] you can't have a defeated mentality. You
[37:36] got to be desperate and hungry and say
[37:38] Lord I do not want my life to be like
[37:40] this anymore. Enough's enough. The buck
[37:43] stops here. here and you got to you got
[37:44] to just move forward like that. So,
[37:46] Proverbs 18:21. So, now this is another
[37:49] we're going to jump to another uh
[37:51] channel. So, death and life are in the
[37:53] power of the tongue and they that love
[37:56] it shall eat the fruit of it thereof.
[37:59] So, now check. So, what you say has has
[38:02] a power to destroy or build somebody, a
[38:06] friend, your children. So, be careful on
[38:09] the words that you say to your kids. My
[38:12] dad said some things to me that that I
[38:14] didn't know, but it broke me. And I
[38:16] didn't My my mom, my stepmom, some
[38:18] things they said to me that it broke me.
[38:20] It hurt me emotionally. I didn't even
[38:22] realize it.
[38:24] So now let's go to James 3 1-13. So
[38:27] we're going to talk about the tongue
[38:28] today. My brethren, be not many masters,
[38:31] knowing what shall we receive the
[38:33] greater condemnation. So this is James
[38:36] 3:es 1 through uh 15, I believe. 18.
[38:39] We're going to leave uh read for many
[38:41] things we offend all if any man offend
[38:44] not in word the same as a perfect man.
[38:46] So we can offend somebody with our word
[38:48] and not even know it.
[38:51] So it says if any man offend not in word
[38:53] the same as perfect man and enable also
[38:56] to brittle the whole body. So I looked
[38:58] that word up brittle. is a restraint, a
[39:01] curb, a check to restrain, guide or
[39:05] govern to check to curb or control as
[39:08] the brittle the passions to brittle
[39:10] amuse. So check this out. But we but
[39:13] behold we put bits in hors's mouth that
[39:16] they may obey us and we turn about their
[39:18] whole body. Now horse is a strong
[39:20] creature as you know horse can weigh
[39:23] th,000 pounds. They are strong
[39:25] creatures. That's why even the cars are
[39:27] named horsepower for a reason. Look, it
[39:29] says, "Behold also the ships which they
[39:32] they though they be great are driven by
[39:34] fierce winds, yet they're turned by a
[39:36] very small helm, whatsoever they govern
[39:39] or listen." So, I like how he how um the
[39:41] writer Paul or um James puts this
[39:44] because he said, "We can control this,
[39:46] we can control this, we can control fish
[39:48] of the sea, animals of the sea, ships of
[39:51] the sea." But yet he said, "Our tongue,
[39:54] even so the tongue is a little member,
[39:56] it boasteth great things. Behold, how
[40:00] great a a matter a little fire
[40:02] kindleth." So I look back in my life how
[40:05] a little itsybitsy tiny situation
[40:09] escalated in my household to yelling and
[40:12] screaming, something so little. shows
[40:14] you that if you don't know how to
[40:15] properly control the tongue, you're
[40:17] going to say things that you wish you
[40:19] could that you wouldn't have said
[40:20] because words hurt.
[40:23] You can't take words back. You can ask
[40:25] for forgiveness, but now you giving the
[40:27] devil ammunition to bring it back up to
[40:30] that person and say, "Oh yeah, he said
[40:31] this. He might say it again like that."
[40:33] And so now you're giving that person
[40:35] something else that they have to
[40:36] overcome because you let you let your
[40:37] mouth slip. So it's so important. I know
[40:40] we make mistakes. Yes, we make mistakes,
[40:41] but don't make the same mistake over and
[40:43] over and over and over again. Let's go
[40:46] to verse six. And the tongue is a fire.
[40:50] I love I love the illustration. A world
[40:52] of iniquity. So is the tongue among our
[40:55] members that it defileth the whole body
[40:58] and setth on fire the course of nature
[41:01] and is set on fire of hell. So I want
[41:04] you to look at this. Even though James
[41:06] is saying all these things, he's not
[41:08] giving you an excuse. Yeah, your tongue
[41:11] is this. But look what he says below
[41:12] after we we keep going. For every kind
[41:14] of beast and birds of serpents and of
[41:17] things in the sea is tamed and hath been
[41:19] tamed of mankind. But the tongue can no
[41:22] man tame. It is unruly evil, full of
[41:25] deadly poison.
[41:28] Verse nine, therewith we bless with we
[41:30] God, even the father, there we curse we
[41:33] men, which are made after the smilitude
[41:36] of God. Let's go to word smilitude. So
[41:39] it's likeness, resemblance, likeness in
[41:41] nature, qualities of appearance as
[41:43] smilitude of substance. Let us make man
[41:46] our own image, man our smile. So God did
[41:49] not make us in his image for us to hurt
[41:51] people with our tongue. He did not make
[41:54] us so we would hurt our friends, our
[41:58] children, our colleagues with our
[42:00] tongue. God because if you look at this,
[42:02] when God disciplines us, does he yell
[42:05] and scream at us?
[42:07] No, he comes with love. Love is
[42:10] corrective. Love may hurt, but it's I'm
[42:13] getting ahead of myself. Let's keep
[42:14] reading. Let's Let's keep going. Let's
[42:16] keep it going. All right. Let's go to um
[42:19] verse 10. Out of the mouth, out of the
[42:22] same mouth proceed blessings and
[42:24] cursings, my brother. Look what he says
[42:26] right here. These things ought not so to
[42:29] be. Amen. So he understands you may have
[42:32] been through emotional leakage,
[42:33] emotional damage, bad upbringings, but
[42:36] it still shouldn't be not so. God has
[42:39] given too much for us to be in a state.
[42:42] The what the devil does, like brother
[42:44] Jack, he was preaching on Jubilee, we're
[42:46] in a prison and the door is unlocked.
[42:49] All we have to do is walk out. So
[42:51] sometimes we just get trapped in our
[42:53] mind so much that we just put oursel in
[42:56] this world where we think that we'll
[42:57] never be able to overcome this. I'm
[42:59] going to be like this for the rest of my
[43:00] life. But you don't have God did not die
[43:03] so you can be like this for the rest of
[43:04] your life. He He wants to make you a new
[43:06] creature in Christ. He wants to He wants
[43:08] to put more of himself in you. So when
[43:10] when situations happen where where the
[43:12] devil comes in to try to make an
[43:14] argument, a soft answer turneth away
[43:16] wrath. See, a lot of times we want to
[43:18] fight fire with fire. And we can't fight
[43:20] fire with fire. The world teaches us if
[43:22] somebody yells at you, you yell back.
[43:24] No. A soft answer turneth away wrath. He
[43:28] used the word in the situation.
[43:30] So does not a fountain send forth at the
[43:32] same place as sweet water and bitter
[43:34] water? Can a fig tree, my brethren, bear
[43:37] olive berries, either a vine or figs? So
[43:39] can no fountain both y be old salt water
[43:41] and fresh water? Verse 13. Who is a wise
[43:44] man endued with knowledge among you? Let
[43:47] him show out of a good conversation his
[43:50] works with meekness of wisdom. But if
[43:53] you have bittering and envying and
[43:55] strife in your hearts, glory not and lie
[43:57] not against the truth. Envying, feeling
[44:01] uneasiness of superior condition, and
[44:03] happiness of another that can stem from
[44:05] also emotional leakage, strife,
[44:07] contention, and anger or immity,
[44:09] contest, struggle for victory. So, a
[44:12] person is trying to get victory. I
[44:14] remember brother Smiley mentioned this.
[44:16] A lot of times when people yell and
[44:17] argue, they want to be heard the
[44:19] loudest. And when you're heard the
[44:21] loudest, not only you hear it, but those
[44:24] around you hear it as well. Because
[44:27] thing is, you don't want to tr you don't
[44:29] have to prove that you're right. I'm
[44:31] right, you're wrong. Don't have to say
[44:32] it that way. Cuz look at Jesus. He never
[44:35] went across that way. He said, he didn't
[44:36] say, "Phares, I'm wrong and you're
[44:37] right." He never went across that. In
[44:39] fact, he went a totally different way.
[44:41] He used love cuz he didn't want to see
[44:43] the Pharisees the Pharisees uh perish.
[44:46] He never did. He did all he could to try
[44:48] to bring them in. Even brother Brandham
[44:50] said you draw a bigger circle. And so
[44:53] that's a lot of times um when I'm
[44:54] learning, you know, uh I've been
[44:56] learning over the last couple years,
[44:57] especially I love being here at spirit
[44:59] and truth just helped to recognize
[45:02] certain things in my life I need to work
[45:04] on. Um because I I had an upbringing of
[45:06] that whoever yells the loudest that
[45:09] literally yells the loudest and and both
[45:11] get louder and louder and louder and
[45:13] louder and louder. You're just like, "Oh
[45:14] my goodness, is the police are the
[45:15] police going to be called now?" And we
[45:17] had instances at my house where the
[45:19] police were called
[45:22] cuz who who wanted to be the loudest?
[45:24] Wow. So let's keep it going. So verse
[45:27] 15. So this wisdom. So now when you use
[45:30] your tongue the wrong way doesn't come
[45:33] from above. Is earthly is sensual. It's
[45:36] devilish. So when we arguing and
[45:38] screaming and saying you this and you
[45:40] that is not from above that's from the
[45:44] devil. Not trying to be rude but it's
[45:47] not from God. Cuz God does not yell to
[45:51] see who's the loudest. He does he
[45:53] doesn't name call. He doesn't say you
[45:54] this and you that. He don't say that. He
[45:57] does not. So for where envy and strife
[45:59] is, there's confusion. And when you have
[46:01] things like that in the household, it
[46:03] brings confusion to your kids.
[46:05] It brings so much confusion. They didn't
[46:07] want they want mom and dad just to be
[46:09] together. That's what I wanted in my
[46:10] household. I want mom and dad to be
[46:12] together cuz they could have been a lot
[46:14] stronger together than separate. And
[46:16] that's what I wish I I wish they would
[46:18] have taken their walk with the Lord
[46:21] serious. But the thing is, you don't
[46:24] choose where you're born. Exactly.
[46:26] That's okay. I'm thankful for the family
[46:28] that God gave me because I learned a
[46:31] lot. They did the best that they could.
[46:33] And I'm thankful. I wouldn't I don't
[46:35] want another family. I'm thankful for my
[46:36] family that I have. Amen. Let's go to
[46:40] verse 17. So right here, this is what we
[46:42] want to think about. When when the devil
[46:44] tries to come in and bring division and
[46:46] discord, you want to think about this.
[46:49] But the wisdom that is from above is
[46:51] first pure, then peace, peaceable,
[46:55] gentle, easy to be entreated, full of
[46:58] mercy and good fruits without partiality
[47:00] and without hypocrisy. So when you when
[47:02] also too when you teaching your kids,
[47:05] you will also when you're correcting
[47:06] them, you want to make sure it's like
[47:08] that because you could say something
[47:10] that's correct, but say it in the wrong
[47:12] tone or the wrong way and actually
[47:14] damage the kid more. Even though even
[47:17] though they should be disciplined, but
[47:19] you have to go about it a different way.
[47:20] I remember my former pastor, I spent a
[47:22] lot of time with him and I seen him put
[47:26] a lot of pressure, but I never seen him
[47:28] yell, not one time. I see his kids get a
[47:30] little angry with him and he just
[47:32] handled it cool, calm and collect. I'm
[47:34] just like, "Wow." His wife got a little
[47:36] mad and he just handled it cool. He just
[47:38] changed the atmosphere. Wow. And he had
[47:41] his own business work lot lots of like
[47:43] like I don't know maybe five or maybe
[47:45] five to 10 employees and I remember one
[47:48] time our church the church got flooded
[47:50] because a pipe burst in the winter time
[47:52] and I got there to help and you just see
[47:53] him he was just cool calm and collect
[47:55] like let's get this done. Let's do this.
[47:56] He was just cool calm and collect. So I
[47:59] spent a lot of time with him and it
[48:00] helped me just so I I told him Lord I
[48:03] want to be a dad like that because all
[48:05] maybe all his kids aren't serving the
[48:06] Lord but they have respect. He never
[48:09] yelled at him but I think he asked um
[48:12] brother Billy Paul one time how does
[48:14] your dad discipline you? He said a lot
[48:16] of times when they're little he would
[48:17] like sit them down on the couch and calm
[48:19] their spirits and then he wouldn't yell
[48:21] at them. He wouldn't scream at them. But
[48:23] the thing is, when you're disciplining a
[48:25] kid, you don't have to yell and scream
[48:27] at them. You don't have to yell and
[48:29] scream at them.
[48:31] You don't you don't have to yell, "Ah,
[48:33] you this, you this, you that." No, no.
[48:36] The There's a way that you can do it
[48:38] because you look I always type things to
[48:40] the Bible. Look how God disciplined
[48:43] discipline others. He didn't yell and
[48:45] scream. He used the word. He made us say
[48:48] some bold things, but the things that he
[48:50] said, it got the person to think about
[48:52] it. Yeah. Peace, a peaceful way. It was
[48:55] easy to be entreated. It was gentle.
[48:59] So, let's go to the pure. Let's go to
[49:01] the We're going we going to break these
[49:02] down. So, the definition of pure is
[49:04] separated from all or extraneuous
[49:06] matter. Clear from mixture as pure
[49:09] water, pure clay, pure sand, pure air,
[49:12] pure silver of gold, pure wine is very
[49:15] scarce. It's genuine. It's real. It's
[49:18] true. It's incorrupt. unadulterated as p
[49:22] pure religion, peaceable, free from war.
[49:27] So when we're having, we should not have
[49:29] war in the home. Only war we should have
[49:31] is with the devil to kick him out.
[49:33] That's the only war we should be having
[49:35] because a lot of times we have war in
[49:37] the home. And I'm not I'm not saying
[49:40] what goes on in the home, but I know
[49:41] there was war in my home all all the
[49:43] time. And I was I was scared sometimes.
[49:45] I'm like, man, they are they going to
[49:46] fist fight? Literally, I was like scared
[49:48] sometimes. I'm like, man, they going
[49:50] they going to really fight.
[49:52] So we live in peaceable times. The
[49:54] reformation was introduced in a peaceful
[49:56] manner. So another definition of it. So
[49:58] gentle. So gentle we see in here mild,
[50:02] meek, soft, bland, not rough, harsh or
[50:07] severe
[50:08] as gentle nature, tempered or
[50:11] disposition. A gentle manner, a gentle
[50:14] address, a gentle voice. Now, I'm not
[50:16] saying we got to be all like gentle like
[50:18] this, but your kids got to respect you.
[50:22] They got to. But you don't have to yell
[50:24] and scream to get their respect. You
[50:26] don't have to yell and scream to get
[50:28] their respect. Not causing labor or
[50:30] difficulty and easy ads or slope is
[50:32] slope rising up a small angle. So,
[50:34] another definition is smooth, not
[50:37] uneven, not rough or very hilly that may
[50:40] be travel with ease. And then gentle,
[50:42] moderate, not pressing as a ship under
[50:44] easy sail. In verse 18,
[50:47] and the fruit of righteousness is sown
[50:48] in peace of them that make peace. So if
[50:52] you sense because the thing is the
[50:53] devil's going to come and he may put a
[50:56] the husband and wife might say something
[50:58] in the heat of the moment and now it's
[51:00] up to you. You have two options. You can
[51:03] you can give that fire back or you can
[51:05] put it out with water which is the word.
[51:07] You have two decisions cuz a lot of
[51:09] times we want to react on our first
[51:10] action. Hey, if you have to maybe walk
[51:13] away or go into another room for a
[51:15] little bit because you don't want to say
[51:16] something, do that. I rather have you do
[51:17] that than you just fire full back force
[51:20] at that person and it causes a back and
[51:21] forth back and forth cuz the devil wants
[51:23] back and forth because the more back and
[51:25] forth it is, he can get in there more.
[51:28] So, we we don't want to get the devil
[51:29] any room to do anything. So, like you
[51:32] said before, your words, we have I have
[51:35] one more minute left. I'll finish. I
[51:37] I'll wrap I'll wrap it up. So your words
[51:39] have the power to destroy or build
[51:41] someone.
[51:42] One bad word or words can consistently
[51:46] can damage the person internally for
[51:49] years. One bad word or words can can
[51:52] damage that person for years to come.
[51:55] Remember you can't take words back. We
[51:57] have to be careful what we let we let
[51:59] come out of our mouth. Don't give the
[52:00] devil any any ammunition. The devil is
[52:03] constantly trying to destroy the family
[52:05] dynamic. He wants to bring division. I
[52:07] go to Matthew 12:25
[52:09] and then we'll we'll we'll close after
[52:12] one more quote we'll close. And Jesus
[52:14] knew their thoughts and said unto them,
[52:15] "Every kingdom divided against itself is
[52:19] brought to desolation. And every city or
[52:22] house divided against itself shall not
[52:26] stand." So unity is so key in the
[52:29] kingdom of God. If you want if you want
[52:30] the if you want to be the way God wants
[52:33] a marriage to be a relationship to be
[52:36] division will not you can't do it. You
[52:39] have to have unity. Unity. Unity. Unity.
[52:42] God is looking for unity.
[52:44] The devil knows and sees as your kids
[52:47] get older he's going. See what the thing
[52:49] is a lot of times if the kids are young
[52:51] the devil isn't going to come in as
[52:53] much. But when he sees the kids get
[52:55] older and they can start seeing and
[52:57] recognizing things that when he try he
[52:59] tries to come in. So that's why you have
[53:00] to be careful and be sober and vigilant.
[53:03] So the thing is the devil knows if
[53:05] there's unity then he will be defeated.
[53:07] He's scared for a family to be in the
[53:09] unity of the Lord. He is scared. Uh he
[53:12] is scared like he he he he is cowering
[53:15] just thinking of you being in unity with
[53:17] God. He is so he's doing everything he
[53:19] can to get you out of unity. And so
[53:22] let's read a uh one more quote. So I
[53:25] like this quote here. I know it's we're
[53:27] going to look at this quote in a
[53:28] different light. Uh so love one another
[53:30] above everything. Love one another.
[53:33] Don't no matter what the devil tries to
[53:35] say. Now brother Brandham is talking
[53:36] about uh the brand I'm talking about
[53:38] being unity. But I want to type this to
[53:40] the household being in unity. So love
[53:44] one another. Don't no matter what the
[53:46] devil tries to say. Now you're all one
[53:49] great sweet group. But remember my
[53:51] warning. See, Satan won't let that stay
[53:53] that way. No sir. He'll shoot
[53:56] everything. If he has to bring somebody
[53:57] in to make his target, he'll bring some
[54:00] critic or some believer in and sit him
[54:02] down and cause him to fellowship with
[54:03] you under the quietness and things. Then
[54:05] he'll shoot that guy with some poison
[54:07] dart and he'll start through the church
[54:09] with it. Don't you take sides with it.
[54:11] Mom and dad, don't take sides. The only
[54:14] side you want to take is the Lord's
[54:15] side. Amen. Because when you take sides,
[54:18] that's when division happens. That's
[54:20] when questions happen. The kids like,
[54:21] "Why are they taking this side? Why are
[54:22] they doing this?" And they're asking all
[54:24] these questions. You don't want your
[54:25] kids to have all these questions because
[54:26] a lot of questions like that bring
[54:27] confusion in the kids. And confusion,
[54:30] that's when the devil can come in and
[54:32] take the little mind away just like
[54:33] that.
[54:35] Um he said he he'll he'll bring some
[54:37] critic unbeliever and sit him down and
[54:38] cause him to fellowship with you under
[54:40] the quietness of things. Then he'll
[54:41] shoot that guy with some poison dart
[54:42] stuff. He'll start through the church
[54:44] with it. Don't take sides with it. Don't
[54:46] you have nothing to do with anything
[54:47] else? Do you stay right, loving, and
[54:49] sweet, and kind to one another? Pray for
[54:51] that, man. Pray for your spouse. Maybe
[54:54] it's maybe some things that you want
[54:56] changed, but maybe God has to show some
[54:58] things first for them to be changed or
[54:59] something to be changed. Pray for that
[55:02] man that he'll be saved to or that woman
[55:04] orever who it is. Just pray for them and
[55:06] stick one to another. I love this part
[55:08] here, too. And stay with your pastor.
[55:10] See, he's the shepherd and he'll give
[55:11] him respects. to lead you through and
[55:13] cause cuz he's ordained God to do so.
[55:17] And then we'll read one more last quote
[55:19] and we'll come to a close. You can't if
[55:21] you're already born in the kingdom of
[55:22] God, you already got the Holy Spirit in
[55:24] you. The only thing you have to do is
[55:27] cut loose from these things of the
[55:29] world. Emotional leakage, emotional
[55:32] damage. Let us lay aside every weight.
[55:35] No, it says every weight. Because when
[55:38] you get filled with the Holy Ghost,
[55:41] everything isn't all hunky dory and
[55:42] perfect. God still has to build you to
[55:46] the perfect statue of a man. So there's
[55:48] things in your life that you may not
[55:51] recognize. I love how David said,
[55:52] "Search me and try me." You say, "Lord,
[55:54] if there's anything inside of me that is
[55:56] lingering I don't know about, Lord, help
[55:58] it make known so I can overcome it."
[56:01] So easy beset us that we might run with
[56:04] patience the life, the race that's set
[56:06] before us. Hebrews the chapter 11, lay
[56:08] aside the weights as everlasting life to
[56:10] receive it. So just in closing, I know
[56:13] this is this is one of those topics
[56:14] that's really deep and and sometimes
[56:17] women realize that we have these things,
[56:19] but I I just see it that I don't want
[56:21] anybody else to have to go through what
[56:23] I went through when I was a kid. Um
[56:25] because I had a I had a lot of things in
[56:28] my life that I struggle with because of
[56:30] those things. And so we're all Holy
[56:32] Ghost fil here. We're parents here. And
[56:35] you want to just keep the devil out as
[56:36] much as you can. Don't let the devil
[56:39] have an inch cuz he'll take a mile just
[56:40] like that. You could be sweet and loving
[56:42] and one thing boom he could come in and
[56:44] just sweep. So we have to be careful
[56:46] with the guard. Guard oursel. Guard your
[56:48] marker. Just like in the Old Testament
[56:49] they had to guard their land marker. So
[56:51] we got to guard our land marker as well
[56:54] because we have come too far. The the
[56:56] the book is open from Genesis to
[56:58] Revelation. We have everything here. We
[57:00] have all the weapons to def defeat the
[57:02] enemy. He's He's defeated. I always said
[57:04] the statement, don't let a defeated
[57:06] creature defeat you. Let let him while
[57:08] in his own defeat. He picked his choice.
[57:11] He made his choice and he has to lie in
[57:13] it. So don't give him any more power
[57:15] than he deserves. Don't give him no
[57:17] power.
[57:18] Amen. So we we'll just we'll close um
[57:21] we'll close in a word of prayer.
[57:24] Dear Lord Jesus,
[57:26] we just thank you for this night
[57:27] tonight, Lord.
[57:29] Father, I I just pray, Lord, that you
[57:31] just help us, Lord, cuz Lord, we're
[57:33] needy people, Lord, and we want to
[57:35] overcome everything, Lord Jesus. We
[57:37] don't want anything, Lord, to stand in
[57:39] the way, Lord, of you moving in the
[57:42] fullness that you want to move in our
[57:44] life, Lord. I look at David's life,
[57:46] Lord. I I believe that you wanted to do
[57:48] so much more, but Lord, you you had to
[57:51] you had to stop at a certain point,
[57:52] Lord. His relationship wasn't the same
[57:54] after he he made that mistake. Yes, you
[57:56] forgive you forgave him, Lord. I look
[57:59] and I see Solomon, Lord, and he was a
[58:01] mighty man of valor as well, Lord, but
[58:03] he had one thing, Lord, that that
[58:05] stopped him, Lord. I see Abraham, Isaac,
[58:08] and Jacob, Lord. We we just see that
[58:10] these the emotional leakage and damage
[58:12] is nothing to play with, Lord. Father,
[58:15] may we not, Lord, transmit anything over
[58:17] to our kids, our friends, our
[58:19] relationships, Lord. But, Father, may
[58:21] you give us the strength just to
[58:22] overcome. May you give us the power to
[58:24] overcome any and everything, Lord. And
[58:27] Lord, as we just gather together, Lord,
[58:28] we see the enemy, Lord, hates unity
[58:30] everywhere, Lord. Father, let us stick
[58:32] that much closer together. Let us pray
[58:34] for one another, Lord. Let us fellowship
[58:36] one another. Let us love one another,
[58:37] Lord, that we can keep that devil out,
[58:39] Lord. We see what Brother Brandham said,
[58:41] Lord, how he the devil hates to see
[58:43] unity, Lord. But, Father, let us stick
[58:45] that much closer together, Lord. Let let
[58:48] no uh scandals or anything happen in
[58:50] this church, Lord. Father, let us, Lord
[58:52] Jesus, just be fully surrendered to you
[58:55] that we can kick everything out. All the
[58:56] mess and junk that tries to come in,
[58:58] we'll kick it out before it even comes
[59:00] into the door, almighty God. And Lord,
[59:02] we just thank you, Lord, for all that
[59:04] you've done, all that you're doing right
[59:06] now. Lord, give us eyes to see what
[59:08] you're doing in our life right now,
[59:09] Lord. And Father, we just give you all
[59:11] the honor, glory, and praise. Jesus
[59:13] Christ name we pray. Amen. Amen.
[59:16] [Applause]
[59:33] Thank the Lord
[59:35] uh for the word of God tonight.
[59:39] Uh it's a little quote that came to me
[59:42] while brother Mark was preaching
[59:45] and uh
[59:47] I I I'm going to read this and um I'm
[59:52] I'm going say a couple things here.
[59:55] There's a this quote came to me out of
[59:57] paradox
[59:59] and and if you all would just put
[1:00:06] in your search this father and mother
[1:00:12] both are Christians.
[1:00:14] It should take us to paradox. Uh so
[1:00:17] there's you know I'll be honest uh when
[1:00:21] when when when you sitting there
[1:00:23] listening to the word uh there are all
[1:00:25] kind of thoughts that kind of go through
[1:00:27] your head and um you know one of the
[1:00:30] thoughts that went through my head is
[1:00:31] like brother brother Mark is not married
[1:00:36] but yet he's given
[1:00:38] um married people uh advice and uh
[1:00:43] sometimes it's hard for people to
[1:00:44] receive it because he's not married. But
[1:00:47] to those people, I want to say um be
[1:00:51] careful
[1:00:53] uh that you miss uh what God is
[1:00:56] speaking. Go beyond the vessel and his
[1:00:58] status
[1:01:00] because he's representing God when he's
[1:01:03] standing here. And uh he he brought some
[1:01:07] things from his own personal experience.
[1:01:10] So, we can we can learn from that and
[1:01:12] and and I'm very very grateful uh that
[1:01:15] he was just so transparent with us and
[1:01:17] and uh hopefully we'll take that and and
[1:01:20] we'll we'll be better. I want to read
[1:01:21] this quote because this came to me uh
[1:01:24] while he was ministering. Uh it says
[1:01:27] this father and mother both are
[1:01:29] Christians filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:01:31] and they have brought this young man up
[1:01:33] in the way of the Lord and now the young
[1:01:36] man is about 17 or 18 years old. Now
[1:01:38] look, uh, so things happen while they're
[1:01:41] young people, right? So this boy
[1:01:44] developed certain things as a young man,
[1:01:47] uh, that would have kept going with him
[1:01:48] in life had not God got a hold of them,
[1:01:51] right? So we shape our our our children
[1:01:54] at a very young age. He says, now um,
[1:01:58] the the young man is about 17 or 18
[1:02:00] years old, some some something along
[1:02:02] there. Uh, very fine kid. He's been a
[1:02:04] real model boy at home.
[1:02:07] nice kid and he's got a brother that's
[1:02:09] just vice versa.
[1:02:11] So this boy's a model boy, but the other
[1:02:13] boy just trouble all all over the place,
[1:02:16] right? And it says, uh, but the the
[1:02:18] girls, uh, the mother's family lives
[1:02:21] close to a fine church, but do you think
[1:02:24] they'd ever come over here? No. And they
[1:02:26] know it's right, but it's just not in
[1:02:29] them
[1:02:30] to ask forgiveness or ask pardoning. So
[1:02:35] there's a a trait that is inside this
[1:02:38] family where they will never ask for
[1:02:40] forgiveness.
[1:02:42] They know they hurt you, but it's not in
[1:02:45] them to say, "I'm sorry."
[1:02:48] Those are another three words. I am
[1:02:52] sorry.
[1:02:54] Right. Uh to ask forgiveness or ask
[1:02:56] pardon and they just won't do it. It's
[1:02:58] just not in them. And then he he says,
[1:03:00] "Now the genes in the father and the
[1:03:03] mother of this boy, no matter how much
[1:03:06] they are converted,
[1:03:09] still remains the flesh that's been
[1:03:11] interbred out to this boy. Therefore,
[1:03:14] the boy has got a complex in him." How
[1:03:16] did he get it? How did the boy get the
[1:03:19] complex?
[1:03:22] From the genes of the father and the
[1:03:24] mother.
[1:03:29] It says just like from his mother's
[1:03:30] family, they and they are not forgiving,
[1:03:34] they will not apologize.
[1:03:38] And that's where that boy stands. He
[1:03:41] says, "Now I said to the father, no
[1:03:42] matter how much you've raised them up, I
[1:03:45] said, now look at you out of your
[1:03:48] family, all of them drunks and fighting
[1:03:50] and shooting and cutting and so forth."
[1:03:54] He telling he's telling daddy just like
[1:03:56] it is. Look at the family you come from,
[1:03:58] right? Everybody drunk,
[1:04:01] but look at you. I mean, he just letting
[1:04:03] them know, you know, and and if we all
[1:04:05] just went down the memory, I mean, just
[1:04:06] our own uh uh lane, uh we we know where
[1:04:10] we come from. We we know we know what
[1:04:12] type of people we we we we um you know,
[1:04:15] we we we were raised under. Uh everybody
[1:04:19] got a crazy uncle
[1:04:21] or something, you know. And I mean we
[1:04:24] all we all had like the brother say you
[1:04:26] my family just cussing and fussing and
[1:04:28] fighting and yelling and screaming over
[1:04:30] some of the silliest things that u you
[1:04:33] shouldn't even be shouldn't even but
[1:04:34] that's that's a spirit that was
[1:04:36] attacking that home. All right. He says
[1:04:39] now look at your family to the mother.
[1:04:40] So he's talking to the father and
[1:04:41] mother. Uh look at your family to the
[1:04:43] mother. They're a bunch of people just
[1:04:45] sat there and won't speak.
[1:04:48] very independent,
[1:04:50] so forth, irreverent to religion. Look
[1:04:53] at your family. That's what he's saying.
[1:04:56] He said, "But I said, it's not you." I
[1:04:58] said, "You're the only one of all your
[1:05:00] sisters and brothers, and you're sweet,
[1:05:02] kind, and forgiving. What does that
[1:05:07] say? You're a tree." He says a part of
[1:05:11] that family tree. Yet you have received
[1:05:16] the Holy Ghost and that's the thing that
[1:05:19] made you tender
[1:05:22] and sweet. And what he's saying is not
[1:05:25] your people anymore.
[1:05:27] I'm like this because my family like
[1:05:29] this. No. Which family? God's family. Uh
[1:05:33] the family you came to this earth under.
[1:05:35] No. No. No. No. He said, "When you're
[1:05:37] part of God's family that it changes
[1:05:39] your nature, right?" He says, "It's not
[1:05:42] your people anymore. It's your Christ
[1:05:44] that lives in you."
[1:05:47] I said to that boy, "Look at your
[1:05:48] family. Practically all of them are
[1:05:50] drunks and so forth." I said, "And how
[1:05:52] moody and hottempered and how strong,
[1:05:55] but you're not.
[1:05:57] You're kind, forgiving. What is it?" The
[1:05:59] Holy Spirit. Uh you're no more what you
[1:06:02] are. It's Christ in you. I said now that
[1:06:04] that same thing has to happen to your
[1:06:07] son.
[1:06:12] But all it is the prophet said this man
[1:06:14] couldn't take it. And and and now now
[1:06:16] brother Brandon told him that his family
[1:06:18] was highteered and moody.
[1:06:22] He said but that's not you. You're
[1:06:24] forgiving and kind. But what did the
[1:06:26] daddy do? and his brother Brandon told
[1:06:28] him and the father raised up just
[1:06:30] demonstrated
[1:06:32] he was highte
[1:06:36] right in front of the pro prophet just
[1:06:38] told you what your what your family line
[1:06:40] is like and and you just demonstrated
[1:06:42] raised up how you going to raise up on
[1:06:44] the prophet
[1:06:46] show you something is there right and
[1:06:48] the father raised up and said said my
[1:06:51] son went to the altar he was baptized
[1:06:54] correctly in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:06:56] and water baptism him in the pool said I
[1:06:58] know my son has come to Christ.
[1:07:02] I said that may be all right. All the
[1:07:04] outward motions he might be identified
[1:07:07] as a believer with the believers but
[1:07:10] until he's he is regenerated
[1:07:13] born again.
[1:07:15] I'd advise that that young man I'm
[1:07:19] talking about your boy
[1:07:22] that young man to never marry a woman.
[1:07:26] You want to know why? And brother,
[1:07:28] brother Rand had to be straight with
[1:07:30] him.
[1:07:31] He'll make hell on earth for her.
[1:07:38] Until
[1:07:40] that gentle,
[1:07:42] sweet,
[1:07:44] forgiving spirit of Christ comes in,
[1:07:47] then that would be a paradox in itself
[1:07:49] to take the very nature of a boy that's
[1:07:51] bred between father and mother. Remember
[1:07:54] the reason that this boy's nature is the
[1:07:56] way it is is because of of what was in
[1:07:58] his father and what was in his mother.
[1:07:59] He was just born with this. And the only
[1:08:02] way to get rid of this, the Holy Ghost
[1:08:03] got to come take it out. Sometimes we be
[1:08:06] fighting what people been born with.
[1:08:10] But you got to understand that's why you
[1:08:11] got to take it to the Lord in prayer
[1:08:13] because they just got that and only God
[1:08:14] can take that out of them. Your your
[1:08:17] fussing and fighting and high temperance
[1:08:20] will never get rid of it. It actually
[1:08:22] just fuels it.
[1:08:24] Oh Lord, help us. He says,
[1:08:28] then that will be a paradox in itself to
[1:08:30] take the very nature of a boy that's
[1:08:32] bred between father and mother. And yet
[1:08:34] in his intellectuals, he is trying his
[1:08:36] best to overcome it. He can't do it.
[1:08:40] He'll never overcome it.
[1:08:43] Christ
[1:08:46] will have to overcome it. when he lets
[1:08:49] Christ in, then he's already overcome.
[1:08:53] Then it'll be a perfect paradox when a
[1:08:56] man is born of the spirit of God.
[1:09:02] I tell you the truth, I I'm I'm grateful
[1:09:04] for the word of the Lord here tonight.
[1:09:07] Uh I know I know God spoke to us, all of
[1:09:12] us. God spoke to all of us. And and I
[1:09:14] just I like how the Holy Spirit just led
[1:09:17] our brother uh uh through this this this
[1:09:20] this thought of emotional leakage. Uh at
[1:09:23] some point in time, we got to say the
[1:09:25] buck stops here. Is not going to go any
[1:09:26] further. It's not going to go into the
[1:09:28] next generation. I'm not going to have
[1:09:31] that in my my kids or my grandkids. I'm
[1:09:33] not going to be looking at everybody
[1:09:35] else. I mean, family functions and
[1:09:38] everybody just screaming and yelling and
[1:09:40] oh my just chaos all over the place. You
[1:09:44] don't want that for your for your
[1:09:45] family. But it starts with us. We have
[1:09:48] to be the ones to make the difference.
[1:09:50] Brother Mark, God bless you. Uh thank
[1:09:52] you my brother for
[1:09:55] sharing this sermon with us tonight.
[1:09:58] Amen. The Lord is the Lord is good. The
[1:10:01] Lord is good. Oh my. I feel like I've
[1:10:04] been washed by the water of the word. I
[1:10:08] done come to church and took a spiritual
[1:10:10] shower. Been washed by the water of the
[1:10:12] word.
[1:10:13] Glory to God. Oo boy. And when you when
[1:10:17] you submit yourself to the wash and you
[1:10:19] just feel a lot better. Amen. You get
[1:10:22] clean, spiritually clean, you know. So
[1:10:24] that was just that's just that's that
[1:10:26] was wonderful. That was Hallelujah.
[1:10:29] Hallelujah. Amen. Let me uh try to read
[1:10:32] uh these announcements. Amen. that we
[1:10:34] have um

[1:11:06] Amen. Uh don't forget South Florida
[1:11:08] Choir Rehearsal. That's this Saturday,
[1:11:10] June 28th. Then another one July 5th and
[1:11:13] July 12th. It's going to be hosted at
[1:11:15] Bride of Christ Tabernacle at 6:00 p.m.
[1:11:17] there in Boon Beach as we prepare for
[1:11:20] our meetings coming up July 25th through
[1:11:22] 27th and our Restore Sea of the Lord
[1:11:25] meetings. And and I I I I trust I know
[1:11:27] that our deacon mentioned this to us at
[1:11:29] the um at the business meeting. Um, if
[1:11:33] you got vacation days on your job, a
[1:11:37] good time to take those vacation days is
[1:11:40] during our meetings. That way you don't
[1:11:43] have to be uh conflicting with work, you
[1:11:45] know, on the day of the meeting. I can't
[1:11:47] come. I'm working. Do you have any
[1:11:49] vacation days that I mean, did you can
[1:11:52] you use any of them for this? Because um
[1:11:56] and and I and I trust that you would use
[1:11:57] it for this. You know, I really I
[1:11:59] realize you also want to go on vacation.
[1:12:01] and God will bless you to be able to do
[1:12:02] that. But this is very important that
[1:12:04] everybody make themselves available, be
[1:12:06] ready to do whatever is necessary uh for
[1:12:09] the meetings. We have a lot of people
[1:12:10] that are coming here uh to to our area
[1:12:13] and um and we want to just make
[1:12:16] ourselves available, you know, uh so
[1:12:18] that we can we can get in wherever we
[1:12:20] fit in and uh just make our guests feel
[1:12:23] right at home. Uh there there you'll see
[1:12:26] there's going to be a lot to do um when
[1:12:28] uh when we when we get there to the day
[1:12:30] like I'm the the the 24th.
[1:12:33] Um, most brothers I haven't let this I
[1:12:35] mean we're going to be doing a setup on
[1:12:37] the 24th between 2 uh p.m. and 6:00 p.m.
[1:12:41] We have to go and get the video
[1:12:43] equipment set up uh the uh instrument
[1:12:46] setup which means we got to go get
[1:12:48] instruments out of storage, bring them
[1:12:51] to the stage, uh put them up and pastor
[1:12:54] can't do that by itself.
[1:12:57] Amen. So, uh, if you can get the 24th,
[1:13:02] 25th, 26th, 27th, and 28th off because
[1:13:08] you know what happened on the 28th? We
[1:13:10] got to break down, right? So, we need
[1:13:13] help. So, I'm just asking, please
[1:13:15] consider, you know, taking vacation time
[1:13:18] uh during this time so that you can be
[1:13:21] available to help uh during the
[1:13:23] meetings. It's going to be very, very
[1:13:26] important. Uh we have our giving uh we
[1:13:29] have uh multiple ways to give online. We
[1:13:31] have zel, we have PayPal, we have cash
[1:13:33] app. Preferred method is always zel
[1:13:35] because they don't take fees. Uh but if
[1:13:38] you have to use uh PayPal or cash app,
[1:13:40] we understand. Uh if you want to use zel
[1:13:42] or PayPal, it's going to be giving at
[1:13:43] john423.org.
[1:13:45] Cash app would be dollar sign spirit and
[1:13:47] trutht and our mailing address is there

[1:13:50] desire to mail an offering in, those
[1:13:52] that are inside the sanctuary, we do
[1:13:54] have a box in the back that you can use
[1:13:56] for your giving. Amen. Uh I think that's
[1:14:00] all that I need to mention. Uh there we
[1:14:03] do have some guests I uh some ministers
[1:14:06] that'll be passing our way. Two brothers
[1:14:09] coming from Nigeria. Uh they just happen
[1:14:13] to be passing right around the same
[1:14:15] time. One brother, brother J. Ketta will
[1:14:17] be with us on Sunday
[1:14:21] uh the July is it 13th? Is that the
[1:14:25] right? July 13th. And uh so brother Jes
[1:14:29] will be with us on Sunday July 13th. And
[1:14:31] then brother Gideon uh will be coming on
[1:14:34] that Wednesday night uh July 15th I
[1:14:37] believe that's correct. So, we do have
[1:14:39] two guest ministers that'll be passing
[1:14:41] our way uh shortly and preparing us for
[1:14:46] the guests that we we'll be receiving uh
[1:14:49] for our meetings. Amen. Praise God. Uh
[1:14:52] all right. Before we would depart
[1:14:55] tonight, does anyone have a prayer
[1:14:57] request or a um praise report that you
[1:15:03] want to make mention of? and we will
[1:15:07] Okay, I got a couple hands over here.
[1:15:16] God bless church. I'm requesting prayer.
[1:15:18] My family and I are doing a family
[1:15:21] getaway this weekend and requesting your
[1:15:23] prayer for traveling mercy.
[1:15:28] Amen. Um I just want to thank the church
[1:15:31] for prayers for my brother. Um he was
[1:15:34] released from the hospital on Friday
[1:15:38] evening. So um he is doing better on his
[1:15:40] way to recovery. Um just pray that you
[1:15:43] know he can get himself back up and to
[1:15:46] work to be able to support himself.
[1:15:56] God bless you. I have a praise report.
[1:15:58] So um on sister's prayer I had asked for
[1:16:01] prayer um because I had been given a
[1:16:05] um full full ride like they're going to
[1:16:08] pay 100% of my uh master's degree and I
[1:16:11] was trying to find um the college um
[1:16:15] that I needed to go to and I only had a
[1:16:16] month to do it. So um we we had prayed
[1:16:20] for that at sister's prayer and the very
[1:16:22] next day um uh one of the colleges had
[1:16:25] called me. It was a private Christian
[1:16:27] university and they had every single box
[1:16:31] checked like everything that I needed
[1:16:34] and then um there were some
[1:16:35] prerequisites that I had to take because
[1:16:37] my my masters is completely different
[1:16:39] from my bachelor's. So um there were
[1:16:42] three prerequisites that I needed and I
[1:16:44] kept calling around at different
[1:16:45] colleges and I couldn't find them. And
[1:16:48] so um I had gotten on the phone with the
[1:16:50] adviser for the college I'm going to and
[1:16:53] um
[1:16:55] and I had told her I was like well I
[1:16:58] just said a prayer and you know it's
[1:16:59] going to happen and I'm like an hour
[1:17:01] later um found on the internet this
[1:17:05] college it had every single prerequisite
[1:17:07] that I needed eightweek courses all
[1:17:09] online everything that I needed. It was
[1:17:11] just so perfect how it was laid out. So
[1:17:13] now I already set everything up with my
[1:17:16] advisor. So they're paying for the
[1:17:19] college, everything included, books,
[1:17:21] everything. And they're paying me every
[1:17:23] month to go to college.
[1:17:27] [Applause]
[1:17:33] Well, praise the Lord.
[1:17:36] That that's an overflow right there. My
[1:17:39] God.
[1:17:41] my pay for everything and pay me to
[1:17:44] attend. Sign me up.
[1:17:49] Praise the Lord. Anybody else? Uh prayer
[1:17:52] request, praise report.
[1:17:54] All right. Okay. Um let's take these
[1:17:59] requests to the Lord in prayer um
[1:18:03] tonight.
[1:18:05] And your sister Virginia, your brother,
[1:18:07] brother Eugene.
[1:18:08] Okay. All right. Let's pray. Father, we
[1:18:11] are grateful for
[1:18:14] um the word that we heard here tonight.
[1:18:16] Just what a what a blessing it is to
[1:18:20] Lord just be able to uh learn from
[1:18:22] somebody else's experience. See how um
[1:18:26] these things can impact not just brother
[1:18:28] Mark but father by him sharing it these
[1:18:31] it positively impacts everybody else in
[1:18:34] here. Uh so God, we thank you for a
[1:18:37] release and for freedom that has come
[1:18:39] into this place tonight through the word
[1:18:41] of the Lord. Uh the scripture says ye
[1:18:44] shall know the truth and the truth will
[1:18:47] make you free. So I pray that we would
[1:18:49] walk in that freedom. We thank you for
[1:18:52] God these testimonies that we've heard
[1:18:54] as we prayed for uh Eugene. God, you
[1:18:57] have touched him and you've allowed him
[1:19:00] to be released from the hospital and and
[1:19:02] God, we know that you brought him this
[1:19:04] far that you will continue to carry
[1:19:06] forward that he'd be be have have his
[1:19:09] strength completely renewed that he'd be
[1:19:10] able to get back to work and do all the
[1:19:12] things that he needs to do to take care
[1:19:13] of himself. Uh but we thank you for the
[1:19:16] journey thus far. Uh you have proven
[1:19:18] yourself once again to this family and
[1:19:20] God may you just continue to get glory
[1:19:22] in this situation. Thank you for what
[1:19:24] you've also done for Sister Amanda. uh
[1:19:26] the sisters gathered together in prayer
[1:19:29] and um Lord as we were in prayer last
[1:19:32] night with the brothers just sharing um
[1:19:35] our prayers are fervent and effectual.
[1:19:40] Uh the scripture says the fervent and
[1:19:42] effectual prayer of the righteous man
[1:19:43] avaleth much which means it has power.
[1:19:47] Prayer has power to change any situation
[1:19:51] any circumstance. It's the greatest
[1:19:53] weapon that we have in our possession is
[1:19:57] to be able to pray. Even the prophet
[1:19:58] said when the weakest Christian hits
[1:20:01] their knees in prayer, all hell begins
[1:20:04] to shake because they realize the power
[1:20:07] that is in um a a a Christian coming in
[1:20:11] contact with their God. So, Father, let
[1:20:13] us not take these things lightly, but
[1:20:15] help us to realize, Lord, that it our
[1:20:17] prayers do avail much. And Lord, as uh
[1:20:21] we we've seen this in um uh Eugene, we
[1:20:25] also seen it in Sister Amanda's
[1:20:26] situation. The sisters came together,
[1:20:28] prayed for her, and look at how you just
[1:20:31] worked everything out. A full ride
[1:20:33] scholarship. Uh even the prerequisites
[1:20:36] that she needed, you found you allowed
[1:20:38] her to find that. And uh and oh God, um
[1:20:42] not only just give her a full
[1:20:43] scholarship, but they pay for the books
[1:20:44] and and and the and the class, but they
[1:20:47] even pay her to go to school. Lord, this
[1:20:49] is truly exceeding uh abundant above all
[1:20:54] she could ask or think. So, we thank you
[1:20:56] for manifesting yourself uh on her
[1:20:58] behalf. And God, that's encouraging to
[1:21:00] so many. We we don't know what people
[1:21:02] are going through, but they know that if
[1:21:04] you could do that for her, then what can
[1:21:05] you do for others? Lord, we pray for
[1:21:08] Sister Brown and her family as they
[1:21:10] prepare for this trip, Lord, that
[1:21:12] they're going to take and or as they're
[1:21:14] getting away. We ask that you would just
[1:21:16] be with them. uh bless their time
[1:21:18] together. May you watch over their homes
[1:21:20] while they're away from their homes. And
[1:21:22] oh God, may um Lord, may it just be a
[1:21:24] time of refreshing and renewing. And uh
[1:21:27] we just ask, oh God, that you would
[1:21:28] bring them back safely as the saints,
[1:21:30] Lord, prepare to leave this place
[1:21:32] tonight. Uh we ask that you would go
[1:21:34] with us, that you would keep us until
[1:21:35] we're able to come back together again
[1:21:37] on Sunday. And trusting, oh God, that
[1:21:39] you would meet us here once more. Uh is
[1:21:42] our desire and it's our prayer. It's in
[1:21:44] Jesus Christ's name that we pray. Amen.
[1:21:48] Amen. God bless you. Uh the brothers
[1:21:51] will come at this time to dismiss you.
[1:21:54] Amen. God bless you.
