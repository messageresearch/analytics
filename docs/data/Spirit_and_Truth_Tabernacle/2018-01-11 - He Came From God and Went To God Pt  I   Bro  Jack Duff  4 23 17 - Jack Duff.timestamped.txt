[57:00] believe God put that in their spirit and
[57:03] she just you know left through the week
[57:05] and had that her spirit and just began
[57:07] to just declare that right at that very
[57:09] very special moment I just thought that
[57:13] was just something very beautiful you
[57:17] know just just hearing them and you know
[57:21] brother Darrell there's much you know
[57:29] that could be said and I'm sure that
[57:30] many you know we'll have a lot of things
[57:32] to say but but I will say this God
[57:36] remembers your kindness to the brides
[57:40] God remembers your kindness to the bride
[57:44] and there was a time not many people
[57:47] even noticed my first time probably was
[57:48] sharing it with you one of the family
[57:53] home going services that I had to preach
[57:56] and I can't remember exactly whether it
[57:59] was whether it was mother Tillman or if
[58:03] it was brother Brown I'm not not sure
[58:06] but I remember after the service I was
[58:08] just at the house with the family and my
[58:11] brother Darrell walked up and shook my
[58:13] hand but when he shook my hand he had
[58:16] something in his hand shaking my hand
[58:19] and I just said I just appreciate you
[58:22] just gave it to him and just moved on
[58:25] didn't say a word and I never said a
[58:27] word just said thank you but I'll tell
[58:29] you what God remembers that and that
[58:35] what you do unto the least of these my
[58:37] little ones you've done unto me
[58:42] so search I'm encouraged and I like to
[58:48] say that brother Darrell got drafted you
[58:57] got drafted a man we just thank the Lord
[59:03] keep the family in prayer we'll get
[59:07] information to you as Morris release

[1:00:59] this time I want to read a couple
[1:01:01] scriptures just a little something that
[1:01:03] the Lord at placed in my heart I've been
[1:01:05] dealing with this doubt for a little bit
[1:01:07] and and I've just a couple things that
[1:01:11] happened this week and you know I felt
[1:01:13] that it was necessary for me to kind of
[1:01:14] go down this path and and going this way
[1:01:18] just kind of re-establishing troops we
[1:01:22] already know these things some of the
[1:01:24] things that I'll speak on this morning
[1:01:25] but it's just reiterating and
[1:01:28] reestablished these things and and for
[1:01:30] those that may have not heard it may be
[1:01:32] would be something that would you know
[1:01:34] just kind of help you along the journey
[1:01:36] and I know that there are people that I
[1:01:38] listen to you know us on the radio as
[1:01:40] well as on the internet and we just want
[1:01:43] to bring truth to people that's that's
[1:01:45] what the whole objective is you know I
[1:01:48] mean because if you know the truth the
[1:01:49] truth will make you free a man if the
[1:01:52] truth that does dance a man you can jump
[1:01:55] and shout but even got no truth you're
[1:01:57] not gonna be anchored that devil will
[1:01:59] bun rush you beat you down right so but
[1:02:04] we we need to be established in truth
[1:02:07] and and and so this morning we will be
[1:02:10] bringing out some things like I say most
[1:02:11] of you will be familiar with this but
[1:02:13] there might be others that are not so a
[1:02:14] man it would be you know it it's gonna
[1:02:19] be necessary listen
[1:02:20] that way hit belief when necessary but
[1:02:22] let's let's read a couple scriptures a
[1:02:24] man I want to read from first Timothy of
[1:02:26] chapter 3 and then also from John
[1:02:29] chapter 13 will read from the scriptures
[1:02:32] and and keep your Bibles close to you
[1:02:35] because later on the nasarah I will pull
[1:02:38] a lot of Scripture a man that we will
[1:02:41] will go through so praise the Lord Amen
[1:02:46] first Timothy 3 and verse 13 says
[1:02:48] without controversy great is the mystery
[1:02:52] of godliness God was manifest in the
[1:02:56] flesh God noticed that God was manifest
[1:03:02] in the flesh justified in the spirit
[1:03:05] seen of angels preached unto the
[1:03:09] Gentiles believed on in the world
[1:03:11] received up into glory wait a minute
[1:03:15] God was or Jesus was which one
[1:03:19] I mean God was received up into glory or
[1:03:23] was Jesus received up into glory right
[1:03:26] we we need to know these things
[1:03:27] a man hallelujah I can tell you both of
[1:03:31] them was God was received up and Jesus
[1:03:38] was received up why because Jesus is
[1:03:40] God's glory hallelujah alright let's go
[1:03:45] on a man over here to John 13 and let's
[1:03:49] just read a passage from there praise
[1:03:52] the Lord
[1:03:53] a man John 13 and I'll start at verse 1
[1:03:58] this particular passage deals with the
[1:04:02] communion amen this is a scripture that
[1:04:05] we we use for communion especially when
[1:04:08] it comes time to the feet washing
[1:04:10] portion of the service a man and and
[1:04:16] Jesus did this and I just I'm always
[1:04:18] amazed by seeing the Creator a man come
[1:04:24] down to his creation and get so humbled
[1:04:27] that he will wash their feet right I
[1:04:31] mean the same people that he created now
[1:04:33] he's so
[1:04:34] humble that he comes down he washes
[1:04:35] their feet what a what a very special
[1:04:38] moment this was seeing you know God do
[1:04:41] that it just shows one of the that the
[1:04:45] attribute that was in God to want to be
[1:04:48] a father right and to want to have
[1:04:50] children to want to be connected to his
[1:04:52] children it shows this when we look at
[1:04:54] things like this in Scripture but here
[1:04:57] in verse one John 13 says now before the
[1:05:00] Feast of the Passover when Jesus knew
[1:05:03] that his hour was come that he should
[1:05:05] depart out of this world unto the father
[1:05:08] having loved his own which were in the
[1:05:11] world he loved them unto the end so now
[1:05:14] we know Jesus was received up into glory
[1:05:16] and now the Scriptures tell us that
[1:05:18] Jesus is a part of going back to the
[1:05:20] Father okay and it says here and supper
[1:05:24] being ended the devil having now put
[1:05:26] into the heart of Judas Iscariot Simon's
[1:05:28] son to betray him Jesus knowing that the
[1:05:32] father had given all things into his
[1:05:34] hands and that he was come from God and
[1:05:38] went to God right the Bible goes on to
[1:05:42] say he rose from supper and laid aside
[1:05:44] his garments and took a town gird
[1:05:46] himself after that he poured water into
[1:05:48] a basin began to wash the disciples feet
[1:05:50] and to wipe them with a towel wherewith
[1:05:53] he was girded let's pray father we thank
[1:05:56] you for the reading of the word now may
[1:06:01] the Holy Spirit come and help us to
[1:06:03] understand what it is that we have read
[1:06:06] and may you father get all the glory and
[1:06:09] all the honor out of this portion of the
[1:06:11] service thank you God for all that you
[1:06:13] have done and we also Lord just wanna
[1:06:16] take a moment to remember a man of the
[1:06:19] rudolph family in our prayers that god
[1:06:22] you would certainly strengthen them
[1:06:24] sister Linda is in need of you and only
[1:06:28] you God can provide what she needs only
[1:06:31] you can give her the comfort we we all
[1:06:33] have words and things that we can try to
[1:06:35] share but only people that have been
[1:06:38] there and done that can really
[1:06:40] understand you know what it's all about
[1:06:42] and and we know that if you're able to
[1:06:45] turn our mourning
[1:06:46] into dancing then you can do the same
[1:06:47] thing for her and as the song say your
[1:06:51] light in the darkness so in this dark
[1:06:53] situation father may somebody recognize
[1:06:56] Christ and may they be drawn to the
[1:06:58] light of your grace in the midst of it
[1:07:00] we know that your God we know that
[1:07:02] you're in control we know that you don't
[1:07:03] make mistakes and and we declare you are
[1:07:06] still away maker
[1:07:07] a promise keeper you're a miracle worker
[1:07:11] you're all that and we just appreciate
[1:07:14] you for who you are
[1:07:15] so now bless us God as we enter into
[1:07:17] this stuff today in Jesus name we pray
[1:07:19] amen amen god bless you can be seated
[1:07:23] praise the Lord amen
[1:07:27] we'd like to use for our subject today
[1:07:30] he came from God and went to God and man
[1:07:35] he came from God and went to God very
[1:07:44] you know when we just kind of think
[1:07:46] about these words that Jesus said he
[1:07:49] says I came from God and in verse 3 says
[1:07:53] Jesus knowing that the father given all
[1:07:55] things into his hands and that he was
[1:07:57] come from God and went to God also when
[1:08:01] we read there in and Timothy chapter 3 -
[1:08:07] praise the Lord a man we read there in
[1:08:16] Timothy chapter 3 verse 16 without
[1:08:19] controversy great is the mystery of
[1:08:21] godliness God was manifest in the flesh
[1:08:23] justified in the spirit seen of angels
[1:08:26] preached unto the Gentiles believed on
[1:08:29] in the world received up into glory and
[1:08:31] I'm just trying to tie these things
[1:08:32] together that's why I asked the question
[1:08:35] say now now now the Bible says that God
[1:08:37] was received up into glory and if we're
[1:08:40] taking it for what it is we know that
[1:08:42] Jesus was the one that was received up
[1:08:45] into glory so you have to yet the
[1:08:48] questions acts well how can alright
[1:08:51] these words you know here in the book of
[1:08:52] Timothy that that God was received up
[1:08:55] into glory it's because Paul had a
[1:08:57] revelation that jeez
[1:08:59] just was god right it's not that we got
[1:09:03] three different gods a man Jesus was God
[1:09:08] hallelujah amen you know and I find this
[1:09:12] I mean to me it's just very important I
[1:09:14] was having a conversation with you know
[1:09:17] a couple different people this week and
[1:09:18] you know one of the one of the things
[1:09:20] that I was sharing a man with somebody
[1:09:22] was you know just on the on the a thing
[1:09:25] of baptism and what that you know what
[1:09:27] that means you know and I was just kind
[1:09:30] of telling them you know when you get
[1:09:32] baptized make sure you get baptized in
[1:09:34] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:35] all rights and make sure it's done in
[1:09:37] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I
[1:09:39] started walking them through the
[1:09:40] scripture you know I say now why would
[1:09:42] Jesus make the statement baptize in the
[1:09:45] name of the Father and of the Son and of
[1:09:48] the Holy Spirit you know the Holy Ghost
[1:09:50] you know but then ten days later Peter
[1:09:52] comes along and he says baptize in the
[1:09:54] name of the Lord Jesus Christ I say now
[1:09:57] why would Peter say that that's not
[1:09:59] actually questioning one person say that
[1:10:00] Peter have it wrong and they say yeah
[1:10:02] Peter had it wrong that's it's not wait
[1:10:04] a minute yeah oh yeah yeah what y'all
[1:10:06] say that Peter had it wrong then now
[1:10:08] you're saying that the Word of God is
[1:10:09] contradicting itself and you think God
[1:10:12] put something in this scripture right
[1:10:14] that that that actually would allow
[1:10:17] people to you know feel like it was
[1:10:19] contradictory God don't work that way
[1:10:21] amen what happened is that Peter caught
[1:10:23] a revelation of who the father was who
[1:10:25] the son was and who the Holy Ghost was
[1:10:28] and Peter said baptized in the name the
[1:10:30] name was the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:10:32] hallelujah you know and I was telling us
[1:10:35] first I say now I you know so be sure
[1:10:37] that they do this to you don't go down
[1:10:39] in the water if they don't if they're
[1:10:41] not gonna do it that way and now they
[1:10:43] went down in the water and got baptized
[1:10:44] in the name you know and the name of
[1:10:46] father name is son name and holding us I
[1:10:49] said now let me give you an example here
[1:10:50] let me try to take this little further
[1:10:51] that's that just arranged a I got an
[1:10:54] agreement that I just signed and and it
[1:10:57] got our church name on it and and if we
[1:11:00] got a we established a little
[1:11:02] relationship with the hotel a local
[1:11:05] hotel and and for the meetings that
[1:11:07] we're gonna be hosting in June we're
[1:11:09] saying hey if anybody calls in from
[1:11:12] you know from that church and they need
[1:11:15] a room and they call and put an ax for
[1:11:17] the name of the group the group name
[1:11:19] further for the room that's the rooms
[1:11:20] that a block say then they should get
[1:11:22] the special ring but you got to know the
[1:11:24] group name alright I say now you go down
[1:11:30] to that hotel I just told you that I
[1:11:32] created this down there

[1:11:35] hotel and you say now now I'm coming in

[1:11:40] group rate with your hotel you know in
[1:11:42] order to get that special rate they

[1:12:45] what his name is understand what Jesus
[1:12:48] was talking about the church world has
[1:12:50] gotten so far off from these things and
[1:12:52] you know and I was just being I was
[1:12:54] telling another person this week I said
[1:12:56] you know cuz they were they were telling
[1:12:58] me how you know God's been so good to
[1:13:00] them and and and does so much for them
[1:13:02] and deliver them from cancer and and so
[1:13:05] many other things that God brought them
[1:13:06] back from and you know I mean close to
[1:13:08] death multiple times but God kept
[1:13:10] bringing them back and say you know even
[1:13:12] though they are on they're serving the
[1:13:14] Lord and and and even had an experience
[1:13:16] with God as they were driving the car
[1:13:18] this week ever said how the Holy Spirit
[1:13:20] came down in the presence of the car and
[1:13:22] they just began to worship so with by
[1:13:25] the time they
[1:13:25] got to work they like man I gotta
[1:13:27] straighten myself up because I can't go
[1:13:29] in there like this so they was trying to
[1:13:31] give himself out fixed up in the car I

[1:14:14] financially I got this but I just don't
[1:14:16] feel complete so I said well you know
[1:14:19] the only way you're gonna feel complete
[1:14:20] is that you begin to walk in the full
[1:14:23] truth hey man they say what you mean
[1:14:27] walking in the full truth I say I said
[1:14:30] you know you say the Bible say that ye
[1:14:32] shall know the truth and the truth will
[1:14:34] make you breathe you can have the walk
[1:14:36] in the full truth and northern feel true
[1:14:39] amen completeness in Christ listen
[1:14:41] tonight what what you mean I said what
[1:14:43] can you ask that question I gotta break
[1:14:45] it down God sent a profit and that
[1:14:48] profit came back with the restoration of
[1:14:51] the word of God and until you can come
[1:14:52] back to that complete restoration of the
[1:14:55] Word of God and stand in that you will
[1:14:57] never be complete so it's people
[1:15:01] listening to this on the radio right now
[1:15:03] right they listen to it they don't feel
[1:15:06] complete the reason they don't feel
[1:15:07] complete because they have not come to
[1:15:09] complete truth oh my you're walking in
[1:15:13] that which is parked but when that which
[1:15:16] is in part has been done away with then
[1:15:19] that which is perfect has come and you
[1:15:21] can walk in that church Oh hallelujah
[1:15:24] hallelujah hallelujah so you know we
[1:15:27] realized that there's a there's a reason
[1:15:30] Amen that we follow things that we
[1:15:32] follow that we believe what we believe
[1:15:34] God God sent this so that we would we
[1:15:36] will find our way by out of this
[1:15:38] the the maze of christendom if I can
[1:15:42] just put it that way ain't nothing but a
[1:15:43] big maze and we don't run into a lot of
[1:15:45] dead ends amen and we have to turn
[1:15:48] around and go back the other way but you
[1:15:50] know as we as we as we find our way
[1:15:52] through the maze God as God has made a
[1:15:54] way through the word that's been
[1:15:56] presented to us now we can find our way
[1:15:58] out don't worry - god I want to just
[1:16:00] kind of just keep working with this a
[1:16:02] little bit he came from God and went to
[1:16:05] God now Jesus makes this statement you
[1:16:08] know right at the time that he's having
[1:16:11] communion and feet washing with the
[1:16:13] disciples and and here you know we can
[1:16:16] we can now wait a minute how could he
[1:16:19] say something like this I came from God
[1:16:22] and I'm going to God then that night now
[1:16:26] at the average church they have Jesus
[1:16:30] sitting on the right hand of the Father
[1:16:31] that the average church got Jesus
[1:16:35] sitting on the right hand in front and
[1:16:36] they leaving them there right now the
[1:16:39] first thing I want to tell you that God
[1:16:41] don't have right head and left hand like
[1:16:43] we have it we're talking about God God
[1:16:47] is a spirit so when the Bible say it
[1:16:49] sitting at the right hand of God it's
[1:16:51] not talking about heads like ours but
[1:16:53] it's talking about a place of power and
[1:16:56] authority and that's why when you pray
[1:16:59] you gotta pray in the name of Jesus not
[1:17:02] in the name of the Father not in the
[1:17:04] name of the son not in the name of only
[1:17:06] ghost you gotta pray in the name of
[1:17:08] Jesus if you want to see results
[1:17:11] ask the Father anything in my name you
[1:17:14] had to know his name come on somebody
[1:17:17] you got to know his name what is the
[1:17:20] name of the Father what is the name of
[1:17:23] the son what is the name of the Holy
[1:17:25] Ghost his name is Jesus Christ all right
[1:17:30] all right all right but he says this I
[1:17:32] came from God and I'm going I'm going
[1:17:37] back I went to God right I come from God
[1:17:40] and I'm going back to God I went to God
[1:17:41] he's giving us you know these these
[1:17:43] things you might well now how how did he
[1:17:46] come from God how how did he come from
[1:17:49] God how is he going back to God and it
[1:17:51] like I said
[1:17:52] not just we know the scripture speaks of
[1:17:54] the right hand of power you know but I
[1:17:56] mean Jesus sitting under our hands but
[1:17:58] we know by revelation is the right hand
[1:18:00] of power right it's a place of authority
[1:18:02] that Jesus sits hey man hey man so now
[1:18:06] when we look at this you know just a
[1:18:08] little closer and they says I come from
[1:18:10] God what where and how did he come from
[1:18:13] God we have to go all the way back to
[1:18:15] the beginning of Genesis you know why 1
[1:18:19] and when you start just reading there in
[1:18:21] the book of Genesis I've mentioned this
[1:18:22] multiple times but I said again say when
[1:18:25] you look at Genesis when he says let
[1:18:28] there be light that first light that
[1:18:31] came out was s/o in light hallelujah not
[1:18:37] su in light because when you read your
[1:18:41] Bible you get down to the fourth day
[1:18:43] you'll see that God made to greater
[1:18:46] lights one to rule the day and one to
[1:18:49] rule the night anybody can recognize
[1:18:52] that that is the Sun to rule the day and
[1:18:54] the moon to rule the night anybody can
[1:18:58] recognize that well if the Sun and Moon
[1:19:00] did not come into existence to the
[1:19:01] fourth day what came into existence when
[1:19:05] he said let there be light
[1:19:08] what what came it takes instance then
[1:19:10] see we always looked at as that was to
[1:19:13] su in I'm here to tell you this one and
[1:19:16] no that was he s OE oh you don't believe
[1:19:23] it well we got our we got a a personal
[1:19:29] scripture that tells us what that it was
[1:19:31] and after Jesus had died rose again and
[1:19:36] we got a guy crucifying I mean actually
[1:19:38] one that wanting to kill Christians by
[1:19:40] the name of song and he's on his road to
[1:19:43] Damascus he's gotta let us in his hand
[1:19:46] anybody don't believe the way I believe
[1:19:49] my he's gonna kill him right so Paul got
[1:19:53] the letters in his hand and and Paul
[1:19:55] gets knocked off his high horse and as
[1:19:58] he's knocked down off his high horse
[1:19:59] here Paul has an experience that he
[1:20:02] places in the Bible and Paul says
[1:20:05] you know he sees a great light so that
[1:20:08] first s o in light was a great light it
[1:20:13] could be seen it could be identified not
[1:20:15] only that he could speak back to you
[1:20:21] because Paul begin to speak to the s o
[1:20:24] in light this light that Paul saw was
[1:20:27] greater a private in the Sun come on
[1:20:30] church it was brighter than the SU in he
[1:20:33] was looking at the SOE and as they begin
[1:20:36] to conversate Paul asked the question
[1:20:40] who art thou Lord the light spoke back
[1:20:44] to Paul it says I am Jesus well that's
[1:20:50] the same light out of Genesis 1 when he
[1:20:53] said let there be light
[1:20:55] Oh blessed be the name of the Lord it's
[1:20:57] right there in the Bible glory to God so
[1:21:00] we got to understand the light when he
[1:21:02] said I come from God you know God was if
[1:21:05] we just give you a little picture here
[1:21:07] God was not even God until they had
[1:21:11] something to worship Him he was L owe
[1:21:13] him the self-existing one he was all by
[1:21:18] himself but trapped inside of God was
[1:21:21] some thoughts hey there's some
[1:21:23] attributes that wanted to be expressed
[1:21:26] and they say the first thing I needed
[1:21:28] something to worship me I can't even be
[1:21:29] God until I got something to worship
[1:21:32] while he created angels angels came
[1:21:35] forth and they began to worship Him and
[1:21:37] that was that was real good but God
[1:21:39] still has the most stuff in him that he
[1:21:41] wanted to release and the only way he
[1:21:43] can get it released is that other things
[1:21:45] have to happen on this earth for that to
[1:21:47] occur my god let's just kind of pick
[1:21:50] this up glory glory glory glory glory
[1:21:53] amen amen amen let me just let me find
[1:22:00] something here let me start with the
[1:22:03] identified Christ of all ages glory to
[1:22:05] God a man just taking you on a little
[1:22:08] journey here glory hallelujah
[1:22:11] it says now God is great like a great
[1:22:14] being says in the beginning God see he
[1:22:18] wasn't even God
[1:22:19] to begin with God is an object of
[1:22:21] worship and he was called there was
[1:22:23] nothing to worship he was self-existent
[1:22:26] Elohim and there wasn't nothing to
[1:22:28] worship him when he created angels den
[1:22:30] there was something to worship Him but
[1:22:33] in this Great God Elohim was attributes
[1:22:36] there was absolute sin there to be God
[1:22:40] there was attributes and there to be God
[1:22:42] attributes to be father attributes to be
[1:22:46] son attributes to be savior attributes
[1:22:50] to be healer now you know this attribute
[1:22:53] that God wanted to be a son now the
[1:22:56] average person if I gave that to
[1:22:58] Mitchell well that was manifested when
[1:23:00] Adam came for if no no no it wasn't
[1:23:03] manifested when Adam came forth it was
[1:23:05] manifest when he said let there be light
[1:23:07] that's when the s om came out hallelujah
[1:23:13] that attribute was manifested when the s
[1:23:16] om came out and let me just go on a
[1:23:19] little further here so you can see what
[1:23:20] I'm what I'm saying here it says there
[1:23:23] was attributes there to be God
[1:23:24] attributes the attributes are to be
[1:23:26] father attributes to be son attributes
[1:23:29] to be say the attributes to be healer
[1:23:30] all these attributes was in God and if
[1:23:33] you've ever got eternal life you were in
[1:23:36] God's attributes because you got eternal
[1:23:39] life Jesus came as Redeemer and redeemed
[1:23:42] means bring it back to where it started
[1:23:44] from right you were in God's thinking he
[1:23:49] might have to breathe this with that and
[1:23:52] down here and down here like a man
[1:23:55] making child for the church puts in so
[1:23:57] much brass and so much iron gets it just
[1:23:59] right I've just just at the right pitch
[1:24:01] the molder knows how to put it in if he
[1:24:04] does it he doesn't get the right ring
[1:24:06] and what we're trying to do for the
[1:24:08] church is get the right ring hey man we
[1:24:12] get the right ring is talking about
[1:24:14] Jesus being God not having three guys
[1:24:17] that's the wrong ring we want to get the
[1:24:19] church back to the right ring Oh
[1:24:21] hallelujah hallelujah I got I got a
[1:24:24] little bit more than I want to read amen
[1:24:25] on this I want to go questions and
[1:24:28] answers on Genesis praise the Lord the
[1:24:32] Prophet says
[1:24:33] and questions and answers on Genesis
[1:24:35] says now God created man in his own
[1:24:37] image and in his own likeness
[1:24:39] what kind of man did he create he says a
[1:24:43] spirit man now if you'll notice after
[1:24:45] you have made all the creation and
[1:24:47] created a spirit man the close reading
[1:24:51] of this now the be the one that's asked
[1:24:53] the question we found this that God
[1:24:55] gives a million of the cattle and the
[1:24:57] fishes and everything to the man but in
[1:25:00] in his making up there he made man in
[1:25:03] his own image to lead the cattle lead
[1:25:06] the beasts of the field a man just like
[1:25:09] the Holy Spirit leads the believer today
[1:25:11] so the first man that was made was a
[1:25:13] spirit man right so what I always like
[1:25:16] to say this when you're looking at me
[1:25:18] you're not really looking at the real me
[1:25:19] right there's something on the inside of
[1:25:22] me praise God that was made in God's
[1:25:25] image this right here this this could
[1:25:28] have been made that's the animals image
[1:25:29] but what's on the inside of me it's been
[1:25:31] made after God's image and what's on the
[1:25:33] inside of me has to dominate what's on
[1:25:35] the outside of me listen he says this he
[1:25:40] says he was in other words out on the
[1:25:42] first name in the lower creations of God
[1:25:44] the first creation was God himself then
[1:25:47] out of God came to logos that's what I'm
[1:25:50] getting that right there out of God came
[1:25:52] to logos that's the som that came out of
[1:25:55] God out of got so when he said let there
[1:25:57] be light out of God came the logos what
[1:25:59] was the logos it was a light right it
[1:26:02] was a light because god being a spirit
[1:26:04] we wouldn't be able to identify him so
[1:26:06] he had to go on a form that we could
[1:26:08] actually identify him we could actually
[1:26:10] you know I mean that's what the children
[1:26:12] Israel saw that was leaving them that
[1:26:14] logo stat like it was a pillar of cloud
[1:26:16] by day and a pillar of fire by night
[1:26:18] that's the same thing that Paul ran into
[1:26:21] on the road to Damascus it was the logos
[1:26:23] and then I could also be so Boaz the
[1:26:26] same thing that took a picture with
[1:26:27] brother Branham we see when you see the
[1:26:31] halo over brother branham's hair that's
[1:26:32] the logos that came out of God
[1:26:34] so unfortunately people get too mixed up
[1:26:38] on the Prophet but they fail to see the
[1:26:39] logos
[1:26:41] a man the the profit is underneath the
[1:26:46] locals understand that the logos is
[1:26:49] above the profit
[1:26:52] hallelujah amen so we want to put
[1:26:54] emphasis on the logos who we say I'm
[1:26:57] said we put emphasis on Jesus because he
[1:27:00] is the logos he's the one that came out
[1:27:03] of God and he's the one that way back to
[1:27:05] God hallelujah glory to God listen
[1:27:10] listen says the first creation was God
[1:27:12] of something out of God came the logos
[1:27:14] which was the son of God then out of
[1:27:16] logos which was the word in the
[1:27:17] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:27:18] with God and the Word was God and the
[1:27:20] Word was made flesh is what among us out
[1:27:22] and logos came forth the man out of the
[1:27:27] logos came forth the man just real quick
[1:27:31] just another statement that brother
[1:27:32] Branham made I won't pull this up he
[1:27:34] just says like God becoming God when he
[1:27:38] created angels he becomes son when he
[1:27:41] created Christ Jesus he become Savior
[1:27:44] when Jesus died he becomes healer when
[1:27:48] he was wounded for our transgressions
[1:27:50] and with His stripes we were healed
[1:27:52] those attributes were expressed at that
[1:27:54] time a man he becomes husband when he's
[1:27:58] married to you Oh glory to God amen God
[1:28:05] was not looking for a girlfriend he
[1:28:07] wanted a wife and he predestinated her
[1:28:12] oh my before the world even began he
[1:28:15] before she even came to urged he had a
[1:28:17] wedding band though the wedding band of
[1:28:20] Greece oh my god Church that's why the
[1:28:23] devil couldn't keep her you never belong
[1:28:25] him in the first place you always belong
[1:28:27] to God oh you come through this come
[1:28:32] through that doesn't matter what you
[1:28:33] come through you always belong to God's
[1:28:35] a man a man I see the same way that
[1:28:39] Jesus could say I come from God and I'm
[1:28:41] going that God we can say the same thing
[1:28:42] because we were attributes in his
[1:28:44] thinking we come from God and we're
[1:28:46] going back to God you know I was telling
[1:28:49] somebody recently you know God thought
[1:28:52] about you so much
[1:28:54] he thought about you so much that he
[1:28:57] created a man that would get an idea to
[1:29:00] create a chair because he knew that my
[1:29:05] wife wanted to sit on that chair the
[1:29:09] whole company was established with you
[1:29:11] in mind
[1:29:11] Oh y'all don't get that whatever the
[1:29:18] name of your company is the reason that
[1:29:20] they established is because you work
[1:29:22] there
[1:29:23] and God looted that company would have
[1:29:25] to be used to supply your needs the car
[1:29:32] that you drive he had somebody to silent
[1:29:34] anointed them to design it because he
[1:29:37] had you in mind he knew what you liked
[1:29:45] every detail God knows I mean every wife
[1:29:49] wants her husband to recognize the
[1:29:51] details right God knew your details and
[1:29:55] everything when this earth was designed
[1:29:57] to bring and then to bring comfort to
[1:29:59] you oh I just love him Church I love him
[1:30:04] a man I tell you what when we think
[1:30:09] about some of these things of what he he
[1:30:12] come from God he went to God he come
[1:30:14] from God not only did he come but we
[1:30:16] came from God and we're going back to
[1:30:18] God and if I could just put it this way
[1:30:20] you can't be lost
[1:30:27] impossible you know that this friend I
[1:30:30] was talking to this week is that I was
[1:30:31] here and I almost died with cancer and I
[1:30:34] was he almost died with this and I was
[1:30:36] here almost out you know you couldn't I
[1:30:38] mean until you come to a man understand
[1:30:42] of who you are in Christ you weren't
[1:30:43] going nowhere
[1:30:44] right I mean an addict at it as a young
[1:30:47] boy he might have remembered certain
[1:30:49] things but he was telling me say he said
[1:30:52] man I was just listening to the prophecy
[1:30:53] now you got to come back the truth and I
[1:30:55] said now what I mean by what really
[1:30:58] happened in the Garden of Eden what
[1:31:00] really happened he say well I was just
[1:31:02] listening to it this week and I heard
[1:31:04] brother Branham say now you talk truth
[1:31:06] why are you talking truth know what no
[1:31:09] Kyojin say what did the Prophet say
[1:31:12] about it he said I never heard these
[1:31:15] pains in all my life I say yeah you
[1:31:17] heard it you just didn't remember it he
[1:31:20] said that I heard brother Branham say it
[1:31:21] was a Daltrey I say oh yeah yeah are you
[1:31:24] talking something because now we go max
[1:31:28] why are there two genealogies in the
[1:31:30] book of Genesis wives John Cena Kane was
[1:31:35] up that wicked one why does the Bible
[1:31:39] say these things we gotta get back to
[1:31:41] truth I'm gonna tell you one thing we
[1:31:45] can't get it right in Genesis ain't no
[1:31:46] way we gonna have it right in Revelation
[1:31:52] we're trying to bring the church back
[1:31:55] man a man y'all just bear with me here
[1:31:58] today is we on a journey on a journey
[1:32:00] back a man even the Jews wanted to go
[1:32:04] back to their homeland what about the
[1:32:06] charge let's go back to what the
[1:32:09] scripture said that is our homeland hey
[1:32:13] man a man a man glory glory glory all
[1:32:16] right let me let me just go on a little
[1:32:19] further here we realize and as I was
[1:32:22] just sharing with him you know say that
[1:32:24] the way that we get back to truth is we
[1:32:27] have to follow what a prophecy it's
[1:32:29] telling another another young person I
[1:32:31] say you know you got any Bible you won't
[1:32:33] I have you got Thompson chain you got
[1:32:36] Scofield
[1:32:38] I got a Thomas somebody out of hock any
[1:32:43] now have to look at the beginning of to
[1:32:45] try to find but it's so many different
[1:32:47] manufacturers out there everybody got a
[1:32:49] Bible but if you're not care if you
[1:32:50] understand that the different
[1:32:52] manufacturers got different theologians
[1:32:53] that they agree with so they they're
[1:32:55] going to present the Bible in the way
[1:32:58] that they feel if you can present it so
[1:33:00] there's certain scriptures you start
[1:33:02] going through just studying your Bible
[1:33:03] you're just studying and then you get a
[1:33:05] scripture reference and you see what the
[1:33:07] theologian put there and you chase trace
[1:33:09] that reference sometimes it's spot on
[1:33:11] other times it's so far off you're like
[1:33:13] hi in the world what is that now the
[1:33:15] only way you'll know that is if you
[1:33:17] listen to the prophet then you can't you
[1:33:21] start catching things because see
[1:33:22] brother branham say after the seals were
[1:33:24] revealing say the bible became a new
[1:33:26] book so so when you listen to the
[1:33:31] prophet right the bible is the Bob will
[1:33:34] become a new book you can preach like
[1:33:37] the denominations preach you can't do
[1:33:39] that in the Bible's a new book you begin
[1:33:43] to see things and that is in my own
[1:33:45] Bible I start seeing things and read a
[1:33:47] minute that right there connect over
[1:33:48] here and I go and I look they don't have
[1:33:50] the reference but I right there
[1:33:52] representing myself because I know it's
[1:33:54] connected I'm not a theologian I'm just
[1:34:00] a bride and I know what my husband is
[1:34:03] writing to me in this love letter
[1:34:10] sellers say now see revelation 10 7 says
[1:34:14] in the days but in the days of the voice
[1:34:15] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[1:34:18] to sound the mystery of God should be
[1:34:20] finished as you have declared to his
[1:34:22] servants the prophets the Word of God
[1:34:24] come to a proper if if we look at
[1:34:27] scripture I'm especially Old Testament
[1:34:29] written by prophets Isaiah prophet
[1:34:31] Jeremiah
[1:34:32] prophet Moses prophet Daniel prophet
[1:34:35] right I mean you just name it many
[1:34:38] prophets that God used to write write
[1:34:40] the Bible many problem so if God would
[1:34:42] use a prophet to write it why would you
[1:34:45] use a prophet to interpret it
[1:34:51] so why we why we satisfied with their
[1:34:54] with a theological point of view we
[1:34:57] ought to go back to what a prophetic
[1:34:58] view is now don't get me wrong brother
[1:35:01] branham did not come amen
[1:35:03] an interpret scripture for scripture for
[1:35:05] us he didn't do that but the Holy Spirit
[1:35:08] is here to interpret scripture for
[1:35:11] scripture for us but we got to get in
[1:35:13] the same we got to get on the same
[1:35:14] Channel oh my god
[1:35:18] service I mean those y'all that watch TV
[1:35:22] if you want to watch a certain thing you
[1:35:24] got the tune into the right channel hey
[1:35:27] man you watch it on the Internet you got
[1:35:30] to go to the right website if you want
[1:35:32] to get some from God you gotta have to
[1:35:34] be in the right channel of inspiration
[1:35:35] to get it from God you got to be in the
[1:35:43] right channel that denomination is not
[1:35:48] the right channel amen that denomination
[1:35:52] went off it got fuzzy you you hid in
[1:35:58] your rabbit ears glory to God ain't man
[1:36:03] you ain't got to do that no more with
[1:36:04] this message the picture become clear
[1:36:08] from Genesis to Revelation the picture
[1:36:11] it's clear oh my lord it god yes it was
[1:36:18] adultery that happened in the Garden of
[1:36:19] Eden hey man listen in the days of the
[1:36:22] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[1:36:23] begin to sound the mystery of God should
[1:36:25] be finished as he hath declared to his
[1:36:26] servants the prophets
[1:36:27] here brother Branham makes some
[1:36:29] statements that I just wanted to pick up
[1:36:31] about mysteries amen
[1:36:33] this out of is this the sign of the
[1:36:36] answer and men he says some things here
[1:36:38] about mysteries now when he picks us up
[1:36:40] he's taken the notes of dr. Scofield and
[1:36:43] he's bringing that in to talk about
[1:36:45] mysteries but then as he's bringing in
[1:36:48] dr. Scofield notes then he adds his own

[1:37:26] with Scofield but I'm gonna take what
[1:37:29] Scofield says amen
[1:37:31] it says now if you like to tight some of
[1:37:33] them down if you haven't got a Scofield
[1:37:36] Bible you might read what he thinks you
[1:37:42] might read what he thinks some of the
[1:37:45] mysteries are now in the eleventh verse
[1:37:47] it says he answered and said unto them
[1:37:49] because it's given to you his disciples
[1:37:52] because it is given to you to know the
[1:37:54] mysteries of God mysteries of the
[1:37:56] kingdom of heaven but not to them but to
[1:37:59] them it's not given now before I go
[1:38:02] further that I just gotta inject
[1:38:04] something here God inject something just
[1:38:06] turn with me in your Bibles to John 16
[1:38:09] John 16 praise the Lord
[1:38:14] glory glory glory amen
[1:38:19] John 16 and I want to start reading here
[1:38:24] verse 25 we were just mentioning on
[1:38:29] Wednesday night to be an overcomer in
[1:38:33] the Philadelphian church age you were
[1:38:36] placed a man as a pillar in the temple
[1:38:40] of God and as been placed as a pillar
[1:38:43] meant that you were a part of the
[1:38:46] foundation a man holding up the
[1:38:49] superstructure right you were part of
[1:38:52] the foundation he established in place
[1:38:56] even you know the what the prophets said
[1:38:58] and what the you know the disciples were
[1:39:00] walking with they were part of that
[1:39:01] foundation right so here here with you
[1:39:04] been an overcoming you also be a part of
[1:39:06] the foundation pretty much saying that
[1:39:08] the same revelation that they walked in
[1:39:10] is the same revelation if you'll walk in
[1:39:12] and what I'm trying to tell you this for
[1:39:14] is that if
[1:39:15] you are walking in this revelation with
[1:39:17] clarity you're already an overcomer if
[1:39:24] you're walking in this revelation with
[1:39:27] clarity you are already an overcomer and
[1:39:31] what I mean by that that nobody can
[1:39:32] shake you take that pill out this church
[1:39:35] just what this building one exists
[1:39:37] um and that's I mean look you have
[1:39:41] another website you want to put up it
[1:39:42] will not impact me I'm not even it
[1:39:46] doesn't even matter I mean I'm not that
[1:39:48] when I first heard about him I actually
[1:39:50] avoided them completely i but you know
[1:39:53] why I said I don't want to waste my time
[1:39:54] I don't need to waste my time right I
[1:39:58] mean it's the same thing with you you
[1:39:59] try to give me another Bible outside of
[1:40:01] KJV I'm not really gonna read it I'm not
[1:40:05] gonna read it right I mean you know
[1:40:07] specially when it if I know that I'm
[1:40:09] took scriptures I love it why are you
[1:40:10] gonna give that to me
[1:40:11] oh my god right I mean you know I you
[1:40:17] know let me just kind of inject just a
[1:40:19] little bit y'all just bear with me here
[1:40:20] nowadays you know people say we even
[1:40:24] also just talked about how there's a
[1:40:26] uniting happening right the Catholics is
[1:40:29] uniting with the Protestants this year
[1:40:31] represents 500 years of division with
[1:40:34] the Lutheran's and the Catholics the
[1:40:35] Lutheran's are first ones to break away
[1:40:37] and everybody else follow suit right
[1:40:40] but now the Lutheran's the Protestants
[1:40:42] are coming back to the Catholics Joel
[1:40:46] Osteen got comments out there Rick
[1:40:48] Warren got comments out there everybody
[1:40:50] saying things like are they coming back
[1:40:51] together in the Catholics oh yeah we
[1:40:52] it's going to happen we already talked
[1:40:54] about how we gonna get this thing
[1:40:55] settled and then when they sense that
[1:40:58] you know what it's just the core things
[1:41:01] that we need to agree on I want you to
[1:41:03] hear that it's the core things Jesus
[1:41:06] died for your sins Jesus rose again
[1:41:09] right you got to be baptized which
[1:41:14] baptism because you know one of the
[1:41:19] visions was is that they baptize in the
[1:41:21] name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:41:24] and rest assured leave Lord Jesus Christ
[1:41:26] that's how the church started in the
[1:41:28] name of the
[1:41:29] Jesus Christ but the Catholics came
[1:41:30] along and they took it - father son Holy
[1:41:33] Ghost now the church they said we just
[1:41:35] got it we just got a file a court court
[1:41:37] you know Court we just got a grim cor
[1:41:38] things the Lord told me no no no no no
[1:41:41] no no we gotta agree on core things we
[1:41:42] gotta agree on all the words not just
[1:41:46] part of the word we gotta agree on all
[1:41:48] the word until you can become one with
[1:41:51] the word that we'll never experience
[1:41:53] unity all right all right
[1:41:57] John 16 this quote here just kind of
[1:42:02] brought this back to my attention
[1:42:03] because he was quoting the scripture
[1:42:06] there about the it's given to you the
[1:42:09] disciples it's given to you to know the
[1:42:11] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but
[1:42:13] not to them but to them it is not given
[1:42:16] but it's given to you to know the
[1:42:19] mysteries of the kingdom ever here John
[1:42:20] 16 the verse 25 these things have I
[1:42:24] spoken unto you in Proverbs
[1:42:26] but the time cometh when I shall no more
[1:42:31] speaking to you in Proverbs but I shall
[1:42:33] show you plainly of the Father listen at
[1:42:37] that day ye shall ask in my name oh you
[1:42:43] got to know his name you should ask in
[1:42:46] my name and I say not unto you that I
[1:42:49] will pray the Father for you I don't say
[1:42:52] I'm gonna pray to the Father for you
[1:42:54] right now and here here Jesus said now
[1:42:57] I'm not saying that I'm gonna pray to
[1:42:59] the Father for you almost separating the
[1:43:01] two right here Jesus being the son said
[1:43:04] I'm not gonna pray to the Father for you
[1:43:05] almost separate the two but you got to
[1:43:07] keep reading for the father himself love
[1:43:10] with you because you have loved me and
[1:43:12] have believed that I came out from God
[1:43:16] look at you slip that in now say you you
[1:43:19] believe that I came out from God let go
[1:43:21] til he says I came forth from the father
[1:43:24] and I am come into the world again I
[1:43:27] leave the world and go to the father his
[1:43:32] disciple said unto Him lo now speaking
[1:43:35] style plainly and speakest no proper now
[1:43:39] as a disciple you understand what he
[1:43:42] just
[1:43:44] but if you're not in fact well that was
[1:43:47] very confused and talk to you oh my that
[1:43:51] was extremely confusing wait a minute
[1:43:53] what you're talking about Jesus
[1:43:55] it's how about you know you're not gonna
[1:43:56] pray to the Father for us and now you
[1:43:58] tell me you come from God are you going
[1:43:59] back what are you talking about
[1:44:01] well the disciples knew that he was God
[1:44:04] Peter Peter said it Peter you know you
[1:44:06] say who do men say that I am hey save
[1:44:10] some say reliance so Jeremiah is one of
[1:44:12] the prophets that's what they say then
[1:44:14] he actually very specific question about
[1:44:16] who do you say that out of Southern Man
[1:44:18] a.m. they say thou art the Christ the
[1:44:20] Son of the Living God he said blessed
[1:44:23] art thou simon barjona because flesh and
[1:44:25] blood hath not revealed this to you but
[1:44:26] my father heaven has revealed this to
[1:44:29] you that's why Peter can also come after
[1:44:31] the day of Pentecost say be baptized in
[1:44:33] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:44:35] because he had a revelation of who the
[1:44:36] father was who the son was who the Holy
[1:44:39] Ghost was look at this verse 28 I came
[1:44:42] forth from the father and I am coming to
[1:44:44] the world again I leave the world and go
[1:44:45] to the to the Father here's the cycle
[1:44:47] set of him low and now speaking out
[1:44:48] plainly and speakest know properly now
[1:44:51] we now are we sure that thou knowest all
[1:44:55] things and need it's not that any man
[1:44:56] should ask D by this we believe that
[1:44:59] thou camest forth from God jesus
[1:45:01] answered them says do you now believe
[1:45:06] brother branham save just like he had a
[1:45:08] maybe a little look on his face you
[1:45:11] finally got it and that's what you want
[1:45:14] to tell the church do you do you get it
[1:45:17] did you finally get it Jesus Jehovah of
[1:45:22] the Old Testament is Jesus of the new
[1:45:28] let's go on back to school
[1:45:39] okay let's go back to this quote is that
[1:45:42] it's just a sound the answer says uh in
[1:45:47] the answer that said in them because it
[1:45:49] is given to you his disciples because it
[1:45:50] is given to you to know the mysteries of
[1:45:52] the kingdom of heaven but not to know
[1:45:54] them but to them it's not given the
[1:45:56] mysteries here is the mystery now he's
[1:45:58] giving Scofield notes Scofield
[1:46:01] notes and he said I say this is what's
[1:46:03] Goldfield thought the mysteries were
[1:46:05] let's go on so now the mysteries here is
[1:46:08] the mystery a mystery is Scripture is a
[1:46:12] previously hidden truth now divinely
[1:46:17] reveal but which is a supernatural
[1:46:21] element still remains despite the
[1:46:24] revelation my god I like that a
[1:46:28] supernatural element remains despite the
[1:46:31] revelation when I look at that and I
[1:46:33] think about that I don't care how much
[1:46:35] people been teaching first revelation a
[1:46:38] supernatural element remains on the true
[1:46:40] revelation my god amen
[1:46:44] it was always in Scripture it was just
[1:46:47] hitting the church was not teaching it
[1:46:48] all the way back to what happened in the
[1:46:50] Garden of Eden
[1:46:51] the church has stopped teaching it years
[1:46:53] ago they gave us an apple they gave us
[1:46:55] an apricot they gave us they gave us
[1:46:57] every every other fruit but they did not
[1:46:59] give us adultery all right let's keep
[1:47:02] going
[1:47:04] Scofield's knows number one the mystery
[1:47:06] of the kingdom of heaven that's the one
[1:47:08] we're talking on now Matthew 13 3 250
[1:47:11] says now second mystery is the mystery
[1:47:14] of Israel's blindness during this age
[1:47:16] and this still knows why was it's real
[1:47:19] blind you know you know during the stage
[1:47:22] heat and heat give me a reference of
[1:47:24] Romans 11:25 now praise the Lord
[1:47:28] some of the things just right there in
[1:47:29] the Bible when Jesus even pray you know
[1:47:31] Father forgive them for they know not
[1:47:33] what they do he knew that Israel was
[1:47:34] blinded and they were blinded so the
[1:47:36] Gentiles could see but Scofield thought
[1:47:38] that was a mystery well that's just
[1:47:41] scripture that's not a mystery let's
[1:47:43] keep going all right third
[1:47:46] history of the translation of the living
[1:47:48] Saints at the at the at the end time of
[1:47:51] this age wait a minute national fitness
[1:47:54] construct something the mystery of the
[1:47:56] translation of the Saints because you
[1:47:58] know the church then got away from
[1:47:59] teaching about the rapture they don't
[1:48:01] understand it and they even would tell
[1:48:04] you that the word rapture is not even in
[1:48:06] Bible when they say that that mean we
[1:48:08] don't have to teach it because it's not
[1:48:10] even in the Bible it's not scriptural
[1:48:12] maybe the word rapture it's not in the
[1:48:15] Bible I'll give you that but catching
[1:48:17] away is and the Bible say the Lord
[1:48:20] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:48:22] shout voice and truck how did God do
[1:48:25] that well the Prophet tous that Jesus
[1:48:28] does all three so the Prophet brought
[1:48:32] the revelation of how the rapture
[1:48:34] supposed to take place it's right there
[1:48:36] in the message oh my god hallelujah
[1:48:39] so Scofield got something there but I'll
[1:48:42] go fit in here the Prophet actually
[1:48:44] explained it maybe he would have put
[1:48:46] that in his nose you know he'd already
[1:48:48] wrote it before the Prophet come but
[1:48:49] that's okay
[1:48:50] Amen listen the third mystery the
[1:48:53] mystery of the translation on the living
[1:48:55] Saints at the end time of the stage
[1:48:56] first first Corinthians 15 and also
[1:48:58] Thessalonians 4 14 14 through 17 another
[1:49:02] the fourth mystery of the new New
[1:49:04] Testament church is one body composed of
[1:49:06] both Jews and Gentiles Ephesians 3 1 to
[1:49:09] 11 Romans 16:25 and also Ephesians 619
[1:49:12] Colossians 4 3 they use a script of
[1:49:15] support you know where he's getting
[1:49:16] stuff from the fifth mystery of the
[1:49:18] church as the barata price it features
[1:49:21] five twenty eight to thirty to the sixth
[1:49:24] mystery is that the living Christ saying
[1:49:26] yesterday today and forever
[1:49:27] now Scofield caught that but I don't
[1:49:30] know if he saw it manifested hey
[1:49:33] glory to God Galatians 2:20 in Hebrews
[1:49:35] 13:8 in many places like that the
[1:49:37] seventh mystery is of God even Christ as
[1:49:40] the incarnate fullness of the Godhead
[1:49:44] embody in whom all divine wisdom and
[1:49:48] godliness is restored to man ninth
[1:49:51] mystery is a mystery of iniquity found
[1:49:53] in 2nd Thessalonians and so forth the
[1:49:55] tenth mystery of the seven stars of
[1:49:57] revelation 1:20 look at the Scofield
[1:50:00] he want to know who these seven stars
[1:50:02] are he couldn't tell you who they were
[1:50:05] but he knew that was there as a mystery
[1:50:07] what God sent a prophet and he told us
[1:50:09] who each tie was God a man so it's no
[1:50:15] longer a mystery anymore people picking
[1:50:17] up the Scofield and not even interpret
[1:50:19] what the mystery is we pick up the
[1:50:20] scoping when we can tell you oh we put
[1:50:22] up all Iranian Martin Columbia Luther
[1:50:25] Wesley William Branham I gave this I
[1:50:29] gave that to a brother I said brother he
[1:50:33] was working for Kinkos at the time and I
[1:50:40] gave it to the president would you just
[1:50:41] you know make make you know make this
[1:50:44] for the church just blow this up I took
[1:50:46] the picture out of the church book if
[1:50:48] you look in his church age book brother
[1:50:49] brother Brandon blows it up he doesn't
[1:50:52] put brand him there he puts the Elisha
[1:50:53] and some people just leave it blank
[1:50:56] well this brother when he came back and
[1:50:59] brought brother Beck's it's not here and
[1:51:01] I don't think I even put it I don't know
[1:51:02] if I pretty large or anything now I just
[1:51:04] I just gave him tours just blow it up
[1:51:05] when I got it back it had Brandon there
[1:51:08] he caught it by revelation who was that
[1:51:11] seventh angel that seven star glory to
[1:51:15] God and we know about revelation who the
[1:51:17] seventh ain't Scofield looking for it
[1:51:20] let's go firstly this is mystery that
[1:51:21] got to be revealed it has been let's
[1:51:28] keep going I'm trying I'm just trying to
[1:51:31] get somewhere here today and I'm not
[1:51:33] making I'm not making much progress but
[1:51:36] he said he'd say that the tenth
[1:51:39] mysteries and Mister the seven stars
[1:51:41] revelation 1:1 twin and we just and
[1:51:43] brother Branham said we just been
[1:51:44] through that the seven stars of the
[1:51:47] seven churches the 7 messengers and so
[1:51:49] forth and says the 11th mystery is the
[1:51:52] is mystery of Babylon the prostitute
[1:51:54] revelation 17:5 to 7 now here Stoffel
[1:51:59] identifies in his Bible that the
[1:52:04] Catholic Church is revelation 17 fulfill
[1:52:07] in revelation 17 revelation 18 the
[1:52:10] Catholic Church and the Catholic Church
[1:52:12] is the Angel City
[1:52:13] that come out of her my people the
[1:52:16] Catholic Church all her dogmas and
[1:52:18] everything else that she had and now we
[1:52:19] are in a season where the Protestant
[1:52:22] churches are all going back now we'd be
[1:52:25] considered Protestant but we're not
[1:52:28] considered all that's going back we're
[1:52:33] not going back to the Catholic Church we
[1:52:34] going back to the word glory all right
[1:52:39] let me keep going he goes on looking
[1:52:45] what the prophecy is that's some of the
[1:52:46] mysteries that this Ange is supposed to
[1:52:48] wound up all the mystery all the
[1:52:52] mysteries of God that's revelation 10 7
[1:52:54] and the other sin may I say this with
[1:52:56] reverence and not referring to myself
[1:52:57] but referring to the angel of God the
[1:53:01] serpent seed that's been a hidden
[1:53:03] mystery all through the years see how he
[1:53:05] injected that oh the grace Street now
[1:53:09] not disgrace but real true grace not no
[1:53:13] such thing as eternal burning hell you
[1:53:18] can't tell nobody gonna go to hell and
[1:53:20] burn eternally you just look at hell was
[1:53:26] created and anything created can not be
[1:53:30] eternal oh that's what brother Branham
[1:53:34] say couldn't believe in eternal sonship
[1:53:36] alright cuz the Sun was born it came out
[1:53:40] of God now
[1:53:41] praise God now we realized that with him
[1:53:43] coming out of God and going back to God
[1:53:45] there was an internal quality about the
[1:53:47] Sun and not only is there eternal
[1:53:49] quality about the Sun there's an eternal
[1:53:50] quality about you oh yes yes yes yes yes
[1:53:57] I am
[1:53:58] it's the gray straight now not disgraced
[1:54:01] but it's real true grace not no such
[1:54:02] thing as an eternal burning hell you'll
[1:54:04] burn for millions of years but anything
[1:54:06] that was eternal had never a beginning
[1:54:07] or end and hell was created all these
[1:54:11] mysteries says the mystery of the
[1:54:13] baptism of the Holy Ghost without
[1:54:15] sensation now you know there's a new one
[1:54:17] going out that you've got the half
[1:54:19] sensation where you get the Holy Ghost
[1:54:21] but brother rhythm so you can have it
[1:54:22] without sensation now you know just hold
[1:54:25] on to that I'm gonna give you a quick
[1:54:26] example
[1:54:27] you know that's why could I could
[1:54:29] appreciate what for the wand you know
[1:54:33] was saying just a few weeks ago and
[1:54:35] everything like that but you all
[1:54:37] remember there was a brother two showed
[1:54:39] up at a brother branham's Church we can
[1:54:41] pull it down he showed up and he was
[1:54:44] wondering about where they had the Holy
[1:54:46] Ghost and he had a there was a situation
[1:54:48] where his wife was going to church he
[1:54:50] wasn't going and he had a little card
[1:54:54] that he had you know and it's he was
[1:54:56] selling the car had a little card in his
[1:54:58] pocket like this and a guy gave it to
[1:55:00] him just witnessing to him gave him a
[1:55:01] little card and he put it in his pocket
[1:55:04] like his jacket pocket and now one day

[1:57:09] that's exactly what happy to say that's
[1:57:11] when he came in see that was the Holy
[1:57:16] Ghost without sensation he said that's
[1:57:20] when he came in and the man thing what

[1:57:30] and I and I jumped and I cried and and I
[1:57:33] spoke in tongues you say what's they
[1:57:34] wrong he said no they had part of it
[1:57:36] right you say that's what her to do that
[1:57:37] they come in he said but but that's when
[1:57:39] he came in say the man begin to shout
[1:57:42] the men begin to jump the men begin to
[1:57:45] speak in tongues everything right there
[1:57:47] on the spot
[1:57:48] when he caught a revelation see you
[1:57:52] can't be completed to you coming to
[1:57:54] total truth that's when that's when you
[1:57:57] feel complete like man sometime we did
[1:58:06] cuz we've always always built it on any
[1:58:08] motion we always built it on sir say no
[1:58:09] you know when things changed in your
[1:58:11] life you know that and only you know you
[1:58:14] know what you got real with God and when
[1:58:16] you would fake you know that's why
[1:58:21] brother Branham said the Holy Ghost is
[1:58:23] an experience that you know and if you
[1:58:28] don't know then just seek God for the
[1:58:30] Holy Ghost right but you know and not
[1:58:33] only will you get it you keep fueling it
[1:58:35] because you own baptism after baptism
[1:58:38] refilling after refilling hey man yo
[1:58:42] your car your car King just have one
[1:58:44] feeling just keep going for the rest of
[1:58:45] his life try
[1:58:49] you caught the other side of the road
[1:58:52] because you refused to put gas in it
[1:58:55] somebody else might come get it and use
[1:58:57] it where the gas can how you expect to
[1:59:04] be used by God if you won't get the
[1:59:06] refills I'm trying all right let me let
[1:59:14] me go back let me go back it was um it
[1:59:16] was one thing that I'm trying to get
[1:59:17] here and I'm gonna have to skip all this
[1:59:19] to get there but I'm by God's grace
[1:59:23] we'll make we'll make some progress so
[1:59:26] the Prophet says this the one of the
[1:59:30] other mysteries that Scofield didn't
[1:59:32] catch was the mystery of the Batchelor
[1:59:35] old ghost without sensation but the
[1:59:36] person of Christ performing and you the
[1:59:38] same works that he did so the Holy Ghost
[1:59:41] is not just to come and make you speak
[1:59:44] in tongues but the Holy Ghost is to come
[1:59:45] and make you perform the works of Christ
[1:59:48] do the works of Christ right he said the
[1:59:50] spirit of Beethoven's issue is in you
[1:59:52] you write the music of Beethoven if the
[1:59:55] spirit of John Dillinger was in you you
[1:59:56] have guns shooting everybody say better
[1:59:59] the spirit of Jesus Christ is in you
[2:00:00] it's gonna make you live the life of
[2:00:02] Christ make you act the life of Christ
[2:00:04] that's what the Spirit of God is
[2:00:05] supposed to make you do if you claim the
[2:00:07] Spirit of God this please bear with me
[2:00:10] this you know I had two conversations
[2:00:14] this week just it just gets me you know
[2:00:16] these these things sometime you'd be
[2:00:18] looking for God he'd just be right there
[2:00:20] in front of you you know but uh young
[2:00:22] lady come to Michigan saying you know
[2:00:24] she was going I was talking about the
[2:00:26] mace and how in Christendom people just
[2:00:28] going through the mace
[2:00:29] they just they trying to find this
[2:00:31] trying to find that so they get with
[2:00:32] this group and it goes so far hit it
[2:00:34] Danny then they back up and didn't go go
[2:00:37] so Bob this other group they hit of
[2:00:38] Danny back up so so I I was just talking
[2:00:41] about just general terms like that she
[2:00:43] finally called it when she said you know
[2:00:45] I was going to church and and I was
[2:00:49] talking to him we had a Bible study we
[2:00:50] got to talking about the gifts of the
[2:00:52] Spirit talking about speaking in tongues
[2:00:53] say I believe in speak in tongues was
[2:00:54] that I spoke in tongues and she was
[2:00:56] telling me how you know somebody
[2:00:57] encourages say when you just got that
[2:00:59] anger built up in you you just don't
[2:01:02] know what to say
[2:01:02] to start speaking a toast when you get
[2:01:11] angry you just you just go - speaking of
[2:01:13] tones just let it out because you can't
[2:01:16] express it in your own normal language
[2:01:17] so just let that anger let it keep
[2:01:22] talking when - that's the Pentecostal
[2:01:27] church that gave it at if I said she
[2:01:28] went to Baptist Church the Baptist
[2:01:30] Church says we don't believe in speaking
[2:01:31] in tongues so wait a minute now the
[2:01:34] Bible actually said they spake in
[2:01:36] tongues and I said I said I said I said
[2:01:38] now you know there's a middle of the
[2:01:40] road here that we gotta get and that
[2:01:43] saying this was you know I I ran into a
[2:01:45] lady yesterday and she was just telling
[2:01:47] her she just they say we believe in
[2:01:48] holiness and then she looked what she
[2:01:50] that she looked Sheila hopefully but she
[2:01:51] was she dressed real nice you know
[2:01:53] looking holy but she said she's saying
[2:01:55] she's saying you know what I believe in
[2:01:56] speaking in tongues so I ain't got that
[2:01:58] much time to talk because I I know we
[2:02:00] would be in a conversation for a good
[2:02:02] while probably - this time tomorrow you
[2:02:04] know talking about this but I mean I
[2:02:06] look at people that just say that they
[2:02:08] just they don't believe in that but the
[2:02:09] Bible says that it happened in the
[2:02:11] church so we're supposed to believe in
[2:02:13] it I said but there's a middle of the
[2:02:15] road I say the middle row is you know
[2:02:18] this church is telling you to speak in
[2:02:20] tongues when you get angry that's not
[2:02:22] what the Bible's saying the Bible say
[2:02:24] they speak in tongues as the Spirit gave
[2:02:26] them utterance say not when you get
[2:02:29] angry that's you doing whatever you want
[2:02:30] to do spirit and give you no utterance
[2:02:32] and and how you gonna pray to God mad at
[2:02:35] God you expect God to hear that and they
[2:02:41] just just they coach them on the wrong
[2:02:42] stuff you just can't go talk to God any
[2:02:44] kind of way and expect to get a result
[2:02:46] yes sir you got to have the right
[2:02:48] approach to God I'm angry you angry but
[2:02:53] get over it all right but you know but I
[2:02:57] said there's a middle of the road that
[2:02:58] we got to find and what this message is
[2:03:00] done is brought us back to the middle of
[2:03:01] road glory to God
[2:03:04] listen brother Branham says the mystery
[2:03:07] of the mystery Baptist no Holy Ghost
[2:03:10] without sensation but the personal
[2:03:11] Christ performing in you the same works
[2:03:13] that he did the mystery of water baptism
[2:03:14] where the extreme
[2:03:16] trinitarianism has brought it into
[2:03:18] titles of Father Son and Holy Ghost in
[2:03:20] mystery of the Godhead being fulfilled
[2:03:22] in the baptism of the name of Jesus
[2:03:26] Christ the mystery of the Godhead being
[2:03:29] fulfilled in the baptism of the name of
[2:03:32] the Lord Jesus Christ according to the
[2:03:35] Book of Revelations that the church in
[2:03:36] this time was to receive there is some
[2:03:39] of the mysteries the pillar fire
[2:03:42] returning back a man that's the thing
[2:03:44] that's supposed to take place and we see
[2:03:46] it oh how we could go on naming the
[2:03:50] mysteries all we noticed that the viable
[2:03:53] told us in Revelation 10 7 that when
[2:03:56] thus in the days of the voice of the
[2:03:57] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[2:03:59] sound then the mystery of God should be
[2:04:00] finished as they have to clear two
[2:04:02] servants the prophets so if we want to
[2:04:04] understand these things it's best to go
[2:04:06] back and get a prophetic understanding
[2:04:08] of it then we know we stand Lord Jesus
[2:04:13] y'all just bear with me just for a few
[2:04:15] more minutes let me just share maybe one
[2:04:18] or two more things and then I will I
[2:04:20] will try to break out of this a man just
[2:04:25] some statements that I came out of
[2:04:27] church age book and this is regarding
[2:04:29] the Godhead and this is really where I
[2:04:30] want to go to today brother Branham said
[2:04:32] today there's a gross error if it is
[2:04:35] that there are three gods instead of one
[2:04:37] this revelation that's given to John by
[2:04:39] Jesus himself corrects that error it is
[2:04:42] not that there are three gods but one
[2:04:45] God with three offices there is one God
[2:04:47] with three titles Father Son and the
[2:04:50] Holy Ghost
[2:04:50] this mighty revelation is what the early
[2:04:53] church had and it must be restored in
[2:04:56] this last day along with the correct
[2:04:58] formula of water baptism
[2:05:01] notice the gospel says this if there
[2:05:04] were three persons in the Godhead
[2:05:06] Abraham the descendant of Shem and
[2:05:09] Genesis 18 saw only one God with two
[2:05:13] angels that's why I said my lord if he
[2:05:16] wasn't three people then he can't be
[2:05:19] three now he says Hebrews 12:2 looking
[2:05:24] unto Jesus the author and finisher of
[2:05:26] our faith who for the joy that was set
[2:05:28] before him endure the cross
[2:05:30] this positive shame and is set down at
[2:05:33] the right hand of the throne of God now
[2:05:35] that's where people get it but remember
[2:05:37] if there if it wasn't three then it
[2:05:38] can't be it can't be three now so we'll
[2:05:40] say Jesus sat down at the right hand the
[2:05:42] throne of God I know that's what the
[2:05:43] Bible said but God don't have a right
[2:05:45] hand like ours this was a place of power
[2:05:47] and authority listen it is not two gods
[2:05:51] but simply why God manifest in his
[2:05:54] mighty triune offices and titles one
[2:05:58] other thing that he said they who
[2:06:01] believe in three persons have a three
[2:06:03] guard Godhead are guilty of breaking the
[2:06:07] first commandment first commandments
[2:06:11] thou shall have no other gods before me
[2:06:14] we got to come back to the truth now I
[2:06:19] want to just bring this in and get out
[2:06:22] I'll get out today look at this
[2:06:30] I've been I had to go all kind of places
[2:06:33] to get this from EMI let me use you for
[2:06:36] a second
[2:06:55] now this is a what is this what is it
[2:07:01] it's a ruler one ruler are three rules
[2:07:16] now what we got is it two rulers open it
[2:07:22] up brother what is it he just opened it
[2:07:30] up two times
[2:07:31] here we had three rulers one ruler right
[2:07:37] so brother branham said when we're
[2:07:41] looking at the trinity say God is like
[2:07:44] he called it
[2:07:45] God is like a three-foot rule God the
[2:07:55] Father God the Son God the spirit now I
[2:08:07] never changed it was always one ruler he
[2:08:10] just unfolded himself at different times
[2:08:13] in history to show who he was it's
[2:08:20] always the same God I didn't give you
[2:08:23] three rulers it's one ruler but just
[2:08:25] changing that different dispensations so
[2:08:28] when it came into sin and his son gene
[2:08:30] and I always tell people it weren't God
[2:08:32] sending his son it was God becoming the
[2:08:36] son that's why great is the mystery of
[2:08:40] godliness that's why he went back up
[2:08:44] into heaven that's why I came from down
[2:08:45] I went to God he always came from God
[2:08:52] ask God the Father then it became God to
[2:08:55] son but Jesus say I'm sending you a
[2:08:57] comforter open it up let us see the
[2:09:00] confident
[2:09:03] but it's always the same God all the
[2:09:06] time and it's in its whole purpose for
[2:09:09] the he can't well inside of you you
[2:09:14] can't give me no three guards this one
[2:09:16] God all the time hallelujah so let me
[2:09:28] just read that quote for you now come on
[2:09:29] out of here deep calleth unto the deep
[2:09:31] look at what he says here a man a man a
[2:09:35] man he like a three-foot rule I I went
[2:09:37] all over the internet to get this v on
[2:09:42] they don't they don't have this dome
[2:09:45] over see brother branham had that back
[2:09:46] in his school days and they say it's
[2:09:49] like a three-foot rule it's just one one
[2:09:52] ruler for three sections it's one God
[2:09:57] but three offices one God multiple
[2:10:01] titles it's always one God though and I
[2:10:07] just love the way he say he unfold and
[2:10:11] he like he like he like that but then he
[2:10:14] just opens up
[2:10:19] that's why I say in the beginning in the
[2:10:22] beginning God created right actually you
[2:10:26] know if I just let me just say in the
[2:10:36] beginning God created the heavens and
[2:10:37] earth right but if you go back I can't
[2:10:40] read it all today but you go to
[2:10:41] Colossians and say Jesus did it well
[2:10:45] Jesus is going to say one thing cuz I
[2:10:47] should say something else
[2:10:49] they had to be the same person but what
[2:10:51] God was doing was unfolding himself so
[2:10:53] when the logos came out of God he just
[2:10:57] unfolded himself and when the Holy
[2:11:01] Spirit comes into you he just unfolded
[2:11:05] himself my hallelujah church glory to
[2:11:09] God man amen
[2:11:12] all right all right let's look at this
[2:11:13] he says if Jesus has risen from the dead
[2:11:17] as he said as he said that he as we know
[2:11:23] he has then he said he'd be with us
[2:11:26] since in all the way through the end of
[2:11:29] the world that's right that right then
[2:11:31] he if he is risen from the data set the
[2:11:34] things that I do show you do also he
[2:11:37] said he could do nothing except the
[2:11:39] father showed him in other words God the
[2:11:41] Father was in the pillar fire that was
[2:11:44] God the Father then no one could touch
[2:11:47] him
[2:11:48] not even Moses even if a beast touch the
[2:11:50] mountain it had to be killed with a dart
[2:11:53] you know the story well then that was in
[2:11:55] the burning bush that halo of fire a
[2:11:57] pillar fire and then that pillar fire
[2:12:00] come down and was made flesh among us
[2:12:02] that's that's John 1 that pillow fire
[2:12:05] came down and was made flesh among us
[2:12:09] listen it says that same pillar of fire
[2:12:12] was God yet watch and then when his son
[2:12:17] when when this Son of God died then his
[2:12:20] spirit came back into me and simple men
[2:12:22] see that was a holy virgin born come
[2:12:24] back and that makes God like a
[2:12:26] three-foot rule see the first 12 inches
[2:12:30] God the
[2:12:33] second 12-inches God the Sun hurt 12
[2:12:39] inches God the Holy Spirit that's the
[2:12:43] reason as wheels commanded the baptized
[2:12:45] in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost
[2:12:48] but it's the same God not three gods
[2:12:52] which that'd be a heathen our God but
[2:12:56] it's our God one God it's God unfolding
[2:13:00] his self down to man and the reason he's
[2:13:03] doing that so he can get down and live
[2:13:06] among me isn't he lovely now he's done
[2:13:17] that so he can help you tonight and hear
[2:13:20] me is sinner like you saved by grace but
[2:13:22] God has unfolded his stuff down into
[2:13:24] mortal being and that he could take
[2:13:27] through one and help another yeah I
[2:13:30] couldn't heal you but that's already did
[2:13:32] at Calvary I couldn't forgive sins or
[2:13:34] heal sick nobody could God did that but
[2:13:38] now gifts are putting the church to
[2:13:40] point to that church I I just I rejoice
[2:13:45] over this when we get the true
[2:13:47] revelation a man of who he is if I tell
[2:13:50] you what it makes us overcomers and
[2:13:52] there's not a thing that the devil can
[2:13:54] do to get us off this we're part of the
[2:13:57] superstructure one more quote here out
[2:14:00] of here um I think it's the last one I
[2:14:02] got on that page hear ye him the Prophet
[2:14:07] says this it says now you see Jesus had
[2:14:10] proven to God that he'd been the right
[2:14:12] kind of Sun and God took him up on the
[2:14:15] top of the mountain brought witnesses
[2:14:16] out out their heavenly witnesses and
[2:14:19] earthly witnesses and they clothed him
[2:14:21] in immortality when they looked up they
[2:14:23] said his garments shine like the Sun a
[2:14:26] supernatural something taken place his
[2:14:28] garments glistened like the Sun in in
[2:14:30] its middle of the day as wide as they
[2:14:32] could be God placed on him that robe of
[2:14:34] immortality showing that he had received
[2:14:36] him that's the thing that God will do to
[2:14:40] his sons here on earth someday
[2:14:43] he says he
[2:14:45] we'll call you a side Church and if
[2:14:47] you'll only obey Him and stay on the
[2:14:51] word and believe it and he will placed
[2:14:55] into the church before the coming of
[2:14:59] Jesus Christ he will placed into the
[2:15:01] church all the powers that Christ had in
[2:15:04] him will be in the church all that God
[2:15:09] loves
[2:15:10] he poured into Jesus and just think
[2:15:13] about that ruler right
[2:15:14] Oh God being that first part of the
[2:15:16] ruler first 12 inches then we opens up
[2:15:18] amen the second part he says all that
[2:15:20] God was important of Jesus when he opens
[2:15:22] up now the second part all of that Jesus
[2:15:24] was he pours it into the church the
[2:15:26] third part right all that Jesus was he
[2:15:28] pours into the church God wanting his
[2:15:31] work done he sent it into his son the
[2:15:34] son one in the work done sent it into
[2:15:37] the church and that that day you'll know
[2:15:40] that I'm in the father the father me and
[2:15:42] I in you and you and me at that day
[2:15:44] because the same power of God was in
[2:15:46] Jehovah God rested in Jesus Christ the
[2:15:49] same power that rested in Jesus Christ
[2:15:51] rests in the place sons in the body of
[2:15:54] Christ all I can say is a man I'm so
[2:16:01] glad that we standing on this and like I
[2:16:03] said we got to go back and and really
[2:16:06] just you know revisit these things we
[2:16:08] not serving on three gods it's one God
[2:16:11] and I didn't get to it a day out if I
[2:16:13] get a chance I'll come back brother
[2:16:15] branham said from Genesis to Revelation
[2:16:16] that Revelation has been there of one
[2:16:19] God I want to walk you through
[2:16:21] scriptures just Genesis it was this way
[2:16:24] I eyes there it was this way another
[2:16:26] scripture was there I mean I'm I can't
[2:16:29] do it today I can't get it all out in
[2:16:30] one sermon but we gonna we gonna get
[2:16:32] there we're gonna get there I just I'm
[2:16:34] just trying to reestablish trying to
[2:16:36] bring people back to truth oh yeah we
[2:16:39] going back not like the night not like
[2:16:41] all the other Protestants we going back
[2:16:44] to the word and we can't agree on simple
[2:16:47] things like this how are we gonna have
[2:16:48] some unity I mean I still believe that a
[2:16:52] Catholic Church is a great
[2:16:54] revelation
[2:16:56] the Pope is the man of sin the
[2:17:00] Antichrist I still believe that that's
[2:17:03] why they separated because they believe
[2:17:05] things like that right but now what I
[2:17:08] mean you ask people who the Antichrist
[2:17:09] is they have no idea
[2:17:11] well the hat harlots
[2:17:14] she had daughters amen that's exactly
[2:17:18] what the Bible's saying and her
[2:17:19] daughters are going back home but I
[2:17:22] didn't come out from the Catholic Church
[2:17:24] I come from God
[2:17:27] and I'm going back to God and brother
[2:17:32] Branham say there's gonna be a lot of
[2:17:33] pressure put on us he said but Jesus
[2:17:36] comes at a time of trouble I'm under
[2:17:40] expectation for a rapture because I'm
[2:17:43] standing on this word did Jesus come at
[2:17:45] a time of trouble for the Hebrew boys
[2:17:48] where were they they were in the fire
[2:17:51] but in the fire they met the fourth man
[2:17:54] glory to God so if we got to go through
[2:17:56] some fire we're gonna meet somebody
[2:17:57] praise God and they won't stand on the
[2:18:01] revelation that we got they were
[2:18:03] standing on their own but we got a
[2:18:04] little bit more than what they had but
[2:18:06] we standing on the anyway and I believe
[2:18:07] God I'll meet us just like he met them
[2:18:09] praise God
[2:18:11] amen they at least knew not to bow down
[2:18:12] to no false gods faint man they knew not
[2:18:16] to do that and we not bowing either no
[2:18:17] false god you know they were and in some
[2:18:21] places brother man who say that you know
[2:18:22] they'll even take your building from you
[2:18:24] you won't even have a place to worship
[2:18:26] unless you're doing what they actually
[2:18:28] to do now I have to be careful when I
[2:18:32] say this because if they took this place
[2:18:35] of worship from me they didn't take my
[2:18:37] worship
[2:18:44] they didn't take my worship they might
[2:18:46] have took the place of worship from now
[2:18:48] while we still got a place to worship
[2:18:50] come to church cuz they ain't taking it
[2:18:53] from you the devil taking it from you
[2:18:56] now when they take it from you then you
[2:18:59] can't then you got we have to come up
[2:19:00] with some other you know alternatives
[2:19:02] praise God but now now while we still
[2:19:05] got a place to worship let's come to
[2:19:06] church for sake not to send yourselves
[2:19:09] together as you see the Day approaching
[2:19:11] but wait to the day get here before you
[2:19:13] stop let's pray father we are just so
[2:19:20] grateful for a truth that we could stand
[2:19:25] down and god these are things that we
[2:19:27] know but sometimes it's so good just to
[2:19:29] kind of go back over it just to
[2:19:32] reestablish got what you have called us
[2:19:36] to and now your prophet is telling us
[2:19:38] that you're like a three-foot rule what
[2:19:43] a powerful example we see it's just one
[2:19:46] guard all the time unfolding himself
[2:19:50] until he finally gets to spot where that
[2:19:53] to god that was there at the beginning
[2:19:55] there wasn't even God until he created
[2:19:58] angels to worship but there was still
[2:20:00] things in him that were bottled up that
[2:20:02] needed to be expressed to still to be
[2:20:04] released you want it to be a son you
[2:20:07] want it to be a father you want it to be
[2:20:10] a healer you want it to be a deliverer
[2:20:12] you want it to be a wave maker a promise
[2:20:15] keeper light in the darkness and God we
[2:20:18] declare that is exactly who you are we
[2:20:22] thank you Lord for every attribute that
[2:20:23] you have expressed to us and God as we
[2:20:26] walk with this word today realizing that
[2:20:29] you know we might be some of the only
[2:20:30] ones on the earth holding to truth but
[2:20:35] God will hold with everything we got
[2:20:37] so Lord let the demonstration would be
[2:20:40] something that sinks into our hearts
[2:20:42] into our minds and you know God may be
[2:20:44] something that we hold on to in this
[2:20:46] hour no matter what the enemy offers no
[2:20:48] matter what tricks he wants to play God
[2:20:51] we just want to hold to the word
[2:20:52] so keep this God as our prayer we give
[2:20:56] you all the glory we give you all the
[2:20:57] honor we give you all the priests sin
