[41:06] have been at where I was supposed to be
[41:09] and I will share testimony but like I

[42:26] hear something the globe put on my heart
[42:29] and many of you grab your Bibles
[42:45] and then y'all pray for me and man we're
[42:50] going to take a little scripture from
[42:53] Matthew 11 the eleventh verse revealing
[43:02] you to watch the wizard pull the small
[43:24] distance which really I see them to you
[43:30] among them that are born of a woman they
[43:34] had not risen a greater than John the
[43:37] Baptist
[43:38] notwithstanding he that is least in the
[43:41] kingdom of heaven is greater than he and
[43:47] from the days of John the Baptist until
[43:51] now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth
[43:57] violence and the violent take it by
[44:01] force a man let us turn our scripture to
[44:06] Luke 16:16 move 16 chapter xvi purse not
[44:28] a sane passage of scripture Matthew just
[44:35] wrote there Luke saw it a little bit
[44:40] different and he said it on this rise
[44:43] the law and the prophets were until John
[44:48] since that time the kingdom of God
[44:51] is preached and every man presses into
[44:57] it
[44:59] may the Lord that a blessing to the
[45:01] reading of his word maybe Bob is most
[45:05] gracious Heavenly Father Oh God I come
[45:11] before you right now Lord I ask you to
[45:15] just take control of it I yield this
[45:19] vessel to you O God use it as you will
[45:23] settle my nerves or both that the people
[45:26] may be saying something maybe save to
[45:30] encourage strengthen Lord God let me
[45:34] help building into a key man Oh God
[45:37] Jesus precious name I pray amen
[45:45] we see here that the Kingdom of Heaven
[45:49] suffereth violence and the violent take
[45:54] it by force
[45:56] and Luke Samuel didn't say the gospel
[46:02] the kingdom of God is preached and every
[46:07] man must press very into a man we all
[46:16] those that have agreed to embark upon
[46:20] its journey a man has taken all the
[46:27] mindset that we're going to leave it for
[46:31] Christ but along the way of Watchmen at
[46:35] times where were demons thrown out
[46:40] floozy alula vigor full of excitement as
[46:45] we delve into something new
[46:50] we start to realize that it's going to
[46:58] be bad that Saint was not going to make
[47:02] it easy for
[47:04] yes sir the kingdom of God is pressed
[47:08] into to be pressed to let us know that
[47:13] there's going to be some resistance a
[47:16] man but my desire is to live in the
[47:23] kingdom of Almighty God for there to be
[47:28] a kingdom a man that have to be a king
[47:32] Christ is that king and the question is
[47:38] is he ruling and reigning in your
[47:44] mother's remember it must be pressed
[47:49] into I like to title this message
[47:55] confronting the opposition a man
[48:00] confronting the opposition we have an
[48:05] opponent amen and we've learned how to
[48:09] plan an evening clip of moment you have
[48:14] to study your opponent yeah it went see
[48:17] where his weaknesses live to see his his
[48:22] habits yeah
[48:24] so that you can be prepared amen in the
[48:29] back and we see that this adversary a
[48:36] man has been saying he in this family
[48:45] long time and with our whole strength
[48:50] under our own abilities with a match for
[48:56] because he's been in a long time but we
[49:02] have a secret weapon
[49:05] that weapon is so secret but we have to
[49:10] be able to yield as him because the
[49:15] hours
[49:16] so not these thoughts and our ladies so
[49:21] we have to give our sales amen we have
[49:28] to relearn how to fight and then we
[49:34] commit we don't know how to fight his
[49:38] back naturally before they send a young
[49:46] man what is called a basic training and
[49:51] that training they strip away everything
[49:56] that he thought so make him look real
[50:08] soldier and then breaking it down a man
[50:15] he has to lose
[50:24] he is the malla soldier they call
[50:32] soldiers in the army Jack we diminish
[50:40] you no longer young you know sergeant
[50:45] all of the commands to do something you

[51:08] for amen when the word says to do
[51:14] something we say so yes

[56:04] lay hold on eternal life once and are
[56:09] also called and has professed a good
[56:13] profession before many witnesses I give
[56:18] the charge in the sight of God who
[56:21] quickeneth all things and before Christ
[56:24] Jesus who before Pontius Pilate
[56:28] witnessed a good confession that you
[56:30] keep this commandment without spot
[56:36] unreviewable until the appearing of the
[56:40] Lord Jesus Christ amen
[56:43] so a man who said we have to press into
[56:49] this kingdom a brain Hebrews 4:11 let us
[56:53] labor therefore let any man shall fall
[56:57] unto the same example a man Philippians
[57:01] 3 for the ps3 a man you know sequel into
[57:07] Philippians Philippians the third
[57:12] chapter
[57:14] finally my brother in rejoice in the
[57:17] Lord to write the same things to you to
[57:21] me indeed does not Grievous but for you
[57:25] it is safe beware of dogs beware of evil
[57:28] workers beware of the conscience we know
[58:02] [Applause]
[58:25] God is with a man the circle side of the
[58:37] first I hope circumcised the eighth day
[58:40] of the stock of Israel of the tribe of
[58:43] Benjamin an Hebrew of the Hebrews and
[58:47] touching the law of the Farsi to certain
[58:50] zeal persecuting the church touching the
[58:53] righteousness which is in their
[58:57] loveliness but what things were gain to
[59:00] me those I kind of lost for Christ they
[59:06] dollars and I count all things but loss
[59:11] for the excellency of the knowledge of
[59:15] Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I suffered
[59:20] the loss of all things and do count them
[59:24] but they meant for the things that that
[59:29] was seen here the big man he lost he had
[59:33] to give up
[59:36] I have to change my whole mindset to
[1:00:30] change things done that I'm a man amen
[1:00:39] for Jesus Christ and be found in him not
[1:00:44] having my own righteousness which is not
[1:00:48] the law but that which is through the
[1:00:51] faith of Jesus Christ the righteousness
[1:00:54] which is it which is of God by faith
[1:01:01] then that I may know him in the power of
[1:01:07] his resurrection and in the Fellowship
[1:01:11] of his sufferings being made conformable
[1:01:15] on today is by any means I might attain
[1:01:21] unto the resurrection of the Dead not as
[1:01:27] though I had already attained even were
[1:01:31] already 4% perfect but I follow after it
[1:01:35] after it is then I might that I've made
[1:01:39] backward we write that for which also
[1:01:45] I'm after him oh Jesus Christ
[1:01:49] then I cannot myself to have apprehended

[1:07:23] from Jordan that was led by the spirit
[1:07:26] into the wilderness being forty days
[1:07:29] tempted of the devil and in those days
[1:07:32] neither eat nothing and when he were
[1:07:36] Indian Africa he after a hundred and the
[1:07:41] devil said unto him if thou be the Son
[1:07:45] of God command these stones that if he
[1:07:50] made bread jesus answered him and say it
[1:07:57] is written that man shall not live by
[1:08:00] bread alone but by every word of God and
[1:08:04] the devil taking him up into all the
[1:08:08] kingdoms and showing up show unto him
[1:08:13] all the kingdoms of the world in a
[1:08:16] moment of time and the devil say unto
[1:08:19] Him all this power idea of thee
[1:08:26] and the glory of them for that is
[1:08:29] delivered unto me and to whomsoever I
[1:08:32] would I would give a doubt therefore
[1:08:38] what worship me all shall be thine and
[1:08:43] jesus answered and said unto him get
[1:08:47] thee behind me Satan for it is written
[1:08:50] thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and
[1:08:55] him only shalt not serve and he brought
[1:08:59] him to Jesus to Jerusalem and set him
[1:09:03] upon a pinnacle of the temple and said
[1:09:06] unto him if thou be the Son of God cast
[1:09:09] myself down from him for it is written
[1:09:13] not he tellin him with the words but it
[1:09:16] is written he shall give his angels
[1:09:18] charge over thee completely and their
[1:09:23] hands shall bear thee up lest thou dash
[1:09:27] thy foot against a stone and jesus
[1:09:31] answered and said unto Him he said thou
[1:09:36] shalt not kill the world of that God and
[1:09:40] when the devil had ended all his
[1:09:43] temptations he departed from him for a
[1:09:45] season and Jesus returned in how of the
[1:09:54] Spirit of the Galilee now he was laid
[1:09:58] full of the Holy Ghost but after the
[1:10:03] contention after overcoming he listened
[1:10:09] power of the Spirit you see he went in
[1:10:15] and he heard and he went through these
[1:10:19] bad Satan knew just will attack Jesus a
[1:10:24] first of all and he didn't and he didn't
[1:10:30] Jesus what was the rain has he
[1:10:55] [Applause]
[1:11:24] what okay you want to have the power in
[1:11:44] your life you have to leave Costa you
[1:11:48] have to overcome the temptations press
[1:12:10] the battery and then begin an ending of
[1:12:13] the Gentile dispensation this is e 1355
[1:12:19] zero one zero not a man now before you
[1:12:23] can have a victory there has to be a
[1:12:27] banner and if that's our balance there
[1:12:30] are no losers so we ought to be thankful
[1:12:34] for the balance and the tribe it's God
[1:12:41] giving us an opportunity to have
[1:12:44] victories

[1:37:06] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[1:37:08] tonight we appreciate from the jet we
[1:37:13] were planning on these hot sure you
[1:37:15] wasn't gonna do anything tonight and no
[1:37:19] Jack swung by and preach for us after
[1:37:21] his cousin's wedding and one man tell
[1:37:27] you what increase the masterpiece that's
[1:37:29] undergone man one thing I could see

[1:37:37] after that we're here by the grace of
[1:37:58] God 21 would return to appreciate the
[1:38:03] Saints the way would make for my church
[1:38:06] trusting God richly bless you for just
[1:38:10] coming out and being supported we are
[1:38:29] born in there together Detroit
[1:38:31] Jack and we kind of we got a toughness
[1:38:35] about us but we also kind of emotional
[1:38:37] guy
[1:39:03] so Gaza my hat's off to you a true and I
[1:39:12] trusted God just continue to bless the
[1:39:19] things that he's given you I was just
[1:39:21] thinking that God doesn't take something
[1:39:25] from you and not giving something back
[1:39:28] and even though he took he took his
[1:39:32] brother Mike and took brother Roosevelt
[1:39:34] I just look around and see what let us
[1:40:11] let us read the scripture the night a
[1:40:13] little slow but we all started the 18th
[1:40:22] verse did I tell you what I had a
[1:40:25] wonderful morning and I just trusted me
[1:40:30] up kind of spill over but I'm different
[1:40:34] than what I preached this morning a
[1:40:35] different subject altogether but I
[1:40:37] preached this at home and I thought this
[1:40:39] would be a blessing for tonight the 81st
[1:40:43] Matthew 21 sis now in the morning as he
[1:40:47] he returned to the city he hungered and
[1:40:50] when he saw
[1:40:51] a fig tree in the way he came to it and
[1:40:54] found nothing thereon but leaves only
[1:40:56] insanity let no fruit grown be
[1:41:00] henceforth forever and presently the fig
[1:41:04] tree with little weight and when the
[1:41:07] disciples saw it they marvelled saying
[1:41:09] how soon is the fig tree withered away
[1:41:13] and jesus answered and said unto them
[1:41:16] verily i said to you if you have faith
[1:41:18] and doubt not ye shall not only do this
[1:41:23] which is done to the fig tree but also
[1:41:28] if he shall said to this mountain be
[1:41:31] thou removed and be are cast into the
[1:41:33] sea it shall be done and all things
[1:41:36] whatsoever he accent fret believe you
[1:41:39] ever see a little of that a blessing -
[1:41:42] it's going to make a big seed just got a
[1:41:48] real our subject tonight I say his word
[1:42:16] I want to use also like this spring so
[1:42:20] y'all just follow me because we
[1:42:26] ministers will be differently we kind of
[1:42:28] think different but as a little context
[1:42:30] the ministry taking you forward I
[1:42:34] realized something that we're entering
[1:42:37] into a new year
[1:42:40] can I get a witness man and you know I
[1:42:45] often times and you know and work with
[1:42:47] people trying to make sure that people
[1:42:50] understand what's what's happening this
[1:42:54] is not just church it's not just it's
[1:42:57] not just coming to a building and
[1:43:00] gathering together looking good and
[1:43:01] smelling Google Talk
[1:43:04] all right but but that's not that's not
[1:43:06] really what this is all about
[1:43:09] I don't think that rosette preaches was
[1:43:12] Hill
[1:43:13] so I know things that we can do for help
[1:43:17] but but I believe that we we have a
[1:43:21] golden there's an abyss er a method if
[1:43:26] we say it like this to the man sometimes
[1:43:30] y'all think we doesn't go crazy but we
[1:43:32] don't pray hi we're trying to bring the
[1:43:40] church into see look you watch ministry
[1:43:45] today we we try to put it all in the
[1:43:48] spirit of it is run I'm alright I will
[1:43:51] pull up a glass for the reason I do a by
[1:43:56] the blue sword otherwise think that I'm
[1:43:57] looking at but I like you I think you
[1:44:06] know a lot of time you realize that that
[1:44:10] people aren't really comprehending what
[1:44:14] you're actually doing and what what true
[1:44:18] Christian don't is really all about
[1:44:20] right a lot of times people who think
[1:44:23] that is just coming to the building and
[1:44:25] just being a part of a gathering the
[1:44:28] thing for that nature but really that's
[1:44:31] not a far cry from what this is really
[1:44:34] all about truth was alluded to it's
[1:44:40] about being instructed yeah right is
[1:44:45] about instructions in and trying to
[1:44:48] bring you it to and then what God has
[1:44:52] for you right and to show you how to
[1:44:55] operate a certain way yeah see in this
[1:45:00] passage of scripture what we find is we
[1:45:02] find Jesus totally different from his
[1:45:06] disciple it was the world a certain way
[1:45:10] right right
[1:46:18] the fact that Jesus could speak a word
[1:46:22] right and and see the demise of the is
[1:46:36] this individual with Jesus Jesus gave
[1:46:45] practice but you understand right the
[1:46:57] fact that I've done this see you the
[1:47:06] things that you see P do you're gonna do
[1:47:09] that's right right that's right amen all
[1:47:15] the information all right I look at
[1:47:23] things that I think about things all
[1:47:25] right
[1:47:36] right right right but this is where
[1:49:21] [Music]
[1:50:08] [Applause]
[1:50:33] he was Jesus
[1:51:16] when are you guys gonna operate from the
[1:51:19] place they put this house move all with
[1:51:24] just knew that but the Drina
[1:51:32] journey with his disciples we're trying
[1:51:36] to instruct all right right to instruct
[1:52:40] I told them deck in the back I said
[1:52:44] justice because this is two or three
[1:52:49] message because this important force to
[1:52:59] see these things take time
[1:53:06] well I can see but say you know my nose
[1:53:09] you pick it up right listen it is a
[1:53:16] question that says now French scientists
[1:53:19] said less than 300 years ago if a man
[1:53:22] whenever make a terrific speed up
[1:53:25] $30,000 gravitation taken from the earth
[1:53:29] 30 miles an hour
[1:53:32] well do you think this signs will refer
[1:53:34] back far being no sir they haven't gone
[1:53:41] ten hundred miles an hour or something
[1:53:43] in a rocket 1600 miles an hour
[1:53:48] still taking him for yeah right I wanna
[1:53:53] stop with just one
[1:53:55] we have got to continue to move and we
[1:54:01] going miss them and we're wondering why
[1:54:05] we must get in the results in cinemas a
[1:54:10] constantly going backwards instead of
[1:54:13] going forward you want the watch
[1:54:15] ministry see my castle I'm going back
[1:54:20] doing the first work over right we gotta
[1:54:26] be a people that's that's moving moving
[1:54:29] Oh ugly that's what I'm doing trying to
[1:54:34] take people forward right manifested
[1:54:41] plot right okay y'all still with
[1:54:47] Sciences this is right science is
[1:54:53] constantly progressing what about it
[1:54:55] see say it has taken man forward muffled
[1:55:02] grated things with his mind
[1:55:05] then what and that's the only thing he
[1:55:10] has is the tree eating from the tree of
[1:55:14] knowledge right with his intellect when
[1:55:32] I got married I call this bottle
[1:55:35] everything was separate right yeah yeah
[1:55:40] that tux was we needed if you had a cell
[1:55:45] phone
[1:55:46] only the rich the dope deals and
[1:55:49] sales
[1:56:10] right right hey man but eat from this
[1:56:43] tree right has taken all right I just
[1:56:50] kind of say it right
[1:56:55] further than the ministers taken him
[1:56:58] with this to think that science being
[1:57:06] from the tree of knowledge of good and
[1:57:08] evil has taken foot further and we would
[1:57:12] diminish peak watch this now feeding
[1:57:16] from the tree of life oh you know we eat
[1:57:22] right yes born again children of God
[1:57:27] right you're eating like the first Adam
[1:57:31] from the tree alive exactly see you got
[1:57:38] a new way you got to know what you're
[1:57:40] doing Sam right anyway
[1:57:43] what to think that ministers right we
[1:57:53] should be firm up the room see hey Ben
[1:57:57] she tripped on the frame of it the
[1:57:59] biggest was taken up with the spirit
[1:58:01] which is funny see what this is
[1:58:12] [Music]
[1:58:23] [Music]
[1:59:26] it's from this tree right right the Tree
[1:59:40] of Life was priced then we will if we
[1:59:52] eat from we gotta realize something
[2:00:03] church we're dealing with super neck
[2:00:07] right we must recognize we're we're
[2:00:11] natural supernatural beings if that
[2:00:13] makes sense
[2:00:28] right right to the flesh he said you
[2:02:12] know doing the work
[2:02:14] I can something is greater than what you
[2:02:19] say
[2:02:20] I see so we're moving slow Church
[2:02:30] we're not going back right see do you
[2:02:33] know do you know what it means to go
[2:02:36] backwards to go back does it means you
[2:02:39] go back to Bali did you go back to be
[2:02:40] natural people not being color you know
[2:02:55] [Applause]
[2:03:08] these things don't walk like this it's
[2:03:13] not enough meaning you know we always
[2:03:15] look brother Brown trying to show us now
[2:03:40] what is he said when the brothers see
[2:03:43] the baptism of the holy ghost right and
[2:03:46] that's it for see the Baptist but a Holy
[2:03:50] Ghost
[2:03:51] oh no way right you're you're not
[2:03:54] entitled to it you can cry you can
[2:03:57] scream you can do whatever you want to
[2:03:59] do you gotta get the person of Christ in
[2:04:02] you right
[2:04:05] - too late crazy so anything that they
[2:04:08] were preaching definitive he says when
[2:04:16] the grounds were see the Baptist they
[2:04:18] said this is the Sun that means the high
[2:04:22] speed it's not it just get started right
[2:04:24] this is all of it but he said but Herman
[2:04:29] that's wrong there's no summer to
[2:04:32] empower
[2:04:37] keep moving as fast enough possible can
[2:04:39] see okay watch this Peter say we go
[2:04:44] backwards no he said we move on right we
[2:04:48] move on and we will move on it's funny
[2:04:52] in infinite resources of dog that has
[2:04:54] never been tapped real powerful
[2:05:02] statement but also when we hear that's
[2:05:06] taken if we've been around soul oh right
[2:05:11] it just automakers plenty more like Oh
[2:05:14] God
[2:05:15] right this is funding the resource of
[2:05:18] God is not meat app yet blessings and
[2:05:21] powers that we know nothing about right
[2:05:25] now then we go nothing we spit it all
[2:05:28] out our on all stuff instead of instead
[2:05:31] of iterating through and manifesting
[2:05:34] what Jesus sitting supposed to manifest
[2:05:38] right glory to God hey man see oh he
[2:05:45] said it's just a blessing the pilot we
[2:05:47] know looking back it's never been even
[2:05:50] think about it never even been revealed
[2:05:52] offering right it's very just the hit
[2:05:58] for the church that we read this is
[2:06:02] literally huh see when God is trying to
[2:06:17] bring us see if we go back to Adam
[2:06:36] listen Adam Dominion so you would charge
[2:06:42] you must son you in charge right right
[2:06:47] I'm following it all but this little
[2:06:53] spot your little you know human charges
[2:06:56] with it right he had to buy new parts
[2:06:59] [Music]
[2:07:09] see even even the movie wasn't a common
[2:07:14] move that move was because that's not
[2:07:25] trying to show us what what's laying
[2:07:29] before the church the baptism of the
[2:07:32] Holy Ghost is not the Sun the hardest
[2:07:42] thing see we don't want to make members
[2:07:46] because we will be Church walk around
[2:07:52] say first of all right to the place and
[2:08:17] position that they ought to see that's
[2:08:21] right when according to the book of Acts
[2:08:26] chapter 2 with the speaker Vegas PD says
[2:08:29] I hate that one man some great
[2:08:46] preacher I like to say stand up here

[2:13:28] wait seemed like we would get anything
[2:13:31] from historical spam we reach a
[2:13:35] historical a historical Jesus historical
[2:13:40] events we look back to you know we have
[2:13:44] to look back look God's called you to
[2:14:00] this that we who are Queenie the
[2:14:14] supernatural will just take the man
[2:14:17] where man in his senses is hitman two
[2:14:23] key senses right natural but your
[2:14:30] supernatural being right and see if you
[2:14:34] operate in your senses limit that you'll
[2:14:41] never be able to feel the word of God
[2:14:44] right because you will stumble and all
[2:14:48] the stumbling blocks of the death see we
[2:14:58] were clean with the supernatural just
[2:15:01] take a man in his
[2:15:06] [Music]
[2:15:20] we're moving forward it takes to move

[2:18:25] tree of knowledge can only climb so far
[2:18:28] we gotta go beyond that right
[2:18:32] she says watch this and then it breaks
[2:18:35] back I'm just wondering I'm kind of
[2:18:39] wondering what is more people feeling
[2:18:45] from the tree of knowledge than the Tree
[2:18:46] of Life to so many people the brick
[2:18:51] start to break back
[2:18:54] instead of going forward into this place
[2:18:59] where there's four Ribbit's - I wonder
[2:19:04] can I take like this see

[2:20:11] tree we're going on with with with
[2:20:16] Internet - this place of maturity we
[2:20:18] enter in this place where there's no
[2:20:20] read in that's right I'm gonna believe
[2:20:23] that you gotta know what tree that you
[2:20:26] eat right and the Tree of Life will say
[2:20:29] this right quick it's not a perverted
[2:20:31] truth right come on it's a tree wait
[2:20:39] with the original fruits of God Yogi's
[2:20:44] in love the original word right I'm
[2:20:51] leaving home to think about and see okay
[2:20:55] he said right back but the tree of life
[2:20:57] goes on forever and how that science has
