[45:06] fellowship with brother Joe Underwood uh
[45:08] brother Jimmy got a wonderful job a good
[45:10] City job you know up there so the Lord
[45:13] has opened up a door for him
[45:15] and um and I was telling sister Vern I
[45:19] say that's it's it's the right thing to
[45:21] do and uh and I'm happy to see them go
[45:25] amen this next season of Life there

[45:32] bless you and and uh trust the Lord will
[45:35] use you in a mighty way while you're
[45:37] there amen you and brother Jimmy amen
[45:40] also uh I I needed to make mention that
[45:43] um we have two of our saints that
[45:47] um were taken to the hospital over the
[45:50] last couple days uh brother Robles is in
[45:52] the hospital there in Port St Lucie and
[45:56] um there on Christmas day they're gonna
[45:58] keep them until sometime next week I
[46:01] believe uh just having a few issues with
[46:04] his blood pressure so we want to
[46:06] remember brother Robles in prayer and um
[46:09] and then uh last well throughout the
[46:12] week Brother Joseph has been uh
[46:15] complaining about headaches and he's
[46:18] been going back and forth to the
[46:19] hospital into the doctor and they just
[46:21] could not figure out what was happening
[46:24] with him and so they got him to the
[46:27] hospital last night and I had a chance
[46:29] to get there and pray for him because
[46:30] they were going to be transferring him
[46:32] down to
[46:33] Joe DiMaggio hospitals to Children's
[46:36] Hospital down in Hollywood and when it
[46:39] got him there
[46:40] I guess they ran a scan and they found a
[46:43] couple of spots on his brain
[46:45] and this morning brother Josue called me
[46:49] and said that they wanted to do an
[46:50] emergency surgery where they wanted to
[46:53] drill some holes there in his head that
[46:56] said there was a like pus or something
[46:58] like that that was developing there and
[47:00] they did they didn't understand what it
[47:02] was so Brother Joseph on this Christmas
[47:05] day is is there in the hospital having
[47:08] surgery so we want to remember our
[47:11] precious brother in prayer when I was
[47:13] talking to him on last night he said
[47:18] brother Jack I'm gonna just share this
[47:20] with you and he says he says you know we
[47:23] were in our new church
[47:25] and uh in the new church you say it was
[47:27] time for us to receive the word and my
[47:30] brother Jack you called me out to preach
[47:33] I said well brother Joseph if God gave
[47:36] you that Vision you ain't going nowhere
[47:39] until it comes to pass
[47:42] [Applause]
[47:46] and so
[47:48] um we just want to remember him in
[47:49] prayer I mean you know young man is just
[47:52] God's given him just a little something
[47:55] just you all heard the testimony of him
[47:57] praying stopping and wanting to pray for
[47:59] the man that was in the ditch and uh you
[48:02] know after that they went to get tires
[48:05] changed on the car and brother Jose was
[48:07] telling me that um you know this big
[48:10] gentleman walked out to change the tires
[48:12] big old fella and brother Joe looked at
[48:15] him to say sir you mind me telling you
[48:16] something
[48:18] it's a uh
[48:21] yeah go ahead
[48:23] it's a uh be careful what you complain
[48:26] about because it might be your blessing
[48:30] the man looked at me
[48:34] who is this little fella where he come
[48:37] from
[48:38] it's right on time
[48:40] you know and you know God gives gifts
[48:44] like that
[48:45] and um you know so we thank God for a
[48:48] young man and I think the thing of it is
[48:49] you have to raise him up the right way
[48:51] and just put them in the right uh
[48:53] channel to be trained and God can use
[48:56] them
[48:57] and that's what we want to see is God
[48:59] use them
[49:00] amen so I don't want to do anything to
[49:03] discourage a gift like that I want to
[49:05] encourage them you know and my thing is
[49:08] anytime you know the Lord gets a hold of
[49:10] somebody at an early age we know that
[49:11] that was just waiting to attack him uh
[49:14] so let's keep him in prayer and this
[49:16] morning we're going to pray for him
[49:17] because he sent a a text say please have
[49:21] the whole church pray for me amen today
[49:23] so we we want to do that amen and while

[52:14] amen
[52:16] let's get our Bibles amen and we'll turn
[52:19] to a scripture
[52:25] they were afraid that our drums has gone
[52:29] [Music]
[52:30] really create problems in the in the
[52:33] hotel but they didn't know there was the
[52:36] electric drums and they not as loud as
[52:39] the acoustic so uh we thank God we thank
[52:44] God we thank God
[52:47] let's go to Saint Luke chapter 2.
[52:52] just a couple verses here
[52:56] and I had to
[52:58] makeshift the pulpit
[53:00] uh we left ours at
[53:03] at church
[53:07] but God is good
[53:12] uh Luke chapter 2 verse 8.
[53:20] the Bible says and there were in the
[53:22] same country Shepherds
[53:25] abiding in the field keeping watch over
[53:28] their flock by night and lo the angel of
[53:31] the Lord Came Upon them
[53:33] and the glory of the Lord Shone round
[53:35] about them
[53:36] and they were sore afraid
[53:40] the angel said unto them fear not
[53:43] for behold I bring you good tidings of
[53:46] great joy which shall be to all people
[53:50] For unto you is Born This Day in the
[53:52] city of David
[53:55] a savior
[53:57] which is Christ the Lord
[54:01] amen the Lord had a blessing to the
[54:04] reading of his word you can be seated
[54:14] [Music]
[54:15] um just you all I don't know if we made
[54:19] it clear but service certainly on
[54:21] Wednesday night and next Sunday but
[54:23] being that we are in this transition
[54:26] period we are unable to have a watch
[54:30] Night Service which would have been
[54:33] Saturday night that would have been
[54:34] Saturday night rolling into Sunday we
[54:36] can't do a watch Night Service but next
[54:38] Sunday is first Sunday and the first
[54:41] Sunday of the year and we will have our
[54:43] regular service that'll be back at the
[54:44] school uh we'll be using the school
[54:46] again on Wednesday night it was just
[54:48] only for today that we were not able to
[54:50] get the school but we'll be right back
[54:52] there
[54:53] until God moves us to amen our final
[54:58] destination amen
[55:01] um this morning I would like to just
[55:04] take a thought on the attribute of
[55:08] salvation
[55:10] and man the attribute of Salvation And
[55:15] um just follow me on the journey here
[55:18] this morning we celebrate
[55:21] the Savior being born a man we celebrate
[55:25] that and um had he not come to the Earth
[55:29] uh we would be without hope but we thank
[55:33] God for the Savior being born but what
[55:37] actually makes him save is because the
[55:39] Savior not only born but he died and he
[55:42] rose again amen and uh and it's through
[55:45] his death that we're able to claim our
[55:48] salvation but I want to just just read a
[55:52] few uh uh quotes here and then we will
[55:55] hopefully he'll be able to kind of
[55:56] follow me with with this in this first
[55:59] um
[56:00] quote why are we not a denomination I
[56:04] think this kind of uh funny I didn't you
[56:07] know I didn't even recognize this but
[56:08] while we were sitting out there uh the
[56:10] young lady my wife had walked out and
[56:13] the young young lady said what type of
[56:15] church are y'all and she recognized how
[56:17] the sisters was dressed being from
[56:19] Apostolic background what kind of church
[56:22] are y'all are you on my wife said
[56:23] non-denominational she's like um that
[56:26] was lost she hadn't heard that one
[56:28] before so she waited when she got me
[56:30] like what does it mean she said I heard
[56:32] the lady say none something none not
[56:35] non-denominational and I say well that
[56:37] means we're not Baptist we're not
[56:39] Pentecost we're not Catholic we're not
[56:41] Episcopalian we're not no none of those
[56:44] names those titles that's denominational
[56:46] names we are just Christians who believe
[56:49] the Bible
[56:50] a man from Genesis to revelation we
[56:54] believe the Bible
[56:57] Hallelujah so that's what it means when
[57:00] we're non-denominational amen uh so here
[57:04] this this first uh uh quote is coming
[57:07] out coming out of why are we not a
[57:10] denomination here brother Graham says
[57:13] why which was first a savior or a sinner
[57:17] which was first a savior which was first
[57:20] A Healer or a sick person why was there
[57:24] permitted to be a sinner because the
[57:27] attributes of him is a savior Hallelujah
[57:31] if there had never been a sinner he'd
[57:34] never been known as a savior Hallelujah
[57:39] he can make all things wind around to
[57:41] his glory can the Potter say to or can
[57:45] the pot say to the Potter you made me
[57:48] thus who's on the wheel who's got the
[57:51] clay whose hands is it is it in Paul
[57:55] said oh foolish man didn't he say he
[57:57] raised Pharaoh up for this purpose
[57:59] certainly he knew that it he knew it
[58:02] before the before the uh there was a
[58:04] world he knowed who would be what and he
[58:07] let there be sin that he might be a
[58:10] savior he let there be sickness glory to
[58:13] God Amen that he might be a Healer he
[58:17] let there be hate that he might be loved
[58:20] sure he did he's God and that's his
[58:22] attributes and he has to have the same
[58:25] something he has to have something to
[58:27] display his attributes how would you
[58:29] ever know there was a night how would
[58:31] you ever know there was any if it was
[58:33] all daylight how would you how would you
[58:36] ever know there was night there's a
[58:38] night so it could prove daylight sure
[58:40] there is amen you see what he did
[58:45] I like this you know because and before
[58:48] there was a sickness
[58:49] there has to be a Healer before there's
[58:53] a sin there has to be a savior someone
[58:55] stronger than your sin
[58:58] someone stronger than the sickness that
[59:01] has you bound
[59:02] someone that can make a difference in
[59:04] that right amen and our lord Jesus is
[59:07] the one that can make make a difference
[59:09] and and I want I want us to try to uh
[59:11] get this when I'm talking about the
[59:13] attribute a man of Salvation just you
[59:16] know brother Brandon made a statement
[59:17] there he has to have something to
[59:20] display his attributes and uh and we're
[59:23] going to take a journey here through
[59:24] scripture because we we realize today
[59:27] um you know now let me let me be clear
[59:31] um we know about as Believers we know
[59:34] Jesus was not born on Christmas Day
[59:40] amen we know that Jesus was born in the
[59:42] springtime amen and we realize that
[59:45] hallelujah amen but I am happy that we
[59:49] at least get one day here that we can
[59:51] bring everybody attention to this
[59:53] amen yes they have paganized it and
[59:56] everything else but let's try to bring
[59:57] them back to the truth Jesus was born
[1:00:01] and he was born savior
[1:00:04] right now now here's the other thing I
[1:00:06] want us to get is that these attributes
[1:00:09] have been expressed throughout
[1:00:11] throughout the years in different
[1:00:12] situations the attribute of Savior has
[1:00:15] been expressed not only in our Lord and
[1:00:18] Savior Jesus Christ but even in other
[1:00:20] human beings he is let's just let this
[1:00:22] attribute be expressed
[1:00:24] let's just follow the path Amen on today
[1:00:27] now
[1:00:28] this is something I want us to remember
[1:00:30] all that God was
[1:00:33] he poured into Christ
[1:00:36] and all that Christ is amen if if he is
[1:00:40] savior glory to God if he is Redeemer if
[1:00:44] he is healer all that Christ is he is
[1:00:48] pouring that into his church
[1:00:51] oh Hallelujah somebody
[1:00:53] amen amen you got to realize what
[1:00:56] attributes are now going to be expressed
[1:00:58] through you
[1:00:59] amen amen listen to this if a lion gives
[1:01:03] birth
[1:01:04] praise God you expect another lion
[1:01:08] if a zebra gives birth
[1:01:11] you expect a baby zebra if a dog gives
[1:01:15] birth you expect a little dog amen if a
[1:01:20] human gives birth
[1:01:21] you expect another human to come forth
[1:01:24] if God gives birth
[1:01:28] hey you expect another God to come forth
[1:01:32] amen and God has given birth to his sons
[1:01:35] and his daughters
[1:01:37] and his attributes are being expressed
[1:01:40] through each one
[1:01:43] Hallelujah hearing this message Jesus
[1:01:45] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:01:47] forever
[1:01:48] amen and notice when you when you uh I
[1:01:52] didn't even know what it's all this but
[1:01:54] it's just my God there's so many little
[1:01:57] things uh that God let us know that he
[1:02:01] we write where he want us to be this one
[1:02:03] this quote was actually in Fairfield
[1:02:08] and I think his main Fairfield Maine and
[1:02:12] here we are at Fairfield
[1:02:15] all right Church
[1:02:18] here that the quote says God gave Jesus
[1:02:21] his Spirit without measure
[1:02:24] and him and him dwell the fullness of
[1:02:26] the godhead bodily he was God manifested
[1:02:29] In the Flesh the Bible said that God was
[1:02:32] in Christ reconciling the world to
[1:02:33] himself but when he gave out his Spirit
[1:02:36] to the to we adopted Sons
[1:02:39] he give us a bucket full out of that
[1:02:43] ocean
[1:02:43] he had all the fullness of the godhead
[1:02:46] we just have a portion of it as a gift
[1:02:50] of the Holy Spirit but if I took one
[1:02:54] bucket full of water out of the ocean or
[1:02:57] even a teaspoon full of it out of the
[1:02:59] ocean the same chemicals
[1:03:02] that's in the entire ocean would be in
[1:03:06] that spoonful
[1:03:08] hallelujah amen look if there's uh every
[1:03:12] every every attribute that is in God
[1:03:14] once he gives birth to another son those
[1:03:17] attributes are now in the children
[1:03:20] foreign
[1:03:21] all right now that's amen every he says
[1:03:24] uh uh the the same chemicals that's in
[1:03:26] the entire ocean would be in that
[1:03:28] Spoonful but just less in quantity not
[1:03:32] less in quality
[1:03:34] just less in quantity but not less in
[1:03:38] quality is the same God
[1:03:44] it ain't the same God that they were
[1:03:46] looking for in the manger it's the same
[1:03:48] God dwelling in your hearts today
[1:03:52] Hallelujah and if he's the same God he
[1:03:55] got the same power he got the same
[1:03:57] Authority he got the same anointing it's
[1:04:00] the same God but just less in quantity
[1:04:03] not less in quality so the same holy
[1:04:06] spirit that was in Christ
[1:04:08] is in his church I I love this I love
[1:04:13] this y'all just bear with me here we
[1:04:15] read the scripture Luke 2 11 it says
[1:04:18] from to you is Born This Day in the city
[1:04:21] of David a savior which is Christ the
[1:04:24] lord I was just looking at a man that
[1:04:27] definition there and a portion of this
[1:04:30] definition out of this book I have the
[1:04:32] key to the Bible and it says a savior is
[1:04:36] a preserver
[1:04:37] it's a Defender
[1:04:40] a man a deliverer
[1:04:42] amen and and uh they they put God is
[1:04:46] preeminently the savior of his people as
[1:04:49] their creator preserver and deliverer
[1:04:51] but like I told you amen we'll be able
[1:04:54] to kind of go back in scripture and see
[1:04:55] that God has allowed this attribute to
[1:04:58] be expressed through other people
[1:05:01] hallelujah we're going to go back in the
[1:05:02] Old Testament and pick up he was allowed
[1:05:04] on this attribute to be expressed in
[1:05:06] other people because he himself would be
[1:05:09] the ultimate savior
[1:05:11] oh Hallelujah
[1:05:14] y'all just stay with me here all right
[1:05:17] I want to just bring in a man just
[1:05:19] another little thought out of that day
[1:05:21] on Calvary
[1:05:24] Hallelujah Jesus
[1:05:27] thank you Lord
[1:05:29] all right
[1:05:31] um that day on Calvary says this and
[1:05:33] When sin struck the Earth
[1:05:36] back in the beginning like a sheet of
[1:05:38] Blackness
[1:05:40] falling from the heaven it literally
[1:05:42] paralyzed the Earth
[1:05:45] it thrown every creature on the earth
[1:05:47] and all of God's creation in bondage
[1:05:50] this was the need for Jesus right it
[1:05:54] says man was under bondage of death
[1:05:56] sickness trouble Sorrows all nature fell
[1:06:00] with it sin was an anesthetic that
[1:06:03] actually paralyzed the Earth and then we
[1:06:06] were set here hopeless
[1:06:10] because every creature on Earth was
[1:06:12] subject to it and everyone born on Earth
[1:06:14] was subject to it so it had to come from
[1:06:16] some place where there was no sin
[1:06:21] oh Hallelujah this is why Jesus had to
[1:06:24] come to Earth he had to come from a
[1:06:26] place where there was no sin
[1:06:29] it came from glory and he's going he
[1:06:31] went back to Glory came from God and
[1:06:33] went back to God we also came from God
[1:06:36] and we're going back to God
[1:06:39] we came from a place where there was no
[1:06:42] sin we came from a place where there was
[1:06:44] no sickness we came from a place where
[1:06:47] there was no disease that's why we
[1:06:49] always land for healing
[1:06:51] Hallelujah we know what it's like to be
[1:06:54] in a place where there was none of these
[1:06:55] things
[1:06:57] hey there was a place where there was no
[1:06:59] heart trouble there was a place where
[1:07:01] there was no diabetes
[1:07:03] Hallelujah there was a place where there
[1:07:05] was no surgeries there was a place and I
[1:07:08] longed to go back to that place
[1:07:13] praise His holy name
[1:07:15] oh my my my my he had that so he had to
[1:07:19] come from uh uh he says everyone born
[1:07:22] and subject to it so it had to come from
[1:07:24] some place where there was no sin it
[1:07:27] could not come from the earth one of us
[1:07:29] cannot redeem the other
[1:07:32] it had to come from another therefore
[1:07:36] when man realized that he was separated
[1:07:39] from his God he become a Wanderer
[1:07:42] they wept they cried they toiled they
[1:07:46] wandered about through the mountains and
[1:07:47] through the desert seeking a city whose
[1:07:49] building make it was God for he knew
[1:07:52] that if he ever got into the presence of
[1:07:54] God he could talk it over with his with
[1:07:56] his uh with him but there's no there was
[1:08:00] no way back he become lost he didn't
[1:08:02] know which way to turn so he just took
[1:08:05] out wandering trying to find somewhere
[1:08:06] that he could find a way back to that
[1:08:09] place something on the inside of him
[1:08:10] told him that he come from a place that
[1:08:14] was perfect
[1:08:16] something told him that he come from a
[1:08:18] place
[1:08:19] that was perfect
[1:08:22] we realized we needed a savior
[1:08:25] because man could not save himself
[1:08:29] Hallelujah and he got to understand
[1:08:31] there are situations that happen in life
[1:08:33] that require a savior
[1:08:36] oh my
[1:08:38] just normal situations can happen in
[1:08:40] life
[1:08:41] uh I was trying to save this to a little
[1:08:44] later but I'm gonna have to inject it
[1:08:45] now
[1:08:48] um as a young lad
[1:08:51] a very small boy
[1:08:53] I was uh in a
[1:08:56] um
[1:08:57] situation where I needed a savior
[1:09:00] and as a little boy I was there playing
[1:09:03] with my cousins at a pool
[1:09:06] and um you know they were at one end of
[1:09:09] the pool swimming and and I had three
[1:09:11] cousins they really they couldn't swim a
[1:09:14] man so they stayed in the shallow end of
[1:09:16] the pool but they were babysitting me
[1:09:18] all of my cousins were older than I was
[1:09:20] and they were babysitting me and I was
[1:09:22] going just around the pool and I started
[1:09:24] in the shallow and I would throw a rock
[1:09:25] in and get a rock out throw a rock in
[1:09:27] and get that rock out scoop it right out
[1:09:29] and I moved myself down to the deep end
[1:09:32] of the pool and and while they're
[1:09:33] playing they didn't see me at the deep
[1:09:34] end of the pool and I threw the Rock in
[1:09:37] and I went to scoop to get it out
[1:09:40] and uh this time the rock went a little
[1:09:42] bit too far in
[1:09:44] and all I you know all I know that
[1:09:46] happened is that I fell into the pool
[1:09:48] and my cousins could not get me out
[1:09:51] because they didn't know how to swim and
[1:09:53] it just so uh be uh what happened is
[1:09:56] that the Lifeguard that was not on duty
[1:09:59] that they happened to be skating by the
[1:10:00] pool at the same time that I fell in and
[1:10:03] she had skates on right and she she took
[1:10:07] one skate off but couldn't get the other
[1:10:08] one off but she jumped into the pool
[1:10:11] with one skate on
[1:10:13] and she got me out of the pool and they
[1:10:15] called 9-1-1 at that time and and all I
[1:10:18] remember is is uh waking up and all
[1:10:21] these people were surrounding amen this
[1:10:24] little fell in the arms of a of a
[1:10:26] fireman and uh and and somehow they
[1:10:28] pumped the water out and and and they
[1:10:31] had a helicopter there and all these
[1:10:32] people and the firemen did something I'm
[1:10:34] laying in his lap they probably thought
[1:10:36] I was gone and all of a sudden my eyes
[1:10:37] just popped open
[1:10:40] Hallelujah I want to tell you something
[1:10:43] that lady that day
[1:10:46] [Music]
[1:10:48] became my savior
[1:10:52] she'd not been there that attribute
[1:10:56] would not have been expressed
[1:10:59] I don't even know if she's a Christian
[1:11:01] I'm gonna tell you another thing I don't
[1:11:03] even know her name
[1:11:06] I haven't kept in contact with her
[1:11:08] whatever happened that day that it ended
[1:11:11] on that day but that day that lady
[1:11:13] became a savior to me
[1:11:17] the attribute was expressed in her
[1:11:20] but I'm here to tell you I needed a
[1:11:22] greater savior than that
[1:11:24] oh I was trying to save it
[1:11:27] the reason I needed a great escape
[1:11:28] because I was sinking
[1:11:31] open sin
[1:11:33] open the peaceful Soul very deeply Glory
[1:11:39] staying with him I was seeking to rise
[1:11:42] no more hey Superman

[1:12:25] Hallelujah
[1:12:27] we needed a savior
[1:12:31] see my my life was Justice I mean my
[1:12:34] spiritual life was worse than my natural
[1:12:37] life drowning in that pool
[1:12:39] some of us are drowning in a pool of sin
[1:12:46] but my God got somebody who can rescue
[1:12:48] you
[1:12:49] and let me tell you something mama can't
[1:12:51] do it Daddy can't do it Pastor can't do
[1:12:55] it but Jesus can
[1:12:59] this is why you gotta have a personal
[1:13:01] experience with the Lord Jesus you're
[1:13:03] wandering drowning in sin don't know
[1:13:06] which way to turn
[1:13:09] but there's a savior
[1:13:13] somebody can save you from that
[1:13:15] put you on the right path
[1:13:18] Hallelujah he's a savior
[1:13:21] glory to his name
[1:13:24] my God my God my God my God man cannot
[1:13:28] redeem himself
[1:13:31] he needs a redeemer
[1:13:34] man cannot save himself I was drowned I
[1:13:36] could not save myself I needed a savior
[1:13:42] God begins to tell the story salvation
[1:13:44] or Redemption through the various
[1:13:46] characters
[1:13:47] in the scripture one of them a man is in
[1:13:51] the
[1:13:52] uh
[1:13:54] uh the character of Joshua
[1:13:57] and we just look at a man Joshua 10 and
[1:14:01] 6. the scripture says something about
[1:14:03] him and
[1:14:04] you know Joshua
[1:14:06] was
[1:14:08] um
[1:14:09] he was the one that was ordained to lead
[1:14:12] the people into the Promised Land
[1:14:14] and uh you know and as he's taking a man
[1:14:16] he brother Brandon even say he had a
[1:14:18] greater responsibility than even Moses
[1:14:20] did because they had to take a man then
[1:14:22] he had to divide the land up to him you
[1:14:25] know all appropriately and uh you know
[1:14:27] and one of the things that happened with
[1:14:28] Joshua my God uh uh he he made a an
[1:14:34] agreement with some people that he never
[1:14:36] should have made an agreement with
[1:14:37] and when he made that agreement he had
[1:14:40] to hold to his word
[1:14:42] no matter what conditions the people was
[1:14:43] in he had to hold to his word it kind of
[1:14:47] showed one of the attributes of God that
[1:14:49] when God makes you a promise
[1:14:51] no matter what the condition he has to
[1:14:54] hold to his word
[1:14:58] surgery no surgery God the heart to his
[1:15:01] word
[1:15:02] thank you
[1:15:03] hey he will never he'll never go back on
[1:15:06] his word
[1:15:08] brother I I tell you he'll bankrupt the
[1:15:10] heavens before you can call him a liar
[1:15:14] you're gonna find a way to make that
[1:15:16] thing come to pass
[1:15:19] Joshua you know was there he made this
[1:15:22] agreement
[1:15:23] it's people to give me a night so I
[1:15:25] believe their name was and uh um you
[1:15:28] know after he got tricked by them and
[1:15:29] made disagreement but he had to hold to
[1:15:31] his word now there was a situation where
[1:15:33] the Gibby Knights got themselves in
[1:15:34] trouble
[1:15:35] Hallelujah in Joshua 10 6 it says this
[1:15:38] the men of gibeon sent unto Joshua
[1:15:42] to the camp of gilgall
[1:15:45] my saying slack not thy hand from thy
[1:15:48] servants
[1:15:49] come up to us quickly
[1:15:52] and save us
[1:15:55] so this attribute of Savior was being
[1:15:59] manifested in Joshua
[1:16:02] now yeah this is a little deep this is
[1:16:04] going to go a little deeper now look at
[1:16:06] this they weren't even asking for God to
[1:16:08] come help
[1:16:10] right
[1:16:12] where was God represented
[1:16:18] when your family is calling calling to
[1:16:21] you for prayer
[1:16:23] they're not going directly to God why
[1:16:26] are they coming to you because the
[1:16:29] attributes of God are expressed through
[1:16:31] you
[1:16:32] [Music]
[1:16:34] oh imma read it a little bit later I
[1:16:36] might as well say it now we're not
[1:16:38] worshiping Christ in the manger
[1:16:41] but we worship in Christ and young the
[1:16:44] hope of glory
[1:16:49] oh Hallelujah
[1:16:51] the man of giving Senator Joshua to the
[1:16:54] camp uh to the camp to gilgall saying
[1:16:56] slack not thy hand from thy servants
[1:16:57] come up to us quickly and save us and
[1:17:00] help us for all the kings of the
[1:17:02] amorites that dwell in the mountains
[1:17:04] that gather together against us
[1:17:06] so salvation came through Joshua's
[1:17:09] Ministry
[1:17:10] amen all right let's go on a little
[1:17:13] further
[1:17:14] his name actually meant Jehovah's savior
[1:17:17] that's what the name Joshua means so let
[1:17:20] me just read a little quote out of the
[1:17:21] way of a true prophet of God
[1:17:24] the way of a true prophet of God it says
[1:17:26] this
[1:17:27] says then I gave the illustration of how
[1:17:30] that Israel on the march to the promised
[1:17:31] land they had never seen that land
[1:17:34] they know nothing about it they just had
[1:17:37] a promise of God there was a land and it
[1:17:40] was full of milk and honey and good and
[1:17:42] a great place they had never seen it
[1:17:45] nobody had ever been there or know
[1:17:48] nothing about it but they had the
[1:17:50] promise of it and by faith they
[1:17:53] sojourned through the desert and when
[1:17:56] they got right to the borderline they
[1:18:00] had a warrior there by the name of
[1:18:01] Joshua which means Jehovah's savior so
[1:18:04] he crossed over to Jordan into the
[1:18:05] promised land and brought back the
[1:18:07] evidence that the lamb was there I like
[1:18:09] that
[1:18:11] he says and it was a good land two-man
[1:18:14] pack one bunch of grapes it was a good
[1:18:17] land so he brought back the evidence
[1:18:19] that the land that they were going to
[1:18:21] possess was there
[1:18:23] all right he goes on it says now to the
[1:18:26] church we adjourning him to the land of
[1:18:28] immortality a land where there is no
[1:18:31] death a land where there's no dads
[1:18:33] raised up and we had a great savior in
[1:18:36] our camp and Jesus means Jehovah's
[1:18:40] savior beloved and he crossed the Jordan
[1:18:42] of death over into the other land and
[1:18:44] come back and brought the evidence that
[1:18:46] we live after death amen so where is
[1:18:50] death at
[1:18:53] my God
[1:18:58] can't stop us
[1:19:01] so here I want to just kind of show
[1:19:03] something Joshua crossing over amen into
[1:19:06] the promised land and bringing back the
[1:19:08] evidence that it was a good land was a
[1:19:11] perfect type of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:19:13] crossing over amen and bringing back
[1:19:15] evidence that there's life after death I
[1:19:18] just wrote These down he crossed Jordan
[1:19:20] and brought back a good report that the
[1:19:21] land was flown with milk and honey
[1:19:23] Jordan and the spiritual represents
[1:19:25] death and Jesus went across Jordan and
[1:19:28] rose again amen after the third day he
[1:19:31] proved that the lamb was good on the
[1:19:33] other side of death amen father believer
[1:19:36] it's an eternal land where we never get
[1:19:39] sick and we won't die again

[1:20:28] just give your heart to Jesus
[1:20:31] and you can have this peace
[1:20:34] that passes all understanding
[1:20:37] God began to tell the story of Salvation
[1:20:40] and Redemption through various
[1:20:41] characters in the scripture I want to
[1:20:42] pick up another scripture here really
[1:20:43] quick
[1:20:45] um and this scripture is actually where
[1:20:46] my thought was was uh originated from I
[1:20:49] referred to it
[1:20:51] um in the past but I never read it to
[1:20:54] you Nehemiah 9 verse 24 Nia Maya
[1:20:58] nine Lord while you had me save this
[1:21:02] scripture for the day
[1:21:05] Nehemiah
[1:21:07] nine
[1:21:13] verse 24.
[1:21:15] God is a good god
[1:21:20] Nehemiah 9 and verse 24 says this so the
[1:21:23] children
[1:21:24] went in and possessed the land
[1:21:27] and thou subdue us before them the
[1:21:30] inhabitants of the Lamb the Canaanites
[1:21:32] and gave us them into their hands with
[1:21:35] their kings and the people of the Lamb
[1:21:37] that they might do with them as they
[1:21:39] would
[1:21:40] and they took strong cities
[1:21:43] and a fat lamb and possess Houses full
[1:21:47] of all Goods Wells dig Vineyards and
[1:21:50] Olive yards and fruit trees in abundance
[1:21:52] so they did eat and were filled and
[1:21:55] became fat
[1:21:56] and delighted themselves in thy great
[1:21:59] goodness
[1:22:00] nevertheless they were disobedient and
[1:22:04] rebelled against thee and cast thou law
[1:22:07] behind their backs and slew thy prophets
[1:22:10] which testified against them to turn
[1:22:12] them to thee and they wrought great
[1:22:15] provocations
[1:22:18] therefore thou deliverest them into the
[1:22:20] hand of their enemies who vexed them and
[1:22:23] in the time of their trouble when they
[1:22:25] cry unto thee that's all you need to do
[1:22:28] when you're in trouble just crying to
[1:22:29] him when they cry unto thee thou hurteth
[1:22:32] then from heaven and according to thy
[1:22:34] manifold Mercies
[1:22:37] thou camest him
[1:22:41] not just one savior
[1:22:46] but the Bible say thou gave us them
[1:22:51] saviors
[1:22:53] plural
[1:22:55] so you see that the attribute of
[1:22:57] Salvation is expressed
[1:23:01] through the members of his body
[1:23:03] you know I I there's another quote I
[1:23:05] ain't got it here with me but I brother
[1:23:07] Branham said that the bride is the blood
[1:23:10] of Christ
[1:23:12] on the Earth today
[1:23:14] you realize the great place that we play
[1:23:18] you are the blood of Christ
[1:23:21] yes sir thou gave us them saviors who
[1:23:25] saved them out of the hand of their
[1:23:26] enemies
[1:23:28] I was just looking at this because
[1:23:31] the Hebrew lexicon when you look click
[1:23:33] on that word savior's there
[1:23:35] it means
[1:23:37] to be delivered
[1:23:39] to be liberated
[1:23:41] be saved
[1:23:44] um uh to be victorious in battle
[1:23:48] right it also means this to save from
[1:23:51] moral trouble
[1:23:53] amen all right that's good so sometimes
[1:23:56] God can send you a savior that might be
[1:24:00] bringing you advice
[1:24:04] might be speaking to you amen advice and
[1:24:07] it's Godly advice and they could be
[1:24:10] saving you from moral troubles
[1:24:13] because those moral troubles will lead
[1:24:15] you to Greater trouble
[1:24:17] your moral failures will lead to Greater
[1:24:20] troubles
[1:24:21] oh hallelujah hallelujah but God wants
[1:24:24] to send Save Us he'll send the pastor as
[1:24:28] a savior he'll send Mom and Daddy as a
[1:24:31] savior he'll send a mother in the church
[1:24:33] as a savior
[1:24:36] to save you from your destruction
[1:24:42] let's look at a scripture I'm gonna just
[1:24:44] just write this a little bit Exodus 2
[1:24:47] 17. this when you click on that word
[1:24:49] savior there in the Greek Lexicon it
[1:24:51] just kind of goes through all kind of
[1:24:53] scriptures amen uh and and here's one
[1:24:56] that will find Exodus 2 17. this is
[1:24:59] Moses
[1:25:01] Hallelujah Moses was there uh watching
[1:25:05] he wasn't even watching he was just he
[1:25:07] just happened to be at a well one day
[1:25:09] and uh and and Jethro's daughters came
[1:25:11] out to get some water for that for the
[1:25:13] sheep and for the animals and Moses saw
[1:25:16] these men come and just kind of Bogart
[1:25:18] their way so Moses stood up and he had
[1:25:20] to step in and become a
[1:25:25] he had to be a savior
[1:25:27] and the Shepherds came and drove them
[1:25:28] away but Moses stood up and helped them
[1:25:31] when the Bible said he helped them that
[1:25:33] means he became a savior amen and helped
[1:25:35] them and watered their flock
[1:25:38] here's another one in Exodus 14 and
[1:25:40] verse 30. Hallelujah this is God himself
[1:25:43] showing that he's a savior thus the Lord
[1:25:46] saved Israel that day out of the hand of
[1:25:49] the Egyptians and Israel saw the
[1:25:52] Egyptians dead upon the seashore God
[1:25:55] himself expressing this attribute of
[1:25:57] Salvation let's pick up another one in
[1:25:59] second Kings chapter 13 verse one
[1:26:01] through five God just showed him that
[1:26:04] this attribute was always there but
[1:26:06] something had to be in trouble before he
[1:26:08] could actually express it
[1:26:10] Hallelujah see I'm going to tell you
[1:26:13] um sometimes we don't we we know God
[1:26:15] through
[1:26:16] our parents experience we know God
[1:26:19] through our pastors experience but we
[1:26:23] don't know God through our own
[1:26:24] experience
[1:26:26] and the only way you're going to get to
[1:26:27] know God through your own experience
[1:26:28] you're gonna have to go through your own
[1:26:30] things
[1:26:33] and when you when he delivers you from
[1:26:35] your own things then you can stand up
[1:26:37] and testify and say I know him as a
[1:26:40] savior
[1:26:41] because he saved me
[1:26:46] my God my God
[1:26:49] that that that that some mean a little
[1:26:51] bit multi when you got your own
[1:26:52] experience when I think about the
[1:26:55] goodness of Jesus
[1:26:58] and all he's done for me
[1:27:03] because I ain't talking about for you
[1:27:04] I'm talking about for me my soul Cries
[1:27:07] Out
[1:27:08] Hallelujah I thank God for saving me
[1:27:16] yes sir amen all right
[1:27:20] Second Kings 13 verse one through five
[1:27:22] and
[1:27:23] the three and twentieth year of Joe
[1:27:25] asked the son of a has he a king of
[1:27:27] Judah Jehovah has the son of jehu began
[1:27:30] to Reign Over Israel and Samaria and
[1:27:32] reigned 17 years
[1:27:33] and he did that which was even the sight
[1:27:35] of the Lord and followed the sins of
[1:27:36] jeroboam the sons the son of nabat which
[1:27:40] made Israel a sin he departed not there
[1:27:42] from
[1:27:43] and the anger of the Lord was kindled
[1:27:45] against Israel and delivered them into
[1:27:47] the hand of Hazel king of Syria and into
[1:27:49] the hand of binidad the son of hazia all
[1:27:52] their days and Jihad has be sought the
[1:27:55] Lord he began to cry out to God now
[1:27:57] anytime you're in trouble just begin to
[1:27:59] cry out to God and Jihad Jihad has but
[1:28:03] sought the Lord and the Lord hearken
[1:28:05] unto him for he saw the oppression of
[1:28:07] Israel because the king of Syria
[1:28:09] oppressed him look at this and the lord
[1:28:12] gave Israel
[1:28:14] a savior
[1:28:18] so they would that so that they went out
[1:28:20] from under the hand of syrians and the
[1:28:22] children of Israel dwelt in their tents
[1:28:24] as before time now according to history
[1:28:26] this this uh savior that they got was
[1:28:29] actually somebody from a whole nother
[1:28:30] land that came and fought the king of
[1:28:32] Syria and it brought Deliverance to
[1:28:34] Israel God used somebody else to bring
[1:28:37] Salvation God used somebody else to
[1:28:40] bring Deliverance God used somebody else
[1:28:43] to express that attribute through
[1:28:47] and if God was sinned amen the
[1:28:50] Israelites when they were in trouble a
[1:28:51] savior
[1:28:53] what will he do for you
[1:28:57] Abraham was a savior
[1:29:01] to life
[1:29:04] lot got himself in trouble
[1:29:07] and see here's the thing about a savior
[1:29:09] you got to understand this this
[1:29:11] attribute the thing about the same is
[1:29:13] that you so far messed up you can't do
[1:29:17] nothing about it
[1:29:19] you so deep in you can't help yourself
[1:29:22] out of it you need a savior
[1:29:28] you need to say
[1:29:30] the same times your doctor can be a
[1:29:31] savior
[1:29:33] huh amen because they got they can they
[1:29:36] can help you get out of the situation
[1:29:38] that's you in your body's so messed up
[1:29:41] you need a savior
[1:29:42] [Music]
[1:29:44] God allows this attribute to be
[1:29:46] expressed in so many different ways
[1:29:49] amen oftentimes we want to limit it to
[1:29:52] just just just just this Christmas day
[1:29:54] but this attribute has been expressed
[1:29:56] throughout history
[1:29:58] and it is still being expressed
[1:30:01] through his bride
[1:30:04] brother random makes this statement here
[1:30:07] uh in the message the faith of the the
[1:30:09] faith of Abraham he says when when
[1:30:11] you're saved
[1:30:13] when you're saved
[1:30:15] God gives you a checkbook
[1:30:19] at the bottom of it it's got Jesus's
[1:30:22] name signed on every check
[1:30:24] any Redemptive blessing belongs to you
[1:30:29] are you afraid to fill it out and
[1:30:32] Abraham's children and are you afraid he
[1:30:35] won't recognize the name of Jesus
[1:30:38] whatever you ask the father in my name
[1:30:41] that will I do
[1:30:43] that's the promise your Abraham's
[1:30:46] children you're not afraid to fill it
[1:30:48] out the bank of heaven will recognize
[1:30:50] the name of Jesus on any Redemptive
[1:30:53] blessing that his body's setting at the
[1:30:56] right hand of God making intercessions
[1:30:58] for that's what he died for
[1:31:02] says now Abraham sure he was Heir then
[1:31:06] after a while a lot got in trouble
[1:31:08] says now we'll close in a minute lot got
[1:31:11] in trouble and you always get in trouble
[1:31:13] when you backslide
[1:31:16] wish we had time to dwell on that but he
[1:31:19] got in trouble what happened the enemy
[1:31:21] come and packed him off
[1:31:23] took him somewhere he never thought he'd
[1:31:24] be at
[1:31:25] right says now Abraham played the part
[1:31:31] of the Savior again
[1:31:33] all the way back in Genesis this
[1:31:36] attribute of Salvation is being
[1:31:39] expressed
[1:31:40] when when lot found himself in trouble
[1:31:42] he couldn't save himself let me let me
[1:31:45] let me just finish reading this he
[1:31:47] gathers himself and went after the enemy
[1:31:48] that's took away the his poor Bachelor
[1:31:51] corrupted brother that's what Jesus did
[1:31:54] sickness bound you sin bounds you poor
[1:31:56] backslid and corrupted and Jesus came in
[1:31:58] and went after you he brought lot back
[1:32:01] Abraham did look at this now Lord was
[1:32:03] overtaken and captured
[1:32:06] he had he he uh had he and his City been
[1:32:10] strong enough they would have defeated
[1:32:11] the opposing Army
[1:32:14] hallelujah amen had he and his City been
[1:32:17] strong enough they would have defeated
[1:32:19] the opposing Army but lot needed someone
[1:32:22] greater than he was to bring Deliverance
[1:32:28] amen he had
[1:32:32] he had a man a savior got to be willing
[1:32:34] to put it all on the line
[1:32:36] a savior got to be willing to Amen to
[1:32:38] take uh take it right to death's door
[1:32:41] amen
[1:32:42] amen a savior got to be willing to die
[1:32:45] for you
[1:32:47] Hallelujah we just can't go around amen
[1:32:50] claiming it's time to not be willing to
[1:32:51] Amen to put some skin in the game
[1:32:53] [Music]
[1:32:55] Hallelujah but
[1:32:57] Abraham shows that he had this attribute
[1:33:00] he was willing to take whatever he had
[1:33:02] all he had was Farm instruments
[1:33:05] he didn't have a gun he didn't have a
[1:33:07] cannon he didn't have a spirit he had
[1:33:09] Farm instruments but he took his farm
[1:33:11] instruments and with them and conquered
[1:33:14] that army
[1:33:17] a savior put it all on the line
[1:33:21] oh Hallelujah I'm thinking about a amen
[1:33:24] a a young lady a man that one day let me
[1:33:28] just get my place here one day she was
[1:33:30] uh she was coming home from college and
[1:33:33] she was uh on the train glory to God
[1:33:36] coming home from college and her and a
[1:33:38] friend was there on the train and and a
[1:33:41] friend looked out the window said oh wow
[1:33:43] they was talking about everybody amen if
[1:33:45] they were coming home and look at this
[1:33:47] person look at that person and they had
[1:33:49] they done got underneath that anointing
[1:33:52] glory to God and uh and so so now today
[1:33:55] under the anointed see she should have
[1:33:57] broke that anointed don't talk about
[1:33:58] them they don't you don't know why they
[1:34:00] like that she should have broke that as
[1:34:02] soon as it started but she allowed
[1:34:04] herself to get caught up underneath that
[1:34:05] anointing amen and then they get to a
[1:34:08] spot and a friend takes it a little
[1:34:09] further than the girl wanted it to go
[1:34:11] she said now look at that lady my
[1:34:15] why did she why is she even outside
[1:34:16] looking like that and then officiency I
[1:34:19] don't know why she like that
[1:34:21] Hallelujah and then she gotta get off
[1:34:24] the get off the train like she'll know
[1:34:25] the lady what a conductor
[1:34:27] got both on a friend say I I ain't
[1:34:30] taking the train no further I need to
[1:34:32] have a conversation with you how can you
[1:34:34] let sit here and let that girl talk
[1:34:36] about your mama like that
[1:34:39] call all them kind of names say say now
[1:34:42] you a pretty young lady and I give you
[1:34:45] that but your mama was way more prettier
[1:34:48] than you are
[1:34:50] but you want to know what happened there
[1:34:52] was a fire one day in a house amen and
[1:34:55] when and when your mom was outside they
[1:34:57] didn't realize that she didn't realize
[1:34:59] if they would come to fire for her house
[1:35:01] she knew you was upstairs in the crib
[1:35:04] and and the firemen would not go
[1:35:06] upstairs to get you so she sacrificed
[1:35:09] her beauty she ran through the flame to
[1:35:12] the fire she would have been got you and
[1:35:15] took the clothes off her back wrapped
[1:35:17] you in the clothes so she could protect
[1:35:19] your beauty
[1:35:21] and she came running down the stairs she
[1:35:25] sacrificed everything she had in order
[1:35:27] to save you and you're gonna sit here
[1:35:29] and let somebody talked about her like
[1:35:31] that
[1:35:33] mama was willing to be
[1:35:35] [Music]
[1:35:38] you got to be willing to put it all on
[1:35:40] the line
[1:35:47] for your family you got to be willing to
[1:35:49] be a savior
[1:35:50] [Music]
[1:35:53] see oftentimes in family we want to be
[1:35:56] judged
[1:36:00] but he sent saviors
[1:36:06] what are you willing to sacrifice for
[1:36:08] the family
[1:36:11] what are you willing to give up for for
[1:36:12] the family
[1:36:14] for the sake of the family
[1:36:23] a lot needed someone greater than he was
[1:36:26] to bring Deliverance
[1:36:28] and he had a relative that was willing
[1:36:31] to do whatever it took
[1:36:33] to bring Salvation
[1:36:37] see when we look at that scripture that
[1:36:39] he sent save us
[1:36:42] over in Nehemiah 9 27 thou gave us some
[1:36:45] savings you can just go all through
[1:36:47] scripture
[1:36:48] um go back to the Book of Judges and you
[1:36:50] would see there was a number amen of
[1:36:54] different times that God used saviors
[1:36:58] um men that were raised up as judges and
[1:37:01] that they would bring Deliverance to the
[1:37:03] people
[1:37:04] um
[1:37:07] shamgar
[1:37:09] Barack Gideon
[1:37:12] Jeffy
[1:37:14] Samson even himself was a savior
[1:37:18] and I recently this year the Lord just
[1:37:20] kind of put that in my spirit when I
[1:37:22] looked at Esther
[1:37:24] Esther's highest position was not to be
[1:37:27] Queen that's what she thought
[1:37:30] but our highest position was to be
[1:37:32] savior
[1:37:37] and God put us there just to see if that
[1:37:39] would be expressed to her
[1:37:41] and then put her under pressure
[1:37:44] because Esther had to come to a a a a a
[1:37:46] a revelation herself if I die let me die
[1:37:51] you say look look let's say I know if I
[1:37:53] if I don't get that scepter I'm gonna
[1:37:55] die but if I die let me die I'm gonna go
[1:37:58] in and see the king there was only two
[1:38:00] people higher than Haman
[1:38:02] in the Kingdom that was that was a king
[1:38:04] in Esther
[1:38:07] but nobody else can invite Haman to
[1:38:10] dinner he'd show up and go to dinner
[1:38:12] only Esther could do something like that
[1:38:15] but Mordecai had to let her know how how
[1:38:17] do you know how do you not know
[1:38:20] that God didn't bring you to the kingdom
[1:38:24] for such a time as this
[1:38:27] and what time was that it was time for
[1:38:29] her to express the attributes
[1:38:33] [Music]
[1:38:37] oh I just love Jesus
[1:38:42] my God my God
[1:38:46] rehab
[1:38:51] no rehab was not a prostitute
[1:38:55] God had a higher position for Rahab she
[1:39:00] just needed an opportunity
[1:39:01] [Music]
[1:39:04] and and when these these two
[1:39:08] they took it back
[1:39:12] and I got a quote for this I got a quote
[1:39:15] let me read something to you about rehab
[1:39:19] this is out of the sermon
[1:39:22] God's wrapped gift brother Brandon
[1:39:25] preached this on
[1:39:27] December 25th
[1:39:30] 1960. look at listen to something here
[1:39:33] bear with me
[1:39:36] are y'all with me
[1:39:40] rehab the Harlot
[1:39:42] that we're all familiar with
[1:39:45] she being a young girl
[1:39:48] that was turned on the street
[1:39:51] by a heathen father and mother
[1:39:55] that put her on the street
[1:39:58] because she was beautiful
[1:40:02] and was to bring an income to them on
[1:40:05] prostitution
[1:40:08] her mama
[1:40:10] and her daddy
[1:40:12] cited because she was beautiful that
[1:40:15] they could make some money off their
[1:40:18] daughter and turn her into a prostitute
[1:40:24] I'm trying I I can't even read the rest
[1:40:27] of the quote I'm gonna just have to just
[1:40:28] inject because this just this as I was
[1:40:31] reading to say wait a minute
[1:40:33] her mama agreed to this
[1:40:36] I can
[1:40:38] dad has got some strange thoughts
[1:40:40] sometimes especially if they're not
[1:40:41] working men
[1:40:42] [Music]
[1:40:45] but Mama agreed or something like this
[1:40:47] that you would put your daughter out
[1:40:50] there in the streets and make money off
[1:40:53] of have her bring the money home to your
[1:40:54] house to pay bills
[1:40:58] now now this is this is a thing to me if
[1:41:01] Rahab lived today
[1:41:04] and she went to a man a counselor for
[1:41:07] therapy I can understand rehab being
[1:41:10] upset with her parents
[1:41:14] I'm upset with both my mama and my daddy
[1:41:18] but when the when the spies came
[1:41:22] rather than rehab showing amen how upset
[1:41:27] she was with her parents
[1:41:31] rehab begin to act like a save
[1:41:35] feel like shouting
[1:41:42] the word makes me sound
[1:41:45] rehab begin to act like a savior the
[1:41:49] saving Jesus acted on the cross
[1:41:52] father forgive them for they know not
[1:41:55] what they do
[1:42:01] perhaps said I'm happy about my house
[1:42:04] having this token
[1:42:08] but what about my father and my mother
[1:42:12] what about my brothers and my sisters
[1:42:15] the two spies say if you can just get
[1:42:17] them
[1:42:20] you just get them in the house
[1:42:24] and whoever's underneath this token
[1:42:27] they blood be on us
[1:42:30] she had a right
[1:42:32] [Music]
[1:42:35] she had a right to hold the grudge
[1:42:38] against her parents
[1:42:39] [Music]
[1:42:42] but a savior
[1:42:45] got to be willing to sacrifice
[1:42:48] [Music]
[1:42:51] you
[1:42:52] [Music]
[1:42:56] can see this attribute
[1:42:59] being expressed through characters of
[1:43:01] the scripture
[1:43:04] when you look at me to see man salvation
[1:43:06] he sent saviors all all along up Abraham
[1:43:09] all the way up he's sin and save you
[1:43:11] save your save you save your savior but
[1:43:12] why did we need Jesus
[1:43:14] [Music]
[1:43:21] Matthew 1.
[1:43:28] verse 20.
[1:43:38] primary reason you needed Jesus
[1:43:42] because man can't redeem himself
[1:43:46] there's a lot of folk when I got saved
[1:43:48] by that lifeguard out of water
[1:43:51] it's one thing to be saved out of water
[1:43:53] it's one thing to be saved in an
[1:43:54] accident maybe somebody get you out of a
[1:43:56] fire that's one form of salvation
[1:43:59] but a greater form
[1:44:01] because there was nobody
[1:44:04] that could save me from my sins
[1:44:07] that's why I needed Jesus
[1:44:15] Matthew 1 verse 20 says but while he
[1:44:17] fought on these things behold the angel
[1:44:18] the Lord appeared unto him in a dream
[1:44:21] saying Joseph thou son of David fear not
[1:44:24] to taking the mayor thy wife of that
[1:44:26] that which is conceived in her is of the
[1:44:28] Holy Ghost
[1:44:30] and he and she shall bring forth a son
[1:44:32] and thou shalt call his name Jesus
[1:44:36] for he shall save
[1:44:40] his people
[1:44:43] from their sins
[1:44:46] that's why we needed Jesus a savior is a
[1:44:48] preserver Defender deliverer is also a
[1:44:51] further uh definitionist Jesus Christ
[1:44:54] saves the soul from condemnation to
[1:44:55] holiness
[1:44:57] and the and the body from the ruin of
[1:44:59] the grave and constitutes every believer
[1:45:01] in the heritor of immortality and
[1:45:04] eternal glory being the Son of God he
[1:45:06] became incarnate that he might by his
[1:45:09] obedience to the law of God and his
[1:45:12] enduring of his penalty or the curse he
[1:45:15] made atonement for the sin of the world
[1:45:18] and and by that he became the author of
[1:45:21] Eternal salvation to all them
[1:45:24] that obey him
[1:45:26] let's pick up two last quotes here and
[1:45:29] we will bring it to a close here
[1:45:31] smyrnian Church age one of my favorite I
[1:45:33] want you to just think about our Lord we
[1:45:36] we get the opportunity to go back and
[1:45:38] and talk about his birth specifically
[1:45:40] amen talk about his birth especially on
[1:45:42] this day we know he was not born on this
[1:45:45] day Jesus was born in the springtime and
[1:45:48] he also died in the springtime how do we
[1:45:50] know he was born in springtime because
[1:45:51] he was the Lamb of God
[1:45:55] and Lambs are born in the springtime
[1:45:58] hallelujah amen amen but let's talk
[1:46:03] about Jesus
[1:46:05] smirnian Church age says this oh how
[1:46:08] striking it is
[1:46:10] see we had to have something
[1:46:12] that was stronger than us
[1:46:14] to be able to bring us out of what we
[1:46:16] were in let me if you if you're bound in
[1:46:18] sin today you got to have something
[1:46:19] that's stronger than that sin that can
[1:46:21] bring you out and I'm telling you he is
[1:46:24] able Jesus Christ is able to do it
[1:46:28] you call the pastor all the pastor can
[1:46:30] do is pray for you but if you really
[1:46:32] want to come out you get to talking to
[1:46:34] Jesus
[1:46:36] he'll bring you out
[1:46:41] how striking it is
[1:46:44] jehovah-born crying over a manure pile
[1:46:50] Jehovah born in a manger of straw
[1:46:57] there is your Everlasting sign to the
[1:47:00] proud and puffed up pseudo-intellectuals
[1:47:02] that have evolved their own Theology and
[1:47:04] denied the truth of god Jehovah God
[1:47:07] a crying baby in a stinking Barn
[1:47:12] I was just you know sharing with
[1:47:13] somebody a few days ago uh sometime I
[1:47:16] just get you know I'm human I'm human
[1:47:19] sometimes I just get so discouraged I'd
[1:47:21] be like Lord come on I knew you got
[1:47:23] something for us open it up God open it
[1:47:25] up and I just I just be ready and then
[1:47:27] during the Lord just kind of Quicken
[1:47:29] something to me and I then I stopped
[1:47:30] complaining I said Lord you went to a
[1:47:32] cross and you died for my sins I can go
[1:47:35] to a school I can I can go to Fairfield
[1:47:39] Inn
[1:47:41] you didn't ask for a cross you're just
[1:47:43] sit there feeling I can do that
[1:47:48] sometimes God has to put you in check
[1:47:51] get your attitude right my attitude
[1:47:54] anyway
[1:47:56] thank you Lord
[1:47:57] Jehovah got a crying baby in a stinking
[1:48:00] Barn
[1:48:03] then we think we have a right to be
[1:48:04] proud holding up our nose is criticizing
[1:48:06] and acting as though we are we were
[1:48:08] somebody
[1:48:10] he's your real sign
[1:48:13] this is the right one Jehovah playing as
[1:48:16] a boy
[1:48:17] Jehovah working in a carpenter shop
[1:48:20] Jehovah watching the feet of fishermen I
[1:48:25] will give you a sign uh said God not the
[1:48:28] son of a white collared priesthood not
[1:48:30] the sign of wealth and power there's
[1:48:32] nothing in this sign that you'll want or
[1:48:35] think suitable but it isn't an
[1:48:37] everlasting sign it is the greatest sign
[1:48:39] of all Jehovah standing in the courtyard
[1:48:43] bruised and bleeding with thorns on his
[1:48:45] brow and and spit on his face mocked and
[1:48:50] said it not Jehovah despised and
[1:48:52] rejected hanging naked on the cross
[1:48:56] while the Hypocrites jeered and dared
[1:48:59] him to come down off the cross Jehovah
[1:49:01] dying
[1:49:04] look at this one Jehovah praying
[1:49:08] and nothing happened
[1:49:12] then Jehovah died
[1:49:16] that is a sign for all men now there
[1:49:19] isn't another like it it is the great
[1:49:21] one
[1:49:23] then Darkness Came Upon the Earth
[1:49:26] they put him in a tomb they relay those
[1:49:28] three days and and nights and Earth and
[1:49:31] earthquakes shattered the Gloom of night
[1:49:32] and he came forth Jehovah
[1:49:36] came forth
[1:49:38] Jehovah ascended on high
[1:49:41] then Jehovah returned to dwell in his
[1:49:45] church that's why those attributes are
[1:49:46] now being expressed through US Jehovah
[1:49:49] came back with with a mighty Russian
[1:49:51] wind and flames of fire Jehovah came
[1:49:54] back to walk in the midst of his church
[1:49:55] and Empower his people
[1:49:59] what's more Jehovah came and this time
[1:50:02] to stay in his people
[1:50:07] glory to his name and again Jehovah
[1:50:10] heals the sick
[1:50:12] well how's he doing it because he on on
[1:50:14] the earth when he when he was walking to
[1:50:16] face Earth with his own Natural Body he
[1:50:18] was healing sick but now he's died he's
[1:50:21] raised again he's empowered his people
[1:50:23] so now how is he Healing The Sick
[1:50:25] through his people
[1:50:29] you are an expression of his attribute
[1:50:34] and again Jehovah heals the sick raises
[1:50:37] the Dead
[1:50:38] you can pray for the day at the race
[1:50:41] amen and manifest himself by the spirit
[1:50:44] Jehovah came back speaking in tongues
[1:50:47] and giving the answer back in
[1:50:48] interpretation
[1:50:50] Jehovah came down and raised a
[1:50:52] prostitute to sin no more
[1:50:54] the same God that raised up
[1:50:57] Rahab you know because everybody else in
[1:51:00] the city died
[1:51:03] rehab was able to get married
[1:51:06] and she married the general of the army
[1:51:09] the Israel army and you know they stood
[1:51:12] there and they were they got to the part
[1:51:14] of the serum sea if there be anybody
[1:51:18] if there be one just one here that that
[1:51:22] could speak against this woman mayor and
[1:51:25] this man or this man marrying this woman
[1:51:26] speak now or forever hold your peace
[1:51:31] and I'ma tell you Ray happen to have to
[1:51:33] sit there wondering who was gonna speak

[1:51:51] can die and you can come alive in Christ
[1:51:56] no condemnation
[1:51:58] to them who walk
[1:52:00] after the spirits
[1:52:03] Hallelujah
[1:52:05] amen I just love God
[1:52:09] amen look at Jehovah came down raised he
[1:52:12] raised The Prostitute to sin no more
